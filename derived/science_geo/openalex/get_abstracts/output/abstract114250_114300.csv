https://openalex.org/W1977145510,"The DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) phosphorylates Sp1 and several other nuclear proteins. Here, we show that Sp1 and the DNA-PK must be colocalized on the same DNA molecule for efficient phosphorylation to occur. Interestingly, we find that the DNA-PK binds to and is activated by the ends of DNA molecules. Furthermore, we show that the DNA binding properties of the DNA-PK are identical to those of Ku, a well-characterized human autoimmune antigen. We demonstrate that the DNA-PK can be fractionated into two components, one of which is Ku and the other of which is a polypeptide of approximately 350 kd. DNA cross-linking and colmmunoprecipitation studies indicate that the catalytic 350 kd DNA-PK component is directed to DNA by protein-protein interactions with Ku. The implications of the unusual DNA binding mode and multicomponent nature of the DNA-PK are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1967769642,Acetylation of the N-terminal tails of the core histones directly facilitates the recognition by TFIIIA of the 5S RNA gene within model chromatin templates. This effect is independent of a reduction in the extent of histone-DNA interactions or a change in DNA helical repeat; it is also independent of whether a histone tetramer or octamer inhibits TFIIIA binding. Removal of the N-terminal tails from the core histones also facilitates the association of TFIIIA with nucleosomal templates. We suggest that the histone tails have a major role in restricting transcription factor access to DNA and that their acetylation releases this restriction by directing dissociation of the tails from DNA and/or inducing a change in DNA configuration on the histone core to allow transcription factor binding. Acetylation of core histones might be expected to exert a major influence on the accessibility of chromatin to regulatory molecules.
https://openalex.org/W1969810313,"The 4-kilodalton amyloid beta protein (A beta), which forms fibrillar deposits in Alzheimer's disease (AD), is derived from a large protein referred to as the amyloid beta protein precursor (beta APP). Human neuroblastoma (M17) cells transfected with constructs expressing wild-type beta APP or a mutant, beta APP delta NL, recently linked to familial AD were compared. After continuous metabolic labeling for 8 hours, cells expressing beta APP delta NL had five times more of an A beta-bearing, carboxyl terminal, beta APP derivative than cells expressing wild-type beta APP and they released six times more A beta into the medium. Thus this mutant beta APP may cause AD because its processing is altered in a way that releases increased amounts of A beta."
https://openalex.org/W2026537232,"Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is an autosomal dominant disorder that causes episodes of focal demyelinating neuropathy following minor trauma to peripheral nerves. We assign the HNPP locus to chromosome 17p11.2 and demonstrate the presence of a large interstitial deletion associated with this disorder in three unrelated pedigrees. De novo deletion is documented in one pedigree. The deleted region appears uniform in all pedigrees and includes the gene for peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP-22), suggesting that underexpression of PMP-22 may cause HNPP. The deletion in HNPP spans approximately 1.5 Mb and includes all markers that are known to map within the Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type 1A (CMT1A) duplication. Furthermore, the breakpoints in HNPP and CMT1A map to the same intervals in 17p11.2, suggesting that these genetic disorders may be the result of reciprocal products of unequal crossover."
https://openalex.org/W2085213714,"c-Myc (Myc) and Max proteins dimerize and bind DNA through basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper motifs (b-HLH-LZ). Using a genetic approach, we demonstrate that binding to Max is essential for Myc transforming activity and that Myc homodimers are inactive. Mutants of Myc and Max that bind efficiently to each other but not to their wild-type partners were generated by either exchanging the HLH-LZ domains or reciprocally modifying LZ dimerization specificities. While transformation defective on their own, complementary mutants restore Myc transforming activity when coexpressed in cells. The HLH-LZ exchange mutants also have dominant negative activity on wild-type Myc function. In addition, wild-type max antagonizes myc function in a dose-dependent manner, presumably through competition of Max-Max and Myc-Max dimers for common target DNA sites. Therefore, Max can function as both suppressor and activator of Myc. A general model for the role of Myc and Max in growth control is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2080071635,"The mechanism of interleukin-1 (IL-1) signaling is unknown. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha uses a signal transduction pathway that involves sphingomyelin hydrolysis to ceramide and stimulation of a ceramide-activated protein kinase. In intact EL4 thymoma cells, IL-1 beta similarly stimulated a rapid decrease of sphingomyelin and an elevation of ceramide, and enhanced ceramide-activated protein kinase activity. This cascade was also activated by IL-1 beta in a cell-free system, demonstrating tight coupling to the receptor. Exogenous sphingomyelinase, but not phospholipases A2, C, or D, in combination with phorbol ester replaced IL-1 beta to stimulate IL-2 secretion. Thus, IL-1 beta signals through the sphingomyelin pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2128525259,"The expression of some nuclear genes is sensitive to the functional state of mitochondria, a process we term retrograde regulation. Here we show that retrograde regulation of the yeast CIT2 gene encoding peroxisomal citrate synthase depends on a new class of upstream activation site element (UASr) and two previously unidentified genes, RTG1 and RTG2. RTG1 encodes a protein of 177 amino acids with similarity to basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors that likely functions at the CIT2 UASr. RTG2 encodes a protein of 394 amino acids of unknown function. Cells containing null alleles of RTG1 and RTG2 are viable and respiratory competent. However, they are auxotrophic for glutamic or aspartic acid and cannot use acetate as a sole carbon source, suggesting that both the tricarboxylic acid and glyoxylate cycles are compromised. Thus, RTG1 and RTG2 are pivotal genes in controlling interorganelle communication between mitochondria, peroxisomes, and the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W1966724584,"Saccharomyces telomeres consist of approximately 300 bp of C1-3A/TG1-3 DNA. Nondenaturing Southern hybridization, capable of detecting approximately 60 to approximately 300 bases of TG1-3 DNA, revealed that yeast telomeres acquired and lost TG1-3 tails, the predicted intermediate in telomere replication, in a cell cycle-dependent manner. TG1-3 tails were also detected on the ends of a linear plasmid isolated from late S phase cells. In addition, a nonlinear form of this plasmid was detected: this structure migrated in two-dimensional agarose gels like a nicked circle of the same size as the linear plasmid, but had considerably more single-stranded character than a conventional nicked circle. The evidence indicates that these circles were formed by telomere-telomere interactions involving the TG1-3 tails. These data provide evidence for a cell cycle-dependent change in telomere structure and demonstrate that TG1-3 tails, generated during replication of a linear plasmid in vivo, are capable of mediating telomere-telomere interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1999568515,"The mouse Xist gene maps to the X inactivation center (Xic) region and is expressed exclusively from the inactive X chromosome. It is thus a candidate gene for the Xic. We show that the onset of Xist expression in mouse development precedes X chromosome inactivation and may therefore be a cause rather than merely a consequence of X inactivation. The earliest Xist expression in morulae and blastocysts is imprinted, resulting in specific expression of the paternal Xist allele. Imprinted Xist expression may thus be the cause of nonrandom inactivation of the paternal X in trophectoderm. Strong Xce alleles can act to reduce the effect of imprinted Xist expression in the trophectoderm. The imprint on Xist expression is lost shortly before gastrulation when random X inactivation occurs. Our data support a direct role for Xist in the initiation of X inactivation."
https://openalex.org/W2010612745,"We have molecularly cloned and sequenced a cDNA for a rat liver nucleoporin with a molecular mass of 152.8 kd, termed nup153, that shares a repetitive degenerate pentapeptide motif with a subgroup of nucleoporins of yeast and vertebrates. However, its most striking feature is a novel 4-fold repeat of a Cys2-Cys2-type zinc finger motif. When expressed in E. coli, the zinc finger domain of nup153 binds DNA in a zinc-dependent fashion. Immunoelectron microscopy localized nup153 exclusively to the nucleoplasmic side of the nuclear pore complex. We suggest that nup153 recognizes a specific DNA sequence to organize the genome three-dimensionally and to gate transcribable genes to nuclear pore complexes."

https://openalex.org/W2021788635,"Proteins that are specifically localized to synaptic vesicles in the nervous system have been proposed to mediate aspects of synaptic transmission. Antibodies raised against the cytoplasmic domains of five of these proteins, vamp, rab3A, synaptophysin, synaptotagmin, and SV2, were used to investigate their function. Microinjection of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies raised against synaptotagmin (p65), but not the other vesicle proteins, decreases K+/Ca(2+)-mediated dopamine beta-hydroxylase surface staining, a measure of regulated secretion in PC12 cells. Microinjection of a soluble fragment of synaptotagmin encompassing one of the domains homologous to the C2 regulatory region of protein kinase C, but lacking the membrane anchor, also inhibits evoked dopamine beta-hydroxylase surface staining. These results provide support for the hypothesis that synaptotagmin, a Ca(2+)- and phospholipid-binding protein, is important for regulated exocytosis in neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1490044972,"A 73-day field study of in situ aerobic biodegradation of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the Hudson River shows that indigenous aerobic microorganisms can degrade the lightly chlorinated PCBs present in these sediments. Addition of inorganic nutrients, biphenyl, and oxygen enhanced PCB biodegradation, as indicated both by a 37 to 55 percent loss of PCBs and by the production of chlorobenzoates, intermediates in the PCB biodegradation pathway. Repeated inoculation with a purified PCB-degrading bacterium failed to improve biodegradative activity. Biodegradation was also observed under mixed but unamended conditions, which suggests that this process may occur commonly in river sediments, with implications for PCB fate models and risk assessments."
https://openalex.org/W2036594454,"Living cetaceans are subdivided into two highly distinct suborders, Odontoceti (the echolocating toothed whales) and Mysticeti (the filter-feeding baleen whales), which are believed to have had a long independent history. Here we report the determination of DNA sequences from two mitochondrial ribosomal gene segments (930 base pairs per species) for 16 species of cetaceans, a perissodactyl and a sloth, and construct the first phylogeny for whales and dolphins based on explicit cladistic methods. Our data (and earlier published myoglobin sequences) confirmed that cetaceans are closely related to artiodactyls and that all families and superfamilies of cetaceans are monophyletic. A surprising finding was that one group of toothed whales, the sperm whales, is more closely related to the baleen whales than to other odontocetes. The common ancestor of baleen whales and sperm whales might have lived only 10-15 million years ago. The suggested paraphyly of toothed whales has many implications for classification, phylogeny and our understanding of the evolutionary history of cetaceans."
https://openalex.org/W2048922695,"Organic reactions are often limited by stereoelectronic constrains that appear along the reaction coordinate. An antibody has been generated that overcomes these constraints and catalyzes a highly disfavored chemical transformation. The antibody facilitates the difficult 6-endo-tet ring closure of an epoxy-alcohol to form a tetrahydropyran. The catalyzed process is in formal violation of what has become known as Baldwin's rules for ring-closure reactions. In addition to controlling the regiochemistry of the disfavored cyclization reaction, these catalytic antibodies resolve enantiomeric substrates to afford a stereochemically pure product. The principles demonstrated in this study may be applicable to other disfavored chemical processes."

https://openalex.org/W2009892305,"In common with many other viruses, adenoviruses code for a protease essential for the development of infectivity. Recombinant adenovirus protease was active in crude in vitro complementation assays but was inactive with peptide or purified protein substrates. Activity was reconstituted by a component of adenovirus virions, which was identified as GVQSLKRRRCF, a peptide derived from the virus protein pVI. Synthetic peptides were used to demonstrate that the cysteine is essential and that the disulphide-linked dimer is required for activity. It is proposed that the adenovirus protease is a cysteine protease and that its activation by the peptide involves thiol-disulphide interchange, which serves to expose the active site cysteine. This represents a novel strategy for controlling the activity of a protease that is required for virus maturation."

https://openalex.org/W1931683448,"An aryl trifluoromethyl diazirine photo-reactive derivative was attached to the 2-thiocytidine residue at position 32 of tRNAIArg and this derivatized tRNA was bound to Escherichia coli 70S ribosomes. After irradiation at 350 nm the site of cross-linking to the 16S RNA was analyzed by our standard procedures and found to lie within the secondary structural element comprising bases 956-983; this region contains two modified nucleotides at positions 966 and 967. Similarly, an aryl azido photoreactive derivative was attached to the phenylalanine residue of Phe-tRNAPhe, and the derivatized aminoacyl tRNA was bound to the ribosome either at the A- or the P-site. In both cases, after irradiation at 250 nm, the cross-link site was localized to position 2439 of the 23S RNA; in the secondary structure of the latter the neighboring nucleotide 2442 is base-paired to a modified nucleotide at position 2069. Taken together with other cross-linking data, these results now directly implicate a total of 27 out of the 29 modified nucleotides in E. coli 16S and 23S RNA as lying within or close to the functional center of the ribosome.— Brimacombe, R., Mitchell, P., Osswald, M., Stade, K., Bochkariov, D.

https://openalex.org/W1978682138,The bZIP motif is characterized by a leucine zipper domain that mediates dimerization and a basic domain that contacts DNA. A series of transition metal dimerization domains were used to alter systematically the relative orientation of basic domain peptides. Both the affinity and the specificity of the peptide-DNA interaction depend on domain orientation. These results indicate that the precise configuration linking the domains is important; dimerization is not always sufficient for DNA binding. This approach to studying the effect of orientation on protein function complements mutagenesis and could be used in many systems.

https://openalex.org/W2028090446,"In Drosophila, the single male X chromosome is transcribed at twice the rate of a single female X chromosome. This hypertranscription requires the functions of at least four autosomal male-specific lethal genes (msls) and is under the control of the Sex-lethal (Sxl) gene. One of the msls, the maleless (mle) gene, encodes a protein that is associated with the male X chromosome. To investigate how dosage compensation is regulated, we have determined whether Sxl and the other msls are required for mle X chromosome binding. We have found that in females, Sxl functions to prevent mle from binding to the two X chromosomes. Additionally, we have found that mle X chromosome binding requires wild-type msl1, msl2, and msl3 functions. These data support a model whereby the activity of the mle protein is regulated through its association with one or more of the other msl proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1603678269,"Our knowledge of the 3′ processing of tRNA precursors is severely limited. Although six exoribonucleases able to act on Escherichia coli tRNA precursors in vitro have been identified, their involvement in tRNA maturation in vivo has not been demonstrated. Here we show, using a wide range of multiple RNase-deficient strains and a quantitative suppression assay, that at least five of these enzymes — RNase II, RNase D, RNase BN, RNase T, and RNase PH — can participate in the synthesis of functional tRNA^szi's in vivo. Moreover, any one of the five RNases is sufficient to allow tRNA processing to proceed although with varying effectiveness. Examination of the level of aminoacylation of tRNA isolated from RNase-deficient strains suggested that tRNA precursors accumulate in the most defective cells. These data indicate that exoribonucleases are required for tRNA maturation in vivo and that there is a high degree of functional overlap among the enzymes. These studies contribute to the identification of all the enzymes necessary for defining the complete processing pathway for E. coli tRNA precursors.— Reuven, N. B., and Deutscher, M. P. Multiple exoribonucleases are required for the 3′ processing of Escherichia coli tRNA precursors in vivo. FASEB J. 7: 143-148; 1993."

https://openalex.org/W1927253718,"The 5S rRNAs from Sulfolobus solfataricus and Pyrodictium occultum were digested to nucleosides and analyzed using directly-combined HPLC/mass spectrometry. P. occultum 5S rRNA contains two modified nucleoside species, N4-acetylcytidine (ac4C) and N4-acetyl-2'-O-methylcytidine (ac4Cm). Oligonucleotides were generated from P. occultum 5S rRNA by RNase T1 hydrolysis, and their molecular weights were determined using electrospray mass spectrometry and compared with those predicted from the P. occultum 5S RNA gene sequence. Deviation in mass between expected and observed molecular weights permitted ac4Cm to be located at position 35, in the nonanucleotide CAA-CACC[ac4Cm]G, and the ac4C in one or both of two (C,U)G trinucleotides. 2'-O-Methylcytidine is unambiguously characterized in S. solfataricus 5S rRNA, confirming earlier tentative assignments at the analogous sequence position (Stahl, D.A., Luehrsen, K.R., Woese, C.R., and Pace, N.R.

Potential effects of the presence of ac4C and ac4Cm on thermal stabilization of 5S rRNA in thermophiles are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1507183561,"To elucidate the role of the Mg2+ ion in ribozyme reactions, we carried out ab initio molecular orbital investigations on dianionic trimethoxyphosphorane A and its Mg2+ complex (overall a neutral molecule) as a model system for the reaction center of Tetrahymena-type ribozyme. Although dianionic oxyphosphorane A concentrates its negative charges on the equatorial phosphoryl oxygens, the coordination of the Mg2+ ion between these two oxygens is unlikely. Geometry optimizations of the complex and the electrostatic potential of A both suggest that Mg2+ coordination preferably occurs in the region between the axial oxygen and the equatorial phosphoryl oxygen. The considerations of electrostatic potential rationalize the geometries of carboxylate-metal and phosphate-metal interactions extracted from the Cambridge Structural Database as well. Consequently, the Mg2+ ion at the active site of Tetrahymena-type ribozyme most likely lies in the regions between the axial and equatorial oxygens. The axial-equatorial coordinations of Mg2+ ions conceivably increase the electronegativities of the axial oxygens and facilitate cleavage of the phosphodiester bond located at the junction of the intron and the exon. It is thus likely that the Mg2∗ ions play the key role in the phosphodiester cleavage reactions mediated by ribozymes.— Uchimaru, T., Uebayasi, M., Tanabe, K., Taira, K.

https://openalex.org/W1591323727,"A chemical modification-interference assay was used to evaluate the sequence requirements for self-cleavage of a 73-nucleotide self-cleaving RNA from the genomic hepatitis delta virus (HDV). Twenty-two nucleotides were categorized as individually essential for self-cleavage, shown by loss of activity when modified. All of these required nucleotides fell within 38 nucleotides downstream of the cleavage site, suggesting an essential structural or functional role for this region. Lesser effects were seen for nucleotides further 3′ of the cleavage site, and a small number of nucleotides had a negligible effect on the extent of self-cleavage when modified. Several modifications increased the extent of self-cleavage, suggesting these nucleotides may act to inhibit the reaction when unmodified. The functional requirements for certain nucleotides are discussed in the light of structural probing data and conventional mutational analysis available for other HDV RNAs.— Belinsky, M. G., Britton, E., Dinter-Gottlieb, G. Modification interference analysis of a self-cleaving RNA from hepatitis delta virus. FASEB J. 7: 130-136; 1993."

https://openalex.org/W1943661830,"Previous in vitro work has shown that Escherichia coli methionyl-tRNA synthetase has a limited ability to discriminate against cognate methionine in the editing site designed for noncognate homocysteine. As a result, a small fraction of the correct product Met-tRNA is deacylated with the formation of a cyclic sulfonium compound, S-methyl-homocysteine thiolactone. This is exploited here to estimate energy costs associated with the destruction of a correct product by methionyl-tRNA synthetase in bacterial cells. In vivo measurements of S-methyl-homocysteine thiolactone indicate that in Escherichia coli 3.3 molecules of Met-tRNA are destroyed by deacylation per 10,000 molecules of Met-tRNA successfully transferring methionine to protein. This number of destroyed molecules of a correct product, Met-tRNA, is 30 times lower than the number of destroyed molecules of an incorrect product, homocysteinyl adenylate. Thus, most of the energy cost of proofreading in vivo is due to editing of the noncognate amino acid.— Jakubowski, H.
