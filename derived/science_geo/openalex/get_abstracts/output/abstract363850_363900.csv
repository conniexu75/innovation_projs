https://openalex.org/W2087786585,"Current neural induction protocols for human embryonic stem (hES) cells rely on embryoid body formation, stromal feeder co-culture or selective survival conditions. Each strategy has considerable drawbacks, such as poorly defined culture conditions, protracted differentiation and low yield. Here we report that the synergistic action of two inhibitors of SMAD signaling, Noggin and SB431542, is sufficient to induce rapid and complete neural conversion of >80% of hES cells under adherent culture conditions. Temporal fate analysis reveals the appearance of a transient FGF5(+) epiblast-like stage followed by PAX6(+) neural cells competent to form rosettes. Initial cell density determines the ratio of central nervous system and neural crest progeny. Directed differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem (hiPS) cells into midbrain dopamine and spinal motoneurons confirms the robustness and general applicability of the induction protocol. Noggin/SB431542-based neural induction should facilitate the use of hES and hiPS cells in regenerative medicine and disease modeling and obviate the need for protocols based on stromal feeders or embryoid bodies."
https://openalex.org/W2074726646,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that is familial in 10% of cases. We have identified a missense mutation in the gene encoding fused in sarcoma (FUS) in a British kindred, linked to ALS6. In a survey of 197 familial ALS index cases, we identified two further missense mutations in eight families. Postmortem analysis of three cases with FUS mutations showed FUS-immunoreactive cytoplasmic inclusions and predominantly lower motor neuron degeneration. Cellular expression studies revealed aberrant localization of mutant FUS protein. FUS is involved in the regulation of transcription and RNA splicing and transport, and it has functional homology to another ALS gene, TARDBP , which suggests that a common mechanism may underlie motor neuron degeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2135607950,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal degenerative motor neuron disorder. Ten percent of cases are inherited; most involve unidentified genes. We report here 13 mutations in the fused in sarcoma/translated in liposarcoma ( FUS/TLS ) gene on chromosome 16 that were specific for familial ALS. The FUS/TLS protein binds to RNA, functions in diverse processes, and is normally located predominantly in the nucleus. In contrast, the mutant forms of FUS/TLS accumulated in the cytoplasm of neurons, a pathology that is similar to that of the gene TAR DNA-binding protein 43 ( TDP43 ), whose mutations also cause ALS. Neuronal cytoplasmic protein aggregation and defective RNA metabolism thus appear to be common pathogenic mechanisms involved in ALS and possibly in other neurodegenerative disorders."

https://openalex.org/W2158979552,"The discovery that non-germline adult cells can be reprogrammed to become pluripotent, able to differentiate into any cell type, opened up exciting possibilities. Reprogrammed cells — called induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells — should have great potential in regenerative medicine, but most current methods of producing them involve viral gene delivery that could cause abnormalities in the induced cells. Two groups in this issue report on a collaboration that has succeeded in producing pluripotency in human cells without using viral vectors. Stable iPS cells were produced in both human and mouse fibroblasts using virus-derived 2A peptide sequences to create a multicistronic vector incorporating the reprogramming factors, delivered to the cell by the piggyBac transposon vector. The 2A-linked reprogramming factors, not required in the established iPS cell lines, were then removed. This paper uses the piggyBac transposon to generate stable iPS cells from human and mouse fibroblasts; the individual piggyBac insertions can then be removed from established iPS cell lines. The study also demonstrates removal of reprogramming factors joined with 2A sequences (described in an accompanying paper; doi:10.1038/nature07864) delivered by a single transposon from murine iPS lines. Transgenic expression of just four defined transcription factors (c-Myc, Klf4, Oct4 and Sox2) is sufficient to reprogram somatic cells to a pluripotent state1,2,3,4. The resulting induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells resemble embryonic stem cells in their properties and potential to differentiate into a spectrum of adult cell types. Current reprogramming strategies involve retroviral1, lentiviral5, adenoviral6 and plasmid7 transfection to deliver reprogramming factor transgenes. Although the latter two methods are transient and minimize the potential for insertion mutagenesis, they are currently limited by diminished reprogramming efficiencies. piggyBac (PB) transposition is host-factor independent, and has recently been demonstrated to be functional in various human and mouse cell lines8,9,10,11. The PB transposon/transposase system requires only the inverted terminal repeats flanking a transgene and transient expression of the transposase enzyme to catalyse insertion or excision events12. Here we demonstrate successful and efficient reprogramming of murine and human embryonic fibroblasts using doxycycline-inducible transcription factors delivered by PB transposition13. Stable iPS cells thus generated express characteristic pluripotency markers and succeed in a series of rigorous differentiation assays. By taking advantage of the natural propensity of the PB system for seamless excision12, we show that the individual PB insertions can be removed from established iPS cell lines, providing an invaluable tool for discovery. In addition, we have demonstrated the traceless removal of reprogramming factors joined with viral 2A sequences14 delivered by a single transposon from murine iPS lines. We anticipate that the unique properties of this virus-independent simplification of iPS cell production will accelerate this field further towards full exploration of the reprogramming process and future cell-based therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2106485710,"Reprogramming of somatic cells to pluripotency, thereby creating induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, promises to transform regenerative medicine. Most instances of direct reprogramming have been achieved by forced expression of defined factors using multiple viral vectors. However, such iPS cells contain a large number of viral vector integrations, any one of which could cause unpredictable genetic dysfunction. Whereas c-Myc is dispensable for reprogramming, complete elimination of the other exogenous factors is also desired because ectopic expression of either Oct4 (also known as Pou5f1) or Klf4 can induce dysplasia. Two transient transfection-reprogramming methods have been published to address this issue. However, the efficiency of both approaches is extremely low, and neither has been applied successfully to human cells so far. Here we show that non-viral transfection of a single multiprotein expression vector, which comprises the coding sequences of c-Myc, Klf4, Oct4 and Sox2 linked with 2A peptides, can reprogram both mouse and human fibroblasts. Moreover, the transgene can be removed once reprogramming has been achieved. iPS cells produced with this non-viral vector show robust expression of pluripotency markers, indicating a reprogrammed state confirmed functionally by in vitro differentiation assays and formation of adult chimaeric mice. When the single-vector reprogramming system was combined with a piggyBac transposon, we succeeded in establishing reprogrammed human cell lines from embryonic fibroblasts with robust expression of pluripotency markers. This system minimizes genome modification in iPS cells and enables complete elimination of exogenous reprogramming factors, efficiently providing iPS cells that are applicable to regenerative medicine, drug screening and the establishment of disease models."
https://openalex.org/W2009988274,"Juvenile hemochromatosis is an iron-overload disorder caused by mutations in the genes encoding the major iron regulatory hormone hepcidin (HAMP) and hemojuvelin (HFE2). We have previously shown that hemojuvelin is a co-receptor for bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and that BMP signals regulate hepcidin expression and iron metabolism. However, the endogenous BMP regulator(s) of hepcidin in vivo is unknown. Here we show that compared with soluble hemojuvelin (HJV.Fc), the homologous DRAGON.Fc is a more potent inhibitor of BMP2 or BMP4 but a less potent inhibitor of BMP6 in vitro. In vivo, HJV.Fc or a neutralizing antibody to BMP6 inhibits hepcidin expression and increases serum iron, whereas DRAGON.Fc has no effect. Notably, Bmp6-null mice have a phenotype resembling hereditary hemochromatosis, with reduced hepcidin expression and tissue iron overload. Finally, we demonstrate a physical interaction between HJV.Fc and BMP6, and we show that BMP6 increases hepcidin expression and reduces serum iron in mice. These data support a key role for BMP6 as a ligand for hemojuvelin and an endogenous regulator of hepcidin expression and iron metabolism in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2025024815,"Clostridium difficile is the leading cause of infectious diarrhoea in hospitals worldwide, because of its virulence, spore-forming ability and persistence. C. difficile-associated diseases are induced by antibiotic treatment or disruption of the normal gastrointestinal flora. Recently, morbidity and mortality resulting from C. difficile-associated diseases have increased significantly due to changes in the virulence of the causative strains and antibiotic usage patterns. Since 2002, epidemic toxinotype III NAP1/027 strains, which produce high levels of the major virulence factors, toxin A and toxin B, have emerged. These toxins have 63% amino acid sequence similarity and are members of the large clostridial glucosylating toxin family, which are monoglucosyltransferases that are pro-inflammatory, cytotoxic and enterotoxic in the human colon. Inside host cells, both toxins catalyse the transfer of glucose onto the Rho family of GTPases, leading to cell death. However, the role of these toxins in the context of a C. difficile infection is unknown. Here we describe the construction of isogenic tcdA and tcdB (encoding toxin A and B, respectively) mutants of a virulent C. difficile strain and their use in the hamster disease model to show that toxin B is a key virulence determinant. Previous studies showed that purified toxin A alone can induce most of the pathology observed after infection of hamsters with C. difficile and that toxin B is not toxic in animals unless it is co-administered with toxin A, suggesting that the toxins act synergistically. Our work provides evidence that toxin B, not toxin A, is essential for virulence. Furthermore, it is clear that the importance of these toxins in the context of infection cannot be predicted exclusively from studies using purified toxins, reinforcing the importance of using the natural infection process to dissect the role of toxins in disease."
https://openalex.org/W2027616725,"Although senile plaques focally disrupt neuronal health, the functional response of astrocytes to Alzheimer's disease pathology is unknown. Using multiphoton fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy in vivo, we quantitatively imaged astrocytic calcium homeostasis in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. Resting calcium was globally elevated in the astrocytic network, but was independent of proximity to individual plaques. Time-lapse imaging revealed that calcium transients in astrocytes were more frequent, synchronously coordinated across long distances, and uncoupled from neuronal activity. Furthermore, rare intercellular calcium waves were observed, but only in mice with amyloid-β plaques, originating near plaques and spreading radially at least 200 micrometers. Thus, although neurotoxicity is observed near amyloid-β deposits, there exists a more general astrocyte-based network response to focal pathology."

https://openalex.org/W1973931642,"In common parlance, moral transgressions “leave a bad taste in the mouth.” This metaphor implies a link between moral disgust and more primitive forms of disgust related to toxicity and disease, yet convincing evidence for this relationship is still lacking. We tested directly the primitive oral origins of moral disgust by searching for similarity in the facial motor activity evoked by gustatory distaste (elicited by unpleasant tastes), basic disgust (elicited by photographs of contaminants), and moral disgust (elicited by unfair treatment in an economic game). We found that all three states evoked activation of the levator labii muscle region of the face, characteristic of an oralnasal rejection response. These results suggest that immorality elicits the same disgust as disease vectors and bad tastes."
https://openalex.org/W2057968182,"The development of electronic devices at the single-molecule scale requires detailed understanding of charge transport through individual molecular wires. To characterize the electrical conductance, it is necessary to vary the length of a single molecular wire, contacted to two electrodes, in a controlled way. Such studies usually determine the conductance of a certain molecular species with one specific length. We measure the conductance and mechanical characteristics of a single polyfluorene wire by pulling it up from a Au(111) surface with the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope, thus continuously changing its length up to more than 20 nanometers. The conductance curves show not only an exponential decay but also characteristic oscillations as one molecular unit after another is detached from the surface during stretching."
https://openalex.org/W2071973715,"β-lactam antibiotics are ineffective against Mycobacterium tuberculosis , being rapidly hydrolyzed by the chromosomally encoded blaC gene product. The carbapenem class of β-lactams are very poor substrates for BlaC, allowing us to determine the three-dimensional structure of the covalent BlaC-meropenem covalent complex at 1.8 angstrom resolution. When meropenem was combined with the β-lactamase inhibitor clavulanate, potent activity against laboratory strains of M. tuberculosis was observed [minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC meropenem ) less than 1 microgram per milliliter], and sterilization of aerobically grown cultures was observed within 14 days. In addition, this combination exhibited inhibitory activity against anaerobically grown cultures that mimic the “persistent” state and inhibited the growth of 13 extensively drug-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis at the same levels seen for drug-susceptible strains. Meropenem and clavulanate are Food and Drug Administration–approved drugs and could potentially be used to treat patients with currently untreatable disease."

https://openalex.org/W1483942114,"Nicotine addiction begins with high-affinity binding of nicotine to acetylcholine (ACh) receptors in the brain. The end result is over 4,000,000 smoking-related deaths annually worldwide and the largest source of preventable mortality in developed countries. Stress reduction, pleasure, improved cognition and other central nervous system effects are strongly associated with smoking. However, if nicotine activated ACh receptors found in muscle as potently as it does brain ACh receptors, smoking would cause intolerable and perhaps fatal muscle contractions. Despite extensive pharmacological, functional and structural studies of ACh receptors, the basis for the differential action of nicotine on brain compared with muscle ACh receptors has not been determined. Here we show that at the alpha4beta2 brain receptors thought to underlie nicotine addiction, the high affinity for nicotine is the result of a strong cation-pi interaction to a specific aromatic amino acid of the receptor, TrpB. In contrast, the low affinity for nicotine at the muscle-type ACh receptor is largely due to the fact that this key interaction is absent, even though the immediate binding site residues, including the key amino acid TrpB, are identical in the brain and muscle receptors. At the same time a hydrogen bond from nicotine to the backbone carbonyl of TrpB is enhanced in the neuronal receptor relative to the muscle type. A point mutation near TrpB that differentiates alpha4beta2 and muscle-type receptors seems to influence the shape of the binding site, allowing nicotine to interact more strongly with TrpB in the neuronal receptor. ACh receptors are established therapeutic targets for Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, smoking cessation, pain, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, epilepsy, autism and depression. Along with solving a chemical mystery in nicotine addiction, our results provide guidance for efforts to develop drugs that target specific types of nicotinic receptors."

https://openalex.org/W2161722835,"Immune sensing of a microbe occurs via multiple receptors. How signals from different receptors are coordinated to yield a specific immune response is poorly understood. We show that two pathogen recognition receptors, Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and dectin-1, recognizing the same microbial stimulus, stimulate distinct innate and adaptive responses. TLR2 signaling induced splenic dendritic cells (DCs) to express the retinoic acid metabolizing enzyme retinaldehyde dehydrogenase type 2 and interleukin-10 (IL-10) and to metabolize vitamin A and stimulate Foxp3(+) T regulatory cells (T(reg) cells). Retinoic acid acted on DCs to induce suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 expression, which suppressed activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and proinflammatory cytokines. Consistent with this finding, TLR2 signaling induced T(reg) cells and suppressed IL-23 and T helper type 17 (T(H)17) and T(H)1-mediated autoimmune responses in vivo. In contrast, dectin-1 signaling mostly induced IL-23 and proinflammatory cytokines and augmented T(H)17 and T(H)1-mediated autoimmune responses in vivo. These data define a new mechanism for the systemic induction of retinoic acid and immune suppression against autoimmunity."

Here, we report hominin footprints in two sedimentary layers dated at 1.51 to 1.53 million years ago (Ma) at Ileret, Kenya, providing the oldest evidence of an essentially modern human-like foot anatomy, with a relatively adducted hallux, medial longitudinal arch, and medial weight transfer before push-off. The size of the Ileret footprints is consistent with stature and body mass estimates for Homo ergaster/erectus, and these prints are also morphologically distinct from the 3.75-million-year-old footprints at Laetoli, Tanzania. The Ileret prints show that by 1.5 Ma, hominins had evolved an essentially modern human foot function and style of bipedal locomotion."
https://openalex.org/W2136859247,"Cognitive control permits us to make decisions about abstract actions, such as whether to e-mail versus call a friend, and to select the concrete motor programs required to produce those actions, based on our goals and knowledge. The frontal lobes are necessary for cognitive control at all levels of abstraction. Recent neuroimaging data have motivated the hypothesis that the frontal lobes are organized hierarchically, such that control is supported in progressively caudal regions as decisions are made at more concrete levels of action. We found that frontal damage impaired action decisions at a level of abstraction that was dependent on lesion location (rostral lesions affected more abstract tasks, whereas caudal lesions affected more concrete tasks), in addition to impairing tasks requiring more, but not less, abstract action control. Moreover, two adjacent regions were distinguished on the basis of the level of control, consistent with previous functional magnetic resonance imaging results. These results provide direct evidence for a rostro-caudal hierarchical organization of the frontal lobes."
https://openalex.org/W2054110511,"MicroRNAs (miRNA) are short non-coding RNA molecules that regulate a variety of biological processes. The role of miRNAs in BMP2-mediated biological processes is of considerable interest. A comparative miRNA array led to the isolation of several BMP2-responsive miRNAs. Among them, miR-199a* is of particular interest, because it was reported to be specifically expressed in the skeletal system. Here we demonstrate that miR-199a* is an early responsive target of BMP2: its level was dramatically reduced at 5 h, quickly increased at 24 h and remained higher thereafter in the course of BMP2-triggered chondrogenesis of a micromass culture of pluripotent C3H10T1/2 stem cells. miR-199a* significantly inhibited early chondrogenesis, as revealed by the reduced expression of early marker genes for chondrogenesis such as cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), type II collagen, and Sox9, whereas anti-miR-199a* increased the expression of these chondrogenic marker genes. A computer-based prediction algorithm led to the identification of Smad1, a well established downstream molecule of BMP-2 signaling, as a putative target of miR-199a*. The pattern of Smad1 mRNA expression exhibited the mirror opposite of miR-199a* expression following BMP-2 induction. Furthermore, miR-199a* demonstrated remarkable inhibition of both endogenous Smad1 as well as a reporter construct bearing the 3-untranslated region of Smad1 mRNA. In addition, mutation of miR-199a* binding sites in the 3′-untranslated region of Smad1 mRNA abolished miR-199a*-mediated repression of reporter gene activity. Mechanism studies revealed that miR-199a* inhibits Smad1/Smad4-mediated transactivation of target genes, and that overexpression of Smad1 completely corrects miR-199a*-mediated repression of early chondrogenesis.

First discovered in 1993, they are thought to regulate the expression of approximately one-third of all mammalian genes (1.Lewis B.P. Burge C.B. Bartel D.P. Cell. 2005; 120: 15-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9936) Google Scholar). Functioning at the post-transcriptional level, miRNAs inhibit mRNA expression by binding to the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of mRNA before directing the repression of translation and/or mRNA degradation. They have been implicated as important regulators of a variety of biological processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, development, and tumorigenesis (2.Chan S.P. Slack F.J.

Mature single-stranded miRNA is generated from a long primary genomic transcript (pri-miRNA), which is processed in the nucleus by the enzymes Drosha and DGCR8, resulting in the excision of a stem loop structure. The resulting 60–80-nucleotide precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA) is exported into the cytoplasm by Exportin 5. In the cytoplasm, the RNase III enzyme Dicer processes the precursor miRNA to generate a short RNA duplex. One strand of the duplex is degraded, leaving a single-stranded mature miRNA molecule, which combines with members of the Argonaute protein family, to form the RNA-induced silencing complex (10.Lin E.A. Liu C.J. Front. Biosci. 2009; 14: 2757-2764Google Scholar). miRNAs play an important role in differentiation and development across a whole range of organisms and tissue types. However, little is known about the precise role of miRNAs in cartilage development (10.Lin E.A. Liu C.J. Front. Biosci. 2009; 14: 2757-2764Google Scholar). It is known that miRNAs play a significant role in chondrogenic differentiation, because differential disruption of the Dicer gene in mice results in highly abnormal cartilage development (11.Kobayashi T. Lu J. Cobb B.S. Rodda S.J. McMahon A.P. Schipani E. Merkenschlager M. Kronenberg H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 1949-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). However, a specific miRNA that regulates chondrogenesis has yet to be identified. There have been various studies on the expression patterns of miRNA in various tissues. For example, miR-140 is exclusively expressed in the cartilage tissue of embryonic zebrafish (12.Berezikov E. Guryev V. van de Belt J. Wienholds E. Plasterk R.H. Cuppen E. Cell. 2005; 120: 21-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). However, direct evidence of the role of miRNA in directing chondrogenic differentiation is lacking. To determine the role of miRNAs in osteochondrogenic differentiation, we developed a miRNA expression profile of mesenchymal stem cells induced by bone morphogenic protein (BMP), by using a microarray approach. Using this profile, we were able to identify potential candidate miRNAs. After screening these candidates, we have obtained experimental evidence to present miR-199a* as a novel miRNA to be directly implicated in the chondrogenic differentiation process, acting as an inhibitor of early chondrogenesis. We were also able to provide evidence that miR-199a* inhibits early chondrogenesis by targeting and suppressing the expression of the Smad protein family 1 (Smad1), a key downstream mediator of BMP signaling and a major regulator of bone and cartilage development (13.Chen D. Zhao M. Harris S.E. Mi Z. Front. Biosci. 2004; 9: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 14.Chen D. Zhao M. Mundy G.R. Growth Factors. 2004; 22: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar). Construction of Plasmids—The miR-199a* expression plasmid, pSuper199a* was generated using standard DNA techniques. The mouse miR-199a* precursor, including ∼160 bp of genomic flanking sequence, was cloned between the HindIII and XbaI restriction sites of the pSuper-Basic vector (Oligoengine) using the following primer pair: 5′-TTGATAAGCTTCTCCCTGGCCTGTACCATG-3′;5′-GATCTCGAGAAAAATGGTCTGGAAGTTCCCACTG-3′. The primers contained either a HindIII or XhoI (underlined) restriction site. The anti-miR199a*-1 plasmid was generated by cloning a sequence complementary to the hairpin sequence of the precursor miR-199a* molecule. The following primer pair was used: 5′-GATCCCCTCAGGAGGCTGGGACATGTTTCAAGAGAACATGTCCCAGCCTCCTGATTTTTA-3′,5′-AGCTTAAAAATCAGGAGGCTGGGACATGTTCTCTTGAAACATGTCCCAGCCTCCTGAGGG-3′. Because there exists two distinct hairpin precursors for mir-199a*, a second plasmid (anti-miR199a*-2) was generated using the following primer pair: 5′-GATCCCCTCAGGACAATGCCGTTGTATTCAAGAGATACAACGGCATTGTCCTGATTTTTA-3′,5′-AGCTTAAAAATCAGGACAATGCCGTTGTATCTCTTGAATACAACGGCATTGTCCTGAGGG-3′. The control plasmid, pSuper-control was generated by cloning an unrelated miRNA into the pSuper plasmid using the following primer pair: 5′-GATCCCCATGGGTGTGAACCACGAGATTCAAGAGATCTCGTGGTTCACACCCATTTTTTA-3′,5′-AGCTTAAAAAATGGGTGTGAACCACGAGATCTCTTGAATCTCGTGGTTCACACCCATGGG-3′. pGLSmad1, which contains the luciferase reporter gene adjacent to the Smad1 3′-UTR, was generated by cloning the Smad1 3′-UTR sequence into the XbaI site of the pGL3-Control vector (Promega) using the following primer pair: 5′-TAGACTCTAGAAAGACCTGTGGCTTCCGTCTC-3′,5′-CCGACTCTAGAAGTAGAGAAAAACCCTGCTAG-3′. Both primers contained a XbaI restriction site (underlined). Site-directed Mutagenesis—pGLSmad1mut1 and pGLSmad1-mut2 were each derived from pGLSmad1 by mutating one of the two miR-199a* seed sites within the Smad1 3′-UTR sequence (see Fig. 5A for detail). The mutations were carried out using the QuikChange XL Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Each mutation consisted of replacing four consecutive base pairs at the 3′ region of the seed site. The following primer pair was used for pGLSmad1mut1: 5′-ACGATAATACTTGACCTCTGTGACCATAATTTGGATTGAGAAACTGACAAGCCTTG-3′,5′-CAAGGCTTGTCAGTTTCTCAATCCAAATTATGGTCACAGAGGTCAAGTATTATCGT-3′; and for pGLSmad1mut2: 5′-TTCTGAAACTGTATGCTGGCTGTATATAAGTCAGAATGATGGCAGGCATATGC-3′,5′-GCATATGCCTGCCATCATTCTGACTTATATACAGCCAGCATACAGTTTCAGAA-3′. pGLSmad1mut1,2 was derived from pGLSmad1 by mutating both miR-199a* seed sites, using the primers described above. Total RNA and MicroRNA Isolation for Microarray—Total cellular RNA was purified for microarray analysis by a modified TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) involving an enhanced precipitation by adding 1 volume of isopropyl alcohol to the extracted aqueous phase, precipitating at -20 °C overnight, and centrifuging the RNA for 30 min at 14,000 × g at 4 °C. For microRNA array profiling, the microRNA population was prepared by the TRIzol method as described above, followed by Flash-PAGE (Ambion) fractionation of total RNA according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The concentration, purity, and integrity of total RNA and fractionated small RNA population were determined by NanoDrop ND-1000 and Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer.

Enright A.J. Aravin A. Tuschl T. Sander C. Marks D.S. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: e363Crossref PubMed Scopus (2973) Google Scholar) miRNA target prediction algorithms were used to identify microRNA targets. Real-Time PCR—Total RNA (including total microRNA) was harvested from C3H10T1/2 cells using the mirVana miRNA isolation kit (Ambion). The RNA was reverse transcribed using the TaqMan miRNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems) and miRNA-specific primers (Applied Biosystems). MicroRNA expression levels were then analyzed using the appropriate TaqMan miRNA assay (Applied Biosystems) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitation of the ubiquitously expressed miRNA, snoRNA202, was performed as an endogenous control. To determine the expression levels of Col2a1 and cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), total RNA was analyzed using the ImProm-II Reverse Transcription System (Promega) followed by real-time PCR with SYBR Green chemistry. A reaction mixture containing the SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and the appropriate primers was added to a 96-well plate, together with 1 μl of cDNA template, for a final reaction volume of 20 μl/well, and run for an initial step at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of amplification at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 60 s. Absolute quantization of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was performed as an endogenous control. All real-time PCR were carried out in an ABI prism 7500 PCR amplification system (PE Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Primer sequences are as follows: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase forward, 5′-ATGACATCAAGAAGGTGGTG-3′, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase reverse, 5′-CATACCAGGAAATGAGCTTG-3′; Col2a1 forward, 5′-TGGTGGAGCAGCAAGAGCAA-3′, Col2a1 reverse, 5′-CAGTGGACAGTAGACGGAGGAAA-3′; Smad1 forward, 5′-GCTTCGTGAAGGGTTGGGG-3′, Smad1 reverse, 5′-CGGATGAAATAGGATTGTGGGG-3′. Reporter Gene Assay—Inhibition of Smad1 reporter constructs was assayed by co-transfection of C3H10T1/2 cells with pGL3Smad1 (1.5 μg), various amounts of pSupermir-199a*, and a pSVGal control plasmid (1.5 μg). Additionally, pSuper vector was used to bring the total amount of transfected DNA to 11 μg. Co-transfections were carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in 6-well plates as per the manufacturer's instructions. Cultures were harvested after 48 h of incubation. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were assayed using the Tropix Galacto-Star Reporter Gene Assay system (Applied Biosystems) and Luciferase Assay Regent (Promega). Measurements were carried out in a Mini-Lum Luminometer (Bioscan). The assays were performed in triplicate. Immunoblotting Analysis—To examine the expression of Sox9, Col2A1, and COMP in the course of chondrogenesis, total cell extracts prepared from micromass cultures of C3H10T1/2 cells were mixed with 5 × sample buffer (312.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% SDS, 0.5% bromphenol blue, 50% glycerol). Proteins were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking in 10% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline, Tween 20 (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20), blots were incubated with anti-Sox9, anti-COMP, or anti-Col 2 antibody (diluted 1:1000) for 1 h. Anti-tubulin antibody (diluted 1:2000) was used as a loading control. After washing, the respective secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin; 1:1000 dilution) was added, and bound antibody was visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). Chondrogenic Differentiation Assay—Cultures of C3H10T1/2 murine mesenchymal stem cells were maintained in standard 10-cm tissue culture dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, with a change of medium every 2–3 days. Cultures were stored in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. A modified micromass culture technique was carried out, as previously described (21.Liu C. J. Musculoskelet. Neuronal Interact. 2005; 5: 340-341PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Liu C.J. Prazak L. Fajardo M. Yu S. Tyagi N. Di Cesare P.E. J. Biol.

Transfections were carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in 6-well plates as per the manufacturer's instructions. For each sample, 4 μg of plasmid and 10 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 was diluted with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium to reach a total volume of 500 μl. After incubation for 20 min at room temperature, the mixture was introduced into the well containing cells growing at ∼90% confluence in 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Following transfection with the specified plasmids, the cells were incubated for 48 h. The cells were then trypsinized and brought into suspension at a density of 107 cells/ml. 10 μl of the suspension was placed into the center of each well on a standard 12-well polystyrene tissue culture plate. After incubation for 2 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2, wells were flooded with 1 ml of culture medium (supplemented with fetal bovine serum) containing 100 ng/ml recombinant BMP-2. Replacement with fresh medium containing BMP-2 was carried out every 2–3 days. Mouse prechondrogenic ATDC5 cells were maintained in a medium consisting of a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium (Flow Laboratories, Irvine, UK) containing 5% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 10 μg/ml human transferrin (Roche Applied Science), and 30 nm sodium selenite (Sigma) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. ATDC5 cells transfected with either pSuper control encoding a nonrelated miRNA, pSuper-mir199a* or pSuper-anti-mir199a* plasmid, were seeded at a density of 3 × 105 cells per well in 6-well cell-culture plates (Corning, Slangerup, Denmark). To induce chondrogenesis, cells were cultured in the medium supplemented with 10 μg/ml human insulin (Sigma) (24.Chen L. Fink T. Zhang X.Y. Ebbesen P. Zachar V. Differentiation. 2005; 73: 350-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 25.Kong L. Liu C.J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 3494-3506Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 26.Shukunami C. Shigeno C. Atsumi T. Ishizeki K. Suzuki F. Hiraki Y. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The medium was replaced every 2–3 days. Within 3 days, both mRNA and protein of cells were collected for real-time PCR and Western blot assay. miRNAs Are Differentially Expressed following BMP-2 Treatment of C2C12 Cells—To identify candidate miRNAs that regulate bone and/or cartilage differentiation and development, the expression profile of numerous miRNAs was determined via commercial microarray. C2C12 cells were exposed to BMP-2 (200 ng/ml) and harvested within 24 h; total RNA was extracted and used for array analysis. miRNA expression patterns following BMP-2 treatment were then compared with reference levels obtained from cells prior to BMP-2 induction. Microarray analysis revealed multiple miRNAs that were either positively or negatively regulated by BMP-2 induction (Fig. 1A). Based on these results, the expression levels of selected miRNAs were assayed using real-time PCR in C2C12 cells at various time points following BMP-2 induction. The expression levels of miR-374, miR-210, and miR-143 were largely consistent with the microarray data (Fig. 1, B–D). Interestingly, although the microarray showed the expression of miR-374 and miR-143 to be increased and decreased, respectively, the TaqMan real-time PCR assay revealed that both miRNAs had similar expression profiles, characterized by a significant increase in expression during the first 12 h of BMP-2 induction, followed by a rapid decline to extremely low expression levels (Fig. 1, B and D). The microarray data showed that miR-199a* was significantly up-regulated at 24 h following BMP-2 induction, with expression levels that were ∼4-fold greater than those in untreated cells. miR-199a* is highly expressed in the embryonic skeletal system of a wide range of organisms (27.Ason B. Darnell D.K. Wittbrodt B. Berezikov E. Kloosterman W.P. Wittbrodt J. Antin P.B. Plasterk R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Berezikov E. de Bruijn E. Horvitz H.R. Kauppinen S. Plasterk R.H. Science. 2005; 309: 310-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar). Therefore, using real-time PCR TaqMan® miRNA assays, we sought to verify the expression pattern of miR-199a* following BMP-2 treatment in C3H10T1/2 cells, a well established in vitro cell model for studying chondrogenesis (22.Liu C.J. Prazak L. Fajardo M. Yu S. Tyagi N. Di Cesare P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47081-47091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 30.Liu C.J. Zhang Y. Xu K. Parsons D. Alfonso D. Di Cesare P.E. Front. Biosci. 2007; 12: 3899-3910Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). At 6 h following BMP-2 treatment, the expression of miR-199a* was reduced below the limit of detection of the assay (Fig. 1E); however, at 24 h, miR-199a* levels had risen dramatically and continued to rise gradually over the following 6 days. The highest level of expression occurred on the 7th day of BMP-2 induction and was ∼2-fold greater than that for untreated C3H10T1/2 cells. In addition, to verify our results in other miRNAs, we also analyzed the expression pattern of miR-374 in BMP-2-treated C3H10T1/2 cells. Such analysis showed miR-374 levels to be significantly increased following BMP-2 treatment, as expected (Fig. 1F). miR-199a* Overexpression Inhibits Chondrogenic Differentiation—To determine whether miR-199a* mediates chondrogenic differentiation, we constructed the miRNA expression plasmid, pSuper199a*, by cloning the miR-199a* precursor into the pSuper vector, followed by transfection into C3H10T1/2 cells, using techniques described previously (31.Shi B. Sepp-Lorenzino L. Prisco M. Linsley P. deAngelis T. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32582-32590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Real-time PCR analysis of C3H10T1/2 cells transfected with pSuper199a* revealed a significant decrease in the mRNA expression levels of chondrogenesis markers Col2A1 and COMP, when compared with control cells 24 h after induction with BMP-2 (100 ng/ml) (Fig. 2A). This suggests that miR-199a* functions as an inhibitor of the early stages of chondrogenic differentiation. Because the cell models used thus far have relied on BMP-2 to induce chondrogenesis, we next sought to determine whether the effects of miR-199a* were specific to the BMP-2 chondrogenic growth factor. To do so, we repeated the experiment using murine prechondrogenic ATDC5 cells that undergo chondrogenic differentiation in the presence of human insulin (10 mg/ml). We compared cells transfected with pSuper199a* or a control plasmid encoding an unrelated miRNA, pSuper-control. Both immunoblotting analysis (Fig. 2B) and real-time PCR (Fig. 2C) revealed a significant decrease in early chondrogenesis markers Col2A1, COMP, and Sox9 in this ATDC5 cell model. This suggests that miR-199a* functions as a mediator of early chondrogenesis, and not as a general response to BMP-2 signaling. Inhibition of miR-199a* Enhances Chondrogenic Differentiation—To further define the role of miR-199a* in chondrogenic differentiation, we constructed a miRNA expression plasmid, anti-miR199a*-1, that generated a short RNA sequence complementary to the hairpin sequence of the miR-199a* precursor molecule. By binding to the miR-199a* precursor, the products of this plasmid would inhibit miR-199a* synthesis. Because two distinct precursors have been identified for miR-199a*, a second plasmid, anti-miR-199a*-2 was also generated. ATDC5 cells were transfected with either an equimolar mixture of anti-miR199a*-1 and anti-miR199a*-2 or pSuper-Control and chondrogenesis was induced. Both real-time PCR and Western blotting assays revealed a significant increase in chondrogenesis markers Col2A1, COMP, and Sox9, when compared with the control (Fig. 3, A and B). Smad Family 1 (Smad1) Is a Target of miR-199a*—The miRNA target prediction program miRanda was utilized to generate a list of predicted mRNA targets for miR-199a*. This list was then used to identify putative miRNA target genes that are coincidentally involved in BMP-2 signaling and chondrogenic differentiation. Members of the miR-199 family were predicted to target members of the Smad gene family. Smad1 and Smad5, which are known downstream mediators of BMP signaling in osteochondroprogenitor cells (3.Chen C.Z. Li L. Lodish H.F. Bartel D.P. Science. 2004; 303: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2804) Google Scholar), were both identified as putative targets of miR-199a* (Fig. 4A). Smad1 is an established mediator of both osteoblastic and chondrogenic differentiation of progenitor cells in response to stimulation by BMPs (13.Chen D. Zhao M. Harris S.E. Mi Z. Front. Biosci. 2004; 9: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 14.Chen D. Zhao M. Mundy G.R. Growth Factors. 2004; 22: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar, 32.Hatakeyama Y. Nguyen J. Wang X. Nuckolls G.H. Shum L. J. Bone Joint Surg. Am. 2003; 85: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The putative repression of Smad1 mRNA expression by miR-199a* would hinder BMP-2 signaling, and thus serve to explain how overexpression of miR-199a* may inhibit BMP-2-induced chondrogenic differentiation. miRNA inhibits mRNA expression by binding to a specific sequence with the 3′-UTR, also known as a “seed site.” Perfect complementarity of a particular miRNA to the seed site is thought to result in mRNA cleavage, whereas imperfect complementarity generally results in translational repression, without degrading the mRNA itself (33.Carrington J.C. Ambros V. Science. 2003; 301: 336-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (1511) Google Scholar, 34.Doench J.G. Petersen C.P. Sharp P.A.

A. 2003; 100: 9779-9784Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). miR-199a* binds to a seed site within the Smad1 3′-UTR with near, but not perfect complementarity (Fig. 5A), suggesting that it may not affect the level of Smad1 mRNA. However, imperfect complementarity can also result in mRNA cleavage, in certain cases (36.Kim V.N. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1993-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 37.Kim V.N. Nam J.W.

Science. 2004; 304: 594-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1414) Google Scholar). In addition, the Smad1 3′-UTR contains two putative miR-199a* seed sites, which would suggest a stronger association than if only one site were present (Fig. 4B). To determine whether miR-199a* cleaves Smad1 mRNA, the expression of Smad1 mRNA was measured via real-time PCR immediately following BMP-2 induction of C3H10T1/2 cells. The pattern of Smad1 mRNA expression was found to be th"

The physiological role of both proteins is not known at present, but studies in model organisms have linked their mutants to distinct aspects of mitochondrial dysfunction, increased vulnerability to oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress, and intracellular protein sorting. Here, we show that a mutation in the Caenorhabditits elegans homologue of the PTEN-induced kinase pink-1 gene resulted in reduced mitochondrial cristae length and increased paraquat sensitivity of the nematode. Moreover, the mutants also displayed defects in axonal outgrowth of a pair of canal-associated neurons. We demonstrate that in the absence of lrk-1, the C. elegans homologue of human LRRK2, all phenotypic aspects of pink-1 loss-of-function mutants were suppressed. Conversely, the hypersensitivity of lrk-1 mutant animals to the endoplasmic reticulum stressor tunicamycin was reduced in a pink-1 mutant background. These results provide the first evidence of an antagonistic role of PINK-1 and LRK-1. Due to the similarity of the C. elegans proteins to human LRRK2 and PINK1, we suggest a common role of both factors in cellular functions including stress response and regulation of neurite outgrowth. This study might help to link pink-1/PINK1 and lrk-1/LRRK2 function to the pathological processes resulting from Parkinson disease-related mutants in both genes, the first manifestations of which are cytoskeletal defects in affected neurons.

The GTPase-regulated kinase LRRK2, another gene associated with familial PD, has been linked to the biogenesis and regulation of vesicular transport (13Hatano T. Kubo S. Imai S. Maeda M. Ishikawa K.

In support of this notion, the C. elegans lrk-1, the LRRK2 homologue, has recently been shown to be involved in synaptobrevin-associated vesicular transport (15Sakaguchi-Nakashima A. Meir J.Y. Jin Y. Matsumoto K. Hisamoto N. Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 592-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Moreover, the Dictyostelium homologue of LRRK2/LRK-1 proteins, GbpC, a cGMP-binding protein is required for the normal phosphorylation and cytoskeletal assembly of myosin (16Bosgraaf L. Russcher H. Smith J.L. Wessels D. Soll D.R. Van Haastert P.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4560-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Based on this data, it had been anticipated that PINK1/PINK-1 and LRRK2/LRK-1 might be involved in distinct cellular functions, whereas pathological mutations in both genes, leading either to loss-of-function (PINK1) or gain-of-function (LRRK2), result in a similar phenotype, the loss of dopaminergic neurons. In the present study, we found a functional connection between their Caenorhabditits elegans homologues pink-1 and lrk-1. We demonstrate that loss of C. elegans pink-1 results in oxidative stress sensitivity and neurite outgrowth defects. All aspects of pink-1 deficiency were suppressed in the absence of lrk-1 that, as a single mutant, displayed a profound hypersensitivity to the ER stressor tunicamycin. Because the latter phenotype was in turn suppressed by deleting pink-1, our results support an antagonistic role of pink-1 and lrk-1 in stress response and neuronal activities. All strains used in this study were maintained on NGM plates (different diameters) seeded with Escherichia coli OP50 and cultivated at 20 °C as previously described (17Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The C. elegans strains were obtained from Dr. Shohei Mitani (National Bioresource Project, Japan) and provided by Dr. Erik Lundquist (University of Kansas) and Dr. Kunihiro Matsumoto (Nagoya University, Japan). The following mutations and integrated arrays were used in this study: LGI, lrk-1(tm1898, km41); LGII, pink-1(tm1779); LGX, lqIs4 [ceh-10::gfp, lin-15(n765)]. N2 (Bristol) was used as the C. elegans wild type strain. For the determination of the expression pattern of pink-1, the translational gfp fusion Ppink-1::pink-1::gfp (pBY2101), was generated by cloning the complete genomic fragment of pink-1 (3191 bp) fused to a 6-kb upstream promoter region and to GFP at the C terminus in pPD117.01 (gift of A. Fire, Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford, CA). 10 ng/μl of the resulting plasmid (pBY2101) was injected into pha-1(e2123) animals along with the pha-1 rescue plasmid (pBX1) to yield strain BR3645 (pha-1(e2123);byEx686 [pink-1]) and BR3646 (pha-1(e2123);byEx687 [pink-1]), respectively. For the pink-1 rescue experiment, 10 ng/μl pBY2101 was co-injected with Pmyo-2::mCherry (pBY2550) as injection maker (pBY2550) and herring sperm DNA into pink-1(tm1779) animals (BR4006: pink-1(tm1779);byEx655 [pink-1]; BR4007: pink-1(tm1779);byEx681 [pink-1]). For the lrk-1 expression and rescue experiments, the translational fusion construct, Plrk-1::lrk-1::gfp (pBY2254) was generated by cloning the complete genomic region of lrk-1 (14 kb) to a 4.5-kb upstream promoter region and to GFP at the C terminus in pPD117.01 (provided by Dr. A. Fire, Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford, CA). For generating byIs137 [lrk-1], Plrk-1::lrk-1::gfp (pBY2254) and myo-2::mCherry (pBY2109) were co-injected into N2 wild type and lrk-1(tm1898) animals, UV integrated, and backcrossed multiple times. Furthermore, 0.1 ng/μl of the cosmid T27C10 as well as 0.1 ng/μl of the plasmid Paex-3::lrk-1(G1876S) (pBY2617) were co-injected with pBY2550 and herring sperm DNA into lqIs4 [ceh-10::gfp, lin-15(n765)] or lrk-1(tm1898) animals to obtain three independent extrachromosomal lines [lqIs4[ceh-10::gfp, lin-15(n765)];byEx737–739[T27C10] (BR5303–5305), or BR5300–5302:lrk-1(tm1898);byEx734–736[lrk-1(G1876S)]. To determine the brood size, individual L4 hermaphrodites were placed onto fresh NGM plates and incubated at 20 °C. To prevent overcrowding, worms were transferred daily onto new NGM plates for three consecutive days. The progeny was counted 2–3 days after removal of the P0 generation (18Wong A. Boutis P. Hekimi S. Genetics. 1995; 139: 1247-1259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For oxidative stress assays (paraquat), seeded NGM plates (Ø 3.5 cm) containing E. coli OP50 and 150 mm paraquat (Sigma) were used. Synchronized L4 animals were analyzed for their survival at 20 °C after 3 days (19Hertweck M. Gobel C. Baumeister R. Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 577-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). For the ER stress assay (tunicamycin), adult worms were allowed to lay eggs for 3–4 h at 20 °C on NGM agar plates (Ø 3.5 cm) containing 1.5 μg/ml tunicamycin (Sigma). Eggs were counted and the number of worms at the L4 or young adult stage was scored 3 days later (20Springer W. Hoppe T. Schmidt E. Baumeister R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 3407-3423Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Tunicamycin, which is isolated from Streptomyces sp., consists of at least four homologous antibiotics that differ in their fatty acid composition. As a consequence, the strength of the inhibitory activity on N-linked glycosylation varies in each individual batch. Mean values of the number of progeny that reached the L4 or the young adult stage (tunicamycin assay) and survivors (paraquat assay) were calculated from different experimental groups of at least three independent assays each. For analyzing canal-associated neurons (CAN) axon pathfinding, L4 animals, harboring an integrated ceh-10::gfp transgene (lqIs4 kindly provided by Erik Lundquist), were scored for defects as described (21Lundquist E.A. Reddien P.W. Hartwieg E. Horvitz H.R. Bargmann C.I. Development. 2001; 128: 4475-4488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). About 20 young adult worms were transferred into a 100-μm deep aluminum platelet/chamber (Microscopy Services, Flintbek) that was filled with E. coli OP50 suspension and immediately frozen using a BalTec HPM 10. Freeze substitution was carried out in a Leica EM AFS at −90 °C for 100 h in 0.1% tannic acid and another 7 h in 2% OsO4 (each w/v in dry acetone) as described (22Rostaing P. Real E. Siksou L. Lechaire J.P. Boudier T. Boeckers T.M. Gertler F. Gundelfinger E.D. Triller A. Marty S. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2006; 24: 3463-3474Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). For electron microscopy, 40-nm sections were cut using a Leica UC6 ultramicrotome. Ribbons of sections were transferred on Formvar-coated copper slot-grids. The grids were placed for 10 min on drops of 4% (w/v) uranyl acetate in 75% methanol and then washed in distilled water. After air drying the grids were placed on lead citrate (23Reynolds E.S. J. Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 208-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (17731) Google Scholar) for 2 min in a CO2-free chamber, and rinsed in distilled water. Micrographs were taken with a 1024 × 1024 CCD detector (Proscan CCD HSS 512/1024; Proscan Electronic Systems, Scheuring, Germany) in a Zeiss EM 902A, operated in the bright field mode. Longitudinal sections of muscle mitochondria were analyzed as the following: a square of 1 × 0.2 μm was placed longitudinally to the inner face of the membrane surrounding the mitochondrium. The total length of the apparent cristae in the square was determined manually and summed. The value for each square was calculated as membrane length/area (μm/μm2) and 1–4 squares were used per mitochondrium. The total area of cross-sectioned neuronal mitochondria in axons in the ventral nerve cord and the length of all apparent cristae were determined manually and calculated as membrane length/area (μm/μm2). Total RNA was isolated from mixed staged worm plates (wild type and pink-1(tm1779) animals) and prepared with an RNAeasy kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). 10 μg of total RNA was loaded per lane on the gel. PCR fragments for the probes of interest were labeled radioactively with [α-32P]dCTP using random hexamer primers and the Klenow fragment of the DNA polymerase. For amplification of the pink-1-specific probe the following oligonucleotides were used: GTCTATGAAACGATTCGG and CATTCTTTCCAGGAACAGCCGTC. Hybridization with the probes was done in standard hybridization buffer (10% dextran sulfate, 10× Denhart's, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1% SDS, 0.1% sodium pyrophosphate, 1 m NaCl, 50% formamide (deionized), 0.2 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA) overnight at 65 °C. After three washing steps (30 min, 2× SSC, 1% SDS at 65 °C; 15 min, 0.2 SSC at 65 °C, 15 min; 0.2 × SSC at room temperature). The radioactive signal was detected using the Bio-Rad Molecular Imager FX (Bio-Rad). act-1-specific probes were used as controls. The amino acid alignment was generated using ClustalW. Pictures of GFP expression were taken using a Zeiss AxioImager Microscope, the AxioCam camera, and the AxioVision Rel.4.6 software. For statistical analyses GraphPad Prism version 4.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) was used. Statistical methods were applied as used in previous studies (3Clark I.E. Dodson M.W.

Sequence analysis of C. elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, and human PINK-1 revealed a single C. elegans homologue, which we termed PINK-1 (PTEN-induced kinase-1 homolog) (supplemental Fig. S1A). Like human PINK1, PINK-1 consists of two characteristic motifs, an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence and a serine/threonine kinase domain that shares 36% identity and 54% similarity to human PINK1 (supplemental Fig. S1B) (1Valente E.M. Abou-Sleiman P.M. Caputo V. Muqit M.M. Harvey K. Gispert S. Ali Z. Del T.D. Bentivoglio A.R. Healy D.G. Albanese A. Nussbaum R. Gonzalez-Maldonado R. Deller T. Salvi S. Cortelli P. Gilks W.P. Latchman D.S. Harvey R.J. Dallapiccola B. Auburger G. Wood N.W. Science. 2004; 304: 1158-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2694) Google Scholar). Due to the absence of a functional antibody against C. elegans PINK-1, we used a translational GFP fusion that rescues the pink-1 mutant phenotype (see below) to determine the expression pattern of pink-1. PINK-1::GFP is detected in many cell types and is maintained throughout all stages of postembryonic development and adulthood (Fig. 1). GFP staining was observed in head and tail neurons (Fig. 1, A–B and E–F) and in neurons of the midbody region, such as the canal-associated neurons (CAN) (Fig. 1, G and H). Expression was also seen in many non-neuronal cells including the pharyngeal muscles (Fig. 1, A and B) and the vulva (Fig. 1, C and D). We found that a fraction of C. elegans PINK-1 co-localized with the mitochondrial marker Mitotracker Red (Fig. 1, I and K), indicating both mitochondrial and cytoplasmic distribution of the fusion protein. Similarly, endogenous PINK1 in human cells may also be localized both to mitochondria and the cytoplasm (8Weihofen A. Ostaszewski B. Minami Y. Selkoe D.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2008; 17: 602-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 9Takatori S. Ito G. Iwatsubo T. Neurosci. Lett. 2008; 430: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 10Gandhi S. Muqit M.M.

Previous experiments in cultivated mammalian cells, mouse, and D. melanogaster have shown that loss of PINK1 resulted in both an increased vulnerability to oxidative stress and morphological alterations of mitochondrial structures, indicated by reduced or disrupted mitochondrial cristae (2Park J. Lee S.B. Lee S. Kim Y. Song S. Kim S. Bae E. Kim J. Shong M. Kim J.M. Chung J. Nature. 2006; 441: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1344) Google Scholar, 3Clark I.E. Dodson M.W. Jiang C. Cao J.H.

A. 2006; 103: 10793-10798Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). To compare the consequences of loss-of-function of pink-1 in C. elegans with findings from other organisms, we characterized a deletion mutant of pink-1 (kindly provided by S. Mitani). The pink-1(tm1779) allele harbors a 350-bp deletion that eliminates part of the promoter region and the first two exons including the proposed transcriptional and translational start sites. Northern blot analysis revealed that pink-1(tm1779) is indeed a null allele (supplemental Fig. S2). Thus, the deletion most likely results in a complete functional loss (supplemental Fig. S2). pink-1(tm1779) animals were viable, developed normally, and showed a slightly reduced brood size at 20 °C (179 ± 5; Table 1). To investigate the role of C. elegans pink-1 in oxidative stress response, we exposed pink-1(tm1779) animals to 150 mm paraquat and measured their survival rates as previously described (19Hertweck M. Gobel C. Baumeister R. Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 577-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Interestingly, pink1(tm1779) animals displayed an increased sensitivity to a 3-day exposure to paraquat compared with wild type (71.5 ± 3.1% survivors; Fig. 2A). Expression of transgenic pink-1 in pink-1(tm1779) mutants was sufficient to partially rescue the animals against paraquat-induced toxicity (Fig. 2B) and other defects (see below). This indicates that the phenotype of the pink-1(tm1779) animals was indeed due to the deletion in the pink-1 locus. Because down-regulation of PINK1 in D. melanogaster was accompanied by mitochondrial defects especially of the wing musculature (2Park J. Lee S.B. Lee S. Kim Y. Song S. Kim S. Bae E. Kim J. Shong M. Kim J.M. Chung J. Nature. 2006; 441: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1344) Google Scholar, 3Clark I.E. Dodson M.W. Jiang C. Cao J.H. Huh J.R. Seol J.H. Yoo S.J. Hay B.A. Guo M. Nature. 2006; 441: 1162-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (1398) Google Scholar), we examined the morphological integrity of mitochondria in C. elegans pink-1 mutants using rapid freeze-electron microscopy (Fig. 3). In longitudinal sections of C. elegans we determined that the apparent length of mitochondrial cristae was reduced by 12% in muscle cells and by more than 30% in the neurons of pink-1(tm1779) animals compared with wild type (Fig. 3, C and D). Notably, transgenic expression of a wild type copy of pink-1 was able to rescue the mitochondrial defects due to loss of pink-1 function in both neuronal and muscle cells (Fig. 3, C and D). The coincidence of both oxidative stress sensitivity and mitochondrial phenotypes may support a conserved function of PINK1/PINK-1 in mitochondrial homeostasis. In summary, wild type levels of PINK-1 protect C. elegans against oxidative stress, which is in agreement with reports from other model organisms (2Park J. Lee S.B. Lee S. Kim Y. Song S. Kim S.

However, no functional connection between PINK1 and the GTPase-regulated kinase LRRK2 has been demonstrated so far. As it was shown before by a systematic study that disease-associated genes are functionally connected and genes causing similar diseases form subnetworks (27Gandhi T.K. Zhong J. Mathivanan S. Karthick L. Chandrika K.N. Mohan S.S. Sharma S. Pinkert S. Nagaraju S. Periaswamy B. Mishra G. Nandakumar K. Shen B. Deshpande N. Nayak R. Sarker M. Boeke J.D. Parmigiani G. Schultz J. Bader J.S. Pandey A. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), we were encouraged to investigate whether C. elegans LRK-1 and PINK-1 may contribute to overlapping biological functions. The C. elegans lrk-1 shares 35% identity (57% similarity) within the GTPase domain, and 37% identity (57% similarity) within the kinase domain of human LRRK2, respectively. We confirmed the widespread expression pattern of lrk-1 that has been reported earlier (15Sakaguchi-Nakashima A. Meir J.Y. Jin Y. Matsumoto K. Hisamoto N. Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 592-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). lrk-1 is co-expressed with pink-1 in several tissues including the cells of the nervous system and many non-neuronal tissues, such as the body wall musculature and the epithelial cells of the nematode vulva (supplemental Fig. S3). We examined two deletion alleles of lrk-1 and first confirmed the synaptobrevin sorting defect for lrk-1(tm1898) animals (data not shown) that was previously reported for the allele km41 (15Sakaguchi-Nakashima A. Meir J.Y. Jin Y. Matsumoto K. Hisamoto N. Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 592-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Similar to lrk-1(km41), the lrk-1(tm1898) allele harbors an out-of-frame deletion, resulting in loss of both the GTPase and kinase domains. Thus, both alleles probably represent severe loss-of-function alleles that express truncated proteins only consisting of the N-terminal ankyrin repeat. Although pink-1 mutant animals were sensitive to paraquat treatment, the survival rates of both lrk-1(tm1898) and lrk-1(km41) animals were not different from wild type (Fig. 2A). Surprisingly, both alleles of lrk-1 suppressed the paraquat sensitivity of pink-1(tm1779) mutants, resulting in survival levels comparable with wild type (Fig. 2A). Although lrk-1(tm1898) showed a mild reduction in the number of progeny at 20 °C (208 ± 9; Table 1), the double mutants lrk-1(tm1898);pink-1(tm1779) produced a wild type number of progeny (249 ± 7; Table 1), suggesting antagonistic activities of the two genes. Because oxidative stress sensitivity is often the consequence of mitochondrial dysfunction, we next tested mitochondrial integrity in lrk-1 single and lrk-1(tm1898);pink-1(tm1779) double mutants. In agreement with a report of D. melanogaster LRRK mutants (28Lee S.B. Kim W. Lee S. Chung J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 358: 534-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), the mitochondria of C. elegans lrk-1(tm1898) single mutants were indistinguishable from wild type (Fig. 3). Remarkably, lrk-1(tm1898) suppressed the cristae defects of pink-1(tm1779) animals to wild type levels (Fig. 3, C and D). Taken together, our results indicate that genetic deletion of lrk-1 could compensate for both the oxidative stress sensitivity and the morphological defects observed in a pink-1 loss-of-function allele. In addition to alterations in the oxidative stress response, defects in protein trafficking as well as impaired protein degradation have been reported to contribute to PD pathology (29Ryu E.J.

Curiously, the eudicot Arabidopsis thaliana is not affected when either function is lost. By use of mutation selection and positional cloning, we showed that the largest subunit of the presumed maize Pol IV is involved in paramutation, an inherited epigenetic change facilitated by an interaction between two alleles, as well as normal maize development. Bioinformatics analyses and nuclear run-on transcription assays indicate that Pol IV does not engage in the efficient RNA synthesis typical of the three major eukaryotic DNA-dependent RNA polymerases. These results indicate that Pol IV employs abnormal RNA polymerase activities to achieve genome-wide silencing and that its absence affects both maize development and heritable epigenetic changes."

https://openalex.org/W2152223521,"Eukaryotic transcription occurs within a chromatin environment, whose organization has an important regulatory function and is partly encoded in cis by the DNA sequence itself. Here, we examine whether evolutionary changes in gene expression are linked to changes in the DNA-encoded nucleosome organization of promoters. We find that in aerobic yeast species, where cellular respiration genes are active under typical growth conditions, the promoter sequences of these genes encode a relatively open (nucleosome-depleted) chromatin organization. This nucleosome-depleted organization requires only DNA sequence information, is independent of any cofactors and of transcription, and is a general property of growth-related genes. In contrast, in anaerobic yeast species, where cellular respiration genes are relatively inactive under typical growth conditions, respiration gene promoters encode relatively closed (nucleosome-occupied) chromatin organizations. Our results suggest a previously unidentified genetic mechanism underlying phenotypic diversity, consisting of DNA sequence changes that directly alter the DNA-encoded nucleosome organization of promoters."
https://openalex.org/W2009487182,"Mammals have single-rowed dentitions, whereas many nonmammalian vertebrates have teeth in multiple rows. Neither the molecular mechanism regulating iterative tooth initiation nor that restricting mammalian tooth development in one row is known. We found that mice lacking the transcription factor odd-skipped related-2 (Osr2) develop supernumerary teeth lingual to their molars because of expansion of the odontogenic field. Osr2 was expressed in a lingual-to-buccal gradient and restricted expression of bone morphogenetic protein 4 (Bmp4), an essential odontogenic signal, in the developing tooth mesenchyme. Expansion of odontogenic field in Osr2 -deficient mice required Msx1, a feedback activator of Bmp4 expression. These findings suggest that the Bmp4-Msx1 pathway propagates mesenchymal activation for sequential tooth induction and that spatial modulation of this pathway provides a mechanism for patterning vertebrate dentition."

https://openalex.org/W2030438495,"Cerebellar granule cells from sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) lyase-deficient mice were used to study the toxicity of this potent sphingolipid metabolite in terminally differentiated postmitotic neurons. Based on earlier findings with the lyase-stable, semi-synthetic, cis-4-methylsphingosine phosphate, we hypothesized that accumulation of S1P above a certain threshold induces neuronal apoptosis. The present studies confirmed this conclusion and further revealed that for S1P to induce apoptosis in lyase-deficient neurons it must also be produced by sphingosine-kinase2 (SK2). These conclusions are based on the finding that incubation of lyase-deficient neurons with either sphingosine or S1P results in a similar elevation in cellular S1P; however, only S1P addition to the culture medium induces apoptosis. This was not due to S1P acting on the S1P receptor but to hydrolysis of S1P to sphingosine that was phosphorylated by the cells, as described before for cis-4-methylsphingosine. Although the cells produced S1P from both exogenously added sphingosine as well as sphingosine derived from exogenous S1P, the S1P from these two sources were not equivalent, because the former was primarily produced by SK1, whereas the latter was mainly formed by SK2 (as also was cis-4-methylsphingosine phosphate), based on studies in neurons lacking SK1 or SK2 activity. Thus, these investigations show that, due to the existence of at least two functionally distinct intracellular origins for S1P, exogenous S1P can be neurotoxic. In this model, S1P accumulated due to a defective lyase, however, this cause of toxicity might also be important in other cases, as illustrated by the neurotoxicity of cis-4-methylsphingosine phosphate."

The mechanism(s) that regulates T-cell migration is of considerable relevance for understanding the pathogenesis of various diseases, such as chronic inflammatory diseases and cancer metastasis. This study was designed to identify potential involvement of STAT3, a latent transcription factor, in mediating integrin-induced T-cell migration. Using our previously characterized in vitro model for lymphocyte migration, we demonstrate that STAT3 is activated and translocated to the nucleus during the process of active motility of Hut78 T-lymphoma cells triggered via LFA-1. Blocking STAT3 signaling by multiple approaches inhibited LFA-1-induced T-cell locomotion via destabilization of microtubules and post-translational modification of tubulin. Here, we show that STAT3 physically interacts with stathmin to regulate microtubule dynamics in migrating T-cells. These observations strongly indicate that STAT3 is critically important for T-cell migration and associated signaling events.

These observations strongly indicate that STAT3 is critically important for T-cell migration and associated signaling events. Efficient operation of the adaptive immune system requires migration of T-lymphocytes from the vascular compartment across tissue barriers and through the extracellular matrix. This process involves a series of integrin ligand-receptor interactions (1Hogg N. Laschinger M. Giles K. McDowall A. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4695-4705Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) that initially retards lymphocyte flow and ultimately leads to arrest and diapedesis across the endothelium (2Springer T.A.

By engagement with ligands from the intercellular adhesion molecule group (ICAMs), in particular ICAM-1, LFA-1 also provides a strong adhesive force to promote and stabilize T-cell and antigen-presenting cell conjugate formation. We have demonstrated that LFA-1 transduces a variety of transmembrane signals in crawling T-cells involving protein kinase C activation and cytoskeletal rearrangement (4Volkov Y. Long A. Kelleher D. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6487-6495PubMed Google Scholar, 6Long A. Kelleher D. Lynch S. Volkov Y. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 636-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 7Freely S. Volkov Y.

Gastroenterology. 2005; 130: 482-492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, the exact sequence of downstream integrin-mediated signaling events resulting in cytoskeletal rearrangements and cell locomotion is not fully understood. T-cell migration involves cross-talk between integrins and the cytoskeleton, coordinated changes in the cytoskeleton, and the controlled formation and dispersal of adhesion sites (10Kupfer A. Singer S.J. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 1697-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Motile lymphocytes develop trailing extensions, which contain cytoskeletal and signaling elements (11Hauzenberger D. Klominek J. Sundqvist K.G. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 15: 285-316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Microtubules (MTs) are essential components of the cytoskeleton and are important for many aspects of mammalian cell responses, including cell division, growth, migration, and signaling (12Watanabe T. Noritake J. Kaibuchi K. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 76-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 13Westermann S. Weber K. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 938-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 14Gundersen G.G. Bulinski J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1118-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Whereas the actin cytoskeleton provides the driving force at the cell front, the MT network assumes a regulatory function in coordinating rear retraction (15Wehrle-Haller B. Imhof H.A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 35: 39-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). MT retraction into the cellular uropod is an important step in T-cell motility (4Volkov Y. Long A. Kelleher D. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6487-6495PubMed Google Scholar, 8Volkov Y. Long A. McGrath S. Eidhin D.N. Kelleher D. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 508-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). MTs are necessary for directed migration of multiple cells, and there are several possible mechanisms by which disruption or interference of MTs could block cell motility. These include impairment of the repositioning of the microtubule organizing center (MTOC), changes in MT interaction with focal adhesions, inhibition of the MT polymerization and depolymerization cycle, inhibition of intracellular protein trafficking and vesicle transport, and interference with MT-mediated integrin clustering and increased avidity (16Waterman-Storer C.M. Salmon E.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The reorganization of the MT cytoskeleton depends on the global and local activity of several proteins that affect nucleation dynamics and arrangement of the filament systems. Tubulins, the building block of MTs, are subject to specific post-translational modifications, including acetylation, detyrosination, and tyrosination (13Westermann S. Weber K. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 938-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 17Luduena R.F. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1998; 178: 207-275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which potentially modulate the functions and localization of MTs within the cell. The signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) are a family of latent cytoplasmic transcription factors that are activated by many cytokines and growth factors (18Levy D.E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (2501) Google Scholar). The STAT family is composed of seven members in mammals, of which STAT3 is the most pleiotropic member (18Levy D.E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (2501) Google Scholar, 19Yamashita S. Miyagi C. Carmany-Rampey A. Shimizu T. Fujii R. Schier A.F. Hirano A.F. Dev.

Immunol. 2007; 7: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (1464) Google Scholar), and appears to have important and unique functions. Cell stimulation can activate STAT family members by tyrosine phosphorylation to induce their dimerization; activated STAT3 translocates from the cytosol to the cell nucleus to mediate transcription of a number of STAT3-responsive genes (21Brierley M.M. Fish N. J. Inteferon Cytokine Res. 2005; 25: 733-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). STAT3 was originally identified as a mediator of the acute phase of inflammatory response triggered by interleukin-6 (22Ihle J.N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). However, it is now known that STAT3 is implicated in several biological processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival (18Levy D.E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (2501) Google Scholar, 19Yamashita S. Miyagi C. Carmany-Rampey A. Shimizu T. Fujii R. Schier A.F. Hirano A.F. Dev.

Oncogene. 2005; 24: 3397-3408Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Although STAT3 knock-out in mice caused early embryonic lethality (25Takeda K. Noguchi K. Shi W. Tanaka T. Matsumoto M. Yoshida N. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3801-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar), conditional gene targeting using the Cre-loxP strategy has revealed a critical role for STAT3 in cell migration in keratinocytes (23Akira S.

Tarutani M. Yamaguchi Y. Miura H. Yoshikawa K. Akira S. Takeda J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4657-4668Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). The 18-kDa phosphoprotein stathmin (also known as oncoprotein 18) is a tubulin-binding protein involved in the control of MT assembly and dynamics (27Andersen S.S. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 261-267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 28Niethammer P. Bastiaens P. Karsenti E.

Originally identified as a key factor in cell proliferation, it also plays roles as a relay protein and integrating protein within intracellular signaling networks (31Sobel A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 301-305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effect of stathmin on MT growth is believed to derive from its ability to sequester tubulin by binding tubulin dimers, which decreases the concentration of free heterodimers available to polymerization (20Yu H. Kortylewski M. Pardoll D. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (1464) Google Scholar, 30Steinmetz M.O. J. Struct. Biol. 2007; 158: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The MT-destabilizing activity of stathmin is turned off by cell surface receptor kinase cascades and cyclin-dependent kinases (32Giampietro C. Luzzati F. Gambarotta G. Giacobini P. Boda E. Fasolo A. Perroteau I. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 1825-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). By changing MT polymerization/depolymerization dynamics, stathmin may help the cell react to external stimuli. A recent study has suggested a functional link between stathmin and STAT3, whereby STAT3 interacts with stathmin and antagonizes its MT depolymerization activity (33Ng D.C.H. Lin B.H. Lim C.P. Huang G. Zhang T. Poli V. Cao X. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Here, we report a role for STAT3 in LFA-1-induced T-cell migration. Upon LFA-1 cross-linking, STAT3 is activated by tyrosine phosphorylation that translocates to the nucleus and interacts with stathmin to regulate MT dynamics in migrating T-cells. Antibodies and Reagents—Antibody used for induction of T-cell motility as previously described (8Volkov Y. Long A. McGrath S. Eidhin D.N. Kelleher D. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 508-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) was of the motility-inducing clone SPVL7 (monoclonal antibody to the α-chain of LFA-1 from Monosan, Sanbio, Uden, The Netherlands). Rabbit monoclonal anti-STAT3, anti-phospho-STAT3 (Tyr705), anti-stathmin, anti-phosphostathmin(Ser16), anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). Mouse monoclonal anti-α-tubulin, anti-acetylated tubulin (clone 6-11B-1), anti-tyrosinated tubulin (TUB-1A2), and goat anti-human IgG (Fc-specific) antibodies were from Sigma. Goat anti-mouse IgG was from Dako A/S (Denmark). Human rICAM-1 was from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Alexa fluor-488-conjugated anti-mouse antibody and Alexa fluor-546 Phalloidin were from Invitrogen. Cell-permeable AG490 was obtained from Calbiochem. Cell Culture—The human cutaneous T-lymphoma cell line Hut78 (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Manassas, VA) was used and cultured as described previously (4Volkov Y. Long A. Kelleher D. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6487-6495PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and antibiotics (penicillin (100 IU/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml)) in a humidified chamber at 37 °C containing 5% CO2. Induction of Cell Motility—The ability of T-cells to display integrin-induced locomotory behavior was determined using our well characterized migration-triggering model system, as previously described (4Volkov Y. Long A. Kelleher D. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6487-6495PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 6- or 96-well tissue culture plates (flat bottom; Nunc™), depending on the particular assay type, were precoated with goat anti-mouse IgG or mouse anti-human Fc and subsequently incubated with cross-linking monoclonal motility-inducing anti-LFA-1 antibody or human rICAM-1. As a control (resting cells), wells were coated with poly-l-lysine (cells adhered to this surface without activation). Hut78 cells were loaded into the coated wells (60 × 104 cells/well in a 6-well plate or 1.0 × 104 cells/well in a 96-well plate) and incubated in 5% CO2 at 37 °C for the indicated time periods, depending on the particular experiments. Deformation Index (DI)—In order to quantify migratory phenotype of T-cells, DI was calculated as described previously (3Fanning A. Volkov Y. Freely M. Kelleher D. Long A. Int. Immunol. 2005; 17: 449-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). DI provides a stronger measure of the degree of cell polarization in comparison with elongation index and circularity alone and therefore more accurately reflects the phenotype of polarized locomotory cells. Typically, values of 1-3 are assigned to cells that were nonmigratory (i.e. cell shape nearing circular). Those cells that display a polarized phenotype (cell body and trailing uropod) and therefore a higher degree of deformation will have higher DI values (>5) (17Luduena R.F. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1998; 178: 207-275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On average, >40 randomly chosen cells were scored for each set of conditions. Semiautomated analysis was performed using the Scion Image software (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD). Cell Lysis, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting—The cell lysis was performed as described previously (34Verma N.K. Dempsey E. Conroy J. Olwell P. McElligott A.M. Davies A.M. Kelleher D. Butini S. Campiani G. Williams D.C. Zisterer D.M. Lawler M. Volkov Y. J. Mol. Med. 2008; 86: 457-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The protein content of the cell lysates was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Equal amounts of precleared lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies to STAT3, α-tubulin, or stathmin, as described previously (35Verma N.K. Dey C.S. Diabetologia. 2006; 49: 1656-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The cell lysates or immunoprecipitated samples were boiled with Laemmli sample buffer for 5 min and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes by semidry blotting for 1 h. The polyvinylidene fluoride membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in PBST (0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, the blots were incubated with the indicated primary antibodies (diluted according to the manufacturer's instructions) overnight at 4 °C with gentle rocking. After three washes in PBST, the membranes were incubated with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. The immunoreactive bands were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences) and subsequent exposure to Kodak light-sensitive film. STAT Activation Assay Using High Content Analysis (HCA)—Serum-starved Hut78 cells (10,000 cells/well in 100 μl of medium) were seeded into 96-well tissue culture plates precoated with anti-LFA-1, ICAM-1, or poly-l-lysine. Cells were incubated for different time periods, depending on particular experiments, fixed, and stained with the Cellomics® HCS reagent kit for STAT activation as per the manufacturer's instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). Plates were scanned (three randomly selected fields/well containing at least 300 cells) using an automated microscope (IN Cell Analyzer 1000 HCA platform; GE Healthcare). Images were acquired using a ×20 objective. STAT activation was measured and analyzed by IN Cell Investigator software using nuclear trafficking analysis module (GE Healthcare) that quantifies nuclear to cytoplasmic fluorescence intensity. Peptide Synthesis—Peptides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems (model 433A) peptide synthesizer (Foster City, CA) following standard Fmoc amino acid chemistry (36Fields G.B. Noble R.L. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1990; 35: 161-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2333) Google Scholar), using O-(benzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium hexa-fluorophosphate 1-hydroxybenzotriazole diisopropylethylamine as coupling reagents. All Fmoc-protected amino acids and coupling reagents were purchased from Novabiochem (Darmstadt, Germany) except for Fmoc-protected phosphotyrosine derivative, which was from Bachem (Bachem Distribution Services GmbH, Weil am Rhein, Germany), with phosphate diprotected by (methyldiphenylsilyl)ethyl moiety (37Chao H.G. Bernatowicz M.S. Reiss P.D. Matsueda G.R. J. Org. Chem. 1994; 59: 6687-6691Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Peptides were cleaved from the polymer support and freed from side chain protections in trifluoroacetic acid/triisopropylsilane/water (95/2.5/2.5 in volume) for 4 h. After removing the resin polymer, the peptides were precipitated in cold ether and purified by semipreparative reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography on a C18 column (5 μm, 10 × 250 mm; Vydac). The molecular weights of peptides were confirmed by mass spectrometry (electrospray ionization m/z M + H+: 2246.4 for Antennapedia peptide (Antp) and 4186.2 for STAT3-inhibitory peptide (pY-pept)). Immunofluorescent Staining and Microscopy—Immunostaining was performed as previously described (4Volkov Y. Long A. Kelleher D. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6487-6495PubMed Google Scholar). Conventional phase-contrast microscopy was performed on a Nikon TE3000 inverted microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a Leica DC 100 digital camera. Fluorescence microscopy was performed by a Zeiss confocal work station attached to a Zeiss LSM 510 laser module using a ×63 objective (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). Images were acquired and processed using Zeiss LSM 510 (release 4.0) software (Carl Zeiss). At least 20 different microscopic fields were observed for each sample. Semiautomated analysis for MT fiber length was performed using the Zeiss LSM Image Examiner software (Carl Zeiss). Cell Viability Assay—Cell viability was measured by Cell-Titer 96® AQueous One Solution cell proliferation assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI). Hut78 cells were distributed in 96-well microplates (1.5 × 104 cells/well) in 100 μl of medium and pretreated with the indicated inhibitors. Cells were then incubated with 20 μl of MTS tetrazolium solution (provided by the manufacturer) for an additional 4 h. The relative cell viability was calculated by determining the absorbance at 490 nm using a microplate reader (Tecan, Mannedorf, Switzerland). Cell Adhesion Assay—The cell adhesion assay was performed as described previously (38Aoudjit F. Vuori K. Blood. 2000; 95: 2044-2051Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, untreated or pretreated Hut78 cells (1.5 × 104 cells in 100 μl of medium) were added to the wells of an anti-LFA-1-coated 96-well microtiter plate (as described above). The cells were then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Nonadherent cells were removed by gentle washing three times with PBS and fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde, 0.5% sucrose in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. After two washes with PBS, the cells were stained with 0.5% crystal violet in 20% methanol plus PBS for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were then washed five times with PBS, and the cell-bound stain was resolubilized in methanol. Cell adhesion was quantified by measuring the absorbance at 590 nm using a microplate reader (Tecan). Densitometric Analysis—Densitometric analyses of the Western blots were performed as described previously (34Verma N.K. Dempsey E. Conroy J. Olwell P. McElligott A.M. Davies A.M. Kelleher D. Butini S. Campiani G. Williams D.C. Zisterer D.M. Lawler M. Volkov Y. J. Mol. Med. 2008; 86: 457-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) using Gene-Tools software (Syngene, Cambridge, UK). The relative values of the samples were determined by giving an arbitrary value of 1.0 to the respective control samples of each experiment. Statistical Analysis—The data are expressed as mean ± S.E. For comparison of two groups, p values were calculated by a two-tailed unpaired Student's t test. In all cases, p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. T-cell Motility Induced by LFA-1 Cross-linking Involves Activation of STAT3—In resting Hut78 cells, STAT3 was present mainly in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1A). Following LFA-1 cross-linking via immobilized anti-LFA-1, cytoplasmic STAT3 translocated into the nucleus within 10 min (Fig. 1A). Quantitation of STAT3 nuclear translocation showed an up to 42.8% increase in 10 min (Fig. 1A). This increase in STAT3 nuclear translocation was transitory, returning to basal level after 30 min (Fig. 1A). A similar STAT3 activation profile was observed when cells were incubated on immobilized ICAM-1 (Fig. 1A). No significant change in the activation of other STAT isoforms STAT1 or STAT2 was observed following LFA-1 cross-linking either via immobilized anti-LFA-1 or ICAM-1 to the Hut78 cells (supplemental Fig. 1). Next, we sought to determine whether LFA-1 signaling induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 in Hut78 cells. Following LFA-1 cross-linking in Hut78 cells via immobilized anti-LFA-1 or ICAM-1, a greater than 7-fold increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 (Tyr705) was observed in 10 min, declining toward base line level after 30 min (Fig. 1B). In contrast, T-cell receptor (TCR) activation by anti-CD3-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 showed a distinctly different activation pattern detected at 10 min that remained constant for up to 4 h (Fig. 1B). However, CD3 ligation via immobilized anti-CD3 did not induce migration of Hut78 cells up to 4 h (data not shown). Therefore, for further experiments on migrating T-cells, LFA-1 cross-linking of Hut78 cells was employed. No change in the expression of STAT3 protein was observed during these time periods (Fig. 1B). Together, these results demonstrate that signaling through LFA-1 in Hut78 cells induces changes associated with STAT3 functional activation, including nuclear translocation and tyrosine phosphorylation. Suppression of STAT3 Activity Attenuates LFA-1-induced T-Cell Polarization and Migration—Hut78 cells triggered via LFA-1 receptor/ligand interaction rapidly polarize and develop a locomotion-associated phenotype (4Volkov Y. Long A. Kelleher D. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6487-6495PubMed Google Scholar, 8Volkov Y. Long A. McGrath S. Eidhin D.N. Kelleher D. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 508-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). To further investigate the role of STAT3, selective inhibitory strategies were utilized. Initially, we used AG490, a Janus kinase-specific inhibitor that subsequently reduces STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation. Hut78 cells were pretreated with different concentrations of AG490 ranging from 1 to 10 μm for 1 h and incubated on anti-LFA-1-coated 96-well plates for 4 h (Fig. 2A). Pretreatment of Hut78 cells with AG490 resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of the LFA-1-induced locomotion-associated phenotype (Fig. 2A). Quantitation of the observed inhibitory effect of AG490 on motile phenotype of Hut78 cells demonstrated that DI reduced from 7.9 in controls cells to 1.8 when cells were treated with 10 μm AG490 (Fig. 2A). Pretreatment of Hut78 cells with 10 μm AG490 also inhibited LFA-1-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 (Fig. 2B). AG490 treatment had no significant affect on Hut78 cell survival (supplemental Fig. 2A) or adhesion to anti-LFA-1-coated plates (supplemental Fig. 2B). We extended these studies using cell-permeable isoform-specific inhibitory peptide specifically targeted against STAT3. This 12-mer phosphopeptide (AYRNRpYRRQYRY, where pY represents phosphotyrosine), identified through combinatorial chemistry (39Wiederkehr-Adam M. Ernst P. Muller K. Bieck E. Gombert F.O. Ottl J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 16117-16128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), binds with high affinity and specificity to STAT3 in a BiaCore competition assay. This peptide was conjugated, with a spacer 6-aminohexanoic, to a cell-permeable peptide sequence called penetratine or Antennapedia (RQIKIWFQNRRMKWKK), a vector that has been shown to be highly efficient for delivering bioactive molecules (40Derossi D. Joliot A.H. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10444-10450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Dunican D.J. Doherty P. Biopolymers. 2001; 60: 45-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Antp alone was used as a control peptide. Hut78 cells were pretreated with a range of concentrations of pY-pept for varying times, ranging from 1 to 12 h. Pretreatment of cells with pY-pept inhibited LFA-1-induced cell migration in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). Complete loss of locomotion-associated phenotype was observed at 25 μg/ml concentration of pY-pept treated for at least 4 h (Fig. 3A). Control untreated cells or cells treated with nonspecific peptide Antp displayed a polarized and elongated morphology when triggered via LFA-1 with DI 8.1 or 7.8, respectively, whereas cells treated with 25 μg/ml pY-pept for 4 h were almost round with DI 1.78 (Fig. 3B). However, the attachment of cells and formation of associated filopodia remained intact in these cells (data not shown). Pretreatment of Hut78 cells with pY-pept treatment had no significant effect on cell survival (supplemental Fig. 3A) or adhesion to anti-LFA-1-coated plates (supplemental Fig. 3B). Therefore, for further experimentations, short pretreatment of the cells for 4 h with a25 μg/ml concentration of pY-pept was employed. Hut78 cells pretreated with pY-pept did not show LFA-1-induced STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 3C). The use of small interfering RNA-mediated approaches was constrained by the capacity of STAT-3-specific small interfering RNA to induce apoptosis in transfected cells. 4N. K. Verma, J. Dourlat, A. M.

We previously demonstrated that the C-terminal 37 amino acids of lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) robustly promoted Aβ generation independent of FE65 and specifically interacted with Ran-binding protein 9 (RanBP9). In this study we found that RanBP9 strongly increased BACE1 cleavage of APP and Aβ generation. This pro-amyloidogenic activity of RanBP9 did not depend on the KPI domain or the Swedish APP mutation. In cells expressing wild type APP, RanBP9 reduced cell surface APP and accelerated APP internalization, consistent with enhanced β-secretase processing in the endocytic pathway. The N-terminal half of RanBP9 containing SPRY-LisH domains not only interacted with LRP but also with APP and BACE1. Overexpression of RanBP9 resulted in the enhancement of APP interactions with LRP and BACE1 and increased lipid raft association of APP. Importantly, knockdown of endogenous RanBP9 significantly reduced Aβ generation in Chinese hamster ovary cells and in primary neurons, demonstrating its physiological role in BACE1 cleavage of APP. These findings not only implicate RanBP9 as a novel and potent regulator of APP processing but also as a potential therapeutic target for Alzheimer disease.

The vast majority of APP is constitutively cleaved in the middle of the Aβ sequence by α-secretase (ADAM10/TACE/ADAM17) in the non-amyloidogenic pathway, thereby abrogating the generation of an intact Aβ peptide. Alternatively, a small proportion of APP is cleaved in the amyloidogenic pathway, leading to the secretion of Aβ peptides (37–42 amino acids) via two proteolytic enzymes, β- and γ-secretase, known as BACE1 and presenilin, respectively (1De Strooper B. Annaert W. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1857-1870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The proteolytic processing of APP to generate Aβ requires the trafficking of APP such that APP and BACE1 are brought together in close proximity for β-secretase cleavage to occur. We and others have shown that the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP), a multifunctional endocytosis receptor (2Herz J. Strickland D.K. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 779-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar), binds to APP and alters its trafficking to promote Aβ generation. The loss of LRP substantially reduces Aβ release, a phenotype that is reversed when full-length (LRP-FL) or truncated LRP is transfected in LRP-deficient cells (3Pietrzik C.U. Busse T. Merriam D.E. Weggen S. Koo E.H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5691-5700Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 4Ulery P.G. Beers J. Mikhailenko I. Tanzi R.E. Rebeck G.W. Hyman B.T. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7410-7415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Specifically, LRP-CT lacking the extracellular ligand binding regions but containing the transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic tail is capable of rescuing amyloidogenic processing of APP and Aβ release in LRP deficient cells (3Pietrzik C.U. Busse T. Merriam D.E. Weggen S. Koo E.H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5691-5700Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Moreover, the LRP soluble tail (LRP-ST) lacking the transmembrane domain and only containing the cytoplasmic tail of LRP is sufficient to enhance Aβ secretion (5Yoon I.S. Pietrzik C.U. Kang D.E. Koo E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20140-20147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This activity of LRP-ST is achieved by promoting APP/BACE1 interaction (6Yoon I.S. Chen E. Busse T. Repetto E. Lakshmana M.K. Koo E.H. Kang D.E. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 2742-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), although the precise mechanism is unknown. Although we had hypothesized that one or more NPXY domains in LRP-ST might underlie the pro-amyloidogenic processing of APP, we recently found that the 37 C-terminal residues of LRP (LRP-C37) lacking the NPXY motif was sufficient to robustly promote Aβ production independent of FE65 (7Lakshmana M.K. Chen E. Yoon I.S. Kang D.E. J. Cell Mol. Med. 2008; 12: 2665-2674Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Because LRP-C37 likely acts by recruiting other proteins, we used the LRP-C37 region as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen, resulting in the identification of 4 new LRP-binding proteins (7Lakshmana M.K. Chen E. Yoon I.S. Kang D.E. J. Cell Mol. Med. 2008; 12: 2665-2674Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Among these, we focused on Ran-binding protein 9 (RanBP9) in this study, which we found to play a critical role in the trafficking and processing of APP. RanBP9, also known as RanBPM, acts as a multi-modular scaffolding protein, bridging interactions between the cytoplasmic domains of a variety of membrane receptors and intracellular signaling targets. These include Axl and Sky (8Hafizi S. Gustafsson A. Stenhoff J. Dahlback B. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2005; 37: 2344-2356Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), MET receptor protein-tyrosine kinase (9Wang D. Li Z. Messing E.M. Wu G. J. Biol.

Pardi R. Bianchi E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13027-13034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Similarly, RanBP9 interacts with Plexin-A receptors to strongly inhibit axonal outgrowth (11Togashi H. Schmidt E.F. Strittmatter S.M. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 4961-4969Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and functions to regulate cell morphology and adhesion (12Dansereau D.A. Lasko P. J.

DNA Constructs—The HA-tagged LRP-L4 mini-receptor variants were subcloned into the retroviral vector pLHCX (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). LRP-L4 mini-receptor (pLNCX-LRP-L4) was a kind gift from Dr. Marilyn Farquhar. HA-LRP-L4-ΔC37 lacking the last 37 residues of LRP was generated by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). pcDNA-P3X-FLAG-RanBP9 construct was a kind gift from Dr. Shim S-K (Yale University School of Medicine). The deletion mutants of FLAG-tagged RanBP9, Δ1 (expressing amino acids 1–392), Δ2 (expressing 408–729), Δ3 (expressing 1–107), and Δ4 (expressing 1–254) were generated by restriction digestion followed by filling with Pfu polymerase and re-ligation in pcDNA-P3X-FLAG vector. All of these cDNAs were sequenced and transferred by restriction digest to the pLHCX vector (Clontech) for retrovirus production. Chemicals and Antibodies—The polyclonal antibody 1704 recognizes the cytoplasmic domain of human LRP. The polyclonal antibody CT15 (against C-terminal 15 residues of APP) and B279 (against BACE1) and the monoclonal antibodies 1G7 (against APP ectodomain), 26D6 (against 1–16 of Aβ), and Ab9 (against 1–16 of Aβ) have been described previously (5Yoon I.S.

Koo E.H. Kang D.E. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 2742-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies 9E10 (against Myc; Calbiochem), Ab-1 (against the β-tubulin; Calbiochem) M2 (anti-FLAG; Sigma), flotillin-1 (against flotillin-1; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 82E1 (against N terminus of Aβ; IBL, Japan), 6E10 (against 1–17 of Aβ; Covance Research), anti-biotin (Jackson ImmunoResearch), anti-sAPPβ (IBL-America), and anti-Swe-sAPPβ (clone 6A1, IBL-America) were purchased from the indicated vendors. All secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch laboratories (West Grove, PA). Anti-RanBP9 monoclonal antibody was produced by immunizing mice with a peptide corresponding to 146–729 amino acids of RanBP9 (10Denti S. Sirri A. Cheli A. Rogge L. Innamorati G. Putignano S. Fabbri M. Pardi R. Bianchi E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13027-13034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). All antibodies were diluted in 5% fat-free milk in Tris-buffered saline-Tween buffer. Hygromycin B and Geneticin were purchased from Invitrogen, EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin was from Pierce, and anti-mouse IgG and anti-rabbit IgG-agarose beads were from American Qualex International. Cell Cultures and Generation of Stable Cell Lines—Chinese hamster ovary (CHO), human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T, and Neuro-2a (N2a) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. CHO-APP751, CHO-APP695, N2a-APP751, and N2a-Swe-APP695 cells stably expressing FLAG-RanBP9 variants were generated by retroviral transduction as previously described (6Yoon I.S. Chen E. Busse T. Repetto E. Lakshmana M.K. Koo E.H. Kang D.E. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 2742-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, 293HP cells were transiently co-transfected with vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein and pLHCX-RanBP9 variant constructs, and conditioned medium collected over a 48-h period was used to transduce the cells and selected with 500 μg/ml hygromycin. Stable cells were then maintained with 100 μg/ml hygromycin B. Cell/Tissue Extraction and Lipid Raft Fractionation—Cells were lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% sodium azide, 400 nm microcystin-LR, 0.5 mm sodium vanadate, and 1% Nonidet P-40 with complete protease inhibitor mix (Sigma). Mouse brain homogenates were prepared from cortical tissue using a lysis buffer similar to that used for HEK293T cells except that Nonidet P-40 was replaced with 2% CHAPS, and the samples were sonicated on ice with 15–20 strokes. Antigens were detected by their corresponding primary and secondary antibodies followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Lipid raft fractionations were carried out as previously described (6Yoon I.S. Chen E. Busse T. Repetto E. Lakshmana M.K. Koo E.H. Kang D.E. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 2742-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Surface Biotinylation and Biotin Internalization Assays—For surface biotinylations, confluent cells in 6-well plates were washed 3 times in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and treated with 2.0 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin in PBS, pH 8.0, under gentle shaking for 1 h on ice. The cells were then washed 3 times in PBS and lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Biotinylated proteins were isolated by pulldown with anti-biotin antibody together with anti-mouse-agarose beads. Biotin internalization assay was performed using previously described methods (15Graeve L. Drickamer K. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2809-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown on 6-well plate dishes and incubated twice for 20 min at 4 °C with 2 mg/ml non-membrane-permeating, cleavable biotin derivative sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(biotinamido)ethyl-1,3′-dithiopropionate (Pierce). Cells were then washed with cold PBS containing 0.1 m glycine followed by several washes with cold PBS. Cells were incubated with culture medium for 0, 5, 10, or 20 min at 37 °C to allow internalization of the labeled proteins. Internalization was stopped by rapid cooling on ice. To cleave biotin exposed at the cell surface, cells were incubated three times for 20 min at 4 °C with 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanesulfonic acid (Sigma) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.7, 100 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mm CaCl2. After thorough rinsing with PBS containing 20 mm Hepes, cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 buffer, and internalized biotinylated proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-biotin antibody and subjected to immunoblotting for APP (CT15). Primary Neuron Cultures—To prepare hippocampal primary neuronal cultures, hippocampi from both the hemispheres were separated and freed from meninges under a dissection microscope from newborn (P0) pups of APP transgenic mice, carrying both Swedish APP and presenilin-1 mutations (APPSwe, PSENdE9, 85 DboJ mice) (16Jankowsky J.L. Fadale D.J. Anderson J. Xu G.M. Gonzales V. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Lee M.K. Younkin L.H. Wagner S.L. Younkin S.G. Borchelt D.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar). The hippocampi were washed 3× with Ca2+/Mg2+-free Hanks' balanced salt solution containing penicillin/streptomycin. The tissues were dissociated in 0.27% trypsin (in 10% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Hanks' balanced salt solution) by incubating at 37 °C for 30 min. Neurons were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 10% Ham's F-12 medium (with penicillin/streptomycin). The neurons were further dissociated by triturating 20 times with a Pasteur pipette and passed through a cell strainer. After centrifugation, the neurons were resuspended in neurobasal medium containing 2% B-27 supplement, glutamine, pyruvate, and penicillin/streptomycin (50 units/ml penicillin, 50 νg/ml streptomycin) and plated on to a 24-well plate coated with 30 μg/ml poly-d-lysine in borate buffer (0.15 m, pH 8.4). A quarter of the growth medium was changed every 3 days. Transient Transfections—Experiments involving transient transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen). Equal amounts of empty vectors were included to keep the overall DNA quantity constant for all the experimental groups. A 19-nucleotide siRNA duplex targeting RanBP9, 5′-tcttatcaacaatacctgc-3′, corresponding to human RanBP9 cDNA positions 868–886 relative to the first nucleotide of the start codon and scrambled control siRNA were synthesized and supplied in a 2′-deprotected, annealed, and desalted format from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). Either RanBP9-specific or single strand sense control siRNAs were transiently transfected at 50–100 nm final concentrations using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Hippocampal neurons were grown for 7–10 days until a robust network of processes formed before transfections, and the neurons were similarly transfected with siRNA as previously described (17Dalby B. Cates S. Harris A. Ohki E.C. Tilkins M.L. Price P.J. Ciccarone V.C. Methods. 2004; 33: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 18Tonges L. Lingor P. Egle R. Dietz G.P. Fahr A. Bahr M. RNA. 2006; 12: 1431-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). After 24 h of the first transfection (17Dalby B. Cates S. Harris A. Ohki E.C. Tilkins M.L. Price P.J. Ciccarone V.C. Methods. 2004; 33: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 18Tonges L. Lingor P. Egle R. Dietz G.P. Fahr A. Bahr M. RNA. 2006; 12: 1431-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), a second transfection was performed to enhance the knock-down effect of the siRNA. Twenty-four hours after the second transfection, conditioned media were collected for sAPPβ and Aβ detection. Aβ40 Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—Conditioned media were recovered, and debris was removed by centrifugation. Aβ in the conditioned medium was detected by sandwich ELISA. Aβ standards (Bachem) were dissolved in hexafluoroisopropanol at 1 mg/ml, sonicated, dried by blowing under nitrogen, resuspended at 2 mg/ml, sonicated, and dried under nitrogen. The dried Aβ was resuspended in DMSO, separated into aliquots, and frozen at –80 °C. Standards were loaded in duplicate at concentrations of 0, 12.5, 25, 50, 100, and 200 pmol/liter. Control media was also added to two wells in duplicate. Aβ was captured in the conditioned media with Ab9 antibody (epitope Aβ-(1–16)) coated at 10–50 μg/ml. The wells were then blocked overnight at 4 °C with blocking buffer (1% Block Ace, 0.05% NaN3 in PBS, pH 7.4). After washing with PBS, the conditioned media containing soluble Aβ was loaded in duplicates at 100 μl/well without further dilution and incubated for 24 h at 4 °C. Aβ40 was detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated Ab13.1.1 (anti-Aβ35–40) antibody (1:1000 dilution of 1 mg/ml stock). Resulting antibody-bound Aβ was detected using 1:1 mixture of the tetramethyl benzidine developing solution (substrate + peroxide). Specificity of this ELISA for Aβ40 detection was tested using synthetic human Aβ (Bachem). Statistical Analysis—All data were analyzed by Instat3 software using either Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance followed by a Kruskal-Wallis post hoc test. Data were expressed as the mean ± S.E. Differences were deemed significant at p < 0.05. The C37 Region of LRP Binds to RanBP9 and Stabilizes the RanBP9·APP Complex—We previously showed that the C-terminal 37 amino acids of LRP tail (LRP-C37 sequence) interacted specifically with RanBP9 in the yeast 2-hybrid assay (7Lakshmana M.K. Chen E. Yoon I.S. Kang D.E. J. Cell Mol. Med. 2008; 12: 2665-2674Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined whether RanBP9/LRP interaction could be confirmed in mammalian cells. HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with a combination of FLAG-tagged RanBP9, LRP-L4 mini-receptor containing the fourth ligand binding domain, and APP751, and immunoprecipitations were carried out with anti-FLAG (M2) antibody. Western blots were carried out using CT15 for the detection of APP, 1704 for the detection of LRP, and M2 for the detection of FLAG-RanBP9. As expected, LRP was specifically detected in FLAG-RanBP9 (M2) immune complexes. Surprisingly, RanBP9 immune complexes also contained APP, which was robustly enhanced by co-expression of LRP-L4 (Fig. 1A). However, overexpression of LRP-L4 lacking the C37 region (ΔC37) failed to enhance the interaction between APP and RanBP9, indicating that LRP through its C37 domain stabilizes/promotes the APP·RanBP9 complex (Fig. 1A). In contrast, overexpression of APP did not further increase the amount of the RanBP9·LRP-L4 complex, indicating that LRP/RanBP9 interaction is not influenced by APP (Fig. 1A). Although the 1704 antibody against the C terminus of LRP does not detect ΔC37 (Fig. 1A), comparable levels of LRP-L4 and LRP-L4-ΔC37 expression were seen by HA antibody that detects both proteins (not shown). These data indicate that the C37 region of LRP functions to stabilize the interaction between RanBP9 and APP and suggest that LRP-ST and/or soluble LRP-C37 acts on APP trafficking and processing possibly by recruiting RanBP9 to APP-containing complexes. Endogenous RanBP9 Interacts with LRP and APP in Brain—To determine whether endogenous RanBP9 normally interacts with LRP and APP in vivo, we next evaluated wild type mouse brains for these interactions. Mouse brain homogenates were prepared in 1% CHAPS buffer and immunoprecipitated with various APP and LRP antibodies. RanBP9 protein was detected by anti-RanBP9 monoclonal antibody (10Denti S. Sirri A. Cheli A. Rogge L. Innamorati G. Putignano S. Fabbri M. Pardi R. Bianchi E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13027-13034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, three APP antibodies used, 4G8, CT15, and 1G7, pulled down the endogenous RanBP9 protein. Similarly, three LRP antibodies used, 1704, 11H4, and 5A6, pulled down RanBP9 (Fig. 1B). In contrast, anti-FLAG antibody and normal rabbit serum used as negative controls failed to pull down any detectable RanBP9 (Fig. 1B). The amount of APP and LRP pulldown was similar from antibody to antibody and corresponded to similar amounts of RanBP9 pulldown. Taken together, this co-immunoprecipitation experiment from wild type mouse brain demonstrates that endogenous APP and LRP form complexes with endogenous RanBP9 in vivo. RanBP9 Overexpression Robustly Increases BACE1 Processing of APP and Aβ Generation—Given that RanBP9 interacted specifically with both LRP and APP, we next tested the effects of RanBP9 overexpression on APP processing and Aβ production. In transiently transfected HEK293T cells, RanBP9 markedly enhanced the levels of Aβ in the conditioned medium (supplemental Fig. S1), similar to that seen with the soluble LRP-C37 polypeptide (7Lakshmana M.K. Chen E. Yoon I.S. Kang D.E. J. Cell Mol. Med. 2008; 12: 2665-2674Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To confirm these results in a different cellular system, we stably transfected FLAG-RanBP9 in CHO cells stably expressing APP751 (CHO-APP751). In these cells N-terminal-tagged FLAG-RanBP9 migrating at ∼90 kDa was readily detected by the M2 anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 2A). Stable overexpression of RanBP9 robustly elevated Aβ secretion into the conditioned medium of CHO-APP751 cells without changing the level of APP holoprotein (Fig. 2, A and B). Quantitation from multiple experiments (n = 6) showed that RanBP9-overexpressing CHO-APP751 cells secreted ∼3.5 times more Aβ than parental CHO-APP751 control cells (Fig. 2B). Examination of the conditioned medium for sAPP demonstrated that RanBP9 markedly increased the secretion of sAPP-β and reduced sAPP-α without changing sAPP total (Fig. 2, A and C). Thus, the ratio of sAPP-α relative to sAPP total was reduced by an average of ∼60% by RanBP9 (Fig. 2C). Surprisingly, overexpression of RanBP9 also led to a ∼66% reduction in the steady state level of APP C-terminal fragments (CTFs) in CHO cells (Fig. 2A), suggesting a direct or indirect effect on APP-CTF turnover by γ-secretase or degradative processing. Despite the reduction in total APP-CTFs by RanBP9, APP-CTF-β remained relatively unchanged, thereby increasing the APP-CTF-β/APP-CTF total ratio by 3-fold (Fig. 2D). Taken together, these data support the notion that RanBP9 preferentially promotes β-secretase processing of APP at the expense of α-secretase cleavage in CHO-APP751 cells. As LRP is capable of physically associating with both the cytoplasmic tail and KPI domains of APP, we next tested whether the effects of RanBP9 in promoting β-secretase processing of APP was unique to APP751, which contains the KPI domain, or also seen in APP695, which lacks the KPI domain. Thus, we stably transfected CHO cells expressing APP695 with RanBP9 and measured the amount of sAPP total, sAPP-β, and Aβ in the conditioned medium. As seen in CHO-APP751 cells, we found a similar robust increase in secretion of sAPP-β and Aβ without significantly altering the total amounts of cellular or secreted APP (Fig. 2E). Thus, the ability of RanBP9 to stimulate APP β-secretase processing appears to be largely independent of the KPI/LRP interaction. Unlike wild type APP that requires endocytosis for efficient β-secretase cleavage (19Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. J. Biol.

To determine whether RanBP9 can also enhance β-secretase processing of Swedish APP, we stably transfected N2a cells expressing Swedish APP695 with FLAG-RanBP9. Using an antibody against the β-secretase cleavage site of Swedish sAPP (6A1), we found that RanBP9 indeed robustly increased sAPPβ secretion by ∼3-fold without altering the level of cellular APP (Supplemental Fig. S2). Thus, these data taken together demonstrate that RanBP9 promotes β-secretase activity in both non-neuronal and neuronal cells from wild type and Swedish APP. RanBP9 Overexpression Reduces Cell Surface APP and Accelerates APP Internalization—Our observation that RanBP9 robustly enhanced BACE1 cleavage of both wild type and Swedish APP suggested that RanBP9 could exert its pro-amyloidogenic activity in both secretory and endocytic processing pathways. To determine whether RanBP9 affects the endocytosis of APP, we first measured the level of APP on the cell surface. The cell surface of CHO-APP751 and CHO-APP751-FLAG-RanBP9 cells were biotinylated on ice, and lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitations with anti-biotin antibody to pull down biotinylated surface proteins. As expected, fully mature and slower migrating APP was preferentially biotinylated on the surface (Fig. 3A). Relative to total APP in cell lysates, RanBP9 overexpression significantly reduced the level of surface APP by 52% compared with parental control cells (Fig. 3B; p = 0.0028, t = 3.94, df = 10). The decrease in surface APP can result from accelerated internalization of APP, an event thought to be critical for Aβ generation from wild type APP (19Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17386-17389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Perez R.G. Soriano S. Hayes J.D. Ostaszewski B. Xia W. Selkoe D.J. Chen X. Stokin G.B. Koo E.H. J. Biol.

Thus, increased APP endocytosis could explain the increased Aβ production and reduced surface APP by RanBP9. Alternatively, increased β-secretase processing of APP en route to the cell surface (secretory pathway) could result in decreased APP on the cell surface, as precisely seen in the APP Swedish double mutation (21Thinakaran G.

Thus, we measured the internalization of APP in CHO-APP751 and CHO-APP751-RanBP9 cells using biotin internalization assay (15Graeve L. Drickamer K. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2809-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Cells were surface-biotinylated with a cleavable biotin derivative on ice and returned to the 37 °C incubator for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 10 min for internalization to proceed. Then non-internalized surface biotin was completely removed, and lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation for biotin and detection of biotinylated and internalized APP. As shown in Fig. 3C, there was little to no biotinylated APP at time 0, indicating that the removal of surface biotin was complete. As the amount of biotinylated internalized APP began to peak at 5–10 min, we chose the 10-min time period to quantitate APP internalization relative to surface APP (Fig. 3, D and E). Quantitation from multiple internalization experiments revealed that RanBP9 led to a ∼2.3-fold increase in APP internalization relative to the amount of surface APP determined in each ex"

They report that the firing pattern, but not the firing rate, is differentially affected by manipulations of retinal activity. Manipulations of activity in one retina can profoundly affect binocular connections in the visual cortex. Retinal activity is relayed to the cortex by the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN). We compared the qualities and amount of activity in the dLGN following monocular eyelid closure and monocular retinal inactivation in awake mice. Our findings substantially alter the interpretation of previous studies and define the afferent activity patterns that trigger cortical plasticity."

Here we demonstrate that Rsp5 carries a noncovalent ubiquitin-binding site in its catalytic HECT domain.

Modification of proteins with ubiquitin plays an important role in controlling and modulating a number of cellular processes. Ubiquitination is the primary signal used to target cellular proteins for degradation by 26 S proteasomes (1Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6736) Google Scholar) and it is an important nonproteolytic signal in many other biological pathways (2Chen Z.J. Nat.

The ability of ubiquitin to function in a variety of cellular processes can be explained by the existence of structurally distinct ubiquitin modifications and the recognition of ubiquitination signals by a diverse set of ubiquitin-binding domains (UBDs) 3The abbreviations used are: UBDs, ubiquitin-binding domains; E3, ubiquitin ligase; RING, really interesting new gene; E2, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme; HECT, homologous to E6AP C terminus; GST, glutathione S-transferase; aa, amino acid; C-lobe, C-terminal lobe; N-lobe, N-terminal lobe; HA, hemagglutinin; 0K, lysine-less; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; Ub4-Ubn, polyubiquitin chains longer than four subunits in length; Tricine, N-(tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl)glycine; SH3, Src homology domain 3. 3The abbreviations used are: UBDs, ubiquitin-binding domains; E3, ubiquitin ligase; RING, really interesting new gene; E2, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme; HECT, homologous to E6AP C terminus; GST, glutathione S-transferase; aa, amino acid; C-lobe, C-terminal lobe; N-lobe, N-terminal lobe; HA, hemagglutinin; 0K, lysine-less; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; Ub4-Ubn, polyubiquitin chains longer than four subunits in length; Tricine, N-(tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl)glycine; SH3, Src homology domain 3. found within a host of cellular proteins (5Hicke L.

J. 2006; 399: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin is conjugated to proteins by a series of enzymes that act in a well defined, sequential manner (7Pickart C.M. Eddins M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar). The final transfer of ubiquitin to a cellular protein is usually carried out by an E3 ubiquitin ligase. E3s contain the primary determinants for substrate recognition and generally belong to one of two families. Really interesting new gene (RING) E3s are thought to act primarily as molecular scaffolds to bring together a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) charged with ubiquitin and a substrate targeted for ubiquitination (8Zheng N. Wang P. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 2000; 102: 533-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 9Zheng N. Schulman B.A. Song L. Miller J.J. Jeffrey P.D. Wang P.

In contrast, HECT E3s form a covalent thioester intermediate with ubiquitin before transferring ubiquitin to the substrate. A conserved cysteine residue located within the active site of the HECT domain is required for formation of this intermediate (10Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, 11Scheffner M. Nuber U. Huibregtse J.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Different types of ubiquitin modifications adopt distinct structural conformations, and these structural differences are functionally important because they target proteins for different fates in the cell. Protein monoubiquitination is an important regulatory signal in a variety of basic cellular processes, including endocytosis, histone remodeling, and viral budding (12Hicke L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). Polyubiquitin chains act as signals specialized for other cellular functions. For example, chains linked through Lys-48 of ubiquitin play a well characterized role in targeting proteins for degradation by the proteasome, whereas chains linked through Lys-63 of ubiquitin act as nonproteolytic signals in DNA repair, kinase activation, and endocytosis (13Pickart C.M. Fushman D. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2004; 8: 610-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). Despite the known importance of diverse ubiquitination signals, little is known about the mechanisms used by E3 enzymes to ensure that substrates targeted for ubiquitination are modified with the appropriate type of signal. Rps5 is a HECT E3 that controls a broad range of cellular processes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and is part of a large family of proteins that control analogous processes in mammalian cells (14Ingham R.J. Gish G. Pawson T. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1972-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). For example, Rsp5 and its well characterized mammalian homologue, Nedd4, are both required for efficient internalization of cell surface receptors from the plasma membrane (3Hicke L. Dunn R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar, 15Staub O. Rotin D. Physiol. Rev. 2006; 86: 669-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Both E3s also play a role in regulating the stability of RNA polymerase II by targeting the polymerase for ubiquitination and degradation (16Anindya R. Aygun O. Svejstrup J.Q. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 386-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 17Beaudenon S.L. Huacani M.R. Wang G. McDonnell D.P. Huibregtse J.M. Mol. Cell.

Traffic. 2003; 4: 566-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The ability of Rsp5 to act as a multifunctional E3 in yeast is due, at least in part, to its capacity to modify different substrates with distinct mono- and polyubiquitin signals. Several proteins that function in endocytosis are monoubiquitinated in an Rsp5-dependent manner (23Rotin D. Staub O. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Membr.

In contrast, Rsp5 targets a number of cellular proteins for polyubiquitination, including the large subunit of RNA polymerase II, the vacuolar membrane protein Sna3, and the mRNA nuclear export factor Hpr1 (18Huibregtse J.M.

EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2414-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and modifies a number of its substrates with Lys-63-linked chains in vivo (29Galan J.M. Haguenauer-Tsapis R.

In general, however, the mechanisms that control the linkage and length of polyubiquitin chains synthesized by Rsp5 remain poorly defined. Here we identify a previously unknown noncovalent ubiquitin-binding site located in the Rsp5 HECT domain that regulates the length of Lys-63- and Lys-48-linked polyubiquitin chains assembled by the Rsp5 HECT domain. Plasmid Construction and Mutagenesis—Plasmids encoding fragments of Rps5 fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST) were constructed in pGEX vectors (GE Healthcare). The GST (LHP497), GST-3xWW (aa 228–430, LHP703), and GST-HECT C-terminal lobe (C-lobe) (aa 691–809, LHP2468) plasmids were constructed by PCR amplifying the relevant DNA sequence and ligating into the pGEX-6P-2 vector. The GST-HECT domain plasmid (aa 425–809, LHP1434) was generated in a similar fashion but with ligation into the pGEX-4T-3 vector. A plasmid encoding the GST-HECT N-terminal lobe (N-lobe) (aa 425–691, LHP2325) was created by introducing a STOP codon after amino acid 691 in LHP1434 using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The GST-C2 domain plasmid was obtained from Hilary Godwin (University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA). All point mutations in LHP2325 and LHP1434 were introduced by QuikChange mutagenesis and verified by automated sequencing. Plasmids encoding hexahistidine (His6)-tagged ubiquitin (LHP1404), Rvs167 SH3 domain (aa 428–482, LHP1496), and the HECT domain N-lobes from Rsp5 (aa 426–691, LHP2381), Nedd4 (aa 501–767, LHP2443), and Tom1 (aa 2880–3148, LHP2442) were generated by ligation-independent cloning of the relevant PCR-amplified fragment into the pET-30 vector (EMD Chemicals, La Jolla, CA). All point mutations in LHP1404 were introduced by QuikChange mutagenesis. A yeast expression vector carrying untagged wild-type RSP5 under the control of its endogenous promoter was provided by Jon Huibregtse (University of Texas, Austin, TX) and modified to remove a NotI site in the multiple cloning region, generating LHP472. QuikChange mutagenesis was used to introduce the Y516A (LHP2735) and F618A (LHP2737) mutations into this plasmid. Construction of the hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged Rsp5 plasmid (LHP478) has been described previously (32Dunn R. Hicke L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 421-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Multicopy plasmids encoding wild-type (LHP308) or lysine-less (0K) (LHP306) ubiquitin were adapted from plasmids pES7 and pTER62 obtained from Mike Ellison (University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada) by removing the c-myc epitope tag. Yeast Strains and Growth Media—All yeast strains were propagated in synthetic minimal medium (yeast nitrogen base; U. S. Biological, Swampscott, MA) or rich yeast extract peptone dextrose medium (2% bactopeptone, 1% yeast extract, 2% glucose supplemented with 10 mg/liter adenine, uracil, and tryptophan). Yeast transformations were performed using standard techniques (33Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2526) Google Scholar). Strains carrying RSP5 (LHY5653), rsp5Y516A (LHY5655), or rsp5F618A (LHY5657) as the sole source of Rsp5 were constructed by transforming the wild-type or mutant plasmids into LHY4507 (rsp5Δ pGFP-Rsp5[URA3]) and selecting for loss of pGFP-RSP5[URA3] on media containing 5-fluoroorotic acid as described previously (32Dunn R. Hicke L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 421-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin and E2-binding Assays—Binding assays carried out with ubiquitin-agarose beads (Boston Biochem, Cambridge, MA) and lysates from yeast cells expressing HA-tagged Rsp5 were performed as previously described (34Shih S.C. Katzmann D.J. Schnell J.D. Sutanto M. Emr S.D. Hicke L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), except that 7.5 mg of lysate protein was incubated with the beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Recombinant proteins for all other binding experiments were expressed in Escherichia coli (BL21 CodonPlus cells, Stratagene) by inducing cultures with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3–5 h at 18–37 °C. Preparation of bacterial cell lysates has been described previously (34Shih S.C. Katzmann D.J. Schnell J.D. Sutanto M. Emr S.D. Hicke L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Immobilization of His6-tagged proteins on TALON metal affinity resin (Clontech) and GST-tagged proteins on glutathione resin (GE Healthcare) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Binding of bacterially expressed GST-tagged Rsp5 fragments to ubiquitin-agarose or agarose beads was performed by incubating the lysates and beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed four times in phosphate-buffered saline lysis buffer (115 mm NaCl, 16 mm Na2HPO4, 4 mm KH2PO4, 1% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol, pH 7.3), and bound proteins were eluted by boiling in 1× Laemmli sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 500 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, 0.02% bromphenol blue). Binding of bacterially expressed GST-tagged HECT fragments or purified N-lobes to immobilized His6-ubiquitin or His6-Rvs167SH3 was carried out in the same manner, except that the beads were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline lysis buffer containing 10 mm imidazole and twice in phosphate-buffered saline lysis buffer containing 20 mm imidazole. Bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by either immunoblotting with anti-GST antiserum (GE Healthcare) or staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Binding to polyubiquitin chains was assayed by incubating 10 μg of purified Lys-63- or Lys-48-linked chains (Boston Biochem) with immobilized GST, GST-HECT, or GST-N-lobe proteins for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times in phosphate-buffered saline lysis buffer, and bound chains were eluted by boiling in Tris-Tricine sample loading buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 3% SDS, 500 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 0.02% bromphenol blue). Bound chains were resolved by Tris-Tricine gel electrophoresis and analyzed by anti-His immunoblotting (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX). UbcH5a binding assays were carried out in the same manner, except that the beads carrying GST-HECT domain mutants were incubated with 25 nm to 0.1 μm purified UbcH5a (Boston Biochem) and bound proteins were analyzed by anti-UbcH5a immunoblotting (Boston Biochem). Analysis of Protein Expression Levels in Yeast Lysate—Protein expression levels of Rsp5 and free ubiquitin were analyzed as follows: 2 × 108 cells from each strain were harvested before and after shifting cultures to 37 °C for 1 h. Cells were lysed under denaturing conditions in 1 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 N NaOH, 0.5% 2-mercaptoethanol) and then precipitated with 10% trichlororoacetic acid. Protein precipitates were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 1× Laemmli sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with Rsp5 antiserum (25Stamenova S.D. Dunn R. Adler A.S. Hicke L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16017-16025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) or ubiquitin antiserum (Millipore, Temecula, CA). In Vitro Ubiquitination Assays—Yeast E1, UbcH5a, ubiquitin, and all ubiquitin mutants were purchased from Boston Biochem. All GST-HECT proteins were expressed in E. coli (BL21-CodonPlus cells), purified on glutathione resin according to the manufacturer's instructions, and eluted from the resin in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, buffer containing 10 mm glutathione. Recovered proteins were assayed for purity by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining, and protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay. HECT domain autoubiquitination assays were carried out with 0.1 μm yeast E1, 0.2 μm UbcH5a, 0.3 μm GST-HECT, and 75 μm of the indicated ubiquitin. Reactions were initiated by adding buffer containing ATP (final concentrations: 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.1 μm dithiothreitol, 4 mm ATP). After brief mixing, the zero time point was withdrawn and placed on ice, and reactions were immediately transferred to a 30 °C water bath. Reaction aliquots were removed at the indicated times, added to an equal volume of 2× Laemmli sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and anti-GST immunoblotting. The Rsp5 HECT Domain Binds to Ubiquitin—To identify cellular proteins that bind to ubiquitin, a yeast genomic two-hybrid library was screened using ubiquitin as the bait. A fragment of Rsp5 encoding residues 195–809 was identified in this screen. 4M. Sutanto, S. Shih, and L. Hicke, unpublished data. To verify that the full-length Rsp5 protein binds to ubiquitin, we tested the ability of an HA-tagged version of Rsp5 expressed in yeast to bind to ubiquitin-agarose beads. HA-Rsp5 bound to ubiquitin-agarose beads but not to control agarose beads (Fig. 1A), confirming that full-length Rsp5 is a ubiquitin-binding protein. Rsp5 is part of a large family of proteins found throughout eukaryotes that share a common modular domain architecture (14Ingham R.J. Gish G. Pawson T. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1972-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). All family members contain an N-terminal C2 domain, one to four central WW domains, and a large ∼350 amino acid C-terminal HECT domain (Fig. 1B). Rsp5 does not carry any of the numerous UBDs that have been described to date (6Hurley J.H. Lee S. Prag G. Biochem. J. 2006; 399: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 35Messick T.E.

To test which region of the Rsp5 protein is responsible for its ubiquitin-binding activity, we assayed different fragments of Rsp5 for binding to ubiquitin-agarose beads. A GST-HECT domain fusion protein expressed in E. coli bound specifically to the ubiquitin-agarose beads in this assay, whereas fragments of Rsp5 containing the C2 or three WW domains did not (Fig. 1C). These observations indicate that the Rsp5 HECT domain binds directly to monoubiquitin. The Rsp5 and Nedd4 HECT Domain N-lobes Bind to Ubiquitin—The HECT domain is highly structured, with an elongated, α-helical N-terminal lobe (N-lobe) and a smaller, globular C-terminal lobe (C-lobe) (38Huang L. Kinnucan E. Wang G. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Huibregtse J.M. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1999; 286: 1321-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 39Ogunjimi A.A. Briant D.J. Pece-Barbara N.

Cell. 2003; 11: 249-259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The C-lobe contains the conserved cysteine residue that forms a thioester with ubiquitin, whereas the N-lobe interacts with an E2 enzyme to enable the transfer of ubiquitin from the E2 to the HECT active site cysteine. To determine which lobe of the Rsp5 HECT domain is responsible for ubiquitin binding, we expressed the isolated N- and C-lobes (Fig. 2A) in bacteria and tested them for interaction with immobilized His6-tagged ubiquitin. Ubiquitin bound equally well to a GST-N-lobe fusion protein and a GST-HECT domain fusion, but did not bind to the isolated GST-C-lobe fusion (Fig. 2B). The HECT domain N-lobe also bound to polyubiquitin chains linked through either Lys-63 or Lys-48 of ubiquitin, with a preference for binding to longer chains (Ub4-Ubn) over shorter di- and triubiquitin chains (Fig. 2C). From these experiments, we conclude that all Rsp5 ubiquitin-binding activity resides in the N-lobe of its HECT domain. To test if the ability of the N-lobe to bind ubiquitin is a general property of HECT domains, we assayed the N-lobes from the mammalian Nedd4 and yeast Tom1 HECT domains for ubiquitin binding. Nedd4 is both structurally and functionally related to Rsp5, and its HECT domain N-lobe is 55% identical to the Rsp5 N-lobe in sequence. In contrast, Tom1 is unrelated to Rsp5, and its HECT domain N-lobe is only 40% identical to the Rsp5 N-lobe. In a ubiquitin-binding assay carried out with both N-lobes, the Nedd4 N-lobe bound specifically to immobilized His6-tagged ubiquitin, whereas the Tom1 N-lobe did not (Fig. 2D). These observations indicate that the N-lobe ubiquitin-binding site is conserved in the Nedd4 HECT domain, but is not a feature common to all HECT domains. Interaction Surfaces on the Rsp5 HECT Domain N-lobe and Ubiquitin—To map the ubiquitin-binding surface on the Rsp5 HECT domain N-lobe, we used an alanine-scanning mutagenesis approach. Although the three-dimensional structure of the Rsp5 HECT domain has not been determined, modeling of the Rsp5 HECT domain onto the known structure of the closely related WWP1 HECT domain (40Verdecia M.A. Joazeiro C.A. Wells N.J. Ferrer J.L. Bowman M.E. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 249-259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) allowed us to target surface-exposed residues on the Rsp5 N-lobe for mutagenesis. Individual residues and stretches of up to three contiguous residues were mutated to alanine, and the resulting GST-tagged N-lobe mutants were tested for binding to immobilized His6-tagged ubiquitin. Most of the ∼50 mutations we made had no effect on binding to ubiquitin. Three N-lobe mutations (Y516A, F618A, and V621A/V622A) completely abolished ubiquitin binding. An additional three mutations (N513A, Y521A, and R651A) caused a reduction in binding. Finally, one mutation (N534A) reproducibly enhanced binding ∼2–3-fold relative to wild-type (Fig. 3A, data not shown). To test if amino acids required for ubiquitin binding in the Rsp5 N-lobe are also important in the context of the entire HECT domain, we assayed GST-HECT domain mutants carrying the Y516A or F618A mutations for binding to immobilized His6-tagged ubiquitin. As in the N-lobe, these mutations abolished binding of the entire HECT domain to ubiquitin (Fig. 3B). We also constructed an F618Y HECT domain mutant for analysis because this residue is a Phe in the ubiquitin-binding Rsp5 and Nedd4 N-lobes, but is a Tyr in the non-binding Tom1 N-lobe. The F618Y mutation eliminated binding of the Rsp5 HECT domain to ubiquitin (Fig. 3B), indicating that this residue is a crucial component of the HECT domain ubiquitin-binding site. Mapping of the results from the alanine mutagenesis onto the modeled three-dimensional structure of the Rsp5 HECT domain showed that ubiquitin binds to a region on the front surface of the N-lobe that lies ∼15–20 Å from the HECT domain active site cysteine. Importantly, none of the mutations made on the back face of the N-lobe had any effect on binding to ubiquitin, confirming the specificity of the alanine-scanning mutagenesis (Fig. 3C). Further analysis of the predicted ubiquitin-binding site revealed that ubiquitin binds to a region that is adjacent to the putative E2-binding site (38Huang L. Kinnucan E. Wang G. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Huibregtse J.M. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1999; 286: 1321-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). To address the possibility that mutations that inactive the ubiquitin-binding site also affect interactions with an E2, we tested GST-HECT domain mutants carrying the Y516A, F618A, and F618Y mutations for their ability to interact with UbcH5a, a member of the highly homologous Ubc1/Ubc4/Ubc5 subfamily of E2s known to cooperate with Rsp5 in vitro (41Nuber U. Scheffner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7576-7582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). None of the mutations tested had any effect on the ability of the HECT domain to bind to UbcH5a over a series of different E2 concentrations (Fig. 3D), indicating that the Y516A, F618A, and F618Y mutations specifically impair binding to ubiquitin. Most of the previously characterized UBDs bind to a hydrophobic surface patch on ubiquitin surrounding a key isoleucine residue, Ile-44. To test if the Rsp5 HECT domain N-lobe also uses this surface of ubiquitin for binding, we mutated a select number of ubiquitin surface residues to alanine and tested these mutants for their ability to bind to the N-lobe. Mutation of Ile-44 and its neighboring residues, Gly-47, His-68, Arg-42, and Arg-72, abolished binding to the N-lobe, and mutation of two additional residues, Lys-48 and Val-70, caused a reduction in binding. In contrast, mutations in and around K63 of ubiquitin (Y59A, Q62A, and K63A) and in residues encompassing another functionally important surface of ubiquitin (F4A, T14A) (42Sloper-Mould K.E. Jemc J.C. Pickart C.M. Hicke L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30483-30489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) had no effect on binding (Fig. 4, A and B). Thus, like most other UBDs characterized to date, the Rsp5 HECT domain N-lobe binds to the Ile-44 hydrophobic patch of ubiquitin. The Rsp5 Ubiquitin-binding Site Is Important for Rsp5 Activity in Vivo—Rsp5 controls a number of cellular processes in yeast, and many, if not all, of these processes are dependent on the catalytic activity of the ligase. To test if mutations that disrupt the Rsp5 ubiquitin-binding site affect Rsp5 activity in yeast, we constructed yeast strains expressing the Rsp5Y516A or Rsp5F618A mutants as the only source of Rsp5 in the cell. Both of these strains grew normally at 30 °C, but exhibited modest to severe temperature-sensitive growth defects at 37 °C (Fig. 5A). The observed growth defects were not due to altered expression or stability of the Rsp5 proteins because both mutants were expressed and stable, even at the elevated temperature (Fig. 5B). We conclude that the Rsp5 ubiquitin-binding site is important for Rsp5 function in yeast cells. To test if the growth defects of the rs"

Recently, the senescence response to oncogene activation has been shown to act as a bona fide barrier to cancer development in vivo. Multiple previous studies have implicated the importance of the p38 MAPK pathway in oncogene-induced senescence. However, the contribution of each of the four p38 isoforms (encoded by different genes) to senescence induction is unclear. In the current study, we demonstrated that p38α and p38γ, but not p38β, play an essential role in oncogenic ras-induced senescence. Both p38α and p38γ are expressed in primary human fibroblasts and are activated upon transduction of oncogenic ras. Small hairpin RNA-mediated silencing of p38α or p38γ expression abrogated ras-induced senescence, whereas constitutive activation of p38α and p38γ caused premature senescence. Furthermore, upon activation by oncogenic ras, p38γ stimulated the transcriptional activity of p53 by phosphorylating p53 at Ser33, suggesting that the ability of p38γ to mediate senescence is at least partly achieved through p53. However, p38α contributed to ras-inducted senescence via a p53-indepdendent mechanism in cells by mediating ras-induced expression of p16INK4A, another key senescence effector. These findings have identified p38α and p38γ as essential components of the signaling pathway that regulates the tumor-suppressing senescence response, providing insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the differential involvement of the p38 isoforms in senescence induction.

However, in early-passage primary human and rodent cells, activated ras causes a permanent proliferative arrest known as premature senescence, because of its phenotypic similarities to replicative senescence observed in late-passage cells (12.Serrano M.

The existence of the premature senescence response to oncogene activation implies that like apoptosis, oncogene-induced senescence serves as an anti-tumorigenic defense mechanism. Indeed, it has been well documented that cellular transformation by ras requires cooperation from immortalizing oncogenes that overcome the senescence response, such as those inactivating p53 (8.Hahn W.C.

Therefore, the p38 pathway is likely to play an important role in tumor suppression by mediating the senescence response to oncogene activation.Four mammalian isoforms of p38 (α, β, δ, and γ), each encoded by a different gene, have been identified; they differ in tissue-specific expression and affinity for the upstream regulatory MAPK kinases (43.Han J.

Among these isoforms, only p38α has been shown essential for inflammatory and stress responses by genetic analysis in murine models (50.Kang Y.J. Chen J. Otsuka M. Mols J. Ren S. Wang Y. Han J. J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 5075-5082Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), whereas the physiological roles of the other p38 isoforms in inflammation or other cellular functions are still unclear (51.Beardmore V.A.

We have shown previously that SB203580, a chemical compound that inhibits p38α and p38β, prevents ras-induced senescence in primary cells (30.Wang W. Chen J.X. Liao R. Deng Q. Zhou J.J. Huang S. Sun P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3389-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), indicating that p38α/β or both might be required for senescence induction. However, this compound also inhibits the activity of other p38 isoforms and other protein kinases although with lower affinity. The specific involvement of each p38 isoform in senescence has never been investigated. In the current study, we examined the role of the p38 isoforms in oncogenic ras-induced senescence in primary human cells. Our data demonstrate that p38α and p38γ, but not p38β, are essential components of the signaling pathway that mediates ras-induced senescence and that p38α and p38γ contribute to senescence induction through different mechanisms. Whereas p38γ mediates ras-induced senescence at least partly by stimulating the transcriptional activity of p53 through direct phosphorylation, p38α appears to regulate senescence in a p53-independent, p16INK4A-dependent manner.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—BJ human foreskin fibroblasts were maintained in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, non-essential amino acids, glutamine, and antibiotics. WI38 and IMR90 human fibroblasts and LinX-A retroviral packaging cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, glutamine, and antibiotics.Plasmids—The Ha-RasV12 expression vectors were obtained from Dr. Scott Lowe. Retroviral vectors for FLAG-tagged wild type p38 isoforms were constructed by subcloning the respective cDNA into WZLHygro. Retroviral vectors for hemagglutinin-tagged wild type and intrinsically active mutants of p38 isoforms (53.Avitzour M. Diskin R. Raboy B. Askari N. Engelberg D. Livnah O.

Dong P. Dai K. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Science. 1998; 282: 2270-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Transduced cells were purified with 120 μg/ml hygromycin B, 400 μg/ml G418, 5 μg/ml blasticidin, and/or 1.2 μg/ml puromycin.Analysis of Senescence—This was performed in cell cultures by measuring the rate of proliferation and the expression of the senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) senescence marker as described previously (30.Wang W.

Population doublings (PD) were calculated with the formula PD = log(N2/N1)/log2, where N1 is the number of cells seeded and N2 is the number of cells recovered (59.Shay J.W. Wright W.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 184: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). To quantify SA-β-gal positives, at least 200 cells were counted in random fields in each of the duplicated wells. Each experiment was performed in triplicates or duplicates.Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis was performed with lysates prepared 7–10 days after transduction of Ras or MKK3/6E from subconfluent cells as described (30.Wang W.

Primary antibodies were from Covance (HA-11), Sigma (FLAG-M5, FLAG-F7425, and actin), Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Ras C-20, MKK3 C-19, p53 FL-393, p21WAF1 C-19), Cell Signaling (phospho-p38-Thr180/Tyr182, phospho-p53-Ser15 and -Ser33, and phospho-ATF2-Thr71). Antibodies against p38α,-β,-γ, and -δ were generated previously in our laboratory. Signals were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence and captured by using the FluorChem™-8900 imaging system (AlphaInnotech).p53 Reporter Assays—BJ cells were stably transduced with a retroviral luciferase reporter driven by a promoter containing multiple copies of a functional p53-binding sites (PG-Luc) or a mutant p53-binding site (MG-Luc) (57.Deng Q.

These cells were transduced with shRNA for GFP, p38α, or p38γ at PD28–32 and subsequently with Ha-RasV12 or vector at PD30–34. Cells were split into 12-well plates on day 7 or 8 post-ras transduction and lysed on day 8 or 9. Luciferase activity was determined using a luciferase assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions and normalized to protein concentrations as determined by the Bradford assay.

https://openalex.org/W2063780770,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis encodes for 11 eukaryotic-like serine/threonine protein kinases. Genetic and biochemical studies show that these kinases regulate various cellular processes including cell shape and morphology, glucose and glutamine transport, phagosome-lysosome fusion and the expression, and/or activity of transcription factors. PknK is the largest predicted serine/threonine protein kinase in M. tuberculosis. Here, we have cloned, overexpressed, and purified protein kinase K (PknK) to near homogeneity and show that its ability to phosphorylate proteins is dependent on the invariant lysine (Lys(55)), and on two conserved threonine residues present in its activation loop. Despite being devoid of any apparent transmembrane domain, PknK is localized to the cell wall fraction, suggesting probable anchoring of the kinase to the cell membrane region. The pknK gene is located in the vicinity of the virS gene, which is known to regulate the expression of the mycobacterial monooxygenase (mymA) operon. We report here for the first time that VirS is in fact a substrate of PknK. In addition, four of the proteins encoded by mymA operon are also found to be substrates of PknK. Results show that VirS is a bona fide substrate of PknK in vivo, and PknK-mediated phosphorylation of VirS increases its affinity for mym promoter DNA. Reporter assays reveal that PknK modulates VirS-mediated stimulation of transcription from the mym promoter. These findings suggest that the expression of mymA operon genes is regulated through PknK-mediated phosphorylation of VirS."
https://openalex.org/W2008483777,"Although the classical redox functions of co-enzyme NAD+ are firmly established in metabolism, there are numerous enzymes that catalyze cleavage of NAD+ to yield free ADP-ribose (ADPr) or related metabolites, whose functions remain largely unknown. Here we show that the Nudix (nucleoside diphosphate linked to another moiety X) hydrolase Ysa1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a major regulator of cellular ADPr and O-acetyl-ADP-ribose (OAADPr). OAADPr is the direct product of NAD+-dependent protein deacetylases (sirtuins) and is readily converted to ADPr. Ysa1 cleaves ADPr/OAADPr into ribose phosphate/acetyl-ribose phosphate and AMP. In cells lacking Ysa1 (Δysa1), ADPr and OAADPr levels increased ∼50%, with a corresponding decrease in AMP. Strikingly, Δysa1 cells display higher resistance to exogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) and 40% lower basal levels of endogenous ROS, compared with wild type. The biochemical basis for these differences in ROS-related phenotypes was investigated, and the results provide evidence that increased ADPr/OAADPr levels protect cells via the following two pathways: (i) lower ROS production through inhibition of complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, and (ii) generation of higher levels of NADPH to suppress ROS damage. The latter occurs through diverting glucose into the pentose phosphate pathway by ADPr inhibition of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, a central enzyme of glycolysis.

Through a quantitative microinjection assay of starfish oocytes, both ADPr and OAADPr caused a delay/block in oocyte maturation, suggesting ADPr/OAADPr may have specific biological activity (10.Borra M.T.

In mammalian cells, intracellular ADPr/OAADPr can activate the TRPM2 (transient receptor melastatin-related ion channel 2) nonselective cationic channel (11.Kuhn F.J. Luckhoff A. J. Biol.

TRPM2 contains a conserved intracellular Nudix hydrolase domain (referred to as NudT9H) that directly binds ADPr/OAADPr, but it is incapable of cleaving the ligand because a major catalytic residue is missing (11.Kuhn F.J.

Although still disputed, ADPr binding to NudT9H appears to be required for the well known oxidative stress activation of the channel (13.Perraud A.L. Takanishi C.L. Shen B. Kang S. Smith M.K.

Cell stress via puromycin treatment led to TRPM2-mediated cell death that was dependent on sirtuin deacetylases, presumably from the production of OAADPr (12.Grubisha O. Rafty L.A. Takanishi C.L.

Increasing evidence suggests that free ADPr may function as a cellular signal. ADPr can be produced from the coordinate actions of PARPs and poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG), which cleave ADPr polymers to free ADPr (16.Miwa M. Sugimura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 6362-6364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Bonicalzi M.E. Haince J.F. Droit A. Poirier G.G. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 739-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Under massive genotoxic stress, hyper-stimulation of the NAD+-dependent PARPs depletes cellular NAD+, which is linked to catastrophic ATP loss and cell death (18.Berger N. Radiat. Res. 1985; 101: 4-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar, 19.Schreiber V. Dantzer F. Ame J.C. de Murcia G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (1589) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which PARP1 hyperactivity in the nucleus impairs ATP production in mitochondria is unclear. The fact that PARP1 and poly(ADP-ribose) are localized in the nucleus adds a perplexing aspect. However, recent data suggest that PARP1-induced loss of ATP requires PARG (20.Gao H. Coyle D.L. Meyer-Ficca M.L. Meyer R.G. Jacobson E.L. Wang Z.Q. Jacobson M.K. Exp. Cell Res. 2007; 313: 984-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Under conditions of PARP1 hyperactivation, it has been suggested that the PARG-dependent production of ADPr can exit the nucleus and interfere with ATP production in mitochondria (21.Cipriani G. Rapizzi E. Vannacci A. Rizzuto R. Moroni F. Chiarugi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17227-17234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 22.Dumitriu I.E. Voll R.E. Kolowos W.

Thus ADPr could be the molecular signal released from the nucleus of cells undergoing massive poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation and rapidly triggers mitochondrial dysfunction. In support for ADPr/OAADPr as potential signaling molecules, the existence of enzymes capable of metabolizing these compounds suggests that their cellular concentrations may be subject to tight regulation (23.Ono T.

To understand the biological roles played by ADPr/OAADPr, it is essential to elucidate the degradation pathways that can modulate their levels. Previously we described the ability of several conserved members of the Nudix hydrolase family to hydrolyze in vitro the diphosphate linkage in ADPr/OAADPr, generating ribose phosphate or acetyl-ribose phosphate and AMP (10.Borra M.T.

Here we examine the biochemical and cellular functions of the Nudix hydrolase Ysa1 (14.Dunn C.A. O'Handley S.F. Frick D.N. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32318-32324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We determined that Ysa1 is the major ADPr Nudix hydrolase and an important regulator of cellular ADPr/OAADPr levels. A Δysa1 strain displays increased resistance to both exogenously and endogenously generated ROS. Basal level of ROS decreased by 40% in the Ysa1 deletion strain. We provide biochemical evidence that increased ADPr/OAADPr levels protect cells via the following two pathways: (i) lower ROS production through the inhibition of complex I of the electron transport chain, and (ii) generation of higher NADPH levels to suppress ROS damage. The latter occurs by diverting glucose into the pentose phosphate pathway by ADPr inhibition of glycolysis. Yeast Strains—Parental strains BY4741 (MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0), BY4742 (MATα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0), Δysa1 (Δysa1::Kanr), with BY4741 and BY4742 as parental strains, and TAP-Ysa1 strain with BY4742 as parental strain were purchased from Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL). The TAP tag was inserted at the C-terminal end of the coding region of YSA1 gene, consisting of a calmodulin-binding peptide, a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site, and two IgG binding domains of Staphylococcus aureus protein A (25.Ghaemmaghami S. Huh W.K. Bower K. Howson R.W. Belle A. Dephoure N. O'Shea E.K. Weissman J.S. Nature. 2003; 425: 737-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (3008) Google Scholar). Cultivation and Harvest Conditions—For the copper resistance spot test experiment, cells were spotted on copper containing YMD (2% (w/v) glucose, 0.67% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, supplemented with histidine (20 mg/liter), leucine (40 mg/liter), lysine (40 mg/liter), and uracil (20 mg/liter)), 2% (w/v) agar plates. For all other experiments, yeast strains were cultivated on 2% (w/v) agar plates or in liquid culture with rich YPD medium (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) tryptone, 2% (w/v) glucose) at 30 °C. Liquid cultures were harvested by centrifugation at 1,600 × g for 20 min at 4 °C and rinsed once with ddH2O, and the pellet was stored at -20 °C. Cell Lysis—Packed yeast cell volume was estimated based on cell concentration of 3 × 107 cell/ml with A600 of 1 (26.Ausubel F.M. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. 5th Ed. 2. John Wiley, Inc., New York2002: 9-13Google Scholar), average cell size of 66 μm3 (27.Roskams J. Rogers L. Lab. Ref.: A Handbook of Recipes, Reagents, and Other Reference Tools for Use at the Bench (Section 7A). Cold Spring Harbor, New York2002: 196Google Scholar), and the harvested liquid culture size. The pellet was resuspended in 1–3 volumes of lysis buffer (either 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3 m ammonium sulfate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for protein extraction; 10% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in water for LC-MS/MS analysis of ADPr/OAADPr; or as indicated below for determination of NAD+, NADH, AMP, ATP, and NADPH), resulting in a 2–4-fold dilution of the final cellular metabolite concentrations. This cell paste was mixed with an equal volume of glass beads and vortexed at maximum speed for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting cell extract was spun at 15,800 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The clear supernatant was collected and stored at -20 °C. ADPr/OAADPr/NAADPr Metabolizing Assays and HPLC Analysis—To determine the degradation of ADPr/OAADPr/NAADPr within cell extracts, 1 mm of each small molecule was incubated with yeast cell extracts at 37 °C for 30 min in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2. The reactions were quenched with 1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and loaded onto Shimadzu HPLC (LC 2010) and separated by C18 analytical reverse phase column (Grace Vydac, 201SP104) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The column was equilibrated with buffer A (0.05% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in water) for 5 min, and thereafter the reaction mixture was eluted in a 20-min gradient to 8% buffer B (0.02% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile), followed by a 20-min gradient to 40% B. The column was then rinsed with 100% buffer B for 10 min and re-equilibrated with buffer A for 10 min before the next injection. ADPr/OAADPr/NAADPr and their respective degradation products were monitored at 260 nm. Halo Assay—The halo assay was performed following the protocol described in Guisbert et al. (28.Guisbert K. Duncan K. Li H. Guthrie C. RNA (N. Y.). 2005; 11: 383-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Briefly, yeast cells were grown to saturation, and then 50 μl of the culture was rapidly mixed with 4 ml of 0.5% (w/v) agar at 50 °C and poured on top of standard YPD plates. Next, three dilutions of hydrogen peroxide (1.5, 2.9, and 4.4 m) were applied onto the plates as 5-μl drops. The plates were incubated at 30 °C for 1 day before being photographed. H2O2 Survival Test—Yeast cells were grown to A600 of 0.6 before hydrogen peroxide was added to a final concentration of 3 mm. At each time point, the treatment was quenched by pelleting the cells and rinsing the cell pellets with ddH2O. Next, equal numbers of cells were plated onto standard YPD plates for recovery, and the plates were incubated at 30 °C for 2 days before the number of colonies were counted, using Epi Chem II Darkroom Imager (UVP). Copper Treatment—For the spot test, yeast cells were grown overnight at 30 °C with constant shaking at 200 rpm. After rinsing with ddH2O, the cultures were serially diluted from A600 = 1–10-5. Each dilution (5 μl) was spotted on YMD plates, with the indicated concentrations of CuSO4, and incubated at 30 °C for 2 days. For the survival test, cells were grown to A600 of 0.6, and CuSO4 was added to the liquid culture to a final concentration of 9 mm. Control cultures without CuSO4 were also grown in parallel. After incubation at 30 °C for 24 h, cells were pelleted, rinsed with ddH2O, and normalized before being plated onto YPD agar plates for recovery. The plates were incubated at 30 °C for 2 days before being photographed. Assessment of Cellular ROS and Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (ΔΨm)—Cellular ROS and mitochondrial membrane potential were measured using staining with dihydroethidium (DHE) or rhodamine 123 (Rho123), respectively. For ROS staining, cells were incubated in the presence of 5 μg/ml DHE for 15 min, and ROS oxidized DHE into ethidium. For mitochondrial membrane potential, cells were incubated with 2.5 μg/ml Rho123 for 35 min. In each experiment, 10,000 cells were analyzed per cell culture by FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) equipped with multicolor analysis (λex 488 nm/λem 605 nm for ethidium; λex 507 nm/λem 529 nm for Rho123). Unstained cells served as controls. Ysa1 Cellular Localization—Nuclei and mitochondria were isolated as described previously (29.Amati B.B. Gasser S.M.

Cell. 2008; 19: 5259-5266Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Anti-TAP antibody was purchased from Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL). Anti-Isu1 antibody was a kind gift from the Craig laboratory (University of Wisconsin, Madison). Anti-H3 antibody was a kind gift from Catherine Fox (University of Wisconsin, Madison). Western blots were visualized using Pierce SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate kit, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Screening for ADPr/OAADPr Interacting Proteins—Protein (0.5 mg) from whole cell extract was mixed with 100 μl Cibacron blue resin (C1160, Sigma) pre-equilibrated in 20 mm Tris, pH 7, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The mixture was mixed at 60 rpm at 4 °C for 1 h. Then the resin was washed four times with 1 ml of wash buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2) and eluted with 200 μl of wash buffer containing the indicated concentrations of ADPr/OAADPr. The wash and elution samples (100 μl) were concentrated, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and stained with SYPRO Ruby (Molecular Probes) protein stain. Anti-Sir2 antibody was a kind gift from Catherine Fox (University of Wisconsin, Madison). Western blot of Sir2 was visualized as described in Ysa1 localization experiment. In-gel Digestion and LC-MS/MS—SDS-PAGE bands were ingel digested with trypsin and analyzed using LC-MS/MS, as described (31.Hallows W.C. Lee S. Denu J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 10230-10235Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Data Base Searching—Data were searched using Mascot and the Swiss Prot S. cerevisiae Database (Feb. 2006). The search parameters included peptide mass tolerance of 1.2 Da, fragment mass tolerance 0.6 Da, trypsin, allowing for five missed cleavages, and carbamidomethyl (C), deamidation (NQ), and oxidation (M) as variable modifications. LC-MS/MS Measurement of ADPr/OAADPr Cellular Concentration—Cell extracts were analyzed by LC-MS/MS as described (32.Lee S. Tong L. Denu J.M. Anal. Biochem. 2008; 383: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell pellets were spiked with known amounts of isotopic standard 13C-OAADPr before being extracted to correct for sample losses during the processing. Extracts were then diluted with acetonitrile and directly analyzed using HILIC LC-MS/MS. Known concentrations of isotope standard 13C-OAADPr were used to generate a standard curve to quantify concentration of ADPr/OAADPr. Intracellular concentrations of ADPr and OAADPr were calculated from measured concentration, corrected for sample loss, and multiplied by dilution factors in the previously described cell lysis and LC-MS/MS sample preparation step. ADPr Inhibition of GAPDH Activity—The assay mixture (0.3 ml) contained 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, 0.043 to 0.286 mm NAD+, 0.06 to 0.3 mm ADPr, and highly purified GAPDH from S. cerevisiae (Sigma, G5537, 70–140 units/mg, <0.01% contamination activity of 3-phosphoglyceric phosphokinase). The reaction was initiated by the addition of NAD+, and the activity was monitored by NAD+ reduction at 340 nm. Absorbance was recorded every 4 s during 10 min. Initial velocities were determined from the linear portion of the curves. The initial velocity data were fitted to the competitive inhibition equation using Kinetasyst (Intellikinetics, State College, PA). Data were displayed using KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). Determination of Cellular NAD+, NADH, AMP, ATP, and NADPH—Cells extracts were generated as described above. To measure NAD+ and AMP concentrations, cells were lysed in 0.1 m HCl buffer; for ATP, cells were lysed in 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid; for NADH and NADPH, cells were lysed in 0.1 m NaOH. NAD+ was measured using the EnzyChrom™ NAD+/NADH assay kit from BioAssay Systems. NADH, AMP, and ATP were measured as described (33.Bergmeyer H. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 3rd Ed. 7. VCH Publishers, Deerfield Beach, FL1985: 253Google Scholar). NADPH concentrations were quantified using HPLC and NADPH standards following the method in (34.Pollak N. Niere M. Ziegler M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 33562-33571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Intracellular concentrations of these metabolites were calculated from extract concentrations and multiplying by the appropriate dilution factors (described earlier). Ysa1 Is the Major Cellular ADPr and OAADPr Nudix Hydrolase—To fully explore the biological functions of ADPr/OAADPr, it is critical to identify the enzymes that are capable of modulating their in vivo levels. Previously, we had demonstrated in vitro that several recombinant Nudix hydrolases, including Ysa1, were capable of hydrolyzing both ADPr and OAADPr with comparable activity (24.Rafty L.A. Schmidt M.T. Perraud A.L. Scharenberg A.M. Denu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47114-47122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, the biological importance of this specific activity had not been elucidated. Initially, we sought to establish whether endogenous Ysa1 is a significant contributor to the ADPr/OAADPr consuming activities in S. cerevisiae. Soluble protein extracts were generated from wild type and Δysa1 strains, and the ability of these extracts to cleave exogenously added ADPr and OAADPr to AMP was assessed using an HPLC-based assay. Wild type cell extract (Fig. 1A, top chromatogram) displayed a strong hydrolytic activity, readily converting ADPr (peak 1) to AMP (peak 2). In contrast, the Δysa1 cell extract (Fig. 1A, middle chromatogram) failed to generate significant AMP, comparable with the buffer control reaction (Fig. 1A, bottom chromatogram). Similarly, we examined the ability of wild type and Δysa1 strains to hydrolyze OAADPr, which exists as an ∼50:50 mixture of 2′ and 3′ isomers at neutral pH (5.Jackson M.D. Denu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18535-18544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). As was the case with ADPr, OAADPr was efficiently cleaved to AMP in the wild type extracts, but not in the Δysa1 strain (Fig. 1B, compare top and middle chromatograms). Together, these data suggest that Ysa1 is the major ADPr/OAADPr Nudix hydrolase in S. cerevisiae. Although the results were consistent with Ysa1 directly cleaving OAADPr to AMP and acetylated ribose phosphate, we performed additional experiments to corroborate this conclusion. Because of the labile nature of the acetyl group on OAADPr, there is significant nonenzymatic hydrolysis to ADPr during the incubation time of the assay (Fig. 1B, peak 1, bottom chromatogram). Moreover, we previously noted an esterase activity in mammalian and yeast cell extracts that yields acetate and ADPr from OAADPr (24.Rafty L.A. Schmidt M.T. Perraud A.L. Scharenberg A.M. Denu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47114-47122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This esterase activity was evident here, as greater levels of ADPr were observed in the Δysa1 strain than in the buffer control (Fig. 1B, compare middle and bottom chromatograms). To rule out the possibility that Ysa1 was hydrolyzing only ADPr and not both OAADPr and ADPr, we examined the ability of the two strains to cleave an analog of OAADPr, 3′-NAADPr (35.Comstock L.R. Denu J.M. Org. Biomol. Chem. 2007; 5: 3087-3091Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This OAADPr analog has nitrogen in place of the 3′-oxygen, forming an amide with the acetyl group, which is predicted to be resistant to both enzymatic and spontaneous hydrolysis. When 3′-NAADPr (Fig. 1C, peak 5) was incubated with cell extracts from the wild type and Δysa1 strains, indeed no hydrolysis at either the acetyl group or at the pyrophosphate linkage was observed in the Δysa1 cell extract (Fig. 1C, middle chromatogram), whereas the analog was converted to AMP (Fig. 1C, peak 2) in the wild type cell extract (Fig. 1C, top chromatogram). Thus, 3′-NAADPr is directly hydrolyzed to AMP by Ysa1. These data support the conclusion that Ysa1 is the major metabolizing activity capable of efficient hydrolysis of both OAADPr and ADPr. Quantification of Cellular Metabolites—Based on assays using exogenously added ADPr/OAADPr, Ysa1 is the major metabolizing enzyme for these metabolites in yeast protein extracts. This observation led to the hypothesis that Ysa1 may control the cellular concentrations of these metabolites. To determine whether ADPr and OAADPr levels are affected in the Ysa1 deletion strain, we measured their concentrations by a recently developed LC/MS-MS method (32.Lee S. Tong L. Denu J.M. Anal. Biochem. 2008; 383: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Wild type and Δysa1 cells were lysed by bead beating in 10% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. NAD+, ADPr, and OAADPr are stable to this acid treatment; however, NADH is not. Because NADH is hydrolyzed to ADPr in the acidic cell lysis buffer (5.Jackson M.D. Denu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18535-18544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 32.Lee S. Tong L. Denu J.M. Anal. Biochem. 2008; 383: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 33.Bergmeyer H. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 3rd Ed. 7. VCH Publishers, Deerfield Beach, FL1985: 253Google Scholar), we independently measured NADH concentration by an alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) assay (33.Bergmeyer H. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 3rd Ed. 7. VCH Publishers, Deerfield Beach, FL1985: 253Google Scholar), using acetaldehyde as substrate. The endogenous ADPr concentration was calculated by subtracting NADH concentrations from the total ADPr (ADPr + NADH hydrolysis). ADPr concentrations increased 50% in the Δysa1 cells as compared with wild type (Table 1), whereas OAADPr also increased 49% (32.Lee S. Tong L. Denu J.M. Anal. Biochem. 2008; 383: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To demonstrate that the increase in ADPr was the direct result of Ysa1 activity, we measured the product of the Nudix reaction, AMP. Indeed, the AMP levels (Table 1) decreased (22%) in the deletion strain, consistent with a loss in ADPr hydrolysis by Ysa1. Whole cell levels of NAD+ and ATP were not significantly different between the two strains (Table 1).TABLE 1Ysa1 affects cellular levels of multiple NAD+ metabolites All metabolites and concentration measurements in this paper were performed with three biological replicates.

https://openalex.org/W2032998587,"A critical mediator of the cellular response to hypoxia is hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1). Increased levels of HIF-1α are often associated with increased tumor metastasis, therapeutic resistance, and poorer prognosis. We recently identified a novel interaction between HIF-1α and the mammalian septin family member, SEPT9_v1. Septins are a highly conserved family of GTP-binding cytoskeletal proteins that are implicated in multiple cellular functions, including cell division and oncogenesis. SEPT9_v1 binds and stabilizes HIF-1α protein and stimulates HIF-1 transcriptional activity. SEPT9_v1-HIF-1 activation promotes tumor growth and angiogenesis. The structural and functional relationships between SEPT9_v1 and HIF-1α were analyzed. We found that SEPT9_v1 binds specifically with HIF-1α but not with HIF-2α. The GTPase domain of SEPT9_v1 was identified as essential for HIF-1α binding. A GTPase domain-derived polypeptide, corresponding to amino acids 252–379, was able to disrupt HIF-1α-SEPT9_v1 interaction and to inhibit HIF-1 transcriptional activity. SEPT9_v1 also protected HIF-1α from degradation induced by HSP90 inhibition by preventing the interaction of HIF-1α with the RACK1 protein, which promotes its oxygen-independent proteasomal degradation. In conclusion, a new mechanism of oxygen-independent activation of HIF-1 has been identified that is mediated by SEPT9_v1 blockade of RACK1 activity on HIF-1α degradation. A critical mediator of the cellular response to hypoxia is hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1). Increased levels of HIF-1α are often associated with increased tumor metastasis, therapeutic resistance, and poorer prognosis. We recently identified a novel interaction between HIF-1α and the mammalian septin family member, SEPT9_v1. Septins are a highly conserved family of GTP-binding cytoskeletal proteins that are implicated in multiple cellular functions, including cell division and oncogenesis. SEPT9_v1 binds and stabilizes HIF-1α protein and stimulates HIF-1 transcriptional activity. SEPT9_v1-HIF-1 activation promotes tumor growth and angiogenesis. The structural and functional relationships between SEPT9_v1 and HIF-1α were analyzed. We found that SEPT9_v1 binds specifically with HIF-1α but not with HIF-2α. The GTPase domain of SEPT9_v1 was identified as essential for HIF-1α binding. A GTPase domain-derived polypeptide, corresponding to amino acids 252–379, was able to disrupt HIF-1α-SEPT9_v1 interaction and to inhibit HIF-1 transcriptional activity. SEPT9_v1 also protected HIF-1α from degradation induced by HSP90 inhibition by preventing the interaction of HIF-1α with the RACK1 protein, which promotes its oxygen-independent proteasomal degradation. In conclusion, a new mechanism of oxygen-independent activation of HIF-1 has been identified that is mediated by SEPT9_v1 blockade of RACK1 activity on HIF-1α degradation. A key transcription factor for cells to respond and adapt to survive hypoxia is hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) 3The abbreviations used are: HIF-1, hypoxia-inducible factor 1; HSP90, heat shock protein 90; 17-AAG, 17-Allylamino-17-demethoxy-geldanamycin; HRE, hypoxia-response elements; ODDD, oxygen-dependent degradation domain; HLH, helix-loop-helix; PAS, Per-aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-Sim; HA, hemagglutinin; IP, immunoprecipitation; VHL, von Hippel-Lindau. 3The abbreviations used are: HIF-1, hypoxia-inducible factor 1; HSP90, heat shock protein 90; 17-AAG, 17-Allylamino-17-demethoxy-geldanamycin; HRE, hypoxia-response elements; ODDD, oxygen-dependent degradation domain; HLH, helix-loop-helix; PAS, Per-aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-Sim; HA, hemagglutinin; IP, immunoprecipitation; VHL, von Hippel-Lindau. (1.Semenza G.L. Sci. STKE. 2007; 2007: cm8Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). HIF-1 target genes encode proteins involved in anaerobic metabolism (e.g. glycolytic enzymes and glucose transporters), angiogenesis (e.g. vascular endothelial growth factor), and erythropoiesis (e.g. erythropoietin) (2.Semenza G.L. Shimoda L.A. Prabhakar N.R. Novartis Found. Symp. 2006; 272: 2-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). HIF-1 is a heterodimer and consists of a constitutively expressed subunit, HIF-1β, and an oxygen-regulated subunit, HIF-1α. HIF-1 transcriptional activity is directly affected by the abundance and stability of HIF-1α. HIF-1α protein expression is tightly regulated by O2 levels. Under normoxic conditions, human HIF-1α is hydroxylated by prolyl hydroxylases at two specific proline residues, Pro402 and Pro564 (3.Bruick R.K. McKnight S.L. Science. 2001; 294: 1337-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (2066) Google Scholar, 4.Epstein A.C. Gleadle J.M. McNeill L.A. Hewitson K.S. O'Rourke J. Mole D.R. Mukherji M. Metzen E. Wilson M.I. Dhanda A.

Science. 2001; 292: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (3783) Google Scholar). The “proline” hydroxylated form of HIF-1α is recognized by von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein as part of a complex with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity that leads to ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation of HIF-1α (6.Kallio P.J.

HIF-1 transcriptional activity is regulated by an additional mode of hydroxylation. Under normoxia, HIF-1α is also hydroxylated at asparagine residue 803 by factor inhibiting HIF-1α (FIH-1) leading to inhibition of CBP recruitment to the HIF-1α C-terminal transactivation domain (8.Mahon P.C. Hirota K. Semenza G.L. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2675-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar, 9.Lando D. Peet D.J. Gorman J.J. Whelan D.A. Whitelaw M.L. Bruick R.K.

J. 2002; 367: 571-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The hydroxylation reactions utilize O2 andα-ketoglutarate as substrates. Under hypoxia, HIF-1α is therefore not hydroxylated and becomes stabilized to heterodimerize with HIF-1β and to recruit co-factors such as CBP for transcriptional activation. In tumor cells HIF-1 can also be regulated and activated by other genetic factors such as oncogenes (Ras and phosphoinositide 3-kinase) or loss of tumor suppressors (VHL or PTEN) even under aerobic conditions. On another level of post-translational regulation, Liu et al. (11.Liu Y.V. Baek J.H. Zhang H. Diez R. Cole R.N. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 207-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) have recently identified RACK1 (receptor of activated protein kinase C 1) as a HIF-1α-interacting protein that competes with heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) for binding to HIF-1α and mediates O2- and prolyl hydroxylase/VHL-independent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (12.Bertout J.A. Patel S.A. Simon M.C. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8: 967-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). We have recently described another novel activation pathway of HIF-1 under normoxia by a member of the mammalian septin family, SEPT9_v1 (septin 9 protein, variant 1) (13.Amir S. Wang R. Matzkin H. Simons J.W. Mabjeesh N.J. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 856-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We discovered that SEPT9_v1 interacts with HIF-1α to prevent its ubiquitination and degradation. SEPT9_v1 protein activates HIF-1 transcriptional activity and increases tumor growth and angiogenesis in prostate cancer xenografts (13.Amir S. Wang R. Matzkin H. Simons J.W. Mabjeesh N.J. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 856-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Similarly, Gonzalez et al. (14.Gonzalez M.E. Peterson E.A. Privette L.M. Loffreda-Wren J.L. Kalikin L.M. Petty E.M. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 8554-8564Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) have shown that high expression of SEPT9_v1 is also associated with accelerated growth kinetics and increased motility in human breast cancer cells. Therefore, we investigated the mechanisms of HIF-1 activation by SEPT9_v1. We found that SEPT9_v1 is involved in the regulation of the O2- and prolyl hydroxylase/VHL-independent degradation of HIF-1α, which is mediated by RACK1. Cell Culture and Hypoxia Treatment—Human prostate cancer PC-3 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 as recommended by the American Type Culture Collection. Stably transfected PC-3 cells with SEPT9_v1 (PC-3-SEPT9_v1) or with the empty vector (PC-3-Neo) were designed and characterized previously (13.Amir S. Wang R. Matzkin H. Simons J.W. Mabjeesh N.J. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 856-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). PC-3 cells were infected with retroviral vector expressing either empty vector (PC-3-Puro) or shSEPT9_v1 (PC-3-shSEPT9_v1) as previously described (15.Amir S. Mabjeesh N.J. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2007; 6: 1926-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. All of the media were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. The cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere and 5% CO2 in air. For hypoxic exposure, the cells were placed in a sealed modular incubator chamber (Billups-Rothenberg, Del Mar, CA) flushed with 1% O2, 5% CO2, and 94% N2. Plasmids and Reagents—Human untagged-HIF-1α (GenBank™ accession number NM_001530), FLAG-HIF-1α, and FLAG-SEPT9_v1 (GenBank™ accession number AF189713) were previously constructed (13.Amir S. Wang R. Matzkin H. Simons J.W. Mabjeesh N.J. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 856-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). FLAG-tagged mutated and truncated forms of HIF-1α were constructed into p3XFLAG-Myc-CMV-25 (Sigma-Aldrich), whereas SEPT9_v1-Myc truncated forms were constructed into pcDNA4/Myc-His (A) (Invitrogen). Deletion and point mutations were performed by multiple overlapping PCRs using the specific primers as listed in Table 1. Human RACK1 (GenBank™ accession number NM_006098) was subcloned at HindIII/XbaI sites into pcDNA4/Myc-His (A) to produce RACK1-Myc-tagged fusion protein (Table 1). Hemagglutinin (HA)-HIF-2α expression vector was a generous gift from Dr. W. G. Kaelin (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). All of the constructs were verified by DNA sequencing (Danyel Biotech, Rehovot, Israel).TABLE 1List of designed constructs and primes used in this studyGenePrimer sequencesFLAG-HIF-1constructs ΔHLHF: CCGCGCCCGCGGCCGCGATGGTTCTCACAGATGATGGTGR: CAGTTCTAGATTATCAGTTAACTTGATCCAAAGCTC ΔHLH/PASF: ACGTGCGGCCGCGTTTTCTACTCAGGACACAGATTTAGACTTGR: CAGTTCTAGATTATGAGTTAACTTGATCCAAAGCTCTGAG ΔPASAmino acids 1-85F: ACGTGCGGCCGCGATGGAGGGCGCCGGCGGCGCGAACGR: CCTGTACTGTCCTGTGGTGACTTGCATGTCATCTTCAATATCCAAATCAmino acids 298-826F: GATTTGGATATTGAAGATGACATGCAAGTCACCACAGGACAGTACAGGR: CAGTTCTAGATTATGAGTTAACTTGATCCAAAGCTCTGAG HLH/PASF: ACGTGCGGCCGCGATGGAGGGCGCCGGCGGCGCGAACGR: CAGTTCTAGATTAAGAATTCTTGGTGTTATATATGACAGTTG ΔODDDAmino acids 1-343F: ACGTGCGGCCGCGATGGAGGGCGCCGGCGGCGCGAACGR: GTTCTTCCTCAGGAACTGTAGTACTCACAACGTAATTCACACATACAmino acids 698-826F: GTATGTGTGAATTACGTTGTGAGTACTACAGTTCCTGAGGAAGAACR: CAGTTCTAGATTATGAGTTAACTTGATCCAAAGCTCTGAG DPMAmino acids 1-402 with P402AF: ACGTGCGGCCGCGATGGAGGGCGCCGGCGGCGCGAACGR: GTCTCCAGCGGCTGCGGCCAGCAAAGAmino acids 402-826F: CTTTGCTGGCCGCAGCCGCTGGAGACR: CAGTTCTAGATTATGAGTTAACTTGATCCAAAGCTCTGAGAmino acids 1-564 with P564AF: ACGTGCGGCCGCGATGGAGGGCGCCGGCGGCGCGAACGR: CATTGGGATATAGGCAGCTAACATCTCAmino acids 564-826 with P564AF: GAGATGTTAGCTGCCTATATCCCAATGR: CAGTTCTAGATTATGAGTTAACTTGATCCAAAGCTCTGAGSEPT9_v1-Myc constructs Full lengthF: ACTAAGCTTATGAAGAAGTCTTACTCAGGAGGCACGCGGACCR: ACGTTCTAGACATCTCTGGGGCTTCTGGCTCCTTCTCCTCC 1-251F: ACTAAGCTTATGAAGAAGTCTTACTCAGGAGGCACGCGGACCR: GTTCTAGAGTCGCCAACGCAGCTGGGAGC 252-586F: ACTAAGCTTATGGCCGACACCCCCAGAGATGR: ACGTTCTAGACATCTCTGGGGCTTCTGGCTCCTTCTCCTCC 252-379F: ACTAAGCTTATGGCCGACACCCCCAGAGATGR: ACGTTCTAGAGATGGGCTGCCAGCAGTTCTCG 380-586F: ACTAAGCTTATGAAGTTCATCAATGACCAGTACGAGR: ACGTTCTAGACATCTCTGGGGCTTCTGGCTCCTTCTCCTCCRACK1-Myc (full length)F: CCGCGCCCAAGCTTATGACTGAGCAGATGACCCTTCR: CCGCGCCCTCTAGAGCGTGTGCCAATGGTCA Open table in a new tab 17-Allylamino-17-demethoxy-geldanamycin (17-AAG) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The following primary antibodies were used: mouse monoclonal antibodies to HIF-1α and to RACK1 (BD BioSciences, San Diego, CA; BD610959 and 610177, respectively), mouse monoclonal anti-HIF-1β (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO; ab2771–100), mouse monoclonal antibodies to FLAG and to tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich; F3165 and T9026, respectively), mouse monoclonal anti-HA.11 (Covance, Berkeley, CA; MMS-101R), goat polyclonal anti-TOPO-I (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA; sc-5342), and rabbit affinity-purified anti-Myc (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX; A190-105A). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to SEPT9_v1 were previously prepared (13.Amir S. Wang R. Matzkin H. Simons J.W. Mabjeesh N.J. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 856-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Secondary antibodies were horseradish peroxidase-conjugated (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Protein Extraction and Western Blot—Whole cell and nuclear extracts were prepared as previously described (16.Mabjeesh N.J. Escuin D. LaVallee T.M. Pribluda V.S. Swartz G.M. Johnson M.S. Willard M.T. Zhong H. Simons J.W. Giannakakou P. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 363-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce). The proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with antibodies as displayed in the figures as described (13.Amir S. Wang R. Matzkin H. Simons J.W. Mabjeesh N.J. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 856-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 16.Mabjeesh N.J. Escuin D. LaVallee T.M. Pribluda V.S. Swartz G.M. Johnson M.S. Willard M.T. Zhong H. Simons J.W. Giannakakou P. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 363-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Sixty μg of protein were loaded in each lane. Transfections and Reporter Gene Assays—The cells were seeded in 10-cm or 6-well plates and were transfected with a total of 5 μg DNA or 1 μg of DNA/well, respectively, using GenePorter transfection reagent (Gene Therapy Systems, Inc., San Diego, CA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. HRE-dependent luciferase activity was performed using the pBI-GL construct (pBI-GL V6L) containing six tandem copies of the VEGF HRE as previously described (17.Post D.E. Van Meir E.G. Gene Ther. 2001; 8: 1801-1807Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 18.Mabjeesh N.J. Post D.E. Willard M.T. Kaur B. Van Meir E.G. Simons J.W. Zhong H. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2478-2482PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, duplicate sets of transfected cell-culture dishes were then separated and incubated under normoxic and hypoxic conditions for 16 h. Luciferase enzymatic activity was measured with commercial kit TROPIX (Bedford, MA) using a BMG Labtechnologies LUMIstar Galaxy luminometer following the manufacturer's instructions. Arbitrary luciferase activity units were normalized to the amount of protein in each assay point. Immunoprecipitation (IP) Assays—Cells grown in 10-cm plates were lysed in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.1 m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol 48 h after they had been transfected and treated accordingly. Protease and phosphatase inhibitors were added to the lysis buffer. The lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. Ten percent of the extract was kept, and the rest was incubated with the appropriate antibodies for 3 h at 4 °C. The samples were next rotated with protein G-Sepharose (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed six times with lysis buffer, and immunoprecipitates were eluted in 2× Laemmli sample buffer for SDS-PAGE analysis. 17-AAG Treatment—Cells, either transfected or nontransfected, grown in culture dishes until 70% confluence, were treated with vehicle (0.1% Me2SO) or 17-AAG at the concentrations indicated in the figures at 37 °C under normoxic or hypoxic conditions. After 5 or 16 h, the cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, harvested, and subjected to IP or HRE-luciferase assays, respectively. Data Analysis—The experiments presented in the figures are representative of three or more independent repetitions. Using TINA software version 2.0, quantification of band densities was performed. The data are expressed as means ± S.D. Student's t test was used to compare differences between particular conditions. Pearson Chi-Square was calculated using SPSS software version 15. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. SEPT9_v1 Binds HIF-1α but Not HIF-2α Regardless of Proline Hydroxylation Status—We previously reported that SEPT9_v1 interacts with HIF-1α protein to activate HIF-1 transcriptional activity (13.Amir S. Wang R. Matzkin H. Simons J.W. Mabjeesh N.J. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 856-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To further characterize the specificity of HIF-1α-SEPT9_v1 interactions, we studied whether SEPT9_v1 would or would not also associate with HIF-2α protein. HEK293 cells were transiently co-transfected with expression vectors encoding SEPT9_v1-Myc and HA-HIF-2α. The IP experiment was performed in parallel using both antibodies to Myc and HA. The immunoprecipitated proteins from each lysate were analyzed by Western blotting using their counterpart tag antibodies (Fig. 1A). Although both HIF-2α and SEPT9_v1 were immunoprecipitated, each by their corresponding tag antibody, no interaction between the two proteins was observed (Fig. 1A). These findings demonstrate that SEPT9_v1 does not interact with HIF-2α. Because the interaction between endogenous HIF-1α and SEPT9_v1 proteins was more prominent under normoxia rather than under hypoxia (13.Amir S. Wang R. Matzkin H. Simons J.W. Mabjeesh N.J. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 856-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that hydroxylation of the proline residues 402 and 564 within the oxygen-dependent degradation domain (ODDD) of HIF-1α may modulate the interaction. We therefore designed and inserted alanine point mutations in these two proline residues (P402A/P564A) and tested the interaction with SEPT9_v1 (Fig. 1B). As expected, the protein expression level of HIF-1α P402A/P564A was much higher than the wild type HIF-1α polypeptide (Fig. 1B). Regardless of the amino acid substitution, the double proline mutant species interacted with SEPT9_v1 protein in a similar fashion as the wild type HIF-1α (Fig. 1B). The results show that neither proline 402 nor proline 564 is required for HIF-1α/SEPT9_v1 interaction. Amino Acids 252–379 of SEPT9_v1 Are Sufficient to Bind HIF-1α and to Inhibit HIF-1 Transcriptional Activity—Our initial studies indicated that activation of HIF-1 by SEPT9_v1 is dependent on the N-terminal part (amino acids 1–25) and the GTP-binding site (amino acids 305–312) of SEPT9_v1, although none was required for the interaction itself (13.Amir S. Wang R. Matzkin H. Simons J.W. Mabjeesh N.J. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 856-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). As schematically outlined in Fig. 2A, a series of Myc-tagged SEPT9_v1 constructs were designed to further identify the domain of SEPT9_v1 that binds to HIF-1α protein. These constructs were co-expressed with HIF-1α in HEK293 cells and subjected to an IP assay. The C-terminal part of SEPT9_v1 (amino acids 252–586) consisting of the conserved GTPase domain bound to full-length HIF-1α protein, whereas the N-terminal part (amino acids 1–251) did not interact with HIF-1α (Fig. 2B). Further narrowing of the C-terminal part revealed that amino acids 252–379 (SEPT9_v1252–379) were sufficient to bind to HIF-1α (Fig. 2B). Consequently, we tested whether SEPT9_v1252–379 would be able to interfere with HIF-1α/SEPT9_v1 interaction and to affect HIF-1 activity. HEK293 cells were transfected with SEPT9_v1252–379 in the presence of HIF-1α and SEPT9_v1. Increasing amounts of SEPT9_ v1252–379 reduced HIF-1α protein expression and caused a dose-dependent inhibition of HIF-1α association with SEPT9_v1 (Fig. 2C). Expression of SEPT9_v1252–379 also led to a significant inhibition, respectively, of HIF-1 transcriptional activity measured by HRE-dependent reporter gene assay (60% under normoxia and 35% under hypoxia) (Fig. 2D). Similar results were also obtained in PC-3 cells (data not shown). Altogether, the minimal interacting domain identified of SEPT9_v1 (SEPT9_v1252–379) is able to disrupt the HIF-1α/SEPT9_v1 complex and is capable of inhibiting HIF-1 transcriptional activity. The Helix-Loop-Helix Domain of HIF-1α Is Required for the Interaction with SEPT9_v1—To map the domain of HIF-1α that interacts with SEPT9_v1, a number of FLAG-tagged HIF-1α constructs were designed as illustrated in Fig. 3A. Myc-tagged full-length SEPT9_v1 and HIF-1α constructs were expressed in HEK293 cells and subjected to an IP assay (Fig. 3B). Consistent with the HIF-1α double proline mutant results, HIF-1α ODDD was not required for the interaction with SEPT9_v1 (Fig. 3B). Only the species that included HIF-1α HLH domain interacted with SEPT9_v1, whereas all other HIF-1α species lacking the HLH domain did not interact with SEPT9_v1 (Fig. 3B). Importantly, our results demonstrated that the HLH domain, which is one of the essential domains required for heterodimerization with HIF-1β, is also required for the interaction with SEPT9_v1. SEPT9_v1 Functions to Protect HIF-1α from RACK1-mediated Degradation—We have shown previously that SEPT9_v1 interacts with HIF-1α and prevents its ubiquitination (13.Amir S. Wang R. Matzkin H. Simons J.W. Mabjeesh N.J. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 856-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We investigated the mechanism of HIF-1α stabilization or shielding by SEPT9_v1. Given that SEPT9_v1 does not interact with the ODDD of HIF-1α and that the interaction is not influenced by proline modification, we sought for alternative regulation pathways other than the well known VHL-dependent degradation pathway. The anchoring protein, RACK1 interacts with HIF-1α and competes with HSP90 to promote HIF-1α ubiquitination and degradation that is independent of VHL (11.Liu Y.V. Baek J.H. Zhang H. Diez R. Cole R.N. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 207-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Because the N-terminal half of HIF-1α comprising the HLH/PAS domain is involved with HSP90 and RACK1 interaction and regulation (11.Liu Y.V. Baek J.H. Zhang H. Diez R. Cole R.N. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 207-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 19.Isaacs J.S. Jung Y.J. Mimnaugh E.G. Martinez A. Cuttitta F. Neckers L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29936-29944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar), we postulated that stabilizing the HIF-1α protein by SEPT9_v1 could be a result of a competition between RACK1 and SEPT9_v1 for HIF-1α binding. To test this hypothesis, we used PC-3 stably expressing SEPT9_v1 protein (PC-3-SEPT9_v1) and its control counterpart expressing the empty vector (PC-3-Neo). Both PC-3 cells subtypes were treated with increasing concentrations of the HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG, a less toxic analog of geldanamycin. The IC50 of HIF-1α protein down-regulation by 17-AAG was 10-fold higher in PC-3-SEPT9_v1 cells compared with PC-3-Neo cells (>1 μm versus 0.1 μm) under normoxic and hypoxic conditions (Fig. 4A). On the functional level, 0.1 μm 17-AAG induced 40% versus 15% (p < 0.001, 2-sided Parson Chi-Square) inhibition of HIF-1 transcriptional activity in PC-3-Neo cells compared with PC-3-SEPT9_v1 cells under normoxic conditions (Fig. 4B). Under hypoxia, 0.1 μm 17-AAG also inhibited HIF-1 transcriptional activity by 45% versus 30% (p = 0.028, 2-sided Parson Chi-Square) in PC-3-Neo cells compared with PC-3-SEPT9_v1 cells (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that SEPT9_v1 protects HIF-1α from a degradation mediated by the 17-AAG-RACK1 pathway. To confirm that SEPT9_v1 prevents RACK1 direct binding to HIF-1α, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with HIF-1α, SEPT9_v1, or RACK1 for IP experiment (Fig. 5A). The association of HIF-1α with RACK1 was weaker in the presence of SEPT9_v1 (compare lane 4 with 3). Furthermore, the association of HIF-1α with SEPT9_v1 was also weaker in the presence of RACK1 comparing lane 4 with lane 2. As predicted, HIF-1α protein expression was increased by SEPT9_v1 and decreased by RACK1 (compare lanes 3 and 4 with lane 1). The HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG inhibited HIF-1α protein levels and to a greater extent did so in the presence of RACK1 (compare lanes 5 and 7 with lane 1). Similar to RACK1, SEPT9_v1 was associated more with HIF-1α after 17-AAG treatment (compare lane 7 with lane 3 and lane 6 with lane 2). SEPT9_v1 was able to protect HIF-1α from degradation induced by 17-AAG and RACK1 (compare lane 8 with lane 5). In addition, even in the presence of 17-AAG, the relative association of SEPT9_v1 and RACK1 with HIF-1α was affected, as manifested by comparing lane 8 with lane 6 and comparing lane 8 with lane 7. Taken together, these results indicate that, as an activator of function, SEPT9_v1 and, as an inhibitor of function, RACK1 compete with each other to directly bind HIF-1α. Although RACK1 binds to promote degradation, SEPT9_v1 binds HIF-1α to protect against degradation by RACK1 and confers stabilization of HIF-1α. SEPT9_v1 Promotes HIF-1α/HIF-1β Heterodimerization—Our previous results showed that SEPT9_v1 does not bind HIF-1β (13.Amir S. Wang R. Matzkin H. Simons J.W. Mabjeesh N.J. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 856-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A major role of septins is to scaffold, anchor, and/or stabilize other proteins (20.Spiliotis E.T. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 4-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 21.Kinoshita M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 54-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Because SEPT9_v1 binds the HLH domain of HIF-1α and the HLH domain required for heterodimerization with HIF-1β in addition to the PAS domains, we examined whether SEPT9_v1 “modifies” HIF-1α in a way that recruits HIF-1β rather than competes with it. PC-3 cells were transfected with SEPT9_v1 and then were subjected to an IP experiment using HIF-1α antibodies (Fig. 5B). Analysis of the immunoprecipitates showed that the amount of endogenous HIF-1β protein associated with endogenous HIF-1α protein in the presence of excess SEPT9_v1 was increased in the control samples (Fig. 5B). Similar results were also obtained in HEK293 cells co-transfected with HIF-1α and SEPT9_v1 (data not shown). Because SEPT9_v1 does not compete with HIF-1β to bind HIF-1α, HIF-1β is more associated with HIF-1α in the presence of SEPT9_v1. There is no direct interaction between SEPT9_v1 and HIF-1β. These strongly support the model that SEPT9_v1 has an important cellular role in HIF-1α/HIF-1β heterodimerization. Silencing SEPT9_v1 Facilitates RACK1-mediated HIF-1α Degradation and Disrupts HIF-1α/HIF-1β Interaction—To study the effects of endogenous SEPT9_v1 on RACK1-mediated HIF-1α degradation and on HIF-1α/HIF-1β interaction, we utilized PC-3 cells stably expressing specific short hairpin RNA to knockdown SEPT9_v1 (PC-3-shSEPT9_v1) and their counterpart PC-3 cells expressing the empty vector (PC-3-Puro) (Fig. 6). SEPT9_v1 protein expression was down-regulated by 40–50% in PC-3-shSEPT9_v1 cells compared with control cells (Fig. 6A). In PC-3-shSEPT9_v1 cells, 17-AAG induced faster degradation (2-fold) of endogenous HIF-1α compared with control cells (Fig. 6B). In accordance with these results, knockdown SEPT9_v1 also increased endogenous RACK1 binding to endogenous HIF-1α, especially in the presence of 17-AAG (Fig. 6C). On the other hand, knockdown SEPT9_v1 caused a weaker interaction between endogenous HIF-1α and HIF-1β (Fig. 6D). Altogether, the data obtained from SEPT9_v1 silencing show and further confirm the preventive effects of SEPT9_v1 on HIF-1α degradation by RACK1 as well as the effects on HIF-1α/HIF-1β heterodimerization. In these studies, we present mechanistic evidence of the involvement of the septin family member, SEPT9_v1 in HIF-1 O2-independent activation in prostate cancer cells. SEPT9_v1 acts as a HIF-1α “protective factor” that inhibits RACK1-mediated HIF-1α proteasomal degradation. As a consequence, SEPT9_v1 elevates intracellular HIF-1α levels. Furthermore, we show that SEPT9_v1 contributes to optimal heterodimerization of HIF-1α with HIF-1β to create a functional HIF-1 transcription complex. These findings shed light on one of the important epigenetic processes that could lead to the aerobic activation of HIF-1 in cancer cells. The action of SEPT9_v1 on HIF-1α appears to function like HSP90 in several respects. First, both proteins stabilize and protect HIF-1α from proteasomal degradation (13.Amir S. Wang R. Matzkin H. Simons J.W. Mabjeesh N.J. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 856-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 18.Mabjeesh N.J. Post D.E. Willard M.T. Kaur B. Van Meir E.G. Simons J.W. Zhong H.

HSP90 interacts with HIF-1α, but it is not co-translocated with HIF-1α into the nucleus (23.Minet E. Mottet D. Michel G. Roland I. Raes M. Remacle J. Michiels C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). In contrast, SEPT9_v1 was shown to bind with HIF-1α predominantly in the nucleus (13.Amir S. Wang R. Matzkin H. Simons J.W. Mabjeesh N.J. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 856-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We therefore propose that SEPT9_v1 has an important role in protecting HIF-1α from ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation that commences in the nucleus (24.Zheng X. Ruas J.L. Cao R. Salomons F.A. Cao Y. Poellinger L. Pereira T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 4628-4641Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Second, HLH and PAS domains of HIF-1α were critical for HSP90 binding (23.Minet E. Mottet D. Michel G. Roland I. Raes M. Remacle J. Michiels C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 25.Isaacs J.S. Jung Y.J. Neckers L. J. Biol.

Biochem. 2004; 14: 351-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We discovered that the HLH domain but not the PAS domain is required for SEPT9_v1 binding (Fig. 3). Third, HSP90 (11.Liu Y.V. Baek J.H. Zhang H. Diez R. Cole R.N. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 207-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 27.Liu Y.V. Semenza G.L. Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 656-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and SEPT9_v1 (Fig. 5) compete with RACK1 for binding HIF-1α. In addition, in the presence of the HSP90 inhibitor, 17-AAG, where the interaction of HIF-1α with HSP90 is disrupted, the association of SEPT9_v1 with HIF-1α is favored, leading to increased HIF-1α stabilization and function (Figs. 4 and 5A). Moreover, when SEPT9_v1 protein levels were reduced in the presence of 17-AAG, the interaction between HIF-1α and RACK1 becomes dramatically more efficient, leading to increased HIF-1α degradation (Fig. 6, B and C). Taken together, these data indicate that there is a dynamic interplay between the three proteins, HSP90, SEPT9_v1, and RACK1 involved in the fine-tuning of the nonhypoxic transcriptional activation of HIF-1 as schematically illustrated in Fig. 7. On the other hand, unlike HSP90, which also binds HIF-2α (26.Katschinski D.M. Le L. Schindler S.G. Thomas T. Voss A.K. Wenger R.H. Cell Physiol. Biochem. 2004; 14: 351-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), SEPT9_v1 interacts specifically with HIF-1α (Fig. 1A). Of interest is whether other members of the conserved septin family may be involved in the regulation of other HIF-α subunits. We also demonstrate that intact HIF-1α interaction with SEPT9_v1 is essential for HIF-1 activation. Overexpression of the interacting domain of SEPT9_v1, SEPT9_v1252–379, which comprises part of the GTPase domain, was capable of disrupting HIF-1α-SEPT9_v1 complex and inhibiting HIF-1 transcriptional activity (Fig. 2). These data strengthen the rationale for discovering small molecules with high throughput screening that interfere with or displace the binding HIF-1α-SEPT9_v1 interaction, making these small molecules a new class of HIF-1 inhibitors as HSP90 inhibitors have been previously classified (22.Neckers L. Curr. Med. Chem. 2003; 10: 733-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Moreover, it would be worthy to test whether the combination of HSP90 inhibitors with disruption of HIF-1α-SEPT9_v1 interaction will allow more efficient total down-regulation of HIF-1α. Although the ODDD of HIF-1α was not required for the interaction with SEPT9_v1 (Fig. 3), still the affinity of HIF-1α to SEPT9_v1 under hypoxia was lowered (13.Amir S. Wang R. Matzkin H. Simons J.W. Mabjeesh N.J. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 856-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Our explanation for this weaker interaction is that SEPT9_v1 is displaced by HIF-1β under hypoxia. It is important to emphasize that both proteins, HIF-1β and SEPT9_v1, bind to HLH domain of HIF-1α without evidence of direct competition. In the presence of SEPT9_v1 it would be expected that the amount of HIF-1β associated with HIF-1α would be reduced. In contrast, the same amount of HIF-1α binds more molecules to HIF-1β in the presence of SEPT9_v1 (Fig. 5B) and vice versa when SEPT9_v1 levels are reduced (Fig. 6D). These results are consistent with findings that septins function as “stabilizing” proteins for critical cellular processes (20.Spiliotis E.T. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 4-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 21.Kinoshita M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 54-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The data indicate that, in addition to stabilizing HIF-1α, SEPT9_v1 also functions to facilitate the interaction with HIF-1β for optimal heterodimerization and creation of transcriptionally functional HIF-1. We find it provocative that SEPT9_v1 is involved in up-regulating HIF-1α by counter-regulation of the role of RACK1 in driving degradation of HIF-1α levels. SEPT9 was originally discovered as a fusion partner gene of myeloid/lymphoid or mixed lineage leukemia in acute myeloid leukemias and was initially named MSF (myeloid/lymphoid or mixed lineage leukemia septin-like fusion) (28.Osaka M. Rowley J.D. Zeleznik-Le N.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6428-6433Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 29.Taki T. Ohnishi H. Shinohara K. Sako M. Bessho F. Yanagisawa M. Hayashi Y. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4261-4265PubMed Google Scholar). One would predict that SEPT9_v1 should therefore be overexpressed in transformed cells and tumors. Indeed, Scott et al. (30.Scott M. Hyland P.L. McGregor G. Hillan K.J. Russell S.E. Hall P.A. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 4688-4700Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) found consistent overexpression of SEPT9 mRNA in a wide range of human tumors (e.g. breast, central nervous, endometrium, kidney, liver, lung, and ovary) when they studied 7287 fresh frozen human tissue samples and 292 human cell lines. Later on, we described overexpression of SEPT9_v1 protein in multiple human cancer cells (e.g. prostate, breast, colon, and ovary), which was analyzed by Western blotting and was correlated significantly with resistance to microtubule-disrupting agents (15.Amir S. Mabjeesh N.J. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2007; 6: 1926-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Gonzalez et al. (14.Gonzalez M.E. Peterson E.A. Privette L.M. Loffreda-Wren J.L. Kalikin L.M. Petty E.M. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 8554-8564Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) recently have also found that SEPT9_v1 is highly expressed in a majority of primary human breast cancers by immunohistochemistry. Their functional studies in human breast cells showed that SEPT9_v1 accelerates growth kinetics, promotes cell invasion, increases genomic instability in culture manifested by development of aneuploidy, and stimulates morphologic changes associated with de-differentiation in human breast cells (14.Gonzalez M.E. Peterson E.A. Privette L.M. Loffreda-Wren J.L. Kalikin L.M. Petty E.M. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 8554-8564Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These phenotypic increases in tumor invasiveness and metastatic potential could all be mechanistically attributed to the SEPT9_v1 downstream up-regulation of HIF-1. We and others have described up-regulation of HIF-1α in human breast cancer in vitro and in vivo (31.Zhong H. De Marzo A.M. Laughner E. Lim M. Hilton D.A. Zagzag D. Buechler P. Isaacs W.B.

J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2001; 93: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). HIF-1 up-regulation is also associated with lymph node metastasis and micrometastatic implantation in bone metastases (34.Woelfle U. Cloos J. Sauter G. Riethdorf L. Janicke F. van Diest P. Brakenhoff R. Pantel K. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5679-5684PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Hiraga T. Kizaka-Kondoh S. Hirota K. Hiraoka M. Yoneda T. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 4157-4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). It will be of interest to assess whether SEPT9_v1 is contributing to the up-regulation of HIF-1α observed in clinical specimens. HIF-1α-SEPT9_v1 binding was first discovered in human prostate cancer cells (13.Amir S. Wang R. Matzkin H. Simons J.W. Mabjeesh N.J. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 856-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Very recently, Setlur et al. (36.Setlur S.R. Mertz K.D. Hoshida Y. Demichelis F. Lupien M. Perner S. Sboner A. Pawitan Y.

They identified an 87-gene expression signature that distinguishes TMPRSS2-ERG fusion prostate cancer as a discrete molecular entity. SEPT9 had a significantly higher expression in tumors with the TMPRSS2-ERG chromosomal fusions (36.Setlur S.R. Mertz K.D. Hoshida Y. Demichelis F. Lupien M. Perner S. Sboner A. Pawitan Y. Andren O. Johnson L.A. Tang J. Adami H.O. Calza S. Chinnaiyan A.M. Rhodes D. Tomlins S. Fall K. Mucci L.A. Kantoff P.W. Stampfer M.J. Andersson S.O. Varenhorst E. Johansson J.E. Brown M. Golub T.R. Rubin M.A. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2008; 100: 815-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Prostate cancers with the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion appear to have a more aggressive natural clinical history than other prostate cancers (37.Demichelis F. Fall K. Perner S. Andren O. Schmidt F. Setlur S.R. Hoshida Y. Mosquera J.M. Pawitan Y. Lee C. Adami H.O. Mucci L.A. Kantoff P.W. Andersson S.O. Chinnaiyan A.M. Johansson J.E. Rubin M.A. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 4596-4599Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). It is now testable in prostate cancer that part of the downstream effect of TMRSS-ERG chromosomal fusions is SEPT9_v1 activation of HIF-1α in prostate tumorigenesis. To our knowledge, the protective effects of SEPT9_v1 against RACK1 on HIF-1α have not been previously described. Future mechanistic studies to evaluate how SEPT9_v1 affects the fate of other HSP90 clients should provide additional novel insights to the functional roles of SEPT9_v1. Evaluation of SEPT9_v1 protein levels in vivo in prostate cancer and other human cancers appears to be of great interest in evaluating the contribution of SEPT9_v1 in the up-regulation of HIF-1 in human cancers. We appreciate the critical editorial contribution of Rebecca Levine."

Integrin-dependent adhesion is controlled by multiple conformational states that include states with different affinity to the ligand, states with various degrees of molecule unbending, and others. Affinity change and molecule unbending play major roles in the regulation of cell adhesion. The relationship between different conformational states of the integrin is unclear. Here we have used conformationally sensitive antibodies and a small LDV-containing ligand to study the role of the inside-out signaling through formyl peptide receptor and CXCR4 in the regulation of α4β1 integrin conformation. We found that in the absence of ligand, activation by formyl peptide or SDF-1 did not result in a significant exposure of HUTS-21 epitope. Occupancy of the ligand binding pocket without cell activation was sufficient to induce epitope exposure. EC50 for HUTS-21 binding in the presence of LDV was identical to a previously reported ligand equilibrium dissociation constant at rest and after activation. Furthermore, the rate of HUTS-21 binding was also related to the VLA-4 activation state even at saturating ligand concentration. We propose that the unbending of the integrin molecule after guanine nucleotide-binding protein-coupled receptor-induced signaling accounts for the enhanced rate of HUTS-21 binding. Taken together, current results support the existence of multiple conformational states independently regulated by both inside-out signaling and ligand binding.

https://openalex.org/W2079501135,"We have investigated the possible biochemical basis for enhancements in NO production in endothelial cells that have been correlated with agonist- or shear stress-evoked phosphorylation at Ser-1179. We have found that a phosphomimetic substitution at Ser-1179 doubles maximal synthase activity, partially disinhibits cytochrome c reductase activity, and lowers the EC50(Ca2+) values for calmodulin binding and enzyme activation from the control values of 182 ± 2 and 422 ± 22 nm to 116 ± 2 and 300 ± 10 nm. These are similar to the effects of a phosphomimetic substitution at Ser-617 (Tran, Q. K., Leonard, J., Black, D. J., and Persechini, A. (2008) Biochemistry 47, 7557–7566). Although combining substitutions at Ser-617 and Ser-1179 has no additional effect on maximal synthase activity, cooperativity between the two substitutions completely disinhibits reductase activity and further reduces the EC50(Ca2+) values for calmodulin binding and enzyme activation to 77 ± 2 and 130 ± 5 nm. We have confirmed that specific Akt-catalyzed phosphorylation of Ser-617 and Ser-1179 and phosphomimetic substitutions at these positions have similar functional effects.

Each subunit contains a reductase and oxygenase domain (1Masters B.S.S. McMillan K. Sheta E.A. Nishimura J.S. Roman L.J. Martasek P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). A significant difference between the reductase domains in eNOS and nNOS and the homologous P450 reductases is the presence of inserts in these synthase isoforms that appear to maintain them in their inactive states (3Daff S.

Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14841-14849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Ser-1179 is phosphorylated in response to a variety of stimuli, and this has been reliably correlated with enhanced NO production in cells (10Boo Y.C. Jo H. Am. J. Physiol.

Indeed, NO production is elevated in transgenic endothelium expressing an eNOS mutant containing an S1179D substitution, but not in tissue expressing an S1179A mutant (16Scotland R.S. Morales-Ruiz M.

Shear stress or insulin treatment is correlated with Akt-catalyzed phosphorylation of Ser-1179 in endothelial cells, and this is correlated with increased NO production in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (17Dimmeler S.

Akt-catalyzed phosphorylation or an S1179D substitution has also been correlated with increased synthase activity in cell extracts at low intracellular free [Ca2+] (17Dimmeler S. Fleming I.

Increased NO production has also been observed in cells expressing an eNOS mutant containing an S617D substitution, and physiological stimuli such as shear-stress, bradykinin, VEGF, and ATP appear to stimulate Akt-catalyzed phosphorylation of Ser-617 and Ser-1179 (12Mount P.F.

Although S617D eNOS has been reported to have the same maximum activity in vitro as the wild type enzyme (20Michell B.J. Harris M.B. Chen Z.P. Ju H. Venema V.J. Blackstone M.A. Huang W. Venema R.C. Kemp B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42344-42351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), in our hands an S617D substitution increases the maximal CaM-dependent synthase activity of purified mutant enzyme ∼2-fold, partially disinhibits reductase activity, and reduces the EC50(Ca2+) values for CaM binding and enzyme activation (21Tran Q.K. Leonard J. Black D.J. Persechini A. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 7557-7566Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe the effects of a phosphomimetic Asp substitution at Ser-1179 in eNOS on the Ca2+ dependence of CaM binding and CaM-dependent activation of reductase and synthase activities. We also describe the effects on these properties of combining this substitution with one at Ser-617. Finally, we demonstrate that Akt-catalyzed phosphorylation and Asp substitutions at Ser-617 and Ser-1179 have similar functional effects. Our results suggest that phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser-617 and Ser-1179 can substantially increase synthase activity in cells at a typical basal free Ca2+ concentration of 50–100 nm, while single phosphorylations at these sites produce smaller activity increases, and can do so only at higher free Ca2+ concentrations.

Persechini A. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 7557-7566Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Phosphomimetic mutations were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene Inc. La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The primers used to generate the S1179D phosphomimetic mutation were: sense gtatacgtaccgaggacttttccctgcag; antisense: ggcctgatccacgtgcacagac. Primers used to add the S617D phosphomimetic mutation so as to produce the double S617/S1179D substitution have been described previously (21Tran Q.K. Leonard J. Black D.J. Persechini A. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 7557-7566Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The protein-coding regions in all constructs were verified by performing dye terminator DNA sequencing. Expression and purification of wild type and mutant eNOS and wild type CaM have been described in detail elsewhere (21Tran Q.K. Leonard J. Black D.J. Persechini A. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 7557-7566Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In Vitro Phosphorylation of eNOS—Reactions (250 μl) contained 20 μm each of purified wild type eNOS and CaM in 5 mm Mg2+ acetate, 1 mm ATP, 250 μm Ca2+, 100 mm KCl, and 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5 were incubated for 40 min at 25 °C after addition of the indicated amounts of purified human Akt-1 that was activated by incubation with PDK1 and MAPKAPK2 (Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA). Reactions mixtures were then dialyzed for 2 h at 4 °C against 1 liter of 100 mm KCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5. Final eNOS concentrations in dialysates were determined from optical absorbance spectra as described previously (21Tran Q.K. Leonard J. Black D.J. Persechini A. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 7557-7566Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Enzyme prepared in this manner was used in CaM binding and enzyme activity assays. To identify the sites phosphorylated, 20 ng of phosphorylated or control eNOS (incubated in the absence of Akt-1) were subject to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and phosphorylation was assessed by immunoblotting with phosphospecific antibodies. Enzyme samples analyzed by immunoblotting before and after CaM binding experiments exhibited no detectable change in the levels or pattern of phosphorylation (data not shown). Preactivated human Akt-1 and antibodies against phosphoserines at positions 617, 635, and 1179 in bovine eNOS were purchased from Millipore Corp. Immunoblotting procedures were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Bound antibody was detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit and high performance chemiluminescence film as detailed by the manufacturer (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). Densitometric analysis of immunoblots was performed using a flatbed transparency scanner and the Genetools software package (Synoptics Ltd., Cambridge, UK). Quantitation of eNOS Phosphorylation—Quantitation of Akt-catalyzed phosphorylation of eNOS or S617/1179D eNOS was performed as described in detail elsewhere (24King M.M. Fitzgerald T.J. Carlson G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9925-9930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Nadeau O.W. Anderson D.W. Yang Q. Artigues A. Paschall J.E. Wyckoff G.J. McClintock J.L. Carlson G.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 365: 1429-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, phosphorylation reactions (100 μl) contained 20 μm each of purified wild type or S617/1179D eNOS and CaM in 5 mm Mg2+ acetate, 1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Inc., Boston, MA), 250 μm Ca2+, 100 mm KCl, and 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, were incubated for 40 min at 25 °C in the presence of the indicated amounts of preactivated Akt-1. Reactions were terminated by adding SDS electrophoresis sample buffer, and 40 pmol of phosphorylated or control eNOS was subject to SDS gel electrophoresis on 8% polyacrylamide gel slabs. Gel slabs were dried, and bands containing 32P were visualized by autoradiography. Because ∼10% of total phosphate incorporation appeared to be in contaminating protein bands (data not shown), the 130-kDa bands corresponding with eNOS were excised from a second gel stained with Coomassie Blue. Gel slices were solubilized and decolorized by incubation with 0.25 ml of 30% H2O2 for 60 min at 90 °C, and the 32P content of each was quantitated by scintillation counting. Determination of CaM Binding versus [Ca2+] Relationships—Binding of CaM to eNOS as a function of [Ca2+] was determined based on the reduction in the amount of Ca2+-free CaM bound to a fluorescent protein biosensor (BSCaMA) as we have described in detail previously (21Tran Q.K. Leonard J. Black D.J. Persechini A. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 7557-7566Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). At the CaM and BSCaMA concentrations used, the biosensor is less than 50% saturated with CaM, so there is a direct correspondence between the fractional decrease in the amount of CaM bound to the biosensor and the fractional increase in the amount of CaM bound to eNOS. Because eNOS binds Ca2+-CaM with a Kd value below 1 nm (26Tran Q.K. Black D.J. Persechini A. Cell Calcium. 2005; 37: 541-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), at micromolar protein concentrations and a 1:1 molar ratio of eNOS and CaM fractional binding (FB) of CaM to eNOS is related to the BSCaMA fluorescence emission ratio (r = 525 nm/480 nm) in Equation 1, FB≈(R−R0)[(Rmax−Rmin)+2C(Rmax)](Rmax−R0)[(R−Rmin)+C(Rmax+R)](Eq. 1) where Rmax and Rmin are the emission ratios for CaM-free and CaM-saturated BSCaMA, and C = Sb/Sf, where Sf and Sb are the fluorescence emission intensities at 480 nm for CaM-free and CaM-saturated BSCaMA. Corresponding free Ca2+ concentrations were derived from concurrent determinations of indo-1 emission ratios (r = 405 nm/485 nm) in the standard manner as detailed previously (21Tran Q.K. Leonard J. Black D.J. Persechini A. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 7557-7566Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Measurements of BSCaMA and indo-1 fluorescence were performed using a PTI QM-1 fluorometer (New Brunswick, NJ), with respective excitation wavelengths of 430 and 330 nm. Emission and excitation bandwidths were set to 2.5 nm. Reactions containing 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 3 μm indo-1, 5 μm BSCaMA, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 1.25 mm BAPTA, 3.5 μm eNOS, and 3.5 μm CaM were incubated at 22 °C in a stirred 2-ml quartz cuvette. Measurements of BSCaMA and indo-1 fluorescence were made after incremental additions of CaCl2, which produced negligible increases in the reaction volume. Determination of Enzyme Activity versus [Ca2+] Relationships—The Ca2+ dependence for enzyme activation was determined as described previously (21Tran Q.K. Leonard J. Black D.J. Persechini A. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 7557-7566Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), under conditions comparable to those used for analyses of CaM binding. Enzyme activities were derived from linear least-squares fits to time courses for the decrease in NADPH fluorescence emission at 460 nm (340-nm excitation) due to its conversion to NADP+. Free Ca2+ concentrations were derived from concurrent measurements of calcium orange fluorescence emission at 570 nm (550 nm excitation) in the standard manner. Reactions containing 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 40 μm NADPH, 10 μm tetrahydrobiopterin, 50 μm l-arginine, 0.4 μm calcium orange, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 1.25 mm BAPTA, 0.7 μm eNOS, and 0.7 μm CaM were incubated at 22 °C in a stirred 2-ml quartz cuvette. In a typical experiment enzyme activity under nominally Ca2+-free conditions was established, an aliquot of a CaCl2 stock solution was added, and the change in calcium orange fluorescence and rate of NADPH oxidation were measured. These measurements were then repeated after adding another aliquot of CaCl2. Because substrate is rapidly consumed, only 1 or 2 sets of measurements were made, after which 1.5 mm CaCl2 was added, and maximum CaM-dependent activity was established for that experiment. Enzyme activities from each set of measurements are expressed as a fraction of the baseline corrected maximum CaM-dependent activity determined for that experiment. Fractional activities derived from measurements at several different intermediate free Ca2+ concentrations were combined to produce a complete Ca2+ titration curve. NADPH, tetrahydrobiopterin, and l-arginine at the concentrations used do not affect the Ca2+ dependences for CaM binding (data not shown). Analysis of Relationships between CaM Binding or Enzyme Activation and [Ca2+]—EC50(Ca2+) values and cooperativity coefficients were derived from data for fractional CaM binding (FB) or enzyme activation (FA) by non-linear least squares fitting to a simple logistic equation as described previously (21Tran Q.K. Leonard J. Black D.J. Persechini A. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 7557-7566Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). KD values of 230 and 200 nm were derived for Ca2+ binding to indo-1 and calcium orange by calibrating their responses against those of a fluorescent protein Ca2+ indicator that binds Ca2+ via an EF hand pair (27Persechini A. Lynch J.A. Romoser V.A. Cell Calcium. 1997; 22: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Calibration of the indicators in this manner allows the relationships between CaM binding, enzyme activation and [Ca2+] to be quantitatively related according to a previously described sequential model in which formation of the CaM-eNOS complex requires Ca2+ binding to one EF hand pair in CaM, and activation requires binding to both EF hand pairs (21Tran Q.K. Leonard J. Black D.J. Persechini A. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 7557-7566Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). According to this model, fractional CaM binding, FB, is defined in Equation 2, FB=[Ca2+]2(K1K2)+[Ca2+]2(Eq. 2) where K1K2 is the product of the Ca2+ binding constants for the pair of Ca2+-binding sites that control binding. Fractional CaM-dependent enzyme activity, FA, is defined in Equation 3, FA=[Ca2+]4(K1K2)(K3K4)+(K3K4)[Ca2+]2+[Ca2+]4(Eq. 3) where K3K4 is the product of the Ca2+ binding constants for the pair of sites controlling activation. Data sets CaM binding or enzyme activation versus [Ca2+] for native or mutant enzyme were simultaneously fitted to Equations 2 and 3 using the Excel solver to derive the fits shown in Fig. 4, with the K1K2 and K3K4 values listed in Table 2.TABLE 2Parameters derived by simultaneously fitting CaM binding and enzyme activation versus [Ca2+] data to an ordered modeleNOSK1K2K3K4nm2nm2Wild typeaValues taken from Tran et al.

Open table in a new tab Enzyme Activities—The maximum CaM-dependent synthase activities of the S1179D and S617/1179D eNOS mutants are both ∼2-fold higher than the wild type activity (Fig. 1). In the absence of CaM, the wild type and mutant enzymes have activities that are ≤ 15% of the maximum CaM-dependent values. The activity of the S617/1179D mutant appears to be slightly higher than the wild type activity under these conditions (Fig. 1). As seen in Fig. 2A in the absence of CaM the NADPH oxidase activities of the wild type and mutant enzymes are ≤ 25% of the maximum CaM-dependent values. The activities of both mutant proteins are significantly higher than the wild type activity under these conditions, and the activity of the double mutant is also significantly higher than the activity of the single mutant. In the presence of CaM, NADPH oxidase activities determined for the mutant enzymes are ∼2-fold higher than the wild type activity. As previously reported by Gao et al. (28Gao Y.T. Panda S.P. Roman L.J. Martasek P. Ishimura Y. Masters B.S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 7921-7929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), these activity measurements are consistent with an NADPH:NO ratio of ∼2, higher than the value of 1.5 expected based on the catalytic mechanism. This may reflect uncoupled reductase activity or chemical oxidation of NADPH. Despite this discrepancy, the relative NADPH oxidase and synthase activities of the mutant and wild type enzymes are well correlated (Figs. 1 and 2A), supporting our use of the former to determine activity versus [Ca2+] relationships.FIGURE 2A, NADPH oxidase activities of WT eNOS and the indicated mutants determined in the presence and absence of saturating concentrations of Ca2+ and CaM. The reaction buffer contained 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 10 μm BH4, 100 μm DTT, 50 μm NADPH, 250 μm CaCl2, 50 μm l-arginine, and 125 nm eNOS, plus or minus 1.3 μm CaM. B, cytochrome c reductase activities of WT eNOS and the indicated mutants determined in the presence and absence of saturating concentrations of Ca2+ and CaM. The reaction buffer contained 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 50 μm NADPH, 100 μm cytochrome c, 250 μm CaCl2, and 125 nm enzyme, plus or minus 1.3 μm CaM. In both panels, error bars are standard deviations for the mean of six independent determinations made using a minimum of two different enzyme preparations. Minus CaM values indicated by daggers are significantly higher (p < 0.005) than the wild type value, and those indicated by asterisks are significantly higher than the value for S1179D eNOS. Plus CaM values indicated by asterisks are significantly higher (p < 0.005) than the corresponding wild type value. The small difference between the reductase activities of the S617/1179D mutant measured in the presence and absence of CaM presented in panel B is not significant (p = 0.11).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate the effects of phosphomimetic substitutions on the reductase component of eNOS activity, cytochrome c reductase assays were performed (Fig. 2B). As seen with both synthase and NADPH oxidase activities, maximum CaM-dependent reductase activity is increased ∼2-fold by the S1179D or S617/1179D substitution (Fig. 2B). In the absence of CaM, the reductase activity of the S1179D mutant is significantly higher than the wild type enzyme activity, but the double substitution completely disinhibits reductase activity, eliminating its dependence on Ca2+ and CaM (Fig. 2B). In summary, the S1179D substitution increases synthase and reductase activities ∼2-fold in the presence of CaM and partially disinhibits reductase activity, lowering its dependence on CaM. These effects are essentially identical to those produced by an S617D substitution (21Tran Q.K. Leonard J. Black D.J. Persechini A. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 7557-7566Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The double S617/1179D substitution has essentially identical effects on these enzyme activities in the presence of CaM. However, cooperativity between the two substitutions completely disinhibits reductase activity and slightly elevates CaM-independent synthase activity. Relationships among CaM Binding, Enzyme Activation and [Ca2+]—Given stoichiometric amounts of eNOS and CaM at concentrations at least 1000-fold higher than the apparent Kd for the CaM-enzyme complex (26Tran Q.K. Black D.J. Persechini A. Cell Calcium. 2005; 37: 541-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), the dependence of the complex on [Ca2+] is determined by its intrinsic Ca2+ binding properties, or more precisely, the Ca2+ binding properties of CaM bound to eNOS (21Tran Q.K. Leonard J. Black D.J. Persechini A. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 7557-7566Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The intrinsic EC50(Ca2+) values determined under these conditions allow the Ca2+ dependence of different CaM-enzyme complexes to be compared quantitatively. Fits of data for fractional CaM binding (FB) versus [Ca2+] to a logistic equation are presented in Fig. 3A. The EC50(Ca2+) values determined for wild type, S1179D and S617/1179D eNOS are 182 ± 2, 116 ± 2, and 77 ± 2 nm (Table 1). Data for fractional NADPH oxidase activity versus [Ca2+] were determined under conditions similar to those used for binding assays, except for the presence of 10 μm BH4, 40 μm NADPH, and 50 μm l-arginine, which do not significantly affect EC50(Ca2+) values for CaM binding (21Tran Q.K. Leonard J. Black D.J. Persechini A. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 7557-7566Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Fits of these data to a logistic equation are presented in Fig. 3B.

The ability of formins to influence elongation depends on the ability of single formin molecules to remain bound to a growing barbed end through multiple rounds of actin subunit addition (7Higashida C.

To stay associated during subunit addition, a formin molecule must translocate processively on the barbed end as each actin subunit is added (1Goode B.L. Eck M.J. Annu. Rev.

This processive elongation of a barbed end by a formin is terminated when the formin dissociates stochastically from the growing end during translocation (4Kovar D.R. Harris E.S. Mahaffy R.

Nature. 2005; 433: 488-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). In vitro, association of barbed ends with FH2 domains slows elongation by limiting addition of free actin monomers. This “gating” behavior is usually explained by a rapid equilibrium of the FH2-associated end between an open state competent for actin monomer association and a closed state that blocks monomer binding (4Kovar D.R.

Proline-rich FH1 domains located N-terminal to FH2 domains are required for profilin to stimulate formin-mediated elongation. Individual tracks of polyproline in FH1 domains bind 1:1 complexes of profilin-actin and transfer the actin directly to the FH2-associated barbed end to increase processive elongation rates (4Kovar D.R.

Cell. 2006; 21: 455-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Rates of elongation and dissociation from growing barbed ends differ widely for FH1FH2 fragments from different formin homologs (4Kovar D.R. Harris E.S. Mahaffy R. Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. Cell. 2006; 124: 423-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). We understand few aspects of FH1FH2 domains that influence gating, elongation or dissociation. In this study, we examined the source of energy for formin-mediated processive elongation, and the influence of FH2 structure on elongation and dissociation from growing ends. In contrast to previous proposals (6Romero S. Le Clainche C. Didry D. Egile C. Pantaloni D. Carlier M.F. Cell. 2004; 119: 419-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 18Romero S. Didry D. Larquet E. Boisset N. Pantaloni D. Carlier M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 8435-8445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), we found that fast processive elongation mediated by FH1FH2-formins is not driven by energy from the release of the γ-phosphate from ATP-actin filaments. Instead, the data show that the binding of an actin subunit to the barbed end provides the energy for processive elongation. We found that in similar polymerizing conditions, different natural FH2 domains dissociate from growing barbed ends at substantially different rates. We further observed that the length of the flexible linker between the subunits of a FH2 dimer influences dissociation much more than elongation. Molecular Cloning of Recombinant Formins—All formin constructs were generated by standard cloning methods. For all FH1FH2 constructs containing either the Bni1p FH1 domain fused to a heterologous FH2 domain, or the Bni1p-FH2 domain with a heterologous FH2 linker, we generated the open-reading frames by overlap-extension PCR. All constructs were ultimately cloned into either the plasmid pGV67 (gift from B. J. Nolen, University of Oregon, Eugene, OR) for expression with an N-terminal GST tag or pQE70 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) for expression with a C-terminal His6 tag. For detailed description of cloning, see supplemental Experimental Procedures. Protein Purification—All recombinant formins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RP (Stratagene) (5Kovar D.R. Kuhn J.R. Tichy A.L. Pollard T.D. J.

Biol. 2008; 18: 9-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The widely varying concentrations of each formin required to observe both free and formin-associated filaments in the same TIRF microscopy viewing field (Table 2) were likely due to differences in the abilities of these constructs to nucleate new ends. For experiments with quantum dots (Fig. 1), biotinylated molecules of Bni1(FH1FH2)pbio attached to streptavidin-conjugated QDot 625 nanocrystals (Invitrogen Cat. No. A10196, Carlsbad, CA) were imaged separately from actin filaments in a rhodamine-detecting channel as detailed in supplemental Experimental Procedures.TABLE 2Elongation and processivity of forminsFormin constructaAll observations by TIRF microscopy with 1.5 μm actin.

Biol. 2008; 18: 9-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The reported rates are an average of typically at least 6 individual filaments in a viewing field. Average rates of dissociation of formin from growing ends were determined by measuring either the duration of slow barbed end growth (without profilin), or duration of dim fluorescence of a filament (with profilin) (10Paul A.S.

For detailed descriptions of the model and use of software to simulate data, see supplemental Discussion and supplemental Experimental Procedures. Direct Observation of Processive Association of Bni1(FH1FH2)p with Growing Barbed Ends—To confirm processive association of formin molecules with growing ends, we attached S. cerevisiae Bni1(FH1FH2)p with an N-terminal biotin group (Bni1(FH1FH2)pbio) to streptavidin-conjugated fluorescent Quantum Dots (QD) and used two-color TIRF microscopy to observe both growing actin filaments and QDs attached to formins (Fig. 1, supplemental Movies S1 and S2). In these reactions, 25% of the actin monomers were labeled with the fluorescent dye Oregon Green. Without profilin, QDs tracked closely with ends elongating at 6.0 subunits/s, approximately half the rate of apparently free barbed ends growing in the same field at 12.3 subunits/s (Fig. 1A). In the presence of S. cerevisiae profilin, ends associated with individual molecules of QD-Bni1(FH1FH2)pbio were dimmer and grew faster than free filaments in the same field (Fig. 1B). In the presence of profilin and actin labeled with a fluorescent dye on Cys-374 filaments growing in association with FH1FH2 are dimmer than free filaments (4Kovar D.R. Harris E.S. Mahaffy R. Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. Cell. 2006; 124: 423-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 17Vavylonis D. Kovar D.R. O'Shaughnessy B. Pollard T.D. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 455-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The lower fluorescence arises in a mixture of unlabeled and labeled actin, because profilin binds more strongly to the unlabeled actin and FH1FH2-associated ends preferentially incorporate profilin-actin over free actin monomers (10Paul A.S. Pollard T.D. Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 9-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 17Vavylonis D. Kovar D.R. O'Shaughnessy B. Pollard T.D. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 455-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). While other interpretations are possible, our observations indicate that individual formin molecules bound to QDs processively associate with growing barbed ends. Formin and Profilin Do Not Stimulate Release of the γ-Phosphate of ATP from Polymerizing Actin—To examine the energetic requirements of processive elongation of actin filaments with FH1FH2 domains and profilin, we tested the hypothesis that FH1FH2-formins with profilin promote the release of γ-phosphate from ATP-actin filaments (18Romero S. Didry D. Larquet E. Boisset N. Pantaloni D. Carlier M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 8435-8445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We measured the time course of γ-phosphate release into solution during polymerization of 18 μm ATP-actin in the presence or absence of 50 nm Bni1(FH1FH2)p and profilin (Fig. 2). In these experiments, actin with formin polymerized faster than actin alone, showing that formin nucleates filaments in these conditions (Fig. 2). Under the conditions of these experiments, the actin was nearly polymerized by the beginning of data acquisition (dead-time ∼30-45 s), while the half time for release of γ-phosphate into solution was >2.5 min with either Bni1(FH1FH2)p alone, or Bni1(FH1FH2)p with 10 or 50 μm profilin (Fig. 2 and Table 1). For all of these samples, the rate constants for γ-phosphate release of 0.0032-0.0047 s-1 were similar to those rate constants observed previously for the polymerization of ATP-actin alone or ATP-actin with profilin (22Blanchoin L.

While these FH2 domains might be optimized for interaction with the species of actin found in their respective cell types, the use of only one combination of FH1 domain, profilin, and actin throughout our experiments ensured that the observed differences between FH1FH2 constructs arose only from differences in the activities of the FH2 domains. For each of these constructs, we measured by TIRF microscopy the rates of formin-mediated elongation of barbed ends growing in fluorescent actin monomers (typically 33% Oregon Green-labeled) and profilin (Fig. 3 and Table 2).

C5a mediates its effects via its G protein-coupled C5a receptor (C5aR). Although under normal conditions highly beneficial, excessive levels of C5a can be deleterious to the host and have been related to numerous inflammatory diseases. A natural inhibitor of the C5aR is chemotaxis inhibitory protein of Staphylococcus aureus (CHIPS). CHIPS is a 121-residue protein excreted by S. aureus. It binds the N terminus of the C5aR (residues 1-35) with nanomolar affinity and thereby potently inhibits C5a-mediated responses in human leukocytes. Therefore, CHIPS provides a starting point for the development of new anti-inflammatory agents. Two O-sulfated tyrosine residues located at positions 11 and 14 within the C5aR N terminus play a critical role in recognition of C5a, but their role in CHIPS binding has not been established so far. By isothermal titration calorimetry, using synthetic Tyr-11- and Tyr-14-sulfated and non-sulfated C5aR N-terminal peptides, we demonstrate that the sulfate groups are essential for tight binding between the C5aR and CHIPS. In addition, the NMR structure of the complex of CHIPS and a sulfated C5aR N-terminal peptide reveals the precise binding motif as well as the distinct roles of sulfated tyrosine residues sY11 and sY14.

The human complement system is a key component of the innate host defense directed against invading pathogens. Complement component C5a is a 74-residue glycoprotein generated via complement activation by cleavage of the α-chain of its precursor C5. C5a is a strong chemoattractant involved in the recruitment of neutrophils and monocytes, activation of phagocytes, release of granule-based enzymes, and in the generation of oxidants (1Guo R.F. Ward P.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 23: 821-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar, 2Haas P.J. van Strijp J.A.G. Immunol. Res. 2007; 37: 161-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).

Although this is a highly efficient process, excessive or erroneous activation of the C5aR can have deleterious effects on host tissues. C5a has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many inflammatory and immunological diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, immune complex disease, and reperfusion injury (3Heller T. Hennecke M. Baumann U. Gessner J.E. zu Vilsendorf A.M. Baensch M. Boulay F. Kola A. Klos A. Bautsch W. Kohl J. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 985-994PubMed Google Scholar, 4Strachan A.J. Woodruff T.M.

Consequently, there is an active ongoing search for compounds that suppress C5a-mediated inflammatory responses. Chemotaxis inhibitory protein of Staphylococcus aureus (CHIPS) is a 121-residue protein excreted by S. aureus, which efficiently inhibits the activation of neutrophils and monocytes by formylated peptides and C5a (5de Haas C.J.C.

CHIPS specifically binds to the formylated peptide receptor (FPR) and the C5aR with nanomolar affinity (Kd = 35.4 ± 7.7 nm and 1.1 ± 0.2 nm, respectively) (7Postma B. Poppelier M.J. van Galen J.C. Prossnitz E.R. van Strijp J.A. de Haas C.J. van Kessel K.P. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 6994-7001Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), thereby suppressing the inflammatory response of the host. A CHIPS fragment lacking residues 1-30 (designated CHIPS31-121) has the same activity in blocking the C5aR compared with wild-type CHIPS (8Haas P.J. de Haas C.J.C. Poppelier M.J.J.C. van Kessel K.P.M. van Strijp J.A.G. Dijkstra K. Scheek R.M. Fan H. Kruijtzer J.A.W. Liskamp R.M.J. Kemmink J. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 353: 859-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). CHIPS31-121 is a compact protein comprising an α-helix packed onto a four-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet (8Haas P.J. de Haas C.J.C. Poppelier M.J.J.C. van Kessel K.P.M. van Strijp J.A.G. Dijkstra K.

C5a has an entirely different fold (PDB ID code 1KJS) and is comprised of an anti-parallel bundle of four α-helices stabilized by three disulfide bonds (9Zuiderweg E.R.P. Nettesheim D.G.

Proteins. 1997; 28: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Preliminary experiments indicated that CHIPS binds exclusively to the extracellular N-terminal portion of the C5aR (7Postma B. Poppelier M.J. van Galen J.C. Prossnitz E.R. van Strijp J.A. de Haas C.J. van Kessel K.P. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 6994-7001Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In contrast, the binding of C5a by its receptor involves two separate binding sites: C5a residues located in the region between 12-46 (11Chen Z. Zhang X. Gonnella N.C. Pellas T.C. Boyar W.C. Ni F. J.

Pharmacol. 2007; 152: 429-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) bind to a primary binding site partly coinciding with the binding site of CHIPS, while the C terminus of C5a (residues 69-74) binds to the activation domain of the C5aR located in the receptor core (13Gerard C. Gerard N.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 775-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Because of their dissimilarity in sequence and structure, the binding sites of CHIPS and C5a are not identical (11Chen Z. Zhang X. Gonnella N.C. Pellas T.C. Boyar W.C. Ni F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10411-10419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The present working model is that CHIPS interferes with the primary binding site of C5a located at the N terminus of the C5aR, thereby preventing the C-terminal tail of C5a from contacting the activation domain of the C5aR and blocking downstream signaling. Currently, the development of C5aR inhibitors has been focused primarily on mimicking C5a in order to directly interrupt C5a-mediated C5aR signaling (3Heller T. Hennecke M. Baumann U.

Understanding the interactions between CHIPS and the C5aR may provide valuable insights toward the development of new C5aR antagonists. Postma et al. (15Postma B. Kleibeuker W. Poppelier M.J.

Chem. 2005; 280: 2020-2027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) proposed that residues involved in CHIPS binding are located between residues 10-18 of the C5aR. Specifically, the acidic residues Asp-10, Asp-15, and Asp-18 and residue Gly-12 appear to be critical for binding. High affinity binding was observed between 125I-labeled CHIPS and the N-terminal portion of the C5aR (residues 1-38) expressed on the cell surface of HEK293 cells (Kd = 29.7 ± 4.4 nm). In contrast, very moderate affinity between CHIPS and a synthetic C5aR N-terminal peptide (residues 1-37; Kd = 40 ± 19 μm), measured by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), was recently reported by Wright et al. (16Wright A.J. Higginbottom A. Philippe D. Upadhyay A. Bagby S. Read R.C. Monk P.N. Partridge L.J. Mol. Immunol. 2007; 44: 2507-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The discrepancy in the magnitude of these dissociation constants may be explained by the presence of two sulfate groups on tyrosine 11 and 14 of the C5aR N terminus expressed on the cell surface of HEK293 cells, which are absent in the synthetic C5aR peptide utilized by Wright et al. (16Wright A.J. Higginbottom A. Philippe D. Upadhyay A. Bagby S. Read R.C. Monk P.N. Partridge L.J. Mol. Immunol. 2007; 44: 2507-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Farzan et al. (17Farzan M. Schnitzler C.E. Vasilieva N. Leung D. Kuhn J. Gerard C. Gerard N.P. Choe H. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1059-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) stressed the critical role of these sulfate groups in activation of the C5aR by C5a. Previous mutational studies employing FITC-labeled CHIPS, however, suggested that the sulfate groups had only a limited effect on the binding affinity (15Postma B. Kleibeuker W. Poppelier M.J.

To resolve these discrepancies, we set out to chemically synthesize several sulfated and unsulfated peptides representing the N terminus of the human C5aR. We have measured the binding affinities of these peptides to CHIPS31-121 by ITC and used the C5aR peptide with the highest affinity to determine the structure of the complex between CHIPS31-121 and the C5aR N terminus by NMR spectroscopy. Peptide Synthesis—The C5aR peptides (supplemental Table S1) were synthesized on a 433A peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems) applying Fmoc/tBu chemistry according to a method described elsewhere. 4Bunschoten, A., Kruijtzer, J. A. W., Ippel, J. H., de Haas, C. J. C., van Strijp, J. A. G., Kemmink, J., and Liskamp, R. M. J. (2009) Chem. Commun., in press. The final peptides were checked for purity (>98%) and composition by HPLC and mass spectrometry (supplemental Table S1). Peptide concentrations were determined by weight. Protein Production and Purification—Wild type CHIPS31-121 and mutants were cloned and expressed as described before (8Haas P.J. de Haas C.J.C. Poppelier M.J.J.C. van Kessel K.P.M. van Strijp J.A.G.

Inclusion bodies were isolated using CelLytic B Bacterial Cell Lysis/Extraction Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) and lysozyme, according to the manufacturer's description. Inclusion bodies were intensively washed with 0.5% N,N-dimethyldodecylamine N-oxide (Sigma-Aldrich) in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer with 0.5 m NaCl, pH 7.8, pelleted, and solubilized in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing 6 m guanidine. After dialysis in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0 the protein was loaded on a HiTrap SP XL cation exchange column (GE Healthcare BioSciences) and eluted with a 1 m NaCl gradient. Protein-containing fractions were pooled, analyzed on SDS-PAGE for purity, and dialyzed in phosphate-buffered saline. Protein concentrations were determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm in the presence of 8 m urea and using the extinction coefficients obtained from the ExPASy ProtParam tool. ITC Measurements—All ITC measurements were performed at 298 K on a MCS Isothermal Titration Calorimeter (MicroCal). The measuring cell was filled with 1.345 ml of a 26 μm solution of CHIPS31-121 in a 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer at pH 6.5. The syringe was loaded with 250 μl of a 0.5 mm solution of one of the peptides in the same buffer. After each addition of 7.5-15 μl of peptide solution, the heat change due to binding of the added peptide was measured. The data were analyzed using Microcal Origin software and fitted by non-linear regression analysis. Calcium Mobilization—Calcium mobilization studies were performed in Fluo-3-labeled U937/C5aR cells as described (8Haas P.J. de Haas C.J.C. Poppelier M.J.J.C. van Kessel K.P.M. van Strijp J.A.G. Dijkstra K. Scheek R.M. Fan H. Kruijtzer J.A.W. Liskamp R.M.J. Kemmink J. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 353: 859-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The potency of the peptides C5aR7-28 and C5aR7-28S2 to block the CHIPS-inhibiting effect on the C5a-induced calcium mobilization was investigated. Therefore, 10 nm CHIPS31-121 was preincubated with peptides C5aR7-28 and C5aR7-28S2 (3 nm to 10 μm) for 30 min at room temperature. Next, the CHIPS/peptide mixture was added to Fluo-3-labeled U937/C5aR cells for 30 s before 0.3 nm C5a was used as a stimulus for calcium mobilization in the FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). In separate experiments, testing the inhibiting potency of peptides C5aR7-28 and C5aR7-28S2 on the C5a-induced calcium mobilization, 0.3 nm C5a (Sigma-Aldrich) was preincubated with peptides C5aR7-28 and C5aR7-28S2 (3 μm to 300 μm) for 30 min at room temperature before using this C5a/peptide mixture as a stimulus in the flow cytometer. CD Spectroscopy—CD spectra (190-260 nm) were recorded on an Olis RSM1000 spectrophotometer operating at 0.3 nm spectral resolution (slit size 0.2 mm). Samples of wild-type CHIPS31-121 (47 μm) and mutants (46-51 μm) in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) were measured at 298 K using a 0.5-mm cuvette. To gain sufficient S/N ratio multiple scans were summed, with data points averaged by three-point smoothing. NMR Spectroscopy—NMR data were collected on a Varian Inova 500, a Varian Inova 600 MHz, and a Bruker Avance 900 MHz spectrometer. NMR assignments of all the sulfated peptides and unsulfated peptide C5aR10-18, free in solution, are provided in supplemental Tables S2-S5. Assignments of unsulfated peptide C5aR7-28 are similar to the values previously reported by Chen et al. (11Chen Z. Zhang X. Gonnella N.C. Pellas T.C. Boyar W.C. Ni F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10411-10419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) for the C5aR fragment 1-35. NMR experiments of the protein-peptide complexes were recorded on samples containing 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.5), 0.1% (w/v) NaN3 in 5-10% (v/v) D2O/H2O solution at 298 K. A titration study was performed by titrating unlabeled C5aR peptide C5aR7-28S2 to uniformly 15N-labeled CHIPS31-121. The peptide/protein molar ratio ranged between 0-1.31 with a protein concentration of 0.5 mm. Backbone 15N relaxation experiments and experiments for spectral assignments were carried out as described previously (8Haas P.J. de Haas C.J.C. Poppelier M.J.J.C. van Kessel K.P.M. van Strijp J.A.G. Dijkstra K. Scheek R.M. Fan H. Kruijtzer J.A.W. Liskamp R.M.J. Kemmink J. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 353: 859-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) on a sample containing a 1:1 complex of peptide C5aR7-28S2 and uniformly 13C/15N-labeled CHIPS31-121 at a concentration of 1 mm. Chemical shift perturbations observed in this sample were calculated as a weighted sum of 1H, 15N, 13Cα/β chemical shifts changes. Three-dimensional 13C-edited-ω3-filtered NOESY spectra, two-dimensional 13C-15N-filtered TOCSY, and two-dimensional 13C-15N-filtered NOESY spectra were recorded on a sample containing a 1:1 complex of peptide C5aR7-28S2 and uniformly 13C/15N-labeled CHIPS31-121 to assign intermolecular NOEs (see supplemental Experimental Procedures and supplemental Fig. S1). Structure Determination of the CHIPS31-121:C5aR7-28S2 Complex—The structures of both components of the CHIPS31-121: C5aR7-28S2 complex were first calculated separately using the standard Aria1.2/CNS 1.1 simulated annealing protocol (18Linge J.P. Habeck M. Rieping W. Nilges M. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 315-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Subsequently, distance restraint-docking between the experimentally derived peptide structures and CHIPS was performed using the Yasara Structure/Whatif 8.3.3 Twinset software. The flexible docking was based on a set of 568 intermolecular NOE distance restraints derived from various isotope-filtered experiments. The average RMS deviations to the mean structure of the well-defined regions of CHIPS (residues 36-113) and C5aR7-28S2 (residues 10-23) of the final ensemble of 25 refined structures are 0.058 nm for the backbone atoms and 0.089 nm for all heavy atoms. For further details concerning the structure calculations and the final ensemble of structures see supplemental Experimental Procedures and supplemental Table S6. Affinity of C5aR Model Peptides to CHIPS Determined by ITC—In total six sulfated and non-sulfated peptides, serving as models of the N terminus of the human C5aR (Fig. 1), were synthesized and their affinity to CHIPS31-121 was measured by ITC (Table 1). The sequences of these peptides were selected based upon previous studies (15Postma B. Kleibeuker W. Poppelier M.J. Boonstra M. van Kessel K.P. van Strijp J.A. de Haas C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2020-2027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and preliminary NMR experiments. The influence of the two sulfate groups at positions 11 and 14 was tested by comparing the non-sulfated peptides C5aR10-18 and C5aR7-28 with their sulfated counterparts C5aR10-18S2 and C5aR7-28S2. Clearly, the sulfate groups have a substantial influence on binding affinity. Peptide C5aR10-18 did not show any detectable binding, while affinity in the micromolar range was observed for sulfated peptide C5aR10-18S2 (Kd = 15.9 ± 1.4 μm). Sulfation of peptide C5aR7-28 enhanced the affinity to CHIPS more than two orders of magnitude (Table 1). The minimal sequence required for high affinity binding was further investigated by comparing the affinities of sulfated sequences 10-18, 10-24, 7-28, and 1-35, respectively (Table 1). Extension of peptide C5aR10-18S2 with six additional amino acids at the C-terminal side, peptide C5aR10-24S2, resulted in nanomolar binding to CHIPS (Kd = 24.7 ± 0.4 nm). Even stronger binding was observed for peptide C5aR7-28S2 (Kd = 8.4 ± 1.1 nm). The thermodynamic binding parameters of peptide C5aR1-35S2 indicated that the sequence beyond residues 7-28 is not involved in favorable interactions with CHIPS (Table 1). In summary, the ITC data generated for the various peptides revealed that tight binding to CHIPS requires at least residues 10-24 of the C5aR as well as the presence of O-sulfated tyrosine residues. The doubly sulfated peptide C5aR7-28S2 comprises all residues involved in CHIPS binding.TABLE 1Thermodynamic binding parameters of CHIPS31-121:C5aR peptide complexes determined by ITCPeptideKdΔGΔHΔSnmkJ mol−1kJ mol−1J K−1 mol−1C5aR10-18−aNo detectable binding observed in two independent experiments.−−−C5aR7-28(3.2 ± 0.1) × 103−31.3 ± 0.1−78.0 ± 2.5−157 ± 8C5aR10-18S2(15.9 ± 1.4) × 103−27.4 ± 0.2−41.9 ± 3.1−49 ± 10C5aR10-24S2bData from one experiment.

Open table in a new tab Inhibitory Potency of the Peptides C5aR7-28 and C5aR7-28S2—The role of the sulfate groups on bioactivity was investigated by comparing the model peptides C5aR7-28 and C5aR7-28S2 for their ability to compete with the C5aR for binding either CHIPS or C5a. C5a-induced calcium mobilization in a U937/C5aR cell line, stably expressing the C5aR, was used as a functional C5a-dependent activation assay. First, the potency of the C5aR7-28 and C5aR7-28S2 peptides to compete with the binding between CHIPS and the native C5aR was tested. In this experiment 10 nm of CHIPS31-121 was added to the activation assay representing the minimal amount of CHIPS required to completely suppress C5aR activation by C5a. Subsequently, either peptide C5aR7-28 or C5aR7-28S2 was titrated to interfere with CHIPS inhibition, as schematically represented in Fig. 2A. In Fig. 2B it is shown that at concentrations >10 nm, peptide C5aR7-28S2 competes with the native C5aR in binding CHIPS, releasing the C5aR for C5a-induced activation. Next, the inhibitory potency of the C5aR peptides toward C5a was tested, as schematically represented in Fig. 2C. In Fig. 2D it is shown that >10 μm of peptide C5aR7-28S2 is needed to inhibit the C5a-induced calcium mobilization. It is important to note that peptide C5aR7-28S2 does not completely recapitulate the dual binding mode of C5a to its receptor. As a result, the affinity of C5a for C5aR7-28S2 is four orders of magnitude lower compared with its affinity for the native C5aR (Kd = 1 nm) (17Farzan M. Schnitzler C.E. Vasilieva N. Leung D. Kuhn J.

The decrease in relative C5aR activation at C5aR7-28S2 concentrations > 1 μm, observed in the experiment in the presence of CHIPS (Fig. 2B), is due to C5a:C5aR7-28S2 complex formation, in a similar way as observed in the experiment without CHIPS (Fig. 2D). In both experiments, the unsulfated C5aR7-28 peptide was inactive (Fig. 2, B and D). These experiments clearly demonstrate the crucial role of the sulfate moieties in inhibition of the C5aR by CHIPS. NMR Titration and Relaxation Studies—Residue specific information concerning the interactions between the C5aR and CHIPS was derived from NMR experiments. Titration of the unlabeled model peptide C5aR7-28S2, which is unstructured free in solution, to 15N-labeled CHIPS31-121 resulted in perturbation of numerous peaks in the 15N heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) NMR spectrum of CHIPS31-121. Increasing concentrations of C5aR7-28S2 resulted in the disappearance of free CHIPS31-121 peaks and the concomitant appearance of CHIPS31-121:C5aR7-28S2 peaks, compatible with a slow-exchange binding regime (20Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer A.G. Rance M. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Practice. 2nd edition. Elsevier Academic Press, San Diego2007Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). We reassigned the NMR spectra of 13C/15N-labeled CHIPS31-121 in complex with unlabeled C5aR7-28S2 and compared the protein amide 15N-1H and 13Cα/β chemical shifts with those of free CHIPS31-121. A weighted sum of these chemical shift changes was plotted versus residue number (Fig. 3B). Two regions show a relatively large perturbation in backbone and Cβ chemical shifts upon binding: (i) Residues 43-61, which include part of the α-helix and subsequent loop 52-59 and (ii) residues 95-111, which include strands β3 and β4 (Fig. 3C). Previously, we concluded from backbone 15N relaxation measurements (8Haas P.J. de Haas C.J.C. Poppelier M.J.J.C. van Kessel K.P.M. van Strijp J.A.G. Dijkstra K. Scheek R.M. Fan H. Kruijtzer J.A.W.

In the CHIPS31-121: C5aR7-28S2 complex, this loop adopts an ordered conformation as can be concluded from backbone 15N relaxation data (Fig. 4).FIGURE 4Backbone 15N relaxation parameters T1, T2, and heteronuclear {1H}-15N-NOE of free CHIPS31-121 (left) and of the CHIPS31-121:C5aR7-28S2 complex (right) plotted against the residue numbers. The location of the secondary structure elements was derived from the structure of free CHIPS31-121, and is shown at the top of the graph. The data points of T2 and heteronuclear {1H}-15N-NOE concerning the loop between the helix and strand β1 (residues 52-59) are indicated by circles.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Structure of the CHIPS31-121:C5aR7-28S2 Complex—We have determined the structure of the stoichiometric complex of 13C/15N-labeled CHIPS31-121 and unlabeled C5aR7-28S2 by NMR. An overlay of 25 selected low-energy structures of the CHIPS31-121:C5aR7-28S2 complex is presented in Fig. 5A. The structure of CHIPS31-121 in the complex is largely similar to free CHIPS31-121 (Fig. 6). Subtle changes in the structure of CHIPS upon binding include ordering of the helix-strand loop between residues 52-59. The C5aR7-28S2 peptide is wrapped around a large portion of CHIPS31-121 covering a substantial part of its solvent accessible surface area (buried ∼18 nm2 versus total ∼92 nm2). The C5aR7-28S2 peptide, which is a random coil free in solution, clearly adopts a well-defined conformation upon binding pre-organized CHIPS. Essentially, two amino acid stretches of equal size define the binding interface with CHIPS: Residues 10-14 and 19-24 of C5aR7-28S2 form two short β-strands (labeled I and II in Fig. 5A) running in an antiparallel fashion with respect to strand β4 and residues 104-107 of CHIPS31-121. These two stretches are connected by a single turn comprised of residues 15-18. Residues 25-28 of C5aR7-28S2 are disordered in the structural ensemble (Fig. 5A) and do not interact with CHIPS31-121. Residues 7-9 are less well defined compared with the 10-24 core region, probably because of increased conformational freedom.FIGURE 6Side-by-side stereo plot displaying the difference between a representative structure of free CHIPS31-121 (red) (PDB ID code 1XEE.pdb) and the corresponding structure of the CHIPS31-121 protein as part of the CHIPS31-121:C5aR7-28S2 complex (blue). Amino acid side chains of CHIPS31-121 that are important for binding C5aR7-28S2 in the core region between residues 9-24, and that have different orientations in the free and unbound form, are displayed in stick representation. The backbone trace of residues 9-24 of C5aR7-28S2 is displayed in yellow with residues sY11 and sY14 in stick representation. The two models mutually overlay with an RMS deviation of 0.089 nm for the well-defined backbone atoms between residues 36-113. The ensemble average backbone RMS deviation is 0.13 ± 0.02 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Details concerning specific interactions between C5aR7-28S2 and CHIPS31-121 are presented in Fig. 5, B-E. The first stretch of C5aR7-28S2 involved in CHIPS binding includes the two sulfated tyrosine residues Tyr-11 and Tyr-14 (subsequently referred to as sY11 and sY14). sY11 is stacked on top of Tyr-48, with the sulfate group of sY11 neutralized by the positive charge of residues Arg-44 and Lys-51 located in the CHIPS helix (Fig. 5B). sY14 is bound by the loop region 52-59 of CHIPS, while residues Tyr-108 and Lys-100 surround the binding pocket (Fig. 5C). The oxygen atoms of the sulfate group of sY14 are primarily coordinated to the backbone amide protons of Lys-54 and Asn-55 and the side chain amide of Gln-58. Surprisingly, the positively charged side chains of Lys-54 and Lys-100 are only partially positioned within the coordination sphere of the sulfate group of sY14. Instead, these side chains are mostly involved in cationic-π stacking with the aromatic ring of sY14 or in long-range electrostatic interactions. The second stretch of C5aR7-28S2 (residues 19-24) involved in binding is located on the opposite face of the CHIPS molecule near residues 104-107 between strand β3 and β4. This sh"

The thermodynamic properties of the six redox centers, five hemes and a copper ion, in cytochrome cbb3 from Rhodobacter sphaeroides were studied using optical and EPR spectroscopy. The low spin heme b in the catalytic subunit was shown to have the highest midpoint redox potential (Em,7 +418 mV), whereas the three hemes c in the two other subunits titrated with apparent midpoint redox potentials of +351, +320, and +234 mV. The active site high spin heme b3 has a very low potential (Em,7 -59 mV) as opposed to the copper center (CuB), which has a high potential (Em,7 +330 mV). The EPR spectrum of the ferric heme b3 has rhombic symmetry. To explain the origins of the rhombicity, the Glu-383 residue located on the proximal side of heme b3 was mutated to aspartate and to glutamine. The latter mutation caused a 10 nm blue shift in the optical reduced minus oxidized heme b3 spectrum, and a dramatic change of the EPR signal toward more axial symmetry, whereas mutation to aspartate had far less severe consequences. These results strongly suggest that Glu-383 is involved in hydrogen bonding to the proximal His-405 ligand of heme b3, a unique interaction among heme-copper oxidases.

The heme-copper oxidases form a family of enzymes that have structural homology of the catalytic subunit in common (1.Ferguson-Miller S. Babcock G.T. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2889-2907Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). This family of proteins, characterized by six conserved histidine ligands of the redox cofactors, ranges from classical, mitochondrial terminal oxidases to nitric-oxide reductases, and the members have been classified according to evolutionary relationships of their sequences (2.Pereira M.M.

The bacterial cbb3-type cytochrome c oxidases form a distinct, divergent subfamily within the heme-copper oxidases (5.Pitcher R.S. Watmough N.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1655: 388-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Terminal oxidases share the catalytic activity of four-electron reduction of molecular oxygen to water coupled to translocation of protons across the membrane (6.Wikström M.K.

Cytochrome cbb3, expressed in some bacteria as a sole terminal oxidase, is characterized by its ability to maintain catalytic activity under low oxygen tension (8.Preisig O. Zufferey R. Thöny-Meyer L. Appleby C.A. Hennecke H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1532-1538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it has also been shown to have the capacity to translocate protons (9.Raitio M. Wikström M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1186: 100-106Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The Rhodobacter sphaeroides cytochrome cbb3 is encoded by the ccoNOQP operon composed of four genes (10.Toledo-Cuevas M. Barquera B. Gennis R.B. Wikström M. Garcia-Horsman J.A. Biochim. Biophys.

There are altogether four low spin hemes in the enzyme. In addition to a protoheme (heme b) residing in the vicinity of the active site in subunit CcoN, there are three hemes c present in the soluble domains of the two other transmembrane subunits, a monoheme subunit CcoO and a diheme subunit CcoP (11.Garcia-Horsman J.A. Berry E. Shapleigh J.P. Alben J.O. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3113-3119Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). There is yet one more membrane-spanning subunit, CcoQ, without bound cofactors (12.Oh J.I. Kaplan S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16220-16228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Although the catalytic subunit shows homology to the other heme-copper oxidases (13.Zufferey R.

However, subunit CcoO has been shown to have sequence homology with the nitric-oxide reductase subunit NorC (14.van der Oost J. de Boer A.P. de Gier J.W. Zumft W.G. Stouthamer A.H. van Spanning R.J.

Apart from the signatures common to all heme-copper oxidases, the sequence alignments have revealed only very few other conserved residues when terminal oxidases are compared. Even though some amino acids, absent from cytochrome cbb3, have been shown to be of critical importance to the function of the classical heme-copper oxidases, the major functions still remain the same in all of these enzymes. The thermodynamic properties of the cbb3-type oxidases have been investigated sparsely. Apart from work yielding partial information about the properties of the hemes (11.Garcia-Horsman J.A. Berry E.

All the hemes in cytochrome cbb3 were proposed to have high redox potentials, both in the Pseudomonas stutzeri and Bradyrhizobium japonicum enzymes (5.Pitcher R.S. Watmough N.J. Biochim. Biophys.

This is also the case in all other studies, except for the enzyme from Rhodothermus marinus, where two low potential redox centers were reported (25.Pereira M.M. Carita J.N. Anglin R. Saraste M. Teixeira M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the copper center in the active site (CuB).

In the absence of deconvoluted spectral components and thereby clear assignments of the redox centers in the cbb3-type oxidases, and the lack of consensus about their thermodynamic properties, a complete study was required. In this work we have set out to investigate the thermodynamic properties of all the redox centers in cytochrome cbb3 from R. sphaeroides using a combination of optical and EPR redox titrations with the main focus on the details of the catalytic site. This effort will form a basis for further mechanistic studies. Chemicals—The detergent n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside (DDM) was purchased from Anatrace (Maumee, OH), and other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Bacterial Strain, Mutagenesis, and Enzyme Preparation—Mutagenesis was achieved using the M13 template of the ccoNOQP operon as described earlier (22.Sharma V. Puustinen A. Wikström M. Laakkonen L. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5754-5765Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The production and purification of the protein were described in Ref. 30.Rauhamäki V. Baumann M. Soliymani R. Puustinen A. Wikström M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 16135-16140Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar. The enzyme was purified to homogeneity, and the protein samples were exchanged into the buffers needed in each experiment using Amicon ultracentrifugal filter (Millipore) concentrators. Optical Redox Titrations—Anaerobic spectroelectrochemical redox equilibrium titrations were performed using an optically transparent, thin layer electrode cell described in detail previously (31.Bogachev A.V. Bertsova Y.V. Bloch D.A. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 3421-3428Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The measurements were performed in 100 mm potassium phosphate or in 100 mm MES buffers at varying pH values, supplemented with 100 mm K2SO4 and 0.05% DDM. The mediator mixture contained 100 μm ferrocene dimethanol, 100 μm ferrocene ethanol, 100 μm ferrocene methanol, 100 μm pentaaminepyridineruthenium perchlorate, 100 μm hexaamineruthenium chloride, and 1 mm methyl viologen. The redox titrations were performed in both oxidative and reductive directions with the same sample, in the spectral range 350–750 nm at 21 °C. The potential range used was from -300 to +520 mV, and data were collected at 20-mV intervals. The precision of the experiments was ±5 mV. The equilibrium state at each redox potential was determined by optical changes at 425 nm. All potentials were expressed versus normal hydrogen electrode. The data were analyzed by using MATLAB (The Mathworks, South Natick, MA). The redox titrations profiles at selected wavelengths were least squares fitted to a sum of independent 1-electron (n = 1) redox transitions described by a modified Nernst equation (Equation 1), ΔA(λ)=c×5Σi=1∊i(λ)×11+10Eh-Emi59(Eq. 1) where c is the concentration of the sample; ϵi(λ) is the extinction coefficient for the specific redox center at the selected wavelength; Eh is the redox potential of the solution; and Emi is the apparent redox midpoint potential of the transition. EPR Redox Titrations—The electrochemical cell used for redox equilibrium titrations by EPR spectroscopy was described in detail previously (32.Euro L. Bloch D.A. Wikström M. Verkhovsky M.I. Verkhovskaya M. Biochemistry. 2008; 7: 3185-3193Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The redox mediators used were 1 mm benzyl viologen, 200 μm hexaamineruthenium chloride, 100 μm pentaaminepyridineruthenium perchlorate, and 100 μm ferrocene ethanol. The cell was incubated with the mediator mixture in buffer (100 mm MES, pH 6.0, 100 mm K2SO4 supplemented with 0.05% DDM) overnight at low potential (-350 mV) to consume oxygen present within the cell. The sample (300 μl of ∼100 μm enzyme) was loaded and fully reduced at -300 mV to consume traces of oxygen. Titrations were conducted by poising the sample at desired potentials at 21 °C with continuous mixing until the current reached a minimum constant level, after which the sample was frozen in liquid nitrogen, and data were collected. X-band EPR spectra were recorded using a Bruker EMS EPR spectrometer equipped with an Oxford Instruments ESR900 helium flow cryostat together with an ITC4 temperature controller. Spectra at 9.4 GHz were collected at 10 K using a field modulation frequency of 100 kHz, a modulation amplitude of 1.27 millitesla, and a microwave power of 2 milliwatt. The spectra shown are normalized for gain and protein concentration. Optical Redox Titrations—Cytochrome cbb3 contains altogether six redox centers, five hemes and a copper center. According to a hemochrome spectrum, the B- and C-type hemes are present in the ratio 2:3, and the presence of the copper center has been verified using FTIR spectroscopy (11.Garcia-Horsman J.A. Berry E. Shapleigh J.P. Alben J.O. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3113-3119Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Anaerobic optical redox titrations were undertaken to determine the thermodynamic parameters of the redox cofactors. The data obtained from a representative redox titration are presented as the optical changes at different redox potentials versus wavelength using the fully oxidized spectrum as a reference (Fig. 1A). The spectrum at the lowest redox potential (-300 mV) minus the spectrum at the highest potential (+520 mV) was found to equal the reduced minus oxidized spectrum obtained by oxidizing the enzyme with ferricyanide and reducing it anaerobically by dithionite, i.e. full reduction and oxidation were reached in the titrations. The sharp features of the low spin hemes c and b are clearly observed in the α region of the spectra, and the Soret region shows the overlapping bands of all hemes (Fig. 1A). The titrations of the redox cofactors can be followed as the derivative of the optical changes versus the redox potential at each wavelength. In the high potential region (>+100 mV) multiple maxima corresponding to the apparent midpoint potentials of the hemes were observed. The redox changes of the low spin hemes c and b could best be followed in the α region at 550 and 560 nm, respectively. The same redox changes are present also in the Soret region, but here the overlapping bands of the hemes make identification of their origins more demanding. Titration profiles at the earlier mentioned wavelengths are presented in Fig. 1B. The curve at 560 nm shows two well separated components, a single peak both at a high and a low potential. These data can be fitted by two independent theoretical Nernstian n = 1 curves with Em,7 values of +418 ± 3 and -59 ± 2 mV. The extinctions for the α band maxima of the low spin hemes c and b are comparable. This may be used to evaluate the results at different wavelengths because the number of hemes within the enzyme is known. The profile at 550 nm is a sum of several components at high potentials, and at low potentials a single redox transition with Em,7 =-59 mV was observed. The high potential redox transitions at 550 nm were fitted with three independent theoretical Nernstian n = 1 curves with the same extinction as used for fitting the high potential titration at 560 nm. The individual theoretical curves with redox potentials +351 ± 8, +320 ± 7, and +234 ± 5 mV, and their sum, are presented in Fig. 1B; the sum of the three theoretical curves fit the experimental data satisfactorily. A component titrating at a low potential (Em,7 =-59 mV) was observed in both profiles of redox changes. This component could best be followed in the Soret region at 440 nm. The curve can be fitted well with one theoretical Nernstian n = 1 curve in the low potential region, whereas the changes observed in the high potential region originate from the overlapping absorbance bands of low spin hemes. The same titration curves are presented as absorbance changes as a function of redox potential together with the fitted theoretical curves in Fig. 1C. Altogether, five n = 1 Nernstian curves were enough to fit the data well. To identify the redox components from which the optical transitions arise, the data surface was deconvoluted by global fitting using a set of five independent theoretical Nernstian curves with the determined midpoint redox potential values (see above). The redox difference spectra of the individual components are shown in Fig. 1D. The spectrum with sharp peaks at 430 and 560 nm is characteristic of a low spin heme b, whereas the spectrum having peaks at 418 and 550 nm is typical of low spin heme c (for clarity, only the spectrum of one heme c is shown). The spectrum with a Soret maximum at 440 nm and a very broad band at ∼565 nm is typical of a reduced minus oxidized spectrum of a high spin heme, which is why we tentatively assign it to heme b3. We conclude that three types of heme components have been found in the optical titrations, three hemes c, a low spin heme b, and a high spin heme b3. An unusual hysteretic behavior of a small fraction of a heme c was also observed, where the results from the oxidative titration differed from those of the reductive titration. The redox midpoint potential of a fraction of heme c in the latter case was lowered considerably (Em,7 ∼-120 ± 10 mV) compared with that of the former, as shown for 550 nm traces in Fig. 1C. This shift of the midpoint potential, pronounced particularly at high pH (not shown), can be due to a partial change in the heme ligand conformation or other changes in the protein upon the long duration of a titration. Having established the thermodynamic parameters of the hemes, we may ask whether indications of the CuB site are present. As for the aa3-type enzymes, we found no distinct optical signature for this center with sufficiently intense changes of extinction upon oxidoreduction. However, one may attempt to follow the redox changes of CuB indirectly by taking advantage of the very close proximity of the two metal centers in the active site. In the mitochondrial oxidase a ligand to metal charge-transfer (LMCT) band of the ferric high spin heme has been shown to be sensitive to the changes of the reduction state of the copper through the interaction of the ligands of the oxidized redox centers (33.Mitchell R. Mitchell P. Rich P.R. FEBS Lett. 1991; 280: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The optical changes in the LMCT band area of the spectrum upon redox titration are presented in Fig. 2A as a redox difference data surface, where the fully reduced spectrum has been used as a reference to enhance the visibility of all the spectral changes. The LMCT band from the high spin ferric heme can be observed in the domain between 600 and 680 nm, whereas the LMCT band centered near 695 nm arises from the cytochromes c with a methionine residue as an axial ligand (34.Pettigrew G.V. Moore G.R. Rich A. Cytochromes c. Biological Aspects. Springer-Verlag, Cambridge, MA1987: 25Google Scholar). The fully oxidized heme b3 in cytochrome cbb3 has an LMCT band at 622 nm. At a redox potential of ∼+100 mV, the maximum of this band shifts to 645 nm (Fig. 2A). Therefore, the titrations were followed at these two wavelengths (Fig. 2B). The high potential transition at 622 nm is composed of not only changes of the LMCT band of the high spin heme but also those of the α bands of low spin hemes contributing to the changes of absorbance in this spectral region. However, as the majority of the absorbance change at this wavelength originated from the LMCT band of interest, a theoretical n = 1 Nernstian curve with an Em,7 value of +330 mV was plotted to the experimental data yielding an estimate of the redox midpoint potential. Interestingly, the LMCT band maximum red shifts during this transition to the new position at ∼645 nm (Fig. 2A), the titration of which corresponds to that previously assigned to reduction of heme b3 (Fig. 2B), i.e. with an Em,7 of -59 mV (see above). Because of the broad LMCT band, the two positions overlap, and the low potential transition can indeed also be observed at 622 nm (Fig. 2B). Together, these data strongly suggest that the LMCT band of ferric heme b3 is at ∼622 nm when both the heme and the CuB are oxidized, that it shifts to ∼645 nm upon reduction of CuB, and that the latter band vanishes when heme b3 is also reduced. EPR titrations give further support to this assignment (see below). These results demonstrate that the thermodynamic properties of the binuclear site in cytochrome cbb3 are fundamentally different from those of the aa3-type enzymes. Although the redox potential of CuB is relatively high in both instances, the potential of the high spin heme of the active site is very low in the cbb3-type enzyme. Redox titrations were further carried out at different pH values, and the full data on all redox centers are summarized in Table 1.TABLE 1Apparent midpoint redox potentials of the redox cofactors measured at different pH values Data were from optical titrations.

The heme in the binuclear center of the heme-copper oxidases is an example of the latter case, because of its magnetic coupling to the copper ion. Fig. 3A shows the EPR spectra of cytochrome cbb3 fully oxidized by ferricyanide (lower trace) and in the presence of redox mediators at a redox potential +520 mV (middle trace). Two different kinds of EPR spectra arising from low spin ferric hemes are present. The gz ∼ 3.5 peak is broad, and most likely the other components of this signal are too broad to be detected. This spectrum is suggested to arise from a single cytochrome c in the monoheme subunit (35.Pitcher R.S. Cheesman M.R. Watmough N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31474-31483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), whereas the three remaining low spin hemes are presented in the spectra by overlapping spectral component centered at gzyx ∼ 2.96, 2.25, and 1.51. A signal at g ∼ 6 can also be observed in the fully oxidized preparation, which may arise from a small fraction of high spin heme with broken magnetic coupling to copper, or from a low spin heme that has lost its axial ligand. In strongly magnetically coupled systems, an EPR signal appears only in the case of reduction of one of the partners during a redox titration. Therefore, to establish the midpoint redox potentials of the components of the binuclear center, a redox titration of the EPR sample was performed. According to the optical data, all low spin hemes, along with CuB, should be reduced at a redox potential of ∼+100 mV. The EPR spectrum of cytochrome cbb3 at that redox state is presented in Fig. 3A (top trace). According to the prediction from the optical titrations, this is in the area of redox potential where the ferric heme b3 may exhibit maximal EPR signals, because CuB should be reduced and heme b3 should remain oxidized. As clearly shown in Fig. 3A (top trace), all bands in the range below g ∼ 4 disappear, which confirms that the low spin hemes are fully reduced at this state. Instead, two overlapping bands appear at this redox potential, at g ∼ 5.20 and g ∼ 4.95, and an additional band at g ∼ 6.60 becomes more pronounced. Redox titrations followed at the g values 6.60, 5.20, and 4.95 yielded similar titration profiles. Fig. 3B shows the redox potential dependence of the peak at g = 5.20. The experimental data were fitted with two Nernstian n = 1 curves, in which the g = 5.2 feature appears with a midpoint potential of +351 ± 7 mV, and disappears with Em,6 =-60 ± 7 mV. This behavior strongly supports the assignments made on the basis of the optical redox titrations. The rise of the g = 5.2 signal with Em,6 = 351 mV thus results from a break of the magnetic coupling between high spin ferric heme b3 and cupric CuB due to reduction of the latter, and it subsequently vanishes with Em,6 = -60 mV due to reduction of the heme. The feature at g = 5.99, present already in the fully oxidized enzyme, exhibited a different microwave power dependence compared with the other signals in the g = 6 region (not shown). The g = 5.99 signal vanishes completely with an Em,6 of ∼+100 mV (not shown). Therefore, it has no obvious counterpart in the optical redox titrations, which corroborates the conclusion that it represents a small part of the enzyme in which either the magnetic heme b3-CuB interaction is broken, or a small fraction of low spin heme may have become high spin because of a loss of an axial ligand. Properties of the Active Site—The degree of saddling of the high spin hemes can be compared by calculating a percentage of rhombicity from the extent of splitting of the components in the g ∼ 6 region of the EPR spectra as described in Ref. 36.Peisach J. Blumberg W.E. Ogawa S. Rachmilewitz E.A. Oltzik R. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 3342-3355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. According to this classification, the EPR signature of ferric heme b3 in cytochrome cbb3 exhibits ∼10% rhombicity, much higher than in the aa3-type enzymes, and its midpoint redox potential is much lower than that of heme a3. The polypeptide sequence in the vicinity of the active site was searched to pin-point a possible structural reason for these differences. According to sequence alignments of the cbb3-type oxidases, there is a well conserved glutamate residue in helix IX, predicted to lie relatively close to the proximal histidine ligand of heme b3. This glutamate is the only well conserved acidic amino acid residue predicted to lie within the membrane domain (21.Hemp J. Han H. Roh J.H. Kaplan S. Martinez T.J. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 9963-9972Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 22.Sharma V. Puustinen A. Wikström M. Laakkonen L. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5754-5765Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). When this glutamate residue is mutated to an aspartate (E383D), the catalytic activity drops to 1/3 compared with WT, yet retaining full proton translocation capacity, whereas mutation to glutamine (E383Q) leads to virtually complete loss of catalytic activity (22.Sharma V. Puustinen A. Wikström M. Laakkonen L. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5754-5765Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Optical redox titrations were performed with both these variants at pH 6. Although all the other spectral properties remained similar to those of the WT en"

Ema M. Sogawa K. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 20-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). The 5′-flanking promoter region of the mouse AhRR gene contains conserved xenobiotic-responsive element (XRE) sequences, and expression of the AhRR gene is induced by binding of the AhR/Arnt heterodimer to these XREs (2.Baba T.

AhRR forms a heterodimer with Arnt, another bHLH-PAS transcription factor, to inhibit AhR-dependent transactivation of the XRE-driven genes; thus, AhRR participates in a negative feedback loop in the AhR signaling pathway (1.Mimura J.

Recently, we generated AhRR–/– mice, which show higher than wild type levels of ligand-induced expression of the AhR target gene, Cyp1a1 mRNA induction in some tissues (5.Hosoya T. Harada N. Mimura J. Motohashi H. Takahashi S. Nakajima O. Morita M. Kawauchi S. Yamamoto M. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 365: 562-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These mice also displayed a delayed response to skin carcinogenesis caused by benzo[a]pyrene (5.Hosoya T. Harada N. Mimura J. Motohashi H. Takahashi S. Nakajima O. Morita M. Kawauchi S. Yamamoto M. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 365: 562-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Recent work has also demonstrated that AhRR is a tumor suppressor gene (6.Zudaire E. Cuesta N. Murty V. Woodson K. Adams L. Gonzalez N. Martinez A. Narayan G. Kirsch I. Franklin W. Hirsch F. Birrer M. Cuttitta F. J. Clin. Investig. 2008; 118: 640-650PubMed Google Scholar); AhRR mRNA is consistently down-regulated in human malignant tissues from different anatomical origins; furthermore, ectopic expression of AhRR in tumor cells resulted in diminished cell growth (7.Kanno Y. Takane Y. Izawa T. Nakahama T. Inouye Y. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2006; 29: 1254-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and reduced angiogenic potential. These observations provide new insight into the still largely unknown physiological functions of AhRR and form the basis for further studies of its mechanisms of action. We reported previously that AhRR contains a transcriptional repression domain within its C-terminal region (8.Oshima M. Mimura J. Yamamoto M. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 364: 276-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Using the C-terminal region of AhRR as bait, we isolated ANKRA2 (ankyrin repeat, family A, 2) by CytoTrap yeast two-hybrid screening. AhRR was also shown to interact with HDAC4 and HDAC5, and these interactions are important for the transcriptional repression activity of AhRR (8.Oshima M. Mimura J. Yamamoto M. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 364: 276-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMO-1, SUMO-2, and SUMO-3) belong to a family of ubiquitin-like proteins, which are covalently attached to (or detached from) substrate proteins to regulate their functions. The post-translational modification of proteins by SUMO has been increasingly recognized as an important regulatory mechanism in a diverse range of cellular processes. SUMO precursors are processed by SUMO-specific proteases and activated by an E1 enzyme. The activated SUMO is transferred to the E2 conjugating enzyme Ubc9, which recognizes the SUMOylation consensus sequence ψKXE within target proteins. With the help of E3 ligases such as PIAS, the C-terminal glycine of SUMO is covalently linked to the ϵ-amino group of lysine in the SUMOylation consensus sequence of the target proteins (9.Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar, 10.Meulmeester E. Melchior F. Nature. 2008; 452: 709-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In contrast to ubiquitylation, SUMOylation has a wide range of substrate-specific functions and acts via multiple mechanisms, including alterations in the subcellular localization of target proteins, protein stability, protein-protein interactions, and protein-DNA binding activities. Many transcription factors are SUMOylated. In many cases, SUMO modification of transcription factors is associated with transcriptional repression through the suppression of transactivation activity or the enhancement of repression activity. In this study, we report that three lysine residues within the C-terminal repression domain of AhRR can be modified by SUMO-1, resulting in enhancement of its transcriptional repression activity. Plasmids—Constructions of pBOSGAL4DBD-AhRR, pBOSHA-AhRR, pBOSFLAG-ANKRA2, pG3TK-Luc, and plasmids encoding HDAC4-FLAG and HDAC5-FLAG was described previously (8.Oshima M. Mimura J. Yamamoto M. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 364: 276-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). pSG5His-SUMO-1 was generated by fusing full-length human SUMO-1 cDNA with the His tag sequence and cloning into the expression vector pSG5 (Stratagene). pBOSHA-SUMO-1 and pBOSHA-SUMO-2 were generated by ligating the full-length human SUMO-1 or SUMO-2 cDNA with the SmaI site of pBOST7-HA. pBOS-Ubc9 was generated by inserting the EcoRI/SalI fragment of pBSK-mUbc9 into the pEFBOS vector (11.Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1502) Google Scholar) cleaved with EcoRI/SalI. pCMV3xFLAG-AhRR was constructed by ligating the blunt-ended EcoRI/SalI fragment from pBSK-mAhRR with the blunt-ended p3xFLAG-CMV-10 (Sigma). AhRR was cleaved from pBSK-AhRR (8.Oshima M. Mimura J. Yamamoto M. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 364: 276-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) with EcoRI/XhoI, blunt-ended, and subsequently inserted into the EGFP-C3 vector, which was cut with SmaI to generate pEGFP-AhRR. pBOS-AhR, pBOS-Arnt, and pXRE4TK-Luc were described previously (1.Mimura J. Ema M. Sogawa K. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 20-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). To construct pBOSHA-AhR and pBOSHA-Arnt, pBSK-mAhR and pBSK-mArnt (1.Mimura J. Ema M. Sogawa K. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 20-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar) were digested with HindIII/XbaI and NcoI/BamHI, respectively, and the blunt-ended fragments of mAhR and mArnt were ligated with the SmaI site of pBOST7-HA. pBOS3xFLAG-Arnt was described previously (12.Sekine H. Mimura J. Yamamoto M. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37507-37516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Single, double, or triple amino acid mutations in AhRR (K542R, K583R, K660R) or Arnt (K245R) were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-7, Hepa-1c1c7 (Hepa-1), and HeLa cells were maintained, respectively, in high or low glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) under 5.0% CO2 at 37 °C. Transfection was performed using Lipofectamine™ (Invitrogen). Luciferase Assay—Hepa-1, COS-7, or HeLa cells (5.0 × 104 cells/well) were grown in 24-well dishes for 24 h and transfected with the expression plasmids indicated in the figure legends, such as pG3TK-Luc or pXRE4TK-Luc, and the expression plasmids for sea pansy luciferase as an internal control. Cells transfected with pXRE4TK-Luc were treated with 2 μm 3-MC or Me2SO for 12 h. Forty eight h after transfection, the cells were harvested, and luciferase was quantified using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Expressed firefly luciferase activity was normalized to the cotransfected sea pansy luciferase activity, which was used as a standard. Co-immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Analysis—The transfected COS-7 cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer for immunoprecipitation with the anti-HA antibody or in FLAG buffer for immunoprecipitation with the anti-FLAG antibody; buffer contained protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide to preserve the SUMOylation. Whole cell lysates were used for immunoblot analysis either directly or after immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG M2 agarose (Sigma) or anti-HA agarose (Sigma) was performed for 12 h, and the immunoprecipitates were washed according to the published procedure for immunoblot analysis. Immunoblot analysis was performed using anti-FLAG (Sigma), anti-HA (Sigma), anti-SUMO-1 (ALEXIS), anti-Arnt (13.Sogawa K. Nakano R. Kobayashi A. Kikuchi Y. Ohe N. Matsushita N. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1936-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), and anti-AhRR antibodies (8.Oshima M. Mimura J. Yamamoto M. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 364: 276-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Analysis—Hepa-1 cells were cultured to sub-confluency on coverslips and transfected with expression plasmids for EGFP-AhRR (wild type (WT) or 3KR), His-tagged SUMO-1, and Ubc9, with or without Arnt. After 48 h of transfection, cells were incubated with Hoechst DNA stain, and fluorescent images were observed using fluorescence microscopy (magnification ×1,000). Three Evolutionarily Conserved SUMOylation Sites in AhRR—To gain insight into the function of AhRR, we inspected the amino acid sequence of mouse AhRR to identify structural motifs for potential covalent modification sites. We found three SUMOylation consensus sequences at amino acid positions 542, 583, and 660 (Fig. 1A). All of these sequences are located within the repression domain of AhRR (8.Oshima M. Mimura J. Yamamoto M. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 364: 276-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Three SUMOylation sites are well conserved across a broad range of vertebrate species, including mammals and fish (Fig. 1B). Other AhRR C-terminal regions have no obvious sequence conservation, suggesting that the putative SUMOylation motifs play an important role in AhRR transcriptional repression activity. Lysines at Amino Acids 542, 583, and 660 of AhRR Are Modified by SUMO-1—To examine whether these potential SUMO modification sites are actually SUMOylated in vivo, we replaced the three conserved lysines with arginines to create the AhRR 3KR mutant. COS-7 cells were cotransfected with expression plasmids for 3xFLAG-AhRR WT or 3xFLAG-AhRR 3KR, along with His-SUMO-1 and Ubc9. In addition to a band for AhRR (∼80 kDa), Western blotting using anti-FLAG antibodies detected four bands with slower mobilities when 3xFLAG-AhRR WT was cotransfected, presumably corresponding to various SUMOylated AhRRs (Fig. 2A, left panel). These bands were also detected without adding Ubc9, although bands were weaker than those in the presence of added Ubc9 (data not shown). In contrast, when 3xFLAG-AhRR 3KR was cotransfected, no slower mobility bands were observed. When cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibodies, followed by Western blotting using anti-SUMO-1 antibodies, four higher molecular weight bands with the same mobilities were detected (Fig. 2A, right panel). These results indicate that AhRR is actually SUMOylated in vivo, at Lys-542, Lys-583, and Lys-660. We further examined whether these lysines were also modified by SUMO-2, but when the SUMO-2 plasmid was cotransfected, no modified product of AhRR was observed (Fig. 2B). We detected a doublet band of SUMO-2 that was also observed in other reports overexpressing SUMO-2 (14.Gong L. Yeh E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15869-15877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 15.Motohashi H. Katsuoka F. Miyoshi C. Uchimura Y. Saitoh H. Francastel C. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 4652-4663Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), although the reason is not clear. One possible explanation is that a higher molecular weight band corresponds to immature SUMO-2, which produced the mature SUMO-2 (lower band) by cleaving C-terminal 11 amino acids with SUMO-specific proteases (SENPs) (16.Johnson E.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar). Likewise, addition of any of the PIAS family proteins, which are well characterized SUMO E3 ligases, did not result in increased SUMOylation of AhRR (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that AhRR is specifically modified by SUMO-1. We next investigated whether the heterodimer partner Arnt affects the SUMOylation of AhRR. Arnt is also modified by SUMO-1 (17.Tojo M. Matsuzaki K. Minami T. Honda Y. Yasuda H. Chiba T. Saya H. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Nakao M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46576-46585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and we were interested to know how the SUMOylation of each AhRR and Arnt affects that of the other. As shown in Fig. 2C, addition of Arnt significantly enhanced the SUMOylation of AhRR in a dose-dependent manner. Next, to examine whether SUMOylation of Arnt is necessary for enhancement of AhRR SUMOylation, we transfected cells with a plasmid expressing the Arnt K245R mutant plasmid; we observed no difference in AhRR SUMOylation regardless of whether the Arnt WT or K245R mutant was expressed (Fig. 2D). These results indicate that heterodimer formation between Arnt and AhRR, but not Arnt SUMOylation, enhances the SUMOylation of AhRR. Then, we tested whether AhRR was SUMOylated by an endogenous SUMOylation system. When AhRR was expressed in COS-7 cells without exogenous SUMO-1 and Ubc9, four bands, corresponding to the SUMOylated AhRR bands, were also observed (Fig. 2E). Bands were of slightly lower mobility than the His-SUMO-1-modified AhRR because of the His tag (Fig. 2E, lanes 1 and 4). These bands were decreased in intensity when the dominant-negative SUMO-1 mutant with deletion of C-terminal GG residues was cotransfected and disappeared when AhRR 3KR was expressed (Fig. 2E, lanes 2 and 3). Cell extracts of AhRR-transfected COS-7 cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibodies, followed by Western blotting using anti-SUMO-1 antibodies, and four SUMOylated bands were detected (Fig. 2F). These results showed that AhRR was also SUMOylated by the endogenous SUMOylation system. There are three putative SUMOylation sites in the AhRR amino acid sequence, and four SUMOylated bands were detected in the SUMOylation experiment. We were interested to investigate which sites are actually SUMOylated. We generated arginine mutations in the three lysine residues, either alone or in combination, to identify the SUMOylated bands of AhRR. As shown in Fig. 2G, SUMOylated AhRR bands with different mobilities were observed when AhRRs with different Lys-to-Arg mutations were expressed. From the electrophoretic mobilities and the sites of Lys-to-Arg replacement, we were able to attribute the bands to the specifically SUMOylated AhRR species shown in Fig. 2G. Taken together, these results showed that AhRR was mono-, di-, and tri-SUMOylated on Lys-542, Lys-583, and Lys-660, and all of these SUMOylations were significantly enhanced when Arnt was coexpressed with AhRR. SUMO Modification of AhRR Is Important for Its Efficient Transcriptional Repression Activity—Because SUMOylation usually increases the activity of transcriptional repressors, we next examined the effects of SUMOylation on the function of AhRR as a transcriptional repressor. First, we performed a reporter assay using the luciferase gene under the control of the thymidine kinase promoter ligated with GAL4-binding sites (3xGAL-TK-Luc). Transcriptional repression activity of AhRR fused with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (GAL4DBD) was assessed by measuring the luciferase gene expression driven by the thymidine kinase promoter. AhRR WT repressed the luciferase activity dose-dependently, whereas the 3KR mutant of AhRR significantly reduced the repressive activity compared with the WT (Fig. 3A). Expression level of AhRR WT and 3KR were normalized using Western blot analysis (data not shown). Next, we used a luciferase reporter gene driven by four tandemly repeated XREs to assess the repression activity of AhRR. AhRR WT repressed the luciferase expression driven by the XRE sequence to a greater degree than AhRR 3KR (Fig. 3B). For Fig. 3 (A and B), essentially the same results were also observed when SUMO-1 and Ubc9 were not exogenously expressed using HeLa cells (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B, lanes 1–3), indicating that endogenous SUMOylation activity is sufficient for AhRR repression activity. These results indicate that the SUMOylation of AhRR is important for its transcriptional repression activity. To determine the contribution of each of the three lysines to the repressive activity of AhRR, the GAL4 reporter assay was performed using the mutant AhRR-GAL4DBD fusion genes with the Lys-to-Arg mutations in all three lysine positions, either alone or in combination. As shown in Fig. 3C, the SUMOylation of each lysine residue contributes similarly to the repression activity of AhRR. These results indicate that SUMO-1 modification of Lys-542, Lys-583, and Lys-660 more or less contribute equally to the transcriptional repression activity of AhRR. SUMOylation of AhRR Is Required for Interaction of AhRR with Corepressor Components—SUMO modification often regulates the subcellular localization of the target proteins. To examine whether SUMO modification affects nuclear localization of AhRR, we transfected Hepa-1 cells with EGFP-AhRR WT or EGFP-AhRR 3KR and observed their subcellular distributions using fluorescence microscopy. Both EGFP-AhRR WT and EGFP-AhRR 3KR gave a similar diffuse nuclear localization pattern (Fig. 3D, panels a and b). In contrast, coexpression of Arnt markedly changed the subcellular localization of both proteins to a speckled distribution pattern (Fig. 3D, panels c and d), with fewer than 40% of the transfected cells retaining a diffuse pattern. This speckled localization pattern is consistent with the Arnt localization pattern (17.Tojo M. Matsuzaki K. Minami T. Honda Y. Yasuda H. Chiba T. Saya H. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Nakao M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46576-46585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The same results were also observed when SUMO-1 and Ubc9 were not exogenously expressed (data not shown). These results indicate that SUMO-1 modification of AhRR does not affect subcellular localization of AhRR, whereas Arnt alters the subnuclear localization of AhRR to the speckled pattern. SUMO modification is also known to play a key role in protein-protein interaction. Previously, we demonstrated that the C-terminal repression domain, which carries the three SUMO-1 modified lysines, interacts with ANKRA2, HDAC4, and HDAC5; these interactions are important for the repression activity of AhRR. Therefore, we examined whether the SUMOylation of AhRR affects the interaction with ANKRA2, HDAC4, and HDAC5. COS-7 cells were transfected with the HA-tagged AhRR WT or 3KR mutant, along with FLAG-tagged ANKRA2, HDAC4, or HDAC5. The cell extracts prepared from the transfected cells were immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody. ANKRA2 was co-immunoprecipitated with AhRR WT, and HDAC4 was coprecipitated only when ANKRA2 was coexpressed (Fig. 4A, left and right panels, lanes 2 and 4), consistent with the previous report (8.Oshima M. Mimura J. Yamamoto M. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 364: 276-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, when the HA-tagged mutant AhRR 3KR was transfected instead of AhRR WT, immunoprecipitates with an anti-HA antibody detected only a small amount of ANKRA2 and HDAC4 (Fig. 4, A, left and right panels, lane 3, and C), indicating that SUMOylation of AhRR is necessary for efficient interaction with ANKRA2 and HDAC4. As expected, HDAC5 was co-immunoprecipitated with AhRR WT even in the absence of ANKRA2 (Fig. 4B, left and right panels, lanes 2 and 4), but binding of HDAC5 with AhRR 3KR was much reduced (Fig. 4B, left and right panels, lane 3, and C). Taken together, these results show that the SUMOylation of AhRR is necessary for efficient interaction with ANKRA2, HDAC4, and HDAC5, resulting in its increased transcriptional repression activity. AhRR, but Not AhR, Enhances SUMO-1 Modification of Arnt—Arnt forms a heterodimer with AhRR, colocalizes with AhRR in the nucleus, and enhances SUMOylation of AhRR (Figs. 2C and 3D). Arnt was previously reported to be SUMOylated, and SUMOylation of Arnt suppresses GAL4DBD-Arnt-mediated transactivation through dissociation from PML (17.Tojo M. Matsuzaki K. Minami T. Honda Y. Yasuda H. Chiba T. Saya H. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Nakao M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46576-46585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Next, we examined whether AhRR or AhR affects the SUMO modification of Arnt. Plasmid 3xFLAG-tagged Arnt was transiently expressed in COS-7 cells, together with HA-tagged AhRR or HA-tagged AhR, and the SUMOylated Arnt was examined by Western blotting using an anti-Arnt antibody. Although SUMO-1-modified Arnt was barely detected in the absence of AhRR, SUMO-1-modified Arnt was significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner upon addition of AhRR (Fig. 5A, lanes 1–4). The same enhancing effect was observed when AhRR 3KR was cotransfected (Fig. 5A, lanes 5–7). Therefore, regardless of its SUMOylation, AhRR is necessary for enhancement of Arnt SUMOylation. AhR is also a partner molecule of Arnt for heterodimer formation. We were interested in examining how AhR affects the SUMO modification of Arnt. When HA-tagged AhR was coexpressed with Arnt, no enhancement in the SUMOylation of Arnt was observed, even when the ligands of AhR were added (Fig. 5A, lanes 8–13). Thus, AhRR and Arnt mutually enhance the SUMOylation of their partner molecules, which may result in enhancement of the repression activity of the AhRR/Arnt heterodimer. At the same time, these observations raised the question of whether these SUMOylations affect the interaction between AhRR and Arnt. To address this question, COS-7 cells were transfected with expression plasmids for 3xFLAG-tagged AhRR or 3xFLAG-tagged AhRR 3KR, together with HA-tagged Arnt WT or HA-tagged Arnt K245R. Cell extracts were prepared from the transfected cells and immunoprecipitated with anti-HA or anti-FLAG antibodies. No effect of SUMOylation was observed on the interaction between AhRR and Arnt (Fig. 5, B and C, lanes 1 and 2). SUMOylation of Both AhRR and Arnt Is Important for Repressor Activity of the AhRR·Arnt Complex—We next assessed the potential effects of the SUMOylated Arnt on the repressor activity of the AhRR/Arnt heterodimer. Hepa-1 cells were transfected with expression plasmids for GAL4DBD-fused Arnt WT or K245R, together with His-SUMO-1 and Ubc9, and either of AhR, AhRR WT, or 3KR. GAL4DBD-Arnt WT showed an autonomous transactivation activity, and addition of AhR enhanced this transactivation (Fig. 6A, lanes 1–3). When non-SUMOylation mutant Arnt K245R was added, there was no difference in transactivation activity from Arnt WT, in agreement with the observation in Fig. 5A that Arnt was barely SUMOylated under these conditions (Fig. 6A, lanes 2–5). This result is also consistent with the previous report that the SUMOylation of Arnt did not affect the transactivation activity of AhR/Arnt or Hif-1α/Arnt (17.Tojo M. Matsuzaki K. Minami T. Honda Y. Yasuda H. Chiba T. Saya H. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Nakao M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46576-46585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). When we added AhRR WT, the luciferase expression was remarkably reduced, whereas the addition of AhRR 3KR inhibited the expression of luciferase activity to a lesser extent, with the residual luciferase activity significantly higher than with the wild type AhRR (Fig. 6A, lanes 6 and 7). This tendency was more remarkable when both non-SUMOylation mutants of AhRR and Arnt were used (Fig. 6A, lane 9). Next, to further assess the importance of SUMOylation of the AhRR/Arnt heterodimer for its repressor activity, we used a luciferase reporter gene driven by four tandemly repeated XREs. As shown in Fig. 6B, the result was almost the same as that as shown in Fig. 6A. These experiments were also performed without added SUMO-1 and Ubc9 using HeLa cells, which showed essentially the same results (supplemental Fig. S1B). Taken together, these results show that SUMOylation of both AhRR and Arnt is important for the efficient repressor activity of the AhRR/Arnt heterodimer (Fig. 7).FIGURE 7Proposed model for the transcriptional regulation mechanism of the AhR/Arnt activator complex and the AhRR/Arnt repressor complex. Unmodified Arnt forms a heterodimer with AhR and recruits coactivators such as CBP/p300 to form the transcriptional activator complex. Meanwhile, Arnt forms a heterodimer with AhRR, which significantly enhances SUMOylation of both proteins. SUMOylated AhRR recruits corepressors ANKRA2, HDAC4, and HDAC5 to form the transcriptional repressor complex.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) When amino acid sequences of the C-terminal region of AhRR were compared among mammals and fish, three SUMOylation sites including minimal adjacent sequences were revealed to be distinctly conserved (Fig. 1B), suggesting that these sequences are involved in some fundamental biological processes. A newly reported composite motif named PDSM (phosphorylation-dependent SUMOylation motif), which contains the SUMO consensus sequence with an adjacent proline-directed phosphorylation site (ψKXEXXSP) (18.Hietakangas V.

Accelerated SUMOylation of these factors by phosphorylation enhances the repression of transcriptional activity. The SUMOylation site at Lys-660 in mouse AhRR, which is well conserved across species, seems to resemble the SUMO consensus sequence accompanying the proline-directed phosphorylation (ψKXEXXXSP), but its functional analysis remains to be seen. All of the conserved SUMOylation sites of AhRR were found to be SUMOylated more or less equally in our in vivo cell culture system. These SUMOylations in AhRR were significantly enhanced by the presence of Arnt, a partner molecule of the AhRR/Arnt heterodimer. Likewise, Arnt was reported previously to be SUMOylated at Lys-245 (17.Tojo M. Matsuzaki K. Minami T. Honda Y. Yasuda H. Chiba T. Saya H. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Nakao M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46576-46585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar); this SUMOylation was also stimulated by AhRR, but not by AhR, another partner molecule of the transcription-active heterodimer AhR/Anrt. Thus, one of the partner molecules of the AhRR·Arnt repressor complex mutually enhances the SUMOylation of the other (Figs. 2C and 5A). The PIAS proteins are members of a well characterized SUMO E3 ligase family, consisting of PIAS1, PIASxα, PIASxβ, PIASγ, and PIAS3. However, none of the family members added into the cultured cells could enhance the SUMOylation of AhRR (data not shown). Unlike ubiquitin E3 ligases, apparently structurally unrelated proteins can serve as SUMO E3 ligases, providing a scaffold bridging between Ubc9 and SUMOylation substrates. Whereas the PIAS family apparently plays no role in AhRR modification, Arnt could significantly enhance SUMOylation of AhRR, and the reverse is true with respect to Arnt SUMOylation. Because both AhRR (data not shown) and Arnt (17.Tojo M. Matsuzaki K. Minami T. Honda Y. Yasuda H. Chiba T. Saya H. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Nakao M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46576-46585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) interact with Ubc9 and their partner molecules, SUMOylation substrates, it is reasonable to consider that AhRR and Arnt serve as the SUMO E3 ligase to each other. This could be substantiated experimentally by in vitro reconstitution of SUMOylation. Interestingly, it has recently been reported that AhR is able to act as an E3 ubiquitin ligase to estrogen receptors and androgen receptors in a ligand-dependent manner (24.Ohtake F. Baba A. Takada I. Okada M. Iwasaki K. Miki H. Takahashi S. Kouzmenko A. Nohara K. Chiba T. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Kato S. Nature. 2007; 446: 562-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar), indicating the potential role of bHLH-PAS proteins, including AhR, to be able to display an E3 ligase activity with a ubiquitin family protein, in addition to its transcriptional activity. In the nucleus, unmodified Arnt interacts and colocalizes with PML, which enhances the transactivation activity of Arnt; in contrast, SUMOylated Arnt dissociates from PML, resulting in the suppression of Arnt transcription activity in the GAL4DBD-Arnt-mediated transactivation assay (17.Tojo M. Matsuzaki K. Minami T. Honda Y. Yasuda H. Chiba T. Saya H. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Nakao M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46576-46585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In contrast to AhRR, SUMOylation of Arnt is enhanced by PIAS1, and a substantial amount of Arnt is present in the nucleus in SUMOylated form (17.Tojo M. Matsuzaki K. Minami T. Honda Y. Yasuda H. Chiba T. Saya H. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Nakao M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46576-46585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). When AhRR is synthesized and transported into the nucleus through the NLS signal, AhRR may form a heterodimer with Arnt or SUMOylated Arnt, resulting in the enhanced SUMOylation of AhRR in the heterodimer complex. Thus, the SUMOylated AhRR and Arnt complex becomes competent for recruitment of corepressor components such as ANKRA2, HDAC4, and HDAC5. It remains to be investigated whether this series of transcription suppressor complexes are formed directly on the XRE sequence of the target genes or in the nucleoplasm prior to DNA binding. Our previous data showed that treatment of ANKRA2 small interfering RNA resulted in reduction of the AhRR-mediated repression of Cyp1a1 mRNA expression under normal conditions (8.Oshima M. Mimura J. Yamamoto M. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 364: 276-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Because transcriptional inhibition by the AhRR·Arnt complex is reversed by trichostatin A, an inhibitor of histone deacetylase (8.Oshima M. Mimura J. Yamamoto M. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 364: 276-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), not only competitive binding to the XRE sequence, but also the HDAC activity of the AhRR/Arnt heterodimer is involved in repression by the AhRR/Arnt heterodimer. In Figs. 3 and 6, AhRR 3KR also showed some repression activity even if all SUMOylation sites are mutated, which could be explained by the residual interaction of AhRR 3KR with ANKRA2, HDAC4, and HDAC5 or competitive binding mechanisms for the XRE sequence with the AhR/Arnt heterodimer (Figs. 3B and 6B). In this study, we have revealed a novel mechanism of transcriptional repression by the AhRR/Arnt heterodimer involving SUMO-1 modification. Further studies are required to reveal the detailed molecular mechanisms by which AhRR and Arnt are SUMOylated and subsequently recruit the corepressor components, as well as the temporal relationship between these events and the switching on/off of the target genes.

https://openalex.org/W1970468578,"Deinococcus radiodurans is an extraordinarily radioresistant bacterium that is able to repair hundreds of radiation-induced double-stranded DNA breaks. One of the players in this pathway is an X family DNA polymerase (PolX(Dr)). Deletion of PolX(Dr) has been shown to decrease the rate of repair of double-stranded DNA breaks and increase cell sensitivity to gamma-rays. A 3'-->5' exonuclease activity that stops cutting close to DNA loops has also been demonstrated. The present crystal structure of PolX(Dr) solved at 2.46-A resolution reveals that PolX(Dr) has a novel extended conformation in stark contrast to the closed ""right hand"" conformation commonly observed for DNA polymerases. This extended conformation is stabilized by the C-terminal PHP domain, whose putative nuclease active site is obstructed by its interaction with the polymerase domain. The overall conformation and the presence of non standard residues in the active site of the polymerase X domain makes PolX(Dr) the founding member of a novel class of polymerases involved in DNA repair but whose detailed mode of action still remains enigmatic."
https://openalex.org/W2047080538,"SLAT (SWAP-70-like adaptor protein of T cells) is an adaptor protein expressed in cells of the hematopoietic system. SLAT interacts with and alters the function of small GTPase Rac1 in fibroblasts. In these nonhematopoietic models, the SLAT-Rac interaction leads to changes in F-actin and causes cytoskeletal reorganization. In T cells, SLAT expression regulates the development of T helper cells through Cdc42- and Rac1-mediated activation of the NF-AT transcription factor. Here we show that SLAT is expressed in macrophages. Overexpression of SLAT in a macrophage cell line inhibits the IgG Fcγ receptor-mediated phagocytic ability of THP1 cells. In bone marrow-derived macrophages, SLAT protein is recruited to the early phagosomes formed via Fcγ receptor engagement. SLAT recruitment to the phagosome was most efficient when the macrophages express at least one isoform of Rac (Rac1 or Rac2), because SLAT recruitment was reduced in macrophages of Rac-deficient mice. Macrophages derived from animals lacking SLAT show an elevation in the rate of Fcγ receptor-mediated phagocytosis. The absence of SLAT is associated with an increase in the amount of F-actin formed around these phagosomes as well as an increase in the amount of Rac1 protein recruited to the phagosome. Our results suggest that SLAT acts as a gatekeeper for the amount of Rac recruited to the phagosomes formed by Fcγ receptor engagement and thus is able to regulate F-actin re-organization and consequently phagocytosis.

Innate immune cells phagocytose IgG-opsonized particles through the immunoglobulin Fc receptors (FcγRs). 2The abbreviations used are: FcγR, Fcγ receptor; BMM, bone marrow-derived macrophages; F-actin, filamentous actin; fMLP, formyl-Met-Leu-Phe; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; GFP, green fluorescence protein; HBSS, Hanks' buffered salt solution; ITAM, immunotyrosine-based activation motif; M-CSF, macrophage colony-stimulating factor; NRS, normal rabbit serum; SLAT, SWAP-70-like adaptor of T cells; SRBC, sheep red blood cell; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; RBC, red blood cell; PAK, p21-activated kinase; HEK, human embryonic kidney cell. The FcγR-bound particle is engulfed by filamentous actin (F-actin)-mediated extension of plasma membrane leading to internalization of the particle in a membrane-bound vesicle. Phagosomes, the vesicles containing the internalized particle, begin as a phagocytic cup, which is an actin-rich structure containing numerous actin remodeling proteins (1Coppolino M.G. Krause M.

Cell. 2004; 15: 3509-3519Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The phagosome subsequently matures by fusion with primary lysosomes containing hydrolytic enzymes (3Bouvier G. Benoliel A.M. Foa C. Bongrand P. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 55: 729-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Digestion of the particle and its associated protein components leads to processing for subsequent antigen presentation on the cell surface (reviewed in Ref. 4Niedergang F. Chavrier P. Curr. Opin.

FcγR stimulation triggers inflammatory cytokine mRNA and protein by the activation of transcription factors (5Lucas M. Zhang X. Prasanna V. Mosser D.M. J.

Caligiuri M.A. Tridandapani S. Blood. 2006; 108: 718-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Inflammatory cytokine production also requires activation of the p38 module of mitogen-activated protein kinases, which promote mRNA stability (7Winzen R. Kracht M. Ritter B. Wilhelm A. Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Muller M. Gaestel M. Resch K. Holtmann H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4969-4980Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). In neutrophils, FcγR activation also stimulates the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species through the activation of Vav3 (8Utomo A. Cullere X. Glogauer M. Swat W. Mayadas T.N. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 6388-6397Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and the small GTPase Rac2 (9Kim C. Dinauer M.C. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1223-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). There are four distinct murine FcγR proteins as follows: FcγRI, FcγRII, FcγRIII, and FcγRIV (reviewed in Ref. 10Nimmerjahn F. Ravetch J.V. Immunity. 2006; 24: 19-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). These four receptors are divided into two categories, depending on whether the receptor promotes or inhibits innate immune cell activation. The activating or the signal-promoting receptors include FcγRI, FcγRIII, and FcγRIV, all of which associate with a low molecular weight γ chain. The γ chain contains a sequence of amino acids characterized by dual YXX(I/L) motifs and termed the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) (11Taylor L.S. Paul S.P. McVicar D.W. Rev. Immunogenet. 2000; 2: 204-219PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibitory receptor FcγRII does not associate with the γ chain, but it contains a single YXX(I/L) that functions to inhibit cell activation by recruiting phosphatases (11Taylor L.S. Paul S.P. McVicar D.W. Rev. Immunogenet. 2000; 2: 204-219PubMed Google Scholar). Upon phosphorylation of the tyrosine residues within the ITAM motif in the FcR-associated γ chain, the γ chain becomes a docking site for a variety of Src homology 2 domain-containing proteins. The ITAM tyrosines are phosphorylated by one of several members of the Src family of protein-tyrosine kinases (12Duchemin A.M. Anderson C.L. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 865-871PubMed Google Scholar). Then the Src homology 2 domain-containing protein-tyrosine kinases Syk and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (13Cooney D.S. Phee H. Jacob A. Coggeshall K.M. J.

Rho GTPases, especially Rac and Cdc42, are established players in various F-actin-mediated cytoskeletal rearrangements, including the phagocytic cup formation, although their precise role is unclear. Activated (GTP-loaded) Cdc42 appears at actinrich sites within the phagocytic cup, whereas activated Rac1 and -2 appear uniformly around the cup, particularly during cup closure (2Hoppe A.D.

Montcourrier P. Chavrier P. P. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2955-2961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Macrophages of Rac1/2–/– mice show defects in FcγR-mediated phagocytosis but are still able to form the initial phagocytic cup (25Hall A.B. Gakidis M.A. Glogauer M. Wilsbacher J.L. Gao S. Swat W. Brugge J.S. Immunity. 2006; 24: 305-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Thus Rac is required for the late term actin rearrangements needed for FcγR-induced particle internalization but not for the early phase of FcγR-induced cup formation. Despite these findings, the molecular contribution of activated Rac is not understood. Rac (26Glogauer M. Hartwig J. Stossel T. J.

Blood. 2004; 104: 3758-3765Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and Rac1 in particular (28Glogauer M. Marchal C.C. Zhu F. Worku A. Clausen B.E. Foerster I. Marks P. Downey G.P. Dinauer M. Kwiatkowski D.J. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 5652-5657Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) is clearly required for other F-actin rearrangements such as chemotactic migration toward formylated peptides like fMLP. SLAT (SWAP-70-like adaptor in T cells; also known as IBP and Def6) was originally identified in a screen of a myeloid cell line FDCP-Mix A4 for genes differentially expressed during myelopoiesis (29Hotfilder M. Baxendale S. Cross M.A. Sablitzky F. Br. J. Haematol. 1999; 106: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). SLAT/IBP/Def6 (hereafter referred to as SLAT) was found to be highly expressed in interleukin-4-secreting T cells of the Th2 phenotype (30Tanaka Y. Bi K. Kitamura R. Hong S. Altman Y. Matsumoto A. Tabata H. Lebedeva S. Bushway P.J. Altman A. Immunity. 2003; 18: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Structurally, SLAT has an EF hand at the N terminus, a central pleckstrin homology domain, and a Dbl homology-like domain at its C terminus. The pleckstrin homology domain of SLAT displayed affinity for the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase product, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, after SLAT became tyrosine-phosphorylated (31Gupta S. Fanzo J.C. Hu C. Cox D. Jang S.Y. Lee A.E. Greenberg S. Pernis A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43541-43549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). SLAT appeared in the T cell synapse area of contact with antigen-presenting cells (30Tanaka Y. Bi K. Kitamura R. Hong S. Altman Y. Matsumoto A. Tabata H. Lebedeva S. Bushway P.J. Altman A. Immunity. 2003; 18: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and serves to activate the transcription factor NF-AT in a Cdc42- and/or Rac1-dependent manner (32Becart S. Balancio A.J. Charvet C. Feau S. Sedwick C.E. Altman A. Immunity. 2008; 29: 704-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). SLAT is a member of a structurally novel set of Rho family GTPase GEFs that includes SWAP-70 itself (33Shinohara M. Terada Y. Iwamatsu A. Shinohara A. Mochizuki N. Higuchi M. Gotoh Y. Ihara S. Nagata S. Itoh H. Fukui Y. Jessberger R. Nature. 2002; 416: 759-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Indeed, transfection and overexpression of SLAT in COS-7 fibroblasts were able to induce Rac, Cdc42, and RhoA activation, indicated by increased GTP binding of these small GTPases (31Gupta S. Fanzo J.C. Hu C. Cox D. Jang S.Y. Lee A.E. Greenberg S. Pernis A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43541-43549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 34Mavrakis K.J. McKinlay K.J. Jones P. Sablitzky F. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 294: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that SLAT acts upstream of Rac, Rho, and/or Cdc42. However, others show that SLAT was able to bind activated mutants of Rac, Cdc42, and RhoA (35Oka T. Ihara S. Fukui Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 2011-2018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) suggesting that SLAT acts distal to Rho GTPase family members. SLAT has thus far been linked to development and activation of T cells (30Tanaka Y. Bi K. Kitamura R. Hong S. Altman Y. Matsumoto A. Tabata H. Lebedeva S. Bushway P.J. Altman A. Immunity. 2003; 18: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), although it was originally found in a screen of a myeloid cell line (29Hotfilder M. Baxendale S. Cross M.A. Sablitzky F. Br. J. Haematol. 1999; 106: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). SLAT has not been reported to play a role in macrophage biology. This situation prompted us to study SLAT function in FcR-mediated phagocytosis, which involves F-actin reorganization and is mediated by Rho GTPases. Here we show that SLAT is expressed in murine peritoneal and bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM). Overexpression of SLAT in a human macrophage cell line caused a dramatic decrease in FcγR-mediated phagocytosis, suggesting that SLAT acts as a negative regulator of phagocytosis. In wild-type BMM, SLAT was recruited to the early phagosomes upon FcγR engagement. BMM from SLAT-deficient animals showed elevated phagocytosis relative to phagocytosis by wild-type-derived control macrophages. Furthermore, SLAT-deficient BMM showed increased levels of F-actin and increased Rac1 protein recruitment to the early phagosomes. SLAT recruitment to the phagosomes was partially reduced in macrophages of Rac1–/– or Rac2–/– animals and greatly reduced in macrophages of Rac1/2–/– double-deficient animals. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that SLAT modulates the amount of Rac recruited to the phagosomes, which in turn regulates the amount of F-actin reorganization. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found the SLAT-deficient macrophages showed increased migration toward formylated peptide (fMLP), an event that requires Rac and F-actin reorganization (26Glogauer M. Hartwig J. Stossel T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 785-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 27Sun C.X. Downey G.P. Zhu F. Koh A.L. Thang H. Glogauer M.

Hong S. Altman Y. Matsumoto A. Tabata H. Lebedeva S. Bushway P.J. Altman A. Immunity. 2003; 18: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Anti-GAPDH antibody, normal rabbit serum, normal mouse IgG, and normal rabbit IgG was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-Rac1 mouse monoclonal antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Billerica, MA). Cy5-labeled anti-rabbit Ig and Cy5-labeled anti-mouse secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). Alexafluor 660- and Alexafluor 488-conjugated phalloidin and prolong anti-fade solutions were purchased from Molecular Probes (Carlsbad, CA). PKH26 dye, rabbit anti sheep sera, fMLP and polystyrene latex beads were bought from Sigma. Sheep red blood cells were obtained from Colorado Serum Co. (Denver, CO). Recombinant mouse macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) was obtained from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Transwell migration assay plates were obtained from Costar (Corning, NY). Mig vector and Mig vector containing full-length SLAT were used for overexpression experiments in THP1 cells, as described previously (36Vedham V. Phee H. Coggeshall K.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4211-4220Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Phagocytosis measurements were done after sorting GFP-positive transfected cells. Mice—SLAT–/– mice were mated as heterozygous animals and are on C57BL6 background (37Becart S. Charvet C. Canonigo Balancio A.J. De Trez C. Tanaka Y. Duan W. Ware C. Croft M. Altman A. J. Clin. Investig. 2007; 117: 2164-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Wild-type mice with C57BL6 background were either bought from The Jackson Laboratory or were littermates of the heterozygous SLAT–/– breeders. Bones were from conditional Rac1–/– (28Glogauer M. Marchal C.C. Zhu F. Worku A. Clausen B.E. Foerster I. Marks P. Downey G.P. Dinauer M. Kwiatkowski D.J. J.

The Rac deficiency is present only within the myeloid compartment, because of Cre expression driven by the LysM promoter (39Clausen B.E. Burkhardt C. Reith W. Renkawitz R. Forster I. Transgenic Res. 1999; 8: 265-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—Bone marrow was flushed from 4- to 7-week-old wild-type or SLAT knock-out mice tibias and femurs and cultured in M-CSF containing RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine for 7–10 days. BMM were analyzed daily for the presence of cell surface markers by flow cytometry for the presence of mature macrophages in the culture. Cells in culture from day 7 onwards expressed mature macrophage markers F4/80, Mac-1, as well as Fc receptors. BMM from day 7 onwards were used for experiments and were cytokine- and serum-starved for at least 10 h prior to the experiment to reduce the biochemical events associated with signal transduction to resting levels. Western Blots and PCR—Cell lysates were prepared as described (13Cooney D.S. Phee H. Jacob A. Coggeshall K.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 844-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), run on 12% SDS/PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. The filters were blocked with 2.5% dry milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS/Tween), washed in TBS/Tween, and probed with various antibodies described in the text. The filters were washed with TBS/Tween and probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and developed and quantitated using ImageJ software as described (13Cooney D.S. Phee H. Jacob A. Coggeshall K.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 844-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). PCR for SLAT used forward and reverse primers 5′-GGGCTCGAGATGGCCCTGCGC-3′ and 5′-GGGCCTAGGCTAATTCCCTGG-3′, respectively, and 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 2 min. GAPDH used forward and reverse primers 5′-AGTATGACTCCACTCACGGCAA-3′ and 5′-TCTCGCTCCTGGAAGATGGT-3′, respectively, and 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 45 s. PCR products were analyzed on 1% agarose and visualized by ethidium bromide. Phagocytosis Assay—THP1 macrophage cell line or BMM from either wild-type or SLAT–/– mice were allowed to phagocytose sheep red blood cells (SRBCs) labeled with PKH26 dye and opsonized with rabbit antisera as described previously (13Cooney D.S. Phee H. Jacob A. Coggeshall K.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 844-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Uninternalized SRBCs were lysed with NH4Cl buffer (13Cooney D.S. Phee H. Jacob A. Coggeshall K.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 844-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Internalized SRBCs were counted under a fluorescent microscope to calculate percent phagocytic cells as the number of cells taking up at least one SRBC and phagocytic index as the total number of SRBCs per 100 cells, as described (13Cooney D.S. Phee H. Jacob A. Coggeshall K.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 844-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Confocal Microscopy—BMM from wild-type or the various knock-out strains of mice were grown on glass coverslips in 6-well plates overnight. After cytokine and serum starvation, the cells on the coverslips were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) and allowed to phagocytose human IgG-coated, 3-μm diameter latex beads. Following phagocytosis, the coverslips were washed with HBSS to remove the uninternalized beads and immediately immersed in 2% methanol-free formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature to fix the cells. Fixative was removed, and coverslips were washed with HBSS containing 3% fetal bovine serum. Washed coverslips were then immersed in saponin-containing permeabilization buffer for 10 min at room temperature. Primary antibody against the targeted protein as well as phalloidin were diluted in permeabilization buffer and added to the cells on coverslips in a fresh 6-well plate and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Following overnight incubation the coverslips were washed three times in permeabilization buffer and immersed for 1 h at 4 °C in fresh permeabilization buffer containing fluorescently conjugated secondary antibodies. After five washes the coverslips were mounted on to a glass slide using mounting media. Microscopy was done using ×100 objective lens for all the experiments. Rac Assay—We used the procedure that applies GST-p21-activated kinase as described earlier (40Benard V. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13198-13204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were stimulated and lysed as above, and the lysates were incubated with GST-PAK prebound to glutathione-agarose beads. After washing, the beads were incubated with Laemmli SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and the eluted proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE. After the transfer of proteins to a nitrocellulose membrane, Western blotting was performed using a monoclonal antibody to Rac1. The amount of GTP-loaded Rac1 was quantitated by measuring the mass of GTP-Rac1 in comparison to the mass of total Rac1. The value was then normalized to the GTP-Rac1/total Rac1 ratio of unstimulated cells. Chemotaxis Assay—BMM from wild-type, SLAT–/–, or Rac–/– mice were placed in the upper chamber of transwell-permeable support system with 5-μm diameter pore size polycarbonate membrane inserts in a 24-well plate. The lower chamber/well contained either fMLP or M-CSF. The cells were allowed to migrate toward the chemokines for up to 60 min. The inserts were then taken out and immersed in fixative. After washing off the fixative, the cells were stained with Giemsa, and the number of cells having migrated toward the chemokines were counted under a light microscope. Data were represented as the average number of cells from five independent fields. The average number of cells from seven separate experiments are reported as an overall average and standard error. Software—Confocal images were quantified using ipLab software (iVision from Biovision, Exton, PA) from Scanalytics, Inc. For quantification of confocal images, the area surrounding the phagosome was digitally magnified, and the pixels were selected to obtain the mean fluorescence intensity. Average mean fluorescence intensity of at least 20 phagosomes was obtained for each time point and for each genotype. The average fluorescence intensity of 20 phagosomes and standard error is shown in the figures. Band intensity quantification for Western blots was done using ImageJ 1.38X software (National Institutes of Health). Statistical analysis was done using Microsoft Excel software. The significance was determined with the help of Student's t test. p values <0.05 were considered as statistically significant. SLAT was originally identified in a myeloid cell line, but most of the studies on SLAT to date have been done in lymphocytes. We first tested macrophages for expression of SLAT. For this experiment, we prepared macrophages from the bone marrow of C57Bl/6 animals by culturing whole marrow cells in media containing M-CSF. After 7 days the BMM expanded ∼10-fold and expressed Mac-1 (90–95%), F4/80 (90–95%), and FcγRII/III (75–80%) indicating the M-CSF-responsive population was largely macrophages. Additionally, mature ex vivo macrophages were collected by peritoneal lavage of wild-type mice. We prepared whole cell lysates by detergent extraction of the peritoneal and BMM macrophages. We also prepared detergent extracts of cell lines RAW 264.7 (mouse macrophage), THP1 (human macrophages), and Jurkat (human T cells). We used extracts of human embryonic kidney cells (HEK) as a negative control. The lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and probed with antibodies to SLAT and to GAPDH as a loading control. We found (Fig. 1A) that SLAT was expressed in all the hematopoietic cells (peritoneal macrophages, BMM, RAW 264.7, THP1, and Jurkat) but was absent in the HEK cell line. The minor band in HEK cells did not migrate with the SLAT protein, but to ensure its absence we analyzed cDNA by PCR from BMM, RAW cells, and HEK. We used the SLAT plasmid as a positive control. We found (Fig. 1B), like the Western blot result in Fig. 1A, that HEK lacked mRNA encoding SLAT. To quantitate the protein expression level, we determined the ratio of SLAT to GAPDH proteins (Fig. 1C) and found that BMM had approximately the same level of expression as the human T cell line Jurkat. We conclude that BMM and macrophage cell lines express SLAT at a level similar to T cells. Macrophage function requires actin reorganization, and studies in fibroblasts suggested that SLAT regulates actin reorganization through Rac. Therefore, as an initial test of the function of SLAT, we transfected the human macrophage cell line THP1 with vector or with cDNA encoding SLAT. The vector encodes a bicistronic message that includes GFP; thus, the vector- or SLAT-transfected macrophages were sorted to collect the GFP-expressing populations. The cells are 100% viable at the end of the sort, and we observed no change in a propensity toward apoptosis when SLAT is overexpressed. The GFP+ fraction of transfectants was tested for phagocytic ability by incubation with IgG-opsonized sheep red blood cells, which stimulates all IgG receptors. We measured the percent of macrophages that took up at least one RBC (percent phagocytic) and the number of RBCs per 100 macrophages (phagocytic index). Controls were macrophages exposed to unopsonized RBCs and untransfected macrophages incubated with IgG-opsonized RBCs. We found that macrophages overexpressing SLAT had greatly reduced phagocytic ability as measured by percent phagocytic (Fig. 2A) or as phagocytic index (Fig. 2B). These findings suggest that SLAT acts to inhibit phagocytic function. We next examined the subcellular location of SLAT in BMM following an IgG-coated phagocytic stimulus. For these experiments, BMM were prepared by culturing with M-CSF for 7 days. The cells were removed from culture and grown overnight with M-CSF on glass coverslips. The attached cells were starved of M-CSF for 10 h and then incubated with latex beads co"
