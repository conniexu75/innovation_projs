Recent data have shown that misfolded Tau can be internalized by cells in vitro (Frost, B., Jacks, R. L., and Diamond, M. I. (2009) J. Biol. Chem. 284, 12845–12852) and propagate pathology in vivo (Clavaguera, F., Bolmont, T., Crowther, R. A., Abramowski, D., Frank, S., Probst, A., Fraser, G., Stalder, A.

Here we show that recombinant Tau misfolds into low molecular weight (LMW) aggregates prior to assembly into fibrils, and both extracellular LMW Tau aggregates and short fibrils, but not monomers, long fibrils, nor long filaments purified from brain extract are taken up by neurons. Remarkably, misfolded Tau can be internalized at the somatodendritic compartment, or the axon terminals and it can be transported anterogradely, retrogradely, and can enhance tauopathy in vivo. The internalized Tau aggregates co-localize with dextran, a bulk-endocytosis marker, and with the endolysosomal compartments. Our findings demonstrate that exogenous Tau can be taken up by cells, uptake depends on both the conformation and size of the Tau aggregates and once inside cells, Tau can be transported.

Autosomal dominant mutations occur in the MAPT gene of patients with FTD-Tau, establishing a direct causal role for abnormal Tau in the primary tauopathies (5Hutton M. Lendon C.L. Rizzu P. Baker M.

Although mutations that cause AD have not been identified in the MAPT gene, inheritance of one of the Tau haplotypes, MAPT1c, is associated with increased risk of disease (10Myers A.J. Pittman A.M.

One of the most notable and intriguing aspects of Tau pathology in AD is the anatomically defined temporal and spatial spread of NTFs through the brain from a region of initial vulnerability. Studies of human post-mortem brain tissue have shown that NFTs initially form in the somatodendritic compartment of neurons located in the trans-entorhinal cortex (EC) (11Braak H. Braak E. Neuropathological stageing of Alzheimer-related changes.Acta Neuropathol. 1991; 82: 239-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (11554) Google Scholar). With time, NFTs are found in greater abundance within the entorhinal cortex but they also start to accumulate in the hippocampal subfields and limbic areas, followed by the neocortex (11Braak H. Braak E. Neuropathological stageing of Alzheimer-related changes.Acta Neuropathol. 1991; 82: 239-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (11554) Google Scholar). The appearance of pathology in limbic and neocortical association areas correlates with cognitive decline, and it is the density and regional distribution of NFTs, rather than plaques that most closely correlates with cognitive decline in AD. Mapping the anatomical distribution of tangles in post-mortem brain tissue from patients at different stages of AD suggests that affected areas are anatomically connected, and that the pathology may spread from region to region trans-synaptically, in both an anterograde and retrograde direction (11Braak H. Braak E. Neuropathological stageing of Alzheimer-related changes.Acta Neuropathol. 1991; 82: 239-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (11554) Google Scholar, 12Braak H. Thal D.R. Del Tredici K.

Neural Transm. 2011; 118: 809-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This idea was recently tested through the creation of transgenic mice that express a pathological Tau transgene predominantly in the entorhinal cortex (13Liu L. D.V. Wu J.W. Witter M.P. Small S.A.

Tracking the spatial and temporal time course of pathology development in neuroanatomically connected cells demonstrated that there was anterograde spread of pathology out from the entorhinal cortex to hippocampal subfields. Furthermore, the observation of human Tau protein in cells that did not express the human Tau transgene suggested that Tau can transfer transneuronally, including across a synapse. These data supported an earlier study showing that filamentous Tau from mouse brain extract injected into a transgenic mouse with very mild tauopathy could induce the formation of fibrils from endogenously produced Tau, and that mature tangles would form both locally, and at anatomically connected sites distant to the injection site (2Clavaguera F.

Cytoplasmic penetration and persistent infection of mammalian cells by polyglutamine aggregates.Nat. Cell. Biol. 2009; 11: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). An alternative that is especially relevant for Tau is that aggregates may be released into the extracellular space following degeneration of cellular compartments. The observation of “ghost tangles” in the AD brain that represent tangles remaining in the parenchyma after the affected cell has degenerated could be a source of such aggregates. Additionally, the observation of Tau in ISF and CSF in mouse models (28Yamada K. Cirrito J.R. Stewart F.R. Jiang H. Finn M.B. Holmes B.B. Binder L.I. Mandelkow E.M. Diamond M.I. Lee V.M.

Chem. 2012; 287: 3842-3849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar) further suggests that Tau can be released from cells. Recent in vitro studies support the idea of release and internalization of Tau as fibrillar aggregates formed from a highly aggregable region of Tau, the microtubule-binding region (MTBR). Tau can be released from human embryonic kidney (HEK), murine neural progenitor cells (C17.2), and can be internalized by neighboring cells (1Frost B. Jacks R.L. Diamond M.I. Propagation of Tau misfolding from the outside to the inside of a cell.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 12845-12852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar, 18Kfoury N. Holmes B.B. Jiang H. Holtzman D.M. Diamond M.I. Trans-cellular propagation of Tau aggregation by fibrillar species.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 19440-19451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Several unresolved questions of relevance to the in vivo observations of propagation of tauopathy between neuroanatomically connected cells remain, including whether primary neurons can internalize physiologically relevant Tau aggregates, which cellular compartments can internalize Tau, and whether uptake and transport can occur in an anterograde or retrograde direction. Here we have studied the uptake of different conformations of full-length human Tau in primary neurons, the mechanism involved and the transport of Tau aggregates in primary neurons cultured in microfluidic (MF) chambers. These data have been confirmed in a second cell type (HeLa). Herein we demonstrate that full-length Tau readily aggregates into LMW aggregates and fibrils, that only certain aggregates are internalized, and that the primary mechanism is through bulk endocytosis. Uptake can occur not only at the somatodendritic compartment, followed by anterograde transport to axon terminals, but also at axonal terminals followed by retrograde transport to the cell body. Additionally, recombinant Tau aggregates are sufficient to enhance Tau pathology in vivo. These novel findings provide molecular support for observations of pathology spread from post-mortem studies of human AD brains, and mouse models of propagation. Recombinant Tau protein was expressed and purified as previously described (29Lasagna-Reeves C.A. Castillo-Carranza D.L. Guerrero-Muoz M.J. Jackson G.R. Kayed R.

Neurodegener. 2011; 6: 39Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Monomeric Tau (both wild type and mutant Tau with cysteine residues replaced with serine) was obtained by solubilizing Tau in 8 m urea and overnight dialyzing with 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Tau LMW aggregates were prepared by incubating Tau solution (6 μm) at room temperature. Incubation times for Tau small aggregates varied from hours up to 2 days. For fibril assembly, Tau solution (6 μm) was incubated with DTT (Invitrogen), heparin (Invitrogen), and sodium azide (0.02%, Invitrogen) for hours up to several days at room temperature and centrifuged at 14,000 × g. Short filaments were prepared by incubating Tau with DTT and arachidonic acid in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl as previously described (1Frost B. Jacks R.L. Diamond M.I. Propagation of Tau misfolding from the outside to the inside of a cell.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 12845-12852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Formation of Tau LMW aggregates and fibrils was monitored by electron microscopy. Tau monomer and its aggregates were used immediately for cell studies. Tau filaments were purified from 10-month-old rTg4510 transgenic mice as previously described (31Congdon E.E. Wu J.W. Myeku N. Figueroa Y.H. Herman M. Marinec P.S. Gestwicki J.E. Dickey C.A. Yu W.H.

Briefly, brains were homogenized in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, Sigma) (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl (Fisher Scientific), 1 mm EDTA (Fisher Scientific), 50 mm sodium fluoride (Sigma), 1 mm Na3VO (Sigma), supplemented with 1 μg/ml of protease inhibitors (Sigma) and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma). Homogenates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min to remove cellular debris. Protein concentration was determined by BCA assay (Pierce). Aliquots of 200 μg of brain extract homogenate were incubated in 1% Sarkosyl on a rotator for 30 min and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g at 20 °C for 1 h. Pellets enriched in Sarkosyl-insoluble, aggregated Tau filaments were retained, washed, and resuspended in 1× PBS (Invitrogen). The presence of filaments was confirmed by EM analysis. 10 μl of Tau monomer, LMW aggregates, fibrils, and filaments were prepared in sample buffer without reducing reagent or boiling and run on SDS-PAGE BisTris gels (NuPAGE Novex 4–12%, Invitrogen). The resulting gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were then blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% milk for 40 min, probed with human Tau-specific antibody CP27 (Dr. Peter Davies), rabbit anti-Tau (anti-human Tau, 1:5000, Dako), or T22 (anti-Tau oligomers, Dr. Rakez Kayed) overnight at 4 °C and detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated AffiniPure goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (1:10,000, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc.). Immunoreactive bands were visualized by Immobilon Western HRP substrate luminol reagent (Millipore Corp., Billerica) using a Fujifilm LAS3000 imaging system. 1-μl aliquots of Tau monomer, LMW aggregates, and fibrils were adsorbed onto 200 mesh formvar/carbon-coated nickel grids until dry. The grids were washed with water and stained with 2% uranyl acetate. Images were examined and captured on a Phillips CM 12 microscope operated at 65 kV. Size of Tau aggregates was measured and analyzed using ImageJ software (NIH) (32Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Cryosectioning and immunolabeling.Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 2480-2491Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). For ultrathin cryosectioning and immunogold labeling, HeLa cells treated with Tau aggregates were fixed with a mixture of 2% (w/v) paraformaldehyde and 0.125% (w/v) glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Cell pellets were washed with phosphate buffer, embedded in 10% (w/v) gelatin, and infused in 2.3 m sucrose (33Raposo G. Kleijmeer M.J. Posthuma G. Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Herzenberg L.A. Weir D.M. Blackwell C. Weirs Handbook of Experimental Immunology. Blackwell, Malden, MA1997: 208.1Google Scholar). Mounted gelatin blocks were frozen in liquid nitrogen and ultrathin sections were prepared with an EM UC6 ultracryomicrotome (Leica). Ultrathin cryosections were collected with 2% (v/v) methylcellulose, 2.3 m sucrose and single or double immunogold labeled with antibodies and protein A coupled to 5- or 10-nm gold (PAG5 and PAG10) as reported previously (33Raposo G. Kleijmeer M.J. Posthuma G. Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Herzenberg L.A. Weir D.M. Blackwell C. Weirs Handbook of Experimental Immunology. Blackwell, Malden, MA1997: 208.1Google Scholar). Sections were observed under Philips CM-12 electron microscope (FEI; Eindhoven, The Netherlands) and photographed with a Gatan (4k x2.7k) digital camera (Gatan, Inc., Pleasanton, CA). Primary neuronal cultures were prepared and maintained according to Ref. 34Brewer G.J. Torricelli J.R. Evege E.K. Price P.J. Optimized survival of hippocampal neurons in B27-supplemented Neurobasal, a new serum-free medium combination.J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 35: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1905) Google Scholar. All procedures were performed in accordance with recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The protocol was approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of Columbia University. Briefly, hippocampal and cortical neurons were isolated from embryonic day 16–20 C57BL/6 mouse brain. Dissociated neurons were plated and grown in Neurobasal medium supplemented with 2% B27 and l-glutamine at 3 × 106 cells/ml in microfluidic chambers (Xona Microfluidics) mounted on poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips (Corning, Inc.), yielding ∼15,000 cells in the somal side of the chamber. Each microfluidic device contains two compartments connected by a microgroove (450 μm). A 30-μl difference in media volume was maintained between compartments to maintain fluidic isolation between the compartments. Partial medium changes were performed every 3–5 days. Cells were grown for 7–10 days in vitro before experiments. Fluidic isolation was examined by adding Alexa 488 IgG to the somatodendritic compartment of the chamber for 12 h. HeLa and other cell lines were grown in media (DMEM, 10% FBS) supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin. For treatment with Tau, cells were plated at 25,000 cells/well on 8-well Permanox chamber coverslips (Invitrogen) and starved for 2 h prior to addition of Tau. Tau monomer or aggregates were added to either the somatodendritic compartment or to the axonal compartment for uptake and transport studies in neurons. HeLa cells were exposed to Tau for 0 min, 5 min, 1 h,and 12 h, and washed three times prior to fixation for immunofluorescence. For endocytosis studies, fluorescent dextran (Invitrogen) was added to neurons or HeLa cells at 37 °C. Inhibition of endocytosis was obtained by shifting the cells to 4 °C. HeLa cells were subsequently exposed to trypsin (0.25%, Invitrogen) for 1, 3, and 5 min to remove surface-bound Tau aggregates. The resulting detached cells were centrifuged at 1,100 × g for 5 min, re-plated in media, and allowed to recover for 6 h at 37 °C before fixation for immunocytochemistry. Each experiment was repeated at least 3 times. Cells were exposed to Alexa 488-labeled transferrin for 30 min, washed, and analyzed by confocal microscopy. For dynamin and clathrin-specific endocytosis inhibition assays, cells were pre-treated with either 80 μm dynasore (Sigma) or 30 μm Pitstop 2B (Pit2B, Ascent) for 15 min and then transferrin or Tau uptake assays were performed as described previously. Following Tau treatment, neurons and HeLa cells were rinsed three times in PBS, fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at RT, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min, and blocked for 1 h in 5% bovine serum albumin/PBS. Cells were processed simultaneously for immunofluorescence using the following primary antibodies: mouse anti-Tau (CP27, 1:1000, gift of Dr. Peter Davies), rabbit anti-Tau (anti-human Tau, 1:5000, Dako), rabbit anti-β tubulin III (1:1000, Sigma), rabbit anti-rab34 (1:100, Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-rab5 (1:100, Cell Signaling), and rabbit anti-Lamp1 (1:500, Cell Signaling) for 24 h at 4 °C. Fluorescent-conjugated secondary antisera mixtures containing Alexa 488 IgG and Alexa 594 IgG (anti-mouse and anti-rabbit Alexa, Invitrogen Molecular Probes) were used, respectively. Self-quenching protein substrate, DQ-bovine serum albumin (Invitrogen) was added to cells to examine functional lysosomes. Cells were mounted on coverslips with Prolong Gold antifade containing DAPI (Invitrogen).

Previous genetic studies demonstrated that YUCCA (YUC) flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMOs) catalyze a rate-limiting step in auxin biosynthesis and that YUCs are essential for many developmental processes. We proposed that YUCs convert indole-3-pyruvate (IPA) to indole-3-acetate (IAA). However, the exact biochemical mechanism of YUCs has remained elusive. Here we present the biochemical characterization of recombinant Arabidopsis YUC6. Expressed in and purified from Escherichia coli, YUC6 contains FAD as a cofactor, which has peaks at 448 nm and 376 nm in the UV-visible spectrum. We show that YUC6 uses NADPH and oxygen to convert IPA to IAA. The first step of the YUC6-catalyzed reaction is the reduction of the FAD cofactor to FADH(-) by NADPH. Subsequently, FADH(-) reacts with oxygen to form a flavin-C4a-(hydro)peroxy intermediate, which we show has a maximum absorbance at 381 nm in its UV-visible spectrum. The final chemical step is the reaction of the C4a-intermediate with IPA to produce IAA. Although the sequences of the YUC enzymes are related to those of the mammalian FMOs, which oxygenate nucleophilic substrates, YUC6 oxygenates an electrophilic substrate (IPA). Nevertheless, both classes of enzymes form quasi-stable C4a-(hydro)peroxyl FAD intermediates. The YUC6 intermediate has a half-life of ∼20 s whereas that of some FMOs is >30 min. This work reveals the catalytic mechanism of the first known plant flavin monooxygenase and provides a foundation for further investigating how YUC activities are regulated in plants."
https://openalex.org/W1999608050,"The leaves of the white mulberry tree (Morus alba L.) are used worldwide in traditional medicine as anti-diabetics. Various constituents of mulberry leaves, such as iminosugars (i.e. 1-deoxynojirimicin), flavonoids and related compounds, polysaccharides, glycopeptides and ecdysteroids, have been reported to exert anti-diabetic activity, but knowledge about their contribution to the overall activity is limited. The objective of the present work was to determine the in vivo anti-diabetic activity of an extract of mulberry leaves (MA), and to examine to what extent three major constituents, chlorogenic acid, rutin and isoquercitrin, might contribute to the observed activity. Quantities of the three constituents of interest in the extract were determined by using HPLC-DAD. Activity was determined by using a type II diabetic rat model. After 11 days of per os administration of 250 or 750 mg/kg of MA or the corresponding amounts of each individual compound, a dose dependent decrease of non-fasting blood glucose levels were found for MA, chlorogenic acid and rutin, but not for isoquercitrin. Based on our results, chlorogenic acid and rutin might account for as much as half the observed anti-diabetic activity of MA, hence they can be considered as excellent markers for the quality control of mulberry products."
https://openalex.org/W2150421412,"The availability of complete genome sequence of soybean has allowed research community to design the 66 K Affymetrix Soybean Array GeneChip for genome-wide expression profiling of soybean. In this study, we carried out microarray analysis of leaf tissues of soybean plants, which were subjected to drought stress from late vegetative V6 and from full bloom reproductive R2 stages. Our data analyses showed that out of 46093 soybean genes, which were predicted with high confidence among approximately 66000 putative genes, 41059 genes could be assigned with a known function. Using the criteria of a ratio change > = 2 and a q-value<0.05, we identified 1458 and 1818 upregulated and 1582 and 1688 downregulated genes in drought-stressed V6 and R2 leaves, respectively. These datasets were classified into 19 most abundant biological categories with similar proportions. There were only 612 and 463 genes that were overlapped among the upregulated and downregulated genes, respectively, in both stages, suggesting that both conserved and unconserved pathways might be involved in regulation of drought response in different stages of plant development. A comparative expression analysis using our datasets and that of drought stressed Arabidopsis leaves revealed the existence of both conserved and species-specific mechanisms that regulate drought responses. Many upregulated genes encode either regulatory proteins, such as transcription factors, including those with high homology to Arabidopsis DREB, NAC, AREB and ZAT/STZ transcription factors, kinases and two-component system members, or functional proteins, e.g. late embryogenesis-abundant proteins, glycosyltransferases, glycoside hydrolases, defensins and glyoxalase I family proteins. A detailed analysis of the GmNAC family and the hormone-related gene category showed that expression of many GmNAC and hormone-related genes was altered by drought in V6 and/or R2 leaves. Additionally, the downregulation of many photosynthesis-related genes, which contribute to growth retardation under drought stress, may serve as an adaptive mechanism for plant survival. This study has identified excellent drought-responsive candidate genes for in-depth characterization and future development of improved drought-tolerant transgenic soybeans."
https://openalex.org/W2082465697,"Malaria control programs are being jeopardized by the spread of insecticide resistance in mosquito vector populations. The situation in Burkina Faso is emblematic with Anopheles gambiae populations showing high levels of resistance to most available compounds. Although the frequency of insecticide target-site mutations including knockdown resistance (kdr) and insensitive acetylcholinesterase (Ace-1(R)) alleles has been regularly monitored in the area, it is not known whether detoxifying enzymes contribute to the diversity of resistance phenotypes observed in the field. Here, we propose an update on the phenotypic diversity of insecticide resistance in An. gambiae populations sampled from 10 sites in Burkina Faso in 2010. Susceptibility to deltamethrin, permethrin, DDT, bendiocarb and fenithrotion was assessed. Test specimens (N = 30 per locality) were identified to species and molecular form and their genotype at the kdr and Ace-1 loci was determined. Detoxifying enzymes activities including non-specific esterases (NSEs), oxydases (cytochrome P450) and Glutathione S-Transferases (GSTs) were measured on single mosquitoes (N = 50) from each test locality and compared with the An. gambiae Kisumu susceptible reference strain. In all sites, mosquitoes demonstrated multiple resistance phenotypes, showing reduced mortality to several insecticidal compounds at the same time, although with considerable site-to-site variation. Both the kdr 1014L and Ace-1(R) 119S resistant alleles were detected in the M and the S forms of An. gambiae, and were found together in specimens of the S form. Variation in detoxifying enzyme activities was observed within and between vector populations. Elevated levels of NSEs and GSTs were widespread, suggesting multiple resistance mechanisms segregate within An. gambiae populations from this country. By documenting the extent and diversity of insecticide resistance phenotypes and the putative combination of their underlying mechanisms in An. gambiae mosquitoes, our work prompts for new alternative strategies to be urgently developed for the control of major malaria vectors in Burkina Faso."

Inflammation is known to be a major contributor to atherogenesis. Previous studies provide promising evidence in support of the role of miRNAs in cardiovascular disease. However, mechanistic data on these small molecules in atherosclerosis (AS) are still missing. The present study aims to investigate the potential role of miRNAs in AS.The miRNA transcriptase was verified by TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction assay. Thoracic aorta samples were obtained from Apolipoprotein E knockout mice, and plasma samples were from coronary artery disease (CAD) patients. The results showed that the miR-155 level was the most significantly elevated both in AS mice and CAD patients relative to the normal control. The functional role of miR-155 in the atherosclerotic path physiological process was also observed in vivo and in vitro. The observations suggested that miR-155 is a part of a negative feedback loop, which down-modulates inflammatory cytokine production and decreases AS progression. miR-155 was also found to mediate the inflammatory response and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway by targeting mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 10.miR-155 contributes to the prevention of AS development and progression.

https://openalex.org/W1999080341,"Purpose To study the ability of volumetric spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) to perform quantitative measurement of the choroidal vasculature in vivo. Methods Choroidal vascular density and vessel size were quantified using en face choroidal scans from various depths below the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) in 58 eyes of 58 patients with either epiretinal membranes (ERM), early age-related macular degeneration (AMD), or reticular pseudo-drusen (RPD). For each patient, we used the macular volume scan (6×6 mm cube) for vessel quantification, while high-definition (HD) cross-section raster scans were used to qualitatively assess vascularity of the choroidal sub-layers, and measure choroidal thickness. Results Of the 58 patients, more were female (66% versus 34% male), of whom 14 (24%) had ERM, 11 (19%) early AMD, and 33 (57%) RPD. Compared to intact choriocapillaris in all ERM (100%), none of the RPD and only 5/11 (45%) early AMD eyes had visible choriocapillaris on either cross section or C-scans (p-value<0.001). When comparing select regions from the most superficial C-scans, early AMD group had lowest vascular density and RPD had highest (p-value 0.04). Qualitative evaluation of C-scans from all three groups revealed a more granular appearance of the choriocapillaris in ERM versus increased stroma and larger vessels in the RPD eyes. Conclusions SD-OCT can be used to qualitatively and quantitatively assess choroidal vascularity in vivo. Our findings correlate to previously reported histopathologic studies. Lack of choriocapillaris on HD cross-sections or C-scans in all RPD and about half of early AMD eyes suggests earlier choroidal involvement in AMD and specifically, RPD."
https://openalex.org/W2098331662,"We have used a peptide-based targeting system to improve lysosomal delivery of acid α-glucosidase (GAA), the enzyme deficient in patients with Pompe disease. Human GAA was fused to the glycosylation-independent lysosomal targeting (GILT) tag, which contains a portion of insulin-like growth factor II, to create an active, chimeric enzyme with high affinity for the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor. GILT-tagged GAA was taken up by L6 myoblasts about 25-fold more efficiently than was recombinant human GAA (rhGAA). Once delivered to the lysosome, the mature form of GILT-tagged GAA was indistinguishable from rhGAA and persisted with a half-life indistinguishable from rhGAA. GILT-tagged GAA was significantly more effective than rhGAA in clearing glycogen from numerous skeletal muscle tissues in the Pompe mouse model. The GILT-tagged GAA enzyme may provide an improved enzyme replacement therapy for Pompe disease patients."

Thus, exploring the vitamin D tumor suppressive functional mechanism can facilitate improvement of its clinical application.

Mechanistic dissection revealed that 1,25-VD-induced miR-98 is mediated through both a direct mechanism, enhancing the VDR binding response element in the promoter region of miR-98, and an indirect mechanism, down-regulating LIN-28 expression. Knockdown of miR-98 led to a reduction of 1,25-VD anti-growth effect and overexpression of miR-98 suppressed the LNCaP cells growth via inducing G2/M arrest.

The fact that one single miRNA can control hundreds of target mRNAs is striking and makes miRNAs as powerful as transcription factors in regulating whole cell proteomes. The multifaceted roles of miRNAs in cancer, including PCa, have gained increasing appreciation after recently accumulated evidence. More importantly, miRNA roles in influencing cancer biology, including proliferation, apoptosis, and invasiveness, have proven indispensable.

The idea of targeting miRNAs in PCa therapy has been pre-clinically tested and showed promising results. Exploiting miRNAs in improving the efficacy of current therapy could broaden the strategies for battling advanced PCa. The roles of miRNAs in mediating the vitamin D anti-tumor action remain unclear and demand investigation. It was reported that VDR level is repressed by miR-125b, thus overexpression of miR-125b attenuates the anti-tumor effect of 1,25-VD (18Mohri T. Nakajima M. Takagi S. Komagata S. Yokoi T.

To identify which miRNAs participate in the anti-tumor effect of vitamin D, we profiled miRNAs expression by microarray in the 1,25-VD-treated PCa cell line, LNCaP, and validated that miR-98, a tumor suppressive miRNA, is regulated by 1,25-VD. We further discovered the dysregulation of miRNAs expression in vitamin D resistant LNCaP sublines. Modulation of miR-98 affects the anti-tumor effect of vitamin D suggesting that miR-98 can be a potential target for developing therapies for PCa.

Cells were seeded on 6-well dishes at a density of 104 cells/well. Cells were treated with EtOH or 1,25-VD of different concentration every other day. Two weeks after treatment, colonies were fixed and stained by crystal violet. After taking images by Chemidoc (Bio-Rad), colonies were counted by QuantityOne software (Bio-Rad). ChIP assays were performed according to a previous publication (22Ting H.J. Bao B.Y. Reeder J.E. Messing E.M. Lee Y.F.

Total RNA was harvested from cells by Trizol (Invitrogen) and converted to cDNA using NCodeTM VILOTM miRNA cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen). Q-PCR was performed as in the previous report (22Ting H.J.

Primers used are U6: 5′-CTCGCTTCGGCAGCACA-3′; miR-98: 5′-TGAGGTAGTAAGTTGTATTGTT-3′; LIN28A: 5′-AGCGCAGATCAAAAGGAGACA-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCTCTCGAAAGTAGGTTGGCT-3′ (reverse); LIN28B: 5′-TTGAGTCAATACGGGTAACAGGA-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGACAGTAATGGCACTTCTTTGG-3′ (reverse); CCNJ: 5′-CTGGCCGCCGATATTCACC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGCAATCAAGTCAGCAAAATACC-3′ (reverse). After indicated treatments, cells were trypsinized, washed by PBS, and fixed in 70% EtOH overnight. Cells were then pelleted and incubated in PBS containing 0.05 mg/ml RNase A for 30 min at room temperature. After washing, the cells were stained with 10 μg/ml propidium iodide for 10 min then washed three times with PBS. Cells were resuspended in PBS at 106 cells/ml. Cell cycle profiles were determined by flow cytometry using FACSCanto-II (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and analyzed by FlowJo software. The study was approved by the University of Rochester Committee on Animal Resources, and the mice were kept in a specific pathogen-free environment at the animal facility of the University of Rochester Medical Center. PTEN(−/+) and TRAMP mice were obtained from The Jackson Lab (Bar Harbor, Maine). Adult male mice at 24–26 weeks of age were intraperitoneally injected with 1,25-VD (25 ng/g of mice weight) in corn oil. After 24 h, mice were anesthetized for drawing cardiac blood which was then mixed with EDTA (0.2%) to prevent coagulation. Total blood cells were spun down and RNA extracted by Trizol. Cell viability assay, Western blotting assay, transient transfection, and luciferase assays were performed according to previous publications (22Ting H.J. Bao B.Y. Reeder J.E. Messing E.M. Lee Y.F.

In search of miRNAs mediating the anti-proliferative effect of 1,25-VD, we performed systemic miRNA array profiling comparing LNCaP cells treated with ethanol (EtOH) vehicle control and 1,25-VD (LC Sciences). We performed two independent experiments in microarray study. There are 8 miRNAs consistently up- or down-regulated by 1,25-VD with statistical significance in individual experiments (Fig. 1A). Further in-depth analysis provided by LC Science shows that miR-98 is the miRNA showing strong signals (>500) in array; therefore it was chosen for further validation and exploration for its roles in mediating 1,25-VD anti-tumor effects. First, we confirmed 1,25-VD effects on the miR-98 expression by Q-PCR in LNCaP sublines with different vitamin D responsiveness: vitamin D-resistant line (LNCaP-r) versus parental cells (LNCaP-p) (24Bao B.Y. Ting H.J. Hsu J.W. Yasmin-Karim S. Messing E. Lee Y.F. Down-regulation of NF-κB signals is involved in loss of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 responsiveness.J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2010; 120: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, miR-98 expression was induced by 1,25-VD in LNCaP-p cell, but this miR-98 induction by 1,25-VD was diminished in the LNCaP-r cells. This suggests the regulation of miR-98 is through 1,25-VD/VDR transcriptional activity. To further verify VDR's involvement in this regulation, we knocked down VDR by shRNA against VDR and examined the miR-98 expression upon 1,25-VD treatment. We found that VDR expression was reduced in VDR shRNA clones as compared with scramble shRNA controls (Fig. 1C), and 1,25-VD induced miR-98 in scramble shRNA expressed control lines, sc8 and sc10, but not in VDR knockdown clones, shVDR3 and shVDR7 (Fig. 1D). In summary, 1,25-VD-induced miR-98 is VDR-dependent. MiR-98 belongs to the Let-7 family which is well categorized as a tumor suppressive miRNA. It has been shown to regulate HMGA2, a gene controlling growth and tumorigenesis (25Hebert C. Norris K. Scheper M.A. Nikitakis N. Sauk J.J. High mobility group A2 is a target for miRNA-98 in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.Mol. Cancer. 2007; 6: 5Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Therefore, we suspect that miR-98 is involved in the anti-proliferative mechanism of 1,25-VD. Cells were transfected with antagomirs of miR-98 (anti-miR-98) to knock down miR-98 expression; the 1,25-VD responsiveness was examined. As expected, the 1,25-VD induction of miR-98 was diminished in the anti-miR-98 transfected cells (Fig. 2A); consequently, 1,25-VD-mediated growth inhibition effect was significantly reduced in the anti-miR-98 cells as compared with cells that were transfected with control antagomirs (Fig. 2B). This indicates the importance of miR-98 in mediating the anti-proliferative effect of 1,25-VD. On the other hand, overexpression of miR-98 precursor, pre-miR-98, increased more than 400 fold the expression of miR-98 (Fig. 2C). The overexpression of miR-98 alone can suppress LNCaP cells growth up to 30% and treatment with 1,25-VD in the miR-98 overexpressed cells does not further suppress cell growth (Fig. 2D). We further examined the growth inhibitive effect of miR-98 by colony formation assay detecting cell survival and cell viability and by direct cell counting. In order to perform this study, we established miR-98 stably expressed LNCaP cells (LNCaPmiR98) (Fig. 2E). The result showed dramatic inhibition of cell survival and cell viability and by miR-98 when it was stably expressed in LNCaP cells (Fig. 2, F and G). Treatment of 1,25-VD further suppressed the colony numbers and cell viability. This suggests miR-98 is a key mediator of the anti-proliferative effect of 1,25-VD. The transcriptional regulation of miR-98 has not yet been studied. Its transcription start (TSS) site has been predicted to be located at 3070 bp in 5′ upstream, within the host gene HUWE1 (26Monteys A.M. Spengler R.M. Wan J. Tecedor L. Lennox K.A. Xing Y. Davidson B.L. Structure and activity of putative intronic miRNA promoters.RNA. 2010; 16: 495-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). We searched for putative VDR response elements (VDREs) within 2 kb flanking TSS sites by ChIP mapper online program, and four putative VDREs were identified (Fig. 3A). We performed a ChIP assay to test the binding between VDR and putative VDREs and found that VDR bound all VDREs in a ligand-independent manner, except VDRE-B (Fig. 3, B and quantified result in C), suggesting that VDR can bind to VDREs in 5′ promoter of miR-98 to induce its expression. In addition to direct regulation of miR-98 by VDR, we also tested the possibility that 1,25-VD induces miR-98 via an indirect mechanism, such as through regulation of LIN28 proteins that have been shown to bind to the let-7 family pre-microRNA and block production of the mature microRNAs (27Kawahara H. Okada Y. Imai T. Iwanami A. Mischel P.S. Okano H. Musashi1 cooperates in abnormal cell lineage protein 28 (Lin28)-mediated let-7 family microRNA biogenesis in early neural differentiation.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 16121-16130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We found that 1,25-VD suppressed LIN28A and LIN28B expression (Fig. 3, D and E), and therefore could consequently result in miR-98 induction. Overall, these results suggest 1,25-VD regulates miR-98 via both direct and indirect mechanisms. The significant growth suppressive effect of miR-98 in LNCaP was further investigated by cell cycle analysis. LNCaP cells were stably transfected with miR-98 or control vector, then cells were treated with 1,25-VD and analyzed for cell cycle distribution. The result showed that 1,25-VD treatment alone increased G1 distribution while miR-98 overexpression induced G2/M arrest (Fig. 4, A and B). Interestingly, miR-98-overexpressed cells were further arrested in the G1 cell cycle by 1,25-VD. To investigate the miR-98's molecular target that controls G2/M cell cycle, we searched targets of miR-98 by TargetScan and found cyclin J (CCNJ), which has been linked with G2/M cell cycle in early Drosophila embryogenesis (28Kolonin M.G. Finley Jr., R.L. A role for cyclin J in the rapid nuclear division cycles of early Drosophila embryogenesis.Dev. Biol. 2000; 227: 661-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the expression of CCNJ in 1,25-VD-treated and miR-98-overexpressed cells and found both 1,25-VD and miR-98 suppressed CCNJ expression but the combination did not have an additive effect (Fig. 4C). The molecular mechanism by which miR-98 regulates CCNJ was further investigated where we inserted 3′-UTR of CCNJ that contains the putative miR-98 target site into 3′ region of LUC cDNA in pGL3-p-LUC plasmid (Fig. 4D). Overexpression of miR-98 reduced LUC expression while knockdown miR-98 induced LUC expression (Fig. 4E). These results suggested that miR-98 down-regulates CCNJ, hence impairing mitosis progression. The potential of miRNA as a biomarker in body fluid has been reported. We expect miR-98 will be a useful functional biomarker predicting 1,25-VD response. The individual variation in response to 1,25-VD is contributed by a variety of factors, including metabolizing enzyme level, VDR polymorphism, cellular context of coregulators, etc. Functional biomarker measuring response to 1,25-VD will be useful in predicting individual response to vitamin D-based therapy. To prove the principle, mice including wild type and prostate cancer mice models, PTEN heterozygous deletion and TRAMP, were treated with 1,25-VD, and their blood sample was harvested for measuring miR-98 level. The result showed an induction of miR-98 in blood cells from mice treated with 1,25-VD regardless of genetic background (Fig. 5). These data indicated that miR-98 can be measured from the blood and 1,25-VD can induce its expression, thus, miR-98 level can potentially be developed as a biomarker to predict 1,25-VD anti-tumor activity. Exploring miRNAs regulation as a novel mechanism through which vitamin D inhibits cell growth identifies the proliferation inhibitive effect of miR-98. Previous studies identify miR-22 and miR-32 induced by vitamin D in colon cancer cells and human myeloid leukemia cells, respectively (20Alvarez-Díaz S. Valle N. Ferrer-Mayorga G. Lombardía L. Herrera M. Domínguez O. Segura M.F. Bonilla F. Hernando E. Muñoz A. MicroRNA-22 is induced by vitamin D and contributes to its antiproliferative, antimigratory and gene regulatory effects in colon cancer cells.Human Mol. Genet. 2012; 21: 2157-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 29Gocek E. Wang X. Liu X. Liu C.G. Studzinski G.P. MicroRNA-32 upregulation by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in human myeloid leukemia cells leads to Bim targeting and inhibition of AraC-induced apoptosis.Cancer Res. 2011; 71: 6230-6239Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The function of miR-22 contributes to the anti-growth and anti-migration effect of 1,25-VD in colon cancer cells (20Alvarez-Díaz S. Valle N. Ferrer-Mayorga G. Lombardía L. Herrera M. Domínguez O. Segura M.F. Bonilla F. Hernando E. Muñoz A. MicroRNA-22 is induced by vitamin D and contributes to its antiproliferative, antimigratory and gene regulatory effects in colon cancer cells.Human Mol. Genet. 2012; 21: 2157-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). On the other hand, vitamin D induced miR-32 down-regulates the pro-apoptotic protein Bim and leads to anti-apoptotic effect of vitamin D. It is therefore suggested that down-regulation of miR-32 can enhance the therapeutic efficacy in leukemia patients (29Gocek E. Wang X. Liu X. Liu C.G. Studzinski G.P. MicroRNA-32 upregulation by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in human myeloid leukemia cells leads to Bim targeting and inhibition of AraC-induced apoptosis.Cancer Res. 2011; 71: 6230-6239Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Considerable preclinical and epidemiologic data suggest that vitamin D plays a critical role in pathogenesis, progression and therapy for PCa. However, the outcomes from the clinical trials that used 1,25-VD as a second line of therapy for advanced PCa patients are inconclusive. This is mainly due to lack of suitable pharmaceutical preparation that optimizes biologic dose and/or maximum-tolerated dose of 1,25-VD for clinical study. Thus, developing the vitamin D based therapy aiming to reduce hypercalcemic side effects has been one of the major efforts in the field. The discovery of oncomirs, tumor-suppressive, and oncogenic miRNAs, provides novel therapeutic targets for cancer therapy. There are promising results showing that locked-nucleic acid modified oligonucleotides knockdown miR-122, hence inhibiting HCV replication in liver; and intranasal administration of let-7 effectively reduces lung cancer in K-ras mutant mouse model (30Heneghan H.M. Miller N. Kerin M.J. MiRNAs as biomarkers and therapeutic targets in cancer.Current Opin. Pharmacol. 2010; 10: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In addition to directly targeting oncomirs, miRNAs modulators can also sensitize cancer to radiation, chemotherapy, and hormone depletion therapy (31Wouters M.D. van Gent D.C. Hoeijmakers J.H. Pothof J. MicroRNAs, the DNA damage response and cancer.Mutation Res. 2011; 717: 54-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 32Ward A. Balwierz A. Zhang J.D. Kublbeck M. Pawitan Y. Hielscher T. Wiemann S. Sahin O. Re-expression of microRNA-375 reverses both tamoxifen resistance and accompanying EMT-like properties in breast cancer.Oncogene. 2012; (in press)Google Scholar, 33Zhao Y. Deng C. Lu W. Xiao J. Ma D. Guo M. Recker R.R. Gatalica Z. Wang Z. Xiao G.G. let-7 microRNAs induce tamoxifen sensitivity by down-regulation of estrogen receptor α signaling in breast cancer.Mol. Med. 2011; 17: 1233-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Therefore, miRNAs modulators are suitable for developing combination therapy to sensitize cancer to vitamin D treatment. The findings of others and our study indicate that miR-22 and miR-98 mediate the growth inhibitory effect of 1,25-VD. These provide a therapy strategy where combining 1,25-VD and miRNAs modulators, such as ectopically introducing tumor suppressive miRNAs (miR-22 and miR-98) or knockdown VDR signal down-regulating miRNAs (miR-125b and miR-27), could reduce the dosage of 1,25-VD, hence avoiding the hypercalcemic side effect. Nonetheless, developing safe and tissue specific delivery methods to knockdown or replaced miRNAs for PCa therapy is necessary to prevent toxicity and off-target effects. The vitamin D regulation of miR-98 is correlated with VDR transactivity. We therefore seek VDREs in the promoter region of miR-98, which is located at its host gene HUWE1. We confirmed VDR binding of putative VDREs in the promoter region. In addition to direct regulation, we also found 1,25-VD indirectly regulates miR-98 via down-regulation of LIN28, the miRNAs processing proteins. The mechanism of 1,25-VD regulation of LIN28 is possible through regulation of NFκB activity that needs to be further investigated. The balance between LIN28 and Let-7 family is found to control the stemness of stem cells (34Viswanathan S.R. Daley G.Q. Lin28: A microRNA regulator with a macro role.Cell. 2010; 140: 445-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 35Viswanathan S.R. Daley G.Q. Gregory R.I. Selective blockade of microRNA processing by Lin28.Science. 2008; 320: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar). A recent study identifies that miR-125b, the microRNA down-regulating VDR, can suppress the differentiation of hair follicles and maintains stemness of stem cell progenies. Treatment with 1,25-VD can rescue the hair growth defect in mice with doxycycline-induced expression of miR-125b in skin (36Zhang L. Stokes N. Polak L. Fuchs E. Specific microRNAs are preferentially expressed by skin stem cells to balance self-renewal and early lineage commitment.Cell Stem Cell. 2011; 8: 294-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). We therefore suspect 1,25-VD treatment could control the balance between quiescence/self-renewal and differentiation status of stem cells through regulation of LIN28. The known targets of miR-98 include an oncogene (HMGA2), a tumor suppressor (FUS1), and a immune-modulator, cytokine-inducible src homology 2-containing protein (CIS) (25Hebert C. Norris K. Scheper M.A. Nikitakis N. Sauk J.J. High mobility group A2 is a target for miRNA-98 in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.Mol.

Gong A.Y. Eischeid A.N. Dittman J.W. Chen X.M. MicroRNA-98 and let-7 confer cholangiocyte expression of cytokine-inducible Src homology 2-containing protein in response to microbial challenge.J. Immunol. 2009; 183: 1617-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). We observed the G2/M arrest in cells overexpressing miR-98 and identified a mitosis controlling cyclin, CCNJ, which is down-regulated by miR-98 via targeting its 3′-UTR. Interestingly, treatment of 1,25-VD in miR-98 overexpressed cells results in increasing G1 arrest as the effect of 1,25-VD alone. We therefore suspect other mechanisms through which miR-98 triggers can sensitize the 1,25-VD-induced G1 arrest in LNCaP. One possible mechanism is through reciprocal suppression of LIN28B, which is one of the predicted miR-98 targets in TargetScan. The down-regulation of LIN28B promotes differentiation of LNCaP cells, thereby enabling cells responding to the G1 arrest effect of 1,25-VD. Another interesting candidate target of miR-98 is enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), which functions in protein complex to trimethylate histone H3 lysine 27 leading to epigenetic silencing (16Varambally S. Cao Q. Mani R.S. Shankar S. Wang X. Ateeq B. Laxman B. Cao X. Jing X. Ramnarayanan K. Brenner J.C. Yu J. Kim J.H. Han B. Tan P. Kumar-Sinha C. Lonigro R.J. Palanisamy N. Maher C.A. Chinnaiyan A.M. Genomic loss of microRNA-101 leads to overexpression of histone methyltransferase EZH2 in cancer.Science. 2008; 322: 1695-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). It is suspected that by down-regulation of EZH2, anti-proliferative genes, especially those involved in G1 arresting, is de-silenced, therefore enabling 1,25-VD to induce VDR up-regulating their expression. Whether CCNJ or other not-yet identified miR-98 targets contribute to the role of miR-98 in mediating the growth inhibitory effect of 1,25-VD requires further study. Biomarker potential of miRNAs relies on their high stability and existence in formalin-fixed tissue, cell free serum/plasma, and urine (39Coppola V. De Maria R. Bonci D. MicroRNAs and prostate cancer.Endocrine-related Cancer. 2010; 17: F1-F17Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The biological response to vitamin D varied among individuals. Factors contributing to a broad range of sensitivity to vitamin D include genomic polymorphisms of VDR and metabolism enzymes and pathological conditions altering VDR activity. Biomarkers representing biological response of vitamin D treatment will be more meaningful than measurement of serum vitamin D level. A recent study investigates the serum level of miRNAs in subjects given high dose vitamin D3 (20,000 and 40,000 IU) weekly for a year (40Jorde R. Svartberg J. Joakimsen R.M. Coucheron D.H. Plasma profile of microRNA after supplementation with high doses of vitamin D3 for 12 months.BMC Res. Notes. 2012; 5: 245Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Although there is not yet a conclusive result, measuring miRNAs in body fluid to identify the response to vitamin D is worth pursuing. We therefore explore the biomarker potential of miR-98 representing vitamin D treatment in mice bearing prostate cancer. The cellular fraction of blood contains miR-98 whose expression correlates well with vitamin D treatment in both wild type and cancerous mice. Further investigation correlating expression levels of miR-98 and other vitamin D-regulated anti-tumor miRNAs (such as miR-22) in blood or other body fluid with anti-tumor effect of vitamin D is demanded."
https://openalex.org/W2036641751,"Background In therapeutic feeding programs (TFP), mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) shows advantages over weight-for-height Z score (WHZ) and is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) as an independent criterion for screening children 6–59 months old. Here we report outcomes and treatment response from a TFP using MUAC ≤118 mm or oedema as sole admission criteria for severe acute malnutrition (SAM). Methods Patient data from September 2007 to March 2009 for children admitted by MUAC ≤118 mm or oedema to a Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) TFP in Burkina Faso were retrospectively analyzed. Analysis included anthropometric measurements at admission and discharge, program outcomes and treatment response. Results Of 24,792 patient outcomes analyzed, nearly half (48.8%; n = 12,090) were admitted with MUAC 116–118 mm. Most patients (88.7%; n = 21,983) were 6–24 months old. At admission, 52.7% (n = 5,041) of those with MUAC 116–118 mm had a WHZ <−3 SD. At discharge, 89.1% (n = 22,094) recovered (15% weight gain or oedema resolution), 7.9% (n = 1,961) defaulted, 1.5% (n = 384) failed to respond to treatment, and 1.0% (n = 260) died. Average weight gain was 5.4 g/kg/day, and average MUAC gain was 0.42 mm/day. Patients with MUAC ≤114 mm at admission had higher average daily weight and MUAC gains at discharge compared to those admitted with MUAC 116–118 mm, but those in the latter category required longer lengths of stay to achieve recovery (P<0.001). Conclusion This analysis suggests that MUAC ≤118 mm as TFP admission criterion is a useful alternative to WHZ. Regarding treatment response, rates of weight and MUAC gain were acceptable. Applying 15% weight gain as discharge criterion resulted in longer lengths of stay for less malnourished children. Since MUAC gain parallels weight gain, it may be feasible to use MUAC as both an admission and discharge criterion."
https://openalex.org/W2008847855,"There is increasing evidence supporting DNA virus regulation of the cell adhesion and tumour suppressor protein, E-cadherin. We previously reported that loss of E-cadherin in human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16-infected epidermis is contributed to by the major viral proto-oncogene E6 and is associated with reduced Langerhans cells density, potentially regulating the immune response. The focus of this study is determining how the HPV16 E6 protein mediates E-cadherin repression. We found that the E-cadherin promoter is repressed in cells expressing E6, resulting in fewer E-cadherin transcripts. On exploring the mechanism for this, repression by increased histone deacetylase activity or by increased binding of trans-repressors to the E-cadherin promoter Epal element was discounted. In contrast, DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) activity was increased in E6 expressing cells. Upon inhibiting DNMT activity using 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine, E-cadherin transcription was restored in the presence of HPV16 E6. The E-cadherin promoter was not directly methylated, however a mutational analysis showed general promoter repression and reduced binding of the transactivators Sp1 and AML1 and the repressor Slug. Expression of E7 with E6 resulted in a further reduction in surface E-cadherin levels. This is the first report of HPV16 E6-mediated transcriptional repression of this adhesion molecule and tumour suppressor protein."
https://openalex.org/W2010172360,"To assess the consequences of endogenous mutant K-Ras, we analyzed the signaling and biological properties of a small panel of isogenic cell lines. These include the cancer cell lines DLD1, HCT116, and Hec1A, in which either the WT or mutant K-ras allele has been disrupted, and SW48 colorectal cancer cells and human mammary epithelial cells in which a single copy of mutant K-ras was introduced at its endogenous genomic locus. We find that single copy mutant K-Ras causes surprisingly modest activation of downstream signaling to ERK and Akt. In contrast, a negative feedback signaling loop to EGFR and N-Ras occurs in some, but not all, of these cell lines. Mutant K-Ras also had relatively minor effects on cell proliferation and cell migration but more dramatic effects on cell transformation as assessed by growth in soft agar. Surprisingly, knock-out of the wild type K-ras allele consistently increased growth in soft agar, suggesting tumor-suppressive properties of this gene under these conditions. Finally, we examined the effects of single copy mutant K-Ras on global gene expression. Although transcriptional programs triggered by mutant K-Ras were generally quite distinct in the different cell lines, there was a small number of genes that were consistently overexpressed, and these could be used to monitor K-Ras inhibition in a panel of human tumor cell lines. We conclude that there are conserved components of mutant K-Ras signaling and phenotypes but that many depend on cell context and environmental cues.Background: Many studies analyzing K-Ras function rely on overexpression.Results: Knock-out and knock-in of endogenous mutant K-ras have modest effects on downstream signaling but strong effects on gene expression and transformation.Conclusion: Genomic manipulation allows physiological determination of WT and mutant K-Ras consequences.Significance: Gene expression patterns can be used to monitor inhibition of mutant K-Ras.

Although transcriptional programs triggered by mutant K-Ras were generally quite distinct in the different cell lines, there was a small number of genes that were consistently overexpressed, and these could be used to monitor K-Ras inhibition in a panel of human tumor cell lines. We conclude that there are conserved components of mutant K-Ras signaling and phenotypes but that many depend on cell context and environmental cues. Background: Many studies analyzing K-Ras function rely on overexpression. Results: Knock-out and knock-in of endogenous mutant K-ras have modest effects on downstream signaling but strong effects on gene expression and transformation. Conclusion: Genomic manipulation allows physiological determination of WT and mutant K-Ras consequences. Significance: Gene expression patterns can be used to monitor inhibition of mutant K-Ras."
https://openalex.org/W2057193671,"Insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) is a highly conserved zinc metallopeptidase that is ubiquitously distributed in human tissues, and particularly abundant in the brain, liver, and muscles. IDE activity has been historically associated with insulin and β-amyloid catabolism. However, over the last decade, several experimental findings have established that IDE is also involved in a wide variety of physiopathological processes, including ubiquitin clearance and Varicella Zoster Virus infection. In this study, we demonstrate that normal and malignant cells exposed to different stresses markedly up-regulate IDE in a heat shock protein (HSP)-like fashion. Additionally, we focused our attention on tumor cells and report that (i) IDE is overexpressed in vivo in tumors of the central nervous system (CNS); (ii) IDE-silencing inhibits neuroblastoma (SHSY5Y) cell proliferation and triggers cell death; (iii) IDE inhibition is accompanied by a decrease of the poly-ubiquitinated protein content and co-immunoprecipitates with proteasome and ubiquitin in SHSY5Y cells. In this work, we propose a novel role for IDE as a heat shock protein with implications in cell growth regulation and cancer progression, thus opening up an intriguing hypothesis of IDE as an anticancer target."
https://openalex.org/W2063761843,"The characterization of the complex diffusion signal arising from the brain remains an open problem. Many representations focus on characterizing the global shape of the diffusion profile at each voxel and are limited to the assessment of connectivity. In contrast, Multiple Fascicle Models (MFM) seek to represent the contribution from each white matter fascicle and may be useful in the investigation of both white matter connectivity and diffusion properties of each individual fascicle. However, the most appropriate representation of multiple fascicles remains unclear. In particular, a multiple tensor representation of multiple fascicles has frequently been reported to be numerically challenging and unstable. We provide here the first analytical demonstration that when using a diffusion MRI acquisition with only one non-zero b-value, such as in conventional single-shell HARDI acquisition, a co-linearity in model parameters makes the precise model estimation impossible. Motivated by this theoretical result, we propose the novel CUSP (CUbe and SPhere) optimal acquisition scheme to achieve multiple non-zero b-values. It combines the gradients of a single-shell HARDI with gradients in its enclosing cube, in which varying b-values can be acquired by modulation of the gradient strength, without modifying the minimum echo time. Compared to a multi-shell HARDI acquisition, our scheme has significantly increased signal-to-noise ratio. We propose a novel estimation algorithm that enables efficient, robust and accurate estimation of the parameters of a multi-tensor model. In conjunction with a CUSP acquisition, it enables full estimation of the multi-tensor model. We present an evaluation of CUSP-MFM on both synthetic phantoms and invivo data. We report qualitative and quantitative experimental evaluations which demonstrate the ability of CUSP-MFM to characterize multiple fascicles from short duration acquisitions. CUSP-MFM enables rapid and effective investigation of multiple white matter fascicles, in both normal development and in disease and injury, in research and clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W2011502363,"While the cytotoxic effects of titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles have been under intense investigation, the molecular mechanisms of this cytotoxicity remain unknown. Here we investigated the influence of oncogenic transformation and a major apoptotic signaling pathway on cellular responses to TiO2 nanoparticles. Isogenic wild-type (WT) and apoptosis-resistant (Bak−/−Bax−/−) cell lines with and without tumorigenic transformation were examined. TiO2 nanoparticles preferentially reduced viability of tumorigenic cells in a dose-dependent fashion compared with their untransformed counterparts. Importantly, the elevated cytotoxicity of TiO2 nanoparticles was independent of a major Bak/Bax-dependent apoptosis pathway. Because transformation does not affect cellular fluid-phase endocytosis or nanoparticle uptake, it is likely that the increased cytotoxicity in tumor cells is due to the interaction between TiO2 nanoparticles and the lysosomal compartment. Overall, our data indicate that TiO2 nanoparticles induce cytotoxicity preferentially in transformed cells independent of a major apoptotic signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1972374259,"Conjugative plasmid transfer is the most important means of spreading antibiotic resistance and virulence genes among bacteria and therefore presents a serious threat to human health. The process requires direct cell-cell contact made possible by a multiprotein complex that spans cellular membranes and serves as a channel for macromolecular secretion. Thus far, well studied conjugative type IV secretion systems (T4SS) are of Gram-negative (G-) origin. Although many medically relevant pathogens (e.g., enterococci, staphylococci, and streptococci) are Gram-positive (G+), their conjugation systems have received little attention. This study provides structural information for the transfer protein TraM of the G+ broad host range Enterococcus conjugative plasmid pIP501. Immunolocalization demonstrated that the protein localizes to the cell wall. We then used opsonophagocytosis as a novel tool to verify that TraM was exposed on the cell surface. In these assays, antibodies generated to TraM recruited macrophages and enabled killing of pIP501 harboring Enteroccocus faecalis cells. The crystal structure of the C-terminal, surface-exposed domain of TraM was determined to 2.5 Å resolution. The structure, molecular dynamics, and cross-linking studies indicated that a TraM trimer acts as the biological unit. Despite the absence of sequence-based similarity, TraM unexpectedly displayed a fold similar to the T4SS VirB8 proteins from Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Brucella suis (G-) and to the transfer protein TcpC from Clostridium perfringens plasmid pCW3 (G+). Based on the alignments of secondary structure elements of VirB8-like proteins from mobile genetic elements and chromosomally encoded T4SS from G+ and G- bacteria, we propose a new classification scheme of VirB8-like proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2033943952,"Radioresistance is considered as a main factor restricting efficacy of radiotherapy. However, the exact molecular mechanism of radioresistance has not been explained yet. In this study, to elucidate radioresistance mechanism in lung cancer, we compared radiation responses in two types of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells with different radiosensitivity and identified key molecules conferring radioresistance. In radioresistant NSCLC cells, ionizing radiation (IR) led to casein kinase 2α (CK2α)- and PKC-mediated phosphorylation of rpS3 and TRAF2, respectively, which induced dissociation of rpS3-TRAF2 complex and NF-κB activation, resulting in significant up-regulation of prosurvival genes (cIAP1, cIAP2, and survivin). Also, dissociated phospho-rpS3 translocated into nucleus and bound with NF-κB complex (p65 and p50), contributing to p65 DNA binding property and specificity. However, in radiosensitive NSCLC cells, IR-mediated rpS3 phosphorylation was not detected due to the absence of CK2α overexpression. Consequently, IR-induced rpS3-TRAF2 complex dissociation, NF-κB activation, and prosurvival gene expression were not presented.

Lung cancer is not only the leading cause of cancer death, but also the most commonly diagnosed cancer type worldwide. It is separated into two morphologic types: non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 3The abbreviations used are: NSCLCnon-small cell lung cancercIAPcellular inhibitor of apoptosisCK2casein kinase 2IKKinhibitor of κB (IκB) kinaseIRionizing radiationRIPreceptor-interacting proteinrpS3ribosomal protein S3TAK1TGFβ-associated kinase 1TNFRtumor necrosis factor receptorTRADDTNFR1-associated death domain proteinTRAFTNFR-associated factorTBB4,5,6,7-tetrabromobenzotriazoleLucluciferase. making up the majority of lung cancer cases, and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Most patients with lung cancer are diagnosed with inoperable and advanced stage disease (1Baumann M. Krause M. Zips D. Petersen C. Dittmann K. Dörr W. Rodemann H.P.

The role of radiotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer.Chest. 1999; 116: 504S-508SAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, radiotherapy performs a critical role in curative management of these inoperable NSCLC patients (3Koh P.K. Faivre-Finn C. Blackhall F.H. De Ruysscher D.

Rev. 2012; 38: 626-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, therapeutic outcomes of radiotherapy are not fully satisfactory in many cases, and radioresistance is considered as a main factor that restricts successful treatment of radiotherapy (4Bussink J. van der Kogel A.J. Kaanders J.H.

Radioresistance is closely associated with alteration of radiation-induced DNA damage responses and enhanced repair capacity, resulting in resistance to apoptosis and tumor repopulation during radiation treatment (5Shimura T. Kakuda S. Ochiai Y. Nakagawa H. Kuwahara Y. Takai Y. Kobayashi J. Komatsu K. Fukumoto M. Acquired radioresistance of human tumor cells by DNA-PK/AKT/GSK3β-mediated cyclin D1 overexpression.Oncogene. 2010; 29: 4826-4837Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Upon irradiation, numerous genes and proteins are involved in shifting of balance between cell survival and death (6Igney F.H. Krammer P.H. Death and anti-death: tumour resistance to apoptosis.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 277-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar). Cancer cells may acquire resistance to radiation-induced apoptosis by dynamic interplay and regulation of multiple prosurvival factors (7Kim W. Youn H. Seong K.M. Yang H.J. Yun Y.J. Kwon T. Kim Y.H. Lee J.Y. Jin Y.W. Youn B. PIM1-activated PRAS40 regulates radioresistance in non-small cell lung cancer cells through interplay with FOXO3a, 14-3-3, and protein phosphatases.Radiat. Res. 2011; 176: 539-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is a typical intrinsic cellular suppressor of apoptosis. After exposure to both low and high doses of ionizing radiation (IR), DNA damage-induced NF-κB promotes antiapoptotic gene expression. Also, constitutive activation of NF-κB is associated with oncogenic transformation, chemo/radioresistance, and metastasis. Therefore, its activation has been reported to be a novel marker of tumor radioresistance, and researchers have focused on the mechanism of NF-κB-mediated radioresistance in radiosensitizer development (8Criswell T. Leskov K. Miyamoto S. Luo G. Boothman D.A. Transcription factors activated in mammalian cells after clinically relevant doses of ionizing radiation.Oncogene. 2003; 22: 5813-5827Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 9Yoshida K.

Nuclear factor-κB expression as a novel marker of radioresistance in early-stage laryngeal cancer.Head Neck. 2010; 32: 646-655PubMed Google Scholar). NF-κB activation is intimately involved in tumor necrosis factor receptors (TNFRs)-mediated signaling, which has been established in radiation-induced adaptive responses (10Murley J.S. Baker K.L. Miller R.C. Darga T.E. Weichselbaum R.R. Grdina D.J. SOD2-mediated adaptive responses induced by low-dose ionizing radiation via TNF signaling and amifostine.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2011; 51: 1918-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Because TNFRs do not have any enzymatic properties, the signaling processes are achieved by recruitment of intracellular scaffold proteins including TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), TNFR1-associated death domain protein (TRADD), and receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1). In response to TNFα and other stress stimuli such as radiation, the cytoplasmic adaptor proteins regulate activation of inhibitor of κB (IκB) kinase (IKK) complex. IKK phosphorylation of IκB proteins leads to their Lys-48-linked polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation, allowing nuclear translocation of NF-κB and regulation of antiapoptotic gene expression (11Wajant H. Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P. Tumor necrosis factor signaling.Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 45-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1890) Google Scholar, 12Li S. Wang L. Dorf M.E. PKC phosphorylation of TRAF2 mediates IKKα/β recruitment and K63-linked polyubiquitination.Mol. Cell. 2009; 33: 30-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Seven members of the mammalian TRAF family have been considered as one of the most important scaffold proteins. In particular, as a prototypical member of the TRAFs, TRAF2 plays a pivotal role in protection against apoptosis and cellular stress (13Bradley J.R. Pober J.S. Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors (TRAFs).Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6482-6491Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 14Arch R.H. Gedrich R.W. Thompson C.B. Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors (TRAFs)–a family of adapter proteins that regulates life and death.Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2821-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination are a major control mechanism of TRAF2 function. Recent studies indicate that knockdown of TRAF2 induces radiosensitization of cancer cells through inhibition of NF-κB signaling and suggest that TRAF2 could be an attractive candidate as a radiosensitizing target (15Zheng M. Morgan-Lappe S.E. Yang J. Bockbrader K.M. Pamarthy D. Thomas D. Fesik S.W. Sun Y. Growth inhibition and radiosensitization of glioblastoma and lung cancer cells by small interfering RNA silencing of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2.Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 7570-7578Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Ribosomal protein S3 (rpS3) is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit and mainly involved in ribosomal maturation and translation initiation through association with the eukaryotic initiation factors, eIF2 and eIF3 (16Schäfer T. Maco B. Petfalski E. Tollervey D. Böttcher B. Aebi U. Hurt E. Hrr25-dependent phosphorylation state regulates organization of the pre-40S subunit.Nature. 2006; 441: 651-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Moreover, rpS3 has been demonstrated to be capable of various extraribosomal functions including regulation of DNA repair, transformation, development, apoptosis, and transcription (17Jang C.Y. Lee J.Y. Kim J. RpS3, a DNA repair endonuclease and ribosomal protein, is involved in apoptosis.FEBS Lett. 2004; 560: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 18Kim T.S. Kim H.D. Kim J. PKCδ-dependent functional switch of rpS3 between translation and DNA repair.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1793: 395-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). rpS3 also appears to possess a general DNA repair endonuclease activity that participates in the cleavage of damaged DNA lesions caused by UV irradiation and oxidative stress (19Kim S.H. Lee J.Y. Kim J. Characterization of a wide range base-damage-endonuclease activity of mammalian rpS3.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 328: 962-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Significantly, rpS3 has been reported as another essential non-Rel subunit of the native NF-κB complex (p65 homodimer or p65-p50 heterodimer) and cooperates with Rel dimmers to achieve full DNA binding, regulating the specificity of NF-κB transcriptional activation (20Wan F. Anderson D.E. Barnitz R.A. Snow A. Bidere N. Zheng L. Hegde V. Lam L.T. Staudt L.M. Levens D. Deutsch W.A. Lenardo M.J.

However, the precise physiological functions of rpS3 and the regulation mechanism have remained unclear. The purpose of this study was to elucidate radioresistance mechanism in NSCLC cells and to identify key molecules conferring radioresistance. We demonstrated that IR-dependent phosphorylation of rpS3 and TRAF2 by casein kinase 2α (CK2α) and protein kinase C (PKC), respectively, plays an important role in survival signal transduction pathway in NSCLC cells. Our findings provide a possible explanation of how NSCLC cells could acquire and regulate resistance to radiation. Furthermore, we suggest that regulation of rpS3 and TRAF2 could be an attractive pharmaceutical target for radioresistance of NSCLC and could ultimately contribute to effective radiation treatment of lung cancer. Human NSCLC cell lines, A549 and NCI-H460, were acquired from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in 95% air, 5% CO2. Cells were exposed to a single dose of γ-rays using the Gamma Cell 40 Exactor (Nordion International, Inc., Kanata, Ontario, Canada) at a dose rate of 0.81 grays/min. Following the manufacturer's instructions, cells were seeded on 6-well dishes and transfected with siRNA oligonucleotides (100 ng) against rpS3, CK2α, and PKCδ/ϵ (ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool, Dharmacon, Chicago, IL), using DharmaFECT 1 reagent. Cells were plated at a density of 300 cells in 6-well dishes and transiently transfected with rpS3-siRNA. After 24 h, cells were exposed to specific dose of IR and subsequently grown for 14 days. Then, cells were fixed with 10% methanol, 10% acetic acid and stained with 1% crystal violet solution. Colonies containing more than 50 cells were scored as survivors by using densitometric software (21Niyazi M. Niyazi I. Belka C. Counting colonies of clonogenic assays by using densitometric software.Radiat. Oncol. 2007; 2: 4Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). After 2 h of irradiation, total cellular RNA (20 μg) was isolated from the cells (5 × 106 cells) using TRIzol (Invitrogen). Northern blotting was performed as described previously (22Yang H.J. Youn H. Seong K.M. Yun Y.J. Kim W. Kim Y.H. Lee J.Y. Kim C.S. Jin Y.W. Youn B.

Pharmacol. 2011; 82: 524-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), using radiolabeled DNA probe targeting human rpS3 and CK2α cDNA. Following the desired treatments, total cell lysates were prepared using RIPA lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 25 mm NaF, 1 mm DTT, 20 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.3 mm PMSF, and 5 units/ml aprotinin). As occasion demanded, nuclear or ribosome fractionation was performed as described previously (18Kim T.S. Kim H.D. Kim J. PKCδ-dependent functional switch of rpS3 between translation and DNA repair.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1793: 395-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For Western blot analysis, denaturated protein lysates (40 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Separated proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane followed by blocking with 5% skim milk in TBST (10 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were then probed with specific primary antibodies followed by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and visualized using an ECL detection system. For immunoprecipitation, protein (200 μg) was immunoprecipitated overnight with specific primary antibody and protein A-agarose beads (50 μl, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). They were washed three times with lysis buffer and boiled in 2× SDS sample buffer for 5 min followed by centrifugation. Resulting clear supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The following steps were taken using the same method applied for Western blotting. All antibodies used for Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation were acquired from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). For in vitro kinase assay, cell lysates (after 2 h of irradiation) were prepared using RIPA lysis buffer, immunoprecipitated with specific primary antibody overnight, and then incubated for 4 h with protein A-Sepharose beads (50 μl, Invitrogen). Beads were washed with RIPA lysis buffer and reacted with His-tagged rpS3 (WT or T221A) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 30 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 10 mm MgCl2) for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 4× SDS sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography to determine the phosphorylation status of rpS3 by CK2α. For the in vivo kinase assay, cells were transfected with FLAG-CK2α (WT or kinase-dead) or co-transfected with CK2α (WT) and HA-rpS3 (WT or T221A) for 24 h and then irradiated. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with specific primary antibody overnight. The Western blotting was conducted using phospho-Ser/Thr antibody. Prepared TRAF2- (or rpS3)-bound resin was incubated at 4 °C for 8 h with 10 μg of purified GST-rpS3 (or GST-TRAF2) in 100 μl of the binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1% Triton X-100). After a brief centrifugation, the beads were washed three times with washing buffer (50 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9) and resuspended in elution buffer (1 m imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9). The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with a primary anti-GST antibody and a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Cells were transiently co-transfected with 3 μg of NF-κB luciferase reporter gene (NF-κB-Luc) plasmid, IκBα mutant plasmid (ΔIκBα), CK2α-siRNA, or PKCδ-siRNA. Following overnight transfection, luciferase reporter gene assay was carried out as described previously (22Yang H.J. Youn H. Seong K.M. Yun Y.J. Kim W. Kim Y.H. Lee J.Y. Kim C.S. Jin Y.W. Youn B. Psoralidin, a dual inhibitor of COX-2 and 5-LOX, regulates ionizing radiation (IR)-induced pulmonary inflammation.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2011; 82: 524-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). After 2 h of irradiation, HA-rpS3- (WT) and HA-rpS3 (T221A)-expressing cells (5 × 108) were cross-linked in 1% formaldehyde and quenched in 125 mm glycine followed by washing in PBS. Cells were lysed and sonicated. The extract was centrifuged, diluted in dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, and 200 mm NaCl), and precleared using protein A/G-agarose and calf thymus DNA at 4 °C for 1 h. Next, immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-p65, -rpS3, or -IgG antibody. Immunoprecipitates were collected and washed in low salt buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, and 150 mm NaCl), high salt buffer (as before, containing 500 mm NaCl), and LiCl wash buffer (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1). Then, they were washed two times in 10 mm Tris, 5 mm EDTA. DNA was extracted from beads using 100 μl of elution buffer (1% SDS and 0.1 m NaHCO) and supplemented with 0.25 m NaCl. Following overnight incubation at 65 °C for reversal of cross-links, samples were incubated for an additional 1 h at 65 °C with 10 μm EDTA, 40 μm Tris, pH 6.8, and 2 μg of proteinase K. DNA was purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). PCR was performed with the primers that encompass the human interleukin-8 (IL-8), IκBα, and β-actin promoter. Primers were as follows: IL-8, 5′-GGGCCATCAGTTGCAAATC-3′ and 5′-TTCCTTCCGGTGGTTTCTTC-3′; IκBα, 5′-GACGACCCCAATTCAAATCG-3′ and 5′-TCAGCTCGGGGAATTTCC-3′; β-actin, 5′-TGCACTGTGCGGCGAAGC-3′ and 5′-TCGAGCCATAAAAGGCAA-3′. cDNA was prepared following the protocol of the ImProm-IITM reverse transcription system (Promega, Madison, WI). Primers for cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 1 (cIAP1), cIAP2, and survivin were designed using Primer Express 4.0 (Applied Biosystems, Foster, CA). Real-time PCR was performed using an iCycler iQ multicolor real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad) as follows: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 40 s, and final elongation at 72 °C for 10 min. The intensity of each gene was normalized against GAPDH expression. Cells were seeded at a density of 4 × 105 cells in 96-well plates, incubated overnight, and then exposed to the desired treatment of IR and/or siRNA. Apoptosis induction was determined by analysis of cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragmentation using a cell death detection kit (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany), according to the manufacturer's instructions. All numeric data were presented as mean ± S.D. and analyzed using the one-way analysis of variance on ranked data followed by a Tukey's honestly significant difference test and the two-way analysis of variance on ranked data and a Bonferroni's post test using Prism 4 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). All results described in this study were confirmed by three independent experiments Supplemental Experimental Procedures. A549 and NCI-H460 cells can be used as models for radioresistant and radiosensitive NSCLC cells, respectively, due to their considerable difference in radiosensitivity (7Kim W. Youn H. Seong K.M.

Based on diverse extraribosomal functions of ribosomal proteins, we hypothesized that they could be associated with tumor radioresistance. To identify novel radiosensitizing target(s), we performed siRNA screening directed against the ribosomal proteins in irradiated NSCLC cells. The results yielded several hits of ribosomal protein that have different survival effects in A549 and NCI-H460 cells. Among these hits, we decided to validate rpS3 as a novel radiosensitizing target. To investigate whether rpS3 regulates radiosensitivity in NSCLC cells, rpS3-siRNA was prepared (Fig. 1A) and applied to a colony-forming assay (Fig. 1, B and C). As a result, transient rpS3 knockdown did not change radiosensitivity in A549 cells, whereas treatment of rpS3-siRNA caused a significant increase in proliferation of NCI-H460 cells. Furthermore, to examine whether or not our results are cell line-specific, we used other models for radioresistant and radiosensitive NSCLC cells, NCI-H1299 and NCI-H157, respectively. We reconfirmed that A549 and NCI-H1299 cells are more radioresistant than NCI-H460 and H157 cells in accordance with previous studies (7Kim W. Youn H. Seong K.M. Yang H.J. Yun Y.J. Kwon T. Kim Y.H.

The possible regulatory effect of rpS3 on radiosensitivity was also verified in NCI-H1299 and NCI-H157 cells (supplemental Fig. S1, B and C). Taken together, these results indicate that silencing of rpS3 shows different responses between radioresistant and radiosensitive NSCLC cells and suggest the possibility that rpS3 could be a regulator of radiosensitivity in NSCLC cells. To investigate how rpS3 is associated with regulation of radiosensitivity in NSCLC cells, molecular modification and signaling involvement of rpS3 were monitored. rpS3 mRNA and protein were constitutively expressed without dependence on IR irradiation in both A549 and NCI-H460 cells (Fig. 2A). However, IR-induced rpS3 phosphorylation at Ser/Thr sites appeared only in radioresistant A549 cells (Fig. 2B). Next, we performed an in vitro kinase assay with purified recombinant rpS3 and several kinases immunoprecipitated by specific antibody from two NSCLC cell lines (data not shown). As a result, we found CK2α to be a candidate for an upstream kinase of rpS3. As shown in Fig. 2C, we identified a significant difference in IR-induced CK2α expression between radioresistant A549 and radiosensitive NCI-H460 cells. In NCI-H460 cells, CK2α mRNA and protein were expressed at extremely low levels irrelevant to the dose of IR. However, IR increased both mRNA and protein expression of CK2α in A549 cells. Similar results were observed in radioresistant NCI-H1299 and radiosensitive NCI-H157 cells (supplemental Fig. S2A). Interestingly, CK2α-mediated rpS3 phosphorylation was dose- and time-dependently induced only in radioresistant A549 cells (Fig. 2, D and E). To further investigate which residues are the target of CK2α in rpS3, based on the three-dimensional structure of rpS3 (Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID: 3KC4), we mutated several Ser/Thr residues to Ala and used this mutant as a substrate for FLAG-CK2α (WT). As shown in Fig. 2F, CK2α-induced rpS3 phosphorylation was eliminated by T221A mutation of rpS3, indicating that Thr-221 of rpS3 is required for CK2α-mediated phosphorylation in irradiated A549 cells. This specific phosphorylation event of rpS3 also occurs under in vivo conditions (Fig. 2, G and H). We verified that inhibition of CK2α expression led to complete blockage of the rpS3 phosphorylation in vivo in irradiated A549 cells (Fig. 2I). Direct association between IR-induced rpS3 phosphorylation at Thr-221 and CK2α was reconfirmed by treatment of CK2α inhibitor, 4,5,6,7-tetrabromobenzotriazole (TBB, Sigma-Aldrich) in A549 and NCI-H460 cells (Fig. 2J). Furthermore, CK2α-mediated phosphorylation of rpS3 was presented only in radioresistant NCI-H1299 cells under irradiation (supplemental Fig. S2B). According to these results, we propose the different radiation responses through rpS3 phosphorylation in NSCLC cells with different radiosensitivity and suggest that IR-activated CK2α directly phosphorylates rpS3 at Thr-221 under both in vitro and in vivo conditions in radioresistant NSCLC cells. rpS3 critically regulates translation, and also possesses various extraribosomal functions involved in DNA repair, apoptosis, and transcriptional regulation (18Kim T.S.

In this study we investigated labeling of astrocytes by SR101 in acute slices from the ventrolateral medulla and the hippocampus of transgenic mice expressing EGFP under the control of the astrocyte-specific human GFAP promoter. While SR101 efficiently and specifically labeled EGFP-expressing astrocytes in hippocampus, we found that the same staining procedure failed to label astrocytes efficiently in the ventrolateral medulla. Although carbenoxolone is able to decrease the SR101-labeling of astrocytes in the hippocampus, it is unlikely that SR101 is taken up via gap-junction hemichannels because mefloquine, a blocker for pannexin and connexin hemichannels, was unable to prevent SR101-labeling of hippocampal astrocytes. However, SR101-labeling of the hippocampal astrocytes was significantly reduced by substrates of organic anion transport polypeptides, including estron-3-sulfate and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, suggesting that SR101 is actively transported into hippocampal astrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2029414454,"The malaria disease has become a cause of poverty and a major hindrance to economic development. The culprit of the disease is the parasite, which secretes an array of proteins within the host erythrocyte to facilitate its own survival. Accordingly, the secretory proteins of malaria parasite have become a logical target for drug design against malaria. Unfortunately, with the increasing resistance to the drugs thus developed, the situation has become more complicated. To cope with the drug resistance problem, one strategy is to timely identify the secreted proteins by malaria parasite, which can serve as potential drug targets. However, it is both expensive and time-consuming to identify the secretory proteins of malaria parasite by experiments alone. To expedite the process for developing effective drugs against malaria, a computational predictor called ""iSMP-Grey"" was developed that can be used to identify the secretory proteins of malaria parasite based on the protein sequence information alone. During the prediction process a protein sample was formulated with a 60D (dimensional) feature vector formed by incorporating the sequence evolution information into the general form of PseAAC (pseudo amino acid composition) via a grey system model, which is particularly useful for solving complicated problems that are lack of sufficient information or need to process uncertain information. It was observed by the jackknife test that iSMP-Grey achieved an overall success rate of 94.8%, remarkably higher than those by the existing predictors in this area. As a user-friendly web-server, iSMP-Grey is freely accessible to the public at http://www.jci-bioinfo.cn/iSMP-Grey. Moreover, for the convenience of most experimental scientists, a step-by-step guide is provided on how to use the web-server to get the desired results without the need to follow the complicated mathematical equations involved in this paper."
https://openalex.org/W2144022212,"In this paper we present statistical analysis of English texts from Wikipedia. We try to address the issue of language complexity empirically by comparing the simple English Wikipedia (Simple) to comparable samples of the main English Wikipedia (Main). Simple is supposed to use a more simplified language with a limited vocabulary, and editors are explicitly requested to follow this guideline, yet in practice the vocabulary richness of both samples are at the same level. Detailed analysis of longer units (n-grams of words and part of speech tags) shows that the language of Simple is less complex than that of Main primarily due to the use of shorter sentences, as opposed to drastically simplified syntax or vocabulary. Comparing the two language varieties by the Gunning readability index supports this conclusion. We also report on the topical dependence of language complexity, that is, that the language is more advanced in conceptual articles compared to person-based (biographical) and object-based articles. Finally, we investigate the relation between conflict and language complexity by analyzing the content of the talk pages associated to controversial and peacefully developing articles, concluding that controversy has the effect of reducing language complexity."
https://openalex.org/W1968016907,"The transmembrane protein nephrin is a key component of the kidney slit diaphragm that contributes to the morphology of podocyte foot processes through signaling to the underlying actin cytoskeleton. We have recently reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tail of nephrin facilitates recruitment of Nck SH2/SH3 adaptor proteins and subsequent actin remodeling and that phosphorylation of the Nck binding sites on nephrin is decreased during podocyte injury. We now demonstrate that Nck directly modulates nephrin phosphorylation through formation of a signaling complex with the Src family kinase Fyn. The ability of Nck to enhance nephrin phosphorylation is compromised in the presence of a Src family kinase inhibitor and when the SH3 domains of Nck are mutated. Furthermore, induced loss of Nck expression in podocytes in vivo is associated with a rapid reduction in nephrin tyrosine phosphorylation. Our results suggest that Nck may facilitate dynamic signaling events at the slit diaphragm by promoting Fyn-dependent phosphorylation of nephrin, which may be important in the regulation of foot process morphology and response to podocyte injury."

In plants, MAPKs are involved in developmental processes including cytokinesis, cell differentiation and senescence, and in response to a broad range of environmental stresses, such as heavy metals, cold, pathogens, salinity, and UV-B radiation (1González Besteiro M.A. Bartels S.

Typically, MAPKs become active after dual phosphorylation of the TXY motif in their activation loop by MAPK kinases (MAPKKs) that were themselves phosphorylated and activated by upstream MAPKK kinases (MAPKKKs).

Otherwise, proteins were extracted exactly as described before (1González Besteiro M.A. Bartels S. Albert A. Ulm R. Arabidopsis MAP kinase phosphatase 1 and its target MAP kinases 3 and 6 antagonistically determine UV-B stress tolerance, independent of the UVR8 photoreceptor pathway.Plant J. 2011; 68: 727-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). For detection of MAP kinases, 15 μg of total protein extract were separated by electrophoresis in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. For detection of tagged MKP1, total cellular proteins or λ-phosphatase-treated extracts were separated in 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. For detection of endogenous MKP1, proteins were concentrated by Amicon Ultra 3K Centrifugal Filter Devices (Millipore) and 80 μg of the eluate were used for electrophoresis. Transfer to PVDF membranes was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were generated against a synthetic peptide derived from the MKP1 protein sequence (amino acids 755–770: CQMDLPKDTPIKIVRE) and were affinity purified against the peptide (Eurogentec). We used the primary antibodies anti-MKP1, anti-Glu-Glu (against Polyoma tag), anti-HA.11, anti-myc (Covance), anti-actin (Sigma-Aldrich), anti-MPK3, anti-MPK6 (24Bartels S. Anderson J.C.

Signal detection was performed using the ECL Plus Western Detection Kit (GE Healthcare). Data shown are representative for at least two independent experiments. RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) and treated with DNaseI according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA synthesis and quantitative RT-PCR were performed as previously described (24Bartels S.

Point mutations were introduced with the QuickChange II Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) using the primers listed in supplemental Table S1. Gateway-based cloning was used to insert the different versions of MKP1 into the binary vector pGWB518 (28Nakagawa T. Suzuki T. Murata S. Nakamura S. Hino T. Maeo K. Tabata R. Kawai T. Tanaka K.

Floral dip: a simplified method for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of Arabidopsis thaliana.Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments were performed with homozygous seeds in the T3 generation. The multiple sequence alignment was generated by ClustalW2 using a BLOSUM matrix (www.ebi.ac.uk) and edited by Jalview (www.jalview.org). To understand how MKP1 is regulated at the post-translational level, we used Arabidopsis seedlings expressing Polyoma epitope-tagged MKP1 (Pyo-MKP1) driven by the constitutive CaMV 35S promoter (24Bartels S. Anderson J.C. González Besteiro M.A. Carreri A. Hirt H. Buchala A. Metraux J.P. Peck S.C. Ulm R.

Treatment with UV-B resulted in a gel mobility shift of Pyo-MKP1, as detected by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1A). Consistently, UV-B exposure altered the mobility of endogenous MKP1 and of C-terminally truncated HA-MKP1ΔC243 (driven by the endogenous promoter) (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B). Electrophoretic mobility shifts are indicative of post-translational modifications and some MAP kinase phosphatases were shown to be phosphorylated in non-plant organisms (10Brondello J.M.

In vitro dephosphorylation of protein extracts by λ-phosphatase resulted in the elimination of the UV-B-dependent slow migrating form of Pyo-MKP1 and even further down-shifted the Pyo-MKP1 when compared with the control treatment (λ-phosphatase with phosphatase inhibitors) (Fig. 1B). Altogether, these data suggest that MKP1 is constitutively phosphorylated under standard growth conditions and that additional phosphorylation occurs upon stress treatment. From now on, we will refer to the constitutively phosphorylated form of Pyo-MKP1 as Pyo-MKP1 and to the slowest migrating form of Pyo-MKP1 appearing after stress treatment as phospho-Pyo-MKP1 (p-Pyo-MKP1) (Fig. 1B). In addition to MKP1 phosphorylation, higher levels of the Pyo-MKP1 protein were detected upon UV-B stress treatment within few minutes (Fig. 1A, supplemental Fig. S1B). As the Pyo-MKP1 was expressed using the constitutive CaMV 35S promoter (not responsive to UV-B; Ref. 31Safrany J. Haasz V. Mate Z. Ciolfi A. Feher B. Oravecz A. Stec A. Dallmann G. Morelli G. Ulm R. Nagy F. Identification of a novel cis-regulatory element for UV-B-induced transcription in Arabidopsis.Plant J. 2008; 54: 402-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), we examined the stability of the MKP1 protein by applying proteasome inhibitors in planta. In comparison to the DMSO mock control, combinatorial treatment with MG132 and ALLN resulted in accumulation of Pyo-MKP1, readily detectable under electrophoresis conditions that do not separate the differentially phosphorylated forms of Pyo-MKP1 (Fig. 2A; short run using 8% SDS-PAGE). This indicates an involvement of the proteasome in the constant degradation of Pyo-MKP1 under non-stress conditions. It is of note that both the faster and slower migrating forms of MKP1 were stabilized upon proteasome inhibitor treatment, suggesting that the accumulation of phosphorylated Pyo-MKP1 resulted in part from its reduced degradation (i.e. p-Pyo-MKP1 detectable in proteasome inhibitor but not DMSO control samples in -UV-B controls) (Fig. 2, B and C; 6% SDS-PAGE). In contrast to Pyo-MKP1, the protein levels of MPK3 and MPK6 were not affected by proteasome inhibition (Fig. 2C). A longer time course on MKP1 protein stability after UV-B stress release revealed that phospho-Pyo-MKP1 levels decreased more rapidly than those of the constitutively phosphorylated variant. Indeed Pyo-MKP1 remained in high amounts for at least 24 h after UV-B radiation (Fig. 2D). We performed qRT-PCR on UV-B-treated mkp1/Pro35S:Pyo-MKP1 plants to exclude regulation at the transcriptional or mRNA stability level. Similar to endogenous MKP1, Pyo-MKP1 mRNA levels remained unchanged after 20 min exposure to UV-B (supplemental Fig. S2), supporting that the immediate UV-B-induced accumulation of Pyo-MKP1 is a post-translational event. Surprisingly however, the stabilization of Pyo-MKP1 after return to non-stress conditions was associated with increased transcript levels (supplemental Fig. S2A). Therefore, as the 35S promoter is not affected by UV-B (31Safrany J. Haasz V. Mate Z. Ciolfi A. Feher B. Oravecz A. Stec A. Dallmann G. Morelli G. Ulm R. Nagy F. Identification of a novel cis-regulatory element for UV-B-induced transcription in Arabidopsis.Plant J. 2008; 54: 402-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), MKP1 mRNA stabilization could partly account for the protein accumulation observed after release from UV-B stress. However, such a mechanism remains to be unequivocally established. The mammalian MKP-1 and yeast Msg5 MAPK phosphatases were shown to be phosphorylated by their substrate MAPKs (10Brondello J.M. Pouysségur J. McKenzie F.R. Reduced MAP kinase phosphatase-1 degradation after p42/p44MAPK-dependent phosphorylation.Science. 1999; 286: 2514-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 30Flández M. Cosano I.C. Nombela C.

Chem. 2004; 279: 11027-11034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In addition, Arabidopsis MPK6 was found to phosphorylate MKP1 in vitro (14Park H.C. Song E.H. Nguyen X.C. Lee K. Kim K.E. Kim H.S. Lee S.M. Kim S.H. Bae D.W. Yun D.J. Chung W.S. Arabidopsis MAP kinase phosphatase 1 is phosphorylated and activated by its substrate AtMPK6.Plant Cell Rep. 2011; 30: 1523-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To investigate whether this feedback regulation takes place in vivo, we generated mpk6 mutants containing the Pro35S:Pyo-MKP1 transgene. In the absence of MPK6, Pyo-MKP1 was still phosphorylated in response to UV-B (Fig. 3, A and B). Moreover, MPK6 was dispensable for UV-B-induced phospho-Pyo-MKP1 stabilization (Fig. 3, A and B). However, out of presently unknown reason, the 35S-driven Pyo-MKP1 was less expressed and Pyo-MKP1 accumulated less in the mpk6 background (Fig. 3, B and C). Notwithstanding this, our data indicate that if MPK6 phosphorylates Pyo-MKP1 in vivo, additional kinase(s) may compensate for the loss of MPK6. Besides MPK6, MPK3 was shown to function in MKP1-regulated UV-B stress signaling (1González Besteiro M.A. Bartels S. Albert A. Ulm R. Arabidopsis MAP kinase phosphatase 1 and its target MAP kinases 3 and 6 antagonistically determine UV-B stress tolerance, independent of the UVR8 photoreceptor pathway.Plant J. 2011; 68: 727-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar); however, MPK3-mediated phosphorylation of MKP1 remains to be demonstrated. Our data suggest that MKP1 is not (exclusively) phosphorylated by MPK6, indicating that MPK3 and MPK6 could redundantly phosphorylate MKP1 in vivo or that the phosphorylation resulting in the mobility shift is independent of MPKs 3 and 6 or MAP kinases altogether. Arabidopsis MKP1 is a protein of 784 amino acids with 111 serine and 30 threonine residues, of which 13 have a proline at position +1 (Fig. 4A and supplemental Table S2), which is common among MAP kinase targets (32Sharrocks A.D.

This high number of potential serine/threonine phosphorylation sites suggests high complexity in MKP1 phosphorylation and in its experimental analysis. Nonetheless, to better predict functionally important phosphosites, we aligned MKP1 sequences from different plant species and focused on potential MAP kinase target sites. Four PXS/TP high stringency (Thr-64, Thr-109, Ser-295, Ser-309) and three XX(S/T)P low stringency (Ser-504, Ser-509, Ser-598) sites were conserved among the different MKP1 sequences (supplemental Fig. S3). Among these residues, in vivo phosphorylation of Ser-295 was previously identified by mass spectrometry in two different phosphoproteomic approaches (34Jones A.M. MacLean D. Studholme D.J.

https://openalex.org/W2053069138,"A large family of myotubularin phosphatases dephosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate, which are known to play important roles in vesicular trafficking and autophagy. The family is composed of 16 members, and understanding their regulatory mechanisms is important to understand their functions and related genetic diseases. We prepared anti-myotubularin-related protein 6 (MTMR6) monoclonal antibody and used it to study the regulatory mechanism of MTMR6. Endogenous MTMR6 was present in the cytoplasm and was condensed in the perinuclear region in a microtubule-dependent manner. MTMR6 preferentially interacted with GDP-bound Rab1B via the GRAM domain and partly overlapped with Rab1B in the pericentrosomal and peri-Golgi regions in normal rat kidney cells. Overexpression of GDP-bound Rab1B and the reduction of Rab1B disrupted the localization of MTMR6, suggesting that Rab1B regulates the localization of MTMR6. The reduction of MTMR6 accelerated the transport of vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein in which Rab1B is involved. Furthermore, reduction of MTMR6 or Rab1B inhibited the formation of the tubular omegasome that is induced by overexpression of DFCP1 in autophagy. Our results indicate that the cellular localization of MTMR6 is regulated by Rab1B in the early secretory and autophagic pathways. We propose a new regulatory mechanism of myotubularin phosphatase by the small GTPase Rab1B."

Recently, simultaneous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and PET have become available in the first generation of Hybrid MR-PET scanners. In this work, the elimination of artefacts due to head motion in PET neuroimages is achieved by a new approach utilising MR-based motion tracking in combination with PET list mode data motion correction for simultaneous MR-PET acquisitions. The method comprises accurate MR-based motion measurements, an intra-frame motion minimising and reconstruction time reducing temporal framing algorithm, and a list mode based PET reconstruction which utilises the Ordinary Poisson Algorithm and avoids axial and transaxial compression. Compared to images uncorrected for motion, an increased image quality is shown in phantom as well as in vivo images. In vivo motion corrected images show an evident increase of contrast at the basal ganglia and a good visibility of uptake in tiny structures such as superior colliculi."
https://openalex.org/W2019546048,"Aberrant expression of EGF receptors has been associated with hormone-refractory and metastatic prostate cancer (PCa). However, the molecular mechanism for EGF signaling in promoting PCa metastasis remains elusive. Using experimental models of PCa metastasis, we demonstrated that EGF could induce robust epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and increase invasiveness. Interestingly, EGF was found to be capable of promoting protein turnover of epithelial protein lost in neoplasm (EPLIN), a putative suppressor of EMT and tumor metastasis. Mechanistic study revealed that EGF could activate the phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation of EPLIN through an extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2)-dependent signaling cascade. Pharmacological inhibition of the ERK1/2 pathway effectively antagonized EGF-induced EPLIN degradation. Two serine residues, i.e. serine 362 and serine 604, were identified as putative ERK1/2 phosphorylation sites in human EPLIN, whose point mutation rendered resistance to EGF-induced protein turnover. This study elucidated a novel molecular mechanism for EGF regulation of EMT and invasiveness in PCa cells, indicating that blockade of EGF signaling could be beneficial in preventing and retarding PCa metastasis at early stages."
https://openalex.org/W2065828982,"Proteins secreted to the extracellular environment or to the periphery of the cell envelope, the secretome, play essential roles in foraging, antagonistic and mutualistic interactions. We hypothesize that arms races, genetic conflicts and varying selective pressures should lead to the rapid change of sequences and gene repertoires of the secretome. The analysis of 42 bacterial pan-genomes shows that secreted, and especially extracellular proteins, are predominantly encoded in the accessory genome, i.e. among genes not ubiquitous within the clade. Genes encoding outer membrane proteins might engage more frequently in intra-chromosomal gene conversion because they are more often in multi-genic families. The gene sequences encoding the secretome evolve faster than the rest of the genome and in particular at non-synonymous positions. Cell wall proteins in Firmicutes evolve particularly fast when compared with outer membrane proteins of Proteobacteria. Virulence factors are over-represented in the secretome, notably in outer membrane proteins, but cell localization explains more of the variance in substitution rates and gene repertoires than sequence homology to known virulence factors. Accordingly, the repertoires and sequences of the genes encoding the secretome change fast in the clades of obligatory and facultative pathogens and also in the clades of mutualists and free-living bacteria. Our study shows that cell localization shapes genome evolution. In agreement with our hypothesis, the repertoires and the sequences of genes encoding secreted proteins evolve fast. The particularly rapid change of extracellular proteins suggests that these public goods are key players in bacterial adaptation."
https://openalex.org/W2039331237,"Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has been shown to improve left ventricular function and survival in rats with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and this maneuver has also been adopted clinically for the treatment of patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). Recent in vitro and in vivo studies have suggested that VNS can modulate the level of pro-inflammatory factors. Despite the beneficial effects of VNS, the stimulation parameters for obtaining favorable outcomes appear highly variable. To optimize VNS parameters, we set up different stimulation protocols with different pulse width (1–2 ms), frequency (1–6 Hz), voltage (1–6 V) and duration (40–240 min) of VNS by uniform design (UD). Rats were divided into seven groups with (Group1–Group6) or without VNS (MI group). Our results demonstrate that (1) the parameter sets in Group1, Group2 and Group3 yield the best post-MI protection by VNS, while the protective role were not observed in Group4, Group5 and Group6; (2) baroreflex sensitivity and the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor level were also increased in Group1, Group2 and Group3. (3) the parameter set in Group1 (G1:1 ms, 2 Hz, 3 V, 240 min) is judged the most optimal parameter in this study as rats in this group not only showed a reduced myocardial injury with better-preserved cardiac function compared with other groups, more important, but also exhibited minimal heart rate (HR) reduction. (4) the duration of VNS plays an important role in determining the protection effect of VNS. In conclusion, VNS displays a beneficial role in Group1, Group2 and Group3. Of note, the parameter set in Group1 provides the most optimal cardioprotective effect. These results may provide insight into development of novel treatment for ischemic heart diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1984816362,"PadR-like transcriptional regulators form a structurally-related family of proteins that control the expression of genes associated with detoxification, virulence and multi-drug resistance in bacteria. Only a few members of this family have been studied by genetic, biochemical and biophysical methods, and their structure/function relationships are still largely undefined. Here, we report the crystal structures of two PadR-like proteins from Bacillus cereus, which we named bcPadR1 and bcPadR2 (products of gene loci BC4206 and BCE3449 in strains ATCC 14579 and ATCC 10987, respectively). BC4206, together with its neighboring gene BC4207, was previously shown to become significantly upregulated in presence of the bacteriocin AS-48. DNA mobility shift assays reveal that bcPadR1 binds to a 250 bp intergenic region containing the putative BC4206-BC4207 promoter sequence, while in-situ expression of bcPadR1 decreases bacteriocin tolerance, together suggesting a role for bcPadR1 as repressor of BC4206-BC4207 transcription. The function of bcPadR2 (48% identical in sequence to bcPadR1) is unknown, but the location of its gene just upstream from genes encoding a putative antibiotic ABC efflux pump, suggests a role in regulating antibiotic resistance. The bcPadR proteins are structurally similar to LmrR, a PadR-like transcription regulator in Lactococcus lactis that controls expression of a multidrug ABC transporter via a mechanism of multidrug binding and induction. Together these proteins define a subfamily of conserved, relatively small PadR proteins characterized by a single C-terminal helix for dimerization. Unlike LmrR, bcPadR1 and bcPadR2 lack a central pore for ligand binding, making it unclear whether the transcriptional regulatory roles of bcPadR1 and bcPadR2 involve direct ligand recognition and induction."

In this paper we demonstrate that an all optical technique, based on non-linear upconversion of infrared ultrashort laser pulses and on multiple view acquisition, allows the reduction of scattering effects in tomographic imaging. This technique, namely Time-Gated Optical Projection Tomography (TGOPT), is used to reconstruct three dimensionally the internal structure of adult zebrafish without staining or clearing agents. This method extends the use of Optical Projection Tomography to optically diffusive samples yielding reconstructions with reduced artifacts, increased contrast and improved resolution with respect to those obtained with non-gated techniques.

https://openalex.org/W2105131369,"Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) deficiency causes elevated high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels; its impact on HDL functionality however remains elusive. We compared functional and compositional properties of HDL derived from 9 Caucasian heterozygous CETP mutation carriers (splice-site mutation in intron 7 resulting in premature truncation) with those of 9 age- and sex-matched normolipidemic family controls. As expected, HDL-C levels were increased 1.5-fold, and CETP mass and activity were decreased by -31% and -38% respectively, in carriers versus non-carriers. HDL particles from carriers were enriched in CE (up to +19%, p<0.05) and depleted of triglycerides (TG; up to -54%, p<0.01), resulting in a reduced TG/CE ratio (up to 2.5-fold, p<0.01). In parallel, the apoA-I content was increased in HDL from carriers (up to +22%, p<0.05). Both the total HDL fraction and small, dense HDL3 particles from CETP-deficient subjects displayed normal antioxidative activity by attenuating low-density lipoprotein oxidation with similar efficacy on a particle mass basis as compared to control HDL3. Consistent with these data, circulating levels of systemic biomarkers of oxidative stress (8-isoprostanes) were similar between the two groups. These findings support the contention that HDL functionality is maintained in heterozygous CETP deficiency despite modifications in lipid and protein composition."
https://openalex.org/W2091023250,"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been shown to modulate cortical excitability. A small number of studies suggested that tDCS modulates the response to experimental pain paradigms. No trials have been conducted to evaluate the response of patients already suffering from pain, to an additional experimental pain before and after tDCS. The present study investigated the effect of a single session of anodal, cathodal and sham stimulation (15 mins/1 mA) over the primary motor cortex on the perceived intensity of repeated noxious thermal and electrical stimuli and on elements of quantitative sensory testing (thermal pain and perception thresholds) applied to the right hand in 15 patients with chronic low back pain. The study was conducted in a double-blind sham-controlled and cross-over design. No significant alterations of pain ratings were found. Modalities of quantitative sensory testing remained equally unchanged. It is therefore hypothesized that a single 15 mins session of tDCS at 1 mA may not be sufficient to alter the perception of experimental pain and in patients with chronic pain. Further studies applying repetitive tDCS to patients with chronic pain are required to fully answer the question whether experimental pain perception may be influenced by tDCS over the motor cortex."

We addressed this question using Baited Remote Underwater Videos (BRUVs) to assess fish assemblages of sedimentary habitats at six distances from rocky reefs (0, 25, 50, 100, 200, and 400 m) at four sites in subtropical eastern Australia. Distance from reef was important in determining fish assemblage structure, and there was no overlap between reef sites and sedimentary sites 400 m from reef. While there was a gradient in assemblage structure at intermediate distances, this was not consistent across sites. All sites, however, supported a mixed ‘halo’ assemblage comprising both reef and sediment species at sampling stations close to reef. BRUVs used in conjunction with high-resolution bathymetric and backscatter spatial data can resolve differences in assemblage structure at small spatial scales (10s to 100s of metres), and has further application in unconsolidated habitats. Unless a ‘reef halo’ assemblage is being examined, a minimum of 200 m but preferably 400 m distance from any hard substrate is recommended when designing broader-scale assessments of fish assemblages of sedimentary habitats."
https://openalex.org/W2000543721,"The type II secretion system is a multiprotein assembly spanning the inner and outer membranes in Gram-negative bacteria. It is found in almost all pathogenic bacteria where it contributes to virulence, host tissue colonization, and infection. The exoproteins are secreted across the outer membrane via a large translocation channel, the secretin, which typically adopts a dodecameric structure. These secretin channels have large periplasmic N-terminal domains that reach out into the periplasm for communication with the inner membrane platform and with a pseudopilus structure that spans the periplasm. Here we report the crystal structure of the N-terminal periplasmic domain of the secretin XcpQ from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, revealing a two-lobe dimeric assembly featuring parallel subunits engaging in well defined interactions at the tips of each lobe. We have employed structure-based engineering of disulfide bridges and native mass spectrometry to show that the periplasmic domain of XcpQ dimerizes in a concentration-dependent manner. Validation of these insights in the context of cellular full-length XcpQ and further evaluation of the functionality of disulfide-linked XcpQ establishes that the basic oligomerization unit of XcpQ is a dimer. This is consistent with the notion that the dodecameric secretin assembles as a hexamer of dimers to ensure correct projection of the N-terminal domains into the periplasm. Therefore, our studies provide a key conceptual advancement in understanding the assembly principles and dynamic function of type II secretion system secretins and challenge recent studies reporting monomers as the basic subunit of the secretin oligomer."
https://openalex.org/W2146800213,"Background Regulation of immune responses is critical for controlling inflammation and disruption of this process can lead to tissue damage. We reported that CXCL13 was induced in fallopian tube tissue following C. trachomatis infection. Here, we examined the influence of the CXCL13-CXCR5 axis in chlamydial genital infection. Methodology and Principal Findings Disruption of the CXCL13-CXCR5 axis by injecting anti-CXCL13 Ab to BALB/c mice or using Cxcr5−/− mice increased chronic inflammation in the upper genital tract (UGT; uterine horns and oviducts) after Chlamydia muridarum genital infection (GT). Further studies in Cxcr5−/− mice showed an elevation in bacterial burden in the GT and increased numbers of neutrophils, activated DCs and activated NKT cells early after infection. After resolution, we noted increased fibrosis and the accumulation of a variety of T cells subsets (CD4-IFNγ, CD4-IL-17, CD4-IL-10 & CD8-TNFα) in the oviducts. NKT cell depletion in vitro reduced IL-17α and various cytokines and chemokines, suggesting that activated NKT cells modulate neutrophils and DCs through cytokine/chemokine secretion. Further, chlamydial glycolipids directly activated two distinct types of NKT cell hybridomas in a cell-free CD1d presentation assay and genital infection of Cd1d−/− mice showed reduced oviduct inflammation compared to WT mice. CXCR5 involvement in pathology was also noted using single-nucleotide polymorphism analysis in C. trachomatis infected women attending a sub-fertility clinic. Women who developed tubal pathology after a C. trachomatis infection had a decrease in the frequency of CXCR5 SNP +10950 T>C (rs3922). Conclusions/Significance These experiments indicate that disruption of the CXCL13-CXCR5 axis permits increased activation of NKT cells by type I and type II glycolipids of Chlamydia muridarum and results in UGT pathology potentially through increased numbers of neutrophils and T cell subsets associated with UGT pathology. In addition, CXCR5 appears to contribute to inter-individual differences in human tubal pathology following C. trachomatis infection."
https://openalex.org/W2081317256,"In spite of numerous investigations of regenerating salamander limbs, little attention has been paid to the details of how joints are reformed. An understanding of the process and mechanisms of joint regeneration in this model system for tetrapod limb regeneration would provide insights into developing novel therapies for inducing joint regeneration in humans. To this end, we have used the axolotl (Mexican Salamander) model of limb regeneration to describe the morphology and the expression patterns of marker genes during joint regeneration in response to limb amputation. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the mechanisms of joint formation whether it be development or regeneration are conserved. We also have determined that defects in the epiphyseal region of both forelimbs and hind limbs in the axolotl are regenerated only when the defect is small. As is the case with defects in the diaphysis, there is a critical size above which the endogenous regenerative response is not sufficient to regenerate the joint. This non-regenerative response in an animal that has the ability to regenerate perfectly provides the opportunity to screen for the signaling pathways to induce regeneration of articular cartilage and joints."
https://openalex.org/W2043432944,"We study the standard SIS model of epidemic spreading on networks where individuals have a fluctuating number of connections around a preferred degree . Using very simple rules for forming such preferred degree networks, we find some unusual statistical properties not found in familiar Erdös-Rényi or scale free networks. By letting depend on the fraction of infected individuals, we model the behavioral changes in response to how the extent of the epidemic is perceived. In our models, the behavioral adaptations can be either ‘blind’ or ‘selective’ – depending on whether a node adapts by cutting or adding links to randomly chosen partners or selectively, based on the state of the partner. For a frozen preferred network, we find that the infection threshold follows the heterogeneous mean field result and the phase diagram matches the predictions of the annealed adjacency matrix (AAM) approach. With ‘blind’ adaptations, although the epidemic threshold remains unchanged, the infection level is substantially affected, depending on the details of the adaptation. The ‘selective’ adaptive SIS models are most interesting. Both the threshold and the level of infection changes, controlled not only by how the adaptations are implemented but also how often the nodes cut/add links (compared to the time scales of the epidemic spreading). A simple mean field theory is presented for the selective adaptations which capture the qualitative and some of the quantitative features of the infection phase diagram."
https://openalex.org/W2052801177,"The Formyl Peptide Receptor 1 (FPR1) is an important chemotaxis receptor involved in various aspects of host defense and inflammatory processes. We constructed a model of FPR1 using as a novel template the chemokine receptor CXCR4 from the same branch of the phylogenetic tree of G-protein-coupled receptors. The previously employed template of rhodopsin contained a bulge at the extracellular part of TM2 which directly influenced binding of ligands. We also conducted molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of FPR1 in the apo form as well as in a form complexed with the agonist fMLF and the antagonist tBocMLF in the model membrane. During all MD simulation of the fMLF-FPR1 complex a water molecule transiently bridged the hydrogen bond between W254(6.48) and N108(3.35) in the middle of the receptor. We also observed a change in the cytoplasmic part of FPR1 of a rotamer of the Y301(7.53) residue (tyrosine rotamer switch). This effect facilitated movement of more water molecules toward the receptor center. Such rotamer of Y301(7.53) was not observed in any crystal structures of GPCRs which can suggest that this state is temporarily formed to pass the water molecules during the activation process. The presence of a distance between agonist and residues R201(5.38) and R205(5.42) on helix TM5 may suggest that the activation of FPR1 is similar to the activation of β-adrenergic receptors since their agonists are separated from serine residues on helix TM5. The removal of water molecules bridging these interactions in FPR1 can result in shrinking of the binding site during activation similarly to the shrinking observed in β-ARs. The number of GPCR crystal structures with agonists is still scarce so the designing of new ligands with agonistic properties is hampered, therefore homology modeling and docking can provide suitable models. Additionally, the MD simulations can be beneficial to outline the mechanisms of receptor activation and the agonist/antagonist sensing."
https://openalex.org/W2018120743,"Inhibiting the growth of tumor vasculature represents one of the relevant strategies against tumor progression. Between all the different pro-angiogenic molecular targets, plasma membrane glycosphingolipids have been under-investigated. In this present study, we explore the anti-angiogenic therapeutic advantage of a tumor immunotherapy targeting the globotriaosylceramide Gb3. In this purpose, a monoclonal antibody against Gb3, named 3E2 was developed and characterized. We first demonstrate that Gb3 is over-expressed in proliferative endothelial cells relative to quiescent cells. Then, we demonstrate that 3E2 inhibits endothelial cell proliferation in vitro by slowing endothelial cell proliferation and by increasing mitosis duration. Antibody 3E2 is further effective in inhibiting ex vivo angiogenesis in aorta ring assays. Moreover, 3E2 treatment inhibits NXS2 neuroblastoma development and liver metastases spreading in A/J mice. Immunohistology examination of the NXS2 metastases shows that only endothelial cells, but not cancer cells express Gb3. Finally, 3E2 treatment diminishes tumor vessels density, proving a specific therapeutic action of our monoclonal antibody to tumor vasculature. Our study demonstrates that Gb3 is a viable alternative target for immunotherapy and angiogenesis inhibition."

H89 has been extensively used in vitro but its anti-inflammatory potential in vivo has not been reported to date. To assess the anti-inflammatory properties of H89 in mouse models of asthma. Methodology/Principal Findings Mice were sensitized intraperitoneally (i.p.) to ovalbumin (OVA) with or without alum, and challenged intranasally with OVA. H89 (10 mg/kg) or vehicle was given i.p. two hours before each OVA challenge. Airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) was assessed by whole-body barometric plethysmography. Inflammation was assessed by the total and differential cell counts and IL-4 and IL-5 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. Lung inflammation, mucus production and mast cell numbers were analyzed after histochemistry. We show that treatment with H89 reduces AHR, lung inflammation, mast cell numbers and mucus production. H89 also inhibits IL-4 and IL-5 production and infiltration of eosinophils, neutrophils and lymphocytes in BAL fluid. Conclusions/Significance Taken together, our findings implicate that blockade of AGC kinases may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of allergic airway inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2009405377,"Aim Our aim was to assess which specific factors are contributing to an increased risk of migraine in a group of 131 Portuguese families. Methods We studied 319 first-degree relatives, using a multilevel approach to account for the dependency among members from the same family. We included in the model relative’s gender, the proband’s gender and age-at-onset, to evaluate if any of these variables were associated with relative’s affection status. We also included in the model proband’s migraine subtype. We further assessed female and male transmissions within the proband nuclear family. Results Relatives’ gender was found to be a risk factor for migraine (Odds Ratio = 2.86; 95% CI = 1.75–4.67), with females at a higher risk. When splitting probands according to their migraine subtype, we found that none of the variables studied contributed to relatives of MA-probands affection-status. Our results also show a significant difference between proband’s transmission and the gender of the parents and offspring. Conclusions With this study, we showed that gender is truly a risk factor for migraine and that a gender-biased transmission is also observed. This reinforce the importance of identifying genes associated with migraine that are modulated by genes located in the sex chromosomes and the study of mitochondrial DNA or X-chromosome and hormonal-related effects associated with migraine susceptibility."
https://openalex.org/W2157471384,"Knowledge of human origins, migrations, and expansions is greatly enhanced by the availability of large datasets of genetic information from different populations and by the development of bioinformatic tools used to analyze the data. We present Ancestry Mapper, which we believe improves on existing methods, for the assignment of genetic ancestry to an individual and to study the relationships between local and global populations. The principle function of the method, named Ancestry Mapper, is to give each individual analyzed a genetic identifier, made up of just 51 genetic coordinates, that corresponds to its relationship to the HGDP reference population. As a consequence, the Ancestry Mapper Id (AMid) has intrinsic biological meaning and provides a tool to measure similarity between world populations. We applied Ancestry Mapper to a dataset comprised of the HGDP and HapMap data. The results show distinctions at the continental level, while simultaneously giving details at the population level. We clustered AMids of HGDP/HapMap and observe a recapitulation of human migrations: for a small number of clusters, individuals are grouped according to continental origins; for a larger number of clusters, regional and population distinctions are evident. Calculating distances between AMids allows us to infer ancestry. The number of coordinates is expandable, increasing the power of Ancestry Mapper. An R package called Ancestry Mapper is available to apply this method to any high density genomic data set."
https://openalex.org/W2078931221,"Three target words (T1, T2, and T3) were embedded in a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) stream of non-word distractors, and participants were required to report the targets at the end of each RSVP stream. T2 and T3 were semantically related words in half of the RSVP streams, and semantically unrelated words in the other half of the RSVP streams. Using an identical design, a recent study reported distinct reflections of the T2–T3 semantic relationship on the P2 and N400 components of event-related potentials (ERPs) time-locked to T3, suggesting an early, automatic, source of P2 semantic effects and a late, controlled, source of N400 semantic effects. Here, P2 and N400 semantic effects were examined by manipulating list-wide context. Relative to participants performing in a semantically unbiased context, participants over-exposed to filler RSVP streams always including semantically related T2/T3 words reported a dilution of T3-locked P2 semantic effects and a magnification of T3-locked N400 semantic effects. Opposite effects on P2 and N400 ERP components of list-wide semantic context are discussed in relation to recent proposals on the representational status of RSVP targets at processing stages prior to consolidation in visual short-term memory."
https://openalex.org/W2104073444,"Tissue water transverse relaxation times (T2) are highly sensitive to fluid and lipid accumulations in skeletal muscles whereas the related T2* is sensitive to changes in tissue oxygenation in addition to factors affecting T2. Diabetes mellitus (DM) affects muscles of lower extremities progressively by impairing blood flow at the macrovascular and microvascular levels. This study is to investigate whether T2 and T2* are sensitive enough to detect abnormalities in skeletal muscles of diabetic patients in the resting state. T2 and T2* values in calf muscle of 18 patients with type 2 DM (T2DM), 22 young healthy controls (YHC), and 7 age-matched older healthy controls (OHC) were measured at 3T using multi-TE spin echo and gradient echo sequences. Regional lipid levels of the soleus muscle were also measured using the Dixon method in a subset of the subjects. Correlations between T2, T2*, lipid levels, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and presence of diabetes were evaluated. We found that T2 values were significantly higher in calf muscles of T2DM subjects, as were T2* values in anterior tibialis, and gastrocnemius muscles of T2DM participants. However, soleus T2* values of the T2DM subjects were significantly lower than those of the older, age-matched HC cohort (22.9±0.5 vs 26.7±0.4 ms, p<0.01). The soleus T2* values in the T2DM cohort were inversely correlated with the presence of diabetes (t = -3.46, p<0.001) and with an increase in HbA1c, but not with body mass index or regional lipid levels. Although multiple factors may contribute to changes in T2* values, the lowered T2* value observed in the T2DM soleus muscle is most consistent with a combination of high oxygen consumption and poor regional perfusion. This finding is consistent with results of previous perfusion studies and suggests that the soleus in individuals with T2DM is likely under tissue oxygenation stress."
https://openalex.org/W2114018157,"While many decisions rely on real time quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis few attempts have hitherto been made to quantify bounds of precision accounting for the various sources of variation involved in the measurement process. Besides influences of more obvious factors such as camera noise and pipetting variation, changing efficiencies within and between reactions affect PCR results to a degree which is not fully recognized. Here, we develop a statistical framework that models measurement error and other sources of variation as they contribute to fluorescence observations during the amplification process and to derived parameter estimates. Evaluation of reproducibility is then based on simulations capable of generating realistic variation patterns. To this end, we start from a relatively simple statistical model for the evolution of efficiency in a single PCR reaction and introduce additional error components, one at a time, to arrive at stochastic data generation capable of simulating the variation patterns witnessed in repeated reactions (technical repeats). Most of the variation in values was adequately captured by the statistical model in terms of foreseen components. To recreate the dispersion of the repeats' plateau levels while keeping the other aspects of the PCR curves within realistic bounds, additional sources of reagent consumption (side reactions) enter into the model. Once an adequate data generating model is available, simulations can serve to evaluate various aspects of PCR under the assumptions of the model and beyond."

Furthermore, the association of RNA polymerase II with the GAL1 promoter is significantly decreased in the absence of Rad14p, when the coding sequence was deleted.

https://openalex.org/W2086254740,"Glutamate transporters in the brain remove the neurotransmitter from the synapse by cotransport with three sodium ions into the surrounding cells. Recent structural work on an archaeal homolog suggests that, during substrate translocation, the transport domain, including the peripheral transmembrane helix 3 (TM3), moves relative to the trimerization domain in an elevator-like process. Moreover, two TM3 residues have been proposed to form part of a transient Na3′ site, and another, Tyr-124, appears close to both Na3′ and Na1. To obtain independent evidence for the role of TM3 in glutamate transport, each of its 31 amino acid residues from the glial GLT-1 transporter was individually mutated to cysteine. Except for six mutants, substantial transport activity was detected. Aqueous accessibility of the introduced cysteines was probed with membrane-permeant and membrane-impermeant sulfhydryl reagents under a variety of conditions. Transport of six single cysteine mutants, all located on the intracellular side of TM3, was affected by membrane-permeant sulfhydryl reagents.

Because of the limited resolution of the GltPh structure, Tl+ ions, which exhibit a robust anomalous scattering signal, have been used in an attempt to visualize the sodium sites in this homolog (11Boudker O.

Two Tl+ sites were identified. However, in contrast to Na+, Tl+ could not support transport (11Boudker O. Ryan R.M. Yernool D. Shimamoto K. Gouaux E.

The side chains of four conserved residues participate in this site, namely Asn-366 and Asp-368 from TM7 and Tyr-123 and Thr-127 from TM3, using the numbering of the glial transporter GLT-1 (Fig. 1, B and C). transmembrane helix (2-trimethylammonium)ethyl methanethiosulfonate N-ethylmaleimide 2-aminoethyl methanethiosulfonate dl-threo-β-benzyloxyaspartate. Recent studies indicate that substrate translocation by GltPh, as well as by the neuronal transporter EAAC1, occurs by an “elevator-like” mechanism (12Reyes N. Ginter C. Boudker O.

Slotboom D.J. Rigidity of the subunit interfaces of the trimeric glutamate transporter GltT during translocation.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 565-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Because TM3 is located at the periphery of the transport domain and suggested to participate in sodium binding, we set out to obtain independent evidence for the role of TM3 in glutamate transport. For this purpose, we introduced cysteine residues at each of the 31 TM3 positions of a cysteine-less version of GLT-1. Aqueous accessibility of the introduced cysteines was probed with membrane-permeant and membrane-impermeant sulfhydryl reagents under conditions favoring either inward- or outward-facing conformations. Two conformationally sensitive positions were observed: 120 and 124. The reactivity of A120C was diminished under conditions favoring the outward-facing conformation of the transporter. On the other hand, modification by 2-aminoethyl methanethiosulfonate of Y124C, which is located close to the Na1 and Na3′ sites, was fully protected in the presence of sodium. Mutations were made by site-directed mutagenesis of cysteine-less WT GLT-1 (18Grunewald M. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I.

Identification of tryptophan residues critical for the function and targeting of the γ-aminobutyric acid transporter (subtype A).J. Biol.

Uracil-containing single-stranded DNA was isolated from one of the transformants upon growth in uridine-containing medium, according to the standard Stratagene protocol, using R408 helper phage. This yields the sense strand, and consequently, mutagenic primers were designed to be antisense. The resulting mutant DNA plasmid was then sequenced in its entirety to verify the mutation and to ensure that no other mutations were introduced. HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 200 units/ml penicillin, 200 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. Infection with recombinant vaccinia/T7 virus vTF7-3 (40Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B.

U.S.A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1874) Google Scholar), subsequent transfection with plasmid DNA, and d-[3H]aspartate transport were performed as described previously (41Pines G. Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. Glutamate 404 is involved in the substrate discrimination of GLT-1, a (Na+ + K+)-coupled glutamate transporter from rat brain.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17093-17097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In all of the experiments described, the expression vector used was pBluescript SK−, and all transport data were corrected for those obtained with cells transfected with the vector alone. In the case of the wild type, transport values were typically 25-fold over this background, and even for the low-activity Y124C mutant, the signal-to-noise ratio was at least 4-fold. Kinetic constants were determined using the standard transport solution (200 μl/well) containing d-aspartate concentrations ranging from 0 to 20 μm and supplemented with 0.8 μm d-[3H]aspartate (10 Ci/mmol) per well. Transport was done for 3 min for the determination of initial rates. Km and Vmax were calculated from linear regression using the Lineweaver-Burk plot. Prior to transport assay, cells adhering to 24-well plates were washed once with 1 ml of transport medium containing 150 mm choline chloride instead of NaCl. Each well was then incubated at room temperature with 200 μl of preincubation medium (the different compositions are indicated in the figure legends) with the indicated concentrations of sulfhydryl reagents, (2-trimethylammonium)ethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSET; Anatrace), N-ethylmaleimide (NEM; Sigma-Aldrich), or 2-aminoethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSEA; Anatrace). After 5 min, the medium was aspirated, and the cells were washed twice with 1 ml of transport medium, followed by d-[3H]aspartate transport. For each mutant, the concentration of the different sulfhydryl reagents (see figure legends) chosen was determined after preliminary titration experiments in choline-containing medium for each mutant separately. An example of such a titration is shown in Fig. 5B. The aim of these titrations was to find a concentration at which the reagent caused a partial inhibition so that the effects of the different preincubation conditions could be seen most clearly. Results were plotted using normalized data for each mutant, where the untreated activity levels are defined as 100%. Labeling of wild-type and mutant transporters at the cell surface using Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce), quenching the reaction, cell lysis, and isolation of the biotinylated proteins by streptavidin-agarose beads (Pierce) were done as described previously (42Bennett E.R.

After SDS-PAGE (10% gel) and transfer to nitrocellulose, the GLT-1 protein was detected with an affinity-purified antibody directed against a polyclonal antibody raised against GLT-1 purified from rat brain (43Danbolt N.C. Storm-Mathisen J. Kanner B.I. An (Na+ + K+)-coupled l-glutamate transporter purified from rat brain is located in glial cell processes.Neuroscience. 1992; 51: 295-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) at a 1:5000 dilution, with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody at a 1:40,000 dilution, and with ECL. 1% goat serum was present in all antibody, blocking, and washing solutions to minimize the appearance of nonspecific bands. Models of rat trimeric GLT-1 were constructed using a 2.96 Å resolution structure of GltPh (Protein Data Bank code 2NWL) as a template with MODELLER 9v6 (44Sali A. Blundell T.L. Comparative protein modelling by satisfaction of spatial restraints.J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10552) Google Scholar). To create the alignment, we first identified 250 sequence homologs each of rat GLT-1, GltPh, and EAAC1 with PSI-BLAST using five iterations with an E-value cutoff of 0.005 for inclusion in the next round. The two sets of 250 sequences were then clustered to remove redundant sequence homologs with >70% identical residues using CD-HIT (45Li W. Jaroszewski L. Godzik A. Clustering of highly homologous sequences to reduce the size of large protein databases.Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 282-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar) and aligned using T-Coffee version 5.31 (46Notredame C. Higgins D.G. Heringa J. T-Coffee: a novel method for fast and accurate multiple sequence alignment.J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (5469) Google Scholar). After extracting the sequences of rat GLT-1 and GltPh and removing 52 residues between helices 4b and 4c, as well as 44 N-terminal and 73 C-terminal residues, the final alignment (supplemental Fig. 1) contained 34.6% identical residues. Guided by this alignment, at least 300 models were built; one with a reasonable molpdf score and optimal Ramachandran plot distributions was selected for further modeling. The resulting model of the outward-open conformation of rat GLT-1 has 13 and 5 residues in the generously allowed and disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot, respectively, similar to the template structure (i.e. 18 and 5 residues, respectively, for Protein Data Bank code 2NWW). For the outward-occluded conformation of rat GLT-1, there are 16 generously allowed and 5 disallowed positions, compared with 10 and 7, respectively, for the template structure (Protein Data Bank code 2NWL). None of these residues interact directly with the ions, substrates, or cysteine-modified side chains. In each of the protomers, an aspartate was modeled in the substrate-binding site by analogy with the substrate-bound structure (code 2NWL), and sodium ions were added at the positions of all four proposed binding sites because it was not yet clear which would be bound simultaneously. Hydrogen atoms were added according to Ref. 47Forrest L.R. Honig B.

https://openalex.org/W1998843803,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Vif is essential for viral evasion of the host antiviral protein APOBEC3G (APO3G). The Vif protein from a distantly related African green monkey (Agm) simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVagm) is unable to suppress the antiviral activity of human APO3G but is active against Agm APO3G. SIVmac Vif on the other hand, possesses antiviral activity against both human and Agm APO3G. In this study, we were interested in mapping domains in SIVmac Vif that are responsible for its dual activity against human and Agm APO3G. We constructed a series of Vif chimeras by swapping domains in SIVmac Vif with equivalent regions from SIVagm Vif and determined their activity against human and Agm APO3G. We found that replacing any region in SIVmac Vif by corresponding fragments from SIVagm Vif only moderately reduced the activity of the chimeras against Agm APO3G but in all cases resulted in a severe loss of activity against human APO3G. These results suggest that the domains in SIVmac Vif required for targeting human and Agm APO3G are distinct and cannot be defined as linear amino acid motifs but rather appear to depend on the overall structure of full-length SIVmac Vif."
https://openalex.org/W1984130609,"V H+-ATPase has an important role in a variety of key physiological processes. This enzyme is reversibly activated/partly inactivated by the addition/exhaustion of extracellular glucose. The current model of its regulation assumes the reversible disassembly/reassembly of ∼60–70% of the V1 and V0 membrane complexes, which are responsible for ATP hydrolysis and H+ conductance, respectively. The number of assembled complexes determines the pump activity because disassembled complexes are inactive. The model predicts the identical catalytic properties for the activated and semi-active enzymes molecules. To verify the model predictions we have isolated total membranes from yeast spheroplasts that were pre-incubated either with or without glucose. Nitrate treatment of membranes revealed the similar ATPase inhibition for two enzyme states, suggesting that they have identical structures that are essential for ATP hydrolysis. However, H+ transport was inhibited more than the ATPase activities, indicating a nitrate uncoupling action, which was significantly higher for the nonactivated enzyme. This finding suggests that the structure of the non-activated enzyme, which is essential for H+ transport, is less stable than that of the activated enzyme. Moreover, the glucose activation of the pump increases i) its coupling capacity; ii) its KM for ATP hydrolysis and ATP affinity for H+ transport; iii) the Vmax for H+ transport in comparison with the Vmax for ATP hydrolysis and iv) the immune reactivity of catalytic subunit A and regulatory subunit B by 9.3 and 2.4 times, respectively. The protein content of subunits A and B was not changed by extracellular glucose. We propose that instead of the dissociation/reassociation of complexes V1 and V0, changes in the extracellular glucose concentration cause reversible and asymmetrical modulations in the immune reactivity of subunits A and B by their putative biochemical modifications. This response asymmetrically modulates H+-transport and ATP hydrolysis, exhibiting distinct properties for the activated versus non-activated enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2030185273,"The use of biological scaffold materials for wound healing and tissue remodeling has profoundly impacted regenerative medicine and tissue engineering. The porcine-derived small intestinal submucosa (SIS) is a licensed bioscaffold material regularly used in wound and tissue repair, often in contaminated surgical fields. Complications and failures due to infection of this biomaterial have therefore been a major concern and challenge. SIS can be colonized and infected by wound-associated bacteria, particularly Staphylococcus aureus. In order to address this concern and develop novel intervention strategies, the immune microenvironment orchestrated by the combined action of S. aureus and SIS should be critically evaluated. Since the outcome of tissue remodeling is largely controlled by the local immune microenvironment, we assessed the innate immune profile in terms of cytokine/chemokine microenvironment and inflammasome-responsive genes. BALB/c mice were injected intra-peritoneally with heat-killed S. aureus in the presence or absence of SIS. Analyses of cytokines, chemokines and microarray profiling of inflammasome-related genes were done using peritoneal lavages collected 24 hours after injection. Results showed that unlike SIS, the S. aureus-SIS interactome was characterized by a Th1-biased immune profile with increased expressions of IFN-γ, IL-12 and decreased expressions of IL-4, IL-13, IL-33 and IL-6. Such modulation of the Th1/Th2 axis can greatly facilitate graft rejections. The S. aureus-SIS exposure also augmented the expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1β, Tnf-α, CD30L, Eotaxin and Fractalkine. This heightened inflammatory response caused by S. aureus contamination could enormously affect the biocompatibility of SIS. However, the mRNA expressions of many inflammasome-related genes like Nlrp3, Aim2, Card6 and Pycard were down-regulated by heat-killed S. aureus with or without SIS. In summary, our study explored the innate immune microenvironment induced by the combined exposure of SIS and S. aureus. These results have practical implications in developing strategies to contain infection and promote successful tissue repair."
