https://openalex.org/W1918185049,"Synaptic mitochondria are thought to be critical in supporting neuronal energy requirements at the synapse, and bioenergetic failure at the synapse may impair neural transmission and contribute to neurodegeneration. However, little is known about the energy requirements of synaptic vesicle release or whether these energy requirements go unmet in disease, primarily due to a lack of appropriate tools and sensitive assays. To determine the dependence of synaptic vesicle cycling on mitochondrially derived ATP levels, we developed two complementary assays sensitive to mitochondrially derived ATP in individual, living hippocampal boutons. The first is a functional assay for mitochondrially derived ATP that uses the extent of synaptic vesicle cycling as a surrogate for ATP level. The second uses ATP FRET sensors to directly measure ATP at the synapse. Using these assays, we show that endocytosis has high ATP requirements and that vesicle reacidification and exocytosis require comparatively little energy. We then show that to meet these energy needs, mitochondrially derived ATP is rapidly dispersed in axons, thereby maintaining near normal levels of ATP even in boutons lacking mitochondria. As a result, the capacity for synaptic vesicle cycling is similar in boutons without mitochondria as in those with mitochondria. Finally, we show that loss of a key respiratory subunit implicated in Leigh disease markedly decreases mitochondrially derived ATP levels in axons, thus inhibiting synaptic vesicle cycling. This proves that mitochondria-based energy failure can occur and be detected in individual neurons that have a genetic mitochondrial defect.

This proves that mitochondria-based energy failure can occur and be detected in individual neurons that have a genetic mitochondrial defect. Mitochondria likely provide the main source of ATP that supports synaptic transmission, whereas anaerobic respiration from glycolysis contributes much less ATP (1Harris J.J. Jolivet R. Attwell D. Synaptic energy use and supply.Neuron. 2012; 75: 762-777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). Yet, surprisingly, less than half of all synaptic boutons in adult rodent hippocampus or in cultured hippocampal neurons contain mitochondria (2Shepherd G.M. Harris K.M.

This raises questions about where synaptic ATP originates, how it is distributed among boutons, and how much energy is needed to support synaptic transmission. Dysfunction of axonal mitochondria may also have a critical role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson disease and Alzheimers disease. Indeed, multiple neurodegenerative pathways are thought to converge on energy failure, and synaptic terminals degenerate early in many neurodegenerative diseases associated with impaired energy metabolism (4Scheff S.W. Price D.A. Schmitt F.A. DeKosky S.T. Mufson E.J.

Energy failure: does it contribute to neurodegeneration?.Ann. Neurol. 2013; 74: 506-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that significant changes in bioenergetic function may occur that are restricted to or occur first in the neuronal processes. In addition, axonal mitochondria have unique properties and exist in distinct microenvironments; thus, it is critical that we first understand the bioenergetics of intact axons. But surprisingly, energy failure has never been proved to occur in dysfunctional or dying disease-affected neurons or in the intact neurons used in genetic disease models (6Pathak D. Berthet A. Nakamura K. Energy failure: does it contribute to neurodegeneration?.Ann. Neurol. 2013; 74: 506-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Therefore, without knowing the normal energy requirements of neurons or how much energy depletion occurs in disease, we cannot know whether energy failure plays a causative role in degeneration. Our understanding of neuronal bioenergetics has been limited because the established assays have insufficient resolution (6Pathak D. Berthet A. Nakamura K. Energy failure: does it contribute to neurodegeneration?.Ann. Neurol. 2013; 74: 506-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Although respiration, glycolysis, and ATP can be measured in whole neuronal cultures, these approaches cannot accurately factor out ATP contributions from glia or provide subcellular spatial resolution. Synaptosome analyses continue to elucidate synaptic bioenergetic functions, but they are challenging in specific neuronal types (7Choi S.W. Gerencser A.A. Lee D.W. Rajagopalan S. Nicholls D.G. Andersen J.K. Brand M.D. Intrinsic bioenergetic properties and stress sensitivity of dopaminergic synaptosomes.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 4524-4534Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and are also subject to artifacts related to the isolation process. Mitochondrial membrane potential can be studied in intact neurons (8Verburg J. Hollenbeck P.J. Mitochondrial membrane potential in axons increases with local nerve growth factor or semaphorin signaling.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 8306-8315Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), but this is difficult in small axonal mitochondria and provides only indirect bioenergetic information. In addition, the mass and distribution of axonal mitochondria are just as important as their function (6Pathak D. Berthet A. Nakamura K. Energy failure: does it contribute to neurodegeneration?.Ann. Neurol. 2013; 74: 506-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To measure mitochondrially derived energy at the synapse, we designed sensitive ATP assays that suppress glycolysis so neurons must rely on mitochondria for energy. Using these assays, we identified the energy threshold needed to support synaptic vesicle cycling and showed that, when ATP drops below this threshold, endocytosis is blocked at or before the vesicle scission step. We showed that, to meet these energy needs, ATP rapidly disperses in axons, resulting in near normal ATP levels even in boutons lacking mitochondria. Finally, we showed that loss of a mitochondrial protein known to cause neurodegeneration (Leigh disease) also causes mitochondrially derived energy levels to drop enough in individual neurons to impair synaptic function, thus proving that mitochondrion-based energy failure can occur and be detected in individual neurons with genetic mitochondrial defects. All constructs were subcloned or cloned into the pCAGGS vector downstream of the chicken actin promoter (9Voglmaier S.M. Kam K. Yang H. Fortin D.L. Hua Z. Nicoll R.A. Edwards R.H.

For sparsely transfected neuronal cultures, 325 untransfected neurons/mm2 and 32 transfected neurons/mm2 were plated. Cells for imaging were transiently transfected by electroporation (Amaxa). Hippocampal neurons for Seahorse experiments were prepared from embryonic day (E)18 embryos (21Yao J. Chen S. Mao Z. Cadenas E. Brinton R.D. 2-Deoxy-d-glucose treatment induces ketogenesis, sustains mitochondrial function, and reduces pathology in female mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6e21788 Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), plated in serum-free medium at a density of 5 Ã— 104 cells per well in a 96-well polystyrene microplate, and cultured for 11 days before analysis. Rat glial cultures were prepared from P0 rats and plated 3 days earlier at 6 Ã— 104 cells per well on the same 96-well microplate (16Nemani V.M. Lu W. Berge V. Nakamura K. Onoa B. Lee M.K.

The extracellular acidification rate (ECAR, a surrogate for glycolysis) and oxygen consumption rate (OCR, to assess mitochondrial respiration) were measured using a Seahorse XF96 Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience). Cells were washed and preincubated for 30 min in Seahorse assay medium (pH 7.4) containing substrates of interest (30 mm glucose, 10 mm pyruvate, or both). OCR and ECAR were measured at baseline and again after sequential addition of respiratory inhibitors at final concentrations of 1 Î¼m carbonyl cyanide-4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone, a protonophore that uncouples oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria, 2 Î¼m rotenone (an inhibitor of mitochondrial complex I), or 4 Î¼m oligomycin (inhibitor of ATP synthase). After each run, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) to distinguish glia from neurons. To correct for the glial contribution, we estimated the glial content in each well by creating a ratiometric image of GFAP staining/MAP2 staining, which allowed us to clearly resolve glia from neurons (this was done because both antibodies had some nonspecific staining). In parallel, we used pure astrocyte cultures to estimate the contribution of an equivalent number of astrocytes. Neuronal respiration corrected for glial contamination was calculated based on the following formula: neuron OCR = neuronal culture OCR âˆ’ (glia OCR, the respiration of pure glia cultures)Â·(glial content neuronal culture/glial content of pure glial culture). Single synaptosome imaging was performed using reported methods (22Choi S.W. Gerencser A.A. Ng R. Flynn J.M. Melov S. Danielson S.R. Gibson B.W. Nicholls D.G. Bredesen D.E. Brand M.D. No consistent bioenergetic defects in presynaptic nerve terminals isolated from mouse models of Alzheimer's disease.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 16775-16784Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, cortical synaptosomes (1 Î¼g of protein/well) from adult FVB mice were attached to polyethyleneimine (1:15,000 w/v %) plus geltrex (1 v/v %)-coated cover glass-bottomed microplates (Whatman) by centrifugation and were incubated with 65 nm MitoTracker Green and 2.5 Î¼m fura-4F AM in pH 7.4 buffer containing 3.5 mm KCl, 120 mm NaCl, 0.4 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm Na2SO4, 15 mm d-glucose, 10 mm pyruvate, and 10 mm TES for 30 min at 37 Â°C. Buffer was then replaced with fresh buffer containing 1.3 mm CaCl2, 0.4% (w/v) fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, and 5 nm tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM), and wide-field images were acquired with a Nikon Eclipse Ti-PFS inverted epifluorescence microscope and an S-Fluor 40 Ã— 1.4 NA oil lens with the filters (excitation, dichroic mirror, and emission in nm/bandwidth) for TMRM (543/22, 562, 617/73; 150-ms exposure time), MitoTracker Green (472/30, 505, 520/35; 150 ms) and fura-4F (340/26 (250 ms) and 387/11 (125 ms), 409, 510/84). Four time points were acquired at 5-min intervals, and the buffer was replaced with fresh buffer containing the desired substrate composition after the second time point. Fields of âˆ¼30,000 synaptosomes were imaged using 4 Ã— 4 tiling in each time point. Because fura-4F became essentially saturated in synaptosomes with dysregulated Ca2+ homeostasis, the fraction of individual synaptosomes with a higher fura-4F excitation ratio than a fixed threshold (ratio of 2, equivalent to âˆ¼6 Î¼m) was determined. This was performed using automated image segmentation in Image Analyst MKII (Image Analyst Software, Novato, CA). HeLa cells and neurons were permeabilized by incubation with XF-PMP reagent (1 nm for HeLa, 1.25 nm for neurons; Seahorse Bioscience) for 4 min in a cytosolic buffer (140 mm KCl, 6 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.465 mm CaCl2, 2 mm EGTA, and 12.5 mm HEPES, all at pH 7.0) (23Tanaka T. Nagashima K. Inagaki N. Kioka H. Takashima S. Fukuoka H. Noji H. Kakizuka A. Imamura H. Glucose-stimulated single pancreatic islets sustain increased cytosolic ATP levels during initial Ca2+ influx and subsequent Ca2+ oscillations.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 2205-2216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) at room temperature and then washed and incubated for an additional 26 min. Buffer was then replaced with fresh buffer containing increasing concentrations of ATP, and the FRET was measured. Neurons were cultured for 11 days (rat neurons) or 8â€“9 days (mouse neurons) and then imaged live in Tyrode's medium (pH 7.4; in mm: 127 NaCl, 10 HEPES-NaOH, 2.5 KCl, 2 MgCl2, and 2 CaCl2, with either 30 mm glucose and/or 10 mm pyruvate, unless otherwise specified) using a Nikon CFI Plan Apo Ã—40/0.95 air objective on a Nikon Ti-E inverted microscope with an iXon EMCCD camera (Andor Technology), and a perfusion valve control system (VC-8, Warner Instruments), controlled by Metamorph software (Molecular Devices). All buffer changes and drug additions were made by perfusion except for MES (Fig. 6C), which was directly injected into the imaging chamber to achieve immediate mixing. Field stimulations were done using an A385 current isolator and a SYS-A310 Accu pulser signal generator (World Precision Instruments). VGLUT1-pHluorin fluorescence images were obtained (490/20 excitation, 535/50 emission, Chroma), and regions of interest were drawn over synaptic boutons using Metamorph software. Synaptic boutons were identified based on co-localization with mCherry-synaptophysin and an increase in pHluorin fluorescence after we applied ammonium chloride (50 mm). For each bouton, the background-subtracted change in fluorescence at each time point was normalized to the fluorescence in ammonium chloride (which estimates the total synaptic vesicle pool size) (16Nemani V.M. Lu W. Berge V. Nakamura K. Onoa B. Lee M.K. Chaudhry F.A. Nicoll R.A. Edwards R.H. Increased expression of Î±-synuclein reduces neurotransmitter release by inhibiting synaptic vesicle reclustering after endocytosis.Neuron. 2010; 65: 66-79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar), measured at the end of each run. The baseline fluorescence intensity was set to zero either 5 or 20 s before the first stimulation and then again before the second stimulation after any change in substrate or drug addition. For FRET experiments, sequential images were taken in the CFP (430/24 excitation, 470/24 emission), YFP (500/20 excitation, 535/30 emission), and FRET channels (430/24 excitation, 535/30 emission) using an ET enhanced CFP/enhanced YFP filter set (Chroma). Synaptic boutons were again identified based on co-localization with mCherry-synaptophysin or for experiments with mito-FarRED by morphology. Synaptic boutons were classified as containing or lacking stationary mitochondria (identified based on co-expression of either mito-mTagBFP or mito-FarRed) based on the respective presence or absence of a mitochondrion within the bouton in images taken immediately before and after the imaging run. Those boutons that contained mitochondria only at the beginning or end of the imaging period were excluded from analysis. The FRET/donor ratio was calculated for each bouton as described (24Xia Z. Liu Y. Reliable and global measurement of fluorescence resonance energy transfer using fluorescence microscopes.Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 2395-2402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), where FRET = (IFRET âˆ’ ICFPÂ·BTCFP âˆ’ IYFPÂ·BTYFP)/ICFP, where IX is the background-corrected fluorescence intensity measured in a given channel. BTCFP (donor bleed through) and BTYFP (direct excitation of the acceptor) were calculated by expressing CFP and YFP individually and then determining the ratios of IFRET/ICFP and IFRET/IYFP, respectively. Cells were fixed for 15 min in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 4% paraformaldehyde and immunostained in PBS containing 5% fetal bovine serum and 0.2% Triton X-100. Total neurons were detected using an antibody to MAP2 (Millipore, catalogue no. MAB3418), astrocytes with GFAP (rabbit clone, Sigma, catalogue no. G9269), mitochondria with Tom20 (rabbit, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalogue no. SC-11415), and mCherry with DsRED (rabbit, Clontech, catalogue no. 632496). Physiologic brain glucose levels (â‰ˆ1â€“1.5 mm (25McNay E.C. Fries T.M. Gold P.E. Decreases in rat extracellular hippocampal glucose concentration associated with cognitive demand during a spatial task.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 2881-2885Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 26Rex A. Bert B. Fink H. Voigt J.P. Stimulus-dependent changes of extracellular glucose in the rat hippocampus determined by in vivo microdialysis.Physiol. Behav. 2009; 98: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar)) are far lower than those typically used to culture neurons and perform mitochondrial function assays (â‰ˆ25â€“30 mm). Under these high glucose conditions, glycolysis likely compensates for any respiratory deficits and obscures our ability to detect whether and how any respiratory deficits affect neuronal function/survival. Therefore, to develop sensitive assays to measure mitochondrially derived ATP in neurons, we first delineated how the relative ATP contributions of aerobic and anaerobic respiration are influenced by substrate availability. Using a Seahorse instrument, we measured the rates of respiration and glycolysis in E18 hippocampal cultures grown for 11 days. In 30 mm glucose (a supra-physiological concentration often used in cell culture and imaging buffers) basal and maximal OCRs were low, indicating little aerobic respiration (Fig. 1). But when pyruvate (10 mm) was substituted for glucose for 30 min, respiration increased, as did the ratio of OCR to ECAR (Fig. 1D), indicating a greater reliance on aerobic respiration. Importantly, these data reflect bioenergetic changes in neurons specifically, as we both minimized glial content (using embryonic cultures grown in serum-free medium) and used parallel glia-only cultures to correct for the ATP contribution of the remaining glia. As such, our normalized glial OCR calculations show that glia only minimally contribute to the total OCR regardless of substrate (Fig. 1). Therefore, neurons derive more energy from mitochondrial respiration when exposed to pyruvate, but they rely more on glycolysis when exposed only to high glucose levels. So, we hypothesized that to detect the consequences of lower mitochondrial ATP levels, we should use substrates that promote aerobic respiration and minimize glycolysis. To test this at the synapse, which is the first area to degenerate in several neurodegenerative diseases involving mitochondria (4Scheff S.W. Price D.A. Schmitt F.A. DeKosky S.T. Mufson E.J.

Clinical progression in Parkinson disease and the neurobiology of axons.Ann. Neurol. 2010; 67: 715-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar), we first examined how the substrate affects the ATP-dependent capacity of synaptosomes to maintain low calcium levels (7Choi S.W. Gerencser A.A. Lee D.W. Rajagopalan S. Nicholls D.G. Andersen J.K. Brand M.D. Intrinsic bioenergetic properties and stress sensitivity of dopaminergic synaptosomes.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 4524-4534Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We used fluorescence microscopy of the low affinity Ca2+ probe fura-4F AM to measure the loss of Ca2+ homeostasis in single synaptosomes. Most synaptosomes maintained low resting calcium levels (below the sensitive range of fura-4F; <100 nm [Ca2+]) even without substrates in the medium, suggesting that endogenous substrates suffice (Fig. 1E). Glycolysis alone also maintained calcium homeostasis, but inhibiting all glycolysis (by iodoacetate; 250 Î¼m), oxidative phosphorylation (oligomycin; 1 Î¼g/ml), and creatine kinase (iodoacetamide; 250 Î¼m) disrupted synaptosome calcium regulation, manifesting in a precipitous increase in [Ca2+] (>6 Î¼m). This suggests that ATP fell below the threshold required to maintain normal low calcium levels. So, because calcium regulation can be supported by either glycolysis or respiration, we must suppress glycolysis to determine how impaired mitochondrial ATP production affects calcium levels. Synaptic vesicle release may be impaired early in diseases that deplete energy (27Yasuda T. Nakata Y. Choong C.J. Mochizuki H. Neurodegenerative changes initiated by presynaptic dysfunction.Transl. Neurodegener. 2013; 2: 16Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), but the ATP requirements of the synaptic vesicle cycle are poorly understood. To investigate how much mitochondrially derived ATP is needed for different phases of the synaptic vesicle cycle, we assessed synaptic vesicle release when neurons were exposed to different substrates. For this and all subsequent live imaging experiments, we studied postnatal hippocampal neurons grown in serum-containing media (16Nemani V.M. Lu W. Berge V. Nakamura K. Onoa B. Lee M.K. Chaudhry F.A.

These cultures also include glia, and thus better incorporate glia-neuron interactions that likely influence energy metabolism in neurons (28Pellerin L. Magistretti P.J. Sweet sixteen for ANLS.J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2012; 32: 1152-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). To monitor the synaptic vesicle cycle in individual boutons, we used the VGLUT1-pHluorin reporter, which targets a pH-sensitive GFP (pHluorin) to the lumen of synaptic vesicles. pHluorin does not fluoresce in an acidified vesicle, but it does fluoresce when a vesicle fuses and its contents are exposed to the alkaline extracellular environment (9Voglmaier S.M.

https://openalex.org/W1867056713,"Although many different accounts of the functions of the default mode network (DMN) have been proposed, few can adequately account for the spectrum of different cognitive functions that utilize this network. The current study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore the hypothesis that the role of the DMN in higher order cognition is to allow cognition to be shaped by information from stored representations rather than information in the immediate environment. Using a novel task paradigm, we observed increased BOLD activity in regions of the medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex when individuals made decisions on the location of shapes from the prior trial and decreased BOLD activity when individuals made decisions on the location of shapes on the current trial. These data are inconsistent with views of the DMN as a task-negative system or one that is sensitive only to stimuli with strong personal or emotional ties. Instead the involvement of the DMN when people make decisions about where a shape was, rather than where it is now, supports the hypothesis that the core hubs of the DMN allow cognition to be guided by information other than the immediate perceptual input. We propose that a variety of different forms of higher order thought (such as imagining the future or considering the perspective of another person) engage the DMN because these more complex introspective forms of higher order thought all depend on the capacity for cognition to be shaped by representations that are not present in the external environment."
https://openalex.org/W831568968,"Background High-throughput sequencing (HTS) analysis of microbial communities from the respiratory airways has heavily relied on the 16S rRNA gene. Given the intrinsic limitations of this approach, airway microbiome research has focused on assessing bacterial composition during health and disease, and its variation in relation to clinical and environmental factors, or other microbiomes. Consequently, very little effort has been dedicated to describing the functional characteristics of the airway microbiota and even less to explore the microbe-host interactions. Here we present a simultaneous assessment of microbiome and host functional diversity and host-microbe interactions from the same RNA-seq experiment, while accounting for variation in clinical metadata. Methods Transcriptomic (host) and metatranscriptomic (microbiota) sequences from the nasal epithelium of 8 asthmatics and 6 healthy controls were separated in silico and mapped to available human and NCBI-NR protein reference databases. Human genes differentially expressed in asthmatics and controls were then used to infer upstream regulators involved in immune and inflammatory responses. Concomitantly, microbial genes were mapped to metabolic databases (COG, SEED, and KEGG) to infer microbial functions differentially expressed in asthmatics and controls. Finally, multivariate analysis was applied to find associations between microbiome characteristics and host upstream regulators while accounting for clinical variation. Results and Discussion Our study showed significant differences in the metabolism of microbiomes from asthmatic and non-asthmatic children for up to 25% of the functional properties tested. Enrichment analysis of 499 differentially expressed host genes for inflammatory and immune responses revealed 43 upstream regulators differentially activated in asthma. Microbial adhesion (virulence) and Proteobacteria abundance were significantly associated with variation in the expression of the upstream regulator IL1A; suggesting that microbiome characteristics modulate host inflammatory and immune systems during asthma."
https://openalex.org/W789314768,"Both Moyamoya disease (MMD) and intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS) are more prevalent in Asians than in Westerners. We hypothesized that a substantial proportion of patients with adult-onset MMD were misclassified as having ICAS, which may in part explain the high prevalence of intracranial atherosclerotic stroke in Asians.We analyzed 352 consecutive patients with ischemic events within the MCA distribution and relevant intracranial arterial stenosis, but no demonstrable carotid or cardiac embolism sources. Conventional angiography was performed in 249 (70.7%) patients, and the remains underwent MRA. The occurrence of the c.14429G>A (p.Arg4810Lys) variant in ring finger protein 213 (RNF213) was analyzed. This gene was recently identified as a susceptibility gene for MMD in East Asians.The p.Arg4810Lys variant was observed in half of patients with intracranial stenosis (176 of 352, 50.0%), in no healthy control subjects (n = 51), and in 3.2% of stroke control subjects (4 of 124 patients with other etiologies). The presence of basal collaterals, bilateral involvement on angiography, and absence of diabetes were independently associated with the presence of the RNF213 variant. Among 131 patients who met all three diagnostic criteria and were diagnosed with MMD, three-fourths (75.6%) had this variant. However, a significant proportion of patients who met two criteria (57.7%), one criterion (28.6%), or no criteria (20.0%) also had this variant. Some of them developed typical angiographic findings of MMD on follow-up angiography.Careful consideration of MMD is needed when diagnosing ICAS because differential therapeutic strategies are required for these diseases and due to the limitations of the current diagnostic criteria for MMD."
https://openalex.org/W1655016743,"Lithic technologies have been used to trace dispersals of early human populations within and beyond Africa. Convergence in lithic systems has the potential to confound such interpretations, implying connections between unrelated groups. Due to their reductive nature, stone artefacts are unusually prone to this chance appearance of similar forms in unrelated populations. Here we present data from the South African Middle Stone Age sites Uitpanskraal 7 and Mertenhof suggesting that Nubian core reduction systems associated with Late Pleistocene populations in North Africa and potentially with early human migrations out of Africa in MIS 5 also occur in southern Africa during early MIS 3 and with no clear connection to the North African occurrence. The timing and spatial distribution of their appearance in southern and northern Africa implies technological convergence, rather than diffusion or dispersal. While lithic technologies can be a critical guide to human population flux, their utility in tracing early human dispersals at large spatial and temporal scales with stone artefact types remains questionable."

This study investigated the distribution and anti-biofilm effect of cationic (+) and anionic (-) phospholipid liposomes with different sizes (unilamellar and multilamellar vesicle, ULV and MLV respectively) on S. aureus and P. aeruginosa biofilms.Specific biofilm models for S. aureus ATCC 25923 and P. aeruginosa ATCC 15692 were established. Liposomal distribution was determined by observing SYTO9 stained biofilm exposed to DiI labeled liposomes using confocal scanning laser microscopy, followed by quantitative image analysis. The anti-biofilm efficacy study was carried out by using the alamarBlue assay to test the relative viability of biofilm treated with various liposomes for 24 hours and five minutes.The smaller ULVs penetrated better than larger MLVs in both S. aureus and P. aeruginosa biofilm. Except that +ULV and -ULV displayed similar distribution in S. aureus biofilm, the cationic liposomes adhered better than their anionic counterparts. Biofilm growth was inhibited at 24-hour and five-minute exposure time, although the decrease of viability for P. aeruginosa biofilm after liposomal treatment did not reach statistical significance.The distribution and anti-biofilm effects of cationic and anionic liposomes of different sizes differed in S. aureus and P. aeruginosa biofilms. Reducing the liposome size and formulating liposomes as positively charged enhanced the penetration and inhibition of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa biofilms."
https://openalex.org/W1583808810,"Background Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is associated with a risk of coronary artery disease (e.g., diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, metabolic syndrome). We evaluated whether nonalcoholic hepatic steatosis is associated with high-risk plaques as assessed by multidetector computed tomography (CT). Methods This retrospective study involved 414 participants suspected of having coronary artery disease. Nonalcoholic hepatic steatosis was defined as a liver-to-spleen fat ratio of <1.0 and the presence and appropriate characteristics of coronary-artery plaques as assessed by coronary CT angiography. High-risk plaques were identified, as were low-density plaques, positive remodeling, and spotty calcification. Results Compared with patients who did not have nonalcoholic hepatic steatosis, patients with nonalcoholic hepatic steatosis had more low-density plaques (21% vs. 44%, p<0.01), positive remodeling (41% vs. 58%, p = 0.01), and spotty calcification (12% vs. 36%, p<0.01). The number of high-risk plaques in patients with nonalcoholic hepatic steatosis was greater than in those without nonalcoholic hepatic steatosis (p<0.01). Patients with nonalcoholic hepatic steatosis were more likely to have high-risk plaques than were those with only an elevated level of visceral adipose tissue (â‰¥86 cm2; 35% vs. 16%, p<0.01). Multivariate analyses that included nonalcoholic hepatic steatosis, amount of visceral adipose tissue, and the presence/absence of traditional risk factors demonstrated that nonalcoholic hepatic steatosis was an independent predictor of high-risk plaques (odds ratio: 4.60; 95% confidence interval: 1.94â€“9.07, p<0.01). Conclusions Diagnosis of nonalcoholic hepatic steatosis may be of value when assessing the risk of coronary artery disease."
https://openalex.org/W1916693260,"Today, the workflows that are involved in industrial assembly and production activities are becoming increasingly complex. To efficiently and safely perform these workflows is demanding on the workers, in particular when it comes to infrequent or repetitive tasks. This burden on the workers can be eased by introducing smart assistance systems. This article presents a scalable concept and an integrated system demonstrator designed for this purpose. The basic idea is to learn workflows from observing multiple expert operators and then transfer the learnt workflow models to novice users. Being entirely learning-based, the proposed system can be applied to various tasks and domains. The above idea has been realized in a prototype, which combines components pushing the state of the art of hardware and software designed with interoperability in mind. The emphasis of this article is on the algorithms developed for the prototype: 1) fusion of inertial and visual sensor information from an on-body sensor network (BSN) to robustly track the userâ€™s pose in magnetically polluted environments; 2) learning-based computer vision algorithms to map the workspace, localize the sensor with respect to the workspace and capture objects, even as they are carried; 3) domain-independent and robust workflow recovery and monitoring algorithms based on spatiotemporal pairwise relations deduced from object and user movement with respect to the scene; and 4) context-sensitive augmented reality (AR) user feedback using a head-mounted display (HMD). A distinguishing key feature of the developed algorithms is that they all operate solely on data from the on-body sensor network and that no external instrumentation is needed. The feasibility of the chosen approach for the complete action-perception-feedback loop is demonstrated on three increasingly complex datasets representing manual industrial tasks. These limited size datasets indicate and highlight the potential of the chosen technology as a combined entity as well as point out limitations of the system."

The present report is focused on gonococcus evasion mechanism on macrophages (MÐ¤) and its impact in the subsequent immune response. In response to various signals MÐ¤ may undergo classical-M1 (M1-MÐ¤) or alternative-M2 (M2-MÐ¤) activation. Until now there are no reports of the gonococcus effects on human MÐ¤ polarization. We assessed the phagocytic ability of monocyte-derived MÐ¤ (MDM) upon gonococcal infection by immunofluorescence and gentamicin protection experiments. Then, we evaluated cytokine profile and M1/M2 specific-surface markers on MÐ¤ challenged with N. gonorrhoeae and their proliferative effect on T cells. Our findings lead us to suggest N. gonorrhoeae stimulates a M2-MÐ¤ phenotype in which some of the M2b and none of the M1-MÐ¤-associated markers are induced. Interestingly, N. gonorrhoeae exposure leads to upregulation of a Programmed Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1), widely known as an immunosuppressive molecule. Moreover, functional results showed that N. gonorrhoeae-treated MÐ¤ are unable to induce proliferation of human T-cells, suggesting a more likely regulatory phenotype. Taken together, our data show that N. gonorroheae interferes with MÐ¤ polarization. This study has important implications for understanding the mechanisms of clearance versus long-term persistence of N. gonorroheae infection and might be applicable for the development of new therapeutic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W839498338,"Background Delayed graft function (DGF) is an early complication of kidney transplantation (KT) associated with increased risk of early loss of graft function. DGF increases using kidneys from extended criteria donors (ECD). NGAL is a 25KDa protein proposed as biomarker of acute kidney injury. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of NGAL as an early and accurate indicator of DGF and Tacrolimus (Tac) toxicity and as a mediator of tissue regeneration in KT from ECD. Methods We evaluated plasma levels of NGAL in 50 KT patients from ECD in the first 4 days after surgery or after Tac introduction. Results Plasma levels of NGAL at day 1 were significantly higher in DGF group. In the non DGF group, NGAL discriminated between slow or immediate graft function and decreased more rapidly than serum creatinine. NGAL increased after Tac introduction, suggesting a role as marker of drug toxicity. In vitro, hypoxia and Tac induced NGAL release from tubular epithelial cells (TEC) favoring an autocrine loop that sustains proliferation and inhibits apoptosis (decrease of caspases and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio). Conclusions NGAL is an early and accurate biomarker of graft function in KT from ECD favoring TEC regeneration after ischemic and nephrotoxic injury."
https://openalex.org/W2162669562,"Dietary energy source can influence muscle glycogen storage at slaughter. However, few studies have demonstrated whether the diet-induced change of muscle glycogen is achieved by the transformation of muscle fibre type. This study investigated the effects of dietary energy sources on meat quality, post mortem glycolysis and muscle fibre type transformation of finishing pigs. Seventy-two barrows with an average body weight of 65.0 Â± 2.0 kg were selected and were allotted to three iso-energetic and iso-nitrogenous diets A, B or C, and each treatment consisted of three replicates (pens) of eight pigs each. Diet A contained 44.1% starch, 5.9% crude fat and 12.6% neutral detergent fiber (NDF); diet B contained 37.6% starch, 9.5% crude fat and 15.4% NDF; and diet C contained 30.9% starch, 14.3% crude fat and 17.8% NDF. The duration of the experiment was 28 days. After feed withdrawal 12 h, 24 pigs (eight per treatment) were slaughtered, samples from M. longissimus lumborum (LL) were collected for subsequent analysis. The results showed that pigs fed diet C had lesser average daily gain, average daily feed intake and back fat depth than those fed diet A (P<0.05). Diet C increased pH45min (P<0.05) and decreased drip loss (P<0.05) in LL muscles compared with diet A. Meat from pigs fed diet A showed increased contents of lactate and greater glycolytic potential (GP) compared with those fed diet C (P<0.05). Greater mRNA expression of myosin heavy-chain (MyHC)-I and IIa and lesser expression of MyHC-IIx and IIb (P<0.05) in LL muscles were found in pigs fed diet C, than in pigs fed diet A. In addition, pigs fed diet C resulted in downregulation of miR23a and upregulation of miR409 and miR208b (P<0.05), associated with conserved changes of their corresponding targets. These findings indicated that diets containing low starch and high fibre were beneficial in reducing muscle glycolysis, improving meat quality of finishing pigs. This reduction of GP may be partially associated with the improvement of oxidative fibre composition in LL muscle, and the change in myofibre type may be correlated with the change in the miRNA expression."
https://openalex.org/W744368639,"Metal contamination represents one of the major sources of pollution in marine environments. In this study we investigated the short-term effects of ecologically relevant cadmium and manganese concentrations (10(-6) and 3.6 x 10(-5) M, respectively) on females of the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus and their progeny, reared in the absence or presence of the metal. Cadmium is a well-known heavy metal, whereas manganese represents a potential emerging contaminant, resulting from an increased production of manganese-containing compounds. The effects of these agents were examined on both P. lividus adults and their offspring following reproductive state, morphology of embryos, nitric oxide (NO) production and differential gene expression. Here, we demonstrated that both metals differentially impaired the fertilization processes of the treated female sea urchins, causing modifications in the reproductive state and also affecting NO production in the ovaries. A detailed analysis of the progeny showed a high percentage of abnormal embryos, associated to an increase in the endogenous NO levels and variations in the transcriptional expression of several genes involved in stress response, skeletogenesis, detoxification, multi drug efflux processes and NO production. Moreover, we found significant differences in the progeny from females exposed to metals and reared in metal-containing sea water compared to embryos reared in non-contaminated sea water. Overall, these results greatly expanded previous studies on the toxic effects of metals on P. lividus and provided new insights into the molecular events induced in the progeny of sea urchins exposed to metals."

We examined the association of community collective efficacy with depressive symptom severity in Florida public health workers (n = 2249) exposed to the 2004 hurricane season using a multilevel approach. Cross-sectional anonymous questionnaires were distributed electronically to all Florida Department of Health (FDOH) personnel that assessed depressive symptom severity and collective efficacy nine months after the 2004 hurricane season. Analyses were conducted at the individual level and community level using zip codes. The majority of participants were female (81.9%), and ages ranged from 20 to 78 years (median = 49 years). The majority of participants (73.4%) were European American, 12.7% were African American, and 9.2% were Hispanic. Using multilevel analysis, our data indicate that higher community-level and individual-level collective efficacy were associated with significantly lower depressive symptom severity (b = -0.09 [95% CI: -0.13, -0.04] and b = -0.09 [95% CI: -0.12, -0.06], respectively) even after adjusting for individual sociodemographic variables, community socioeconomic characteristics, individual injury/damage, and community storm damage.

Limited data are available on the prevalence of disability or factors resulting in disability among the elderly in China. Objective We aimed to assess the prevalence of disability and related risk factors among the elderly of Xiamen, China. Methods A cross-sectional study was performed on individuals who were â‰¥60 years of age. The subjects were recruited by multi-stage sampling; a total of 14,292 valid questionnaires were received. Study measurements included activities of daily living (ADL), demographics, and health status. The ADL was assessed by the Katz Index Scale to evaluate disability. Chi-square tests and binary logistic regression were used to identify factors associated with disabilities. Results Among the valid participants, 4.27% had at least one disability. Bathing was the most frequently reported disability and feeding was the least frequently reported disability. Disabilities were significantly associated with female gender, older age, unmarried status, living with family, urban residence, illiteracy, poor economic status, self-rated bad health, chronic illnesses, lower life satisfaction, bad mood, and feelings of loneliness. Conclusion Functional disability among the elderly requires more public attention. Culturally appropriate policies and programs are also needed to address the care for the disabled elderly."

DBT was incorporated into porous composites (GGT) made from genipin-crosslinked gelatin and Î²-triclacium phosphates as bone substitutes (GGTDBT). The biological response of mouse calvarial bone to these composites was evaluated by in vivo imaging systems (IVIS), micro-computed tomography (micro-CT), and histology analysis. IVIS images revealed a stronger fluorescent signal in GGTDBT-treated defect than in GGT-treated defect at 8 weeks after implantation. Micro-CT analysis demonstrated that the level of repair from week 4 to 8 increased from 42.1% to 71.2% at the sites treated with GGTDBT, while that increased from 33.2% to 54.1% at GGT-treated sites.

https://openalex.org/W2096267364,"Galectins have emerged as potent immunoregulatory agents that control chronic inflammation through distinct mechanisms. Here, we report that treatment with Galectin-8 (Gal-8), a tandem-repeat member of the galectin family, reduces retinal pathology and prevents photoreceptor cell damage in a murine model of experimental autoimmune uveitis. Gal-8 treatment increased the number of regulatory T cells (Treg) in both the draining lymph node (dLN) and the inflamed retina. Moreover, a greater percentage of Treg cells in the dLN and retina of Gal-8 treated animals expressed the inhibitory coreceptor cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen (CTLA)-4, the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10, and the tissue-homing integrin CD103. Treg cells in the retina of Gal-8-treated mice were primarily inducible Treg cells that lack the expression of neuropilin-1. In addition, Gal-8 treatment blunted production of inflammatory cytokines by retinal T helper type (TH) 1 and TH17 cells. The effect of Gal-8 on T cell differentiation and/or function was specific for tissues undergoing an active immune response, as Gal-8 treatment had no effect on T cell populations in the spleen. Given the need for rational therapies for managing human uveitis, Gal-8 emerges as an attractive therapeutic candidate not only for treating retinal autoimmune diseases, but also for other TH1- and TH17-mediated inflammatory disorders."
https://openalex.org/W843442938,"The evolution of diversity across the animal kingdom has been accompanied by tremendous gene loss and gain. While comparative genomics has been fruitful to characterize differences in gene content across highly diverged species, little is known about the microevolution of structural variations that cause these differences in the first place. In order to investigate the genomic impact of structural variations, we made use of genomic and transcriptomic data from the nematode Pristionchus pacificus, which has been established as a satellite model to Caenorhabditis elegans for comparative biology. We exploit the fact that P. pacificus is a highly diverse species for which various genomic data including the draft genome of a sister species P. exspectatus is available. Based on resequencing coverage data for two natural isolates we identified large (> 2 kb) deletions and duplications relative to the reference strain. By restriction to completely syntenic regions between P. pacificus and P. exspectatus, we were able to polarize the comparison and to assess the impact of structural variations on expression levels. We found that while loss of genes correlates with lack of expression, duplication of genes has virtually no effect on gene expression. Further investigating expression of individual copies at sites that segregate between the duplicates, we found in the majority of cases only one of the copies to be expressed. Nevertheless, we still find that certain gene classes are strongly depleted in deletions as well as duplications, suggesting evolutionary constraint acting on synteny. In summary, our results are consistent with a model, where most structural variations are either deleterious or neutral and provide first insights into the microevolution of structural variations in the P. pacificus genome."

We identified lysosomal-associated transmembrane protein 4B (LAPTM4B), which interacts with GARP in mammalian cells and is expressed at higher levels in Tregs than in Th cells. LAPTM4B decreases cleavage of proTGF-Î²1, secretion of soluble latent TGF-Î²1, and surface presentation of GARPÂ·TGF-Î²1 complexes by Tregs but does not contribute to TGF-Î²1 activation.

The vast majority of the animals do not produce oxygen but a few exceptions have shown that photosynthetic capacity is physiologically compatible with animal life. Such symbiotic photosynthetic relationships are restricted to a few aquatic invertebrates. In this work we aimed to explore if we could create a chimerical organism by incorporating photosynthetic eukaryotic cells into a vertebrate animal model. Here, the microalgae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was injected into zebrafish eggs and the interaction and viability of both organisms were studied. Results show that microalgae were distributed into different tissues, forming a fish-alga chimera organism for a prolonged period of time. In addition, microscopic observation of injected algae, in vivo expression of their mRNA and re-growth of the algae ex vivo suggests that they survived to the developmental process, living for several days after injection. Moreover microalgae did not trigger a significant inflammatory response in the fish. This work provides additional evidence to support the possibility that photosynthetic vertebrates can be engineered."
https://openalex.org/W2153753731,"It has been hypothesized that environmental exposures at key development periods such as in utero play a role in childhood growth and obesity. To investigate whether in utero exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and its metabolite, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (DDE), is associated with childhood physical growth, we took a novel statistical approach to analyze data from the CHAMACOS cohort study. To model heterogeneity in the growth patterns, we used a finite mixture model in combination with a data transformation to characterize body mass index (BMI) with four groups and estimated the association between exposure and group membership. In boys, higher maternal concentrations of DDT and DDE during pregnancy are associated with a BMI growth pattern that is stable until about age five followed by increased growth through age nine. In contrast, higher maternal DDT exposure during pregnancy is associated with a flat, relatively stable growth pattern in girls. This study suggests that in utero exposure to DDT and DDE may be associated with childhood BMI growth patterns, not just BMI level, and both the magnitude of exposure and sex may impact the relationship."
https://openalex.org/W808903011,"Signalling through the Hippo (Hpo) pathway involves a kinase cascade, which leads to the phosphorylation and inactivation of the pro-growth transcriptional co-activator Yorkie (Yki). Despite the identification of a large number of pathway members and modulators, our understanding of the molecular events that lead to activation of Hpo and the downstream kinase Warts (Wts) remain incomplete. Recently, targeted degradation of several Hpo pathway components has been demonstrated as a means of regulating pathway activity. In particular, the stability of scaffold protein Salvador (Sav), which is believed to promote Hpo/Wts association, is crucially dependent on its binding partner Hpo. In a cell-based RNAi screen for ubiquitin regulators involved in Sav stability, we identify the HECT domain protein Herc4 (HECT and RLD domain containing E3 ligase) as a Sav E3 ligase. Herc4 expression promotes Sav ubiquitylation and degradation, while Herc4 depletion stabilises Sav. Interestingly, Hpo reduces Sav/Herc4 interaction in a kinase-dependent manner. This suggests the existence of a positive feedback loop, where Hpo stabilises its own positive regulator by antagonising Herc4-mediated degradation of Sav."

Here we show that APP binds the PIKfyve complex, an essential kinase for the synthesis of the endosomal phosphoinositide phosphatidylinositol-3,5-bisphosphate. This signalling lipid plays a crucial role in endosomal homeostasis and receptor sorting. Loss of PIKfyve function by mutation causes profound neurodegeneration in mammals. Using C. elegans genetics we demonstrate that APP functionally cooperates with PIKfyve in vivo. This regulation is required for maintaining endosomal and neuronal function. Our findings establish an unexpected role for APP in the regulation of endosomal phosphoinositide metabolism with dramatic consequences for endosomal biology and important implications for our understanding of Alzheimer's disease."
https://openalex.org/W782031982,"Staphylococcus aureus is an important human pathogen that causes infections that may present high morbidity and mortality. Among its many virulence factors protein A (SpA) and Staphylococcal binding immunoglobulin protein (Sbi) bind the Fc portion of IgG interfering with opsonophagocytosis. We have previously demonstrated that SpA interacts with the TNF-Î± receptor (TNFR) 1 through each of the five IgG binding domains and induces the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The IgG binding domains of Sbi are homologous to those of SpA, which allow us to hypothesize that Sbi might also have a role in the inflammatory response induced by S. aureus. We demonstrate that Sbi is a novel factor that participates in the induction of the inflammatory response during staphylococcal infections via TNFR1 and EGFR mediated signaling as well as downstream MAPKs. The expression of Sbi significantly contributed to IL-6 production and modulated CXCL-1 expression as well as neutrophil recruitment to the site of infection, thus demonstrating for the first time its relevance as a pro-inflammatory staphylococcal antigen in an in vivo model."
https://openalex.org/W797721171,"We analysed the peer review of grant proposals under Marie Curie Actions, a major EU research funding instrument, which involves two steps: an independent assessment (Individual Evaluation Report, IER) performed remotely by 3 raters, and a consensus opinion reached during a meeting by the same raters (Consensus Report, CR). For 24,897 proposals evaluated from 2007 to 2013, the association between average IER and CR scores was very high across different panels, grant calls and years. Median average deviation (AD) index, used as a measure of inter-rater agreement, was 5.4 points on a 0-100 scale (interquartile range 3.4-8.3), overall, demonstrating a good general agreement among raters. For proposals where one rater disagreed with the other two raters (n=1424; 5.7%), or where all 3 raters disagreed (n=2075; 8.3%), the average IER and CR scores were still highly associated. Disagreement was more frequent for proposals from Economics/Social Sciences and Humanities panels. Greater disagreement was observed for proposals with lower average IER scores. CR scores for proposals with initial disagreement were also significantly lower. Proposals with a large absolute difference between the average IER and CR scores (â‰¥10 points; n=368, 1.5%) generally had lower CR scores. An inter-correlation matrix of individual raters' scores of evaluation criteria of proposals indicated that these scores were, in general, a reflection of ratersâ€™ overall scores. Our analysis demonstrated a good internal consistency and general high agreement among raters. Consensus meetings appear to be relevant for particular panels and subsets of proposals with large differences among ratersâ€™ scores."
https://openalex.org/W2215128562,"In ecology, as in other research fields, efficient sampling for population estimation often drives sample designs toward unequal probability sampling, such as in stratified sampling. Design based statistical analysis tools are appropriate for seamless integration of sample design into the statistical analysis. However, it is also common and necessary, after a sampling design has been implemented, to use datasets to address questions that, in many cases, were not considered during the sampling design phase. Questions may arise requiring the use of model based statistical tools such as multiple regression, quantile regression, or regression tree analysis. However, such model based tools may require, for ensuring unbiased estimation, data from simple random samples, which can be problematic when analyzing data from unequal probability designs. Despite numerous method specific tools available to properly account for sampling design, too often in the analysis of ecological data, sample design is ignored and consequences are not properly considered. We demonstrate here that violation of this assumption can lead to biased parameter estimates in ecological research. In addition, to the set of tools available for researchers to properly account for sampling design in model based analysis, we introduce inverse probability bootstrapping (IPB). Inverse probability bootstrapping is an easily implemented method for obtaining equal probability re-samples from a probability sample, from which unbiased model based estimates can be made. We demonstrate the potential for bias in model-based analyses that ignore sample inclusion probabilities, and the effectiveness of IPB sampling in eliminating this bias, using both simulated and actual ecological data. For illustration, we considered three model based analysis tools--linear regression, quantile regression, and boosted regression tree analysis. In all models, using both simulated and actual ecological data, we found inferences to be biased, sometimes severely, when sample inclusion probabilities were ignored, while IPB sampling effectively produced unbiased parameter estimates."
https://openalex.org/W790064874,"The syntax-first model and the parallel/interactive models make different predictions regarding whether syntactic category processing has a temporal and functional primacy over semantic processing. To further resolve this issue, an event-related potential experiment was conducted on 24 Chinese speakers reading Chinese passive sentences with the passive marker BEI (NP1 + BEI + NP2 + Verb). This construction was selected because it is the most-commonly used Chinese passive and very much resembles German passives, upon which the syntax-first hypothesis was primarily based. We manipulated semantic consistency (consistent vs. inconsistent) and syntactic category (noun vs. verb) of the critical verb, yielding four conditions: CORRECT (correct sentences), SEMANTIC (semantic anomaly), SYNTACTIC (syntactic category anomaly), and COMBINED (combined anomalies). Results showed both N400 and P600 effects for sentences with semantic anomaly, with syntactic category anomaly, or with combined anomalies. Converging with recent findings of Chinese ERP studies on various constructions, our study provides further evidence that syntactic category processing does not precede semantic processing in reading Chinese."
https://openalex.org/W1704833857,"Fitness is an individual's ability to survive and reproduce, and is an important concept in evolutionary biology. However, accurately measuring fitness is often difficult, and appropriate fitness surrogates need to be identified. Lifetime reproductive success, the total progeny an organism can produce in their lifetime, is thought to be a suitable proxy for fitness, but the measure of an organism's reproductive output across a lifetime can be difficult or impossible to obtain. Here we demonstrate that the short-term measure of reproductive success across five days provides a reasonable prediction of an individual's total lifetime reproductive success in Drosophila melanogaster. However, the lifetime reproductive success of a female that has only mated once is not correlated to the lifetime reproductive success of a female that is allowed to mate multiple times, demonstrating that these measures should not serve as surrogates nor be used to make inferences about one another."

In this study we analyzed the molecular mechanisms of the calcitriol-mediated inhibition of Hh signaling. Mass spectroscopic assays and media transfer experiments demonstrate that Ptch is dispensable for the synthesis of calcitriol from its precursor vitamin D3. However, it is essential for calcitriol release into the extracellular space. In addition, functional competition assays, fluorescence-based replacement studies, and analysis of the activity of several Smo variants show that calcitriol does neither bind to the 7TM of Smo nor to its CRD but efficiently inhibits the translocation of Smo into the primary cilia in Ptchâˆ’/âˆ’ and SAG-treated NIH-3T3 cells. Beyond that the antitumoral effects of calcitriol are strongly enhanced by itraconazole (ITZ) which was not induced by an ITZ-mediated elevated bioavailability of calcitriol but by a synergism of both compounds in Hh signaling inhibition. Taken together, our results strengthened our hypothesis that calcitriol is a physiological regulator of Hh signaling activity. Moreover, this study opens new perspectives for combined calcitriol/ITZ-based therapies against Hh-associated cancers.

https://openalex.org/W1526212327,"In the Americas, women with Indigenous American ancestry are at increased risk of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP), relative to women of other ethnicities. We hypothesized that ancestry-related genetic factors contribute to this increased risk. We collected clinical and laboratory data, and performed biochemical assays on samples from U.S. Latinas and Chilean women, with and without ICP. The study sample included 198 women with ICP (90 from California, U.S., and 108 from Chile) and 174 pregnant control women (69 from California, U.S., and 105 from Chile). SNP genotyping was performed using Affymetrix arrays. We compared overall genetic ancestry between cases and controls, and used a genome-wide admixture mapping approach to screen for ICP susceptibility loci. We identified commonalities and differences in features of ICP between the 2 countries and determined that cases had a greater proportion of Indigenous American ancestry than did controls (p = 0.034). We performed admixture mapping, taking country of origin into account, and identified one locus for which Native American ancestry was associated with increased risk of ICP at a genome-wide level of significance (P = 3.1 x 10-5, Pcorrected = 0.035). This locus has an odds ratio of 4.48 (95% CI: 2.21-9.06) for 2 versus zero Indigenous American chromosomes. This locus lies on chromosome 2, with a 10 Mb 95% confidence interval which does not contain any previously identified hereditary â€˜cholestasis genes.â€™ Our results indicate that genetic factors contribute to the risk of developing ICP in the Americas, and support the utility of clinical and genetic studies of ethnically mixed populations for increasing our understanding of ICP."
https://openalex.org/W769498204,"Monitoring mice exposed to carbon ion radiotherapy provides an indirect method to evaluate the potential for second cancer induction in normal tissues outside the radiotherapy target volume, since such estimates are not yet possible from historical patient data. Here, male and female B6C3F1 mice were given single or fractionated whole-body exposure(s) to a monoenergetic carbon ion radiotherapy beam at the Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba, Japan, matching the radiation quality delivered to the normal tissue ahead of the tumour volume (average linear energy transfer = 13 keV.Î¼m-1) during patient radiotherapy protocols. The mice were monitored for the remainder of their lifespan, and a large number of T cell lymphomas that arose in these mice were analysed alongside those arising following an equivalent dose of 137Cs gamma ray-irradiation. Using genome-wide DNA copy number analysis to identify genomic loci involved in radiation-induced lymphomagenesis and subsequent detailed analysis of Notch1, Ikzf1, Pten, Trp53 and Bcl11b genes, we compared the genetic profile of the carbon ion- and gamma ray-induced tumours. The canonical set of genes previously associated with radiation-induced T cell lymphoma was identified in both radiation groups. While the pattern of disruption of the various pathways was somewhat different between the radiation types, most notably Pten mutation frequency and loss of heterozygosity flanking Bcl11b, the most striking finding was the observation of large interstitial deletions at various sites across the genome in carbon ion-induced tumours, which were only seen infrequently in the gamma ray-induced tumours analysed. If such large interstitial chromosomal deletions are a characteristic lesion of carbon ion irradiation, even when using the low linear energy transfer radiation to which normal tissues are exposed in radiotherapy patients, understanding the dose-response and tissue specificity of such DNA damage could prove key to assessing second cancer risk in carbon ion radiotherapy patients."

The information was collected from medical records and through face-to-face interviews, and we examined rejection rate and the factors affecting the use of powered prosthesis.The rate of discontinuation was 21.6% as 8 of the 37 children stopped using powered prosthesis. All of them were fitted their prosthesis after 2 years of age, and they rejected prosthesis between 5 to 19 years. We found that the level of amputation had no influence on the use of a powered prosthesis.Children fitted before 2 years of age tend to accept their powered prosthesis than those fitted after 2 years. Multidisciprinary team approach, adequate rehabilitation, detailed follow-up and involvement of parents are quite important for introducing powered prosthesis for children."
https://openalex.org/W1536315796,"The subjective representation of the sounds delivered to the two ears of a human listener is closely associated with the interaural delay and correlation of these two-ear sounds. When the two-ear sounds, e.g., arbitrary noises, arrive simultaneously, the single auditory image of the binaurally identical noises becomes increasingly diffuse, and eventually separates into two auditory images as the interaural correlation decreases. When the interaural delay increases from zero to several milliseconds, the auditory image of the binaurally identical noises also changes from a single image to two distinct images. However, measuring the effect of these two factors on an identical group of participants has not been investigated. This study examined the impacts of interaural correlation and delay on detecting a binaurally uncorrelated fragment (interaural correlation = 0) embedded in the binaurally correlated noises (i.e., binaural gap or break in interaural correlation). We found that the minimum duration of the binaural gap for its detection (i.e., duration threshold) increased exponentially as the interaural delay between the binaurally identical noises increased linearly from 0 to 8 ms. When no interaural delay was introduced, the duration threshold also increased exponentially as the interaural correlation of the binaurally correlated noises decreased linearly from 1 to 0.4. A linear relationship between the effect of interaural delay and that of interaural correlation was described for listeners participating in this study: a 1 ms increase in interaural delay appeared to correspond to a 0.07 decrease in interaural correlation specific to raising the duration threshold. Our results imply that a tradeoff may exist between the impacts of interaural correlation and interaural delay on the subjective representation of sounds delivered to two human ears."
https://openalex.org/W827260252,"Invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) is caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and mostly presents as pneumonia, sepsis or meningitis. A notable portion of IPD cases is vaccine preventable and the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) was introduced into the routine childhood immunization programs in many countries during the last decades.Before PCV introduction in the Czech Republic in 2010, a national surveillance system for IPD was implemented in 2008 and further improved in 2011. In this study, we describe the new surveillance system for the first time and measure its sensitivity between 2010 and 2013 using the capture-recapture method. Furthermore, we describe the recent epidemiological trend of IPD, taking sensitivity estimates into account.Between 2010 and 2013 the estimated sensitivity of the overall IPD surveillance increased from 81% to 99%. The sensitivity of individual reporting sources increased from 72% to 87% for the laboratory system and from 31% to 89% for the epidemiological notification system. Crucial for this improvement was the introduction of quarterly report reminders in 2011. Due to positive source dependency, the presented sensitivity estimates are most probably overestimated and reflect the upper limit of reporting completeness. Stratification showed variation in sensitivity of reporting particularly according to region. An effect of the PVC vaccination in the Czech Republic is visible in the incidence of IPD in target age groups (<5 y). This influence was not evident in the total IPD incidence and may interfere with increasing sensitivity of reporting. In 2013, an increase in the IPD incidence was observed. This finding requires further observation and a detailed vaccine impact analysis is needed to assess the current immunization strategy."

A board was used as the physical reference carrier for true verticals and NHP alignment mirror orientation. Orientation axes were detected and saved from the digital mesh model of the board. They were used for correcting the pitch, roll and yaw angles of the subsequent captures of patientsâ€™ facial surfaces, which were obtained without any markings or sensors attached onto the patient. We tested the proposed method on two commercial active (3dMD) and passive (DI3D) SP devices. The reliability of the pitch, roll and yaw for the board placement were within Â±0.039904Â°, Â±0.081623Â°, and Â±0.062320Â°; where standard deviations were 0.020234Â°, 0.045645Â° and 0.027211Â° respectively. Conclusion: Orientation-calibrated stereo-photogrammetry is the most accurate method (angulation deviation within Â±0.1Â°) reported for complete NHP recording with insignificant clinical error."
https://openalex.org/W1487465440,"Species distribution models are used for numerous purposes such as predicting changes in species' ranges and identifying biodiversity hotspots. Although implications of distribution models for conservation are often implicit, few studies use these tools explicitly to inform conservation efforts. Herein, we illustrate how multiple distribution models developed using distinct sets of environmental variables can be integrated to aid in identification sites for use in conservation. We focus on the endangered arroyo toad (Anaxyrus californicus), which relies on open, sandy streams and surrounding floodplains in southern California, USA, and northern Baja California, Mexico. Declines of the species are largely attributed to habitat degradation associated with vegetation encroachment, invasive predators, and altered hydrologic regimes. We had three main goals: 1) develop a model of potential habitat for arroyo toads, based on long-term environmental variables and all available locality data; 2) develop a model of the species' current habitat by incorporating recent remotely-sensed variables and only using recent locality data; and 3) integrate results of both models to identify sites that may be employed in conservation efforts. We used a machine learning technique, Random Forests, to develop the models, focused on riparian zones in southern California. We identified 14.37% and 10.50% of our study area as potential and current habitat for the arroyo toad, respectively. Generally, inclusion of remotely-sensed variables reduced modeled suitability of sites, thus many areas modeled as potential habitat were not modeled as current habitat. We propose such sites could be made suitable for arroyo toads through active management, increasing current habitat by up to 67.02%. Our general approach can be employed to guide conservation efforts of virtually any species with sufficient data necessary to develop appropriate distribution models."
https://openalex.org/W856894231,"Human preferences for certain morphological attributes among domestic animals may be entirely individual or, more generally, may reflect evolutionary pressures that favor certain conformation. Artificial selection for attributes, such as short heads and crested necks of horses, may have functional and welfare implications because there is evidence from other species that skull shape co-varies with behaviour. Crested necks can be accentuated by flexion of the neck, a quality that is often manipulated in photographs vendors use when selling horses. Equine head-and-neck positions acquired through rein tension can compromise welfare. Our investigation was designed to identify conformations and postures that people are attracted to when choosing their 'ideal' horse. Participants of an internet survey were asked to rate their preference for horse silhouettes that illustrated three gradations of five variables: facial shape, crest height, ear length, ear position and head-and-neck carriage. There were 1,234 usable responses. The results show that overall preferences are for the intermediate, rather than extreme, morphological choices (p=<0.001). They also indicate that males are 2.5 times less likely to prefer thicker necks rather than the intermediate shape, and 4 times more likely to prefer the thinner neck shape. When compared to the novice participants, experienced participants were 1.9 times more likely to prefer a thicker neck shape than the intermediate neck shape and 2.8 times less likely to prefer a thinner neck shape than the intermediate neck shape. There was overall preference of 93% (n=939) for the category of head carriage 'In front of the vertical'. However, novice participants were 1.8 times more likely to choose 'behind the vertical' than 'in front of the vertical'. Our results suggest that people prefer a natural head carriage, concave facial profile (dished face), larger ears and thicker necks. From these survey data, it seems that some innate preferences may run counter to horse health and welfare."
https://openalex.org/W1260274110,"The lack of capacity to monitor forest carbon stocks in developing countries is undermining global efforts to reduce carbon emissions. Involving local people in monitoring forest carbon stocks could potentially address this capacity gap. This study conducts a complete expert remeasurement of community-led biomass inventories in remote tropical forests of Papua New Guinea. By fully remeasuring and isolating the effects of 4,481 field measurements, we demonstrate that programmes employing local people (non-experts) can produce forest monitoring data as reliable as those produced by scientists (experts). Overall, non-experts reported lower biomass estimates by an average of 9.1%, equivalent to 55.2 fewer tonnes of biomass ha(-1), which could have important financial implications for communities. However, there were no significant differences between forest biomass estimates of expert and non-expert, nor were there significant differences in some of the components used to calculate these estimates, such as tree diameter at breast height (DBH), tree counts and plot surface area, but were significant differences between tree heights. At the landscape level, the greatest biomass discrepancies resulted from height measurements (41%) and, unexpectedly, a few large missing trees contributing to a third of the overall discrepancies. We show that 85% of the biomass discrepancies at the tree level were caused by measurement taken on large trees (DBH â‰¥50 cm), even though they consisted of only 14% of the stems. We demonstrate that programmes that engage local people can provide high-quality forest carbon data that could help overcome barriers to reducing forest carbon emissions in developing countries. Nonetheless, community-based monitoring programmes should prioritise reducing errors in the field that lead to the most important discrepancies, notably; overcoming challenges to accurately measure large trees."
https://openalex.org/W1689126980,"Biliary cysts in adult patients affected by polycystic liver disease are lined by cholangiocytes that proliferate, suggesting that initiation of cyst formation depends on proliferation. Here, we challenge this view by analyzing cyst-lining cell proliferation and differentiation in Cpk mouse embryos and in livers from human fetuses affected by Autosomal Recessive Polycystic Kidney Disease (ARPKD), at early stages of cyst formation. Proliferation of fetal cholangiocyte precursors, measured by immunostaining in human and mouse livers, was low and did not differ between normal and ARPKD or Cpk livers, excluding excessive proliferation as an initiating cause of liver cysts. Instead, our analyses provide evidence that the polycystic livers exhibit increased and accelerated differentiation of hepatoblasts into cholangiocyte precursors, eventually coalescing into large biliary cysts. Lineage tracing experiments, performed in mouse embryos, indicated that the cholangiocyte precursors in Cpk mice generate cholangiocytes and periportal hepatocytes, like in wild-type animals. Therefore, contrary to current belief, cyst formation in polycystic liver disease does not necessarily depend on overproliferation. Combining our prenatal data with available data from adult livers, we propose that polycystic liver can be initiated by proliferation-independent mechanisms at a fetal stage, followed by postnatal proliferation-dependent cyst expansion."
https://openalex.org/W823422268,"The rapid expansion of Internet brings us overwhelming online information, which is impossible for an individual to go through all of it. Therefore, recommender systems were created to help people dig through this abundance of information. In networks composed by users and objects, recommender algorithms based on diffusion have been proven to be one of the best performing methods. Previous works considered the diffusion process from user to object, and from object to user to be equivalent. We show in this work that it is not the case and we improve the quality of the recommendation by taking into account the asymmetrical nature of this process. We apply this idea to modify the state-of-the-art recommendation methods. The simulation results show that the new methods can outperform these existing methods in both recommendation accuracy and diversity. Finally, this modification is checked to be able to improve the recommendation in a realistic case."
https://openalex.org/W832586497,"Olfaction is primarily mediated by highly specific olfactory receptors (ORs), a subfamily of which are the pheromone receptors that play a key role in sexual communication and can contribute to reproductive isolation. Here we cloned and identified an olfactory receptor, SlituOR3 (Genbank NO. JN835270), from Spodoptera litura, to be the candidate pheromone receptor. It exhibited male-biased expression in the antennae, where they were localized at the base of sensilla trichoidea. Conserved orthologues of these receptors were found amongst known pheromone receptors within the Lepidoptera, and SlituOR3 were placed amongst a clade of candidate pheromone receptors in a phylogeny tree of insect ORs. SlituOR3 is required for the EAG responses to both Z9E11-14:OAc and Z9E12-14:OAc SlituOR3 showed differential expression in S. litura populations attracted to traps baited with a series of sex pheromone blends composed of different ratios of (9Z,11E)-tetradecadienyl acetate (Z9E11-14:OAc) and (9Z,12E)-tetradecadienyl acetate (Z9E12-14:OAc). The changes in the expression level of SlitOR3 and antennal responses after SlitOR3 silencing suggested that SlitOR3 is required for the sex pheromone signaling. We infer that variation in transcription levels of olfactory receptors may modulate sex pheromone perception in male moths and could affect both of pest control and monitoring efficiency by pheromone application after long time mass trapping with one particular ratio of blend in the field."
https://openalex.org/W1520697619,"In the aftermath of a major radiological accident, the medical management of overexposed individuals will rely on the determination of the dose of ionizing radiations absorbed by the victims. Because people in the general population do not possess conventional dosimeters, after the fact dose reconstruction methods are needed. Free radicals are induced by radiations in the tooth enamel of victims, in direct proportion to dose, and can be quantified using Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectrometry, a technique that was demonstrated to be very appropriate for mass triage. The presence of dimethacrylate based restorations on teeth can interfere with the dosimetric signal from the enamel, as free radicals could also be induced in the various composites used. The aim of the present study was to screen irradiated composites for a possible radiation-induced EPR signal, to characterize it, and evaluate a possible interference with the dosimetric signal of the enamel. We investigated the most common commercial composites, and experimental compositions, for a possible class effect. The effect of the dose was studied between 10 Gy and 100 Gy using high sensitivity X-band spectrometer. The influence of this radiation-induced signal from the composite on the dosimetric signal of the enamel was also investigated using a clinical L-Band EPR spectrometer, specifically developed in the EPR center at Dartmouth College. In X-band, a radiation-induced signal was observed for high doses (25-100 Gy); it was rapidly decaying, and not detected after only 24h post irradiation. At 10 Gy, the signal was in most cases not measurable in the commercial composites tested, with the exception of 3 composites showing a significant intensity. In L-band study, only one irradiated commercial composite influenced significantly the dosimetric signal of the tooth, with an overestimation about 30%. In conclusion, the presence of the radiation-induced signal from dental composites should not significantly influence the dosimetry for early dose assessment."
https://openalex.org/W857020444,"Previous theory indicates that zygotic linkage disequilibrium (LD) is more informative than gametic or composite digenic LD in revealing natural population history. Further, the difference between the composite digenic and maximum zygotic LDs can be used to detect epistatic selection for fitness. Here we corroborate the theory by investigating genome-wide zygotic LDs in HapMap phase III human populations. Results show that non-Africa populations have much more significant zygotic LDs than do Africa populations. Africa populations (ASW, LWK, MKK, and YRI) possess more significant zygotic LDs for the double-homozygotes (DAABB) than any other significant zygotic LDs (DAABb, DAaBB, and DAaBb), while non-Africa populations generally have more significant DAaBb's than any other significant zygotic LDs (DAABB, DAABb, and DAaBB). Average r-squares for any significant zygotic LDs increase generally in an order of populations YRI, MKK, CEU, CHB, LWK, JPT, CHD, TSI, GIH, ASW, and MEX. Average r-squares are greater for DAABB and DAaBb than for DAaBB and DAABb in each population. YRI and MKK can be separated from LWK and ASW in terms of the pattern of average r-squares. All population divergences in zygotic LDs can be interpreted with the model of Out of Africa for modern human origins. We have also detected 19735-95921 SNP pairs exhibiting strong signals of epistatic selection in different populations. Gene-gene interactions for some epistatic SNP pairs are evident from empirical findings, but many more epistatic SNP pairs await evidence. Common epistatic SNP pairs rarely exist among all populations, but exist in distinct regions (Africa, Europe, and East Asia), which helps to understand geographical genomic medicine."
https://openalex.org/W1697042652,"Flatfoot (pes planus) is one of the most important physical examination items for military new recruits in Taiwan. Currently, the diagnosis of flatfoot is mainly based on radiographic examination of the calcaneal-fifth metatarsal (CA-MT5) angle, also known as the arch angle. However, manual measurement of the arch angle is time-consuming and often inconsistent between different examiners. In this study, seventy male military new recruits were studied. Lateral radiographic images of their right and left feet were obtained, and mutual information (MI) registration was used to automatically calculate the arch angle. Images of two critical bones, the calcaneus and the fifth metatarsal bone, were isolated from the lateral radiographs to form reference images, and were then compared with template images to calculate the arch angle. The result of this computer-calculated arch angle was compared with manual measurement results from two radiologists, which showed that our automatic arch angle measurement method had a high consistency. In addition, this method had a high accuracy of 97% and 96% as compared with the measurements of radiologists A and B, respectively. The findings indicated that our MI registration measurement method cannot only accurately measure the CA-MT5 angle, but also saves time and reduces human error. This method can increase the consistency of arch angle measurement and has potential clinical application for the diagnosis of flatfoot."
https://openalex.org/W1254134366,"The formation of multi-species feeding flocks (MSFFs) through visual recruitment is considered an important strategy for obtaining food in seabirds and its functionality has been ascribed to enhanced foraging efficiency. Its use has been demonstrated in much of the world's oceans and includes numerous species. However, there is scant information on the temporal stability of the composition and abundance of MSFFs as well as the effect of seasonal food availability on their dynamics. Between July 2006 and September 2014, we conducted monthly at-sea seabird counts at Valparaiso Bay (32Â°56' to 33Â°01'S, 71Â°36' to 71Â°46'W) within the area of influence of the Humboldt Current in central Chile. This area is characterized by a marked seasonality in primary and secondary production associated with upwelling, mainly during austral spring-summer. Based on studies that provide evidence that flocking is most frequent when food is both scarce and patchy, we hypothesized that seabird MSFF attributes (i.e. frequency of occurrence, abundance and composition) will be modified according to the seasonal availability of food. Using generalized linear models (GLMs), our results show that the contrasting seasonality in food availability of the study area (using chlorophyll-a concentration as a proxy) had no significant influence on MSFF attributes, sparsely explaining their variations (P>0.05). Rather than seasonal food availability, the observed pattern for MSFF attributes at Valparaiso Bay suggests a substantial influence of reproductive and migratory (boreal and austral migrants) habits of birds that modulates MSFF dynamics consistently throughout the whole year in this highly variable and patchy environment. We highlight the importance of visual recruitment as a mechanism by which migratory and resident birds interact. This would allow them to reduce resource unpredictability, which in turn has a major impact on structuring seabird's MSFF dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W813038762,"Microvitellogenin (mVg) is a relatively small vitellogenic protein only characterized in the eggs of the lepidopteran insects Manduca sexta and Bombyx mori. In the present study, we report a novel mVg (ApmVg) isolated from the Chinese oak silkworm Antheraea pernyi. The obtained ApmVg cDNA sequence contains an open reading frame of 783 bp encoding a protein of 260 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 29.96 kDa. This gene does not contain introns. Structural analysis revealed that this protein shares putative conserved domains with the lepidopteran low-molecular weight lipoprotein, which belongs to the lipoprotein_11 superfamily. The protein sequence of ApmVg exhibits 48% sequence identity with mVg from M. sexta and 40-47% sequence identity with the 30K lipoproteins from B. mori. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that ApmVg is a novel member of the lepidopteran low-molecular weight lipoproteins. Transcriptional analysis indicated that ApmVg mRNA is mainly expressed in the fat body (both female and male) during post-diapause development of the pupal stage, and it was also detected in ovaries and spermaries in smaller amounts. RT-PCR and Western blot analyses revealed that ApmVg is synthesized by the fat body and secreted into hemolymph and ultimately accumulates in eggs. The ApmVg transcript can be detected in the fat bodies of female pupae four days after treatment with 20-hydroxyecdysone and shows an expression pattern distinct from that of vitellogenin (Vg), which is detectable throughout diapausing and in post-diapause development. ApmVg decreased dramatically during embryonic development. These results represent the first study of mVg outside M. sexta and B. mori and provide insight into the physiological role and evolution of mVgs."
https://openalex.org/W1483110389,"In this paper we propose a vectorized implementation of the non-parametric bootstrap for statistics based on sample moments. Basically, we adopt the multinomial sampling formulation of the non-parametric bootstrap, and compute bootstrap replications of sample moment statistics by simply weighting the observed data according to multinomial counts instead of evaluating the statistic on a resampled version of the observed data. Using this formulation we can generate a matrix of bootstrap weights and compute the entire vector of bootstrap replications with a few matrix multiplications. Vectorization is particularly important for matrix-oriented programming languages such as R, where matrix/vector calculations tend to be faster than scalar operations implemented in a loop. We illustrate the application of the vectorized implementation in real and simulated data sets, when bootstrapping Pearsonâ€™s sample correlation coefficient, and compared its performance against two state-of-the-art R implementations of the non-parametric bootstrap, as well as a straightforward one based on a for loop. Our investigations spanned varying sample sizes and number of bootstrap replications. The vectorized bootstrap compared favorably against the state-of-the-art implementations in all cases tested, and was remarkably/considerably faster for small/moderate sample sizes. The same results were observed in the comparison with the straightforward implementation, except for large sample sizes, where the vectorized bootstrap was slightly slower than the straightforward implementation due to increased time expenditures in the generation of weight matrices via multinomial sampling."
https://openalex.org/W1594192002,"Helices are the most abundant secondary structural elements in proteins and the structural forms assumed by double stranded DNAs (dsDNA). Though the mathematical expression for a helical curve is simple, none of the previous models for the biomolecular helices in either proteins or DNAs use a genuine helical curve, likely because of the complexity of fitting backbone atoms to helical curves. In this paper we model a helix as a series of different but all bona fide helical curves; each one best fits the coordinates of four consecutive backbone CÎ± atoms for a protein or P atoms for a DNA molecule. An implementation of the model demonstrates that it is more accurate than the previous ones for the description of the deviation of a helix from a standard helical curve. Furthermore, the accuracy of the model makes it possible to correlate deviations with structural and functional significance. When applied to helix visualization, the ribbon diagrams generated by the model are less choppy or have smaller side chain detachment than those by the previous visualization programs that typically model a helix as a series of low-degree splines."
https://openalex.org/W823485269,"The Taiwanese (Formosan) macaque (Macaca cyclopis) is the only nonhuman primate endemic to Taiwan. This primate species is valuable for evolutionary studies and as subjects in medical research. However, only partial fragments of the mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) of this primate species have been sequenced, not mentioning its nuclear genome. We employed next-generation sequencing to generate 2 x 90 bp paired-end reads, followed by reference-assisted de novo assembly with multiple k-mer strategy to characterize the M. cyclopis mitogenome. We compared the assembled mitogenome with that of other macaque species for phylogenetic analysis. Our results show that, the M. cyclopis mitogenome consists of 16,563 nucleotides encoding for 13 protein-coding genes, 2 ribosomal RNAs and 22 transfer RNAs. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that M. cyclopis is most closely related to M. mulatta lasiota (Chinese rhesus macaque), supporting the notion of Asia-continental origin of M. cyclopis proposed in previous studies based on partial mitochondrial sequences. Our work presents a novel approach for assembling a mitogenome that utilizes the capabilities of de novo genome assembly with assistance of a reference genome. The availability of the complete Taiwanese macaque mitogenome will facilitate the study of primate evolution and the characterization of genetic variations for the potential usage of this species as a non-human primate model for medical research."
