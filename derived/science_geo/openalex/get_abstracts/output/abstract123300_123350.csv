https://openalex.org/W2040328392,"Vanadate and pervanadate (the complexes of vanadate with hydrogen peroxide) are two commonly used general protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) inhibitors. These compounds also have insulin-mimetic properties, an observation that has generated a great deal of interest and study. Since a careful kinetic study of the two inhibitors has been lacking, we sought to analyze their mechanisms of inhibition. Our results show that vanadate is a competitive inhibitor for the protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B, with a Ki of 0.38 ±; 0.02 μM. EDTA, which is known to chelate vanadate, causes an immediate and complete reversal of the inhibition due to vanadate when added to an enzyme assay. Pervanadate, by contrast, inhibits by irreversibly oxidizing the catalytic cysteine of PTP1B, as determined by mass spectrometry. Reducing agents such as dithiothreitol that are used in PTP assays to keep the catalytic cysteine reduced and active were found to convert pervanadate rapidly to vanadate. Under certain conditions, slow time-dependent inactivation by vanadate was observed; since catalase blocked this inactivation, it was ascribed to in situ generation of hydrogen peroxide and subsequent formation of pervanadate. Implications for the use of these compounds as inhibitors and rationalization for some of their in vivo effects are considered.

Protein-tyrosine phosphorylation plays a central role in regulating a variety of fundamental cellular processes (1Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Google Scholar, 2Glenney Jr., J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1134: 113-127Google Scholar, 3Brautigan D.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1114: 63-77Google Scholar). The tyrosyl phosphorylation state of a protein in the cell reflects the balance between the competing activities of the protein-tyrosine kinases and the protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). 1The abbreviations used are: PTPprotein tyrosine phosphataseDTTdithiothreitolFDPfluorescein diphosphateHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyMSmass spectrometryMS/MStandem mass spectrometrycapillary LC-MScapillary HPLC-electrospray ionization mass spectrometryVLmonoperoxovanadateVL2diperoxovanadate. Substantial progress has been made in understanding the function of protein-tyrosine kinases, while increased attention has only been recently focused on the PTPs. The identification of a large family of PTPs (4Walton K.M. Dixon J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 101-120Google Scholar), comprising two distinct groups, arose from the purification and sequencing of human placental PTP1B (5Tonks N.K. Diltz C.D. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6722-6730Google Scholar, 6Tonks N.K. Diltz C.D. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6731-6737Google Scholar, 7Charbonneau H. Tonks N.K. Walsh K.A. Fischer E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1988; 85: 7182-7186Google Scholar). The first group of PTPs has been described as receptor-like with a single transmembrane domain, one or two intracellular catalytic domains, and a unique extracellular domain of variable length. Several PTPs in this group also contain regions representing putative ligand binding domain motifs. The second group consists of cytoplasmic enzymes, having a single catalytic domain and a variable amino- or carboxyl-terminal regulatory domain. protein tyrosine phosphatase dithiothreitol fluorescein diphosphate high pressure liquid chromatography mass spectrometry tandem mass spectrometry capillary HPLC-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry monoperoxovanadate diperoxovanadate. PTPs are specific for the dephosphorylation of phosphotyrosyl residues of proteins and peptides (reviewed in 8Stone R.L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31323-31326Google Scholar, 9Zhang Z.-Y.

Biol. 1995; 2: 1043-1053Google Scholar). The hallmark of PTPs is an essential cysteine residue at the catalytic site, which forms a thiol-phosphate intermediate during catalysis (12Guan K. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17026-17030Google Scholar, 13Cho H. Krishnaraj R. Kitas E. Walsh C.T. Anderson K.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 7296-7298Google Scholar). Since reducing conditions usually maintained by thiol reagents are necessary for keeping the enzyme active, thiol-oxidizing agents are potent PTP inhibitors. Vanadate (VO43–) is a general PTP inhibitor (14Swarup G. Cohen S. Garbers D.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 107: 1104-1109Google Scholar), whose mechanisms of action have not been investigated in detail. Vanadate is a phosphate analog and is generally thought to bind as a transition state analog to the phosphoryl transfer enzymes that it inhibits, since it can easily adopt a trigonal bipyramidal structure (15Gresser M.J. Tracey A.S. Chasteen N.D. Vanadium in Biological Systems. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Netherlands1990: 63-79Google Scholar). Vanadate has a wide variety of effects on biological systems (16Shechter Y. Meyerovitch J. Farfel Z. Sack J. Bruck R. Bar-Meir S. Amir S. Degani H Karlish S.J.D. Chasteen N.D. Vanadium in Biological Systems. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Netherlands1990: 129-142Google Scholar). It is insulin-mimetic (17Heyliger C.E. Tahiliani A.G. McNeil J.H. Science. 1985; 227: 1474-1477Google Scholar) and has been shown in human clinical trials to be potentially useful in treating both insulin- and noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (18Goldfine A.B. Simonson D.C. Folli F. Patti M.-E. Kahn C.R. J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab. 1995; 80: 3311-3320Google Scholar). It has been suggested that part of vanadate's insulin-mimetic effect may be due to its inhibition of PTPs (19Shechter Y. Diabetes. 1990; 39: 1-5Google Scholar). Another inhibitor on which considerable attention has been recently focused is pervanadate (a general term for the variety of complexes formed between vanadate and hydrogen peroxide). Pervanadate is also insulin-mimetic and appears to be more effective than vanadate in increasing the level of cellular tyrosine phosphorylation (20Kadota S. Fantus I.G. Deragon G. Guyda H.J. Hersh B. Posner B.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 147: 259-266Google Scholar, 21Fantus I.G. Kadota S. Deragon G. Foster B. Posner B.I. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8864-8871Google Scholar, 22Leighton B.

Peroxovanadium complexes containing one or more chelating ligands in addition to the oxo and peroxo ligands are generally more stable and exhibit even more potent insulin-mimetic effects (26Posner B.I. Faure R. Burgess J.W. Bevan A.P. Lachance D. Zhang-Sun G. Fantus I.G. Ng J.B. Hall D.A. Lum B.S. Shaver A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4596-4604Google Scholar, 27Bevan A.P. Drake P.G. Yale J.-F.

Biochem. 1995; 153: 181-190Google Scholar). While vanadate and pervanadate have been widely studied for their insulin-mimetic effects and are commonly used as general inhibitors of PTPs, their mechanisms of inhibition have not been carefully studied. Here we show that vanadate and pervanadate inhibit PTPs by completely different mechanisms. Furthermore, common buffer components such as EDTA and reducing agents can interact with these inhibitors, greatly affecting their potencies. These medium effects and the different modes of inhibition of vanadate and pervanadate have important implications for their use and provide a rationalization for their different effects both in vitro and in vivo. Vanadium(V) oxide (99.99%) and hydrogen peroxide (30%) were from Aldrich. Bovine liver catalase was from Sigma, and sequencing grade trypsin was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. All other chemicals were of reagent grade from Sigma. The catalytic domain of PTP1B, consisting of amino acids 1-321, was inserted into the EcoRI site of the pFLAG-2 vector (Kodak). Bacterial cultures were grown in Terrific Broth (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: A.2Google Scholar) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 0.4% glucose at 37†C, 225 rpm, for 2-3 h (A600 = 0.4-0.8). The culture was then induced with the addition of isopropylthio-β-D-galactoside to 0.5 mM and grown overnight at 27†C, 225 rpm. The induced culture (500 ml) was centrifuged at 4†C for 20 min at 6000 × g. All subsequent steps were carried out at 4†C. The cell pellet was resuspended in 25 ml of buffer A (10 mM NaH2PO4, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.67 mg/ml lysozyme, 2 mg/ml each pepstatin and aprotinin, 1 mM DTT), and then 5 ml of buffer B (1.5 M NaCl, 0.1 M MgCl2, 0.1 M CaCl2, 250 mg/ml DNase I) were added. The resuspended cell pellet was sonicated (5 × 10-s bursts), incubated on ice 10-15 min or until no longer viscous, and centrifuged for 15 min at 43,000 × g. The supernatant was then loaded onto a 17.5-ml M2 FLAG monoclonal antibody affinity column (Interscience), the column was washed with phosphate-buffered saline (10 column volumes), and the FLAG-PTP1B fusion protein was eluted in phosphate-buffered saline by competition with the FLAG peptide as described by the manufacturer. Approximately 5-7 mg of PTP1B (≫95% pure as estimated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) were recovered from a 500-ml culture. Vanadate stock solution was prepared by dissolving vanadium(V) oxide in 2.1 molar equivalents of 1 N NaOH, stirring the solution until the yellow color had essentially disappeared (2-3 days), and then diluting with water to a final concentration of 100 mM (30Tracey A.S. Gresser M.J. Liu S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 5869-5874Google Scholar). Pervanadate stock solution (1 mM) was prepared by adding 10 μl of 100 mM vanadate and 50 μl of 100 mM hydrogen peroxide (diluted from a 30% stock in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.3) to 940 μl of H2O. Excess hydrogen peroxide was removed by adding catalase (100 μg/ml final concentration = 260 units/ml) 5 min after mixing the vanadate and hydrogen peroxide. The pervanadate solutions were used within 5 min to minimize decomposition of the vanadate-hydrogen peroxide complex (31Jaswal J.S. Tracey A.S. Inorg. Chem. 1991; 30: 3718-3722Google Scholar). PTP1B was assayed in a buffer containing final concentrations of 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.3, 5 mM DTT, and 10 μg/ml bovine serum albumin using FDP as a substrate. Activity was measured by following the increase in absorbance at 450 nm due to fluorescein monophosphate production 2Huang, Z., Wang, Q., Ly, H., Govindarajan, A., Scheigetz, I., Zamboni, R., and Ramachandran, C., manuscript in preparation. using a Hewlett Packard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer (ε450 for fluorescein monophosphate = 27,500 M–1 cm–1). PTP1B samples were prepared for MS by incubating 9.4 μM enzyme on ice in 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.3, 5 mM NaH2PO4, and 75 mM NaCl in the presence and absence of 47.6 μM pervanadate. The reaction with pervanadate was quenched after 15 min with the addition of DTT to a final concentration of 10 mM. The protein samples were analyzed by capillary HPLC-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (capillary LC-MS). The capillary column used was a 254-μm inner diameter × 120-mm length of PEEK tubing packed with 10-μm POROS® R2 stationary phase (PerSeptive Biosystems Inc., Framingham, MA). A Waters 600-MS HPLC pump (Waters, Milford, MA) was used to supply a mobile phase gradient (10-80% aqueous acetonitrile, 0.5% glacial acetic acid in 20 min). The capillary column was attached directly to the exit port of a Valco 0.5-μl internal loop injector (Valco Instrument Co. Inc., Houston, TX). A precolumn splitter was installed between the pump and the injector to adjust the flow through the column to 15 μl/min (from a pump flow of 900 μl/min). The column eluate was fed directly to the electrospray ionization source of a TSQ 7000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Finnigan Mat, San Jose, CA). The electrospray ionization voltage was +4.2 kV, the nebulization gas pressure was 30 p.s.i., and the inlet capillary temperature was 200†C. Full scan mass spectra (m/z 600-2000) were acquired in profile mode using the third quadrupole (Q3) as the mass analyzer. The protein mass spectra were analyzed and deconvoluted using the Bioworks™ application software (Finnigan Mat). Tryptic peptides were prepared by digesting the samples with approximately 1:20 (w/w) sequencing-grade trypsin for 18 h at 37†C. The digests were analyzed by capillary LC-MS using the same instrument arrangement as above. In this case, a 300-μm inner diameter × 150-mm Hypersil C18 (3-μm particle size) capillary column was used (Keystone Scientific Inc., Bellefonte, PA). This column was fitted with slip-free fittings, which allowed direct attachment to the exit port of the injector. Tryptic peptides were resolved using a gradient of aqueous isopropyl alcohol, 0.5% glacial acetic acid (2-10% in 2 min, 10-80% in 28 min) at 6 μl/min. The column eluate was fed directly to the electrospray ionization source, which was operated under the same conditions as described above. Full scan mass spectra (m/z 300-2000) were acquired in centroid mode using Q3 as the mass analyzer. For tandem mass spectrometric analysis of tryptic peptides, the digests were first resolved by capillary LC-MS as described above. Fragmentation of the selected precursor ions was achieved by collisional activation with argon in the RF-only quadrupole (Q2). The collision gas pressure was 3.0 millitorr, and the collision energy was 75 V (laboratory frame of reference). The fragment ion spectra were acquired in profile mode at an acquisition rate of 3.5 s/scan. When assaying inhibition of PTPs by vanadate or pervanadate, the choice of assay conditions is very important because vanadate is known to interact with many buffer salts and organic compounds. Since HEPES is one of the few buffers that does not complex with vanadate (34Crans D.C. Bunch R.L. Theisen L.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 7597-7607Google Scholar, 35Crans D.C. Comments Inorg. Chem. 1994; 16: 1-33Google Scholar), it was used here. A reducing agent is essential under aerobic conditions to prevent oxidation of the catalytic Cys residue, which would inactivate the enzyme. DTT was chosen for these studies, and while it is known that DTT does complex with vanadate, these complexes are binuclear in vanadium and are not formed to a significant extent at the vanadium concentrations used in this study. 3A. Tracey, personal communication. A small amount of bovine serum albumin was also included as a carrier protein, and while bovine serum albumin will complex with vanadate, the formation constant is ∼1 × 103M–1 (34Crans D.C. Bunch R.L. Theisen L.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 7597-7607Google Scholar), making the amount of complexation negligible at these concentrations. EDTA is commonly included in PTP assays; however, it is known to form a complex with vanadate (32Przyborowski L. Schwarzenbach G. Zimmermann T. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1965; 48: 1556-1565Google Scholar, 33Kustin K. Toppen D.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1973; 95: 3563-3564Google Scholar, 34Crans D.C. Bunch R.L. Theisen L.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 7597-7607Google Scholar, 35Crans D.C. Comments Inorg. Chem. 1994; 16: 1-33Google Scholar), with a Keff at pH 8.0 of 1.4 × 104M–1 (34Crans D.C. Bunch R.L. Theisen L.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 7597-7607Google Scholar), and it was thus excluded here. In a side-by-side comparison of vanadate and pervanadate inhibition, the order of the addition of enzyme and inhibitor was observed to be very important. When vanadate or pervanadate was added to the assay mixture before initiating the reaction with enzyme, no difference in inhibition was observed (Fig. 1A), with 500 nM vanadate or pervanadate causing approximately 50% inhibition. Furthermore, the inhibition by both was completely reversible upon the addition of EDTA to the assay (Fig. 1A) or by dilution (data not shown). When vanadate or pervanadate was added to the assay mixture after the enzyme, clear differences between the two were observed (Fig. 1B). The extent of inhibition due to vanadate was the same as in Fig. 1A, while for pervanadate a greater amount of inhibition was observed, and it was only partially reversible with EDTA. Vanadate is generally considered as a phosphate analog, since it can adopt a similar structure to inorganic phosphate (Fig. 2) as well as a five-coordinate trigonal bipyramidal structure that resembles the transition state of many phosphoryl transfer reactions (15Gresser M.J. Tracey A.S. Chasteen N.D. Vanadium in Biological Systems. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Netherlands1990: 63-79Google Scholar). The x-ray crystal structure of the Yersinia PTP complexed with vanadate shows that the vanadium molecule occupies the active site within covalent distance of the thiol of the catalytic Cys residue, forming a thiol-vanadyl ester linkage that resembles the covalent thiol-phosphate linkage formed during catalysis (37Denu J.M. Lohse D.L. Vijayalakshmi J. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2493-2498Google Scholar). These data suggest that vanadate is a competitive inhibitor of PTPs. A Lineweaver-Burk analysis of vanadate inhibition was carried out (Fig. 3), and the pattern of inhibition corresponds to that expected for competitive inhibition, with a calculated Ki of 0.38 ±; 0.02 μM. The calculated Km and kcat for PTP1B of 21.7 ±; 1.1 μM and 4.85 ±; 0.07 s–1, respectively, are in good agreement with previously determined values.2Fig. 3Lineweaver-Burk analysis of vanadate inhibition. PTP1B (400 ng/ml final assay concentration) was assayed in the presence of the indicated vanadate concentrations while varying the FDP concentration, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Catalase (10 μg/ml) was included in the assay buffer as a precaution against the in situ formation of pervanadate (see “Results”). All of the data points were fit simultaneously to the Lineweaver-Burk equation for competitive inhibition using the program GraFit. The values reported under “Results” for Km, kcat, and Ki were calculated from a nonlinear fit of the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation for competitive inhibition using the same program.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) From Fig. 1B, it is apparent that pervanadate is inhibiting PTP1B by a different mechanism than vanadate. When pervanadate is added to the enzyme assay last, the inhibition is only partially reversible with EDTA (Fig. 1B) or by dilution (data not shown), and the amount of irreversible inhibition increases with increasing pervanadate. The fact that no difference was observed between vanadate and pervanadate when the two are added to the assay mixture before enzyme suggested that perhaps the pervanadate is being converted to vanadate. In fact, if pervanadate is preincubated in DTT alone before addition to the PTP assay solution, it behaves exactly like vanadate (data not shown), consistent with pervanadate being converted to vanadate by the presence of excess DTT; this was confirmed by NMR studies.3 However, when pervanadate is added to the assay solution after enzyme, there is a portion of the inhibition that cannot be reversed with EDTA or by dilution, suggesting that the pervanadate is modifying or inactivating PTP1B before it is converted to vanadate by the DTT. Vanadium peroxide complexes are known to be potent oxidizing agents (38Butler A. Clague M.J. Meister G.E. Chem. Rev. 1994; 94: 625-638Google Scholar), and the irreversible inhibition described above would be consistent with oxidation of the enzyme. In fact, Shaver et al. (39Shaver A. Ng J.B. Hall D.A. Soo Lum B. Posner B.I. Inorg. Chem. 1993; 32: 3109-3113Google Scholar) have speculated that peroxovanadium compounds may be inhibiting PTPs by oxidizing the catalytic Cys residue. There are four oxidation states of cysteine that can be generated: disulfide (-S-S-), sulfenic acid (-SOH), sulfinic acid (-SO2H), and sulfonic (or cysteic) acid (-SO3H). Failure of DTT (or other reducing agents; data not shown) to reactivate the pervanadate-inactivated enzyme is consistent with one of the higher oxidation states. The latter three oxidations would result in a change in mass of PTP1B that could be measured by mass spectrometry. To test for this, PTP1B was incubated on ice for 15 min with an approximately 5-fold molar excess of catalase-treated pervanadate, after which DTT was added to a final concentration of 10 mM to destroy the remaining pervanadate. Under these conditions essentially all of the enzyme was inactivated, as determined by assaying the enzyme with FDP and comparing with a control incubation of PTP1B without pervanadate. The deconvoluted mass spectrum obtained for the control protein by capillary LC-MS (Fig. 4A, inset) demonstrated that this sample consists primarily of a protein with a mass of 39,024 ±; 1.3 Da. The reconstructed molecular weight profile of the pervanadate-treated protein (Fig. 4B, inset) indicated that the mass of the protein had increased by 47 Da, to 39,071 ±; 0.6 Da. This could correspond to the addition of three oxygen atoms to the protein. As further controls, PTP1B was also incubated under the same conditions with the same concentrations of either vanadate or hydrogen peroxide used in the preparation of the pervanadate, resulting in no loss of activity in either case (data not shown). Thus, the inactivation of PTP1B by pervanadate and the corresponding increase in mass is clearly not due to the presence of vanadate or free hydrogen peroxide. Further examination of the trypsin-digested enzymes by capillary LC-MS indicated that the mass of the tryptic peptide containing the active-site cysteine (ESGSLSPEHGPVVVHC-SAGIGR; mass = 2174.1 Da) had increased by 48 mass units after pervanadate treatment relative to the native digest (data not shown). In several replicate control digests, no modified active-site peptides were observed. Other Cys- and Met-containing peptides in the pervanadate-treated PTP1B tryptic digest were examined, and none was found to be modified. The predicted mass of FLAG-PTP1B from the sequence is 38,713.8, which is ∼310 mass units less than the MS mass. Peptides corresponding to the entire protein sequence could be identified in the native tryptic digest, except for the extreme C-terminal 28 residues. Perhaps some post-translational modification on this portion of the enzyme gives rise to the increased mass, a hypothesis currently under investigation. The active-site-containing peptide (in both native and modified form) was observed principally as a triply protonated ion. The MS/MS spectrum of the triply protonated modified active-site peptide (Fig. 5B) is dominated by a series of singly and doubly charged Y ions (fragment ions containing the C-terminal residue) (40Biemann K. Biomed. Environ. Mass Spectrom. 1988; 16: 99-111Google Scholar, 41Biemann K. Burlingame A. McCloskey J. Biological Mass Spectrometry. Elsevier, Amsterdam1990: 179-196Google Scholar). Although the ion intensity of the singly charged Y ions decreases with increasing mass, it is evident that the extra 48 mass units were added to the Cys residue, confirming that the catalytic Cys is oxidized to the cysteic acid. Interestingly, the Y fragment ions are not as prominent in the MS/MS spectrum of the unoxidized active-site peptide (Fig. 5A), but they do confirm that the cysteine residue is not oxidized. A similar phenomenon was observed by Burlet et al. (42Burlet O. Yang C.-Y. Gaskell S.J. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1992; 3: 337-344Google Scholar, 43Burlet O. Yang C.-Y. Guyton J.R. Gaskell S.J. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1995; 6: 242-247Google Scholar) in the fast atom bombardment-MS/MS spectra of peptides containing a cysteic acid close to a C-terminal arginine. They attributed this phenomenon to a gas phase interaction between these two residues leading to delocalization of the site of protonation and thus an increased yield of Y series ions. The irreversible inhibition observed when pervanadate was added to the enzyme assay last (after PTP1B) is consistent with the oxidation of the catalytic Cys residue by pervanadate. Time-dependent inhibition is normally anticipated in the case of an irreversible inactivator; however, pervanadate has a short half-life in the DTT-containing buffer. Upon the addition of pervanadate, then, there are at least two competing reactions going on: conversion of pervanadate to vanadate by DTT, and oxidation of the catalytic Cys by pervanadate. Thus, once the pervanadate is destroyed by the DTT (which appears to occur too quickly to be measured on our kinetic time scale), there is no inhibitor available for any further inactivation. Increasing the concentration of DTT in the enzyme assay was predicted to decrease the amount of inhibition observed upon the addition of pervanadate to the enzyme assay by favoring the reaction of pervanadate with DTT over that with the enzyme; this was in fact observed (Fig. 6). Similar results were observed with the reducing agents β-mercaptoethanol and reduced glutathione (data not shown), indicating that this effect is not exclusive to DTT. The assay mixtures in Fig. 6 contained EDTA to chelate vanadate and catalase to consume hydrogen peroxide, ensuring that the observed inhibition was due exclusively to inactivation by pervanadate. The overall reaction scheme proposed for the inhibition by vanadate and pervanadate and the effects of the thiol reductant on pervanadate and EDTA on vanadate is outlined in Fig. 7. Since similar inhibition kinetics for vanadate and pervanadate were observed with the PTP CD45 (data not shown), this scheme may be applicable to PTPs in general. A pathway by which pervanadate can reform in the assay reaction is also shown in Fig. 7. Under certain assay conditions (e.g. when imidazole buffer was used for the enzyme assays), a slow time-dependent inactivation of the enzyme that increased with increasing vanadate concentration was observed (data not shown). It is known that DTT autoxidation is catalyzed by transition metals, and superoxide is formed upon the reduction of O2 by a DTT thiol radical or by the reduced transition metal; the superoxide can then disproportionate to hydrogen peroxide and O2 (44Trotta P.P. Pinkus L.M. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 1915-1921Google Scholar, 45Misra H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 2151-2155Google Scholar, 46Costa M. Pecci L. Pensa B. Cannella C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 78: 596-603Google Scholar). Hence, the slow inactivation observed with vanadate is consistent with the generation of pervanadate in situ through the complexation of hydrogen peroxide with vanadate and the subsequent oxidation of the catalytic Cys of the enzyme. The time-dependent inhibition was blocked by catalase and stimulated by superoxide dismutase and Cu2+ (data not shown), supporting the mechanism in Fig. 7. Hydrogen peroxide itself is a much poorer inhibitor than pervanadate, since concentrations ≫100 μM were required for inhibition in our standard conditions (data not shown). However, the presence of vanadate in the enzyme assay greatly potentiates the effect of hydrogen peroxide (data not shown), consistent with the in situ formation of pervanadate as described above. It is important to note that pervanadate is a mixture of several different complexes of vanadate with hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 2). At the concentrations of vanadate and hydrogen peroxide used here, the predominant species are monoperoxovanadate (VL) and diperoxovanadate (VL2), as calculated from the equilibrium constants determined by Jaswal and Tracey (31Jaswal J.S. Tracey A.S. Inorg. Chem. 1991; 30: 3718-3722Google Scholar). The literature equilibrium constants were obtained in 1.0 M ionic strength maintained with KCl, so the actual values here may be different but should follow the same trend. In order to determine the species active in oxidizing the enzyme, pervanadate solutions were prepared with different ratios of VL and VL2 but a constant amount of VL + VL2 (Table I"

We have discovered that hypoxia increases expression of the COX-2 gene in human vascular endothelial cells in culture independent of other stimuli. Western analysis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) revealed a greater than 4-fold induction of protein by hypoxia (1% O2). The steady-state level of COX-2 mRNA was correspondingly elevated by both Northern blot and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays with antibody supershifting, we also found that hypoxia causes increased binding of NF-κB p65 (Rel A) to the one out of the two NF-κB consensus elements in the COX-2 promoter which is closest to the transcription start site of the COX-2 gene. Transfection of an immortalized human microvascular endothelial cell line (HMEC-1) with mutation reporter gene constructs and HUVEC with both mutation and deletion reporter gene constructs suggested that transcription of the COX-2 gene was enhanced by hypoxia. In transcription factor decoy experiments, hypoxic HUVEC were exposed in culture to 20 μM of the same NF-κB element found to bind NF-κB protein. The wild type transcription factor decoy prevented hypoxic induction of COX-2, presumably by binding with cytoplasmic p65; however, mutated or scrambled oligonucleotides did not prevent the increase in COX-2 protein expression by hypoxia. Thus, the intracellular signaling mechanism that leads to induction of COX-2 by hypoxia includes binding of p65 to the relatively 3′ NF-κB consensus element in the COX-2 upstream promoter region in human vascular endothelial cells.

Reports on the mechanism of TNF-α action have been somewhat contradictory. GLUT4 down-regulation has been implicated as a possible cause of insulin resistance as has been the reduced kinase function of the insulin receptor. Here we examine the effects of tumor necrosis factor on the protein components thought to be involved in insulin-stimulated glucose transport in adipocytes, namely the insulin receptor, its major substrate IRS-1, and the insulin responsive glucose transporter GLUT4. Prolonged exposure (72-96 h) of 3T3-L1 adipocytes to TNF-α causes a substantial reduction (>80%) in IRS-1 and GLUT4 mRNA and protein as well as a lesser reduction (>50%) in the amount of the insulin receptor. Nevertheless, the remaining proteins appear to be biochemically indistinguishable from those in untreated adipocytes. Both the insulin receptor and IRS-1 are tyrosine-phosphorylated to the same extent in response to acute insulin stimulation following cellular TNF-α exposure. Furthermore, the ability of the insulin receptor to phosphorylate exogenous substrate in the test tube is also normal following its isolation from TNF-α-treated cells. These results are confirmed by the reduced but obvious level of insulin-dependent glucose transport and GLUT4 translocation observed in TNF-α-treated adipocytes. We conclude that the insulin resistance of glucose transport in 3T3-L1 adipocytes exposed to TNF-α for 72-96 h results from a reduced amount in requisite proteins involved in insulin action. These results are consistent with earlier studies indicating that TNF-α reduces the transcriptional activity of the GLUT4 gene in murine adipocytes, and reduced mRNA transcription of a number of relevant genes may be the general mechanism by which TNF-α causes insulin resistance in adipocytes.

https://openalex.org/W2027743257,"Dentin is the major mineralized extracellular matrix of the tooth. The organic components of dentin consist of type I collagen (90%) with 10% noncollagenous proteins, which are also components of bone. Two dentin proteins, dentin sialoprotein and dentin phosphoprotein, have been shown to be tooth-specific being expressed mostly by odontoblast cells. In this study, we screened a mouse molar tooth library for dentin sialoprotein and dentin phosphoprotein cDNA clones. Analysis of the clones resulted in characterization of a 4420-nucleotide cDNA that contained a 940-amino acid open reading frame. The signal peptide and NH2-terminal sequence was 75% homologous to the cDNA sequence of rat dentin sialoprotein. The continued open reading frame, however, contained a RGD sequence followed by a region of repeated aspartic acid and serine residues. This portion of the protein codes for amino acid sequence consistent with that of dentin phosphoprotein. The noncoding region contains three potential polyadenylation signals, two of which were shown to be utilized. Northern blot analysis indicated the presence of two major transcripts of 4.4 and 2.2 kilobases in odontoblasts. Chromosomal mapping localized the gene to human chromosome 4. These data suggest that the previously identified dentin extracellular matrix proteins, dentin sialoprotein and dentin phosphoprotein, are expressed as a single cDNA transcript coding for a protein that is specifically cleaved into two smaller polypeptides with unique physical-chemical characteristics. Therefore, we propose that the gene be named dentin sialophosphoprotein.

During tooth formation instructive epithelial-mesenchymal interactions result in the cytodifferentiation of ectomesenchymal cells that line the dental pulp chamber into highly specialized cells termed odontoblasts. A consequence of odontoblast cytodifferentiation is the expression of specific genes products that form the dentin extracellular matrix (DECM). 1The abbreviations used are: DECMdentin extracellular matrixBSPbone sialoproteinDMP1dentin matrix protein 1DPPdentin phosphoproteinDSPdentin sialoproteinDSPPdentin sailophosphoproteinOPNosteopontinPCRpolymerase chain reactionSSPsingle specific primerbpbase pair(s)kbkilobase(s)Pipes1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. The inorganic components of dentin consist of mostly hydroxyapatite (70% by weight) with the remaining 12% composed of water. The organic components of dentin consist of mostly type I (approximately 86%), type I trimer, type III, type V, and type VI collagens, and several noncollagenous proteins. The noncollagenous DECM proteins include those proteins found in bone ECM, such as osteonectin, osteocalcin, osteopontin (OPN, also known as SSP1), bone sialoprotein (BSP), and dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1) (1Linde A.

DSP is a 95-kDa glycoprotein identified first within the DECM (7Ritchie H.H. Pinero G.J. Hou H. Butler W.T Connect. Tissue Res. 1995; 33 ([395-401]): 73-79Google Scholar) and further characterized by cDNA cloning (3Ritchie H. Hou H. Veis A. Butler W.T J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3698-3702Google Scholar) from a rat tooth library. This protein accounts for 5-8% of the DECM and has a high carbohydrate (30%) and sialic acid (10%) content. This protein has an overall resemblance to other sialoproteins like BSP and shares limited NH2-terminal sequence homology with other acidic phosphoproteins OPN, DMP1, and bone acidic glycoprotein-75. In situ hybridization studies have shown DSP expression to be tooth-specific confined to differentiating odontoblasts, with transient expression in presecretory ameloblasts (4Butler W.T. Bhown M. D'Souza R.N. Farach-Carson M.C. Happonen R.P. Schrohenloher R.E. Seyer J.M. Somerman M.J. Foster R.A. Tomana M. VanDijk Matrix. 1992; 12: 343-351Google Scholar). DPP is the major noncollagenous DECM protein, representing as much as 50% of this fraction. DPP is strongly associated with the mineral phase of dentin, being soluble only after demineralization of the extracellular matrix. In vivo (8Weinstock M. Leblond C.P. J. Cell Biol. 1973; 56: 838-845Google Scholar) and in vitro (9Dimuzio M.T. Veis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 6845-6852Google Scholar, 10Munksgaard E.C. Richardson W.S. Butler W.T. Arch. Oral Biol. 1978; 23: 583-585Google Scholar) studies have demonstrated that DPP is synthesized by odontoblasts that form a single sheet of cells lining the dental papilla mesenchyme. Immunolocalization studies have shown DPP to be confined to the mineralized dentin layer of the DECM (5MacDougall M. Zeichner-David M Slavkin H.C. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 493-500Google Scholar, 8Weinstock M. Leblond C.P. J. Cell Biol. 1973; 56: 838-845Google Scholar), being secreted through the odontoblast cell process at the mineralization front (5MacDougall M. Zeichner-David M Slavkin H.C. Biochem.

DPPs from several species have been characterized; although differences in the number and molecular weight size of these phosphoproteins have been reported, all share several unique physical-chemical characteristics. These properties include the following: aspartic acid and serine comprise approximately 70-80% of the total amino acid residues (12Linde, A., (ed) (1984) Dentin and Dentinogenesis, Vol. 2, pp. 55–92, CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL.Google Scholar); a high degree of phosphorylation (400/1000 residues phosphate or greater), usually as phosphoserine residues (13Linde A. Bhown M. Butler W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5931-5942Google Scholar, 14Richardson W.S. Munksgaard E.C. Butler W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 8042-8046Google Scholar); extreme anionic character (15Veis A. Perry A. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 2409-2416Google Scholar), with the reported isoelectric point for rat of 1.1 (16Jonsson M.S. Fredriksson S. Jontell M. Linde A. J. Chromatogr. 1978; 157: 235-242Google Scholar); and a strong affinity for calcium ions (17Lee S.L. Veis A. Glonek T. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2971-2979Google Scholar, 18Zanetti M. de Bernard B. Jontell M. Linde A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 113: 541-545Google Scholar) being preferentially precipitated by this ion (19Kuboki Y. Fujisawa R. Aoyama K. Saski S. J. Dent. Res. 1979; 58: 1926-1932Google Scholar). Although the biological function of DPP is not known, physicochemical properties suggest a function in the biomineralization of the dentin extracellular matrix. Most theories have centered on DPP acting as a nucleator or modulator of hydroxyapatite crystal formation (1Linde A. Goldberg M. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1993; 4: 679-728Google Scholar). Studies in rat have suggested the DECM may contain multiple forms of the DPPs (20Butler W.T. Bhown M. MiMuzio M.T. Cothran W.C. Linde A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 255: 178-186Google Scholar). These may represent classes or families of phosphoproteins that differ in their content of phosphoserine and primary amino acid sequences, or they are alternatively spliced DPP gene products. Currently the exact number of DPPs is not known, nor has the primary amino acid sequence been determined by cDNA cloning. The purpose of this study was to identify the cDNAs for mouse DPP and DSP by screening a molar cDNA library in order to facilitate investigations related to the regulation of odontoblast cytodifferentiation and matrix-mediated biomineralization. Synthetic oligonucleotide polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primer set was designed to sequence of the rat DSP cDNA. Limited polypeptide NH2-terminal sequence of mouse (21Butler W.T. Connect. Tissue Res. 1995; 33 ([381-387]): 59-65Google Scholar), bovine (22Sabsay B. Stetler-Stevenson W. Lechner J. Veis A. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 699-707Google Scholar, 23Evans J.S. Chan S.

Res. 1996; 75: 154Google Scholar) DPPs were used to generate degenerative oligonucleotide probes for library screening. After initial primary and secondary screenings, it was determined that some of the individually identified clones hybridized with both DPP- and DSP-specific primer sets or probes. Analysis of these clones resulted in characterization of a full-length mouse cDNA with a large single open reading frame containing coding information for both DSP and DPP. In this study, we report the full-length sequence of this primary transcript, complete amino acid sequence of DPP for the first time, the utilization of alternative polyadenylation signals, and chromosomal mapping of this tooth-specific gene that we have designated dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP). Newborn (day 19) Swiss Webster mice first and second mandibular and maxillary molars were dissected and frozen immediately on dry ice. Poly(A+) RNA was extracted from the molars using the FastTrack mRNA Isolation Kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). A total of 5 μl of mRNA was converted to cDNA with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase using ZAP-cDNA Synthesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the supplier's instructions. The cDNA was size fractionated using Sephacryl S-400 columns. First and second strand synthesis cDNA was analyzed on alkaline agarose gels to determine the size range and presence of any 2† structure. The double stranded DNA was polished and filled in with Klenow, and EcoRI adaptors were ligated to the blunt ends. Digestion with XhoI allowed insertion into the vector in a sense orientation (EcoRI-XhoI) with respect to the lacZ promoter. The Uni-Zap vector was double digested with EcoRI and XhoI, and after ligation of cDNA into the vector arms, aliquots were packaged into Gigapack II Gold packaging extract (Stratagene) according to the packaging instructions. A previously described rat incisor cDNA library (25Matsuki Y. Nakashima M. Amizuka N. Warshawsky H. Goltzman D. Yamada K.M. Yamada Y. J. Dent. Res. 1995; 74: 307-312Google Scholar) constructed in lambda Zap II vector was screened with the full-length mouse DSPP cDNA. After secondary screen the clones inserts were sized by restriction enzyme digestion using Xho and Xba. Specific DSP and degenerative DPP oligonucleotide primers were constructed by the DNA Core Laboratory (University of Texas Health Science Center). Table I gives the sequence of all degenerative oligonucleotide primers used to initially screen for DPP constructed against rat, mouse, and bovine DPP sequences. Because the codon usage was not known initially, we constructed degenerative primers that contain all the possible codons. In the case of sequences containing serines residues, we elected to use an inosine in the third nucleotide position to decrease the total number of possibilities. All generated oligonucleotide sequence data were analyzed using PCR Primer Selection program (Epicenter Software, Pasadena, CA) to check for secondary structure, self-annealing, and primer dimer formation.Table I.DPP amino acid sequence for oligonucleotide probe constructionSpeciesAmino acid sequenceaUnderline indicates sequence used to construct the oligonucleotide.Oligonucleotide (5‘-3‘)Mouse45 kDabMacDougall et al.

A 2-μl aliquot of the molar library was used for PCR amplification with the following program: 94†C for 2 min followed by 94†C for 1 min, 58†C for 1 min, and 72†C for 1 min for 30 cycles and a final extension at 72†C for 2 min. The PCR reaction resulted in a single DNA product of 421 bp. The actin primer sequences resulted in a 248-bp product and were as follows: sense, 5'-CATCGTGGGCCGCTCTAGGCACCA-3' and antisense, 5'-CGGTTGGCCTTAGGGTTCAGGGGG-3'. The annealing temperature of these primers was 55†C, and the PCR amplification was performed for 30 cycles. DNA generated by these specific PCR amplification reactions was labeled to produce high specific activity probes by random oligonucleotide priming using the Prime-It RmT Random Primer Labeling Kit (Stratagene). Oligonucleotide probes were 3' end-labeled with [32P]ATP by using terminal transferase (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Probes were purified from unincorporated nucleotides by purification on NucTrap columns (Stratagene) according to the supplier's instructions. Aliquots of ammonium acetate precipitated PCR DSP/DSPP amplification products were subcloned into Srf 1-digested pCR-Script SK+ vector (Stratagene) according to the supplier's instructions. DNA was isolated using the ClearCut Miniprep Kit (Stratagene) according to the instructions. The amplified mouse molar library was titered and plated with ∼4 × 104 plaque-forming unit/150-mm plate. The phage were grown overnight at 37†C and transferred to nylon duplicate filters. All filters were denatured by submerging in 1.5 M NaCl and 0.5 M NaOH for 2 min and neutralized in 1.5 M NaCl and 0.5 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, for 5 min by again submerging. Filters are then rinsed in 0.2 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 × SSC for 30 s and blotted on Whatman 3-MM filters. DNA is cross-linked to the filter in a Stratalinker UV cross-linker (Stratagene). Filters were prehybridized in 2 × Pipes containing 50% deionized formamide, 0.5% SDS, 100 mg/ml of sonicated salmon sperm DNA and 10 × Pipes for 2 h at 37†C in a hybridization oven. Hybridization was performed in 2 × Pipes, 50% formamide, 0.5% SDS, 100 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA and 1 × 107 cpm/filter at 42†C overnight. Filters were washed in 0.1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at 50-65†C, blotted on 3-MM paper, wrapped in plastic wrap, placed in a cassette with intensifying screens, and exposed to x-ray film (Biomax MR, Kodak, Rochester, NY) for 1-3 days of exposure at –80†C. “Putative” positive plaques were excised, placed in 1 ml of SM buffer with 20 μl of chloroform, diluted, titered, and plated at 100-250 plaques on a 100-mm NZY plates incubating overnight at 37†C. Lifts were made and treated as previously outlined. After confirmation of insert by DNA sequencing, frozen stocks are prepared and stored at –80†C. The cDNAs were converted from the phage vector into the pBluescript SK– phagemid vector using M13 helper phage according to the Stratagene protocol. Both strands of the mouse DSPP cDNA and mouse subclones were sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method using the Sequenase Version 2.0 sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Rat and human DSPP cDNAs were also sequenced using this method with an internal DSPP primer (DSPP1296-1279, TTTGGGCTATTCCTTTTG) or vector-specific T3 primer, respectively. In addition sequence was determined using automated DNA sequencing (Applied Biosystems, model 370A) at the Human Genome DNA Core Laboratory (University of Texas Health Science Center) or by National Biosystems, Inc. (Plymouth, MN). Protein consensus sequences and DNA self-alignment diagonal matrix plots were determined using the MacVector DNA sequence analysis software (Kodak). Amino acid sequence alignments (rat versus mouse) and the percentage of homology were determined using the GenePro 6.1 software program (Riverside Scientific Enterprises). Amino acid compositions and isoelectric points were calculated using the MacBiospec Software (Perkin-Elmer Sciex Instruments, Thornill, ON, Canada). To investigate the alternative utilization of the three potential polyadenylation signals, we used a novel SSP-PCR strategy (26Shyamala V. Ames G. White B. PCR Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1993: 338-348Google Scholar). PCR amplification was performed using the vector-specific T7 promoter sequence that flanks the 3' cloning site and DSPP-specific primers constructed to regions upstream of the potential polyadenylation signals. The PCR oligonucleotides primers used were as follows: DSPP3537-3553, 5'-TACTAAGTCCCCAACCC-3', and T7, 5'-GTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3'. The PCR reaction was 4 min at 94†C for 1 cycle, 1 min at 94†C, 1 min at 52†C, and 1 min at 72†C for 30 cycles followed by 2 min for 72†C for 1 cycle. PCR amplification products were separated on 2% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. A culture of an established odontoblast cell line MO6G3 (27MacDougall M. Thiemann F. Ta H. Hsu P. Chen L.S. Snead M. Connect. Tissue Res. 1995; 33 ([419-425]): 97-103Google Scholar) was plated at a concentration of 5 × 105 cells/ml in a T-150-mm culture flask and grown at 33†C until confluent as described previously. The mRNA was isolated from the cells as previously outlined. The poly(A+) mRNA was electrophoresed in a 0.8% agarose-formaldehyde gel and transferred to Nytran nylon membrane by 1-h downward alkaline transfer using a TurboBlotter Rapid Downward Transfer System (Schleicher & Schuell) according to the supplier's instructions. After transfer the membrane was UV cross-linked as described previously. RNA blot was prehybridized for 2 h at 68†C in 6 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt's reagent, 0.5% (w/v) SDS, and salmon sperm DNA at 100 μg/ml. Labeled DSPP cDNA probe was generated by random priming as previously outlined, denatured at 100†C for 5 min, cooled, and added to the hybridization buffer. The blot was hybridized for 18 h at 68†C, washed with four changes of 2 × SSC buffer containing 0.1% SDS for 15 min each at room temperature and then washed with two changes of 0.1 × SSC buffer with 0.1% SDS for 15 min at 60†C. The blot was dried and exposed to x-ray film (Biomax MR, Kodak) at –80†C for 2 days. The mouse DPP primer sets were used to screen a human third molar tooth cDNA library constructed in the vector Uni-Zap II vector (Stratagene). Normal extracted third molars from a young (14-year-old male) were used to construct the cDNA library obtained from the University of Texas Health Science Center Oral Surgery Department. The mandibular and maxillary third molars were at late crown formation with open forming roots and frozen immediately on dry ice. Poly(A+) RNA was extracted, and cDNA was synthesized as previously outlined. The library was plated and screened using the 5B2 DSPP cDNA. A positive 1.9-kb cDNA clone was sequenced and shown to contain a partial open reading frame of repetitive aspartic acid and serine residues. This partial human DSPP cDNA clone was used for the chromosomal mapping studies. Samples of genomic DNA (10 μg) isolated from hamster, mouse, and human were cut with four restriction enzymes (EcoRI, HindIII, BamHI, and MspI) in order to determine an informative restriction enzyme that could distinguish the DSPP hybridization signal between the three species. EcoRI was selected allowing discrimination of the mouse, human, and hamster signals. A panel of monochromosomal somatic cell hybrid clones was used for the assignment of the human DMP1 gene locus (BIOS Laboratories, New Haven, CN) prepared with the informative enzyme EcoRI. The filter was placed in a sealable bag and prehybridized for 30 min at 68†C in Quik-Hyb Hybridization Solution (Stratagene). A 1.9-kb human DPP cDNA probe was labeled (≫2 × 109 dpm/μg) using [32P]dCTP and the Prime-It II Random Priming Kit (Stratagene), and the hybridization was performed as described previously. Hybridization signals were detected by exposure to x-ray film (Biomax MR, Kodak) at –80†C for 2 days. In order to isolate the full-length cDNA for the DECM proteins DSP and DPP, we first constructed a cDNA library for Swiss Webster mice newborn molars. We have previously shown that this developmental stage of tooth represents the most active dentinogenesis transcripts of the DECM protein, with minimal activity of the epithelial ameloblast (amelogenesis). The newborn molar library was initially plated and evaluated by 1) screening for an abundant mRNA sequence, actin, known to be present, and 2) screening with a total mixed cDNA probe used to construct the library. A labeled actin probe was generated by using actin-specific primers and adding radioactive dNTPs to the PCR amplification reaction mixture. Hybridization resulted in an estimated frequency of actin cDNA clones of 0.5%, which is within the range reported for other tissues. Hybridization with the total molar cDNA resulted in 87% positive clones, which is well with in the expected value range of 50-95% hybridization for cDNA libraries. In order to establish the presence of the DSP cDNA within the tooth library prior to library screening, an initial PCR amplification was performed. Primers specific for the NH2-terminal coding region of DSP were constructed based on the rat cDNA sequence (3Ritchie H. Hou H. Veis A. Butler W.T J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3698-3702Google Scholar). A 2-μl aliquot of the mouse molar library was used for PCR amplification with the DSP primer set resulting in a single DNA product of ∼400 bp. This DSP amplification product was subcloned, sequenced, and confirmed to code for mouse DSP. This mouse DSP fragment was labeled and used to screen the library for a full-length cDNA. In parallel, the constructed DPP oligoucleotide probes were end-labeled, pooled, and used to screen the library. Initial screening of 4 × 105 recombinants resulted in eight primary clones that were found to hybridize with both DSP- and DPP-specific probes. These clones were rescued to phagemids and cDNA insert size determined by restriction enzyme digestion using EcoRI/XhoI or XbaI/KpnI and T3/T7 PCR amplification. The clone 5B2 was determined to have the largest insert size, and both strands were sequenced. The nucleotide sequence of this mouse cDNA is shown in Fig. 1. The DNA sequence, 4420 base pairs, was found to contain an open reading frame of 940 amino acids starting with a translation start site (ATG) at base 86 that had a –3 adenine nucleotide representative of the Kozak initiation consense sequence. A 17-amino acid leader hydrophobic sequence is present, suggesting targeting for the endoplasmic reticulum and secretion. The stop codon, at base 2905, begins an untranslated region of 1515 nucleotides with three polyadenylation signals (AATAAA) at bases 3602-3607, 3795-3800, and 4384-4389. Northern blot analysis of mRNA isolated from a odontoblast cell line (MO6G3) showed the 5B2 cDNA probe hybridized to two distinct transcripts of 4.4 and 2.2 kb (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Northern blot analysis of the mouse dentin sialophosphoprotein transcripts. Poly(A+) RNA was isolated from mouse odontoblast cell line MO6G3, separated on a denaturing agarose gel, and transferred to a membrane. Labeled mouse DSPP 5B2 cDNA was hybridized in A, and a housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase was hybridized in B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The predicted complete translation product encodes an acidic protein with a calculated molecular weight (Mr) of 92,569 excluding the signal peptide. The signal peptide and NH2-terminal sequence (amino acids 1-387, bases 86-1246) has 75% homology with the published rat “complete” DSP cDNA clone RDSP2 (Fig. 3). The mouse DSP has two small deletions following amino acids 149 (1 amino acid) and 313 (2 amino acid), and an insert of five amino acids beginning at amino acid 338. The last four amino acids of the reported rat DSP cDNA vary between the two species with the mouse clone not containing the reported stop codon (TAA) of the rat sequence in this region. The extended continuous open reading frame of the mouse 5B2 transcript contains an integrin binding Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence at amino acid 479 (base 1520), which is contained in other acidic phosphoproteins of bone and dentin such as BSP, OPN, and DMP1. In addition, the most 3' portion of the open reading frame (amino acids 452-940, 1439-2905 nucleotides) codes for an extended region consisting of aspartic acid and serine residues, as well as sequences with homology to the DPP degenerative oligonucleotide probes used for the library screening. The total 940-amino acid translation product, which we term dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP), is an acidic protein (pI = 4.0), rich in aspartic acid (18.9%) and serine (36.3%) residues (Fig. 4). The portion previously identified as DSP (amino acids 18-387, nucleotides 137-1246) is 370 amino acids with a composition consistent with that published for the rat cDNA sequence and DSP isolated from the DECM (Fig. 4). The portion identified as DPP we begin at base 1439 with NH2-terminal sequence established for rat HP-2 through the stop codon at nucleotide 2905. This portion of the protein codes for 489 amino acids (amino acids 452-940) with a calculated molecular mass of 47.8 kDa and is rich in aspartic acid (28.2%) and serine (57.3%) with a calculated pI of 3.3. The composition of this mouse DPP HP-2 region is nearly identical with the actual amino acid analysis of mouse DPP isolated from the DECM (Fig. 4). Protein sequence analysis revealed 18 N-glycosylation sites based on the conserved sequence NX(S/T), seven are within the DSP coding region, whereas the remaining eleven are in the DPP portion of the transcript. These potential sites are at amino acids 54, 61, 84, 130, 190, 313, 373, 461, 474, 494, 538, 586, 685, 763, 793, 811, 880, and 928. Potential casein kinase I and II phosphorylation sites are present within both the DSP and DPP regions. A total of 41 CK I sites are identified, six within the DSP region all toward the 3‘ end, one within the “linker” region between the DSP and DPP coding regions, and 34 sites with the DPP coding portio"

We have used P-glycoprotein as a model protein to develop strategies to overcome defects in protein kinesis.

Abnormal protein folding or trafficking is associated with a growing number of diseases (1Taubes G Science. 1996; 271: 1493-1495Google Scholar, 2Welch W.J. Brown C.R.

Diseases such as Alzheimer's and prion-related diseases are characterized by the presence of high levels of insoluble protein aggregates in brain tissue. These plaques appear to be aggregates of misfolded β-amyloid protein in Alzheimer's disease or aggregates of misfolded prion protein in the prion-associated diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease or Scrapie (mad cow) (4Prusiner S.B. DeArmond S.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 311-339Google Scholar, 5Selkoe D.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 489-517Google Scholar).

The mutant CFTR protein is misfolded, retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, and rapidly degraded (6Cheng S.H. Gregory R.J. Marshall J. Paul S. Souza D.W. White G.A. O'Riordan C.R. Smith A.E.

Potential therapy for diseases involving folding and/or trafficking defects in the target protein is to prevent misfolding during protein biogenesis. cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. We have used the human multidrug transporter (P-glycoprotein) as a model system for studying ways to prevent protein misfolding. P-glycoprotein appears to be an excellent model system, because we have identified many misprocessed P-glycoprotein mutants. These temperature-sensitive or -insensitive mutant proteins are misfolded, retained in the endoplasmic reticulum as core-glycosylated biosynthetic intermediates in association with molecular chaperones such as calnexin and Hsc70, and rapidly degraded (7Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3143-3149Google Scholar, 8Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28683-28689Google Scholar, 9Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol.

P-glycoprotein, the product of the human MDR1 gene, is an energy-dependent pump located at the plasma membrane that interacts with a wide variety of structurally diverse cytotoxic agents that do not have a common intracellular target (11Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Google Scholar). This protein has clinical importance because it may be one of several mechanisms whereby cancer cells become resistant to chemotherapy. The protein consists of 1280 amino acids organized in two tandem repeats of 610 amino acids, joined by a linker region of 60 amino acids. Each repeat consists of an NH2-terminal hydrophobic domain containing six potential transmembrane sequences followed by a hydrophilic domain containing a nucleotide-binding site. The organization of the domains is characteristic of members of the ABC superfamily of (ATP-binding cassette) transporters, the best known member being CFTR. Our goal was to develop a strategy to specifically rescue the misfolded mutants of P-glycoprotein so that they could exit the endoplasmic reticulum and reach the plasma membrane in a functional form. Nonspecific low molecular weight compounds such as glycerol (12Sato S. Ward C.L. Krouse M.E. Wine J.J. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 635-638Google Scholar, 13Brown C.R. Ly Q.H.-B. Biwersi J. Verkman A.S. Welch W.J. Cell Stress & Chaper. 1996; 1: 117-125Google Scholar) have been shown to nonspecifically affect protein kinesis. Therefore, we wished to determine whether substrates or modulators of P-glycoprotein could act as specific chemical chaperones and have a more rapid effect on processing of misfolded proteins. We show that biosynthesis of the processing mutants in the presence of substrates or modulators of P-glycoprotein results in the relatively rapid appearance of a fully mature and functional transporter at the cell surface. Wild-type and mutant MDR1 cDNAs, modified to encode the epitope for monoclonal antibody A52 at the COOH-terminal ends of the proteins, were inserted into the mammalian expression vector pMT21 as described previously (7Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3143-3149Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was carried out as described previously (7Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3143-3149Google Scholar). For purification purposes wild-type and mutant MDR1 cDNAs were modified to encode for 10 histidine residues at the COOH ends of the proteins (14Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21449-21452Google Scholar). The sequence at the COOH terminus of P-glycoprotein that would normally end as TKRQ became TKRAH10LDPRQ. HEK 293 cells were transfected with the mutant cDNA constructs. After 24 h, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing the desired drug concentration. For purification of P-glycoprotein mutants, HEK 293 cells transfected with the cDNA coding for the histidine-tagged P-glycoproteins were solubilized with 1% (w/v) n-dodecyl-β-D-maltoside, and the mutant P-glycoproteins were purified by nickel-chelate chromatography. Drug-stimulated ATPase activity was determined as described previously (14Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21449-21452Google Scholar). Pulse-chase experiments were done as described previously (8Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28683-28689Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts or purified P-glycoprotein samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, electroblotted onto nitrocellulose, and developed with monoclonal antibody A52 (15Zubrzycka-Gaarn E. MacDonald G. Phillips L. Jorgensen A.O. MacLennan D.H. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1984; 16: 441-446Google Scholar) or with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against P-glycoprotein followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.) as described previously (9Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21839-21844Google Scholar). The effect of substrates and modulators of P-glycoprotein on the biosynthesis of two processing mutants were initially studied; G268V in the NH2-terminal transmembrane domain (16Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7243-7248Google Scholar) and ∆Y490 in the NH2-terminal nucleotide-binding domain (17Hoof T. Demmer A. Hadam M.R. Riordan J.R. Tummler B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20575-20583Google Scholar). Mutant G268V is a temperature-insensitive processing mutant, whereas mutant ∆Y490 contains a deletion at an equivalent position to the ∆F508 mutation in CFTR. The cDNAs coding for these mutant P-glycoproteins were modified to encode for the epitope of monoclonal antibody A52. The presence of the epitope provided us with an important tool for following the synthesis of the misfolded mutants. It allowed us to distinguish the mutant protein from any endogenous P-glycoprotein that may be induced by the presence of drug substrates. These mutants, as well as wild-type enzyme, were expressed transiently in HEK 293 cells and then treated for 24 h with various concentrations of drug substrates. Four structurally different drug substrates or modulators (capsaicin, cyclosporin, verapamil, and vinblastine) of P-glycoprotein were tested. Vinblastine is an antitumor agent that is a substrate of P-glycoprotein, whereas verapamil and cyclosporin A are inhibitors of drug transport. Capsaicin, the pungent ingredient in peppers of the Capsicum family, is a substrate of P-glycoprotein, based on its ability to stimulate ATPase activity (data not shown). All four compounds are hydrophobic and can readily diffuse through the plasma membrane to the site of protein synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum. In the absence of drug substrates (Fig. 1A), the major product of the mutant P-glycoproteins had an apparent mass of 150 kDa compared with 170 kDa for the wild-type enzyme. The 170- and 150-kDa forms of the enzyme represent mature and core-glycosylated biosynthetic intermediate, respectively. In the presence of capsaicin, cyclosporin A, verapamil, or vinblastine, however, the amount of mature enzyme (170 kDa) for both mutants increased in a dose-dependent manner. The ability to “rescue” misprocessed mutants appeared to be independent of the location of the mutation. In addition to the mutants G268V and ∆Y490, we were able to facilitate processing of P-glycoproteins with mutations in the predicted transmembrane segments (TM1, G54V; TM5, G300V; TM7, A718L; and TM9, A841L), in the extracellular loops between transmembrane segments (G854V), in the cytoplasmic loops (G251V and W803A), in the nucleotide-binding domains (G427C and S434C), and in the linker region connecting the two halves of the molecule (E707A) (data not shown). The most potent of the four compounds was cyclosporin A. More than 50% of the mutant protein was present as the mature form of the enzyme in the presence of 2-10 μM of cyclosporin A, 5-20 μM vinblastine, 12.5-50 μM verapamil, or 75-150 μM capsaicin. The highest concentration of capsaicin (300 μM) appeared to be quite toxic to the cells. Except for vinblastine, the cells continued to proliferate in the presence of the various drug substrates. Vinblastine, which is an inhibitor of microtubule assembly, did not cause immediate cell death but resulted in the detachment of the cells from the dish. Other hydrophobic compounds that are not substrates of P-glycoprotein, such as 3-methoxy-tyramine or 3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenethyl amine, had no effect on the processing of the misfolded mutants (data not shown). The effects of drug substrates on folding appear to be specific to P-glycoprotein because the drug substrates of P-glycoprotein could not rescue the temperature-sensitive CFTR ∆F508 processing mutant (Fig. 1B). Restoration of processing of the misfolded mutants appeared to be quite rapid and occurred within a few hours after the addition of drug substrates to the medium. Fig. 2A shows that after 4 h in the presence of 15 μM cyclosporin A, about 50% of mutant G268V was present as the fully mature (170-kDa) form of the enzyme and that after 24 h, more than 80% of the mutant protein was present in the fully mature form. The total amount of P-glycoprotein also increased dramatically in the presence of cyclosporin A. These results suggested that the drug stabilized the mutant protein resulting in decreased turnover. This was confirmed by pulse-chase studies. Fig. 2B shows that in the absence of cyclosporin A, the 150-kDa P-glycoprotein of mutant G268V was not processed to the mature enzyme. The core-glycosylated protein was rapidly degraded (half-life about 2 h), and there was little product remaining after 8 h. In the presence of cyclosporin A, however, the kinetics of maturation of the P-glycoprotein of mutant G268V was similar to that of wild-type enzyme. By 4 h post-labeling, the majority of the 150-kDa protein was processed to the mature enzyme (170 kDa). The processed P-glycoprotein was stable for at least 24 h. Cyclosporin A had no detectable effect on the processing of the wild-type enzyme. Cell surface labeling was performed (8Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28683-28689Google Scholar) to determine whether the mutant proteins reached the plasma membrane. HEK 293 cells were transfected with the histidine-tagged mutant cDNAs and then incubated in the presence or the absence of 15 μM cyclosporin A. The transfected cells were then treated with periodate to convert the carbohydrate moieties to aldehydes, followed by addition of biotin-LC-hydrazide (Pierce). Biotin-LC-hydrazide is a nonpermeable compound that forms covalent attachments to extracellular glycoproteins after periodate oxidation (18Prince L.S. Tousson A. Marchase R.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C491-C498Google Scholar). The histidine tagged P-glycoprotein mutants were then purified by nickel-chelate chromatography and immunoblotted with streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase. Fig. 3 shows that wild-type but not the mutant P-glycoproteins, was present at the cell surface when expression was done without drug substrate. When the transfected cells were incubated in the presence of 15 μM cyclosporin A, however, both mutant proteins were detected at the cell surface. To test if the mutant P-glycoproteins were active when expressed in the presence of drug substrates, we attempted to purify the mutant P-glycoproteins by nickel chelate chromatography for measurement of drug-stimulated ATPase activity. We have previously found that wild-type but not misprocessed P-glycoprotein containing a histidine tag can readily be recovered by nickel-chelate chromatography (10Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15414-15419Google Scholar). Apparently the processing mutants are misfolded, resulting in masking of the histidine tag. We modified the cDNAs of the mutant P-glycoproteins to code for 10 tandem histidine residues at the COOH end of the molecule to facilitate purification by nickel-chelate chromatography (14Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21449-21452Google Scholar). The cDNAs of the mutant P-glycoproteins were transiently expressed in HEK 293 cells and then incubated for 24 h in the presence or the absence of 15 μM cyclosporin A. Histidine-tagged P-glycoprotein was isolated by nickel-chelate chromatography. The majority of the wild-type P-glycoprotein was bound to the nickel column and was eluted with 0.3 M imidazole regardless of whether expression was carried out in the presence or the absence of cyclosporin A. This was determined by loading equivalent amounts of the flow-through and eluted fractions on SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with a polyclonal antibody against P-glycoprotein (data not shown). By contrast, most of the P-glycoprotein of mutants G268V and ∆Y490 grown without drug substrate were recovered in the flow-through fractions during nickel-chelate chromatography. In the presence of 15 μM cyclosporin A, however, the majority of the mutant P-glycoproteins were recovered by nickel-chelate chromatography and had an apparent mass of 170 kDa. Similar results were obtained when the transfected cells were incubated in the presence of capsaicin, verapamil, or vinblastine (data not shown). Drug-stimulated ATPase activity of the wild-type and mutant P-glycoproteins was measured in the presence of verapamil, vinblastine, or colchicine after the addition of lipid. Fig. 4 shows that the purified P-glycoprotein of mutant ∆Y490 after expression in the presence of cyclosporin resulted in a functional molecule that exhibited a similar pattern of drug-stimulated ATPase activity as the wild-type enzyme. Similarly, drug-stimulated ATPase activity was detected in the mutant G268V after expression in the presence of cyclosporin A. The observation that mutant G268V exhibits reduced activity is consistent with previous observations that several glycine to valine mutations in the cytoplasmic loops of P-glycoprotein also alter the substrate specificity of the enzyme (16Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7243-7248Google Scholar). These results show that the presence of drug substrates during biosynthesis of the misfolded proteins results in the appearance of a functional transporter at the cell surface. Drug substrates or modulators of P-glycoprotein appear to be acting as powerful “chaperones” for processing misfolded P-glycoproteins. All misprocessed mutants of P-glycoprotein that we have tested could be converted to the fully mature form of the enzyme, even when the mutations were located in different domains of the molecule. The effects of these substrates or modulators were also independent of the cell lines because the misfolded mutants could be rescued when expressed either transiently in HEK 293 cells (this study) or stably in NIH 3T3 cells (data not shown). The ability of drug substrates to facilitate folding appears to be specific for P-glycoprotein because these substrates were ineffective on the CFTR mutant (∆F508). Reversal of the misfolding phenotype of the ∆F508 CFTR mutant can be accomplished by incubation at lower temperatures (19Denning G.M. Anderson M.P. Amara J.F. Marshall J. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Nature. 1992; 358: 761-764Google Scholar) or by exposure to nonspecific low molecular weight compounds such as glycerol (12Sato S. Ward C.L. Krouse M.E. Wine J.J. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 635-638Google Scholar, 13Brown C.R. Ly Q.H.-B. Biwersi J. Verkman A.S. Welch W.J. Cell Stress & Chaper. 1996; 1: 117-125Google Scholar), trimethylamine N-oxide, or deuterated water (13Brown C.R. Ly Q.H.-B. Biwersi J. Verkman A.S. Welch W.J. Cell Stress & Chaper. 1996; 1: 117-125Google Scholar). In our hands, the effectiveness of glycerol treatment or lowering the growth temperature to facilitate processing was cell line-dependent. For example, some misfolded P-glycoprotein mutants such as G714A are temperature- and glycerol-sensitive only when stably expressed in NIH 3T3 cells but not when expressed in HEK 293 cells (data not shown). In addition, maturation of the misfolded P-glycoproteins in the presence of glycerol or by lowering the incubation temperatures is a slow process that usually requires 24-72 h. By contrast, the appearance of the mature form of any of the misprocessed mutants of P-glycoprotein occurs within 2-4 h after addition of any drug substrate (Fig. 2). Another interesting observation is that misfolded mutants that are temperature- and glycerol-insensitive, such as G251V, G268V, and E707A could also be rescued by these drug substrates when expressed in either HEK 293 or NIH 3T3 cells (data not shown). The exact mechanism of how these specific drug substrates or modulators facilitate processing of misfolded P-glycoproteins mutants is not known. A possible explanation is that the drug-binding sites(s) in P-glycoprotein are formed early in the folding intermediates during biosynthesis. Occupation of the drug-binding site(s) stabilized the folding intermediates in a “near native” conformation, thus escaping the cell's quality control mechanism (Fig. 2B). Recently, Qu and Thomas (20Qu B.-H. Thomas P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7261-7264Google Scholar) studied the effects of the CFTR ∆F508 on the thermodynamic stability and folding yield of the nucleotide-binding domain 1 and concluded that the major deleterious effect of the mutation was to allow accumulation of a folding intermediate that was prone to self-association. The ∆F508 mutation had little effect on the thermodynamic stability of the folded nucleotide-binding domain 1. The mutation also did not appear to enhance in vivo proteolysis because inhibition of proteasomes (21Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Google Scholar, 22Jensen T.J. Loo M.A. Pind S. Williams D.B. Goldberg A.L. Riordan J.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 129-135Google Scholar) did not enhance the efficiency of maturation of the full-length ∆F508 CFTR. These results suggest that mutations that cause misprocessing slow one or more folding steps, resulting in an increased concentration of the intermediate that is prone to self-aggregation. Therefore, in P-glycoprotein, it is possible that the occupation of the drug-binding site(s) in the early stages of folding may reduce the concentration of the intermediate that is prone to self-aggregation. In summary, the results of this study demonstrate that a potential strategy in the treatment of diseases involving trafficking/misfolding of proteins would be to identify specific synthetic and natural substrates or modulators and to include these during biosynthesis.

MtK379 has a low affinity (5 × 104M–1) and a high affinity (5 × 106M–1) binding site for mant ADP while MtK332 has a single low affinity site (5 × 104M–1). Rate constants of dissociation of mant ADP are <1 s–1 for the high affinity site and 75-100 s–1 for the low affinity site for MtK379. For MtK332, the effective rate constant is 200-300 s–1. It is proposed that the two heads of the dimer are different through the interaction with the microtubule, a strongly bound head with low affinity for 2'-(3')-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl) adenosine 5'-diphosphate (mant ADP), similar to the single strongly bound head of the monomer and a weakly bound or detached head with high affinity for mant ADP. Rate of binding of mant ADP gave an “S“-shaped dependence on concentration for MtK379 and a hyperbolic dependence for MtK332. Binding of K379·mant ADP dimer to microtubules releases only one mant ADP at a rate of 50 s–1. The second strongly bound mant ADP is released by binding of nucleotides to the other head. Rates are 100 s–1 for ATP, 30 s–1 for AMPPNP or ATPγS, and 2 s–1 for ADP. The rate of binding of mant ATP to MtK379 showed an “S“-shaped concentration dependence and limiting rate at zero concentration is <1 s–1 while MtK332 gave a hyperbolic dependence and limiting rate of 100 s–1. The limiting rate is determined by the rate of dissociation of mant ADP in the hydrolysis cycle. The evidence is consistent with an interacting site model in which binding of ATP to one head is required for release of ADP from the other head in the hydrolysis cycle. This model, in which the cycles are maintained partly out of phase, is an extension of the alternating site model of Hackney (Hackney, D. D. (1994) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 91, 6865-6869).

It provides a basis for a processive mechanism. Kinesin is a processive motor which can travel a distance of micrometers before dissociating from the microtubule (1Block S.M. Goldstein L.S. Schnapp B.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 349-352Google Scholar, 2Vale R.D. Funatsu T. Pierce D.W. Romberg L. Harada Y. Yanagida T. Nature. 1996; 380: 451-453Google Scholar). An average step of 8 nm for each ATPase cycle requires 60 cycles before dissociation and a rate constant of dissociation of less than 0.3 s–1 in order to move 1 μm at a velocity of 0.5 μm s–1. The motor must also satisfy the conflicting requirement that a single head detaches and reattaches with rate constant greater than the cycle rate of 50 s–1 to couple movement steps to the ATPase cycle. To meet these requirements, it is likely that there is an interaction between heads, mediated by the constraints of binding to neighboring microtubule sites, which introduces a phase relation between the ATPase cycles of the two heads. An interaction between heads was not found in a comparison of monomeric and dimeric kinesin constructs in the absence of microtubules (3Ma Y.-Z. Taylor E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 717-723Google Scholar, 4Ma Y.Z. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13233-13241Google Scholar). Hackney (5Hackney D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6865-6869Google Scholar) showed that an interaction occurs for the dissociation of ADP since binding of a kinesin-ADP dimer to microtubules leads to the rapid dissociation of ADP from only one head of the dimer. On this basis, an alternating cycle mechanism was proposed for microtubule kinesin ATPase. Previous kinetic studies of the microtubule kinesin dimer ATPase (6Gilbert S.P. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1951-1960Google Scholar, 7Ma Y.Z. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13242-13251Google Scholar, 8Gilbert S.P. Webb M.R. Brune M. Johnson K.A. Nature. 1995; 373: 671-676Google Scholar) have been analyzed by treating the heads as essentially identical and independent except for the dissociation of the dimer which requires the detachment of both heads. Although the kinetic scheme has been used to describe possible motility mechanisms, the interaction between the heads is an essential property of the system, and it is necessary to develop a mechanism which takes head interactions into account. In this work, the kinetic schemes of monomeric kinesin K332 1The abbreviations used are: K332, K379, and K560kinesin constructs of 332, 379, and 560 amino acid residuesAMPPNP5'-adenylyl β,γ-imidodiphosphatemant ATP and mant ADP2'-(3')-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl) adenosine 5'-triphosphate and -diphosphate, respectively3‘-deoxy,2‘-mant ATP2'-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl),3'-deoxyadenosine 5'-triphosphateATPγSadenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate)PIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidMtmicrotubule. (3Ma Y.-Z. Taylor E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 717-723Google Scholar) and dimeric kinesin K379 (7Ma Y.Z. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13242-13251Google Scholar) are compared to determine which steps in the cycle are affected by interaction between heads. The main difference is that the two heads of the dimer are not equivalent in their interactions with microtubule sites and substrates. Two equilibrium constants for ADP binding and two rate constants for ADP dissociation are observed which are equated with nucleotide binding to kinesin heads that are strongly versus weakly bound to microtubule sites. A mechanism is proposed in which the transition from strong to weak binding (or detachment) of one head is coupled to the transition from weak to strong binding of the other head. The scheme is similar to the alternating site model of Hackney (5Hackney D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6865-6869Google Scholar), but a semiquantitative mechanism is developed based on measurements of the rate constants of the steps in the reaction. A preliminary report of the mant ADP displacement experiments has appeared (9Ma Y.Z. Taylor E.W. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: A28Google Scholar). kinesin constructs of 332, 379, and 560 amino acid residues 5'-adenylyl β,γ-imidodiphosphate 2'-(3')-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl) adenosine 5'-triphosphate and -diphosphate, respectively 2'-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl),3'-deoxyadenosine 5'-triphosphate adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid microtubule. The preparation of K332, K379, microtubules, and the substrates 2'(3')-mant ATP and 2'-mant, 3'-deoxy-ATP have been described (3Ma Y.-Z. Taylor E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 717-723Google Scholar). Apyrase (Sigma, Grade VII) was used to hydrolyze free ADP or mant ADP. Equilibrium measurements of fluorescence were made in a Perkin-Elmer MPF-44A fluorimeter. Kinetic measurements of fluorescence were made in the apparatus described previously (4Ma Y.Z. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13233-13241Google Scholar), and the time course was fitted to one or more exponential terms using the OLIS Kinfit program. Simulations were done using KINSIM. Microtubule concentration is expressed as tubulin dimer concentration. K379 concentration is expressed as site concentration (42-kDa molecular mass). The composition of the standard buffer is 25 mM PIPES, pH 6.9, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, supplemented with NaCl as indicated. Nucleotide stock solutions contained 1:1 MgCl2 to nucleotide. The extent of dissociation of mant ADP on mixing the monomer or dimer complex with microtubules was measured by the fractional decrease in fluorescence enhancement. Free mant ADP was separated from the protein-mant ADP complex by the centrifuge column method (4Ma Y.Z. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13233-13241Google Scholar) before the addition of microtubules. The fluorescence enhancement decreased with microtubule concentration (Fig. 1). The dissociation was complete at 20 μM microtubule concentration for K332. The addition of excess ATP gave no further change in fluorescence. For K379, the decrease in fluorescence reached a plateau at 20 μM microtubules corresponding to approximately one-half of the total change in fluorescence. The addition of ATP to the microtubule-kinesin dimer complex released the remainder of the mant ADP. In the experiments, the K379 site concentration is 2 μM; consequently, the free mant ADP concentration is 1 μM after dissociation of one mant ADP per dimer. This concentration appears to be sufficient to nearly saturate a high affinity ADP binding site. For concentrations of K379 of less than 1 μM, more than half of the mant ADP was released. The rate of dissociation of this strongly bound mant ADP was determined by addition of apyrase (20 units/ml). The fluorescence decreased with a rate constant of 0.12 s–1 (data not shown). The same concentration of apyrase added to a myosin subfragment 1-mant ADP complex at the same bound mant ADP concentration gave a rate constant of 0.5 s–1 for mant ADP dissociation. Therefore, the apyrase concentration is sufficient to track mant ADP release from the MtK379 complex. The rate constant of dissociation of 0.12 s–1, and an apparent second order rate constant for mant ADP binding of 1.5 μM–1 s–1 gives a binding constant of approximately 107M–1 which accounts for the retention of the mant ADP by a high affinity site. The results imply that the binding of mant ADP to the MtK379 dimer should fit two equilibrium constants. This inference was tested by fluorescence titration (Fig. 2). The data for the MtK332 monomer fitted a hyberbola with binding constant of 6 × 104M–1. The enhancement of fluorescence for the MtK379 dimer was much larger than for MtK332 at low mant ADP concentrations. More than half of the maximum enhancement was attained at 2 μM free mant ADP compared to less than 10% of the maximum value for MtK332. The smooth curve was obtained by fitting the data to a model for binding to two independent sites. The calculated equilibrium constants are 5 × 106M–1 and 7 × 104M–1. The titration curves provide direct evidence for two classes of binding sites in the MtK379 complex, but the values of the binding constants are approximate. At low concentrations, the calculation of the free mant ADP concentration is subject to error while at a high ratio of mant ADP to sites the signal is small. The binding constant of mant ADP to the MtK332 complex may also be overestimated because the complex is partially dissociated by ADP (dissociation constant, 15 μM in 10 mM NaCl), and mant ADP is very strongly bound to K332. The apparent binding constant obtained from the titration at 30 μM tubulin concentration was 30% smaller than at 20 μM tubulin. The values obtained from the titration curves are in reasonable agreement with values calculated from the rate constants of association and dissociation of mant ADP. It was shown previously that reaction of the K379·mant ADP dimer with microtubules plus ATP released both mant ADP molecules at a maximum rate of 30 to 35 s–1 obtained by extrapolation of the rate constant versus microtubule concentration (7Ma Y.Z. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13242-13251Google Scholar). The same experimental method gave a maximum rate of mant ADP dissociation of 110 s–1 for the K332 monomer (3Ma Y.-Z. Taylor E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 717-723Google Scholar). Reaction of K379·mant ADP with microtubules in the absence of ATP gave approximately half of the maximum fluorescence obtained with ATP present. The rate constant is 34 s–1 at a microtubule site concentration of 15 μM (Fig. 3A, curve 1). This step is followed by a small further release at a rate less than 0.5 s–1. The K379 site concentration is 0.5 μM, and the slow step corresponds to a small extent of dissociation from the high affinity site. The maximum rate for the first step obtained by extrapolation of the assumed hyperbolic dependence of the rate constant on microtubule concentration is 50 s–1 (data not shown). The K379·mant ADP complex mixed with microtubules plus a low concentration of ATP gave a biphasic signal. For curve 2, the concentration of ATP is 2.5 μM after mixing. The signal was fitted by rate constants of 30 s–1 and 5 s–1 and approximately equal amplitudes for the two steps. The rate constant of the second step increased linearly with ATP concentration over a low range of ATP concentrations. The variation in rate corresponds to an apparent second order rate constant of 2 μM–1 s–1 which is in the range expected for ATP binding to a MtK379 site. At high concentrations of ATP, the data fitted a single exponential for the release of all of the mant ADP. For curve 3, the ATP concentration is 25 μM and the rate constant is 18 s–1 at this microtubule concentration. The value is half as large as the rate of dissociation of the first mant ADP in the absence of ATP at the same microtubule concentration. The results show that after dissociation of one mant ADP from the dimer the second remains strongly bound and is released by a transition induced by binding of ATP to the other head in agreement with the findings of Hackney (5Hackney D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6865-6869Google Scholar). Both mant ADP molecules are released if the K379·mant ADP dimer is mixed with microtubules plus AMPPNP. The maximum rate of mant ADP dissociation obtained by extrapolation versus microtubule concentration is 18 s–1 (data not shown). Therefore a hydrolysis step is not necessary for mant ADP release from the strongly bound site although the extrapolated maximum rate was twice as large for ATP compared to AMPPNP. The observed rate of dissociation of the second mant ADP induced by nucleotide binding is affected by the rate of dissociation of the first mant ADP. Since it was shown that a MtK379 complex can be formed with one mant ADP bound at a high affinity site, this complex was used to measure the actual rate of mant ADP release by the binding of a nucleotide at the other site. The fluorescence signal for reaction of the complex with 1 mM ATP is shown in Fig. 3B (in 50 mM NaCl). The lag before release of mant ADP is 3 to 4 ms. Data collection is triggered 1.5 to 2 ms before flow stops in order to establish a base line. The actual lag before mant ADP release is 2 ms. The fluorescence signal in Fig. 3B is fitted by a rate constant of 95 s–1. There is a small deviation from the fit to one exponential term which indicates a small contribution from a slow step. The amplitude of the slow phase increased with ionic strength which increases the degree of dissociation of the MtK379 complex. Any K379 which dissociates with mant ADP still bound must release the nucleotide by rebinding to the microtubule. In 25 mM NaCl, the dissociation of MtK379 by ATP is very small and no slow phase was detected at this ionic strength. The rates of dissociation of the strongly bound mant ADP by various nucleotides are plotted in Fig. 4. ATP released the mant ADP at a rate of 100 s–1 with a half-maximum rate at 40 μM which corresponds to the Km value of MtK379 ATPase. The maximum rate was even larger for 2'-deoxy-ATP. The rate is 90 s–1 for GTP, but the half-maximum occurs at a much higher concentration as expected from the very high Km of MtK GTPase (10Gilbert S.P. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4677-4684Google Scholar). AMPPNP and ATPγS, which are nonhydrolyzed or slowly hydrolyzed nucleotides, gave maximum rates of 30-35 s–1. AMPPNP does not dissociate the MtK379 complex, but the binding of mant AMPPNP does induce a first order transition with rate constant of 40 s–1 (data not shown). Even ADP produces a slow rate of dissociation of 2-3 s–1 which is still 20 times larger than the spontaneous rate of 0.1 s–1. Therefore, the binding of a nucleotide ligand to one head induces a transition of the other head to a state in which mant ADP can dissociate with a rate constant of more than 100 s–1. The slower rates for ligands other than ATP indicate that a transition induced by these ligands is rate-limiting. Although the hydrolysis step is not necessary, the rate of mant ADP dissociation appears to approach the maximum value characteristic of the actual dissociation step only for hydrolyzed ligands. Even for ATP the observed rate could underestimate the actual rate constant of the ADP dissociation step. A different experiment to obtain an independent estimate of the rate constant of mant ADP dissociation is described below. The binding of mant ADP to MtK332 is relatively weak, and it was shown that the observed rate constant of binding, extrapolated to zero concentration, yielded a large apparent rate constant of mant ADP dissociation of up to 300 s–1 (3Ma Y.-Z. Taylor E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 717-723Google Scholar). The binding of mant ADP to nucleotide-free MtK379 exhibited quite different kinetic behavior (Fig. 5). At low concentrations, the fluorescence signal fitted one exponential term, but the observed rate constant was small. At higher concentrations, the rate constant increased, but the plot shows upward curvature. The initial slope of the plot gives an apparent second order rate constant of 1.5 μM–1 s–1, and the line extrapolates to zero within experimental error (±;1 s–1). Therefore, the rate constant of mant ADP dissociation is very small as expected for binding to a high affinity site. The experiments were repeated using the MtK379·ADP complex with the high affinity site occupied by ADP. In this case, a small amplitude signal with a large rate constant was obtained at low mant ADP concentrations. Because part of this small signal is lost in the dead time, the process was slowed by measuring the rate of binding at 10†C (Fig. 5). The rate constant is 85 s–1 at 5 μM mant ADP which is the lowest concentration that gave a measurable signal. The data extrapolate to a value of 50 s–1. The binding of mant ADP to MtK332 at 10†C is included in the figure for comparison. The extrapolated value is about 200 s–1. Therefore, MtK379 has a high affinity site for mant ADP (small rate constant of mant ADP dissociation). The extrapolated value of the rate constant of <1 s–1 corresponds to spontaneous dissociation from this high affinity site (0.1 s–1 based on treatment with apyrase). If this site is already occupied, the mant ADP binds to a low affinity site on the other head (large rate constant of mant ADP dissociation). The large rate constant corresponds to dissociation from a strongly bound head since it is similar to the rate constant of dissociation from the strongly bound head of the MtK332 monomer complex. The rate constant of approximately 75 s–1 at 20†C is also similar to the rate of release of mant ADP by the binding of ATP. The correlation suggests that ATP induces a transition of the ADP-containing head from a weakly bound state with high affinity for ADP to a strongly bound state with low affinity for ADP. The “S“-shaped plot of the rate constant versus mant ADP concentration could provide further evidence for head interactions. However, mant ADP is a mixture of 2' and 3' isomers, and the S-shaped dependence might be explained by differences in the fluorescence signals of the isomers (3Ma Y.-Z. Taylor E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 717-723Google Scholar, 4Ma Y.Z. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13233-13241Google Scholar). Experiments were done using the 3'-deoxy,2'-mant ADP isomer which does not give a biphasic fluorescence signal (3Ma Y.-Z. Taylor E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 717-723Google Scholar). An S-shaped dependence was still obtained for the rate of binding to MtK379 and a hyperbolic dependence for K379 alone (data not shown). Therefore, the S-shaped dependence requires different apparent rate constants for binding to the two heads. Some upward curvature of the plot is generated by a model in which the sites have binding constants of 5 × 106M–1 and 5 × 104M–1 but do not interact. The displacement of mant ADP from the strongly bound site by ADP binding to the other head (Fig. 4) indicates that there is interaction between heads, and this effect can increase the upward curvature of the rate constant plot. It has been shown that the dependence of the rate constant of mant ATP binding to MtK332 extrapolated to 100 s–1 at zero concentration (3Ma Y.-Z. Taylor E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 717-723Google Scholar) while for MtK379 the intercept was zero within experimental error and the concentration dependence was S-shaped(7). The experiments were repeated with 3‘-deoxy,2‘-mant ATP to eliminate possible complications from the use of mixed isomers. The fluorescence signal fitted a single exponential term, and the concentration dependence of the rate constants is plotted in Fig. 6. The rate plot has a large intercept for MtK332 and an essentially zero intercept and S- shaped dependence for MtK379. Qualitatively, the results show the presence of two kinds of sites for MtK379 and a single site for MtK332. The analysis of the kinetics is more complex for the mant ATPase reaction than for mant ADP binding, and the evidence is treated under “Discussion.” The comparison of the kinetic properties of MtK332 monomer and MtK379 dimer complexes showed significant differences which are explained by an interacting head mechanism. The MtK332 monomer binds mant ADP weakly (5 × 104M–1), and the effective rate of mant ADP dissociation is 100 s–1 to 200 s–1 (3Ma Y.-Z. Taylor E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 717-723Google Scholar). MtK379 has a high affinity mant ADP site (5 × 106M–1) and a low affinity site similar in value to the monomer complex. The rate constant of dissociation of mant ADP is 0.1 s–1 for the high affinity site and 50 s–1 to 100 s–1 for the low affinity site. A possible explanation of these results is that the K379 dimer is bound to the microtubule by only one head. Mant ADP would bind weakly to this head with values similar to the single strongly bound head of the monomer. The detached head would be equivalent to free kinesin and bind mant ADP with high affinity. Various lines of evidence suggest that this explanation is too simple and that the second head is weakly bound. The rate of dissociation of mant ADP from the high affinity site is 4-5 times larger than the rate for free K332 or K379. The rate of dissociation of the MtK379 complex by ATP or ADP is 5 times slower than for the monomer even if the high affinity site is occupied by ADP. The dissociation constants of K379 and its nucleotide complexes from microtubules as well as the Km for microtubule activation of the ATPase are at least 5 times smaller than for K332. If the binding constant of a single head is the same for both, then Kdimer = 2Kmono(1 + K2) where K2 is the effective equilibrium constant for binding of the second head. Because Kdimer is larger than 2Kmono, the second head is weakly bound but the value calculated for K2 is only 2 to 4; consequently, the second head is detached part of the time. If the microtubule lattice is saturated, binding by one head (one kinesin dimer per tubulin dimer) can still be more favorable than binding by both heads (one dimer per two tubulin dimers). Unless both heads were attached, at least transiently, it would be very difficult to explain the rapid dissociation of ADP from one head by the binding of ATP to the other head. A better comparison would be between monomeric and dimeric forms of the same construct. This was not possible for K379 because of the small dimer dissociation constant but human K413 was reported to have a much larger dissociation constant and the dimer form is more strongly bound to microtubules than the monomer (11Rosenfeld S.S. Rener B. Correia J.J. Mayo M.S. Chueng H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9473-9482Google Scholar). The reaction of mant ADP with the MtK332 monomer was described by a two-step mechanism (3Ma Y.-Z. Taylor E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 717-723Google Scholar) In the initial complex, kinesin is weakly bound to Mt and ADP is strongly bound. A transition to a state in which kinesin is more strongly bound and ADP is weakly bound is followed by rapid dissociation of ADP. The same mechanism is proposed for the dimer but with the restriction that when one head is very strongly bound in the nucleotide-free state the other head containing nucleotide is blocked in the weakly bound or detached state. The kinetic evidence is consistent with the mechanism REACTION 2View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) where L is a nucleotide ligand. The effective rate of ADP release depends on the ligand which affects the rate of the second step (Fig. 4). For ATP, the rate of dissociation of mant ADP of 100 s–1 is similar to the effective rate of mant ADP dissociation from the strongly bound state with low affinity for mant ADP (approximately 75 s–1, Fig. 5). It was shown previously that the rate of mant ADP dissociation is 30-35 s–1 obtained from the reaction of the K379·mant ADP dimer with microtubules plus ATP (7Ma Y.Z. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13242-13251Google Scholar). In the absence of ATP, the rate for the release of the first mant ADP was 50 s–1 while the second was dissociated by the action of ATP at approximately 100 s–1. The average rate for two steps in sequence is 33 s–1 which agrees with the previous result. Further evidence for interaction between heads is given by the S-shaped concentration dependence of the rate of binding of mant ADP to the MtK379 dimer. The discussion of the evidence for interaction between heads is based on experiments on the binding and dissociation of ADP. The kinetics of binding of mant ATP provides evidence that head interactions also occur in the ATPase cycle. The limiting rate constant for the binding of mant ATP, extrapolated to zero concentration, is approximately 100 s–1 for the MtK332 monomer and less than 1 s–1 for the MtK379 dimer (Fig. 6). An analysis of the kinetic scheme is necessary to interpret this result. For the monomer the minimum scheme is where ke is the effective rate constant for the dissociation of both products, and the asterisk denotes states of enhanced fluorescence. The analytic solution of this mechanism showed that the intercept at zero concentration is approximately equal to ke (7Ma Y.Z. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13242-13251Google Scholar). The value of 100 s–1 for the MtK332 monomer is consistent with the value expected from the rate constants and the maximum steady state rate. If the heads of the MtK379 dimer were independent, the intercept would be 30-40 s–1. Because the intercept is essentially the effective rate of dissociation of ADP, the value of <1 s–1 means that at a low concentration mant ATP binds primarily to the weakly bound or detached head and it is hydrolyzed to mant ADP which remains bound to the high affinity site. Dissociation of the mant ADP requires the binding and possibly the hydrolysis of ATP on the other head. At low mant ATP concentrations, the rate of this process is linear in ATP concentration (ka of 1-2 μM–1 s–1) and the limiting rate extrapolates to nearly zero. The positive curvature of the plot of rate constant versus concentration (Fig. 6) provides further evidence for the interaction between heads. Binding of mant ATP to the second head increases the rate of mant ADP release and thereby increases the observed rate constant. The ATPase results make the important point that the MtK379·mant ADP complex generated by hydrolysis behaves in the same way as the complex formed by binding mant ADP to MtK379. Hackney (5Hackney D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6865-6869Google Scholar) proposed an alternating site mechanism for the ATPase cycle. Although the ratio of steady state rates for MtK332 and MtK379 is a factor of 2 (50-60 s–1 versus 25-30 s–1), this correlation is probably a coincidence. The cycle on one head is delayed at the state in which ADP is strongly bound. If the other head had to bind ATP and complete most of a cycle, the release of ADP would be delayed by 15-20 ms, but the lag in mant ADP release is less than 2 ms in the experiments (Fig. 3B); thus, the coupled step must occur early in the cycle. The scheme is better described as a cycle in which the two heads are partly out of phase. A processive run of the motor begins with the binding of the K·ADP dimer to the microtubule followed by the release of ADP from one head. The Mt symbol is omitted in the scheme since we consider transitions between associated states. SCHEME 2View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)SCHEME 2View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)SCHEME 2View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In the first step, ATP binds to the complex in which the other head is occupied by ADP. This step corresponds to the conditions used in the mant ADP release experiments shown in Fig. 4. Rate constants are intended to illustrate the scheme and are approximate values based on monomer and dimer experiments. The rate constant of phosphate dissociation was not measured, but a large value is necessary to account for the steady state rate of the MtK332 monomer. For simplicity, the ADP and phosphate release steps are given the same rate constant in step 3. Otherwise, an additional state would have to be included. A simulation using this set of rate constants was fitted by a steady state rate of 43 s–1 for a “monomer” and 30 s–1 per head for a dimer. The lag in ADP release is 3 ms for the binding of ATP to the nucleotide-free head, and the rate of release of the ADP gives an approximate fit to one exponential of 80 s–1. Step 2 in which the heads interchange strongly and weakly bound states probably includes additional transitions which are not specified in the preliminary mechanism. However, the mechanism is highly processive if the transitions of the two heads are coupled such that one head of the dimer is always in a strongly bound state. It is proposed that efficient coupling is necessary for high processivity. Step 2 in the scheme may include an intermediate in which both heads are weakly bound and dissociation of the complex competes with the transition to a strongly bound state. The pathway of dissociation of the dimer is still unclear. In the monomer case, it was proposed that dissociation of K·ADP is the main step and this pathway accounts for the small processivity of the monomer (3Ma Y.-Z. Taylor E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 717-723Google Scholar). The rate of dissociation of MtK379 by ATP of 10 s–1 is too large to be compatible with high processivity (7Ma Y.Z. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13242-13251Google Scholar). The K560 dimer (9Ma Y.Z. Taylor E.W. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: A28Google Scholar) has a much smaller rate of dissociation consistent with the high processivity of this construct (2Vale R.D. Funatsu T. Pierce D.W. Romberg L. Harada Y. Yanagida T. Nature. 1996; 380: 451-453Google Scholar), and this system is better suited to an investigation of the pathway of dissociation. Image reconstruction of the microtubule-kinesin complex has provided evidence for two structural states. The distal part of the kinesin monomer tilts toward the plus end of the microtubule for the nucleotide-free or AMPPNP complex. while in the presence of ADP the distal part is more nearly perpendicular (12Hirose K. Lockhart A. Cross R.A. Amos L.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 277-279Google Scholar, 13Hirose K. Lockhart A. Cross R.A. Amos L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9539-9544Google Scholar). A similar correlation of the orientation in the presence or absence of ADP has also been observed for the actin-smooth muscle myosin subfragment 1 complex (14Whittaker M. Wilson-Kubelek E.M. Smith J.E. Faust L. Milligan R.A. Sweeney H.L. Nature. 1995; 378: 748-751Google Scholar). There are more than two biochemical states and some of them may not be distinguishable at the resolution of the reconstructions. Also, if there are two ADP states, the more stable state at equilibrium under the conditions of sample preparation is likely to be observed. The cartoon (Fig. 7) represents a possible correlation of our biochemical scheme with structural proposals, but a number of cartoons can be drawn (5Hackney D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6865-6869Google Scholar, 13Hirose K. Lockhart A. Cross R.A. Amos L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9539-9544Google Scholar). The strongly and weakly bound states are assigned to tilted and more nearly perpendicular structural states. The model bears an obvious similarity to actomyosin models (14Whittaker M. Wilson-Kubelek E.M. Smith J.E. Faust L. Milligan R.A. Sweeney H.L. Nature. 1995; 378: 748-751Google Scholar, 15Fisher A.J. Smith C.A. Thoden J.B. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.M. Rayment I.

Net motion in one direction requires an asymmetry in the interaction of the two heads with the microtubule lattice sites. It is introduced by assumption because it is determined by structure rather than biochemistry. Heads in a strong-weak state in the order shown in the figure are assumed to have a lower strain energy than a weak-strong state. The coupled transition of strong-weak to weak-strong requires dissociation of the trailing head and preferential rebinding to the next available lattice site in the positive direction. In this type of model, the coupling of a positive step to the ATPase cycle is less than one to one because there is a non-zero probability for the heads to be on the same pair of tubulin dimer sites after completion of a cycle (a zero step). Also, the motor can stall at a finite ATPase cycle rate. The increase in strain energy for a positive step against an external force increases the probability of taking zero or negative steps which appears to be a property of the system (17Coppin C.M. Finer J.T. Spudich J.A. Vale R.D. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: A6Google Scholar). We thank Aldona Rukuiza for expert technical assistance."

These results unambiguously demonstrate that hemozoin crystallites are identical to synthetic β-hematin. Heme is a potent multifunction regulator whose biochemical levels and distribution are precisely controlled on both intra- and extracellular levels (1Padmanaban G. Vekateswar V. Rangarajan P.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 492-496Google Scholar). Efficient regulation of heme is particularly critical for intra-erythrocytic parasites such as plasmodia which process large quantities of heme in the post-invasion digestion of the erythrocyte's hemoglobin. Plasmodia, which lack heme oxygenases, detoxify heme by sequestering it into an insoluble heme aggregate termed malarial pigment or hemozoin (2Slater A.F.G. Cerami A. Nature. 1992; 355: 167-169Google Scholar). The quinoline-based family of antimalarials interfere with this process by an as yet unknown mechanism that has recently come under intense scrutiny as part of the effort to combat the spread of chloroquine-resistant strains of Plasmodium. A variety of spectroscopic and bioanalytical techniques indicate that hemozoin is similar to the synthetic aggregated heme phase β-hematin, which is thought to form strands of hemes linked by propionate oxygen-iron bonds as well as interstrand propionate hydrogen bonds, Fig. 1 (3Bohle D.S. Conklin B.J. Cox D. Madsen S.K. Paulson S. Stephens P.W. Yee G.T. ACS Symp. Ser. 1994; 572: 495-515Google Scholar, 4Slater A.F.G. Swiggard W.J. Orton B.R. Flitter W.D. Goldberg D.E. Cerami A.

Characterization of the carboxylate stretching bands for the propionic acid side chains by IR and Raman spectroscopy provides the best evidence for the presence of iron-oxygen bonds to the propionate side chains (3Bohle D.S. Conklin B.J. Cox D. Madsen S.K. Paulson S. Stephens P.W. Yee G.T. ACS Symp. Ser. 1994; 572: 495-515Google Scholar, 4Slater A.F.G. Swiggard W.J. Orton B.R. Flitter W.D. Goldberg D.E. Cerami A.

Unfortunately, crystallographic characterization of these heme aggregates has been hampered by the phase heterogeneity of many synthetic preparations as well as by the small size of the synthetic and natural crystallites isolated from either trophozoites and infected hosts (6Moore G.A. Boothroyd B. Ann. Trop. Med. Parasitol. 1974; 68: 489-490Google Scholar). High resolution powder diffraction has been used extensively for the solution of many structural problems (7Langford J.I. Louer P. Rep. Prog. Phys. 1996; 59: 131-234Google Scholar), and it can solve problems posed by diffraction from microcrystalline phases. In this communication we describe the characterization of β-hematin derived from both synthetic and natural sources and provide new unambiguous evidence that the heme aggregate present in late stage trophozoites is β-hematin. Circa 3 × 109 chloroquine-susceptible Plasmodium falciparum late trophozoites of the 3D7 clone (NF54 strain) were synchronized with sorbitol and allowed to achieve a 92% level of parasitemia (8Schwarzer E. Turrini F. Ulliers D. Giribaldi G. Ginsburg H. Arese P. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1033-1041Google Scholar). The resulting intact trophozites were isolated by rapid cooling in liquid nitrogen, and the frozen suspension of cells was lyophilized by freeze-drying in vacuo at –10†C. In general this freeze-drying process required 12-14 h and resulted in a fine black free flowing powder. Uninfected erythrocytes from the same source were treated in an identical manner to give a bright red free flowing powder. In their respective experiments, samples of lyophilized trophozoites and erythrocytes were anhydrously loaded onto the diffractometer goinometer which was shrouded by a helium-filled glove bag during both the sample loading and diffraction pattern measurement procedures. Synthetic β-hematin was prepared from hemin (Sigma) by treating it with noncoordinating bases in anhydrous conditions, Equation 1 (3Bohle D.S. Conklin B.J. Cox D. Madsen S.K. Paulson S. Stephens P.W. Yee G.T. ACS Symp. Ser. 1994; 572: 495-515Google Scholar, 5Bohle D.S. Helms J.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 504-508Google Scholar). Briefly, the powder diffraction patterns were measured on beamline X3B1 at the Brookhaven National Laboratories National Synchrotron Light Source using an angular step of 0.01† in 2º with count times of between 5 and 20 s/data point. Source x-rays were monochromated by flat Si(111) crystals, and the diffracted beam was analyzed with a Ge(111) crystal. The resulting x-ray flux was continuously monitored for intensity throughout the data collection with an ion counting chamber placed in the x-ray beam immediately before the sample. The wavelength was calibrated by measuring the six most intense peaks of an aluminum oxide standard, and the system resolution is 0.01† at full width half-maximum (9Stephens P.W. Mihaly L. Wiley J.B. Shiou-Mei H. Kaner R.B. Diederich R. Whetten R.L. Holczer K. Phys. Rev. B Condens. Matter. 1992; 45: 543-546Google Scholar). For all room temperature measurements a flat plate (either brass or single crystal quartz) geometry was employed. For low temperature measurements a brass rectangular flat plate was used. For the trophozoite measurements the lyophilized sample was packed into a circular well 2 mm deep and 18 mm in diameter (volume = 0.51 milliliter). The data reduction was performed with the GUFI software package, and the unit cell was determined by exhaustive trial and error methods with ITO and TREOR (10Werner P.-E. Z. Kristallogr. 1964; 120: 375-389Google Scholar). The resulting triclinic cells were refined with FULLPROF (7Langford J.I. Louer P. Rep. Prog. Phys. 1996; 59: 131-234Google Scholar). The final LeBail fits and lattice refinement were performed with FULLPROF (11Wiles D.B. Young R.A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1981; 14: 149-151Google Scholar, 12Rodriguez-Carvajal J. Physica B (Amst.). 1993; 192: 55-69Google Scholar). The diffraction patterns for trophozoites and uninfected erythrocytes were measured from 4 to 30†, Fig. 2, traces a and b, Table I. The difference of traces a and b is shown in panel ii of Fig. 2 trace c. Both the desiccated erythrocytes and trophozoites scatter x-rays in two broad bands between 7-10† and 13-20† in 2º. The origin of these bands is most likely due to scattering from the lipid bilayer membranes in the cells. What is particularly important is that the trophozoites have clear Bragg diffraction spikes from a crystalline species not found in the erythrocytes; moreover, as shown in panel ii of Fig. 2, trace d, these peaks are identical to the sharp diffraction pattern obtained from synthetic samples of β-hematin. The hemozoin formed within trophozoites thus crystallizes in the same unit cell as β-hematin. The similar intensities of the two patterns in Fig. 2, traces a and d, suggest that the materials are also crystallographically identical on the atomic level as well.Table ICrystallographic parameters for β-hematinTemperature293 K50 K2º range (†)4.00-38.004.00-52.07a (Å)12.2176 (4)12.1076 (4)b (Å)14.7184 (5)14.5384 (4)c (Å)8.0456 (3)7.9808 (2)α (†)90.200 (2)90.868 (2)β (†)96.806 (3)96.705 (2)γ (†)97.818 (3)97.133 (2)V (Å3)1422.9 (2)1383.8 (1)Z22Rp (%)8.816.72Rwp (%)12.610.2dexp (g cm–11.45 (1)dcalc (g cm–1)1.4361.477 Open table in a new tab At room temperature high resolution powder diffraction patterns, full width half-maximum < 0.05†, are obtained for β-hematin, [Fe(protoporphyrin-IX)]n, Fig. 3. The diffraction pattern for this coordination polymer corresponds to a pure single phase which indexes to give a triclinic cell with a high figure of merit, Table I. At lower temperatures, 50 K, the diffraction profile(not shown) is also readily indexed to give a slightly smaller unit cell. The crystallographic parameters for the two temperatures differ principally in contraction along the a and b axes at low temperatures, suggesting that these correspond to the directions of weakest interchain interactions. The experimental density of β-hematin, 1.45(1) g ml–1, corresponds to the occupation of two heme molecules in the unit cell. For this crystal system there are only two possible space groups: either the two hemes are related by inversion symmetry in space group P-1 or they are crystallographically inequivalent and the space group is P1. In principle, Wilson statistics can be used to determine the presence of an inversion center from a diffraction pattern, but the method is notoriously inaccurate for powder data (13Giacovazzo C. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1996; 52: 331Google Scholar). In the present case the mean of |E · E–1| is 0.892 for 266 data out to 28† in Fig. 3, a value ambiguously between the limiting values of 0.968 and 0.736 for centro and noncentrosymmetric space groups. In single crystal x-ray diffraction experiments the space group is often confirmed by the complete and successful solution to the crystal structure. In spite of the high resolution present in the diffraction patterns in Fig. 2, Fig. 3, we have been unable to locate the hemes in the unit cells of β-hematin; thus we are unable to unambiguously fit the topological model in Fig. 1 into the experimentally determined lattice with molecular modeling techniques. We attribute this to the severe peak overlap present in the single angular dimension at higher angles in 2º and the concomitant lack of peak intensity data at higher resolution. A variety of compositions have been proposed for hemozoin, and a great deal of uncertainty surrounded early attempts to characterize this seemingly intractable black solid (14Lemberg R. Legge J.W. Hematin Compounds and Bile Pigments. Interscience, New York1949: 171-172Google Scholar, 15Slater A.F.G. Exp. Parasitol. 1992; 74: 362-365Google Scholar). Native isolated hemozoin is a highly crystalline material and published transmission electron micrograph images clearly indicate that there is either a regular lattice or d spacing of spacing of 9 ±; 2 Å (6Moore G.A. Boothroyd B. Ann. Trop. Med. Parasitol. 1974; 68: 489-490Google Scholar). In spite of preliminary suggestions that the heme aggregate present in hemozoin is β-hematin (14Lemberg R. Legge J.W. Hematin Compounds and Bile Pigments. Interscience, New York1949: 171-172Google Scholar), this hypothesis was discounted due to its contamination with proteins from early isolation protocols (16Yamada K.A. Sherman I.W. Exp. Parasitol. 1979; 48: 61-74Google Scholar). The development of better isolation procedures, which often employ proteases, has allowed for the separation of hemozoin consisting solely of heme as determined by complete elemental analysis (4Slater A.F.G. Swiggard W.J. Orton B.R. Flitter W.D. Goldberg D.E. Cerami A. Henderson G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 88: 325-329Google Scholar). Although the hemozoin isolated by these more rigorous procedures is identical to β-hematin by IR spectroscopy, it has been suggested that the hemozoin may have been modified during the isolation steps (17Warhurst D.C. Parasitol. Today. 1995; 11: 204-205Google Scholar). The diffraction results presented here provide compelling evidence against this possibility and clearly indicate that the heme aggregate produced in situ is crystalline and has the same lattice as β-hematin. The central question relating to the structure of hemozoin concerns the mechanism of its biosynthesis and how this is inhibited by the quinoline antimalarials. The biochemical consequences of nonsequestered heme accumulation are profound and include membrane lysis (18Fitch C.D. Chevil R. Banyal H.S. Phillips G. Pfaller M.A. Krogstad D.J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1982; 21: 819-822Google Scholar) and protease inhibition (19van der Jaagt D.L. Hunsaker L.A. Campos N.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1986; 18: 389-400Google Scholar, 20Gluzman I.Y.

It was recently recognized that one defense plasmodia have developed against these drugs is efficient drug excretion out of the digestive vacuole (21Ruetz S. Delling U. Brault M. Schurr E. Gros P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9942-9947Google Scholar); however, there may be other adaptations in the chloroquine-resistant strains. Indeed, a host of mechanisms have been proposed for the drug action of the quinolines (15Slater A.F.G. Exp. Parasitol. 1992; 74: 362-365Google Scholar), with the main consensus being the location of their activity in the digestive vacuole. An important step in elucidating the drug action mechanism of these antimalarials is the recent description of the heme aggregating ability of an unusual class of histidine-rich proteins, HRP I-IV, from P. falciparum, which have been cloned and overexpressed (22Sullivan D.J. Gluzman I.Y. Goldberg D.E. Science. 1996; 271: 219-222Google Scholar). These proteins may be the heme polymerase suggested by Slater and Cerami (2Slater A.F.G. Cerami A. Nature. 1992; 355: 167-169Google Scholar) or they may instead initiate heme aggregation (22Sullivan D.J. Gluzman I.Y. Goldberg D.E. Science. 1996; 271: 219-222Google Scholar) which can then be propagated by either enzymatic (2Slater A.F.G. Cerami A. Nature. 1992; 355: 167-169Google Scholar, 23Bendrat K. Berger B.J. Cerami A. Nature. 1995; 378: 138Google Scholar) or nonenzymatic (24Dorn A. Stoffel H. Matile H. Bubendorf R. Ridley R.G. Nature. 1995; 374: 269-271Google Scholar, 25Egan T.J. Ross D.C. Adams P.A.

Tech. 1995; 49: 77-82Google Scholar) heme-sequestering mechanisms. Regardless of these mechanistic details, it is clearly important to have a detailed structural understanding of the metabolic product of heme detoxification. Several properties of hemozoin make it an ideal excretory product of heme detoxification. First, it is dense and insoluble under physiological conditions and thus represents an irreversible sink for heme released from hemoglobin degradation. Second, hemozoin is a coordination polymer of ferric(protoporphyrin-IX), and thus it will not contribute to the oxygen radical stress from the auto-oxidation that would result from a coordination polymer of ferrous(protoporphyrin-IX). Finally, formation of hemozoin corresponds to an important excretory system for iron, release of which would further exacerbate the oxidative stress of the trophozoites. The methodology used in this report may be useful in the in situ study of other biomineral phases. The study of these materials is most often performed following exhaustive isolation and work up procedures, steps that potentially may alter the crystalline phase. Biomineralization and biocrystallization are most often associated with intra or extracellular membranes and their integral scaffold proteins. While many biological processes are facilitated or promoted by biomineralization, examples of biocrystallization as a mediator of toxicity or a regulated means of intracellular excretion are rare. Probably the best example of this phenomenon is the crystallization of β-hematin by malarial parasites in the early trophozoite stage. Finally, an important role for hemozoin released into the vasculatur during merozoite release may be the suppression of the host's immunological response by compromising macrophages that phagocitize hemozoin particles (8Schwarzer E. Turrini F. Ulliers D. Giribaldi G. Ginsburg H. Arese P. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1033-1041Google Scholar, 28Chou A.C. Chevli R. Fitch C.P. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 1543-1549Google Scholar).

Messenger RNAs from primary and metastatic tumor cells isolated from the same patient were compared. A partial cDNA was isolated that was expressed in the primary tumor cell line but not in the metastatic line. The full-length cDNA was cloned and sequenced, and the inferred amino acid sequence was found to encode a novel protein, which we named cystatin M, with 40% homology to human family 2 cystatins and similar overall structure. Cystatin M is expressed by normal mammary cells and a variety of human tissues.The mature cystatin M protein was produced in Escherichia coli as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein using the pGEX-2T expression system and purified by affinity chromatography. The cystatin M fusion protein displayed inhibitory activity against papain. Native cystatin M protein of approximately 14.5 kDa is secreted and was immunoprecipitated from supernatants of mammary cell cultures using affinity-purified antisera raised against recombinant cystatin M. An N-glycosylated form of cystatin M of 20-22 kDa was co-immunoprecipitated and accounted for about 30-40% of total cystatin M protein. Both forms of native cystatin M also occurred intracellularly. Consistent with the mRNA differential expression, no cystatin M protein was detected in metastatic mammary epithelial tumor cells. Loss of expression of cystatin M is likely associated with the progression of a primary tumor to a metastatic phenotype.

Consistent with the mRNA differential expression, no cystatin M protein was detected in metastatic mammary epithelial tumor cells. Loss of expression of cystatin M is likely associated with the progression of a primary tumor to a metastatic phenotype. Metastasis of a primary tumor is a multistage process involving aberrant functions of the tumor cell including increased local proteolysis, degradation of extracellular matrix components, invasion, migration, adhesion to the vascular basement membrane, migration through the vasculature, and proliferation at distant sites (1Poste G. Fidler I.J. Nature. 1980; 283: 139-146Google Scholar, 2Liotta L.A. Steeg P.S. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Cell. 1991; 64: 327-336Google Scholar, 3Mignatti P. Robbins E. Rifkin D.B.

Therefore, changes in the expression of multiple genes probably occur before tumor cells acquire the potential to metastasize. The identification of genes whose changes in expression determine the metastatic phenotype is essential in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying metastasis and in the design of novel therapies to arrest progression of primary cancers. In this study, we have applied differential display (5Liang L. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-970Google Scholar, 6Liang L. Averboukh L. Pardee A.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3267-3275Google Scholar) to follow changes in gene expression that arise during progression of a primary mammary cancer to the metastatic phenotype (7Band V. Zajchowski D. Swisshelm K. Trask D. Kulesa V. Cohen C. Connolly J. Sager R. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 7351-7357Google Scholar).

Cystatins are endogenous inhibitors of mammalian lysosomal cysteine proteinases, such as cathepsins B, L, H, and S, and the plant cysteine proteinases papain, acinidin, and ficin. They function both intracellularly and extracellularly (8Barrett A.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 193-196Google Scholar, 9Rich D.H. Barrett A.J. Salvessen G. Proteinase Inhibitors. Vol. 12. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1988: 153-178Google Scholar). All inhibitory cystatins display structural and functional similarities and are members of a single protein superfamily comprising three distinct families of closely related proteins: stefins, cystatins, and kininogens (reviews 8-12). Cystatin M is most closely related to family 2 cystatins, which consist of about 120 amino acid residues, and contain one or two disulfide loops near their C-terminal domain. Cystatins are postulated to control the activities of cysteine proteinases, which regulate protein turnover, as well as the processing of proenzymes and prohormones (8Barrett A.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 193-196Google Scholar, 9Rich D.H. Barrett A.J. Salvessen G. Proteinase Inhibitors. Vol. 12. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1988: 153-178Google Scholar, 10Turk V. Bode W.

Hoppe-Seyler. 1995; 376: 71-80Google Scholar). Cystatins bind to their target peptidases very tightly but reversibly, forming high affinity (Ki = 10-9 to 10-12M) equimolar complexes in competition with their substrates (13Abrahamson M. Ritonja A. Brown M.A. Grubb A. Machleidt W. Barrett A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9688-9694Google Scholar, 14Bj÷rk I. Alrikson E. Ylinenjäervi K. Biochemistry. 1988; 28: 1568-1573Google Scholar). The mammalian lysosomal cathepsins B, L, H, and S are inhibited to varying degrees by family 2 cystatins (15Bj÷rk I. Pol E. Raub-Segall E. Abrahamson M. Rowan A.D. Mort J.S. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 219-225Google Scholar, 16Hall A. Hakansson K. Mason R.W. Grubb A. Abrahamson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5115-5121Google Scholar). Cathepsins B and L have been implicated in invasion and metastasis of tumor cells (17Buck M.R. Karustis D.G. Day N.A. Honn K.V. Sloane B.F. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 273-278Google Scholar, 18Berquin I.M. Sloane B.F. Perspect. Drug Discov. Des. 1995; 2: 371-388Google Scholar, 19Sloane B.F. Moin K. Lah T.T. Pretlow T.G. Pretlow T.P. Aspects of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of Tumors. Academic Press, New York1994: 411-466Google Scholar). Increased cathepsin B and L activities have been reported in a variety of human and animal malignant tumors, which may reflect alterations in their expression, activation and processing, intracellular trafficking and delivery, as well as decreased regulation of these proteinases due to the reduced expression and activity of their endogenous inhibitors (17Buck M.R. Karustis D.G. Day N.A. Honn K.V. Sloane B.F. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 273-278Google Scholar, 18Berquin I.M. Sloane B.F. Perspect. Drug Discov. Des. 1995; 2: 371-388Google Scholar, 19Sloane B.F. Moin K.

The isolation and characterization of cystatin M is described in this report. Our results suggest that loss of expression of this cysteine proteinase inhibitor in metastatic tumor cells probably contributes to increased proteolytic potential, a feature of the metastatic phenotype. An invasion/metastasis suppressor function of cystatin M along the metastatic cascade is proposed. Normal human mammary epithelial cell strains (81N, 76N, and 70N) derived from reduction mammoplasties, as well as primary (21NT, 21PT) and metastatic (21MT-1, 21MT-2) tumor cell lines were established in this laboratory (7Band V. Zajchowski D. Swisshelm K. Trask D. Kulesa V. Cohen C. Connolly J. Sager R. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 7351-7357Google Scholar, 20Band V. Sager R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1249-1253Google Scholar). Metastatic tumor mammary epithelial cell lines MCF7, BT474, BT549, T47D, ZR-75-1, MDA-MB-157, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-361, MDA-MB-435, and MDA-MB-436 were obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD). All cell cultures were routinely grown in DFCI-1 medium (20Band V. Sager R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1249-1253Google Scholar). Cultures were grown in P100 dishes and harvested at about 75% confluence for RNA isolation and near confluence for DNA isolation. Immortal mammary epithelial cells were obtained by transfection of 76N cells with a plasmid containing the human papilloma virus-16 E6 gene (21Band V. De Caprio J.A. Delmolino L. Kulesa V. Sager R. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6671-6676Google Scholar). Escherichia coli K12 bacteria strain XL-1 Blue was obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Tissue culture medium components were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. or Hyclone (Logan, UT). Total cellular RNAs (50 μg) from exponentially growing cell cultures were treated with DNase I in the presence of RNasin ribonuclease inhibitor, in order to remove any residual DNA contamination as described elsewhere (22Sager R. Anisowicz A. Neveu M. Liang P. Sotiropoulou G. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 964-970Google Scholar). Then, RNAs were extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, and redissolved in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. The RNAs were subsequently reverse-transcribed by using a 3ʹ-anchoring primer T12MA (where M represents G, C, or A). The resultant partial cDNAs were amplified by PCR in the presence of 35S-dATP using T12MA and OPA6 (GGTCCCTGAC), an arbitrary 10-mer primer, as the 5ʹ-end primer (Operon Technologies, Inc.) and compared side-by-side on a 6% acrylamide/urea sequencing gel. These partial cDNA fragments correspond to the 3ʹ-end of the mRNAs (5Liang L. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-970Google Scholar). A differentially displayed cDNA of ∼0.3 kb (named 6A2 because it was amplified by using the T12MA and OPA6 primers) was recovered from the dried gel, purified by a Millipore Ultrafree mc unit, reamplified by PCR, 32P-labeled by the oligo-labeling method (23Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Google Scholar), and used as a probe for hybridization of Northern blots. The 6A2 partial cDNA obtained from DD was subcloned into the PCRII vector using the TA cloning system (Invitrogen); a clone containing an insert that hybridized to a 0.6-kb transcript was isolated and sequenced on both strands with T7 and SP6 primers. A cDNA library from 21PT cells constructed in Lambda Zap II (Stratagene, San Diego, CA) was screened using the cloned PCR product as a probe; several full-length cDNA clones were isolated. Their differential expression was confirmed by Northern hybridizations of the same RNA samples used for DD, as well as RNAs from a number of normal and tumor cell lines. Three distinct full-length cDNA clones were sequenced on both strands. Sequencing was performed using an ABI automated sequencer, Model 373A, in the Molecular Biology Core Facility of the DFCI. Oligonucleotides were synthesized at the Molecular Biology Core Facility of the DFCI and by Amitof Inc. (Cambridge, MA). The BLAST algorithm was used for nucleic acid sequence comparisons (24Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Google Scholar). Protein sequence comparisons were performed by GCG with final alignments by PILEUP and PRETTYPLOT (24Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA was purified by standard guanidinium isothiocyanate and cesium chloride centrifugation and analyzed as described (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was isolated and hybridized by standard methods (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Hybridizations were performed in formamide at 370C overnight. The blots were washed at 650C for 1 h in 2 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS. The tissue blot (Human MTN Blot, Clontech, number 7760-1) was washed at 650C for 1 h in 0.5 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS. For a loading control, Northern blots were stripped and re-hybridized to 36B4, a gene encoding a ribosomal protein, whose expression is not affected by growth conditions or estrogen receptor expression (26Masiakowski P. Breathnach R. Bloch J. Gannon F. Krust A. Chambon P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 7895-7903Google Scholar). Densitometric scans of autoradiographs were obtained with an imaging densitometer (Bio-Rad GS-700) using the Molecular Analyst software. The open reading frame cDNA sequence encoding the putative mature cystatin M (Leu22-Met149) was amplified by PCR using a sense, 5ʹ(-GGAATTCTG CCACGAGATGCCCGGGC-)3ʹ, and an antisense, 5ʹ(-CCCTCGAATTCTTATCAC ATCTGCAC-)3ʹ, 26-mer oligonucleotide designed to create EcoRI overhangs. The amplification included 2 initial cycles at low stringency (420C) and 38 cycles at higher stringency (600C). The amplified product was sequenced to ensure that it contained no mutations induced by PCR. The PCR product was then restricted with EcoRI and ligated to pGEX-2T vector (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) (27Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Google Scholar), which was previously linearized with EcoRI, resulting in the expression plasmid pGEX2T/cystatin M. The original vector (PGEX-2T) as well as the recombinant plasmid (PGEX-2T/cystatin M) were transformed into E. coli XL-1 Blue bacteria and propagated in Luria broth (LB) (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) in the presence of 100 μg/ml ampicillin for selection of the cells transformed with the pGEX-2T/cystatin M expression plasmid. The expression of recombinant protein was induced in exponentially growing bacteria (A550 = 0.8-1.0) with 0.2 mM isopropyl-1-thio-b-D-galactopyranoside for 1.5 h at 370C with vigorous agitation. The bacteria were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with MTPBS (150 mM NaCl, 16 mM Na2HPO4, 4 mM NaH2PO4, pH 7.4) and resuspended in lysis buffer, MTPBS containing 1 mM DTT, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2% Triton X-100. Cells were lysed on ice by mild sonication, and the suspension was centrifuged at 14,500 × g for 15 min. All subsequent purification steps were carried out at 40C. The fusion protein was purified from the clear lysate on glutathione-agarose beads under nondenaturing conditions, with an estimated yield of 3-5 mg per liter of bacterial culture. The glutathione-agarose column was washed with MTPBS containing 350 mM NaCl, and the fusion protein was eluted with 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 5 mM reduced glutathione. Purified rGST-cystatin M was dialyzed against MTPBS containing 10% glycerol, sterilized by filtration through 0.22-μm filters (Costar, Cambridge, MA), and stored at -200C. The GST carrier was proteolytically cleaved from the fusion protein with thrombin and removed along with any uncleaved fusion protein by absorption on glutathione-agarose. Thrombin reaction was carried out at room temperature in the presence of 150 mM NaCl, 2.1 mM CaCl2, 3.2 NIH thrombin units/ml, and 1 mg/ml fusion protein. The reaction was stopped with 0.1 mM EGTA, and cleavage was monitored by SDS-PAGE. Cleaved protein was dialyzed against MTPBS and stored at -200C. The purity of rGST-cystatin M was assessed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 and Silver (Silver Stain Plus, Bio-Rad). The concentration of the purified protein was determined by Bradford assay using γ-globulin as a standard. Glutathione-agarose resin and other chemicals were purchased from Sigma, unless otherwise indicated. The reagents for SDS-PAGE and the Bradford assay were purchased from Bio-Rad. The protein (0.2 mg/ml) was denatured and reduced in 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1 mM EDTA, 15 mM dithiothreitol, and 8 M urea, at 370C for 30 min. Then the protein was alkylated with 50 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma) at room temperature for 20 min. Electrophoresis of the modified protein was carried out in nonreducing gels containing 7.5% acrylamide and 8 M urea in 0.375 M Tris, pH 8.5. The purified fusion protein was used to immunize New Zealand White rabbits. Antiserum raised against the fusion protein and cystatin M cleaved from the fusion protein by thrombin was affinity-purified on a rGST and, subsequently, on an rGST-cystatin M-agarose column (28Krek W. Livingston D.M. Shirodkar S. Science. 1993; 262: 1557-1560Google Scholar). The purified antibody was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline containing 50% glycerol, adjusted to 0.02% NaN3, and stored at 40C. The anti-cystatin M antibody specifically recognized cystatin M recombinant and native protein and did not cross-react with either cystatin C, stefin A, or stefin B on Western blots containing 10 μg of recombinant proteins. The recombinant protein and biological samples were denatured in SDS-PAGE sample buffer at 900C for 5 min and analyzed on 15% polyacrylamide gels. For immunoblot detection, the proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (0.2 micron, Bio-Rad) and reacted with polyclonal antiserum (1:500) and preimmune serum (1:500). Anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase-linked whole antibody was used as secondary antibody (1:2000), and immunoreactive proteins were detected with the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Corp.). Transfer and quantitation of proteins were assessed by staining with 0.1% w/v amido black in 25% isopropyl alcohol and 10% acetic acid. Destaining solution contained 50% methanol and 7.5% acetic acid in H2O. For the preparation of whole cell lysates, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended (8-10 × 106 cells/ml) in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, containing 120 mM NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.2 mM sodium orthovanadate, and 100 mM NaF). Lysed cells were rocked for 30 min and centrifuged at 14,500 × g for 15 min, and the supernatants were assayed immediately. All steps were performed at 40C. For immunoprecipitation, 3 ml of cell culture supernatant or 250 μl of fresh whole cell lysate were diluted 1:1 with 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, containing 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40; preimmune serum or affinity-purified antiserum were added, respectively, to each sample at a 1:500 dilution, and the samples were incubated with mild agitation for 1 h. The immunoprecipitated proteins were then bound to Protein A-Sepharose beads for 30 min, solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, denatured at 900C for 5 min, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Protease inhibitors were added to the supernatants immediately after collection to prevent proteolytic degradation of cystatin M. Native cystatin M protein was precipitated from 3 ml of 21 PT cell culture supernatant with ammonium sulfate, which was then removed by dialysis against 20 mM Na2HPO4, pH 7.2. The protein was deglycosylated in a 50-μl reaction by incubation at 370C for 24 h in 20 mM Na2HPO4, pH 7.2, containing 10 mM NaN3, 50 mM EDTA, and 0.5% v/v Nonidet P-40, and 0.25 units of N-glycosidase F (Boehringer Mannheim) (29Tarentino A.L. Gomez C.M. Plummer Jr., TH Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4665-4671Google Scholar). Deglycosylation of cystatin M did not require previous denaturation of the protein. Papain activity was assayed in 125 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, containing 4 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.05% Brij-35 using the fluorigenic synthetic substrate Z-Phe-Arg-NHMec in both continuous rate and stopped flow assays. Papain solutions were preincubated with increasing amounts of rGST-cystatin M, in a total volume of 50 μl for 5 min, and then added to 2-ml assay buffer containing 2.5-150 μM substrate. Final concentration of papain was 5-100 pM or 10 nM and of rGST-cystatin M 0-5 nM or 0-1 μM. The reaction mixture was stirred during the assay. The initial reaction rates were monitored by the increase in the intensity of relative fluorescence with a fluorimeter (model SFM25, Kontron Instruments). The excitation and emission wavelengths were 380 and 440 nm, respectively. The amount of 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin liberated from the synthetic substrate was determined from a standard curve. All steps were carried out at room temperature. The self-hydrolysis of the substrate was negligible for the applied reaction times. As a negative control, GST and bovine serum albumin were tested under the same assay conditions. Papain (EC 3.4.22.2) from papaya latex was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Z-Phe-Arg-NHMec and 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin were purchased from Sigma. Messenger RNAs from a mammary epithelial primary tumor cell line, 21PT, and from a metastatic cell line, 21MT-1, derived from the same patient (7Band V. Zajchowski D. Swisshelm K. Trask D. Kulesa V. Cohen C. Connolly J. Sager R. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 7351-7357Google Scholar) were compared by DD. Each lane contained 50-100 bands most of which were similar in size and intensity between the two cell populations. A small number of bands (∼1-2%) appeared in only one of the two lanes. A cDNA of about 0.3 kb was detected, which was present in 21PT primary, but absent in 21MT-1 metastatic cells (Fig. 1, lanes A, P, and M, respectively). This partial PCR product was used as a probe to hybridize Northern blots containing the same RNAs used for DD. A differentially expressed transcript of 0.6 kb was detected. The partial cDNA obtained from DD was cloned into a plasmid vector; Northern hybridizations were repeated with the cloned cDNA as a probe and sequenced on both strands. Sequence comparison with the Genbank data base using the BLAST program (24Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Google Scholar) revealed regions of homology to cystatins. A 21PT λZap cDNA library was screened with the cloned partial cDNA obtained from DD. Several positive clones were selected, hybridized to total RNAs from normal and tumor cell lines, and all displayed confirmatory differential expression on Northern blots as on the DD gel. Three longest clones were sequenced on both strands and contained an ATG initiation codon at the 5ʹ-region (Fig. 2). The priming site of the 5ʹ-arbitrary primer, OPA6, appears at nucleotides 282-292 of the cDNA sequence and contains three mismatches. The original DD product of 299 base pairs corresponds to nucleotides 229-598. Assuming that translation starts at the first ATG codon which lies in a Kozak consensus sequence, the full-length cystatin M cDNA contains an open reading frame of 447 nucleotides (24-470), a short 5ʹ-untranslated sequence (1Poste G.

This cDNA sequence predicts a 149-residue initial translation product, which contains a 21-residue signal sequence and the 128-residue mature cystatin M, with four cysteine residues toward its C-terminal domain (Fig. 2). The initiator ATG indicated in Fig. 2 is probably the major translation start site, since the translated sequence aligns optimally with other human cystatins. Internal ATGs do not lie within Kozak consensus sequences. Fig. 3 depicts a comparison of the primary sequence for cystatin M preprotein with those of other family 2 human cystatins (30Saitoh E.

Chem. 1989; 264: 17164-17169Google Scholar) was included in this alignment because its structure and function have been studied extensively. Cystatin M, like other members of the family, shares the three conserved domains, including a conserved glycine at the active site near the N terminus, Gly36 of cystatin M preprotein (10Turk V. Bode W. FEBS Lett. 1991; 285: 213-219Google Scholar) (Gly11 of mature cystatin C and Gly9 of chicken cystatin). Cystatin M also contains two motifs for cysteine proteinase inhibitory activity, the “Gln-X-Val-X-Gly” motif in the middle of the molecule, Gln80-Leu-Val-Ala-Gly84 in cystatin M preprotein (Gln-Ile-Val-Ala-Gly in cystatin C and Gln-Leu-Val-Ser-Gly in chicken cystatin), as well as the Val133-Pro-Trp135 motif near the C-terminal end, conserved in all inhibitory cystatins (Fig. 3). The overall homology between cystatin M and other cystatins ranges from 30 to 40% for conserved amino acid residues and 25 to 33% for identical amino acids. The homology at the nucleotide level is 40-45% to human cystatins and 42% to chicken cystatin. Cystatin M shows the closest homology to cystatin C. The two proteins share 33% identical and 38% conserved amino acid residues. The homology between cystatins from different species including chicken, mouse, rat, and puff adder is 39-48% for conserved amino acid residues. All previously characterized cystatins contain about 120 amino acid residues and two intrachain disulfide bridges. Cystatin M indeed contains four cysteine residues near the C-terminal domain, Cys98, Cys113, Cys126, and Cys146. Since cystatin M displays the"

A fully randomized sequence DNA oligonucleotide (10-mer) library was equilibrated with each of two folded RNA fragments (200 and 370 nucleotides (nt)), together spanning the 5′ 440 nt of an HCV transcript (by overlapping 130 nt), which were varied over a range of concentrations. The equilibrations were performed in solution under conditions determined to preserve RNA structure and to limit all RNA-DNA library oligonucleotide interactions to 1:1 stoichiometry. Subsequent Escherichia coli RNase H (endoribonuclease H: EC 3.1.26.4) cleavage analysis identified two preferred sites of highest affinity heteroduplex hybridization. The lengths and sequences of different substitute chemistry oligonucleotides complementary to these sites were rationally optimized using an iterative and quantitative analysis of binding affinity and specificity. Thus, DNA oligonucleotides that hybridized with the same affinity to the preferred sites in the folded RNA fragments found by screening as to short (≤25 nt) RNA complements were identified but were found to vary in length (10-18 nt) from site to site. Phosphorothioate (P=S) and 2′-fluoro (2′-F) uniformly substituted oligonucleotides also were found, which hybridized optimally to these sites, supporting the design of short (10-15-nt) and maximally specific oligonucleotides that are more nuclease-resistant (via P=S) and have higher affinity (via 2′-F) than DNA. Finally, the affinities of DNA and uniform 2′-F-, P=S-substituted 10-20-mer oligonucleotide complements for the best hybridization site, from HCV nt 355 to nt 364-374, closely corresponded to antisense mechanism inhibition activities in an in vitro translation assay and in a human cell-based HCV core protein expression assay, respectively. These results validate our strategy for the selection of hybridization-optimized and biologically active antisense oligonucleotides targeting HCV RNA and support the potential for utility in further applications.

These results validate our strategy for the selection of hybridization-optimized and biologically active antisense oligonucleotides targeting HCV RNA and support the potential for utility in further applications. In order to ensure sequence-unique recognition of antisense and ribozyme oligonucleotide drug candidates with a chosen site on any given transcript or transcript precursor RNA, a necessary and sufficient requirement for a minimum of 15-17 complementary base pairs has been proposed (1Cohen J.S. Hogan M.F. Sci. Am. 1994; 271: 76-82Google Scholar, 2Wu-Pong S. Pharm. Technol. 1994; 18: 102-114Google Scholar), and typically 20 are sought (3Dean N.M. McKay R. Condon T.P. Bennett C.F. J. Biol.

However, both the kinetics and the thermodynamics of antisense oligonucleotide hybridization may be profoundly attenuated when an energetic cost is incurred to disrupt secondary and tertiary structures of folded RNA that block the hybridization (5Lima W.F. Monia B.P. Ecker D.J. Freier S.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12055-12061Google Scholar, 6Nellen W. Lichtenstein C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 419-423Google Scholar, 7Freier S.M. Crooke S.T.

Further, the complexity of folded RNA suggests that there should be great variability of RNA structure-dependent hybridization parameters for oligonucleotides complementary to different positions along the primary sequence. In addition, examination of known RNA secondary structures reveals that identification of structurally ideal RNA hybridization sites for oligonucleotides as long as 20-mers 1The abbreviations used are: -mer(s)-oligomer(s)HCVhepatitis C virusntnucleotide(s)NCRnoncoding regionGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenasetr-ICAM-1truncated intercellular adhesion molecule 1PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisIVTin vitro translationP=Sphosphorothioate2′-F2′-deoxy-2′-fluoroRP-HPLCreverse phase high pressure liquid chromatographyCPGcontrolled pore glass. is improbable. Therefore, it should be expected that the usual piecemeal sampling (“walks”) at arbitrary intervals along linear RNA transcript sequences with a manageable set (typically 10-50) of complementary 20-mer oligonucleotides (3Dean N.M. McKay R. Condon T.P. Bennett C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16416-16424Google Scholar, 4Chiang M.-Y. Chan H. Zounes M.A. Freier S.M. Lima W.F. Bennett C.F. J. Biol.

At effective concentrations, oligonucleotides chosen in this manner may then bind with near to, equivalent, or even higher affinity at alternative RNA sites on the same or other transcript(s) that are closely sequence-related, but more favorably structured, resulting in diminished site and transcript specificity (9Wagner R.W.

In efforts to advance antisense oligonucleotide identification beyond the “linear thinking” of sequence complementarity, computer RNA folding algorithms as well as enzymatic and chemical reagent mapping approaches have been used to determine RNA secondary structure. These procedures do not predict tertiary interactions and may be unreliable (14Szakiel G. Homann M. Rittner K. Antisense Res. Dev. 1993; 3: 45-52Google Scholar, 15Jaroszewski J.W. Syi J.-L. Ghosh M.

Annual Reviews, Inc., Palo Alto, CA1993: 255-287Google Scholar), and the latter require use of multiple reagents or enzymes and can be tedious to perform. Even when single-stranded regions of RNA are accurately located, subsequent indirect predictions for the kinetics and thermodynamics of complementary oligonucleotide hybridization may be in error by many orders of magnitude (5Lima W.F. Monia B.P. Ecker D.J. Freier S.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12055-12061Google Scholar) due to steric, topological, and tertiary structural constraints not evident in secondary structure determinations.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3943-3950Google Scholar), while all enjoying some early stage success, require identification of particular RNA structural elements and are limited in scope when viewed against the potential structural diversity of available RNA targets in cells. Most recently, potentially powerful combinatorial or semicombinatorial strategies have been applied to the problem of oligonucleotide recognition of RNA structure. Although (partial) randomization of the RNA substrate recognition nucleotides of trans-cleaving ribozymes (25Campbell T.B. Cech T.R. RNA. 1995; 1: 598-609Google Scholar, 26Lieber A. Strauss M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 540-551Google Scholar) is promising, the methodology is not directly applicable to small antisense oligonucleotides. Probing hybridization to structured RNA with multiple length fragments of a given antisense nucleic acid generated by semicombinatorial solid phase synthesis (27Southern E.M. Case-Green S.C. Elder J.K. Johnson M. Mir K.U. Wang L. Williams J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1368-1373Google Scholar) or by solution-based alkaline fragmentation of end-labeled RNA (28Rittner K. Burmester C. Sczakiel G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1381-1387Google Scholar) represent innovative screening approaches. However, solid phase screening may bias the former; conserved end fragments of the latter do not mimic therapeutic antisense oligonucleotides; and both methods require unique synthesis of (the equivalent of) full-length antisense nucleic acid for a complete search of a given RNA metabolite. All methods currently are subject to restrictions on the length of target RNA that can be accommodated, which may or may not be easily surmounted to eventually provide more efficient searches of long transcript RNAs. For these reasons, there clearly is a need for additional and better general methods to directly identify oligonucleotides that hybridize to folded RNA of undetermined structure with minimal energetic cost (29Ladbury J. Peters R. Bio/Technology. 1994; 12: 1083-1085Google Scholar) of RNA structure disruption. Such oligonucleotides would maximize rates of hybridization (or “kinetic accessibility”) and, hence, as previously shown, also would maximize affinity per unit length (5Lima W.F. Monia B.P. Ecker D.J. Freier S.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12055-12061Google Scholar) and the effectiveness of in vivo antisense inhibition (28Rittner K. Burmester C. Sczakiel G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1381-1387Google Scholar). Enhanced specificity also should be realized when the probability is greatly reduced of finding close sequence-related RNA sites with comparably favorable structure for oligonucleotide hybridization. Oligonucleotides with these properties most likely would be restricted in length to 10-15 nt, but they would have sufficient biological potency because of the fullest possible realization of hybridization affinity, which could be enhanced further with alternative chemical compositions. The potential problem of formation of internal oligonucleotide structure that would be further stabilized by high affinity chemical compositions, and which would lessen the net hybridization affinity with RNA (8Chastain M. Tinoco I. Crooke S.T. Lebleu B. Antisense Research and Applications. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1993: 55-66Google Scholar), would also be minimized with shorter oligonucleotides. Other potential advantages of shorter oligonucleotides would be enhancement of primary sequence mismatch specificity (30Hertel K.J. Herschlag D. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3374-3385Google Scholar, 31Herschlag D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6921-6925Google Scholar, 32Monia B.P. Johnston J.F. Ecker D.J. Zounes M.A. Lima W.F. Freier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19954-19962Google Scholar) and product release after RNase-, ribozyme-, or artificial agent-mediated RNA cleavage (30Hertel K.J. Herschlag D. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3374-3385Google Scholar), improved cellular uptake (33Loke S.L. Stein C.A. Zhang X.H. Mori K. Nakanishi M. Subasinghe C. Cohen J.S. Neckers L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3474-3478Google Scholar), reduced nonspecific protein binding (11Stein C.A. Krieg A.M. Antisense Res. Dev. 1994; 4: 67-69Google Scholar), and less expensive synthesis and purification. To address this existing need for alternative methods to identify oligonucleotides optimized for hybridization to transcript RNA, we have developed a strategy schematically depicted in Fig. 1. In an initial solution-based combinatorial approach, we sequentially use short, fully randomized (i.e. equimolar) sequence DNA oligonucleotide library hybridization affinity screening and Escherichia coli RNase H (endoribonuclease H: EC 3.1.26.4) cleavage analysis (Fig. 1A) to identify energetically preferred hybridization sites on folded RNA. We then follow up by quantitative rational optimization of affinity and specificity of hybridization of individual oligonucleotides to these sites (Fig. 1B). Here we report the application of this approach to the problem of antisense recognition of the 5′-noncoding region (NCR) and initial coding region of a hepatitis C virus (HCV) transcript. HCV is the major cause of post-transfusion acute hepatitis, which may often progress to chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (34Kiyosawa K. Sodeyama T. Tanaka E. Gibo Y. Yoshizawa K. Nakano Y. Furuta S. Akahane Y. Nishioka K. Purcell R.H. Alter H.J. Hepatology. 1990; 12: 671-673Google Scholar), and therapeutic options for treatment of patients remain limited and largely ineffective (35Hanecak R. Brown-Driver V. Fox M.C. Azad R.F. Furusako S. Nozaki C. Ford C. Sasmor H. Anderson K.P. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5203-5212Google Scholar). The 5′-NCR is attractive for antisense targeting because it is relatively long (∼340 nt) and has highly conserved primary sequence (36Wakita T. Wands J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14205-14210Google Scholar, 37Bukh J. Purcell R.H. Miller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4942-4946Google Scholar) and secondary structure (38Brown E.A. Zhang H.

Sense oligonucleotide primer for the 370-nt fragment contained the 17-mer T7 RNA polymerase promoter followed by nt 1-20 of the HCV insert, and antisense oligonucleotide primer was complementary to nt 333-370. Sense oligonucleotide primer for the 200 nt fragment contained the T7 promoter followed by nt 240-260 of HCV, and antisense oligonucleotide primer was complementary to nt 403-440. Transcript fragments were prepared from polymerase chain reaction-synthesized duplex DNA fragments of pGEM42-NCE 1 using the Ambion MegaScript kit according to instructions and were extracted with phenol-CHCl3, precipitated with ethanol, and then purified using Boehringer Mannheim G-50 Quick Spin columns as instructed. RNA transcripts were 5′-end-labeled with 32P after dephosphorylation with calf-intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Boehringer Mannheim), using [γ-32P]ATP (ICN Biochemicals) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) and were 3′-end-labeled with 32P using [32P]phosphocytosine phosphate (ICN Biochemicals) and T4 RNA ligase (Boehringer Mannheim) (5Lima W.F. Monia B.P. Ecker D.J. Freier S.M.

RNases ONE (Promega), T1 and CL3 (Boehringer Mannheim), A (Life Technologies, Inc.), and V1 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) were variously used in 10 μl containing hybridization buffer (1 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2), 3 mg of tRNA, and 104 cpm 5′-32P- or 3′-32P-end-labeled RNA transcript fragment in the presence (for footprinting) or absence (for mapping) of prehybridized individual oligonucleotides for 5 min at 37°C. Reactions were quenched with 5 μl of 9 M urea, and products were resolved on 10% denaturing PAGE. Enzymatic activities were adjusted to limit the extent of digestion to 10%. Gels were quantitatively imaged using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager, and digitized values corresponding to all sequence positions where enzymatic cleavage was observed were used in all analyses. DNA and 2′-deoxy, P=S oligonucleotides were synthesized by standard phosphoramidite chemistry on an ABI synthesizer (model 380B) and purified as described (3Dean N.M. McKay R. Condon T.P.

Briefly, 5′-dimethoxytrityl 2′-tert-butyldimethylsilyl nucleoside 3′-O-phosphoramidites with phenoxyacetyl protecting groups on the exocyclic amines of A, C, and G were used. The wait step after pulse delivery of tetrazole was 900 s. Base deprotection was achieved by overnight incubation at room temperature in methanolic ammonia, and the 2′-silyl group was removed at room temperature in 1 M tetrabutylammonium fluoride in tetrahydrofuran. RNA oligonucleotides were purified using a C18 Sep-Pak cartridge followed by ethanol precipitation. Randomized DNA oligonucleotide libraries were made (40Davis P. Ecker D.J. Pinilla C. Houghton R.A. Methods in Molecular and Cellular Biology 40. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1996: 23-33Google Scholar) on an ABI synthesizer (model 394) using experimentally determined adjusted proportions of phosphoramidites of each of the four nucleotide bases (assayed by ratio of incorporation into all possible dimers) such that, when mixed into a single vial, equimolar incorporation of all four bases at each sequence position was reproducibly obtained, thus ensuring equimolar representation of all possible sequence oligonucleotides (calculated as 410 = 1,048,576 sequences). Briefly, phosphoramidites were mixed in a single vial on the fifth port of the ABI 394 synthesizer, and the coupling wait step was increased to 5 min. The ratio of phosphoramidites in the mixture was tested by making a single coupling to dT-CPG, cleaving and deprotecting the product, and analyzing the crude dinucleotide material on RP-HPLC. Proportions of the individual phosphoramidites were adjusted accordingly, and the procedure was repeated until equal amounts of the four dimers were obtained. The 3′-position was sequence-randomized by mixing the four base CPGs, removing the 5′-dimethoxytrityl on the synthesizer, cleaving and deprotecting the product, and analyzing by RP-HPLC. The proportion of each CPG was adjusted until equal amounts of each base were obtained. Each synthesis used 1 μM of the mixed base CPG. After cleavage and deprotection with ammonium hydroxide at 55°C for 16 h the dimethoxytrityl-off oligonucleotide libraries were purified by RP-HPLC. The libraries were analyzed by denaturing PAGE and diluted to a final library concentration of 10 μM. Limit hydrolyses by snake venom phosphodiesterase I (U.S. Biochemical Corp.) and examination of products by uv absorption on RP-HPLC confirmed the equimolar representation of bases. A few sequences may be underrepresented, without affecting this result, due to relatively poor aqueous solubility (i.e. of long strings of G nucleotides). Prior to mixing for hybridization, the diluted transcript fragment and DNA library were each heated independently to 90°C for 1 min and cooled slowly to 37°C. Hybridizations were done over 20 h at 37°C in 30 μl containing hybridization buffer, 104 cpm of 32P end-labeled transcript (1 nM to 10 μM total RNA), and 1 mM DNA library (calculated concentration, 100 pM individual sequences). Some hybridizations proceeded for up to 40 h with no change in the results (not shown), except for enhanced nonspecific background degradation of target RNA in some cases. Dithiothreitol was added to 1 mM and then (E. coli) RNase H (U.S. Biochemical Corp.) was added, varied (0.001-0.1 units) for each [RNA] to obtain the best signal-to-noise ratio, and reactions were allowed to proceed for 1-10 min at 37°C. Reactions were quenched, and products were analyzed as for enzymatic structure mapping and footprinting. For determinations of Ka′ values, short RNA oligonucleotides (25-mers) containing the preferred HCV transcript binding site sequences identified by combinatorial hybridization affinity screening, 23-48 and 353-378, were made by automated synthesis. Hybridizations were done in 20 μl containing hybridization buffer, 1000 cpm of 5′-32P-labeled RNA, and antisense oligonucleotide ranging from 10 pM to 10 μM. Mixes were heated at 90°C for 5 min, cooled slowly to 37°C, and incubated for 20 h at 37°C. 10 μl of loading buffer (15% Ficoll, 0.25% bromphenol blue, 0.25% xylene cyanol) was added, and mixes were resolved at 10°C on native 20% PAGE using 44 mM Tris-borate and 1 mM MgCl2 running buffer for ∼4 h at 122 W. Gels were quantitatively imaged using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. The log linear range of the assay was determined (not shown) to cover from 50 pM to 10 μM in apparent Kd′ for antisense oligonucleotides. HCV transcript was prepared as above except that it encompassed the first 5′ 1.4-kilobase pairs. Heterologous control truncated intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (tr-ICAM-1) transcript was synthesized similarly (3Dean N.M. McKay R. Condon T.P. Bennett C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16416-16424Google Scholar). In vitro translation (IVT) reactions contained (in 15 μl) 300 ng of HCV RNA (44 nM final concentration), 100 ng of tr-ICAM-1 RNA (30 nM final concentration), 5 μl rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega), 8.8 μCi of [35S]methionine (1175 Ci/mmol), 13 μM IVT amino acid mix minus methionine (Promega), 8 units of RNasin, and oligonucleotides (30 nM to 1 μM). Before mixing, RNAs were heated at 65°C for 5 min and then at 37°C for 15 min. Reaction mixes were incubated at 37°C for 1 h and then quenched with an equal volume of Laemmli gel loading buffer, boiled for 8 min, and placed on ice. After microcentrifuging for 8 min, samples were electrophoresed on a 14% polyacrylamide gel (Novex) for 2 h at 125 V. Gels were fixed (10% propanol, 5% acetic acid, 3% glycerol, 20 min), vacuum-dried, and subjected to PhosphorImager analysis. Simian virus 40 large tumor antigen-immortalized human hepatocytes H8Ad-17c (41Ueno T. Miyamura T. Saito I. Mizuno K. Hum. Cell. 1993; 6: 126-135Google Scholar) were selected for expression of HCV sequences after calcium phosphate-mediated transfection with a neomycin resistance expression vector containing HCV type II sequences (nt 1-1357, including the 5′-NCR, core protein, and the majority of the envelope protein E1 genes) fused to the human cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter (35Hanecak R. Brown-Driver V. Fox M.C. Azad R.F. Furusako S. Nozaki C. Ford C. Sasmor H. Anderson K.P. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5203-5212Google Scholar). HCV sequence-expressing H8Ad-17c cells were seeded into six-well dishes at a density of 5 × 105 cells/well, rinsed once with Optimem (Life Technologies, Inc.), treated with oligonucleotides for 4 h in the presence of 5 μg/ml N-[1(−2,3-dioley(oxy)propyl]-n,n,n-trimethylammonium chloride, and then rinsed once and refed with growth medium. Cells were lysed in 1 × Laemmli sample buffer 18-20 h after treatment with oligonucleotide and then boiled, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation. Proteins were separated on 16% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polydivinylfluoride membrane. Western blots were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% normal goat serum and 0.3% Tween 20, were probed with a polyclonal antibody derived from serum taken from an HCV type II-positive patient and a monoclonal antibody to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (Advanced Immunochemical), rinsed, and incubated with 125I-radiolabeled goat anti-human antibody, and immunoreactive proteins were subjected to PhosphorImager analysis. HCV RNA levels were not measured, because they previously have been shown not to be reduced by antisense oligonucleotides uniformly modified with 2′-substitutions that do not support RNase H activity (35Hanecak R.

We used short (10-mer) DNA libraries in order to restrict the library complexity (calculated as 410 = 1,048,576 sequences) so that all possible sequences would be synthesized with equimolar base representation at each sequence position and in equivalent and sufficient amounts (40Davis P. Ecker D.J. Pinilla C. Houghton R.A. Methods in Molecular and Cellular Biology 40. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1996: 23-33Google Scholar). The use of short oligonucleotide libraries also avoids negatively biasing selections for suboptimal recognition with long oligonucleotides, as was discussed earlier (9Wagner R.W. Nature. 1994; 372: 333-335Google Scholar, 10Woolf T.M. Melton D.A. Jennings C.G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7305-7309Google Scholar, 11Stein C.A. Krieg A.M. Antisense Res.

Med. 1996; 2: 643-648Google Scholar), keeps the heteroduplex affinity at the selected preferred sites within the operational range of measurement of readily accessible assays in order to facilitate subsequent quantitative optimization, and attenuates the stability of intramolecular interactions (i.e. stem-loops) of library sequences. Short oligonucleotides with very stable internal structure will diminish the affinity of hybridization with RNA (7Freier S.M. Crooke S.T. Lebleu B. Antisense Research and Applications. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1993: 67-82Google Scholar, 8Chastain M. Tinoco I. Crooke S.T. Lebleu B. Antisense Research and Applications.

Unlike libraries of other nucleic acid screening strategies, the libraries used in this strategy have no internal fixed sequence positions (42Ecker D.J. Vickers T.A. Hanecak R. Driver V. Anderson K.

https://openalex.org/W2045960840,"μ opioid receptors mediate the analgesia induced by morphine. Prolonged use of morphine causes tolerance development and dependence. To investigate the molecular basis of tolerance and dependence, the cloned mouse μ opioid receptor with an amino-terminal epitope tag was stably expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, and the effects of prolonged opioid agonist treatment on receptor regulation were examined. In HEK 293 cells the expressed μ receptor showed high affinity, specific, saturable binding of radioligands and a pertussis toxin-sensitive inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. Pretreatment (1 h, 3 h, or overnight) of cells with 1 μM morphine or [D-Ala2MePhe4,Gly(ol)5]enkephalin (DAMGO) resulted in no apparent receptor desensitization, as assessed by opioid inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP levels. In contrast, the morphine and DAMGO pretreatments (3 h) resulted in a 3-4-fold compensatory increase in forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation. The opioid agonists methadone and buprenorphine are used in the treatment of addiction because of a markedly lower abuse potential. Pretreatment of μ receptor-expressing HEK 293 cells with methadone or buprenorphine abolished the ability of opioids to inhibit adenylyl cyclase. No compensatory increase in forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation was found with methadone or buprenorphine; these opioids blocked the compensatory effects observed with morphine and DAMGO. Taken together, these results indicate that methadone and buprenorphine interact differently with the mouse μ receptor than either morphine or DAMGO. The ability of methadone and buprenorphine to desensitize the μ receptor and block the compensatory rise in forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation may be an underlying mechanism by which these agents are effective in the treatment of morphine addiction. μ opioid receptors mediate the analgesia induced by morphine.

Opioid agonists are the therapeutic choice in the management of severe chronic pain (1Herz, A., (ed) (1993) Opioids I, Handbook of Experimental Therapeutics, Vol. 104, Springer-Verlag, New York.Google Scholar). Despite effective analgesic benefit, extended periods of opioid treatment can result in a range of undesirable side effects, not the least of which is the development of tolerance. Opioids such as morphine demonstrate potent and stereoselective effects that are reversed by selective antagonists, suggesting an interaction with a specific membrane receptor (1Herz, A., (ed) (1993) Opioids I, Handbook of Experimental Therapeutics, Vol. 104, Springer-Verlag, New York.Google Scholar). Selective, saturable, and high affinity membrane binding sites were subsequently demonstrated by radioligand binding assays on native tissue preparations (1Herz, A., (ed) (1993) Opioids I, Handbook of Experimental Therapeutics, Vol. 104, Springer-Verlag, New York.Google Scholar). Martin et al. (2Martin W.R. Eades C.G. Thompson J.A. Huppler R.E. Gilbert P.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1976; 197: 517-532Google Scholar) proposed the hypothesis of multiple opioid classes and defined μ receptors as the site of morphine action. The classification of opioid receptors into μ, κ, and ∆ was subsequently reinforced by the development of highly selective ligands for each class (3Reisine T. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 463-472Google Scholar). Recently, the genetic basis for the three opioid classes was obtained, with the molecular cloning of the ∆, κ, and μ opioid receptors (for review, see 4Reisine T. Bell G. Trends Neurosci. 1993; 16: 506-510Google Scholar). Of the three opioid receptor classes, the μ receptor is thought to be the principal site of analgesic interaction, since most of the clinically relevant opioids used in pain management bind to this receptor with high affinity (5Raynor K. Kong H. Chen Y. Yasuda K. Yu L. Bell G.I. Reisine T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 330-334Google Scholar, 6Raynor K. Kong H. Mestek A. Bye L.S. Tian M. Liu J. Yu L. Reisine T. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Studies on the μ receptor offer potential molecular insights into the cellular basis for tolerance and dependence, serious side effects of prolonged opioid usage which may result from effects on receptor regulation (8Nestler E. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 2439-2450Google Scholar). Whereas morphine induces dependence, methadone is used in the treatment of opioid addiction, despite being a full agonist at the μ receptor (9Reisine T. Pasternak G. Hardman J.G. Limbird L.E. Molinoff P.B. Ruddon R.W. Gilman A.G. The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics. McGraw-Hill, New York1996: 521-555Google Scholar). The therapeutic efficacy of methadone has been linked to a lower abuse potential, although it is not established why methadone has lower addictive properties than morphine. Buprenorphine is the other opioid agent used in the treatment of addiction and has not been found to precipitate withdrawal in animal and human studies (9Reisine T. Pasternak G. Hardman J.G. Limbird L.E. Molinoff P.B. Ruddon R.W. Gilman A.G. The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics. McGraw-Hill, New York1996: 521-555Google Scholar, 10Cowan, A., Lewis, J. W., (eds) (1995) Buprenorphine: Combating Drug Abuse with a Unique Opioid, Wiley-Liss, New York.Google Scholar). Buprenorphine has been reported to be a partial agonist or mixed agonist/antagonist at the μ receptor, and these properties have been implicated as the basis for addiction therapy (10Cowan, A., Lewis, J. W., (eds) (1995) Buprenorphine: Combating Drug Abuse with a Unique Opioid, Wiley-Liss, New York.Google Scholar). Despite the clinical importance of tolerance development and dependence, relatively little is known about the molecular and cellular events induced by morphine (8Nestler E. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 2439-2450Google Scholar). Also, the cellular events that accompany the therapeutic actions of methadone and buprenorphine in treating addiction are poorly understood. The recent cloning and heterologous expression of the μ receptor have facilitated attempts to determine the biochemical mechanisms of clinically used opioids. In this study we investigated the molecular consequences of prolonged opioid agonist exposure on the cloned murine μ receptor stably expressed in HEK 1The abbreviations used are: HEKhuman embryonic kidneyDAMGO, [D-Ala2MePhe4,Gly(ol)5]enkephalinGTPγSguanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphateANOVAanalysis of variance. 293 cells. Continuous treatment of the μ receptor with morphine or DAMGO does not appear to desensitize the receptor, but it does result in an adaptive cellular response that is manifested by an increase in forskolin-stimulated intracellular cAMP levels. In contrast, methadone and buprenorphine treatments result in a pronounced desensitization of the μ receptor while also blocking the compensatory increases in forskolin-stimulated cAMP levels observed with either morphine or DAMGO. These differential actions of opioid agonists at the μ receptor may explain the mechanism by which morphine induces dependence, whereas methadone and buprenorphine are effective therapeutic agents in the treatment of dependence. human embryonic kidney MePhe4,Gly(ol)5]enkephalin guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate analysis of variance. HEK 293 cells were grown and maintained in minimal essential medium with Earle's salts (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1,000 units ml–1 penicillin and streptomycin sulfate in 10% CO2 at 37†C. The mouse μ opioid receptor gene modified with the FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) at the amino terminus was a gift from Dr. Mark von Zastrow, University of California at San Francisco. The modified cDNA in the expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) was stably transfected into HEK 293 cells by a modification of the calcium phosphate protocol (11Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK 293 cell monolayers at approximately 70% confluence in T 75-cm2 flasks were transfected with 30 μg of plasmid. After an overnight incubation, the medium was removed, and the cells were treated with 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% glycerol for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 3 h at 37†C with growth medium containing 100 μg ml–1 chloroquine. Cells were then washed twice and incubated for 48 h at 37†C in growth medium. Stable transformants were selected in growth medium containing 1 mg ml–1 Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.) and maintained in T 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks in 10% CO2 at 37†C. Receptor binding studies were performed using membranes from stably transfected HEK 293 cells expressing the μ-FLAG cDNA. Membranes were prepared and receptor binding studies conducted as described (5Raynor K. Kong H. Chen Y. Yasuda K. Yu L. Bell G.I. Reisine T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 330-334Google Scholar) and as noted in the table and figure legends. Briefly, cell monolayers were harvested in 6 ml of buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) containing 1 mM EGTA, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 μg ml–1 leupeptin, 10 μg ml–1 pepstatin, 200 μg ml–1 bacitracin, and 0.5 μg ml–1 aprotinin and placed on ice. A cell pellet was prepared by centrifugation at 24,000 × g for 7 min at 4†C and was homogenized in the same buffer using a Polytron (Brinkmann Instruments) at setting 2.5, 30 s. The cell homogenate was centrifuged for at 48,000 × g for 20 min at 4†C, and the resulting cell pellet was homogenized and placed on ice for the binding assays. Binding assays were carried out at 25†C for 40 min in a final volume of 200 μl in the presence or absence of competing ligands. For agonist pretreatment studies, a 10-fold concentrated stock of agonist was diluted into growth medium and added to individual culture flasks. The final concentration of all agonists used in regulation studies was 1 μM. Cell monolayers were harvested at the times indicated in the table and figure legends. Pertussis toxin treatments were carried out either in tissue culture flasks or 12-well plates overnight at 37†C with 100 ng ml–1 pertussis toxin (List Biological Laboratories, Campbell, CA). Stably transfected HEK 293 cells were subcultured in 12-well culture plates and allowed to recover for 72 h prior to experiments. For agonist pretreatment and pertussis toxin experiments, the growth medium was replaced for the times indicated in the figure legends with medium containing either ligand or pertussis toxin. After treatment, the medium was removed and replaced with 1 ml of growth medium containing 0.5 mM isobutylmethylxanthine, and the cells were incubated for 30 min at 37†C. The culture medium was then removed and replaced with fresh medium, with or without 10 μM forskolin and opioids, and the cells were transferred to 37†C. After 5 min the medium was removed, 1.0 ml of 0.1 N HCl was added, and the monolayers were frozen at –20†C. For determination of the cAMP content of each well, the monolayers were thawed, placed on ice, sonicated, and the intracellular cAMP levels measured by radioimmunoassay (Amersham plc, Buckinghamshire, UK). Data obtained from the dose-response curves were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis with GraphPad Prism 2.01 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). The monoclonal antibody M2 against the FLAG epitope was purchased from Eastman Kodak. Antibody radioiodination was performed by a chloramine-T procedure (12Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Briefly, 250 μg of M2 antibody was incubated in 200 mM NaPO4 buffer (pH 7.3) with 0.5 mCi of Na125I and the reaction initiated with 100 μl of chloramine T (0.5 mg ml–1 in NaPO4 buffer). After 30 s at room temperature, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 100 μl of sodium metabisulfite (1.25 mg ml–1 in NaPO4 buffer). The iodinated protein was separated from free 125I by column chromatography with Sephadex G-25, and aliquots from the collected fractions were counted in an LKB γ scintillation counter and then stored at 4†C. After agonist treatment of cell monolayers, approximately 200,000 cpm of 125I-M2 antibody was added to individual wells in 24-well plates in growth medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were incubated for 30 min at 37†C, the medium aspirated, and the monolayers washed twice with growth medium. Bound radioactivity was determined after solubilization of the cell monolayer with 0.5 ml of 0.5 N NaOH and counted in a γ scintillation counter. Nonspecific radiolabeled antibody binding was determined in the presence of 10 μM FLAG peptide (Eastman Kodak) and accounted for 30% or less of the total binding. Cell monolayers were pretreated with the selective μ receptor agonists DAMGO, morphine, and methadone and the nonselective opioids levorphanol, etorphine, and buprenorphine. The chemical structures of these opioid ligands are shown in Fig. 1. To investigate the prolonged effects of opioid agonist treatment, we stably expressed the mouse μ receptor in HEK 293 cells. Pharmacological characterization of the stably transformed cells showed saturable, high affinity binding for selective μ opioid ligands, which was best defined as a single, noninteracting site (Table I). Saturation radioligand binding with the nonselective opioid antagonist [3H]diprenorphine revealed a μ receptor density (Bmax) of 7.7 ±; 0.5 pmol mg–1 membrane protein with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.61 ±; 0.14 nM (n = 3). No specific radioligand binding was detected in untransfected HEK 293 cells (data not shown). Competition binding experiments with the selective μ peptide agonist [3H]DAMGO showed that the cloned and expressed mouse μ receptor shared some pharmacological characteristics with the previously characterized rat and human μ receptors (6Raynor K. Kong H. Mestek A. Bye L.S. Tian M. Liu J. Yu L. Reisine T. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 272: 423-428Google Scholar, 7Rothman R.B. Xu H. Wang J.B. Partilla J.S. Kayakiri H. Rice K.C. Uhl G.R. Synapse. 1995; 21: 60-64Google Scholar). As shown in Table I, selective μ agonists such as morphine, DAMGO, and methadone showed specific, high affinity membrane binding, as did the nonselective opioid agonists levorphanol, etorphine, and buprenorphine. The affinity for buprenorphine was approximately 3-fold higher than reported previously by Raynor et al. (6Raynor K. Kong H. Mestek A. Bye L.S. Tian M. Liu J. Yu L. Reisine T. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 272: 423-428Google Scholar). This observed difference in affinity may reflect differences in the surrogate cell lines used (COS-7 in Raynor et al. (6Raynor K. Kong H. Mestek A. Bye L.S. Tian M. Liu J. Yu L. Reisine T. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 272: 423-428Google Scholar); HEK 293 cells in this study); the presence of the amino-terminal epitope tag; or differences inherent in the cloned and expressed human, rat, and mouse μ receptors. The rank order of potency for opioid agonists to displace [3H]DAMGO membrane binding at the epitope-tagged mouse μ receptor is etorphine ≫ levorphanol ≫ morphine = buprenorphine = DAMGO ≫ methadone (Table I).Table IBinding potencies of opioid ligands for membranes prepared from μ expressing HEK 293 cellsLigandKinMDAMGO1.58 ±; 0.28Morphine1.41 ±; 0.11Levorphanol0.40 ±; 0.17Etorphine0.10 ±; 0.003Methadone3.56 ±; 0.2Buprenorphine1.58 ±; 0.11 Open table in a new tab Previous studies from this and other laboratories have shown that the opioid receptors couple to the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity in HEK 293 cells (13Arden J.R. Segredo V. Wang Z. Lameh J. Sadee W. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1636-1645Google Scholar, 14Blake A.D. von Zastrow M. Freeman J. Reisine T. Soc. Neurosci. 1995; 21: 1350Google Scholar, 15Tsu R.C. Chan J.S.C. Wong Y.H. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 2700-2707Google Scholar). Consistent with the competition binding results, the opioid agonists were found to retain a similar rank order of potency when tested for the ability to inhibit forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation (Fig. 2A). The nonselective opioids etorphine and levorphanol were found to be the most potent, followed by the selective μ opioids DAMGO and morphine. Buprenorphine and methadone were the least potent for inhibiting cAMP accumulation (Fig. 2A). However, although buprenorphine appeared to be slightly more potent than methadone in the inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation, the maximal inhibition was significantly different from that of the other opioids examined in this study (p < 0.05, n = 10). The inability of buprenorphine to inhibit cAMP accumulation maximally in the HEK 293 cells is consistent with the partial agonist activity that has been described by others (9Reisine T. Pasternak G.

W., (eds) (1995) Buprenorphine: Combating Drug Abuse with a Unique Opioid, Wiley-Liss, New York.Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2B, the opioid agonist inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP was sensitive to pertussis toxin pretreatment. Overnight treatment of cell monolayers with 100 ng ml–1 pertussis toxin abolished the ability of morphine, levorphanol, or etorphine to inhibit cAMP accumulation. This suggests that the μ receptor inhibition of cAMP accumulation in HEK 293 cells couples to either the Gi or Go class of G proteins. The effects of morphine on the inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation were blocked by the nonselective opioid antagonist naloxone (Fig. 2C). [3H]DAMGO binding to the μ receptor was reduced by 100 μM GTPγS or by overnight treatment with pertussis toxin, in agreement with the effects observed on functional inhibition of cAMP accumulation (Fig. 3).Fig. 3Effects of the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog GTPγS, pertussis toxin (PTX), or agonist pretreatment on [3H]DAMGO binding to membranes prepared from mouse μ-FLAG-expressing HEK 293 cells. The reduction of high affinity [3H]DAMGO binding was examined after incubation with 100 μM GTPγS, overnight pretreatment (ON) with 100 ng ml–1 pertussis toxin, or a 3-h pretreatment with 1 μM opioid agonist. The results presented are the specific [3H]DAMGO bound and are the mean ±; S.E. of three or more independent experiments, each performed in duplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine the effects of agonist pretreatment on the mouse μ receptor, the reduction of [3H]DAMGO binding was used as a measure of receptor-G protein coupling. Using a 3-h agonist pretreatment protocol, the effects of the opioid agonists morphine, levorphanol, the synthetic peptide DAMGO, and the highly potent opioid etorphine were examined. In addition, two opioids currently used in the treatment of opioid addiction, methadone and buprenorphine, were also studied. Pretreatment with five of the six opioid agonists reduced high affinity [3H]DAMGO binding (Fig. 3). This suggests that pretreatment with these three opioids results in an apparent altered coupling of the μ receptor with G proteins in the HEK 293 cells. Since high affinity [3H]DAMGO binding is also reduced by overnight pertussis toxin treatment, the effects of the agonist pretreatment impair the coupling of the μ receptor to the Gi or Go class of G proteins in the HEK 293 cells. DAMGO pretreatment was found to have no effect on high affinity [3H]DAMGO binding (102 ±; 18%, n = 3). Buprenorphine and etorphine pretreatments appeared to abolish [3H]DAMGO binding relative to control binding (99 ±; 1% reduction, n = 4 for buprenorphine; 99 ±; 0.3% reduction, n = 3 for etorphine); and methadone, levorphanol, and morphine pretreatments reduced radiolabeled agonist binding (reductions of 79 ±; 13%, 73 ±; 6% and 35 ±; 8%, respectively, n = 3). The effects of buprenorphine were stereoselective, as (+) buprenorphine, the inactive stereoisomer, did not bind to the mouse μ receptor (data not shown). To determine the effects of agonist pretreatment on μ-FLAG receptor density, two independent studies were performed. The binding of [3H]diprenorphine, a nonselective opioid antagonist, was found to be decreased by four of the six agonist pretreatments examined, in agreement with the [3H]DAMGO studies (Fig. 4A). Morphine and DAMGO pretreatments had negligible effects on [3H]diprenorphine binding (reductions of 9 ±; 11% and 19 ±; 8%, respectively). And, whereas levorphanol reduced antagonist binding by 28 ±; 4%, methadone, buprenorphine, and etorphine pretreatments resulted in marked reductions in [3H]diprenorphine binding (61 ±; 12%, 99 ±; 1%, and 68 ±; 8%, respectively). Since etorphine and buprenorphine have been proposed to be highly lipophilic opioids (10Cowan, A., Lewis, J. W., (eds) (1995) Buprenorphine: Combating Drug Abuse with a Unique Opioid, Wiley-Liss, New York.Google Scholar), the dramatic reductions in [3H]diprenorphine binding may result from an irreversible component of the ligand binding that occurred during the 3-h pretreatment, making direct radioligand measurements inaccurate. To assess the effects of agonist pretreatment on receptor density independently of radioligand binding, an iodinated monoclonal antibody against the amino-terminal FLAG epitope was used. If the continued presence of the pretreatment agonist (e.g. buprenorphine) affected the affinity of [3H]diprenorphine binding, then the use of the radiolabeled M2 antibody should provide an alternative means to measure the cell surface receptor density. At present, the amino terminus of the mouse μ receptor is predicted to be an extracellular site not known to be directly involved in ligand binding (3Reisine T. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 463-472Google Scholar, 16Surratt C.K. Johnson P.S. Moriwaki A. Seidleck B.K. Blaschak C.J. Wang J.B. Uhl G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20548-20553Google Scholar, 17Wang W.W. Shahrestanifar M. Ji J. Howells R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12436-12440Google Scholar). Fig. 4B demonstrates that the binding of the radiolabeled M2 antibody to intact cell monolayers is unaffected by pretreatment with the agonists levorphanol (101 ±; 7% of control, n = 4), buprenorphine (109 ±; 7% of control, n = 8), or morphine binding (95 ±; 3% of control, n = 3), whereas DAMGO resulted in small decreases in antibody binding (83 ±; 5% of control, n = 4). In contrast, the 3-h pretreatment of cells with 1 μM etorphine resulted in a reduction of M2 binding to 64 ±; 6% (n = 8) of the untreated control (Fig. 4B). The antibody binding studies indicate that despite the ability of levorphanol, etorphine, DAMGO, methadone, and buprenorphine pretreatments to reduce high affinity [3H]diprenorphine binding, only DAMGO and etorphine pretreatments significantly reduced M2 antibody binding to the μ-FLAG receptor in HEK 293 cells. As shown in Fig. 5, the functional consequences of agonist pretreatment were examined on the inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation. Fig. 5A shows that the morphine inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase is dose-dependent over the concentration range of 10–11 to 10–6M. In untreated monolayers, a maximal inhibition of cAMP accumulation (75 ±; 8%, n = 8) was observed at 1 μM morphine. Three-hour or overnight morphine pretreatment appeared to have little additional effect on the EC50 of the morphine dose-response curve (Fig. 5A). However, the pretreatments did appear to enhance the maximal inhibitions observed at the 1 μM morphine concentration (93 ±; 5%, n = 7 and 92 ±; 5%, n = 4, inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation for 3-h and overnight pretreatments, respectively). Levorphanol also inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in a dose-dependent manner, with a maximal inhibition in control cells of 76 ±; 6% (n = 6) at 1 μM. In contrast to the effects of morphine pretreatment on morphine inhibition of cAMP accumulation, pretreatment of the HEK 293 cells with levorphanol did not appear to enhance the maximal cAMP inhibition (82 ±; 8%, n = 6, for 3-h pretreatment; 81 ±; 7%, n = 4, for overnight pretreatment), while having little effect on the observed agonist EC50 (Fig. 5B). In agreement with the morphine and levorphanol results, DAMGO (Fig. 5C) inhibition was also dose-dependent, with a maximal inhibition of 73 ±; 5% at 1 μM (n = 4). Unlike either morphine or levorphanol pretreatment, DAMGO pretreatment appeared to shift the EC50 for cAMP inhibition to higher concentrations, with the control EC50 = 3.3 ±; 1.9 nM (n = 4) and DAMGO-treated EC50 = 8.4 ±; 1.4 nM (n = 7). DAMGO pretreatment did not appear to enhance the maximal inhibition of cAMP accumulation by DAMGO (Fig. 5C). Levorphanol and DAMGO 3-h pretreatments resulted in a rightward shift (Fig. 5D) in the EC50 values for morphine inhibition of cAMP accumulation (10 ±; 1.3 nM, n = 8, for DAMGO pretreatment and 37 ±; 2 nM, n = 8, for levorphanol pretreatment). Neither pretreatment appeared to enhance the maximal inhibition of cAMP accumulation by morphine. Thus, although morphine and levorphanol pretreatments can reduce high affinity agonist binding, as assessed with [3H]DAMGO, these agonists do not cause a functional desensitization of the μ receptor. The inability of morphine, DAMGO, and levorphanol treatments to desensitize the response to forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation could be the result of the HEK 293 cells lacking critical cellular factors needed for opioid receptor desensitization. To test this possibility, HEK 293 cells were pretreated with etorphine, an extremely potent opioid (18Blane G.F. Boura A.L.A. Fitzgerald A.E. Lister R.E. Br. J. Pharmacol. Chemother. 1967; 30: 11-22Google Scholar, 19Kosterlitz, H. W., Collier, H. O. J., Villarreal, J. E., (eds) (1972) Agonist and Antagonist Action of Narcotic Analgesic Drugs, pp. 121–127, Macmillan, London.Google Scholar, 20Jasinski D.R. Griffith J.D. Carr C.B. Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. 1975; 17: 267-272Google Scholar). Etorphine pretreatment desensitized the mouse μ receptor in HEK 293 cells (Fig. 6A). The 3-h etorphine exposure resulted in a rightward shift of the etorphine dose-response curve (control EC50 = 0.044 ±; 0.001 nM, n = 6; treated EC50 = 2.1 ±; 1 nM, n = 7) as well as a substantial reduction in the levels of maximal inhibition (control, 86 ±; 3%; treated, 14 ±; 12%). These results suggest that the mouse μ receptor expressed in HEK 293 cells can undergo desensitization when pretreated with the potent opioid etorphine. Although pretreatment of μ-FLAG-expressing HEK 293 cells with the clinically used analgesic morphine did not desensitize the μ receptor, a pronounced receptor desensitization was observed after pretreatment with methadone and buprenorphine, opioids used in the treatment of morphine and heroin dependence (Fig. 6, B and C). A 3-h pretreatment of cell monolayers with methadone resulted in a marked rightward shift in the EC50 for the methadone inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation (Fig. 6B; methadone control EC50 = 9.6 ±; 1.5 nM, n = 5; 3-h treated EC50 = 230 ±; 3.7 nM, n = 5). The 3-h methadone pretreatment reduced the maximal inhibition of cAMP accumulation (control, 84 ±; 6%, n = 7; 3-h pretreated, 55 ±; 6%, n = 5). Buprenorphine pretreatment (3 h) also resulted in receptor desensitization (Fig. 6C) at buprenorphine concentrations above 10–8M, with the maximal inhibition of cAMP accumulation reduced from 67 ±; 3% (n = 14) for control to 2 ±; 8% (n = 5) for treated cells. No effect on forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation was found with (+) buprenorphine (data not shown). The three opioid agonists etorphine, methadone, and buprenorphine also appeared to desensitize the effects of morphine on cAMP accumulation (Fig. 6D) by markedly reducing the ability of maximal concentrations of morphine to inhibit forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation. Methadone pretreatment appeared t"

Here we show that ectopic expression of each D-type cyclin is sufficient to inhibit the transcriptional activation of the muscle-specific creatine kinase (MCK) gene. In contrast, ectopic expression of cyclin A or cyclin E inhibits MCK expression only when they are co-expressed with their catalytic partner cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2). For each of these conditions, myogenic transcriptional inhibition is reversed by the ectopic co-expression of the general Cdk inhibitor p21. Inhibition of MCK expression by cyclins or cyclin-Cdk combinations correlates with E2F activation, suggesting that the inhibition is mediated by the overall Rb-kinase activities of the Cdk complexes. In support of this hypothesis, a hyperactive mutant of Rb was found to partially reverse the inhibition of MCK expression by cyclin D1 and by the combination of cyclin A and Cdk2. These data demonstrate that the inhibition of myogenic transcriptional activity is a general feature of overall Cdk activity which is mediated, at least in part, by an pocket protein/E2F-dependent pathway. MCK promoter activity is also inhibited by ectopic E2F1 expression, but this inhibition is not reversed by the co-expression of p21. Analyses of a series of E2F1 mutants revealed that the transcriptional activation, leucine zipper, basic, and cyclin A/Cdk2-binding domains are dispensable, but the helix-loop-helix region is essential for myogenic inhibition. These data demonstrate that myocyte proliferation and differentiation are coordinated at the level of E2F and that these opposing activities are regulated by different E2F domains.

INTRODUCTIONIrreversible cell cycle withdrawal is a key component of myogenic differentiation, but little is known about the interplay between the myogenic transcription factors and the cell cycle regulatory proteins. Previous studies have shown that the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene product (Rb) 1The abbreviations used are: Rbretinoblastoma susceptibility gene productMCKmuscle-specific creatine kinaseCdkcyclin-dependent kinaseLucluciferaseDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumCMVcytomegalovirusPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPBSphosphate-buffered saline. has an essential role in maintaining the postmitotic state of differentiated myotubes (1Gu W. Schneider J.W. Condorelli G. Nadal-Ginard B. Cell. 1993; 72: 309-324Google Scholar, 2Schneider J.W. Gu W. Zhu L. Mahdavi V. Nadal-Ginard B. Science. 1994; 264: 1467-1471Google Scholar). Rb is hypophosphorylated upon terminal differentiation and this state of dephosphorylation is maintained when differentiated myotubes are re-exposed to high mitogen media. Hypophosphorylated Rb inactivates the E2F transcription factor which is essential for the expression of genes required for DNA synthesis (3Nevins J.R. Science. 1992; 258: 424-429Google Scholar). Myocytes from Rb-deficient mice can differentiate into myotubes, but these myotubes can resynthesize DNA upon mitogen stimulation (2Schneider J.W. Gu W. Zhu L. Mahdavi V. Nadal-Ginard B. Science. 1994; 264: 1467-1471Google Scholar). The phosphorylation status of Rb is regulated, at least in part, by the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases including Cdk2 and Cdk4 (4Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Google Scholar). Recently, the general Cdk inhibitor p21 was shown to be dramatically induced during skeletal muscle differentiation, and a high level of p21 expression is sustained when myotubes are re-exposed to high mitogen media (5Parker S.B. Eichele G. Zhang P. Rawls A. Sands A.T. Bradley A. Olson E.N. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Science. 1995; 267: 1024-1027Google Scholar, 6Halevy O. Novitch B.G. Spicer D.B. Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Lassar A.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1018-1021Google Scholar, 7Guo K. Wang J. Andrés V. Smith R.C. Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3823-3829Google Scholar). p21 is induced early during the differentiation program (8Andrés V. Walsh K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 657-666Google Scholar), and its expression is critical for myocyte viability (9Wang J. Walsh K. Science. 1996; 273: 359-361Google Scholar). In myotubes, p21 is the predominant inhibitory subunit of the Cdk complex (7Guo K. Wang J. Andrés V. Smith R.C. Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3823-3829Google Scholar, 10Wang J. Walsh K. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 1471-1478Google Scholar). Thus p21 is likely to function to inhibit the phosphorylation of Rb or other Rb family members during myocyte differentiation.Surprisingly, it has been reported that overexpression of cyclin D1, but not cyclins A, B, D2, D3, or E, can block myogenesis as detected by the transcriptional activation of an MCK-reporter construct in transiently transfected cultures of differentiating C2C12 cells (11Rao S.S. Chu C. Kohtz D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5259-5267Google Scholar). More recently it was reported that the cyclin D1-mediated inhibition of myogenic transcriptional activation could be reversed by the co-expression of the Cdk inhibitors p21 or p16 (12Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Spicer D.B. Lassar A.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1022-1024Google Scholar). These data have led to the proposal that cyclin D1 down-regulation may be a nodal point in the coordination of myocyte differentiation and cell cycle activity. Further, it was proposed that myogenic inhibition by cyclin D1 occurs through an Rb-independent pathway because the overexpression of cyclin A or cyclin E, the regulatory subunits of the Cdk2 Rb-kinase, do not inhibit myogenesis (12Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Spicer D.B. Lassar A.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1022-1024Google Scholar).To test the hypothesis that cyclin D1 functions uniquely to coordinate cell cycle with myogenic transcription through an Rb-independent mechanism, we analyzed the effects of additional cell cycle regulatory molecules on the same MCK transcriptional assay that was employed in these previous studies (11Rao S.S. Chu C. Kohtz D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5259-5267Google Scholar, 12Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Spicer D.B. Lassar A.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1022-1024Google Scholar). Here we report that in addition to cyclin D1, the overexpression of other D-type cyclins (D2 and D3) or the combinations of Cdk2 and cyclin A or cyclin E also inhibit MCK transcriptional activation, and that this inhibition is reversed by the co-expression of p21. MCK transcription is inversely correlated with expression from an E2F-reporter gene construct, and a hyperactive Rb mutant partially reverses the cyclin-Cdk-mediated inhibition of MCK transcription. Collectively these data indicate that the inhibition of myogenic transcription by cell cycle components can be mediated by a pocket protein/E2F pathway. Myogenic transcription is also inhibited by the ectopic expression of the E2F1 transcription factor. Surprisingly, mutations in the activation, leucine zipper, basic, and cyclin A-Cdk2 binding domains of E2F1 have no effect on its ability to inhibit myogenic transcription, but this activity was abolished by mutations in the E2F1 helix-loop-helix region. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the inhibition of myogenesis is a general feature of cyclin-Cdk activity and that myogenic differentiation is coordinated with cell cycle activity at the level of E2F.DISCUSSIONHere we investigated the molecular links between cell cycle activity and myogenic differentiation. These analyses extend the studies of Rao et al. (11Rao S.S. Chu C. Kohtz D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5259-5267Google Scholar), which showed that the overexpression of cyclin D1, but not cyclins A, B, or E, represses MCK transcriptional activation, and the studies of Skapek et al. (12Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Spicer D.B. Lassar A.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1022-1024Google Scholar), which showed that the cyclin D1-mediated repression is overcome by the ectopic expression of Cdk inhibitors. Based upon these prior observations it was proposed that cyclin D1 functions uniquely to coordinate cell cycle withdrawal and myogenic differentiation through an Rb-independent mechanism (12Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Spicer D.B. Lassar A.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1022-1024Google Scholar). However, this hypothesis is not supported by the data from this current study. Here it is shown that the inhibition of myogenic transcription is a function shared by many cyclins or cyclin-Cdk combinations. Further, these data indicate that the inhibitory effects of the cyclin-Cdk complexes are largely mediated by Rb, or a related pocket proteins, and that the E2F transcription factor plays a central role in coordinating myogenic differentiation and cell cycle activity.Here it is shown that the overexpression of each D-type cyclin is sufficient to inhibit MCK promoter activity. However, the forced expression of cyclins A or E have little if any effect on MCK transcriptional activation (Fig. 2) (11Rao S.S. Chu C. Kohtz D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5259-5267Google Scholar, 12Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Spicer D.B. Lassar A.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1022-1024Google Scholar). To investigate the differential effects of these cyclins on myogenic transcriptional activation, the expression patterns of their cognate catalytic subunits were compared. During myogenesis the expression of the Cdk2 protein is markedly down-regulated, but Cdk4 levels do not detectably change (Fig. 4A) (also see 7Guo K. Wang J. Andrés V. Smith R.C. Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3823-3829Google Scholar, 11Rao S.S. Chu C. Kohtz D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5259-5267Google Scholar, and 12Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Spicer D.B. Lassar A.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1022-1024Google Scholar). Thus, we reasoned that cyclin A or cyclin E overexpression might inhibit myogenesis only when they are co-expressed with their catalytic partner Cdk2. On the other hand, overexpression of the D-type cyclins might be sufficient to block MCK transcription because their catalytic partner, Cdk4, is not down-regulated during myogenesis. Consistent with this hypothesis are the observations that MCK promoter activity is inhibited, albeit with different efficiencies, by the transfection of cyclin D1, D2, or D3 expression vectors (Fig. 3). MCK promoter activity was also inhibited by combinations of expression vectors for cyclin A and Cdk2 or cyclin E and Cdk2, but not by the transfection of these individual plasmids (Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4B). In all cases, the inhibition of MCK transcription was overcome by the co-expression of p21. Collectively, these data indicate MCK transcriptional inhibition is dependent on the overall cell cycle activity, rather than the action of an individual cell cycle component (i.e. cyclin D1). This hypothesis is consistent with the observation of an inverse correlation between MCK promoter expression and E2F transcriptional activity in cells transfected with different combinations of these cell cycle factors (Fig. 5).Vectors expressing hyperactive and inactive mutants of Rb were utilized to test the potential role of Rb (or a related pocket protein) as a mediator of myogenic transcriptional inhibition. Ectopic expression of the hyperactive (p56), but not an inactive (p56/H209), Rb mutant partially reversed the MCK transcriptional inhibition that resulted from the overexpression cyclin D1 or the combination of Cdk2 and cyclin A (Fig. 7C). These data further indicate that MCK transcription is inhibited by overall cell cycle activity and that this inhibition is mediated by the Rb/E2F pathway. This notion is further supported by the finding that E2F1 overexpression inhibits MCK transcription (Fig. 6) and overall myogenic differentiation (27Wang J. Helin K. Jin P. Nadal-Ginard B. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1299-1306Google Scholar). MCK promoter inhibition by E2F1 is reversed by the co-expression of the hyperactive Rb mutant, but not by p21 (Fig. 6, Fig. 7); presumably because E2F1 acts at a step that is downstream from p21 (28DeGregori J. Leone G. Ohtani K. Miron A. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2873-2887Google Scholar).The data from this study are consistent with the model depicted in Fig. 11. Various cyclins, through interactions with their catalytic subunits, inhibit the transcription of muscle-specific genes via the phosphorylation of Rb or other pocket proteins. This phosphorylation leads to the activation of the E2F family of transcription factors, which induce the expression of essential S-phase genes and also inhibit the expression of muscle-specific genes through an unknown mechanism. The induction of p21 during myogenesis, a broad-specificity Cdk inhibitor, enhances differentiation by blocking the action of multiple cyclin-Cdk complexes. Finally, E2F also activates the expression of cyclin A and cyclin E (29DeGregori J. Kowalik T. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 4215-4224Google Scholar), but this pathway appears to have a minimal effect on MCK transcription because the inhibition of MCK promoter activity by forced E2F1 expression is not reversed by p21.The data presented here suggest that E2F functions to coordinate the opposing cellular fates of proliferation and differentiation during myogenesis. Support for the hypothesis comes from the finding that different domains within E2F1 function to promote cell proliferation and inhibit myogenic differentiation (Fig. 8). The transcriptional activation, leucine zipper and helix-loop-helix domains are required for the expression of S phase genes and cell cycle progression. However, only the helix-loop-helix region of E2F1 is essential for the myogenic inhibitory activity, while other regions of the protein are dispensable (Fig. 10, Fig. 11). The inhibition of myogenic transcription by E2F1 overexpression may result from its ability to inactivate E proteins that are essential for myogenic differentiation. Further analyses on the mechanism of E2F-mediated inhibition of myogenic differentiation will be of interest. INTRODUCTIONIrreversible cell cycle withdrawal is a key component of myogenic differentiation, but little is known about the interplay between the myogenic transcription factors and the cell cycle regulatory proteins. Previous studies have shown that the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene product (Rb) 1The abbreviations used are: Rbretinoblastoma susceptibility gene productMCKmuscle-specific creatine kinaseCdkcyclin-dependent kinaseLucluciferaseDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumCMVcytomegalovirusPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPBSphosphate-buffered saline. has an essential role in maintaining the postmitotic state of differentiated myotubes (1Gu W. Schneider J.W. Condorelli G. Nadal-Ginard B. Cell. 1993; 72: 309-324Google Scholar, 2Schneider J.W. Gu W. Zhu L. Mahdavi V. Nadal-Ginard B. Science. 1994; 264: 1467-1471Google Scholar). Rb is hypophosphorylated upon terminal differentiation and this state of dephosphorylation is maintained when differentiated myotubes are re-exposed to high mitogen media. Hypophosphorylated Rb inactivates the E2F transcription factor which is essential for the expression of genes required for DNA synthesis (3Nevins J.R. Science. 1992; 258: 424-429Google Scholar). Myocytes from Rb-deficient mice can differentiate into myotubes, but these myotubes can resynthesize DNA upon mitogen stimulation (2Schneider J.W. Gu W. Zhu L. Mahdavi V. Nadal-Ginard B. Science. 1994; 264: 1467-1471Google Scholar). The phosphorylation status of Rb is regulated, at least in part, by the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases including Cdk2 and Cdk4 (4Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Google Scholar). Recently, the general Cdk inhibitor p21 was shown to be dramatically induced during skeletal muscle differentiation, and a high level of p21 expression is sustained when myotubes are re-exposed to high mitogen media (5Parker S.B.

Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 657-666Google Scholar), and its expression is critical for myocyte viability (9Wang J. Walsh K. Science. 1996; 273: 359-361Google Scholar). In myotubes, p21 is the predominant inhibitory subunit of the Cdk complex (7Guo K. Wang J. Andrés V. Smith R.C. Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3823-3829Google Scholar, 10Wang J. Walsh K. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 1471-1478Google Scholar). Thus p21 is likely to function to inhibit the phosphorylation of Rb or other Rb family members during myocyte differentiation.Surprisingly, it has been reported that overexpression of cyclin D1, but not cyclins A, B, D2, D3, or E, can block myogenesis as detected by the transcriptional activation of an MCK-reporter construct in transiently transfected cultures of differentiating C2C12 cells (11Rao S.S. Chu C. Kohtz D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5259-5267Google Scholar). More recently it was reported that the cyclin D1-mediated inhibition of myogenic transcriptional activation could be reversed by the co-expression of the Cdk inhibitors p21 or p16 (12Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Spicer D.B. Lassar A.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1022-1024Google Scholar). These data have led to the proposal that cyclin D1 down-regulation may be a nodal point in the coordination of myocyte differentiation and cell cycle activity. Further, it was proposed that myogenic inhibition by cyclin D1 occurs through an Rb-independent pathway because the overexpression of cyclin A or cyclin E, the regulatory subunits of the Cdk2 Rb-kinase, do not inhibit myogenesis (12Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Spicer D.B. Lassar A.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1022-1024Google Scholar).To test the hypothesis that cyclin D1 functions uniquely to coordinate cell cycle with myogenic transcription through an Rb-independent mechanism, we analyzed the effects of additional cell cycle regulatory molecules on the same MCK transcriptional assay that was employed in these previous studies (11Rao S.S. Chu C. Kohtz D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5259-5267Google Scholar, 12Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Spicer D.B. Lassar A.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1022-1024Google Scholar). Here we report that in addition to cyclin D1, the overexpression of other D-type cyclins (D2 and D3) or the combinations of Cdk2 and cyclin A or cyclin E also inhibit MCK transcriptional activation, and that this inhibition is reversed by the co-expression of p21. MCK transcription is inversely correlated with expression from an E2F-reporter gene construct, and a hyperactive Rb mutant partially reverses the cyclin-Cdk-mediated inhibition of MCK transcription. Collectively these data indicate that the inhibition of myogenic transcription by cell cycle components can be mediated by a pocket protein/E2F pathway. Myogenic transcription is also inhibited by the ectopic expression of the E2F1 transcription factor. Surprisingly, mutations in the activation, leucine zipper, basic, and cyclin A-Cdk2 binding domains of E2F1 have no effect on its ability to inhibit myogenic transcription, but this activity was abolished by mutations in the E2F1 helix-loop-helix region. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the inhibition of myogenesis is a general feature of cyclin-Cdk activity and that myogenic differentiation is coordinated with cell cycle activity at the level of E2F. Irreversible cell cycle withdrawal is a key component of myogenic differentiation, but little is known about the interplay between the myogenic transcription factors and the cell cycle regulatory proteins. Previous studies have shown that the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene product (Rb) 1The abbreviations used are: Rbretinoblastoma susceptibility gene productMCKmuscle-specific creatine kinaseCdkcyclin-dependent kinaseLucluciferaseDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumCMVcytomegalovirusPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPBSphosphate-buffered saline. has an essential role in maintaining the postmitotic state of differentiated myotubes (1Gu W. Schneider J.W. Condorelli G. Nadal-Ginard B. Cell. 1993; 72: 309-324Google Scholar, 2Schneider J.W. Gu W. Zhu L. Mahdavi V. Nadal-Ginard B. Science. 1994; 264: 1467-1471Google Scholar). Rb is hypophosphorylated upon terminal differentiation and this state of dephosphorylation is maintained when differentiated myotubes are re-exposed to high mitogen media. Hypophosphorylated Rb inactivates the E2F transcription factor which is essential for the expression of genes required for DNA synthesis (3Nevins J.R. Science. 1992; 258: 424-429Google Scholar). Myocytes from Rb-deficient mice can differentiate into myotubes, but these myotubes can resynthesize DNA upon mitogen stimulation (2Schneider J.W. Gu W. Zhu L. Mahdavi V. Nadal-Ginard B. Science. 1994; 264: 1467-1471Google Scholar). The phosphorylation status of Rb is regulated, at least in part, by the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases including Cdk2 and Cdk4 (4Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Google Scholar). Recently, the general Cdk inhibitor p21 was shown to be dramatically induced during skeletal muscle differentiation, and a high level of p21 expression is sustained when myotubes are re-exposed to high mitogen media (5Parker S.B.

DISCUSSIONHere we investigated the molecular links between cell cycle activity and myogenic differentiation. These analyses extend the studies of Rao et al. (11Rao S.S. Chu C. Kohtz D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5259-5267Google Scholar), which showed that the overexpression of cyclin D1, but not cyclins A, B, or E, represses MCK transcriptional activation, and the studies of Skapek et al. (12Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Spicer D.B. Lassar A.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1022-1024Google Scholar), which showed that the cyclin D1-mediated repression is overcome by the ectopic expression of Cdk inhibitors. Based upon these prior observations it was proposed that cyclin D1 functions uniquely to coordinate cell cycle withdrawal and myogenic differentiation through an Rb-independent mechanism (12Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Spicer D.B. Lassar A.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1022-1024Google Scholar). However, this hypothesis is not supported by the data from this current study. Here it is shown that the inhibition of myogenic transcription is a function shared by many cyclins or cyclin-Cdk combinations. Further, these data indicate that the inhibitory effects of the cyclin-Cdk complexes are largely mediated by Rb, or a related pocket proteins, and that the E2F transcription factor plays a central role in coordinating myogenic differentiation and cell cycle activity.Here it is shown that the overexpression of each D-type cyclin is sufficient to inhibit MCK promoter activity. However, the forced expression of cyclins A or E have little if any effect on MCK transcriptional activation (Fig. 2) (11Rao S.S. Chu C. Kohtz D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5259-5267Google Scholar, 12Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Spicer D.B. Lassar A.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1022-1024Google Scholar). To investigate the differential effects of these cyclins on myogenic transcriptional activation, the expression patterns of their cognate catalytic subunits were compared. During myogenesis the expression of the Cdk2 protein is markedly down-regulated, but Cdk4 levels do not detectably change (Fig. 4A) (also see 7Guo K. Wang J. Andrés V. Smith R.C. Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3823-3829Google Scholar, 11Rao S.S. Chu C. Kohtz D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5259-5267Google Scholar, and 12Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Spicer D.B. Lassar A.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1022-1024Google Scholar). Thus, we reasoned that cyclin A or cyclin E overexpression might inhibit myogenesis only when they are co-expressed with their catalytic partner Cdk2. On the other hand, overexpression of the D-type cyclins might be sufficient to block MCK transcription because their catalytic partner, Cdk4, is not down-regulated during myogenesis. Consistent with this hypothesis are the observations that MCK promoter activity is inhibited, albeit with different efficiencies, by the transfection of cyclin D1, D2, or D3 expression vectors (Fig. 3). MCK promoter activity was also inhibited by combinations of expression vectors for cyclin A and Cdk2 or cyclin E and Cdk2, but not by the transfection of these individual plasmids (Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4B). In all cases, the inhibition of MCK transcription was overcome by the co-expression of p21. Collectively, these data indicate MCK transcriptional inhibition is dependent on the overall cell cycle activity, rather than the action of an individual cell cycle component (i.e. cyclin D1). This hypothesis is consistent with the observation of an inverse correlation between MCK promoter expression and E2F transcriptional activity in cells transfected with different combinations of these cell cycle factors (Fig. 5).Vectors expressing hyperactive and inactive mutants of Rb were utilized to test the potential role of Rb (or a related pocket protein) as a mediator of myogenic transcriptional inhibition. Ectopic expression of the hyperactive (p56), but not an inactive (p56/H209), Rb mutant partially reversed the MCK transcriptional inhibition that resulted from the overexpression cyclin D1 or the combination of Cdk2 and cyclin A (Fig. 7C). These data further indicate that MCK transcription is inhibited by overall cell cycle activity and that this inhibition is mediated by the Rb/E2F pathway. This notion is further supported by the finding that E2F1 overexpression inhibits MCK transcription (Fig. 6) and overall myogenic differentiation (27Wang J. Helin K. Jin P. Nadal-Ginard B. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1299-1306Google Scholar). MCK promoter inhibition by E2F1 is reversed by the co-expression of the hyperactive Rb mutant, but not by p21 (Fig. 6, Fig. 7); presumably because E2F1 acts at a step that is downstream from p21 (28DeGregori J. Leone G. Ohtani K. Miron A. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2873-2887Google Scholar).The data from this study are consistent with the model depicted in Fig. 11. Various cyclins, through interactions with their catalytic subunits, inhibit the transcription of muscle-specific genes via the phosphorylation of Rb or other pocket proteins. This phosphorylation leads to the activation of the E2F family of transcription factors, which induce the expression of essential S-phase genes and also inhibit the expression of muscle-specific genes through an unknown mechanism. The induction of p21 during myogenesis, a broad-specificity Cdk inhibitor, enhances differentiation by blocking the action of multiple cyclin-Cdk complexes. Finally, E2F also activates the expression of cyclin A and cyclin E (29DeGregori J. Kowalik T. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 4215-4224Google Scholar), but this pathway appears to have a minimal effect on MCK transcription because the inhibition of MCK promoter activity by forced E2F1 expression is not reversed by p21.The data presented here suggest that E2F functions to coordinate the opposing cellular fates of proliferation and differentiation during myogenesis. Support for the hypothesis comes from the finding that different domains within E2F1 function to promote cell proliferation and inhibit myogenic differentiation (Fig. 8). The transcriptional activation, leucine zipper and helix-loop-helix domains are required for the expression of S phase genes and cell cycle progression. However, only the helix-loop-helix region of E2F1 is essential for the myogenic inhibitory activity, while other regions of the protein are dispensable (Fig. 10, Fig. 11). The inhibition of myogenic transcription by E2F1 overexpression may result from its ability to inactivate E proteins that are essential for myogenic differentiation. Further analyses on the mechanism of E2F-mediated inhibition of myogenic differentiation will be of interest. Here we investigated the molecular links between cell cycle activity and myogenic differentiation. These analyses extend the studies of Rao et al. (11Rao S.S. Chu C. Kohtz D.S. Mol. Cell.

In contrast to FPA, whose carboxyl terminus continues for another 46 amino acids beyond the nine shared residues, the FPB terminates after only one amino acid. The FPA isoform appears to arise by the failure to utilize a potential splice site, while a 3.2-kilobase pair intron is spliced out from the FP gene to generate the FPB isoform mRNA. The two isoforms have indistinguishable radioligand binding properties, but seem to differ in functional coupling to phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis.

There are five primary prostanoids, prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), PGF2α, prostaglandin I2 (PGI2), and thromboxane A2 (TXA2). Unique G-protein-coupled receptors have been cloned for each prostanoid, including four receptors specific for PGE2 (EP1-EP4) (2Pierce K.L. Gil D.W. Woodward D.F. Regan J.W. Trends Pharmacol.

To examine this possibility, we screened an ovine mid-cycle large cell corpus luteum library. Previously, we used this library to clone the ovine homologue (14Graves P.E. Pierce K.L. Bailey T.J. Rueda B.R. Gil D.W. Woodward D.F. Yool A.J. Hoyer P.B. Regan J.W. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3430-3436Google Scholar) of the human FP receptor (15Abramovitz M. Boie Y. Nguyen T. Rushmore T.H. Bayne M.A. Metters K.M. Slipetz D.M. Grygorczyk R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2632-2636Google Scholar) and found that the message for the FP receptor was highly abundant (∼0.1% of the total message). Using a combination of homology-based screening with the ovine FP receptor as a probe and PCR, we cloned a novel isoform of the FP receptor. This isoform, the FPB, is identical to the original (termed here the FPA isoform) throughout the seven-transmembrane domains, but diverges nine amino acids into the carboxyl terminus. Functionally, both isoforms are able to stimulate inositol phosphate (IP) accumulation to the same maximum, but the basal level of hydrolysis is 130% higher for the novel FPB isoform than for the original FPA isoform. A cDNA containing the complete coding sequence of the ovine FPA receptor (14Graves P.E. Pierce K.L. Bailey T.J. Rueda B.R. Gil D.W. Woodward D.F. Yool A.J. Hoyer P.B. Regan J.W. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3430-3436Google Scholar) was labeled with 32P by nick translation (Life Technologies, Inc.) and an ovine large cell corpus luteum library screened as described previously (14Graves P.E. Pierce K.L. Bailey T.J. Rueda B.R. Gil D.W. Woodward D.F. Yool A.J. Hoyer P.B. Regan J.W. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3430-3436Google Scholar). The library was plated at a density of ∼3400 plaques/plate (15 cm), and five plates were screened. From a total of 24 positives, 18 were isolated and each was placed in 250 μl of H2O. To differentiate possible carboxyl-terminal splice variants from the original FPA isoform, two rounds of PCR were used. In the first round, sense (nt 258-275) and antisense (nt 638-654) primers upstream of the putative sixth transmembrane domain were used. These primers were predicted to be specific for the common region of all FP isoforms. In the second round of PCR, a sense primer (nt 793-810) upstream of the sixth transmembrane domain and an antisense primer (nt 1168-1185) specific for the carboxyl terminus were used that could amplify the original FPA isoform but would be unlikely to yield products (at least of the predicted size) with carboxyl-terminal splice variants. The isolated positive plaques were vortexed for 15 s and lysed by three freeze/thaw cycles consisting of freezing in a dry ice/ethanol bath and thawing at 550C for 5 min. For each 50 μl PCR, 26 μl of the phage lysate was added to a 50 μl reaction containing final concentrations of 1 × PCR buffer I (Perkin-Elmer), 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma), 200 μM dNTPs (Perkin-Elmer), and 1 μM each primer. The samples were heated to 950C for 5 min, chilled on ice, 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer) were added, and 30 μl of mineral oil overlaid. The PCR conditions were as follows: an initial denaturation step at 950C for 2 min followed by 30 cycles at 950C for 30 s, 420C for 30 s, and 700C for 30 s. The PCRs were held at 40C until analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Clones that gave positive results in the first round of PCR, but negative results in the second round of PCR, were isolated using standard plaque purification techniques. The inserts were subcloned into pBluescript (Stratagene) and sequenced. One clone (KS+/FPB) that was otherwise identical to the FPA but diverged in the carboxyl terminus was identified. KS+/FPB lacked the first 69 bp of coding sequence, and a full-length clone was obtained by replacing a HindIII fragment from the original FPA isoform, KS+/FP (14Graves P.E. Pierce K.L. Bailey T.J. Rueda B.R. Gil D.W. Woodward D.F. Yool A.J. Hoyer P.B. Regan J.W. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3430-3436Google Scholar), with a HindIII fragment from KS+/FPB. KS+/FP and KS+/FPB were restricted with HindIII which cuts at nt 638 (Fig. 1, single underlining) and in the multiple cloning site of KS+ downstream of the FPB coding sequence. The large fragment containing KS+ plus the 5ʹ end of the FPA receptor and the small fragment containing the 3ʹ end of FPB from the FPB digestion were isolated using Geneclean II (BIO 101, Inc.), ligated, subcloned, and KS+/FPB/fulcod isolated. To make an expression vector, KS+/FPB/fulcod was restricted with NaeI, which cuts at nt 80, and NcoI, which cuts at nt 1213, filled in using Klenow and subcloned into the blunted BamHI/HindIII sites of pBC12BI (16Cullen B.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 684-704Google Scholar) to form pBC/FPB/fulcod. PCR of sheep genomic DNA was performed using the Advantage Genomic PCR kit (Clontech). For both the FPA and the FPB receptor, the sense primer corresponded to nt 1018-1044. For the FPA receptor, the antisense primer corresponded to nt 1291-1317, and for the FPB receptor, the antisense primer corresponded to nt 1078-1104. Each 50-μl reaction contained 2 μl of sheep genomic DNA (∼200 ng total), 1 × 10 Tth PCR buffer, 1.1 mM Mg(OAC)2, 1 μM each primer, 200 μM dNTPs, and 1 μl of Advantage Tth Polymerase Mix (50 ×). 40 μl of mineral oil was overlaid, and the PCR program used was as follows: 950C for 1 min, 35 cycles at 950C for 15 s, 680C for 12 min, followed by a final extension at 680C for 12 min. The reactions were held at 150C until analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Total RNA (∼5 μg) from a day 10 ovine corpus luteum was reverse-transcribed in a 20-μl reaction using reverse transcriptase (Superscript II, Life Technologies, Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions using 200 ng of random hexamer primers. After the cDNA synthesis, RNA remaining in RNA-DNA duplexes was degraded by adding ∼1 unit of RNase H and incubating for 30 min at 370C. For the PCR, 2 μl of the cDNA reaction was added to a 50-μl reaction containing 10% dimethyl sulfoxide, 0.25 mM dNTPs (Perkin-Elmer), 1 μM each primer, 1 × PCR buffer, and 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer). The PCR program was as follows: a 7-min denaturation step at 950C, 36 cycles at 950C for 1 min, 550C for 1 min, and 720C for 1 min, followed by 7 min at 720C, and the reaction was held at 40C. Receptor-mediated PI hydrolysis was determined by measuring the accumulation of IPs in cells that were preincubated with myo-[2-3H]inositol (17-18 Ci/mmol, Amersham Corp.). COS-7 cells were plated in 10-cm dishes (106 cells/dish) in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum) and transfected the following day with the expression plasmids pBC/FPA or pBC/FPB/fulcod (4 μg/dish), using Lipofectin (40 μg/dish, Life Technologies, Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. On day 3, the cells were incubated with 3 μC/ml myo-[2-3H]inositol in DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were harvested on the following day, preincubated for 10 min in DMEM containing 25 mM HEPES buffer, 10 mM LiCl in order to block the dephosphorylation of IPs and aliquoted (200 μl) with various concentrations of drug (50 μl) in duplicate. After a 30-min, 370C incubation, IPs were extracted with 750 μl of chloroform/methanol/4 N HCl (100:200:2). An additional 250 μl each of the chloroform and 0.5 N HCl were added, and the samples were vortexed. Unincorporated myo-[2-3H]inositol was removed by adding 750 μl of the resulting aqueous layer to a Dowex 1-X8 (formate, 100-200 mesh, Bio-Rad) anion exchange column. Following three washes with 3 ml of 5 mM inositol, the IPs were eluted with 1.5 ml 1.3 M ammonium formate, 0.1 M formic acid and counts/min were determined by liquid scintillation counting. We screened an ovine mid-cycle large cell luteal library with the previously cloned ovine FP receptor (14Graves P.E. Pierce K.L. Bailey T.J. Rueda B.R. Gil D.W. Woodward D.F. Yool A.J. Hoyer P.B. Regan J.W. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3430-3436Google Scholar) and used PCR to identify possible carboxyl-terminal alternative mRNA splice variants. From a total of 17,000 plaques, one putative alternative splice variant was identified. We have designated this clone FPB, in contrast to the original isoform which we now define as FPA. Fig. 1 shows the cDNA and deduced amino acid sequence of the ovine FPA and FPB isoforms. The FPA and FPB isoforms share the same sequence until they diverge nine amino acids into the carboxyl terminus. In the original isoform, the FPA, the carboxyl terminus continues for 46 amino acids beyond the splice site, while in the FPB isoform there is only one additional amino acid. Thus, the FPB is truncated relative to the FPA isoform. The immediate 3ʹ-untranslated region of the mRNAs encoding these isoforms differ as well. To determine how the two FP receptor isoforms arose, PCR was performed on sheep genomic DNA using primers that spanned the proposed splice site. The same sense primer (nt 1018-1044) was used in both reactions in combination with an antisense primer specific to each isoform (FPA, nt 1291-1317; FPB, nt 1078-1104). A picture of the agarose gel on which the reactions were electrophoresed is shown in Fig. 2. Lane 1 shows the size of the product obtained with the FPA-specific primer, and lane 2 shows the size of the product obtained with the FPB-specific primer. Thus, amplification with the FPA-specific primer yielded a product of ∼300 bp, which is identical to the size predicted from the cDNA. Amplification with the FPB-specific primer, however, yielded a 3200-bp product. This product is much larger than the 86-bp product that would be expected from amplification of the FPB cDNA. To verify that the message for the FPB was expressed in corpus luteum, RT-PCR was performed on mRNA obtained from a mid-cycle corpus luteum using primers flanking the coding region of the FPB isoform. The sense primer corresponded to nt 88-111, and included the codon for the initiator methionine, and the antisense primer corresponded to nt 1081-1098 of the FPB receptor, downstream of the stop codon. Fig. 3 shows a photograph of the ethidium-stained agarose gel with the products of the PCR. Lane 1 is the product obtained from the ovine corpus luteum cDNA, lane 2 shows a positive control in which KS+/FPB/fulcod plasmid DNA was amplified with the same pair of primers, and lane 3 is the negative control. For both the ovine corpus luteum cDNA and the plasmid positive control, a product of the expected size, 1010 bp, was obtained. To verify that this 1010-bp product encoded the full-length FPB isoform, the bands from lanes 1 and 2 were isolated and digested with HindIII, which yielded products of the expected size, 459 and 551 bp. based on the presence of a HindIII site at nt 638 (data not shown). To examine the pharmacology of the FPB clone, radioligand binding was performed using membranes from COS-7 cells that were transiently transfected with pBC/FPB/fulcod. Fig. 4 shows radioligand binding competition curves using 17-[3H]phenyl-trinor-PGF2α as the radioligand. The ability of a series of natural and synthetic prostanoids to displace 17-[3H]phenyl-trinor-PGF2α binding was measured, and the rank order of potencies of the competitors was as follows: 17-phenyl-trinor-PGF2α > PGF2α > fluprostenol > PGD2 = PGE2≫ 8-epi-PGF2α. Thus, the synthetic prostanoid, 17-phenyl-trinor-PGF2α, is the most potent with an EC50 of ∼10 nM, while PGF2α is the most potent natural prostanoid, with an EC50 of ∼40 nM, although both PGD2 and PGE2 were also able to displace 17-[3H]phenyl-trinor-PGF2α binding. These results are nearly indistinguishable from those obtained for the FPA under similar conditions (14Graves P.E. Pierce K.L. Bailey T.J. Rueda B.R. Gil D.W. Woodward D.F. Yool A.J. Hoyer P.B. Regan J.W. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3430-3436Google Scholar). Since the FP receptor cloned from other species activates PI hydrolysis (17Sakamoto K. Ezashi T. Miwa K. Okuda-Ashitaka E. Houtani T. Sugimoto T. Ito S. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3881-3886Google Scholar, 18Sugimoto Y. Hasumoto K.-Y. Namba T. Irie A. Katsuyama M. Negishi M. Kakizuka A. Narumiya S. Ichikawa A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1356-1360Google Scholar), we wanted to determine whether the ovine FPA and FPB isoforms could also stimulate IP accumulation and whether there were any differences between the isoforms. Fig. 5 shows the results of experiments performed on COS-7 cells that were transiently transfected with the FPA (14Graves P.E. Pierce K.L. Bailey T.J. Rueda B.R. Gil D.W. Woodward D.F. Yool A.J. Hoyer P.B. Regan J.W. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3430-3436Google Scholar) or the FPB and treated with different concentrations of PGF2α. IP accumulation was normalized to the basal level of IP accumulation for the FPA. PGF2α did not stimulate IP formation in untransfected cells. For cells expressing either the FPA or FPB, PGF2α was able to elicit the same maximal level of IP accumulation, 220% over basal, and the EC50 was similar for the two isoforms, 8 nM for the FPA and 11 nM for the FPB isoform. However, the basal level of IP accumulation was ∼130% higher in cells expressing the FPB isoform than in cells expressing the FPA, which in turn was ∼140% higher than the basal level of hydrolysis in untransfected cells (data not shown). Based on radioligand binding competition studies, the level of receptor expression was higher for cells expressing the FPA receptor than for cells expressing the FPB receptor. In addition, similar experiments were repeated in COS-P cells, with essentially the same findings. Previously, we and others reported the cloning of the FP prostanoid receptor from bovine (17Sakamoto K. Ezashi T. Miwa K. Okuda-Ashitaka E. Houtani T. Sugimoto T. Ito S. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3881-3886Google Scholar), human (15Abramovitz M. Boie Y. Nguyen T. Rushmore T.H. Bayne M.A. Metters K.M. Slipetz D.M. Grygorczyk R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2632-2636Google Scholar), mouse (18Sugimoto Y. Hasumoto K.-Y. Namba T. Irie A. Katsuyama M. Negishi M. Kakizuka A. Narumiya S. Ichikawa A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1356-1360Google Scholar), and ovine (14Graves P.E. Pierce K.L. Bailey T.J. Rueda B.R. Gil D.W. Woodward D.F. Yool A.J. Hoyer P.B. Regan J.W. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3430-3436Google Scholar). Here we report the cloning of the FPB, an isoform of the ovine FP receptor. Isoforms have been reported for the EP3 and TP prostanoid receptors, but this is the first report of isoforms of the FP receptor. Like the EP3 and TP receptor isoforms, the FP receptor isoforms diverge in the carboxyl termini. Thus far, two isoforms of the human TP receptor (6Raychowdhury M.K. Yukawa M. Collins L.J. McGrail S.H. Kent K.C. Ware J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19256-19261Google Scholar) have been cloned, while a total of 13 different isoforms of the EP3 receptor have been cloned among bovine, human, rabbit, and mouse (2Pierce K.L. Gil D.W. Woodward D.F. Regan J.W. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 253-256Google Scholar). The existence of FP receptor isoforms was hypothesized based on previously cloned EP3 and TP receptor isoforms and relationships established by the phylogenetic analysis of the prostanoid receptors. This analysis places the DP, EP2, EP4, and IP receptors in one branch and the remaining EP1, EP3, FP, and TP receptors in the second. With the cloning of the FPB, isoforms have now been found for three of the four receptors in the second branch. Isoforms have not yet been reported for the EP1 receptor, but the phylogenetic relationships suggest that they, too, may exist. Interestingly, the existence of isoforms also seems to correlate with second messenger coupling. Thus, the receptors in the second branch where isoforms have been reported are all primarily coupled to either PI hydrolysis or inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, while isoforms have not been obtained for the receptors in the first branch, which are all coupled to stimulation of adenylyl cyclase. The TP and EP3 receptor isoforms arise by alternative mRNA splicing at a location that is homologous to the site at which the FP isoforms diverge, suggesting that the FP receptor isoforms are also generated by alternative mRNA splicing. In the case of the TP receptor isoforms, the isoforms arise by the failure to utilize a potential splice site (6Raychowdhury M.K. Yukawa M. Collins L.J. McGrail S.H. Kent K.C. Ware J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19256-19261Google Scholar). Thus, the sequence of the carboxyl terminus of the endothelial variant is identical to the genomic sequence, while this sequence is spliced out to form the placental variant. It appears that the same mechanism generates the two FP receptor isoforms. Using the primers specific for the FPA receptor, the PCR product obtained from the genomic DNA is identical to the size of the product predicted from the cDNA sequence, indicating that no sequence is spliced out to generate this isoform. However, when primers specific for the FPB are utilized in a PCR on genomic DNA, the product obtained is much larger than predicted from the cDNA. Thus it appears that a ∼3.2-kilobase pair intron is spliced out to generate the FPB receptor message. Consistent with the mechanism for the generation of these two isoforms, the highly conserved dinucleotide (GT) from the splice donor site is retained in the sequence of the FPA isoform (nt 1048-1049) (19Padgett R.A. Grabowski P.J. Konarska M.M. Seiler S. Sharp P.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 1119-1150Google Scholar). The functional significance of the carboxyl-terminal isoforms has been most well characterized for the α, β, and γ isoforms of the mouse EP3 receptor. Agonist binding among the isoforms is virtually indistinguishable (8Sugimoto Y. Negishi M. Hayashi Y. Namba T. Honda A. Watabe A. Hirata M. Narumiya S. Ichikawa A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2712-2718Google Scholar), but differences among the isoforms have been found for receptor/G-protein coupling. Traditionally, the mouse EP3 isoforms are coupled to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, but some of the isoforms have been found to stimulate cAMP formation and/or activate PI hydrolysis (3Namba T. Sugimoto Y. Negishi M. Irie A. Ushikubi F. Kakizuka A. Ito S. Ichikawa A. Narumiya S. Nature. 1993; 365: 166-170Google Scholar, 9Irie A. Sugimoto Y. Namba T. Harazono A. Honda A. Watabe A. Negishi M.

In addition, two isoforms, the EP3α and EP3γ, and a recombinant mutant that is truncated at the splice site have been shown to have agonist-independent constitutive activity (21Hasegawa H. Negishi M. Ichikawa A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1857-1860Google Scholar). Thus, in the absence of agonist, the level of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation is greater in cells expressing the EP3β isoform than in cells expressing either the EP3α or EP3γ isoforms or the truncation mutant. However, maximal inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP formation in the presence of agonist is the same for all three isoforms and for the truncation mutant. For the EP3α isoform, there is agonist-independent constitutive activity and agonist-dependent inhibition of cAMP formation, while for the truncation mutant, there is only agonist-independent inhibition of cAMP formation. Data obtained with the EP3γ isoform suggest that there is agonist-independent stimulation of the G-protein, Gi, but agonist-dependent stimulation of the G-protein, Gs (22Negishi M. Hasegawa H. Ichikawa A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 386: 165-168Google Scholar). Our data with the FP receptor isoforms indicate that the receptor/G-protein coupling for the FP receptor isoforms are analogous to the data found for the mouse EP3α and EP3β isoforms. There is agonist-independent constitutive IP accumulation in cells expressing either the FPA or FPB receptor isoforms, but this level is approximately 130% higher for cells expressing the truncated FPB isoform than for cells expressing the FPA receptor isoform. In addition, for both the FPA and FPB isoforms, there is agonist-stimulated IP accumulation which reaches the same maximal level. This suggests that the FPB isoform is a naturally occurring truncated receptor that shows agonist-independent constitutive activity, but is still responsive to agonist. This is in contrast to the truncation mutant of the EP3 receptor, which shows only agonist-independent constitutive activity and is unresponsive to agonist. The data with both the EP3 and FP receptor isoforms are consistent with mutations made in other G-protein coupled receptors, including the avian β-adrenergic receptor, which suggests that sequences in the carboxyl-terminal tail may suppress G-protein interactions in the absence of ligand (23Parker E.M. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9987-9996Google Scholar, 24Lefkowitz R.J. Cotecchia S. Samama P. Costa T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 303-307Google Scholar). More work will be needed to establish if additional biochemical differences exist between the FP receptor isoforms. Of particular interest are possible differences in desensitization, localization, and ability to activate other downstream effectors. The physiological significance of the FPB isoform, and of other prostanoid receptor alternative splice variants, is also intriguing. In the mid-cycle large cell corpus luteum library from which the FPB was cloned, the FPA is far more abundant than the FPB. This, however, may not be true throughout the luteal cycle and in other tissues that are also responsive to PGF2α.

In Jurkat cells, T cell receptor activation leads to the association of Grap with phosphoproteins p36/38 and, to a lesser degree, Shc. This interaction is mediated by the Grap SH2 domain, which has similar binding specificity to the Grb2 SH2 domain. Grap also associates via its SH3 domains with Sos, the Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor; with dynamin, a GTPase involved in membrane protein trafficking; and with Sam68, a nuclear RNA-binding protein that serves as a substrate of Src kinases during mitosis. T cell activation effects an increase in Grap association with p36/38, Shc, Sos, and dynamin. Sam68 binding is constitutive. Phospholipase C-γ1 and Fyn are also found in activated Grap signaling complexes, although these interactions may not be direct. We conclude that Grap is a prominent component of lymphocyte receptor signaling.

Activation of resting T cells through the T cell antigen receptor triggers a cascade of intracellular biochemical events that lead to lymphocyte differentiation and proliferation (1Weiss A.

Biochem. 1994; 63: 1045-1083Google Scholar). Although components of the T cell receptor and associated CD3 and ζ chains lack intrinsic kinase activity, tyrosine phosphorylations are among the earliest biochemical events detected after activation (4Hsi E.D. Siegel J.N. Minami Y. Luong E.T. Klausner R.D. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10836-10842Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of CD3/ζ and other cellular proteins is essential in T cell activation (5June C.H. Fletcher M.C. Ledbetter J.A. Schieven G.L. Siegel J.N. Phillips A.F. Samelson L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7722-7726Google Scholar, 6Mustelin T. Coggeshall K.M. Isakov N. Altman A. Science. 1990; 247: 1584-1587Google Scholar). Two types of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases are known to catalyze these phosphorylations. The Src family kinases Lck and Fyn associate with the cytoplasmic portions of the CD3/ζ and CD4/CD8 co-receptors, respectively, and phosphorylate regularly spaced, paired tyrosine residues within ITAM motifs of the ζ and CD3 cytoplasmic tails. The ZAP-70 tyrosine kinase is recruited to the activated complex by binding phosphorylated ITAM motifs via its tandem SH2 domains. Sequential or combinatorial activation of the ZAP-70 and Src family kinases leads to phosphorylation of numerous additional proteins, including Shc, p36/38, Lnk, SLP-76, phospholipase C-γ1 (PLC-γ1), 1The abbreviations used are: PLCphospholipase CPIphosphatidylinositolGSTglutathione S-transferasePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresiskbkilobase pair(s)ILinterleukinNF-ATnuclear factor of activated T cells. and the protooncoproteins c-Cbl and Vav. Many of these substrates contain SH2 domains. Several additional SH2 domain proteins that are not tyrosine-phosphorylated, such as Grb2 and phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase, are also recruited to the activated receptor.

Many critical proteins involved in lymphocyte signal transduction are ubiquitously expressed, including enzymes in phosphoinositide pathways such as PLC-γ1 and PI 3-kinase and Ras effectors like Grb2 and Sos.

Recent advances in cloning and gene sequencing technology, particularly random genome sequencing efforts, allow the identification of additional cell type-specific proteins with potential roles in cell signaling.

Nature. 1995; 377 (suppl.): 3-174Google Scholar). This protein has an SH3-SH2-SH3 domain architecture and 58% sequence identity to Grb2. Northern analyses of mRNA derived from multiple human tissues show restricted expression in spleen, thymus, and peripheral blood leukocytes. Using a specific antibody, we detected the protein in isolated peripheral blood lymphocytes and in all established T and B cell lines tested. These findings suggest potential functions for this protein in T cell signaling. Independently, an identical protein, designated Grap (Grb2-like accessory protein), was identified in hematopoietic cells and found to have potential functions downstream from erythropoietin and stem cell receptors (8Feng G.-S. Ouyang Y.-B. Hu D.-P. Shi Z.-Q. Gentz R. Ni J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12129-12132Google Scholar). A large number of studies have established an important role for Grb2 in linking tyrosine kinase receptors to downstream effector pathways. For example, the SH2 domain of Grb2 binds activated growth factor receptors either directly or indirectly via Shc, an adapter protein with single SH2 and PTB domains (9Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Grignani F. McGlade J. Cavallo F. Forni G. Nicoletti I. Pawson T. Pelicci P.G. Cell. 1992; 70: 93-104Google Scholar). The specificity for these interactions is determined by the selectivity of the Grb2 SH2 domain for phosphorylated YXN motifs (10Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Google Scholar, 11Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E.

In many cells the SH3 domains of Grb2 are constitutively associated with proline-rich motifs in mSos, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that activates Ras (12Chardin P. Camonis J.H. Gale N.W.

Biol. 1995; 15: 186-197Google Scholar). By this mechanism Grb2 mediates the recruitment of mSos and additional potential effector enzymes to activated receptor signaling complexes. In T cells, Grb2 recruitment also occurs via its SH2 domain, by binding T cell receptor ITAM motifs directly or indirectly through Shc or p36/38. Grb2 also binds mSos in T cells, although association is low under basal conditions and up-regulated significantly upon T cell receptor activation (23Ravichandran K.S. Lorenz U. Shoelson S.E. Burakoff S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 593-600Google Scholar, 24Reedquist K.A. Fukazawa T. Panchamoorthy G. Langdon W.Y. Shoelson S.E. Druker B.J. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8435-8442Google Scholar). The ability of Grb2 to form complexes with additional potential effectors and the roles of these complexes in signaling have not been adequately studied in T cells. Given the predominant expression of Grap in lymphoid tissues, we have analyzed its role in T cell signaling. Grap associates prominently in activated Jurkat cells with p36/38, a major tyrosine kinase substrate in T cells. In contrast, low levels of Grap associate with Shc. These interactions are through its SH2 domain. Grap also interacts directly via its SH3 domains with the Ras activator, mammalian Sos, the GTPase dynamin, and the mitosis-related tyrosine kinase substrate, Sam68. Associations with p36/38, Shc, Sos, and dynamin are up-regulated upon T cell activation, whereas Sam68 is bound at similarly high levels in stimulated and unstimulated cells. PLC-γ1 and Fyn are also found in activated Grap signaling complexes, although these interactions may be indirect, through p36/38 and Sam68, respectively. Based on the critical functions associated with each of these effector molecules, Grap is likely to play a crucial role in lymphocyte activation. A DNA fragment encompassing the entire open reading frame of Grb2 (kindly provided in a pGEX vector by M. Moran, University of Toronto) and the full-length cDNA of Grap (supplied by D. Dunnington, SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals) were excised from the appropriate vectors, labeled with [32P]dATP to greater than 2 × 109 cpm/μg by the random hexamer method, and hybridized to Northern blots of multiple human tissue mRNAs as recommended by the manufacturer (Clontech). The membranes were washed at high stringency, and hybridized mRNA was detected using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). BamHI and XhoI restriction sites were introduced by polymerase chain reaction into the Grap cDNA immediately upstream and downstream of the start and stop codons, respectively. The restricted DNA fragment was subcloned into the corresponding sites of the pGEX-4T-1 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) plasmid for expression as a fusion protein of glutathione S-transferase (GST) and full-length Grap. Polymerase chain reactions with mutant primers were used to introduce mutations into the Grb2 and Grap coding sequences to provide proteins with deficient binding, either to the SH2 domains (R86K within the FLRVES motif) or both SH3 domains (P49L/P208L of Grap and P49L/P206L of Grb2). A fragment of mSos1 cDNA encoding residues 1135-1322 was excised with endonucleases BglII and NsiI and subcloned into the BamHI and HindIII sites of the plasmid pET30c (Novagen) for expression of histidine-tagged protein. The DNA sequence of each plasmid was verified. The pGEX plasmids were used to transform Escherichia coli strain XL-1 blue (Stratagene). After induction of protein expression with 1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside for 2-4 h, the bacteria were resuspended in lysis buffer P (50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.4 mg/ml lysozyme) and treated with 2 mg/ml deoxycholic acid. In certain cases, proteins in inclusion bodies were solubilized with 1.5% N-laurylsarcosine (Sigma) (25Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Google Scholar). Lysates were further treated by sonication and centrifugation (10,000 × g for 20 min); Triton X-100 (1.8-2.0%) was added to lysates containing N-laurylsarcosine. The proteins were adsorbed to immobilized glutathione agarose (Molecular Probes), and the columns were washed with buffer W (25 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 1.0 mM EDTA, 1.0 mM dithiothreitol). The histidine-tagged mSos1 fragment was expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen). After induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside, the bacteria were disrupted by sonication, and the soluble protein was affinity-purified using a Ni2+ chelating column (Novagen) as described by the supplier. To generate biotinylated probes, eluted proteins (2-4 mg/ml) were dialyzed against 100 mM sodium borate, pH 8.8, treated with biotinamidocaproate-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Sigma; 50 μg/mg of protein) for 4 h at 22°C (26Mayer B.J. Jackson P.K. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 627-631Google Scholar), and dialyzed against buffer W. Protein purity and concentrations were assessed by Coomassie staining following separation by SDS-PAGE. Peptides synthesized using Fmoc (N(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry and high pressure liquid chromatography-purified (27Piccione E. Case R.D. Domchek S.M. Hu P. Chaudhuri M. Backer J.M. Schlessinger J. Shoelson S.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3197-3202Google Scholar) are numbered by position within the corresponding protein: Lnk-pY299, DNQpYTPLSQL; Shc-pY317, PSpYVNVQNL; Shc-pY317(N319A), PSpYVAVQNL; BCR-pY177, KPFpYVNVEF; Grap-199 RSCGRVGFFPRSYVQPVHL. For precipitation experiments, peptides were coupled to Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad). Peptides (2-10 mg/ml) dissolved in Me2SO containing 25 mM N-ethylmorpholine were incubated with equal volumes of washed Affi-Gel 10 for 16 h at 22°C. Excess reagents were removed, and unreacted sites on the resin were blocked by treatment with ethanolamine. Polyclonal antiserum to Grap was prepared by immunization of rabbits with peptide Grap-199 coupled to maleimide-activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce). Grap-specific antibodies were affinity-purified by passage of the antisera over immobilized Grap-199, extensive washing of the beads with phosphate-buffered saline, and elution with 0.1 M HCl. Additional antibodies used in these studies include SPV-T3b (anti-CD3ϵ) (28Spits H. Keizer G. Borst J. Terhorst C. Hekman A. de Vries J.E. Hybridoma. 1984; 2: 423-437Google Scholar) and anti-Cbl (24Reedquist K.A. Fukazawa T. Panchamoorthy G. Langdon W.Y. Shoelson S.E. Druker B.J. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8435-8442Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-mouse IgG (6170-01) was from Southern Biotechnology; anti-dynamin (D25520), anti-Shc (S14630), anti-Sos1 (15520), and agarose-coupled anti-phosphotyrosine (P11821) were from Transduction Laboratories; anti-Grb2 (255), anti-PLC-γ (426), anti-Sam68 (333), and anti-SOS1/2 (259) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; and anti-p85 (05-212) and anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 were from UBI. The anti-Myc epitope antibody was purified with immobilized protein G from culture supernatants of the hybridoma 9E10 kindly provided by J. M. Bishop (University of California, San Francisco) (29Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (HyClone), 2 mML-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.), 50 μM 2-mercaptoethanol, and streptomycin/penicillin (Life Technologies), in the presence of 5% CO2. Normal peripheral blood T cells (phytohemagglutinin blasts), obtained by stimulation of human buffy coat-derived mononuclear cells with phytohemagglutinin (Pharmacia; 1:2000 dilution), were grown in media containing 1.5 nM recombinant IL-2. A subclone of Jurkat human T leukemia cells (Jurkat-JMC) were left unstimulated or stimulated with anti-CD3ϵ (SBV-T3b; 1:200 ascites) for 2 min at 37°C. Cells were lysed at 4°C with buffer E (108 cells/ml, 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mM NaF, 1 mM vanadate, 3 μg/ml leupeptin, and 3 μg/ml aprotinin). Lysates were rocked 30 min at 4°C, centrifuged (10,000 × g, 15 min), and precleared with washed protein A-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia) and GST-coated glutathione-agarose. Additional studies with Ramos, Raji, and Daudi B cell lymphoma lines, K562 erythroleukemia cells, Va2 human fibroblasts, and SV40-T-transformed JMC-T cells were conducted following similar protocols. An XhoI restriction site was introduced by polymerase chain reaction into the Grap cDNA immediately upstream of the start codon. Simultaneously, nucleotides encoding a Myc epitope tag (EQKLISEDL) were introduced between the site encoding Grap residue 217 and the stop codon, and a BamHI restriction site was introduced downstream from the stop codon. The XhoI/BamHI fragment was subcloned into the pSRαneo vector (30Bukowski J.F. Morita C.T. Tanaka Y. Bloom B.R. Brenner M.B. Band H. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 998-1006Google Scholar) to generate pGrap-Myc. The pGrap-Myc (50 μg/1.2 × 107 cells) was introduced into Jurkat-derived JMC-T cells expressing the SV40 large T antigen (31Fukazawa T. Reedquist K.A. Panchamoorthy G. Soltoff S. Trub T. Druker B. Cantley L. Shoelson S.E. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20177-20182Google Scholar) by electroporation. Cells were cultured 72 h before collection, anti-CD3 activation, and lysis. In typical pull-down experiments, lysates from 107 Jurkat cells were incubated with 4-10 μg of GST fusion protein bound to glutathione-agarose or immobilized peptide for 1.0 h at 4°C. For immunoprecipitations, lysates from 108 Jurkat cells were incubated with 50 μg of anti-phosphotyrosine antibody immobilized on protein A-Sepharose. Alternatively, lysates from 107 transfected JMC-T cells were incubated with 6 μg of immobilized anti-Myc antibody. All precipitates were washed four times with lysis buffer E. Proteins were eluted with Laemmli sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon; Millipore Corp.) by electroblotting. Membranes were blocked with TBS-T buffer (10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 2% gelatin for >12 h at 22°C, reacted with optimal concentrations of specific antibodies in TBS-T containing 2.0% bovine serum albumin for 1.0 h at 22°C, and washed five times with TBS-T. Proteins were identified following incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse Ig (Sigma) or streptavidin (KPL) by enhanced chemiluminescence, according to the manufacturer's protocol (DuPont). The entire cDNA for Grap and the coding sequence for Grb2 were radiolabeled and used to probe multiple-tissue Northern blots. A 2.1-kb transcript was detected for human Grap, compared with a 3.5 kb transcript for human Grb2 (Fig. 1). Highest levels of Grap mRNA were found in spleen and thymus, with an intermediate amount in peripheral blood leukocytes. Much less of the transcript was detected in alternative tissues, suggesting that Grap expression is predominant in lymphoid tissues. Apparent expression of Grap at low levels may reflect the presence of immune cells within these tissues. For comparison, equivalent amounts of a 3.5-kb human Grb2 transcript were found in all tissues (Fig. 1), as previously reported (32Lowenstein E.J. Daly R.J. Batzer A.G. Li W. Margolis B. Lammers R. Ullrich A. Skolnik E.Y. Bar-Sagi D. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1992; 70: 431-442Google Scholar). Polyclonal antisera were generated against the C-terminal 19 residues of Grap to detect the expressed protein. The corresponding region provides useful anti-Grb2 antibodies (e.g. Santa Cruz), and the protein sequences diverge within this region. Antibodies were concentrated and nonreacting species were eliminated by immobilized Grap peptide affinity purification. GST-Grap was readily recognized by the anti-Grap antibodies in immunoblots. GST-Grb2 was recognized by commercial anti-Grb2 antibodies (Santa Cruz). There was no detectable cross-reaction (i.e. affinity-purified anti-Grap antibodies did not recognize Grb2, and vice versa) (Fig. 2). However, the Grap antibodies were not useful for immunoprecipitation, and gave high backgrounds when attempts were made to immunoblot SDS-PAGE-separated cell lysates. Therefore, endogenous Grap and Grb2 proteins were quantitatively extracted from cell lysates with immobilized phosphopeptide beads. The peptide sequence was derived from the region surrounding Tyr177 of the breakpoint cluster region of BCR-ABL (Lys-Pro-Phe-Tyr(P)-Val-Asn-Val-Glu-Phe), which binds Grb2 and Grap with equally high affinity (11Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. McGlade J. Olivier J.P. Pawson T. Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M. Sabe H. Hanafusa H. Yi T. Ren R. Baltimore D. Ratnofsky S. Feldman R.A. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2777-2785Google Scholar and 33Pendergast A. Quilliam L. Cripe L. Bassing C. Dai Z. Li N. Batzer A. Rabun K. Der C. Schlessinger J. Gishizky M. Cell. 1993; 75: 175-185Google Scholar and this study; see below). Proteins from lysates of several cell lines were precipitated using an excess of immobilized BCR-ABL peptide beads, separated by SDS-PAGE, and detected by immunoblotting. Cells of lymphocytic origin contained Grap, including normal peripheral T cells (phytohemagglutinin blasts) and cultured T (Jurkat) and B (Ramos, Raji, and Daudi) cell lineages (Fig. 2). In contrast, all cells tested, including erythroleukemia line K562 and Va2 fibroblasts, contained Grb2. In conjunction with the Northern analyses, these results suggest a restricted role for Grap in B and T lymphocyte signaling, compared with a more general role for Grb2 in the signaling pathways of many cells. Because the phosphopeptide beads extracted both Grap and Grb2 quantitatively, relative amounts of the proteins could be estimated by comparing blotting intensities with various fusion protein dilutions. Grap is present in B and T lymphocytes at about 5 ng/mg total protein. Grb2 is present in the same cells at approximately 10-fold higher concentration (Fig. 2). Jurkat cells were activated by anti-CD3 cross-linking to determine whether Grap is involved in T cell signaling. Phosphoproteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies and Grap was detected by immunoblotting with the anti-Grap antibody. Receptor activation led to a substantial increase in the amount of Grap that co-precipitated with phosphoproteins (Fig. 3), indicating that at endogenous levels of all cellular constituents, Grap functions in a signaling pathway downstream from the T cell receptor. To begin to learn which cellular proteins interact with Grap, Jurkat cells were activated, and proteins were precipitated with GST-Grap and GST-Grb2 fusion proteins. Two prominent, tyrosine-phosphorylated, 36- and 38-kDa proteins co-precipitated with GST-Grap in lysates of stimulated but not unstimulated cells (Fig. 4). No other phosphoproteins were readily detected. In contrast, GST-Grb2 interacted with numerous tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in Jurkat cell lysates, including 36- and 38-kDa proteins (Fig. 4). Previous studies suggest that in lymphocytes, Grb2 associates directly or indirectly with Shc (p52), PLC-γ1, p36/38, c-Cbl (p120), SLP-76 (p76), and ZAP-70 (p70). Several of these phosphoproteins account for additional bands present in GST-Grb2 precipitates. Whereas Grap and Grb2 precipitate equivalent amounts of p36/38, Grap does not associate substantially with the alternative Grb2-bound phosphoproteins. Based on the time course of phosphorylation (not shown) and relative mobilities by SDS-PAGE, the Grap-associated p36/38 appears to be the same protein(s) known to interact with Grb2, PLC-γ1, and PI 3-kinase p85 in activated T cells (31Fukazawa T. Reedquist K.A. Panchamoorthy G. Soltoff S. Trub T. Druker B. Cantley L. Shoelson S.E. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20177-20182Google Scholar, 34Gilliland L.K. Schieven G.L. Norris N.A.

Grap was expressed in Jurkat cells in order to learn more about its role in T cell receptor signaling. An anti-Myc antibody epitope was fused to the C terminus of Grap for immunoidentification. The Myc-tagged Grap was expressed transiently in an SV40 large T antigen-expressing Jurkat cell line, JMC-T (31Fukazawa T. Reedquist K.A. Panchamoorthy G. Soltoff S. Trub T. Druker B. Cantley L. Shoelson S.E. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20177-20182Google Scholar), and after 72 h, cells were stimulated with anti-CD3 antibodies. Grap-Myc protein was immunoprecipitated from lysates using anti-Myc antibodies. Lysates from unstimulated and stimulated cells contained equivalent amounts of the protein, as detected by immunoblotting with anti-Grap antibodies (Fig. 5A). Associated proteins were detected in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblots (Fig. 5B). Only p36/38 co-immunoprecipitated with Grap-Myc in stimulated but not unstimulated cells. Although it is not abundant in cell lysates, p36/38 is concentrated in immunoprecipitates. We conclude that the Grap-p36/38 association is of high affinity and that p36/38 associates preferentially with Grap in activated T lymphocytes. p36/38 could bind Grap through its SH2 domain or SH3 domains. Blocking mutations in GST-Grap fusion proteins were used to discriminate between these possibilities. R86K mutations within the critical FLVRES motifs were introduced into GST-Grb2 and GST-Grap to ablate SH2 domain binding. Interactions with the N-terminal SH3 domains of GST-Grb2 and GST-Grap were blocked with P49L mutations, while the C-terminal SH3 domains of GST-Grb2 and GST-Grap were altered with P206L and P208L mutations, respectively. Previous studies confirmed that these mutations block binding to the SH2 and SH3 domains of Grb2 (20Fukazawa T. Reedquist K.A. Trub T. Soltof S. Panchamoorthy G. Druker B. Cantley L. Shoelson S.E. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19141-19150Google Scholar). Mutation in the Grap SH2 domain blocked the interaction with p36/38 (Fig. 4). In contrast, mutation of both SH3 domains had no effect. Therefore, the Grap SH2 domain mediates its interaction with p36/38, similar to previous findings with Grb2 (31Fukazawa T. Reedquist K.A. Panchamoorthy G. Soltoff S. Trub T. Druker B. Cantley L.

Grb2 interacts with numerous phosphoproteins in activated T cells, while Grap binds primarily to p36/38 (Fig. 4). Phosphopeptide binding specificities of Grb2 and Grap were compared in order to test whether a restricted SH2 domain binding specificity might account for the limited number of proteins interacting with Grap. Immobilized GST-Grb2 and GST-Grap were used to precipitate p36/38 in the presence of varying concentrations of a Shc-derived phosphopeptide (Fig. 6, A and B). The Shc peptide corresponds to the sequence surrounding Tyr317 (Pro-Ser-Tyr(P)-Val-Asn-Val-Gln-Asn-Leu), a major Shc phosphoryla"

https://openalex.org/W2041596890,"HERG (human eag-related gene) encodes an inward-rectifier potassium channel formed by the assembly of four subunits. Since the truncated HERG protein in patients with long QT syndrome induces a dominant phenotype, that is, cardiac sudden death, the assembly of nonfunctional complexes between wild-type and mutated subunits was implicated in causing the disease. To understand HERG-mediated cardiac sudden death at the molecular level, it is important to determine which regions in the HERG protein participate in subunit interaction. We therefore report the identification of a subunit interaction domain, NABHERG, that is localized at the hydrophilic cytoplasmic N terminus and can form a tetramer in the absence of the rest of the HERG protein. Truncated HERG proteins containing NABHERG, including one that resulted from the ∆1261 human mutation, inhibit the functional expression of the HERG channel in transfected cells. Together, these results support the notion that the expression of HERG in the human heart may be decreased in the presence of the truncated subunit. Such a decrease of potassium channel expression can contribute to the longer QT intervals observed in the patients with the HERG mutation.

To understand HERG-mediated cardiac sudden death at the molecular level, it is important to determine which regions in the HERG protein participate in subunit interaction. We therefore report the identification of a subunit interaction domain, NABHERG, that is localized at the hydrophilic cytoplasmic N terminus and can form a tetramer in the absence of the rest of the HERG protein. Truncated HERG proteins containing NABHERG, including one that resulted from the ∆1261 human mutation, inhibit the functional expression of the HERG channel in transfected cells. Together, these results support the notion that the expression of HERG in the human heart may be decreased in the presence of the truncated subunit. Such a decrease of potassium channel expression can contribute to the longer QT intervals observed in the patients with the HERG mutation."

The molecular basis for urate transport, however, has not been identified. A novel full-length cDNA encoding a 322-amino acid protein, designated UAT (urate transporter), has been cloned from a rat renal cDNA library by antibody screening. UAT mRNA transcripts that approximate 1.55 kilobases are present, but differentially expressed in various rat tissues. Recombinant UAT protein that was expressed from the cloned cDNA in Escherichia coli and purified via immobilized metal affinity chromatography has been functionally reconstituted as a highly selective urate transporter/channel in planar lipid bilayers. The IgG fraction of the polyclonal antibody that was used to select the UAT clone from the cDNA library, but not nonimmune IgG, blocked urate channel activity. Based on the wide tissue distribution of the mRNA for UAT we propose that UAT provides the molecular basis for urate flux across cell membranes, allowing urate that is formed during purine metabolism to efflux from cells and serving as an electrogenic transporter that plays an important role in renal and gastrointestinal urate excretion.

https://openalex.org/W1985749885,"We have demonstrated that a 120-kDa protein, identified as Cbl, becomes rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine residues following stimulation of factor-dependent cells with interleukin-3 (IL-3). Little or no phosphorylation of Cbl was observed in the absence of IL-3 stimulation and phosphorylation is maximal by 20-30 min after IL-3 stimulation. Association of Cbl with Grb2 was noted in unstimulated cells, and the amount of Cbl associated with Grb2 increased following IL-3 stimulation. The p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase was constitutively associated with Cbl. Approximately 10% of the PI kinase activity present in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates was present in anti-Cbl immunoprecipitates of IL-3-stimulated cells. The constitutive association of Cbl with Fyn was also observed. Cbl was observed to bind to bacterial fusion proteins encoding the unique, SH3, and SH2 domains of Fyn, Hck, and Lyn. The SH2 domain of Fyn alone was able to bind Cbl to nearly the same extent as did the fusion protein encoding the unique, SH3, and SH2 domains. This was not the case for the SH2 domain of Hck, however, as binding of the Hck fusion protein to Cbl appeared to require multiple domains. The binding of the fusion proteins to Cbl occurred regardless of whether Cbl was tyrosine-phosphorylated or not, and the binding could not be disrupted by the addition of 30 mM free phosphotyrosine. These data suggest the unexpected conclusion that the Fyn SH2 domain may bind to Cbl in a phosphotyrosine-independent manner.

Sequence analysis of the Cbl cDNA revealed that the protein contains 913 amino acids, a putative nuclear localization sequence in its N-terminal region, a “RING finger” motif typical of numerous DNA-binding proteins, and several proline-rich sequences in its C-terminal half that may serve as SH3 domain binding sites (12Langdon W.Y.

The association of Cbl with the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase and Grb2 suggests that phosphorylation of Cbl may regulate activation of PI 3-kinase and Ras. It is not clear whether Cbl can associate with all of these molecules in the same cell, or in different cell types. In this report, we demonstrate that Cbl is the 120-kDa phosphoprotein observed in IL-3-stimulated cells. Cbl was observed to associate with Grb2, Fyn, and PI 3-kinase. The association of Cbl with Grb2 following cytokine stimulation is consistent with a previous report (25Odai H. Sasaki K. Iwamatsu A. Hanazono Y. Tanaka T. Mitani K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10800-10805Google Scholar); however, the described interaction Cbl with Fyn and PI 3-kinase following cytokine stimulation is novel to this report. The association of Cbl with Fyn may be mediated by the SH2 domain of Fyn binding to Cbl in a phosphotyrosine-independent manner. The 32D cl3 cell line was obtained from Dr. Joel Greenberger (University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA) and was maintained as described (28Greenberger J.S. Sakakeeny M.A. Humphries K.C. Eaves C.J. Eckner R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2931-2935Google Scholar). Recombinant murine IL-3 was obtained from Collaborative Biomedical Products (Bedford, MA). Immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (11Anderson S.M. Jorgensen B. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1660-1670Google Scholar). Cells were lysed either with RIPA (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 2 mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate) or with EB (50 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 5 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate). Both lysis buffers were supplemented with 100 units/ml aprotinin (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA). Rabbit anti-Lyn, rabbit anti-p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase, rabbit anti-Grb2, rabbit anti-Fyn coupled to agarose beads, and anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G10 coupled to agarose beads were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Antibodies to Cbl and Hck were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Additional antibodies to PI 3-kinase, Lyn, and Grb2 were obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). A polyclonal antibody to a GST fusion protein containing a region of the β subunit of the murine IL-3 receptor was raised in rabbits and affinity-purified. Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electrotransferred to Immobilon membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Immunoblotting was conducted as described using the Enhanced Chemiluminescence Lighting (ECL) system according to manufacturer's recommendations (Amersham Corp.). All gels were 7% polyacrylamide gels except those used in the analysis of Grb2, which were 12%. Reactions were a modification of a previously described protocol (29Whitman M. Downs C.P. Keeler M. Keller T. Cantley L. Nature. 1988; 332: 644-646Google Scholar, 30Fukui Y. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1651-1658Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitated proteins were washed three times with RIPA, twice with PAN (20 mM PIPES (pH 7.0), 20 μl/ml aprotinin, 100 mM NaCl), and resuspended in 50 μl of PAN. A 5-μl aliquot of each sample was removed and placed in a new tube, and 1 μl of 2 mg/ml phosphatidylinositol in 4.5 mM EGTA, 10% Me2SO was added to each reaction. The tubes were incubated at room temperature for 10 m before addition of the reaction mixture containing ATP and incubation at 30†C for 15 m. The final reaction mixture contained 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 5 mM MgCl2, 0.45 mM EGTA, 10 μM ATP (5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP), and 0.2 mg/ml PI. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 0.1 ml of 1 M HCl, and extracted with 0.2 ml of CHCl3:methanol (1:1). After discarding the aqueous phase, the organic phase was re-extracted with 1 M HCl:methanol (1:1), and dried in a Savant SpeedVac. The samples were dissolved in 10 μl of CHCl3:methanol, spotted on Silica Gel 60 plates (E. Merck) that had been impregnated with sodium tartrate. Plates were developed in CHCl3:methanol:4 M NH4OH (9:7:2). After chromatography, the plate was allowed to dry prior to autoradiography. Bacterial expression vectors encoding different regions of Fyn, Hck, or Lyn coupled to GST were either constructed for this study or were provided by other investigators. The following expression vectors were obtained from Dr. John Cambier (National Jewish Center for Immunology and Respiratory Diseases, Denver, CO): GST-FYN-(1-255), GST-FYN-SH2, GST-FYN-SH3, and GST-FYN-(1-27) (31Pleiman C.M. Clark M.R. Gauen L.K.T. Winitz S. Coggeshall K.M. Johnson G.L. Shaw A.S. Cambier J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5877-5887Google Scholar). GST-HCK-(1-61), referred to as GST-HCK-unique, was obtained from Dr. Clifford Lowell (University of California, San Francisco, CA) (32Lowell C.A. Soriano P. Varmus H.E. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 387-398Google Scholar). The following GST fusion proteins were prepared for this study: GST-FYN, GST-HCK, GST-LYN, GST-HCK-SH3, and GST-HCK-SH2. The unique, SH3, and SH2 domains of Fyn, Hck, and Lyn were amplified by PCR and cloned into GEX-3X. The primers and the insertion sites for each constructions are as follows. FYN was inserted between the BamHI and EcoRI sites (sense primer, 5'-GAAGATCTGGCCTGTGTGCAATGTAAG-3'; antisense primer, 5'-GAGAATTCGGCCACAAAGAGTGTCAC-3'); HCK was inserted between the BamHI and EcoRI sites (sense primer, 5'-GAAGATCTAAGTCCAAGTTCCTCCAG-3'; antisense primer, 5'-GAGAATTCCCCGTCGTTCCCCTTCTT-3'); and LYN was inserted between the BamHI and EcoRI sites (sense primer, 5'-GAAGATCTGGATGTATTAAATCAAAA-3'; antisense primer, 5'-GAGAATTCGGCCACCACAATGTCACC-3'). The SH3 domain of Hck was amplified by PCR (sense primer, 5'-CAGATCTATTACCAGGCCATTCACCA-3'; antisense primer, 5'-GAATCCAGAGAGTCAACGCGGGCGAC-3'), ligated to the pCR2 cloning vector (InVitrogen) and plasmid DNA purified. The vector was then cut with BglII and EcoRI and ligated into pGEX-3X at the BamHI and EcoRI sites to generate GST-HCK-SH3. The SH2 domain of Hck was amplified by PCR (sense primer, 5'-GTTAGATCTATGGAGACAGAGGAGTGGTT-3'; antisense primer, 5'-GAGAATTCCCCGTCGTTCCCCTTCTT-3'), ligated into pCR2, and plasmid DNA purified. The SH2 domain was released by digestion with BglII and EcoRI and ligated into the BamHI sites and EcoRI sites of pGEX-4T3 to generate GST-HCK-SH2. The GEX expression vectors were introduced into competent DH5α bacteria, and expression of GST fusion proteins was induced as follows. Colonies picked from plates were grown in 50 ml of Luria Broth overnight. The cultures were diluted 1:20 and grown for 2 h, after which isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside was added at a final concentration of 0.1 mM. The cultures were then grown for an additional 4 h before protein purification. Bacteria were pelleted at 6000 rpm for 10 m in a Beckman JA10 rotor. The pelleted cells were resuspended in 20 ml of Lysis Buffer (50 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 2 mM EDTA) containing 200 units/ml aprotinin, and lysed by sonication. To aid in protein solubilization, Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1%, and incubated for 30 m at 4†C. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 9,500 rpm for 10 m. Supernatants were incubated with 2 ml of a 50% slurry of glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) for 1 h at 4†C. The beads were isolated by centrifugation and washed with lysis buffer three times. The fusion protein was removed from the beads by the addition of reduced glutathione. Excess glutathione was removed from the isolated fusion protein by centrifugation using Centrex UF-2 10K Spin Columns (Schleicher & Schuell). Binding assays were conducted by adding 2 nmol of the desired GST fusion protein to cell lysate prepared as described above in a final volume of 1 ml. Following a 1-h incubation at 4†C on a rocking platform, 40 μl of glutathione-agarose (Sigma) was added and incubated for 1 h. The bound proteins were washed three times with RIPA, resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and subjected to immunoblotting as described above. We have previously described the activation of three Src-like tyrosine kinases following stimulation of 32D cl3 cells with IL-3 (11Anderson S.M. Jorgensen B. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1660-1670Google Scholar). As part of a study to examine the interaction of Fyn, Hck, and Lyn with the β subunit of the IL-3 receptor, we observed that GST fusion proteins encoding the unique, SH3, and SH2 domains of these three kinases appeared to bind to a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein of approximately 120 kDa.2 Based upon several recently published studies, we investigated whether this protein might be Cbl since its molecular mass is 120 kDa (14Hartley D.

The results of this study (Fig. 1), indicate that Cbl is phosphorylated following stimulation of 32D cl3 cells with IL-3. A major band of approximately 120 kDa is observed in the anti-Cbl immunoprecipitate immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. A minor band of 120 kDa can be seen in the anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitate that co-migrates with the tyrosine-phosphorylated band observed in the anti-Cbl immunoprecipitate (Fig. 1, compare lanes 2 and 4). The tyrosine-phosphorylated band of 120 kDa also co-migrates with the 120-kDa band observed in a parallel blot probed with the anti-Cbl antibody (Fig. 1, lanes 7 and 8). The anti-Cbl immunoblot also indicates that only a small portion of the Cbl protein is observed in an anti-Cbl immunoprecipitate (Fig. 1, compare lane 6 with lanes 7 or 8). A comparison of the relative densities of the band in lanes 6-8 indicates that only 12% of the Cbl protein present in anti-Cbl immunoprecipitates is present in the anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitate. The time course of Cbl phosphorylation was also examined. The results in Fig. 2 suggest that phosphorylation of Cbl can be detected as early as 2 m after IL-3 stimulation and is maximal 20-30 min after stimulation (Fig. 2). This time course was consistently observed in three independent studies. Examination of longer time periods revealed that tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl could be detected for up to 4 h post-stimulation (data not shown). Immunoblotting of lanes 7-12 with anti-Cbl antiserum indicated that the amount of Cbl protein did not change over the time period examined (data not shown). Several previous investigations have noted the association of Cbl with the Grb2 protein (16Donovan J.A. Wange R.L. Langdon W.Y. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22921-22924Google Scholar, 24Fukazawa T. Miyake S. Band V. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14554-14559Google Scholar, 25Odai H. Sasaki K. Iwamatsu A. Hanazono Y. Tanaka T. Mitani K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10800-10805Google Scholar). This possibility was examined by immunoprecipitating unstimulated and IL-3-stimulated cell lysates with either anti-Cbl or anti-Grb2 antisera and immunoblot analysis. Immunoblotting the anti-Grb2 immunoprecipitates with anti-Grb2 antisera revealed the expected band of 23 kDa (Fig. 3). The amount of Grb2 present in all lysates did not appear to change following IL-3 stimulation (Fig. 3). Anti-Cbl immunoprecipitates of unstimulated cells contained low amounts Grb2 (Fig. 3). IL-3-stimulation resulted in a 22-fold increase in the amount of Grb2 associated with Cbl (Fig. 3, lane 1 versus lane 2). Densitometry indicates that 27% of Grb2 observed in anti-Grb2 immunoprecipitates was present in the anti-Cbl immunoprecipitates of IL-3-stimulated cells. These results clearly demonstrate the association of a fraction of the total cellular Grb2 with Cbl in unstimulated cells and an increase in that association following IL-3 stimulation. Other investigators have reported the association of Cbl with the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase (14Hartley D. Meisner H. Corvera S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18260-18263Google Scholar, 15Fukazawa T. Reedquist K.A. Trub T. Soltoff S. Panchamoorthy G. Druker B. Cantley L. Shoelson S.E. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19141-19150Google Scholar, 21Soltoff S.P. Cantley L.C. J. Biol.

Xu G. Li J.-L. Prasad K.V. Griffin J.D. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 839-846Google Scholar). This was investigated by immunoprecipitation of unstimulated and IL-3-stimulated cell lysates with anti-phosphotyrosine, anti-Cbl, and anti-PI 3-kinase antibodies, and by immunoblotting with these same antibodies. IL-3 stimulation resulted in the phosphorylation of numerous proteins on tyrosine residues including the β subunit and Cbl; however, tyrosine phosphorylation of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase was not observed (Fig. 4, lane 6, top panel). The position of the p85 subunit was determined by reprobing the same blot with anti-p85 antibody. Immunoprecipitation of Cbl was observed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody in lysates of IL-3-stimulated cells and with anti-Cbl antibody in both unstimulated and stimulated cell lysates (Fig. 4, lanes 1-4, middle panel); however, no Cbl protein was detected in immunoblots of the anti-p85 immunoprecipitates of either unstimulated or stimulated cell lysates (Fig. 4, lanes 5 and 6, middle panel). Consistent with results shown in Fig. 1, Cbl was detected in an anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates of IL-3-stimulated cells (Fig. 4, lane 2, middle panel). The p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase was detected by anti-p85 immunoblotting of 4G10 immunoprecipitates from IL-3-stimulated cells and in anti-p85 immunoprecipitates of unstimulated and stimulated cell lysates. The presence of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase was detected by immunoblotting with an anti-p85 subunit antibody. Larger amounts of p85 were detected in the anti-p85 immunoprecipitates. There was a clear increase in the amount of p85 detected in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates of IL-3-stimulated cells, relative to unstimulated cells. There was a low but detectable amount of p85 in the anti-Cbl immunoprecipitates; however, the amount of p85 in anti-Cbl immunoprecipitates did not increase following IL-3 stimulation (Fig. 4, lanes 5 and 6, bottom panel). The anti-PI 3-kinase antibody did co-precipitate tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins with molecular masses of 145, 75, 56, 48, and a broad band at approximately 95-100 kDa from IL-3-stimulated cells (Fig. 4, lane 8, top panel). The 56-kDa band was also observed in the anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitate of IL-3-stimulated cells and most likely represents Shc (data not shown). The identity of 145-kDa band is not the β subunit since it does not react with anti-β antibodies; however, it may represent the recently described SHIP protein, which has been shown to associate with Shc (33Liu L. Damen J.E. Cutler R.L. Krystal G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6926-6935Google Scholar, 34Damen J.E. Liu L. Rosten P. Humphries R.K. Jefferson A.B. Majerus P.W. Krystal G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To provide additional evidence that PI 3-kinase associates with Cbl, anti-Cbl immunoprecipitates were assayed for PI 3-kinase activity in comparison to anti-p85 and anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates. PI 3-kinase activity was present in the anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates of IL-3-stimulated cells (Fig. 5, lanes 1-4). The amount of kinase activity in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates increased with the length of stimulation and appeared to plateau after 10-20 min (Fig. 5 and data not shown). PI 3-kinase activity was also present in anti-p85 immunoprecipitates at all time points examined (Fig. 5, lanes 9-12). PI kinase activity was detectable in anti-Cbl immunoprecipitates (Fig. 5, lanes 7 and 8). The PI kinase activity present in anti-Cbl immunoprecipitates appears to peak at 5 min and declines by 20 min after IL-3 stimulation. It is clear from the data in Fig. 5 that the amount of PI kinase activity present in anti-Cbl immunoprecipitates is dramatically less than that present in either the anti-phosphotyrosine or anti-p85 immunoprecipitates. PhosphorImager analysis quantitation of the spots corresponding to PIP in Fig. 5 reveals that at the peak time point, the amount of kinase activity in anti-Cbl immunoprecipitates corresponded to 10% of the amount observed in anti-p85 immunoprecipitates or 10% of the amount activity observed at 20 min in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates. We have previously described the activation of multiple Src-like kinases (Fyn, Hck, and Lyn), following stimulation of 32D cl3 cells with IL-3 (11Anderson S.M. Jorgensen B. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1660-1670Google Scholar). The association of Cbl with Src-like kinases has been described by other investigators (15Fukazawa T. Reedquist K.A. Trub T. Soltoff S. Panchamoorthy G.

The deduced proteins are members of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily containing three and two Ig domains, respectively. The common part has ∼40% sequence identity with neurothelin/basigin.

Furthermore, expression of gp65 and gp55 cDNAs in human 293 cells treated with tunicamycin results in the production of unglycosylated core proteins of identical size to deglycosylated gp65 and gp55. Northern analysis revealed that gp65 transcripts are brain-specific, whereas gp55 is expressed in most tissues and cell lines examined. The tissue distribution was confirmed at the protein level though the pattern of glycosylation of gp55 varies between tissues.

The ST tyr possesses a Tyr at amino acid 123, whereas the ST cys possesses a Cys at this position. The ST tyr is more catalytically active than the ST cys; however, both are functional when introduced into tissue culture cells.

Analysis of the N-linked oligosaccharides of these proteins demonstrates that both proteins enter the late Golgi. However, differences in ST tyr and ST cys proteolytic processing may be related to differences in their localization, because ST tyr but not ST cys is expressed at low levels on the cell surface.

https://openalex.org/W2081817480,"Previous studies had pointed to an important function of a putative exposed loop in the C-terminal domain of lipoprotein lipase for activity against emulsified lipid substrates.

We have expressed and characterized lipase mutants with tryptophan to alanine substitutions at positions 55, 114, 382, 390, 393, and 394 and a double mutant at residues 393 and 394. The substitutions in the N-terminal domain (W55A and W114A) led to poor expression of completely inactive lipase variants. Heparin-Sepharose chromatography showed that mutant W114A eluted at the same salt concentration as inactive wild-type monomers, indicating that this substitution prevented subunit interaction or led to an unstable dimer. In contrast, all mutants in the C-terminal domain were expressed as mixtures of monomers and dimers similarly to the wild-type. The dimers displayed at least some catalytic activity and had the same apparent heparin affinity as the active wild-type dimers. The mutants W390A, W393A, W394A, and W393A/W394A had decreased reactivity with the monoclonal antibody 5D2, indicating that the 5D2 epitope is longer than was reported earlier, or that conformational changes affecting the epitope had occurred.The mutants W390A, W393A, W394A, and W393A/W394A had decreased catalytic activity against a synthetic lipid emulsion of long-chain triacylglycerols (IntralipidR) and in particular against rat lymph chylomicrons. The most pronounced decrease of activity was found for the double mutant W393A/W394A which retained only 6% of the activity of the wild-type lipase, while 70% of the activity against water-soluble tributyrylglycerol was retained. In the case of chylomicrons also the affinity for the substrate particles was lowered, as indicated by severalfold higher apparent Km values. This effect was less prominent with the synthetic lipid emulsion.We conclude that the tryptophan cluster Trp390-Trp393-Trp394 contributes to binding of lipoprotein lipase to lipid/water interfaces.

https://openalex.org/W2095376376,"The tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins induced in neutrophils by soluble and particulate stimuli is thought to be crucial for initiating antimicrobial responses. Although activation of tyrosine kinases is thought to mediate this event, the role of tyrosine phosphatases in the initiation and modulation of neutrophil responses remains largely undefined. We investigated the role of Src homology 2-containing tyrosine phosphatase 1 (SHP-1; also known as protein tyrosine phosphatase 1C (PTP1C), hematopoetic cell phosphatase, PTP-N6, and SHPTP-1), a phosphatase expressed primarily in hemopoietic cells, in the activation of human neutrophils. SHP-1 mRNA and protein were detected in these cells, and the enzyme was found to be predominantly localized to the cytosol in unstimulated cells. Following stimulation with neutrophil agonists such as phorbol ester, chemotactic peptide, or opsonized zymosan, a fraction of the phosphatase redistributed to the cytoskeleton. Agonist treatment also induced significant decreases (30-60%) in SHP-1 activity, which correlated temporally with increases in the cellular phosphotyrosine content. Phosphorylation of SHP-1 on serine residues was associated with the inhibition of its enzymatic activity, suggesting a causal relationship. Accordingly, both the agonist-evoked phosphorylation of SHP-1 and the inhibition of its catalytic activity were blocked by treatment with bisindolylmaleimide I, a potent and specific inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKC) activity. Immunoprecipitated SHP-1 was found to be phosphorylated efficiently by purified PKC in vitro. Such phosphorylation also caused a decrease in the phosphatase activity of SHP-1. Together, these data suggest that inhibition of SHP-1 by PKC-mediated serine phosphorylation plays a role in facilitating the accumulation of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins following neutrophil stimulation. These findings provide a new link between the PKC and tyrosine phosphorylation branches of the signaling cascade that triggers antimicrobial responses in human neutrophils."

In this paper, we report that the protein substrate specificity of yeast FTase can be switched to that of a closely related enzyme, geranylgeranyltransferase type I (GGTase I) by a single amino acid change at one of the three residues: Ser-159, Tyr-362, or Tyr-366 of its β-subunit, Dpr1. All three Dpr1 mutants can function as either FTase or GGTase I β subunit in vivo, although some differences in efficiency were observed. These results point to the importance of two distinct regions (one at 159 and the other at 362 and 366) of Dpr1 for the recognition of the protein substrate. Analysis of the protein, after site directed mutagenesis was used to change Ser-159 to all possible amino acids, showed that either asparagine or aspartic acid at this position allowed FTase β to function as GGTase I β. A similar site-directed mutagenesis study on Tyr-362 showed that leucine, methionine, or isoleucine at this position also resulted in the ability of mutant FTase β to function as GGTase I β. Interestingly, in both position 159 and 362 substitutions, amino acids that could change the protein substrate specificity had similar van der Waals volumes.

These results demonstrate that the conversion of the protein substrate specificity of FTase to that of GGTase I can be accomplished by introducing a distinct size amino acid at either of the two residues, 159 and 362."

Interaction of CD40L with its receptor CD40 induces proliferation of and isotype switching in B lymphocytes. Recently we solved the x-ray structure of recombinant soluble CD40L and showed that, similar to other members of the tumor necrosis factor family, CD40L indeed exists as a trimer. We now report that, under normal physiological conditions, CD40L molecules exist as heteromultimeric complexes. These CD40L complexes, made of the full length and smaller fragments of CD40L, are present on the cell surface of T lymphocytes and are capable of interacting with CD40 molecule. A prominent fragment with a mass of 31 kDa accounts for as much as half of the CD40L on the surface of Jurkat cells. N-terminal sequence data revealed that this fragment lacks the cytoplasmic tail. A minor 18-kDa fragment of CD40L was also characterized which lacks the cytoplasmic tail, transmembrane region, and stalk region of the extracellular domain. The presence of CD40L heteromultimeric variants implies an additional regulation of the functional activity of this ligand complex.

Members of the TNF family characteristically exist in type II membrane protein configuration consisting of a short cytoplasmic N-terminal domain, a transmembrane domain, an extracellular stalk, and a TNF-homologous C-terminal region (for review, see 13Farrah T. Smith C.A. Nature. 1992; 358: 26Google Scholar). X-ray structures are available for three members of the TNF family: TNF-α (14Jones E.Y. Stuart D.I. Walker N.P. Nature. 1989; 338: 225-228Google Scholar), LT-α (15Eck M.J. Sprang S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17595-17605Google Scholar, 16Eck M.J. Ultsch M. Rinderknecht E. de Vose A.M. Sprang S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2119-2122Google Scholar), and, more recently, CD40L (17Karpusas M. Hsu Y.M. Wang J.H. Thompson J. Lederman S. Chess L. Thomas D. Structure. 1995; 3: 1031-1039Google Scholar). Despite the low protein sequence identity between these ligands, all three displayed similar three-dimensional structure. All exist as trimers consisting of three subunits, each folding as two β-sheet sandwiches with “jelly roll” or “Greek key” topology. Except for the LT-α homotrimer, which is expressed only as a secreted form, and TNF-α, which can be either membrane-anchored or secreted due to proteolytic cleavage, other members of the family were initially identified as membrane-anchored proteins (40Smith C.A. Farrah T. Goodwin R.G. Cell. 1994; 76: 959-962Google Scholar). However, more recent reports document that a soluble, biologically active, form of Fas ligand (FasL) (18Dhein J. Walczak H. Baumler C. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Nature. 1995; 373: 438-441Google Scholar) and CD40L (19Graf D. Muller S. Korthauer U. van Kooten C. Weise C. Kroczek R.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 1749-1754Google Scholar, 20Pietravalle F. Lecoanet-Henchoz S. Blasey H. Aubry J. Elson G. Edgerton M.D. Bonnefoy J. Gauchat J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5965-5967Google Scholar) can be released into medium of cultured cells. The identification of soluble FasL and CD40L is intriguing in that it broadens the mechanism of these ligands to diffusible cytokine-like activity. Nonetheless, in the case of CD40L, it has been well documented that the helper function of T lymphocytes is contact-dependent indicating that the membrane-anchored form is physiologically relevant (for review, see 21Parker D.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 11: 331-360Google Scholar). Given the biological importance of the cell surface CD40L, we therefore investigated the biochemical characteristics of this membrane protein. We report here that, in addition to the full length protein, two shorter forms of CD40L are present on the surface of T lymphocytes. We show that the full-length CD40L molecules form heteromultimeric complexes with these two shorter forms of ligand. Our results indicate that the cell surface CD40L molecules are primarily heterotrimers consisting of the full-length and truncated, p31, forms of CD40L. The Jurkat clones D1.1 and B2.7 have been described (22Yellin M.J. Lee J.J. Chess L. Lederman S. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 3389-3395Google Scholar, 23Lederman S. Yellin M.J. Krichevsky A. Belko J. Lee J.J. Chess L. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1091-1101Google Scholar). Murine monoclonal antibody 5c8 is a murine IgG2a described previously (23Lederman S. Yellin M.J. Krichevsky A. Belko J. Lee J.J. Chess L. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1091-1101Google Scholar), the Fv region of 5c8 was humanized by CDR exchange and was fused with a human Fc region of IgG1 subclass 2E. Garber, unpublished result. and is referred to herein as humanized 5c8 (h.5c8). Control human IgG1 antibody was purchased from Protos Immunoresearch (San Francisco, CA). Rb784 antiserum was generated by immunizing the rabbit with a synthetic peptide corresponding to the N-terminal 15 amino acids (MIETYNQTSPRSAAT) of CD40L (4Graf D. Korthauer U. Mages H.W. Senger G.

Immunol. 1994; 31: 471-484Google Scholar) coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) using the maleimide-activated KLH kit (Pierce) following the manufacturer's protocol. COS7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% heat inactivated FBS. The human CD40 cDNA was cloned by polymerase chain reaction from a λgt10 cDNA expression library made from human tonsil cells and subcloned into a pUC-derived vector. A soluble human CD40-Fc fusion protein (CD40-Fc) was generated by first mutagenizing Ala-Leu residues (174-175), within the transmembrane region, to Val-Asp in order to introduce a SalI restriction site and then fusing the entire CD40 extracellular domain to a cDNA encoding the hinge and Fc regions of a human IgG1. A cytomegalovirus immediate-early (IE) promoter-driven expression vector (pSAB132, Biogen) was constructed and transfected into COS7 cells. Transfected cells that secreted CD40-Fc were identified by both CD40-specific and human IgG Fc-specific antibodies. An adenovirus major late promoter-driven expression vector containing the dihydrofolate reductase selectable marker (pMDR901, Biogen) was constructed and transfected into CHO cells to produce stable cell lines. Clones were selected in 200 nM methotrexate, and those expressing CD40-Fc were identified by screening supernatants by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or Western blots using human IgG Fc-specific antibody. The best producing clone was adapted to suspension culture for large scale fermentation. Mutant forms of CD40L were generated by unique site elimination mutagenesis using a kit following the manufacturer's recommended protocol (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The target pUC-derived plasmid contained the wild-type CD40L cDNA (the CD40L open reading frame flanked by 21 base pairs of 5ʹ- and 109 base pairs of 3ʹ-untranslated sequences) (4Graf D. Korthauer U. Mages H.W. Senger G. Kroczek R.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 3191-3194Google Scholar, 24Covey L.R. Cleary A.M. Yellin M.J. Ware R. Sullivan G. Belko J. Parker M. Rothman P. Chess L. Lederman S. Mol. Immunol. 1994; 31: 471-484Google Scholar). Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. A cytoplasmic domain-deleted mutant (cyt(-)) was engineered to encode a human CD40L of Met-21 to Leu-261 by removal of the coding region corresponding to amino acid residues 1-20. Wild-type or mutant CD40L cDNA was subcloned into an expression vector in which heterologous gene expression is driven by a cytomegalovirus immediate-early (IE) promoter. The vector contains an SV40 transcriptional termination and poly(A) addition site. The expression vector also contains an SV40 origin of replication for high copy expression in COS7 cells. COS7 cells were electroporated with supercoiled plasmid. Media from stably transfected cell lines were collected, concentrated 10-fold by Amicon ultrafiltration using YM30 spiral filtration cartridge (Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA), and purified using a protein A-Sepharose 4B column followed by passage through a Superdex 200 (Pharmacia) gel filtration column for buffer exchange with phosphate-buffered saline. Metabolic radiolabeling was performed in Cys/Met-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (FBS), 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mM glutamine, and 100 μCi/ml Tran35S-label (DuPont NEN) for 6 h. The cultures were then supplemented with a 10% volume of normal RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% non-dialyzed FBS for 15 h. For surface biotinylation, 1 × 107 cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline at 40C, after which sulfosuccinimidobiotin (Sulfo-NHS-Biotin, catalogue number 21217, Pierce) was added to a final concentration of 500 μg/ml, incubated at room temperature for 30 min with agitation. The cells were then treated with 100 mM glycine, pH 8.3, to quench the labeling reaction. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 1% Brij 96, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA, freshly supplemented with 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation (14,000 × g, 10 min). The supernatants were precleared with protein A-Sepharose 4B beads at 40C for 2 h and immunoprecipitated with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads and 5 μg of the specific antibody as indicated. Immune complexes were collected on protein A beads which were then washed three times with lysis buffer and treated with Laemmli sample buffer before being resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Humanized 5c8-immunoprecipitated material was resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 10-20% gradient gel (Daiichi, Japan) under reducing conditions. Protein fingerprints were generated by digestion with endoproteinase-Glu-C (catalogue number 791 156, Boehringer Mannheim) prior to running the second dimension SDS-PAGE (25Cleveland D.W. Pittenger M.F. Feramisco J.R. Nature. 1983; 305: 738-740Google Scholar). CD40L was immunoprecipitated from lysates of Jurkat D1.1 cells using humanized 5c8 antibody. The immunoprecipitate was resolved on a 10-20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions and transferred to an Immobilon P membrane (Millipore) following a previously described procedure (26Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Google Scholar). The PVDF membrane was stained with Ponceau S, and regions corresponding to the full-length CD40L, p31, and p18 were excised and subjected to N-terminal sequence analysis using automated Edman degradation in an Applied Biosystems (ABI) 470A protein Sequencer. Data were processed using a model 610A data system as described (27Hewick R.M. Hunkapillar M.W. Hood L.E. Dreyer W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7990-7997Google Scholar, 28Applied Biosystems (1987) Model 470A Protein-Peptide Sequencing System User's Manual, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA.Google Scholar). The resulting phenylthiohydantoin (PTH) derivatives were analyzed on-line using an ABI 120A PTH analyzer equipped with a PTH-C18 2.1 × 220 mm column. The PTH-derivative analysis system was calibrated prior to each sequence run using an external standard method (ABI). Peak height was used for quantifying PTH-derivatives. To study the biochemical characteristics of CD40L, we chose the Jurkat D1.1 cell, a human T cell line on which the CD40L is constitutively expressed. Jurkat D1.1 cells were metabolically labeled and immunoprecipitated with reagents specific for CD40L humanized 5c8 (h.5c8) and CD40-Fc fusion protein (CD40-Fc). Murine 5c8 monoclonal antibody and CD40-Fc were shown previously to specifically recognize the CD40L protein (29Lederman S. Yellin M.J. Cleary A.M. Pernis A. Inghirami G. Cohn L.E. Covey L.R.

Maliszewski C.R. Clark E.A. Smith C.A. Crabstein K.H. Cosman D. Spriggs M.K. Nature. 1992; 357: 80-82Google Scholar). Fig. 1, a and b, shows that CD40L with an apparent molecular mass of 33 kDa was observed in both D1.1 Jurkat cells and in transfected COS cells when h.5c8 or CD40-Fc was used for immunoprecipitation, but not with an isotype control human IgG1. A less abundant protein with an apparent molecular mass of 31 kDa (p31) was co-immunoprecipitated with 33-kDa CD40L. p31 was further characterized utilizing a rabbit anti-CD40L antiserum, Rb784, which specifically recognizes the N-terminal portion (the cytoplasmic domain, since this is a type II protein) of CD40L. As shown (Fig. 2) h.5c8 immunoprecipitated both the wild-type, and the cytoplasmic domain deleted mutant (cyt(-)) CD40L from cell lysates of metabolically labeled COS7 cells transiently expressing CD40L whereas Rb784 immunoprecipitated only the wild-type and not the cyt(-) CD40L from similar lysates. Interestingly, using lysates prepared from Jurkat D1.1 or COS7 cells expressing wild-type CD40L, Rb784 consistently immunoprecipitated the p31 protein (Fig. 1, a and b, and Fig. 2) indicating that expression of full-length CD40L is critical for the co-immunoprecipitation of p31 by Rb784 but not by h.5c8. These results suggested that the p31 is likely to be a fragment of CD40L and is missing the cytoplasmic domain that is recognized by Rb784. Alternatively, p31 is an intracellular protein associated with the cytoplasmic domain of CD40L.Fig. 2Rabbit antiserum Rb784 recognizes the cytoplasmic tail of CD40L. Cell lysates prepared from 35S-metabolically labeled COS7 cells transfected with mock plasmid or plasmid containing cDNA encoding either wild-type or cyt(-) CD40L were immunoprecipitated with h.5c8, Rb784, or CD40-Fc fusion protein. Proteins were analyzed by a 10-20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by autoradiography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine if p31 is an intracellular or extracellular protein, Jurkat D1.1 cells were labeled with Sulfo-NHS-biotin (a biotinylating reagent which is not membrane-permeable, hence capable of labeling only the cell surface proteins), lysed, and used for immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitates with h.5c8, CD40-Fc, and Rb784 contained both CD40L and the p31 protein when visualized with streptavidin-HRP (Fig. 3). We also noticed that the abundance of the CD40L and the p31 proteins are comparable. This is in contrast to the results obtained from the metabolically labeled cell lysates in which the full-length 33-kDa CD40L is the predominant form. In addition, a doublet of minor bands with an apparent molecular mass of 18 kDa (p18) was also detected in immunoprecipitates with h.5c8, CD40-Fc, and Rb784, but not with control human IgG1 (Fig. 3). These results showed that both p31 and p18 are present on the cell surface, and each protein is either biochemically related to CD40L or is an extracellular protein associated with cell surface CD40L. The p31 protein was further characterized by limited proteolysis. Lysates of biotin-labeled Jurkat cells were immunoprecipitated by h.5c8 and resolved by SDS-PAGE as before, and a limited proteolysis using the V8 protease was performed. Samples were then analyzed by two-dimensional SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. Fig. 4 shows that V8 protease treatment generated three fragments each from CD40L (spot 1) and p31 protein (spot 2) with apparent molecular masses of 27 kDa, 17 kDa, and 14 kDa (spot 1-1, 1-2, and 1-3), and 25 kDa, 15 kDa, and 12 kDa, (spot 2-1, 2-2, and 2-3), respectively. Thus, both full-length CD40L (spot 1) and p31 (spot 2) generate a similar pattern of cleavage products that differ in mass by 2 kDa. Such a parallel pattern indicates that p31 is likely to be a fragment of or a modified variant of CD40L. This inference was validated by sequence data described below. The intensity of cleavage product from p18 was too minor to interpret. Definitive data on the relationship of p31 and p18 to CD40L was obtained by N-terminal sequencing. CD40L, p31, and p18 were immunoprecipitated from Jurkat cells by h.5c8, resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a PVDF membrane, and subjected to N-terminal sequence analysis. Results from these analysis are shown in Fig. 5. N-terminal sequence data for 33-kDa CD40L matches the predicted translated protein sequence of CD40L (4Graf D. Korthauer U. Mages H.W. Senger G. Kroczek R.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 3191-3194Google Scholar, 24Covey L.R. Cleary A.M. Yellin M.J. Ware R. Sullivan G. Belko J. Parker M. Rothman P. Chess L. Lederman S. Mol. Immunol. 1994; 31: 471-484Google Scholar), indicating that Met-1 is preserved in the matured protein. The p31 protein sequence starts with Met-21 indicating that the difference between full-length CD40L and p31 is the result of N-terminal truncation (4Graf D. Korthauer U. Mages H.W. Senger G. Kroczek R.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 3191-3194Google Scholar, 24Covey L.R. Cleary A.M. Yellin M.J. Ware R. Sullivan G. Belko J. Parker M. Rothman P. Chess L. Lederman S. Mol. Immunol. 1994; 31: 471-484Google Scholar). The p18 protein starts with Gln-114 of the CD40L sequence and therefore is missing the entire cytoplasmic domain, the transmembrane region, and the extracellular stalk of the CD40L. These results unambiguously showed that both p31 and p18 are fragments of the full-length CD40L which lack the cytoplasmic tail. The fact that a peptide antibody, Rb784, specific for the cytoplasmic tail, is still capable of immunoprecipitating p31 and p18 indicates that p31 and p18 exist as heteromeric complexes with full-length CD40L. We have used biochemical and immunological methods to investigate the nature of CD40L on the surface of T lymphocytes and transfected cells through which we revealed several important characteristics of CD40L. First, in addition to full-length CD40L, two fragments of CD40L, p31 and p18, are present on the surface of Jurkat D1.1 and CD40L-transfected COS7 cells. N-terminal sequence data indicate that p31 lacks the cytoplasmic tail while p18 lacks the cytoplasmic tail and transmembrane domain as well as the extracellular stalk. Second, full-length CD40L molecules, together with p31 or p18, form heteromultimers on the cell surface of both Jurkat D1.1 and transfected COS7 cells. The existence of CD40L heteromultimers was evidenced by the ability of antiserum Rb784, which recognizes only the cytoplasmic domain of CD40L, to immunoprecipitate p31 and p18 along with full-length CD40L. Thus, p31 and p18 are physically associated with full-length CD40L on the surface of both T lymphocytes and transfected COS7 cells. We showed previously by x-ray data (17Karpusas M. Hsu Y.M. Wang J.H. Thompson J. Lederman S. Chess L. Thomas D. Structure. 1995; 3: 1031-1039Google Scholar) that recombinant soluble CD40L molecules starting at Gly-116 exist as trimers indicating that the information for trimerization resides within the extracellular C-terminal 146 amino acid residues, the TNF-like domain. Thus, the heteromultimeric CD40L is likely to be trimeric. Third, cell surface CD40L complexes are primarily heteromultimeric, comprised of full-length CD40L and p31, while the intracellular CD40L complexes are primarily homomultimers of full-length molecules. This is based on the observation that comparable amounts of full-length CD40L and p31 were immunoprecipitated from lysates of surface-labeled cells while much less p31 was observed from lysates of metabolically labeled cells. The difference in full-length CD40L:p31 ratios implicates an intracellular CD40L pool. This is consistent with previously reported preformed intracellular CD40L in a subset of human CD4+ T lymphocytes (41Casamayor-Palleja M. Kahn M. MacLennan I.C.M. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1293-1301Google Scholar). In addition, very little p18 was found in either lysate, indicating that only a minor fraction of heteromultimeric CD40L complexes contains p18. Finally, our results show that the full-length homomultimeric CD40L as well as surface heteromultimeric CD40L variants are capable of interacting with CD40 since they can be immunoprecipitated using CD40-Fc. Our data also suggest a mechanism by which heterotrimeric CD40L variants are generated. Since p31 begins with methionine, the possibility exists that an alternative initiation site is used to translate p31 directly. Besides lack of a consensus Kozak sequence (31Kozak M. J. Cell. Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Google Scholar), the observation that metabolically labeled CD40L molecules are primarily full-length while cell surface molecules comprise nearly equal amounts of full-length CD40L and p31 suggests that p31 is proteolytically derived from full-length CD40L. We propose that full-length CD40L molecules assemble as homotrimers and, during surface-bound transport or once on the cell surface, undergo proteolysis to generate CD40L-p31 heterotrimers. A minor fraction of CD40L, homotrimeric full-length CD40L or CD40-p31 complexes, may undergo an additional proteolytic processing to generate heterotrimers containing p18. Importantly, our results indicate that cleavage at Arg-48/Arg-49 or Lys-106/Lys-107, identified in the extracellular domain of CD40L as potential proteolytic sites (30Armitage R.J. Fanslow W.C. Strockbine L. Sato T.A. Clifford K.N. Macduff B.M. Anderson D.M. Gimpel S.D. Davis S.T. Maliszewski C.R. Clark E.A. Smith C.A. Crabstein K.H. Cosman D. Spriggs M.K. Nature. 1992; 357: 80-82Google Scholar), is not responsible for generation of the described heterotrimeric variants. Except for cell surface lymphotoxin-α1β2 (LT-α1β2) (32Browning J.L. Ngam E.A. Lawton P. DeMarinis J. Tizard R. Chow E.P. Hession C. O'Brine-Greco H Foley S.F. Ware C.F. Cell. 1993; 72: 847-856Google Scholar), formation of heterotrimeric complexes have not been formally described for members of the TNF ligand family. Nevertheless, some evidence suggested that heterotrimeric forms of TNF-α and Fas ligand (FasL) may transiently exist (33Kriegler M. Perez C. DeFay K. Albert I. Lu S.D. Cell. 1988; 53: 45-53Google Scholar, 34Tanaka M. Suda T. Takahashi T. Nagata S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1129-1135Google Scholar, 35Nobuhiko K. Kawasaki A. Ebata T. Ohmoto H. Ikeda S. Inoue S. Yoshino K. Okumura K. Yagita H. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1777-1783Google Scholar). As heterotrimeric CD40L has never been reported previously, the generation of the heterotrimeric CD40L is quite unique in several aspects. First, at least two distinct proteases are involved: one located inside the cell cleaves the cytoplasmic tail off full-length CD40L to generate p31, another, likely located on the cell surface, cleaves at the carboxyl end of the extracellular stalk to produce p18. Expression of these proteases is not limited to lymphoid cells since the heterotrimeric complexes were also observed in transfected COS7 cells. Second, unlike heterotrimeric TNF-α and FasL which appear as minor forms (34Tanaka M. Suda T. Takahashi T. Nagata S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1129-1135Google Scholar, 35Nobuhiko K. Kawasaki A. Ebata T. Ohmoto H. Ikeda S. Inoue S. Yoshino K. Okumura K. Yagita H. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1777-1783Google Scholar), the heterotrimeric complexes represent the major form of CD40L expressed on the cell surface as nearly equal amounts of full-length CD40L and p31 were observed in surface-labeled cell lysate. Finally, in contrast to TNF-α and FasL heteromers which are present on cell surface transiently, the membrane-anchored CD40L heterotrimers appear to be quite stable. In a pulse-chase experiment, only a small amount of soluble CD40L was detected in the medium of cultured cells (data not shown). Thus, the heterotrimeric CD40L-p31 complex represents a kinetically stable form rather than merely a partially proteolyzed product prior to release from the cell surface. It should be emphasized that heterotrimeric CD40L complexes are functionally active. We showed that both homotrimeric and heterotrimeric CD40L are capable of interacting with CD40 as CD40-Fc immunoprecipitates these variants. We also showed that CD40L molecules on Jurkat D1.1 cells, capable of stimulating B cells via CD40, exist primarily as heterotrimers. It is conceivable that differential post-translational proteolysis may result in functionally distinct forms of CD40L. Consistent with this notion is the observation that upon activation of Th cells, there is a lag of functional activity of newly synthesized CD40L (37Castle B.E. Kishimoto K. Stearns C. Brown M.L. Kehry M.R. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 1777-1788Google Scholar). Thus, a post-translational modification might be required for CD40L to deliver the contact-dependent signal(s) (37Castle B.E. Kishimoto K. Stearns C. Brown M.L. Kehry M.R. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 1777-1788Google Scholar). If so, heterotrimeric CD40L-p31 complexes would be the functionally active CD40L. Considering the proteolysis processing leads to conversion of homotrimeric full-length CD40L to heterotrimeric CD40L-p31 complex, it is possible that additional proteolysis may lead to the release of homotrimeric soluble CD40L from cell surface. Alternatively, membrane-anchored CD40L, either pre-existed intracellularly (41Casamayor-Palleja M. Kahn M. MacLennan I.C.M. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1293-1301Google Scholar) or endocytosed after interaction with CD40 (43Yellin M.J. Sippel K. Inghirami G. Covey L.R. Lee J.J. Sinning J. Clark E.A. Chess L. Lederman S. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 598-608Google Scholar), may undergo a stimulation-dependent proteolytic process to generate the soluble CD40L in microsomes and subsequently released into the medium (42Pietravalle F. Lecoanet-Henchoz S. Blasey H. Aubry J.P. Elson G. Edgerton M.D. Bonnefoy J.Y. Gauchat J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5965-5967Google Scholar). The existence of biologically active soluble CD40L was first implicated in conditioned medium of a murine thymoma line (36Armitage R.J. Sato R.A. Macduff B.M. Clifford K.N. Alpert A.R. Smith C.A. Fanslow W.C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 2071-2076Google Scholar) and later shown to be rapidly released by T lymphocytes upon activation (19Graf D. Muller S. Korthauer U. van Kooten C. Weise C. Kroczek R.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 1749-1754Google Scholar). Consistently, recombinant soluble CD40L molecules were shown to be biologically active (17Karpusas M. Hsu Y.M. Wang J.H. Thompson J. Lederman S. Chess L. Thomas D. Structure. 1995; 3: 1031-1039Google Scholar, 39Mazzei G.J. Edgerton M.D. Losberger C. Lecoanet H.S. Graber P. Durandy A. Gauchat J. Bernard A. Allet B. Bonnefoy J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7025-7028Google Scholar). It should be noted that the p18 reported here and the soluble CD40L released from activated T lymphocytes (19Graf D. Muller S. Korthauer U. van Kooten C. Weise C. Kroczek R.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 1749-1754Google Scholar) are different in their N termini by one amino acid. The reason for this is unclear. Nonetheless, soluble CD40L molecules differing in their N termini are biologically active (17Karpusas M. Hsu Y.M. Wang J.H. Thompson J. Lederman S. Chess L. Thomas D. Structure. 1995; 3: 1031-1039Google Scholar, 19Graf D. Muller S. Korthauer U. van Kooten C. Weise C. Kroczek R.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 1749-1754Google Scholar, 39Mazzei G.J. Edgerton M.D. Losberger C. Lecoanet H.S. Graber P. Durandy A. Gauchat J. Bernard A. Allet B. Bonnefoy J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7025-7028Google Scholar) indicating that a specific N terminus (within the Glu-108 to Gly-116 region) is not critical for their functional activity. It is intriguing that although the soluble form of CD40L can activate B cell, direct cell contact with activated T cells is required for delivery of the CD40-mediated signal for B cell proliferation and differentiation. Thus, it is likely that signals transduced by CD40 via interaction with membrane-anchored heterotrimeric CD40L and that of the homotrimeric soluble CD40L are qualitatively different. We propose that interaction with CD40 may cause proteolysis of surface-anchored CD40L to generate soluble homotrimeric p18. Considering bi-directional signaling capacity of receptor-ligand interactions (38van Essen D. Kikutani H. Gray D. Nature. 1995; 378: 620-623Google Scholar), generation of such soluble CD40L molecules would completely abrogate the signal-receiving capacity of T lymphocytes through CD40L. The identification of heterotrimeric CD40L on the surface of T lymphocytes implicates an additional regulation of this protein during contact signaling between T and B cells. The post-translational modifications leading to expression of these heterotrimeric variants may provide a potential intervening step(s) for modulation of the functional activity of CD40L.

https://openalex.org/W2048010223,"DmpK from Pseudomonas sp. strain CF600 represents a group of proteins required by phenol-degrading bacteria that utilize a multicomponent iron-containing phenol hydroxylase. DmpK has been overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity; it lacks redox cofactors and was found to strongly inhibit phenol hydroxylase in vitro. Chemical cross-linking experiments established that DmpK binds to the two largest subunits of the oxygenase component of the hydroxylase; this may interfere with binding of the hydroxylase activator protein, DmpM, causing inhibition. Since expression of DmpK normally appears to be much lower than that of the components of the oxygenase, inhibition may not occur in vivo. Hence, the interaction between DmpK and the oxygenase manifested in the inhibition and cross-linking results prompted construction of E. coli strains in which the oxygenase component was expressed in the presence and absence of a low molar ratio of DmpK. Active oxygenase was detected only when expressed in the presence of DmpK. Furthermore, inactive oxygenase could be activated in vitro by adding ferrous iron, in a process that was dependent on the presence of DmpK. These results indicate that DmpK plays a role in assembly of the active form of the oxygenase component of phenol hydroxylase.

There is currently much interest in the biochemistry of oxygenases, which control the entry of toxic compounds into catabolic pathways that allow microorganisms to break them down to carbon dioxide and water. A recently discovered class of aromatic oxygenases includes phenol (1Nordlund I. Powlowski J. Shingler V. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6826-6833Google Scholar, 2Powlowski J. Shingler V. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6834-6840Google Scholar, 3Powlowski J. Shingler V. Biodegradation. 1994; 5: 219-236Google Scholar) and toluene (4Yen K.-M. Karl M.R. Blatt L.M. Simon M.J. Winter R.B.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14066-14076Google Scholar), monooxygenases that are in many ways similar to the relatively well characterized binuclear iron center-containing enzyme, methane mononoxygenase (reviewed in 7Lipscomb J.D. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 371-399Google Scholar). Various types of experimental evidence indicate that these enzyme systems all utilize an FAD/[2Fe-2S] center containing reductase, a low molecular weight activator protein (similar to MmoB), and a heteromultimeric (αβγ) oxygenase component. The degradation of phenol by Pseudomonas sp. strain CF600 requires the participation of polypeptides encoded by the 15 genes of the dmp operon (3Powlowski J. Shingler V. Biodegradation. 1994; 5: 219-236Google Scholar), and is initiated by the hydroxylation of phenol to catechol. The gene products of dmpLMNOP were found to be necessary for phenol hydroxylase activity in an in vitro assay containing phenol, NADH, and Fe2+ (2Powlowski J. Shingler V. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6834-6840Google Scholar). The reductase component of this enzyme is encoded by dmpP, the oxygenase component by dmpLNO, and the activator protein by dmpM (2Powlowski J. Shingler V. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6834-6840Google Scholar, 3Powlowski J. Shingler V. Biodegradation. 1994; 5: 219-236Google Scholar). 1J. Powlowski, D. Tito, and E. Cadieux, manuscript in preparation. Polypeptide requirements for enzyme activity are summarized in Scheme 1. An additional gene, dmpK, is located immediately upstream of the phenol hydroxylase genes in the operon. The presence of dmpK was found to be necessary to allow growth on phenol of a strain of Pseudomonas harboring dmpLMNOP together with enzymes necessary to catabolize catechol, the product of phenol hydroxylase (1Nordlund I. Powlowski J. Shingler V. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6826-6833Google Scholar). However, the function of the 10.5-kDa gene product remained obscure. Nucleotide sequencing has since revealed the presence of genes encoding similar proteins clustered together with phenol hydroxylase genes in other strains of Pseudomonas (96% identity) (8Ng L.C. Shingler V. Sze C.C. Poh C.L. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 151: 29-36Google Scholar, 9Herrmann H. Muller C. Schmidt I. Mahnke J. Petruschka L. Hanke K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 247: 240-246Google Scholar) and in Acinetobacter (52% identity over 68 amino acids) (10Ehrt S. Schirmer F. Hillen W. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 13-20Google Scholar). Southern hybridization experiments also established the presence of DNA homologous to dmpK in a number of phenol-degrading marine bacteria, and in the archetypal phenol degrader, Pseudomonas U (11Nordlund I. Powlowski J. Hagström Ä. Shingler V. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 2695-2703Google Scholar). Furthermore, a gene (tbmA) associated with a multicomponent toluene monooxygenase system exhibits 38% identity, over 55 amino acids, with DmpK (12Johnson G.R. Olsen R.H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 3336-3346Google Scholar). The functions of these DmpK homologues have not been defined, nor have any homologous proteins of known function been identified in sequence data base searches. In this report we have overexpressed and purified DmpK, and characterized its interaction with the oxygenase component of phenol hydroxylase. The data are consistent with the involvement of DmpK in iron-dependent assembly of an active oxygenase. All chemicals were reagent grade or higher. The purification from phenol-grown Pseudomonas sp. strain CF600 of DmpM and the oxygenase component (DmpLNO) of phenol hydroxylase will be described elsewhere.1 The reductase component, DmpP, was purified using a previously published method (2Powlowski J. Shingler V. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6834-6840Google Scholar). Catechol 2,3-dioxygenase was purified essentially as described previously (13Arciero D.M. Orville A.M. Lipscomb J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14035-14044Google Scholar) from Escherichia coli harboring pMMB26 (14Bagdasarian M.M. Amann E. Lurz R. Ruckert B. Bagdasarian M. Gene (Amst.). 1983; 26: 273-282Google Scholar). Strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table I. DNA manipulations were performed according to standard techniques (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). In order to express DmpK alone and as a fusion protein with TrpE, the dmpK gene was first amplified by polymerase chain reaction as an NdeI to BamHI fragment (base pairs 745-1052; 1Nordlund I. Powlowski J. Shingler V. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6826-6833Google Scholar) and cloned into a pBluescript (Stratagene) derivative, in which an NdeI site had previously been introduced into the polylinker, to generate pVI202. Both strands of the resulting fragment were sequenced to ensure that no mutations had been introduced.Table I.Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this studyStrain or PlasmidProperties/genesar and m refer to host restriction and modification systems respectively.

ApR, ampicillin-resistant. Open table in a new tab The dmpK gene was introduced into a pET expression vector (16Rosenburg A.H. Lade B.N. Chui D.-S. Lin S.W. Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 56: 125-135Google Scholar), and the resulting plasmid was used for overexpression of DmpK. The NdeI-BamHI fragment of pVI202 was cloned between these sites of pET3a to generate pVI203 with dmpK under control of the T7 promoter of the vector. A linker was introduced into the NdeI site of pVI202, generating pVI204, to facilitate cloning of dmpK as an EcoRI-BamHI fragment in frame with the trpE gene in pATH11 (19Klempnauer K.-H. Sippel A.E. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2719-2725Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid, pVI205, encodes the first 330 amino acids of TrpE fused to the 92 residues of DmpK with 3 residues (Glu, Phe, and Arg) inserted at the junction. In order to compare the activities of the oxygenase component (DmpLNO) of phenol hydroxylase expressed in the presence and absence of the dmpK gene product, dmpK was inserted into pVI293 in place of dmpP to generate pPOW100; this plasmid expresses dmpLNOK from the inducible tac promoter of the pMMB66 vector. A BglII-EcoRI fragment from pVI293 (encompassing base pairs 3728-5448 of the phenol hydroxylase coding region; 1Nordlund I. Powlowski J. Shingler V. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6826-6833Google Scholar) was excised and cloned between these sites in pET3a. An NdeI site was introduced into this plasmid at the ATG start codon of dmpP using the U.S.E. mutagenesis kit (Pharmacia). The NdeI-EcoRI fragment of the resulting plasmid, encompassing dmpP, was then replaced by the NdeI-EcoRI fragment, encoding dmpK, from pVI203. Finally, the BglII-EcoRI fragment was re-excised and introduced between these sites of pVI293 to generate pPOW100. A related plasmid, pPOW101, was constructed in parallel, except that the NdeI-EcoRI fragment introduced from pVI203 was substituted by the NdeI-EcoRI fragment from the vector, pET3a. The BglII-EcoRI fragment of the resulting plasmid was then cloned between these sites in pV1293 to generate pPOW101. This plasmid thus expresses only dmpLNO, together with an unrelated 16-amino acid peptide, from the inducible tac promoter of the pMMB66 vector. Recombinant DmpK was expressed after introducing pVI203 into E. coli BL21 (DE3). Fresh transformants were used to inoculate Luria broth (LB) containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and glucose (0.4%), and the cells were then grown at 37°C with vigorous shaking to OD650 = 0.6-0.8. Cells were then harvested by centrifugation, washed with prewarmed medium, and resuspended in an equal volume of LB containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml); in some cases, this step was omitted with little noticeable change in DmpK expression levels. After incubation for an additional 1 h, cultures were supplemented with IPTG 2The abbreviations used are: IPTGisopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranosidePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisBS3bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberateMOPS3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acidTricineN-tris(hydroxymethyl)methylglycine.

High levels of expression were also achieved in cells that were grown using forced aeration in a fermentor. In this case, an overnight culture (400 ml) of cells grown in LB containing carbenecillin (100 μg/ml) was inoculated into a fermentor filled with 16 liters of LB broth containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml). Induction with IPTG (at OD650 = 0.85) and harvest were as described above. The procedure for expression of TrpE-DmpK was essentially as published previously (19Klempnauer K.-H. Sippel A.E. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2719-2725Google Scholar). In brief, M9 minimal medium (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and casamino acids (0.5%) was inoculated with fresh transformants, and the culture grown at 37°C with vigorous shaking for 3 h. Cells were then harvested, washed with the same medium lacking tryptophan, and resuspended in an equal volume of fresh medium: after growth for 1 h, cultures were supplemented with indoleacetic acid (20 μg/ml) to induce expression from the Ptrp promoter. After incubation of the cultures for an additional 3 h, they were harvested by centrifugation, washed with M9 medium, and then stored as a paste at −80°C until further use. In studies of the oxygenase component expressed from pPOW100 and pPOW101, overnight cultures were grown in LB containing ampicillin or carbenecillin (100 μg/ml) to OD650 = 0.7-1.0, and then supplemented with IPTG (0.5 mM). After incubation for an additional period, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed once with 20 mM MOPS, pH 7.4, and then stored as a paste at −80°C until further use. To obtain high titer antisera to the low molecular weight DmpK polypeptide (92 amino acids), a strategy employing both the TrpE-DmpK fusion and DmpK proteins was employed. Crude extracts of BL21(DE3)pVI203 (expressing DmpK) and BL21(DE3)pVI1205 (expressing TrpE-DmpK, 425 amino acids) were prepared by sonication of cells resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. After removal of cell debris by ultracentrifugation, soluble proteins were separated using 10-20% SDS-PAGE, and the polypeptide bands corresponding to the proteins of interest were excised and homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline. These preparations were used for rabbit antisera production by sequential immunization with TrpE-DmpK (2 injections) and DmpK (3 injections), using methods described previously (21Gullberg M. Noreus K. Brattsand G. Friedrich B. Shingler V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17499-17505Google Scholar). For Western blot analysis, proteins were transferred from 10-20% SDS-PAGE gradient gels to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using standard electroblotting methods (22Matsudaira, P., (ed) (1993) A Practical Guide to Protein and Peptide Purification for Microsequencing, 2nd Ed., pp. 71–80, Academic Press, Inc., Orlando, FL.Google Scholar). The blots were developed using an immunoblot assay kit (Bio-Rad) with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. The serum containing primary antibody was diluted 1:1000 for use. The buffer used during the purification procedure was 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 10% glycerol and 1 mM dithiothreitol (“Buffer A”). All purification procedures were performed at 4°C. The presence of DmpK in column fractions was monitored using SDS-PAGE. Crude extract of BL21(DE3)pVI203 (expressing DmpK) was prepared by sonication of a suspension of cells (51 g, wet weight) in buffer A (100 ml). A few milligrams of DNase I were then added, and the cell suspension was incubated at 4°C for 15 min with occasional stirring. The cell suspension was then sonicated in 15-s bursts (five times), followed by centrifugation at 70,500 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was decanted carefully and used for further purification. The crude extract was loaded (6 ml/min) onto a Fast-Flow DEAE-Sepharose column (36 × 2.6 cm) equilibrated with Buffer A. The column was then washed with approximately 200 ml of this buffer, followed by a linear gradient of 0-0.2 M NaCl in Buffer A (1500 ml). Fractions (12 ml) containing DmpK were combined and brought to 80% saturation with ammonium sulfate, and, after 15 min on ice, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation. Precipitated protein was dissolved in Buffer A (50 ml) containing ammonium sulfate (1 M) in preparation for the next step. One-third of the sample from the previous step was loaded (2 ml/min) onto a Phenyl-Sepharose (Pharmacia) High Performance column (36 × 2.6 cm) equilibrated with buffer A containing ammonium sulfate (1 M). The column was washed with 50 ml of this buffer and then developed with a linear gradient of ammonium sulfate (1-0 M in 1200 ml). Two peaks containing DmpK eluted, and fractions from each peak were pooled and subjected separately to the next, and final, purification step. In preparation for this step, proteins from the previous step were concentrated by precipitation with ammonium sulfate, as detailed above. Precipitated protein was redissolved in Buffer A and loaded (1 ml/min) onto a Sephacryl S-300HR column (95 × 2.5 cm) equilibrated with Buffer A. Proteins were eluted using the same buffer, and fractions (12 ml) were collected. Those fractions found to contain DmpK were combined, concentrated by ultrafiltration using an Amicon PM-10 membrane, and then stored as small aliquots at −80°C. On occasion, DmpK collected from the DEAE-Sepharose column was concentrated by precipitation with ammonium sulfate and applied directly to the gel filtration column. In these cases, a major peak eluted from the gel filtration column early on, and a minor one eluted much later; both contained DmpK, as judged by SDS-PAGE. However, preparations were less pure than those obtained when the Phenyl-Sepharose step was included. Cross-linking reactions were carried out at room temperature in 50 mM MOPS buffer, pH 7.4. Cross-linkers were dissolved just before use in ice-cold 50 mM MOPS buffer, pH 7.4. The cross-linking reactions with bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3) were done in a volume of 200 μl, containing oxygenase component (4.5 μM DmpLNO), DmpK (4.8 or 24 μM), and BS3 (230 μM). Control reactions were also run in which cross-linker or proteins were omitted. Cross-linkers were added to protein solutions at room temperature, and the mixtures were incubated for 30-60 min, after which reactions were quenched by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Cross-linked samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and/or Western blotting. Although both prestained (Bio-Rad) and unstained (Pharmacia) molecular weight markers were used, the reported molecular weights were estimated by comparison of RF values with those of the non-prestained standards. Protein concentrations were generally estimated using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method (Pierce) following the 60°C protocol supplied by the manufacturer and modified when necessary to remove interfering substances (23Brown R.E. Jarvis K.L. Hyland K.J. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 136-139Google Scholar). Bovine serum albumin was used as the standard. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out using standard techniques with Tris-glycine or Tricine buffer systems (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar, 25Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Google Scholar). Tris-glycine gels were run as 10-20% linear gradient gels under denaturing conditions, or as 5-30% native (reducing or nonreducing) gels. Occasionally precast gels supplied by ICN were used (Tris-SDS minismall CAP-GEL, 10-20%). Electrospray mass spectrometry was done using a Finnigan SSQ 7000 single quadrupole mass spectrometer. Samples were prepared by exchanging the buffer for distilled water using Bio-Spin columns (Bio-Rad). Samples were further diluted into methanol/water/acetic acid (50%/50%/0.5%) before infusion into the spectrometer. The native molecular weight of DmpK was estimated using a Bio-Sil SEC-125 HPLC column (Bio-Rad) (30 × 0.78 cm) equilibrated with 50 mM MOPS buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 M NaCl, and running at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The column was calibrated using proteins obtained from Boehringer-Mannheim: bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, chymotrypsinogen, cytochrome c, and aprotinin (Mr = 66,000, 45,000, 25,000, 12,500, and 6500, respectively). Amino-terminal sequencing of purified DmpK was done by Dr. Per-Ingvar Ohlsson, Department of Medical Chemistry, Umeå University, using an Applied Biosystems model 477A peptide sequencer. Circular dichroism spectra were collected at room temperature using a Jasco J-710 CD spectrometer. UV-visible measurements were performed using a Philips PU8710 spectrophotometer. Iron concentrations were estimated colorimetrically using o-phenanthroline after precipitation of protein with trichloroacetic acid (26Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 229: 763-770Google Scholar). Phenol hydroxylase assays were carried out at 25°C in 0.05 M Tris acetate buffer, pH 7.5, (1 ml) containing: NADH (300 μM), DmpM (0.12 μM), DmpP (0.38 μM), and catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (4-5 units, where 1 unit catalyzes the appearance of 1 μmol of 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde/min). After mixing these reagents together with preparations containing the oxygenase component, the appearance of 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde, the catechol ring-fission product, was monitored at 400 nm (under these conditions, ϵ400 was estimated to be 18,800 M−1 cm−1). Background rates in the absence of phenol were generally undetectable. After 30-60 s, the reaction was initiated by the addition of phenol (1.25 mM). Where indicated, ferrous ammonium sulfate was added to assays, from a 10 mM stock solution in 50 mM HCl, to a final concentration of 5 μM. The addition was made immediately after the addition of the oxygenase preparation, and assay mixtures were then incubated for 2 min before the addition of phenol to initiate the reaction. Addition of DmpK was made after the addition of oxygenase preparation, and prior to the addition of ferrous ammonium sulfate. Although the phenol hydroxylase polypeptides, DmpLMNO, are expressed at high enough levels in Pseudomonas sp. strain CF600 to be readily distinguished in crude extracts run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (in comparison with extracts from uninduced cells), it was impossible to detect DmpK on SDS-PAGE gels by inspection. However, Western blotting revealed the presence of DmpK in crude extracts from phenol-grown cells but not in extracts from acetate-grown cells (data not shown). The low level of expression of DmpK is consistent with the suboptimal position of its poor ribosome binding site (1Nordlund I. Powlowski J. Shingler V. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6826-6833Google Scholar) and has physiological implications, discussed below. In order to express sufficient DmpK to allow purification, dmpK was cloned and expressed in E. coli from the strong viral T7 promoter in pVI203, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Recombinant DmpK was purified from E. coli harboring pVI203 using Fast-Flow DEAE chromatography, followed by chromatography on gel filtration and Phenyl-Sepharose columns. Samples from each stage of a representative purification are shown in Fig. 1. Approximately 125 mg were obtained from the equivalent of 17 g (wet weight) of cell paste. The protein exhibited some heterogeneity on the gel filtration and Phenyl-Sepharose columns. When the Phenyl-Sepharose step was omitted and the eluate from the DEAE column was applied directly to the gel filtration column, high and low molecular weight forms of DmpK were observed. The high molecular weight form predominated, with more than 90% of the total DmpK eluted from the column existing in this form. Two broad peaks of similar size were observed when the eluate from the DEAE column was instead chromatographed on the Phenyl-Sepharose column; one eluted early in the salt gradient, and the other eluted immediately after. Protein from each peak was further purified by gel filtration chromatography; the two fractions behaved identically on this column, each eluting at the position of the high molecular weight form referred to above (data not shown). All fractions of DmpK were essentially pure, as judged by SDS-PAGE (e.g. Fig. 1) and electrospray mass spectrometry (not shown), and were indistinguishable using either of these techniques or native gel electrophoresis; circular dichroism spectroscopy of the different fractions showed only minor differences. The molecular weight obtained by electrospray ionization-mass spectroscopy was 10,451 ± 1 mass unit, which corresponds well with the molecular weight deduced from the nucleotide sequence (10,586), assuming that the amino-terminal methionine had been removed. This was confirmed by amino-terminal sequencing of the purified protein. The native molecular weight of the protein was estimated to be approximately 37,000 using a calibrated high pressure liquid chromatography gel filtration column: thus, DmpK appears to exist mainly as a trimer or a tetramer. Purified DmpK fractions were colorless, with a peak observed only in the UV region of the spectrum (data not shown). Therefore, the purified protein does not contain redox-active prosthetic groups such as flavin, heme, or iron-sulfur centers. Additionally, preparations of DmpK were found to contain only traces of iron, so the purified protein does not contain a spectroscopically invisible iron center either. The dose-dependent effects of adding a purified preparation of DmpK to phenol hydroxylase assays, in the presence and absence of DmpM, are summarized in (Fig. 2). DmpK-dependent inhibition of the hydroxylase in the presence of DmpM was dramatic, with inhibition occurring at low levels of DmpK. The phenol hydroxylase-catalyzed reaction was much slower in the absence of DmpM, but was still readily detectable, and appeared to be insensitive to the presence of DmpK (Fig. 2). These results suggest that DmpK can interfere with the interaction between the oxygenase component (DmpLNO) and DmpM, the activator protein. However, since the in vivo ratio of DmpK:DmpLNO appears to be very low (see above), inhibition of the hydroxylase is of questionable physiological significance. Since the inhibition experiments suggested that DmpK interacts with one or more of the phenol hydroxylase polypeptides (excluding DmpP), chemical cross-linking was used to probe potential interactions. Direct evidence for the interaction of DmpK with the two larger subunits of the hydroxylase was obtained using the homobifunctional N-hydroxysuccinimide-ester cross-linker, BS3. DmpK (10.5 kDa) appeared to be cross-linked to itself by this reagent, as indicated by three prominent bands of cross-linked products with apparent molecular masses ranging from 19.5 to 24 kDa observed upon Coomassie Blue staining and Western blotting using a DmpK-specific antibody (Fig. 3). These bands are likely to represent DmpK dimers; the range of products observed may be ascribed to additional modifications and/or internal cross-linking of the dimeric protein, either of which could alter the mobility of cross-linked products. An additional band visible on the Western blot (Fig. 3b, lane D) just below the 35.1-kDa marker is consistent with the gel filtration results, which suggested that the protein is tri- or tetrameric. However, the yield of this cross-linked product is low, and it is not visible on the Coomassie-stained gel. Upon exposure to BS3, the oxygenase component of phenol hydroxylase, which is composed of subunits running at 54, 36, and 13.5 kDa on SDS-PAGE (molecular masses predicted from the gene sequences are 60.5 (DmpN), 38.5 (DmpL), and 13.2 kDa (DmpO); see 1Nordlund I. Powlowski J. Shingler V. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6826-6833Google Scholar), gave rise to products running at 92 and 120 kDa (Fig. 3a). The 92-kDa band is likely to be the cross-linked product of DmpL (36 kDa, observed) and Dmp N (54 kDa, observed). It is difficult to identify the 120-kDa product without additional information. In the presence of BS3 a mixture of DmpK and oxygenase component gave rise to new cross-linked products (Fig. 3a), each of which reacted with the DmpK-specific antibody (Fig. 3b). The major products had molecular masses of 46 kDa and 69 kDa, which most likely represent DmpK linked to DmpL (12.5 plus 36 kDa, observed) and DmpK and DmpN (12.5 plus 54 kDa, observed), respectively. Two larger complexes containing DmpK were also observed (Fig. 3b); that running at 96 kDa most likely represents a complex of DmpKLN. It should be noted that although DmpK can clearly bind to polypeptides of the oxygenase complex, it does not co-purify with it (Fig. 3b, lane E). These data provided clear evidence that DmpK binding sites exist on the two largest subunits of the hydroxylase. In light of the cross-linking and inhibition results, the effects of co-expressing it at a low level (i.e. at far less than a molar ratio) with the oxygenase (DmpLNO) were examined in order to provide more information about a potential physiological role.

In fact, pV compounds are the most potent inhibitors of PTPs yet described. Because pV compounds are known oxidants that have been shown to be much more effective than vanadate in oxidizing cysteines (13Shaver A. Ng J.B. Hall D.A. Lum B.S. Posner B.I. Inorg. Chem. 1993; 32: 3109-3113Google Scholar), their mode of action presumably involves oxidation of a cysteine residue present within a well conserved sequence at the active site of all PTPs (14Guan K.L. Dixson J.E. Science. 1990; 249: 553-556Google Scholar). In that respect, pV compounds differ from vanadate, which inhibits PTP activity by acting as a phosphate analog (15Tracey A.S. Gresser M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 609-613Google Scholar). Because pV compounds are easily accessible to the cellular interior (3Heffetz D. Bushkin I. Dror R. Zick Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2896-2902Google Scholar), incubation of cultured cells with pV or its administration into rats increases severalfold the phosphorylation level and state of activation of several PTKs, including the insulin receptor β-subunit (insulin receptor kinase) (7Bevan A.P.

Rat hepatoma cells (Fao) were grown in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum. Confluent monolayers were deprived of serum for 16 h before treatment. Cells were then washed and incubated in serum-free medium. H2O2 and sodium orthovanadate were added either alone or in combination (3Heffetz D. Bushkin I. Dror R. Zick Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2896-2902Google Scholar) to generate pV compounds (7Bevan A.P. Drake P.G. Yale J.F. Shaver A. Posner I.B. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 153: 49-58Google Scholar). Insulin or other ligands were added to the medium as indicated. After incubation, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and frozen in liquid nitrogen or immediately extracted in buffer I (50 mM Hepes, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mM Na3VO4, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM EGTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin, pH 7.6). Extracts were centrifuged 30 min at 4°C at 12,000 × g. The supernatants were mixed with concentrated (5 ×) sample buffer (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar), run on 7.5% SDS-gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose papers for Western blot analysis. Subcellular fractionation was carried out essentially as described by Graham (35Graham J. Rickwood D. Centrifugation: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1984: 168-171Google Scholar). Briefly, rat livers (5 ml/g) or cultured Fao cells homogenates were prepared in buffer II (25 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin, pH 7.5) and centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The pellets were discarded, and the supernatants were further centrifuged at 12,000 × g at 4°C for 30 min. The pellets (P1) were washed twice by resuspension in buffer II and centrifugation at 12,000 × g as above. The supernatants were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. The final high-speed supernatant represents the cytosolic fraction, whereas the 100,000 × g total microsomal pellet (P2) was washed twice in buffer II. Final resuspension of P1 and P2 fractions was done in buffer II in the presence of 1% Triton X-100. Samples from each fraction were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose papers for Western blot analysis. Affinity-purified Tyr(P) antibodies were generated as described previously (16Hadari Y.R. Tzahar E. Nadiv O. Rothenberg P. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. Yarden Y. Zick Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17483-17486Google Scholar). Antisera to insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) (36Sun X.J. Rothenberg P. Kahn C.R. Backer J.M. Araki E. Wilden P.A. Cahill D.A. Goldstein B.J.

Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 44-53Google Scholar), by injection of a peptide CYASINFQKQPEDRQ corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal 14 amino acids of rat liver IRS-1 (and an additional Cys residue at the amino-terminal site). Authenticity of the peptide was confirmed by sequencing. Antibodies against GRP-72 (38Pumford N.R. Marin B.M. Thomassen D. Burris J.A. Kenna J.G. Martin J.L. Pohl L.R. Chem. Res.

Immunogenetics. 1994; 40: 159-162Google Scholar) were a generous gift of Dr. L. Pohl (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Bip (GRP-78) (29Munro S. Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1986; 46: 291-300Google Scholar) antibodies were kindly provided by Dr. M. Oren (Weizmann Institute). Antibodies were added to 60 μl of 50% protein A-Sepharose solution in a buffer composed of 0.1 M Tris, pH 8.5, and were incubated for 1 h at 4°C. The complex was precipitated at 12,000 × g (for 5 min) and washed three times in the incubation buffer. The last wash was in the sample's extraction buffer. Tissue or cell extracts were prepared in extraction buffers as indicated. Five hundred-μl extracts (0.8 mg of protein) were incubated for 2 h with the antibody-Protein A-Sepharose complex. After incubation, the immunocomplexes were precipitated at 12,000 × g (for 5 min) and were washed four times with the extraction buffer. The final pellets were then suspended in Laemmli sample buffer (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar), boiled for 5 min, resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar), and transferred into nitrocellulose papers for Western blotting with the appropriate antibodies. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (16Hadari Y.R. Tzahar E. Nadiv O. Rothenberg P. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. Yarden Y. Zick Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17483-17486Google Scholar), using an ECL kit purchased from Amersham Corp. and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein A, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Separation of proteins by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was performed as described (39O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Google Scholar). pp75 was immunoprecipitated by affinity-purified c-IRS-1 antibodies, and its amino-terminal sequence was determined as described by Ullrich et al. (40Ullrich A. Bell J.R. Chen E.Y. Herrera R. Petruzelli L.M. Dull T.J. Gray A. Coussens L. Liao Y.C. Tsubokawa M. Mason A. Seeburg P.H. Grunfeld C. Rosen O.M. Ramachandran J. Nature. 1985; 313: 756-761Google Scholar). Western immunoblotting of liver extracts with polyclonal antibodies directed against the carboxyl-terminal end of IRS-1 (c-IRS-1) did not reveal the presence of IRS-1 itself. Instead, the antibodies reacted with a protein having a molecular mass of 75 kDa, termed pp75. Binding of c-IRS-1 antibodies to pp75 was specific and could be abolished in the presence of the c-IRS-1 peptide (Fig. 1, lanes 2-3), indicating that pp75 contains an IRS-1-related antigenic epitope. Although c-IRS-1 antibodies failed to react with endogenous IRS-1 in total liver extracts, they did react, by means of Western immunoblotting, with IRS-1 derived from cells that overexpress the protein (41Voliovitch H. Schindler D. Hadari Y.R. Taylor S.I. Accili D. Zick Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18083-18087Google Scholar). Moreover, Tyr-phosphorylated IRS-1 was readily precipitated by c-IRS-1 antibodies (41Voliovitch H. Schindler D. Hadari Y.R. Taylor S.I. Accili D. Zick Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18083-18087Google Scholar)(Fig. 2). These findings suggested that although the content of IRS-1 in liver extracts is below the detection level of the c-IRS-1 antibodies, the antibodies react with pp75, which presumably contains an antigenic epitope corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal end of IRS-1.Fig. 2Tyr phosphorylation of pp75. Fao cells were treated for 1 min with 1 μM insulin or for 30 min with H/V (3 mM H2O2 together with 1 mM vanadate to generate pV compounds) (top). Alternatively, cells were treated with H/V for the indicated time periods (bottom). Cell extracts (0.5 mg), made in buffer I, were immunoprecipitated with c-IRS-1 antibodies, subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose papers, and Western immunoblotted with Tyr(P) antibodies. The bands corresponding to the Tyr-phosphorylated IRS-1 and pp75 were analyzed by densitometry. Results are presented in arbitrary units.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Consistent with our previous studies (2Heffetz D. Zick Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10126-10132Google Scholar, 8Heffetz D. Rutter W.J. Zick Y. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 631-635Google Scholar), incubation of Fao cells with insulin resulted in enhanced Tyr phosphorylation of IRS-1, present in c-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2). Such treatment failed to induce Tyr phosphorylation of pp75 (Fig. 2). However, when Fao cells were incubated with a combination of H2O2 and vanadate (which generates pV compounds (7Bevan A.P. Drake P.G. Yale J.F. Shaver A. Posner I.B. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 153: 49-58Google Scholar)), Tyr phosphorylation of both pp75 and IRS-1, present in IRS-1 immunoprecipitates, was readily detected (Fig. 2, top). The kinetics of pV-induced Tyr phosphorylation of pp75 and of IRS-1 were very similar. Phosphorylation of both proteins was rapid; it was half maximal by 3-5 min and reached its maximal levels following 10 min incubation with the oxidant (Fig. 2, bottom). Experiments were carried out to determine whether pp75 represents a degradation product of IRS-1. When hepatic pp75 was resolved by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, it migrated with a calculated pI of ∼6.5 (Fig. 3). This was in contrast to the calculated pI value of the carboxyl-terminal 735 amino acids of IRS-1, which is 8.0. In contrast to IRS-1, which upon cellular fractionation localizes to the 12,000 × g supernatant (42White M.F. Maron R. Kahn C.R. Nature. 1985; 318: 183-186Google Scholar, 43Rothenberg P.L. Lane W.S. Karasik A. Backer J. White M. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8302-8311Google Scholar), subcellular fractionation of rat liver demonstrated that pp75 was localized mainly to the 12,000 × g particulate fraction (Fig. 4).Fig. 4Subcellular distribution of pp75. Liver extracts were fractionated and directly resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE (four left lanes). Alternatively, extracts were fractionated, immunoprecipitated with c-IRS-1 antibodies, and subjected to SDS-PAGE (four right lanes). Following transfer to nitrocellulose paper, Western immunoblotting was carried out with c-IRS-1 antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The majority of Tyr residues within IRS-1, which are subject to phosphorylation, are located at the carboxyl-terminal 735 amino acids of the protein (17White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Google Scholar). Thus, in response to insulin stimulation, tyrosine phosphorylation of both IRS-1 and its putative degradation product pp75 should take place. We found, however, that only Tyr-phosphorylated IRS-1, but not pp75, was present in c-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates derived from insulin-treated Fao cells. Tyr phosphorylation of pp75 was, however, readily detected once Fao cells were treated with pV (cf. Fig. 2). To determine the tissue distribution of pp75 and compare it with that of IRS-1, extracts from various rat tissues were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose papers, and Western immunoblotted with c-IRS-1 antibodies (Fig. 5). pp75 was found to be expressed to a comparable level in several tissues (i.e. spleen, pancreas, brain, kidney, liver, heart, muscle, fat, and testis) except for lungs. Furthermore, pp75 could not be detected in bacterial and yeast cell extracts (data not shown), indicating its specific expression in multicellular organisms. This pattern of tissue distribution differed from the expression pattern of IRS-1 mRNA (44Sun X.J. Miralpeix M. Myers Jr., M.G. Glasheen E.M. Backer J.M. Kahn C.R. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22662-22672Google Scholar). Collectively, these experiments already indicated that pp75 is presumably not a degradation fragment of IRS-1; however, a better proof was obtained when the amino-terminal part of pp75 was sequenced. Four μg of pp75 were immunoprecipitated with c-IRS-1 antibodies, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and were subjected to amino-terminal sequencing. When compared to the data bank, the sequence of 14 amino acids (Fig. 6A) revealed high homology (80%) to amino acids 47-60 of PBP-74 (31Domanico S.Z. DeNagel D.C. Dahlseid J.N. Green J.M. Pierce S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3598-3610Google Scholar), GRP-75 (32Massa S.M. Longo F.M. Zuo J. Wang S. Chen J. Sharp F.R. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 40: 807-819Google Scholar), and mortalin (33Wadhwa R. Kaul S.C. Ikawa Y. Sugimoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6615-6621Google Scholar), the three homologues of hsp75. Because it has already been demonstrated (31Domanico S.Z. DeNagel D.C. Dahlseid J.N. Green J.M. Pierce S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3598-3610Google Scholar) that the translated product of hsp75 is cleaved at amino acid 46 to generate the mature protein, pp75 could represent a murine hepatic mature form of hsp75. Because pp75 reacted with IRS-1 antibodies that were raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to 14 amino acids located at the carboxyl-terminal end of IRS-1, we looked for the presence of similar antigenic epitopes within the sequences of hsp75. The consensus 10 amino acids at the carboxyl-terminal end of hsp75 is QKEDQKEEKQ. This stretch of charged residues shares 60% identity and overall 70% homology to the corresponding carboxyl-terminal 10 amino acids of IRS-1, which were part of the synthetic peptide used as antigen to generate the IRS-1 antibodies (Fig. 6B). Hence, being a member of the hsp75 family, the carboxyl-terminal end of pp75 could serve as an antigenic epitope to the c-IRS-1 antibodies. Of note is the fact that no such homologies were found when the sequence of IRS-1 was compared with other members of the hsp70 family (e.g. GRP-72 (38Pumford N.R. Marin B.M. Thomassen D. Burris J.A. Kenna J.G. Martin J.L. Pohl L.R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 609-615Google Scholar) or HSC-70 (26Snoek M. Olavesen M.G. van Vugt V.H. Milner C.M. Teuscher C. Campbell R.D. Immunogenetics. 1994; 40: 159-162Google Scholar)), and indeed, c-IRS-1 antibodies failed to react with these proteins (Fig. 7). Once pp75 was identified as a putative heat shock-related protein that undergoes Tyr phosphorylation in response to oxidative insult, attempts were made to determine whether it undergoes Tyr phosphorylation in response to other forms of stress. However, pp75 failed to undergo enhanced Tyr phosphorylation when subjected to heat shock or pH changes (data not shown). To determine whether other members of the hsp70 family are also Tyr phosphorylated in response to oxidative stress, three additional heat shock proteins were precipitated from extracts of pV-treated Fao cells and blotted with Tyr(P) antibodies (Fig. 7). In contrast to pp75, GRP-72, BiP, and HSC-70 failed to undergo Tyr phosphorylation in response to pV treatment. This occurred in spite of the fact that significant amounts of these proteins were precipitated by their corresponding antibodies (Fig. 7). In the present study, we demonstrate that oxidative stress, inflicted upon Fao cells in the form of pV, induces a rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of a 75-kDa protein that belongs to the family of hsp70. Although pp75 was originally identified as a Tyr-phosphorylated protein present in IRS-1 immunoprecipitates, several lines of evidence were presented to suggest that pp75 is not a degradation product of IRS-1, nor is it an IRS-1-associated protein. Instead, pp75 has an IRS-1-related antigenic epitope that corresponds to the carboxyl-terminal 10 amino acids of IRS-1. (i) Analysis of the isoelectric point of pp75 by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis indicated that pp75 migrates with a pI of 6.5, which differs from the calculated pI of 8.0 of the carboxyl-terminal 735 amino acids of IRS-1. (ii) Unlike IRS-1, which localizes to the cytosol and low-density microsomal fractions (43Rothenberg P.L. Lane W.S. Karasik A. Backer J. White M. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8302-8311Google Scholar, 45Heller-Harrison R.A. Morin M. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24442-24450Google Scholar), pp75 mainly associates with the high density (12,000 × g pellet) microsomal fraction. (iii) Unlike IRS-1, pp75 fails to undergo insulin-dependent Tyr phosphorylation, in spite of the fact that the carboxyl-terminal 735 amino acids of IRS-1 contains most of its insulin-stimulated Tyr phosphorylation sites (17White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Google Scholar). (iv) Sun et al. (44Sun X.J. Miralpeix M. Myers Jr., M.G. Glasheen E.M. Backer J.M. Kahn C.R. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22662-22672Google Scholar) have demonstrated that a 9.5-kb mRNA fragment is the major mRNA species encoding IRS-1. Although two smaller mRNA species of 1.4 and 2.2 kilobases were variably detected, these could not be translated into a 75-kDa protein because they do not include the 3′-end portion of the IRS-1 gene (44Sun X.J. Miralpeix M. Myers Jr., M.G. Glasheen E.M. Backer J.M. Kahn C.R. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22662-22672Google Scholar). Thus, pp75, most likely, is not an alternative splice variant of IRS-1, nor is it a degradation product of IRS-1. Similarly, although pp75 is precipitated by c-IRS-1 antibodies, it is not an IRS-1-associated protein for the following reasons: (i) pp75 is not precipitated by other IRS-1 antibodies directed against a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 489-504 of rat IRS-1 (16Hadari Y.R. Tzahar E. Nadiv O. Rothenberg P. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. Yarden Y. Zick Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17483-17486Google Scholar); and (ii) when total cell extracts are resolved by SDS-PAGE, pp75 directly interacts with c-IRS-1 antibodies by means of Western blotting. Collectively, these findings support our notion that pp75 contains an antigenic epitope that is selectively recognized by c-IRS-1 antibodies. Sequencing of pp75, present in c-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates, revealed that its amino-terminal 14 amino acids is high homologous (80%) to amino acids 47-60 of mortalin (33Wadhwa R. Kaul S.C. Ikawa Y. Sugimoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6615-6621Google Scholar), PBP-74 (31Domanico S.Z. DeNagel D.C. Dahlseid J.N. Green J.M. Pierce S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3598-3610Google Scholar), GRP-75 (32Massa S.M. Longo F.M. Zuo J. Wang S. Chen J. Sharp F.R. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 40: 807-819Google Scholar), and mthsp75 (30Bhattacharyya T. Karnezis A.N. Murphy S.P. Hoang T. Freeman B.C. Phillips B. Morimoto R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1705-1710Google Scholar). These four homologous proteins are encoded by the same cDNA and collectively represent the fourth family member of hsp70 proteins, termed hsp75. Because the translated product of hsp75 is cleaved at amino acid 46 to generate the mature protein (31Domanico S.Z. DeNagel D.C. Dahlseid J.N. Green J.M. Pierce S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3598-3610Google Scholar), pp75 most likely represents the mature form of an hepatic member of the hsp75 family. Moreover, the consensus sequence of 10 amino acids at the carboxyl-terminal end of hsp75, QKEDQKEEKQ, shares 60% identity and overall 70% homology to the corresponding carboxyl-terminal 10 amino acids of IRS-1 that were part of the synthetic peptide used as antigen to generate the IRS-1 antibodies. Hence, the carboxyl-terminal end of pp75 presumably serves as an antigenic epitope to the c-IRS-1 antibodies. Because no other stretches of sequence homology between IRS-1 and hsp75 were found, it might explain the selective immunological cross-reactivity of pp75 with antibodies directed against the carboxyl terminus, but not other regions, of the IRS-1 molecule. In general, the hsp70 family members are more conserved at their amino-terminal ATP-binding domain and less conserved at their carboxyl-terminal end (25Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 13: 33-45Google Scholar). This difference might account for the fact that c-IRS-1 antibodies, which react with antigenic epitope located at the carboxyl-terminal end of hsp75, fail to react with other members of the hsp70 protein family. Indeed, no sequence homologies are found between IRS-1 and other members of the hsp70 family (e.g. GRP-72 (38Pumford N.R. Marin B.M. Thomassen D. Burris J.A. Kenna J.G. Martin J.L. Pohl L.R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 609-615Google Scholar) or HSC-70 (26Snoek M. Olavesen M.G. van Vugt V.H. Milner C.M. Teuscher C. Campbell R.D. Immunogenetics. 1994; 40: 159-162Google Scholar)). Collectively, these findings suggest that pp75 is presumably hepatic rat hsp75. Members of the hsp75 family exhibit different cellular localization. Whereas GRP-75 and mthsp75 (30Bhattacharyya T. Karnezis A.N. Murphy S.P. Hoang T. Freeman B.C. Phillips B. Morimoto R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1705-1710Google Scholar) are localized to the mitochondria (32Massa S.M. Longo F.M. Zuo J. Wang S. Chen J. Sharp F.R. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 40: 807-819Google Scholar), PBP-74 is localized to cytoplasmic vesicles (31Domanico S.Z. DeNagel D.C. Dahlseid J.N. Green J.M. Pierce S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3598-3610Google Scholar), and mortalin is found either in the cytosol or perinuclear region (46Wadhwa R. Kaul S.C. Mitsui Y. Cell. Struct. Funct. 1994; 19: 1-10Google Scholar). The reason why different homologues of the same protein exhibit different subcellular localization is presently unknown. However, due to the fact that pp75 is found mainly in the 12,000 × g pellet fraction, which is enriched with mitochondria, it seems reasonable to assume that pp75 resembles GRP-75 and mthsp75, which are mitochondrial proteins. hsps are involved in all aspects of protein folding and oligomerization. In addition, hsps function in the intracellular transport of proteins to appropriate destinations, the disassembly of oligomeric structures, and facilitation of the removal of aggregated or improperly folded polypeptides (20Rutherford S.L. Zuker C.S. Cell. 1994; 79: 1129-1132Google Scholar, 22Hartl F.U. Martin J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 92-102Google Scholar, 23Bohen S.P. Kralli A. Yamamoto K.R.

New Horiz. 1995; 3: 198-207Google Scholar). Although the general features of these activities are well documented, less is understood about the molecular mechanisms that regulate hsp function. Moreover, whereas stress-activated protein kinases or c-Jun amino-terminal kinases are known to be stimulated in response to a variety of stresses including heat shock (48Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S. Morange M. Alonso L.A. Zamanillo D. Hunt T. Nebreda A.R. Cell. 1994; 78: 1027-1037Google Scholar, 49Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Google Scholar), hsps themselves are not considered targets for protein phosphorylation. hsp27 and hsp90 are the only hsps that have been reported to undergo phosphorylation (on Ser/Thr residues) (50Chretien P. Landry J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1988; 137: 157-166Google Scholar, 51Lavoie J.N. Lambert H. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Landry J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 505-516Google Scholar, 52Mimnaugh E.G. Worland P.J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 28654-28659Google Scholar). hsp27 is an oligomeric phosphoprotein, constitutively expressed in most human cells, whose phosphorylation in response to stress modulates actin filament dynamics (51Lavoie J.N. Lambert H. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Landry J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 505-516Google Scholar), whereas hsp90 is subjected to Ser/Thr phosphorylation when cells are treated with the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid (52Mimnaugh E.G. Worland P.J. Whitesell L. Neckers L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28654-28659Google Scholar). Our results suggest that pp75, the hepatic homologue of hsp75, undergoes in vivo tyrosine phosphorylation when cells are subjected to oxidative stress upon incubation with pV compounds. This phenomenon seems to be selective because other proteins belonging to the hsp70 family, which include HSC-70 (26Snoek M. Olavesen M.G. van Vugt V.H. Milner C.M. Teuscher C. Campbell R.D. Immunogenetics. 1994; 40: 159-162Google Scholar), Bip (53Haas I.G. Wabl M. Nature. 1983; 306: 387-389Google Scholar), and GRP-72 (38Pumford N.R. Marin B.M. Thomassen D. Burris J.A. Kenna J.G. Martin J.L. Pohl L.R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 609-615Google Scholar), fail to undergo Tyr phosphorylation under these conditions. Although the molecular consequences of hsp75 phosphorylation are presently unknown, Tyr phosphorylation is a key regulatory element in numerous signal transduction pathways and cellular processes (54Hunter T. Cell. 1987; 50: 823-829Google Scholar). Moreover, a growing number of intracellular signaling molecules, receptors, kinases, and transcription factors are found associated with hsps (20Rutherford S.L. Zuker C.S. Cell. 1994; 79: 1129-1132Google Scholar, 55Smith D.F. Faber L.E. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3996-4003Google Scholar). For example, hsp90 associates transiently with pp60 v-src, directs its cellular trafficking, and negatively regulates its kinase activity (52Mimnaugh E.G. Worland P.J. Whitesell L. Neckers L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28654-28659Google Scholar). Moreover, Ser/Thr phosphorylation of hsp90 and/or pp60 v-src functions as a regulatory molecular trigger to release pp60 v-src from the chaperone complex at the inner surface of cell membranes (52Mimnaugh E.G. Worland P.J. Whitesell L. Neckers L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28654-28659Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings and our present results suggest that phosphorylation of hsps, either on Ser/Thr or on Tyr residues, might modulate their function and their mode of interaction with other cellular constituents. pp75 undergoes Tyr phosphorylation when cells are treated with pV compounds. These agents, which act as intracellular oxidants (13Shaver A. Ng J.B. Hall D.A. Lum B.S. Posner B.I. Inorg. Chem. 1993; 32: 3109-3113Google Scholar), are the most potent inhibitors of PTPs, the activity of which depends upon the presence of reactive cysteine present within their active site (14Guan K.L. Dixson J.E. Science. 1990; 249: 553-556Google Scholar). Inhibition of PTPs activity is, therefore, expected to indirectly enhance the basal activity of PTKs, which is maintained even in the complete absence of a ligand (3Heffetz D. Bushkin I. Dror R. Zick Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2896-2902Google Scholar, 6Posner B.I. Faure R. Burgess J.W. Bevan A.P. Lachance D. Zhang-Sun G. Fantus I.G. Ng J.B. Hall D.A. Lum B.S. Shaver A. J. Biol.

This low level of PTK activity generates a cycle in which Tyr(P) is formed and degraded in the basal state at rates that prevent any significant net autophosphorylation. Upon administration of pV compounds, this equilibrium is disrupted because dephosphorylation is inhibited, allowing the low level of autophosphorylating activity to prevail, and leads to PTK activation. Therefore, PTKs that are stimulated through autophosphorylation like those belonging to the insulin receptor (2Heffetz D. Zick Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10126-10132Google Scholar, 3Heffetz D. Bushkin I. Dror R. Zick Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2896-2902Google Scholar, 8Heffetz D. Rutter W.J. Zick Y. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 631-635Google Scholar) or the Src family (56Volberg T. Geiger B. Dror R. Zick Y. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 105-120Google Scholar, 57Volberg T. Zick Y. Dror R. Sabanay I. Gilon C. Levitzki A. Geiger B. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1733-1742Google Scholar) are expected to maintain a high kinase activity in pV-treated cells, even in the absence of a ligand. The nature of the pV-stimulated PTKs that phosphorylate pp75 is presently unknown; however, the possibility that pp75 is associated with mitochondrial-enriched fractions suggests that mitochondrial PTKs (58Piedimonte G. Chamaret S. Dauguet C. Borghetti A.F. Montagnier L. J. Cell. Biochem. 1988; 36: 91-102Google Scholar) might catalyze this reaction. In conclusion, our results indicate that pp75, a member of the hsp70 protein family, undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation in response to pV treatment. This is the first evidence for tyrosine phosphorylation of a heat shock protein, which suggests that this posttranslational modification might regulate the function of pp75 or related hsps in a manner as yet to be defined.

The major Hex isozymes in humans, Hex A, a heterodimer of α and β subunits (αβ), and Hex B, a homodimer of β subunits (ββ), have different substrate specificities. The β subunit (HEXB gene product), hydrolyzes neutral substrates. The α subunit (HEXA gene product), hydrolyzes both neutral and charged substrates. Only Hex A is able to hydrolyze the most important natural substrate, the acidic glycolipid GM2 ganglioside. Mutations in the HEXA gene cause Tay-Sachs disease (TSD), a GM2 ganglioside storage disorder. We investigated the role of putative active site residues Asp-α258, Glu-α307, Glu-α323, and Glu-α462 in the α subunit of Hex A. A mutation at codon 258 which we described was associated with the TSD B1 phenotype, characterized by the presence of normal amounts of mature but catalytically inactive enzyme. TSD-B1 mutations are believed to involve substitutions of residues at the enzyme active site.

The major Hex isozymes in humans are: Hex A, a heterodimer composed of one α and one β subunit and Hex B, a homodimer of two β subunits. A third isozyme, Hex S, is composed of two α subunits, which are unstable and not normally found in most tissues. The α and β subunits are structurally related, sharing 60% amino acid identity in the mature form (1Korneluk R.G. Mahuran D.J. Neote K. Klavins M.H. O'Dowd B.F. Tropak M. Willard H.F. Anderson M.-J.

The β subunit, in Hex A and Hex B, hydrolyzes neutral substrates, whereas the α subunit, in Hex A and Hex S, hydrolyzes neutral substrates as well as substrates bearing a negative charge either on the terminal sugar (e.g. GlcNac-SO4) or on a distinct residue (e.g. sialic acid) (4Kytzia H.-J.

The latter includes the most important natural substrate, the sialic-acid containing glycosphingiolipid, GM2 ganglioside, found mainly in neuronal tissue. Only Hex A catalyzes cleavage of the terminal β-N-acetylgalactosamine on GM2 ganglioside in the presence of the substrate-specific protein cofactor, the GM2-activator protein (5Burg J. Conzelmann E.

Mutations in the HEXA, HEXB, and GM2A genes, encoding the α and β subunits of Hex A and the GM2 activator, respectively, lead to a group of inherited neurodegenerative diseases, collectively known as the GM2 gangliosidoses, that are characterized by lysosomal accumulation of GM2 ganglioside mainly in neuronal tissue. These disorders range in severity from Tay-Sachs disease (TSD), a progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disorder of infancy, to clinically milder or later onset forms of GM2 gangliosidosis occurring in patients with some residual enzyme activity (reviewed in Gravel et al.

McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 2839-2882Google Scholar), few have revealed information about the location or properties of the α and β subunit active sites. A subset of HEXA mutations, known as the B1 mutations, lead to production of normal amounts of mature Hex A, which is deficient in α subunit catalytic activity without affecting β subunit activity (7Bayleran J. Hechtman P. Kolodny E. Kaback M. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1987; 41: 532-548Google Scholar). The B1 mutations are thus compatible with normal maturation of Hex subunits and delivery of structurally intact Hex A to the lysosome. The presence of a mature Hex A, unable to hydrolyze charged substrates, suggested that the B1 biochemical phenotype might be associated with mutations at or near the α subunit active site (4Kytzia H.-J.

Acta. 1991; 1080: 89-95Google Scholar) proposed that the mechanism of Hex catalysis involves both an acidic and a basic residue and depends on a transition state in which the glycosidic O of the substrate is joined with the acetyl group of the pyranose ring, a mechanism fundamentally different from that of other glycosidases. In this study, we investigated candidate active site residues in the α subunit of Hex A through analysis of mutations that affect catalytic activity without disrupting maturation of the enzyme. We introduced conservative mutations at residue Asp-α258, as well as at three glutamic acid residues (Glu-α307, Glu-α323, and Glu-α462) which are evolutionarily invariant in family 20 of glycosyl hydrolases using the classification system of Henrissat (29Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 309-316Google Scholar). We then studied the impact of these substitutions on enzyme activity and maturation after transfection of mutant cDNAs using an SV40-transformed neuroglial (NG) cell line established from a fetus with Tay-Sachs disease which is devoid of endogenously expressed α subunits but produces functional β subunits. NG141 (NG) and NG125 (TSD-NG), SV40-transformed fetal TSD and normal neuroglial cell lines, respectively, were provided by L. Hoffman and S. Brooks (Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY). Cells were cultured in α-minimum essential medium with 15% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. The Escherichia coli β-galactosidase gene, in pSVLβgal (Clontech), was used as a reporter gene to control for transfection efficiency. The cloned human HEXA cDNA (1Korneluk R.G. Mahuran D.J. Neote K. Klavins M.H. O'Dowd B.F. Tropak M. Willard H.F. Anderson M.-J. Lowden J.A. Gravel R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8407-8413Google Scholar) was inserted into pRCCMV and pREP4 (Invitrogen) to produce pRCCMVα and pREP4α. Preparation of PRCCMVα involved: 1) subcloning the HEXA cDNA from PSVLα into pCRII (Invitrogen) as an XhoI/BamHI fragment, 2) subcloning of an NsiI HEXA cDNA-containing fragment PCRII subclone into the PstI site of pBluescript (Stratagene), 3) subcloning an XhoI/XbaI fragment from pBluescript into a PCRII intermediate, and 4) cloning a NotI/XbaI HEXA cDNA-containing fragment from the PCRII subclone into PRCCMV. Preparation of pREP4α involved cloning the XhoI/BamHI HEXA cDNA-containing fragment from PSVLα into pREP4. Construction of pCMVα required creating a HEXA cDNA flanked by NotI sites. The HEXA cDNA insert in pRCCMVα has a NotI site at the 5‘ end of the gene. This insert was subcloned into the BamHI site of pBluescript (KS–, Stratagene) introducing a second NotI site downstream from the 3‘ end of the gene. This step permitted the cloning of the insert into the unique NotI site of pCMVα. All plasmids were purified on Qiagen columns prior to transfection. Mutations were introduced into the HEXA cDNA using a modified protocol of the Clontech Transformer Mutagenesis Kit. The second screening step for mutant clones was omitted. Mutant clones were identified after the first screen by PCR amplification of samples of isolated disrupted bacterial colonies followed by restriction enzyme digestion or allele-specific hybridization of amplified product to identify mutant genotypes. Mutations were introduced into pSVLα, a cassette containing the altered sequence was subcloned into pBS(KS)HEXA, and the full-length mutant cDNA was subsequently subcloned into pCMV. Mutant pCMVα inserts were sequenced (Pharmacia T7 sequencing kit) and the plasmids purified on Qiagen columns prior to transfection. For transient expression in cell line NG 125, subconfluent T175s (175 cm2, Sarstedt) were harvested by trypsinization and washed twice with 1 × phosphate-buffered saline. The cell pellet was resuspended in Optimem medium (Life Technologies, Inc., containing 5% fetal bovine serum) to obtain a final concentration of 6 × 106 cells/ml. Cell suspension (800 μl), 20 μg of pCMVα, and 2 μg of pSVLβgal were placed in a 0.4-cm cuvette, mixed, placed on ice for 5 min, and pulsed (500 microfarads, 400 V) using a Bio-Rad electroporation apparatus. The time constant was between 16 and 18 ms. After 15 min on ice, 800 μl of α-minimum essential medium (without antibiotics) was added to the suspension. For the β-galactosidase qualitative assay, 250 μl of transfected cell suspension were plated on 12 multiwell plates. The remainder of the transfected cell suspension was grown for 48 h in a T75 (75 cm2). A qualitative β-galactosidase assay was performed to determine the percentage of surviving cells which expressed bacterial enzyme. Multiwell-plated cells were incubated as described by Lake (30Lake B.D. Histochem. J. 1974; 6: 211-218Google Scholar). After 24-h incubations the number of blue cells was estimated microscopically. Harvested cells were lysed by freeze-thawing in 0.25 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and protein determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). A fluorescent assay (31Hearing J. Hunter E. Rodgers L. Gething M. Sambrook J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 339-353Google Scholar) was adapted for quantitation of β-galactosidase activity in transfected cell lysates. The reaction mixture contained 3 μl of 100 × magnesium solution (4.5 M 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 M MgCl2), 100 μl of 0.5 mM 4 methyl-umbelliferyl β-D-galactoside, and approximately 2-5 μg of lysate protein in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) in a volume of 334 ml. After incubation at 37†C for 15 min, fluorescence, due to release of 4MU, was determined using a Perkin-Elmer spectrofluorimeter (excitation wavelength, 360 nm; emission, 447 nm). Hexosaminidase activity was also determined fluorometrically using either 4MUGS (α subunit substrate) (32Bayleran J. Hechtman P. Saray W. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1984; 143: 73-89Google Scholar) or the 4MUG (β subunit) substrate. The enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) Western blotting kit from Amersham Corp. was used to detect the presence of the Hex A α subunit with a polyclonal rabbit anti-human Hex A antibody. Both the primary and secondary (rabbit Ig, horseradish peroxidase-labeled antibody) antibodies were used at a 1:5000 dilution. The hexosaminidase isoenzyme profile in cell lysates was determined by chromatofocusing using the Pharmacia Polybuffer Exchanger (PEB) system according to a modified protocol of O'Dowd et al. (33O'Dowd B.F. Klavins M.H. Willard H.F. Gravel R. Lowden J.A. Mahuran D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12680-12685Google Scholar). Transfected cell extracts were freeze-thawed (three times) in 0.025 M imidazole buffer (pH 7.4), and the protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method. All steps were carried out at 7†C. Approximately 1 ml of PEB74 slurry was used to prepare a column in a 1-ml syringe. The column was washed with the equivalent of 1.5-2 × bed volume with 0.025 M imidazole. The protein extract was added after passing 2 × 100 μl of Polybuffer (pH 4.0) through the column. Four hundred-microliter fractions were collected. Sodium citrate buffer (0.13 M, pH 3.46) was used to elute Hex S after a pH of 4.0 was reached using a pH gradient. The Km and Ki for wild type and mutant Hex A proteins were determined using 4MUGS substrate at concentrations from 1.0 to 7.5 mM. For inhibition studies, the competitive inhibitor N-aetylglucosamine-6-phosphate (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 10 mM. The endogenous activity of NG cells toward the α-specific substrate 4MUGS was 715 ±; 13 nmol/mg/h. In untransfected TSD-NG cells, the rate of 4MUGS hydrolysis is <1% of that in NG cells. This trace activity is probably due to the residual action of Hex B on 4MUGS (32Bayleran J. Hechtman P. Saray W. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1984; 143: 73-89Google Scholar). In order to maximize α subunit expression through transfection, several vectors carrying the HEXA gene cDNA were assessed for their ability to drive expression of enzymatic activity when transfected into TSD-NG cells. Transfection efficiency (percent surviving cells catalyzing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl β-D-galactoside hydrolysis) was determined to be 10-20%. Hexosaminidase activity in cells transfected with 20 μg of plasmids pSVLα, pRCCMVα, pREP4α, or pCMVα was at least 10-fold higher than activity in mock-transfected cells (Table I). The highest level of expression (approximately 1000 × mock-transfected cells) was achieved when cells were transfected with pCMVα. Further analysis of Hex activity in TSD-NG cells at 24, 48, and 72 h post-transfection with pCMVα (Table I) showed that activity continued to increase throughout the 72-h period. The pCMVα plasmid expressed over a 48-h incubation period post-transfection was selected for all subsequent experiments.Table I.HEXA gene expression in TSD-NG cellsVectorTime harvestedaHours post-transfection.Hex activitybNanomoles of 4MUGS hydrolyzed/h/mg of protein.hnmol/h/mgUntransfected NG cells715 (±;13)Untransfected TSD-NG cells3 (±;2)pSVLαcAll transfections into TSD-NG cells.4843 (±;15)pRCCMVα48358 (±;52)pREP4α48611 (±;12)pCMVα241825 (±;246)pCMVα483986 (±;529)pCMVα727145 (±;365)a Hours post-transfection.b Nanomoles of 4MUGS hydrolyzed/h/mg of protein.c All transfections into TSD-NG cells. Open table in a new tab Western blot analysis of transfected (pCMVα and pSVLβgal) and mock-transfected (pSVLβgal) cell extracts confirmed that the increase in 4MUGS activity in TSD-NG cells is associated with α subunit expression (Fig. 1, lane N). Both precursor and mature α subunit are absent in mock-transfected TSD-NG cell extracts (Fig. 1, lane M) and present in cells transfected with pCMVα. In order to determine whether the α subunits encoded by the HEXA cDNA were expressed as the heterodimeric enzyme Hex A (αβ) or the homodimeric species Hex S (αα), the Hex isozyme forms in transfected TSD-NG cell lysates were resolved by chromatofocusing. Fig. 2a illustrates the chromatofocusing profile of TSD-NG cells transfected with pCMVα and assayed with 4MUG (all Hex) and 4MUGS (Hex A and Hex S) to detect all Hex isozyme species. All three hexosaminidase isoenzymes were present, and eluted at their expected pIs. Hex S was the isoenzyme present in greatest abundance followed by Hex A and Hex B respectively. This high expression of the nonphysiological Hex S in TSD-NG cells is the most likely due to the massive overexpression of α subunits in the face of limiting, endogenously produced β subunits. Total Hex activity in pCMVα transfected TSD-NG cells (harvested at 48 h post-transfection) is 5-6-fold greater than endogenous Hex activity in untransfected normal NG cells (Table I). Given an efficiency of transfection of 10-20%, the transfected cells express up to 60-fold greater Hex activity than normal untransfected NG cells. Despite overwhelming α subunit synthesis, a significant proportion (22%) of the transfected gene product is expressed as the Hex A heterodimer as shown by the chromatofocusing profile (Fig. 2). In order to evaluate the expression of mutant α subunits in TSD-NG cells, we initially examined mutations known to cause the infantile acute (αR170W) (11Fernandes M. Kaplan F. Natowicz M. Prence E. Kolodny E. Kaback M. Hechtman P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1992; 1: 759-761Google Scholar) subacute (αG250D) (35Trop I Kaplan F. Brown C. Mahuran D. Hechtman P. Hum. Mutat. 1992; 1: 35-39Google Scholar) and chronic (αG269S) (37Navon R. Kolodny E.H. Mitsumoto H. Tomas G.H. Proia R.L. Science. 1989; 243: 1471-1474Google Scholar) forms of GM2 gangliosidosis. The mutant cDNAs were expressed in TSD-NG cells (Table II) and cell lysates assayed for Hex A specific activity using 4MUGS. Hex A activity in lysates of αG269S- and αG250D-transfected TSD-NG cells was <4% and 1.5%, respectively, of the activity measured after transfection with wild type pCMVα. These Hex A activities were 9- and 4-fold greater than mock-transfected activity measured with the 4MUGS substrate. In contrast, expression of αR170W exhibited no significant 4MUGS activity above that of mock transfected cells. Western blot analysis showed that the α subunit synthesized by all three mutant cDNAs appeared in the precursor form (Fig. 1, lanes A, J, and I). Only the αG269S mutation appeared to be associated with expression of a small amount of mature α subunit (Fig. 1, lane A). These results are compatible with previous findings on αG269S (34Brown C.A. Mahuran D.J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1993; 53: 497-508Google Scholar) and αG250D (35Trop I Kaplan F. Brown C. Mahuran D. Hechtman P. Hum. Mutat. 1992; 1: 35-39Google Scholar) in COS cell expression studies and demonstrate complete inactivation of Hex A by the αR170W mutation consistent with the infantile TSD phenotype. In the latter case, the R170W substitution is associated with expression of an α subunit precursor (Fig. 1, lane I) but not with its maturation and targeting to the lysosome.Table II.Expression of GM2 gangliosidosis mutationsVectorAge of onset of TSDaAge of onset of TSD in patients carrying indicated mutations.Hex/β-galactosidase activitybThe numbers express a ratio.

Open table in a new tab We next examined the expression in TSD-NG cells of mutations at amino acid residues which are candidates for participation in the Hex A α subunit catalytic site. To assess the role of mutation at residue Asp-α258 (αD258H), first described in association with the B1 biochemical phenotype of TSD, HEXA cDNA constructs carrying the conservative or isosteric substitutions αD258H, αD258E, or αD258N were expressed in TSD-NG cells and Hex A activity measured in transfected cell lysates. All three mutations resulted in negligible or trace amounts of Hex A activity, with αD258N exhibiting 2-fold background and the others the same activity as measured in mock-transfected cells (Table III, Experiment 1). Western blot analysis of transfected cell extracts (Fig. 3), revealed that maturation of pro-α chains carrying the αD258H mutation was reduced. In contrast, expression αD258N and αD258E mutant cDNAs resulted in production of mature α subunit. Chromatofocusing of αD258N cell extracts revealed that this mutation significantly reduced 4MUGS hydrolysis by Hex A and Hex S (data not shown). The 4MUG hydrolysis of Hex A was reduced to a lesser extent. This result was expected since 4MUG hydrolysis is catalyzed by both the α and β subunits of Hex A.Table IIIEffect of substitutions at putative active site residues on Hex A activityGenotypeHex/β-galactosidase ratioExperiment 1Wild type88.0 (±;32)αD258H0.15 (±;0.04)αD258E0.15 (±;0.05)αD258N0.37 (±;0.06)Mock0.13 (±;0.07)Experiment 2Wild type36 (±;14)αE307D3.6 (±;0.5)αE323D0.2 (±;0.09)αE462D0.85 (±;0.13)Mock0.06 Open table in a new tab We then studied the effects of mutation at conserved residues Glu-α307, Glu-α323, and Glu-α462, predicted as candidate active site residues by homology studies and hydrophobic cluster analysis of family 20 glycosyl hydrolases. Fig. 4, a and b, illustrate multiple alignment of the two regions of family 20 enzymes which produce significant alignment. Asterisks indicate the three evolutionarily invariant glutamate residues identified as candidate active site residues using the classification system of Henrissat. Other invariant amino acids are also indicated. HEXA cDNA constructs carrying the conservative substitutions αE307D, αE323D, or αE462D were expressed in TSD-NG cells and Hex activity measured in transfected cell lysates. All three substitutions had dramatic effects on catalytic activity (Table III, Experiment 2). αE323D did not exhibit any 4MUGS activity above background whereas αE462D and αE307D exhibited 14- and 60-fold 4MUGS activity above the background activity obtained in mock transfected cells respectively. Western blot analysis of transfected cell extracts showed that only the αE323D and αE462D mutations were compatible with synthesis of significant amounts of precursor and mature α subunit (Fig. 5). Chromatofocusing of αE323D and αE462D cell extracts confirmed that the Hex A isoenzyme is processed normally but has a catalytically defective α subunit that is unable to hydrolyze 4MUG or 4MUGS (Fig. 2, b and c). The αE307D mutation, however, dramatically reduces α subunit maturation. Kinetic experiments were performed to evaluate the impact of the αE323D mutation on the binding affinity of Hex A for the substrates 4MUGS and for the competitive inhibitor N-acetylglucosamine-6-PO4 (Fig. 6). The Lineweaver-Burke plots for the wild type enzyme are monophasic, representing the contribution of a single active site to the hydrolysis of 4MUGS. In contrast, the kinetics of hydrolysis of this substrate by the Hex A αE323D enzyme are biphasic revealing a significant contribution of a second active site (the β subunit) at high substrate concentrations. When the kinetic parameters of the high affinity site are evaluated the Km for 4MUGS is 2.5 mM for Hex A αE323D compared to 1.7 mM for the wild type enzyme. Similiarly Ki values for the competitive inhibitor are 15.6 mM for the αE323D-substituted Hex A and 11.0 mM for wild type Hex A. We showed, previously, that the Km for Hex A in fibroblasts from a patient carrying the D258H allele (and a null allele) was identical to that of wild type enzyme (7Bayleran J. Hechtman P. Kolodny E. Kaback M. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1987; 41: 532-548Google Scholar). β-Hexosaminidase catalyzes the"
https://openalex.org/W2002523041,"UDP-glucose: 1,2-diacylglycerol 3-glucosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.157), catalyzes the transfer of glucose from UDP-glucose to diacylglycerol (DAG) to yield monoglucosyldiacylglycerol (MGlcDAG) and UDP. MGlcDAG is the first glucolipid along the glucolipid pathway, and a major (nonbilayer-prone) lipid in the single membrane of Acholeplasma laidlawii. MGlcDAG is further glucosylated to give the major diglucosyldiacylglycerol (DGlcDAG). The bilayer fractions of these lipids are crucial for the metabolic maintenance of phase equilibria close to a potential bilayer-nonbilayer transition and a nearly constant spontaneous curvature. The glucolipid syntheses are also balanced against the phosphatidylglycerol pathway, competing for the common minor precursor phosphatidic acid, to retain a constant lipid surface charge density. The 1,2-diacylglycerol 3-glucosyltransferase was purified to homogeneity from detergent-solubilized A. laidlawii cells by three column chromatography methods (enrichment ≈9 000 ×), and identified as a minor 40-kDa protein by using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In CHAPS detergent, mixed micelles, a cooperative dependence on anionic lipids for activity was confirmed. Dependence of the enzyme on UDP-glucose followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics while the other hydrophobic substrate dioleoylglycerol stimulated the enzyme by an activating, potentially cooperative mechanism. Physiological concentrations of the activator lipid dioleoyl-phosphatidylglycerol influenced the turnover number of the enzyme but not the interaction with UDP-glucose, as inferred from variable and constant values of the apparent Vmax and Km, respectively. Dipalmitoylglycerol was a better substrate than the oleoyl species, supporting earlier in vivo and crude enzyme data. The responses of the purified 1,2-diacylglycerol 3-glucosyltransferase indicated that (i) the regulatory features of the MGlcDAG synthesis is held by the catalytic enzyme itself, and (ii) this strongly corroborates the “homeostasis” model for lipid bilayer properties in A. laidlawii proposed earlier.

J. Bacteriol. 1969; 99: 480-486Google Scholar, 2Dahlqvist A. Andersson S. Wieslander Å. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1105: 131-140Google Scholar). This is catalyzed by the membrane-bound enzyme purified and basically characterized in this work, 1,2-diacylglycerol 3-glucosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.157) (MGlcDAG synthase).MGlcDAG is the first glucolipid in the glucolipid pathway, and is further glucosylated by another enzyme to give diglucosyldiacylglycerol (DGlcDAG) (1Smith P.F. J. Bacteriol. 1969; 99: 480-486Google Scholar, 2Dahlqvist A. Andersson S. Wieslander Å. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1105: 131-140Google Scholar, 3Dahlqvist A.

Umeå University, Umeå, Sweden1995Google Scholar), the precursor for the syntheses of two (usually minor) phosphoglucolipids. Acylated variants of the two glucolipids are also made under some conditions. The hydrophobic substrate DAG for 1,2-diacylglycerol 3-glucosyltransferase is synthesized from phosphatidic acid (PA) by the enzyme phosphatidic acid phosphatase. 2S. Berg, and Å. Wieslander, manuscript in preparation. PA is also the precursor for the separate and competing pathway leading to the major (anionic) phosphatide phosphatidylglycerol (PG). CDP-DAG → PGP → PG PA DAG → MGlcDAG → DGlcDAG → phosphoglucolipids In A. laidlawii, these lipid syntheses are regulated in response to external or internal factors influencing the physical properties of the lipid bilayer to give a strongly varying but adapted lipid composition (4Rilfors L. Wieslander Å. Lindblom G. Rottem S. Kahane I. Subcellular Biochemistry: Mycoplasma Cell Membranes. Vol. 20. Plenum Press, New York1993: 109-166Google Scholar). The purpose is to maintain (i) phase equilibria close to a potential bilayer/nonbilayer transition (5Lindblom G. Brentel I. Sjölund M. Wikander G. Wieslander Å. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7502-7510Google Scholar), (ii) a nearly constant radius of spontaneous curvature (6Österberg F. Rilfors L. Wieslander Å. Lindblom G. Gruner S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1257: 18-24Google Scholar), and (iii) a constant (anionic) surface charge density (7Christiansson A. Eriksson L.E.G. Westman J. Demel R. Wieslander Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3984-3990Google Scholar) for the membrane lipid bilayer mixture. Similar packing properties are also maintained in other bacteria by regulation especially at the acyl chain level, like Escherichia coli (8Rietveld A.G. Killian J.A. Dowhan W. de Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12427-12433Google Scholar, 9Morein S. Andersson A.-S. Rilfors L. Lindblom G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6801-6809Google Scholar), Clostridium butyricum (10Goldfine H. Sebald M. Genetics and Molecular Biology of Anaerobes. Springer-Verlag New York, Inc., New York1993: 354-362Google Scholar), and Bacillus megaterium (11Rilfors L. Hauksson J. Lindblom G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6110-6120Google Scholar), the latter two also by some extent of polar head group changes.The regulation of the packing properties is mainly accomplished by altering the relative proportions of MGlcDAG and DGlcDAG, forming essentially nonlamellar and lamellar phases (5Lindblom G. Brentel I. Sjölund M. Wikander G. Wieslander Å. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7502-7510Google Scholar, 12Mannock D.A. Lewis R.N.A.H. McElhaney R.N.

Rilfors L. Lindblom G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 734-744Google Scholar). In vivo, parameters giving more nonlamellar properties to the bilayer, like higher growth temperature and more of longer and unsaturated acyl chains, result in an increase of the DGlcDAG fraction and a decrease of the MGlcDAG fraction (14Wieslander Å. Nordström S. Dahlqvist A. Rilfors L. Lindblom G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 734-744Google Scholar), as do the presence of various foreign, nonbilayer-promoting molecules (15Wieslander Å. Rilfors L. Lindblom G. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7511-7517Google Scholar). This follows the rules for the packing and phase equilibria of amphiphiles (16Israelachvili J. Intermolecular and Surface Forces. 2nd.

In vitro, the activity of MGlcDAG synthase is critically dependent upon a lipid environment where a substantial fraction of anionic amphiphiles is present. The best activator seems to be 1,2-dioleoyl-phosphatidylglycerol (DOPG), allowing the enzymatic reaction and stimulating it in a cooperative fashion at increasing mole fractions (18Karlsson O.P.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13381-13389Google Scholar). This dependence of the enzyme is most likely involved in keeping the rate balance between the PG and glucolipid pathways in vivo, maintaining a constant surface charge density of the lipid membrane. The lamellar/nonlamellar balance is more likely regulated by the consecutive synthesis of DGlcDAG since the activity of this step is strongly influenced by the presence of molecules increasing the bilayer chain order or the spontaneous curvature, e.g. like certain sterols, in a manner that correlates with the regulation in vivo (19Dahlqvist A. Nordström S. Karlsson O.P. Mannock D.A. McElhaney R.N. Wieslander Å. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13381-13389Google Scholar, 20Karlsson O.P. Rytömaa M. Dahlqvist A. Kinnunen P.K.J. Wieslander Å.

Are they in agreement with the regulation model observed in vivo and with the details accomplished from coarse experiments in vitro?We report here the purification and identification of the MGlcDAG synthesizing enzyme 1,2-diacylglycerol 3-glucosyltransferase from A. laidlawii membranes. Confirmation of the regulatory properties of the enzyme, indicated from crude proteins in a vesicular system (18Karlsson O.P. Dahlqvist A. Wieslander Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23484-23490Google Scholar, 19Dahlqvist A. Nordström S. Karlsson O.P. Mannock D.A. McElhaney R.N. Wieslander Å. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13381-13389Google Scholar), and a characterization of its dependence on the DAG and UDP-Glc substrates in a pure micellar system, add knowledge to the regulation of lipid bilayer properties.DISCUSSIONIn order to maintain a functional membrane, A. laidlawii adapts the lipid composition to shifting environmental and nutritional conditions. A constant surface charge density, similar phase equilibria, and a constant spontaneous curvature are thereby kept by the concerted actions of the lipid-synthesizing enzymes. However, the properties of the lipid bilayer that are sensed by such enzymes is less well known (e.g. 23Hjelmstad R.H. Bell R.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1731-1740Google Scholar). In A. laidlawii membranes, the major nonlamellar lipid MGlcDAG is synthesized by transfer of a glucose moiety from UDP-glucose to DAG, catalyzed by the enzyme 1,2-diacylglycerol 3-glucosyltransferase. MGlcDAG is also the first glucolipid in the glucolipid pathway. The variations in activity of this enzyme upon different properties of the amphiphilic environment is, therefore, of particular interest and has been studied earlier in crude cell preparations (2Dahlqvist A. Andersson S. Wieslander Å. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1105: 131-140Google Scholar, 18Karlsson O.P. Dahlqvist A. Wieslander Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23484-23490Google Scholar, 19Dahlqvist A. Nordström S. Karlsson O.P. Mannock D.A. McElhaney R.N. Wieslander Å. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13381-13389Google Scholar).Enzyme PurificationThe purification method used here consists of three column chromatography steps in a CHAPS micellar environment. Basically, it relies on the first cationic exchange chromatography, leading to a 190-fold increase (relative to solubilized cells) in the specific activity (Fig. 1A and Table I). The identification of the enzyme in SDS-polyacrylamide gels as a minor 40-kDa protein was possible only after a several thousand-fold enrichment in activity and is mainly based on the correlation between protein gel-band intensity and enzyme activity in different fractions and by a single protein in the final high activity fractions. This is supported by a resistance against digestion by proteinase K for both the enzyme activity and this protein band. Resistance is dependent on the presence of anionic lipids like DOPG and PS, as is the enzyme activity, 3L. Li, O. P. Karlsson, and Å. Wieslander, manuscript in preparation. corroborating the identification.The CHAPS Micellar SystemIt was revealed that the activity of the purified MGlcDAG synthase required a certain fraction of DOPG in the CHAPS micelles (Fig. 4) as it does in the crude preparations (18Karlsson O.P. Dahlqvist A. Wieslander Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23484-23490Google Scholar). There seems to be a correlation between the packing properties of the lipids and their solubility in CHAPS. The hydrophobic, nonbilayer substrate lipid DAG, known to increase packing constraints and acyl chain order in lipid bilayers, had a poor solubility in CHAPS (Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7) (see also Maréchal et al. (28Maréchal E. Block M.A. Joyard J. Douce R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5788-5798Google Scholar)). However, if DAG were mixed with large mole fractions of lipids with larger polar headgroups, it could more easily be solubilized by CHAPS (Fig. 3). This was evident for all of the lipids used as activator or matrix lipids in this study. The slight differences between them in solubilization of DAG at low CHAPS concentrations (Fig. 3) did not affect the DAG solubility at assay conditions, as revealed by the similarity between the different curves in Fig. 5.Lipid Dependence of the EnzymeMany membrane-associated enzymes are dependent upon activator lipids, often anionic ones, for example the protein kinase C (29Epand R.M. Epand R.F. Leon B.T.-C. Menger F.M. Kuo J.F. Biosci. Rep. 1991; 11: 59-64Google Scholar, 30Goldberg E.M. Lester D.S. Borchardt D.B. Zidovetzki R. Biophys.

Chem. 1994; 269: 4866-4871Google Scholar) and the phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (33Cornell R.B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5873-5880Google Scholar, 34Cornell R.B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5881-5888Google Scholar). The MGlcDAG synthase seems to have a dependence on a critical fraction of anionic lipids (18Karlsson O.P. Dahlqvist A. Wieslander Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23484-23490Google Scholar, 19Dahlqvist A. Nordström S. Karlsson O.P. Mannock D.A. McElhaney R.N. Wieslander Å. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13381-13389Google Scholar). The lipid best suited to fulfill this requirement was DOPG, the major endogenous anionic phospholipid in membranes of A. laidlawii (18Karlsson O.P. Dahlqvist A. Wieslander Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23484-23490Google Scholar).None of the uncharged (DGlcDAG), neutral-charged (DOPC), or positive-charged (sphingosine) lipids could replace DOPG as activator for the purified MGlcDAG synthase (Fig. 5). On the other hand, the anionic phospholipid PS could fully substitute for DOPG; DOPG mixtures with small fractions of PS were even better. The surface (or ζ) potential of the lipid aggregates must be efficiently quenched by the Mg2+ present, cf. McLaughlin (35McLaughlin S. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1989; 18: 113-136Google Scholar). Together this indicates that it is the anionic-charged groups of the activator lipids that hold the activating property, as proposed earlier (18Karlsson O.P. Dahlqvist A. Wieslander Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23484-23490Google Scholar, 19Dahlqvist A. Nordström S. Karlsson O.P. Mannock D.A. McElhaney R.N. Wieslander Å. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13381-13389Google Scholar).These results essentially confirm the earlier findings from both crude vesicular and mixed micellar preparations and strengthens the hypothesis that the MGlcDAG synthase demands a critical fraction of anionic lipid charges in its amphiphilic environment in order to be active. The sigmoidal appearance of the activation curves was also evident, indicating that the enzyme is activated by the same mechanism in both crude and pure systems.Interpretation of the Kinetics and Comparison with Similar SystemsThe variation in activity of the MGlcDAG synthase with altering bulk DAG concentration at fixed CHAPS and DOPG concentrations followed a sigmoidal path (Fig. 6B), indicating an activating ability of DAG. This is according to “the dual phospholipid model” of Hendrickson and Dennis (36Hendrickson H.S. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5734-5739Google Scholar), a strong indication that the reaction involves more than one type of interaction with DAG where one is a binding step to the micellar surface. However, the MGlcDAG synthase is behaving as a protein anchored to the amphiphilic matrix by hydrophobic interactions (3Dahlqvist A. Regulation of the Membrane Glucolipid Synthesis in Acholeplasma laidlawii. Ph. D. Thesis. Umeå University, Umeå, Sweden1995Google Scholar), 4O. P. Karlsson, unpublished observation. but DAG may, as well, promote interactions (i) between (an external) catalytic domain and the lipid surface, or (ii) between enzyme monomer subunits. Both alternatives are also compatible with a cooperative mechanism. The Hill equation could be more accurately fitted to the data than could the equation suggested by Hendrickson and Dennis (36Hendrickson H.S. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5734-5739Google Scholar), but since the data only represented a very small range of the calculated curves, none of the equations can be ruled out and no parameters could be calculated with certainty. DAG might also function as a noncooperative activator, as it does for the E. coli diacylglycerol kinase in the absence of activating phospholipids (37Walsh J.P. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15062-15069Google Scholar). Although the enzyme product MGlcDAG is a potent nonbilayer-prone lipid, the activity data from the various lipid supplements and the DPG and DOG substrates argues against any (major) influence of the spontaneous curvature on activity (or activation) of the MGlcDAG synthase at physiological DOPG concentrations. This is in accordance with crude-enzyme results (18Karlsson O.P. Dahlqvist A. Wieslander Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23484-23490Google Scholar, 19Dahlqvist A. Nordström S. Karlsson O.P. Mannock D.A. McElhaney R.N. Wieslander Å. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13381-13389Google Scholar, 20Karlsson O.P. Rytömaa M. Dahlqvist A. Kinnunen P.K.J. Wieslander Å. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10094-10102Google Scholar).The dependence of the MGlcDAG synthase on its soluble substrate UDP-glucose was more easily interpreted since the data could be fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation, and the concentration of UDP-Glc could be varied to give data points in all essential parts of the curve (Fig. 6A). A comparison of the apparent values of Vmax and Km at different concentrations of the activator DOPG (Table II) revealed that the Km was not altered. Vmax, on the other hand, was changed in accordance with the activation by DOPG, as shown in Fig. 5. The enzyme is thus following Michaelis-Menten kinetics with UDP-Glc, and the concentration of DOPG does not affect the interaction between the enzyme and UDP-Glc, but the turnover of the enzyme is substantially affected. The apparent Vmax was increased almost 6-fold by altering the DOPG fraction from 20 to 31 mol %, i.e. at physiological concentrations. An 11-mol % variation in DOPG at these conditions will only have minor effects on the charge density and the resulting surface (ζ) potential, as deduced from several other studies (7Christiansson A. Eriksson L.E.G. Westman J. Demel R. Wieslander Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3984-3990Google Scholar, 35McLaughlin S. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1989; 18: 113-136Google Scholar, 38Eisenberg M. Gresalfi T. Riccio T. McLaughlin S. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5213-5223Google Scholar, 39McLaughlin S. Mulrine N. Gresalfi T. Vaio G. McLaughlin A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1981; 77: 445-473Google Scholar). This strongly indicates that the activation is not linearly dependent on the lipid surface charge concentration.Importance for the Regulation Model of A. laidlawiiThis study supports the regulation model for A. laidlawii lipid synthesis (3Dahlqvist A. Regulation of the Membrane Glucolipid Synthesis in Acholeplasma laidlawii. Ph. D. Thesis. Umeå University, Umeå, Sweden1995Google Scholar, 19Dahlqvist A. Nordström S. Karlsson O.P. Mannock D.A. McElhaney R.N. Wieslander Å. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13381-13389Google Scholar) where the MGlcDAG synthesis is enhanced by the negative surface charge brought by DOPG and two (usually minor) phosphoglucolipids. Since MGlcDAG is the first glucolipid along the glucolipid metabolic pathway, the regulation will act to maintain a balance to the phospholipid (i.e. PG) pathway, competing for the same PA precursor. The model is in accordance with the ability of the purified MGlcDAG synthase to be activated by a critical fraction of anionic lipids in the micellar system (Fig. 5). Interestingly, a dependence on anionic lipids for the in vivo synthesis of the major nonlamellar-prone lipid in E. coli has recently been suggested (40Saha S.K. Nishijima S. Matsuzaki H. Shibuya I. Matsumoto K. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1996; 60: 111-116Google Scholar).The higher efficiency of DPG than of DOG as a substrate is also in accordance with both the regulation model and the crude vesicular system (19Dahlqvist A. Nordström S. Karlsson O.P. Mannock D.A. McElhaney R.N. Wieslander Å. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13381-13389Google Scholar). The amounts of MGlcDAG increases strongly with short acyl chains in vivo (14Wieslander Å. Nordström S. Dahlqvist A. Rilfors L. Lindblom G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 734-744Google Scholar, 41Thurmond R.L. Niemi A.R. Lindblom G. Wieslander Å. Rilfors L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13178-13188Google Scholar), and this must be governed by a substrate preference of the enzyme for such chains since the MGlcDAG synthase is only weakly regulated by properties affecting chain order and curvature (see above and 19Dahlqvist A. Nordström S. Karlsson O.P. Mannock D.A. McElhaney R.N. Wieslander Å. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13381-13389Google Scholar).From these observations on the purified MGlcDAG synthase, it can be concluded that the regulatory properties of the enzyme step are held by one single protein and are probably not part of a complex multiprotein regulatory mechanism. The interaction of this enzyme with its amphiphilic environment can now be investigated.

J. Bacteriol. 1969; 99: 480-486Google Scholar, 2Dahlqvist A. Andersson S. Wieslander Å. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1105: 131-140Google Scholar). This is catalyzed by the membrane-bound enzyme purified and basically characterized in this work, 1,2-diacylglycerol 3-glucosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.157) (MGlcDAG synthase).MGlcDAG is the first glucolipid in the glucolipid pathway, and is further glucosylated by another enzyme to give diglucosyldiacylglycerol (DGlcDAG) (1Smith P.F. J. Bacteriol. 1969; 99: 480-486Google Scholar, 2Dahlqvist A. Andersson S. Wieslander Å. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1105: 131-140Google Scholar, 3Dahlqvist A. Regulation of the Membrane Glucolipid Synthesis in Acholeplasma laidlawii. Ph. D. Thesis. Umeå University, Umeå, Sweden1995Google Scholar), the precursor for the syntheses of two (usually minor) phosphoglucolipids. Acylated variants of the two glucolipids are also made under some conditions. The hydrophobic substrate DAG for 1,2-diacylglycerol 3-glucosyltransferase is synthesized from phosphatidic acid (PA) by the enzyme phosphatidic acid phosphatase. 2S. Berg, and Å. Wieslander, manuscript in preparation. PA is also the precursor for the separate and competing pathway leading to the major (anionic) phosphatide phosphatidylglycerol (PG). CDP-DAG → PGP → PG PA DAG → MGlcDAG → DGlcDAG → phosphoglucolipids In A. laidlawii, these lipid syntheses are regulated in response to external or internal factors influencing the physical properties of the lipid bilayer to give a strongly varying but adapted lipid composition (4Rilfors L. Wieslander Å. Lindblom G. Rottem S. Kahane I. Subcellular Biochemistry: Mycoplasma Cell Membranes. Vol. 20. Plenum Press, New York1993: 109-166Google Scholar). The purpose is to maintain (i) phase equilibria close to a potential bilayer/nonbilayer transition (5Lindblom G. Brentel I. Sjölund M. Wikander G. Wieslander Å. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7502-7510Google Scholar), (ii) a nearly constant radius of spontaneous curvature (6Österberg F. Rilfors L. Wieslander Å. Lindblom G. Gruner S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1257: 18-24Google Scholar), and (iii) a constant (anionic) surface charge density (7Christiansson A. Eriksson L.E.G. Westman J. Demel R. Wieslander Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3984-3990Google Scholar) for the membrane lipid bilayer mixture. Similar packing properties are also maintained in other bacteria by regulation especially at the acyl chain level, like Escherichia coli (8Rietveld A.G. Killian J.A. Dowhan W. de Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12427-12433Google Scholar, 9Morein S. Andersson A.-S. Rilfors L. Lindblom G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6801-6809Google Scholar), Clostridium butyricum (10Goldfine H. Sebald M. Genetics and Molecular Biology of Anaerobes. Springer-Verlag New York, Inc., New York1993: 354-362Google Scholar), and Bacillus megaterium (11Rilfors L. Hauksson J. Lindblom G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6110-6120Google Scholar), the latter two also by some extent of polar head group changes.The regulation of the packing properties is mainly accomplished by altering the relative proportions of MGlcDAG and DGlcDAG, forming essentially nonlamellar and lamellar phases (5Lindblom G. Brentel I. Sjölund M. Wikander G. Wieslander Å. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7502-7510Google Scholar, 12Mannock D.A. Lewis R.N.A.H. McElhaney R.N.

Rilfors L. Lindblom G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 734-744Google Scholar). In vivo, parameters giving more nonlamellar properties to the bilayer, like higher growth temperature and more of longer and unsaturated acyl chains, result in an increase of the DGlcDAG fraction and a decrease of the MGlcDAG fraction (14Wieslander Å. Nordström S. Dahlqvist A. Rilfors L. Lindblom G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 734-744Google Scholar), as do the presence of various foreign, nonbilayer-promoting molecules (15Wieslander Å. Rilfors L. Lindblom G. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7511-7517Google Scholar). This follows the rules for the packing and phase equilibria of amphiphiles (16Israelachvili J. Intermolecular and Surface Forces. 2nd. Ed. Academic Press, London1991: 366-394Google Scholar, 17Gruner S.M. Yeagle P. The Structure of Biological Membranes. CRC Press, Inc., Ann Arbor, MI1992: 211-250Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2029782864,"Cellular transformation driven by the E1A oncogene is associated with the development of cellular resistance to the growth inhibitory effects of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). We demonstrate that development of resistance occurs simultaneously with decreased expression of TGF-β type II receptor (TGF-β RII) mRNA and protein. To determine whether changes in transcriptional regulation are responsible for the decreased receptor expression in E1A-transformed cells, a series of mobility shift assays was performed utilizing nuclear extracts from E1A-transformed and untransformed murine keratinocytes using radiolabeled positive regulatory elements (PRE1 and PRE2) of the TGF-β RII promoter. The results from these assays suggest that E1A-transformed cells express markedly lower levels of nuclear proteins that bind specifically to PRE1 and PRE2. Transfection of both E1A-transformed and untransformed cell lines with a series of mutant promoter constructs confirmed that both PREs contribute significantly to basal expression of TGF-β RII and that inactivation of either element leads to markedly reduced promoter activity. We conclude that development of TGF-β resistance in E1A-transformed cells is achieved in part through transcriptional down-regulation of the TGF-β RII gene and that this down-regulation is the result of decreased expression of unidentified transcription factor complexes that interact with PRE1 and PRE2. Cellular transformation driven by the E1A oncogene is associated with the development of cellular resistance to the growth inhibitory effects of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). We demonstrate that development of resistance occurs simultaneously with decreased expression of TGF-β type II receptor (TGF-β RII) mRNA and protein. To determine whether changes in transcriptional regulation are responsible for the decreased receptor expression in E1A-transformed cells, a series of mobility shift assays was performed utilizing nuclear extracts from E1A-transformed and untransformed murine keratinocytes using radiolabeled positive regulatory elements (PRE1 and PRE2) of the TGF-β RII promoter. The results from these assays suggest that E1A-transformed cells express markedly lower levels of nuclear proteins that bind specifically to PRE1 and PRE2. Transfection of both E1A-transformed and untransformed cell lines with a series of mutant promoter constructs confirmed that both PREs contribute significantly to basal expression of TGF-β RII and that inactivation of either element leads to markedly reduced promoter activity. We conclude that development of TGF-β resistance in E1A-transformed cells is achieved in part through transcriptional down-regulation of the TGF-β RII gene and that this down-regulation is the result of decreased expression of unidentified transcription factor complexes that interact with PRE1 and PRE2.

Appropriate cellular responses to extracellular TGF-β depend on a system of multiple TGF-β-specific cell surface receptor proteins and are initiated with binding of TGF-β ligand directly to the TGF-β type II receptor, which is a constitutively active serine-threonine kinase (5Laiho M.

When bound to ligand, the type II receptor forms a heteromeric complex with the TGF-β type I receptor, which then leads to phosphorylation and activation of the type I receptor serine-threonine kinase and allows intracellular signaling to proceed. transforming growth factor-β type II receptor positive regulatory element negative regulatory element chloramphenicol acetyltransferase electrophoretic mobility shift assay glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase One of the most prominent effects of TGF-β in vitro is pronounced inhibition of growth of epithelial cells (9Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Peptide Growth Factors and Their Receptors. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg1990: 419-472Google Scholar). However, it is well known that epithelial-derived cancers typically demonstrate resistance to the growth inhibitory effect of TGF-β (10Kimchi A. Wang X.-F. Weinberg R. Cheifetz S. Massagué J. Science. 1988; 240: 196-199Google Scholar). Acquisition of such TGF-β resistance by clonal populations of tumor cells may represent an essential step in the process of carcinogenesis. Preliminary evidence indicates that TGF-β resistance develops relatively late in the evolution of cancer, coinciding with a period when tumor phenotype first becomes recognizably malignant (11Manning A. Williams A. Game S. Paraskeva C. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1471-1476Google Scholar). Sporn and Roberts (12Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Nature. 1985; 313: 747-749Google Scholar) first predicted that receptor defects would be identified as the basis of TGF-β resistance, a prediction soon confirmed by the finding of a strong correlation between structural abnormalities of the TGF-β RII gene and development of TGF-β resistance in human gastric cancer cell lines (13Park K. Kim S.-J. Bang Y.-J. Park J.-G. Kim N.K. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8772-8776Google Scholar). Subsequently, a specific TGF-β RII mutation has been identified and associated with defective DNA mismatch repair in colon cancer cells from patients with the HNPCC (hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer) syndrome (14Markowitz S. Wang J. Myeroff L. Parsons R. Sun L.Z. Lutterbaugh J. Fan R.S. Zborowska E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Brattain M.G. Willson J.K.V. Science. 1995; 268: 1336-1338Google Scholar). A similar association has been found in gastric cancer as well (15Myeroff L.L. Parsons R. Kim S.-J. Hedrick L. Cho K.R. Orth K. Mathis M. Kinzler K.W. Lutterbaugh J. Park K. Bang Y.-J. Lee H.Y. Park J.-G. Lynch H.T. Roberts A.B. Vogelstein B. Markowitz S.D. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5545-5547Google Scholar). It is becoming clear that the TGF-β signaling pathway subserves a vital tumor suppressor function in various cell lines (16Markowitz S. Roberts A.B. Cytokine & Growth Factor Reviews. 7. Elsevier Science, Cambridge1996: 93-102Google Scholar, 17Kim D.H. Kim S.-J. J. Biomed. Sci. 1996; 3: 143-158Google Scholar). However, we have identified several TGF-β-resistant cancer cell lines, which express decreased levels of cell surface receptors and yet contain no recognizable mutations in the TGF-β receptor genes. 2H. Y. Lee and S.-J. Kim, unpublished results. This observation has suggested to us the possibility that transcriptional regulation or posttranslational mechanisms may lead to development of TGF-β resistance in some cases. A high level of structural complexity for the promoter region of TGF-β RII enhances the potential for significant transcriptional regulation of this gene. Preliminary characterization of the promoter region of TGF-β RII has revealed the presence of two positive regulatory elements (PRE1 and PRE2) and at least one negative regulatory element (NRE) in addition to the core promoter element (18Bae H.W. Geiser A.G. Kim D.H. Chung M.T. Burmester J.K. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Kim S.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29460-29468Google Scholar). Discrete target sequences have been identified within each of these transcriptional regulatory elements, and each appears to interact with multiple nuclear proteins, including six putative novel transcription factor complexes. Cellular transformation driven by the E1A oncogene is a popular system for modeling the genetic events of carcinogenesis. This model was first introduced in 1962 when it was discovered that adenovirus infection leads to sarcoma formation in newborn hamsters (19Trentin J.J. Yabe Y. Taylor G. Science. 1962; 137: 835-841Google Scholar). Since then, considerable effort has been directed toward dissecting the genetic events associated with the development of malignancy in this system (20Mayol X. Graña X. Baldi A. Sang N. Hu Q. Giordano A. Oncogene. 1993; 6: 481-485Google Scholar, 21Giordano A Whyte P. Harlow E. Franza Jr., R. Beach D. Draetta G. Cell. 1989; 58: 981-990Google Scholar, 22Giordano A. McCall C. Whyte P.

Virol. 1988; 62: 257-265Google Scholar, 25Park K. Bae H. Heydemann A. Roberts A.B. Dotto G.P. Sporn M.B. Kim S.-J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 6087-6089Google Scholar). The adenovirus genome has been completely sequenced, and numerous separable genetic functions have been identified and categorized as either ‘early’ or ‘late’ according to their time of expression relative to the onset of DNA replication (26Akusjärvi G. Petterson U. Roberts R.J. Dev. Mol. Virol. 1986; 8: 53-95Google Scholar). Expression of one of the adenovirus early region genes known as E1A is required for cellular transformation in vitro and has also been associated with several other cellular effects including induction of resistance to growth inhibition by TGF-β. To investigate the mechanism underlying development of E1A-mediated TGF-β resistance, a series of experiments was performed utilizing a dl799N mouse keratinocyte cell line stably transfected with an E1A expression vector (27Missero C. Filvaroff E. Dotto G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3489-3493Google Scholar). A second mouse keratinocyte cell line transfected with an enhancerless SV2 promoter was used as a control. Northern blot analysis demonstrated a marked decrease in TGF-β RII mRNA expression from E1A-transfected dl799N cells compared with control. Receptor cross-linking assay further revealed that decreased mRNA levels were associated with diminished expression of TGF-β RII protein. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase transfection assays demonstrated that the regulatory activity of PRE1, PRE2, and NRE was intact in dl799N cells although levels of transcription were consistently lower than in SV2neo cells transfected with the same constructs. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed a significant reduction in DNA binding by the transcription factor complexes interacting with both PRE1 and PRE2. This study suggests that TGF-β resistance in E1A-transformed mouse keratinocytes is mediated in part by transcriptional down-regulation of the TGF-β RII gene and that this negative regulation occurs at both the PRE1 and PRE2 loci. Pam212(SV2neo) and Pam212(dl799N) mouse keratinocyte cell lines were obtained from Paolo Dotto (27Missero C. Filvaroff E. Dotto G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3489-3493Google Scholar). Pam212(SV2neo) cells have been stably transfected with an SV2 promoter and neomycin resistance gene construct. Pam212(dl799N) cells have been stably transfected with an E1A expression vector. Both cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing low glucose, L-glutamine, 110 mg/liter sodium pyruvate, and supplemented with 10% (v/v) calf serum. dl799N cells additionally contained 100 μg/ml neomycin. Total RNA was isolated from cells with guanidium isothiocyanate/phenol/chloroform. 10 μg of RNA was electrophoresed on a 1.0% agarose gel containing 0.66 M formaldehyde, transferred to a Duralon-UV membrane, and cross-linked with a UV Stratalinker (Stratagene). Blots were prehybridized and hybridized in 1% bovine serum albumin, 7% (w/v) SDS, 0.5 M sodium phosphate, 1 mM EDTA at 65°C. Hybridized blots were washed in 0.1% SDS, 1 × SSC for 20 min periods at 50°C before film exposure. RNA blots were hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNA probes for human TGF-β1 and TGF-β RII. A probe for GAPDH was used to control for sample loading. Cells were plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells/well in 6-well dishes. Cells were washed twice with cold binding buffer containing 1 × minimal essential medium, 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin fraction V. Binding was carried out with 100 pM125I-labeled TGF-β in the presence and absence of 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled TGF-β, and cells were incubated on a rotating platform at 4°C for 2.5 h. Cells were washed twice with cold wash buffer 1 containing 1 × minimal essential medium and 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4. 1.0 ml of 300 μM disuccinimidyl suberate was added to cross-link associated proteins, and cells were incubated for 15 min at 4°C. Cells were washed twice with cold wash buffer 2 containing 250 mM sucrose, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, and 1 mM EDTA. Cellular protein was solubilized with buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each of pepstatin and leupeptin while incubating on a rotating platform at 4°C. Lysate was centrifuged, and the supernatant was electrophoresed on a 4-10% linear SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Novex). DNA constructs were generated by polymerase chain amplification using genomic DNA containing the 5′-untranslated region of TGF-β RII as a template. Amplified DNA fragments were cloned into a promoterless CAT expression plasmid (pGEM4-SV0CAT) (28Kim S.-J. Glick A. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 402-408Google Scholar) using HindIII and KpnI or XbaI restriction sites built into the oligonucleotides used for amplification. The sequences of the polymerase chain reaction-generated portions of all constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The plasmid containing the CAT gene alone was used as the control. All CAT construct plasmids were purified by two sequential CsCl banding steps. For transient expression assays, cells were plated at 1.2 × 106/100 cm2 dish and cultured for 24 h before transfection by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method with 5-10 μg of the appropriate plasmids purified by banding in CsCl. Cells were harvested 48 h after the addition of DNA. The extracts were then assayed for CAT activity. All transfections were repeated a minimum of three times. For normalization of transfection efficiencies in SV2neo and dl799N cells, a growth hormone expression plasmid (pSVGH) was included in cotransfections. Growth hormone expression was quantified using a growth hormone detection kit (Nichols Institute). Nuclear extracts of SV2neo and dl799N cells were prepared as described (29Kim S.-J. Park K. Rudkin B.B. Dey B.R. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3739-3744Google Scholar) with minor variation. Monolayers of cells (3 × 106 to 5 × 106) were harvested by scraping, washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated in 2 packed-cell volumes of buffer A (10 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 200 mM sucrose, 0.5 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg of both leupeptin and aprotinin/ml, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) for 5 min at 4°C. The crude nuclei released by lysis were collected by microcentrifugation, rinsed once in buffer A, and resuspended in a two-thirds packed-cell volume of buffer C (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 420 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.0 mM dithiothreitol, and 1.0 μg of both leupeptin and aprotinin/ml). Nuclei were incubated on a rocking platform at 4°C for 30 min and clarified by microcentrifugation for 5 min. The resulting supernatants were diluted 1:1 with buffer D (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mM KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg of both leupeptin and aprotinin/ml). Double-stranded oligonucleotides representing the first and second enhancer regions as well as a series of mutant oligonucleotides for each region were generated using an oligonucleotide synthesizer. Two oligonucleotides, TβRII-(−219/−172) and TβRII-(+1/+50), were labeled using a fill-in reaction with [α-32P]dCTP (50 μCi at 3,000 Ci/mmol) and the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I. The fragments were then gel purified using a 6% polyacrylamide gel and autoradiography to locate the specific fragment. Binding reactions contained 10 μg of nuclear extract protein, buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA, and 5% glycerol), 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 30,000 cpm of 32P-labeled DNA in a volume of 10 μl. Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 20 min. Competition reactions were performed by adding an unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide to the reaction mixture. Reactions were electrophoresed on a 6% NOVEX precasted nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel at 100 V for 1 h in a 100 mM Tris borate-EDTA buffer. Gels were vacuum dried and analyzed by autoradiography. Northern blot analysis was utilized to analyze mRNA expression levels for the TGF-β RII and TGF-β1 genes. Fig. 1 shows that expression of TGF-β RII mRNA is significantly lower in E1A-transformed dl799N cells compared with the control SV2neo cells. In contrast, expression of TGF-β1 mRNA is equivalent between the two cell lines. GAPDH mRNA was used to control for sample loading and indicates that the sample quantity was slightly greater for dl799N indicating that the reduction in TGF-β RII mRNA expression was even greater than that visualized. RNA was isolated from cell samples treated with 1 nM retinoic acid, 1 nM 1,25-(OH)2D3, or a combination of both retinoic acid and 1,25-(OH)2D3. A previous study involving human myeloid leukemia cell lines reported an increase in expression of the TGF-β type II receptor following treatment with retinoic acid (30Taipale J. Matikainen S. Hurme M. Keski-Oja J. Cell Growth & Differ. 1994; 5: 1309-1319Google Scholar). Retinoic acid and/or 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment of the murine keratinocyte cell lines used in our study, however, had no apparent effect on the level of TGF-β1 or TGF-β RII mRNA expression. A receptor cross-linking assay using 125I-labeled TGF-β was performed to determine whether decreased mRNA levels for TGF-β RII translated into decreased protein expression. Receptor cross-linking was performed three times, and Fig. 2 shows representative results. Levels of TGF-β type III and type I receptor cross-linked protein were minimally decreased in the E1A-transformed dl799N cells compared with control. The level of TGF-β type II receptor protein, however, was markedly decreased. In order to determine the functional activity of the two reported positive regulatory elements in the TGF-β RII promoter region, progressively shorter fragments of the 5′-flanking region fused with the coding region of the bacterial CAT gene in the plasmid pGEM-SV0CAT were transfected into both SV2neo and dl799N cells. As seen in Fig. 3, transcriptional activity was less in dl799N cells than in SV2neo cells for each construct tested. In both cell lines, deletion of the sequence between −1000 and −274 led to a marked increase in transcriptional activity, suggesting the presence of an as yet uncharacterized negative regulatory element upstream of PRE1. Deletion of the sequence between −274 and −137 removed PRE1 and led to a predictable decrease in CAT activity. Deletion of nucleotides −137 to −47 eliminated the sequence for a putative NRE (18Bae H.W. Geiser A.G. Kim D.H. Chung M.T. Burmester J.K. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Kim S.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29460-29468Google Scholar) and led to a marked increase in transcription levels. Deletion of the core promoter element between −47 and +2, as expected, significantly decreased transcriptional activity. A relatively high level of CAT activity remained with transfection of the smallest construct, +2 to +50, indicating that the second positive regulatory element, PRE2, was active in both cell lines. Transcriptional activity was consistently higher in SV2neo cells compared with the E1A-transformed dl799N cells, varying from three to more than six times greater. Regulatory activity of PRE1, PRE2, and NRE appears to be intact in both E1A-transformed and control cell lines. Previous characterization of the TGF-β RII promoter region identified two discrete DNA binding protein complexes, an AP1/CREB-like transcription factor complex and a putative novel transcription factor complex. To determine whether these two protein complexes were similarly present in mouse keratinocyte cells, we synthesized a series of mutant oligonucleotides derived from PRE1 (Fig. 4A). Each mutant oligonucleotide contained a 4-base pair substitution mutation. EMSA was then performed using a radiolabeled PRE1 probe incubated with SV2neo nuclear extract in competition with the series of mutant oligonucleotides. As shown in Fig. 4B, specific binding was observed with a single protein complex that migrated at the same position as complex a, the previously identified AP1/CREB-like transcription factor complex. Competitive binding was abolished by mutation of the complex a target sequence. To confirm the identity of the single protein complex, another EMSA was performed with radiolabeled PRE1 oligonucleotide probe incubated with SV2neo nuclear extract in competition with double-stranded oligonucleotides representing the consensus sequences for several known transcription factors. Only the unlabeled AP1 and CRE sequences demonstrated competition with the labeled PRE1 probe for binding to the protein complex, indicating that it represents the AP1/CRE-like transcription factor (data not shown). Complex b (18Bae H.W. Geiser A.G. Kim D.H. Chung M.T. Burmester J.K. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Kim S.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29460-29468Google Scholar) interactions were extremely low or undetectable. To determine whether E1A expression affects interaction of transcription factor complex a with PRE1, another EMSA was performed utilizing a labeled PRE1 probe and nuclear extract from both dl799N and SV2neo cells. As shown in Fig. 5, interaction of complex a with PRE1 is markedly reduced in the E1A-expressing dl799N cell line compared with control. Lanes 1 and 3 represent reaction mixtures containing 5′ random-labeled oligonucleotide representing PRE1 (−219 to −172) incubated with 10 μg of purified SV2neo or dl799N nuclear extract, respectively. Lanes 2 and 4 demonstrate specificity of binding and represent identical reaction mixtures in competition with unlabeled PRE1 oligonucleotide. The level of activity represented by the minor bands is equivalent in both cell lines, demonstrating equal loading of protein. Semiquantitive analysis of the absolute levels of activity represented by the individual bands in this assay using a scintillation counter suggests a relative decrease of approximately 5-fold, which correlates well with the observed decrease in TGF-β RII transcriptional activity in E1A-expressing cells. However, direct quantitive comparisons of DNA-protein complex binding and transcriptional activity should be cautiously interpreted given the likelihood of additional factors influencing overall levels of transcription. We have previously described three discrete nuclear protein complexes that interact specifically with target sequences within PRE2. To demonstrate that the mouse keratinocyte cell line SV2neo expressed the same complement of proteins, we synthesized another series of mutant oligonucleotides based on the PRE2 DNA sequence (Fig. 6A). Each mutant oligonucleotide contained a 5-base pair substitution mutation. EMSA was performed using a 32P-labeled PRE2 double-stranded oligonucleotide probe incubated with SV2neo nuclear extract in competition with each mutant oligonucleotide. As shown in Fig. 6B, lane 1, three major protein complexes were observed in the absence of competing oligonucleotides. Mutation of nucleotides +16 to +20 (AAGTG, M4) led to decreased competition for binding to complex c, while competition for binding to complexes d and e was diminshed by mutations through a longer sequence from +11 to +29 (AGTTTCCTGTTTCCC, M3-M6). These target sequences are equivalent to those previously identified (Figs. 6B and 7) in other cell lines.Fig. 7Transformation of keratinocytes with E1A resulted in decreased binding of nuclear proteins to PRE2. EMSA was performed using 32P-labeled PRE2 oligonucleotide incubated with dl799N or SV2neo cell nuclear extracts in the presence (lanes 2 and 4) or absence (lanes 1 and 3) of unlabeled PRE2 competitor oligonucleotide. There were significant decreases in binding of protein complexes c, d, and e to the PRE2 target sequence in E1A-transformed dl799N keratinocytes compared with control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Another EMSA was performed using a 32P-labeled PRE2 oligonucleotide probe and nuclear extract from both dl799N and SV2neo cells. Fig. 7 shows that binding of all three complexes, a, b, and c, to PRE2 is significantly reduced in E1A-expressing dl799N cells compared with control. Lanes 1 and 3 contain reaction mixtures consisting of 5′ random-labeled oligonucleotide representing PRE2 (+1 to +50) incubated with 10 μg of purified SV2neo or dl799N nuclear extract, respectively. Lanes 2 and 4 contained identical reaction mixtures in competition with unlabeled PRE2 oligonucleotide to demonstrate specificity of binding. Activity of the rapidly migrating minor band in lanes 1 and 3 is equivalent, indicating equivalent protein loading. To compare the activity of PRE1 and PRE2 in both E1A-transformed and untransformed cells, we created a series of CAT constructs containing various combinations of mutations and deletions in the X and Y target sequences of PRE1 as well as the Z target sequence of PRE2. Fig. 8 presents a schematic representation of the constructs used. In each case, presence of a bar indicates that the wild-type sequence is intact while absence signifies that the sequence has been mutated. These constructs were transfected into both SV2neo and dl799N cells, and CAT activity was assayed as a measure of transcriptional activity. Fig. 8 shows that basal transcriptional activity of the TGF-β RII promoter in both cell lines is principally dependent on the Y target sequence on PRE1 and the Z target sequence on PRE2. A comparison of the activity of constructs −219/+35 and −219M7/+35 reveals that mutation of the Y sequence markedly reduces measured CAT activity following transfection into both the SV2neo control keratinocyte cell line as well as the d1799N E1A-transformed cell line. Similarly, comparing −219/+35 to −219/+35M3 demonstrates that mutation of the Z sequence leads to an equally sharp decrease in basal transcription rates in both cell lines. In contrast, mutation of the X target sequence, which interacts with a binding protein that appears not to be expressed in mouse keratinocytes, failed to inhibit transcriptional activity to any significant degree (compare activity of construct −219/+35 with construct −219M5/+35). The highest level of transcriptional activity was obtained following transfection of constructs containing intact Y and Z target sequences (constructs −219/+35 and −219M5/+35), and conversely, the lowest level of activity was observed with the use of constructs containing mutations or deletions of the Y and Z target sequences (constructs −219M7/+35M3 and −219M7/+2). Overall transcriptional activity was markedly reduced in E1A-transformed cells (range from 0.6 to 5.2% acetylation) compared with control (range from 1.3 to 23.5% acetylation). However, the pattern of CAT activity was identical for the two different cell lines, indicating that both PRE1 and PRE2 regulatory elements are functional in dl799N cells despite their lower activity levels. A growing body of experimental evidence supports the concept that TGF-β RII operates as a tumor suppressor gene (16Markowitz S. Roberts A.B. Cytokine & Growth Factor Reviews. 7. Elsevier Science, Cambridge1996: 93-102Google Scholar, 17Kim D.H. Kim S.-J. J. Biomed. Sci. 1996; 3: 143-158Google Scholar). Expression of TGF-β RII is required for the growth inhibitory effects of TGF-β ligands on proliferating epithelial cells. Mutation of the TGF-β RII gene has been observed in a number of different human malignancies, including colon, gastric, and endometrial cancers, and is highly correlated with the development of TGF-β resistance (15Myeroff L.L. Parsons R. Kim S.-J. Hedrick L. Cho K.R. Orth K. Mathis M. Kinzler K.W. Lutterbaugh J. Park K. Bang Y.-J. Lee H.Y. Park J.-G. Lynch H.T. Roberts A.B. Vogelstein B. Markowitz S.D. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5545-5547Google Scholar). Transfecting human breast cancer and colon cancer as well as hepatoma cells lacking type II receptor with wild type TGF-β type II receptor restores sensitivity to TGF-β and decreases tumorigenicity in transplanted breast and colon cancer cells (31Inagaki M. Moustaka A. Lin H.Y. Lodish H.F. Carr B.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5359-5363Google Scholar, 32Sun L. Wu G. Willson J.K.V. Zborowska E. Yang J. Rajkarunanayake I. Wang J. Gentry L.E. Wang X.-F. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26449-26455Google Scholar). Moreover, transfection of antisense TGF-β1 into a TGF-β-sensitive FET colon cancer cell line enhances its tumorigenicity (33Wu S. Theodorescu D. Kerbel R. Willson J.K.V. Mulder K. Humphrey L. Brattain M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 187-196Google Scholar). Similarly, numerous studies indicate that transcriptional regulation makes an important contribution to determining the level of expression of TGF-β RII. Transfection of TGF-β-sensitive murine myeloid cells with the src oncogene results in development of TGF-β resistance, which correlates with decreased expression of TGF-β RII protein and mRNA (34Birchenall-Roberts M. Ruscetti F. Kasper J. Lee H.D. Friedman R. Geiser A. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Kim S.-J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4978-4983Google Scholar). Conversely, transfection of TGF-β-resistant esophageal epithelial cells with cyclin D1 leads to enhanced expression of TGF-β RII mRNA and protein along with increased TGF-β sensitivity (35Okamoto A. Jiang W. Kim S.-J. Spillare E.A. Stoner G.D. Weinstein I.B. Harris C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11576-11580Google Scholar). Our previous study of the TGF-β RII promoter reported the presence of two separate positive regulatory elements in addition to the core promoter element (18Bae H.W. Geiser A.G. Kim D.H. Chung M.T. Burmester J.K. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Kim S.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29460-29468Google Scholar), and we have since confirmed the presence of at least two additional negative regulatory elements. 3D. H. Kim, S. G. Choi, J. H. Chang, K. H. Lee, and S.-J. Kim, unpublished results. Each regulatory element interacts with multiple nuclear DNA binding proteins, including several putative novel transcription factors, in a sequence-specific manner. Such a complex array of interdependent regulatory elements and binding proteins easily allows for the possibility of multiple parallel transcriptional regulatory pathways. Our findings, as presented in the current study, demonstrate that transformation of keratinocytes with the E1A oncogene is associated with decreased expression of TGF-β RII protein and an absolute reduction in steady-state levels of TGF-β mRNA resulting from down-regulation of TGF-β RII promoter activity. Specific binding of nuclear protein complexes to the first and second positive regulatory elements of TGF-β RII is markedly decreased in E1A-transformed cells compared with control, suggesting that transcription of TGF-β RII is being repressed at the level of transcription factor expression or DNA interaction. Quantitatively, the decrease in TGF-β RII transcript level demonstrated in Fig. 1 and the lower cell-surface expression of TGF-β RII shown in Fig. 2 may not appear to correlate with the 3- to 6-fold decrease in transcriptional activity from the reporter construct revealed in Fig. 3. The influence of additional uncharacterized enhancer- and/or repressor-like elements on the specific cellular expression levels of TGF-β RII cannot be ruled out. Moreover, absolute levels of transcript and protein are likely influenced by additional variably active cellular processes that make a direct quantitative analysis impossible. Similar transfection experiments have been performed utilizing SNU gastric cancer cells resistant to growth inhibition by TGF-β. Preliminary data suggest that PRE2 may have a more significant role in determining TGF-β RII transcription levels in SNU cells. 4K. H. Lee and S.-J. Kim, unpublished results. In this study, it also appears as if the interaction of complexes c, d, and e with PRE2 demonstrate a greater overall decrease compared with the interaction of complex a and PRE1. Moreover, Fig. 8 reveals that the greatest difference in transcriptional activity occurs when PRE2 alone is altered. These data suggest that the nuclear factors interacting with PRE2 may constitute the more important targets in transcriptional regulation of TGF-β RII expression. A previous study by Missero et al. (27Missero C. Filvaroff E. Dotto G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3489-3493Google Scholar) also examined the phenomenon of TGF-β resistance resulting from transformation of keratinocytes with the E1A oncogene. Their data revealed that development of resistance to TGF-β1 growth inhibition most closely correlated with binding of E1A proteins to the retinoblastoma gene product, pRb, and three other unidentified cellular proteins, p60, p107, and p300. These results led them to conclude that TGF-β resistance in cells transformed with E1A developed via a postreceptor mechansim involving negative interactions with downstream elements of the TGF-β signaling pathway. Although it is conceivable that a postreceptor mechanism also contributes to the observed decrease in TGF-β sensitivity that occurs in E1A-transformed cells, our data strongly support the existence of an additional mechanism that results in direct transcriptional down-regulation of TGF-β type II receptor expression as well. Moreover, our finding that E1A expression results in decreased binding of specific nuclear proteins to the TGF-β RII promoter suggests an alternative interpretation of the results previously reported by Missero et al. The p60 protein has been identified as a human cyclin A protein (37Webster K.A. Muscat G.E. Kedes L. Nature. 1988; 332: 553-557Google Scholar); however, one or both of the other two unidentified proteins, which are negatively regulated by E1A oncogene products, may be identical to the putative novel transcription factors responsible for activating transcription of TGF-β RII. E1A-mediated effects in other cell systems have been demonstrated to occur through transcriptional down-regulation of specific gene expression. Transfection of mouse C2 myocytes with the E1A oncogene inhibits myogenic differentiation of these cells (37Webster K.A. Muscat G.E. Kedes L. Nature. 1988; 332: 553-557Google Scholar). E1A exerts its effect in these cells through two separate mechanisms, inhibition of expression of a myogenic regulatory factor, MyoD, and repression of MyoD-activated transcription (38Caruso M. Martelli F. Giordano A. Felsani A. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 267-278Google Scholar). Both effects require the presence of two separate conserved regions of the E1A oncogene. These regions are identical to the domains of E1A required for transformation of keratinocytes, supporting the likelihood that the transforming properties of E1A similarly involve transcriptional regulation. Adenovirus-host cell interactions have also served as an informative model for studying a particular type of transcriptional regulation involving nucleotide-specific DNA methylation. This mechanism for repressing gene transcription occurs in mammalian DNA most commonly at deoxycytodine residues within dinucleotide couplets known as CpG islands. One such CpG island is located in the inactive target sequence of TGF-β RII PRE1, and multiple CpG islands can also be found immediately flanking the PRE2 target sequence. Insertion of adenovirus DNA has been shown to alter methylation patterns of adjacent host DNA and, consequently, has clear potential to affect transcriptional activity of nearby promoter elements (39Doerfler W. Adv. Virus Res. 1991; 39: 89Google Scholar). Although DNA methylation is unlikely to contribute to the TGF-β RII down-regulation observed in our study, it is interesting to speculate that enhanced methylation of PRE1 and/or PRE2 sequences plays a complementary role in repressing TGF-β RII expression as well as viral oncogenesis, and we are currently performing a preliminary analysis of TGF-β RII promoter methylation patterns. In summary, this study demonstrates that E1A transformation of keratinocytes is associated with down-regulation of TGF-β type II receptor expression resulting from a specific decrease in transcriptional activation of the TGF-β RII promoter region. The mechanism underlying this decreased expression has been shown to involve decreased interaction between several putative novel transcription factor proteins and their specific target sequences within the two positive regulatory regions, PRE1 and PRE2, of the TGF-β RII promoter. Further research is being performed to determine whether decreased binding is a consequence of decreased expression of the transcriptional factors, decreased activation of an inactive form, or competitive binding. The findings from our study provide additional support for the concept that the TGF-β type II receptor subserves an important tumor suppressor function in mammalian cells. Inactivation of the receptor in E1A-transformed keratinocytes disables the earliest stage of the TGF-β signaling pathway and abolishes TGF-β-mediated growth inhibition, and insofar as this model reproduces key general molecular events of carcinogenesis, transcriptional down-regulation of TGF-β RII may play a corresponding role in development of the TGF-β-resistant, aggressive cell growth demonstrated by various human carcinomas.

Lipstatin was analyzed by one- and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy. 13C total correlation spectroscopy and INADEQUATE experiments show that two fatty acid fragments containing 14 and 8 carbon atoms, respectively, are incorporated en bloc into lipstatin. The 14-carbon fragment is preferentially derived from the unsaturated fatty acid fraction, as shown by an experiment with hydrogenated U-13C-lipid mixture, which is conducive to labeling of the 8-carbon moiety but not of the 14-carbon moiety. The data indicate that the lipstatin molecule can be assembled by Claisen condensation of octanoyl-CoA with 3-hydroxy-∆5,8-tetradecanoyl-CoA obtained by β oxidation of linoleic acid. The formation of lipstatin from acetate units by a polyketide-type pathway is ruled out conclusively by these data. The data show that surprisingly clear labeling patterns can be obtained in studies with crude, universally 13C-labeled precursor mixtures that are proffered together with a large excess of unlabeled material.

One- and two-dimensional 13C total correlation spectroscopy analyses are suggested as elegant methods for the delineation of contiguously 13C-labeled biosynthetic blocks. Lipstatin (Fig. 1, 1) and its tetrahydroderivative tetrahydrolipstatin (Fig. 1, 2) are potent inhibitors of pancreatic lipase (1Weibel E.K. Hadvary P. Hochuli E. Kupfer E. Lengsfeld H. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1987; 40: 1081-1085Google Scholar, 2Hadvary P. Lengsfeld H. Wolfer H. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 357-361Google Scholar, 3Borgstr÷m B. Biochim. Biophys.

Tetrahydrolipstatin is presently in clinical trials as an antiobesity agent. Tetrahydrolipstatin has been shown to form a covalent adduct with a serine moiety of human pancreatic lipase by transesterification (5Lüthi-Peng Q. Märki H.-P. Hadvary P. FEBS Lett. 1992; 299: 111-115Google Scholar). Lipstatin is produced by Streptomyces toxytricini (1Weibel E.K. Hadvary P. Hochuli E. Kupfer E. Lengsfeld H. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1987; 40: 1081-1085Google Scholar). The structure is characterized by a β lacton ring carrying two aliphatic residues with chain lengths of 6 and 13 carbon atoms (6Hochuli E. Kupfer E. Maurer R. Meister W. Mercadal Y. Schmidt K. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1987; 40: 1086-1091Google Scholar and Fig. 1). One of the side chains contains two isolated double bonds and a hydroxy group esterified to N-formylleucine. Structurally, lipstatin is closely related to the esterase inhibitor esterastin, which contains a N-acetylasparagine side chain instead of N-formylleucine (7Kondo S. Kotani K. Miyamoto M. Hazato T. Naganawa H. Aoyagi T. Umezawa H. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1978; 31: 797-800Google Scholar). Tetrahydrolipstatin can be obtained by catalytic hydrogenation of lipstatin (6Hochuli E. Kupfer E. Maurer R. Meister W. Mercadal Y. Schmidt K. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1987; 40: 1086-1091Google Scholar). Total synthesis of tetrahydrolipstatin has been reported (8Hanessian S. Tehim A. Chen P. J. Org. Chem. 1993; 58: 7768-7781Google Scholar). Nothing is known about the biosynthesis of lipstatin. Initial biosynthetic studies with isotope-labeled acetate were not conducive to the incorporation of label into lipstatin. 1W. Weber, E. Kupfer, and H. Leuenberger, unpublished data. The long alkyl side chains of lipstatin could be biosynthesized from acetate via a polyketide pathway or from preformed fatty acids. S. toxytricini can be grown on medium containing large amounts of lipids, and it appeared likely that these were actively metabolized by the microorganism. In that case, 13C-labeled lipids could be incorporated into lipstatin by partial degradation of preformed fatty acids or by total degradation via acetyl-CoA. Triglycerides with appropriate 13C labeling were not commercially available. We therefore decided to use a mixture of universally 13C-labeled lipids, which was obtained by acetone extraction of algal biomass grown with 13CO2. This complex mixture was extensively diluted with soybean oil (natural 13C abundance) for the preparation of culture media. In conjunction with advanced NMR techniques, this approach was conducive to the elucidation of the building blocks of lipstatin. This method appears to be generally useful for biosynthetic studies on compounds with a putative origin from fatty acid precursors. The crude U-13C-lipid mixture used in this study was purchased from Dr. H. Oschkinat (European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany). It was prepared by acetone extraction of algal biomass (Scenedesmus obliquus) grown on 13CO2. The acetone extract was evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure. The black, oily material was used as a supplement to the culture medium without purification. A solution of 13C-lipid (crude algal extract, 277 mg) in 6 ml of ethanol was hydrogenated over 550 mg of Raney nickel (500C, 10-bar hydrogen, 3 h). The product still contained approximately 8% of C18:1 fatty acid according to GC 2The abbreviations used are: GCgas chromatographyMSmass spectrometryTOCSYtotal correlation spectroscopyCOSYcorrelated spectroscopyDEPTdistortionless enhancement by polarization transferHMQCheteronuclear multiple quantum correlation spectroscopyHMBCheteronuclear multiple quantum multiple bond correlation spectroscopyMLEVMalcom Levitt decoupling sequence. analysis.

An aliquot of the 13C-labeled lipid mixture (20 mg) and 1.25 mg of pentadecanoic acid were dissolved in 10 ml of 0.5 M sodium methylate in methanol. The mixture was heated to 600C in a screw cap glass for 30 min and was then acidified with 4 ml of 3.6% hydrochloric acid in methanol. An aliquot of 5 ml was diluted with 3 ml of water, and the mixture was extracted with 5 ml of n-hexane. The resulting fatty acid methyl esters were identified by GC/MS on a capillary column (DBWAX; 20 m, 0.3-μm film; temperature gradient, 120-2500C, 40C/min; splitless injection). Quantitative GC analysis of the methyl esters was performed on a capillary column (OV-225; 25 m, 0.25 μm; temperature gradient, 140-2200C, 30C/min). Pentadecanoic acid methylester was used as internal standard for quantification, and dihomo-γ-linoleic acid ethyl ester (97.4% purity by weight) was used as a reference substance. The 13C content of fatty acid residues was determined by GC/MS analysis (electron impact ionization) of the methyl esters. For biosynthetic studies, the U-13C-labeled precursors had to be diluted extensively with unlabeled material. Per 35 ml of fermentation medium, 1.8 g of soybean oil and 0.1 g of the 13C-labeled lipid mixture or hydrogenated 13C-labeled lipid mixture were used. The lipids were emulsified in water using 0.5 g of soybean lecithin as an emulsifier. The medium also contained soybean flour (1.4 g) and glycerol (0.7 g). The pH was adjusted to 7.4 before sterilization (1210C, 20 min). After seeding with S. toxytricini, the culture was incubated for 7 days at 270C and 70% relative humidity on a rotary shaker at 220 rpm and 5-cm throw. Fermentation broth (58 ml) was extracted with 150 ml of acetone and 100 ml of hexane. After separation of the organic layer, the aqueous layer was extracted three times with 100 ml of a 1:1 mixture of acetone and hexane. The combined organic extracts were dried with sodium sulfate and concentrated to yield a green oil (3.1 g) containing 173 mg of lipstatin. The material was dissolved in hexane (40 ml) and placed on a column of silica gel (Bond Elut, 10 g). The column was developed with hexane (40 ml) and hexane/ethyl acetate at dilutions of 20:1 (v/v, 300 ml), 10:1 (200 ml), 20:3 (200 ml), and 5:1 (200 ml), yielding 220 mg of crude material after evaporation of solvent. Second chromatography on silica gel using the same procedure afforded 163 mg of semipure material. Further purification was done by reversed phase chromatography. Lipstatin was dissolved in 50% aqueous isopropanol (25 ml) and placed on a column of Bond Elut C-18 (10 g) which was developed with 50% isopropanol (225 ml) and 60% isopropanol (150 ml). Fractions containing lipstatin were concentrated by evaporation under reduced pressure, and the residue was extracted with ethyl acetate. The extract was dried with sodium sulfate and was concentrated to dryness, yielding 112 mg of lipstatin with 88% purity (high performance liquid chromatography, percentage of area) containing 9% of lipstatin analogs. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 360 and 90.6 MHz, respectively, with a Bruker AM 360 spectrometer equipped with fast power switching of the transmitter output, an external pulse amplifier (BFX5, Bruker), and a selective excitation unit (Bruker). Chloroform-d was used as a solvent. 1H NMR spectra were measured as follows: 500 pulse (4 μs); repetition time, 2.5 s; spectral width, 5.3 kHz; data set, 16 kilowords; temperature, 250C; and 0.1-Hz line broadening. 13C NMR spectra were measured as follows: 300 pulse (2 μs); repetition time, 2.8 s; spectral width, 25.0 kHz; data set, 32 kilowords zero filled to 64 kilowords; temperature, 250C; and 1H composite pulse decoupling. Two-dimensional double quantum-filtered COSY, DEPT, and INADEQUATE experiments were performed according to standard Bruker software (DISR87). Phase-sensitive two-dimensional TOCSY spectroscopy was done according to the method of Bax and Davis (9Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar). 1H-Detected multiple quantum 1H-13C chemical shift correlation experiments (HMQC and HMBC) were performed according to the methods of Bax and Subramanian (10Bax A. Subramanian S. J. Magn. Reson. 1986; 67: 565-569Google Scholar) and Bax and Summers (11Bax A. Summers M.F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 2093-2094Google Scholar). Samples were not rotated during two-dimensional experiments. Data acquisition and processing parameters for two-dimensional experiments were: COSY, 32 scans/t1 increment, 2.0-s relaxation delay, 480 × 2048 raw data matrix size, zero filled to 2048 words in t1 and processed with 2-Hz Gaussian in the f1 dimension, and 900-shifted sine bell filtering in the f2 dimension; TOCSY, 32 scans/t1 increment, 2.0-s relaxation delay, 62-ms MLEV-17 mixing period preceded and followed by 2.5-ms trim pulses, 900 pulse width, 44 μs, 512 × 2048 raw data matrix size, zero filled to 2048 words in f1 and processed with 2-Hz Gaussian in the f1 dimension, and 900-shifted sine bell filtering in the f2 dimension; HMQC, 256 scans/t1 increment, start of coherence experiment 159 ms after a bilinear rotation decoupling pulse, 3.5-ms delay period for evolution of 1JCH corresponding to a coupling of 143 Hz, 13C decoupling during acquisition by globally optimized alternating phase rectangular pulse sequence 1, 500 × 1024 raw data matrix size, zero filled to 1024 words in t1 and processed with 10-Hz Gaussian in f1, and 900-shifted squared sine filtering in f2; HMBC, 64 scans/t1 increment, 1.8-s relaxation delay, 3.5-ms delay for suppression of 1JCH, 60-ms delay period for evolution of long-range couplings (2JCH and 3JCH) corresponding to a coupling of 8 Hz, and 350 × 2048 raw data matrix size, zero filled to 1024 words in t1 and processed with 20-Hz Gaussian in f1 and in f2; and INADEQUATE, 128 scans/t1 increment, 1.5-s relaxation delay, Ernst-type phase cycle, 5.0-ms delay for evolution of 1JCC, and 350 × 2048 raw data matrix size, zero filled to 2048 words in t1 and processed with 600-shifted sine bell filtering in f1 and f2. Phase-sensitive two-dimensional 13C TOCSY experiments were performed with a MLEV-17-based mixing period (9Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar). The 13C excitation pulse was generated in the transmitter high power output level (900 pulse, 5 μs). 13C pulses for mixing were generated in the transmitter low power output level amplified with a BFX5 unit (900 pulse, 30 μs). The MLEV-17 mixing period was 45 ms and was preceded and followed by 2.5-ms trim pulses. The data were acquired in the phase-sensitive mode using time-proportional phase increments. Other data acquisition and processing parameters were: 48 scans per t1 increment, 2.0-s relaxation delay, and 400 × 2048 raw data matrix size, zero filled to 2048 in t1 and processed with 900-shifted, squared sine bell functions in f1 and Gaussian broadening in f2. One-dimensional 13C TOCSY experiments were performed with selective excitation using a Gaussian- or half-Gaussian-shaped pulse of 5 ms in length generated by the transmitter output of a selective excitation unit (Bruker). The transfer of magnetization between 13C atoms was achieved by a MLEV-17-based mixing period (45 ms) preceded and followed by trim pulses (2.5 ms). The pulses for mixing were generated in the low power output of the transmitter amplified with a BFX5 unit (900 pulse, 30 μs). A 1H and 13C NMR analysis of lipstatin providing assignments for some of the carbon atoms has been reported (6Hochuli E. Kupfer E. Maurer R. Meister W. Mercadal Y. Schmidt K. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1987; 40: 1086-1091Google Scholar). However, since the biosynthetic study depended crucially on unequivocal assignments for all 13C signals, a more detailed NMR analysis using double quantum-filtered COSY, 1H TOCSY, and inverse carbon-proton correlation experiments such as HMQC and HMBC was in order. Additional assignment information was afforded by 13C TOCSY and INADEQUATE analysis of multiple 13C-labeled lipstatin samples obtained in the labeling experiments described below. 1H and 13C NMR signal assignments of lipstatin are summarized in Table I.Table I.1H and 13C NMR assignments of lipstatinPositionChemical shiftaInternally referenced to CDCl3, 1H signal at 7.24 ppm relative to tetramethylsilane, 13C signal at 77.0 ppm relative to tetramethylsilane.JCCbFrom one-dimensional 13C or selective 13C TOCSY spectra of biosynthetically 13C-enriched samples.

Open table in a new tab An acetone extract of totally 13C-labeled algal biomass obtained by growth of Scenedesmus obliquus on 99% enriched 13CO2 as a carbon source was obtained from Dr. H. Oschkinat. After evaporation of the solvent, the viscous oil appeared almost black. The dark color was in part due to the presence of chlorophylls in considerable amount. For assessment of the fatty acid content, the crude algal lipid mixture was subjected to methanolysis, and the resulting fatty acid methyl esters were analyzed by coupled gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (G. Oesterhelt, Hoffmann-La Roche AG). The results are shown in Table II. The combined fatty acid residues account for about 40% (w/w) of the total material. Eleven fatty acids with chain lengths of 14-18 carbon atoms were determined in widely different abundance. In the saturated fraction, palmitic acid was the dominant component. The combined unsaturated fatty acids accounted for 32% (w/w) of the crude material. The dominant components were linolenic acid (about 21%) and linoleic acid (about 8%). The 13C abundance was approximately 97%.Table IIAnalysis of fatty acids in lipid extract of Scenedesmus obliquusFatty acidU-13C-lipidHydrogenated U-13C-lipid% (w/w)% (w/w)14:00.71.216:06.112.116:10.716:1, Ω-70.616:20.518:00.225.318:1, Ω-90.418:1, Ω-70.618:2, Ω-68.218:3, Ω-321.2Sum39.238.6 Open table in a new tab An aliquot of the U-13C-lipid mixture from algae was subjected to two consecutive cycles of catalytic hydrogenation over Raney nickel.

Fermentation experiments were performed with S. toxytricini and the culture medium reported earlier (1Weibel E.K. Hadvary P. Hochuli E. Kupfer E. Lengsfeld H. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1987; 40: 1081-1085Google Scholar). To detect the joint transfer of 13C-labeled atoms, it is important to dilute the U-13C-labeled precursors extensively with unlabeled material. We used the 13C-labeled lipid mixture and unlabeled soybean oil at a ratio of 1:17.4 (w/w) for the preparation of the fermentation medium. After cultivation for 7 days, lipstatin was isolated as described under “Materials and Methods.” The analysis of the 13C satellites in the 1H NMR spectrum of lipstatin gave 13C enrichments of about 4%. This indicated that the 13C-labeled algal lipid had been metabolized by the organism at a similar rate as soybean oil and had served as a precursor of the lipstatin molecule. The 13C NMR spectrum of lipstatin revealed the presence of extensive 13C-13C coupling in the biolabeled molecule (Fig. 2). For example, the 13C signal of C-3 was characterized by a central signal at 74.9 ppm and by a doublet (1JCC, 39.2 Hz) resulting from coupling to one adjacent 13C atom (C-2 or C-4). The 13C satellites of C-5 appeared at a distance of 78.2 Hz. Coupling to either C-4 or C-6 should result in a coupling constant of about 40 Hz due to the aliphatic nature of C-4 and C-6. Therefore, the observed coupling signature must result from simultaneous coupling to two adjacent 13C atoms (i.e. C-4 and C-6) yielding a pseudo-triplet (1JCC, 39.1 Hz) where the central component overlaps with the uncoupled singlet (Fig. 2). It follows that the carbon atoms C-4-C-6 were derived en bloc from the uniformly 13C-labeled algal lipid. Similarly, the signal of C-2 was characterized by simultaneous 13C coupling to two 13C spins via one-bond coupling (1JCC, 42.4 Hz and 38.0 Hz, respectively) and to one 13C spin via two-bond coupling (2JCC, 3.6 Hz) (Fig. 2). The analysis of 13C-13C coupling in terms of multiplicities in the one-dimensional 13C NMR spectrum is summarized in Table III. These data show already that biosynthetic modules containing more than two carbon atoms were incorporated into the lipstatin molecule. However, the size of these respective building blocks can be addressed much better by two-dimensional NMR analysis as described below.Table III.13C-13C-coupling pattern of lipstatin biosynthesized from a mixture of U-13C-lipid and soybean oil or from a mixture of hydrogenated U-13C-lipid and soybean oilCarbon atomaCarbon atoms are listed according to Table II.U-13C-lipidHydrogenated U-13C-lipidMultbMultiplicity of 13C-coupled satellite signals (d, doublet; dd, double doublet; t, pseudo-triplet).INADEQUATE2D-13C TOCSYcTwo-dimensional 13C TOCSY experiment encompassed the aliphatic spectral region (80-10 ppm).

Observed cross-peaks are indicated.d nd, not determined due to signal overlapping. Open table in a new tab A section of a two-dimensional 13C INADEQUATE experiment is shown in Fig. 3. The double quantum-filtering technique monitors pairs of adjacent 13C atoms but not isolated 13C nuclei. Due to the low natural abundance of 13C, INADEQUATE is notorious for its low sensitivity. However, pairs of 13C atoms that were contiguously incorporated from multiple 13C-labeled precursors are diagnosed with high sensitivity. The data in Fig. 3 indicate 13C-13C coupling between the carbon atoms 3 and 4, 4 and 5, and 5 and 6, suggesting the presence of molecules with contiguous 13C labeling between C-3 and C-6. A more detailed analysis (Table III) proves that 13C-13C coupling occurs between each individual pair of adjacent carbon atoms in both alkyl side chains, thus suggesting that these modules were incorporated en bloc from their respective precursors. However, 13C-13C coupling was not detected between C-3 and C-2, as shown by the absence of signals at the positions marked by open circles in Fig. 3. It follows that the bond between C-2 and C-3 was formed in the biosynthetic pathway and was not present in the totally labeled precursor molecule. Bond formation involving one labeled precursor molecule would most frequently involve an unlabeled reaction partner, and the frequency of 13C-13C coupling along this bond should be as low as about 4% (i.e. undetectable) compared with about 97% for jointly transferred carbon pairs. Contiguous 13C labeling throughout both alkyl side chains is also obvious by 13C TOCSY methods. The physical basis of the TOCSY experiment is the exchange of magnetization between directly coupled spins by a radiofrequency field (spin lock field). In the case of a two-dimensional experiment, the result of the mixing process is that a spin (1H or 13C) shows a correlation cross-peak to each of the nuclei in a contiguous spin system. A transfer of magnetization under the influence of a spin lock field was introduced by Davis and Bax (12Davis D.G. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 2820-2821Google Scholar) in 1985. To improve the performance of the experiment, periodic phase alteration (MLEV-17) of the spin lock pulses was implemented (10Bax A. Subramanian S. J. Magn. Reson. 1986; 67: 565-569Google Scholar). Traditionally, the TOCSY experiment is used to assign scalar coupled 1H spin systems. More recently, TOCSY pulse trains were also applied to transfer magnetization between 13C of labeled biopolymers (13Bax A. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. J. Magn. Reson. 1990; 88: 425-431Google Scholar). However, the 13C TOCSY experiment is used infrequently in the evaluation of biosynthetic pathways and therefore requires some technical comments. The most important difference between 1H and 13C TOCSY methods is the larger spectral width of the 13C chemical shift range. Efficient transfer of magnetization by the spin lock pulse requires a sufficiently high power of spin lock field B1. Typically, γB1 should exceed the spectral width. However, the maximum strength of the B1 field is limited by the thermal and electronic stability of the probe head during the relatively long mixing period (typically 10-60 ms). To optimize the experimental parameters, we performed a series of two-dimensional 13C TOCSY experiments with [U-13C]lysine. A spin lock field of 8 kHz applied for 45 ms enabled the transfer of magnetization over a relatively wide frequency range (15 kHz) between all of the six carbon atoms of lysine. However, it should be noted that the cross-peak intensity between the carboxylic carbon and the side chain carbon atoms decreased approximately by a factor 10 relative to the other cross-peaks, which had similar intensities. To improve the limited digital resolution of this two-dimensional experiment (e.g. for extraction of coupling constants), we performed a selective excitation of a single 13C frequency followed by a 13C TOCSY mixing process. The selective excitation was achieved by a 5-ms Gauss or semi-Gauss pulse. In model experiments with [U-13C]lysine, we were able to transfer magnetization from the α-carbon to C-3-C-6 with similar efficiency and to C-1 with decreased intensity. Obviously, the spin lock field (8 kHz) was too weak to achieve efficient magnetization transfer between C-1 and C-2 of lysine, which are separated by approximately 12 kHz from each other. Since the intensities of C-3-C-6 in the one-dimensional 13C TOCSY spectrum were similar, the applied spin lock field was optimal for a frequency range of 3-4 kHz. These results served as a basis for the 13C TOCSY experiments with lipstatin. Fig. 4 shows a part of a phase-sensitive two-dimensional 13C TOCSY experiment with lipstatin from the fermentation with U-13C-lipid encompassing the aliphatic spectral region (80-10 ppm). The transfer of magnetization is highlighted in Fig. 4 among C-3-C-6 and among C-2 and C-1ʹ-C-6ʹ. Again, no transfer of magnetization was observed between C-2 and C-3. Additionally, a series of selective one-dimensional 13C-TOCSY experiments was performed (Table III). Fig. 5 shows spectra obtained by selective excitation of C-3 and C-2, respectively, and subsequent isotropic mixing. Due to the physical basis of the experiment, only signals were observed that result from magnetization transfer from the excited carbon. Consequently, the highly crowded 13C-coupled one-dimensional 13C spectrum can be edited by this spectroscopic technique (Fig. 5). It should be noted that the 13C spin lock field was not strong enough to achieve magnetization transfer from the aliphatic C-6 to the alkene carbon atoms. However, the signal of C-6 in the one-dimensional 13C TOCSY experiment is a pseudo-triplet (Fig. 5B), which clearly indicates contiguous 13C coupling to the unsaturated C-7 of lipstatin. In combination with signal multiplicities in the one-dimensional 13C NMR spectrum (i.e. double doublets of the inner chain carbon atoms, indicating contiguous coupling) and the INADEQUATE results, this proves the presence of isotopomers with contiguous 13C labeling extending from C-16 to C-3, and from C-1 to C-6ʹ (Fig. 6A). We conclude that the lipstatin molecule is assembled from a 14-carbon (C-16-C-3) and an 8-carbon (C-1-C-6ʹ) moiety, which can both be derived en bloc from the U-13C-lipid mixture supplied as a precursor.Fig. 513C NMR spectra of lipstatin from fermentation with U-13C-lipid.

Bold lines, contiguously 13C-labeled atoms.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Two pairs of labeled carbon atoms (i.e. C-1ʹ/C-2ʹ, and C-4ʹ/C-5ʹ) were incorporated into the leucine side chain from the 13C-labeled lipid mixtures. This signifies the diversion of multiple 13C-labeled components of the lipid mixture to the biosynthesis of the amino acid. The presence of two isolated double bonds in the 14-carbon moiety suggested that it might be derived preferentially or exclusively from the unsaturated fatty acid fraction of the 13C-labeled precursor mixture (i.e. more specifically, from linoleic acid). To check this hypothesis, we used a totally hydrogenated U-13C-lipid mixture for an incorporation experiment. The hydrogenated U-13C-lipid was mixed with soybean oil at a ratio of 1:17.4 (w/w), and the mixture was proffered to a growing culture of S. toxytricini. Lipstatin was isolated and analyzed by NMR spectroscopy as described above. The 13C NMR signals of the 8-carbon moiety were again characterized by the presence of 13C-coupled satellites, whereas the carbon atoms of the 14-carbon moiety showed no 13C-13C coupling in the one-dimensional NMR experiment (Table III). Analysis by two-dimensional INADEQUATE and 13C TOCSY spectroscopy is summarized in Table III and confirmed that the 8-carbon moiety but not the 14-carbon moiety was consecutively labeled (Fig. 6B). It follows that the unsaturated 14-carbon moiety was not biolabeled in the experiment with the hydrogenated U-13C-lipid. Apparently, this part of lipstatin was exclusively derived from the unsaturated fraction of the unlabeled soybean oil supplement in this experiment. The labeling pattern of the leucine residue was the same as in the experiment described above. We have demonstrated that the lipstatin backbone is assembled from two moieties consisting of 8 and 14 carbon atoms, respectively, which were both contiguously labeled with 13C from a U-13C-lipid mixture. Since the uniformly 13C-labeled lipids were proffered together with a large excess of unlabeled lipid material, this result shows that both building blocks were derived from precursor lipids by partial catabolism of fatty acid residues. The de novo synthesis of the building blocks from smaller units such as acetate could not possibly yield lipstatin molecules with uninterrupted 13C labeling of long alkyl chains, since labeled and unlabeled precursor molecules would be interspersed at random, thus conducing to noncontiguous 13C labeling, as shown in the formylleucine moiety of lipstatin. In this case, the TOCSY transfer of magnetization along the alkyl chain would be interrupted. Catalytic hydrogenation destroys the potential of the 13C-labeled lipid mixture to serve as a precursor for the 14-carbon moiety. However, the hydrogenated lipid mixture is still used efficiently as a precursor of the 8-carbon moiety and of leucine. It follows that the 14-carbon moiety is specifically derived from an unsaturated component of the U-13C-lipid mixture. Linoleic acid has the same pattern of double bonds as the unsaturated side chain of lipstatin and could be converted to an appropriate precursor by β oxidation (Fig. 7). Alternative pathways for the partial degradation of linoleic acid, such as the pathway described recently in rat liver (14Luo M.J. Smeland T.E. Shoukry K. Schulz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2384-2388Google Scholar, 15He X.-Y. Shoukry K. Chu C. Yang J. Sprecher H. Schulz H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 15-22Google Scholar), cannot be ruled out on basis of the available data. On the basis of the observed labeling patterns, we propose the following pathway for the biosynthesis of lipstatin (Fig. 8). The 14-carbon moiety is derived from linoleic acid by partial β oxidation, resulting in the release of 2 acetate units. The CoA ester of 3-hydroxy-∆5,8-tetradecanoic acid (Fig. 8, 3) could serve directly as a component for Claisen condensation. Similarly, the 8-carbon component could be obtained by partial β oxidation of long chain fatty acids. The resulting octanoyl-CoA (Fig. 8, 4) could then undergo the proposed Claisen condensation with the CoA ester of 3-hydroxy-∆5,8-tetradecanoic acid, resulting in the formation of compound 5. This sequence of reactions explains the formation of the carbon skeleton of lipstatin. The 14- and 8-carbon modules can both be derived from U-13C-lipid or from unlabeled lipid. The Claisen condensation will use labeled and unlabeled fragments at random. Consequently, 13C-13C coupling is not observed between C-2 and C-3 of lipstatin. A possible scenario for the subsequent reaction steps is immediately obvious, but the details require further study. The hydroxy group of the 14-carbon module could be aminoacylated prior to or after the Claisen condensation. Reduction of the carbonyl group generated by the Claisen condensation should yield a hydroxy group, and the β-lactone ring of compound 7 could be formed with the CoA moiety as a leaving group. It should be noted that this biosynthetic pathway was observed in a medium containing large amounts of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Under these conditions, the 14-carbon moiety is entirely derived from the unsaturated fatty acid pool, as shown by the experiments with the hydrogenated U-13C-lipid mixture. Apparently, desaturation of fatty acid does not play a significant role under these culture conditions. The data also show that degradation products of the proffered lipid are diverted to the biosynthesis of leucine. The incorporation of two 13C pairs from the precursor mixture is well in line with the biosynthetic pathway of the amino acid, as summarized in Fig. 9. The biosynthesis of leucine involves the condensation of pyruvate and acetyl-CoA molecules. A mixture of 13C3-pyruvate and 13C2-acetyl-CoA with the respective unlabeled precursors should yield the observed labeling pattern, as shown in Fig. 9. Whereas the details have not been investigated, 13C3-pyruvate could be formed during the fermentation from the glycerol part of the U-13C-lipid mixture. This should be conducive to the observed isotope distribution. The use of a crude mixture of 13C-labeled precursors for biosynthetic studies is an unusual approach. As shown with the present example, it can yield results of optimum clarity under appropriate conditions. The crucial part of the present experiments is the use of a mixture of totally 13C-labeled lipids with a large excess of unlabeled lipids. In conjunction with modern one- and two-dimensional NMR technology, this approach can define the length of the biosynthetic building blocks with a minimum of experimental effort. This strategy is not limited to mixtures of lipids. Indeed, we have shown independently that it can also be used successfully using crude mixtures of 13C-labeled carbohydrates or amino acids. 3I.

https://openalex.org/W2055191397,"The endoribonuclease RNase E is believed to initiate the degradation of many mRNAs in Escherichia coli, yet the mechanism by which it recognizes cleavage sites is poorly understood. We have prepared derivatives of the mRNA encoding ribosomal protein S20 which contain a single major RNase E cleavage site at residues 300/301 preceded by variable 5′ extensions. Three of these RNAs are cleaved in vitro with significantly reduced efficiencies relative to the intact S20 mRNA by both crude RNase E and pure Rne protein (endonuclease component of RNase E). In all three substrates as well as in the full-length mRNA the major cleavage site itself remains single-stranded. One such substrate (t84D) contains a 5′ stem-loop structure characterized by three noncanonical A-G pairs. Removal or denaturation of the stem restores efficient cleavage at the major RNase E site. The other two contain single-stranded 5′-termini but apparently lack cleavage sites near the termini. Our data show that sensitivity to RNase E can be influenced by distant structural motifs in the RNA and also suggest a model in which the initial recognition and cleavage of a substrate near its 5′ end facilitates sequential cleavages at more distal sites. The model implies that RNase E contains at least a dimer of the Rne subunit and that the products of the first cleavage are retained by Rne prior to the second cleavage."
https://openalex.org/W2032000289,"Aflatoxin B1 is a potent environmental carcinogen produced by certain strains of Aspergillus. Central to the biosynthesis of this mycotoxin is the reaction catalyzed by versicolorin B synthase (VBS) in which a racemic substrate, versiconal hemiacetal, is cyclized to an optically active product whose absolute configuration is crucial to the interaction of aflatoxin B1 with DNA. Attempted over-production of VBS in Escherichia coli led principally to protein aggregated into inclusion bodies but also small amounts of soluble but catalytically inactive enzyme. Comparisons to wild-type VBS by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and after N-glycosidase F treatment revealed that extensive glycosylation accounted for the mass discrepancy (7,000 ±; 1,500 Da) between the native and bacterially expressed proteins. Several over-expression systems in Saccharomyces cerevisiae were surveyed in which one that incorporated a secretion signal was found most successful. VBS of indistinguishable mass on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and kinetic properties from the wild-type enzyme could be obtained in 50-100-fold greater amounts and whose catalytic behavior has been examined. The translated protein sequence of VBS showed three potential N-glycosylation sites (Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr) consistent with the modifications observed above and unexpectedly revealed extensive homology to the ADP-binding region prominently conserved in the glucose-methanol-choline (GMC) family of flavoenzymes. Over-production of VBS in yeast marks the first aflatoxin biosynthetic enzyme to be so obtained and opens the way to direct study of the enzymology of this complex biosynthetic pathway."

Incubation of Caco 2 human intestinal epithelial cells with the nucleoside analog 2-chloroadenosine (2ClAdo) resulted in a concentration- and time-dependent inhibition of toxin-induced cGMP production. Inhibition of cGMP production correlated with the metabolic conversion of 2ClAdo to 2-chloroadenosine triphosphate.

Green C.K. Yuen P.S.T. Garbers D.L. Cell. 1990; 63: 941-948Google Scholar, 11Vandrager A.B. van der Wiel E. Hom M.L. Luthjens L.H. de Jonge H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16409-16415Google Scholar). Cells were incubated in OPTI-MEM serum-free media (Life Technologies, Inc.) (0.5 ml/well) containing indicated concentrations of the test substances for the given period of time. Cells were washed three times with OPTI-MEM, then incubated in OPTI-MEM (0.2 ml/well) containing 0.12 mM isobutylmethylxanthine to inhibit endogenous phosphodiesterases for 10 min. STa was added to a final concentration of 0.5 μM for 10 min. Trichloroacetic acid (0.2 ml of 12% solution) was added to the wells to lyse the cells and terminate the reaction. Well contents were collected and centrifuged 15 min in a microcentrifuge to separate pellet and supernatant (8Parkinson S.J. Waldman S.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3213-3221Google Scholar). The supernatant was collected, the trichloroacetic acid was removed by ether extraction, and the sample was used for cGMP determination by radioimmunoassay (12Patrinellis A.C. Waldman S.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1243: 143-150Google Scholar). Pellets were saved for determination of protein content by the method of Bradford (Bio-Rad). Cells were treated in OPTI-MEM media containing test substances as described above. Wells were washed three times with a Tris buffer (50 mM, pH 7.5) containing 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (TED buffer) (8Parkinson S.J. Waldman S.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3213-3221Google Scholar, 9Parkinson S.J. Carrithers S.L. Waldman S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22683-22690Google Scholar). Cells were collected in TED and homogenized on ice. Homogenates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4†C. Membranes were resuspended in TED with a final concentration of approximately 1 mg of protein/ml. Membranes were incubated at 37†C for 5 min in 0.1 ml of a Tris buffer (50 mM, pH 7.5) containing 500 mM isobutylmethylxanthine, 7.5 mM creatine phosphate/20 mM creatine phosphokinase and either 10 mM MgGTP and 1 mM STa or 1 mM MnGTP. Enzyme reaction was terminated by addition of 0.5 ml NaAc (50 mM, pH 4.0) and boiling for 5 min. Cyclic GMP was quantified by radioimmunoassay as described previously (12Patrinellis A.C. Waldman S.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1243: 143-150Google Scholar). Following membrane preparation as described above, 30 μl of membrane were incubated in 50 mM Tris, pH 7.6, containing 1 mM EDTA, 150 mM KCl, 0.1% bacitracin, and 0.67 mM cystamine (binding buffer). Binding was initiated by the addition of 125I-labeled STa (10–13 to 5 × 10–8M) (13Deshmane S.P. Carrithers S.L. Parkinson S.J. Crupper S.S. Robertson D.C. Waldman S.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9095-9102Google Scholar). Reactions were incubated for 120 min at 37†C and terminated by filtration on Whatman GF/B glass fiber filters presoaked with 0.3% polyethyleneimine. Filters were washed three times with 5 ml of buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM phosphate (pH 7.2), and 1 mM EDTA at 4†C. Specific binding was determined by subtracting nonspecific binding (1000-fold excess of cold STa) from total binding. Assays were performed in quadruplicate. Analysis of ligand binding was performed using CIGALE, written by M. Bordes (Sophia Antipolis, France; 13Deshmane S.P. Carrithers S.L. Parkinson S.J. Crupper S.S. Robertson D.C. Waldman S.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9095-9102Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with [8-3H]2Cl-adenosine (2ClAdo; 1 μM) in OPTI-MEM, and uptake was terminated with unlabeled 2ClAdo (1 mM) at indicated times. Washed cells were lysed with 6% trichloroacetic acid, extracts were centrifuged to collect supernatants, and radioactivity in supernatants was quantified. Nonspecific values were determined from experiments where the addition of cold 2ClAdo preceded addition of [8-3H]-2ClAdo. These values were subtracted from totals to obtain specific values (10Belt J.A. Marina N.M. Phelps D.A. Crawford C.R. Adv. Enz. Reg. 1993; 33: 235-252Google Scholar). Pellets were used to determine protein content, and intracellular volumes were calculated using 3.66 μl/mg protein as reference (14Blais A. Bissonnette P. Berteloot A. J. Membr. Biol. 1987; 99: 113-125Google Scholar). In unpublished experiments, to determine cation dependence, a buffer composed of 120 mM Na+ or K+, 20 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 3 mM Na2HPO4 or K2HPO4, 1 mM MgCl2, and 1.8 mM CaCl2 was used. No significant difference in the rate of uptake could be observed using this buffer or OPTI-MEM. Because all of the other experiments used OPTI-MEM, uptake experiments were done using OPTI-MEM. Cells were incubated as described above with 1 mM 2ClAdo for the indicated times and extracted with trichloroacetic acid; resulting supernatants were chromatographed on a Waters 12.5 nm, 10 μm μBondpack 3.9 × 300-mm C18 column, preequilibrated with a mobile phase (buffer A) containing 10 mM tetrabutylammonium hydroxide, 10 mM KH2PO4, and 0.25% MeOH, pH 7.0 (15Di Pierro D. Tavazzi B. Perno C.F. Bartolini M. Balestra E. Calio R. Giardina B. Lazzarino G. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 231: 407-412Google Scholar). A step gradient was used with mobile phase buffer B (2.8 mM tetrabutylammonium hydroxide, 100 mM KH2PO4, and 30% MeOH, pH 5.5). The gradient was programmed as follows: 0-15 min, 100% buffer A; 20 min, 90% buffer A, 10% buffer B; 25 min, 70% buffer A, 30% buffer B; 40 min, 63% buffer A, 37% buffer B; 55 min, 55% buffer A, 45% buffer B; 75 min, 25% buffer A, 75% buffer B; 85 min, 0% buffer A, 100% buffer B for 10 min; at 125 min, 100% buffer A. Identification and quantification were achieved by comparing retention times of unknowns to standards. Intracellular nucleotide concentrations were calculated using the high-performance liquid chromatography-quantified molar amounts of nucleotide. The perforated mode of the whole-cell patch clamp recording, which limits dialysis of intracellular signaling molecules, was applied to Caco 2 cells (16Alekseev A.E. Markevich N.I. Korystova A.F. Terzic A. Kokoz Y.M. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 786-797Google Scholar, 17Alekseev A.E. Jovanovic A. Lopez J.R. Terzic A. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1996; 28: 1193-1202Google Scholar). Membrane potential was controlled through the electrical access obtained by membrane perforation induced by amphotericin B (240 μg/ml) in the localized area under the patch pipette (3-5 megaohms). The bath solution contained 136.5 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 0.53 mM MgCl2, 5.5 mM glucose, and 5.5 mM Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4. The pipette solution contained 140 mM K+-gluconate, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, and 5 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.3. Voltage clamp recordings were obtained using a patch-clamp amplifier (Axopatch 1-C, Axon Instruments), and data were acquired and analyzed using BioQuest software (17Alekseev A.E. Jovanovic A. Lopez J.R. Terzic A. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1996; 28: 1193-1202Google Scholar). Treatment of either Caco 2 cells natively expressing GCC or HEK293 cells heterologously expressing recombinant GCC with the nucleoside 2ClAdo, a metabolic precursor of 2ClATP, suppressed STa-induced cGMP accumulation (Fig. 1a). The effect of 2ClAdo was concentration (Ki = 101 ±; 21 μM; Fig. 1b)- and time-dependent (t1/2 of 10 h; Fig. 1c). The 2ClAdo effect appeared temporally biphasic, because inhibition of STa-induced cGMP accumulation was preceded by a transient increase in STa-induced cGMP accumulation at early (t ≤ 4 h) timepoints (Fig. 1c). Although the mechanisms underlying this initial transient rise in cGMP remain unclear, 2ClAdo is a potent ligand for adenosine receptors, and activation of other signaling mechanisms through these receptors could activate GCC (18Crane J.K. Wehner M.S. Bolen E.J. Sando J.J. Linden J. Guerrant R.L. Sears C.L. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 5004-5012Google Scholar). There was no significant difference in the number of cells or the amount of recovered protein in control or 2ClAdo-treated cells. Removal of 2ClAdo restored STa-dependent cGMP accumulation (t1/2 of 6 h; Fig. 1c, inset), suggesting that inhibition of cGMP synthesis did not reflect cell death. Adenosine analogs such as 2ClAdo are potent agonists for extracellular purinergic receptors. Furthermore, 2ClAdo is a low potency inhibitor of adenosine deaminase (19Simon L.N. Bauer R.J. Tolman R.L. Robins R.K. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 573-577Google Scholar), an enzyme that regulates intracellular nucleotide concentrations. However, the effects of 2ClAdo could not be mimicked by N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine, a purinergic P1 agonist with similar receptor potencies to 2ClAdo, nor by reversible (erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine) or irreversible (deoxycoformycin) adenosine deaminase inhibitors (Fig. 2a; 20Daly J.W. J. Med. Chem. 1982; 25: 197-207Google Scholar). These data suggest that 2ClAdo-dependent inhibition of GCC signaling does not reflect the potency of this nucleoside for purinergic receptors or competitive inhibition of adenosine deaminase. 125I-labeled STa bound to membranes prepared from Caco 2 cells incubated in the absence and presence of 2ClAdo in a concentration-dependent and saturable fashion. Scatchard analyses yielded curvilinear isotherms, suggesting the presence of high and low affinity ligand-binding sites in both 2ClAdo-treated and control cells (Fig. 2b). Equilibrium binding parameters derived from Scatchard analyses suggested that 2ClAdo treatment did not significantly alter the number or affinity of ligand receptors (Fig. 2b). Thus, in membranes from control and treated cells, respectively, the numbers of high affinity (Bmax, 2.1 ±; 1.3 versus 2.9 ±; 2.1 fmol/mg of protein) and low affinity (Bmax, 0.03 ±; 0.02 versus 0.08 ±; 0.05 pmol/mg of protein) binding sites were closely comparable. Similarly, the affinities of high (KD, 0.9 ±; 0.5 versus 6.5 ±; 6.1 pM) and low (KD, 1.3 ±; 1.1 versus 4.5 ±; 2.0 nM) affinity binding sites compared favorably in membranes from control and treated cells, respectively. Equilibrium binding parameters (values ±; S.E.) obtained in the present studies compare closely with those reported previously for high and low affinity STa binding sites (13Deshmane S.P. Carrithers S.L. Parkinson S.J. Crupper S.S. Robertson D.C. Waldman S.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9095-9102Google Scholar, 21Hugues M. Crane M. Hakki S. O'Hanley P. Waldman S.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10738-10745Google Scholar, 22Crane M. Hugues M. O'Hanley P. Waldman S.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 1073-1080Google Scholar, 23Hakki S. Robertson D.C. Waldman S.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1152: 1-8Google Scholar). Similarly, 2ClAdo neither decreased the number of 125I-labeled STa binding sites on the cell surface nor increased the rate of 125I-labeled STa internalization in intact cells (data not shown; 24Urbanski R.W. Carrithers S.L. Waldman S.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1245: 29-36Google Scholar). Therefore, inhibition of GCC signaling could not be attributed to alterations in distribution, sequestration, or ligand binding characteristics of the receptor. Caco 2 cells incorporated [8-3H]2ClAdo in a time-dependent fashion (Fig. 2c). Uptake of [8-3H]2ClAdo was not dependent on extracellular Na+, suggesting that intracellular accumulation was mediated by an equilibrative nucleoside transport mechanism (10Belt J.A. Marina N.M. Phelps D.A. Crawford C.R. Adv. Enz. Reg. 1993; 33: 235-252Google Scholar). Iodotubercidin, an adenosine kinase inhibitor, did not alter the initial rate of uptake but prevented further increases in intracellular [8-3H]2ClAdo (data not shown). These data suggest that cellular nucleoside accumulation was dependent on transport coupled to metabolic conversion to a phosphorylated product (10Belt J.A. Marina N.M. Phelps D.A. Crawford C.R. Adv. Enz. Reg. 1993; 33: 235-252Google Scholar, 20Daly J.W. J. Med. Chem. 1982; 25: 197-207Google Scholar). Although 2ClAdo inhibited STa-induced cGMP accumulation in intact cells, this nucleoside did not suppress the activity of GCC in intestinal cell membranes (Fig. 3a). However, membranes prepared from intact cells pretreated with 2ClAdo did exhibit persistent inhibition of GCC (Fig. 3b). These data further suggest that 2ClAdo undergoes intracellular metabolic conversion into the proximal allosteric inhibitor of GCC. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis of 2ClAdo-treated human intestinal cells revealed time-dependent accumulation of 2ClATP (Fig. 3c), which correlated closely with nucleoside inhibition of STa-induced cGMP accumulation. In contrast to 2ClAdo (Fig. 3a), 2ClATP directly inhibited the activity of GCC in intestinal cell membranes (Fig. 3c, inset). Iodotubercidin, a competitive inhibitor of phosphorylation of 2ClAdo by adenosine kinase, decreased the potency of 2ClAdo to inhibit STa-induced cGMP production (Fig. 3d; 20Daly J.W. J. Med. Chem. 1982; 25: 197-207Google Scholar). Thus, 2ClAdo inhibits STa-induced cGMP accumulation in intact cells following intracellular phosphorylation by adenosine kinase, ultimately to 2ClATP, an effective allosteric inhibitor of GCC (8Parkinson S.J. Waldman S.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3213-3221Google Scholar, 9Parkinson S.J. Carrithers S.L. Waldman S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22683-22690Google Scholar). To determine the consequence of disrupting cGMP accumulation with 2ClAdo on STa-induced postreceptor signals, alterations in chloride current were examined in human intestinal cells. In Caco 2 cells, STa induced an outward current (135 ±; 33 pA at a membrane potential of +10 mV, n = 4), which was suppressed by removal of extracellular chloride or by the addition of glyburide (Fig. 4a). The selectivity for Cl– outward rectification reversal potential at –70 mV and pharmacological properties (Fig. 4, a and a1) were all consistent with the presumed role of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in mediating STa-induced alterations in chloride conductance in intestinal cells (25Sheppard D.N. Welsh M.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 573-591Google Scholar, 26Chao A.C. de Sauvage F.J. Dong Y.J. Wagner J.A. Goeddel D.V. Gardner P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1065-1072Google Scholar, 27Forte L.R.

Chem. 1994; 269: 51-54Google Scholar). However, in Caco 2 cells treated with 2ClAdo, STa could no longer induce a chloride current (Fig. 4, b and c). Yet, in the same 2ClAdo-treated cells, 8-bromo cGMP, a membrane-permeant cGMP analog (6Hughes J.M. Murad F. Chang B. Guerrant R.L. Nature. 1978; 271: 755-756Google Scholar), produced an outward current that was abolished by removal of extracellular chloride (Fig. 4b). Thus, 2ClAdo treatment specifically blocked STa-dependent signaling by inhibiting GCC and accumulation of cGMP, rather than altering the ability of cGMP to generate chloride currents. The present studies establish an intracellular nucleotide-dependent pathway for inhibition of GCC signaling in intact human intestinal cells (Fig. 5). Uptake and phosphorylation of 2ClAdo results in accumulation of 2ClATP, which inhibits STa activation of guanylyl cyclase, accumulation of cGMP, and subsequent chloride fluxes mediating toxin-induced diarrhea. These data demonstrate that the components required for 2-substituted adenine nucleotide inhibition of GCC signaling are present in intact mammalian cells, establishing this pathway as a tool for elucidating the molecular mechanisms regulating GCC and intestinal fluid homeostasis. In addition, these data suggest that the adenine nucleotide inhibitory pathway may be a novel target for developing antisecretory therapy to treat enterotoxigenic diarrhea. We thank Drs.

Di Lauro R. Salvatore G. DeGroot L.J. Endocrinology. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA1995: 517-542Google Scholar). T3 and T4 are synthesized via the iodination and coupling of a small subset of tyrosyl residues within the polypeptide chains of Tg. The coupling reaction takes place by the transfer of an iodophenyl group from a donor 3-monoiodotyrosine or 3,5-diiodotyrosine to an acceptor 3,5-diiodotyrosine. This causes the formation of T3 or T4, respectively, at the acceptor site and dehydroalanine at the donor site (2Gavaret J.-M. Nunez J. Cahnmann H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5281-5285Google Scholar, 3Gavaret J.-M. Cahnmann H.J. Nunez J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9167-9173Google Scholar). Both reactions are catalyzed by thyroid peroxidase. Different tyrosyl residues have different reactivities toward iodine, so that iodination proceeds in a sequential order, which is controlled by the native structure of Tg (4Edelhoch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 2778-2787Google Scholar, 5Gavaret J.M. Dame D. Nunez J. Salvatore G. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 3281-3285Google Scholar). Early iodinated tyrosyl residues are preferentially involved in iodothyronine synthesis (6Lamas L. Taurog A. Salvatore G. Edelhoch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 2732-2737Google Scholar); the coupling of iodotyrosines, in turn, has stringent steric requirements (7Cahnmann H.J. Pommier J. Nunez J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5333-5335Google Scholar). In fact, out of 72 tyrosyl residues per bovine Tg monomer, only 15 are iodinated and a maximum of 6-8 of them undergo coupling to form T3 and T4 (8Ogawara H. Bilstad J.M. Cahnmann H.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 257: 339-349Google Scholar, 9Izumi M. Larsen P.R. J. Clin.

Kim P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17366-17371Google Scholar). Nevertheless, so far it has received little attention in the bovine and human species. Tyrosines reported as possible donor sites include Tyr-5, −926, −986 or −1008, −1375 (20Ohmiya Y. Hayashi H. Kondo T. Kondo Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9066-9071Google Scholar), −2469 and/or −2522 of bovine Tg (21Palumbo G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17182-17188Google Scholar), and Tyr-130 of human Tg (22Marriq C. Lejeune P.-J. Venot N. Vinet L. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1991; 81: 155-164Google Scholar).The main goal of this work was to establish whether Tyr-1291 of bovine Tg is also a site of T4 formation. To this purpose, a preparation of bovine Tg containing 1.05% iodine by mass was subjected to limited proteolysis with thermolysin and the products were separated by preparative SDS-PAGE. A thorough mass spectrometric analysis of a peptide spanning residues 1218-1591, together with an analysis of its iodine and iodoamino acid content, were performed. Post-translational modifications of three out of seven tyrosyl residues were documented at an unprecedented level of definition: in particular, we report the first direct evidence of the entire spectrum of modifications typical of a hormonogenic acceptor and a hormonogenic donor site at residues 1291 and 1375, respectively, of bovine Tg.DISCUSSIONWe report a detailed analysis of the post-translational modifications of seven tyrosyl residues comprised in fragment 1218-1591 of bovine thyroglobulin. In particular, we demonstrate the formation of MIT, DIT, T3, and T4 from Tyr-1291, and of MIT, DIT, and DHA from Tyr-1375. Modification of Tyr-1234 was restricted to formation of MIT, while Tyr-1450, −1464, −1484, and −1512 were unmodified.Mass spectrometry is widely employed for the analysis of post-translational modifications of proteins (32Burlingame A.L. Boyd R.K. Gaskell S.J. Anal. Chem. 1994; 66: 634R-683RGoogle Scholar). However, it has been used here for the first time to identify iodinated tyrosyl residues in Tg, and has proved extremely valuable as a source of primary structure data not available from earlier use of Edman degradation. In the past, the identification of hormonogenic sites by the sequencing of hormone-rich peptides of Tg was not always as direct. The only iodotyrosines and iodothyronines directly identified, by the manual method of sequencing with dimethylaminoazobenzeneisothiocyanate (35Chang J.Y. Brauer D. Wittman-Liebold B. FEBS Lett. 1978; 93: 205-214Google Scholar, 36Marriq C. Rolland M. Lissitzky S. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 116: 89-92Google Scholar), were those located at positions 2553, 2567, and 2746 of hog Tg (human Tg numbering) (17Marriq C. Rolland M. Lissitzky S. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 397-401Google Scholar, 19Marriq C. Rolland M. Lissitzky S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 112: 206-213Google Scholar), and 5 of human Tg (12Lejeune P.-J. Marriq C. Rolland M. Lissitzky S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 114: 73-80Google Scholar, 33Marriq C. Lejeune P.-J. Malthiery Y. Rolland M. Lissitzky S. FEBS Lett. 1984; 175: 140-146Google Scholar, 34Marriq C. Lejeune P.-J. Venot N. Rolland M. Lissitzky S. FEBS Lett. 1986; 207: 302-306Google Scholar). On the other hand, the phenylthiohydantoin-derivatives of iodoamino acids, in iodopeptides subjected to automated sequencing, were generally not identified by comparison with proper standards. The localization of hormonogenic sites in the NH2-terminal peptides of calf (13Rawitch A.B. Chernoff S.B. Litwer M.R. Rouse J.B. Hamilton J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2079-2082Google Scholar), sheep and hog Tg (14Rawitch A.B. Litwer M.R. Gregg J. Dziadik Turner C. Rouse J.B. Hamilton J.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 118: 423-429Google Scholar), in the tryptic peptides of rabbit (15Dunn J.T. Anderson P.C. Fox J.W. Fassler C.A. Dunn A.D. Hite L.A. Moore R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16948-16952Google Scholar) and guinea pig Tg labeled in vivo with 125I (16Fassler C.A. Dunn J.T. Anderson P.C. Fox J.W. Dunn A.D. Hite L.A. Moore R.C. Kim P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17366-17371Google Scholar), and in Tg from human goiters subjected to low-level iodination in vitro with 125I (18Lamas L. Anderson P.C. Fox J.W. Dunn J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13541-13545Google Scholar), was based on the monitoring of the contents of 127I or 125I in the automated sequencing cycles, and the determination of the distribution of iodoamino acids. In this regard, although 125I labeling provides an easy way to trace Tg iodopeptides and iodination sites and study hormonal turnover, it is not suited for the study of physiologically iodinated Tg of humans and other large animals.The identification of donor tyrosyl residues was also indirect in all cases reported so far. In one study of bovine Tg, in which the separation of dehydroalanine-containing peptides exploited the conversion of dehydroalanine to S-(4-aminophenyl)cysteine, the presence of the latter at positions 5, 926, 986 or 1008, and 1375 was inferred from the lack of known phenylthiohydantoin-derivatives in sequencing cycles where tyrosine was expected, and from differences between the actual and expected tyrosine content of the peptides (20Ohmiya Y. Hayashi H. Kondo T. Kondo Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9066-9071Google Scholar). In another study, the labeling of dehydroalanyl residues of bovine Tg with NaB3H4 and their conversion to labeled aspartic acid with Na14CN revealed a small labeled CNBr peptide containing possible donor Tyr-2469 and Tyr-2522, and a larger CNBr peptide, spanning residues 785-1551, possibly harboring other donor residues (21Palumbo G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17182-17188Google Scholar). Finally, the proposal that alanine recovered at position 130 of peptide 1-171 of human Tg derived, in fact, from the conversion of dehydroalanine was largely based on speculation (22Marriq C. Lejeune P.-J. Venot N. Vinet L. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1991; 81: 155-164Google Scholar).On the other hand, in the present study, mass spectrometry allowed the direct, unambiguous characterization of the entire spectrum of modifications of every tyrosyl residue within a large fragment of Tg. Not only the identification of T4 and T3 in correspondence of Tyr-1291 of bovine Tg is unprecedented, but also the localization of a donor site at position 1375 cannot be considered merely confirmatory, as it is based, for the first time, on a direct demonstration. By using the combination of limited proteolysis, preparative electrophoresis and mass spectrometry employed here, we project to extend our analysis to other still unsettled aspects of hormonogenesis in Tg, including: 1) the localization of the hormonogenic donor tyrosines of human Tg; 2) the identification of acceptor tyrosines other than tyrosine number 5 in physiologically iodinated human Tg; 3) the resolution of the uncertainties about donor sites at positions 986, 1008 (20Ohmiya Y. Hayashi H. Kondo T. Kondo Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9066-9071Google Scholar), 2469 and 2522 (21Palumbo G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17182-17188Google Scholar) of bovine Tg.The formation of T4 at a site corresponding to residue 1291 of bovine Tg was already reported in rabbit (15Dunn J.T. Anderson P.C. Fox J.W. Fassler C.A. Dunn A.D. Hite L.A. Moore R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16948-16952Google Scholar, 16Fassler C.A. Dunn J.T. Anderson P.C. Fox J.W. Dunn A.D. Hite L.A. Moore R.C. Kim P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17366-17371Google Scholar) and guinea pig Tg (16Fassler C.A. Dunn J.T. Anderson P.C. Fox J.W. Dunn A.D. Hite L.A. Moore R.C. Kim P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17366-17371Google Scholar), in which it contributed 17 and 11%, respectively, of Tg's T4. From the data reported in Table II, it appears that also in bovine Tg, Tyr-1291 contributed an appreciable amount of T4, together with a small amount of T3. It also appears that both Tyr-1291 and Tyr-1375 were to a large extent modified, mostly to DIT; however, only in one-fifth of the cases modification proceeded and iodothyronines were formed. On one hand, this probably reflects a high degree of accessibility of both residues. In this regard, the hydrophilicity plot of this region was not particularly informative (not shown); however, it is noteworthy that Tyr-1291 is located 70 residues apart from a cluster of protease-sensitive sites encompassing residues 1142, 1184, and 1218 (23Gentile F. Salvatore G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 603-621Google Scholar). On the other hand, the prevalence of iodotyrosines at these sites raises interesting questions concerning the factors of steric hindrance that may limit the efficiency of a hormonogenic site, and the structural requirements that must be satisfied for efficient coupling to occur. In rabbit and guinea pig Tg labeled in vivo with 125I, Tyr-1290 (human Tg numbering) contributed greatly to Tg's flexibility in meeting varying demands for hormone formation, as TSH enhanced T4 formation at residue 1290, at the expense of T4 formation at residue number 5, while increasing T3 formation at residue 2746 (16Fassler C.A. Dunn J.T. Anderson P.C. Fox J.W. Dunn A.D. Hite L.A. Moore R.C. Kim P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17366-17371Google Scholar). Under TSH stimulation, the percentage of T4 neo-synthesized at residue 1290 changed from 10 to 14% in rabbit and from 13 to 24% in guinea pig. In guinea pig, tyrosine 1290 was the most active site for new T4 formation even in the presence of basal TSH levels (16Fassler C.A. Dunn J.T. Anderson P.C. Fox J.W. Dunn A.D. Hite L.A. Moore R.C. Kim P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17366-17371Google Scholar). It is possible that also in bovine Tg the formation of T4 at Tyr-1291 increase under TSH stimulation, e.g. as a consequence of iodide shortage. In this regard, it would be interesting to measure the share of Tg's total T4 formed at Tyr-1291 at increasing levels of Tg iodination. On the other hand, in turtle Tg labeled in vivo with 125I, only 5% of T4 and 11% of T3 were newly formed at Tyr-1290 (human Tg numbering) (37Roe M.T. Anderson P.C. Dunn A.D. Dunn J.T. Endocrinology. 1989; 124: 1327-1332Google Scholar), while in human Tg iodinated in vitro with 7.8 atoms of iodine/Tg molecule, only traces of iodothyronines were found at residue 1290 (18Lamas L. Anderson P.C. Fox J.W. Dunn J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13541-13545Google Scholar). Only further work may establish whether this reflected the low level of Tg iodination, or the low efficiency of Tyr-1290 in human Tg. Interestingly, in human Tg, aspartic acid substitutes for tyrosine at position 1375. In addition, human Tyr-1447 was proposed to be a possible donor site, because it was iodinated early but did not provide inner iodothyronyl rings upon further iodination (18Lamas L. Anderson P.C. Fox J.W. Dunn J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13541-13545Google Scholar), whereas the corresponding Tyr-1450 of bovine Tg was unmodified in the present study. Although there is no indication that acceptor and donor residues need to be contiguous in the Tg sequence, the apparently low hormonogenic potential of human Tyr-1290 might indicate that, in bovine Tg, T4 formation at Tyr-1291 depends on the presence of donor Tyr-1375, whereas, in human Tg, Tyr-1447 is not as good a donor site.It was proposed that different hormonogenic sites of Tg evolved independently, and may also function independently from each other and the rest of the Tg molecule (38Musti A.M. Avvedimento E.V. Polistina C. Ursini V.M. Obici S. Nitsch L. Cocozza S. Di Lauro R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 323-327Google Scholar). Various observations support this hypothesis. Thyroid hormone formation within truncated NH2-terminal Tg fragments, derived from the abortive translation of normal-sized mRNAs, was probably responsible for the correction of hypothyroidism, by iodide supplementation, in a strain of Dutch goats with congenital goiter (39Sterk A. van Dijk J.E.

Efficient T4 formation was demonstrated in isolated fragment 1-171 of human Tg (22Marriq C. Lejeune P.-J. Venot N. Vinet L. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1991; 81: 155-164Google Scholar, 34Marriq C. Lejeune P.-J. Venot N. Rolland M. Lissitzky S. FEBS Lett. 1986; 207: 302-306Google Scholar). Thyroid hormones were also formed upon in vitro iodination of a fragment comprising the 224 COOH-terminal amino acids of rat Tg (45Asuncion M. Ingrassia R. Escribano J. Martin U. Mendez E. Di Lauro R. Lamas L. FEBS Lett. 1992; 297: 266-270Google Scholar). It would be interesting to test the ability of peptide b6TL, isolated from low-iodine bovine Tg, to sustain T4 (and T3) formation at Tyr-1291 upon peroxidase-catalyzed iodination in vitro. Should T4 be formed, peptide b6TL could represent an interesting model for the study of the minimal structural requirements of the hormonogenic function.

Di Lauro R. Salvatore G. DeGroot L.J. Endocrinology. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA1995: 517-542Google Scholar). T3 and T4 are synthesized via the iodination and coupling of a small subset of tyrosyl residues within the polypeptide chains of Tg. The coupling reaction takes place by the transfer of an iodophenyl group from a donor 3-monoiodotyrosine or 3,5-diiodotyrosine to an acceptor 3,5-diiodotyrosine. This causes the formation of T3 or T4, respectively, at the acceptor site and dehydroalanine at the donor site (2Gavaret J.-M. Nunez J. Cahnmann H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5281-5285Google Scholar, 3Gavaret J.-M. Cahnmann H.J. Nunez J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9167-9173Google Scholar). Both reactions are catalyzed by thyroid peroxidase. Different tyrosyl residues have different reactivities toward iodine, so that iodination proceeds in a sequential order, which is controlled by the native structure of Tg (4Edelhoch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 2778-2787Google Scholar, 5Gavaret J.M. Dame D. Nunez J. Salvatore G. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 3281-3285Google Scholar). Early iodinated tyrosyl residues are preferentially involved in iodothyronine synthesis (6Lamas L. Taurog A. Salvatore G. Edelhoch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 2732-2737Google Scholar); the coupling of iodotyrosines, in turn, has stringent steric requirements (7Cahnmann H.J. Pommier J. Nunez J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5333-5335Google Scholar). In fact, out of 72 tyrosyl residues per bovine Tg monomer, only 15 are iodinated and a maximum of 6-8 of them undergo coupling to form T3 and T4 (8Ogawara H. Bilstad J.M. Cahnmann H.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 257: 339-349Google Scholar, 9Izumi M. Larsen P.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1977; 59: 1105-1112Google Scholar).So far, four major hormonogenic tyrosines have been identified, by the isolation and sequencing of hormone-rich peptides from Tgs of various animal species and comparison of their sequences with the cDNA-deduced sequences of bovine (10Mercken L. Simons M.-J. Swillens S. Massaer M. Vassart G. Nature. 1985; 316: 647-651Google Scholar) and human Tg (11Malthiery Y. Lissitzky S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 165: 491-498Google Scholar). Tyr-5 was the most favored site for T4 formation in most species studied, including humans (12Lejeune P.-J. Marriq C. Rolland M. Lissitzky S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 114: 73-80Google Scholar), calf (13Rawitch A.B. Chernoff S.B. Litwer M.R. Rouse J.B. Hamilton J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2079-2082Google Scholar), sheep, hog (14Rawitch A.B.

Chem. 1989; 264: 13541-13545Google Scholar), Tyr-2553 (human Tg numbering) was the second most efficient T4-forming residue, whereas Tyr-2746 was a site of preferential synthesis of T3 (15Dunn J.T.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 112: 206-213Google Scholar). Another T4-forming site found in rabbit and guinea pig Tg corresponded to human Tyr-1290: in those species this site was third in ranking order of hormonogenic efficiency and its function was greatly enhanced by TSH (15Dunn J.T.

Kim P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17366-17371Google Scholar). Nevertheless, so far it has received little attention in the bovine and human species. Tyrosines reported as possible donor sites include Tyr-5, −926, −986 or −1008, −1375 (20Ohmiya Y. Hayashi H. Kondo T. Kondo Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9066-9071Google Scholar), −2469 and/or −2522 of bovine Tg (21Palumbo G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17182-17188Google Scholar), and Tyr-130 of human Tg (22Marriq C. Lejeune P.-J. Venot N. Vinet L. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1991; 81: 155-164Google Scholar).The main goal of this work was to establish whether Tyr-1291 of bovine Tg is also a site of T4 formation. To this purpose, a preparation of bovine Tg containing 1.05% iodine by mass was subjected to limited proteolysis with thermolysin and the products were separated by preparative SDS-PAGE. A thorough mass spectrometric analysis of a peptide spanning residues 1218-1591, together with an analysis of its iodine and iodoamino acid content, were performed. Post-translational modifications of three out of seven tyrosyl residues were documented at an unprecedented level of definition: in particular, we report the first direct evidence of the entire spectrum of modifications typical of a hormonogenic acceptor and a hormonogenic donor site at residues 1291 and 1375, respectively, of bovine Tg."
https://openalex.org/W2100818326,"Micronuclear linker histones of the ciliated protozoan, Tetrahymena thermophila, are extensively phosphorylated in vivo. Each of these polypeptides, α, β, γ, and δ, contains sites for phosphorylation by cyclic-AMP dependent protein kinase (PKA) but not Cdc2 kinase, and some data have been presented implicating PKA kinase in their phosphorylation in vitro and in vivo (Sweet, M. T., and Allis, C. D. (1993) Chromosoma 102, 637-647; Sweet, M. T., Jones, K., and Allis, C. D. (1996) J. Cell Biol., in press). In this report we have extended these analyses by showing that Cdc2 and PKA kinase are not evenly distributed between micro- and macronuclei. Macronuclei, but not micronuclei, contain a 36-kDa polypeptide that is immunoreactive with p34Cdc2 antibodies. In contrast, a 40-kDa polypeptide is detected with PKA antibodies in micronuclei, that is not detected in macronuclei. In support, extracts from micronuclei, but not macronuclei, contain a kinase activity that resembles some, but not all, characteristics of PKA from other sources. Immunodepletion experiments using anti-PKA antibodies show that a 40-kDa polypeptide can be specifically removed from these extracts with a concomitant loss in kinase activity. Microsequence analyses of δ demonstrate that this linker histone is phosphorylated in vivo on two PKA consensus sequences located in its carboxyl-terminal domain, an optimum PKA consensus sequence, Arg-Lys-Asn-Ser, and a less optimal PKA sequence, Lys-Ser-Ser-Val. Collectively, these results suggest that PKA or a PKA-like kinase is responsible for the phosphorylation of linker histone in mitotically dividing micronuclei. In contrast, macronuclei, which divide amitotically, phosphorylate linker histone H1 using a distinct, Cdc2-like kinase.

In contrast, macronuclei, which divide amitotically, phosphorylate linker histone H1 using a distinct, Cdc2-like kinase. A variety of kinases and phosphatases have been shown to play an implicit role in the regulation of fundamental cell cycle processes. For example, a family of closely related cyclin-dependent protein kinases is thought to catalyze a series of phosphorylation events associated with cell-cycle progression (for reviews see 3Norbury C.

Tamakita Y. Hosoya H. Matsumura I. Nature. 1991; 349: 169-172Google Scholar) undergo stage-specific, reversible phosphorylation. The biological consequences of these phosphorylation events are largely unclear. It has long been suggested that hyperphosphorylation of the linker histone H1 during mitosis is causally linked to mitotic chromosome condensation (reviewed in 8Bradbury E.M. Bioessays. 1992; 14: 9-16Google Scholar), although this relationship remains unproven and controversial (discussed in 12Guo X.W. Th'ng J.P. Swank R.A. Anderson H.J. Tudan C. Bradbury E.M. Roberge M.

It has also been proposed that phosphorylation of linker histone may act as a first-step mechanism to promote transient decondensation of the chromatin fiber, allowing access of specific factors (such as the SMC family of nonhistone proteins; reviewed in 13Koshland D. Strunnikov A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 305-333Google Scholar and 14Hirano T. Trends Biochem.

Mounting evidence has shown that chromosome condensation can occur in the absence of H1 or H1 phosphorylation in vitro (16Ohsumi K. Katagiri C. Kishimoto T.

Weir J.W. Gorovsky M.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 47-56Google Scholar). The ciliated protozoan, Tetrahymena thermophila, provides an ideal model for unraveling complex relationships between H1 phosphorylation, gene expression, and mitotic chromosome condensation. Each vegetative cell contains two types of nuclei, a somatic macronucleus that divides amitotically and a germ-line micronucleus that divides mitotically. Both nuclei contain linker-associated polypeptides that differ dramatically. Macronuclei, for example, contain a H1 that resembles vertebrate H1s in several properties including growth or division-associated phosphorylation by a Cdc2-like kinase (20Roth S.Y. Collini M.P. Draetta G. Beach D. Allis C.D. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2069-2075Google Scholar). In contrast, micronuclei contains four distinct polypeptides (α, β, γ, and δ) that are also phosphorylated in growing or dividing cells (21Allis C.D. Gorovsky M.A. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 3828-3833Google Scholar). If Cdc2 kinase is solely responsible for linker histone phosphorylation and mitotic chromosome condensation in Tetrahymena, α, β, γ, and δ would be expected to be phosphorylated by this enzyme. However, α, β, γ, and δ do not contain any obvious recognition sequence for Cdc2 kinase (22Wu M. Allis C.D. Sweet M.T. Cook R.G. Gorovsky M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 14: 10-20Google Scholar), and none of these polypeptides are phosphorylated by this kinase in vitro under conditions where macronuclear H1 is extensively phosphorylated (1Sweet M.T. Allis C.D. Chromosoma. 1993; 102: 637-647Google Scholar). Interestingly, all four of these polypeptides contain at least one canonical phosphorylation site for cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) 1The abbreviations used are: PKAcAMP-dependent protein kinaseHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyRP-HPLCreverse phase-HPLCMOPS3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acidNBSN-bromosuccinimidePKIPKA inhibitor.

In this study, we have continued to explore the relationship between PKA and linker histone phosphorylation in mitotic micronuclei in Tetrahymena with emphasis on δ. Immunoblotting data support the notion that PKA (or a PKA-like activity) exists in micronuclei during most stages of the life of the cell, and antibodies against PKA can immunodeplete δ kinase activity from micronuclear extracts. Microsequence analyses confirm that δ is phosphorylated in vivo on two serine residues embedded in the carboxyl terminus; both sites conform to PKA recognition sites. Collectively, these results suggest that a PKA or a PKA-like kinase is responsible for phosphorylation of δ in micronuclei and support the general hypothesis that PKA kinase(s) play an important, and previously unsuspected, role in mitosis. T. thermophila strains CU428 (Chx/Chx-[cy-S]VII) and CU427 (Mpr/Mpr [6 mp-s VI]) were grown in 1% enriched protease peptone under standard conditions as described previously (23Gorovsky M.A. Yao M.-C. Keevert J.B. Pleger G.L. Methods Cell Biol. 1975; 9: 311-327Google Scholar). Previous data had shown that δ phosphorylation was maximal in early mating cell cultures, 2-4 h after initiating mating (2Sweet M.T. Jones K. Allis C.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1219-1228Google Scholar). Therefore, 2.5-h mating cultures were utilized in this study. Conjugation was induced according to Bruns and Brussard (24Bruns P.J. Brussard T.B. J. Exp. Zool. 1974; 183: 334-337Google Scholar) with modifications described by Allis and Dennison (25Allis C.D. Dennison D.K. Dev. Biol. 1982; 93: 519-533Google Scholar). Mating cultures were phosphorylated in vivo by starving cells of each mating type separately at approximately 1-2 × 105 cells/ml in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, in the presence of [32P]orthophosphate (12.5 mCi/ml) for 2-3 h before adding 2 × growth medium and growing cultures for at least one generation (2-5 × 105 cells/ml). Labeled cells were then starved and mated as described above. Macronuclei and micronuclei were isolated from cells as described by Gorovsky et al. (23Gorovsky M.A. Yao M.-C. Keevert J.B. Pleger G.L. Methods Cell Biol. 1975; 9: 311-327Google Scholar), except that the nucleus isolation buffer contained 1 mM iodoacetamide, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mM sodium butyrate, but not spermidine. Where indicated, purified preparations of micro- and macronuclei were isolated following sedimentation at unit gravity according to Allis and Dennison (25Allis C.D. Dennison D.K. Dev. Biol. 1982; 93: 519-533Google Scholar). In order to better preserve labile phosphorylation modifications, chloromercuriphenylsulfonic acid (final concentration 0.1 mM) was added to the cell homogenization buffer. δ was partially purified from sulfuric acid extracts of micronuclei by reverse phase (RP)-HPLC using a C8 column (Brownlee) with a linear gradient of 5-90% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (changing at a rate of 0.45%/min) with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Macro- and micronuclei from log-phase growing cells were used to prepare active kinase extracts immediately following isolation. Nuclei were washed once in isolation buffer and then resuspended (at 5 × 107 macronuclei/ml and 1 × 109 micronuclei/ml) in 10 × phosphorylation buffer (1 M NaCl, 250 mM MOPS, pH 7.4, 100 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40). Nuclei were lysed in this buffer for 10 min before a 9-fold volume of cold water was added; the lysate was then vortexed well and then microcentrifuged for 15 min. The clarified supernatant was removed and used immediately or frozen at −20°C. Extracts prepared in this fashion remained active for kinase activity for up to 1 week at −20°C. Enzymes, HeLa Cdc2 kinase, bovine or Paramecium PKA kinase, or crude Tetrahymena micronuclear extracts (extract from approximately 1 × 107 micronuclei/reaction) were added to each reaction immediately prior to the addition of [γ-32P]ATP (100-150 units; 1 unit transfers 1 pmol of Pi/min), as described previously (1Sweet M.T. Allis C.D. Chromosoma. 1993; 102: 637-647Google Scholar). Incubations proceeded at 30°C for 15 min, and duplicate samples from each reaction were removed, applied to P81 filter paper (Whatman International, Maidstone, United Kingdom), and processed for liquid scintillation counting (26Roskoski R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 3-6Google Scholar). Ten microliters of micronuclear extract was incubated with 5 μl of either preimmune serum or immune serum for 2 h with gentle shaking at 4°C. As a negative control, immune serum was added to buffer without nuclear extract. Protein A-Sepharose (15 μl) was added to each mixture and the incubation was continued at 4°C for 1 h more. Following centrifugation, the unbound supernatant was removed from each incubation mixture, and 5 μl was analyzed in in vitro kinase reactions with and without δ as substrate. Immunoblotting analysis was done on an aliquot of the immunoprecipitation supernatant. Protein bound to the Sepharose beads was also analyzed in this fashion after solubilization with Laemmli sample buffer. RP-HPLC-purified δ dissolved in 180 ml of 5% acetic acid was cleaved by adding 20 ml of 20 mM N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) freshly dissolved in 5% acetic acid and incubating 2 h at room temperature in the dark (27Alfagaeme C.R. Rudkin G.T. Cohen L.H. Chromosoma. 1980; 78: 1-31Google Scholar). The resultant peptides were purified by RP-HPLC using a C18 column with a 0-90% acetonitrile linear gradient as described above. The single in vivo phosphorylated NBS fragment from δ, which eluted at approximately 8% acetonitrile, was identified by scintillation counting and gel analysis on 50% acid-urea gels (see below). In vivo phosphorylated NBS peptide from δ, isolated as described above, or in vitro phosphorylated δ or a synthetic δ peptide was cleaved by mixing endoproteinase Lys-C (Boehringer Mannheim) with peptide at 1:100 (w/w) in 0.1 M ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.0, and incubating at 37°C for 1-2 h. A second equal aliquot of enzyme was then added to the reaction mixture and incubation continued overnight (28Jekel P. Weijer W. Beintema J. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 134: 347-354Google Scholar). Where indicated, peptides were purified by cation-exchange HPLC using a polyCAT A column (PolyLC Inc.) with a 0-0.3 M NaClO4 linear gradient (in a 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.5) increasing at a rate of 0.03 M NaClO4/min. Peptides were also purified by elution with water from acid-urea 50% polyacrylamide gels (29West M.H.P. Wu R.S. Bonner W.M. Electrophoresis. 1984; 5: 133-138Google Scholar) as described previously (30Dadd C.A. Cook R.G. Allis C.D. Biotechniques. 1993; 14: 266-273Google Scholar). Due to the small size and positive charge of several of the δ peptides analyzed in this study, carboxymethylcellulose membrane was chosen for best retention of peptides (31Alimi E. Arlette M. Sautiere P. Chevaillier P. Biotechniques. 1993; 15: 912-917Google Scholar). Peptides were eluted from carboxymethylcellulose membranes for sequencing, as described previously (31Alimi E. Arlette M. Sautiere P. Chevaillier P. Biotechniques. 1993; 15: 912-917Google Scholar). Small peptides were also analyzed by thin layer chromatography (TLC) using a phospho-chromatography buffer (37% n-butanol, 25% pyridine, and 7% glacial acetic acid) as described by Boyle et al. (32Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Google Scholar). Peptides used in this study (see Fig. 2 for details) were synthesized by the solid phase procedure on a peptide synthesizer (model 430A; Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA). Peptides were cleaved from the resin and analyzed by RP-HPLC, amino acid analysis (Pico Tag system; Waters Associates, Milford, MA). Amino acid sequence analysis (model 477A protein sequencing system; Applied Biosystems Inc.) was used to confirm the sequence of peptides and to identify sites of serine phosphorylation on purified peptides. One-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis systems have been described previously (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar, 34Allis C.D. Glover C.D.C. Gorovsky M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4857-4861Google Scholar). Acid-urea acrylamide gel electrophoresis of small peptides has also been described previously (29West M.H.P. Wu R.S. Bonner W.M. Electrophoresis. 1984; 5: 133-138Google Scholar). Immunoblot analyses of SDS-polyacrylamide gels were done as described previously (35Lin R. Leone J.W. Cook R.G. Allis C.D. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1577-1588Google Scholar). Balanced protein loads of samples were ensured by staining parallel gels of equivalently loaded samples and by staining immunoblots directly with Ponceau red stain. Immunoreactivity was detected by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies or by chemiluminesence and autoradiography as indicated. Polyclonal antiserum against the catalytic subunit of PKA was prepared as described (36Carlson G. Cyclic AMP-dependent Protein Kinases of Paramecium tetraurelia: Subunit Structures and Substrate Recognition. Ph.D. thesis, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI1994Google Scholar). Antibodies against yeast p34cdc2 were a generous gift from the Beach laboratory. The unique partitioning of mitosis-related events to micronuclei along with a specialized set of linker-associated polypeptides, α, β, γ, and δ, raises the question which kinase is responsible for their phosphorylation in vivo. If, as suggested by our earlier studies (1Sweet M.T. Allis C.D. Chromosoma. 1993; 102: 637-647Google Scholar), PKA or a PKA-like activity is responsible for micronuclear linker histone phosphorylation, we reasoned that the catalytic subunit of this kinase should be present in micronuclei. When an antibody raised against the catalytic subunit of PKA from Paramecium is used to probe a blot of total nuclear protein from extensively purified micro- and macronuclei, a single, strongly immunoreactive band with an apparent molecular mass of 40 kDa is observed in lanes containing micronuclear protein (Fig. 1A). Unexpectedly, at all stages of the life cycle examined (growing, starved, and 2 h mating), macronuclei contain little or no detectable PKA catalytic subunit. Opposite results are obtained when identical samples are probed with antibodies raised against yeast recombinant p34cdc2 (Fig. 1B). In agreement with our previous studies (20Roth S.Y. Collini M.P. Draetta G. Beach D. Allis C.D. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2069-2075Google Scholar), a 36-kDa polypeptide is detected in macronuclear samples when probed with an antibody-generated yeast p34cdc2. Surprisingly, this polypeptide is not detected in micronuclei isolated from the same cells. Thus, macronuclei and micronuclei are distinguished not only by distinct, non-overlapping linker histones, but also by the kinases that might be responsible for phosphorylating them. Previous experiments suggested that δ, the smallest of the micronuclear linker polypeptides, was phosphorylated in vivo on at least one serine located in the carboxyl-terminal third of the protein (1Sweet M.T. Allis C.D. Chromosoma. 1993; 102: 637-647Google Scholar). It was suggested that PKA or a PKA-like kinase was responsible for this phosphorylation since the catalytic subunit of bovine PKA also phosphorylated the same CNBr-generated peptide in vitro. As shown in Fig. 2A, three putative sites for PKA phosphorylation are contained in the carboxyl terminus of δ. Two serines matching the most stringent PKA consensus sequence (Arg-Arg/Lys-Xxx-Ser, underlined) are shown as black boxes; one serine contained within a less stringent consensus sequence (Arg-Xxx-Xxx-Ser) is indicated as an open box. These two classes of PKA consensus motifs are utilized in the majority of the PKA target sequences (37Kennelly P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15555-15558Google Scholar). In order to determine whether macro- or micronuclei contain kinase activities capable of phosphorylating PKA or Cdc2 substrates, a salt extract was prepared from each type of nuclei and tested with either of two contrasting peptides. One peptide, containing the three putative PKA sites described above, was synthesized for use as a model PKA substrate (δ peptide, Fig. 2A); a second peptide, containing two consensus sequences for Cdc2 kinase from macronuclear H1 (H1 peptide, Fig. 2B), was synthesized for use as a model Cdc2 substrate. In vitro phosphorylation with macro- and micronuclear extracts and purified bovine catalytic PKA are shown in Fig. 3. Significant incorporation of [32P]phosphate is observed when the synthetic δ peptide is used as a substrate with either crude micronuclear extract or purified bovine catalytic PKA subunit. In contrast, the synthetic H1 peptide is not a good substrate for either of these kinase reactions, although this peptide is an excellent substrate with purified preparations of human Cdc2 kinase (data not shown). This result is consistent with our inability to detect p34cdc2 in micronuclei (Fig. 1B). To determine if the PKA activities assayed in Fig. 3 display properties characteristic of PKA in higher organisms, parallel studies were repeated in the presence of the well known, competitive inhibitor of mammalian PKAs (PKI; 38Walsh D.A. Ashby C.D. Gonzalez C. Calkins D. Fischer E.H. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 1977-1985Google Scholar). Unlike bovine PKA, which is clearly inhibited by this peptide, neither purified Paramecium (39Mason P.A. Nelson D.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1010: 116-121Google Scholar) nor crude Tetrahymena PKA activity is inhibited by 5 mM PKI (Fig. 3). These data suggest that ciliate PKAs as well as PKAs from other sources (40Veron M. Mutzel R. Lacombe M.-L. Simon M.-N. Wallet V. Dev. Genet. 1988; 9: 247-258Google Scholar) differ significantly from PKA in higher organisms. Another hallmark of PKA is its dependence on cAMP. While cAMP reproducibly increases the kinase activity of the crude micronuclear extract by about 20%, it does not show a significant requirement for cAMP. The significance of this result is not clear, but may be due to the high salt extraction conditions used to prepare the extract. Antibodies against the Paramecium catalytic subunit were used to precipitate PKA from crude micronuclear extracts (Fig. 4A). A 40-kDa polypeptide is precipitated with the anti-PKA (lane 2), but this peptide is not precipitated with preimmune serum (lane 1) or when extract is not added to the immune reaction (lane 3). Supernatants from these precipitation were then assayed for kinase activity as described above. Preimmune sera has little effect on the kinase activity of the supernatant, while the supernatant from the immune reaction shows an 80% decrease in kinase activity (Fig. 4B). These immunodepletion data are consistent with the suggestion that PKA or a PKA-like kinase is responsible for δ phosphorylation in micronuclei. The amino acid sequence of the carboxyl terminus of δ suggests that there are three potential phosphorylation sites that could be utilized by PKA. Shown in Fig. 5 (top) are the expected peptides resulting from a limit digestion of synthetic δ peptide with lysine-specific (Lys-C) endoproteinase. If δ is phosphorylated by PKA using optimal PKA recognition motifs, we predicted that two 32P-labeled peptides would be produced following Lys-C endoproteinase digestion, one with a single labeled serine, Asn-Ser-Thr-Ser-Lys, and a second with two potential phosphoserines, Arg-Arg-Ser-Ser-Lys (see the serines in black and white boxes in Fig. 5). To test this prediction, synthetic δ peptide was phosphorylated in vitro by bovine PKA catalytic subunit or the crude Tetrahymena micronuclear extract and subjected to a limit digestion with Lys-C endoproteinase. In addition, RP-HPLC-purified δ was phosphorylated in vitro and digested under identical conditions. Phosphopeptides resulting from these digestion were then resolved on a long (30 cm) 50% acid-urea acrylamide gel and identified by autoradiography (Fig. 5). Regardless of the source of PKA, micronuclear extracts or purified PKA from Paramecium (data not shown) or bovine heart, the phosphopeptide maps produced are essentially identical when assayed in this fashion. In addition, these kinases produce identical phosphopeptide maps when either synthetic δ peptide (Fig. 5, lanes 2 and 3) or intact δ (data not shown) are used as in vitro substrates. A comparison of in vivo versus in vitro phosphorylated peptides was then performed to determine whether in vitro phosphorylation of δ peptide produces a similar map as δ phosphorylated in vivo. δ, labeled in vivo with [32P]orthophosphate, was recovered by RP-HPLC and cleaved with Lys-C endoproteinase. Digestion products were then analyzed as above. These results demonstrate that the in vivo phosphopeptide map of δ (Fig. 5, lane 1) is comparable with, but not identical to, that of δ phosphorylated in vitro. Interestingly, not all of the peptides are phosphorylated to the same extent. In all cases tested, in vitro and in vivo, peptide c is labeled to the greatest extent. Peptide a (variable in different digests, see below) is phosphorylated to a lesser extent, while peptide(s) b, which resolve to varying extents, is typically poorly phosphorylated. To confirm that each of the above peptides with similar acid-urea polyacrylamide gel mobilities are indeed identical peptides, the bands were excised from the gel and analyzed by thin layer chromatography. In all cases phosphopeptides with the same electrophoretic mobility on the acid-urea gel had the same mobility on the thin layer chromatography plates, and those with different electrophoretic mobilities also differed in chromatographic mobility (data not shown). Phosphorylated isoforms of linker histones migrate with a reduced mobility on SDS gels (for example, see 41Lu M.J. Dadd C.A. Mizzen C.A. Perry C.A. McLachlan D.R. Annunziato A.T. Allis C.D. Chromosoma. 1994; 103: 111-121Google Scholar). Previous experiments suggested that, like macronuclear H1, the mobility of δ on an SDS gel is reduced by phosphorylation and that δ is maximally phosphorylated during early stages of the sexual pathway, conjugation (2Sweet M.T. Jones K. Allis C.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1219-1228Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6A, three distinct bands of δ are well resolved when HPLC-purified δ from 2.5-h mating cells is analyzed in long SDS gels by staining and autoradiography. Densitometric analysis of the stained bands and corresponding autoradiogram indicate that the relative specific activity of the slowest migrating band (labeled S) was approximately twice that of the intermediate mobility band (M) (data not shown), suggesting that δ is phosphorylated at two distinct sites during this stage of the life cycle (see below). In contrast, the fastest band (F) is not phosphorylated and most likely represents the dephosphorylated isoform of δ. In order to determine if phosphorylation of δ occurs in a random or ordered fashion, the labeled bands resolved in Fig. 6A were excised and the individual isoforms extracted. Each band was then separately cleaved with Lys-C endoproteinase, and the digestion products were resolved in a high resolution acid-urea gel. The resulting phosphopeptide map clearly documents a non-random pattern of phosphorylation site utilization in the δ isoforms resolved by SDS-gel electrophoresis. Consistent with the idea that the band labeled M is a monophosphorylated isoform of δ, a single labeled phosphopeptide is observed after Lys-C digestion of isoform M (Fig. 6B, peptide c). In contrast, the slowest migrating species (band S), a putative diphosphorylated isoform of δ, produces two labeled peptides (b and c) with similar relative mobility to the peptides labeled b and c in Fig. 5. To rigorously determine the phosphorylation sites utilized in δ, δ, labeled in vivo with [32P]orthophosphate, was cleaved with NBS (see Fig. 7A) and the resultant single phosphopeptide was purified by RP-HPLC. Direct microsequence analysis verified that this peptide was indeed the indicated carboxyl-terminal portion of δ (the length of the arrow in Fig. 7A corresponds to the amino acid sequence obtained). During each cycle of microsequencing, an aliquot of each cleaved phenylthiohydantoin-derivative was collected and the presence of 32P was directly determined by scintillation counting. As anticipated, the first indicated serine, contained within the optimal PKA consensus sequence Arg-Lys-Asn-Ser, is phosphorylated, yielding counts twice that of background (see Fig. 7B). Although sequencing progressed through the second indicated PKA consensus sequence, no additional site of phosphorylation could be detected in this approach. A second approach utilized peptides generated from Lys-C endoproteinase digestion of in vivo phosphorylated δ, which were resolved by electrophoresis on acid-urea gels shown previously. Resulting phosphopeptides (labeled a, b, and c in Fig. 5, Fig. 6) were excised from the gel using the autoradiogram as a template, eluted with water, and bound directly to carboxymethylcellulose membrane for sequencing (31Alimi E. Arlette M. Sautiere P. Chevaillier P. Biotechniques. 1993; 15: 912-917Google Scholar). Phosphopeptide a was identified as A"
https://openalex.org/W2028423657,"A heparin cofactor II (HCII) mutant with an Arg substituted for Leu444 at the P1 position (L444R-rHCII) was previously found to have altered proteinase specificity (Derechin, V. M., Blinder, M. A., and Tollefsen, D. M. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 5623-5628). The present study characterizes the effect of glycosaminoglycans on the substrate versus inhibitor activity of L444R-rHCII. Heparin increased the stoichiometry of inhibition of L444R-rHCII with α-thrombin (compared with minus glycosaminoglycan) but decreased it with R93A,R97A,R101A-thrombin, a mutant thrombin that does not bind glycosaminoglycans. Dermatan sulfate decreased the stoichiometry of inhibition of L444R-rHCII with both proteinases. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed no proteolysis of L444R-rHCII when incubated with R93A,R97A,R101A-thrombin in the absence or the presence of glycosaminoglycan or with α-thrombin and dermatan sulfate. In contrast, greater than 75% of the L444R-rHCII was converted to a lower molecular weight form when incubated with α-thrombin/heparin. A time course of α-thrombin inhibition by L444R-rHCII/heparin showed a rapid but transient inhibition with approximately 80% of the α-thrombin activity being regained after 6 h of incubation. In contrast, all other combinations of inhibitor, proteinase, and glycosaminoglycan resulted in complete and sustained inhibition of the proteinase. Heparin fragments of 8-20 polysaccharides in length rapidly accelerated L444R-rHCII inhibition of both α-thrombin and R93A,R97A,R101A-thrombin. After extended incubations, R93A,R97A,R101A-thrombin was completely inhibited by L444R-rHCII with all the heparin fragments, but approximately 30-50% of α-thrombin activity remained with fragments long enough to bridge HCII-thrombin. These results collectively indicate that ternary complex formation, mediated by heparin, increases L444R-rHCII inactivation by α-thrombin. A heparin cofactor II (HCII) mutant with an Arg substituted for Leu444 at the P1 position (L444R-rHCII) was previously found to have altered proteinase specificity (Derechin, V. M., Blinder, M. A., and Tollefsen, D. M. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 5623-5628). The present study characterizes the effect of glycosaminoglycans on the substrate versus inhibitor activity of L444R-rHCII. Heparin increased the stoichiometry of inhibition of L444R-rHCII with α-thrombin (compared with minus glycosaminoglycan) but decreased it with R93A,R97A,R101A-thrombin, a mutant thrombin that does not bind glycosaminoglycans. Dermatan sulfate decreased the stoichiometry of inhibition of L444R-rHCII with both proteinases. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed no proteolysis of L444R-rHCII when incubated with R93A,R97A,R101A-thrombin in the absence or the presence of glycosaminoglycan or with α-thrombin and dermatan sulfate. In contrast, greater than 75% of the L444R-rHCII was converted to a lower molecular weight form when incubated with α-thrombin/heparin. A time course of α-thrombin inhibition by L444R-rHCII/heparin showed a rapid but transient inhibition with approximately 80% of the α-thrombin activity being regained after 6 h of incubation. In contrast, all other combinations of inhibitor, proteinase, and glycosaminoglycan resulted in complete and sustained inhibition of the proteinase. Heparin fragments of 8-20 polysaccharides in length rapidly accelerated L444R-rHCII inhibition of both α-thrombin and R93A,R97A,R101A-thrombin. After extended incubations, R93A,R97A,R101A-thrombin was completely inhibited by L444R-rHCII with all the heparin fragments, but approximately 30-50% of α-thrombin activity remained with fragments long enough to bridge HCII-thrombin. These results collectively indicate that ternary complex formation, mediated by heparin, increases L444R-rHCII inactivation by α-thrombin."

MHC-PKC undergoes autophosphorylation with each mole of kinase incorporating about 20 mol of phosphate. The MHC-PKC autophosphorylation sites are thought to be located within a domain at the COOH-terminal region of MHC-PKC that contains a cluster of 21 serine and threonine residues. Here we report that deletion of this domain abolished the ability of the enzyme to undergo autophosphorylation in vitro. Furthermore, after this deletion, cAMP-dependent autophosphorylation of MHC-PKC as well as cAMP-dependent increases in kinase activity and subcellular localization were also abolished. These results provide evidence for the role of autophosphorylation in the regulation of MHC-PKC and indicate that this MHC-PKC autophosphorylation is required for the kinase activation in response to cAMP and for subcellular localization.

We have previously reported the isolation of a MHC 1The abbreviations used are: MHCmyosin II heavy chainPKCprotein kinase CMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisSTserine-threonine. -specific PKC (MHC-PKC) from the ameba, Dictyostelium that phosphorylates Dictyostelium MHC specifically and is homologous to α, β, and γ subtypes of mammalian PKC (1Ravid S. Spudich J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15144-15150Google Scholar, 2Ravid S. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5877-5881Google Scholar). In vitro phosphorylation of MHC by MHC-PKC results in inhibition of myosin II thick filament formation (1Ravid S. Spudich J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15144-15150Google Scholar) by inducing the formation of a bent monomer of myosin II, whose assembly domain is tied up in an intramolecular interaction that precludes the intermolecular interaction necessary for thick filament formation (3Pasternak C. Flicker P.F. Ravid S. Spudich J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 203-210Google Scholar). myosin II heavy chain protein kinase C 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis serine-threonine. The MHC-PKC which is expressed during Dictyostelium development has been implicated in the increase in MHC phosphorylation observed in response to cAMP stimulation (1Ravid S. Spudich J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15144-15150Google Scholar). We have recently found that elimination of MHC-PKC abolishes this cAMP-induced MHC phosphorylation, indicating that MHC-PKC is the enzyme which phosphorylates MHC in response to cAMP stimulation (4Abu-Elneel K. Karchi M. Ravid S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 977-984Google Scholar). MHC-PKC null cells exhibit a substantial myosin II overassembly in vivo, as well as aberrant cell polarization, chemotaxis, and morphological differentiation. Cells that overexpress MHC-PKC contain highly phosphorylated MHC. They show no apparent cell polarization and chemotaxis, and exhibit impaired myosin II localization (4Abu-Elneel K. Karchi M. Ravid S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 977-984Google Scholar). These findings establish that, in Dictyostelium, the MHC-PKC plays an important role in regulating the cAMP-induced myosin II localization required for cell polarization and, consequently, for efficient chemotaxis. When cells of Dictyostelium are starved, they acquire the ability to bind cAMP to specific cell surface receptors and to respond to this signal by chemotaxis, which requires phosphorylation and reorganization of myosin II (5Berlot C.H. Devreotes P.N. Spudich J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3918-3926Google Scholar, 6Berlot C.H. Spudich J.A. Devreotes P.N. Cell. 1985; 43: 307-314Google Scholar, 7Malchow D. Bohme R. Rahmsdorf H.J. Eur.

That is, the myosin II, which exists as thick filaments, translocates to the cortex (9Yumura S. Fukui Y. Nature. 1985; 314: 194-196Google Scholar) in response to cAMP stimulation. This translocation is correlated with a transient increase in the rate of MHC as well as light chain phosphorylation (5Berlot C.H. Devreotes P.N. Spudich J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3918-3926Google Scholar, 6Berlot C.H. Spudich J.A. Devreotes P.N. Cell. 1985; 43: 307-314Google Scholar, 10Nachmias V.T. Fukui Y. Spudich J.A. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1989; 13: 158-169Google Scholar). We have recently shown that cAMP exerts its effects on myosin II via the regulation of MHC-PKC (11Dembinsky A. Rubin H. Ravid S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 911-921Google Scholar). cAMP stimulation of Dictyostelium cells results in translocation of MHC-PKC from the cytosol to the membrane fraction, as well as increasing MHC-PKC phosphorylation and its kinase activity (11Dembinsky A. Rubin H. Ravid S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 911-921Google Scholar). We could also show that MHC is phosphorylated by MHC-PKC in the cell cortex, and this leads to myosin II dissociation from the cytoskeleton (11Dembinsky A. Rubin H. Ravid S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 911-921Google Scholar). Members of the PKC family are composed of a single polypeptide consisting of an NH2-terminal lipid binding regulatory domain and an ATP-binding catalytic domain located in the COOH-terminal region of the protein (12Bell R.M. Burns D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4661-4664Google Scholar, 13Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1988; 334: 661-665Google Scholar). PKC is phosphorylated on multiple serine and threonine residues located in both domains (14Flint A.J. Paladini R.D. Koshland Jr., D.E. Science. 1990; 249: 408-411Google Scholar, 15Huang K.-P. Chan K.-F.J. Singh T.J. Nakabayashi H. Huang F.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12134-12140Google Scholar, 16Mochly-Rosen D. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2291-2297Google Scholar, 17Newton A.C. Koshland Jr., D.E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10185-10188Google Scholar). Three clusters of autophosphorylation sites have been mapped in vitro in the PKC βII isoenzyme at the NH2 terminus, the COOH-terminal tail, and the hinge region between the regulatory and catalytic domains (14Flint A.J. Paladini R.D. Koshland Jr., D.E. Science. 1990; 249: 408-411Google Scholar). However, in vivo studies have indicated that the autophosphorylation sites are all localized at the COOH-terminal tail of PKC (18Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Google Scholar, 19Tsutakawa S.E. Medzihradszky K.F. Flint A.J. Burlingame A.L. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26807-26812Google Scholar). Bond and co-workers (20Zhang J. Wang L. Petrin J. Bishop R.W. Bond R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6130-6134Google Scholar) have replaced the three clusters of the autophosphorylation sites found in vitro by alanine residues. Altering the autophosphorylation sites in this way at the NH2-terminal region or at the hinge region did not affect the activity or subcellular localization of the kinase. However, replacing the autophosphorylation sites at the COOH-terminal tail with alanine residues resulted in inactive, Triton X-100-insoluble enzyme (20Zhang J. Wang L. Petrin J. Bishop R.W. Bond R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6130-6134Google Scholar). Similar results have been reported by Su et al. (21Su L. Parissenti A.M. Riedel H. Receptors Channels. 1993; 1: 1-9Google Scholar), who found that deletion of 23 amino acids from the COOH terminus of PKCα, which includes the autophosphorylation sites, caused total loss of catalytic activity. These results indicate that the PKC autophosphorylation sites located at the COOH-terminal tail play an important role in the regulation of the kinase in vivo. MHC-PKC also undergoes phosphorylation in vivo, which consists of both autophosphorylation and phosphorylation by another kinase, presumably cGMP-dependent protein kinase. These two kinds of phosphorylation involve different phosphorylation sites (11Dembinsky A. Rubin H. Ravid S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 911-921Google Scholar). Here we report that deletion of 33 amino acids from the COOH-terminal tail of MHC-PKC, which includes a cluster of 21 serine and threonine residues, abolished both MHC-PKC autophosphorylation in vitro and the cAMP-dependent MHC-PKC autophosphorylation. This indicates that this portion of the protein contains the in vitro and in vivo MHC-PKC autophosphorylation sites. We further present data showing that MHC-PKC autophosphorylation plays an important role in the kinase activation and subcellular localization. Dictyostelium discoideum strain amebas were grown in HL-5 medium (22Loomis W.F. Exp. Cell Res. 1971; 64: 484-486Google Scholar), harvested at a density of 2 × 106 cells/ml, washed twice in MES buffer (20 mM MES, pH 6.8, 0.2 mM CaCl2, 2 mM MgSO4), and resuspended at a density of 2 × 107 cells/ml to initiate development. Cells were shaken at 100 rpm at 22†C for 3.5 h. 5 mM caffeine was added to the suspension 30 min prior to the addition of cAMP. All DNA manipulations were carried out using standard methods (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). We used the expression vector pDXA-HY which contains the actin-15 promoter and allows the expression of proteins carrying a NH2-terminal His tag (24Manstein D.J. Schuster H.P. Morandini P. Hunt D.M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 162: 129-134Google Scholar). pDXA-MHC-PKC∆ST was constructed as follows. The vector pBS-MHCK (2Ravid S. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5877-5881Google Scholar), containing a 2.6-kilobase pair MHC-PKC cDNA clone, was digested with SmaI and SwaI, which deleted a fragment of 309 base pairs from the 3' of the MHC-PKC clone. The deleted fragment contains 99 base pairs of coding region and 210 base pairs of noncoding region. The deleted coding region is 33 amino acids in length and contains a cluster of 21 serine and threonine (ST) residues which are thought to be the MHC-PKC autophosphorylation domain (Fig. 1, ST domain). The resulting MHC-PKC fragment was named MHC-PKC∆ST. This MHC-PKC∆ST fragment was sequenced to confirm the deletion of the ST domain. It was cloned into pDXA-HY digested with SmaI. pDXA-MHC-PKC∆ST was used for the transformation of MHC-PKC– cells (4Abu-Elneel K. Karchi M. Ravid S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 977-984Google Scholar) using calcium phosphate precipitate (25Egelhoff T.T. Titus M.A. Manstein D.J. Ruppel K.M. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 319-335Google Scholar). Clones were selected on the basis of their resistance to G418 (Boehringer Mannheim) and screened using Western blot analysis (see below). 50 ml of 2 × 106 cells/ml expressing MHC-PKC∆ST were washed twice in 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.5), and the cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 1% Triton X-100, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 200 mM KCl, 5 mMβ-mercaptoethanol, and protease inhibitor mix (2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200 μM leupeptin, and 200 μM pepstatin). The extracts were centrifuged in a microcentrifuge for 15 min at 4†C, and the supernatant was incubated with 50 μl of a slurry of Ni+-agarose beads (Qiagen) in 20 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, and 200 mM KCl for 1 h at 4†C. The bead-protein complex was washed three times with lysis buffer, twice with lysis buffer containing 20 mM imidazole, and twice with lysis buffer containing 50 mM imidazole. The MHC-PKC∆ST was eluted with 100 μl of lysis buffer containing 150 mM imidazole and then eluted with 100 μl of lysis buffer containing 250 mM imidazole. Cells were developed for 4 h in shaking flasks as described above. Cells were washed in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 150 mM KCl and lysed in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mM sodium pyrophosphate, pH 6.8, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mix. Protein was determined by the method of Peterson (26Peterson G. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Google Scholar), and lysates were electrophoresed on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE) (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Western blots were probed with MHC-PKC polyclonal antibody (2Ravid S. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5877-5881Google Scholar), and the blots were developed using a horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (Bio-Rad Laboratories). ECL was performed using a kit from Amersham Corp. Developed Ax2 cell suspensions containing 5 × 106 cells/ml were added to an equal volume of ice-cold 2 × lysis buffer (40 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mM EDTA, and protease inhibitor mix) and centrifuged for 5 min in a microcentrifuge at 4†C. The supernatant was precleared by incubation with 30 μl of rabbit preimmune serum at 4†C for 1 h followed by incubation with Staphylococcus A cells at 4†C for 30 min. Staphylococcus A cells were centrifuged, and 10 μl of MHC-PKC antibody were added to the supernatant and incubated at 4†C for 1 h, followed by incubation with 50 μl of protein A-conjugated agarose (100 mg/ml) at 4†C for 1 h and then centrifuged for 1 min. Pellets were washed twice in 1 × lysis buffer containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and once with 1 × lysis buffer only. The protein A-MHC-PKC complex was resuspended in 200 μl of phosphatase mix (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 μM MnCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM CaCl2, 0.04 mM EDTA, 300 mM KCl, and 5 units of alkaline phosphatase (Boehringer Mannheim)) and incubated at 37†C for 30 min. The phosphatase-treated protein A-MHC-PKC complex was washed twice in 1 × lysis buffer and incubated in 200 μl of phosphatase inhibitor mix (100 mM NaF, 200 μM Na3VO4, 10 mM KH2PO4 and protease inhibitor mix) for 30 min at room temperature, followed by two washes in 1 × lysis buffer. The phosphatase-treated protein A-MHC-PKC complex was resuspended in 100 μl of 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 8 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM [γ-32P]ATP and incubated at 22†C for 20 min and then centrifuged for 1 min. The pellets were washed in 1 × lysis buffer and resuspended in SDS sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. The supernatants from a microcentrifuge spin were loaded on SDS-PAGE and analyzed using autoradiography and PhosphorImaging. Autophosphorylation of MHC-PKC∆ST was performed as described above using MHC-PKC∆ST purified with Ni+-agarose beads as described above. Dictyostelium Ax2 and MHC-PKC∆ST cells were developed and treated with caffeine as described above. Before and after the application of cAMP stimulus, 100 μl of developed cells were added to 200 μl of reaction mixture containing 0.2% Triton X-100, 8 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 0.2 mM [γ-32P]ATP and incubated for 30 s at 22†C. The MHC-PKC and MHC-PKC∆ST were immunoprecipitated and analyzed using SDS-PAGE. Densitometric scanning of the Coomassie Blue-stained gels was used to determine the relative amounts of immunoprecipitated MHC-PKC and MHC-PKC∆ST. The amounts of 32P incorporated into the proteins were determined using the PhosphorImager. Relative phosphorylation of MHC-PKC and MHC-PKC∆ST was determined by dividing the values obtained with the PhosphorImager by the values obtained by scanning of the Coomassie Blue-stained gels. In vivo phosphorylation of MHC was carried out as described previously (5Berlot C.H. Devreotes P.N. Spudich J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3918-3926Google Scholar, 6Berlot C.H. Spudich J.A. Devreotes P.N. Cell. 1985; 43: 307-314Google Scholar). This was assayed directly using the kinase extracted from the insoluble cell fraction. Following resuspension of 1 × 107 developed Ax2 and MHC-PKC∆ST cells in 1 ml of sonication buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, and protease inhibitor mix), they were stimulated with 1 μM cAMP and lysed by sonication using an ultrasonic cell disruptor (Microson) model XL with a small sized tip at 50% output power. The extract was spun in a microcentrifuge for 20 min at 4†C. MHC-PKC and MHC-PKC∆ST were extracted from the insoluble fraction using sonication buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and 0.5 M KCl. For kinase assay, the solubilized MHC-PKC or MHC-PKC∆ST were incubated with LMM58 (0.5-1 mg/ml), 6 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM [γ-32P]ATP (500 cpm/pmol), 1 mM DTT for 10 min at 22†C on a rotator. Reaction was initiated by the addition of ATP and stopped by the addition of 5% trichloroacetic acid. The precipitated LMM58 were pelleted in a microcentrifuge after incubation for 15 min on ice, washed twice with 5% trichloroacetic acid, resuspended in 20 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and electrophoresed on 7% SDS-PAGE gels. To determine incorporation of 32P into LMM58, the gels were stained and destained, and the bands were cut out of the gels and counted in a scintillation counter in 5 ml of scintillation fluid. The amounts of MHC-PKC and MHC-PKC∆ST in the cell extracts were determined using densitometric scanning of Western blots and normalized to the total amount of protein determined as described previously (26Peterson G. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Google Scholar). Following resuspension of 1 × 107 developed Ax2 and MHC-PKC∆ST cells in 1 ml of sonication buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, and protease inhibitor mix), they were lysed by sonication as described above, and the extract was spun in a microcentrifuge for 20 min at 4†C. The soluble fraction was immunoprecipitated with MHC-PKC antibody as described above. MHC-PKC and MHC-PKC∆ST were extracted from the insoluble fraction using sonication buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and 0.5 M KCl. The extract was spun in a microcentrifuge for 10 min at 4†C, and the solubilized MHC-PKC and MHC-PKC∆ST were immunoprecipitated as described above. To quantify the amounts of MHC-PKC and MHC-PKC∆ST in the soluble and insoluble fractions, the immunoprecipitated MHC-PKC and MHC-PKC∆ST from both fractions was electrophoresed on 7% SDS-PAGE gels and the Coomassie Blue-stained gels were analyzed as described above. Triton-insoluble cytoskeleton analysis was performed as described previously (28Egelhoff T.T. Brown S.S. Spudich J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 677-688Google Scholar). Supernatant and cytoskeletal pellet fractions were resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and electrophoresed on 7% SDS-PAGE gels. The relative amounts of myosin II were determined by SDS-PAGE gel analysis as described above. Phosphorylation of sites located at the COOH-terminal tail of several PKC is important for the regulation of the kinase activity and subcellular localization (18Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Google Scholar, 20Zhang J. Wang L. Petrin J. Bishop R.W. Bond R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6130-6134Google Scholar, 21Su L. Parissenti A.M. Riedel H. Receptors Channels. 1993; 1: 1-9Google Scholar, 29Zhang J. Wang L. Schwartz J. Bond R.W. Bishop W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19578-19584Google Scholar). MHC-PKC undergoes autophosphorylation in vitro and phosphorylation in vivo in response to cAMP stimulation, and this phosphorylation coincides with the activation of the kinase (11Dembinsky A. Rubin H. Ravid S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 911-921Google Scholar). The MHC-PKC autophosphorylation sites are thought to be located within the COOH-terminal tail of MHC-PKC, which contains a cluster of 21 serine and threonine residues (Fig. 1, ST domain) (1Ravid S. Spudich J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15144-15150Google Scholar, 2Ravid S. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5877-5881Google Scholar). To study the in vivo role of MHC-PKC autophosphorylation, we engineered an MHC-PKC in which the putative autophosphorylation domain was deleted (MHC-PKC∆ST). The MHC-PKC∆ST was expressed in Dictyostelium cells that were previously engineered to lack expression of MHC-PKC (so-called MHC-PKC– cells) (4Abu-Elneel K. Karchi M. Ravid S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 977-984Google Scholar). MHC-PKC– cells transformed with the pDXA-MHC-PKC∆ST construct (see “Experimental Procedures”) expressed MHC-PKC∆ST at 125-150% of the level of MHC-PKC in Ax2 cells (Fig. 2). The expressed MHC-PKC∆ST migrated on SDS-PAGE with an apparent molecular mass of about 80 kDa (Fig. 2), fitting well with the predicted molecular mass of 80 kDa and indicating that the protein was not phosphorylated. In contrast, MHC-PKC migrated on SDS-PAGE of cell extracts of Ax2 with an apparent molecular mass of about 94 kDa (Fig. 2), although the predicted molecular mass of MHC-PKC is 84 kDa (2Ravid S. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5877-5881Google Scholar). These results are consistent with a migration of the autophosphorylated form of MHC-PKC on SDS-PAGE (1Ravid S. Spudich J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15144-15150Google Scholar), indicating that the MHC-PKC was in its phosphorylated form, under these experimental conditions. In addition to the 94-kDa band of MHC-PKC, another band with an apparent molecular mass of 90 kDa was found (Fig. 2). This protein could be either partially phosphorylated form of MHC-PKC or a degradation product of MHC-PKC. To find out whether the ST domain of MHC-PKC is indeed the kinase autophosphorylation domain, we studied the ability of MHC-PKC∆ST to undergo autophosphorylation in vitro. To do this, we developed Ax2 and MHC-PKC∆ST cells. The MHC-PKC was immunoprecipitated and the MHC-PKC∆ST purified using Ni+-agarose beads as described under “Experimental Procedures.” To increase autophosphorylation, the proteins were treated with phosphatase prior to the autophosphorylation reaction as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The phosphatase-treated MHC-PKC immunocomplexed to protein A-Sepharose and the MHC-PKC∆ST-Ni+-agarose complex were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP and MgCl2, and the extent of the autophosphorylation was analyzed using autoradiography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” On addition of ATP and MgCl2 to MHC-PKC, it migrated with a molecular mass of 94 kDa (Fig. 3A) which is consistent with a molecular mass of the autophosphorylated form of MHC-PKC (1Ravid S. Spudich J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15144-15150Google Scholar). Autoradiography revealed that MHC-PKC indeed underwent autophosphorylation (Fig. 3B), and similar results have been previously reported (1Ravid S. Spudich J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15144-15150Google Scholar). MHC-PKC appeared as a doublet on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3A), which may represent different extents of autophosphorylation. In contrast, addition of ATP and MgCl2 to MHC-PKC∆ST did not alter the migration pattern of the protein, and it migrated with a molecular mass predicted for nonphosphorylated truncated MHC-PKC protein (Fig. 3C). Autoradiography of MHC-PKC∆ST revealed that the protein was unable to undergo autophosphorylation (Fig. 3D). These results indicate that the ST domain is the in vitro MHC-PKC autophosphorylation domain. We have previously reported that, in response to cAMP stimulation, MHC-PKC undergoes a phosphorylation which is composed of both autophosphorylation and phosphorylation in a cGMP-dependent manner (11Dembinsky A. Rubin H. Ravid S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 911-921Google Scholar). To address whether MHC-PKC∆ST is able to undergo in vivo phosphorylation in response to cAMP stimulation, we stimulated Ax2 and MHC-PKC∆ST cells with cAMP and a total lysate of amebas labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. MHC-PKC and MHC-PKC∆ST were immunoprecipitated and the levels of their phosphorylation were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” MHC-PKC was transiently phosphorylated in response to cAMP stimulation (Fig. 4, A and B), with peak phosphorylation at about 40 s (Fig. 4B) (see also Dembinsky et al. (11Dembinsky A. Rubin H. Ravid S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 911-921Google Scholar)). In contrast, addition of cAMP to cells expressing the MHC-PKC∆ST protein resulted in very low phosphorylation levels (Fig. 4, A and B), whose magnitude was similar to the basal level of MHC-PKC phosphorylation determined 120 s after cAMP stimulation (Fig. 4B). This low level of phosphorylation in the MHC-PKC∆ST may be due to the phosphorylation of the protein by another kinase possibly cGMP-dependent protein kinase, as we recently suggested (11Dembinsky A. Rubin H. Ravid S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 911-921Google Scholar). The inability of MHC-PKC∆ST to undergo both autophosphorylation in vitro (Fig. 3) and cAMP-dependent phosphorylation (Fig. 4), indicate that the in vitro and in vivo autophosphorylation sites of MHC-PKC are the same and are located within the ST domain. The finding of relatively high phosphorylation levels of MHC-PKC prior to cAMP stimulation (Fig. 4, A and B) is consistent with the results presented in Fig. 2, in which MHC-PKC from Ax2 extract migrated on SDS-PAGE with an apparent molecular mass consistent with migration of the kinase in its autophosphorylated form (1Ravid S. Spudich J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15144-15150Google Scholar). We reported previously that, on cAMP stimulation, MHC-PKC translocates to the membrane, presumably as part of the kinase activation mechanism. This translocation coincides with the kinase phosphorylation (11Dembinsky A. Rubin H. Ravid S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 911-921Google Scholar). It was therefore of interest to study the localization properties of MHC-PKC∆ST on cAMP stimulation. Ax2 and MHC-PKC∆ST cells were developed and treated with caffeine, stimulated with cAMP, and lysed using sonication, and the MHC-PKC and MHC-PKC∆ST were immunoprecipitated from the soluble and the insoluble fractions using specific MHC-PKC polyclonal antibody (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 5 shows that, prior to cAMP stimulation, about 30% of the MHC-PKC resided in the insoluble fraction, whereas cAMP stimulation was followed by a rapid transient association of up to about 60% of the MHC-PKC with the membrane fraction, as reported previously (11Dembinsky A. Rubin H. Ravid S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 911-921Google Scholar). In contrast, about 70% of MHC-PKC∆ST remained in the membrane regardless of cAMP stimulation (Fig. 5). These results indicate that the MHC-PKC autophosphorylation mechanism is involved in the dissociation of the kinase from the membrane. To examine the possible role of MHC-PKC autophosphorylation in the activation of the kinase, we studied the specific activity of MHC-PKC and MHC-PKC∆ST in response to cAMP stimulation. Ax2 and MHC-PKC∆ST cells were stimulated with cAMP, and the kinase was solubilized from cell membranes and assayed for kinase activity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Although Dictyostelium contains several myosin heavy chain kinases, all except MHC-PKC are located in the cytosol (for review, see Tan et al. (30Tan J.L. Ravid S. Spudich J.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 721-759Google Scholar)). Furthermore, cells in which the MHC-PKC was eliminated do not show MHC phosphorylation activity in their membranes (4Abu-Elneel K. Karchi M. Ravid S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 977-984Google Scholar). Accordingly, all subsequent kinase assays were performed on MHC-PKC or MHC-PKC∆ST that were solubilized from the cell membrane fraction. Fig. 6 shows that cAMP stimulation of Ax2 cells resulted in a transient increase in membrane-associated MHC-PKC kinase activity as reported previously (11Dembinsky A. Rubin H. Ravid S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 911-921Google Scholar). These cAMP-stimulated increases in MHC-PKC activity coincided with the cAMP-stimulated membrane-association (Fig. 5) and phosphorylation (Fig. 4) of MHC-PKC, suggesting that these processes are linked to each other and may be required for the activation of MHC-PKC, as was proposed previously (11Dembinsky A. Rubin H. Ravid S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 911-921Google Scholar). In contrast, cAMP stimulation of MHC-PKC∆ST did not increase the kinase activity (Fig. 6). MHC-PKC∆ST showed a basal level of MHC kinase activity with magnitude similar to that shown by MHC-PKC isolated from nonstimulated Ax2 cells (Fig. 6). These results indicate that MHC-PKC autophosphorylation plays a role in the cAMP-dependent activation of the kinase. Interestingly, MHC-PKC∆ST activity decreased 60 s after cAMP stimulation, reaching a level of activity similar to that of MHC-PKC determined 120 s after cAMP stimulation. The decrease in MHC-PKC∆ST activity indicates that, in addition to autophosphorylation, there is another mechanism(s) that regulate the activity of MHC-PKC. One such possible mechanism is a cGMP-dependent phosphorylation (11Dembinsky A. Rubin H. Ravid S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 911-921Google Scholar). We reported previously that MHC-PKC is the kinase that phosphorylates MHC in response to cAMP stimulation (4Abu-Elneel K. Karchi M. Ravid S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 977-984Google Scholar). We now tested how the cAMP-induced MHC phosphorylation is affected by the inability of MHC-PKC∆ST to undergo autophosphorylation and to increase its activity in a cAMP-dependent manner. As shown in Fig. 7A Ax2 cells, but not MHC-PKC∆ST cells, responded to cAMP stimulation by an increase in MHC phosphorylation. These results indicate that deletion of the autophosphorylation domain of MHC-PKC resulted in elimination of the cAMP-dependent MHC phosphorylation. These results are consistent with the finding that the MHC-PKC autophosphorylation plays an important role in the regulation of MHC-PKC and, consequently in the regulation of myosin II. Unstimulated developed Ax2 and MHC-PKC∆ST cells exhibited the same basal levels of MHC phosphorylation (Fig. 7A). MHC phosphorylation regulates the distribution of myosin II within the cell (4Abu-Elneel K. Karchi M. Ravid S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 977-984Google Scholar, 5Berlot C.H. Devreotes P.N. Spudich J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3918-3926Google Scholar, 6Berlot C.H. Spudich J.A. Devreotes P.N. Cell. 1985; 43: 307-314Google Scholar, 11Dembinsky A. Rubin H. Ravid S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 911-921Google Scholar). In order to study what happens to the localization properties of myosin II in the MHC-PKC∆ST mutant cells when there is no cAMP-dependent increase in the MHC-PKC∆ST activity, we isolated cAMP-stimulated actin-enriched Triton-insoluble cytoskeletons (see “Experimental Procedures”). 33% of the myosin II was insoluble in unstimulated developed Ax2 cells (Fig. 7B). Addition of cAMP resulted in a rapid accumulation of myosin II associated with the Triton-insoluble cytoskeleton (up to 65%), followed by an increase in myosin II solubility (Fig. 7B), as found previously (5Berlot C.H. Devreotes P.N. Spudich J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3918-3926Google Scholar, 6Berlot C.H. Spudich J.A. Devreotes P.N. Cell. 1985; 43: 307-314Google Scholar, 11Dembinsky A. Rubin H. Ravid S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 911-921Google Scholar). However, about 50% of the myosin II was already insoluble in unstimulated developed MHC-PKC∆ST cells. Addition of cAMP resulted in a gradual increase in myosin II insolubility (up to 70%). In contrast to wild type cells, the increase in myosin II insolubility was not followed by a decrease in its insolubility. These findings are similar to those obtained for MHC-PKC– cells (4Abu-Elneel K. Karchi M. Ravid S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 977-984Google Scholar). Previous studies have suggested a correlation between PKC activation and its autophosphorylation (20Zhang J. Wang L. Petrin J. Bishop R.W. Bond R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6130-6134Google Scholar, 31Dutil E.M. Keranen L.M. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29359-29362Google Scholar, 32Mitchell F.E. Marais R.M. Parker P.J. Biochem.

Chem. 1990; 265: 6296-6300Google Scholar). The autophosphorylation sites located at the COOH-terminal tail of several PKC are important in the regulation of the kinase activity and subcellular localization (18Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Google Scholar, 20Zhang J. Wang L. Petrin J. Bishop R.W. Bond R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6130-6134Google Scholar, 21Su L. Parissenti A.M. Riedel H. Receptors Channels. 1993; 1: 1-9Google Scholar, 29Zhang J. Wang L. Schwartz J. Bond R.W. Bishop W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19578-19584Google Scholar). Here we have examined the functional role of autophosphorylation of MHC-PKC using deletion and biochemical analyses. Our results indicate that (i) it is the ST domain which is autophosphorylated in vitro and in vivo in response to cAMP stimulation and (ii) that MHC-PKC autophosphorylation plays a role in its partition into the cytosol and its activation in vivo. We have previously shown that cAMP stimulation of Dictyostelium cells resulted in several changes in MHC-PKC behavior (11Dembinsky A. Rubin H. Ravid S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 911-921Google Scholar). First, cAMP stimulation causes MHC-PKC to translocate to the membrane. Second, translocation coincides with increases in MHC-PKC phosphorylation. A third change is an increase in MHC-PKC activity. The association of MHC-PKC with the membrane is necessary for MHC-PKC activation since the cytosolic MHC-PKC has a very low kinase activity. There are two types of MHC-PKC phosphorylation, which are different in their extent and their sites; autophosphorylation, which may occur at the membrane and accounts for most of the MHC-PKC phosphorylation, and cGMP-dependent phosphorylation, possibly via cGMP-dependent protein kinase which may take place in the cytosol. The two different phosphorylations occur on different serine and/or threonine residues in MHC-PKC (11Dembinsky A. Rubin H. Ravid S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 911-921Google Scholar). Here, deletion of the ST domain abolished the in vitro MHC-PKC autophosphorylation. However, in vivo MHC-PKC∆ST still exhibits a low level of phosphorylation which may represent cGMP-dependent phosphorylation. These results are consistent with our previous report that MHC-PKC and MHC-PKC∆ST are phosphorylated in vitro by cGMP-dependent protein kinase (11Dembinsky A. Rubin H. Ravid S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 911-921Google Scholar). A similar phosphorylation of PKC by a heterologous kinase and its involvement in the regulation of PKC has also been reported for PKCα (35Cazaubon S. Bornancin F. Parker P. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 443-448Google Scholar), however the identity of this kinase is unknown. We suggested previously that a plausible candidate for a PKC kinase is a cGMP-dependent protein kinase (11Dembinsky A. Rubin H. Ravid S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 911-921Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of MHC-PKC by another kinase may be required for the kinase translocation to the membrane which is required for the kinase activation, whereas the MHC-PKC autophosphorylation may be required for its activation and membrane dissociation. Previous studies with mammalian PKC have shown that elimination of the COOH-terminal autophosphorylation sites fully inactivates the kinase (21Su L. Parissenti A.M. Riedel H. Receptors Channels. 1993; 1: 1-9Google Scholar, 29Zhang J. Wang L. Schwartz J. Bond R.W. Bishop W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19578-19584Google Scholar). In contrast, upon deletion of the ST domain the MHC-PKC retained its basal kinase activity and lost the cAMP-dependent increases in its activity. These findings may indicate that the expressed protein is folded properly and the absence of cAMP-dependent increases in the kinase activity was a result of the ST domain deletion, it further suggests that this domain plays a key role in the cAMP-dependent kinase activation. It is noteworthy that the basal level of MHC-PKC∆ST activity decreased 60 s after cAMP stimulation. This may result from phosphatases removing the phosphates that were incorporated into the MHC-PKC∆ST by cGMP mechanism thereby decreasing the kinase activity. Deletion of the ST domain results in kinase that is unable to partition into the cytosol, indicating that the autophosphorylation of the ST domain plays a role in the dissociation of the kinase from the membrane. The seemingly contradictory results that autophosphorylation is required for both kinase activation and membrane dissociation may be explained as follow: the cluster of the 21 serine/threonine residues is autophosphorylated in two steps. In the first step only a fraction of the sites is autophosphorylated and this autophosphorylation is required for the activation of the kinase in response to cAMP. In the second step the remaining sites are autophosphorylated and this phosphorylation is required for dissociation of the kinase from the membrane. We are currently attempting to express MHC-PKC proteins in which the autophosphorylation sites are randomly converted to alanine residues. Experiments with these altered MHC-PKC proteins will enable us to explore the in vivo role of the different autophosphorylation sites. The myosin II Triton-solubility and phosphorylation characterization in MHC-PKC∆ST are similar to that in the mutant from which the MHC-PKC was eliminated (4Abu-Elneel K. Karchi M. Ravid S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 977-984Google Scholar). The inability of MHC-PKC∆ST to increase its activity in response to cAMP stimulation is also reflected in the state of MHC phosphorylation and its Triton-solubility; MHC in MHC-PKC∆ST cells is not phosphorylated in response to cAMP stimulation. These results are consistent with the findings that the cAMP-dependent MHC phosphorylation is carried out by MHC-PKC (4Abu-Elneel K. Karchi M. Ravid S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 977-984Google Scholar). If the enzyme does not respond catalytically to cAMP stimulation, the cell cannot respond to cAMP stimulation by phosphorylating the MHC. The aberrant cAMP-dependent myosin II Triton-solubility in MHC-PKC∆ST cells is consistent with the finding that it is through MHC phosphorylation that myosin II distributed throughout the cell in response to cAMP stimulation. MHC-PKC∆ST and MHC-PKC cells (4Abu-Elneel K. Karchi M. Ravid S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 977-984Google Scholar) contain highly Triton-insoluble myosin II. This contrasts with wild type cells in which cAMP stimulation resulted in translocation of myosin II to the cortex, followed by dissociation of myosin II from the membrane fraction (5Berlot C.H. Devreotes P.N. Spudich J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3918-3926Google Scholar, 6Berlot C.H. Spudich J.A. Devreotes P.N. Cell. 1985; 43: 307-314Google Scholar, 11Dembinsky A. Rubin H. Ravid S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 911-921Google Scholar). In the two mutant cell lines, cAMP stimulation resulted in a gradual increase in myosin II association with the cytoskeleton with no apparent dissociation. The simplest explanation for these results is that, in unstimulated MHC-PKC∆ST cells, the absence of MHC-PKC drives myosin II molecules into filaments in vivo and that these filaments have high affinity for the cortical cytoskeleton. cAMP stimulation, additional myosin II translocates to the cytoskeleton and, subsequently, cannot dissociate from it because of the presence of catalytically inactive MHC-PKC∆ST. The observed phenotype of MHC-PKC∆ST cells described here is not a result of the expression of MHC-PKC∆ST per se but rather results from the absence of the ST domain; this is indicated by previous experiments in which we engineered cells expressing MHC-PKC under the same actin promoter, and the resulting cells had a wild type phenotype. The detailed mechanism by which autophosphorylation could control MHC-PKC activity remains to be elucidated. One possibility is that the autophosphorylation triggers a conformational change that is important in relieving inhibition of MHC-PKC pseudosubstrate prototope similar to PKC (12Bell R.M. Burns D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4661-4664Google Scholar). Supporting this hypothesis, the putative substrate (and pseudosubstrate) binding site of PKC is thought to be located near the COOH-terminal autophosphorylation sites (36House C. Kemp B.E. Science. 1987; 238: 1726-1728Google Scholar, 37House C. Robinson P.J. Kemp B.E. FEBS Lett. 1989; 249: 243-247Google Scholar). This model is further supported by the observation that the catalytic fragment of PKC retains histone kinase activity, even though it can no longer autophosphorylate (16Mochly-Rosen D. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2291-2297Google Scholar). This suggests that removal of the regulatory domain eliminates the requirement for COOH-terminal autophosphorylation. Alternatively, this autophosphorylation may be critical for enzyme-substrate recognition or for interaction of MHC-PKC with regulatory factors. A model consistent with both our data and previous data is that MHC-PKC is first synthesized as an inactive precursor that is cytosolic (11Dembinsky A. Rubin H. Ravid S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 911-921Google Scholar). The kinase is then recognized by a cGMP-dependent protein kinase, which phosphorylates it, possibly at the C-2 and C-4 domains. This phosphorylation may be required for the kinase translocation to the cell membrane. The membrane-bound enzyme is then stimulated by autophosphorylation at the ST domain. The first step of autophosphorylation may activate the MHC-PKC causing MHC phosphorylation, followed by a second step of autophosphorylation resulting in a decrease in the enzyme's membrane affinity so that it partitions into the cytosol. This returns the enzyme to its basal state. We thank Dr. Dietmar Manstein for pDXA-HY vector."

In dimeric form, these proteins function as ligand-dependent transcriptional regulatory factors by binding to DNA sequences located in the promoter of target genes called retinoic acid-responsive elements (RAREs) or retinoid X-responsive elements (RXREs). In vitro binding studies have demonstrated that both all-trans-RA (RA) and 9-cis-RA are ligands for the RARs, whereas only 9-cis-RA has been shown to be a ligand for the RXRs (12Heyman R.A. Mangelsdorg D.J. Dyck J.A. Stein R.B. Eichele G. Evans R.M. Thaller C. Cell. 1992; 68: 397-406Google Scholar, 13Levin A.A. Sturzenbecker L.J. Kazmer S. Bosakowski T. Huselton C. Allenby G. Speck J. Kratzeisen C. Rosenberger M. Lovey A. Grippo J. Nature. 1992; 355: 361-369Google Scholar).Like other members of the steroid/thyroid hormone superfamily, RARs and RXRs consist of six functionally distinct domains designated A-F (2Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 319-350Google Scholar). Unique functions have been described for several of these domains. The A and B domains are important for the ligand-independent transactivation function (AF-1). The C domain, which contains two zinc fingers, is important for both DNA binding and receptor dimerization. The E domain is functionally complex. In addition to containing all the information necessary for high affinity ligand binding, it also contains a ligand-dependent transactivation function (AF-2) and accessory dimerization sequences.Recently there have been major advances in understanding the nature of the ligand binding domain of RARs and RXRs. High resolution crystal structures of the ligand binding domains of apo-RXRα and holo-RARγ have demonstrated that these receptors share a similar overall fold (14Bourguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 375: 377-382Google Scholar, 15Renaud J.-P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 378: 681-689Google Scholar). Furthermore, several amino acids within the ligand binding domains of RARs have been reported to be functionally important for high affinity binding of RA. Previous studies from this laboratory have demonstrated that the positively charged amino acid residues, Arg269 and Lys220, are critical for the high affinity binding of RA and retinoid specificity of RARβ (16Tairis N.

Chem. 1995; 270: 18380-18387Google Scholar). Ostrowski et al. (18Ostrowski J. Hammer L. Roalsvig T. Pokornowski K. Reczek P.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1812-1816Google Scholar) have reported that Ala225/Ile232 of RARβ and the homologous amino acid residues Ser232/Thr239 of RARα are important for discrimination of subtype-specific synthetic ligands, and Lupisella et al. (19Lupisella J.A. Driscoll J.E. Metzler W.J. Reczek P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24884-24890Google Scholar) have demonstrated using fluorescence quenching techniques that Trp227 is within the ligand binding site of RARγ. Finally, Dallery et al. (20Dallery N. Sablonniere B. Grillier I. Formstecher P. Dautrevaux M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12428-12436Google Scholar) and Sani et al. (21Sani B.P. Singh R.K. Reddy L.G. Gaub M.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 283: 107-113Google Scholar) have demonstrated a loss of RA binding after treatment of the EF domain of RARα and chicken skin RARs, respectively, with several sulfhydryl-modifying reagents suggesting that Cys residue(s) may be located in the ligand binding pocket of these receptors. The goal of this work was to identify which Cys residue(s) are important for this loss of RA binding and to address the role that this Cys residue(s) plays in the binding of RA.In the current report we have shown that, similar to RARα, RA binding to both RARβ and RARγ is inhibited by the sulfhydryl-specific modifying reagents DTNB and MMTS and that the sulfhydryl group of the reactive Cys residue(s) of RARβ lies in or near the retinoid binding pocket. These Cys residue(s) alone do not play a critical role in RA binding. Rather, these modified Cys residue(s) of RARβ function to sterically hinder the binding of RA. The modified Cys residues critical for the inhibition of RA binding differ depending on the reagent employed. Only modification of Cys228 is necessary when RARβ is treated with reagents that transfer large bulky groups to reactive Cys residues, whereas both Cys228 and Cys267 must be modified when a small functional group is transferred such as thiomethyl or thiocyanide to fully inhibit RA binding. Taken together these data suggest that Cys228 most likely lies closer to the opening of the ligand binding pocket of RARβ, whereas Cys267 lies more deeply buried within the ligand binding pocket.DISCUSSIONIn the current report we have extended the findings of Dallery et al. (20Dallery N. Sablonniere B. Grillier I. Formstecher P. Dautrevaux M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12428-12436Google Scholar) to demonstrate that RA binding to all three RAR types is blocked similarly by specific sulfhydryl-modifying agents. The concentrations of DTNB and MMTS necessary to inhibit RA binding to RARβ and RARγ are similar to those which have been reported previously for the ligand binding domain of RARα (20Dallery N. Sablonniere B. Grillier I. Formstecher P. Dautrevaux M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12428-12436Google Scholar). The reversibility of this effect by reducing agents demonstrates the specificity of these reactions to sulfhydryl groups. Interestingly, unlike RARα and RARβ, RA binding by RARγ following MMTS treatment was only reversible to about 50% of control binding with the polar reducing agent DTT. However RA binding was restored to near unmodified levels using the hydrophobic reducing agent TBP. This suggests that there is at least one critical Cys residue responsible for inhibition of RA binding upon methanethiolation with MMTS which lies within a more hydrophobic region of RARγ than in RARβ and RARα. This region of greater hydrophobicity in the ligand binding pocket of RARγ compared with RARβ and RARα is most likely one of several factors responsible for the ability of synthetic retinoids to display receptor selectivity.The glucocorticoid receptor (GR), another member of the steroid/thyroid hormone superfamily of receptors, has also been shown to be sensitive to sulfhydryl modification (35Harrison R.W. Woodward C. Thompson E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 759: 1-6Google Scholar). GR modified with MMTS exhibits a bimodal response in which inhibition of ligand binding is maximal both at low and high concentrations of the modifying reagent (36Miller N.R. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15217-15225Google Scholar, 37Stancato L.F. Hutchinson K.A. Chakraborti P.K. Simons S.S. Pratt W.B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3729-3736Google Scholar). It has been determined that this response is a result of intramolecular disulfide bond formation between two closely spaced Cys residues (vicinal dithiols) located in the ligand binding pocket of GR upon treatment with low concentrations of MMTS (36Miller N.R. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15217-15225Google Scholar, 37Stancato L.F. Hutchinson K.A. Chakraborti P.K. Simons S.S. Pratt W.B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3729-3736Google Scholar). We did not observe this biphasic pattern of inhibition of RA binding in any of the RARs treated with MMTS under similar conditions. In addition, our sodium arsenite results further support the conclusion that there are no reactive vicinal dithiols in any of the three RARs responsible for inhibition of RA binding.The results of our protection-exchange experiment with RARβ demonstrating that RA binding can protect Cys residues from chemical modification suggests that these critical Cys residue(s) may be located in or near the ligand binding pocket. Protection may result from either the physical blocking of the modifying reagents by RA or a conformational change in the ligand binding domain upon RA binding which blocks the accessibility of the reactive Cys residues to the modification reagents. The latter is more likely based on the work of Renaud et al. (15Renaud J.-P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 378: 681-689Google Scholar) showing that the major difference in the crystal structure of apo-RXRα and holo-RARγ ligand binding domains is in the position of helix 12. In the apo-receptor the entrance to the RA binding site is open while in the holo-receptor helix 12 collapses over the entrance to the binding pocket blocking access to the site.The loss of RA binding following treatment with MMTS and DTNB cannot be explained by the elimination of critical interactions between any of the Cys residues examined and RA since each of the three Cys mutants have an apparent Kd for RA in the range of that of wild type RARβ. Interestingly, the C228A mutant did display a 7-fold decrease in affinity for RA when compared with wild type RARβ. This is not surprising since two amino acids of RARβ, close in the primary sequence of Cys228 (Ala225 and Ile232), have been demonstrated to be important for interaction with type-selective ligands (18Ostrowski J. Hammer L. Roalsvig T. Pokornowski K. Reczek P.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1812-1816Google Scholar). Furthermore, the crystal structure of holo-RARγ indicates that Cys237, the homologous residue to Cys228 of RARβ, lies within 4 Å of RA (15Renaud J.-P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 378: 681-689Google Scholar). It is possible that substitution of Cys228 with an Ala removes an interaction between this Cys residue and RA which contributes to the overall stability of holo-RARβ. On the other hand, it is also possible that this mutation has caused a small disruption of the local topography of the ligand binding pocket sufficient to result in this modest decrease in the affinity of C228A for RA.Although inhibition of RA binding upon sulfhydryl modification of RARβ is a result of steric blocking of RA binding, the Cys residues whose modification is critical for this inhibition of RA binding differ depending on the reagent employed. Wild type RARβ displays similar sensitivity to DTNB and MMTS treatment; however, the C228A and C267A mutants represent novel receptors with unique sensitivity to these two sulfhydryl modifying reagents. Our finding of a differential response of these two mutants to reagents that transfer different size blocking groups is not unprecedented. It has been reported that specific sulfhydryl modification of rabbit muscle creatine kinase with blocking groups of increasing size resulted in the incremental decrease in enzymatic activity (38Smith D.J. Maggio E.T. Kenyon G.L. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 766-771Google Scholar). Similar results have been found for the GR. Modification of critical Cys residues in GR with MMTS results in a greater amount of residual binding of ligand than modification by iodoacetamide which transfers a relatively large blocking group (36Miller N.R. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15217-15225Google Scholar).Our data demonstrate that both Cys228 and Cys267 are located within the ligand binding pocket of RARβ such that when modified they inhibit the binding of RA. However Cys228 lies closer to the opening of the ligand binding pocket than Cys267 because Cys228 is accessible to modification by both large and small reagents and upon modification results in the inhibition of RA binding, whereas Cys267 is only sensitive to small reagents. We have estimated the size of DTNB and MMTS by measuring the carbon center to carbon center distances on molecular models. The dimensions of MMTS, when viewed as a molecular structure, are 3.0 Å in height and 4.0 Å in width, whereas those of DTNB are 6.0 and 7.4 Å, respectively. Based on our sulfhydryl modification results, these measurements suggest that Cys267 is located in a region of the pocket not accessible to molecules or side chains of molecules much larger than 4.0 Å in diameter. Since RA is no greater than 4.0 Å at its carboxylate end and at least 5.0 Å at the β-ionone ring, we can conclude that Cys267 of RARβ is closest to the carboxylate end of RA. This conclusion is supported by the recently published crystal structure of the ligand binding domain of holo-RARγ which demonstrates that the homologous residue of Cys228 (Cys237) is within 4 Å of carbon 13 of RA (15Renaud J.-P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 378: 681-689Google Scholar). In addition, there is only one amino acid residue in the primary sequence between Cys267 and Arg269 of RARβ (Arg278 of RARγ). We have previously shown Arg269 of RARβ to be important for RA binding and retinoid specificity most likely by interaction with the carboxyl group of RA (16Tairis N. Gabriel J.L. Gyda III, M. Soprano K.J. Soprano D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19516-19522Google Scholar, 17Tairis N. Gabriel J.L. Soprano K.J. Soprano D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18380-18387Google Scholar), and the crystal structure of the ligand binding domain of RARγ places Arg278 within 4 Å of the carboxylate oxygen 22 of RA (15Renaud J.-P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 378: 681-689Google Scholar). INTRODUCTIONRetinoic acid is the potent mediator of the biological effects of vitamin A that include growth, differentiation, and morphogenesis (for review, see Ref 1Gudas L. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B.

The RARs and RXRs are each made up of three receptor types, designated α, β, and γ (2Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids. 2nd Ed.

In dimeric form, these proteins function as ligand-dependent transcriptional regulatory factors by binding to DNA sequences located in the promoter of target genes called retinoic acid-responsive elements (RAREs) or retinoid X-responsive elements (RXREs). In vitro binding studies have demonstrated that both all-trans-RA (RA) and 9-cis-RA are ligands for the RARs, whereas only 9-cis-RA has been shown to be a ligand for the RXRs (12Heyman R.A. Mangelsdorg D.J. Dyck J.A. Stein R.B. Eichele G. Evans R.M. Thaller C. Cell. 1992; 68: 397-406Google Scholar, 13Levin A.A. Sturzenbecker L.J. Kazmer S. Bosakowski T. Huselton C. Allenby G. Speck J. Kratzeisen C. Rosenberger M. Lovey A. Grippo J. Nature. 1992; 355: 361-369Google Scholar).Like other members of the steroid/thyroid hormone superfamily, RARs and RXRs consist of six functionally distinct domains designated A-F (2Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 319-350Google Scholar). Unique functions have been described for several of these domains. The A and B domains are important for the ligand-independent transactivation function (AF-1). The C domain, which contains two zinc fingers, is important for both DNA binding and receptor dimerization. The E domain is functionally complex. In addition to containing all the information necessary for high affinity ligand binding, it also contains a ligand-dependent transactivation function (AF-2) and accessory dimerization sequences.Recently there have been major advances in understanding the nature of the ligand binding domain of RARs and RXRs. High resolution crystal structures of the ligand binding domains of apo-RXRα and holo-RARγ have demonstrated that these receptors share a similar overall fold (14Bourguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 375: 377-382Google Scholar, 15Renaud J.-P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 378: 681-689Google Scholar). Furthermore, several amino acids within the ligand binding domains of RARs have been reported to be functionally important for high affinity binding of RA.

DISCUSSIONIn the current report we have extended the findings of Dallery et al. (20Dallery N. Sablonniere B. Grillier I. Formstecher P. Dautrevaux M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12428-12436Google Scholar) to demonstrate that RA binding to all three RAR types is blocked similarly by specific sulfhydryl-modifying agents. The concentrations of DTNB and MMTS necessary to inhibit RA binding to RARβ and RARγ are similar to those which have been reported previously for the ligand binding domain of RARα (20Dallery N. Sablonniere B. Grillier I. Formstecher P. Dautrevaux M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12428-12436Google Scholar). The reversibility of this effect by reducing agents demonstrates the specificity of these reactions to sulfhydryl groups. Interestingly, unlike RARα and RARβ, RA binding by RARγ following MMTS treatment was only reversible to about 50% of control binding with the polar reducing agent DTT. However RA binding was restored to near unmodified levels using the hydrophobic reducing agent TBP. This suggests that there is at least one critical Cys residue responsible for inhibition of RA binding upon methanethiolation with MMTS which lies within a more hydrophobic region of RARγ than in RARβ and RARα. This region of greater hydrophobicity in the ligand binding pocket of RARγ compared with RARβ and RARα is most likely one of several factors responsible for the ability of synthetic retinoids to display receptor selectivity.The glucocorticoid receptor (GR), another member of the steroid/thyroid hormone superfamily of receptors, has also been shown to be sensitive to sulfhydryl modification (35Harrison R.W. Woodward C. Thompson E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 759: 1-6Google Scholar). GR modified with MMTS exhibits a bimodal response in which inhibition of ligand binding is maximal both at low and high concentrations of the modifying reagent (36Miller N.R. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15217-15225Google Scholar, 37Stancato L.F. Hutchinson K.A. Chakraborti P.K. Simons S.S. Pratt W.B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3729-3736Google Scholar). It has been determined that this response is a result of intramolecular disulfide bond formation between two closely spaced Cys residues (vicinal dithiols) located in the ligand binding pocket of GR upon treatment with low concentrations of MMTS (36Miller N.R. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15217-15225Google Scholar, 37Stancato L.F. Hutchinson K.A. Chakraborti P.K. Simons S.S. Pratt W.B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3729-3736Google Scholar). We did not observe this biphasic pattern of inhibition of RA binding in any of the RARs treated with MMTS under similar conditions. In addition, our sodium arsenite results further support the conclusion that there are no reactive vicinal dithiols in any of the three RARs responsible for inhibition of RA binding.The results of our protection-exchange experiment with RARβ demonstrating that RA binding can protect Cys residues from chemical modification suggests that these critical Cys residue(s) may be located in or near the ligand binding pocket. Protection may result from either the physical blocking of the modifying reagents by RA or a conformational change in the ligand binding domain upon RA binding which blocks the accessibility of the reactive Cys residues to the modification reagents. The latter is more likely based on the work of Renaud et al. (15Renaud J.-P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 378: 681-689Google Scholar) showing that the major difference in the crystal structure of apo-RXRα and holo-RARγ ligand binding domains is in the position of helix 12. In the apo-receptor the entrance to the RA binding site is open while in the holo-receptor helix 12 collapses over the entrance to the binding pocket blocking access to the site.The loss of RA binding following treatment with MMTS and DTNB cannot be explained by the elimination of critical interactions between any of the Cys residues examined and RA since each of the three Cys mutants have an apparent Kd for RA in the range of that of wild type RARβ. Interestingly, the C228A mutant did display a 7-fold decrease in affinity for RA when compared with wild type RARβ. This is not surprising since two amino acids of RARβ, close in the primary sequence of Cys228 (Ala225 and Ile232), have been demonstrated to be important for interaction with type-selective ligands (18Ostrowski J. Hammer L. Roalsvig T. Pokornowski K. Reczek P.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1812-1816Google Scholar). Furthermore, the crystal structure of holo-RARγ indicates that Cys237, the homologous residue to Cys228 of RARβ, lies within 4 Å of RA (15Renaud J.-P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 378: 681-689Google Scholar). It is possible that substitution of Cys228 with an Ala removes an interaction between this Cys residue and RA which contributes to the overall stability of holo-RARβ. On the other hand, it is also possible that this mutation has caused a small disruption of the local topography of the ligand binding pocket sufficient to result in this modest decrease in the affinity of C228A for RA.Although inhibition of RA binding upon sulfhydryl modification of RARβ is a result of steric blocking of RA binding, the Cys residues whose modification is critical for this inhibition of RA binding differ depending on the reagent employed. Wild type RARβ displays similar sensitivity to DTNB and MMTS treatment; however, the C228A and C267A mutants represent novel receptors with unique sensitivity to these two sulfhydryl modifying reagents. Our finding of a differential response of these two mutants to reagents that transfer different size blocking groups is not unprecedented. It has been reported that specific sulfhydryl modification of rabbit muscle creatine kinase with blocking groups of increasing size resulted in the incremental decrease in enzymatic activity (38Smith D.J. Maggio E.T. Kenyon G.L. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 766-771Google Scholar). Similar results have been found for the GR. Modification of critical Cys residues in GR with MMTS results in a greater amount of residual binding of ligand than modification by iodoacetamide which transfers a relatively large blocking group (36Miller N.R. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15217-15225Google Scholar).Our data demonstrate that both Cys228 and Cys267 are located within the ligand binding pocket of RARβ such that when modified they inhibit the binding of RA. However Cys228 lies closer to the opening of the ligand binding pocket than Cys267 because Cys228 is accessible to modification by both large and small reagents and upon modification results in the inhibition of RA binding, whereas Cys267 is only sensitive to small reagents. We have estimated the size of DTNB and MMTS by measuring the carbon center to carbon center distances on molecular models. The dimensions of MMTS, when viewed as a molecular structure, are 3.0 Å in height and 4.0 Å in width, whereas those of DTNB are 6.0 and 7.4 Å, respectively. Based on our sulfhydryl modification results, these measurements suggest that Cys267 is located in a region of the pocket not accessible to molecules or side chains of molecules much larger than 4.0 Å in diameter. Since RA is no greater than 4.0 Å at its carboxylate end and at least 5.0 Å at the β-ionone ring, we can conclude that Cys267 of RARβ is closest to the carboxylate end of RA. This conclusion is supported by the recently published crystal structure of the ligand binding domain of holo-RARγ which demonstrates that the homologous residue of Cys228 (Cys237) is within 4 Å of carbon 13 of RA (15Renaud J.-P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 378: 681-689Google Scholar). In addition, there is only one amino acid residue in the primary sequence between Cys267 and Arg269 of RARβ (Arg278 of RARγ). We have previously shown Arg269 of RARβ to be important for RA binding and retinoid specificity most likely by interaction with the carboxyl group of RA (16Tairis N. Gabriel J.L. Gyda III, M. Soprano K.J. Soprano D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19516-19522Google Scholar, 17Tairis N. Gabriel J.L. Soprano K.J. Soprano D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18380-18387Google Scholar), and the crystal structure of the ligand binding domain of RARγ places Arg278 within 4 Å of the carboxylate oxygen 22 of RA (15Renaud J.-P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 378: 681-689Google Scholar). In the current report we have extended the findings of Dallery et al. (20Dallery N. Sablonniere B. Grillier I. Formstecher P. Dautrevaux M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12428-12436Google Scholar) to demonstrate that RA binding to all three RAR types is blocked similarly by specific sulfhydryl-modifying agents. The concentrations of DTNB and MMTS necessary to inhibit RA binding to RARβ and RARγ are similar to those which have been reported previously for the ligand binding domain of RARα (20Dallery N. Sablonniere B. Grillier I. Formstecher P. Dautrevaux M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12428-12436Google Scholar). The reversibility of this effect by reducing agents demonstrates the specificity of these reactions to sulfhydryl groups. Interestingly, unlike RARα and RARβ, RA binding by RARγ following MMTS treatment was only reversible to about 50% of control binding with the polar reducing agent DTT. However RA binding was restored to near unmodified levels using the hydrophobic reducing agent TBP. This suggests that there is at least one critical Cys residue responsible for inhibition of RA binding upon methanethiolation with MMTS which lies within a more hydrophobic region of RARγ than in RARβ and RARα.

GR modified with MMTS exhibits a bimodal response in which inhibition of ligand binding is maximal both at low and high concentrations of the modifying reagent (36Miller N.R. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15217-15225Google Scholar, 37Stancato L.F. Hutchinson K.A. Chakraborti P.K. Simons S.S. Pratt W.B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3729-3736Google Scholar). It has been determined that this response is a result of intramolecular disulfide bond formation between two closely spaced Cys residues (vicinal dithiols) located in the ligand binding pocket of GR upon treatment with low concentrations of MMTS (36Miller N.R. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15217-15225Google Scholar, 37Stancato L.F. Hutchinson K.A. Chakraborti P.K. Simons S.S. Pratt W.B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3729-3736Google Scholar).

In addition, our sodium arsenite results further support the conclusion that there are no reactive vicinal dithiols in any of the three RARs responsible for inhibition of RA binding. The results of our protection-exchange experiment with RARβ demonstrating that RA binding can protect Cys residues from chemical modification suggests that these critical Cys residue(s) may be located in or near the ligand binding pocket. Protection may result from either the physical blocking of the modifying reagents by RA or a conformational change in the ligand binding domain upon RA binding which blocks the accessibility of the reactive Cys residues to the modification reagents. The latter is more likely based on the work of Renaud et al. (15Renaud J.-P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D.

https://openalex.org/W2061010430,"Vaccinia virus RNA polymerase terminates transcription downstream of a UUUUUNU signal in the nascent RNA. Transduction of the RNA signal to the elongating polymerase requires a termination factor (vaccinia termination factor/capping enzyme) and is coupled to the hydrolysis of ATP. It was shown previously that incorporation of 5-bromouracil or 5-iodouracil within the UUUUUNU element abolishes termination by preventing factor-dependent release of the nascent chain from the polymerase elongation complex. Here, we report that termination is prevented by phosphorothioate substitution at UMP residues in the nascent RNA. In contrast, phosphorothioate substitution at AMP, CMP, and GMP nucleotides does not inhibit termination. Thus, the action of a eukaryotic termination factor entails recognition of the nucleotide bases and the phosphate groups of the target sequence in nascent RNA.

Thus, the action of a eukaryotic termination factor entails recognition of the nucleotide bases and the phosphate groups of the target sequence in nascent RNA. The 3′ ends of vaccinia virus early mRNAs are formed by transcription termination, which is dictated by a cis-acting heptamer sequence UUUUUNU in the nascent RNA chain (1Shuman S. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6220-6225Google Scholar). The termination event occurs at heterogeneous sites downstream of the signal. Site choice is determined by a kinetic balance between the rate of signaling and the rate of chain elongation (2Hagler J. Luo Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10050-10060Google Scholar). Vaccinia RNA polymerase by itself is not responsive to the signal but requires the vaccinia termination factor, VTF/capping enzyme (3Shuman S. Broyles S.S. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12372-12380Google Scholar). 1The abbreviation used is: VTFvaccinia termination factor vaccinia termination factor To understand how information in the nascent RNA is transmitted to an elongating RNA polymerase, the essential structural features of the signal must be delineated. The small size and limited sequence complexity of the vaccinia UUUUUNU motif provides a unique opportunity to accomplish this. A requirement for UMP at every position except the N base was demonstrated initially by mutating the DNA template (4Yuen L. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6417-6421Google Scholar). We have since used RNA modification interference to obtain a more refined view of the signal. The approach is to introduce nucleotide analogs into the nascent RNA and to assess their impact on VTF-dependent termination in vitro. It was shown previously that incorporation of 5-bromouracil or 5-iodouracil within the nascent RNA abolishes VTF-dependent termination, whereas incorporation of 5-bromocytosine or 5-iodocytosine has no effect (1Shuman S. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6220-6225Google Scholar). This suggested that termination signaling involves recognition of the uracil bases within the UUUUUNU element. In this study, we probe the role of the phosphate moieties of the termination signal by incorporating ribonucleoside phosphorothioates during transcription elongation. Ternary transcription complexes containing 32P-labeled nascent RNA were formed as described (2Hagler J. Luo Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10050-10060Google Scholar) in reaction mixtures containing (per 20 μl) 20 mM Tris·HCl (pH 8.0), 6 mM MgCl2, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM ATP, 0.1 mM UTP, 1 μM [α-32P]CTP (1000 Ci/mmol), 0.1 mM 3′-OMeGTP, vaccinia RNA polymerase (heparin agarose fraction containing the vaccinia early transcription initiation factor), and bead-linked G21(TER) or G21(TER29)A78 DNA. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 30°C for 10 min. The beads were concentrated by microcentrifugation for 15 s and then held in place with a magnet while the supernatant was removed and replaced with 0.1 ml of 20 mM Tris·HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mM dithiothreitol. The beads were resuspended and subjected to two further cycles of concentration and washing; after the third wash, the beads were resuspended in a small volume of the wash buffer, and aliquots were distributed into individual reaction tubes to achieve approximately the same concentration of template as that used in the pulse-labeling phase. Elongation reactions (chase phase) were performed in reaction mixtures containing 20 mM Tris·HCl (pH 8.0), 6 mM MgCl2, 2 mM dithiothreitol, and standard NTPs or α-thio-NTPs as specified in the figure legends. The reactions were halted by the addition of a stop solution containing 10 mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 125 μg/ml yeast tRNA, and 4 M urea. The samples were extracted with phenol:chloroform and labeled RNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation. Transcription products were analyzed by electrophoresis through a 17% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and radiolabeled transcripts were visualized by autoradiography. GTPαS, ATPαS, UTPαS, and CTPαS (Sp diastereomers) were purchased from Amersham Corp. An initial series of experiments was conducted to test whether vaccinia RNA polymerase was capable of utilizing α-thio-NTPs as substrates. Chain elongation was assayed during a single round of synthesis on a bead-linked G21(TER) template containing a vaccinia promoter fused to a 20-nucleotide G-less cassette (Fig. 1). Elongation complexes containing 32P-labeled nascent RNA were assembled and purified as described (2Hagler J. Luo Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10050-10060Google Scholar). The complexes were arrested uniquely at the first G position on the template (G21) by incorporation of 3′OMeGMP. The bead-purified G21 transcription complexes hydrolyzed the blocking 3′OMeGMP moiety (10Hagler J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2166-2173Google Scholar) and resumed elongation during a chase in the presence of magnesium and 1 mM of each of the standard NTPs. A 195-nucleotide run-off transcript was produced within 20 s (Fig. 1). The amount of run-off transcript increased over time, concomitant with a decrease in the level of OMeG21 RNA. Note that because transcript shortening was rate-limiting in the chase reaction, the population of halted ternary complexes did not elongate synchronously. A fraction of the polymerases paused transiently at template positions C31 and T34 at the proximal margins of the transcription termination signal (Fig. 1). The full-length RNAs were converted at late times (5-30 min) into a higher molecular weight species (Fig. 1, left panel). These longer transcripts were formed via DNA template-independent 3′ extension of the run-off RNA by the vaccinia RNA polymerase. 2L. Deng and S. Shuman, unpublished observations. GTPαS, ATPαS, UTPαS, and CTPαS were accepted as substrates for chain elongation when substituted singly for the standard NTPs (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). CTPαS had no detectable impact on the kinetics of elongation (Fig. 2). The other α-thiophosphate derivatives slowed chain elongation slightly by increasing polymerase dwell time at specific template positions. GTPαS substitution enhanced intrinsic pausing at C31 (immediately 5′ of a G at position 32) and induced a cluster of pause sites near the 3′ end of the template (Fig. 1). However, full-length RNAs were still evident at 20 s, and nearly all pause sites were traversed by 40 s. ATPαS enhanced pausing at a distinct set of distal sites that were traversed by 2 min (Fig. 1). UTPαS increased pausing at T33 and T34 within the T-run and at discrete downstream positions (Fig. 2). Full-length transcripts did not appear until 40 s; nonetheless, virtually all polymerases traversed the distal pause sites by 2 min. The effects of phosphorothioate substitution on transcription termination are shown in Fig. 3. Pulse-labeled G21 ternary complexes were chased for 10 min in the presence or the absence of VTF. In control reactions containing 1 mM each of the standard NTPs, VTF induced the appearance of a heterogeneous array of transcripts terminated between about 40 and 100 nucleotides downstream of the first U residue of the UUUUUNU signal (denoted by T in Fig. 3). GTPαS, ATPαS, and CTPαS altered the distribution of termination sites but did not diminish the extent of VTF-induced termination. Indeed, termination was actually enhanced by these analogs. In contrast, UTPαS prevented factor-dependent termination by vaccinia RNA polymerase (Fig. 3, lane 8). We showed previously that termination site choice reflects a kinetic balance between the rate of polymerase elongation and the rate at which the signal is transduced to the ternary complex (2Hagler J. Luo Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10050-10060Google Scholar). VTF preferentially induces termination at transcriptional pause sites, at least under reaction conditions where pausing can be discerned, e.g. in the presence of nucleotide analogs (2Hagler J. Luo Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10050-10060Google Scholar). The observed shifts in termination site preferences in the presence of 1 mM GTPαS, ATPαS, and CTPαS were consistent with their position-specific effects on polymerase dwell time. A kinetic analysis of elongation in the presence and the absence of VTF showed that the sites of VTF-induced termination in reactions containing ATPαS corresponded to sites of analog-induced pausing (not shown). Incorporation of the α-thio-nucleotides by RNA polymerase results in inversion of chirality at the α-phosphorus from the Sp configuration of the NTP precursor to an Rp diastereomer of the NMP in the RNA chain (5Eckstein F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 367-402Google Scholar). The results of Fig. 3 make clear that the presence of Rp thiophosphates 5′ of A, G, or C residues has no effect on termination signal recognition, whereas an Rp thiophosphate 5′ of U residues abrogated VTF-dependent termination. We infer that Rp thiophosphate substitution within the UUUUUNU signal was the basis for this effect. The experiment in Fig. 4 focuses on the effects of α-thio-UMP incorporation on the transcript release step of the termination reaction. Our strategy was to purify RNA-labeled ternary complexes paused at G21, then “walk” the RNA polymerase through an A-less cassette to a defined template position (A78) located 50 nucleotides downstream of the first U residue of a UUUUUUUUU termination signal, and then test for the release of the RNA from the ternary complex in response to VTF/capping enzyme. This assay system eliminates ongoing elongation as a variable. We demonstrated previously that release of the A78 nascent RNA requires the UUUUUNU signal, VTF, and an adenosine nucleotide energy cofactor (6Deng L. Hagler J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19556-19562Google Scholar). We also showed that VTF-dependent release is blocked by bromo-UMP substitution within the termination signal (6Deng L. Hagler J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19556-19562Google Scholar). Pulse-labeled G21 complexes were walked to A78 on the G21(TER29)A78 template in chase reactions containing CTP, GTP, 3′ dATP, and either UTP or UTPαS (Fig. 4). The arrested complexes were then challenged with VTF, and the bead-bound and free RNAs were separated. 70% of the A78 RNA was released in the control reaction, compared with only 9% in reactions containing UTPαS (Fig. 4). Thus, thiophosphate substitution at U residues interfered with transcript release. We surmise from these experiments that recognition of the phosphate moieties of the UUUUUNU signal is essential for termination signal transduction. The substitution of a nonbridging oxygen by sulfur can viewed as a minimal structural alteration of the RNA signal (7Heidenreich O. Pieken W. Eckstein F. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 90-96Google Scholar). The net charge on the phosphates is unaltered, and no bulky substituents are introduced. Rather, the negative charge in the phosphorothioate becomes preferentially localized on the sulfur (7Heidenreich O. Pieken W. Eckstein F. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 90-96Google Scholar). Phosphorothioate interference with termination implies that the phosphates within the UUUUUNU element interact directly with a protein. Alternatively, the phosphates may coordinate an essential metal ion. We have now documented four physical constraints to RNA signal recognition during transcription termination by vaccinia RNA polymerase. These are: (i) the phosphates must be unperturbed (this study), (ii) the uracil bases must be unmodified (1Shuman S. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6220-6225Google Scholar, 6Deng L. Hagler J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19556-19562Google Scholar), (iii) the UUUUUNU signal must be single-stranded (8Luo Y. Shuman S. Virology. 1991; 185: 432-436Google Scholar), and (iv) the UUUUUNU element must be extruded from the RNA binding site on the polymerase (6Deng L. Hagler J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19556-19562Google Scholar). VTF is known to be in contact with the nascent RNA chain even prior to synthesis of the UUUUUNU sequence (2Hagler J. Luo Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10050-10060Google Scholar). We suggest that the encounter of VTF with the unperturbed termination signal as it is extruded from RNA polymerase elicits a conformational change in VTF that is transmitted to the elongation complex, leading to transcript release by RNA polymerase. The nature of the conformational change and its connection to ATP hydrolysis remain to be defined."
