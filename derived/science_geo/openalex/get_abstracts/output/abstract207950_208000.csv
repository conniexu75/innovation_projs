https://openalex.org/W2009960736,"The spinal distribution of the corticospinal fibers was studied experimentally in infant rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) by means of the NautaGygax silver impregnation technique. The findings suggest that the bulk of the direct cortico-motoneuronal connections in the rhesus monkey are established postnatally, during at least the first 8 months of life."

Polyunsaturated fatty acids are absent from the newly synthesized triglycerides."

The alternation of sleep and wakefulness electrical activity in the permanently isolated forebrain is contrasted with the observations of Bremer in the acute ""cerveau isolé"" preparation."

https://openalex.org/W119171791,"Kunitz (3) crystallized pancreatic deoxyribonucleasel and studied its kinetics and the products of its action on deoxyribonucleic acid. With a ratio of enzyme to substrate not higher than 1: 500, the products obtained after exhaustive digestion had an average length of a tetranucleotide. Studies from this and Sinsheimer’s laboratory (for details see the recent review (4)), showed that the digest thus obtained represented a complex mixture of fragments varying in length from mononucleotides to at least o&a-, possibly dodecanucleotides. The attempts to redigest larger oligonucleotides (by the use of a low enzyme-substrate ratio) into smaller fragments failed (5). It was therefore assumed that the digest thus obtained is a “limit digest” and that it is composed of fragments containing only internucleotide linkages which are totally resistant to the action of DNase I. Hurst (6) and Hurst and Fmdlay (7) observed that with a very large amount of enzyme (ratio of enzyme to substrate of the order 1: lo), at pH 8.0, in the presence of ethylenediaminetetraacetate and Mn++, the hydrolysis proceeds beyond the “limit digest” stage. To explain their findings, Hurst and Findlay (7) postulated that crystalline DNase I contains still another enzyme, an oligonucleotidase, which is capable of hydrolyzing oligonucleotides present in the “liiit digest” into smaller fragments, as measured by solubility in a uranyl acetate reagent. Independently, in the previous paper of this series (2), it was observed that when oligonucleotides carrying monoesterified phosphate on carbon 3’ were digested with very high amounts of DNase I, the predominant products were derivatives of dinucleotides. The hypothesis was advanced (2) that dinucleotides represent an ultimate product of the action of DNase I on deoxyribonucleic acid and that an apparent end point (“limit digest”) is caused by an insufficient amount of enzyme and by product inhibition. Thus, an alternative explanation was suggested, without postulating"

https://openalex.org/W1977244319,"Employing response rate as the index of reinforcing strength in self-stimulation experiments is questioned. With water reward or shock avoidance placed in competition with brain stimulation, self-stimulation rate does not reflect relative reinforcement value. The results agree with preference tests which show that, for a given electrode site, stimulus intensity, not rate, is directly related to reward strength."

The analytical methods for assay of these pigments were examined closely and found to be adequate for this purpose when proper safeguards are taken."

https://openalex.org/W1993725810,"IN 1957 Smithies1, using the technique of starch-gel electrophoresis, described inherited variants of human β-globulins. Smithies and Hiller2 established the identity of these β-globulins with the iron-binding protein, trans-ferrin, and this was afterwards confirmed with iron-59 and autoradiography3. During the past few years widespread sampling of human populations has demonstrated the existence so far of 14 transferrins. In order of decreasing mobility in starch-gel electrophoresis these are4: B0, BO–1 B1, B1–2, B2, B3, C, D0, D4 (D0–1), Dmontreal Dchi, D1, D2, D3. The present communication reports another transferrin of the B series."

https://openalex.org/W2089208467,"The density distribution of nerve endings in the wall of the extrapulmonary portion of the cat's pulmonary artery was studied in serial sections after staining by a supravital methylene blue procedure. The greatest concentration of endings occurred at the bifurcation, in the adjacent parts of the pulmonary artery, and in its right and left main branches. The morphology and distribution of these endings is consistent with a pressoreceptor function."

However, the clot formed from ordinary fraction-I, or even from highly purified fibrinogen, is generally heavily contaminated by plasminogen; this interferes with the protease content of the test solution."

https://openalex.org/W2014289001,"THE extirpation of the regional lymph node doubles the survival-time of a cutaneous homograft on the ear of a rabbit1,2. If we perform an indirect colour lymphography before and after extirpation, we can observe a further node which is connected to the lymphatic system within 2 weeks and which previously did not belong to this collecting area3."
https://openalex.org/W2035817304,"IMMUNITY against homografts can be adoptively transplanted by cells from the regional lymph nodes or from the spleen1. This leads us to believe that antibodies produced by tissue incompatibility are produced only in these tissues. Extirpation of the regional nodes on the side of the graft only prolongs the survival of the homograft because of the temporary interruption of the lymphatic connexion2–5. According to Streicher and Herion, splenectomy in no way influences the survival of grafts6. In our experiments we investigated the survival-time of secondary grafts following extirpation of regional lymph nodes on the side of the primary graft, and following splenectomy."
https://openalex.org/W1982974949,"Saz and Marmur1 and Saz and Slie2 have reported that the nitro-reductase system in a strain of Escherichia coli is sensitive to aureomycin. Saz, Brownell and Slie3 isolated a mutant of the organism which was resistant to the antibiotic and found that the nitro-reductase system of the mutant was also resistant to high concentrations of the drug. Now an investigation has been made of the sensitivity to aureomycin of the nitro-reductase enzyme system in Nocardia V.4. The growth of Nocardia is inhibited by concentrations of aureomycin as low as 1 µgm./ml. The cell-free nitro-reductase system isolated from the organism was not, however, sensitive to inhibition by aureomycin whether reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide or diphosphopyridine nucleotide plus dehydrogenase substrate was used as hydrogen donor."

https://openalex.org/W2081438286,"VARIATIONS in the mean content of deoxyribo-nucleic acid (DNA) in the nuclei correlated with cell-activity has been observed in several organs1: thyroid gland2, interstitial cells of the testis3, medulla4 and cortex5 of the adrenal gland. Stimulation of cell activity appeared to be accompanied by an increase, an inhibition of cell activity by a decrease, of the nuclear DNA. These results were obtained by comparing control animals with test animals, which had previously been subjected to 14 days of experimental conditions. Also for a shorter period, considerable changes of the DNA content can occur, such as has been demonstrated, in relation to the sex cycle (5 days) of the female rat, in vaginal epithelium6, granulosa cells in the ovary7, and adrenal cortex8."
