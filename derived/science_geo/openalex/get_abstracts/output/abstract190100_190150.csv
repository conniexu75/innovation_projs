https://openalex.org/W1522888688,"Continuing our work on the incorporation of labeled amino acids into proteins (1), we have begun a study of the incorporation in vitro of C14-labeled glycine, L-histidine, L-leucine, and L-lysine into the proteins of rabbit reticulocytes. In preliminary experiments the incorporation into the hemoglobin isolated from the reticulocytes was determined. But, after it was found that plasma contains factors accelerating amino acid incorporation, it was decided to proceed as rapidly as possible toward the identification of these factors; we have, therefore, measured incorporation into the total proteins of the reticulocytes, since isolation of the hemoglobin was time-consuming. The results obtained with hemoglobin and with the total proteins are essentially the same, indicating that the other proteins of the reticulocytes incorporate amino acids at approximately the same rate as hemoglobin."

https://openalex.org/W1502482146,"Pyruvate oxidation in bacterial extracts has been studied by several authors (l-7). Flavin-adenine dinucleotide, cocarboxylase, phosphate, and Mg ++ are required for activity in preparations from Lactobacillus delbrueck
ii (l-3) and from Escherichia coli (5). The nature of the primary intermediates in these oxidations is not fully understood. Less is known about pyruvate oxidation in animal tissues. Stumpf et al. (8) were able to obtain a particulate preparation from pigeon breast muscle which catalyzed the oxidation of pyruvate to acetate and carbon dioxide. In the present series of papers, the further purification of this enzyme, its physicochemical properties, and the factors implicated in its activity are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W34674970,"Over the last two decades much evidence of an indirect nature has suggested that nucleic acids may be controlling factors in protein synthesis. A number of workers, notably Caspersson and Schultz (1, 2), Brachet (3), and Thorell (4), have shown that high concentrations of ribose nucleic acid are found in embryonic and neoplastic tissues. Although in many cases no direct measurements were made on the amount of protein synthesis, it was reasonably assumed that the types of tissues used were actively synthesizing protein. Spiegelman and Kamen (5) have raised the objection as to whether the correlation between the amount of ribose nucleic acid and protein synthesis was of any real value in determining the effect of nucleic acids on protein synthesis. They pointed out that equally good correlations can be obtained between protein synthesis and other phosphate fractions. Thorell (4), using bone marrow tissue, claimed evidence for the existence of different phases during the formation of protein in red blood cells, with correlated changes in the ribose nucleic acid. It has been shown by Borsook et al. (6) that reticulocytes, but not erythrocytes, rapidly incorporate radioactive amino acids. This suggested the possibility of measuring simultaneously both amino acid incorporation and nucleic acid content in a system in which both could be expected to be undergoing rapid change."

https://openalex.org/W1574311810,"The intermediates of carbon dioxide reduction by plants include phosphorylated derivatives of hydroxy acids and sugars. Their identification becane possible when the use of labeled carbon dioxide permitted discrimination between the earliest products and the many other components of photosynthetic tissues. A number of compounds were identified by virtue of the chemical and physical properties of the radioactive compounds in tracer amounts and by direct comparison of these properties with those of suspected known metabolic intermediates. It became apparent that several labeled compounds found in short exposures to radioactive carbon dioxide were not substances previously identified as metabolic intermediates. Two phosphate esters in particular were observed in the products of the first few seconds of steady-state photosynthesis by all the photosynthetic microorganisms and higher plants examined in this laboratory. These esters have been isolated by paper chromatography in tracer quantities and enzymatically hydrolyzed to give two sugars, ribulose and sedoheptulose. This paper contains a description of the chemical identification of these sugars and some observations and suggestions regarding the function of their esters. The general importance of these compounds in photosynthesis was surmized before their identification. The products of photosynthesis with C{sup 14}O{sub 2} by each plant included phosphate estersmore » of the same two then unknown compounds in addition to those of the expected glucose, fructose, dihydroxyacetone and glyceric acid. As the time of steady-state photosynthesis in C{sup 14}O{sub 2} decreased, the fractions of total fixed radiocarbon in the esters of the two unidentified compounds increased.« less"
