https://openalex.org/W1502449443,"Infection of macrophage lineage cells is a feature of primate lentivirus replication, and several properties of primate lentiviruses seem to have evolved to promote the infection of macrophages. Here we demonstrate that the accessory gene product Nef induces the production of two CC-chemokines, macrophage inflammatory proteins 1alpha and 1beta, by HIV-1-infected macrophages. Adenovirus-mediated expression of Nef in primary macrophages was sufficient for chemokine induction. Supernatants from Nef-expressing macrophages induced both the chemotaxis and activation of resting T lymphocytes, permitting productive HIV-1 infection. These results indicate a role for Nef in lymphocyte recruitment and activation at sites of virus replication."

https://openalex.org/W2060002498,"It has been suggested that DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) is a central component of DNA double-strand-break repair. The mechanism of DNA-PK action, however, has not been fully understood. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) is another nuclear enzyme which has high affinity to DNA ends. In this study, we analysed the interaction between these two enzymes. First, DNA-PK was found to suppress the PARP activity and alters the pattern of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. Although DNA-PK phosphorylates PARP in a DNA-dependent manner, this modification is unlikely to be responsible for the suppression of PARP activity, since this suppression occurs even in the absence of ATP. Conversely, PARP was found to ADP-ribosylate DNA-PK in vitro. However, the auto-phosphorylation activity of DNA-PK was not influenced by this modification. In a competitive electrophoretic mobility shift assay, Ku 70/80 complex, the DNA binding component of DNA-PK, was found to have higher affinity to a short fragment of DNA than does PARP. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation analysis suggested direct or close association between Ku and PARP. Thus, DNA-PK suppresses PARP activity, probably through direct binding and/or sequestration of DNA-ends which serve as an important stimulator for both enzymes."

This mechanism has also been proposed for translocations t(4;11)(q21;q23), which are regularly associated with acute pro-B cell leukemias in early childhood. Here, reciprocal chromosomal breakpoints in primary biopsy material of fourteen t(4;11)-leukemia patients were analysed. In all cases, duplications, deletions and inversions of less than a few hundred nucleotides indicative of malfunctioning DNA repair mechanisms were observed. We concluded that these translocation events were initiated by several DNA strand breaks on both participating chromosomes and subsequent DNA repair by 'error-prone-repair' mechanisms, but not by the action of recombinases of the immune system."

However, the function of cyclin G has not been established. To determine the effect of increased expression of cyclin G, retroviruses encoding cyclin G were constructed and used to infect three different murine cell lines. Cyclin G protein levels induced by the retroviruses were within the range seen after DNA damage induction of p53. In each case we observed that such over-expression of cyclin G augments the apoptotic process. TNF-alpha induction of apoptosis is increased by expression of cyclin G in NIH3T3 fibroblasts which express p53, as well as in 10.1 fibroblasts which contain no p53 allele. Additionally, we observed that while cyclin G expression is markedly reduced upon aggregate formation in embryonic carcinoma P19 cells, retrovirus-mediated over-expression of cyclin G enhances apoptotic cell death in aggregated P19 cells, and increases the extent of apoptosis caused by retinoic acid or serum starvation of these cells. These data demonstrate that cyclin G plays a facilitating role in modulating apoptosis induced by different stimuli. Moreover, we have discovered that cyclin G expression is rapidly induced in P19 cells after exposure to Bone Morphogenic Protein-4 (BMP-4), suggesting that cyclin G may mediate apoptotic signals generated by BMP-4."

https://openalex.org/W2062514032,"The Trk/Nerve Growth Factor receptor mediates the rapid activation of a number of intracellular signaling proteins, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). Here, we describe a novel, NGF-inducible system that we used to specifically address the signaling potential of endogenous PI 3-kinase in NGF-mediated neuronal survival and differentiation processes. This system utilizes a Trk receptor mutant (Trkdef) lacking sequences Y490, Y785 and KFG important for the activation of the major Trk targets; SHC, PLC-Î³l, Ras, PI 3-kinase and SNT. Trkdef was kinase active but defective for NGF-induced responses when stably expressed in PC12nnr5 cells (which lack detectable levels of TrkA and are non-responsive to NGF). The PI 3-kinase consensus binding site, YxxM (YVPM), was introduced into the insert region within the kinase domain of Trkdef. NGF-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the Trkdef+PI 3-kinase addback receptor, resulted in the direct association and selective activation of PI 3-kinase in vitro and the production of PI(3,4)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3 in vivo (comparable to wild-type). PC12nnr5 cells stably expressing Trkdef+PI 3-kinase, initiated neurite outgrowth but failed to stably extend and maintain these neurites in response to NGF as compared to PC12 parental cells, or PC12nnr5 cells overexpressing wild-type Trk. However, Trkdef+PI 3-kinase was fully competent in mediating NGF-induced survival processes. We propose that while endogenous PI 3-kinase can contribute in part to neurite initiation processes, its selective activation and subsequent signaling to downstream effectors such as Akt, functions mainly to promote cell survival in the PC12 system."
https://openalex.org/W2323045106,"Cdc25 A and B are dual-specificity phosphatases which have been implicated in neoplastic transformation. Although Cdc25A and Cdc25B have been found to be over-expressed in many cancer cell lines and primary tumors, the physiological roles of Cdc25A and B in vivo are largely undefined. To investigate the roles of these proteins in the oncogenic transformation of the mammary gland we used the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter to target over-expression of the Cdc25B transgene in the mammary glands of transgenic mouse lines. Here we report that the over-expression of Cdc25B enhances the proliferation of mammary epithelial cells resulting in the formation of precocious alveolar hyperplasia. At the molecular level, marked increases in cyclin D1 protein have been found in transgenic mammary epithelial cells. The accelerated growth rate of the mammary epithelial cells could also be attributed to the increased levels of cyclin E/cdk2 activity. In addition, a pronounced decrease in apoptosis was also observed during the involution of mammary gland. The reduction of apoptosis during involution correlated well with the reduced expression of c-myc and p53, both of which have been implicated in apoptosis. Taken together, our results clearly indicate that the deregulated expression of Cdc25B generates mammary gland hyperplasia."

https://openalex.org/W2315825931,"Overproduction of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and metalloproteases (MMPs) is strongly correlated with tumorigenicity and with invasive and metastatic phenotypes of human and experimental tumors. We demonstrated previously that overproduction of uPA in tumor cells is mediated by a phospholipase D (PLD)- and protein kinase C-dependent mechanism. The oncogenic stimulus of v-Src and v-Ras results in the activation of PLD, which is dependent upon the monomeric GTPase RalA. We have therefore investigated whether RalA plays a role in uPA and MMP overproduction that is observed in response to oncogenic signals. We report here that NIH3T3 cells transformed by both v-Src and v-Ras, constitutively overproduce uPA and that expression of a dominant negative RalA mutant (S28N) blocks overproduction of uPA in both the v-Src-and v-Ras-transformed cells. v-Src and v-Ras also induced an upregulation of the activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 as detected by zymograms, however only the v-Src induction correlated with MMP protein levels detected by Western blot analysis. The dominant negative RalA mutant blocked increased MMP-2 and 9 overproduction induced by v-Src, but not the increased activity of MMP-2 and 9 induced by v-Ras. And, consistent with a role for the RalA/PLD pathway in mitogenesis and tumor development, the dominant negative RalA mutant completely blocked tumor formation by v-Src- and v-Ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells injected subcutaneously in syngeneic mice. The data presented here implicate RalA and PLD as signaling mediators for tumor formation and protease production by transformed cells."

https://openalex.org/W2313475712,"The CDK9 kinase in association with Cyclin T is a component of the transcription positive-acting complex pTEFb which facilitates the transition from abortive to productive transcription elongation by phosphorylating the carboxyl-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II. The Cyclin T1/CDK9 complex is implicated in Tat transactivation, and it has been suggested that Tat functions by recruiting this complex to RNAPII through cooperative binding to RNA. Here, we demonstrate that targeted recruitment of Cyclin T1/CDK9 kinase complex to specific promoters, through fusion to a DNA-binding domain of either Cyclin T1 or CDK9 kinase, stimulates transcription in vivo. Transcriptional enhancement was dependent on active CDK9, as a catalytically inactive form had no transcriptional effect. We determined that, unlike conventional activators, DNA-bound CDK9 does not activate enhancerless TATA-promoters unless TBP is overexpressed, suggesting that CDK9 acts in vivo at a step subsequent to TFIID recruitment DNA-bound. Finally, we determined that CDK9-mediated transcriptional activation is mediated by preferentially stimulating productive transcription elongation."
https://openalex.org/W2331427336,"The tumor suppressor gene product p53 can bind to and inhibit the helicase activity of the multisubunit transcription-repair factor TFIIH. We previously reported that p53-mediated apoptosis is attenuated in primary human fibroblasts from individuals with Xeroderma Pigmentosum (XP) that harbor mutations in the TFIIH DNA helicases XPD or XPB. In this study we show that apoptosis is reduced and delayed in three XPD lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), but not in an XPD heterozygote LCL, after exposure to doxorubicin, a DNA-damaging agent and topoisomerase II inhibitor frequently used in cancer therapy. Apoptosis was assessed by quantitation of Annexin V binding to exposed phosphatidylserine residues and by caspase-mediated cleavage of Poly(ADP)Ribose Polymerase (PARP). Apoptosis induced by doxorubicin was suppressed in LCLs retrovirally transduced with the Human Papillomavirus 16 E6 oncoprotein, consistent with the hypothesis that this is a p53-dependent process. PARP cleavage was not delayed in XPD LCLs in response to anti-Fas (CD95) antibody-mediated apoptosis, thus, the defect in the apoptotic pathway in these cells lies upstream of caspase activation. Similar changes in the expression of apoptosis-effector genes, p53, and p53-responsive genes p21Cip1/WAF-1/Sid1 (p21), gadd45, bcl-2 and bax were observed in normal and XPD LCLs after treatment with doxorubicin, indicating that delayed apoptosis was not a consequence of defective transcription of these genes. Thus, our studies provide further support to the hypothesis that XPD and p53 can functionally interact in a p53-mediated apoptotic pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2060413800,"Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) involving the distal part of the short arm of chromosome 1 occurs frequently in ovarian adenocarcinomas but the tumour suppressor gene(s) targeted by this event is unknown. We have used five microsatellite markers in a panel of 56 ovarian adenocarcinomas to determine which part of 1p34 - 36 is the focus of this LOH. LOH was considerably more common at 1p36 (43%) than at 1p34 - 35 (18%), and 11 tumours showed LOH at 1p36 but not at 1p34 - 35. These data strongly suggest the presence of a tumour suppressor gene inactivated in ovarian adenocarcinoma at 1p36. The p53 homologue, p73, has recently been isolated and mapped to 1p36 and therefore is a candidate for this tumour suppressor gene. However, RT - PCR and Western analyses revealed strong expression of p73 in ovarian adenocarcinoma cell lines but very low or undetectable levels in normal ovarian surface epithelial cells. Immunohistochemical analysis of primary ovarian tumours showed that only 3/22 (14%) contained p73 expressing cells. There was no association between 1p36 LOH and p73 expression in ovarian tumours, nor between p73 and p53 expression. These findings strongly suggest that p73 is not the target of 1p36 LOH in ovarian adenocarcinomas but indicate the presence of an, as yet unidentified, tumour suppressor gene in this region that plays an important role in ovarian tumorigenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2313011289,"The mi locus encodes a member of the basic â helix â loop â helix â leucine zipper (bHLH-Zip) protein family of transcription factors (hereafter called MITF). Although the bHLH-Zip family transcription factors generally recognize and bind CANNTG motifs, the expression of mouse mast cell protease 6 (MMCP-6) gene is regulated by MITF through the GACCTG motif in the promoter region. The GACCTG motif was partly overlapped the TGTGGTC sequence, which was bound by polyomavirus enhancer binding protein 2 (PEBP2). In the present study, the effect of PEBP2 on the expression of MMCP-6 gene was examined. PEBP2 that is composed of Î± and Î² subunits was expressed by mast cell lines and cultured mast cells derived from spleen. The overexpression of dominant negative PEBP2 cDNA reduced the expression of MMCP-6. Moreover, the simultaneous transfection of the plasmid containing MITF cDNA and the plasmid containing PEBP2 cDNA increased the MMCP-6 promoter activity. For the synergistic action of PEBP2 and MITF, the intact GACCTG and TGTGGTC motifs were prerequisite. The PEBP2Î±B1 mutant which lacked the region downstream from the Runt domain did not bind MITF and lost the synergistic function. These results indicated that PEBP2 and MITF synergistically transactivated the MMCP-6 gene and that the region downstream from the Runt domain of PEBP2Î±B1 was essential for the physical and functional interactions with MITF."

https://openalex.org/W2034429144,"Sam68 is a 68 kDa protein that associates with and is phosphorylated by the c-Src kinase at mitosis. It contains a KH domain implicated in RNA binding and several proline-rich motifs that resemble known SH3 binding sites. The SH3 domains of c-Src, phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase, phospholipase C-Î³ and Grb2 protein (containing two SH3 domains), but not other SH3 domains tested, were capable of binding Sam68 in vitro. Synthetic peptides corresponding to the proline motifs of Sam68 inhibited with different efficiencies the binding of SH3 domains to Sam68 suggesting that the proline motifs of Sam68 function as specific SH3 domain binding sites. Mutation of Sam68 SH3 binding sites further indicated that the SRC SH3 domain mediates binding of Src to unphosphorylated Sam68. Phosphorylation of Sam68 by Src kinase was inhibited when the Src SH3 binding site of Sam68 was mutated or when corresponding peptides were added to in vitro kinase reactions indicating that binding of the Src SH3 domain to a specific site near the amino-terminus of Sam68 (including residues 38 â 45: PPLPHRSR) facilitates phosphorylation of Sam68 by the Src kinase domain. Sam68-based proline peptides had no effect on the phosphorylation of another in vitro substrate of Src, enolase. These results suggest that Src effectively mounts Sam68 through its SH3 domain, possibly as a mechanism to position the kinase domain close to substrate tyrosine residues in the carboxyl-half of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W2323502005,"P27, an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases, plays an important role in the control of cell adhesion and contact inhibition-dependent cell cycle regulation. Hepatocytes, maintained in primary culture, offer a model of synchronized primary epithelial cells which retain a differentiated profile while stimulated to proliferate. We therefore investigated the pattern of endogenous p27 expression in cyclin rat hepatocytes isolated by collagenase perfusion followed by mitogenic stimulation. P27 was expressed in whole normal liver and freshly isolated hepatocytes. We then observed a sharp decrease in p27 levels, concomitant with the progression in early-mid G1, followed by reaccumulation in late G1 and the G1/S transition. Immunochemistry and BrdU labelling demonstrated nuclear localization of p27 and its expression in cells engaged in both G1 and S phase. P27 was detected in late G1 in complexes containing cyclins D1, E and A. Cyclin E- and A-associated kinase activities, however, were detected at the G1/S transition and depletion experiments confirmed that most active complexes were free of p27. Phosphorylated forms of p27 were detected in unstimulated and stimulated hepatocytes in both early-mid G1 and G1/S. Finally, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed evidence for several forms of p27 with a distinct profile of distribution in quiescent and stimulated hepatocytes. Collectively, our data offer a model in which p27 shows a biphasic profile of accumulation, with the early decrease possibly involved in the progression through early and mid G1. In contrast with most cell types tested so far, the late G1 accumulation did not impair formation of active cyclin E- and A associated kinases, and thus G1/S transition."

https://openalex.org/W2315656698,"The tumour suppressor p53 plays a complex role in the regulation of apoptosis. High levels of wild type p53 potentiate the apoptotic response, while physiological range, low levels of the protein have an anti-apoptotic activity in serum starved immortalized fibroblasts. Here we report that primary fibroblast-like cells that show normal growth control are also efficiently protected from apoptosis by the endogenous p53 activity. The capacity to inhibit apoptosis is not restricted to the wild type protein: the R-->H175 p53 mutant fully retains the anti-apoptotic activity of the wild type p53, providing a possible explanation for its high oncogenicity. Using a series of point and deletion mutants of p53 under the control of tetracycline-regulated promoter we show that certain mutants, like the wild type, protect cells at low levels but lead to apoptosis when overexpressed. This latter effect is lost upon deletion of a proline-rich domain in the NH2 part of the protein. The anti-apoptotic activity can be mapped to the extreme carboxy-terminal part of the protein and is therefore independent of other well characterized p53 activities. Our results add a new level of complexity to the network of interactions mediated by p53 in normal physiology and pathology."

https://openalex.org/W2324365728,"The human IGF2 gene belongs to a group of imprinted genes clustered on the short arm of chromosome 11, band p15.5. It contains 9 exons and spans over 30 kb. IGF2 mRNA overexpression has been reported in human tumours and in some inherited growth disorders. It was recently demonstrated that IGF2 mRNA overexpression contributes to tumour progression and that loss of parental imprinting as well as altered transcription factors are contributing to this overexpression. We have reported structural alterations in the 3' region of the IGF2 gene in two colorectal tumours that overexpressed the IGF2 transcript by 200- and 800-fold. We cloned by the vectorette-PCR strategy, genomic DNA fragments containing the breakpoints from these tumours. The sequencing of these fragments positioned the breakpoint 2 kb downstream the IGF2 gene in one tumour, and in exon 9 in the second. Both breakpoints occurred in regions containing repetitive elements: a TGGA repeat we have identified downstream the gene, and the (CA)n repetition in exon 9. We hypothesize that a negative regulatory element, located downstream the IGF2 gene, has been deleted following these structural alterations and leads to IGF2 gene overexpression."
