https://openalex.org/W1988372369,"Cold-stimulated adaptive thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue (BAT) to increase energy expenditure is suggested as a possible therapeutic target for the treatment of obesity. We have recently shown high prevalence of BAT in adult humans, which was inversely related to body mass index (BMI) and body fat percentage (BF%), suggesting that obesity is associated with lower BAT activity. Here, we examined BAT activity in morbidly obese subjects and its role in cold-induced thermogenesis (CIT) after applying a personalized cooling protocol. We hypothesize that morbidly obese subjects show reduced BAT activity upon cold exposure.After applying a personalized cooling protocol for maximal non-shivering conditions, BAT activity was determined using positron-emission tomography and computed tomography (PET-CT). Cold-induced BAT activity was detected in three out of 15 morbidly obese subjects. Combined with results from lean to morbidly obese subjects (n = 39) from previous study, the collective data show a highly significant correlation between BAT activity and body composition (P<0.001), respectively explaining 64% and 60% of the variance in BMI (r = 0.8; P<0.001) and BF% (r = 0.75; P<0.001). Obese individuals demonstrate a blunted CIT combined with low BAT activity. Only in BAT-positive subjects (n = 26) mean energy expenditure was increased significantly upon cold exposure (51.5±6.7 J/s versus 44.0±5.1 J/s, P = 0.001), and the increase was significantly higher compared to BAT-negative subjects (+15.5±8.9% versus +3.6±8.9%, P = 0.001), indicating a role for BAT in CIT in humans.This study shows that in an extremely large range of body compositions, BAT activity is highly correlated with BMI and BF%. BAT-positive subjects showed higher CIT, indicating that BAT is also in humans involved in adaptive thermogenesis. Increasing BAT activity could be a therapeutic target in (morbid) obesity."
https://openalex.org/W1997267143,"It is usually considered that larger brains have larger neurons, which consume more energy individually, and are therefore accompanied by a larger number of glial cells per neuron. These notions, however, have never been tested. Based on glucose and oxygen metabolic rates in awake animals and their recently determined numbers of neurons, here I show that, contrary to the expected, the estimated glucose use per neuron is remarkably constant, varying only by 40% across the six species of rodents and primates (including humans). The estimated average glucose use per neuron does not correlate with neuronal density in any structure. This suggests that the energy budget of the whole brain per neuron is fixed across species and brain sizes, such that total glucose use by the brain as a whole, by the cerebral cortex and also by the cerebellum alone are linear functions of the number of neurons in the structures across the species (although the average glucose consumption per neuron is at least 10× higher in the cerebral cortex than in the cerebellum). These results indicate that the apparently remarkable use in humans of 20% of the whole body energy budget by a brain that represents only 2% of body mass is explained simply by its large number of neurons. Because synaptic activity is considered the major determinant of metabolic cost, a conserved energy budget per neuron has several profound implications for synaptic homeostasis and the regulation of firing rates, synaptic plasticity, brain imaging, pathologies, and for brain scaling in evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2051099720,"<h3>NADH</h3> ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) is a major source of reactive oxygen species in mitochondria and a contributor to cellular oxidative stress. In isolated complex I the reduced flavin is known to react with molecular oxygen to form predominantly superoxide, but studies using intact mitochondria contend that superoxide may result from a semiquinone species that responds to the proton-motive force (Δp) also. Here, we use bovine heart submitochondrial particles to show that a single mechanism describes superoxide production by complex I under all conditions (during both NADH oxidation and reverse electron transfer). NADH-induced superoxide production is inhibited by complex I flavin-site inhibitors but not by inhibitors of ubiquinone reduction, and it is independent of Δp. Reverse electron transfer (RET) through complex I in submitochondrial particles, driven by succinate oxidation and the Δp created by ATP hydrolysis, reduces the flavin, leading to NAD<sup>+</sup> and O<sub>2</sub> reduction. RET-induced superoxide production is inhibited by both flavin-site and ubiquinone-reduction inhibitors. The potential dependence of NADH-induced superoxide production (set by the NAD<sup>+</sup> potential) matches that of RET-induced superoxide production (set by the succinate potential and Δp), and they both match the potential dependence of the flavin. Therefore, both NADH- and RET-induced superoxide are produced by the flavin, according to the same molecular mechanism. The unified mechanism describes how reactive oxygen species production by complex I responds to changes in cellular conditions. It establishes a route to understanding causative connections between the enzyme and its pathological effects and to developing rational strategies for addressing them."

Neutral lipid lipases act at the oil/water interface. In mammalian cells, LD surfaces are coated with one or more members of the perilipin protein family, which serve important functions in regulating lipolysis. We investigated mechanisms by which three perilipin proteins control lipolysis by adipocyte triglyceride lipase (ATGL), a key lipase in adipocytes and non-adipose cells. Using a cell culture model, we examined interactions of ATGL and its co-lipase CGI-58 with perilipin 1 (perilipin A), perilipin 2 (adipose differentiation-related protein), and perilipin 5 (LSDP5) using multiple techniques as follows: anisotropy Forster resonance energy transfer, co-immunoprecipitation, [32P]orthophosphate radiolabeling, and measurement of lipolysis. The results show that ATGL interacts with CGI-58 and perilipin 5; the latter is selectively expressed in oxidative tissues. Both proteins independently recruited ATGL to the LD surface, but with opposite effects; interaction of ATGL with CGI-58 increased lipolysis, whereas interaction of ATGL with perilipin 5 decreased lipolysis. In contrast, neither perilipin 1 nor 2 interacted directly with ATGL. Activation of protein kinase A (PKA) increased [32P]orthophosphate incorporation into perilipin 5 by 2-fold, whereas neither ATGL nor CGI-58 was labeled under the incubation conditions. Cells expressing both ectopic perilipin 5 and ATGL showed a 3-fold increase in lipolysis following activation of PKA.

However, lipolysis can contribute to the build up of toxic lipid intermediates and/or oxidized lipids in pathological conditions when cellular lipid homeostasis is altered, e.g. with obesity (1DeFronzo R.A. Diabetologia. 2010; 53: 1270-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Therefore, TAG hydrolysis must be carefully controlled to meet tissue-specific requirements for energy or lipid substrates in both adipose and non-adipose tissues. A better understanding of the mechanisms by which cells control lipid mobilization is needed to design novel approaches for intervention and prevention of the pathophysiological consequences of obesity. During the past 10 years, key players in the lipolytic pathway of adipocytes were identified through the study of transgenic mouse models (2Martinez-Botas J. Anderson J.B. Tessier D. Lapillonne A.

Complete lipolysis requires three enzyme reactions to break down TAG into fatty acids and glycerol. First, ATGL hydrolyzes TAG to produce fatty acid and diacylglycerol; second, hormone-sensitive lipase then acts as a diacylglycerol lipase, and the final step is catalyzed by monoacylglycerol lipase. Studies using RNAi technology in cultured cells have confirmed the role of ATGL in initiating lipolysis (11Miyoshi H. Perfield 2nd, J.W. Obin M.S. Greenberg A.S. J. Cell.

TAG hydrolysis requires lipase binding and activation at the LD water/oil interface. As demonstrated previously for hormone-sensitive lipase, ATGL may require interaction with proteins at the surfaces of LDs for optimal catalytic activity. Hence, we hypothesize that both the quality and quantity of proteins at the LD surface regulate ATGL activity. Among the growing number of LD-associated proteins, members of the perilipin family are likely candidates to regulate ATGL activity. The five members of this family are signature constituents of the LD proteome. The importance of perilipin 1 in the regulation of adipose tissue lipolysis has been well established. Moreover, recent evidence from cell culture models suggests that perilipins 2 and 5 play roles in control of lipolysis in nonadipose tissues (15Listenberger L.L. Ostermeyer-Fay A.G. Goldberg E.B.

An emerging model suggests that lipolysis is controlled by complex interactions between perilipins, lipases, and additional proteins that modify lipase activity. Members of the perilipin family share scaffolding properties to coordinate lipolysis. Perilipins 1, 2, and 5 interact with CGI-58, a cofactor for ATGL (20Yamaguchi T. Omatsu N. Matsushita S. Osumi T.

Dalen K. Dorward H. Marcinkiewicz A. Russell D. Gong D. Londos C. Yamaguchi T. Holm C. Rizzo M.A. Brasaemle D. Sztalryd C. J. Biol.

Most recently, a new protein, G0/G1 switch protein 2, was shown to interact with and negatively regulate ATGL (26Yang X. Lu X. Lombès M. Rha G.B. Chi Y.I. Guerin T.M. Smart E.J. Liu J. Cell Metab. 2010; 11: 194-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). These protein/protein interactions are critical for the regulation of TAG hydrolysis. The major objective of this study was to investigate the role of three members of the perilipin family, perilipin 1, 2, and 5, in the regulation of ATGL activity at the LD surface, through either modulation of ATGL accessibility to substrate or via direct protein/protein interactions, which may be critical for docking the lipase on LDs. A second objective was to determine whether each of the three perilipins regulates ATGL activity through a common mechanism. In rodent tissues, ATGL is ubiquitously expressed, whereas members of the perilipin family show different patterns of tissue-specific expression (27Bickel P.E. Tansey J.T. Welte M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1791: 419-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Perilipin 1 is expressed most highly in adipose tissue; perilipin 2 is ubiquitous, but most highly expressed in liver; and perilipin 5 is expressed primarily in heart, brown adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle. Heterogeneity in LD perilipin 1, 2, and 5 composition potentially regulates ATGL activity in a tissue-specific manner. Hence, our present studies specifically focused on the ability of these three perilipin proteins to regulate ATGL activity. In this study, we have used a cell culture system and multiple experimental approaches to reconstitute and investigate the role of perilipin proteins in the regulation of ATGL activity. Our studies provide evidence that ATGL activity is regulated differently by individual proteins of the perilipin family and therefore can be controlled in a tissue-specific manner.

Efficiency of transduction with Ad-ATGL-CFP was checked by immunoblotting. Statistical significance was tested using either one-way analysis of variance or a two-tailed Student's t test (GraphPad Software, Inc.). To explore protein/protein interactions between perilipin proteins and ATGL, we used CHO cell lines stably expressing fluorescent fusion proteins of perilipin 1, 2, and 5 and further co-transfected with an expression vector for an mATGL-CFP fusion protein. We opted to use catalytically inactive ATGL, mATGL (S47A) (32Smirnova E. Goldberg E.B. Makarova K.S. Lin L. Brown W.J. Jackson C.L.

Similarly, cells with perilipin 2-YFP-coated LDs showed a mostly diffuse mATGL(S47A)-CFP signal throughout the cytoplasm with minimal localization of mATGL to LD surfaces. Although mATGL did not extensively localize to perilipin 1-YFP- or perilipin 2-YFP-coated LDs, expression of wild-type ATGL-CFP resulted in a dramatic decrease in the number of LDs per cell, particularly in cells expressing perilipin 2-YFP (Fig. 2).

https://openalex.org/W2128207486,"Background Sirtuins (Sirt), a family of nicotinamide adenine nucleotide (NAD) dependent deacetylases, are implicated in energy metabolism and life span. Among the known Sirt isoforms (Sirt1-7), Sirt3 was identified as a stress responsive deacetylase recently shown to play a role in protecting cells under stress conditions. Here, we demonstrated the presence of Sirt3 in neurons, and characterized the role of Sirt3 in neuron survival under NMDA-induced excitotoxicity. Methodology/Principal Findings To induce excitotoxic injury, we exposed primary cultured mouse cortical neurons to NMDA (30 µM). NMDA induced a rapid decrease of cytoplasmic NAD (but not mitochondrial NAD) in neurons through poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) activation. Mitochondrial Sirt3 was increased following PARP-1 mediated NAD depletion, which was reversed by either inhibition of PARP-1 or exogenous NAD. We found that massive reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced under this NAD depleted condition mediated the increase in mitochondrial Sirt3. By transfecting primary neurons with a Sirt3 overexpressing plasmid or Sirt3 siRNA, we showed that Sirt3 is required for neuroprotection against excitotoxicity. Conclusions This study demonstrated for the first time that mitochondrial Sirt3 acts as a prosurvival factor playing an essential role to protect neurons under excitotoxic injury."

The cIAP1 and cIAP2 paralogs bear three N-terminal baculoviral IAP repeat (BIR) domains and a C-terminal E3 ligase RING domain. IAP antagonist compounds, also known as Smac mimetics, bind the BIR domains of IAPs and trigger rapid RING-dependent autoubiquitylation, but the mechanism is unknown. We show that RING dimerization is essential for the E3 ligase activity of cIAP1 and cIAP2 because monomeric RING mutants could not interact with the ubiquitin-charged E2 enzyme and were resistant to Smac mimetic-induced autoubiquitylation. Unexpectedly, the BIR domains inhibited cIAP1 RING dimerization, and cIAP1 existed predominantly as an inactive monomer. However, addition of either mono- or bivalent Smac mimetics relieved this inhibition, thereby allowing dimer formation and promoting E3 ligase activation. In contrast, the cIAP2 dimer was more stable, had higher intrinsic E3 ligase activity, and was not highly activated by Smac mimetics. These results explain how Smac mimetics promote rapid destruction of cIAP1 and suggest mechanisms for activating cIAP1 in other pathways.

https://openalex.org/W2085907274,"Background High baseline levels of IP-10 predict a slower first phase decline in HCV RNA and a poor outcome following interferon/ribavirin therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Several recent studies report that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) adjacent to IL28B predict spontaneous resolution of HCV infection and outcome of treatment among HCV genotype 1 infected patients. Methods and Findings In the present study, we correlated the occurrence of variants at three such SNPs (rs12979860, rs12980275, and rs8099917) with pretreatment plasma IP-10 and HCV RNA throughout therapy within a phase III treatment trial (HCV-DITTO) involving 253 Caucasian patients. The favorable SNP variants (CC, AA, and TT, respectively) were associated with lower baseline IP-10 (P = 0.02, P = 0.01, P = 0.04) and were less common among HCV genotype 1 infected patients than genotype 2/3 (P<0.0001, P<0.0001, and P = 0.01). Patients carrying favorable SNP genotypes had higher baseline viral load than those carrying unfavorable variants (P = 0.0013, P = 0.029, P = 0.0004 respectively). Among HCV genotype 1 infected carriers of the favorable C, A, or T alleles, IP-10 below 150 pg/mL significantly predicted a more pronounced reduction of HCV RNA from day 0 to 4 (first phase decline), which translated into increased rates of RVR (62%, 53%, and 39%) and SVR (85%, 76%, and 75% respectively) among homozygous carriers with baseline IP-10 below 150 pg/mL. In multivariate analyses of genotype 1-infected patients, baseline IP-10 and C genotype at rs12979860 independently predicted the first phase viral decline and RVR, which in turn independently predicted SVR. Conclusions Concomitant assessment of pretreatment IP-10 and IL28B-related SNPs augments the prediction of the first phase decline in HCV RNA, RVR, and final therapeutic outcome."
https://openalex.org/W1973414324,"The mitosomes of Giardia intestinalis are thought to be mitochondria highly-reduced in response to the oxygen-poor niche. We performed a quantitative proteomic assessment of Giardia mitosomes to increase understanding of the function and evolutionary origin of these enigmatic organelles. Mitosome-enriched fractions were obtained from cell homogenate using Optiprep gradient centrifugation. To distinguish mitosomal proteins from contamination, we used a quantitative shot-gun strategy based on isobaric tagging of peptides with iTRAQ and tandem mass spectrometry. Altogether, 638 proteins were identified in mitosome-enriched fractions. Of these, 139 proteins had iTRAQ ratio similar to that of the six known mitosomal markers. Proteins were selected for expression in Giardia to verify their cellular localizations and the mitosomal localization of 20 proteins was confirmed. These proteins include nine components of the FeS cluster assembly machinery, a novel diflavo-protein with NADPH reductase activity, a novel VAMP-associated protein, and a key component of the outer membrane protein translocase. None of the novel mitosomal proteins was predicted by previous genome analyses. The small proteome of the Giardia mitosome reflects the reduction in mitochondrial metabolism, which is limited to the FeS cluster assembly pathway, and a simplicity in the protein import pathway required for organelle biogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2080625714,"Background Extensive mononuclear cell infiltration is strongly correlated with liver damage in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (CHB) infection. Macrophages and infiltrating monocytes also participate in the development of liver damage and fibrosis in animal models. However, little is known regarding the immunopathogenic role of peripheral blood monocytes and intrahepatic macrophages. Methodology/Principal Findings The frequencies, phenotypes, and functions of peripheral blood and intrahepatic monocyte/macrophage subsets were analyzed in 110 HBeAg positive CHB patients, including 32 immune tolerant (IT) carriers and 78 immune activated (IA) patients. Liver biopsies from 20 IA patients undergoing diagnosis were collected for immunohistochemical analysis. IA patients displayed significant increases in peripheral blood monocytes and intrahepatic macrophages as well as CD16+ subsets, which were closely associated with serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and the liver histological activity index (HAI) scores. In addition, the increased CD16+ monocytes/macrophages expressed higher levels of the activation marker HLA-DR compared with CD16− monocytes/macrophages. Furthermore, peripheral blood CD16+ monocytes preferentially released inflammatory cytokines and hold higher potency in inducing the expansion of Th17 cells. Of note, hepatic neutrophils also positively correlated with HAI scores. Conclusions These distinct properties of monocyte/macrophage subpopulations participate in fostering the inflammatory microenvironment and liver damage in CHB patients and further represent a collaborative scenario among different cell types contributing to the pathogenesis of HBV-induced liver disease."
https://openalex.org/W2007596877,"Rho GTPases control many cellular processes, including cell survival, gene expression and migration. Rho proteins reside mainly in the cytosol and are targeted to the plasma membrane (PM) upon specific activation by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). Accordingly, most GEFs are also cytosolic or associated with the PM. However, Net1, a RhoA-specific GEF predominantly localizes to the cell nucleus at steady-state. Nuclear localization for Net1 has been seen as a mechanism for sequestering the GEF away from RhoA, effectively rendering the protein inactive. However, considering the prominence of nuclear Net1 and the fact that a biological stimulus that promotes Net1 translocation out the nucleus to the cytosol has yet to be discovered, we hypothesized that Net1 might have a previously unidentified function in the nucleus of cells.Using an affinity precipitation method to pulldown the active form of Rho GEFs from different cellular fractions, we show here that nuclear Net1 does in fact exist in an active form, contrary to previous expectations. We further demonstrate that a fraction of RhoA resides in the nucleus, and can also be found in a GTP-bound active form and that Net1 plays a role in the activation of nuclear RhoA. In addition, we show that ionizing radiation (IR) specifically promotes the activation of the nuclear pool of RhoA in a Net1-dependent manner, while the cytoplasmic activity remains unchanged. Surprisingly, irradiating isolated nuclei alone also increases nuclear RhoA activity via Net1, suggesting that all the signals required for IR-induced nuclear RhoA signaling are contained within the nucleus.These results demonstrate the existence of a functional Net1/RhoA signaling pathway within the nucleus of the cell and implicate them in the DNA damage response."
https://openalex.org/W2033023603,"Background Phosphodiesterase 7 plays a major role in down-regulation of protein kinase A activity by hydrolyzing cAMP in many cell types. This cyclic nucleotide plays a key role in signal transduction in a wide variety of cellular responses. In the brain, cAMP has been implicated in learning, memory processes and other brain functions. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we show a novel function of phosphodiesterase 7 inhibition on nigrostriatal dopaminergic neuronal death. We found that S14, a heterocyclic small molecule inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 7, conferred significant neuronal protection against different insults both in the human dopaminergic cell line SH-SY5Y and in primary rat mesencephalic cultures. S14 treatment also reduced microglial activation, protected dopaminergic neurons and improved motor function in the lipopolysaccharide rat model of Parkinson disease. Finally, S14 neuroprotective effects were reversed by blocking the cAMP signaling pathways that operate through cAMP-dependent protein kinase A. Conclusions/Significance Our findings demonstrate that phosphodiesterase 7 inhibition can protect dopaminergic neurons against different insults, and they provide support for the therapeutic potential of phosphodiesterase 7 inhibitors in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders, particularly Parkinson disease."
https://openalex.org/W1973785136,"Although caloric restriction (CR) has been shown to increase lifespan in various animal models, the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon have not yet been revealed. We developed an in vitro system to mimic CR by reducing glucose concentration in cell growth medium which excludes metabolic factors and allows assessment of the effects of CR at the cellular and molecular level. We monitored cellular proliferation of normal WI-38, IMR-90 and MRC-5 human lung fibroblasts and found that glucose restriction (GR) can inhibit cellular senescence and significantly extend cellular lifespan compared with cells receiving normal glucose (NG) in the culture medium. Moreover, GR decreased expression of p16INK4a (p16), a well-known senescence-related gene, in all of the tested cell lines. Over-expressed p16 resulted in early replicative senescence in glucose-restricted cells suggesting a crucial role of p16 regulation in GR-induced cellular lifespan extension. The decreased expression of p16 was partly due to GR-induced chromatin remodeling through effects on histone acetylation and methylation of the p16 promoter. GR resulted in an increased expression of SIRT1, a NAD-dependent histone deacetylase, which has positive correlation with CR-induced longevity. The elevated SIRT1 was accompanied by enhanced activation of the Akt/p70S6K1 signaling pathway in response to GR. Furthermore, knockdown of SIRT1 abolished GR-induced p16 repression as well as Akt/p70S6K1 activation implying that SIRT1 may affect p16 repression through direct deacetylation effects and indirect regulation of Akt/p70S6K1 signaling. Collectively, these results provide new insights into interactions between epigenetic and genetic mechanisms on CR-induced longevity that may contribute to anti-aging approaches and also provide a general molecular model for studying CR in vitro in mammalian systems."

https://openalex.org/W1988013008,"An increasing number of studies report associations between variation in DTNBP1, a top candidate gene in schizophrenia, and both the clinical symptoms of the disorder and its cognitive deficits. DTNBP1 encodes dysbindin-1, reduced levels of which have been found in synaptic fields of schizophrenia cases. This study determined whether such synaptic reductions are isoform-specific.Using Western blotting of tissue fractions, we first determined the synaptic localization of the three major dysbindin-1 isoforms (A, B, and C). All three were concentrated in synaptosomes of multiple brain areas, including auditory association cortices in the posterior half of the superior temporal gyrus (pSTG) and the hippocampal formation (HF). Tests on the subsynaptic tissue fractions revealed that each isoform is predominantly, if not exclusively, associated with synaptic vesicles (dysbindin-1B) or with postsynaptic densities (dysbindin-1A and -1C). Using Western blotting on pSTG (n = 15) and HF (n = 15) synaptosomal fractions from schizophrenia cases and their matched controls, we discovered that synaptic dysbindin-1 is reduced in an isoform-specific manner in schizophrenia without changes in levels of synaptophysin or PSD-95. In pSTG, about 92% of the schizophrenia cases displayed synaptic dysbindin-1A reductions averaging 48% (p = 0.0007) without alterations in other dysbindin-1 isoforms. In the HF, by contrast, schizophrenia cases displayed normal levels of synaptic dysbindin-1A, but 67% showed synaptic reductions in dysbindin-1B averaging 33% (p = 0.0256), while 80% showed synaptic reductions in dysbindin-1C averaging 35% (p = 0.0171).Given the distinctive subsynaptic localization of dysbindin-1A, -1B, and -1C across brain regions, the observed pSTG reductions in dysbindin-1A are postsynaptic and may promote dendritic spine loss with consequent disruption of auditory information processing, while the noted HF reductions in dysbindin-1B and -1C are both presynaptic and postsynaptic and could promote deficits in spatial working memory."
https://openalex.org/W1981381571,"The release of H(2)O(2) from alveolar macrophages has been linked to the development of pulmonary fibrosis, but little is known about its source or mechanism of production. We found that alveolar macrophages from asbestosis patients spontaneously produce high levels of H(2)O(2) and have high expression of Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD). Because Cu,Zn-SOD is found in the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS), we hypothesized that mitochondrial Cu,Zn-SOD-mediated H(2)O(2) generation contributed to pulmonary fibrosis. Asbestos-induced translocation of Cu,Zn-SOD to the IMS was unique to macrophages and dependent on functional mitochondrial respiration and the presence of at least one of the conserved cysteines required for disulfide bond formation. These conserved cysteine residues were also necessary for enzyme activation and H(2)O(2) generation. Cu,Zn-SOD-mediated H(2)O(2) generation was inhibited by knockdown of the iron-sulfur protein, Rieske, in complex III. The role of Cu,Zn-SOD was biologically relevant in that Cu,Zn-SOD(-/-) mice generated significantly less H(2)O(2) and had less oxidant stress in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung parenchyma. Furthermore, Cu,Zn-SOD(-/-) mice did not develop pulmonary fibrosis, and knockdown of Cu,Zn-SOD in monocytes attenuated collagen I deposition by lung fibroblasts. Our findings demonstrate a novel mechanism for the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis where the antioxidant enzyme Cu,Zn-SOD translocates to the mitochondrial IMS to increase H(2)O(2) generation in alveolar macrophages."

In this study, we have identified the signaling events that connect the activation of the complement system and MC degranulation.

Cultured mouse MCs treated with recombinant C5a exhibited a significant increase in p38 MAPK phosphorylation and MC degranulation.

Local injection of recombinant C5a induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in WT but not MC-deficient mice. Cultured mouse MCs treated with recombinant C5a exhibited a significant increase in p38 MAPK phosphorylation and MC degranulation. Taken together, these data demonstrate that C5a interacts with C5aR on MCs and that this C5a-C5aR interaction triggers activation of the p38 MAPK pathway, subsequent MC degranulation, and ultimately BP blistering."
https://openalex.org/W2026504472,"To study essential maternal gene requirements in the early C. elegans embryo, we have screened for temperature-sensitive, embryonic lethal mutations in an effort to bypass essential zygotic requirements for such genes during larval and adult germline development. With conditional alleles, multiple essential requirements can be examined by shifting at different times from the permissive temperature of 15°C to the restrictive temperature of 26°C. Here we describe 24 conditional mutations that affect 13 different loci and report the identity of the gene mutations responsible for the conditional lethality in 22 of the mutants. All but four are mis-sense mutations, with two mutations affecting splice sites, another creating an in-frame deletion, and one creating a premature stop codon. Almost all of the mis-sense mutations affect residues conserved in orthologs, and thus may be useful for engineering conditional mutations in other organisms. We find that 62% of the mutants display additional phenotypes when shifted to the restrictive temperature as L1 larvae, in addition to causing embryonic lethality after L4 upshifts. Remarkably, we also found that 13 out of the 24 mutations appear to be fast-acting, making them particularly useful for careful dissection of multiple essential requirements. Our findings highlight the value of C. elegans for identifying useful temperature-sensitive mutations in essential genes, and provide new insights into the requirements for some of the affected loci."
https://openalex.org/W1990239685,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with prostate cancer risk. However, whether these associations can be consistently replicated, vary with disease aggressiveness (tumor stage and grade) and/or interact with non-genetic potential risk factors or other SNPs is unknown. We therefore genotyped 39 SNPs from regions identified by several prostate cancer GWAS in 10,501 prostate cancer cases and 10,831 controls from the NCI Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium (BPC3). We replicated 36 out of 39 SNPs (P-values ranging from 0.01 to 10−28). Two SNPs located near KLK3 associated with PSA levels showed differential association with Gleason grade (rs2735839, P = 0.0001 and rs266849, P = 0.0004; case-only test), where the alleles associated with decreasing PSA levels were inversely associated with low-grade (as defined by Gleason grade <8) tumors but positively associated with high-grade tumors. No other SNP showed differential associations according to disease stage or grade. We observed no effect modification by SNP for association with age at diagnosis, family history of prostate cancer, diabetes, BMI, height, smoking or alcohol intake. Moreover, we found no evidence of pair-wise SNP-SNP interactions. While these SNPs represent new independent risk factors for prostate cancer, we saw little evidence for effect modification by other SNPs or by the environmental factors examined."
https://openalex.org/W1999466129,"Background GABAA receptors are members of the Cys-loop family of neurotransmitter receptors, proteins which are responsible for fast synaptic transmission, and are the site of action of wide range of drugs [1]. Recent work has shown that Cys-loop receptors are present on immune cells, but their physiological roles and the effects of drugs that modify their function in the innate immune system are currently unclear [2]. We are interested in how and why anaesthetics increase infections in intensive care patients; a serious problem as more than 50% of patients with severe sepsis will die [3]–[6]. As many anaesthetics act via GABAA receptors [7], the aim of this study was to determine if these receptors are present on immune cells, and could play a role in immunocompromising patients. Principal Findings We demonstrate, using RT-PCR, that monocytes express GABAA receptors constructed of α1, α4, β2, γ1 and/or δ subunits. Whole cell patch clamp electrophysiological studies show that GABA can activate these receptors, resulting in the opening of a chloride-selective channel; activation is inhibited by the GABAA receptor antagonists bicuculline and picrotoxin, but not enhanced by the positive modulator diazepam. The anaesthetic drugs propofol and thiopental, which can act via GABAA receptors, impaired monocyte function in classic immunological chemotaxis and phagocytosis assays, an effect reversed by bicuculline and picrotoxin. Significance Our results show that functional GABAA receptors are present on monocytes with properties similar to CNS GABAA receptors. The functional data provide a possible explanation as to why chronic propofol and thiopental administration can increase the risk of infection in critically ill patients: their action on GABAA receptors inhibits normal monocyte behaviour. The data also suggest a potential solution: monocyte GABAA receptors are insensitive to diazepam, thus the use of benzodiazepines as an alternative anesthetising agent may be advantageous where infection is a life threatening problem."
https://openalex.org/W2054704376,"T cell activity is controlled in large part by the T cell receptor (TCR). The TCR detects the presence of foreign pathogens and activates the T cell-mediated immune reaction. Numerous intracellular signaling pathways downstream of the TCR are involved in the process of T cell activation. Negative regulation of these pathways helps prevent excessive and deleterious T cell responses. Two homologous proteins, Sts-1 and Sts-2, have been shown to function as critical negative regulators of TCR signaling. The phosphoglycerate mutase-like domain of Sts-1 (Sts-1(PGM)) has a potent phosphatase activity that contributes to the suppression of TCR signaling. The function of Sts-2(PGM) as a phosphatase has been less clear, principally because its intrinsic enzyme activity has been difficult to detect. Here, we demonstrate that Sts-2 regulates the level of tyrosine phosphorylation on targets within T cells, among them the critical T cell tyrosine kinase Zap-70. Utilizing new phosphorylated substrates, we demonstrate that Sts-2(PGM) has clear, albeit weak, phosphatase activity. We further pinpoint Sts-2 residues Glu-481, Ser-552, and Ser-582 as specificity determinants, in that an Sts-2(PGM) triple mutant in which these three amino acids are altered to their counterparts in Sts-1(PGM) has substantially increased activity. Our results suggest that the phosphatase activities of both suppressor of TCR signaling homologues cooperate in a similar but independent fashion to help set the threshold for TCR-induced T cell activation."
https://openalex.org/W2161596395,"Modelling is widely used to inform decisions about management of malaria and acute febrile illnesses. Most models depend on estimates of the probability that untreated patients with malaria or bacterial illnesses will progress to severe disease or death. However, data on these key parameters are lacking and assumptions are frequently made based on expert opinion. Widely diverse opinions can lead to conflicting outcomes in models they inform.A Delphi survey was conducted with malaria experts aiming to reach consensus on key parameters for public health and economic models, relating to the outcome of untreated febrile illnesses. Survey questions were stratified by malaria transmission intensity, patient age, and HIV prevalence. The impact of the variability in opinion on decision models is illustrated with a model previously used to assess the cost-effectiveness of malaria rapid diagnostic tests. Some consensus was reached around the probability that patients from higher transmission settings with untreated malaria would progress to severe disease (median 3%, inter-quartile range (IQR) 1-5%), and the probability that a non-malaria illness required antibiotics in areas of low HIV prevalence (median 20%). Children living in low transmission areas were considered to be at higher risk of progressing to severe malaria (median 30%, IQR 10-58%) than those from higher transmission areas (median 13%, IQR 7-30%). Estimates of the probability of dying from severe malaria were high in all settings (medians 60-73%). However, opinions varied widely for most parameters, and did not converge on resurveying.This study highlights the uncertainty around potential consequences of untreated malaria and bacterial illnesses. The lack of consensus on most parameters, the wide range of estimates, and the impact of variability in estimates on model outputs, demonstrate the importance of sensitivity analysis for decision models employing expert opinion. Results of such models should be interpreted cautiously. The diversity of expert opinion should be recognised when policy options are debated."
https://openalex.org/W1986842056,"Severe malaria is a life-threatening medical emergency and requires prompt and effective treatment to prevent death. There is paucity of published information on current practices of severe malaria case management in sub-Saharan Africa; we evaluated the management practices for severe malaria in Ugandan health facilitiesWe did a cross sectional survey, using multi-stage sampling methods, of health facilities in 11 districts in the eastern and mid-western parts of Uganda. The study instruments were adapted from the WHO hospital care assessment tools. Between June and August 2009, 105 health facilities were surveyed and 181 health workers and 868 patients/caretakers interviewed. None of the inpatient facilities had all seven components of a basic care package for the management of severe malaria consistently available during the 3 months prior to the survey. Referral practices were appropriate for <10% (18/196) of the patients. Prompt care at any health facility was reported by 29% (247/868) of patients. Severe malaria was correctly diagnosed in 27% of patients (233).Though the quinine dose and regimen was correct in the majority (611/868, 70.4%) of patients, it was administered in the correct volumes of 5% dextrose in only 18% (147/815). Most patients (80.1%) had several doses of quinine administered in one single 500 ml bottle of 5% dextrose. Medications were purchased by 385 (44%) patients and medical supplies by 478 patients (70.6%).Management of severe malaria in Ugandan health facilities was sub-optimal. These findings highlight the challenges of correctly managing severe malaria in resource limited settings. Priority areas for improvement include triage and emergency care, referral practises, quality of diagnosis and treatment, availability of medicines and supplies, training and support supervision."
https://openalex.org/W1969896761,"Starvation elicits a complex adaptive response in an organism. No information on transcriptional regulation of metabolic adaptations is available. We, therefore, studied the gene expression profiles of brain, small intestine, kidney, liver, and skeletal muscle in mice that were subjected to 0–72 h of fasting. Functional-category enrichment, text mining, and network analyses were employed to scrutinize the overall adaptation, aiming to identify responsive pathways, processes, and networks, and their regulation. The observed transcriptomics response did not follow the accepted “carbohydrate-lipid-protein” succession of expenditure of energy substrates. Instead, these processes were activated simultaneously in different organs during the entire period. The most prominent changes occurred in lipid and steroid metabolism, especially in the liver and kidney. They were accompanied by suppression of the immune response and cell turnover, particularly in the small intestine, and by increased proteolysis in the muscle. The brain was extremely well protected from the sequels of starvation. 60% of the identified overconnected transcription factors were organ-specific, 6% were common for 4 organs, with nuclear receptors as protagonists, accounting for almost 40% of all transcriptional regulators during fasting. The common transcription factors were PPARα, HNF4α, GCRα, AR (androgen receptor), SREBP1 and -2, FOXOs, EGR1, c-JUN, c-MYC, SP1, YY1, and ETS1.

Our data strongly suggest that the control of metabolism in four metabolically active organs is exerted by transcription factors that are activated by nutrient signals and serves, at least partly, to prevent irreversible brain damage. Adapting to starvation requires an interorgan integration of the activity of metabolic pathways to protect the body from an irreversible loss of resources (1Diamond J. Nature. 2003; 423: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 2Södersten P. Bergh C. Zandian M. Horm. Behav. 2006; 50: 572-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), but how the organism integrates these reactions remains largely unknown. Numerous studies on humans, who fasted for 3–6 weeks, have shown that glycogen stores are depleted within a day (3Cahill Jr., G.F. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2006; 26: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). The decline in circulating glucose and insulin during the next few days (4Owen O.E. Felig P. Morgan A.P. Wahren J. Cahill Jr., G.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1969; 48: 574-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar) induces a transient increase in plasma (essential) amino acids and a concomitant decline in plasma alanine levels due to an increased hepatic extraction for gluconeogenesis (5Felig P.

Nutr. 1970; 23: 986-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Muscle catabolism is a major source of amino acids in this phase. When fasting is continued, muscle protein catabolism declines, and hepatic uptake of amino acids decreases, which is reflected in a decline of endogenous glucose production (6Felig P. Marliss E. Pozefsky T. Cahill Jr., G.F. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1970; 23: 986-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and urinary nitrogen excretion (4Owen O.E. Felig P. Morgan A.P. Wahren J. Cahill Jr., G.F.

Physiol. 1982; 243: E251-E256PubMed Google Scholar). Lipid catabolism and the (hepatic) production of ketone bodies also increases rapidly and is quantitatively similar after 3 days and 5–6 weeks of starvation (8Reichard Jr., G.A. Owen O.E. Haff A.C. Paul P. Bortz W.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1974; 53: 508-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), but plasma levels increase only gradually to plateau after 4 weeks (4Owen O.E. Felig P. Morgan A.P. Wahren J. Cahill Jr., G.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1969; 48: 574-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 9Garber A.J. Menzel P.H. Boden G. Owen O.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1974; 54: 981-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The associated increase in urinary ketone body (organic-acid) excretion requires a compensatory increase in ammonia production and urinary excretion (4Owen O.E. Felig P. Morgan A.P. Wahren J. Cahill Jr., G.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1969; 48: 574-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 7Hannaford M.C. Leiter L.A. Josse R.G. Goldstein M.B. Marliss E.B. Halperin M.L. Am. J.

Nutr. 1970; 23: 986-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). As a result, the kidney and the liver produce similar amounts of glucose (4Owen O.E. Felig P. Morgan A.P. Wahren J. Cahill Jr., G.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1969; 48: 574-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 6Felig P. Marliss E. Pozefsky T. Cahill Jr., G.F. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1970; 23: 986-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and ammonia/urea (7Hannaford M.C. Leiter L.A. Josse R.G. Goldstein M.B. Marliss E.B. Halperin M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 243: E251-E256PubMed Google Scholar) after 2–3 weeks of fasting. From the third week onward, the circulating level of β-hydroxybutyrate has become sufficiently high to replace glucose as the fuel in e.g. the central nervous system (11Owen O.E. Morgan A.P. Kemp H.G. Sullivan J.M. Herrera M.G. Cahill Jr., G.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1967; 46: 1589-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar), but amino acids continue to be catabolized at a low rate (12Owen O.E. Smalley K.J. D'Alessio D.A. Mozzoli M.A. Dawson E.K. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1998; 68: 12-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) because some tissues (erythrocytes) need glucose as fuel, whereas the kidney needs to produce ammonia. This large body of metabolomic data describes an essentially biphasic response with an early phase in which proteins and fats are equally used as energy sources and a late phase in which proteins are maximally conserved. Relatively few studies on prolonged fasting in mice are available, but in aggregate, the metabolomic data reveal both similarities and differences with humans. We quantified a number of metabolites in our previous fasting-related studies (13Sokolović M. Wehkamp D. Sokolović A. Vermeulen J. Gilhuijs-Pederson L.A. van Haaften R.I. Nikolsky Y.

Plasma ammonia levels increased ∼5-fold with the duration of fasting in mice, whereas plasma β-hydroxybutyrate increased >10-fold to a plateau of 1–2 mm after 24 h of fasting (14Sokolović M.

Drug Alcohol Depend. 1984; 13: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Plasma glucose and lactate concentrations declined transiently at 36 and 48 h of fasting to return to prefasting levels at 72 h of fasting (14Sokolović M. Sokolović A. Wehkamp D. Ver, Loren, van Themaat E. de Waart D.R. Gilhuijs-Pederson L.A. Nikolsky Y. van Kampen A.H. Hakvoort T.B. Lamers W.H. BMC Genomics. 2008; 9: 528Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Supporting the validity of the increase in plasma glucose levels was the initial depletion of glycogen in the liver followed by a progressive reaccumulation in the pericentral, that is, non-gluconeogenic part of the liver (14Sokolović M. Sokolović A. Wehkamp D. Ver, Loren, van Themaat E. de Waart D.R. Gilhuijs-Pederson L.A. Nikolsky Y. van Kampen A.H. Hakvoort T.B. Lamers W.H. BMC Genomics. 2008; 9: 528Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Similarly, many amino acids (alanine, serine, histidine, glycine, arginine, citrulline, and phenylalanine) transiently declined at 24 and 48 h of fasting to return to prefasting levels at 72 h, whereas branched-chain amino acids, threonine, asparagine, and taurine increased in concentration with the duration of fasting. These data concur with human data to the extent that increasing ammonia levels probably reflect increasing renal production and excretion to compensate for the increased organic acid (β-hydroxybutyrate) excretion. However, the transient decline in glucose, lactate, and most amino acids clearly differs from the findings in humans during prolonged fasting and still need further research to be clarified. A subsequent study (15Sokolović M. Sokolović A. van Roomen C.P. Gruber A. Ottenhoff R. Scheij S. Hakvoort T.B. Lamers W.H. Groen A.K. J. Hepatol. 2010; 52: 737-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), which focused on lipid metabolism, showed that the plasma concentration of cholesterol increased and that of triglycerides decreased to new levels within 24 h, whereas fecal cholesterol output declined progressively with the duration of fasting. Hepatic triglyceride concentration increased after 24 h, and hepatic and intestinal cholesterol and phospholipid concentrations increased after 48 h of fasting. Furthermore, we observed an increase in biliary cholesterol, bile salt, and phospholipid excretion, which we believe serves to nourish enterocytes from the luminal side. During the initial phase of fasting the rate of weight loss is high but then declines to a minimum until the final, moribund phase with more rapid weight loss sets in (18Le Maho Y. Vu Van Kha H. Koubi H. Dewasmes G. Girard J. Ferré P. Cagnard M. Am. J. Physiol. 1981; 241: E342-E354PubMed Google Scholar, 19Cherel Y. Attaix D. Rosolowska-Huszcz D. Belkhou R. Robin J.P. Arnal M. Le Maho Y. Clin. Sci. 1991; 81: 611-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Based on whole-body energy expenditure, these three phases of weight loss were interpreted as reflecting successively the postabsorptive utilization of glycogen reserves, oxidation of fat (with a protein-sparing effect), and eventually the self-destructive consumption of cell proteins (18Le Maho Y. Vu Van Kha H. Koubi H. Dewasmes G. Girard J. Ferré P. Cagnard M. Am. J. Physiol. 1981; 241: E342-E354PubMed Google Scholar, 20Habold C. Foltzer-Jourdainne C. Le Maho Y. Lignot J.H. Oudart H. J. Physiol. 2005; 566: 575-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, transcriptomics data from fasting muscle, small intestine, and liver (13Sokolović M. Wehkamp D. Sokolović A. Vermeulen J. Gilhuijs-Pederson L.A. van Haaften R.I. Nikolsky Y. Evelo C.T. van Kampen A.H. Hakvoort T.B. Lamers W.H.

FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1697-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) suggest that increased protein degradation is an early response in muscle that is accompanied by a temporary suppression of glutamine consumption in the intestine and an up-regulation of gluconeogenic enzymes in the liver. The late response of the intestine is primarily directed to cell survival, whereas this phase is (unexpectedly) characterized by a near-normalization of carbohydrate metabolism in liver. Although data on long term starvation in muscle, kidney, and brain are not available, these transcriptomic data in rodents appear to concur with the human metabolomic data that protein conservation during fasting follows an initial phase during which protein catabolism is liberally used to produce glucose and to contradict the sequential model in which protein catabolism is a terminal step in long term fasting. This study aims to test the hypothesis that the adaptive response of a mouse to prolonged fasting involves an integrated interorgan program of progressive metabolic adaptations that subserves the maintenance of vital organ functions. The question was addressed with a systems biology approach using transcriptomics and advanced bioinformatics to analyze the adaptive expression signatures of the small intestine, liver, kidney, muscle, and brain. By analyzing the transcriptomes of five organs at five different time points, we could produce a comprehensive view of the pathways, processes, and networks that mediate this adaptive response. Our findings show that the adaptive responses do not favor a succession of substrates used for energy expenditure, but that pathways catabolizing carbohydrates, fats, and proteins were activated simultaneously in different organs. The most prominent changes occurred in lipid and steroid metabolism accompanied by suppression of the immune response and cell turnover. Brain appeared to be well protected against fasting. The result identified a set of transcription factors that may mediate the spatiotemporal regulation of general metabolism, cell turnover, and immune response in response to fasting. 6-Week-old male FVB mice (Charles River, Maastricht, The Netherlands) were fasted for 0, 12, 24, 48, or 72 h before sacrifice (n = 8 per group; the 12-h group was fasted overnight). 24 h before and during fasting, the animals were kept in metabolic cages to prevent the consumption of bedding and feces and were kept warm with an infrared lamp. Body weight was determined daily. The daily rate of body- and organ-mass loss was calculated in comparison to the previous time point as described (22Habold C. Foltzer-Jourdainne C. Le Maho Y. Lignot J.H. Pflugers Archiv. 2006; 451: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Before organ harvesting (between 9:00 and 10:00 a.m.), the animals were anesthetized with 1.25 mg of ketamine and 2 μg of dexmedetomidine per 10 g of body weight in 0, 12, and 24 h fasted and with a 20% reduced amount in 48 and 72 h fasted mice. After blood collection (lithium heparin) from the inferior caval vein, mice were killed by decapitation. The organs (brain, kidney, liver, small intestine, and calf muscle) were quickly isolated, weighed, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. The entire procedure was carried out by five operators to expedite organ isolation and prevent RNA degradation. The animal studies were reviewed and approved by the AMC committee for animal care and use. Total RNA was extracted from the frozen organs of eight animals per experimental group with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) followed by a repeated phenol-chloroform extraction, LiCl precipitation, and additional purification using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen Benelux, Venlo, The Netherlands). The RNA quality was assessed using the RNA 6000 Nano LabChip® kit in an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). All samples had intact bands corresponding to 18 S and 28 S ribosomal RNA subunits, displayed no chromosomal peaks or RNA degradation products, and had an RNA integrity number >8. Five of eight animals per group were chosen based on the best RNA quality across all five tissues, so that the RNAs used in this study all originated from the same five mice per time point. 125 microarrays (5 time points, 5 mice per time point, 5 tissues) were performed. We used a common-reference design shown to be robust to low quality arrays, amenable to clustering, and allowing for comparison of more than two conditions at once without dye effects (23Dobbin K. Simon R. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 1438-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The single common-reference sample, a pool of equal amounts of RNA from all the samples investigated, was used in all arrays to allow for quantitative comparisons across time points and tissues. The microarray labeling and hybridization were performed at the Microarray Department, University of Amsterdam. Labeling and hybridization days were organized so that all comparisons could be analyzed with minimal confounding. One experimental block containing all 25 samples per tissue was too large to handle in a day. The blocks were, therefore, randomized so that the same time points were not labeled/hybridized on the same day. The Cy3-labeled test samples were hybridized against the common-reference sample (Cy5-labeled) using Microarray Department two-dye home-spotted arrays, printed with the 22K 65-mer Sigma/Compugen Mouse OligoLibraryTM with the oligo library reannotated as described (24Jonker M.J. Bruning O. van Iterson M. Schaap M.M. van der Hoeven T.V. Vrieling H. Beems R.B. de Vries A. van Steeg H. Breit T.M. Luijten M. Carcinogenesis. 2009; 30: 1805-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). All analyses were carried out with packages from Bioconductor (26Gentleman R.C. Carey V.J. Bates D.M. Bolstad B. Dettling M. Dudoit S. Ellis B. Gautier L. Ge Y. Gentry J. Hornik K. Hothorn T. Huber W. Iacus S. Irizarry R. Leisch F. Li C. Maechler M. Rossini A.J. Sawitzki G. Smith C. Smyth G. Tierney L. Yang J.Y. Zhang J. Genome Biol. 2004; 5: R80Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in the statistical software package R (Version 2.6.1). Estimated foreground and background signals were extracted from the ArrayVision files. Two arrays did not pass our quality control performed on the raw data due to spatial artifacts. Background correction was performed using the “normexp” method (27Ritchie M.E. Silver J. Oshlack A. Holmes M. Diyagama D. Holloway A. Smyth G.K. Bioinformatics. 2007; 23: 2700-2707Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar) to adjust the foreground signal without introducing negative values. The resulting log ratios were normalized per array by print-tip loess. Because some of the control probes, notably Gapdh, showed substantial between-tissue variation, they were down-weighted to zero in the normalization step. The statistical analysis of the data was performed within each tissue separately by comparing 0 h versus all other time points. Each probe except the controls was tested for any change in expression over the 5 time points with a moderated F-test. Differential expression for the pairwise comparisons between 0 h and any of the other time points was assessed using a moderated t test. Moderated tests are similar to the standard tests for each probe, except that the standard deviations are moderated across genes to ensure a more stable inference for each gene. This prevents a gene from being judged as differentially expressed with a very small -fold change merely because of an accidentally small residual standard deviation (28Smyth G.K. Stat. Appl. Genet. Mol. Biol. 2004; 3 (Article 3)Crossref PubMed Scopus (9241) Google Scholar). The resulting p values were corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg False Discovery Rate adjustment. Genes were considered to be differentially expressed if the corrected p values were <0.05 (while controlling the expected false discovery rate to no more than 5%). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering was performed both on the raw data, as a quality control, and on normalized data, with complete linkage and Pearson's correlation distance. Identification of overrepresented functional categories (pathways and processes) was performed per tissue using the complete set of differentially expressed genes per time point (corrected p < 0.05, moderated t test) in the MetaCoreTM suit (Version 6.1; GeneGo, Inc., St. Joseph, MI (29Ekins S. Kirillov E. Rakhmatulin E.A. Nikolskaya T. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2005; 33: 474-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 30Nikolsky Y. Nikolskaya T. Bugrim A. Drug Discov. Today. 2005; 10: 653-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar)). The functional analysis of the data were based on MetaCore's proprietary manually curated data base of protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions, transcription factors, signaling, and metabolic pathways. Overrepresented functional categories were identified as described (31Nikolsky Y. Kirillov E. Zuev R. Rakhmatulin E. Nikolskaya T. Methods Mol. Biol. 2009; 563: 177-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To study the regulation of the responsive genes, we performed network analysis in MetaCoreTM using two different algorithms, which both deliver lists of subnetworks (one per transcription factor) but begin from a different start point. The “transcriptional regulation” algorithm starts with a small sub-network of differentially expressed genes from the initial list and adds the “responsible” transcription factors. The “transcription-factor target modeling” algorithm starts with list of transcription factors deduced from the initial dataset and calculates the shortest paths to their targets (31Nikolsky Y. Kirillov E. Zuev R. Rakhmatulin E. Nikolskaya T. Methods Mol. Biol. 2009; 563: 177-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The networks were generated for all five tissues using unions of differentially expressed genes (corrected p < 0.05, moderated t test). To identify the major transcriptional regulators in the dataset, we used the statistical Interactome tool in MetaCoreTM. It calculates relative connectivity (number of interactions) of individual genes within the dataset compared with the entire data base based on the comprehensive collection of their known interactions (31Nikolsky Y. Kirillov E. Zuev R. Rakhmatulin E. Nikolskaya T. Methods Mol. Biol. 2009; 563: 177-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A gene was considered overconnected if it had more direct interactions with the genes of interest than it would be expected by chance (32Piruzian E. Bruskin S. Ishkin A. Abdeev R. Moshkovskii S. Melnik S. Nikolsky Y. Nikolskaya T. BMC. Syst. Biol. 2010; 4: 41Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The related statistics are described in detail elsewhere (31Nikolsky Y. Kirillov E. Zuev R. Rakhmatulin E. Nikolskaya T. Methods Mol. Biol. 2009; 563: 177-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Shortly, to assess significantly over- or under-connected proteins in the list, Interactome analysis evaluates relative connectivity of proteins based on the assumption that the most critical protein in a given dataset has more connections within the dataset than expected at random. The interactions between proteins within a dataset (local interactome) are compared with general connectivity within the interactions data base (global interactome). Statistical significance is assigned by using the cumulative hypergeometric distribution as p(k)=∑i=kDP(i,D,n,N),(eq.1) where P(k,D,n,N)=(kD)(n − kN − D)(nN)(eq.2) N is the number of proteins (protein-based network objects) in global interactome extracted from MetaCore, n is the number of proteins derived from the sets of genes of interest, D is the “degree” or number of interactions of a given protein in the global interactome data base, and k is the degree of a given protein within the set of interest. The p value calculated above gives the probability of observing k or more interactions of a given protein (with degree D in the global network) by random chance within the set of interest (of size n). The probability of observing under-connected proteins can be calculated by 1 − p(k). The resulting network of common and organ-specific regulators of fasting was created and visualized in Cytoscape (33Shannon P. Markiel A. Ozier O. Baliga N.S. Wang J.T. Ramage D. Amin N.

CoPub calculates an R-scaled score between two co-occurring concepts (i.e. genes and keywords) in Medline abstracts to assign a degree of relatedness between the two concepts (ranging from 0–100, representing non- to strong-association). It takes into account the number of co-publications between two concepts and the number of times each concept is separately mentioned in literature (34Frijters R. Verhoeven S. Alkema W. van Schaik R.

For each tissue, a keyword enrichment analysis was performed to detect keywords significantly associated with the set of differentially expressed genes (raw p < 0.01, moderated F-test). A keyword was regarded as associated with a gene if it was co-mentioned in at least three abstracts and had an R-scaled score of at least 35. Furthermore, at least 10 regulated genes needed to be associated with a keyword to include it in the keyword-enrichment analysis. Keywords were regarded as enriched if p < 0.01 in the Fisher's exact test. The CoPub web server is publicly available online.

Although this is normal, under pathophysiological conditions such as chronic hyperglycemia and inflammation, insulin exocytosis fails, and yet the mechanistic reason for failure is unclear. Hypothesizing that exocytotic proteins might be targets of S-nitrosylation, with their dysfunction under conditions of nitrosative stress serving as a mechanistic basis for insulin secretory dysfunction, we identified the t-SNARE protein Syntaxin 4 as a target of modification by S-nitrosylation. The cellular content of S-nitrosylated Syntaxin 4 peaked acutely, within 5 min of glucose stimulation in both human islets and MIN6 β-cells, corresponding to the time at which Syntaxin 4 activation was detectable. S-Nitrosylation was mapped to Syntaxin 4 residue Cys(141), located within the Hc domain predicted to increase accessibility for v-SNARE interaction. A C141S-Syntaxin 4 mutant resisted S-nitrosylation induced in vitro by the nitric oxide donor compound S-nitroso-L-glutathione, failed to exhibit glucose-induced activation and VAMP2 binding, and failed to potentiate insulin release akin to that of wild-type Syntaxin 4. Strikingly, S-nitrosylation of Syntaxin 4 could be induced by acute treatment with inflammatory cytokines (TNFα, IL-1β, and IFNγ), coordinate with inappropriate Syntaxin 4 activation and insulin release in the absence of the glucose stimulus, consistent with nitrosative stress and dysfunctional exocytosis, preceding the cell dysfunction and death associated with more chronic stimulation (24 h). Taken together, these data indicate a significant role for reactive nitrogen species in the insulin exocytosis mechanism in β-cells and expose a potential pathophysiological exploitation of this mechanism to underlie dysfunctional exocytosis."

https://openalex.org/W2079143973,"Tumors create a heterogeneous acidic microenvironment which assists their growth and which must be taken into account in the design of drugs and their delivery. In addition, the acidic extracellular pH (pHe) is itself exploited in several experimental techniques for drug delivery. The way the acidity is created is not clear. We report here the spatial organization of key proton-handling proteins in C6 gliomas in rat brain. The mean profiles across the tumor rim of the Na+/H+ exchanger NHE1, and the lactate-H+ cotransporter MCT1, both showed peaks. NHE1, which is important for extension and migration of cells in vitro, showed a peak 1.55 times higher than in extratumoural tissue at 0.33 mm from the edge. MCT1 had a broader peak, further into the tumor (maximum 1.76 fold at 1.0 mm from the edge). In contrast, MCT4 and the carbonic anhydrase CAIX, which are associated with hypoxia, were not significantly upregulated in the rim. The spatial distribution of MCT4 was highly correlated with that of CAIX, suggesting that their expression is regulated by the same factors. Since protons extruded by NHE1 diffuse away through extracellular clefts, NHE1 requires a continuous source of intracellular protons. From the stoichiometries of metabolic pathways that produce or consume H+, and the greater availability of glucose compared to oxygen in most parts of a tumor, we support the classic view that most of the net proton efflux from C6 gliomas originates in glycolytic formation of lactate and H+ inside the tumor, but add that some lactate is taken up into cells in the rim on MCT1, and some lactate diffuses away, leaving its associated protons available to re-enter cells for extrusion on NHE1. Therapeutic inhibition of NHE1, MCT1 or CAIX is predicted to affect different parts of a tumor."

Forty-nine (79.0%) of S. enterica Typhimurium isolates were positive for bla(TEM-1b) and resistant to ampicillin.

Two main clones (PFGE type A and D) accounted for nearly 70% of S. enterica Typhimurium isolates, and 7 CTX-M-producing isolates belonged to PFGE type D. Collectively, our data reveal multi-drug resistance and a high prevalence of extended spectrum beta lactamases among S. enterica Typhimurium isolates from children in China.

https://openalex.org/W2032583508,"The type I transmembrane protein with epidermal growth factor and two follistatin motifs 2 (TMEFF2) is expressed in brain and prostate and overexpressed in prostate cancer, but its role in this disease is unclear. Several studies have suggested that TMEFF2 plays a role in suppressing the growth and invasive potential of human cancer cells, whereas others suggest that the shed portion of TMEFF2, which lacks the cytoplasmic region, has a growth-promoting activity. Here we show that TMEFF2 has a dual mode of action. Ectopic expression of wild-type full-length TMEFF2 inhibits soft agar colony formation, cellular invasion, and migration and increases cellular sensitivity to apoptosis. However, expression of the ectodomain portion of TMEFF2 increases cell proliferation. Using affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry, we identify sarcosine dehydrogenase (SARDH), the enzyme that converts sarcosine to glycine, as a TMEFF2-interacting protein. Co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence analysis confirms the interaction of SARDH with full-length TMEFF2. The ectodomain does not bind to SARDH. Moreover, expression of the full-length TMEFF2 but not the ectodomain results in a decreased level of sarcosine in the cells. These results suggest that the tumor suppressor activity of TMEFF2 requires the cytoplasmic/transmembrane portion of the protein and correlates with its ability to bind to SARDH and to modulate the level of sarcosine."

Here we show that, in HT29 colon carcinoma cells, silencing of c-Yes, but not of c-Src, selectively leads to an increase of cell clustering associated with a localisation of β-catenin at cell membranes and a reduction of expression of β-catenin target genes. c-Yes silencing induced an increase in apoptosis, inhibition of growth in soft-agar and in mouse xenografts, inhibition of cell migration and loss of the capacity to generate liver metastases in mice. Re-introduction of c-Yes, but not c -Src, restores transforming properties of c-Yes depleted cells. Moreover, we found that c-Yes kinase activity is required for its role in β-catenin localisation and growth in soft agar, whereas kinase activity is dispensable for its role in cell migration. We conclude that c-Yes regulates specific oncogenic signalling pathways important for colon cancer progression that is not shared with c-Src."
https://openalex.org/W2063854377,"Long-term livestock over-grazing causes nitrogen outputs to exceed inputs in Inner Mongolia, suggesting that low levels of nitrogen fertilization could help restore grasslands degraded by overgrazing. However, the effectiveness of such an approach depends on the response of production and species composition to the interactive drivers of nitrogen and water availability. We conducted a five-year experiment manipulating precipitation (NP: natural precipitation and SWP: simulated wet year precipitation) and nitrogen (0, 25 and 50 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) addition in Inner Mongolia. We hypothesized that nitrogen fertilization would increase forage production when water availability was relatively high. However, the extent to which nitrogen would co-limit production under average or below average rainfall in these grasslands was unknown.Aboveground net primary production (ANPP) increased in response to nitrogen when precipitation was similar to or higher than the long-term average, but not when precipitation was below average. This shift in limitation was also reflected by water and nitrogen use efficiency. Belowground live biomass significantly increased with increasing water availability, but was not affected by nitrogen addition. Under natural precipitation (NP treatment), the inter-annual variation of ANPP was 3-fold greater than with stable water availability (CV(ANPP) = 61±6% and 17±3% for NP and SWP treatment, respectively) and nitrogen addition increased CV(ANPP) even more (89±14%). This occurred in part because fertilizer nitrogen left in the soil in dry years remained available for uptake during wet years and because of high production by unpalatable annual species in wet years in the NP treatment. In summary, plant growth by residual fertilizer nitrogen could lead to sufficient yields to offset lack of additional production in dry years. However, the utility of fertilization for restoration may be constrained by shifts in species composition and the lack of response by belowground biomass, which reduces replacement of soil carbon and nitrogen."
https://openalex.org/W1997586018,"Background Video communication is increasingly used to connect people around the world. This includes connecting young children with their parents and other relatives during times of separation. An important issue is the extent to which video communication with children can approximate a physical presence such that familial relationships can be truly maintained by this means. Methodology/Principal Findings The current study employed an adaptation of the Separation and Reunion Paradigm with children (17 months to 5 years) to investigate the potential for video communication with a parent to afford a sense of proximity and security to children. The protocol involved a free-play session with the parent, followed by two separation-reunion episodes. During one of the separation episodes the parent was ‘virtually available’ to the child via a video link. Our results revealed three important differences. First, children left alone played longer in a strange room when their parent was virtually available to them compared to when the children were left alone with neither physical nor video contact with their parent. Second, younger participants sought physical contact with their parent less at the end of the video separation episode compared to when they were left entirely alone. Finally, the comparison between free play with video and free play with parent, revealed that the children exhibit a similar level of interactivity with their parent by video as they did in person. Conclusions/Significance For young children a video connection can have many of the same effects as a physical presence. This is a significant finding as it is the first such empirical demonstration and indicates considerable promise in video communication as a tool to maintain family relationships when physical presence is not possible."
https://openalex.org/W2137968706,"Increased production of biomass crops in North America will require new agricultural land, intensify the cultivation of land already under production and introduce new types of biomass crops. Assessing the potential biodiversity impacts of novel agricultural systems is fundamental to the maintenance of biodiversity in agricultural landscapes, yet the consequences of expanded biomass production remain unclear. We evaluate the ability of two candidate second generation biomass feedstocks (switchgrass, Panicum virgatum, and mixed-grass prairie) not currently managed as crops to act as post-breeding and fall migratory stopover habitat for birds. In total, we detected 41 bird species, including grassland specialists and species of state and national conservation concern (e.g. Henslow's Sparrow, Ammodramus henslowii). Avian species richness was generally comparable in switchgrass and prairie and increased with patch size in both patch types. Grassland specialists were less abundant and less likely to occur in patches within highly forested landscapes and were more common and likely to occur in larger patches, indicating that this group is also area-sensitive outside of the breeding season. Variation in the biomass and richness of arthropod food within patches was generally unrelated to richness and abundance metrics. Total bird abundance and that of grassland specialists was higher in patches with greater vegetation structural heterogeneity. Collectively, we find that perennial biomass feedstocks have potential to provide post-breeding and migratory stopover habitat for birds, but that the placement and management of crops will be critical factors in determining their suitability for species of conservation concern. Industrialization of cellulosic bioenergy production that results in reduced crop structural heterogeneity is likely to dramatically reduce the suitability of perennial biomass crops for birds."
https://openalex.org/W2006740249,"This study aimed at substantiating the associations of the apolipoproein M gene (APOM) with type 2 diabetes (T2D) as well as with metabolic traits in Hong Kong Chinese. In addition, APOM gene function was further characterized to elucidate its activity in cholesterol metabolism. Seventeen APOM SNPs documented in the NCBI database were genotyped. Five SNPs were confirmed in our study cohort of 1234 T2D and 606 control participants. Three of the five SNPs rs707921(C+1871A), rs707922(G+1837T) and rs805264(G+203A) were in linkage disequilibrium (LD). We chose rs707922 to tag this LD region for down stream association analyses and characterized the function of this SNP at molecular level. No association between APOM and T2D susceptibility was detected in our Hong Kong Chinese cohort. Interestingly, the C allele of rs805297 was significantly associated with T2D duration of longer than 10 years (OR = 1.245, p = 0.015). The rs707922 TT genotype was significantly associated with elevated plasma total- and LDL- cholesterol levels (p = 0.006 and p = 0.009, respectively) in T2D patients. Molecular analyses of rs707922 lead to the discoveries of a novel transcript APOM5 as well as the cryptic nature of exon 5 of the gene. Ectopic expression of APOM5 transcript confirmed rs707922 allele-dependent activity of the transcript in modifying cholesterol homeostasis in vitro. In conclusion, the results here did not support APOM as a T2D susceptibility gene in Hong Kong Chinese. However, in T2D patients, a subset of APOM SNPs was associated with disease duration and metabolic traits. Further molecular analysis proved the functional activity of rs707922 in APOM expression and in regulation of cellular cholesterol content."

To examine the physiological roles of NPBWR1, we examined phenotype of Npbwr1⁻/⁻ mice. When presented with an intruder mouse, Npbwr1⁻/⁻ mice showed impulsive contact with the strange mice, produced more intense approaches toward them, and had longer contact and chasing time along with greater and sustained elevation of heart rate and blood pressure compared to wild type mice. Npbwr1⁻/⁻ mice also showed increased autonomic and neuroendocrine responses to physical stress, suggesting that impairment of NPBWR1 leads to stress vulnerability. We also observed that these mice show abnormality in the contextual fear conditioning test. These data suggest that NPBWR1 plays a critical role in limbic system function and stress responses. Histological and electrophysiological studies showed that NPBWR1 acts as an inhibitory regulator on a subpopulation of GABAergic neurons in the lateral division of the CeA and terminates stress responses. These findings suggest important roles of NPBWR1 in regulating amygdala function during physical and social stress."
https://openalex.org/W2044671396,"Epithelial homeostasis incorporates the paradoxical concept of internal change (epithelial turnover) enabling the maintenance of anatomical status quo. Epithelial cell differentiation and cell loss (cell shedding and apoptosis) form important components of epithelial turnover. Although the mechanisms of cell loss are being uncovered the crucial triggers that modulate epithelial turnover through regulation of cell loss remain undetermined. Serotonin is emerging as a common autocrine-paracine regulator in epithelia of multiple organs, including the breast. Here we address whether serotonin affects epithelial turnover. Specifically, serotonin's roles in regulating cell shedding, apoptosis and barrier function of the epithelium. Using in vivo studies in mouse and a robust model of differentiated human mammary duct epithelium (MCF10A), we show that serotonin induces mammary epithelial cell shedding and disrupts tight junctions in a reversible manner. However, upon sustained exposure, serotonin induces apoptosis in the replenishing cell population, causing irreversible changes to the epithelial membrane. The staggered nature of these events induced by serotonin slowly shifts the balance in the epithelium from reversible to irreversible. These finding have very important implications towards our ability to control epithelial regeneration and thus address pathologies of aberrant epithelial turnover, which range from degenerative disorders (e.g.; pancreatitis and thyrioditis) to proliferative disorders (e.g.; mastitis, ductal ectasia, cholangiopathies and epithelial cancers)."
https://openalex.org/W1991169444,"SCRAPPER, an F-box protein coded by FBXL20, is a subunit of SCF type E3 ubiquitin ligase. SCRAPPER localizes synapses and directly binds to Rab3-interacting molecule 1 (RIM1), an essential factor for synaptic vesicle release, thus it regulates neural transmission via RIM1 degradation. A defect in SCRAPPER leads to neurotransmission abnormalities, which could subsequently result in neurodegenerative phenotypes. Because it is likely that the alteration of neural transmission in Scrapper mutant mice affect their systemic condition, we have analyzed the behavioral phenotypes of mice with decreased or increased the amount of SCRAPPER. We carried out a series of behavioral test batteries for Scrapper mutant mice. Scrapper transgenic mice overexpressing SCRAPPER in the hippocampus did not show any significant difference in every test argued in this manuscript by comparison with wild-type mice. On the other hand, heterozygotes of Scrapper knockout [SCR (+/−)] mice showed significant difference in the contextual but not cued fear conditioning test. In addition, SCR (+/−) mice altered in some tests reflecting anxiety, which implies the loss of functions of SCRAPPER in the hippocampus. The behavioral phenotypes of Scrapper mutant mice suggest that molecular degradation conferred by SCRAPPER play important roles in hippocampal-dependent fear memory formation."

GSH efflux increases in hepatocytes isolated from mice bearing liver or lung metastases, thus suggesting a systemic mechanism. Fractionation of serum-free conditioned medium from cultured B16-F10 cells and monoclonal antibody-induced neutralization techniques facilitated identification of interleukin (IL)-6 as a tumor-derived molecule promoting GSH efflux in hepatocytes. IL-6 activates GSH release through a methionine-sensitive/organic anion transporter polypeptide 1- and multidrug resistance protein 1-independent channel located on the sinusoidal site of hepatocytes. Specific siRNAs were used to knock down key factors in the main signaling pathways activated by IL-6, which revealed a STAT3-dependent mechanism. Our results show that IL-6 (mainly of tumor origin in B16-F10-bearing mice) may facilitate GSH release from hepatocytes and its interorgan transport to metastatic growing foci."
https://openalex.org/W2002601640,"Selenocysteine (Sec) residues occur in thiol oxidoreductase families, and functionally characterized selenoenzymes typically have a single Sec residue used directly for redox catalysis. However, how new Sec residues evolve and whether non-catalytic Sec residues exist in proteins is not known. Here, we computationally identified several genes with multiple Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) elements, one of which was a methionine-R-sulfoxide reductase (MsrB) homolog from Metridium senile that has four in-frame UGA codons and two nearly identical SECIS elements. One of the UGA codons corresponded to the conserved catalytic Sec or Cys in MsrBs, whereas the three other UGA codons evolved recently and had no homologs with Sec or Cys in these positions. Metabolic (75)Se labeling showed that all four in-frame UGA codons supported Sec insertion and that both SECIS elements were functional and collaborated in Sec insertion at each UGA codon. Interestingly, recombinant M. senile MsrB bound iron, and further analyses suggested the possibility of binding an iron-sulfur cluster by the protein. These data show that Sec residues may appear transiently in genes containing SECIS elements and be adapted for non-catalytic functions."
https://openalex.org/W2031071752,"Background Epilepsy is a severe neurological disorder affecting a large number of individuals, yet the underlying genetic risk factors for epilepsy remain unclear. Recent studies have revealed several recurrent copy number variations (CNVs) that are more likely to be associated with epilepsy. The responsible gene(s) within these regions have yet to be definitively linked to the disorder, and the implications of their interactions are not fully understood. Identification of these genes may contribute to a better pathological understanding of epilepsy, and serve to implicate novel therapeutic targets for further research. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we examined genes within heterozygous deletion regions identified in a recent large-scale study, encompassing a diverse spectrum of epileptic syndromes. By integrating additional protein-protein interaction data, we constructed subnetworks for these CNV-region genes and also those previously studied for epilepsy. We observed 20 genes common to both networks, primarily concentrated within a small molecular network populated by GABA receptor, BDNF/MAPK signaling, and estrogen receptor genes. From among the hundreds of genes in the initial networks, these were designated by convergent evidence for their likely association with epilepsy. Importantly, the identified molecular network was found to contain complex interrelationships, providing further insight into epilepsy's underlying pathology. We further performed pathway enrichment and crosstalk analysis and revealed a functional map which indicates the significant enrichment of closely related neurological, immune, and kinase regulatory pathways. Conclusions/Significance The convergent framework we proposed here provides a unique and powerful approach to screening and identifying promising disease genes out of typically hundreds to thousands of genes in disease-related CNV-regions. Our network and pathway analysis provides important implications for the underlying molecular mechanisms for epilepsy. The strategy can be applied for the study of other complex diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1994450781,"Cilostazol, a type-3 phosphodiesterase (PDE3) inhibitor, has become widely used as an antiplatelet drug worldwide. A recent second Cilostazol Stroke Prevention Study demonstrated that cilostazol is superior to aspirin for prevention of stroke after an ischemic stroke. However, its precise mechanisms of action remain to be determined. Here, we report that cilostazol, but not the PDE3 inhibitors cilostamide and milrinone, significantly potentiated nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. Furthermore, specific inhibitors for the endoplasmic reticulum protein inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) receptors and several common signaling pathways (PLC-γ, PI3K, Akt, p38 MAPK, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and the Ras/Raf/ERK/MAPK) significantly blocked the potentiation of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth by cilostazol. Using a proteomics analysis, we identified that levels of eukaryotic translation elongation factor eEF1A1 protein were significantly increased by treatment with cilostazol, but not cilostamide, in PC12 cells. Moreover, the potentiating effects of cilostazol on NGF-induced neurite outgrowth were significantly antagonized by treatment with eEF1A1 RNAi, but not the negative control of eEF1A1. These findings suggest that eEF1A1 and several common cellular signaling pathways might play a role in the mechanism of cilostazol-induced neurite outgrowth. Therefore, agents that can increase the eEF1A1 protein may have therapeutic relevance in diverse conditions with altered neurite outgrowth."
https://openalex.org/W1990922204,"We present a new antiviral strategy and research tool that could be applied to a wide range of enveloped viruses that infect human beings via membrane fusion. We test this strategy on two emerging zoonotic henipaviruses that cause fatal encephalitis in humans, Nipah (NiV) and Hendra (HeV) viruses. In the new approach, artificial cell-like particles (protocells) presenting membrane receptors in a biomimetic manner were developed and found to attract and inactivate henipavirus envelope glycoprotein pseudovirus particles, preventing infection. The protocells do not accumulate virus during the inactivation process. The use of protocells that interact with, but do not accumulate, viruses may provide significant advantages over current antiviral drugs, and this general approach may have wide potential for antiviral development."
https://openalex.org/W1991388003,"Background PINCH1, an adaptor protein containing five LIM domains, plays an important role in regulating the integrin-mediated cell adhesion, migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. PINCH1 is induced in the fibrotic kidney after injury, and it primarily localizes at the sites of focal adhesion. Whether it can translocate to the nucleus and directly participate in gene regulation is completely unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings Using cultured glomerular podocytes as a model system, we show that PINCH1 expression was induced by TGF-β1, a fibrogenic cytokine that promotes podocyte dysfunction. Interestingly, increased PINCH1 not only localized at the sites of focal adhesions, but also underwent nuclear translocation after TGF-β1 stimulation. This nuclear translocation of PINCH1 was apparently dependent on the putative nuclear export/localization signals (NES/NLS) at its C-terminus, as deletion or site-directed mutations abolished its nuclear shuttling. Co-immunoprecipitation and pull-down experiments revealed that PINCH1 interacted with Wilms tumor 1 protein (WT1), a nuclear transcription factor that is essential for regulating podocyte-specific gene expression in adult kidney. Interaction of PINCH1 and WT1 was mediated by the LIM1 domain of PINCH1 and C-terminal zinc-finger domain of WT1, which led to the suppression of the WT1-mediated podocalyxin expression in podocytes. PINCH1 also repressed podocalyxin gene transcription in a promoter-luciferase reporter assay. Conclusion/Significance These results indicate that PINCH1 can shuttle into the nucleus from cytoplasm in podocytes, wherein it interacts with WT1 and suppresses podocyte-specific gene expression. Our studies reveal a previously unrecognized, novel function of PINCH1, in which it acts as a transcriptional regulator through controlling specific gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2087956226,"The marked hypermuscularity in mice with constitutive myostatin deficiency reduces fat accumulation and hyperglycemia induced by high-fat feeding, but it is unclear whether the smaller increase in muscle mass caused by postdevelopmental loss of myostatin activity has beneficial metabolic effects during high-fat feeding. We therefore examined how postdevelopmental myostatin knockout influenced effects of high-fat feeding. Male mice with ubiquitous expression of tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase were fed tamoxifen for 2 weeks at 4 months of age. This depleted myostatin in mice with floxed myostatin genes, but not in control mice with normal myostatin genes. Some mice were fed a high-fat diet (60% of energy) for 22 weeks, starting 2 weeks after cessation of tamoxifen feeding. Myostatin depletion increased skeletal muscle mass ∼30%. Hypermuscular mice had ∼50% less weight gain than control mice over the first 8 weeks of high-fat feeding. During the subsequent 3 months of high-fat feeding, additional weight gain was similar in control and myostatin-deficient mice. After 5 months of high-fat feeding, the mass of epididymal and retroperitoneal fat pads was similar in control and myostatin-deficient mice even though myostatin depletion reduced the weight gain attributable to the high-fat diet (mean weight with high-fat diet minus mean weight with low-fat diet: 19.9 g in control mice, 14.1 g in myostatin-deficient mice). Myostatin depletion did not alter fasting blood glucose levels after 3 or 5 months of high-fat feeding, but reduced glucose levels measured 90 min after intraperitoneal glucose injection. Myostatin depletion also attenuated hepatic steatosis and accumulation of fat in muscle tissue. We conclude that blocking myostatin signaling after maturity can attenuate some of the adverse effects of a high-fat diet."
https://openalex.org/W2005340007,"Influx of calcium is an essential but insufficient signal in sustained nutrient-stimulated insulin secretion, and increased metabolic rate of the beta cell is also required. The aim of the study was to test the hypothesis that the reduced state of cytochrome c is a metabolic co-factor necessary for insulin secretion, over and above its participation in the ATP-generating function of electron transport/oxidative phosphorylation. We found that nutrient stimulation of insulin secretion by isolated rat islets was strongly correlated with reduced cytochrome c, and agents that acutely and specifically reduced cytochrome c led to increased insulin secretion, even in the face of decreased oxygen consumption and calcium influx. In contrast, neither sites 1 nor 4 of the electron transport chain were both necessary and essential for the stimulation of insulin secretion to occur. Importantly, stimulation of islets with glucose, α-ketoisocaproate, or glyceraldehyde resulted in the appearance of cytochrome c in the cytosol, suggesting a pathway for the regulation of exocytotic machinery by reduction of cytochrome c. The data suggest that the metabolic factor essential for sustained calcium-stimulated insulin secretion to occur is linked to reduction and translocation of cytochrome c.

The data suggest that the metabolic factor essential for sustained calcium-stimulated insulin secretion to occur is linked to reduction and translocation of cytochrome c. IntroductionIt is well established that a major determinant in the development of Type 2 diabetes is failure of pancreatic beta cells to compensate for increased demand for insulin secretion (1Prentki M. Nolan C.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 1802-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar, 2Leahy J.L. Arch. Med. Res. 2005; 36: 197-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). It follows that there is a critical need to understand the fundamental mechanisms regulating insulin secretion. An essential factor for sustained insulin secretory response to glucose is an increase in calcium (Ca2+) influx via L-type Ca2+ channels (3Grodsky G.M. Bennett L.L. Diabetes. 1966; 15: 910-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 4Bokvist K. Eliasson L. Ammälä C. Renström E. Rorsman P.

Chem. 2008; 283: 24334-24342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This increased Ca2+ influx occurs when the metabolism of glucose generates ATP, leading to the closure of ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels and the resultant opening of voltage-dependent L-type Ca2+ channels (7Cook D.L. Hales C.N. Nature. 1984; 311: 271-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). However, it is recognized that increased Ca2+ in the absence of the elevated metabolic rate does not elicit second-phase insulin secretion (8Henquin J.C. Diabetologia. 2009; 52: 739-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 9Prentki M. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1996; 134: 272-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). For example, at low glucose, agents that increased Ca2+ influx such as potassium (K+) (10Gembal M. Detimary P. Gilon P. Gao Z.Y. Henquin J.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 871-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), tolbutamide, or arginine (11Ishiyama N. Ravier M.A. Henquin J.C. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2006; 290: E540-E549Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) elicited only a rapid transient response in insulin secretion that quickly waned. Thus, there are additional co-factors generated when substrates are metabolized that in concert with Ca2+ are essential for a physiologic response of insulin secretion.These factors have been long sought after as reviewed (12Deeney J.T.

Callis J. Reems J. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), we noticed that sustained insulin secretion never occurred unless accompanied by an increase in this parameter. An increase in cytochrome c reduction occurred in response to changes in metabolic substrates that can independently increase insulin secretion such as glucose and α-ketoisocaproate (KIC), 2The abbreviations used are: KICα-ketoisocaproateCMCPCa2+/metabolic coupling processETCelectron transport chainISRinsulin secretion rateK+potassiumKATPATP-sensitive potassium channelKCNpotassium cyanideOCRoxygen consumption rateTMPDN,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine dihydrochlorideFCCPcarbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazoneRFUrelative fluorescence unit. but not with potentiators of nutrient-stimulated insulin secretion such as GLP-1, arginine, and acetylcholine that do not have an affect on ISR in the absence of nutrients. Notably, cytochrome c reduction did not change in response to agents that altered the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) due to changes in workload (18Sweet I.R. Cook D.L. DeJulio E. Wallen A.R. Khalil G. Callis J. Reems J. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 19Sweet I.R. Gilbert M. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 3509-3519Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), an intuitively requisite attribute for a control element that would faithfully transduce the glucose signal. Thus, we reasoned that cytochrome c reduction behaves like an ideal signal transduction mechanism supporting the function of the beta cell as a glucose sensor that would be independent of metabolic need by intracellular processes. Cytochrome c is the only protein in the electron transport chain (ETC) that is mobile, and is a known regulatory protein representing a committed step in apoptosis by binding to APAF-1 (20Schafer Z.T. Kornbluth S. Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 549-561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In addition, its reductive state is linked to the generation of reactive oxygen species (21Leloup C. Tourrel-Cuzin C. Magnan C. Karaca M. Castel J. Carneiro L. Colombani A.L. Ktorza A. Casteilla L.

EMBO J. 2009; 28: 417-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), factors thought to stimulate ISR. Based on these data we hypothesized that the reduction of cytochrome c is a metabolic co-factor necessary for Ca2+-mediated insulin secretion, over and above its participation in the ATP-generating function of ETC/oxidative phosphorylation.In addition to testing this hypothesis, in this study, we endeavored to elucidate where in the stimulus-secretion coupling pathway reduced cytochrome c might act. Our predictions of how the essential metabolic factor could facilitate Ca2+-stimulated insulin secretion were based on a conceptual model we developed over that past 5 years. The primary data supporting the model includes the findings that glucose-stimulated Ca2+ influx is associated with about 35% of total glucose-stimulated OCR, a measurement that was tightly correlated with ISR (19Sweet I.R. Gilbert M. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 3509-3519Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These findings suggested that Ca2+-sensitive OCR reflects a highly energetic process that couples Ca2+ to the secretion of insulin (6Gilbert M. Jung S.R. Reed B.J. Sweet I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 24334-24342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In lieu of the identification of the proteins involved with this process, we termed this process the Ca2+/metabolic coupling process (CMCP) (24Jung S.R. Reed B.J. Sweet I.R. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2009; 297: E717-E727Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Further studies revealed that potentiation of the insulin secretion rate (ISR) by protein kinase C (PKC) and cAMP-dependent pathways occur with only very small changes in OCR, demonstrating that activation of insulin secretion by these mechanisms is mediated by steps that are downstream of the CMCP (6Gilbert M. Jung S.R. Reed B.J. Sweet I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 24334-24342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Based on the findings that increased Ca2+ influx did not stimulate ISR at subthreshold concentrations of glucose (25Malaisse-Lagae F. Mathias P.C. Malaisse W.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 123: 1062-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), we predicted that the CMCP and ISR would be dually regulated upstream by both Ca2+ and the metabolic co-factor reduced cytochrome c as shown in Fig. 1.To test our predictions, we compared responses by isolated rat islets to the stimulation of various secretagogues, metabolic poisons, and other agents selected to separate the proposed signaling function of reduced cytochrome c from its established role in the mitochondrial generation of ATP. Measured parameters included reduced cytochrome c and cytochrome c oxidase, OCR, NAD(P)H, Ca2+ influx, and ISR assessed in real time. We subsequently tested the possibility that reduced cytochrome c interacts with cytosolic processes mediating exocytosis by its translocation from the mitochondria to the cytosol.

Further studies revealed that potentiation of the insulin secretion rate (ISR) by protein kinase C (PKC) and cAMP-dependent pathways occur with only very small changes in OCR, demonstrating that activation of insulin secretion by these mechanisms is mediated by steps that are downstream of the CMCP (6Gilbert M. Jung S.R. Reed B.J. Sweet I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 24334-24342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Based on the findings that increased Ca2+ influx did not stimulate ISR at subthreshold concentrations of glucose (25Malaisse-Lagae F. Mathias P.C. Malaisse W.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 123: 1062-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), we predicted that the CMCP and ISR would be dually regulated upstream by both Ca2+ and the metabolic co-factor reduced cytochrome c as shown in Fig. 1.To test our predictions, we compared responses by isolated rat islets to the stimulation of various secretagogues, metabolic poisons, and other agents selected to separate the proposed signaling function of reduced cytochrome c from its established role in the mitochondrial generation of ATP. Measured parameters included reduced cytochrome c and cytochrome c oxidase, OCR, NAD(P)H, Ca2+ influx, and ISR assessed in real time. We subsequently tested the possibility that reduced cytochrome c interacts with cytosolic processes mediating exocytosis by its translocation from the mitochondria to the cytosol. It is well established that a major determinant in the development of Type 2 diabetes is failure of pancreatic beta cells to compensate for increased demand for insulin secretion (1Prentki M. Nolan C.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 1802-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar, 2Leahy J.L. Arch. Med. Res. 2005; 36: 197-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). It follows that there is a critical need to understand the fundamental mechanisms regulating insulin secretion. An essential factor for sustained insulin secretory response to glucose is an increase in calcium (Ca2+) influx via L-type Ca2+ channels (3Grodsky G.M. Bennett L.L. Diabetes. 1966; 15: 910-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 4Bokvist K. Eliasson L. Ammälä C. Renström E. Rorsman P.

Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4589-4601Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 6Gilbert M. Jung S.R. Reed B.J. Sweet I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 24334-24342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This increased Ca2+ influx occurs when the metabolism of glucose generates ATP, leading to the closure of ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels and the resultant opening of voltage-dependent L-type Ca2+ channels (7Cook D.L. Hales C.N. Nature. 1984; 311: 271-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). However, it is recognized that increased Ca2+ in the absence of the elevated metabolic rate does not elicit second-phase insulin secretion (8Henquin J.C. Diabetologia. 2009; 52: 739-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 9Prentki M. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1996; 134: 272-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). For example, at low glucose, agents that increased Ca2+ influx such as potassium (K+) (10Gembal M. Detimary P. Gilon P. Gao Z.Y. Henquin J.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 871-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), tolbutamide, or arginine (11Ishiyama N. Ravier M.A. Henquin J.C. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2006; 290: E540-E549Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) elicited only a rapid transient response in insulin secretion that quickly waned. Thus, there are additional co-factors generated when substrates are metabolized that in concert with Ca2+ are essential for a physiologic response of insulin secretion. These factors have been long sought after as reviewed (12Deeney J.T. Prentki M. Corkey B.E. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 13Ishihara H.

Diabetes Metab. 1994; 20: 132-137PubMed Google Scholar) and long chain acyl-CoA (12Deeney J.T. Prentki M. Corkey B.E. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Since we first began measuring reduced cytochrome c in rat islets (18Sweet I.R. Cook D.L. DeJulio E. Wallen A.R. Khalil G. Callis J. Reems J. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), we noticed that sustained insulin secretion never occurred unless accompanied by an increase in this parameter. An increase in cytochrome c reduction occurred in response to changes in metabolic substrates that can independently increase insulin secretion such as glucose and α-ketoisocaproate (KIC), 2The abbreviations used are: KICα-ketoisocaproateCMCPCa2+/metabolic coupling processETCelectron transport chainISRinsulin secretion rateK+potassiumKATPATP-sensitive potassium channelKCNpotassium cyanideOCRoxygen consumption rateTMPDN,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine dihydrochlorideFCCPcarbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazoneRFUrelative fluorescence unit. but not with potentiators of nutrient-stimulated insulin secretion such as GLP-1, arginine, and acetylcholine that do not have an affect on ISR in the absence of nutrients. Notably, cytochrome c reduction did not change in response to agents that altered the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) due to changes in workload (18Sweet I.R. Cook D.L. DeJulio E. Wallen A.R. Khalil G. Callis J. Reems J. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 19Sweet I.R. Gilbert M. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 3509-3519Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), an intuitively requisite attribute for a control element that would faithfully transduce the glucose signal. Thus, we reasoned that cytochrome c reduction behaves like an ideal signal transduction mechanism supporting the function of the beta cell as a glucose sensor that would be independent of metabolic need by intracellular processes. Cytochrome c is the only protein in the electron transport chain (ETC) that is mobile, and is a known regulatory protein representing a committed step in apoptosis by binding to APAF-1 (20Schafer Z.T. Kornbluth S. Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 549-561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In addition, its reductive state is linked to the generation of reactive oxygen species (21Leloup C. Tourrel-Cuzin C. Magnan C. Karaca M. Castel J. Carneiro L. Colombani A.L. Ktorza A. Casteilla L.

EMBO J. 2009; 28: 417-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), factors thought to stimulate ISR. Based on these data we hypothesized that the reduction of cytochrome c is a metabolic co-factor necessary for Ca2+-mediated insulin secretion, over and above its participation in the ATP-generating function of ETC/oxidative phosphorylation. α-ketoisocaproate Ca2+/metabolic coupling process electron transport chain insulin secretion rate potassium ATP-sensitive potassium channel potassium cyanide oxygen consumption rate N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone relative fluorescence unit. In addition to testing this hypothesis, in this study, we endeavored to elucidate where in the stimulus-secretion coupling pathway reduced cytochrome c might act. Our predictions of how the essential metabolic factor could facilitate Ca2+-stimulated insulin secretion were based on a conceptual model we developed over that past 5 years. The primary data supporting the model includes the findings that glucose-stimulated Ca2+ influx is associated with about 35% of total glucose-stimulated OCR, a measurement that was tightly correlated with ISR (19Sweet I.R. Gilbert M. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 3509-3519Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These findings suggested that Ca2+-sensitive OCR reflects a highly energetic process that couples Ca2+ to the secretion of insulin (6Gilbert M. Jung S.R. Reed B.J. Sweet I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 24334-24342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2087704703,"Progress in the functional studies of human olfactory receptors has been largely hampered by the lack of a reliable experimental model system. Although transgenic approaches in mice could characterize the function of individual olfactory receptors, the presence of over 300 functional genes in the human genome becomes a daunting task. Thus, the characterization of individuals with a genetic susceptibility to altered olfaction coupled with the absence of particular olfactory receptor genes will allow phenotype/genotype correlations and vindicate the function of specific olfactory receptors with their cognate ligands. We characterized a 118 kb β-globin deletion and found that its 3′ end breakpoint extends to the neighboring olfactory receptor region downstream of the β-globin gene cluster. This deletion encompasses six contiguous olfactory receptor genes (OR51V1, OR52Z1, OR51A1P, OR52A1, OR52A5, and OR52A4) all of which are expressed in the brain. Topology analysis of the encoded proteins from these olfactory receptor genes revealed that OR52Z1, OR52A1, OR52A5, and OR52A4 are predicted to be functional receptors as they display integral characteristics of G-proteins coupled receptors. Individuals homozygous for the 118 kb β-globin deletion are afflicted with β-thalassemia due to a homozygous deletion of the β-globin gene and have no alleles for the above mentioned olfactory receptors genes. This is the first example of a homozygous deletion of olfactory receptor genes in human. Although altered olfaction remains to be ascertained in these individuals, such a study can be carried out in β-thalassemia patients from Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines where this mutation is common. Furthermore, OR52A1 contains a γ-globin enhancer, which was previously shown to confer continuous expression of the fetal γ-globin genes. Thus, the hypothesis that β-thalassemia individuals, who are homozygous for the 118 kb deletion, may also have an exacerbation of their anemia due to the deletion of two copies of the γ-globin enhancer element is worthy of consideration."

Furthermore, strength of seasonality was hypothesized to be associated with suicide prevalence. This study aimed at pointing out methodological difficulties in examining changes in suicide seasonality. METHODODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The present study examines the hypothesis of decreasing seasonality with a superior method that allows continuous modeling of seasonality. Suicides in Austria (1970-2008, N = 67,741) were analyzed with complex demodulation, a local (point-in-time specific) version of harmonic analysis. This avoids the need to arbitrarily split the time series, as is common practice in the field of suicide seasonality research, and facilitates incorporating the association with suicide prevalence. Regression models were used to assess time trends and association of amplitude and absolute suicide numbers. Results showed that strength of seasonality was associated with absolute suicide numbers, and that strength of seasonality was stable during the study period when this association was taken into account.Continuous modeling of suicide seasonality with complex demodulation avoids spurious findings that can result when time series are segmented and analyzed piecewise or when the association with suicide prevalence is disregarded."
https://openalex.org/W2135070833,"The direct isolation of integron gene cassettes from cultivated and environmental microbial sources allows an assessment of the impact of the integron/gene cassette system on the emergence of new phenotypes, such as drug resistance or virulence. A structural approach is being exploited to investigate the modularity and function of novel integron gene cassettes.We report the 1.8 Å crystal structure of Cass2, an integron-associated protein derived from an environmental V. cholerae. The structure defines a monomeric beta-barrel protein with a fold related to the effector-binding portion of AraC/XylS transcription activators. The closest homologs of Cass2 are multi-drug binding proteins, such as BmrR. Consistent with this, a binding pocket made up of hydrophobic residues and a single glutamate side chain is evident in Cass2, occupied in the crystal form by polyethylene glycol. Fluorescence assays demonstrate that Cass2 is capable of binding cationic drug compounds with submicromolar affinity. The Cass2 module possesses a protein interaction surface proximal to its drug-binding cavity with features homologous to those seen in multi-domain transcriptional regulators.Genetic analysis identifies Cass2 to be representative of a larger family of independent effector-binding proteins associated with lateral gene transfer within Vibrio and closely-related species. We propose that the Cass2 family not only has capacity to form functional transcription regulator complexes, but represents possible evolutionary precursors to multi-domain regulators associated with cationic drug compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2094361175,"General transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) and TFIIB-related factor (BRF), are conserved RNA polymerase II/III (RNAPII/III) selectivity factors that are involved in polymerase recruitment and transcription initiation in eukaryotes. Recent findings have shown that plants have evolved a third type of B-factor, plant-specific TFIIB-related protein 1 (pBRP1), which seems to be involved in RNAPI transcription. Here, we extend the repertoire of B-factors in plants by reporting the characterization of a novel TFIIB-related protein, plant-specific TFIIB-related protein 2 (pBRP2), which is found to date only in the Brassicacea family. Unlike other B-factors that are ubiquitously expressed, PBRP2 expression is restricted to reproductive organs and seeds as shown by RT-PCR, immunofluorescence labelling and GUS staining experiments. Interestingly, pbrp2 loss-of-function specifically affects the development of the syncytial endosperm, with both parental contributions required for wild-type development. pBRP2, is the first B-factor to exhibit cell-specific expression and regulation in eukaryotes, and might play a role in enforcing bi-parental reproduction in angiosperms."
https://openalex.org/W2144756608,"While various approaches exist to study protein localization, it is still a challenge to predict where proteins localize. Here, we consider a mechanistic viewpoint for membrane localization. Taking into account the steps for the folding pathway of α-helical membrane proteins and relating biophysical parameters to each of these steps, we create a score capable of predicting the propensity for membrane localization and call it FP3mem. This score is driven from the principal component analysis (PCA) of the biophysical parameters related to membrane localization. FP3mem allows us to rationalize the colocalization of a number of channel proteins with the Cav1.2 channel by their fewer propensities for membrane localization."
