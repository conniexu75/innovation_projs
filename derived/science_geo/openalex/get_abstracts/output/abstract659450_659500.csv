https://openalex.org/W3086044697,"Catastrophes are known to have an impact on relationships as well as on mental health. This study evaluated differences in several mental health and well-being measures according to relationship quality during the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic and related lockdown measures. A cross-sectional online survey was launched four weeks after lockdown measures were implemented in Austria. Relationship quality was measured with the Quality of Marriage Index (QMI), and mental health measures included quality of life (WHO-QOL BREF psychological domain), well-being (WHO-5), depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), stress (PSS-10), and sleep quality (ISI). ANOVAs with Bonferroni-corrected post-hoc tests and Chisquared tests were applied. In all mental health scales, individuals with good relationship quality (n = 543) scored better than individuals with poor relationship quality (n = 190) or without relationship (n = 272). The odds ratios (OR) between the poor and good relationship quality groups were 3.5 for the PHQ-9, 3.4 for the GAD-7, and 2.0 for the ISI. Additionally, individuals without no relationship scored better on all scales than individuals with poor relationship quality (all p-values < .05). Relationship quality was related to mental health during COVID-19. The prevalence of depressive symptoms increased according to relationship quality from 13% up to 35%. Relationship per se was not associated with better mental health, but the quality of the relationship was essential. Compared to no relationship, a good relationship quality was a protective factor whereas a poor relationship quality was a risk factor."
https://openalex.org/W3085351191,"In order to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2, much of the US was placed under social distancing guidelines during March 2020. We characterized risk perceptions and adherence to social distancing recommendations in March 2020 among US adults aged 18+ in an online survey with age and gender quotas to match the general US population (N = 713). We used multivariable logistic and linear regression to estimate associations between age (by generational cohort) and these outcomes. The median perceived risk of infection with COVID-19 within the next month was 32%, and 65% of individuals were practicing more social distancing than before the outbreak. Baby Boomers had lower perceived risk than Millennials (-10.6%, 95% CI: -16.2%, -5.0%), yet were more frequently social distancing (OR = 1.64; 95% CI: 1.05, 2.56). Public health outreach should focus on raising compliance with social distancing recommendations, especially among high risk groups. Efforts to address risk perceptions alone may be inadequate."
https://openalex.org/W3084465714,"Background Due to a high prevalence of chronic non-degenerative diseases, it is suspected that COVID 19 poses a high risk of fatal complications for the Mexican population. The present study aims to estimate the risk factors for hospitalization and death in the Mexican population infected by SARS-CoV-2. Methods and findings We used the publicly available data released by the Epidemiological Surveillance System for Viral Respiratory Diseases of the Mexican Ministry of Health (Secretaría de Salud, SSA). All records of positive SARS-CoV-2 cases were included. Two multiple logistic regression models were fitted to estimate the association between hospitalization and mortality, with other covariables. Data on 10,544 individuals (57.68% men), with mean age 46.47±15.62, were analyzed. Men were about 1.54 times more likely to be hospitalized than women (p<0.001, 95% C.I. 1.37–1.74); individuals aged 50–74 and ≥74 were more likely to be hospitalized than people aged 25–49 (OR 2.05, p<0.001, 95% C.I. 1.81–2.32, and OR 3.84, p<0.001, 95% C.I. 2.90–5.15, respectively). People with hypertension, obesity, and diabetes were more likely to be hospitalized than people without these comorbidities (p<0.01). Men had more risk of death in comparison to women (OR = 1.53, p<0.001, 95% C.I. 1.30–1.81) and individuals aged 50–74 and ≥75 were more likely to die than people aged 25–49 (OR 1.96, p<0.001, 95% C.I. 1.63–2.34, and OR 3.74, p<0.001, 95% C.I. 2.80–4.98, respectively). Hypertension, obesity, and diabetes presented in combination conveyed a higher risk of dying in comparison to not having these diseases (OR = 2.10; p<0.001, 95% C.I. 1.50–2.93). Hospitalization, intubation and pneumonia entail a higher risk of dying (OR 5.02, p<0.001, 95% C.I. 3.88–6.50; OR 4.27, p<0.001, 95% C.I. 3.26–5.59, and OR = 2.57; p<0.001, 95% C.I. 2.11–3.13, respectively). Our study’s main limitation is the lack of information on mild (asymptomatic) or moderate cases of COVID-19. Conclusions The present study points out that in Mexico, where an important proportion of the population has two or more chronic conditions simultaneously, a high mortality rate is a serious risk for those infected by SARS-CoV-2."
https://openalex.org/W3085501849,"Globally, little evidence exists on transmission patterns of COVID-19. Recommendations to prevent infection include appropriate and frequent handwashing plus physical and social distancing. We conducted an exploratory observational study to assess compliance with these recommendations in selected transportation stations in Ghana. A one-hour audit of 45 public transport stations in the Greater Accra region was carried out between 27th and 29th March 2020. Using an adapted World Health Organization (WHO) hand hygiene assessment scale, the availability and use of handwashing facilities, social distancing, and ongoing public education on COVID-19 prevention measures were assessed, weighted and scored to determine the level of compliance of stations. Compliance with recommendations was categorized as “inadequate” “basic”, “intermediate” and “advanced”, based on the overall score. Majority (80%) of stations in Accra have at least one Veronica Bucket with flowing water and soap, but the number of washing places at each station is not adequate. Only a small minority (18%) of stations were communicating the need to wash hands frequently and appropriately, and to practice social/physical distancing while at the station. In most stations (95%), hand washing practice was either not observed, or only infrequently. Almost all stations (93%) did not have alcohol-based hand sanitizers available for public use, while social distancing was rarely practiced (only 2%). In over 90% of the stations, face masks were either not worn or only worn by a few passengers. Compliance with COVID-19 prevention measures was inadequate in 13 stations, basic in 16 stations, intermediate in 7 stations, and advanced in 9 stations. Compliance with COVID-19 prevention measures in public transportation stations in the Greater Accra region remains a challenge. Awareness creation should aim to elevate COVID-19 risk perception of transportation operators and clients. Transport operators and stations need support and guidance to enforce hand washing and social distancing."
https://openalex.org/W3086141543,"Anemia in women of reproductive age is a major public health challenge for low- and middle-income countries with a long-term negative impact on the health of women, their children, and the economic growth of the society. Even though the world health organization targeted a 50% global reduction of anemia among women of reproductive age by 2025, with the current trend it is unlikely to achieve this goal.This study aimed to assess the prevalence and associated factors of anemia among women of reproductive age in eastern Africa.A secondary data analysis, using demographic and health survey (DHS) data of 10 eastern African countries, was conducted. For our study, a total weighted sample of 101524 women of reproductive age was used. We employed a multilevel mixed-effects generalized linear model (using Poisson regression with robust error variance). Both unadjusted and adjusted prevalence ratios with their 95% confidence interval were reported.The prevalence of anemia in eastern Africa was 34.85 (95%CI: 34.56-35.14) ranging from 19.23% in Rwanda to 53.98% in Mozambique. In the multivariable multilevel analysis, being older age, having primary and above education, being from households with second to highest wealth quantiles, being currently working, not perceiving distance as a big problem, use of modern contraceptive methods, and rural residence was associated with a lower prevalence of anemia. While, being married and divorced/separated/widowed, women from female-headed households, women from households with unimproved toilet facility and unimproved water source, ever had of a terminated pregnancy, having high parity, and being from large household size was associated with a higher prevalence of anemia.The prevalence of anemia in eastern Africa was relatively high. Both individual level and community level factors were associated with the prevalence of anemia in women of reproductive age. Therefore, giving special attention to those women who are at a higher prevalence of anemia such as younger women, those who are from households with low socioeconomic status, unimproved toilet facility, and source of drinking water, as well as pregnant women could decrease anemia in women of reproductive age."
https://openalex.org/W3021196615,"Background: COVID-19 is a critical pandemic that has affected human communities worldwide, and there is an urgent need to develop effective drugs. Although there are a large number of candidate drug compounds that may be useful for treating COVID-19, the evaluation of these drugs is time-consuming and costly. Thus, screening to identify potentially effective drugs prior to experimental validation is necessary. Method: In this study, we applied the recently proposed method tensor decomposition (TD)-based unsupervised feature extraction (FE) to gene expression profiles of multiple lung cancer cell lines infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. We identified drug candidate compounds that significantly altered the expression of the 163 genes selected by TD-based unsupervised FE. Results: Numerous drugs were successfully screened, including many known antiviral drug compounds such as C646, chelerythrine chloride, canertinib, BX-795, sorafenib, sorafenib, QL-X-138, radicicol, A-443654, CGP-60474, alvocidib, mitoxantrone, QL-XII-47, geldanamycin, fluticasone, atorvastatin, quercetin, motexafin gadolinium, trovafloxacin, doxycycline, meloxicam, gentamicin, and dibromochloromethane. The screen also identified ivermectin, which was first identified as an anti-parasite drug and recently the drug was included in clinical trials for SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions: The drugs screened using our strategy may be effective candidates for treating patients with COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3085543442,"Background There are no reliable and validated objective biomarkers for the assessment of depression severity. We aimed to investigate the association between depression severity and timing-related speech features using speech recognition technology. Method Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), those with bipolar disorder (BP), and healthy controls (HC) were asked to engage in a non-structured interview with research psychologists. Using automated speech recognition technology, we measured three timing-related speech features: speech rate, pause time, and response time. The severity of depression was assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 17-item version (HAMD-17). We conducted the current study to answer the following questions: 1) Are there differences in speech features among MDD, BP, and HC? 2) Do speech features correlate with depression severity? 3) Do changes in speech features correlate with within-subject changes in depression severity? Results We collected 1058 data sets from 241 individuals for the study (97 MDD, 68 BP, and 76 HC). There were significant differences in speech features among groups; depressed patients showed slower speech rate, longer pause time, and longer response time than HC. All timing-related speech features showed significant associations with HAMD-17 total scores. Longitudinal changes in speech rate correlated with changes in HAMD-17 total scores. Conclusions Depressed individuals showed longer response time, longer pause time, and slower speech rate than healthy individuals, all of which were suggestive of psychomotor retardation. Our study suggests that speech features could be used as objective biomarkers for the assessment of depression severity."
https://openalex.org/W3085758173,"Android is the most widely used mobile operating system (OS). A large number of third-party Android application (app) markets have emerged. The absence of third-party market regulation has prompted research institutions to propose different malware detection techniques. However, due to improvements of malware itself and Android system, it is difficult to design a detection method that can efficiently and effectively detect malicious apps for a long time. Meanwhile, adopting more features will increase the complexity of the model and the computational cost of the system. Permissions play a vital role in the security of the Android apps. Term Frequency—Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) is used to assess the importance of a word for a file set in a corpus. The static analysis method does not need to run the app. It can efficiently and accurately extract the permissions from an app. Based on this cognition and perspective, in this paper, a new static detection method based on TF-IDF and Machine Learning is proposed. The system permissions are extracted in Android application package’s (Apk’s) manifest file. TF-IDF algorithm is used to calculate the permission value (PV) of each permission and the sensitivity value of apk (SVOA) of each app. The SVOA and the number of the used permissions are learned and tested by machine learning. 6070 benign apps and 9419 malware are used to evaluate the proposed approach. The experiment results show that only use dangerous permissions or the number of used permissions can’t accurately distinguish whether an app is malicious or benign. For malware detection, the proposed approach achieve up to 99.5% accuracy and the learning and training time only needs 0.05s. For malware families detection, the accuracy is 99.6%. The results indicate that the method for unknown/new sample’s detection accuracy is 92.71%. Compared against other state-of-the-art approaches, the proposed approach is more effective by detecting malware and malware families."
https://openalex.org/W3086979630,"Background Obesity is a crucial public health problem and is rising globally. This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of obesity and its associated factors among the elderly in Malaysia. Methods Data were obtained from the National Health and Morbidity Survey (NHMS) 2015. This was a cross sectional population-based study using a two stage stratified random sampling design. Elderly population aged 60 years and above was selected. Data were collected using pre-tested self-administered questionnaire in the form of sociodemographic profile, non-communicable diseases (NCD) comorbidities (status on hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolemia) and NCD risk factors (current smoker and physical activity). Obesity has been defined using the World Health Organization (WHO) Body Mass Index (BMI) guideline, 1998. A complex sampling design analysis was used for the descriptive statistics. The associated risk factors for obesity were identified using Multiple Logistic Regression analysis. Results A total of 3794 respondents were included in this study. The prevalence of obesity among Malaysian elderly was 30.2%. The prevalence of obesity among the elderly was significantly higher in females, respondents from urban areas and Indians. Approximately one third of the elderly with non-communicable diseases such as hypertension (33.1%) and diabetes (38.8%), respectively, were obese. Among elderly who were obese, majority of them (89.8%) had at least one NCD. The prevalence of obesity was 16.8% among current smokers (aOR 0.59). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that elderly females (aOR [adjusted odds ratio] 1.52), having secondary education (aOR 1.96) with household income of RM 3000 and above (aOR 1.57) as well as being hypertensive (aOR 1.61) and diabetic (aOR 1.50) were more likely to be obese. In contrast, the Chinese elderly respondents (aOR 0.62) and current smokers (aOR 0.59) were less likely to be obese. There were no significant associations of obesity with hypercholesterolemia or with physical activity. Conclusions A substantial proportion of Malaysian elderly were obese, and factors associated with obesity among them were being female, having secondary education with a household income of RM 3000 and above and being hypertensive or diabetic. Enhanced health promotion and education should be targeted at younger people in order to prevent obesity in the later years."
https://openalex.org/W3085323195,"Human-wildlife conflict is difficult to measure, but the analysis of records from wildlife rehabilitation facilities has shown potential as a technique for characterizing human impacts on wildlife. To examine the value of wildlife rehabilitation records for characterizing local human-wildlife conflicts and prevalence of select wildlife diseases, we reviewed 45,668 records representing over 280 species admitted to a wildlife rehabilitation facility over a 10-year period (2005–2014). We identified the most frequently recorded causes of admission for commonly admitted species, and evaluated how causes of admission may vary across taxa throughout the year. Our analyses support the value of wildlife rehabilitation facility data for characterizing some pressures from human-wildlife conflict and select disease trends for certain taxa, as well as utility for informing topics to emphasize in local conservation education efforts. For example, orphaned neonatal wildlife accounted for the largest proportion of admissions to this facility, and highlights a opportunity for conservation education regarding when wildlife is truly orphaned and requires professional intervention. Additionally, domestic dog attack cases accounted for a proportion of admissions comparable to that of domestic cat attacks, demonstrating a need for the conversation surrounding the impact of domestic pets on local wildlife to expand to include dogs in addition to cats."
https://openalex.org/W3085479744,"Bifidobacterium breve M-16V is a probiotic bacterial strain with efficacy in infants achieved by suppressing T-helper type (Th) 2 immune responses and modulating the systemic Th1/Th2 balance. Exposure to air pollution during pregnancy increases asthma susceptibility in offspring. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the maternal intake of B. breve M-16V on susceptibility to asthma accelerated by prenatal exposure to air pollution. The intake of B. breve M-16V in residual oil fly ash (ROFA)-exposed pregnant mice resulted in fewer eosinophils in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of neonatal mice and reduced allergic lung inflammation. The expressions of Th2 cytokines including IL-5 and IL-13 were decreased in neonatal mice from ROFA-exposed mothers fed B. breve M-16V. The analysis of fecal microbiota from neonatal mice revealed that the intake of B. breve M-16V by mothers changed the composition of fecal microbiota in neonatal mice, which resulted in a decreased population of Firmicutes. Moreover, several bacterial strains of fecal microbiota from neonatal mice had a strong correlation with Th2 cytokines and histological score. These results suggest that the maternal intake of M-16V might have beneficial effects in neonates by preventing and/or alleviating allergic reactions accelerated by prenatal exposure to air pollution."
https://openalex.org/W3085804368,"Association between electroencephalography (EEG) and individually personal information is being explored by the scientific community. Though person identification using EEG is an attraction among researchers, the complexity of sensing limits using such technologies in real-world applications. In this research, the challenge has been addressed by reducing the complexity of the brain signal acquisition and analysis processes. This was achieved by reducing the number of electrodes, simplifying the critical task without compromising accuracy. Event-related potentials (ERP), a.k.a. time-locked stimulation, was used to collect data from each subject’s head. Following a relaxation period, each subject was visually presented a random four-digit number and then asked to think of it for 10 seconds. Fifteen trials were conducted with each subject with relaxation and visual stimulation phases preceding each mental recall segment. We introduce a novel derived feature, dubbed Inter-Hemispheric Amplitude Ratio (IHAR), which expresses the ratio of amplitudes of laterally corresponding electrode pairs. The feature was extracted after expanding the training set using signal augmentation techniques and tested with several machine learning (ML) algorithms, including Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN). Most of the ML algorithms showed 100% accuracy with 14 electrodes, and according to our results, perfect accuracy can also be achieved using fewer electrodes. However, AF3, AF4, F7, and F8 electrode combination with kNN classifier which yielded 99.0±0.8% testing accuracy is the best for person identification to maintain both user-friendliness and performance. Surprisingly, the relaxation phase manifested the highest accuracy of the three phases."
https://openalex.org/W3085129208,"Exotic ambrosia beetles are increasing in Europe due to global trade and global warming. Among these xylomycetophagous insects, Xylosandrus compactus (Eichhoff) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is a serious threat for several Mediterranean host plants. Carob trees growing in Sicily (Italy) have been extensively attacked by beetles leading to rapid tree decline. Although X. compactus has been found in Europe for several years, most aspects of its ecology are still unknown. We thus studied the population structure and dynamics of X. compactus, together with its twig size preference during a sampling of infested carob trees in south east Sicily. In addition, fungi associated with insects or galleries were isolated and characterized. The results showed that, in this newly-colonized environment and host plant, adult X. compactus overwinters inside twigs and starts to fly and reproduce in mid spring, completing five generations before overwintering in late fall. The mean diameter of carob twigs infested by the beetle varied significantly over the seasons, with the insect tending to infest larger twigs as season progresses. The mean number of adults/gallery was 19.21, ranging from 6 to 28. The minimum temperature significantly affected the overwintering adult mortality. Ambrosiella xylebori and Fusarium solani were the main symbionts associated with the pest in this study. Acremonium sp. was instead recorded for the first time in Europe inside X. compactus galleries. Several other fungi species were also found for the first time in association with X. compactus. Our findings provide useful insights into the sustainable management of this noxious pest."
https://openalex.org/W3086121256,"Sleep duration and quality have several effects on human health. Some previous studies have shown an association between sleep duration and quality and mental health, but the results of those studies were inconsistent. Additionally, studies on sleep duration and its impact on depressive symptoms specifically among young Chinese adults are limited. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the association between duration and quality of sleep and depressive symptoms among Chinese university students. We designed a cross-sectional study comprising 9,515 Chinese university students. Sleep duration and quality were assessed using a self-reported questionnaire. Depressive symptoms were assessed based on the Self-rating Depression Scale score. Logistic regression models were used to analyze the association between sleep duration and quality and depressive symptoms. The results showed that good sleep quality was associated with a lower prevalence of depressive symptoms. In the final adjusted model, the odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the prevalence of depressive symptoms in those with poor sleep quality compared with those with normal and good sleep quality were 0.88 (0.77, 1.01) and 0.82 (0.81, 0.96), respectively (p for trend = 0.014). Moreover, short sleep duration was associated with a higher prevalence of depressive symptoms based on the crude model and final adjusted model (p for trend = 0.048 and 0.042, respectively). Poor sleep quality and short sleep duration were associated with a higher prevalence of depressive symptoms in this study population. These results suggest that reduced sleep duration and quality may be risk factors for mental health disorders among university students."
https://openalex.org/W3086445761,"Ridehailing services such as Uber have been promoted as viable interventions for curbing alcohol-involved driving fatalities. However, evidence of ridehailing's impact has been mixed, with some studies finding no association but others finding either an increase or a decrease in fatalities. We contribute to this literature by examining more recent years of data, which capture a period during which Uber ridership has grown substantially and alcohol-involved fatalities have increased. Furthermore, we test whether the relationship between Uber availability and traffic fatalities depends on local characteristics. We employ multivariate regression models to test the association between Uber availability and total, alcohol-involved, and weekend and holiday-specific traffic fatalities in the 100 most populated metropolitan areas in the United States between 2009 and 2017. We find that Uber availability is not associated with changes in total, alcohol-involved, and weekend and holiday-specific traffic fatalities in aggregate, yet it is associated with increased traffic fatalities in urban, densely populated counties."
https://openalex.org/W3086870898,"The study aimed at assessing the acute physiological effects of running a 65-km vs a 107-km mountain ultramarathon. Nineteen athletes (15 males and 4 females) from the shorter race and forty three athletes (26 males and 17 females) from the longer race were enrolled. Body weight, respiratory and lower limb strength were assessed before and after the race. Blood samples were obtained before, after and 24-h post-race. Body weight loss did not differ between races. A decrease in squat jump height (p<0.01; d = 1.4), forced vital capacity (p<0.01; d = 0.5), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (p<0.01; d = 0.6), peak inspiratory flow (p<0.01; d = 0.6) and maximal inspiratory pressure (p<0.01; d = 0.8) was observed after the longer race; while, after the shorter race only maximal inspiratory pressure declined (p<0.01; d = 0.5). Greater post-race concentrations of creatine kinase (p<0.01; d = 0.9) and C-reactive protein (p<0.01; d = 2.3) were observed following the longer race, while high-sensitivity cardiac troponin was higher after the shorter race (p<0.01; d = 0.3). Sodium decreased post-competition only after the shorter race (p = 0.02; d = 0.6), while creatinine increased only following the longer race (p<0.01; d = 1.5). In both groups, glomerular filtration rate declined at post-race (longer race: p<0.01, d = 2.1; shorter race: p = 0.01, d = 1.4) and returned to baseline values at 24 h post-race. In summary, expiratory and lower-limb fatigue, and muscle damage and inflammatory response were greater following the longer race; while a higher release of cardiac troponins was observed after the shorter race. The alteration and restoration of renal function was similar after either race."

This study seeks to provide trends and analysis from the provincial BC THN program since inception in 2012 to the end of 2018.BC THN shipment and distribution records from 2012-2018 were retrieved. Frequency distributions were used to describe characteristics of individuals accessing the program. To evaluate correlates of distribution after the addition of hundreds of pharmacy distribution sites, an analytic sample was limited to records from 2018, and multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate correlates of collecting naloxone at a pharmacy site.Since program inception to the end of 2018, there were 398,167 naloxone kits shipped to distribution sites, 149,999 kits reported distributed, and 40,903 kits reported used to reverse an overdose in BC. There was a significant increasing trend in the number of naloxone kits used to reverse an overdose over time (p<0.01), and more than 90% of kits that were reported used were distributed to persons at risk of an overdose. Individuals not personally at risk of overdose had higher odds of collecting naloxone at a pharmacy site, compared to other community sites (including harm reduction supply distribution sites, peer led organizations, drop-in centers, and supportive housing sites) (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR): 2.69; 95% CI: 2.50-2.90).This study documents thousands of opioid overdose reversals facilitated through the BC THN program. While those at highest risk of overdose may preferentially access naloxone through community sites, naloxone distribution through pharmacies has allowed the BC THN program to expand dramatically, increasing naloxone availability through longer opening hours on evenings and weekends. and in rural and remote regions. A diversity of naloxone distribution sites and strategies is crucial to prevent rising opioid overdose deaths."
https://openalex.org/W3086247180,"Objective The economic burden of commercially insured patients in the United States with treatment-resistant depression and patients with non–treatment-resistant major depressive disorder was compared using data from the Optum Clinformatics™ claims database. Methods Patients 18–63 years on antidepressant treatment between 1/1/13 and 9/30/13, who had no treatment claims for depression 6 months before the index date (first antidepressant dispensing), and who had a major depressive disorder or depression diagnosis within 30 days of the index date, were included. Treatment-resistant depression was defined as receiving 3 antidepressant regimens during 1 major depressive disorder episode. Patients with treatment-resistant depression were matched with patients with non–treatment-resistant major depressive disorder at a 1:4 ratio using propensity score matching. The study consisted of 1-year baseline (pre-index) and 2-year follow-up (post index) periods. Cost outcomes were compared using a generalized linear model. Results 2,370 treatment-resistant depression and 9,289 non–treatment-resistant major depressive disorder patients were included. In year 1 of the follow-up period, compared with non–treatment-resistant major depressive disorder, patients with treatment-resistant depression had: more emergency department visits (odds ratio = 1.39, 95% confidence interval = 1.24–1.56); more inpatient hospitalizations (odds ratio = 1.73, 95% confidence interval = 1.46–2.05); longer hospital stays (mean difference vs non–treatment-resistant major depressive disorder = 2.86, 95% confidence interval = 0.86–4.86 days); and more total healthcare costs (mean difference vs non–treatment-resistant major depressive disorder = US$3,846, 95% confidence interval = $2,855-$4,928). These patterns remained consistent in year 2 of the follow-up period. Conclusion Treatment-resistant depression was associated with higher healthcare resource utilization and costs versus non–treatment-resistant major depressive disorder in this commercially insured cohort of patients in the United States."
https://openalex.org/W3086913606,"Digital technologies are increasingly intertwined into people’s sexual lives, with growing scholarly interest in the intersection of sex and technology (sex–tech). However, much of the literature is limited by its over emphasis on negative outcomes and the predominance of work by and about North Americans, creating the impression that sex–tech is largely a Western phenomenon. Based on responses from 130,885 women in 191 countries, we assessed how women around the world interact with mobile technology for sex-related purposes, and whether in areas of greater gender inequality, technological accessibility may be empowering women with knowledge about sexuality. We investigated women’s use of technology to find sexual partners, learn about sex and improve their sexual relationships, and track their own sexual health. About one-fifth reported using mobile apps to find sexual partners. This use varied by region: about one-third in Oceania, one-fourth in Europe and the Americas, and one-fifth in Asia and Africa. Staying connected when apart was the most commonly selected reason for app use with a sexual partner. About one-third had used an app to track their own sexual activity. Very few reported that the app they used to improve their sexual relationships was detrimental (0.2%) or not useful (0.6%). Women in countries with greater gender inequality were less likely to have used mobile apps to find a sexual partner, but nearly four times more likely to have engaged in sending and receiving sexts. To our knowledge, this study provides the most comprehensive global data on sex–tech use thus far, demonstrates significant regional variations in sex-tech use, and is the first to examine women’s engagement in sex-related mobile technology in locations with greater gender disparities. These findings may inform large-scale targeted studies, interventions, and sex education to improve the lives of women around the world."
https://openalex.org/W3084780298,"Background There is a need for outcome measures with improved responsiveness to changes in pre-dementia populations. Both cognitive and motor function play important roles in neurodegeneration; motor function decline is detectable at early stages of cognitive decline. This proof of principle study used a Pooled Index approach to evaluate improved responsiveness of the predominant outcome measure (ADAS-Cog: Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale) when assessment of motor function is added. Methods Candidate Pooled Index variables were selected based on theoretical importance and pairwise correlation coefficients. Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests assessed baseline discrimination. Standardized response means assessed responsiveness to longitudinal change. Results Final selected variables for the Pooled Index include gait velocity, dual-task cost of gait velocity, and an ADAS-Cog-Proxy (statistical approximation of the ADAS-Cog using similar cognitive tests). The Pooled Index and ADAS-Cog-Proxy scores had similar ability to discriminate between pre-dementia syndromes. The Pooled Index demonstrated trends of similar or greater responsiveness to longitudinal decline than ADAS-Cog-Proxy scores. Conclusion Adding motor function assessments to the ADAS-Cog may improve responsiveness in pre-dementia populations."
https://openalex.org/W3086402607,"Many authors have tried to explain the shape of the species abundance distribution (SAD). Some of them have suggested that sampling spatial scale is an important factor shaping SADs. These suggestions, however, did not consider the indirect and well-known effect of sample size, which increases as samples are combined to generate SADs at larger spatial scales. Here, we separate the effects of sample size and sampling scale on the shape of the SAD for three groups of organisms (trees, beetles and birds) sampled in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We compared the observed SADs at different sampling scales with simulated SADs having the same richness, relative abundances but comparable sample sizes, to show that the main effect shaping SADs is sample size and not sampling spatial scale. The effect of scale was minor and deviations between observed and simulated SADs were present only for beetles. For trees, the match between observed and simulated SADs was improved at all spatial scales when we accounted for conspecific aggregation, which was even more important than the sampling scale effect. We build on these results to propose a conceptual framework where observed SADs are shaped by three main factors, in decreasing order of importance: sample size, conspecific aggregation and beta diversity. Therefore, studies comparing SADs across sites or scales should use sampling and/or statistical approaches capable of disentangling these three effects on the shape of SADs."

Two elements are essential to monitor the evolution of the pandemic as well as to analyze the effectiveness of the response measures: reliable data and useful indicators. We present an indicator that helps to assess the impact of Covid-19 on the community’s health, combining two different components: the extent of the pandemics (i.e. the share of the population affected) and its severity (the intensity of the disease on those affected). The severity measure derives from the application of an evaluation protocol that allows comparing population distributions based on the proportions of those affected with different health conditions. We illustrate the functioning of this indicator over a case study regarding the situation of the Italian regions on March 9 (the beginning of the confinement) and April 8, 2020, one month later."
https://openalex.org/W3085538616,"Mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) appear to be a very exciting treatment option for heart disease. Here, we used a swine model of chronic myocardial ischemia to evaluate the efficacy of a less-invasive method of injection of EVs via a peripheral intravenous route.Sixteen Yorkshire swine underwent placement of an ameroid constrictor on the left circumflex (LCx) artery at age 11 weeks to induce chronic myocardial ischemia. Two weeks later, they were divided into two groups: control (CON; n = 8), and intravenous injection of EVs (EVIV; n = 8). At 18 weeks of age, animals underwent final analysis and euthanasia. The chronically ischemic myocardium (LCx territory) was harvested for analysis.Intravenous injection (IV) of EVs induced several pro-angiogenic markers such as MAPK, JNK but not Akt. Whereas IV injections of EVs decreased VEGFR2 expression and inhibited apoptotic signaling (caspase 3), they increased expression of VEGFR1 that is believed to be anti-angiogenic. Injection of EVs did not result in an increase in vessel density and blood flow when compared to the control group.Although IV injection of EVs upregulated several pro-angiogenic signaling pathways, it failed to induce changes in vascular density in the chronically ischemic myocardium. Thus, a lack of increase in vascular density at the doses tested failed to elicit a functional response in ischemic myocardium."
https://openalex.org/W3085136623,"The stem volume of commercial trees is an important variable that assists in decision making and economic analysis in forest management. Wood from forest plantations can be used for several purposes, which makes estimating multi-volumes for the same tree a necessary task. Defining its exploitation and use potential, such as the total and merchantable volumes (up to a minimum diameter of interest), with or without bark, is a possible work. The goal of this study was to use different strategies to model multi-volumes of the stem of eucalyptus trees. The data came from rigorous scaling of 460 felled trees stems from four eucalyptus clones in high forest and coppice regimes. The diameters were measured at different heights, with the volume of the sections obtained by the Smalian method. Data were randomly separated into fit and validation data. The single multi-volume model, volume-specific models, and the training of artificial neural networks (ANNs) were fitted. The evaluation criteria of the models were: coefficient of determination, root mean square error, mean absolute error, mean bias error, as well as graphical analysis of observed and estimated values and distribution of residuals. Additionally, the t-test (α = 0.05) was performed between the volume obtained in the rigorous scaling and estimated by each strategy with the validation data. Results showed that the strategies used to model different tree stem volumes are efficient. The actual and estimated volumes showed no differences. The multi-volume model had the most considerable advantage in volume estimation practicality, while the volume-specific models were more efficient in the accuracy of estimates. Given the conditions of this study, the ANNs are more suitable than the regression models in the estimation of multi-volumes of eucalyptus trees, revealing greater accuracy and practicality."
https://openalex.org/W3086579498,"Background Problematic internet use (PIU) among youth has become a public health concern. Previous studies identified socio-demographic background risk factors for PIU. The effects of online activities on youth PIU behavior are not well investigated. Methods This cross-sectional study assessed the roles of online activities for PIU behavior of undergraduate students in Bahir Dar University, North West Ethiopia. Data were collected from 812 randomly selected regular program students recruited from 10 departments. Respondents completed a pre-tested structured questionnaire. Hierarchical logistic regression models were used for analyses. Results The results indicated that social networking (75.5%), entertainment (73.6%), academic works (70.9%), and online gaming (21.6%) are the important online activities students are engaging in the internet. About 33% and 1.8% of students showed symptoms of mild and severe PIU, respectively. Taking online activities into account improved the model explaining PIU behavior of students. Online activities explained 46% of the variance in PIU. Using the internet for social networking (AOR = 7.078; 95% CI: 3.913–12.804) and online gaming (AOR = 2.175; 95% CI: 1.419–3.335) were risk factors for PIU. Conclusions The findings revealed that more than a third of the respondents showed symptoms of PIU. Online activities improved the model explaining PIU behavior of students. Thus, university authorities need to be aware of the prevalence of PIU and introduce regulatory mechanisms to limit the usage of potentially addictive online activities and promoting responsible use of the internet."
https://openalex.org/W3084737000,"Hearing impairment was observed in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Our purpose was to investigate the relationship between sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and associated comorbidities in the CKD population. We conducted a retrospective, population-based study to examine the risk of developing SNHL in patients with CKD. Population-based data from 2000–2010 from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database of the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database was used in this study. The population sample comprised 185,430 patients who were diagnosed with CKD, and 556,290 without CKD to determine SNHL risk factors. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis demonstrated the CKD group had a significantly increased risk of SNHL compared with the non-CKD group [adjusted hazard ratio (HR), 3.42; 95% confidence interval (CI), 3.01–3.90, p < 0.001]. In the CKD group, the risk of SNHL (adjusted HR, 5.92) was higher among patients undergoing hemodialysis than among those not undergoing hemodialysis (adjusted HR, 1.40). Furthermore, subgroup analysis revealed an increased risk of SNHL in patients with CKD and comorbidities, including heart failure (adjusted HR, 7.48), liver cirrhosis (adjusted HR, 4.12), type 2 diabetes mellitus (adjusted HR, 3.98), hypertension (adjusted HR, 3.67), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (adjusted HR, 3.45). CKD is an independent risk of developing SNHL. Additionally, hemodialysis for uremia can increase the risk of SNHL. Cardiovascular, lung, liver, and metabolic comorbidities in CKD patients may further aggravate the risk of SNHL by inter-organ crosstalk. We should pay attention to SNHL in this high-risk population."
https://openalex.org/W3084969600,"Positional information on the shoulder girdle (the clavicle and scapula) is important for a better understanding of the function of the upper limb in the locomotive system as well as its associated disease pathogenesis. However, such data are limited except for information on the axial position of the scapula. Here, we describe a three-dimensional reconstruction of the shoulder girdle including the clavicle and scapula, and its relationship to different landmarks in the body. Thirty-six human fetal specimens (crown-rump length range: 7.6-225 mm) from the Kyoto Collection were used for this study. The morphogenesis and three-dimensional position of the shoulder girdle were analyzed with phase-contrast X-ray computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. We first detected the scapula body along with the coracoid and humeral head at Carnegie stage 18; however, the connection between the body and coracoid was not confirmed at this stage. During development, all landmarks on the shoulder girdle remained at the same axial position except for the inferior angle, which implies that the scapula enlarged in the caudal direction and reached the adult axial position in the fetal period. The scapula body was rotated internally and in the upward direction at the initiation of morphogenesis, but in the fetal period the scapula body was different than that in the adult position. The shoulder girdle was located at the ventral side of the vertebrae at the time of initial morphogenesis, but changed its position to the lateral side of the vertebrae in the late embryonic and fetal periods. Such a unique position of the shoulder girdle may contribute to the stage-specific posture of the upper limb. Adequate internal and upward rotation of the scapula could help in reducing the shoulder width, thereby facilitating childbirth. The data presented in this study can be used as normal morphometric references for shoulder girdle evaluations in the embryonic and fetal periods."

A total of 3 PacBio Iso-Seq libraries (1–2 kb, 2–3 kb and 3–6 kb) and 21 Illumina transcriptome libraries were constructed, a total of 13.41 Gb of clean reads were generated, which included 215,636 reads of insert (ROIs) and 121,654 FL, non-chimaric (FLNC) reads. Transcript clustering analysis of the FLNC reads revealed 76,586 consensus isoforms, and a total of 12,520 high-quality transcript sequences corrected with non-FL sequences were used for subsequent analysis. After the redundant reads were removed, 38,435 transcripts were obtained. A total of 27,905 coding DNA sequences (CDSs) were identified, and 407 long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) were ultimately predicted. Additionally, 24,832 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were identified, and a total of 1,295 alternative splicing (AS) events were predicted. Furthermore, 37,993 transcripts were annotated in eight functional databases. This is the first study to perform SMRT sequencing of the FL transcriptome of loquat.

https://openalex.org/W3085519130,"The fatigue of truck, bus, and taxi drivers has been a causal trigger for road accidents. However, the relationship between collision risk and the extent of objective fatigue has yet to be confirmed. In this study, we aimed to identify the relationship between autonomic nerve function as an objective parameter of fatigue and the extent of rear-end collision risk, which includes not only objectively risky events but also situations in which truck drivers require safety guidance from safety transport managers. Data of 33 truck driver participants (2 females, 31 males, 46.0 ± 9.1 years old, min-max: 24-65 years old) were analyzed. Drive recorder and automotive sensor data were collected over an eight-month period, and the autonomic nerve function during resting state in drivers was evaluated daily, pre- and post-shift, using pulse waves and electrocardiographic waveform measurement. The rear-end collision risk Index was developed using decision tree analysis of the audiovisual drive recorder data and distance data from the front automotive sensors. The rear-end collision risk index of shift-day was positively correlated with the sympathetic nerve activity index of post-shift condition on the previous day. This suggests that fatigue-related sympathetic nerve overactivity of post-shift condition increases the rear-end collision risk in the following day. Measures, such as actively seeking rest and undertaking fatigue recovery according to the degree of sympathetic nerve activity of post-shift condition, are necessary in order to prevent truck drivers' rear-end collisions."
https://openalex.org/W3085996248,"Multiple works have studied possible associations between human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles and end stage renal disease (ESRD) showing, however, contradictory and inconsistent results. Here, we revisit the association between ESRD and HLA antigens, comparing HLA polymorphism (at HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, -DQB1 and DQA1 loci) in ESRD patients (n = 497) and controls (n = 672). Our data identified several HLA alleles that displayed a significant positive or negative association with ESRD. We also determined whether heterozygosity or homozygosity of the ESRD-associated HLA alleles at different loci could modify the prevalence of the disease. Few HLA allele combinations displayed significant associations with ESRD, among which A*3_26 combination showed the highest strength of association (OR = 4.488, P≤ 0.05) with ESRD. Interestingly, the age of ESRD onset was not affected by HLA allele combinations at different loci. We also performed an extensive literature analysis to determine whether the association of HLA to ESRD can be similar across different ethnic groups. Our analysis showed that at least certain HLA alleles, HLA-A*11, HLA-DRB1*11, and HLA-DRB1*4, display a significant association with ESRD in different ethnic groups. The findings of our study will help in determining possible protective or susceptible roles of various HLA alleles in ESRD."
https://openalex.org/W3086058896,"In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm for point cloud registration in presence of low overlap rate and high noise. The proposed registration method mainly includes four parts: the loop voxel filtering, the curvature-based key point selection, the robust geometric descriptor, and the determining and optimization of correspondences based on key point spatial relationship. The loop voxel filtering filters point clouds to a specified resolution. We propose a key point selection algorithm which has a better anti-noise and fast ability. The feature descriptor of key points is highly exclusive which is based on the geometric relationship between the neighborhood points and the center of gravity of the neighborhood. The correspondences in the pair of two point clouds are determined according to the combined features of key points. Finally, the singular value decomposition and ICP algorithm are applied to align two point clouds. The proposed registration method can accurately and quickly register point clouds of different resolutions in noisy situations. We validate our proposal by presenting a quantitative experimental comparison with state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results show that the proposed point cloud registration algorithm has faster calculation speed, higher registration accuracy, and better anti-noise performance."
https://openalex.org/W3086660485,"Endophytic fungi produce many novel bioactive metabolites that are directly used as drugs or that function as the precursor structures of other chemicals. The metabolic shaping of endophytes on grape cells was reported previously. However, there are no reports on the interactions and metabolic impact of endophyte symbiosis on in vitro vine leaves, which may be examined under well-controlled conditions that are more representative of the natural situation of endophytes within grapevines. The present study used an in vitro leaf method to establish endophyte symbiosis of grapevines and analyze the effects on the metabolic profiles of grape leaves from two different cultivars, 'Rose honey' (RH) and 'Cabernet sauvignon' (CS). The effects of endophytic fungi on the metabolic profiles of grape leaves exhibited host selectivity and fungal strain specificity. Most of the endophytic fungal strains introduced novel metabolites into the two varieties of grape leaves according to the contents of the detected metabolites and composition of metabolites. Strains RH49 and MDR36, with high or moderate symbiosis rates, triggered an increased response in terms of the detected metabolites, and the strains MDR1 and MDR33 suppressed the detected metabolites in CS and RH leaves despite having strong or moderate symbiosis ability. However, the strain RH12 significantly induced the production of novel metabolites in RH leaves due to its high symbiosis ability and suppression of metabolites in CS leaves."

They can spread rapidly and are associated with poor patient outcome. However, there is scarcity of information on ear infection with ESBL producing bacteria in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study investigates the prevalence of ear infection with ESBL producing bacteria among outpatients attending Felegehiwot Referral Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia.A hospital based cross-sectional study was conducted from May, 2018 to January, 2019. Demographic and clinical data were collected with face to face interview and were complemented with patient card review. Ear discharge specimens were collected from study participants using swab technique. All ear swab specimens were cultured using standard microbiological techniques. The ESBL producing bacteria were detected by double disc synergy test and interpreted based on Clinical and laboratory Standards Institute Guidelines. Chi-square and fisher's exact tests were calculated to check association between variables.A total of 236 patients (male = 138 and female = 98) with ear infection took part in the study. The median age of the participants was 20years. Overall, 10 (4.23%, 95%CI; 2.3-7.6%) of patients had ear infection with ESBL producing bacteria. Other chronic illnesses (p = 0.003), history of hospital visit and treatment (p = 0.006) and history of antibiotic use without physician's prescription (p<0.001) had significant association with prevalence of ESBL producing bacteria in ear infection. The proportion of ear infection with ESBL producing P.mirabilis, P.aeruginosa and K.pneumoniae were 4 (1.7%), 3 (1.3%) and 2 (0.8%), respectively. All ESBL producing isolates were MDR (100%). Overall, 58 (43%) species were MDR. P.aeruginosa was the leading MDR isolate 29 (53.7%).For all bacterial isolates of ear infection, ampicillin(93.3%) and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (58.5%) revealed high level of resistance whereas low resistance rates were observed for ciprofloxacin (5.2%), third generation cephalosporin (11.9-20%) and aztreonam (16.3%).Ear infection due to ESBL producing bacteria coupled with high levels of MDR is becoming a growing concern for outpatients in the study area. Regular detection of these bacteria and wise use of antibiotics are needed to stop the spread of this form of resistance."
https://openalex.org/W3085714012,"Apela, a novel endogenous peptide ligand for the G-protein-coupled apelin receptor, was first discovered and identified in human embryonic stem cells in 2013. Apela has showed some biological functions in promoting angiogenesis and inducing vasodilatation of mammals by binding apelin receptor, but little is known about its expression characteristics and regulatory mechanism in chicken. In the present study, the coding sequences of Apela in chicken was cloned. The evolution history and potential function of Apela were analyzed. Subsequently, the spatiotemporal expression characteristics of chicken Apela were investigated. Furthermore, the regulatory mechanism of Apela mRNA responsing to estrogen was explored by in vitro and in vivo experiments. The results showed that the length of the CDs of Apela mRNA was 165 bp and encoded a protein consisting of 54 amino acids residues with a transmembrane domain in chicken. The Apela was derived from the same ancestor of Apelin, and abundantly expressed in liver, kidney and pancreas tissues. The expression levels of Apela in the liver of hens were significantly higher at the peak-laying stage than that at the pre-laying stage (p ≤ 0.05). The Apela mRNA levels were significantly up-regulated in primary hepatocytes treated with 17β-estradiol (p ≤ 0.05), and could be effectively inhibited by estrogen receptor antagonists MPP, ICI 182780 and tamoxifen. It indicated that chicken Apela expression was regulated by estrogen via estrogen receptor α (ERα). In individual levels, both the contents of TG, TC and VLDL-c in serum, and the expression of ApoVLDLII and Apela in liver markedly up-regulated by 17β-estradiol induction at 1mg/kg and 2mg/kg concentrations (p ≤ 0.05).

https://openalex.org/W3086397924,"Quantitative analyses of soil and sediment samples are often used to complement stratigraphic interpretations in archaeological and geoscientific research. The outcome of such analyses often is confined to small parts of the examined profiles as only a limited number of samples can be extracted and processed. Recent laboratory studies show that such selectively measured soil and sediment characteristics can be spatially extrapolated using spectral image data, resulting in reliable maps of a variety of parameters. However, on-site usage of this method has not been examined. We therefore explore, whether image data (RGB data and visible and near infrared hyperspectral data), acquired under regular fieldwork conditions during an archaeological excavation, in combination with a sampling strategy that is close to common practice, can be used to produce maps of soil organic matter, hematite, calcite, several weathering indices and grain size characteristics throughout complex archaeological profiles. We examine two profiles from an archaeological trench in Yeha (Tigray, Ethiopia). Our findings show a promising performance of RGB data and its derivative CIELAB as well as hyperspectral data for the prediction of parameters via random forest regression. By including two individual profiles we are able to assess the accuracy and reproducibility of our results, and illustrate the advantages and drawbacks of a higher spectral resolution and the necessary additional effort during fieldwork. The produced maps of the parameters examined allow us to critically reflect on the stratigraphic interpretation and offer a more objective basis for layer delineation in general. Our study therefore promotes more transparent and reproducible documentation for often destructive archaeological fieldwork."

Several studies have documented biases that may be related to nonverbal communicative intentions. For instance, in selfies posted on the dating platform Tinder males but not females prefer camera views from below (Sedgewick, Flath & Elias, 2017). We re-examined this study to assess whether this bias is confined to dating selection contexts and to compare variability between individuals and between genders.Three raters evaluated vertical camera position in 2000 selfies- 1000 by males and 1000 by females-posted in Instagram.We found that the choices of camera angle do seem to vary depending on the context under which the selfies were uploaded. On Tinder, females appear more likely to choose neutral, frontal presentations than they do on Instagram, whereas males on Tinder appear more likely to opt for camera angles from below than on Instagram.This result confirms that the composition of selfies is constrained by factors affecting nonverbal communicative intentions."
https://openalex.org/W3080397160,"Objectives To evaluate parent and teacher opinion of the provision of in-school eyecare and jargon-free written reporting of visual status for children in special educational settings. Participants and methods A nationally-agreed, in-school eyecare framework for children attending special schools which recommends a full eye examination, dispensing of spectacles and provision of a jargon-free written report of visual outcomes to parents and teachers, was provided to 200 children (mean age 10 years, 9 months; 70% male) attending a special school in the UK. The written ‘Vision Report’ detailed, in lay-language, results from the eye examination and provided practical advice to alleviate the impact of vision difficulties both at home and in the classroom. Following implementation of the framework, parents and teachers completed a feedback questionnaire to determine their opinion of the in-school eye examination and utility of the Vision Report. Results Parents of 123 participants returned a feedback questionnaire. Eighty-eight participants were represented by the 23 teachers who returned a questionnaire. The in-school eyecare was rated positively for children in special education by 82.4% of parents and 80.9% of teachers. Key benefits included the familiarity of the in-school setting (81.3% of parents and 100% of teachers agree), the convenience of the setting for parents (74.0% of parents and 100% of teachers agree), and the opportunity for teachers to speak directly to eyecare providers regarding a child’s visual needs (82.6% of teachers agree). The information provided by the Vision Report was deemed useful day-to-day by 78.3% of parents and 100% of teachers. The majority (80%) of teachers implemented classroom modifications suggested in the report, whereas only 47.9% of parents reported implementation of modifications at home. Conclusions Provision of in-school eyecare is valued by parents and teachers of children in special education settings. Jargon-free, written reports of visual status are valued and utilised by parents and teachers. Further support is required to aid parents in implementing vision modifications at home."

From January 2010 to June 2018, 1254 adult patients with preoperative myocardial injury underwent non-cardiac surgery under general anesthesia and were enrolled in this study. Patients were stratified into following two groups according to anesthetic agents; 115 (9.2%) patients whose anesthesia was induced and maintained with continuous infusion of propofol and remifentanil (TIVA group) and 1139 (90.8%) patients whose anesthesia was maintainted with volatile anesthetics (VOLATILE group). The primary outcome was 30-day mortality. To diminish the remifentanil effect, a further analysis was conducted after excluding the patients who received only volatile anesthetics without remifentanil infusion. In a propensity-score matched analysis, 30-day mortality was higher in the TIVA group than the VOLATILE group (17.0% vs. 9.1%; hazard ratio [HR] 2.60; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.14-5.93; p = 0.02). In addition, the TIVA group showed higher 30-day mortality than the VOLATILE group, even after eliminating the effect of remifentanil infusion (15.8% vs. 8.3%; HR 4.62; 95% CI, 1.82-11.74; p = 0.001). In our study, the use of volatile anesthetics showed the significant survival improvement after non-cardiac surgery in patients with preoperative myocardial injury, which appears to be irrelevant to the remifentanil use. Further studies are needed to confirm this beneficial effect of volatile anesthetics. Clinical trial number and registry URL: KCT0004349 (www.cris.nih.go.kr)."

However, antiretroviral options for HIV/HBV co-infected children are limited and, at the time of this study, only included lamivudine. These children may remain on this regimen for many years until late adolescence. They are at high risk of developing HBV drug resistance and uncontrolled HBV disease. The aim of this study was to characterize HBV infection in HIV/HBV co-infected children. Known HIV-infected/HBsAg-positive children, previously exposed to lamivudine monotherapy against HBV, and their mothers were recruited at the Katutura Hospital paediatric HIV clinic in Windhoek, Namibia. Dried blood spot and serum samples were collected for HBV characterization and serological testing, respectively. Fifteen children and six mothers participated in the study. Eight of the 15 children (53.3%) tested HBV DNA positive; all eight children were on lamivudine-based ART. Lamivudine-associated resistance variants, together with immune escape mutants in the surface gene, were identified in all eight children. Resistance mutations included rtL80I, rtV173L, rtL180M, rtM204I/V and the overlapping sE164D, sW182*, sI195M and sW196LS variants. HBV strains belonged to genotypes E (6/8, 75%) and D3 (2/8, 25%). Further analysis of the HBV core promoter region revealed mutations associated with reduced expression of HBeAg protein and hepatocarcinogenesis. All six mothers, on HBV-active ART containing tenofovir and lamivudine, tested HBV DNA negative. This study confirms the importance of screening HIV-infected children for HBV and ensuring equity of drug access to effective HBV treatment if co-infected."

Prior studies suggest that metabolic syndrome may be one risk factor for GVHD. We hypothesized that hepatic steatosis on pre-HCT computed tomography (CT) scans may be a marker for development of GVHD and poor outcomes in allo-HCT. In this retrospective study, we reviewed the pre-HCT CT scans and transplant outcome data of patients who underwent allo-HCT at Duke University Medical Center from 2009 to 2017. The presence of steatosis was confirmed using CT attenuation measurements. We then assessed the association between pre-HCT hepatic steatosis and HCT-related outcomes including GVHD. 80 patients who had pre-HCT CT scans were included in the study. Pre-transplant hepatic steatosis was associated with the development of chronic GVHD (OR 4.2, p = 0.02), but was not associated with acute GVHD (OR 1.3, p = 0.7), non-relapse mortality (p = 0.81) or overall survival (p = 0.74). Based on this single center retrospective study, pre-transplant hepatic steatosis is associated with development of chronic GVHD. Further, prospective study with other imaging modalities including non-contrasted CT scans is needed to determine if this association is reproducible."

Major adverse cardiac and cardiovascular event (MACCE) was the primary endpoint, including death, stroke, revascularization, and non-fatal myocardial infarction. We assessed the performance of our model using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and assigned a simplified point-scoring system. One-hundred-thirty-eight (10.8%) patients experienced MACCE in the derivation cohort with hemodialysis (HD: odds ratio [OR] = 2.55), left ventricular ejection fractions (LVEF) <35% (OR = 2.23), in-stent occlusions (ISO: OR = 2.27), and diabetes mellitus (DM: OR = 1.72). The AUC of the derivation model was 0.650. The model’s performance was similar in the validation cohort (AUC, 0.610). When assigned a point for each associated factor (HD = 3, LVEF <35%, ISO = 2, and DM = 1 point), the average predicted versus the observed MACCE probability using the Japan-CTO extension score for the low, moderate, high, and very high risk groups was 8.1% vs. 7.3%, 16.9% vs. 15.9%, 22.0% vs. 26.1%, and 56.2% vs. 44.4%, respectively. This novel risk model may allow for the estimation of long-term risk and be useful in disseminating appropriate revascularization procedures."
https://openalex.org/W3084813009,"Previous research has indicated that many European buildings are vulnerable to moderate-magnitude earthquakes. For example, during the L´Aquila (Italia, Mw 6.3, 2009) and Lorca (Spain, Mw 5.9, 2011) earthquakes, many old buildings were severely damaged and some of them collapsed. In specific, significant damage has been found in several school buildings after past earthquakes in Europe. This is due to the fact that many of them were constructed prior to the current seismic codes, thus considering only gravitational loads and with no seismic design whatsoever. Primary schools are even more vulnerable than other typologies because of their low adult/child ratio. The seismic activity of the Iberian Peninsula is low-moderate. However, the Algarve and Huelva regions, which are situated in the south-west, are influenced by large faults which have caused major earthquakes of long-return periods. The European project PERSISTAH (Projetos de Escolas Resilientes aos SISmos no Território do Algarve e de Huelva, in Portuguese) aims to cooperatively evaluate the seismic vulnerability of primary schools in the Algarve (Portugal) and Huelva (Spain) regions. The present work is framed under this project. The objective of this paper is to determine the most effective retrofitting scheme for a typical primary school building in this area, considering structural, architectural and constructive parameters. The scheme could be applied to several buildings of the same typology, decreasing costs and time. An existing reinforced concrete frame building has been selected for the study. This is one of the most commonly used typologies for primary schools in this area. A nonlinear static analysis has been carried out in order to study its seismic behaviour. The performance point of the building has been obtained through the capacity-demand spectrum method. The preliminary results have confirmed the poor seismic behaviour of this building. Specifically, soft-story behaviour has been identified in the ground floor and short columns have been observed in the upper floors. Therefore, specific seismic retrofitting solutions have been proposed and evaluated in order to identify the one that is the most efficient. The combination of reinforcements has been done considering the structural and architectural impact and constructive parameters. The calculations have shown that steel X-bracings are the best solution for preventing the formation of a soft-storey in the ground floor. Unfortunately, this scheme increases the deformation in the upper floor columns. The best solution for the upper floors' short columns has been the use of steel jackets. The results have also shown that this combination produces an important reduction of the expected general damage level. The resulting retrofitting scheme can be extrapolated to other buildings with a similar typology."
https://openalex.org/W3084987080,"Previous studies reported that sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L., Elaeagnaceae, HRP) exhibits hepatoprotective effects via its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties as well as its inhibitory effects on collagen synthesis. However, it is unclear whether this hepatoprotective effect is also achieved by regulating liver drug metabolism enzyme pathways. Herein, we examined the regulatory effect of HRP on cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) in rats with immune liver injury, and explored the molecular mechanism of its hepatoprotective effect. Rat models of immunological liver injury were induced by intravenous injections of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG; 125 mg kg-1; 2 wks). Specific protein levels were detected by ELISA or western blot, and CYP3A mRNA expression was detected by RT-PCR. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) detected relative changes in CYP3A metabolic activity based on the rates of 1-hydroxylation of the probe drug midazolam (MDZ). BCG pretreatment (125 mg kg-1) significantly down-regulated liver CYP3A protein expression compared with the control, metabolic activity, and transcription levels while up-regulating liver NF-κB, IL-1β, TNF-α and iNOS. HRP intervention (ED50: 78 mg kg-1) moderately reversed NF-κB, inflammatory cytokines, and iNOS activation in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.05), and suppressed CYP3A down-regulation (P < 0.05); thereby partially alleviating liver injury. During immune liver injury, HRP may reverse CYP3A down-regulation by inhibiting NF-κB signal transduction, and protect liver function, which involves regulation of enzymes transcriptionally, translationally and post-translationally. The discovery that NF-κB is a molecular target of HRP may initiate the development and optimization of a clinical therapeutic approach to mitigate hepatitis B and other immunity-related liver diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3084992875,"In community-based medical education, opportunities for medical students to interact with local residents are important. To facilitate such interaction, we aimed to evaluate acceptance of a homestay program and attitude toward community medicine among medical students.The participants (n = 39) were allowed to stay in the local homes of residents for one night in August 2016, 2017, and 2018. Before and after the homestays, the students responded to a self-reported questionnaire using the visual analog scale (VAS; 0-100 mm). The questionnaire included four questions on homestay/community medical training and community medicine and four questions about attitude toward community medicine in the local areas of medical students. Then, we compared the VAS scores before and after training.The VAS scores for all questions about homestay/community medical training and community medicine significantly increased: ""Is it worthwhile for you to have experience in the field of community medicine,"" ""Did you find the homestay enjoyable,"" ""Does the homestay add educational significance to the program,"" and ""Is direct interaction with residents meaningful?"" For the two questions about attitude toward community medicine, the VAS scores significantly increased: ""Is there a challenge to practicing community medicine"" and ""In the future, do you want to work in Tamba area where you stayed?""The medical students were extremely enthusiastic about the educational program for community medicine involving residential homestays, which improved their attitudes toward practicing community medicine. Moreover, the students appreciated that their training sites could become their future workplaces."

The International Society of Wheelchair Professionals developed a Minimum Uniform Dataset (MUD) for wheelchair services worldwide with the intent to gather data that is comparable globally. The MUD was developed with the participation of members from around the globe and its feasibility piloted at 3 sites. Three versions of the MUD are now available-a short form with 29 data points (available in English, Spanish, and French) and a standard version with 38 data points in English. Future work is to validate and complete the translation cycles followed by promoting the use of the MUD globally so that the data can be leveraged to inform policy, practice and direct investments."
https://openalex.org/W3086816504,"Globally, every year greater than twenty million newborns are born weighing less than 2500grams, of which over 96% of them were in developing countries. It contributes to sixty to eighty percent of all neonatal deaths, annually. These infants weighing less than 2500gram will have a poor immune system and are at risk of morbidity and mortality. This study was aimed to investigate the survival status and predictors of mortality among neonates admitted with low birth weight at public hospitals in Ethiopia.A prospective cohort study was conducted among selected 216 newborns admitted with low birth weight who were admitted in neonatal intensive care unit at Arba Minch General hospital, Sawla General Hospital and Chencha district hospital from 1st March 2018 to 28st February 2019. Data were entered into Epi data version 3.02 and exported to STATA V 14 for analysis. The Kaplan Meier survival curve together with log rank test was used to estimate the survival time of the newborns. Variables which had p-value <0.05 in multivariable analysis using the cox proportional hazard model were declared as statistically significant.The cumulative proportion of surviving at the end of third days was 99.01% (95%CI: 96.11, 99.75). Similarly it was 97.81% (95%CI: 94.25, 99.18), 96.27% (95%CI: 91.76, 98.33) and 94.33% (95%CI: 88.72, 97.19) at the end of fourth, fifth and sixth day respectively. The overall mean survival time was 17.13 days (95%CI: 12.76, 21.49). The incidence of mortality among neonates admitted with low birth weight was 83 per 1000 live births. Mothers with DM (AHR:4.79; 95%CI:1.15, 19.8), maternal HIV infection(AHR:6.47;95%CI:1.43,29.3), not keeping the newborn under KMC(AHR:13.0;95%CI:3.42, 49.5) and initiating exclusive breast feeding within one hour(AHR:0.19;95%CI:0.04, 0.95) were statistically significant in multivariable cox regression analysis.The risk of mortality among neonates admitted with low birth weight was high at the early admission period and the incidence of mortality was high. Maternal history of diabetes mellitus, HIV/AIDS infection, keeping the newborn under kangaroo mother care and exclusive breast feeding initiation were statistically significant predictors of mortality. Special emphasis should be given for neonates with low birth weight at the early follow up periods and Kangaroo mother care practice should be a usual practice."
https://openalex.org/W3085796790,"Pertussis, a severe respiratory infection caused by Bordetella pertussis, is distributed globally. Vaccination has been crucial to annual reductions in the number of cases. However, disease reemergence has occurred over the last decade in several countries, including Brazil. Here we describe the clinical and epidemiological aspects of suspected pertussis cases in Salvador, Brazil, and evaluate factors associated with case confirmation. This descriptive and retrospective study was conducted in the five hospitals in Salvador that reported the highest number of pertussis cases between 2011-2016. Demographic and clinical data were recorded for each patient. Bivariate analysis was performed to evaluate differences between groups (confirmed vs. unconfirmed cases) using Pearson's Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. Results: Of 529 suspected pertussis cases, 29.7% (157/529) were confirmed by clinical, clinical-epidemiological or laboratory criteria, with clinical criteria most frequently applied (63.7%; 100/157). Unvaccinated individuals (43.3%; 68/157) were the most affected, followed by age groups 2-3 months (37.6%; 59/157) and <2 months (31.2%; 49/157). Overall, ≤50% of the confirmed cases presented a complete vaccination schedule. All investigated cases presented cough in association with one or more symptoms, especially paroxysmal cough (66.9%; 105/529) (p = 0.001) or cyanosis (66.2%; 104/529) (p<0.001). Our results indicate that pertussis occurred mainly in infants and unvaccinated individuals in Salvador, Brazil. The predominance of clinical criteria used to confirm suspected cases highlights the need for improvement in the laboratory tools used to perform rapid diagnosis. Fluctuations in infection prevalence demonstrate the importance of vaccination strategies in improving the control and prevention of pertussis."
https://openalex.org/W3086838972,"The paper explores the travelling behaviour of migrant groups using Facebook audience estimates. Reduced geographical mobility is associated with increased risk of social exclusion and reduced socio-economic and psychological well-being. Facebook audience estimates are timely, openly available and cover most of the countries in the world. Facebook classifies its users based on multiple attributes such as the country of their previous residence, and whether they are frequent travellers. Using these data, we modelled the travelling behaviour of Facebook users grouped by countries of previous and current residence, gender and age. We found strong indications that the frequency of travelling is lower for Facebook users migrating from low-income countries and for women migrating from or living in countries with high gender inequality. Such mobility inequalities impede the smooth integration of migrants from low-income countries to new destinations and their well-being. Moreover, the reduced mobility of women who have lived or currently live in countries with conservative gender norms capture another aspect of the integration which is referring to socio-cultural norms and gender inequality. However, to provide more solid evidence on whether our findings are also valid for the general population, collaboration with Facebook is required to better understand how the data is being produced and pre-processed."
