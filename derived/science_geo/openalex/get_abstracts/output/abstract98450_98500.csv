https://openalex.org/W2072787342,"The phosphorylation of the human estrogen receptor (ER) serine residue at position 118 is required for full activity of the ER activation function 1 (AF-1). This Ser118 is phosphorylated by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in vitro and in cells treated with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) in vivo. Overexpression of MAPK kinase (MAPKK) or of the guanine nucleotide binding protein Ras, both of which activate MAPK, enhanced estrogen-induced and antiestrogen (tamoxifen)-induced transcriptional activity of wild-type ER, but not that of a mutant ER with an alanine in place of Ser118. Thus, the activity of the amino-terminal AF-1 of the ER is modulated by the phosphorylation of Ser118 through the Ras-MAPK cascade of the growth factor signaling pathways."

https://openalex.org/W2039317622,"Angiogenesis depends on cytokines and vascular cell adhesion events. Two cytokine-dependent pathways of angiogenesis were shown to exist and were defined by their dependency on distinct vascular cell integrins. In vivo angiogenesis in corneal or chorioallantoic membrane models induced by basic fibroblast growth factor or by tumor necrosis factor-alpha depended on alpha v beta 3, whereas angiogenesis initiated by vascular endothelial growth factor, transforming growth factor-alpha, or phorbol ester depended on alpha v beta 5. Antibody to each integrin selectively blocked one of these pathways, and a cyclic peptide antagonist of both integrins blocked angiogenesis stimulated by each cytokine tested. These pathways are further distinguished by their sensitivity to calphostin C, an inhibitor of protein kinase C that blocked angiogenesis potentiated by alpha v beta 5 but not by alpha v beta 3."

The defect appears to result from impaired adhesion of the apposing medial edge epithelia of the palatal shelves and subsequent elimination of the mid-line epithelial seam. No craniofacial abnormalities were observed. This result demonstrates that TGF-beta 3 affects palatal shelf fusion by an intrinsic, primary mechanism rather than by effects secondary to craniofacial defects."
https://openalex.org/W2000064612,"The structure of the ternary complex consisting of yeast phenylalanyl-transfer RNA (Phe-tRNAPhe), Thermus aquaticus elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu), and the guanosine triphosphate (GTP) analog GDPNP was determined by x-ray crystallography at 2.7 angstrom resolution. The ternary complex participates in placing the amino acids in their correct order when messenger RNA is translated into a protein sequence on the ribosome. The EF-Tu-GDPNP component binds to one side of the acceptor helix of Phe-tRNAPhe involving all three domains of EF-Tu. Binding sites for the phenylalanylated CCA end and the phosphorylated 5' end are located at domain interfaces, whereas the T stem interacts with the surface of the beta-barrel domain 3. The binding involves many conserved residues in EF-Tu. The overall shape of the ternary complex is similar to that of the translocation factor, EF-G-GDP, and this suggests a novel mechanism involving ""molecular mimicry"" in the translational apparatus."

https://openalex.org/W2015821968,"Yeast checkpoint control genes were found to affect processing of DNA damage as well as cell cycle arrest. An assay that measures DNA damage processing in vivo showed that the checkpoint genes RAD17, RAD24, and MEC3 activated an exonuclease that degrades DNA. The degradation is probably a direct consequence of checkpoint protein function, because RAD17 encodes a putative 3'-5' DNA exonuclease. Another checkpoint gene, RAD9, had a different role: It inhibited the degradation by RAD17, RAD24, and MEC3. A model of how processing of DNA damage may be linked to both DNA repair and cell cycle arrest is proposed."

https://openalex.org/W2095128512,"Spectroscopic measurements of a cool brown dwarf, Gl 229B, reveal absorption features attributable to methane in the near infrared much like those of Jupiter. These features are not seen in any star. The presence of methane indicates that the surface temperature of Gl 229B is below 1000 kelvin. Features attributed to water vapor also indicate that Gl 229B is much cooler than any known star."
https://openalex.org/W2003784210,"Intracellular calcium (Ca2+) inhibits the opening of L-type (alpha 1C) Ca2+ channels, providing physiological control of Ca2+ entry into a wide variety of cells. A structural determinant of this Ca(2+)-sensitive inactivation was revealed by chimeric Ca2+ channels derived from parental alpha 1C and alpha 1E channels, the latter of which is a neuronal channel lacking Ca2+ inactivation. A consensus Ca(2+)-binding motif (an EF hand), located on the alpha 1C subunit, was required for Ca2+ inactivation. Donation of the alpha 1C EF-hand region to the alpha 1E channel conferred the Ca(2+)-inactivating phenotype. These results strongly suggest that Ca2+ binding to the alpha 1C subunit initiates Ca2+ inactivation."

https://openalex.org/W1966775488,"The synthesis and characterization of a system for the study of molecular recognition phenomena are described. The system involves a tetraurea molecule that is capable of assembly into various associated states through hydrogen bonding. In organic solvents, the dynamic transition between a low-ordered (aggregate) state and a highly ordered dimeric assembly can be induced by the introduction of smaller molecules of appropriate size and shape. These smaller molecules, such as benzene, adamantanes, and ferrocenes, act as guests that occupy the pseudospherical capsule formed by the dimeric host. Among various guests, those that best fill the cavity and offer chemical complementarity to the host are preferentially encapsulated."

https://openalex.org/W1975578065,"The structure of the carboxyl-terminal domain of the Escherichia coli RNA polymerase α subunit (αCTD), which is regarded as the contact site for transcription activator proteins and for the promoter UP element, was determined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Its compact structure of four helices and two long arms enclosing its hydrophobic core shows a folding topology distinct from those of other DNA-binding proteins. The UP element binding site was found on the surface comprising helix 1, the amino-terminal end of helix 4, and the preceding loop. Mutation experiments indicated that the contact sites for transcription activator proteins are also on the same surface."
https://openalex.org/W2070604911,"Published data on stellar composition show that carbon in the sun is substantially more abundant than in other stars. A carbon abundance of 225 carbon atoms per 10(6) hydrogen atoms is representative of galactic stars, whereas published values for the sun range from 350 to 470 carbon atoms per 10(6) hydrogen atoms. Other elements are also present in enhanced quantities in the solar system, consistent with suggestions that a supernova event was closely associated with the formation of the solar system. The overabundance of carbon in the solar system has many important implications, including new constraints on nucleosynthesis models for supernovae and substantial modification of the so-called ""cosmic"" composition normally adopted in discussions of galactic and interstellar abundances. A reduction in the galactic carbon budget, as suggested by the stellar composition data, strongly constrains the quantity of carbon that is available for the formation of interstellar dust, and some dust models now appear implausible because they require more carbon than is available."

https://openalex.org/W2007540668,"Human ribosomal RNA synthesis by RNA polymerase I requires the activator UBF and the promoter selectivity factor SL1, which consists of the TATA binding protein (TBP) and three associated subunits, TAFI110, TAFI63, and TAFI48. Here it is shown that both TAFI110 and TAFI63 contact the promoter, whereas TAFI48 serves as a target for interaction with UBF and is required to form a transcriptionally active SL1 complex responsive to UBF in vitro. TAFI48 also alters the ability of TBP to interact with TATA box elements, and the resulting complex fails to support transcription by RNA polymerase II. Thus, TAFI48 may function both as a target to mediate UBF activation and as a class-specific promoter selectivity factor."
https://openalex.org/W2067008054,"The role of natural selection in molecular evolution has been inferred primarily by rejection of null hypotheses based on neutral theory, rather than by acceptance of specific predictions based on selection. In this report, a population genetic test of a specific prediction for selection on DNA polymorphism is presented. Pyrethroid insecticide use constitutes an experiment for which form of selection and molecular target (voltage-gated sodium channels) are both known. As predicted, differential pyrethroid selection on tobacco budworm populations generated significant geographic heterogeneity in sodium channel marker allele frequencies, compared with arbitrary loci."

https://openalex.org/W4229649927,"The Magellan imagery shows that Venus has a crater abundance equivalent to a surface age of 300 million to 500 million years and a crater distribution close to random. Hence, the tectonics of Venus must be quiescent compared to those of Earth in the last few 100 million years. The main debate is whether the decline in tectonic activity on Venus is closer to monotonic or episodic, with enhanced tectonism and volcanism yet to come. The former hypothesis implies that most radioactive heat sources have been differentiated upward; the latter, that they have remained at depth. The low level of activity in the last few 100 million years inferred from imagery favors the monotonic hypothesis; some chemical evidence, particularly the low abundance of radiogenic argon, favors the episodic. A problem for both hypotheses is the rapid decline of thermal and tectonic activity some 300 million to 500 million years ago. The nature of the convective instabilities that caused the decline, and their propagation, are unclear."
