https://openalex.org/W4254084740,"Human rhodopsin in aqueous solution has lambda(max). of 493 mmicro and is lower in the spectrum than the rhodopsins of all other known vertebrates, with the exception of certain deep-sea fishes. Its molar extinction is 40,000 +/- 800. Like other rhodopsins, it bleaches to a mixture of opsin and all-trans retinene and is resynthesized by incubating opsin with neo-b (11-cis) retinene. The regenerated rhodopsin has the same lambda(max). as the extracted pigment; this is due, therefore, not to an unusual retinene but to a characteristic human opsin. The regeneration in solution from opsin and neo-b retinene is a second-order reaction with a half-time, at 29.5 degrees C, of about 2.5 minutes. This is much faster than the synthesis of rhodopsin in the living human eye, and faster than human rod dark-adaptation; the rate of both processes in vivo must be limited by reactions which precede the union of neo-b retinene with opsin, the final step in rhodopsin synthesis. In the rods, rhodopsin is virtually in the solid state-highly oriented in close relation with other highly oriented molecules. In this situation its spectrum is displaced toward the red (lambda(max) 500 mmicro) and is narrower than in solution. For light entering the rods axially, rhodopsin has also a considerably increased extinction, some 1.5 times higher than when randomly oriented. The spectrum of rhodopsin in rods agrees well in form and position with the spectral sensitivity of human rod vision, measured at the retinal surface."

https://openalex.org/W1570047590,"Methyl gamma -linolenate-1-C/sup 14/ was fed to rats, and the fatty acids of depot and organ lipides of the rats were separated chromatographically and counted. The sole highly active fatty acid was arachidonic, which, after hydrogenation and degradation in three steps, was found to have 97% of the activity in carbon atom 3. These results support the hypothesis that gamma - linolenic acid is an intermediate in the conversion of linoleic acid to arachidonic acid. (auth)"

https://openalex.org/W2059300842,The adsorption-absorption of Cs/sup 137/ by algae is of interest because Cs/sup 137/ of the critical fission products in power reactor wastes and atomic weapon fall-out. It is well known that plankton takes up radioactivity in fairly high concentrations. The purpose of this investigation was to study the accumulation of Cs/sup 137/ by fresh water-algae. (A.C.)

https://openalex.org/W2053383454,"During the solar flare cosmic measurements were carried out on a world- wide scale. Though most of the measurements were made at sea level and mountain altitudes, synoptic evaluation of observations made at different geometric latitudes permits inference to be drawn about extra-atmospheric intensity. This intensity was so large that it seems of interest to investigate what ionization might be encountered if human beings should be caught by a large solar flare in extra-atmospheric flight. The neutron intensity of cosmic radiation at sea level during the flare showed 36 times its normal value 21 minutes after the onset of visible activity on the sum and them returned to normal in about 20 hours. At the same time as the above measurements a balloon reaching 50,000 ft recorded 4times normal total ionization. If a 3000% increase in the total ionization at 80,000 ft is reflected in a 15% increase in neutron intensity at sea level, the increase of ionization at great heights must have been tremendous. The implications of exposure hazards in interplanetary space during a large flare are ominous. (A.C.)"
