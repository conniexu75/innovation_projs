https://openalex.org/W2171996338,"The transactivation of TCF target genes induced by Wnt pathway mutations constitutes the primary transforming event in colorectal cancer (CRC). We show that disruption of beta-catenin/TCF-4 activity in CRC cells induces a rapid G1 arrest and blocks a genetic program that is physiologically active in the proliferative compartment of colon crypts. Coincidently, an intestinal differentiation program is induced. The TCF-4 target gene c-MYC plays a central role in this switch by direct repression of the p21(CIP1/WAF1) promoter. Following disruption of beta-catenin/TCF-4 activity, the decreased expression of c-MYC releases p21(CIP1/WAF1) transcription, which in turn mediates G1 arrest and differentiation. Thus, the beta-catenin/TCF-4 complex constitutes the master switch that controls proliferation versus differentiation in healthy and malignant intestinal epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2028516053,"Bearing the public image of a deadly ""gas of rotten eggs,"" hydrogen sulfide (H2S) can be generated in many types of mammalian cells. Functionally, H2S has been implicated in the induction of hippocampal long-term potentiation, brain development, and blood pressure regulation. By acting specifically on KATP channels, H2S can hyperpolarize cell membranes, relax smooth muscle cells, or decrease neuronal excitability. The endogenous metabolism and physiological functions of H2S position this gas well in the novel family of endogenous gaseous transmitters, termed ""gasotransmitters."" It is hypothesized that H2S is the third endogenous signaling gasotransmitter, besides nitric oxide and carbon monoxide. This positioning of H2S will open an exciting field-H2S physiology-encompassing realization of the interaction of H2S and other gasotransmitters, sulfurating modification of proteins, and the functional role of H2S in multiple systems. It may shed light on the pathogenesis of many diseases related to the abnormal metabolism of H2S."
https://openalex.org/W2067526109,"In the small intestine, the progeny of stem cells migrate in precise patterns. Absorptive, enteroendocrine, and goblet cells migrate toward the villus while Paneth cells occupy the bottom of the crypts. We show here that beta-catenin and TCF inversely control the expression of the EphB2/EphB3 receptors and their ligand ephrin-B1 in colorectal cancer and along the crypt-villus axis. Disruption of EphB2 and EphB3 genes reveals that their gene products restrict cell intermingling and allocate cell populations within the intestinal epithelium. In EphB2/EphB3 null mice, the proliferative and differentiated populations intermingle. In adult EphB3(-/-) mice, Paneth cells do not follow their downward migratory path, but scatter along crypt and villus. We conclude that in the intestinal epithelium beta-catenin and TCF couple proliferation and differentiation to the sorting of cell populations through the EphB/ephrin-B system."

We examined whether GLP-1 receptor signaling modifies the cellular susceptibility to apoptosis. Mice administered streptozotocin (STZ), an agent known to induce β cell apoptosis, exhibit sustained improvement in glycemic control and increased levels of plasma insulin with concomitant administration of the GLP-1 agonist exendin-4 (Ex-4). Blood glucose remained significantly lower for weeks after cessation of exendin-4. STZ induced β cell apoptosis, which was significantly reduced by co-administration of Ex-4. Conversely, mice with a targeted disruption of the GLP-1 receptor gene exhibited increased β cell apoptosis after STZ administration. Exendin-4 directly reduced cytokine-induced apoptosis in purified rat β cells exposed to interleukin 1β, tumor necrosis fator α, and interferon γ in vitro. Furthermore, Ex-4-treated BHK-GLP-1R cells exhibited significantly increased cell viability, reduced caspase activity, and decreased cleavage of β-catenin after treatment with cycloheximide in vitro. These findings demonstrate that GLP-1 receptor signaling directly modifies the susceptibility to apoptotic injury, and provides a new potential mechanism linking GLP-1 receptor activation to preservation or enhancement of β cell mass in vivo.

GLP-1 action is essential for glucose homeostasis, because GLP-1 receptor blockade with the antagonist exendin (9–39) increases blood glucose and decreases levels of circulating insulin in human and rodent studies (11Edwards C.M.

Furthermore, GLP-1 and exendin-4 promote differentiation of exocrine cell lines toward a β cell phenotype (21Zhou J. Wang X. Pineyro M.A. Egan J.M. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2358-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), a process that appears to depend on the expression of Pdx-1 (22Hui H. Wright C. Perfetti R.

Administration of GLP-1 or exendin-4 to newborn rats treated with the β cell toxin streptozotocin (STZ) leads to increased β cell mass at postnatal day 7, which persists and remains increased at 2 months of age. The increased β cell mass in the GLP-1/exendin-4 treated rats was attributed to both enhanced β cell proliferation and increased numbers of small budding islets (26Tourrel C. Bailbe D. Meile M.-J. Kergoat M. Portha B. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1562-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Because STZ is known to induce β cell destruction in part through activation of apoptotic pathways (27Morgan N.G. Cable H.C. Newcombe N.R. Williams G.T. Biosci.

Pathol. 1996; 178: 176-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), we examined whether GLP-1 receptor activation influences β cell mass via regulation of cellular susceptibility to apoptotic cell death. Tissue culture medium, serum, flasks, plates, and antibiotics, including G418, were from Invitrogen. Cycloheximide, forskolin, and protease inhibitor mixture were purchased from Sigma. Exendin-4 was from California Peptide Research (Napa, CA). Male C57BL/6 mice, 8 weeks of age, were used for experiments shown in Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3. Age- and sex-matched CD-1 GLP-1R+/+ control mice housed in the same animal facility were used for studies of GLP-1R−/− mice in the CD1 background (8-week-old male mice). All animals were maintained on standard laboratory chow under a 12 h:12 h light-dark schedule, and experiments were conducted according to protocols and guidelines approved by the Toronto General Hospital Animal Care Committee. STZ (Sigma) (50 mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneal injection once daily for 5 days) was administered as a freshly prepared solution in 0.1 mm sodium citrate pH 5.5. Exendin-4 (Ex-4; 24 nmol/kg body weight, a dose selected based on therapeutic efficacy in previous mouse experiments (30Greig N.H. Holloway H.W., De Ore K.A. Jani D. Wang Y. Zhou J. Garant M.J. Egan J.M. Diabetologia. 1999; 42: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar)) was administered as a single daily intraperitoneal injection. For studies depicted in Figs. 1 and 2, morning blood glucose was measured periodically throughout the experimental period and an oral glucose tolerance tests was done at day 30. For histological studies of islet apoptosis, Ex-4 administration was commenced either 2 or 7 days before STZ in separate experiments and continued until the last injection of STZ; C57BL/6 mice were sacrificed within ∼24 h after the last STZ injection. For studies of apoptosis in GLP-1R−/− mice, wild-type GLP-1R+/+ and GLP-1R−/− mice were divided into separate groups (n = 4–6) and administered a slightly lower dose of STZ (40 mg/kg body weight) because of the different sensitivities of CD-1 versus C57BL/6 mice to STZ as delineated in preliminary dose-response studies caused by the known species-specific sensitivity to streptozotocin-induced apoptosis (31Rossini A.A. Appel M.C. Williams R.M. Like A.A. Diabetes. 1977; 26: 916-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). After completion of the experiments (∼48 h after the last dose of STZ), mice were euthanized by CO2 anesthesia, blood was collected by cardiac puncture for plasma insulin determinations, and pancreases were removed, fixed in 10% formalin overnight, and embedded in paraffin for histological analyses.Figure 2Ex-4 reduces hyperglycemia in ST2-treated mice. a, morning-fed blood glucose and plasma insulin levels in wild-type C57BL/6 mice treated with saline (C, control), exendin-4 (Ex-4), STZ, or STZ + Ex-4.

Appel M.C. Williams R.M. Like A.A. Diabetes. 1977; 26: 916-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 66). Approximately 20 islets per slide were assessed, with a minimum of 2 slides analyzed per mouse. cand e, number of BrdUrd+ islet cells was quantified in multiple histological sections from the four different experimental groups, and expressed relative to the number of islets (c) or normalized to relative islet area (e). *,p < 0.05 for number of BrdUrd+ cells in exendin-4 (Ex-4) versus control (C) mice.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Oral glucose tolerance tests were carried out after an overnight fast as described (14Baggio L. Kieffer T.J. Drucker D.J. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3703-3709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Scrocchi L.A. Brown T.J. MacLusky N. Brubaker P.L. Auerbach A.B. Joyner A.L. Drucker D.J. Nature Med. 1996; 2: 1254-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). A blood sample was collected from the tail vein during the 10–20 min time period for measurement of plasma insulin using a rat insulin enzyme-linked immunoassay kit (Crystal Chem. Inc., Chicago, IL) with mouse insulin as a standard (14Baggio L. Kieffer T.J. Drucker D.J. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3703-3709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To detect apoptosis, TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotide transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling) staining was performed using ApopTag Peroxidase in situ Apoptosis detection kit (S7100) (Intergen Company, Purchase, NY), according to the manufacturer's instructions as described (33Boushey R.P. Yusta B. Drucker D.J. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 687-693PubMed Google Scholar). Slides were analyzed with a Leica microscope, and apoptotic rates were calculated as the number of TUNEL-positive cells per islet,n = 6–7 pancreases for each experimental group of C57Bl/6 +/+ mice, or n = 4–6 pancreases for each group of CD1 GLP-1R+/+ or GLP-1R−/− mice. Analysis of serial consecutive islet sections stained with either insulin or the ApopTag reagent demonstrated that the apoptotic nuclei were localized to insulin-immunopositive β cells. Islet cell proliferation was assessed by counting the number of 5′-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine-positve (BrdUrd+) islet cells in multiple pancreatic sections from both wild-type C57BL/6 and CD-1 and GLP-1R−/− CD1 mice administered BrdUrd (Roche) by intraperitoneal injection, 50 mg/kg body weight, ∼ 5 h prior to removal of the pancreas. Immunohistochemical detection of BrdUrd+ cells was carried out using an anti-BrdUrd antibody (CalTag Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Serial sections were stained for either insulin or BrdUrd, and islet and pancreatic areas were measured using a Leica microscope and Q500MC software. The vast majority of BrdUrd+ cells were immunopositive for insulin, and hence represented β cells. The relative cross-sectional β cell area, as a percentage of total pancreatic area, was assessed quantitatively as previously described (34Scrocchi L.A. Hill M.E. Saleh J. Perkins B. Drucker D.J. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1552-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 35Ling Z., Wu, D. Zambre Y. Flamez D. Drucker D.J. Pipeleers D.G. Schuit F.C.

Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1021-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). The number of BrdUrd-positive cells are expressed both per islet and per 105 μm2 β-cell area. Islets were isolated from the pancreas of adult male Wistar rats (180–220 g) by collagenase digestion and purified on a gradient of Ficoll (37Rouiller D.G. Cirulli V. Halban P.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1990; 191: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The islets were further dissociated into single cells by trypsinization, and β cells were sorted on the basis of their autofluorescence using a FACStar Plus (BD Biosciences) as described (37Rouiller D.G. Cirulli V. Halban P.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1990; 191: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The sorted cell population comprises 95% β cells (37Rouiller D.G. Cirulli V. Halban P.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1990; 191: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Cells were allowed to recover from the isolation/sorting procedures by culture overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum, 11.2 mm glucose using plastic dishes to which they did not attach. For measurement of apoptosis by ELISA (see below), cells were seeded (5–8 × 105 cells/ml, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 11.2 mm glucose, 10% fetal calf serum, 50 μl/well) in 96-well plates pre-coated with extracellular matrix from 804G rat bladder carcinoma cells (Desmos, San Diego, CA) (38Bosco D. Meda P. Halban P.A. Rouiller D.G. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). For TUNEL labeling (see below) and labeling with BrdUrd, the sorted β cells were seeded at the same density and in the same medium as 50-μl microdroplets placed at the center of 35-mm-diameter plastic Petri dishes coated with 804G matrix. This allowed for use of an inverted-stage fluorescent microscope to examine the cells (under a coverslip) after fixation. Sorted rat β cells maintained in monolayer culture were exposed to a mixture of three cytokines for 18 h at 8.3 mm glucose. These conditions were established on the basis of preliminary experiments (data not shown) designed to obtain marked augmentation of apoptosis without significant cell necrosis or detachment of cells from the culture vessel. All incubations of cells were in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Exendin-4 was present throughout the 18-h incubation with or without cytokines at a final concentration of 100 nm. Apoptosis of purified β cells was estimated using Cell Death Detection ElisaPLUS (Roche Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) for determination of cytoplasmic histone-associated-DNA-fragments (mono- and oligonucleosomes) in cell lysates, a method that correlates well with apoptosis quantification by annexin V staining (39Barsig J. Kaufmann S.H. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 4075-4081Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, cells seeded in microdroplets on Petri dishes were processed for estimation of apoptosis using the TUNEL technique according to the manufacturer's instructions (“in situ cell death detection kit” from Roche Biochemicals) following fixation for 20 min in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilization using 0.5% Triton X-100 for 4 min at room temperature. Cell replication was assessed by incorporation of BrdUrd (Sigma). For this purpose, BrdUrd (10 μm) was included throughout the 18-h incubation with cytokines or exendin. Cells were then fixed, and BrdUrd+ cells were visualized by immunoflueorescence. BHK fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 4.5g/l glucose supplemented with 5% calf serum. Cells were transfected with cDNAs encoding the rat GLP-1 receptor cloned in the pcDNA3.1 eukaryotic expression vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). Stably transfected cell populations were selected by growth in G418 (Invitrogen) at 0.8 mg/ml for 2 weeks and studies of apoptosis in BHK-GLP-1R cells were done using pools of G418-resistant clones. For apoptosis experiments, cells were replated in culture medium lacking G418, serum-starved overnight, and treated with cycloheximide in the presence or absence of the indicated peptides or drugs as described (40Yusta B. Boushey R.P. Drucker D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35345-35352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Cells were exposed to either vehicle or cycloheximide in the presence or absence of the indicated drugs, and the number of viable cells was assessed by measuring the bioreduction of a methane thiosulforate tetrazolium salt at 490 nm using the CellTiter 96 aqueous assay (Promega, Madison, WI.) Cell pellets were lysed at 4 °C in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing a protease inhibitor mixture, and cleared lysates were boiled in sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol and stored at −70 °C. Protein concentration was determined using bovine serum albumin as a standard and equal amounts of cell lysates were separated by discontinuous SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions and electrotransferred onto Hybond-C nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The resultant blot was blocked with 5% skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Tween 20 and incubated with the indicated primary antibody overnight at room temperature. Proteins were detected with a secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and an enhanced chemiluminescence commercial kit (Amersham Biosciences). Western blot analyses were carried out using primary antibodies reactive to active caspase-3 p17 subunit (1:1000 dilution; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), cytochrome c (1:250 dilution; BIOSOURCEInternational), porin/VDAC 31HL (1:500 dilution; Calbiochem), Akt (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA)) and actin (1:5,000 dilution; Sigma). All values are presented as means ± S.E. Statistical significance between groups was evaluated by student's t test or Bonferroni-corrected analysis of variance. As treatment of rodents with GLP-1 agonists leads to increased islet mass in association with β cell proliferation and islet neogenesis (19Stoffers D.A. Kieffer T.J. Hussain M.A. Drucker D.J. Egan J.M. Bonner-Weir S. Habener J.F. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 741-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 25Xu G. Stoffers D.A. Habener J.F. Bonner-Weir S. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2270-2276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that GLP-1 might also enhance β cell mass via protection from cellular apoptosis. To test this hypothesis, wild-type C57BL/6 mice were treated with low-dose streptozotocin, a chemical known to induce β-cell apoptosis (29O'Brien B.A. Harmon B.V. Cameron D.P. Allan D.J. J. Pathol. 1996; 178: 176-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), in the presence or absence of the GLP-1 analog Ex-4, administered for 2 days before STZ, during, and 3 days after STZ (Fig. 1). The pretreatment regimen was selected in part because of observations that pretreatment of mice with the related glucagon-like peptide GLP-2 significantly reduced apoptosis in experimental models of intestinal injury (33Boushey R.P. Yusta B. Drucker D.J. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 687-693PubMed Google Scholar, 41Boushey R.P. Yusta B. Drucker D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: E937-E947Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mice treated with STZ developed progressive hyperglycemia, with levels of blood glucose rising steadily several days after STZ administration. In contrast, mice that received both STZ (5 days) and Ex-4 (10 days) exhibited a significantly delayed onset of hyperglycemia (compare day 9–12 glucose in STZ versus STZ+Ex-4 mice, Fig. 1) and blood glucose remained significantly lower even 2 weeks after the last dose of Ex-4 (Fig. 1, p < 0.05 for STZ alone versusSTZ+Ex-4 glucose between day 9–29). Furthermore, levels of circulating insulin at day 30 were significantly greater in STZ+Ex-4 mice, 20 days after the last Ex-4 injection (Fig 1). A separate experiment was carried out using a different pre-treatment period starting exendin-4 administration 7 days before STZ, and continuing exendin-4 administration for a total of 28 days, with assessment of oral glucose tolerance and glucose-stimulated insulin at day 30. A similar protective response to Ex-4 was observed in this longer experiment shown in Fig 2. Although hyperglycemia developed in all mice treated with STZ, levels of blood glucose were significantly lower in the STZ+Ex-4 group, even more than 3 weeks after cessation of Ex-4 (Fig. 2 a;p < 0.05 for day 15–52 glucose, STZ versusSTZ+Ex-4). Oral glucose tolerance testing on day 30, 2 days after the last dose of Ex-4, revealed significantly lower glucose excursion specifically at early time points following oral glucose loading, in association with significantly increased levels of plasma insulin in STZ+Ex-4 mice (Fig. 2 b; p < 0.002). Furthermore, the levels of fed plasma insulin remained significantly greater in the STZ+Ex-4-treated mice and were comparable to levels detected in Ex-4-alone mice that did not received streptozotocin (p < 0.05) at day 55, 27 days after the last dose of exendin-4 (Fig. 2 a). To ascertain the mechanisms underlying the sustained improvement in levels of glucose and insulin in STZ+Ex-4 mice, we assessed pancreatic histological sections for the presence of apoptotic β cells in separate groups of mice treated with STZ, with or without Ex-4. Only a rare apoptotic β cell was detectable in histological sections from pancreases of control or Ex-4-treated mice in the absence of STZ (Fig3 a). In contrast, morphological features of apoptosis, including pyknotic nuclei, were readily detectable in pancreatic sections from STZ-treated mice. The numbers of TUNEL-positive apoptotic β cells were markedly increased in STZ-treated mice, and significantly reduced (4.5-fold) in mice administered both STZ and Ex-4, whether expressed as the number of apoptotic cells per islet or normalized to relative β cell area (Fig. 3, b and d; p < 0.001, STZversus STZ+Ex-4). Because GLP-1 agonists have been shown to induce β-cell proliferation (19Stoffers D.A. Kieffer T.J. Hussain M.A. Drucker D.J. Egan J.M. Bonner-Weir S. Habener J.F. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 741-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar), we assessed the extent of β-cell proliferation and expansion of islet mass in the same experiment. Wild-type mice treated with Ex-4 alone for 7 days in the absence of STZ exhibited a greater than 2-fold increase in the number of BrdUrd+ β cells, whether expressed as BrdUrd+ cells per islet, or normalized to β cell area (Fig. 3,c and e, respectively; p < 0.05 for control versus Ex-4-treated mice). In contrast, we did not detect a significant increase in the number of BrdUrd+ cells in Ex-4-treated mice treated for 5 consecutive days with STZ (Fig. 3,c and e). These findings demonstrate that exogenous activation of GLP-1 receptor signaling reduced STZ-associated islet apoptosis in wild-type micein vivo. To ascertain whether basal levels of endogenous GLP-1 receptor signaling protected β cells from external injury, we administered STZ to mice with a targeted disruption of theGlp-1R gene (GLP-1R−/− mice (32Scrocchi L.A. Brown T.J. MacLusky N. Brubaker P.L. Auerbach A.B. Joyner A.L. Drucker D.J. Nature Med. 1996; 2: 1254-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar)). Blood glucose increased more rapidly in GLP-1R−/− versus GLP-1R+/+ mice after STZ administration (Fig. 4,c and e; p < .05 for glucose at day 7 in STZ-treated GLP-1R+/+ versus GLP-1R−/− mice) and remained significantly greater in STZ-treated GLP-1R−/− from day 7–16 (Fig. 4, c and e; p < 0.05; GLP-1R−/− versus control GLP-1R+/+ mice treated with STZ). In contrast, after day 16, the levels of blood glucose in STZ-treated mice remained elevated however no significant differences in glucose (Fig. 4, c) were detected in GLP-1R−/−versus GLP-1R+/+ by day 28, 23 days after the last dose of STZ. Similarly, levels of glucose-stimulated insulin at day 7 were not significantly different. In contrast, the number of apoptotic β cells detected ∼48 h after the last dose of STZ was increased in both GLP-1R+/+ and GLP-1R−/− mice and was significantly greater (2.7-fold) in GLP-1R−/− mice treated with identical doses of STZ (Fig. 4,a and b; p < 0.002). Taken together, the data presented in Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4 demonstrate that activation or abrogation of GLP-1 receptor signaling regulates the extent of murine β cell apoptosis in vivo. To determine whether GLP-1 agonists exert direct anti-apoptotic effects on islet β cells in vitro using a different approach for generation of cytotoxic injury, we induced apoptosis in purified populations of s"

Here, we report that dopamine D1 receptors modulate NMDA glutamate receptor-mediated functions through direct protein-protein interactions. Two regions in the D1 receptor carboxyl tail can directly and selectively couple to NMDA glutamate receptor subunits NR1-1a and NR2A. While one interaction is involved in the inhibition of NMDA receptor-gated currents, the other is implicated in the attenuation of NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity through a PI-3 kinase-dependent pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2119590183,"The current study examines the association between glucose induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial (Mt) depolarization, and programmed cell death in primary neurons. In primary dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, 45 mM glucose rapidly induces a peak rise in ROS corresponding to a 50% increase in mean Mt size at 6 h (P<0.001). This is coupled with loss of regulation of the Mt membrane potential (Mt membrane hyperpolarization, followed by depolarization, MMD), partial depletion of ATP, and activation of caspase-3 and -9. Glucose-induced activation of ROS, MMD, and caspase-3 and -9 activation is inhibited by myxothiazole and thenoyltrifluoroacetone (P<0.001), which inhibit specific components of the Mt electron transfer chain. Similarly, MMD and caspase-3 activation are inhibited by 100 microM bongkrekic acid (an inhibitor of the adenosine nucleotide translocase ANT). These results indicate that mild increases in glucose induce ROS and Mt swelling that precedes neuronal apoptosis. Glucotoxicity is blocked by inhibiting ROS induction, MMD, or caspase cleavage by specific inhibitors of electron transfer, or by stabilizing the ANT."

https://openalex.org/W2105080404,"There is growing evidence for the involvement of nitric oxide (NO) -mediated nitrosation in cell signaling and pathology. Although S-nitrosothiols (RSNOs) have been frequently implicated in these processes, it is unclear whether NO forms nitrosyl adducts with moieties other than thiols. A major obstacle in assessing the significance of formation of nitrosated species is the limited reliability of available analytical techniques for measurements in complex biological matrices. Here we report on the presence of nitrosated compounds in plasma and erythrocytes of rats, mice, guinea pigs, and monkeys under basal conditions, in immunologically challenged murine macrophages in vitro and laboratory animals in vivo. Besides RSNOs, all biological samples also contained mercury-stable nitroso species, indicating the additional involvement of amine and heme nitros(yl)ation reactions. Significant differences in the amounts and ratios of RSNOs over N- and heme-nitros(yl)ated compounds were found between species and organs. These observations were made possible by the development of a novel gas-phase chemiluminescence-based technique that allows detection of nitroso species in tissues and biological fluids without prior extraction or deproteinization. The method can quantify as little as 100 fmol bound NO and has been validated extensively for use in different biological matrices. Discrimination between nitrite, RSNOs, and N-nitroso or nitrosylheme compounds is accomplished by use of group-specific reagents. Our findings suggest that NO generation in vivo leads to concomitant formation of RSNOs, nitrosamines, and nitrosylhemes with considerable variation between rodents and primates, highlighting the difficulty in comparing data between different animal models and extrapolating results from experimental animals to human physiology."
https://openalex.org/W2101050876,"During fasting and many systemic diseases, muscle undergoes rapid loss of protein and functional capacity. To define the transcriptional changes triggering muscle atrophy and energy conservation in fasting, we used cDNA microarrays to compare mRNAs from muscles of control and food-deprived mice. Expression of >94% of genes did not change, but interesting patterns emerged among genes that were differentially expressed: 1) mRNAs encoding polyubiquitin, ubiquitin extension proteins, and many (but not all) proteasome subunits increased, which presumably contributes to accelerated protein breakdown; 2) a dramatic increase in mRNA for the ubiquitin ligase, atrogin-1, but not most E3s; 3) a significant suppression of mRNA for myosin binding protein H (but not other myofibrillar proteins) and IGF binding protein 5, which may favor cell protein loss; 4) decreases in mRNAs for several glycolytic enzymes and phosphorylase kinase subunits, and dramatic increases in mRNAs for pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 and glutamine synthase, which should promote glucose sparing and gluconeogenesis. During fasting, metallothionein mRNA increased dramatically, mRNAs for extracellular matrix components fell, and mRNAs that may favor cap-independent mRNA translation rose. Significant changes occurred in mRNAs for many growth-related proteins and transcriptional regulators. These transcriptional changes indicate a complex adaptive program that should favor protein degradation and suppress glucose oxidation in muscle. Similar analysis of muscles atrophying for other causes is allowing us to identify a set of atrophy-specific changes in gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2001325871,"Visual performance of the vertebrate eye requires large amounts of oxygen, and thus the retina is one of the highest oxygen-consuming tissues of the body. Here we show that neuroglobin, a neuron-specific respiratory protein distantly related to hemoglobin and myoglobin, is present at high amounts in the mouse retina (approximately 100 microm). The estimated concentration of neuroglobin in the retina is thus about 100-fold higher than in the brain and is in the same range as that of myoglobin in the muscle. Neuroglobin is expressed in all neurons of the retina but not in the retinal pigment epithelium. Neuroglobin mRNA was detected in the perikarya of the nuclear and ganglion layers of the neuronal retina, whereas the protein was present mainly in the plexiform layers and in the ellipsoid region of photoreceptor inner segment. The distribution of neuroglobin correlates with the subcellular localization of mitochondria and with the relative oxygen demands, as the plexiform layers and the inner segment consume most of the retinal oxygen. These findings suggest that neuroglobin supplies oxygen to the retina, similar to myoglobin in the myocardium and the skeletal muscle."

We used single and double mutations in the pore of the Shaker K+ channel to analyze a late concerted pore opening transition and interpreted the results in the context of known K+ channel structures. Gating sensitive mutations are located at mechanistically informative regions of the pore and are coupled energetically across distances up to 15 Å. We propose that the pore is intrinsically more stable when closed, and that to open the pore the voltage sensors must exert positive work by applying an outward lateral force near the inner helix bundle."

Nocturnal light elevates mRNA of the Period1(Per1) gene and induces long term state changes, expressed as phase shifts of circadian rhythms.

As a projection site of the retinohypothalamic tract, the SCN is poised to respond to retinal light information, mediated primarily by glutamatergic (GLU) neurotransmission, to assure time-of-day congruence between the endogenous pacemaker and the external environment. The mechanisms by which the SCN decodes and processes light information are complex and change as the biochemical clock states progress through their 24-h cycle (1Gillette M.U. Tischkau S.A. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1999; 54: 33-59PubMed Google Scholar). Light resets the clock throughout the night via glutamatergic-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor-mediated Ca2+ influx, which activates nitric-oxide synthase to liberate nitric oxide (NO) (2Ding J.M. Chen D. Weber E.T. Faiman L.E. Rea M.A. Gillette M.U. Science. 1994; 266: 1713-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). At this point, the light signaling pathway diverges. In the early night, the light-induced state change, which delays subsequent rhythms, proceeds through NO-dependent activation of a neuronal ryanodine receptor. Light-induced state changes in the late night are independent of ryanodine receptor activation, but require activation of protein kinase G (PKG) (3Weber E.T. Gannon R.L. Rea M.A. Neurosci.

This investigation was undertaken to determine whether CRE-mediated activation of Per1 is required for light/GLU-induced phase resetting of the SCN clock. We hypothesized that the GLU-induced phase advance requires activation of CRE and elevation of Per1 mRNA. Therefore, we examined the ability of an oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) decoy (CRE-decoy) to 1) sequester CREB and inhibit CRE-mediated transcription, 2) inhibit GLU-induced phase advances of SCN electrical activity and light-induced phase advances of wheel running activity, and 3) block GLU-induced up-regulation of Per1 levels. Long-Evans rats (6–12 weeks old) from our inbred line were used for all in vitroexperiments. After greater than 35 generations of inbreeding, this line surpasses the requirements for genetic homogeneity, resulting in low variation for physiological experiments. Rats were entrained to a daily cycle of 12-h light:12-h dark and provided food and water ad libitum. Because the rat SCN generates stable 24-h rhythms of electrical activity when maintained in vitro over the 2–3 days of experimentation, in vitro clock time was determined from the lighting cycle in the donor colony. Circadian time 0 (CT 0) is designated as the time of lights on in the donor colony; subjective day is CT 0–12. Subjective night (CT 12–24) corresponds to the dark portion of the donor's cycle. For in vivo behavioral experiments, male B6129PF1/J mice obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) at ∼4 weeks of age were placed in individual cages (27 × 21 × 14 cm) equipped with running wheels (12-cm diameter). Mice were entrained to a 12-h light: 12-h dark (12:12 light-dark; 100-lux white light) cycle and then released into constant darkness. Circadian rhythms of behavior were assessed by monitoring the wheel-running activity of individually housed mice as described previously (16Tischkau S.A. Gallman E.A. Buchanan G.F. Gillette M.U. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7830-7837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activity was conveyed to a Pentium III computer (Micron, Inc.) equipped with Clocklab Acquisition software (David Ferster, Northwestern University) running in LabView (National Instruments, Inc., Austin, TX). Rhythms were plotted in an actogram with Clocklab Analysis software (David Ferster, Northwestern University) running in Matlab (Mathworks Co., Natick, MA). A guide cannula (26 gauge; 11.2 mm total length; Plastics One, Inc., Roanoke, VA) was stereotaxically implanted unilaterally into the SCN under deep anesthesia (60 mg/kg sodium pentobarbital) using a stereotaxic apparatus (Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL). Surgical coordinates from bregma were −0.3-mm anterior-posterior, −0.1-mm medial-lateral, and −1.8-mm dorsal-ventral (from the surface of dura). The cannula was secured with small machine screws (Small Parts, Inc., Miami Lakes, FL) inserted into the skull and cranioplastic cement (Plastics One, Inc., Roanoke, VA). Following establishment of a well defined, free-running rhythm for at least 10 days, pharmacological manipulations were performed under dim (<1 lux) red illumination. A 10-μl Hamilton syringe (Hamilton Co., Reno, NV) fitted with a 1.5-cm piece of polyethylene tubing and a 33-gauge infusion cannula (Plastics One, Inc., Roanoke, VA) was employed to administer 0.3 μl of 100 μm CRE-decoy ODN (tgacgtcatgacgtcatgacgtca) or a 100 μm concentration of a mismatched sequence of the same nucleotide bases, CRE-mis (tgtggtcatgtggtcatgtggtca) through the guide cannula and into the SCN at CT 21.75. CRE-mis and certain CRE-decoy injections were followed 15 min later (CT 22) by 15-min, 20-lux light pulses. Injection sites were verified histologically, and data from only those animals in which the tip of the injection cannula penetrated the dorsal border of the SCN were used for analyses. Nuclear extracts were isolated as described (17Dash P.K. Moore A.N. Dixon C.E. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 2030-2039Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent SCN 2.2 cells were scraped in wash solution (15 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 250 mm sucrose, 60 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm NaF, 2 mmNaPPi, 5 μm mycrocystin-LR] and centrifuged at 2000 × g for 10 min. Pellets were resuspended in cell lysis solution (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μmmicrocystin-LR, 2 mm NaF, 2 mmNaPPi) and centrifuged at 4000 × g for 10 min to isolate nuclei. The pellet was resuspended in nuclei lysis solution (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 800 mm NaCl, 2 mm NaF, 2 mm NaPPi, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μmmicrocystin-LR, 25% glycerol and centrifuged at 14,000 ×g for 30 min to pellet debris. Supernatant was stored at −20 °C until use. The electromobility of the CRE-decoy was adapted from (18Park Y.G. Nesterova M. Agrawal S. Cho-Chung Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1573-1580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). 5 μg of nuclear extract from SCN 2.2 cells transfected with 75 nm CRE-decoy or CRE-mis using Effectene (Qiagen) was incubated in 100 ng/μl poly(dI-dC), 300 nmdithiothreitol, 12 mm Tris pH 8.0, 2 mmMgCl2, 60 mm KCl, 120 nm EDTA, pH 8.0, 12.5% glycerol for 30 min at 4 °C. 10,000 cpm of32P-end-labeled CRE-decoy was added and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The samples were separated by 8% PAGE and exposed on a phosphorimager screen. Culture extracts were prepared by resuspending frozen SCN cultures stably transfected with a CRE-luciferase construct (45Hurst W.J. Mitchell J.W. Gillette M.U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 298: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) with cell culture lysis buffer (Promega) at ∼25 μl of cell culture lysis buffer/cm2 cell culture surface area. Samples were centrifuged (2000 × g for 5 min) and supernatant collected for luciferase assay. Luciferase assays were performed using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega) and measured on an MLX microtiter plate luminometer (Dynex Technologies) by luc-50. Protein concentration of samples was determined by BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) against bovine serum albumin standards in cell culture lysis buffer. Relative luciferase activity/μg of protein was determined for each culture. Coronal brain slices (500 μm) were prepared at least 2 h prior to the onset of the dark phase of the light:dark cycle to avoid phase shifts during preparation (19Prosser R.A. Gillette M.U. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 1073-1081Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Slices maintained at 37 °C (95% 02, 5% C02) in a Hatton-style brain slice chamber were continuously perfused with minimal salts (Earle's balanced salt solution, pH 7.25) and glucose (24 mm). Perifusion was stopped during treatment. GLU (10 mm, 10 min) was applied by microdrop (1 μl) to the top of each slice. For antisense experiments, antisense sequence (αODN) against the 5′ start site ofPer1 (taggggaccactcatgtct), Per2(tatccattcatgtcg), or Tim (acaagtccatacacc) was applied at a concentration of 10 μm, 2 h prior to the time of GLU treatment by replacing the bath with medium containing the experimental reagent. The phase-shifting effects of stimuli applied to SCN slices in vitro were assessed using the standard extracellular single unit recording technique (19Prosser R.A. Gillette M.U. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 1073-1081Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Spontaneous firing rates of individual neurons were grouped into 2-h running averages using 15-min lags. The time-of-peak for each experiment was determined by visual inspection of a plot of 2-h running averages for the symmetrically highest point. A characteristic sinusoidal pattern of change, such that activity was low at night and peaked near circadian time 7 (CT 7, 7 h after the onset of light in the donor colony) was observed in vehicle-treated control slices. Phase shifts were determined by comparing the mean time-of-peak from treatment groups to vehicle-treated controls. Certain recordings were performed with the experimenter blind to the treatment conditions. Sixty minutes following the initiation of GLU treatment, slices were fixed overnight at 4 °C in 4% paraformaldehyde, followed by cryoprotection in 20% sucrose. Hybridization was performed on 10-μm sections using digoxygenin-labeled riboprobes (cRNA), as described previously (16Tischkau S.A. Gallman E.A. Buchanan G.F. Gillette M.U. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7830-7837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,20Tischkau S.A. Barnes J.A. Lin F.-J. Myers E. Barnes J.W. Meyer-Bernstein E. Hurst W.J. Burgoon P.W. Chen D. Sehgal A. Gillette M.U. J. Neurosci. 1999; RC15: 1-6Google Scholar). Analysis of mPer1-positive cells was made in a midcaudal section of the SCN by an individual blind to the experimental design and identity of the samples. The CRE-decoy is a synthetic single-stranded ODN that self-hybridizes to form duplex/hairpins (18Park Y.G. Nesterova M. Agrawal S. Cho-Chung Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1573-1580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Theoretically, the CRE-decoy will sequester phospho-CREB, preventing its binding and activation of genes containing CRE in their promoters. CRE-decoy and CRE-mis ODN were used to determine whether activation of CRE sites is required for GLU-induced phase advance of the SCN neuronal firing rate rhythm. Two initial experiments were performed to demonstrate that CRE-decoy acts as predicted. The CRE-decoy (75 nm) blocked CRE-CREB binding in SCN 2.2 cells (Fig.1) and inhibited reporter activity in SCN 2.2 cells stably transfected with a luciferase construct driven by 8 tandem repeats of the CRE-palindrome (Fig.2). CRE-mis did not block CRE-CREB binding or alter CRE-driven luciferase activity. These data are in agreement with a previous study by Park et al. (18Park Y.G. Nesterova M. Agrawal S. Cho-Chung Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1573-1580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) demonstrating that the CRE-decoy can penetrate cells, bind CREB, and prevent transcriptional activation from CRE sites.Figure 2CRE-activated transcription is inhibited by the addition of the CRE-decoy. Luciferase activity was quantitated from a SCN 2.2 cell line stably transfected with a luciferase construct driven by eight CRE sites (45Hurst W.J. Mitchell J.W. Gillette M.U. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The relative light units (RLU) normalized to protein concentrations of cells transfected with just the transfection reagent, Effectene, or CRE-mis were similar that of the non-transfected cells (media). However, the cells transfected with the CRE-decoy demonstrated a significant inhibition in CRE-activated luciferase activity. ** indicates statistically significant differences (p < 0.01) as determined by ANOVA with Tukey's post hoc analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether CRE-mediated transcription is required for GLU-induced phase resetting within the SCN, CRE-decoy (1 μm) was applied to SCN slices prior to stimulation with GLU. Spontaneous SCN neuronal activity peaked near CT 7 in control slices (Fig. 3 a, mean time-of-peak = CT 6.78 + 0.10, n = 8). CRE-decoy did not alter the timing of the SCN electrical activity rhythm when applied alone (Fig. 3, b and f, mean time-of-peak CT 6.25 + 0.14, n = 3). Application of GLU to SCN slices at CT 20 caused a phase advance of the SCN electrical activity rhythm (Fig. 3, c and f, mean time-of-peak = CT 3.41 + 0.18, n = 6). CRE-decoy (Fig. 3, dand f, mean time-of-peak CT 6.50 + 0.25, n = 3), but not CRE-mis (Fig. 3, e and f, mean time-of-peak CT 3.47 + 0.12, n = 3), blocked the GLU-induced phase advance. To determine whether CRE-mediated transcription is required for the phase resetting that occurs in response to light signals, CRE-decoy (100 μm) was injected into the SCN 15 min before exposure to a light pulse at CT 22. Neither CRE-decoy nor CRE-mis caused a phase shift of activity rhythms when injected alone (Fig.4). Light pulses caused a characteristic 1.1-h phase advance. Phase resetting effects of light were blocked in the presence of the CRE-decoy. CRE-mis had no effect on light-induced phase shifts. These data suggest that transcriptional activation at CRE sites is required for the light-induced phase advance of circadian behavioral patterns. Alterations in the circadian timing of wheel-running activity and SCN firing rate rhythms represent behavioral and physiological changes associated with light at night. Likewise, induction of Per1 has become a marker of the molecular response to nocturnal light/GLU. To determine whether mRNA forPer1, Per2, or Tim is required for GLU-induced phase advance, αODN surrounding the 5′ start site of each mRNA was applied to the SCN slice in the presence or absence of GLU (Fig. 5). Spontaneous SCN neuronal activity peaked near CT 7 in control slices (Fig. 5 a, mean time-of-peak = CT 6.78 + 0.10, n = 8). GLU induced a ∼3.5-h phase advance in the time-of-peak neuronal activity compared with controls (Fig. 5 b, mean time-of-peak CT 3.42 + 0.14,n = 6). Per1 αODN alone did not alter the time-of-peak (Fig. 5 c, mean time-of-peak = CT 6.42 + 0.35, n = 3). Upon GLU stimulation, Per1αODN blocked the usual ∼3.5-h phase advance (Fig. 5 d, mean time-of-peak = 6.56 + 0.21, n = 3). APer1 sense ODN (Fig. 5 e, mean time-of-peak = 3.75 + 0.12, n = 3), and a Per1 ODN carrying three mismatched nucleotides (Fig. 5 f, mean time-of peak = 3.53 + 0.35, n = 3) had no effect on GLU-induced phase advances. Thus, Per1 mRNA induction is required for GLU-induced clock resetting in the late night. On the other hand, Tim αODN (Fig. 5 g, mean time-of-peak CT 3.6 + 0.22, n = 3) or Per2(Fig. 5 g, time-of-peak CT 3.11 + 0.75, n = 3) did not effect the GLU-induced phase advances. To determine whether the rise in Per1 mRNA induced by GLU and required for the phase shift is mediated by CREB activation, SCN slices were treated and analyzed for Per1 by in situhybridization. The number of Per1-positive cells increased 400% by 60 min after GLU treatment at CT 20 (Fig.6, p < 0.01), consistent with previous results (16Tischkau S.A. Gallman E.A. Buchanan G.F. Gillette M.U. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7830-7837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas treatment with CRE-decoy alone did not affect Per1 levels, the decoy blocked GLU induction ofPer1 (Fig. 6). These data suggest that activation of CREB-regulated transcription is required to induce Per1mRNA. Mechanisms coupling environmental light signals to molecular changes that lead to long term state changes within the circadian clock are emerging as complex and multifunctional. Nocturnal light resets the circadian clock through glutamatergic neurotransmission of retinohypothalamic tract origin (2Ding J.M. Chen D. Weber E.T. Faiman L.E. Rea M.A. Gillette M.U.

Our data provide definitive evidence that CRE-regulated activation of mPer1 mRNA is required for light/GLU-induced phase advances during the late subjective night as predicted from the studies of Travnickova-Benovaet al. on transfected JEG3 cells (29Travnickova-Bendova Z. Cermakian N. Reppert S.M. Sassone-Corsi P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7728-7733Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Inhibition of CRE-mediated transcription by an exogenous CRE sequence (CRE-decoy) that binds CREB, thereby outcompeting its binding to endogenous CRE, conclusively demonstrates that CREB/CRE-activated transcriptional events are required for the light/GLU-induced phase advance. These results extend the findings of a previous study that defined a requirement for CREB phosphorylation on Ser142for light-induced phase shifts (30Gau D. Lemberger T. von Gall C. Kretz O., Le Minh N. Gass P. Schmid W. Schibler U. Korf H. Schutz G. Neuron. 2002; 34: 245-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) by demonstrating that CRE-activated transcriptional events are also required. The presence of CRE-elements (31Yamaguchi S. Mitsui S. Miyake S. Yan L. Onishi H. Yagita K. Suzuki M. Shibata S. Kobayashi K. Okamura H. Curr.

Elevation of Per1 mRNA in response to light is a hallmark of the response of the mammalian molecular clockworks to light. Induction of Per1 is required for light/GLU-induced phase shifts in both early (32Akiyama M. Kouzu Y. Takahashi S. Wakamatsu H. Moriya T. Maetani M. Watanabe S. Tei H. Sakaki Y. Shibata S. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1115-1121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and late night (Fig. 5). Blockage of GLU-induced Per1 accumulation in the presence of the CRE-decoy provides compelling evidence that CRE-mediated transcription contributes to increased levels of Per1. Whereas our data do not exclude a role for ATF-1 or ATF-2 interaction with CRE elements, a previous study indicates that ATF-1 and ATF-2 do not bind the CRE-element in the Per1 promoter (29Travnickova-Bendova Z. Cermakian N. Reppert S.M. Sassone-Corsi P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7728-7733Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). We also did not examine the role of CREM in the Per1 promoter. However, because CREM inhibits CRE-mediated transcription, it is unlikely that induction ofPer1 mRNA is mediated by CREM. Our data designate Per1 as an integral component of the input pathway for light/GLU signaling and reveal a critical distinction between induction of Per1 andPer2/Tim. ODN against Per2 andTim had no effect on GLU-induced phase shifts when applied in a 2-h window before and during the stimulus. Per2, which also contains a canonical CRE within its promoter (29Travnickova-Bendova Z. Cermakian N. Reppert S.M. Sassone-Corsi P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7728-7733Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), may also be induced by light (14Zylka M.J. Shearman L.P. Weaver D.R. Reppert S.M.

Our data suggest that Per2 is not required for light/GLU-induced phase advance. CREB-142 knock-out mice (30Gau D. Lemberger T. von Gall C. Kretz O., Le Minh N. Gass P. Schmid W. Schibler U. Korf H. Schutz G. Neuron. 2002; 34: 245-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), which show increased Per2 despite a severely attenuated phase-shifting reponse to light, are consistent with our data and suggest different roles for Per1 versus Per2. Because elevation of Tim by light is restricted to early night (20Tischkau S.A. Barnes J.A. Lin F.-J. Myers E. Barnes J.W. Meyer-Bernstein E. Hurst W.J. Burgoon P.W. Chen D. Sehgal A. Gillette M.U. J. Neurosci. 1999; RC15: 1-6Google Scholar), it is unlikely that Tim mRNA plays a role in the late night. We hypothesize that any light/GLU-induced alteration inPer2 or Tim is a consequence of the reestablishment of the new circadian phase, which happens in less than 1 h in response to the phase-shifting event (34Best J.D. Maywood E.S. Smith K.L. Hastings M.H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 828-835Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data raise a fundamental question with regard to the role ofPer1 within the molecular clockwork. Is Per1 part of the core clock mechanism or exclusively a component of an input or entrainment pathway? The absence of free-running circadian rhythms in mice lacking Per2, Cry1, and Cry2 has established those genes as core elements in the mammalian clock (35van der Horst G.T. Muijtjens M. Kobayashi K.

To examine the phosphorylation of tau at primed and unprimed epitopes and how this impacts tau function, the R96A mutant of GSK3β was used, a mutation that prevents phosphorylation of substrates at primed sites. Both GSK3β and GSK3β-R96A phosphorylated tau efficiently in situ. However, expression of GSK3β-R96A resulted in significantly less phosphorylation of tau at primed sites compared with GSK3β. Conversely, GSK3β-R96A phosphorylated unprimed tau sites to a significantly greater extent than GSK3β. Prephosphorylating tau with cdk5/p25 impaired the ability of GSK3β-R96A to phosphorylate tau, whereas GSK3β-R96A phosphorylated recombinant tau to a significantly greater extent than GSK3β. Moreover, the amount of tau associated with microtubules was reduced by overexpression of GSK3β but only when tau was phosphorylated at primed sites, as phosphorylation of tau by GSK3β-R96A did not negatively regulate the association of tau with microtubules.

Although all these kinases can phosphorylate tau in situ, there is emerging evidence that GSK3β may play a major role in regulating tau phosphorylation both in physiological and pathological conditions.GSK3β is expressed ubiquitously and found at high levels in brain where it localizes predominantly to neurons (30Woodgett J.R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2431-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). GSK3β is a critically important protein kinase in brain as it phosphorylates a number of important substrates including transcription factors such as β-catenin, cAMP-response element-binding protein, and cytoskeletal proteins such as MAP1B and tau, which regulates their function (31Grimes C.A. Jope R.S. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 391-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1304) Google Scholar). Although numerous GSK3β substrates have been identified, the consensus sites recognized by GSK3β are not straightforward. GSK3β can phosphorylate unprimed sites at Ser/Thr-Pro motifs. Examples of unprimed substrates are axin and adenomatous polyposis coli gene product (APC) (32Frame S. Cohen P. Biondi R.M. Mol.

In other cases the substrate must first be phosphorylated at a site that is four amino acids C-terminal to the target site, which primes the substrate for phosphorylation by GSK3β.

Interestingly, although GSK3β phosphorylates tau at unprimed sites (39Hanger D.P. Hughes K. Woodgett J.R. Brion J.P. Anderton B.H. Neurosci.

Phosphorylation of GSK3β on Tyr-216 increases its activity (43Hughes K. Nikolakaki E. Plyte S.E. Totty N.F. Woodgett J.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 803-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar), and phosphorylation at Ser-9 inhibits kinase activity (44Dajani R. Fraser E. Roe S.M. Young N. Good V. Dale T.C. Pearl L.H.

Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 391-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1304) Google Scholar). In response to insulin or insulin-like growth factor, Akt is activated, and this kinase phosphorylates GSK3β on Ser-9 decreasing its activity (46Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4327) Google Scholar). Recently, it was demonstrated that phosphorylation of Ser-9 results in the N-terminal of GSK3β acting as a pseudosubstrate, occupying the same binding site used by primed substrates (32Frame S.

Biol. 2001; 8: 593-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). It was also found that Arg-96 in GSK3β is critically important in forming the binding pocket for the phosphate group of the primed substrates (or pseudosubstrate) (32Frame S. Cohen P. Biondi R.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1321-1327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 44Dajani R. Fraser E. Roe S.M. Young N. Good V. Dale T.C. Pearl L.H.

Biol. 2001; 8: 593-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Mutation of Arg-96 to Ala decreased the ability of GSK3β to phosphorylate primed substrates significantly but had no effect on its ability to phosphorylate unprimed sites (32Frame S. Cohen P. Biondi R.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1321-1327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar).Although there are data to suggest that tau is both a primed and unprimed substrate of GSK3β in situ, this has not been demonstrated clearly. Further, how phosphorylation of tau by GSK3β on different sites modulates its association with microtubules has not been explored thoroughly. By using wild type GSK3β and GSK3β with the R96A or S9A mutation we demonstrate that GSK3β phosphorylates tau at both primed sites (pThr-231) and unprimed sites (pSer-396/404). Disruption of the GSK3β phosphate-binding pocket (R96A mutation) results in a significant decrease in tau phosphorylation at the primed site of Thr-231 and an enhancement of phosphorylation at the unprimed site of Ser-396/404. Further, GSK3β-R96A phosphorylates recombinant tau to a significantly greater extent than wild type or GSK3β-S9A; however if tau is first phosphorylated by cdk5/p25 then GSK3β-R96A is significantly less effective than wild type or GSK3β-S9A in phosphorylating tau. Finally, GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation of tau at only the primed sites decreases tau-microtubule interactions.DISCUSSIONThe aim of this study was to gain insight into the site-specific tau phosphorylation by GSK3β and to determine how phosphorylation of specific epitopes on tau affects its function. Our results clearly demonstrate that GSK3β phosphorylates tau on both primed and unprimed sites; however it is the phosphorylation of tau at the primed epitopes that decreases tau-microtubule interactions.It has been demonstrated unequivocally that GSK3β phosphorylates tauin situ; however most studies have focused the phosphorylation of unprimed sites such as PHF-1, Tau-1, and AT8 (25Lovestone S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 41340-43149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), although in a transgenic mouse model that expressed both human tau and GSK3β-S9A an increase in AT180 immunoreactivity was noted (59Spittaels K. Van den Haute C. Van Dorpe J. Geerts H. Mercken M. Bruynseels K. Lasrado R. Vandezande K. Laenen I. Boon T. Van Lint J. Vandenheede J. Moechars D. Loos R. Van Leuven F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41340-43149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In vitro it has been demonstrated that AT180 recognition of tau requires Thr-231 to be phosphorylated, and GSK3β can phosphorylate tau on this site only when Ser-235 is already phosphorylated (53Goedert M. Jakes R. Crowther R.A. Cohen P. Vanmechelen E. Vandermeeren M. Cras P. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 871-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Therefore, AT180 recognizes a primed GSK3β epitope. In situ we have shown that disruption of the priming phosphate-binding pocket in GSK3β by making the R96A mutation (32Frame S. Cohen P. Biondi R.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1321-1327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 44Dajani R. Fraser E. Roe S.M. Young N. Good V. Dale T.C. Pearl L.H. Cell. 2001; 105: 721-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar) impairs the ability of GSK3β to phosphorylate tau at the AT180 epitope significantly, confirming the in vitrofindings. Further, priming of recombinant tau by prephosphorylating it with cdk5/p25 (41Ishiguro K. Shiratsuchi A. Sato S. Omori A. Arioka M. Kobayashi S. Uchida T. Imahori K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 325: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 42Sengupta A., Wu, Q. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Singh T.J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 167: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) results in a decrease in tau phosphorylation by the GSK3β-R96A mutant compared with wild type GSK3β and GSK3β with the S9A mutation. Interestingly, GSK3β and GSK3β-S9A phosphorylated tau to a similar extent; however GSK3β-R96A phosphorylated recombinant tau much more efficiently than both GSK3β and GSK3β-S9A. These data indicate that the enhancement of tau phosphorylation by the GSK3β-R96A mutant is not because of the inability of GSK3β-R96A to be inhibited by the pseudosubstrate of the phosphorylated N-terminal (32Frame S. Cohen P. Biondi R.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1321-1327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 44Dajani R. Fraser E. Roe S.M. Young N. Good V. Dale T.C. Pearl L.H. Cell. 2001; 105: 721-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). In addition, tau phosphorylation at the non-primed PHF-1 epitope was much greater when cells were co-transfected with HA-GSK3β-R96A compared with HA-GSK3β or HA-GSK3β-S9A. The reason for the enhancement in non-primed tau phosphorylation by the GSK-R96A mutant is unknown, but may be because of an increase in the accessibility of tau to the active site. However, the R96A mutation of GSK3β did not affect phosphorylation of axin or β-catenin (32Frame S. Cohen P. Biondi R.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1321-1327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar).GSK3β is a constitutively active kinase that is inactivated by Ser-9 phosphorylation. Engagement of signaling pathways that activate Akt results in GSK3β Ser-9 phosphorylation and down-regulation of GSK3β activity. In addition, other protein kinases such as protein kinase C and mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 1 can phosphorylate Ser-9 on GSK3β and down-regulate its activity (31Grimes C.A. Jope R.S. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 391-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1304) Google Scholar). In almost all experiments in this study, GSK3β-S9A showed slightly, but not significantly, more activity than GSK3β. The likely reason for this observation is that all measures were done under basal conditions and not in the presence of signals that would activate Akt, and therefore the effects of the S9A mutation on GSK3β activity were not prominent.There is good evidence that in situ GSK3β-mediated tau phosphorylation decreases the affinity of tau for microtubules. For example, microtubule depolymerization in response to colchicine treatment was greater in cells transfected with tau and GSK3β compared with cells transfected with just tau (57Lovestone S. Hartley C.L. Pearce J. Anderton B.H. Neuroscience. 1996; 73: 1145-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 60Sang H., Lu, Z., Li, Y., Ru, B. Wang W. Chen J. Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 312: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and cells co-transfected with tau and GSK3β exhibited a reduction in microtubule bundling compared with cells transfected with tau alone (26Wagner U. Utton M. Gallo J.M. Miller C.C. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1537-1543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further, in mice transgenic for GSK3β-S9A and tau increased tau phosphorylation occurred, as well a reduction in the axonopathy that was observed in the mice that just overexpressed human tau (59Spittaels K. Van den Haute C. Van Dorpe J. Geerts H. Mercken M. Bruynseels K. Lasrado R. Vandezande K. Laenen I. Boon T. Van Lint J. Vandenheede J. Moechars D. Loos R. Van Leuven F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41340-43149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The reduction in the axonopathy in response to increased expression of GSK3β-S9A is likely because of the fact that the increase in tau phosphorylation resulted in a decrease in tau-microtubule interactions, which thus alleviated the inhibition in axonal transport because of tau overexpression (3Ebneth A. Godemann R. Stamer K. Illenberger S. Trinczek B. Mandelkow E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 777-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar, 59Spittaels K. Van den Haute C. Van Dorpe J. Geerts H. Mercken M. Bruynseels K. Lasrado R. Vandezande K. Laenen I. Boon T. Van Lint J. Vandenheede J. Moechars D. Loos R. Van Leuven F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41340-43149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Although it is clear that tau is phosphorylated by GSK3β on numerous sites, the contribution of these different sites to the regulation of tau function in situ has not been explored thoroughly. In this study we show that although GSK3β-R96A phosphorylates tau in situ at non-primed sites efficiently, and this results in a decrease in the electrophoretic mobility of tau, this did not result in an increase in the amount of free, non-microtubule-bound tau. This is in contrast to wild type GSK3β or GSK3β-S9A, which did cause an increase in the levels of unbound tau. Further, AT180 immunoreactivity was only found in the soluble or unbound fraction, indicating that phosphorylation within this epitope and/or at other primed sites may play an important role in regulating the interaction of tau with microtubules. In contrast, PHF-1 immunoreactivity was found exclusively in the bound fractions (Fig. 5 A), indicating that phosphorylation of tau at this epitope and/or at other unprimed GSK3β sites plays less of a role in regulating tau-microtubule interaction. The finding that GSK3β phosphorylation of primed sites on tau may play a more significant role in regulating the function of tau than unprimed sites is quite intriguing given the fact that the majority of GSK3β substrates are primed (35Harwood A.J. Cell. 2001; 105: 821-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Additionally, recent data have shown that β-catenin, which was believed previously to be an unprimed substrate of GSK3β, is actually primed by casein kinase Iα (61Liu C., Li, Y. Semenov M. Han C. Baeg G.H. Tan Y. Zhang Z. Lin X. He X. Cell. 2002; 108: 837-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar). Further, different substrates of GSK3β require different priming protein kinases, such as protein kinase A for cAMP-response element-binding protein and casein kinase II for glycogen synthase (31Grimes C.A. Jope R.S. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 391-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1304) Google Scholar) and of course casein kinase Iα for β-catenin (61Liu C., Li, Y. Semenov M. Han C. Baeg G.H. Tan Y. Zhang Z. Lin X. He X. Cell. 2002; 108: 837-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar). Therefore one can speculate that the most functionally relevant GSK3β-mediated tau phosphorylation events are at primed epitopes and that perhaps protein kinase(s) like cdk5/p25 may play an essential role in regulating GSK3β-mediated tau phosphorylation (41Ishiguro K. Shiratsuchi A. Sato S. Omori A. Arioka M. Kobayashi S. Uchida T. Imahori K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 325: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 42Sengupta A., Wu, Q. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Singh T.J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 167: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Indeed, GSK3β and cdk5/p35[p25] co-purify together with tau and microtubules and were referred to originally as tau protein kinase I and II, respectively (62Imahori K. Uchida T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1997; 121: 179-188PubMed Google Scholar). A dual kinase system for the regulation of tau phosphorylation by GSK3β would give a high degree of control for GSK3β substrate selectivity and provide for the needed regulation of tau function in the cell. Further studies are required to fully elucidate the role of GSK3β-mediated tau phosphorylation at both primed and unprimed sites and how these site-specific phosphorylation events affect tau function. Tau is a family of microtubule-associated proteins that are expressed predominantly in neurons and are produced by alternative splicing of a single gene (1Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Potier M.C. Ulrich J. Crowther R.A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar, 2Lee G. Cowan N. Kirschner M. Science. 1988; 239: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Although tau likely plays a role in numerous neuronal processes, such as vesicle transport (3Ebneth A. Godemann R. Stamer K. Illenberger S. Trinczek B. Mandelkow E. J.

Free radicals are a special focus as the final causative molecules in the pathogenesis of lung injury caused by LPS. Although in vitro investigation has demonstrated radical generation after exposure of cells to LPS, in vivo evidence is lacking. Using electron spin resonance (ESR) and the spin trap alpha-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide)-N-tert-butylnitrone (POBN), we investigated in vivo free radical production by rats treated with intratracheal instillation of LPS. ESR spectroscopy of lipid extract from lungs exposed to LPS for 6 h gave a spectrum consistent with that of a POBN/carbon-centered radical adduct (aN=14.94+/-0.07 G and abetaH=2.42+/-0.06 G) tentatively assigned as a product of lipid peroxidation. To further investigate the mechanism of LPS-initiated free radical generation, rats were pretreated with the phagocytic toxicant GdCl3, which significantly decreased the production of radical adducts with a corresponding decrease in neutrophil infiltration. NADPH oxidase knockout mice completely blocked phagocyte-mediated, ESR-detectable radical production in this model of acute lung injury. Rats treated intratracheally with LPS generate lipid-derived free radicals via activation of NADPH oxidase."

J. 2001; 355: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), have been identified as catalytic subunits of the AMPK family to date. Although it has been reported that AMPK activation is initiated by phosphorylation at Thr172 (14Hawley S.A. Davidson M. Woods A. Davies S.P. Beri R.K. Carling D. Hardie D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27879-27887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar), how the phosphorylation is initiated remains unclear. AMPK is activated under various stress conditions where the cellular ATP concentration decreases and plays a key role in cellular adaptive responses to maintain energy balance. The well known targets of AMPK belong to those involved in energy metabolism including 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA), acyl-CoA decarboxylase, and glucose and amino acid transporters (15Sullivan J.E. Carey F. Carling D. Beri R.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1551-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, the cellular mechanism for survival under stress conditions is complex and includes cell cycle regulation, repair of cellular components, remodeling tissue components, and regulation of the cell death pathway. Targets of AMPK are not fully described to date. Recently, we demonstrated that some tumor cells, such as the pancreatic cancer cell line PANC-1, showed high tolerance against glucose starvation, which is compatible with hypovascular findings on clinical angiography (16Izuishi K. Kato K. Ogura T. Kinoshita T. Esumi H. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6201-6207PubMed Google Scholar), although most cell lines, including a human hepatoma cell line and the human normal fibroblast cell line, underwent cell death under glucose starvation (16Izuishi K. Kato K. Ogura T. Kinoshita T. Esumi H. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6201-6207PubMed Google Scholar, 17Esumi H. Izuishi K. Kato K. Hashimoto K. Kurashima Y. Kishimoto A. Ogura T. Ozawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32791-32798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Similar tolerance to glucose starvation was induced by hypoxic conditions, and tolerance was found to be dependent on AMPK activity as well as Akt (16Izuishi K. Kato K. Ogura T. Kinoshita T. Esumi H. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6201-6207PubMed Google Scholar, 17Esumi H. Izuishi K. Kato K. Hashimoto K. Kurashima Y. Kishimoto A. Ogura T. Ozawa T. J. Biol.

Commun. 2002; 290: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). During glucose starvation, a G1 phase cell cycle delay occurs with a concomitant increase in p53 phosphorylation, and AMPK appeared to be involved in this process (19Imamura K. Ogura T. Kishimoto A. Kaminishi M. Esumi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 562-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The tumor suppressor gene ATM has been identified as the gene defective in the human genetic disorder ataxia-telangiectasia, which is characterized by neurological degeneration and cancer predisposition (20Lavin M.F. Shiloh Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 177-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, 21Lavin M.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 215-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 22Savitsky K.

ATM is a member of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase family that activates the tumor suppressor p53 during the cellular response to DNA double strand break (23Banin S. Moyal L. Shieh S. Taya Y.

Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). Although several studies have reported a close involvement of the ATM/p53 pathway during the cellular response to DNA damage, the regulation of this pathway, particularly by non-DNA damage events, has not been well described, and it remains unclear how ATM is activated. In the current study, we identified a novel AMPK family member through an investigation of human SNARK and designated it ARK5. ARK5, the activation of which was observed during glucose starvation, caused cells to survive in an Akt-dependent manner. Furthermore, Akt-activated ARK5 phosphorylated ATM both in vivo andin vitro and led to the phosphorylation of p53. We report here that a novel AMPK family member, ARK5, is a new target molecule of Akt and transduces a signal to activate ATM during nutrient starvation. FLAG-tagged ARK5 was prepared from full-length KIAA0537-ligated pBluescript II SK+ vector supplied from KAZUSA DNA Research Institute with LA PCR (Takara Biomedicals, Kyoto, Japan); the up-stream primer was 5′-AAGCTTATGGATTATAAAGATGATGATGATAAAGAAGGGGCCGCCGCGCCTGTGGCGGGG-3′ and the down-stream primer was 5′-TCTAGACTAGTTGAGCTTGCTGCAGATCTCCAG-3′. The PCR product was ligated into pT7-Blue T vector for subcloning, and then insert cDNA digested by HindIII andXbaI was re-ligated into the pcDNA3.1(+) expression vector. Insert cDNA was also ligated into pcDNA3.1(−) expression vector for the preparation of antisense RNA expression vector. The FLAG-ARK5 protein was prepared by immunoprecipitation technology using anti-FLAG-conjugated agarose. A HepG2 cell line overexpressing FLAG-ARK5 (H/ARK) was lysed with PBS containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and then immunoprecipitation was performed. Immunoprecipitates were washed eight times with PBS containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and purification was then examined with SDS-PAGE and silver staining. Monoclonal antibody against FLAG and His6, anti-FLAG-conjugated agarose, recombinant active Akt1, and dominant negative and dominant active Akt1 expression vectors were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. Polyclonal antibody against total Akt and phosphorylated Akt (Ser473) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Cell lines used for current experiments were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma). Cell viability was assessed by the Hoechst 33342/PI staining procedure. Hoechst 33342 and PI were purchased from Molecular Probes. After treatment, cells were collected and stained with Hoechst 33342 and PI and then observed by fluorescence microscopy. Cell induction ratio was indicated by the ratio of cells carrying PI-stained nuclei to total cells (about 1000 cells). FLAG-tagged proteins were isolated from cell lysate by anti-FLAG-conjugated agarose and suspended in kinase buffer containing 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm MgCl2. Subsequently, 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (20 μCi) and recombinant active Akt1 were added to a kinase buffer containing recombinant proteins and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. After incubation, the agarose was washed six times with PBS containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and then re-suspended in PBS, and radioactivity was measured with a scintillation counter. Furthermore, measured samples were separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE for autoradiography. Antibody to human SNARK was raised in rabbits by immunizing them against a peptide based on the predicted amino acid sequence of human SNARK (KKPRQRESGYYSSPEPS). The peptide was synthesized and coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) at the C terminus. Japanese White rabbits were immunized with 0.5 mg of peptide conjugate by initially injecting it in 50% Freund's complete adjuvant (Sigma) and in 50% Freund's incomplete adjuvant (Sigma) for subsequent immunizations. One week after the booster injection of 0.5 mg of peptide conjugate, polyclonal anti-human SNARK antiserum was collected and used for immunoblotting analysis. Crude cell extracts and immunoprecipitates were used to assay the phosphorylation of the SAMS peptide fused to glutathione S-transferase. An enzyme assay was performed at 30 °C in buffer containing 15 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 200 mm 5′-AMP, 200 mm GST-SAMS, cell lysate, 0.01% Briji 35, 0.3 mm dithiothreitol, 15 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm[γ-32P]ATP (10 mCi). After incubation, the fusion protein was purified with glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and counted in scintillation counter (Beckman Coulter). There was no significant difference in K m value between SAMS peptide and GST-SAMS. Recently, a novel AMPK family member, SNARK, was identified from rat (13Lefebvre D.L. Bai Y. Shahmolky N. Poon R. Drucker D.J. Rosen C.F. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). On the basis of the reported amino acid sequence, BLAST search analysis revealed a human cDNA encoding SNARK (the amino acid sequence is listed in Fig. 1 B), and we prepared a polyclonal antibody against the SNARK peptide. Using this antibody, the endogenous expression of SNARK in several human cell lines including lung carcinoma (PC-10 and A549), pancreatic cancer (PANC-1 and ASPC-1), hepatoma (HepG2 and HLE), and fibroblast (HF) was examined. As shown in Fig. 1 A, Western blotting revealed the expression of an unknown cross-reacting protein at 74 kDa in some of cell lines tested (intense expression in PC-10, PANC-1, ASPC-1 and HLE; weak expression in A549 and HF; no expression in HepG2). Because the calculated molecular mass of human SNARK is 69.5 kDa, we tried to identify this 74-kDa unknown protein by BLAST search analysis using human SNARK amino acid sequence or the peptide sequence by which the anti-human SNARK antibody was prepared and a human protein data base, and we found a putative protein encoded by a KIAA0537 cDNA clone. As shown in Fig. 1 B, the putative catalytic domain of SNARK and the KIAA0537 protein showed 84% similarity, and the peptide sequence used for the preparation of the anti-human SNARK antibody also showed strong similarity with the KIAA0537 protein. To investigate whether this KIAA0537 cDNA clone encodes the unknown 74-kDa protein detected by the SNARK antibody, we prepared a FLAG-tagged KIAA0537 cDNA. When the cDNA was expressed in HepG2 cells, Western blotting using monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against FLAG and SNARK gave a common 74-kDa band, suggesting that KIAA0537 cDNA encodes the above mentioned unknown 74-kDa protein (Fig. 1 C). Because four factors, AMPK-α1, AMPK-α2, MELK, and SNARK, have been identified as the catalytic subunits of the AMPK family (Fig. 1 D), we tentatively designated KIAA0537 as ARK5. Homology search analysis of the ARK5 amino acid sequence revealed that it has 55.0% overall homology to human SNARK (data not shown). It also shows 47.0, 45.8, and 42.4% homology to AMPK-α1, AMP-α2, and MELK respectively (data not shown). These data strongly suggest that ARK5 is a serine/threonine protein kinase activated by AMP. This possibility was directly examined by transfecting an ARK5 expression vector into HepG2 cells (H/ARK), which do not otherwise show any cross-reactivity to anti-SNARK for the 74-kDa band (Figs. 1 A and2 A). As shown in Fig. 2 A, H/ARK showed a distinct band at 74 kDa. This was further confirmed by the immunoprecipitation method. Cellular extracts from parental HepG2 and H/ARK cell lines were immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody first, and both the supernatant and the immunoprecipitates were subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-SNARK antiserum. Only immunoprecipitates from H/ARK cells gave strong reactivity (Fig. 2 A). In vitro kinase activity showed a clear increase using GST-SAMS as a substrate after transfection. The activity was further stimulated in the presence of 200 μm AMP (Fig. 2 B), indicating strongly that ARK5 is a novel member of the AMPK family. β- and γ-subunits of AMPK have been well known as the binding proteins of AMPK-α1 and AMPK-α2 (12Stapleton D. Mitchelhill K.I. Gao G. Widmer J. Michell B.J. Teh T. House C.M. Fernandez C.S. Cox T. Witters L.A. Kemp B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 611-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 26Hardie D.G. Carling D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). In the previous report (13Lefebvre D.L. Bai Y. Shahmolky N. Poon R. Drucker D.J. Rosen C.F. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), it appeared that rat SNARK showed the enzyme activity without any binding protein. In the current study, immunoprecipitation and silver staining technologies showed that binding proteins were not required for the enzymatic activity of ARK5 (data not shown). We have proposed that tolerance to nutrient starvation is one of the determinants of tumor malignancy (16Izuishi K. Kato K. Ogura T. Kinoshita T. Esumi H. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6201-6207PubMed Google Scholar, 18Hashimoto K. Kato K. Imamura K. Kishimoto A. Yoshikawa H. Taketani Y. Esumi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and tolerance to glucose starvation can be induced by the activation of AMPK (18Hashimoto K. Kato K. Imamura K. Kishimoto A. Yoshikawa H. Taketani Y. Esumi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) or the hypoxic condition (17Esumi H. Izuishi K. Kato K. Hashimoto K. Kurashima Y. Kishimoto A. Ogura T. Ozawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32791-32798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In this context, the involvement of ARK5 in the mechanism for tolerance to glucose starvation was examined. When a human hepatoma cell line, HepG2, was subjected to glucose starvation under normoxic (21% O2) conditions, more than 90% of the cells underwent necrotic cell death during 24 h treatment, but only 40% of H/ARK cells showed cell death during the same treatment (Fig. 2 C). We prepared an antisense RNA expression vector of ARK5 (ARK5(AS)). When HepG2 or PANC-1 cells were transiently transfected with ARK5(AS), mRNA expression of ARK5 was specifically suppressed (Fig. 2 D). When cells were subjected to glucose starvation at 1% oxygen tension, >90% of HepG2 cells survived, but ∼50% cells died when ARK5(AS) was transfected into HepG2 cells (Fig. 2 E). These results clearly showed that ARK5 is involved in tolerance to glucose starvation. ARK5 activity in whole cell extracts and anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates was measured as the GST-SAMS phosphorylation during glucose starvation. As shown in Fig. 2 F, increased activity was observed in cell extracts and immunoprecipitates from H/ARK cells but not from HepG2 cells. In addition, more increased activity was detected when H/ARK cells were subjected to glucose-free medium for 1 h (Fig. 2 F). We have previously found that another protein kinase, Akt, is activated immediately after nutrient starvation in HepG2 cells (16Izuishi K. Kato K. Ogura T. Kinoshita T. Esumi H. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6201-6207PubMed Google Scholar). As is evident in Fig3 A, Akt was phosphorylated rapidly. Amino acid sequence analysis of ARK5 revealed that there is a perfectly conserved putative Akt phosphorylation site in the C-terminal portion as shown in Fig. 3 B. However, the putative Akt phosphorylation site was not detected in AMPK-α1, AMPK-α2, and SNARK (data not shown). These observations strongly indicate that ARK5 is activated by Akt through phosphorylation at Ser600. This possibility was directly examined in vitro. A point mutant of ARK5 at Ser600 was constructed by substituting Ser with Ala, and an expression vector with a FLAG tag was constructed (ARK5(S600A)). Both wild-type and ARK5(S600A) were transfected into HepG2 cells, and FLAG-tagged ARK5 and ARK5(S600A) were purified by immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody-conjugated agarose. ARK5 phosphorylation was examined after incubation with or without PDK1-activated Akt1 in vitro. As shown in Fig. 3 C, only ARK5 but not ARK5(S600A) was phosphorylated by Akt. In addition, an increased phosphorylation of GST-SAMS was induced by ARK5 but not by ARK5(S600A) in the presence of active Akt1 (Fig. 3 D), suggesting that ARK5 phosphorylated by active Akt1 is enzymatically “active”. To further examine the activation of ARK5 by Akt, physiological interaction of these components in vivo was examined by ARK5 and Akt co-immunoprecipitation. The results clearly showed that ARK5 and Akt were in association with each other, but they dissociated just after Akt activation either by glucose starvation or insulin treatment that activates Akt (Fig. 3 E), which is consistent with the case of Mdm2 phosphorylation by Akt (27Mayo L.D. Donner D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11598-11603Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). No Akt was co-immunoprecipitated from HepG2 cells with anti-FLAG antibody (data not shown). To determine whether enzymatic activation of ARK5 is really required for tolerance to glucose starvation, the effects of transfection of ARK5 mutants and the dominant active and dominant negative forms of Akt as well as the chemical inhibitor of Akt activation on HepG2 survival during glucose starvation were examined. As shown in Fig. 4 A, >90% of HepG2 cells underwent necrotic cell death during 24 h of glucose starvation. Necrotic cell death was markedly suppressed to ∼40% by transfecting wild-type ARK5 but not ARK5(S600A) or ARK5(ΔAPM) (ARK5 lacking 66 amino acids in the C-terminal region including the Akt phosphorylation site). When dominant active (DA-Akt), but not dominant negative, (DN-Akt) Akt was transfected into HepG2, cell death induction was also suppressed significantly. The combined expression of ARK5 and dominant active Akt suppressed cell death further, down to ∼20%, but dominant negative Akt and/or mutants of ARK5 failed to do so (Fig. 4 A). These results clearly indicated that ARK5 activated by active Akt is essential for tolerance to glucose starvation in HepG2 cells. These observations were further confirmed using H/ARK cells (Fig. 4 B). When dominant active Akt is introduced into H/ARK cells, cell death was remarkably suppressed (Fig. 4 B). However, when dominant negative Akt was used, induction of cell death occurred to a greater extent (Fig. 4 B). When an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase, LY294002 (28Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was included, activation of Akt was clearly inhibited with a concomitant increase in cell death. These results are consistent with those for transient transfections. Tumor tolerance against nutrient starvation is found to be modulated by AMPK (18Hashimoto K. Kato K. Imamura K. Kishimoto A. Yoshikawa H. Taketani Y. Esumi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 29Kato K. Ogura T. Kishimoto A. Minegishi Y. Nakajima N. Miyazaki M. Esumi H. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6082-6090Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), and AMPK activation induces a G1 cell cycle delay as a result of p53 stabilization (19Imamura K. Ogura T. Kishimoto A. Kaminishi M. Esumi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 562-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Because ATM is well known as a p53 activator, we suspected that ATM might be a target of AMPKs. As shown in Fig. 5 A, amino acid sequence analysis revealed that ATM contains some putative phosphorylation sites for Akt (two sites) and AMPK (three sites). Using the PANC-1 cell in which His-tagged ATM (30Zhang N. Chen P. Khanna K.K. Scott S. Gatei M. Kozlov S. Watters D. Spring K. Yen T. Lavin M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8021-8026Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) is stably expressed (P/ATM), an in vivo 32P-labeling study was performed. 32P incorporation into His-ATM was detected in P/ATM cells cultured in ordinary medium, and an increase in ATM phosphorylation was detected when P/ATM cells were subjected to glucose starvation (Fig. 5 B). Interestingly, ATM phosphorylation was completely suppressed by the transient expression of an antisense RNA expression vector of ARK5, and an increased phosphorylation of ATM was detected in cells transiently expressing ARK5 (Fig. 5 B), suggesting that ARK5 phosphorylates ATM during glucose starvation. To further confirm this possibility, in vitro phosphorylation was examined. As shown in Fig. 5 C, ARK5- or PDK1-activated Akt1 alone did not phosphorylate ATM; however, ATM phosphorylation was detected in the presence of both ARK5 and active Akt1, indicating that ARK5 phosphorylates ATM directly. To determine that this phosphorylation of ATM was activating ATM kinase, we assayed for phosphorylation of p53, which has been shown to be a downstream effector of ATM (23Banin S. Moyal L. Shieh S. Taya Y. Anderson C.W. Chessa L. Smorodinsky N.I. Prives C. Reiss Y. Shiloh Y. Ziv Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1674-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (1706) Google Scholar, 24Canman C.E. Lim D.S. Cimprich K.A.

Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). The results in Fig. 5 D reveal that p53 is phosphorylated in the presence of both ATM and ARK5, suggesting that ARK5-phosphorylated ATM is functionally active. When HepG2 cells were subjected to glucose-free medium for 1 h, an accumulation of p53 protein was observed (Fig. 5 E). This p53 accumulation induced by glucose starvation was completely suppressed by the transient transfection of ARK5(AS) (Fig. 5 E). These results indicate that ARK5 activated during glucose starvation induces p53 accumulation through the functional phosphorylation of ATM in tumor cells. We recently found that some tumor cells have a strong tolerance to nutrient starvation; tolerance to glucose starvation can be induced by hypoxia in normal human fibroblasts and the human hepatoma HepG2 cells, which are otherwise quite sensitive to glucose starvation. Akt and AMPK appear to be involved closely in the mechanism of tolerance (16Izuishi K. Kato K. Ogura T. Kinoshita T. Esumi H. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6201-6207PubMed Google Scholar, 17Esumi H.

Kato K. Imamura K. Kishimoto A. Yoshikawa H. Taketani Y. Esumi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Taking all these findings into consideration, we suspected that there might be a connection between Akt and AMPK signaling pathways. The consensus sequence of the Akt phosphorylation is conserved in several species. ARK5, but not other members of AMPK family, contains this sequence at amino acids 595–600, and direct activation by Akt was demonstrated by phosphorylation in vitro in this study. This observation strongly indicates that ARK5 is a novel target of Akt. During glucose starvation, cell survival was induced by ARK5, and ARK5 mutants blocked DA-Akt1-induced cell survival, indicating that ARK5 acts as the tumor cell survival factor down-stream to Akt in HepG2 cells. In previous studies, we found that the antisense RNA expression constructs for AMPK-α1 and AMP-α2 subunits suppressed hypoxia-induced tolerance to glucose starvation in HepG2 cells (17Esumi H.

Miyazaki M. Esumi H. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6082-6090Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), indicating a close involvement of AMPK-α1 and AMP-α2 in tumor cell tolerance during glucose starvation. AMPK-α1 appeared to be more responsive to hypoxic conditions than AMPK-α2 (17Esumi H. Izuishi K. Kato K. Hashimoto K. Kurashima Y. Kishimoto A. Ogura T. Ozawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32791-32798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In our previous reports (16Izuishi K. Kato K. Ogura T. Kinoshita T. Esumi H.

Chem. 2002; 277: 32791-32798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), we also demonstrated an important role of Akt in tumor cell tolerance induced by hypoxia. The Akt phosphorylation was suppressed by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and wortmannin, but not by the AMPK inhibitor AraA (16Izuishi K. Kato K. Ogura T. Kinoshita T. Esumi H. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6201-6207PubMed Google Scholar, 17Esumi H. Izuishi K. Kato K. Hashimoto K. Kurashima Y. Kishimoto A. Ogura T. Ozawa T. J. Biol.

Because only ARK5 but not any other member of the AMPK family is responsive to Akt, it appears that ARK5 acts as the key mediator of Akt in tumor cell tolerance during glucose starvation. ARK5, the activation of which is induced by Akt during glucose starvation and hypoxia, may influence AMPK-α1 and AMPK-α2 to induce tumor cell tolerance to glucose starvation under the hypoxic condition. Recently, we demonstrated that the AMPK family is involved in cell cycle arrest via p53 accumulation (19Imamura K. Ogura T. Kishimoto A. Kaminishi M. Esumi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 562-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). ATM is a member of the phosphatidylinositol kinase family (20Lavin M.F. Shiloh Y. Annu. Rev.

In response to DNA damage, activated ATM phosphorylates p53 directly on Ser15 and indirectly through Chk2 on Ser20, causing cell cycle arrest or cell death (23Banin S. Moyal L. Shieh S. Taya Y.

In addition to acting as a sensor of DNA damage, it has been suggested that ATM is also a sensor of oxidative stress (31Rotman G. Shiloh Y.

Evidence for increased oxidative stress in A-T cells and in ATM gene-disrupted mice supports this suggestion (33Barlow C. Brown K.D. Deng C.X. Tagle D.A. Wynshaw-Boris A. Nat.

Nutrient starvation induces necrotic cell death in HepG2 cells, and a comet assay revealed that necrotic cell death is not due to DNA double strand break (data not shown). Recently, we found ATM-induced phosphorylation and accumulation of p53 following p21 up-regulation and cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase in HepG2 cells during glucose starvation. 2G. Kusakai, A. Suzuki, A. Kishimoto, J. Lu, T. Ogura, M. Lavin, and H. Esumi, submitted for publication. Our current observations that ARK5 phosphorylated ATM in vitroand in vivo in response to glucose starvation together with an involvement of the ATM/p53 pathway in maintaining cell survival during glucose deprivation provide additional support for a more general role for ATM in intracellular signaling. Amino acid sequence analysis revealed that ATM contained consensus sequences phosphorylated by AMPK and Akt. Other evidence of a role for ATM in non-damage signaling has been provided (35Yang D.Q. Kastan M.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 893-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) where insulin activated ATM kinase to phosphorylate 4E-BPI (PHAS-1), a regulator of protein synthesis. The results described here are pertinent to that report (Ref. 35Yang D.Q. Kastan M.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 893-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) in that we have demonstrated that insulin treatment activates Akt, which in turn activates ARK5, and this may lead to activation of ATM, which we also showed is a downstream effector of ARK5 under conditions of glucose starvation. The activation of ATM through this pathway would add an additional pathway to the scheme proposed after insulin treatment (21Lavin M.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 215-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In the current study, we identified ARK5 as a novel member of the AMPK family. ARK5 activation is regulated by Akt, and activated ARK5, in turn, phosphorylated ATM during glucose starvation. Because phosphorylated ATM induces cell cycle arrest at the G1phase via p53 phosphorylation and accumulation (23Banin S. Moyal L. Shieh S. Taya Y. Anderson C.W. Chessa L. Smorodinsky N.I. Prives C.

Ogura T. Kishimoto A. Kaminishi M. Esumi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 562-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). ARK5 mRNA expression in human normal tissue was observed in the heart, brain, skeletal muscle, kidney, and ovary, but not in the liver, pancreas, lung and intestine (official data of KIAA0537 on the KAZUSA DNA Research Institute homepage); however, protein and mRNA expression of ARK5 was observed in some tumor cell lines derived from hepatoma and pancreatic cancer, suggesting a possible involvement of ARK5 in tumorigenesis. On the basis of our current results, we propose here that ARK5 plays a key role in the tumor tolerance to nutrient starvation related to tumor malignancy. Therefore, ARK5 is a new target for cancer therapy. We thank KAZUSA DNA Research Institute for KIAA0537 cDNA clone (GenBankTM accession numberAB011109)."

Increasing evidence indicates that tumor cells in regions exposed to sublethal doses of PDT can respond by rescue responses that lead to insufficient cell death. We decided to examine the role of superoxide dismutases (SODs) in the effectiveness of PDT and to investigate whether 2-methoxyestradiol (2-MeOE2), an inhibitor of SODs, is capable of potentiating the antitumor effects of this treatment regimen. In the initial experiment we observed that PDT induced the expression of MnSOD but not Cu,Zn-SOD in cancer cells. Pretreatment of cancer cells with a cell-permeable SOD mimetic, Mn(II)-tetrakis(4-benzoic acid)porphyrin chloride, and transient transfection with the MnSOD gene resulted in a decreased effectiveness of PDT. Inhibition of SOD activity in tumor cells by preincubation with 2-MeOE2 produced synergistic antitumor effects when combined with PDT in 3 murine and 5 human tumor cell lines. The combination treatment was also effective in vivo producing retardation of the tumor growth and prolongation of the survival of tumor-bearing mice. We conclude that inhibition of MnSOD activity by 2-MeOE2 is an effective treatment modality capable of potentiating the antitumor effectiveness of PDT.

Moreover, numerous clinical trials investigate the effectiveness of PDT in the treatment of gastric, colon, bile duct, pancreatic, breast, and other cancers (2Bown S.G. Rogowska A.Z. Whitelaw D.E.

The treatment consists of a systemic administration of a photosensitizer followed by illumination with a laser light. Neither of the PDT components alone can induce antitumor effects but when combined with oxygen they produce lethal cytotoxic agents that can either directly kill tumor cells or destroy blood vessels within the tumor (1Dougherty T.J. Gomer C.J. Henderson B.W. Jori G. Kessel D. Korbelik M. Moan J. Peng Q. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1998; 90: 889-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (4641) Google Scholar). The photochemical reaction produces singlet oxygen (1O2) as well as numerous forms of reactive oxygen, such as superoxide ion (O2⨪), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and hydroxyl radical (OH⋅) (10Sharman W.M. Allen C.M. van Lier J.E. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 319: 376-400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Increasing evidence indicates that tumor cells can respond to photodynamic damage by either initiating a rescue response or by undergoing cell death by apoptosis or necrosis (11Moor A.C. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B Biol. 2000; 57: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Rescue response to sublethal changes allows tumor cells to cope with the damage induced by the physicochemical stress. This effect is particularly important in deeper layers of the tumor exposed to laser illumination. Because the light penetration is limited by the absorption, scattering, and reflection characteristics of the tissues the effective dose of energy reaching the deeper layers of the tumor might cause insufficient damage allowing the initiation of the rescue response (12MacDonald I.J. Dougherty T.J. J. Porphyrins Phthalocyanines. 2001; 5: 105-129Crossref Scopus (1273) Google Scholar). The surviving cells might be the cause of relapse rendering the treatment less effective. Therefore, elucidation of molecular changes in the treated cells as well as identification of drugs that might interfere with rescue responses becomes an important area of investigation. Although singlet oxygen has been demonstrated to play a dominant role in the cytotoxic effects invoked by the photodynamic therapy (13Weishaupt K.R. Gomer C.J. Dougherty T.J. Cancer Res. 1976; 36: 2326-2329PubMed Google Scholar) there are also a number of observations implicating superoxide anion in phototoxicity. Superoxide generation increases severalfold after illumination of PhotofrinTM-bearing cells (14Salet C. Moreno G. Ricchelli F. Free Radical Res. 1997; 26: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and O2⨪ exerts multiple deleterious effects such as lipid peroxidation, DNA cross-linking, and formation of disulfide bonds in proteins (15Martinez-Cayuela M. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1995; 77: 147-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Intracellular O2⨪ production correlates with cell death in 5-aminolevulinic acid- and zinc(II) phthalocyanine-mediated PDT (16Gilaberte Y. Pereboom D. Carapeto F.J. Alda J.O. Photodermatol. Photoimmunol. Photomed. 1997; 13: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 17Hadjur C. Wagnieres G. Ihringer F. Monnier P. van den Bergh H. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B Biol. 1997; 38: 196-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Cells scavenge O2⨪ with the help of a constitutive Cu,Zn-SOD (SOD-1) as well as an inducible MnSOD (SOD-2) (18McCord J.M. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 349: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The latter is associated with the mitochondrial matrix and participates in dismutating superoxide anion from the site of PhotofrinTM-mediated generation of reactive oxygen species during photodynamic therapy (19Morgan J. Potter W.R. Oseroff A.R. Photochem. Photobiol. 2000; 71: 747-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Mice treated with a SOD mimetic, β-carotene, had considerably less ear swelling following PhotofrinTM-mediated PDT (20Athar M. Mukhtar H. Elmets C.A. Zaim M.T. Lloyd J.R. Bickers D.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 151: 1054-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and intravenous administration of bacterial SOD decreased, to a significant extent, the antitumor efficacy of PhotofrinTM mediated PDT in three different murine tumor models (21Korbelik M. Parkins C.S. Shibuya H. Cecic I. Stratford M.R. Chaplin D.J. Br. J. Cancer. 2000; 82: 1835-1843Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Accordingly, sodium diethyldithiocarbamate, a SOD inhibitor augments cutaneous photosensitization (20Athar M. Mukhtar H. Elmets C.A. Zaim M.T. Lloyd J.R. Bickers D.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 151: 1054-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Intuitively, combinations of SOD inhibitor with treatment modalities that produce free radicals might result in synergistic anticancer activity. All these observations prompted us to evaluate the role of superoxide dismutases in the antitumor effectiveness of PDT and to investigate whether 2-MeOE2, an estrogen metabolite that has recently been shown to inhibit SOD activity (22Huang P. Feng L. Oldham E.A. Keating M.J. Plunkett W. Nature. 2000; 407: 390-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar), would be capable of potentiating the antitumor effects of this treatment regimen. (C57BL/6 × DBA/2)F1 mice, hereafter called B6D2F1, and Balb/c mice, 8–12 weeks of age, were used in the experiments. Breeding pairs were obtained from the Inbred Mice Breeding Center of the Institute of Immunology and Experimental Medicine (Wroclaw, Poland) and from the Institute of Oncology (Warsaw, Poland). All experiments with animals were performed in accordance with the guidelines approved by the Ethical Committee of the Medical University of Warsaw. PhotofrinTM was a generous gift of QLT PhotoTherapeutics, Inc. (Vancouver, BC, Canada). Manganese-containing SOD from Escherichia coli, 2-MeOE1, and 2-MeOE2 were purchased from Sigma. Mn(II)-tetrakis(4-benzoic acid)porphyrin chloride (MnTBAP) was purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Human pancreatic cancer (Panc-1, HPAC-I, and HPAF-II), breast cancer (T47-D), and bladder cancer (T24) cell lines were purchased from ATCC. Murine colon-26 (C-26), a poorly differentiated colon adenocarcinoma cell line, and Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells were obtained from Prof. C. Radzikowski (Institute of Immunology and Experimental Medicine, Wroclaw, Poland) and Prof. W. W. Jedrzejczak (Department of Immunology, Central Clinical Hospital, Military School of Medicine, Warsaw, Poland), respectively. Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, antibiotics, 2-mercaptoethanol (50 μm), and l-glutamine (2 mm) (all from Invitrogen), hereafter referred to as culture medium. The SOD activity was measured using a Ransod assay kit purchased from Randox Laboratories Ltd. (Antrim, United Kingdom) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The SOD inhibitory activity of 2-MeOE1 or 2-MeOE2was measured using a manganese-containing SOD. For the measurements of SOD activity in tumor cells extracts, colon-26 cells were scraped using a rubber policeman, washed twice in cold PBS, and resuspended in 0.01m sodium phosphate buffer with 1% Triton X-100. After a freeze-thaw cycle the cells were homogenized, the extracts were preincubated with Me2SO (controls) or 2-MeOE2for 15 min, and the enzymatic activity of SOD was measured using a Ransod assay kit. In some experiments colon-26 cells were preincubated with either Me2SO (controls) or 2-MeOE2 added to the cell cultures for 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h. The SOD activity was measured directly from the cell homogenates. For Western blotting C-26 cells were cultured with 2.5 μg/ml PhotofrinTM for 24 h before illumination. After washing with PBS, the cells were illuminated using a 50-watt sodium lamp (Phillips) with light filtered through a red filter to a final dose of 4.5 kJ/m2. After 1, 2, 4, 12, or 24 h of culture in the fresh medium the cells were washed with PBS and lysed in a sample buffer containing 2% SDS with protease inhibitors. Protein concentration was measured with the use of BCA protein assay (Pierce). Equal amounts of proteins were separated on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and blocked with TBST (Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 0.05% Tween 20) with 5% nonfat milk and 5% fetal bovine serum. The following primary antibodies were used for the 6-h incubation: mouse monoclonal anti-β-tubulin at 1:10000 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), rabbit polyclonal anti-SOD-1 at 1:1000 (Santa Cruz) and rabbit polyclonal anti-MnSOD at 1:1000 (Research and Diagnostics, Flanders, NJ). After extensive washing the membranes were incubated for 45 min with the corresponding alkaline phosphatase-coupled secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Inc., West Grove, PA). The color reaction was developed using p-nitro blue tetrazolium chloride and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Sigma). Four hours after in vitroPDT (2.5 μg/ml PhotofrinTM and 4.5 J/m2light), colon-26 cells were fixed in situ in culture dishes, in a mixture of 4% paraformaldehyde plus 0.1% glutaraldehyde for 1 h at room temperature, scraped, suspended in 10% liquified gelatin, and pelleted at 1000 rpm at 4 °C. The pellets were cut into smaller fragments, washed in PBS, cryo-protected in 2.3 msucrose (overnight at 4 °C), snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C until use. Cryo sections (0.5 μm thick) were cut in a cryo-ultramicrotome (MT-X model with CR-X cryosectioning system, RMC Boeckeler Instruments, Tucson, AZ) at −60 °C, collected on glass slides using a drop-of-sucrose technique (according to Ref. 48), washed in distilled water, equilibrated in PBS, and processed immediately for immunocytochemistry. The immunocytochemical procedure included overnight incubation (at 4 °C) in a solution of anti-MnSOD primary antibody (Research and Diagnostics) diluted 1:200 in 5% normal goat serum, followed by a standard avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase reaction, with diaminobenzidine (Sigma) as a chromogen. Omission of the primary antibody or its replacement by an irrelevant antibody served as controls of antibody specificity. Phase-contrast images of the specimens were recorded using Axioplan microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) coupled to a CCD camera, and image analysis software (Analysis, Soft Imaging System, Münster, Germany). For the transfection experiments the pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) plasmids containing Cu,Zn-SOD (from Dr. L. W. Oberley, Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Iowa) (23Zhang Y. Zhao W. Zhang H.J. Domann F.E. Oberley L.W. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1205-1212PubMed Google Scholar) and MnSOD (from Dr. K. Scharffetter-Kochanek, Department of Dermatology, University of Cologne, Germany) (24Wenk J. Brenneisen P. Wlaschek M. Poswig A. Briviba K. Oberley T.D. Scharffetter-Kochanek K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25869-25876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) were used. T24 cells were seeded at 8 × 105 cells/35-mm dish and incubated overnight at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Subconfluent proliferating cultures were incubated overnight with 5 μg of each vector in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing LipofectAMINETM 2000 (Invitrogen). Cultures were washed with PBS to remove the excess vector and LipofectAMINETM and then incubated again for 24 h in fresh complete culture medium containing PhotofrinTM (2.5 μg/ml). Immediately after illumination with 4.5 kJ/m2light the cells were trypsinized and dispensed into the wells of the 96-well flat-bottomed microtiter plate (Nunc) at concentrations of 8, 16, or 32 × 104 cells/200 μl/well. Similarly, T24 cells transiently transfected with each of the plasmid vectors (Cu,Zn-SOD, MnSOD, or pcDNA3) and not exposed to PDT were trypsinized and dispensed into the wells at the same concentrations as PDT-treated cells. Following 24 h incubation the cultures were rinsed with PBS and stained with 0.5% crystal violet in 30% ethanol for 10 min at room temperature. Plates were washed four times with tap water. Cells were lysed with 1% SDS solution, and dye uptake was measured at 550 nm using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader (SLT Labinstrument GmbH, Salzburg, Austria), equipped with a 550-nm filter. Cytotoxicity was expressed as relative viability of tumor cells (% of control cultures transiently transfected with corresponding plasmid vector) and was calculated as follows: cytotoxicity = (A PDT − A b) × 100/(A c − A b), whereA b is background absorbance,A PDT is absorbance of cells exposed to PDT, andA c is the absorbance of transfected controls. The cytostatic and/or cytotoxic effects of treatment on tumor cells were measured using crystal violet staining as described above or a standard 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, as described previously (25Golab J. Zagozdzon R. Kaminski R. Kozar K. Gryska K. Izycki D. Mackiewicz A. Stoklosa T. Giermasz A. Lasek W. Jakobisiak M. Leukemia. 2001; 15: 613-620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were dispensed into a 96-well flat-bottomed microtiter plate (Nunc) at a concentration of 5–10 × 104 cells/100 μl/well. Cells were treated with serial dilutions of 2-MeOE1 or 2-MeOE2 or with a control Me2SO-containing medium (to a final volume of 200 μl) 2 h after plating. After 24 h the medium was completely removed and replaced with fresh 2-MeOE1 or 2-MeOE2 or a Me2SO-containing medium in a volume of 100 μl. Then, 100 μl of culture medium with PhotofrinTM (2.5 μg/ml final concentration) was added to each well. Following 24 h of incubation with the photosensitizer the cells in each well were exposed to a laser light delivered through the fiber optic light delivery system. The illumination area was exactly matching the size of the wells. In some experiments the cells were preincubated with MnTBAP (100 μm) for 2 h before laser illumination. After another 24 h 25 μl of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide was added to each well for the last 4 h of incubation. The plates were read in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader (SLT Labinstrument GmbH, Salzburg, Austria), using a 450-nm filter. In all experiments a cytostatic/cytotoxic effect was expressed as relative viability of tumor cells (% of control cultures incubated with medium only) and was calculated as follows: relative viability = (A e − A b) × 100/(A c − A b), whereA b is background absorbance,A e is experimental absorbance, andA c is the absorbance of untreated controls. For the examination of the interactions between PDT and 2-MeOE2, an ISOBOLOGRAM analysis was used as described in detail elsewhere (26Berenbaum M.C. Adv. Cancer Res. 1981; 35: 269-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Briefly, inhibition of cell proliferation was determined as described in the above section. For analysis of the interactions equi-effective doses were used. These were the doses of either treatment alone or used in a combination that produced equivalent inhibition of cell growth in comparison with controls (p < 0.005; Student'st test). Combinations of the treatments had to induce growth inhibition higher than those of the same doses used alone (p < 0.001; Student's t test). The interaction index for two-treatment combinations was computed according to the following formula: interaction index = (P c/P a) + (M c/M a), whereP a and M a are doses of PDT and 2-MeOE2, respectively, that produce a specified effect when used alone; P c and M c are doses of PDT and 2-MeOE2, respectively, that produce the same effect when used in combination. Synergy is claimed when the interaction index is <1.0. For in vivoexperiments exponentially growing tumor cells were harvested, resuspended in PBS medium to an appropriate concentration of cells, and injected (1 × 105 C-26 cells or 5 × 105 3LL cells in 20 μl of PBS) into the footpad of the right hind limb of experimental mice. Tumor cell viability measured by trypan exclusion was always above 95%. Tumor-bearing mice were treated orally with 2-MeOE2 at a dose of 100 mg/kg dissolved in Me2SO and suspended in olive oil. The treatment with 2-MeOE2 started on day 3 following inoculation of tumor cells and continued for 6 consecutive days. Mice in the control groups received oral Me2SO in olive oil in the same regimen as the treated mice. PhotofrinTM was administered intraperitoneally at a dose of 10 mg/kg 24 h before illumination with 630 nm light (day 5 of 2-MeOE2 administration, day 7 of the experiment). Control mice received 5% dextrose. The light source was a He-Ne ion laser (Amber, Warsaw, Poland). The light was delivered on day 8 of the experiment using a fiber optic light delivery system. The power density at the illumination area, which encompassed the tumor and 1–1.5 mm of the surrounding skin, was ∼80 mW/cm2 (40 mW laser output). The total light dose delivered to the tumors was 150 J/cm2. During light treatment mice were anesthetized with ketamine (87 mg/kg) and xylazine (13 mg/kg) and restrained in a specially designed holder. Local tumor growth was determined as described (27Golab J. Wilczynski G. Zagozdzon R. Stoklosa T. Dabrowska A. Rybczynska J. Wasik M. Machaj E. Olda T. Kozar K. Kaminski R. Giermasz A. Czajka A.

Relative tumor volume was calculated as: relative tumor volume = [(tumor volume) ÷ (initial tumor volume)] × 100%. Data were calculated using MicrosoftTM Excel 98. Differences in in vitrocytotoxicity assays and tumor volume were analyzed for significance by Student's t test. Additionally, data were analyzed with the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test (InstatTM, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Kaplan-Meier plots were generated using days of animal death (after inoculation of tumor cells) as a criterion, and survival time of animals was analyzed for significance by log-rank survival analysis. Significance was defined as a two-sided p < 0.05. It has previously been demonstrated using Northern blotting that PDT induces the expression of the SOD gene (28Das H. Koizumi T. Sugimoto T. Yamaguchi S. Hasegawa K. Tenjin Y. Nishimura R. Int. J. Clin. Oncol. 2000; 5: 97-103Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, it was not investigated whether increased RNA levels correlate with the expression of SOD at the protein level. Therefore, we have initially investigated whether and to what extent PDT influences the level of Cu,Zn-SOD and MnSOD proteins using Western blotting. C-26 cells were exposed to 2.5 μg/ml PhotofrinTM and after 24 h of incubation with the photosensitizer the cells were washed with PBS and illuminated with a sublethal light dose of 4.5 kJ/m2. Although, there was no influence of PDT on the expression of Cu,Zn-SOD, we have observed a time-dependent increase in the level of MnSOD (Fig. 1 A). Immunocytochemical staining of tumor cells exposed to PDT revealed that MnSOD expression was detectable in surviving but not in lethally damaged cells (Fig. 1,B1 and B2). To determine the role of SOD in the antitumor effectiveness of PDT, C-26 and T24 cells were preincubated with MnTBAP, a cell permeable SOD mimetic, and then exposed to laser illumination. Remarkably, the antitumor efficacy of the PDT was significantly reduced (Fig. 2, A and B). Because these studies did not reveal which of the SOD isoforms might be responsible for the protective effects, T24 cells have been transiently transfected with Cu,Zn-SOD, MnSOD, or an empty control (pcDNA3) vector. Exposure of pcDNA3- or Cu,Zn-SOD-transfected cells to PDT resulted in a comparable cytotoxicity (Fig. 2 C). However, T24 cells transiently transfected with a MnSOD containing plasmid were significantly less susceptible to the antitumor effects of PDT (Fig. 2 C). We have observed that 2-MeOE2, but not 2-MeOE1, another estrogen metabolite, significantly suppresses the activity of manganese-containing SOD from E. coli (TableI). Additional experiments were done to determine the potential suppressive effects of 2-MeOE2 on the SOD activity in colon-26 cells. These studies demonstrated that 2-MeOE2 indeed effectively inhibits in a dose-dependent manner the SOD activity in extracts from colon-26 cells (Table II). Moreover, preincubation of colon-26 cells with 2-MeOE2 revealed a time-dependent inhibition of SOD activity in tumor cells (Table III). These studies confirmed that 2-MeOE2 can effectively enter the tumor cells and inhibit SOD activity.Table IThe influence of 2-MeOE2 or 2-MeOE1 on the activity of manganese containing SODMeasured SOD activity (units/ml)2-MeOE101 μm10 μm50 μmSOD (units/ml) 100137.0 ± 2.0138.0 ± 2.8133.0 ± 3.8140.0 ± 0.0 200205.2 ± 13.1210.9 ± 27.1194.0 ± 8.5202.0 ± 2.82-MeOE201 μm10 μm50 μmSOD (units/ml) 10098.0 ± 8.5110.0 ± 0.092.0 ± 0.066.0 ± 5.7 200200.0 ± 0.0184.0 ± 22.6152.0 ± 0.0148.0 ± 5.6Manganese containing SOD from E. coli (100 or 200 units/ml) was preincubated with either 2-MeOE1 or 2-MeOE2 (at concentrations of 1, 10, and 50 μm) for 15 min at 37 °C.

After one freeze-thaw cycle the cells were homogenized and the SOD activity was measured in samples. Because 2-MeOE2 has been shown to inhibit SOD activity in tumor cells we decided to examine the influence of this agent on the antitumor activity of PDT in vitro. The experiments performed in three murine cell lines (C-26, LLC, and MDC) revealed that 2-MeOE2 potentiates the cytotoxic effects of sublethal doses of PDT (Fig. 3). According to Berenbaum analysis the interactions between 2-MeOE2 and PDT in all cell lines were synergistic. Moreover, the antitumor effects of the 2-MeOE2 + PDT combination were examined in 5 human tumor cell lines of breast (T47-D), pancreatic (PANC-1, HPAF-II, and HPAC), and bladder (T24) origin. In all these cell lines there was also a synergistic potentiation of the antitumor effects of PDT by 2-MeOE2(Fig. 3). Of note, 2-MeOE1 another estrogen derivative devoid of SOD inhibitory activity did not influence the antitumor effects of PDT in two murine (C-26 and LLC) and one human (T47-D) cancer cell lines (Fig. 4).Figure 4The antitumor effects of PDT are not potentiated by 2-MeOE1.

Chymotrypsin-like activity was more affected by GSH than trypsin-like activity, whereas the peptidylglutamyl-hydrolyzing activity (caspase-like) was not inhibited by GSH. Cys-sulfenic acid formation in the 20 S core was demonstrated by spectral characterization of the Cys-S(O)-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole adduct, indicating that 20 S proteasome Cys residues might react with reduced sulfhydryls (GSH, Cys, and γ-glutamylcysteine) through the oxidized Cys-sulfenic acid form.

In vivo experiments revealed that 20 S proteasome extracted from H2O2-treated cells showed decreased chymotrypsin-like activity accompanied byS-glutathionylation as demonstrated by GSH release from the 20 S core after reduction with NaBH4.

Protein S-glutathionylation seems to play an essential role in redox regulation. This form of regulation has direct effects on both enzyme activity and the ability of transcription and replication factors to bind DNA targets. The mechanism of protein glutathionylation has evolved in recent years from the strict belief that this event would take place solely when intracellular GSSG1 levels increased upon oxidative stress, with the formation of mixed disulfides between protein Cys-SH residues and GSSG (7Gilbert H.F.

Biophys. 2001; 389: 254-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) it was demonstrated that the reduced and oxidized forms of GSH modulate the chymotrypsin-like activity of purified 20 S proteasome extracted from mammalian cells. In the present report we show that the activity of the 20 S proteasome purified from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is also sensitive to GSH, though in a different way from that observed in the mammalian proteasome. The 20 S proteasome extracted from yeast is inhibited by reduced GSH and S-glutathionylated in vitro, as well as in vivo, when cells are submitted to oxidative challenge. Considering that the proteasome plays important role in cell signaling regulation by hydrolysis of many proteins involved in cascade events of the cellular regulatory pathways, it is not surprising that its activity may be regulated by its Cys-SH residues redox status.

Cells were cultured in YPD medium (2% glucose, 2% peptone, and 1% yeast extract) or as otherwise specified at 30 °C with reciprocal shaking. Log phase cells were harvested at the optical density of the culture at 600 nm (A 600) of 0.6–0.8. Stationary phase cells were harvested at A 600 higher than 1.5.

The 20 S proteasome from untagged strain was purified by sequential chromatographs on DEAE-Sepharose, SephacrylTM S-400 column (Amersham Biosciences), and a monoQ column in an HPLC system. The purification was performed according to a method described previously (17Hough R. Pratt G. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol.

The 20 S proteasome core from the RJD1144 strain with a FLAGHis6-tagged PRE1 subunit was purified by affinity chromatography or, when specified, by immunoprecipitation. Affinity chromatography was performed using a HiTrapTM chelating HP column (Amersham Biosciences) attached to a P1 peristaltic pump (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The proteasome was eluted from the column with 300 mm imidazole. Active fractions from all steps of all preparations were assayed by the degradation of the fluorogenic peptide s-LLVY-MCA and confirmed by inhibition with tri-leucine vinyl sulfone.

The results shown below (in vivo and in vitro) refer to the preparations obtained from strains containing FLAGHis6-tagged PRE1; however, we did not observe any difference compared with preparations from strains containing untagged PRE1 (data not shown). 20 S proteasome (0.5–3 μg) or cell extracts (400–500 μg protein/ml) were incubated at 37 °C in 10 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.8, containing 20 mm KCl and 5 mmMgCl2, here referred to as standard buffer. Incubation was started by the addition of 25–50 μm of the peptides (other additions are specified in the legends to the figures). The reaction was stopped by adding 4 volumes of 0.1 m sodium borate, pH 9, containing 7.5% ethanol. Fluorescence emission was recorded at 430 nm (excitation at 365 nm). MCA liberated from the substrates was calculated from a standard curve of free MCA. When specified, purified 20 S proteasome preparations were treated with H2O2. Proteasome concentration in these experiments was typically 50 μg or as otherwise specified, and the preparation was incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the presence of 5 mmH2O2 with or without 100 μm DTPA in standard buffer. After incubation, excess H2O2 was removed by three cycles of centrifugation and redilution with standard buffer through Microcon CM-10 filters (Amicon). Aliquots of the 20 S proteasome were taken for further incubation or for hydrolysis assay after determination of protein concentration. After isolation of the 20 S core with the anti-FLAG antibody, as described above, the agarose beads were washed three times according to the manufacturer's protocol. NaBH4 reduction was performed with the 20 S proteasome bound to the anti-FLAG-agarose bead complex incubated in the presence of 20 mm NaBH4buffered in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.6, for 40 min at 37 °C. After incubation, the suspension was centrifuged, the supernatant was utilized for GSH determination (described below), and the beads were washed twice with standard buffer. The proteolysis assay, when specified, was performed with the 20 S proteasome still bound to the beads. Intracellular GSH was extracted by lysing the cell pellets in 1 volume of glass beads and 2 volumes of 3.5% sulfosalicylic acid. The suspension was vortexed for 20 min at 4 °C in a multifold vortex and centrifuged at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge. This procedure was repeated twice, and the supernatants were combined. Total GSH, as well as GSSG, was assayed according to a protocol described previously (15Demasi M. Shringarpure R. Davies K.J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 389: 254-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The determination was performed by reaction with DTNB in the presence of glutathione reductase and NADPH. Samples for GSSG measurement were incubated previously for 1 h with NEM after adjusting the pH to 7. GSH released from 20 S proteasome was detected as follows: 20 S proteasome isolated by immunoprecipitation was reacted with NaBH4 as described above. The supernatant recovered was filtered through a Microcon CM-10 filter. The filtrate was acidified to remove remaining NaBH4 (reaction with NaBH4 was performed at pH 8.6), and the pH was adjusted to 7 prior to the addition of DTNB, glutathione reductase, and NADPH. GSH detection was increased in the presence of glutathione reductase and NADPH comparing to detection in the presence of DTNB only. GSH concentration was calculated from standard curves of GSSG. Intracellular reduced GSH was determined by the difference between total GSH and GSSG. GSH-biotin derivative was achieved as described in Ref. 18Sullivan D.M. Wehr N.B. Fergusson M.M. Levine R.L. Finkel T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11121-11128Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar. GSH was reacted with sulfo-NHS-biotin (EZ-LinkTM NHS-LC-Biotin; Pierce) at 1/1 molar ratio in 50 mm NaHCO3, pH 8.5, for 1 h at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 5× excess NH4CO3 compared with initial biotin concentration. H2O2-treated or untreated 20 S proteasome (450 μg) was incubated with 5 mm GSH-biotin for 20 min at room temperature. Excess GSH-biotin was removed by filtration through a Microcon CM-10 filter followed by redilution three times in standard buffer. After washing, protein was diluted in standard buffer, mixed with streptavidin-agarose beads (100 μl/mg protein), and incubated for 60 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed by four cycles of centrifugation/redilution in standard buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, and the remaining protein was eluted from the beads by incubation for 30 min in standard buffer containing 0.1% SDS and 10 mm DTT, followed by centrifugation at maximum speed for 15 min. The supernatants were submitted to 12.5% SDS-PAGE after determination of protein concentration. Aliquots of the cell suspension were diluted to an A 600 of 0.2 immediately after the treatments, followed by a further 5,000× redilution. Aliquots of 100 μl of the final suspension were spread on YPD-agar plates (five per sample) and incubated at 30 °C for 48 h. After incubation, colonies were counted manually. Cell viability assays were repeated at least five times. Carbonyl group formation in the proteins was determined by derivatization with dinitrophenylhydrazine and quantified by spectrophotometry as described in Ref. 19Levine R.L. Williams J.A. Stadtman E.R. Shacter E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 346-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2283) Google Scholar. Protein concentration was determined with Bradford® reagent (Bio-Rad). Purified 20 S proteasome core isolated from S. cerevisiae was assayed for hydrolysis with the s-LLVY-MCA substrate in the presence of GSH, GSSG, and Cys (Fig. 1). GSSG had a slight effect on 20 S proteasomal activity at any concentration tested. However, GSH or Cys strongly inhibited the proteasomal activity at 5 mmconcentration. The GSH precursor GC also inhibited chymotrypsin-like activity in a pattern similar to that obtained by Cys treatment (results not shown). The trypsin-like activity determined by the hydrolysis of the fluorogenic substratet-butoxycarbonyl-Leu-Lys-Arg-MCA was 50% decreased in the presence of 10 mm GSH (results not shown). The trypsin-like specific activity (μmol MCA/min/mg) represented less than 5% of the chymotrypsin-like activity measured under the experimental conditions described here (the same protocols were used for both determinations). The peptidylglutamyl-hydrolizing activity assayed by the hydrolysis of the fluorogenic peptide carbobenzoxy-Leu-Leu-Glu-MCA was not affected by any of the sulfhydryl compounds tested (GSH, GC, or Cys) at any concentration or by GSSG (result not shown). One question raised by these results was how the reduced form of GSH and other thiols tested (Cys and GC), but not GSSG, inhibited 20 S proteasomal activity. Our working hypothesis was that Cys-SH residues in the 20 S proteasome structure are probably oxidized to the Cys-SOH form, susceptible to S-glutathionylation by GSH, as described elsewhere (6Claiborne A. Mallett T.C. Yeh J.I. Luba J. Parsonage D. Adv. Prot. Chem. 2001; 58: 215-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 20Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4244-5250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but not by GSSG, according to the reaction,GSH+proteasome−S−OH→proteasome−SSG+H2OTo test this hypothesis, purified 20 S proteasome preparations were incubated in the presence of 5 mmH2O2 and 100 μm DTPA. The iron chelator DTPA was used to prevent the Fenton reaction and consequently the generation of the very reactive hydroxyl radical, which may produce nonspecific protein oxidation, in addition to iron-catalyzed thiol oxidation and generation of several protein-sulfur derivatives (21Netto L.E.S. Stadtman E.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 333: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Thus, in the absence of iron or another transition metal, sulfhydryl oxidation to Cys-SOH may prevail, though further oxidation of Cys-SOH to Cys-SO2H and Cys-SO3H is expected (11Yang K.S. Kang S.W. Woo H.A. Hwang S.C. Chae H.Z. Kim K. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38029-38036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). According to our results, 20 S proteasome treatment with H2O2 in the presence of DTPA decreased chymotrypsin-like activity to 80% of the original level (Fig. 2 A), whereas when H2O2 treatment was performed in the absence of DTPA the activity was reduced to 60% (data not shown). When 20 S proteasome was pretreated with H2O2 plus DTPA the chymotrypsin-like activity was much more affected by GSH (Fig. 2 A). In fact, after H2O2/DTPA pretreatment, inhibition by GSH occurred at concentrations as low as 0.01 mm (35% inhibition), and GSH at 1 mmpromoted stronger inhibition (60%; see Fig. 2 A) than that verified without pretreatment (Fig. 1). In contrast, GSSG did not affect 20 S proteasome activity (Fig. 2 A). These results are in agreement with our hypothesis in the reaction shown above. In contrast to H2O2, DTT treatment enhanced proteasomal activity by about 15–20% (Fig. 2 B). Moreover, it sensitized the proteasome to GSH incorporation after H2O2 treatment. When 20 S proteasome samples were treated with 10 mm DTT, followed by incubation with H2O2/DTPA, the chymotrypsin-like activity was even more sensitive to GSH when compared with samples not preincubated with DTT (Fig. 2 A). In this condition, proteasomal activity was decreased to 50 and 5% in the presence of 0.5 or 1 mmGSH, respectively (Fig. 2 B), whereas when the same GSH concentrations were employed without DTT pretreatment, chymotrypsin-like activity was decreased only to 60 and 40%, respectively (Fig. 2 A). Cys-SOH already present in 20 S proteasome was probably reduced to Cys-SH by DTT, with the consequent prevention of hyperoxidation of Cys-SOH to Cys-SO2H or Cys-SO3H by H2O2 treatment. As expected according to our hypothesis described in the reaction shown above, when the 20 S core was pretreated only with DTT, no alteration by GSH was observed in its activity (Fig. 2 B). Also, proteasome reduced by DTT was not inhibited by GSSG (result not shown) as could be expected, because GSSG is able to react with sulfhydryl groups to form mixed disulfides (7Gilbert H.F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 8-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 8Thomas J.A. Poland B. Honzatko R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Reduced Cys-20 S might be prevented from reacting with GSSG by structural constraints imposed by nearby groups. To demonstrate that modification of Cys-20 S core residues is responsible for the inhibition of chymotrypsin-like activity, we next tested this activity in the presence of Cys-SH and Cys-SOH reactants, such as NBD, dimedone, and NEM (Table I). We observed that chymotrypsin-like activity was inhibited 40 and 30% by 50 μm NBD and 1 mm NEM, respectively. NEM alkylates Cys-SH whereas NBD is incorporated into both Cys-SH and Cys-SOH. This might be, at least in part, the reason why NBD is more potent than NEM in terms of chymotrypsin-like activity inhibition. After inhibition by NBD, 20 S proteasomal activity was recovered by incubation with 5 mm DTT (result not shown). Because DTT treatment leads to NBD release (9Ellis H.R. Poole L.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15013-15018Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), this result indicates that inhibition was promoted by Cys conjugation.Table IEffect of Cys-SH and Cys-SOH reactants on proteasomal activityProteasome incubationMCA releaseμmol × min −1 × mg −1Control (no addition)25.4 ± 1.4H2O2/DTPA-treated samples20.3 ± 1.51-ap ≤ 0.0001 (ANOVA).

The s-LLVY-MCA hydrolysis assay is described under “Materials and Methods.” Results are means ± S.D. of three independent experiments. The specific Cys-SOH reagent dimedone (9Ellis H.R. Poole L.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15013-15018Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) produced low inhibition when compared with the former reagents. Dimedone promoted 23% inhibition only at 10 mm concentration. On the other hand, when purified 20 S proteasome preparations were pretreated with H2O2/DTPA prior to incubation with dimedone, we observed increased proteolytic inhibition compared with the inhibition observed in the absence of H2O2/DTPA pretreatment followed by dimedone incubation (results shown initalics in Table I). Upon H2O2pretreatment, 10 mm dimedone decreased chymotrypsin-like activity to 50% of that observed in H2O2control samples. Taken together, the results reported thus far indicate that any group located in Cys residues of the 20 S core decreases its hydrolytic activity, at least the chymotrypsin-like activity, which is considered the strongest of its activities (1Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar). It seems that Cys residues in the 20 S proteasome must be reduced as much as possible to allow maximum activity. Nevertheless, these residues appear to oxidize easily to Cys-SOH. To demonstrate that Cys residues in the 20 S proteasome structure are oxidized to Cys-SOH, 20 S proteasome preparations were incubated with NBD. This compound reacts with Cys-SH, as well as with Cys-SOH. NBD adducts of Cys-SOH and Cys-SH can be distinguished by their spectra (9Ellis H.R. Poole L.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15013-15018Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The proteasome-Cys-S(O)-NBD adduct was generated by 20 S proteasome pretreatment with H2O2/DTPA followed by NBD incubation (Fig. 3,dashed line spectrum). This adduct showed maximum absorbance at 345 nm whereas the purified 20 S core not oxidized by H2O2 yielded the NBD adduct with a maximum absorbance at 420 nm (Fig. 3, solid line spectrum). We also reacted denatured 20 S proteasome preparations with the –SH reactant mBrB (22Kosower E.M. Kosower N.S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 133-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Denatured 20 S proteasome samples were preincubated with DTT or GSH. After incubation, DTT and GSH were removed, and the samples were treated overnight with 150 μm mBrB. Proteasome-Cys-bimane conjugates were detected by fluorescence emission recorded after removal of mBrB. DTT-reduced samples showed fluorescence emission at least twice as high as control samples, whereas GSH-treated samples showed reduced fluorescence, probably because 20 S proteasome mixed disulfides could not conjugate with mBrB (Fig. 4). This result indicates that GSH does not play the role of a reducing compound as DTT, but probably GSH was incorporated into the protein structure byS-conjugation. To demonstrate effectively that the effect of GSH on proteasomal activity is because of S-glutathionylation, 20 S proteasome preparations were incubated with the GSH-biotin derivative according to the protocol described in the literature (18Sullivan D.M. Wehr N.B. Fergusson M.M. Levine R.L. Finkel T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11121-11128Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). This method allows the direct determination of protein S-glutathionylation, because biotinylated GSH-proteasome complexes can be isolated by the streptavidin affinity procedure. 20 S proteasome pretreatment with H2O2 increased GSH incorporation (Fig. 5). The protein concentration determined after protein elution from the streptavidin-agarose beads was 4-fold higher in samples pretreated with H2O2. Protein recovered from control and H2O2-treated samples after elution from the streptavidin beads was 10 and 40.5 μg, respectively (the amount of protein reacted with GSH-biotin was the same in both samples, i.e. 300 μg). This result is direct proof that 20 S proteasome is susceptible toS-glutathionylation by means of GSH addition to Cys-SOH. Because a significant amount of S-glutathionylated 20 S proteasome was detected in the control sample, part of its Cys residues were probably already oxidized to Cys-SOH (Fig"

Sm/Lsm proteins are focusing the attention because of their involvement in several eukaryotic processes such as mRNA splicing (7Padgett R.A. Mount S.M. Steitz J.A. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1983; 35: 101-107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), histone maturation (8Strub K. Birnstiel M.L.

The function of Sm/Lsm proteins first described in the literature is their role in splicing. Sm/Lsm proteins are involved in the biogenesis of the small nuclear RNPs (snRNPs) U1, U2, U4/U6, and U5, which are essential components of the spliceosome. In the absence of RNA, canonical Sm proteins exist as three independent subcomplexes containing the D3B, D1D2, and EFG proteins, whereas the Lsm proteins are present as preformed heptameric complexes (12Achsel T. Brahms H. Kastner B. Bachi A. Wilm M. Lührmann R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5789-5802Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The Sm complexes associate with cytoplasmic snRNAs in a step-specific order, which is regulated by the survival of motor neurons complex (13Mattaj I.W. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 93-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,14Fischer U. Liu Q. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1997; 90: 1023-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Their association onto the snRNA triggers hypermethylation of the N7-methyl-guanosine cap (15Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1986; 46: 905-911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), which then forms part of the nuclear localization signal and allows snRNPs to return to the nucleus where they will perform their function (16Hamm J.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6783-6792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of the Lsm proteins, the target is U6, the only snRNA that is transcribed by polymerase III. Lsm proteins act at two levels on U6 snRNP. First, they facilitate its biogenesis as Sm proteins do with other U snRNAs, and second, they increase the recycling of the di-snRNP U4/U6 after splicing has occurred (18Mayes A.E. Verdone L. Legrain P. Beggs J.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4321-4331Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic Sm proteins are known to associate with snRNAs onto a sequence called the Sm site. It consists of the consensus sequence PuAU4–6GPu and is usually flanked by stem-loop structures necessary for proper functional binding (19Jarmolowski A. Mattaj I.W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the nonanucleotide AAUUUUUGA is sufficient for the formation of a proper Sm core complex as judged by its biochemical and structural characteristics (20Raker V.A. Hartmuth K. Kastner B. Lührmann R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6554-6565Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In case of the Lsm proteins, the interacting site is composed of a stretch of uridines located at the 3′ end of U6 snRNA (12Achsel T. Brahms H. Kastner B. Bachi A. Wilm M. Lührmann R.

Other Sm-containing complexes are known to interact with sequences similar to the consensus Sm site as in the case of the telomere and the U7 snRNP (22Gilmartin G.M. Schaufele F. Schaffner G. Birnstiel M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1076-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In case of the Sm complex involved in mRNA degradation, the site has not been defined yet (10Bouveret E. Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Séraphin B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1661-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 11He W. Parker R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 346-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). A conserved bipartite domain of ∼70 amino acid residues defines the Sm/Lsm protein family. Up to 30 distinct members compose the human family, whereas in Archaea it is limited to two subtypes called Sm1 or Sm2. Those types have been defined according to the phylogenetic tree obtained from sequence alignment with archaeal Sm protein sequences (5Séraphin B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2089-2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Pyrococcus and Halobacterium species are the only Archaea where a single open reading frame is found. This gene encodes an Sm-related protein of type 1, the more abundant subtype in Archaea. Recently, the bacterial protein Hfq has been shown to belong to the Sm family despite the fact that it contains only the first part of the Sm signature sequence (23Moller T. Franch T. Hojrup P.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2293-2303Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) Sm proteins have shown that the amino acid signature sequence defines a specific Sm-fold composed of a strongly bent 5-stranded β-sheet preceded by a short α-helix. The general architecture observed for the archaeal and predicted for the eukaryotic Sm complexes is a heptameric ring structure containing a highly positively charged cavity where RNA molecules bind. In the Archaeoglobus fulgidus Sm1 protein (AF-Sm1), three residues, namely His-37 and Asn-39 from the first part and Arg-63 from the second part of the Sm domain, form a uridine-specific binding pocket (29Törö I. Thore S. Mayer C. Basquin J. Séraphin B. Suck D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2293-2303Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). These residues are highly conserved within the Sm/Lsm family, and UV cross-linking experiments show that Phe-37 of the human SmG protein (equivalent to His-37 in AF-Sm1) contacts the first uridine of the Sm site (30Urlaub H. Raker V.A. Kostka S. Lührmann R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), suggesting that the RNA binding site has been conserved between Archaea and Eukaryotes. The bacterial Sm protein Hfq also exhibits RNA binding capacity. It binds oligo(A) (31Hajnsdorf E. Regnier P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1501-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) as well as uridine-rich sequences (25Schumacher M.A. Pearson R.F. Moller T. Valentin-Hansen P. Brennan R.G.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1637-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar), even though the second part of the Sm domain, which is involved in RNA binding in archaeal and eukaryotic Sm proteins, is not conserved. Here we report the crystal structures of the Pyrococcus abyssi Sm protein (PA-Sm1) and its complex with a seven-nucleotide long oligo(U). The free protein forms heptameric rings, which associate to form dimer of heptamers in the crystal as well as in solution. The binding of RNA disrupts the dimer of heptamers but leads to only minor structural changes within the heptameric structure, indicating that the PA-Sm1 heptamer represents a rigid preformed RNA binding unit. Nucleotides contact the protein at two different sites: inside the internal cavity in the uridine-specific binding pocket and on the surface of the heptamer close to the N-terminal α-helix. The second site is shown to be important for the association of PA-Sm1 with non-symmetrical RNA. Our structure has allowed us to construct a model of the complex composed of the eukaryotic Sm proteins and a short sequence of the U1 snRNA. The model suggests that the Sm core probably represents a platform for interactions between pre-mRNA and snRNA. The model may also help to understand the regulatory function of the individual Sm protein subunits within the Sm core because the binding to the U-rich sequence composing the Sm binding site can be distinguished from the binding to surrounding sequences. The P. abyssi Sm gene (PAB8160) was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA (Génoscope, Evry, France) and cloned into the expression vector pET24d (Novagen) or in a modified pET24 vector with an upstream sequence coding for a His6 tag followed by a tobacco etch virus protease site. Overexpression of the protein was carried out in the Escherichia coli strain BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL (Stratagene). Cells were grown at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml kanamycin for 3 h (A 600 ∼0.6), and the induction was triggered by adding 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation. Bacteria were lysed using a French press in buffer A (50 mmNaH2PO4 (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) in the presence of protease inhibitor mixture (Promega) and 10 μg/ml ribonuclease A (Sigma). His6-PA-Sm1 was first separated from thermolabile host proteins by a heat shock at a temperature between 85 and 95 °C for 10 min and centrifugation (14,000 rpm, 30 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was loaded onto nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen), and the elution was carried out as recommended by the manufacturer. The pool containing PA-Sm1 was fractionated on a Superdex 75 gel-filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) in buffer A. Fractions containing the proteins were concentrated by ultrafiltration. Tobacco etch virus protease cleavage reaction was carried out overnight at 16 °C at an enzyme to substrate ratio of 1/50. Another gel-filtration step under the same conditions led to a >95% pure sample as judged from Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-page gel (data not shown). PA-Sm1 was concentrated to 18 mg/ml and stored at −20 °C in 20 mm Tris/Cl (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl. The uridine heptamer was purchased from Xeragon. The non-fused protein was purified in a similar way replacing the nickel column by ion-exchange chromatography (Resource Q, AP Biotech). Gel retard experiments were done as described previously (29Törö I. Thore S. Mayer C. Basquin J. Séraphin B. Suck D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2293-2303Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Radioactively labeled RNA (∼50 nm) was used in all assays. Protein concentrations varied between 11 and 55 μm. The mutation of tyrosine 34 to valine was introduced using the QuikChange Mutagenesis Kit from Stratagene and according to the manufacturer's instructions. The oligonucleotides used were as follows: complementary strand, 5′-GGGCAGGCTCATTGGAGTAGACATTCACCTGAATGTCG-3′, and reverse strand, 5′-CGACATTCAGGTGAATGTCTACTCCAATGAGCCTGCCC-3′. The vector was subsequently sequenced to confirm the point mutation. The same procedure was used to purify the mutant protein. Crystals of PA-Sm1 alone were grown by vapor diffusion (hanging drops) from reservoirs containing 27–29% 2-methyl-2,4-methanediol, 150 mm magnesium acetate, 50 mm sodium cacodylate (pH 6.5) at 22 °C. Crystals were flash-frozen directly from the crystallization drops. Two native diffraction data sets at 2.6 and 1.9 Å were collected using an in-house source and the beamline ID14-2 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France), respectively. Data processing was done with XDS (33Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3233) Google Scholar). The two data sets correspond to two crystal forms belonging to the space group P1 with cell parametersa = 69.3 Å, b = 67.6 Å,c = 67.9 Å, α = 117.9°, β = 92.7°, and γ = 105.4° (crystal form I) and a = 69.3 Å, b = 76.2 Å, c = 116.0 Å, α = 90.2°, β = 97.8°, and γ = 107.5° (crystal form II). Crystals of PA-Sm1·U7 were obtained for a monomer/RNA ratio of 1:1 with a protein concentration of 9 mg/ml in 10% polyethylene glycol 1000 molecular weight, 100 mmimidazole (pH 8.0), 250 mm calcium acetate at 4 °C. Drops of 2 μl were prepared by mixing reservoir and protein/RNA solutions at a 1:1 ratio. They were immediately macroseeded with crystals from previous crystallizations. PA-Sm1·U7crystals were flash-frozen in 15% polyethylene glycol 1000, 100 mm imidazole (pH 8.0), 250 mm calcium acetate, and complete data sets were collected at 2.1 and 2.6 Å resolution under cryogenic conditions using the beamline ID29 at ESRF. Data were processed using the HKL package (34Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). The complex was crystallized in P1 with the following identical cell parameters for the two data sets:a = 68.0 Å, b = 68.0 Å,c = 84.7 Å, α = 100.0°, β = 105.0°, and γ = 110.0°.

A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5029) Google Scholar) from the CCP4 package (36Collaborative Computer Project 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19770) Google Scholar) from self-rotation and self-Patterson functions, revealing the presence of a non-crystallographic 7-fold axis (κ = 52°) and a perpendicular 2-fold axis. Using the fact that a 7-fold-axis was found in the self-rotation function, a heptameric model was built using the coordinates of the crystallographic hexameric AF-Sm2 model (37Törö I. Basquin J. Teo-Dreher H. Suck D. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 129-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). 2L. Moulinier, personal communication. The low resolution data set (corresponding to crystal form I) was first used to solve and understand the crystal packing of the structure and later was refined with CNS (38Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar). The resulting heptameric model was used to analyze the high resolution data set (crystal form II). Two peaks in the rotation function clearly corresponded to the orientation of the two sets of head-to-head heptamers, and subsequently, the four heptamers could be successively positioned in the translation function. A final “fitting” step led to a correlation coefficient of 70% and an R-factor of 38%. After rigid body refinement, the structure was refined with CNS to an R-factor of 23.7% andR free of 28.2% containing 28 copies of the monomer including residues 3–73 and 1345 water molecules. The structure of a refined heptamer of PA-Sm1 was used as the search model for molecular replacement using AMoRe. Similarly, to the free protein, a 7-fold and a perpendicular 2-fold axis were observed in the self-rotation function of the PA-Sm1·U7 complex. A solution consisting of 2 heptamers/unit cell was found with a correlation and anR-factor of 67 and 37%, respectively, and was refined using CNS. The electron density map calculated at this stage showed strong density in the solvent region between the two rings. The program COMA (39Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1999; 55: 941-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) was used to compute a correlation map taking into account the non-crystallographic symmetry operators. This clearly revealed the presence of RNA molecules that connected monomers from the two rings. It also facilitated the definition of an improved mask for non-crystallographic symmetry averaging and bulk solvent correction. The model was adjusted by several cycles of model building using program O (40Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar) followed by coordinate minimization andB-factor refinement. RNA molecules were introduced when the protein model was almost satisfying. Connections between nucleotides were built when they were clear in the density and stereochemically possible. The two independent data sets (Table I) revealed the same organization for the RNA strands connecting the protein rings. Nevertheless, the 2.6-Å data set was used in the last positional andB-factor refinement steps because it provided a much better definition for the bases interacting inside the central cavity of the rings. The final model at 2.6-Å resolution consists of 14 PA-Sm1 monomers, 205 water molecules, 7 calcium ions, and a total of 55 nucleotides, leading to an R-factor of 21.0% and anR free of 28.3%. Structures of PA-Sm1 free or in complex with the RNA show good stereochemistry as judged by the program Procheck (41Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). All amino acid residues have φ and ψ angles within the most favored and allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. Refinement statistics are given in Table I. The coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession codes 1H64 for the free protein and 1M8V for the protein/RNA complex). Sequences of human Sm proteins were obtained from the data base. A sequence alignment of human Sm proteins has been done based on the PA-Sm1 structure. The modeling of the three-dimensional structures of eukaryotic SmE, SmF, and SmG proteins was done with the program Whatif (42Vriend G. J. Mol. Graph. 1990; 8: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar) based on sequence homology. In this respect, SmE and SmF were modeled according to the PA-Sm1 structure, and SmG was modeled according to the SmB structure. Construction of the eukaryotic heptamer was achieved by superimposing the eukaryotic Sm proteins onto the PA-Sm1 subunits using the LSQ command in program O and according to the organization of the Sm core (26Kambach C. Walke S. Young R. Avis J.M. de la Fortelle E. Raker V.A. Lührmann R., Li, J. Nagai K. Cell. 1999; 96: 375-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 43Stark H. Dube P. Lührmann R. Kastner B. Nature. 2001; 409: 539-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The same procedure was followed to add the RNA molecule corresponding to the sequence 5′ to the U1 snRNA Sm site, 123AUAAU127. The first three nucleotides were superimposed to U4, U5, and U6. U127 was positioned as the uridine binding in the uridine-binding pocket. The nucleotide A126 is connecting the two binding sites. The backbone position of the nucleotides has been slightly adjusted to follow the surface of the eukaryotic Sm proteins. The electrostatic surface potentials of the PA-Sm1 and the eukaryotic heptamers were calculated using GRASP (44Nicholls A. Sharp K. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5316) Google Scholar). The protein forms a ring-like structure composed of seven monomers (Fig. 1 A). The triclinic unit cell contains four heptamers, and the crystal packing is dominated by heptamer-heptamer interactions in a head-to-head orientation (whereby the head corresponds to the face containing the N-terminal α-helix). Interactions between the heptamers are essentially because of stacking between the Arg-4 and His-10 residues (from each of the 14 subunits) (Fig. 1 A). The presence of Asp-7 in close proximity (around 3 Å) is essential in reducing the overall charge of the Arg-4 residues. Several water molecules are also found within hydrogen-bonding distance from His-10, coordinating the NE2 position of the imidazole ring. Dimers of heptamers are also present in negatively stained electron microscopy micrographs (data not shown) and in solution as seen in gel filtration experiments, suggesting that the dimer of heptamer may be present in the cell. The dimerization of the heptamer of PA-Sm1 might reflect a functional need for the presence in close proximity of two binding sites. Each monomer consists of an N-terminal α-helix followed by five strongly bent β-strands. The contacts between monomers are mainly hydrophobic with intersubunit β-sheet formation between β-strands 4 and 5 from adjacent subunits, resulting in a very stable structure even under denaturing conditions. The PA-Sm1 monomer structure can be closely superimposed with the other known archaeal or eukaryotic Sm structures, emphasizing the strong conservation of the Sm-fold. The root mean square deviation values for Cα-trace superposition among PA-Sm1 and AF-Sm1 (Protein Data Bank code 1I4K), AF-Sm2 (Protein Data Bank code 1LJO), Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum Sm1 (Protein Data Bank code 1I81), Pyrobaculum aerophilum Sm1 (Protein Data Bank code 1I8F), and the eukaryotic Sm structures (Protein Data Bank codes 1D3B and 1B34 for SmB/SmD3 and SmD1/SmD2, respectively) are all between 0.8 and 1.3 Å. It is interesting to note that despite the low sequence similarity between the human and thePyrococcus Sm protein varying from only 18 to 35% (alignment done with the program DNAMAN and using the matrix Blosum250, Lynnon corporation, 2000), the fold is almost completely conserved including the N-terminal region. The closest homologue of PA-Sm1 is SmE (35% sequence homology), a protein known to be essential for viability in yeast (45Bordonne R. Tarassov I. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 176: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The similarity between SmE and PA-Sm1 is especially high in the N-terminal region and may indicate conserved structural features involved in RNA binding (see below). P. abyssi is the first fully sequenced organism containing only one open reading frame encoding an Sm protein. Therefore, this heptameric organization is probably the biological unit in agreement with the seven-membered eukaryotic Sm protein ring model proposed by K. Nagai and co-workers (26Kambach C. Walke S. Young R. Avis J.M. de la Fortelle E. Raker V.A. Lührmann R., Li, J. Nagai K. Cell. 1999; 96: 375-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Nevertheless and in the absence of anyin vivo data regarding the Sm complex(es) found inPyrococcus species, we cannot rule out the possibility that the biological unit is not the heptamer but the dimer of heptamers. The PA-Sm1 protein was co-crystallized with a uridine heptamer (U7). Crystals diffracted up to a 2.1-Å resolution, and two data sets were collected from two different crystals at 2.1- and 2.6-Å resolutions, respect"
https://openalex.org/W1968357607,"Salicylates, including aspirin, have been shown to improve insulin sensitivity both in human and animal models. Although it has been suggested that salicylates sensitize insulin action by inhibiting IκB kinase β (IKKβ), the detailed mechanisms remain unclear. Protein kinase C isoforms and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) signaling pathways are well described mediators of insulin resistance; they are implicated in the activation of IKKβ and the subsequent inhibition of proximal insulin signaling via insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) and Akt. This study investigated the effect of salicylic acid on phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)- and TNFα-induced insulin resistance in a human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cell line stably expressing recombinant human IRS1. The results showed that both PMA and TNFα inhibited insulin-induced Akt phosphorylation and promoted IRS1 phosphorylation on Ser-307. Salicylic acid pretreatment completely reversed the effects of PMA and TNFα on both Akt and IRS1. Whereas PMA activated protein kinase C isoforms and IKKβ, TNFα activated neither. On the other hand, both PMA and TNFα activated the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which has been reported to directly phosphorylate IRS1 Ser-307. SP600125, a JNK inhibitor, prevented PMA and TNFα-induced IRS1 Ser-307 phosphorylation. Finally, salicylic acid inhibited JNK activation induced by both PMA and TNFα. Taken together, these observations suggest that salicylic acid can reverse the inhibitory effects of TNFα on insulin signaling via an IKKβ-independent mechanism(s), potentially involving the inhibition of JNK activation. The role of JNK in salicylic acid-mediated insulin sensitization, however, requires further validation because the JNK inhibitor SP600125 appears to have other nonspecific activity in addition to inhibiting JNK activity.

IκB kinase insulin receptor substrate c-Jun N-terminal kinase tumor necrosis factor α mitogen-activated protein MAP kinase phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate human embryonic kidney 293 protein kinase C IκB kinase β (IKKβ),1 a serine/threonine kinase, is a component of the larger IKK signalosome, which also consists of IKKα and IKKγ. Whereas IKKα is also a serine/threonine kinase and is highly homologous to IKKβ, IKKγ is a scaffold protein with no enzymatic activity. Upon exposure to stimuli including stress or cytokines, both IKKα and IKKβ undergo phosphorylation and activation. The activated IKK kinases phosphorylate serine residues in IκB, which subsequently becomes degraded via the proteasome pathway. Prior to its degradation, IκB binds to NFκB and prevents its translocation into the nucleus. Thus, IKKs potentiate NFκB-mediated gene transcription (as occurs in the inflammatory states). Interestingly, IKKβ but not IKKα deficiency appears to result in immunodeficiency in mice, suggesting that IKKβ but not IKKα plays a dominant role in immunoresponses (1Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4106) Google Scholar, 2Karin M. Delhase M. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). Salicylates, including aspirin, have been shown to be antidiabetic in both animal models and man in both long term (i.e. 3–4 week) and short term (i.e. overnight) treatments (3Williamson R.T. Lond M.D. Br. Med. J. 1901; 1: 760-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 4Reid J. MacDougall A.I. Andrews M.M. Br. Med.

Invest. 2001; 108: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that the antidiabetic effects of salicylates are mediated via direct inhibition of IKKβ. First, salicylates were reported to specifically inhibit the kinase activity of recombinant IKKβ but not IKKα proteins in vitro and to down-regulate NFκB-mediated transcription regulation in cultured cells (6Yin M.J. Yamamoto Y. Gaynor R.B. Nature. 1998; 396: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar, 7Pierce J.W. Read M.A. Ding H. Luscinskas F.W. Collins T. J.

Second, IKKβ heterozygous mice have improved insulin sensitivity and reduced plasma glucose levels (9Yuan M. Konstantopoulos N. Lee J. Hansen L., Li, Z.W. Karin M. Shoelson S.E. Science. 2001; 293: 1673-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (1643) Google Scholar). Third, IKKβ heterozygosity in ob/ob background also improves insulin sensitivity in the mice (9Yuan M. Konstantopoulos N. Lee J. Hansen L., Li, Z.W. Karin M. Shoelson S.E. Science. 2001; 293: 1673-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (1643) Google Scholar). Finally, IKKβ heterozygosity and salicylate treatment prevents lipid-induced insulin resistance in animal models (5Kim J.K. Kim Y.J. Fillmore J.J. Chen Y. Moore I. Lee J. Yuan M., Li, Z.W. Karin M.

It was reported recently that IRS1 Ser-307 (refers to the rat IRS1 protein or Ser-312 in human IRS1) is a key regulatory site (17Aguirre V. Werner E.D. Giraud J. Lee Y.H. Shoelson S.E. White M.F. J.

Moreover, phosphorylation at this site can be mediated by the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and may be an important contributor to the inhibitory effects of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) on insulin signaling. It was further proposed that salicylate treatment or IKKβ deficiency can improve insulin sensitivity by reducing the serine phosphorylation of IRS proteins (i.e.IRS1) (5Kim J.K. Kim Y.J. Fillmore J.J. Chen Y. Moore I. Lee J. Yuan M., Li, Z.W. Karin M. Perret P. Shoelson S.E. Shulman G.I. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar, 9Yuan M.

Salicylates inhibit the kinase activity of recombinant IKKβ in vitro and the biological function of endogenous IKKβ in cultured cells with an EC50 of 50–100 μm (6Yin M.J. Yamamoto Y. Gaynor R.B. Nature. 1998; 396: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). On the other hand, in in vivo experiments in which antidiabetic effects were demonstrated, salicylates reached millimolar concentrations in the plasma (5Kim J.K. Kim Y.J. Fillmore J.J. Chen Y. Moore I. Lee J. Yuan M., Li, Z.W. Karin M. Perret P. Shoelson S.E. Shulman G.I. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Such a discrepancy between in vitro and in vivo potency may be ascribed to, for example, potentially lower salicylate levels in the intracellular environment than in the plasma. On the other hand, it is also possible that at such a high concentration in vivo, salicylates may manifest antidiabetic effects by regulating other targets in addition to or other than IKKβ. In fact, at high concentrations salicylates have been shown to have additional effects such as inhibition of mitochondria function (23Trost L.C. Lemasters J.J. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1997; 147: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 24Al-Nasser I.A. Toxicol. Lett. 1999; 105: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and inhibition of phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) (25Wang Z. Jiang B. Brecher P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 63: 1197-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was reported that treatment of intact cells with salicylate inhibited TNFα-induced but not interleukin-1-induced IKK activity and that this inhibition was prevented by a p38 MAPK inhibitor, suggesting that salicylate does not directly bind to and inhibit IKKβ in intact cells (26Alpert D. Vilcek J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10925-10929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the antidiabetic effects of salicylates may not be mediated exclusively by the inhibition of IKKβ. The current study was initiated to investigate the effects of salicylic acid on phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA)- and TNFα-induced insulin resistance in a HEK293 cell line stably expressing recombinant IRS1. Results from this study suggest the following. 1) PMA and TNFα inhibit insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation and promote inhibitory IRS1 serine 307 phosphorylation. 2) Salicylic acid reverses the effects of PMA and TNFα on Akt and IRS1 phosphorylation. 3) Salicylic acid attenuates the inhibitory effects of TNFα on insulin signaling through an IKKβ-independent mechanism. 4) JNK kinase is activated by and may be important for both PMA and TNFα-induced insulin resistance in these cells. 5) Salicylic acid partially inhibits PMA and TNFα-induced JNK activation. Insulin, TNFα, PMA, and salicylic acid were purchased from Sigma. Salicylic acid was prepared as 1 mstock solution in 1 m Tris-HCl, pH7.5, aliquoted, and stored at −20 °C. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against total insulin receptor β subunit, total IRS1, IRS1 phosphorylated at Ser-307 (IRS1-pS307), and total PKCδ were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Mouse monoclonal antibody (4G10) against tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins was also purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against total Akt, Akt phosphorylated at threonine 308 (Akt-pT308), total IKKα, total IKKβ, both IKKα phosphorylated at serine 180 and IKKβ phosphorylated at serine 181, phosphorylated PKC isoforms (PKC-pan), PKCα/βII phosphorylated at threonine 638 and 641, PKCδ phosphorylated at threonine 505, PKCδ phosphorylated at serine 643, PKCμ phosphorylated at serine 744/748, PKCμ phosphorylated at serine 916, PKCθ phosphorylated at threonine 538, PKCξ/λ phosphorylated at threonine 410 and 403, total PKCμ, total c-Jun, and c-Jun phosphorylated at serine 73 were purchased from Cell Signaling(Beverly, MA). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against total p38 MAP kinase, p38 MAPK phosphorylated at threonine 180 and tyrosine 182, total p42/44 MAP kinase, p42/44 MAP kinase phosphorylated at threonine 202 and tyrosine 204, total JNK, and JNK phosphorylated at Thr-183, and Tyr-185 were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Mouse monoclonal antibody against total PKCθ was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. SP600125, a JNK inhibitor, was purchased from Biomol(Plymouth Meeting, PA). HEK293 cells stably expressing recombinant human IRS1 (HEK293.IRS1 cells) were a gift from Dr. Richard Roth. The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in 10% CO2. For the experiments, the cells were first incubated in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium overnight. The cells were then treated with vehicle, salicylic acid, or SP600125 for 2 h at 37 °C. PMA or TNFα were then added to the media. After incubation for another 30 min, the cells were exposed to insulin for 15 min, rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and then lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer. The lysis buffer contains 20 mm HEPES, pH7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 150 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mmsodium fluoride, and 1× concentration of a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation. Protein concentrations were determined using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). Cell lysates were resuspended in SDS-loading buffer (Invitrogen) and separated in precast 4–20% gradient NuPAGE SDS-PAGE gels (Invitrogen). The proteins were then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and probed with primary antibodies. Detection was performed with ECF Western blotting Kit (Amersham Biosciences) by scanning with a Storm® gel and blot imaging system (Amersham Biosciences) per the manufacturer's recommendation.

Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) have been shown to inhibit insulin signaling in cultured cells. Akt phosphorylation (and activation) is a key event in insulin signaling and has been commonly used as a surrogate marker for assessing the level of activation of the proximal insulin signaling pathway (30Shepherd P.R. Withers D.J. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). We therefore determined whether PMA and/or TNFα inhibit insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation in the HEK293.IRS1 cells. If so, we sought to see if such inhibition could be reversed by salicylic acid. As shown in Fig. 1 A, insulin stimulation resulted in an apparent increase in Akt phosphorylation at threonine 308 (Akt-pT308) in the HEK293.IRS1 cells (Fig. 1 A, lane 2 versus 1). PMA treatment reduced insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 1 A, lane 3 versus 2). Although salicylic acid pre-treatment by itself did not affect insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 1 A, lane 5 versus 2), it reversed the negative effects by PMA (Fig. 1 A, lane 4 versus 3). Similar observations were made on cells treated with TNFα (Fig. 1 B). Taken together, these results suggest that PMA and TNFα negatively affect insulin signaling in HEK293.IRS1 cells and that such negative regulation can be reversed by salicylic acid. Both PMA and TNFα have been shown to inhibit insulin signaling by promoting IRS1 phosphorylation at multiple serine residues (13Rui L. Aguirre V. Kim J.K. Shulman G.I. Lee A. Corbould A. Dunaif A.

Furthermore, it was reported recently that IRS1 Ser-307 phosphorylation mediates the inhibitory effects of TNFα on insulin signaling (17Aguirre V. Werner E.D. Giraud J. Lee Y.H. Shoelson S.E. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 17: 17Google Scholar,22Aguirre V. Uchida T. Yenush L. Davis R. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9047-9054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether PMA and/or TNFα induce IRS Ser-307 phosphorylation in the HEK293.IRS1 cells. We further determined whether salicylic acid could attenuate the effect of PMA or TNFα on IRS Ser-307 phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 2 A, PMA treatment resulted in ∼4-fold increase in IRS1 Ser-307 phosphorylation. Such phosphorylation was reversed by pre-treatment with salicylic acid. Similar observations were made using cells treated with TNFα (Fig. 2 B). Taken together, these results suggest that PMA and TNFα induce IRS1 Ser-307 phosphorylation and that such phosphorylation can be effectively blocked by salicylic acid treatment in the HEK293.IRS1 cells. PMA is known to activate multiple isoforms of classical and novel PKCs (31Quest A.F. Enzyme Protein. 1996; 49: 231-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 32Liu W.S. Heckman C.A. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 529-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). We performed experiments to identify the PKC isoforms that were activated by PMA in the HEK293.IRS1 cells and determine whether the activation of any of the PKC isoforms was reversed by salicylic acid. To this end, Western blots were performed using antibodies against PKC isoforms that were phosphorylated at their activation loops, autophosphorylation sites, or at hydrophobic sites within the C terminus of the enzyme. Such phosphorylation is known to correlate to the activation and catalytic activity of the PKC isoforms (33Newton A.C. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2353-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar, 34Parekh D.B. Ziegler W. Parker P.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 496-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). As expected, PMA treatment did not activate PKCξ/λ, the atypical PKC isoforms, in the HEK293.IRS1 cells (Fig. 3,bottom panel). Although PMA did not appear to activate classical PKCα/βII (Fig. 3, second panel from top), it activated novel PKCμ, PKCδ, and PKCθ (Fig. 3, third through ninth panels from top). Pre-treatment with salicylic acid did not appear to affect PMA-mediated activation of any of these PKC isoforms. Taken together, these results suggest that salicylic acid did not affect PMA-mediated PKC activation. Some of the PMA-responsive PKC isoforms (i.e. PKCθ and PKCζ) have been implicated in the activation of IKKβ (35Lin X. O'Mahony A., Mu, Y. Geleziunas R. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2933-2940Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 36Trushin S.A. Pennington K.N. Algeciras-Schimnich A. Paya C.V. J. Biol.

Moscat J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 771-780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that TNFα activates IKKβ (2Karin M. Delhase M. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). We decided to investigate whether PMA and/or TNFα activate IKKβ in the HEK293.IRS1 cells and, if so, whether such activation could be reversed by salicylic acid. To this end, we determined the activation of IKKα and IKKβ using an antibody that specifically recognizes both IKKα phosphorylated at serine 180 and IKKβ phosphorylated at serine 181. Phosphorylation of serine 176 and 180 in IKKα (177 and 181 in IKKβ) are required for activation of the kinases (38Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L., Li, J. Young D.B. Barbosa M. Mann M. Manning A. Rao A. Science. 1997; 278: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar). In fact, for IKKβ there is full correspondence between its kinase activity and its Ser-177 and Ser-181 phosphorylation (39Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, PMA treatment led to phosphorylation (and activation) of both IKKα and IKKβ (Fig. 4,top three panels, lane 3 versus 1). In contrast, TNFα stimulation did not result in the phosphorylation of either IKKα or IKKβ (Fig. 4,top three panels, lane 2 versus 1). In addition, TNFα treatment did not activate PKC isoforms based on Western blot using an antibody against phosphorylated pan-PKC (Fig. 4, bottom panel,lane 2 versus 1) or antibodies against phosphorylated individual PKC isoforms (data not shown). The effect of PMA to induce IKKα and IKKβ phosphorylation implies that these two IKKs are functional in these cells. Because the same concentration of TNFα that was sufficient to impair insulin signaling did not activate either IKKα or IKKβ, it appears that IKKβ is not involved in TNFα-mediated intracellular signaling in these cells. Furthermore, these results exclude the possibility that the salicylic acid-elicited blockade of TNFα-induced insulin resistance is mediated via IKKβ in these cells. JNK has been reported to phosphorylate IRS1 at serine 307 and inhibit insulin signaling (17Aguirre V. Werner E.D. Giraud J. Lee Y.H. Shoelson S.E. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 17: 17Google Scholar, 22Aguirre V. Uchida T. Yenush L. Davis R. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9047-9054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar). We performed experiments to address whether JNK was activated by PMA and/or TNFα in the HEK293.IRS1 cells. As shown in Fig. 5 A, PMA treatment leads to phosphorylation (and activation) of the 54- and 46-kDa isoforms of JNK. A similar observation was made about TNFα-treated cells (Fig. 5 B). Taken together, these results demonstrated that both PMA and TNFα treatments in the HEK293.IRS1 cells activate JNK. Next we assessed whether JNK is critical or required for PMA and TNFα-mediated effects on insulin signaling. To address this question, we determined the effect of SP600125, a JNK small molecular inhibitor (40Bennett B.L. Sasaki D.T. Murray B.W. O'Leary E.C. Sakata S.T., Xu, W. Leisten J.C. Motiwala A. Pierce S. Satoh Y. Bhagwat S.S. Manning A.M. Anderson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13681-13686Crossref PubMed Scopus (2244) Google Scholar), on PMA- and TNFα-induced IRS1 Ser-307 phosphorylation. It was reported that, at 5μm, SP600125 inhibits JNK activity in intact hemopoietic cells (40Bennett B.L. Sasaki D.T. Murray B.W. O'Leary E.C. Sakata S.T., Xu, W. Leisten J.C. Motiwala A. Pierce S. Satoh Y. Bhagwat S.S. Manning A.M. Anderson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13681-13686Crossref PubMed Scopus (2244) Google Scholar). We first determined whether SP600125 inhibits JNK activity in the HEK293.IRS1 cells. As shown in Fig. 6, SP600125 did not affect JNK phosphorylation (and activation) upon both TNFα (Fig. 6 B,third panel from top,lanes 5 and 6 versus 3 and4) and PMA treatment (data not shown). On the other hand, SP600125 inhibited phosphorylation of the transcription factor c-Jun, a physiological substrate of JNK, upon PMA treatment (Fig. 6 A,third panel from top, lanes 5 and 6 versus 3 and 4). We had difficulty detecting TNFα-induced c-Jun phosphorylation (data not shown). Taken together, these results confirm that SP600125 indeed inhibits the kinase activity but not the activation process of JNK in the HEK293.IRS1 cells. It was reported that, although SP600125 potently inhibits the kinase activity of recombinant JNK enzymes (IC50 of 40–90 nm), it is rather inactive against the kinase activity of recombinant p42/44, p38, IKKα, IKKβ, and PKC isoforms (including PKCθ) (IC50 of more than 10 μm), indicating a high degree of JNK selectivity for SP600125 (40Bennett B.L. Sasaki D.T. Murray B.W. O'Leary E.C. Sakata S.T., Xu, W. Leisten J.C. Motiwala A. Pierce S. Satoh Y. Bhagwat S.S. Manning A.M. Anderson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13681-13686Crossref PubMed Scopus (2244) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was also reported that at 5 μm or less the effect of SP600125 on JNK activity is specific because SP600125 does not affect the activity or activation of other serine/threonine kinases in the intact hemopoietic cells (40Bennett B.L. Sasaki D.T. Murray B.W. O'Leary E.C. Sakata S.T., Xu, W. Leisten J.C. Motiwala A. Pierce S. Satoh Y. Bhagwat S.S. Manning A.M. Anderson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13681-13686Crossref PubMed Scopus (2244) Google Scholar). We decided to confirm such specificity in the HEK293.IRS1 cells. Indeed, SP600125 did not appear to affect PMA-induced activating phosphorylation of IKKα and IKKβ (Fig. 6 A, bottom panel, lanes 5and 6 versus 3 and 4). SP600125 treatment also did not affect PMA- (data not shown) and TNFα-induced activation of both p42/44 MAPK kinases (Fig. 6 B, fourth panel from top, lanes 5 and6 versus 3 and 4) and p38 MAPK (Fig. 6 B, bottom panel,lanes 5 and 6 versus 3 and4). Taken together, these results are consistent with the notion that at 5 μm SP600125 specifically inhibits JNK activity in the HEK293.IRS1 cells (see more in Fig. 6 C and the corresponding discussion for additional nonspecific activity). Finally, we determined whether JNK enzymes are important in mediating PMA- and TNFα-induced IRS1 Ser-307 phosphorylation. The results indicate that SP600125 treatment prevented IRS1 Ser-307 phosphorylation induced by both PMA (Fig. 6 A, top two panels, lanes 5 and 6 versus 3 and 4) and TNFα (Fig. 6 B, top two panels,lanes 5 and 6 versus 3 and4). Taken together, these results suggest that JNK is activated by PMA and TNFα and may be important for PMA and TNFα-induced IRS1 Ser-307 phosphorylation. mediated JNK Activation—The above results suggest that JNK was required for PMA- and TNFα-mediated IRS1 Ser-307 phosphorylation and insulin resistance. A key question was whether the effects of salicylic acid on insulin signaling, including IRS1 Ser-307 phosphorylation, were mediated by the inhibition of JNK. Thus, we determined whether salicylic acid affected JNK activation by PMA and TNFα. As shown in Fig. 5, salicylic acid significantly inhibited the activating phosphorylation of both the 54- and 46-kDa JNK induced by both PMA (Fig. 5 A) and TNFα (Fig. 5 B). Furthermore, the inhibition of JNK phosphorylation by salicylic acid appeared to be specific because salicylic acid did not inhibit the activating phosphorylation of p42/44 MAP kinases induced by both PMA (Fig. 5 A, bottom two panels,lanes 5 and 6 versus 3 and4) and TNFα (data not shown). Salicylate acid also did not affect the activating phosphorylation of the p38 MAPK kinases by PMA and TNFα (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that salicylic acid specifically inhibits JNK activation by PMA and TNFα. To further demonstrate that JNK plays a negative role in insulin signaling and that its activation is required for PMA and TNFα-mediated insulin resistance, we decided to determine whether SP600125 can reverse PMA and TNFα-mediated inhibition on insulin signaling. Rather surprisingly, however, we found that SP600125 by itself completely inhibited insulin-stimulated threonine phosphorylation of Akt (Fig. 6 C, top panel) as well as tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 (middle panel) and the insulin receptor β subunit (bottom panel). These results suggest that SP600125 has some nonspecific activity that has not been reported previously (40Bennett B.L. Sasaki D.T. Murray B.W. O'Leary E.C. Sakata S.T., Xu, W. Leisten J.C. Motiwala A. Pierce S. Satoh Y. Bhagwat S.S. Manning A.M. Anderson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13681-13686Crossref PubMed Scopus (2244) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, such nonspecific activity excludes us from determining whether SP600126 treatments can reverse PMA- and TNFα-mediated inhibition of insulin signaling. In the current study, several observations have been made using a cellular model system for insulin signaling, i.e. a HEK293 cell line stably expressing recombinant human IRS1. First, both PMA and TNFα inhibited insulin-stimulated activating phosphorylation of Akt and promoted IRS1 Ser-307 phosphorylation. Second, the effects of PMA and TNFα on Akt phosphorylation and IRS1 serine phosphorylation were reversed by salicylic acid pretreatment. Third, PMA treatment led to activation of multiple serine/threonine kinases including PKC isoforms and IKKβ; however, such activation was not affected by salicylic acid. Fourth, TNFα treatment did not active either PKC isoforms or IKKβ. Fifth, JNK was activated by both TNFα and PMA, and its inhibition by a small molecule inhibitor prevented TNFα- and PMA-induced IRS1 Ser-307 phosphorylation. The small molecular inhibitor, however, has some additional nonspecific activity. Finally, salicylic acid also inhibited TNFα- and PMA-induced activating phosphorylation of JNK. The goal of this study was to further elucidate the role of IKKβ and salicylic acid in inhibiting or augmenting insulin signaling, respectively. In our experimental system, PMA and TNFα were chosen to induce insulin resistance for several reasons. First, the negative effects of PMA and TNFα on insulin signaling are well documented, at least in cultured cells in vitro (11Hotamisligil G.S. Peraldi P. Budavari A. Ellis R. White M.F.

Second, IKKβ is a well established downstream kinase for TNFα (2Karin M. Delhase M. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that IKKβ can be activated by PKC isoforms (i.e. PKCθ and PKCζ) (35Lin X. O'Mahony A., Mu, Y. Geleziunas R. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2933-2940Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 36Trushin S.A. Pennington K.N. Algeciras-Schimnich A. Paya C.V. J. Biol.

In fact, it was recently reported that PKCζ deficiency in mice impaired IKKβ activation (37Leitges M. Sanz L. Martin P. Duran A. Braun U. Garcia J.F. Camacho F. Diaz-Meco M.T. Rennert P.D. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 771-780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The results from the current study indicate that PMA activates multiple isoforms of PKC and IKK enzymes in the HEK293.IRS1 cells (Fig. 3). In addition to activating IKKβ (2Karin M. Delhase M. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar), TNFα has also been shown to activate PKC in multiple cell types (42Matsubara N. Fuchimoto S. Orita K. Immunology. 1991; 73: 457-459PubMed Google Scholar, 43Matsubara N. Mizukawa K. Iwagaki H. Fuchimoto S. Kimura Y. Orita K. Cell.

Ito H. Veys T.J. Spurzem J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: L1007-L1012PubMed Google Scholar). It was therefore rather surprising that TNFα did not activate IKKα, IKKβ, and the multiple PKC isoforms examined in the HEK293.IRS1 cells (Fig. 4). Based on these observations, we conclude that in the HEK293.IRS1 cells IKKβ is intact but is not involved in TNFα signaling. Therefore, the lack of IKKβ activation by TNFα in the HEK293.IRS1 cells provided us with a unique setting to determine whether IKKβ activation and its inhibition are involved and/or required for salicylate-mediated insulin sensitization. It then follows that the effect of TNFα on insulin signaling in the HEK293.IRS1 cells is independent of IKKβ activation. Because salicylate was readily able to reverse TNFα-induced effects on insulin signaling, it also appears that these effects of the drug must be also IKKβ-independent. In contrast, the current study does not provide sufficient evidence to assess whether the action of salicylic acid to reverse the effects of PMA on insulin action is mediated via IKKβ inhibition. How does salicylic acid reverse insulin resistance in these cells if not via inhibition of IKKβ? We considered that salicylic acid might improve insulin sensitivity by inhibiting kinase(s) other than IKKβ, which were responsive to both PMA and TNFα. To this end, we examined the serine/threonine kinase JNK. JNK has been shown to be activated by both PMA (47Werlen G. Jacinto E. Xia Y. Karin M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3101-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 48Ghaffari-Tabrizi N. Bauer B. Villunger A. Baier-Bitterlich G. Altman A. Utermann G. Uberall F. Baier G. Eur. J.

Science. 1997; 275: 200-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Most interestingly, TNFα was recently shown to inhibit insulin signaling by activating JNK, which subsequently becomes associated with Ser-307 in IRS1 and phosphorylates it (22Aguirre V. Uchida T. Yenush L. Davis R. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9047-9054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar). To elucidate the role of JNK in PMA- and TNFα-induced insulin resistance and its reversal by salicylic acid, we performed a separate series of experiments and made several interesting observations. First, by demonstrating that both PMA and TNFα treatment induced activating phosphorylation of JNK (Fig. 5), we confirmed that JNK is involved in signaling in response to both PMA and TNFα in the HEK 293 cells. Second, by showing that SP600125 inhibits PMA- and TNFα-induced IRS1 Ser-307 phosphorylation, we propose that JNK activity may be important for the effects of PMA and TNFα on insulin signaling in these cells (see more discussion later on the nonspecific activity of SP600125). Finally, we showed that salicylic acid inhibits PMA- and TNFα-induced JNK activating phosphorylation (Fig. 6). Thus, these observations suggest that JNK is activated by (and its activity may be important for) PMA- and TNFα-induced insulin resistance. Most interestingly, the results also suggest that salicylic acid improves insulin sensitivity potentially by inhibiting JNK activation. Fig. 7 summarizes the working hypothesis on the effects of salicylic acid on PMA- and TNFα-induced insulin resistance in the HEK293.IRS1 cells. In short, we propose that JNK may be directly responsible for IRS1 Ser-307 phosphorylation. IRS1 phosphorylated at Ser-307 has an impaired ability to undergo tyrosine phosphorylation by insulin receptor, leading to insulin resistance as reflected in reduced Akt phosphorylation (and activation). Salicylic acid reversed the effects of PMA and TNFα in association with reduced JNK activation. Although the detailed mechanism by which salicylic acid inhibits JNK activation in these cells remains unknown, it is most likely to be IKKβ-independent. Although both PMA and TNFα treatment lead to JNK activation, the signaling pathways were apparently different. PMA activates PKC isoforms as well IKK kinases. TNFα did not activate either. Nevertheless, salicylic acid appears to inhibit JNK activation by both PMA and TNFα. In summary, the results from the current study suggest that IKKβ inhibition is not necessarily critical to the mechanism(s) for salicylate-mediated insulin sensitization in the TNFα treatment paradigm. One approach to further validate our results would be to determine whether PMA and TNFα can induce IRS1 Ser-307 phosphorylation in IKKβ-deficient cells and, if so, whether the effects by PMA and TNFα can be reversed by salicylic acid. However, it also remains to be established that the antidiabetic effects of salicylate in vivo are directly tied to inhibition of IKKβ. Nevertheless, the apparent existence of IKKβ-independent alternative pathway(s) underscores the need for additional knowledge regarding the mechanism(s) of salicylate-mediated insulin sensitization Finally, although the current study suggests that JNK activation plays an important role in PMA and TNFα-mediated insulin resistance and that its inhibition may be responsible for salicylic acid-mediated insulin sensitization, such a proposal needs further validation because some of the results were derived from the use of the JNK inhibitor SP600125. We found that although SP600125 does not affect PMA- or TNFα-induced activation of several kinases (Fig. 6,A and B), it inhibits insulin signaling (Fig. 6 C), indicating that the inhibitor may not be as specific as originally reported (40Bennett B.L. Sasaki D.T. Murray B.W. O'Leary E.C. Sakata S.T., Xu, W. Leisten J.C. Motiwala A. Pierce S. Satoh Y. Bhagwat S.S. Manning A.M. Anderson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13681-13686Crossref PubMed Scopus (2244) Google Scholar). One approach to further test the current theory would be to determine whether PMA and TNFα induce IRS1 Ser-307 phosphorylation and inhibit insulin signaling in JNK-deficient cells."

In particular, telomere dysfunction because of either critical telomere shortening or because of mutation of telomere-binding proteins results in increased apoptosis and/or cell arrest. Here, we show that, in turn, DNA damage-induced apoptosis results in a dramatic telomere loss. In particular, using flow cytometry for simultaneous detection of telomere length and apoptosis, we show that cells undergoing apoptosis upon DNA damage also exhibit a rapid and dramatic loss of telomeric sequences. This telomere loss occurs at early stages of apoptosis, because it does not require caspase-3 activation, and it is induced by loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) and production of reactive oxygen species.

All organisms are equipped with mechanisms to recognize and respond to DNA damage, either by triggering cell cycle arrest or by undergoing cell death by apoptosis (1Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2596) Google Scholar). Apoptosis is a form of cell death that has been described as distinct from necrotic cell death. The biochemical characteristics of apoptosis include (i) loss of plasma membrane phospholipid asymmetry, (ii) activation of a cascade of caspases, and (iii) loss of the mitochondrial barrier function (2Roy S. Nicholson D.W. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 647-658Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since the seminal work of Müller in the 1930s, we know that the ends of chromosomes have a special structure that distinguishes them from DNA breaks and protects them from fusing (3Müller H.J. Collect. Net. Woods Hole. 1938; 13: 181-198Google Scholar). Telomeres are composed of tandem repeats of non-coding DNA sequences (TTAGGG in all vertebrates) and of associated proteins (4McEachern M.J. Krauskopf A. Blackburn E.H. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2000; 34: 331-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar, 5de Lange T. Science. 2001; 292: 1171-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Both a minimal length of TTAGGG repeats at the telomeres and telomere-binding proteins are essential to preserve functional telomeres (6Blackburn E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5919-5921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is likely that telomeres are protected from cellular activities by their ability to form a higher order structure known as the T-loop (7Griffith J.D. Comeau L. Rosenfield S. Stansel R.M. Bianchi A. Moss H. de Lange T. Cell. 1999; 97: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1886) Google Scholar). Loss of TTAGGG repeats during cell division or with increasing age may result in telomere dysfunction and, therefore, delimit life span. Telomere shortening is prevented in those cell types that activate the enzyme telomerase, a reverse transcriptase that synthesizes telomeric repeatsde novo at chromosome ends. Telomerase has two essential components, a catalytic subunit (hTERT) and a small RNA molecule that contains the template use to synthesize new telomeric repeats (hTER) (8Collins K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 378-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Telomerase activity has been found in germ cells and in most tumors, but only weak or no activity is detected in normal somatic cells (9Shay J.W. Bacchetti S. Eur. J. Cancer. 1997; 33: 787-791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2355) Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of telomerase in somatic mortal cells results in telomere elongation and indefinite extension of the life span, indicating that telomerase activity is sufficient for immortal growth (10Bodnar A.G. Ouellette M. Frolkis M. Holt S.E. Chiu C.P. Morin G.B. Harley C.B. Shay J.W. Lichtsteiner S. Wright W.E. Science. 1998; 279: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (4040) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown recently (11Blasco M.A. Lee H.W. Hande M.P. Samper E. Lansdorp P.M. DePinho R.A. Greider C.W.

In addition, proteins important for double strand break repair, such as the components of the DNA·PK and MRE11 complexes, which are involved in non-homologous end joining of double strand DNA breaks and in homologous recombination, have been shown to be also located at the telomeres and to influence telomere function (18Samper E.

A connection between telomerase activity and resistance to apoptosis has also been established (22Mattson M.P., Fu, W. Zhang P. Mech. Ageing. Dev. 2001; 122: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In particular, inhibition of telomerase and telomere shortening below a critical length results in apoptosis in various cell types, whereas induction of telomerase activity is associated with resistance to apoptosis (23Hahn W.C. Stewart S.A. Brooks M.W. York S.G. Eaton E. Kurachi A. Beijersbergen R.L. Knoll J.H. Meyerson M. Weinberg R.A. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 1164-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar, 24Herbert B.

Here, we show that the opposite is also true and that DNA damage-induced apoptosis results in a dramatic telomere shortening in those cells undergoing apoptosis. In addition, we determine that this massive telomere shortening is one of the early events of DNA damage-induced apoptosis. All together, these results support a role for telomeres as key sensors of DNA damage. Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) were obtained from 20 ml of heparinized whole blood donated by 15 healthy volunteers. PBL were isolated by differential gradient centrifugation (Ficoll/Hypaque; Amersham Biosciences). Pro-myelocytic leukemia HL60 cells (ATCC CCL 240) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cultured cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 2 mm glutamine (Invitrogen), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (10,000 units penicillin/ml and 10 mg/ml streptomycin). Cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified, 5% CO2 atmosphere. Wild-type and late generation telomerase-deficient mice, Terc−/−, were described elsewhere (11Blasco M.A. Lee H.W. Hande M.P. Samper E. Lansdorp P.M. DePinho R.A. Greider C.W. Cell. 1997; 91: 25-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1775) Google Scholar). The inhibitor of caspase-3 protease (acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aldehyde; Ac-DEVD-CHO) was purchased from BD Biosciences and was used at 100 nm, and camptothecin (CPT; 10 μm) and etoposide (10 μg/ml) (Sigma) were used for 6 h at the indicated concentrations. In experiments using UV to induce apoptosis, cells were exposed to 180 mJ/cm2 UV light and further cultured for 8 h in medium. S-100 extracts were prepared from wild-type, DNA·PKcs+/−, and DNA·PKcs−/−primary mouse embryo fibroblast cultures, and a modified version of the telomeric repeat amplification protocol assay was used to measure telomerase activity as described (11Blasco M.A. Lee H.W.

An internal control for PCR efficiency was included (TRAPeze kit Oncor). A HindIII fragment encompassing the human p53 cDNA was cloned into the retroviral vector pLNSX. Transfection of the plasmid containing the p53 gene or the empty vector was done using Lipofectin according to the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Human HL60 cells were plated in six-well culture plates for 24 h at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well. Plasmid DNA (1 μg) and Lipofectin (6 μg) in culture medium were incubated for 45 min at room temperature. Plasmid and Lipofectin were then mixed and further incubated for 45 min before laying the complex over the cells. After 6 h of incubation at 37 °C, the DNA-containing medium was replaced by fresh medium. Twenty-four h after transfection, cells were either UV irradiated or not, cultured for another 3, 6, 9, or 14 h, and then lysed in 100 μl of lysis buffer (Promega). β-Galactosidase activity was determined by an O-nitrophenol-beta-D-galactopyranoside substrate assay (Promegaβ-galactosidase enzyme assay) and is expressed relative to the amount of protein (Bio-Rad protein assay) recovered from each well. Caspase-3 activity was determined by flow cytometry using phycoerythrin-conjugated polyclonal anti-human active caspase-3 antibodies (Pharmingen). Cells (5 × 105) were washed, fixed, and permeabilized using the FIX & PERM cell permeabilization kit (Caltag Laboratory, Burlingame, CA). After incubation for 5 min at room temperature, 4 ml of pre-cooled absolute methanol were added and incubated for 10 min at 4 °C. Thereafter, cells were washed (5 min, 1500 rpm) in wash buffer (phosphate-buffered saline + 0.1% NaN3 + 10% autologous serum). To permeabilize the cells, the supernatant was removed, and 100 μl of permeabilization reagent and 10 μl of phycoerythrin-conjugated polyclonal, anti-active caspase-3 antibody (Pharmingen), or isotype control antibody were added. After incubation, cells were washed and resuspended in 0.5 ml of 1% formaldehyde and stored at 4 °C until flow cytometric analysis. Loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential was monitored using flow cytometry. Briefly, cells were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min in the presence of chloromethyl-X-rosamine (0.1 μm, fluorescence at 600 nm; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), followed by immediate analysis of fluorochrome incorporation in a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). As a control, cells were incubated throughout culture in the presence of the uncoupling agent carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone (50 μm; Sigma). Hydroethidine at 2 μm (Molecular Probes), a substance that is oxidized by ROS to become ethidium and to emit red, was used to measure superoxide anion. Briefly, cells were exposed for 15 min at 37 °C to hydroethidine. Analyses were performed in a flow cytometer (FACScan). Cells (5 × 106) were lysed in 20 mm Hepes, 250 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μg/ml benzamidine, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Proteins (80 μg/ml) were separated on an SDS-PAGE polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Western blotting was carried out using a monoclonal anti-PARP1 antibody (Pharmingen) and anti-mouse antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Protein bands were detected by chemiluminescence. The appearance of an 85-kDa PARP1 cleavage product was used as a measure of apoptosis. DNA was isolated by proteinase K digestion and phenol/chloroform extraction. DNA samples were digested with the restriction enzymes HinfI and RsaI (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Aliquots of undigested and digested DNA were resolved by 0.5% agarose gel electrophoresis (70 V, 2 h) and examined by ethidium bromide staining for the absence of nonspecific degradation and complete digestion, respectively. A total of 1.5 mg of each digested sample was resolved by 0.7% agarose gel electrophoresis (40 V, 40 h). DNA was Southern blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-C Extra; Amersham Biosciences) and probed as described previously (20Goytisolo F.A. Samper E. Edmonson S. Taccioli G.E. Blasco M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3642-3651Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 25Holt S.E. Glinsky V.V. Ivanova A.B. Glinsky G.V. Mol. Carcinog. 1999; 25: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The membranes were hybridized at 42 °C overnight with a end-labeled32P-(TTAGGG)5 oligonucleotide telomere probe in a buffer containing 25% formamide, Denhardt's solution, saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA, 0.1% SDS, and 100 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. After a 15-min stringency wash at 42 °C in 0.23 SSC, 0.1% SDS the autoradiography signal was digitalized in a phosphorimage scanner (Fuji) using ImageGauge software. All lanes were subdivided into intervals of ∼1 to 2 mm. The mean size of the TRF was estimated using the formula (ODi × Li)/(ODi), where ODi is the density reading from interval I, and Li is the size in kbp of the interval relative to the markers. Mean TRF length was determined over the range of 2.3 to 23.1 kbp markers (broad range) and also on the basis of the intensity of the signal (narrow range), where the intervals averaged were those intervals that were higher than 1% of the total signal in that lane. The median and mode values were also derived on the basis of the narrow range determination. For Flow-FISH, 1 × 106 cells were resuspended in hybridization buffer containing 70% deionized formamide, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 10% fetal calf serum, and 0.3 μg/ml of the telomere-specific fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated probe (fluorescein isothiocyanate-O-CCCATAACTAAACAC-NH2). DNA from samples was heat-denatured for 10 min at 80 °C in a Thermomixer 5436 (Eppendorf, Netheler, Germany) followed by hybridization for 2 h at room temperature. Cells were washed in washing buffer containing 70% deionized formamide, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 10% fetal calf serum, 0.1% Tween 20. After incubation for 1 h at room temperature, cells were washed and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, 10% fetal calf serum, RNase A at 10 μg/ml (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and propidium iodide, incubated for 1 h at room temperature, washed, and analyzed in a FACScan flow cytometer. The telomere fluorescence signal was defined as the mean fluorescence signal in G0/G1 cells after subtraction of the background fluorescence signal (FISH procedure without probe). The flow cytometer was calibrated every day using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled fluorescence Sphero microparticles (Pharmingen). The resulting calibration curve was used for correction of experimental fluorescence values in each experiment. Green fluorescence was measured on a linear scale, and results were expressed in molecular equivalents of soluble fluorochrome units (kMESF) (26Henderson L.O. Marti G.E. Gaigalas A. Hannon W.H. Vogt R.F., Jr. Cytometry. 1998; 33: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The relative telomere length value was calculated by comparing the kMESF values to those obtaining using different cell lines as telomere length controls. Apoptosis was measured using a kit based on the TUNEL (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). In accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, 106 cells fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, washed, and permeabilized for 2 min in ice with 0.1% Triton X-100. After washing, cells were decanted and resuspended in 50 μl of TUNEL reaction mixture (5 μl TUNEL enzyme containing terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase, mixed with 45 μl of TUNEL label containing phycoerythrin-dUTP and dNTP nucleotides) or in 50 μl of TUNEL Label as negative control. After 60 min at 37 °C in a humid atmosphere, cells were washed three times in wash buffer (phosphate-buffered saline + 0.1% NaN3 + 10% autologous serum) and analyzed by flow cytometry. Differences between means were analyzed by analysis of variance followed by the Duncan test. Results are presented as the mean ± S.D. of experiments performed in triplicate. To determine whether DNA damage directly affects telomere length, we simultaneously measured telomere length and apoptosis in normal human PBL, as well as in a human tumor cell line, HL60 (see “Experimental Procedures”), or after treatment with various DNA damaging agents including CPT, etoposide (Topo 1), and UV radiation (Rad UV). For telomere length determinations, we performed quantitative FISH hybridization using a telomere-specific peptide nucleic acid probe, and measured telomere fluorescence by flow cytometry (Flow-FISH; see “Experimental Procedures”). The intensity of telomeric fluorescence is proportional to telomere length (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 1 A shows a representative example of simultaneous analysis by flow cytometry of telomere fluorescence and apoptosis in HL60 cells that were either untreated or treated with CPT (Fig. 1 A). In the absence of CPT treatment, telomeres showed the characteristic distribution of fluorescence and no apoptosis was detected in these cells (R1 peak in Fig. 1 A,upper panel). Following CPT treatment, telomeric Flow-FISH showed a two-peak bimodal distribution of cells, depending on their telomere length/fluorescence, one peak showing normal-length telomeres (R1) and another with dramatically shortened telomeres (R2), as indicated by their lower telomeric fluorescence intensity. On cell sorting of the two peaks and determination of apoptosis, the R2 peak was shown to contain apoptotic cells, whereas the R1 peak contained normal viable cells, indicating that those cells that are undergoing apoptosis also show a dramatic telomere shortening (Fig 1 B,bottom panel). Indeed, all forms of DNA damage tested resulted in increased apoptosis, concomitant with a significant telomere shortening in both the normal PBL and the HL60 cell line (Table I). Table I also shows that those cells with higher rates of apoptosis also had the shortest telomeres (see apoptosis/telomere ratios). In some cases, Flow-FISH results were confirmed by Southern blot analysis of TRF, which contain the TTAGGG telomeric repeats, as well as various lengths of subtelomeric sequences. Fig. 1 B shows that treatment with two other DNA damaging agents, UV and CPT, resulted in the appearance of shorter TRFs, indicating telomere shortening in the treated cells.Table IDNA damage is associated with telomere shorteningCellsTreatmentApoptotic cellsTelomere length% apoptotic cells/telomere length1-aDouble staining in cells sorted from telomere length.% apoptotic cells/telomere length1-aDouble staining in cells sorted from telomere length.%kbR1 peakR2 peakPBLNot treated5 ± 217.3 ± 1.4NDNDCPT34 ± 716.2 ± 1.42/17.195/13.3Topo 123 ± 515.8 ± 1.14/19.997/13.1Rad UV28 ± 1016.3 ± 1.23/17.292/12.7HL60Not treated7 ± 321.3 ± 1.4NDNDCPT63 ± 1218.1 ± 1.43/21.193/15.3Topo 153 ± 1518.9 ± 1.12/21.294/15.5Rad UV21 ± 1419.4 ± 1.23/21.192/15.1Results are mean ± S.D. n = 10.1-a Double staining in cells sorted from telomere length.

A time course study performed in HL60 cells treated with CPT showed that shortening in telomere length is already evident after 2 h in culture and that it peaks after 6 h (Fig. 2). Associated with the decrease in telomere length, an increase was also found in the percentage of apoptotic cells (16 ± 3% through 71 ± 10%) following 12 h of cell culture (Fig. 2). In all experiments more than 90% of the apoptotic cells were found in the low telomere subset; this is in contrast to that observed in the cell subset with normal telomere length in which the apoptosis was less than 5% (data not shown). One of the molecular events associated with DNA damage-induced apoptosis is the cleavage of caspase-3 pro-enzyme into a caspase-3 active form. To determine whether the cells showing short telomeres upon DNA damage also express the active form of caspase-3, flow cytometry was used to simultaneously detect telomere fluorescence and caspase-3 activity (see “Experimental Procedures”). Five different experiments were carried out using CPT as the DNA damage agent, and a representative set of results is shown in Fig. 3 A. The fraction of CPT-treated cells showing the shortest telomeres by Flow-FISH (R2 peak in Fig. 3 A) also exhibited the higher levels of caspase-3 activity (Fig. 3 A). To determine whether the telomere shortening associated with DNA damage-induced apoptosis was dependent on caspase-3 activation, we treated the cells with Ac-DEVD-CHO, a caspase-3 inhibitor. As expected, inhibition of caspase-3 activation by Ac-DEVD-CHO prevented both caspase-3 activity and apoptosis in CTP-treated cells (Fig. 3 B). However, Ac-DEVD-CHO did not prevent telomere shortening in CTP-treated cells (Fig. 3 B). The relationship between apoptosis-induced telomere shortening and mitochondrial function was also addressed using flow cytometry. In particular, we focused on two key mitochondrial events that occur during apoptosis: (i) the generation of ROS, and (ii) the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm). Fig. 4 A shows that the subset of CPT-treated cells showing short telomeres (peak R2) also exhibited a decrease in Δψm, again indicating that cells undergoing apoptosis have shorter telomeres (Fig. 4 A, upper panel). Treatment with CPT also increased ROS production, coincidental with increased apoptosis and concomitant with telomere shortening (Fig. 4 B). Furthermore, complete uncoupling of the mitochondrial membrane potential by addition of protonophore mC1CCP further increased ROS production, accelerated apoptosis, and dramatically increased the percentage of cells with very short telomeres (Fig. 4). Indeed, all CPT-treated cells were in the R2 peak of short telomeres when mC1CCP was used (Fig. 4 A). We found here that the subset of CPT-treated cells that exhibited shorter telomere length (peak R2) also showed PARP1 cleavage (Fig. 5, lane 2). In contrast, PARP1 cleavage was not observed in the subset of cells with normal telomere length (Fig. 5, lane 1). The human tumor cell line HL60 used for this study lacks the p53 gene because of a deletion (27Shimizu T. Pommier Y. Leukemia. 1997; 11: 1238-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of p53 in apoptosis-induced telomere shortening, we transiently transfected wild-type p53 into HL60 cells, and these cells were named HL60SN3. As expected, greater susceptibility to apoptosis was observed in p53-transfected HL60 cells (HL60SN3) upon DNA damage than in HL60 control cells, apoptosis being observed in 87.6 and 69.1% of cells in each case (Fig. 6). Average telomere length was also shorter in the p53-transfected HL60 (HL60SN3) cells than in the HL60 p53-null cells, whether they were untreated or had been treated with CPT (see Table IIand Fig. 6), which agrees with the higher rates of apoptosis in the p53-positive cells (Fig. 6). However, the ratio of apoptosis to telomere length (Table II) was similar in both cases, suggesting that p53 status does not influence the telomere shortening associated with DNA damage-induced apoptosis, at least in HL60 cells (TableII).Table IISimultaneous study of apoptosis and telomere length in wild-type and null p53 HL60 cellsCellsTreatmentApoptotic cellsTelomere length% apoptotic cells/telomere length2-aRatio of % apoptotic cells/telomere length.% apoptotic cells/telomere length2-aRatio of % apoptotic cells/telomere length.%kbR1 peakR2 peakHL60 p53+ (HL60SN3)Not treated4 ± 519.3 ± 1.4NDNDCPT54 ± 816.2 ± 1.42/18.992/15.8HL60 p53−Not treated9 ± 621.1 ± 1.2NDNDCPT69 ± 1217.8 ± 1.33/20.693/16.2Results are mean ± S.D. n = 10.2-a Ratio of % apoptotic cells/telomere length. Open table in a new tab Results are mean ± S.D. n = 10. To study whether telomere shortening triggered by apoptosis could be due, at least in part, to telomerase inhibition in these cells as a consequence of apoptosis, we studied telomerase activity using the telomeric repeat amplification protocol assay in HL60 cells before and after treatment with CPT (see “Experimental Procedures”). Following CPT treatment, a moderate decrease in telomerase activity could be detected in HL60 cells (Fig. 7). Lymphocytes derived from wild-type, second-generation (G2) and fifth-generation (G5) Terc−/− mice that lack telomerase activity were used to further investigate the relationship between susceptibility to apoptosis and telomerase length (11Blasco M.A. Lee H.W. Hande M.P. Samper E. Lansdorp P.M. DePinho R.A. Greider C.W. Cell. 1997; 91: 25-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1775) Google Scholar). Although G2 Terc−/− mice have telomeres that are similar in length to those of wild-types, G5Terc−/− mouse telomeres are an average of 40% shorter than those of the wild-type controls (11Blasco M.A. Lee H.W. Hande M.P. Samper E. Lansdorp P.M. DePinho R.A. Greider C.W. Cell. 1997; 91: 25-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1775) Google Scholar). Furthermore, G5Terc−/− mice display a proportion of chromosomes that lack detectable TTAGGG repeats at the telomeres, resulting in greater chromosomal instability (11Blasco M.A. Lee H.W. Hande M.P. Samper E. Lansdorp P.M. DePinho R.A. Greider C.W. Cell. 1997; 91: 25-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1775) Google Scholar). After CPT treatment (see “Experimental Procedures”), apoptosis occurs in 46 ± 9% of G5Terc−/− lymphocytes, compared with only 6 ± 2% of wild-type lymphocytes (Fig. 8). Similarly, phytohemagglutinin A stimulation also resulted in a rise in lymphocyte apoptosis in G5 Terc−/−mice, in contrast to what we observed in lymphocytes from wild-type mice (Fig. 8). Cells with short telomeres are more sensitive to DNA damage (28Goytisolo F.A. Samper E. Martin-Caballero J. Finnon P. Herrera E. Flores J.M. Bouffler S.D. Blasco M.A. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1625-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 29Wong K.K. Chang S. Weiler S.R. Ganesan S. Chaudhuri J. Zhu C. Artandi S.E. Rudolph K.L. Gottlieb G.J. Chin L. Alt F.W.

Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3381-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In this study, we have demonstrated that cells undergoing apoptosis show dramatically shortened telomeres. Our results indicate that caspase-3 activation is not necessary for the telomere shortening that is associated with DNA damage-induced apoptosis. This also indicates that telomere shortening is one of the early events that occur in apoptosis, prior to the activation of caspases. In this sense a recent report demonstrated that apoptosis induced by hydroxyl radical is not associated with caspase activation (31Ren J.G. Xia H.L. Just T. Dai Y.R. FEBS Lett. 2001; 488: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Two key mitochondrial events that occur during apoptosis are (i) the generation of ROS, and (ii) the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm). We have demonstrated that cells with short telomeres showed a drop in Δψm. We have also observed increased ROS production, coinciding with increased apoptosis and concomitant with telomere shortening. These results support a key role for the mitochondria in telomere length metabolism. PARP1 is activated during the DNA damage response, and it is involved in the base-excision repair (16Bürkle A. Schreiber V. Dantzer F. Oliver F.J. Niedergang C. de Murcia G. Ménissier de Murcia J. de Murcia G. Shall S. DNA Damage and Stress Signaling to Cell Death. Oxford University Press, Oxford, United Kingdom2000: 80-124Google Scholar), being cleaved by caspases into two fragments of 115 and 85 kDa, respectively, during apoptosis. PARP1 has been also suggested as a potential regulator of telomere length and function, although a recent analysis of telomere length and function in a PARP1-deficient mouse suggested that PARP1 activity is not directly involved in telomere length maintenance or in chromosome end-capping (12Samper E. Flores J.M. Blasco M.A. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 800-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Our data support the idea of a relationship between apoptosis-induced telomere shortening and PARP1 degradation. These results further support an association between short telomeres and apoptosis. p53 is a key of damaged DNA and is capable of eliciting either apoptosis or cell cycle arrest, depending on the type of cell involved (14Andoh T. Cell. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 33: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 15Taylor W.R. Stark G.R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1803-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar). p53 is also a sensor of short telomeres, because the phenotypes associated with telomeric dysfunction in the telomerase-deficient mouse model, Terc−/−, are delayed when in a p53-deficient background (11Blasco M.A. Lee H.W. Hande M.P. Samper E. Lansdorp P.M. DePinho R.A. Greider C.W. Cell. 1997; 91: 25-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1775) Google Scholar, 32Chin L. Artandi S.E. Shen Q. Tam A. Lee S.L. Gottlieb G.J. Greider C.W. DePinho R.A. Cell. 1999; 97: 527-538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). Our results show that telomere shortening associated with DNA damage-induced apoptosis is independent of p53 status. Our results also suggest that lower telomerase activity is associated with the process of apoptosis. However, this mild decrease in telomerase activity is unlikely to account for the massive telomere loss that can be observed in apoptotic cells, and further mechanisms will have to be invoked. Cells derived from G5 Terc−/− mice with short telomeres exhibit increased apoptosis after CPT treatment. These results suggest that telomere shortening renders lymphocytes more susceptible to apoptosis after treatment with DNA damaging agents. In summary, we show here that cells that suffer apoptosis after DNA damage exhibit a dramatic loss of telomere length compared with non-apoptotic cells. Furthermore, such telomere shortening does not require caspase-3 activation and can be directly induced by mitochondrial membrane depolarization. All in all, these observations suggest that telomere shortening is one of the early events in DNA damage-induced apoptosis. We also show here that p53 does not influence the telomere shortening associated with apoptosis. This is in agreement with previous observations that telomeric dysfunction triggers apoptosis in human tumor cell lines independently of their p53 status (23Hahn W.C. Stewart S.A. Brooks M.W. York S.G. Eaton E. Kurachi A. Beijersbergen R.L. Knoll J.H. Meyerson M. Weinberg R.A. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 1164-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). Finally, we show that PBL derived from late generation telomerase-deficient mice, which have critically shortened telomeres, are more sensitive to DNA damage-induced apoptosis than the wild-type controls. These results thus indicate that (i) dramatic telomere shortening occurs as an early event of DNA damage-induced apoptosis, and that, in turn, (ii) this telomeric dysfunction may be one of the key events that signal the cellular responses associated with the apoptotic process in a way that is independent of p53 status."

Human patients with type 1 diabetes show an unusually high frequency of wheat gluten-sensitive enteropathy; T-cell response to wheat proteins is increased in some patients, and high concentrations of wheat antibodies in blood have been reported. In both major models of spontaneous type 1 diabetes, the BioBreeding (BB) rat and non-obese diabetic mouse, at least half of the cases are diet-related. In studies of BB rats fed defined semipurified diets, wheat gluten was the most potent diabetes-inducing protein source. A major limitation in understanding how wheat or other dietary antigens affect type 1 diabetes has been the difficulty in identifying specific diabetes-related dietary proteins. To address this issue, we probed a wheat cDNA expression library with polyclonal IgG antibodies from diabetic BB rats. Three clones were identified, and the intensity of antibody binding to one of them, WP5212, was strongly associated with pancreatic islet inflammation and damage. The WP5212 putative protein has high amino acid sequence homology with a wheat storage globulin, Glb1. Serum IgG antibodies from diabetic rats and humans recognized low molecular mass (33–46 kDa) wheat proteins. Furthermore, antibodies to Glb1 protein were found in serum from diabetic patients but not in age-, sex-, and HLA-DQ-matched controls. This study raises the possibility that in some individuals, type 1 diabetes may be induced by wheat proteins. Also, it provides a first candidate wheat protein that is not only antigenic in diabetic rats and human patients but is also closely linked with the autoimmune attack in the pancreas.

Genetic susceptibility to diabetes is inherited, and there is evidence that environmental cofactors strongly influence disease expression as follows: <50% pairwise concordance in identical twins, 3.0% annual increase in global incidence since 1960 (1Onkamo P. Vaananen S. Karvonen M. Tuomilehto J. Diabetologia. 1999; 42: 1395-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar), wide geographic variation, and results from numerous studies in animals showing environmental factors can modify the development of spontaneous autoimmune diabetes (2Scott F.W. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1996; 12: 341-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 3Akerblom H.K. Knip M. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1998; 14: 31-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). A major unresolved issue is the identification of the environmental factors that promote the development of type 1 diabetes (4Notkins A. Lernmark A. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1247-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). This task has proven difficult because of the multifactorial nature of the disease (4Notkins A. Lernmark A. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1247-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 5Atkinson M.A. Eisenbarth G.S. Lancet. 2001; 358: 221-229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar), difficulty in linking past exposures to development of diabetes, lack of knowledge of the environmental antigens, and the large number of predisposing genes in individuals at risk (6Field L.L. Diabetologia. 2002; 45: 21-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The two most studied environmental factors are viruses and diet. Enteroviruses may be involved (7Vaarala O. Klemetti P. Juhela S. Simell O. Hyoty H. Ilonen J. Diabetologia. 2002; 45: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), but as yet a diabetes-inducing enterovirus has not been identified (8Viskari H.R.

Epidemiological evidence of infectious hotspots or traceable routes of infection is lacking (9Patterson C.C. The EURODIAB Substudy 2 Group Diabetologia. 2000; 43: 47-53Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and there are conflicting data with respect to the presence of candidate viruses in the pancreas or immune cells of diabetic patients (10Juhela S.

The highest incidence of spontaneous diabetes in BB1 rats and NOD mice occurs when they are maintained in ultraclean conditions and gnotobiotic animals still develop diabetes (13Rossini A.A.

If animals that are maintained in strict viral antibody-free conditions still develop diabetes then that leaves diet as the major environmental stimulus. Although bovine proteins have been a central focus, a recent blinded, multicenter study demonstrated that a milk-free, wheat-based diet produced the highest diabetes frequency in diabetes-prone BioBreeding (BBdp) rats and NOD mice in three widely separate locations (14Beales P.E.

In addition, an unusually high proportion of patients with type 1 diabetes (2–10%) have wheat gluten-sensitive enteropathy (celiac disease) (20Lampasona V. Bonfanti R. Bazzigaluppi E. Venerando A. Chiumello G. Bosi E. Bonifacio E. Diabetologia. 1999; 42: 1195-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), a rate that is 10–33 times that in the normal population, and ∼1/3 of diabetes patients have antibodies against the celiac disease autoantigen, tissue transglutaminase (20Lampasona V.

Hoffenberg E.J. Rewers M. Eisenbarth G.S. J. Autoimmun. 1999; 13: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Other reports indicate that increased peripheral blood T-cell reactivity to wheat gluten was more frequent in newly diagnosed patients (22Klemetti P. Savilahti E. Ilonen J. Akerblom H.K. Vaarala O. Scand. J. Immunol. 1998; 47: 48-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) than in controls. These data are consistent with the involvement of dietary wheat proteins in diabetes pathogenesis. Although considered to be a T-cell-mediated disease, studies of the prediction and pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes in humans rely heavily on serum autoantibodies as biomarkers of the destructive process. The humoral immune response to selected autoantigens correlates with histologic damage in the pancreas of newly diagnosed patients (23Imagawa A. Hanafusa T. Tamura S. Moriwaki M. Itoh N. Yamamoto K. Iwahashi H. Yamagata K. Waguri M. Nanmo T. Uno S. Nakajima H. Namba M. Kawata S. Miyagawa J.I. Matsuzawa Y. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1269-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Indeed, all of the major autoantigens in type 1 diabetes were identified by virtue of binding by autoantibodies from diabetic individuals. The 64-kDa autoantigen originally reported in BB rat and human islets (24Baekkeskov S. Landin M. Kristensen J.K. Srikanta S. Bruining G.J. Mandrup-Poulsen T. de Beaufort C. Soeldner J.S.

Science. 1984; 224: 1348-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) was first discovered using this approach. This autoantigen was subsequently identified in patients concordant for both the neurologic disease, Stiff-man syndrome and type 1 diabetes, as glutamic acid decarboxylase, a major autoantigen in type 1 diabetes (26Baekkeskov S. Aanstoot H.J. Christgau S. Reetz A. Solimena M. Cascalho M. Folli F. Richter-Olesen H. DeCamilli P. Camilli P.D. Nature. 1990; 347: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar). Despite continued progress, the antigens that initiate and maintain the process leading to β-cell destruction remain poorly understood. In the studies reported here, we used antibodies from rats that spontaneously develop autoimmune diabetes to identify (i) patterns of increased binding to low molecular mass wheat proteins as a function of diabetes risk and age and (ii) individual diabetes-related antigens from wheat by screening a wheat cDNA expression library. We have identified a wheat storage protein, Glb1, that is highly antigenic in diabetic BB rats, the intensity of antibody binding to this protein correlated with inflammation and damage in the pancreatic islets, and it was also recognized by IgG antibodies in serum from diabetic patients but not from controls. This report details studies that identify a first candidate diabetes-related wheat protein. Total RNA was isolated (27Verwoerd T.C. Dekker B.M. Hoekema A.

Caryopses were harvested at ∼10–20 days after pollination, and total RNA was prepared and sent to Stratagene (La Jolla CA) to construct a ZAP Express® Custom cDNA library. The cDNA was inserted into theEcoRI/XhoI cloning site in the amino-terminal region of the lacZ gene in the ZAP Express vector (Stratagene). XL1-Blue-MRF′ Escherichia coli were infected with 3.5 × 104 plaque-forming units per plate (150 × 15 mm) of phage from the wheat ZAP Express Custom cDNA library following the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). Protein expression was induced by the addition of 15 μl of 2 misopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside per 600 μl ofE. coli. Plaque lifts were performed, and the nitrocellulose membranes were screened following the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The primary antibody (diluted 1:200 in skim milk powder in Tris-buffered saline (SMP-TBS)) consisted of pooled sera from seven diabetic BB rats fed a wheat protein (WP) diet from weaning. The BB rat antibodies were pre-absorbed with E. coli phage lysate. The secondary antibody, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated AffiniPure goat anti-rat IgG, Fcγ fragment-specific antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove PA), was diluted 1:5000 in SMP-TBS. Antibody binding was detected using alkaline phosphatase development solution (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2) containing nitro blue tetrazolium chloride (0.3 mg/ml) and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (0.15 mg/ml). Positive clones were detected as dark purple plaques and cored from the agar. The agar plugs were placed in 500 μl of SM buffer (100 mm NaCl, 8 mmMgSO4·7H2O, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.01% (w/v) gelatin) containing 20 μl of chloroform and stored at 4 °C. Screening was repeated until the positive phage reached clonality. Single clone excision was performed to allow in vivo excision and recircularization of the cloned insert, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). Resistance to kanamycin indicated the presence of the pBK-CMV phagemid. Phagemid DNA was prepared for sequencing using a Plasmid Midi Kit (Qiagen, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). The cDNA inserts were sequenced at the University of Ottawa Biotechnology Research Institute on a 373 Stretch sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using standard T3 forward and T7 reverse primers. For clone WP5212, internal primers were designed to sequence the full cDNA insert (forward, 5′-ACCACGGGTTCGTCAAGG-3′; reverse, 5′-AACACCTCCTGCACCTCC-3′). Nucleotide and translated BLAST (28Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J.

Blood samples for serum were obtained from Finnish children newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes but not yet treated with insulin (n = 23; mean age 9.8 ± 3.4 years) and non-diabetic control children (n = 37; mean age 9.9 ± 3.5 years), matched for age, sex, and HLA-DQ major histocompatibility complex class II haplotype. Permission for blood sampling and ethics approval were obtained from the local ethics committee at the University of Turku. Male and female diabetes-prone BioBreeding (BBdp) and control BB rats (BBc) were obtained from the Animal Resources Division of Health Canada (Ottawa). The animals are maintained in laminar flow protected cages under specific pathogen-free conditions. The mean incidence of diabetes in BBdp rats from this colony fed a standard cereal-based diet (31Rao G.N. Fundam. Appl. Toxicol. 1996; 32: 102-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) has remained constant over the past 5 years at 65.3 ± 14.9% (mean ± S.D.). This colony is directly descended from the original diabetic rats discovered at BioBreeding laboratories near Ottawa in 1974 and transferred to Health Canada in 1977. The colony is not completely inbred but has remained a closed colony for the past 25 years, and recent genotyping for selected markers indicates the animals are ∼80% identical at the DNA level. These animals carry the same mutation at the Iddm1/lyp locus as BB/W rats that is attributable to a frameshift deletion in a novel member of the immune-associated nucleotide-related gene family, Ian5 (32MacMurray A.J.

BBc rats are derived from an early subline of animals from the original BB rat colony that does not spontaneously develop diabetes. Tests in sentinel animals indicate the colony is antibody-free with respect to Sendai virus, pneumonia virus of mice, rat corona virus/sialodacryoadenitis virus, Kilham rat virus, Toolan's H-1 virus, reovirus type 3, and Mycoplasma pulmonis. Animals were weaned at 23 days of age, caged in banks of 30 wire-bottom cages, and given free access to food and water. The principles of laboratory animal care as described by the Canadian Council on Animal Care were followed. Animals were tested twice weekly for glucose in urine using Testape (Lily, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) after 60 days of age. Those with a value greater than 2+ were fasted overnight, and blood glucose in tail blood was measured the next morning using a glucometer. Diabetes was diagnosed when fasting blood glucose was >11.1 mmol/liter. Diabetic animals were killed within 24 h of diagnosis by exsanguination while under anesthesia with 3% halothane in oxygen. All histological analyses were performed on coded samples. Hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections of pancreas fixed in Bouin's solution were evaluated at ×100 magnification and confirmed at ×200 magnification using an Axiolab microscope (Zeiss, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Subjective overall rating of pancreatic islet inflammation (insulitis (33Hoorfar J. Scott F.W. Cloutier H.E. J. Nutr. 1991; 121: 908-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar)) was performed using the following scale: 0, normal islet appearance; 1, infiltration in islet periphery only; 2, infiltration concentrated in islet periphery with infiltration in the islet core; 3, infiltration concentrated in one-third of the islet core; 4, infiltration concentrated in up to one-half of the islet core; 5, end stage islets with widespread β-cell destruction and/or core filled with infiltrating mononuclear cells. The mean of 10 islets per animal was used for an overall insulitis score. Inflammation of the islets was also measured as the percent of infiltrated islets. The NTP-2000 diet (Zeigler Bros., Gardners, PA) is an open formula (the percentage composition is known) and nonpurified diet for rodents developed by the United States National Toxicology Program of the NIEHS of the National Institutes of Health. NTP-2000 does not contain any milk protein. This is a mainly plant-based (milk-free) diet with wheat as the major component (37%), followed by corn, soybean meal, alfalfa meal, oat hulls, fish meal, and cellulose. The diet contains ∼14.6% protein, 8.2% fat, 9.9% crude fiber, 52% carbohydrate, 10.7% moisture; the remainder is native and added micronutrients. The NTP-2000 diet used in these studies was irradiated and contained low levels of chemical and microbial contaminants (31Rao G.N. Fundam. Appl. Toxicol. 1996; 32: 102-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). WP semipurified diets were made up of 22.5% wheat gluten (ICN Biochemicals, Cleveland, OH), 50.2% corn starch, 12.0% sucrose, 5.0% corn oil, 5.0% fiber (Solka-Floc), 3.5% AIN-76 (or AIN-93G) mineral mix (ICN), 1.0% AIN-76A (or AIN-93G), vitamin mix (ICN), supplemented with 0.2% choline bitartrate, 0.02% dl-methionine, 0.5%l-lysine, and 0.08% l-threonine to compensate for low sulfur amino acids in wheat proteins. Hydrolyzed casein (HC) diets contained 51.0% corn starch, 12.0% sucrose, 20.0% casein hydrolysate (pancreas S enzymatic hydrolysate, Redstar Bioproducts, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada), 7.0% soybean oil, 5.0% fiber, 3.5% AIN-76 (or AIN-93G) mineral mix, 1.0% AIN-76A (or AIN-93G) vitamin mix, 0.2% choline bitartrate, and 0.3% l-cystine. Both semipurified diets were isocaloric and isonitrogenous. Serum (diluted 1:200 in SMP-TBS) from individual diabetic (n = 7), asymptomatic (no clinical symptoms of diabetes by 150 d; n = 10) BBdp, and BBc (n = 9) rats was used to screen the wheat clones in the same manner as for the library screening. Densitometric analysis of regions of interest on nitrocellulose blots of wheat clones was performed using a Kodak Digital ScienceTM image station 440CF. The mean intensity/pixel for each region of interest was tabulated. A clone was randomly chosen from the library to represent background antibody binding. This clone, WPCON, had an ORF 366 bp long and an expected expression product size of 121 amino acids (Table I). WPCON shared 91% identity across 326 nucleotides with barley ascorbate peroxidase mRNA (Hordeum vulgare, GenBankTM accession number AF411228.1) and shared 96% identity across 86 amino acids with the ascorbate peroxidase protein (H. vulgare, GenBankTMaccession number AAL08496 .1).Table IIdentification and characterization of clones isolated from a wheat cDNA expression libraryCloneDNA homology, % identity/no. bp1-aBLASTn and BLASTx sequence homology searches were performed using the GenBank™ 2 and TIGR Wheat Gene Index3data bases.Amino acid homology, % identity/no. amino acids1-aBLASTn and BLASTx sequence homology searches were performed using the GenBank™ 2 and TIGR Wheat Gene Index3data bases.ORF length1-bThe open reading frame contains 95 bp from the 5′ β-galactosidase gene.Putative protein length (amino acids)1-cDetermined using Clone Manager 6® (Sci-Ed Software (2002) website address: www.scied.com/ses_cm6.htm, Scientific and Educational Software, Durham, NC).bpWP5212Triticum aestivum (wheat) storage protein (Glb 1) gene, 90%/1387T. aestivum (wheat) storage protein, 80%/6421890629WP12111Clone CNW03PL453 ITEC CNW wheat powdery mildew-resistant line, T. aestivum, 96%/138Unknown protein, A. thaliana, 63%/144789262WP23112Arabidopsis thaliana DNA chromosome 3, BAC clone T16L24, 96%/542Putative protein, A. thaliana, 62%/150624207Clone TA012XXX, Brevor mature embryo ABA library (T. aestivum), 100%/511WPCONAscorbate peroxidase (Hordeum vulgare) 91%/326Ascorbate peroxidase (H. vulgare), 96%/863661211-a BLASTn and BLASTx sequence homology searches were performed using the GenBank™ 2 and TIGR Wheat Gene Index3data bases.1-b The open reading frame contains 95 bp from the 5′ β-galactosidase gene.1-c Determined using Clone Manager 6® (Sci-Ed Software (2002) website address: www.scied.com/ses_cm6.htm, Scientific and Educational Software, Durham, NC). Open table in a new tab Proteins were extracted from wheat gluten powder (ICN) using lysis buffer as described previously (34Gorg A. Postel W. Gunther S. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 531-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). Samples were electrophoresed in 10% SDS-PAGE gels (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar), transferred to nitrocellulose, and blocked with 5% (w/v) SMP-TBS, pH 7.5. Blots were incubated with sera diluted in SMP-TBS, 1:600. Samples were from rats at different risk of diabetes and fed WP diet as follows: control BBc (n = 10), asymptomatic BBdp (no clinical symptoms of diabetes by 120 days, n = 7), and pre-diabetic BBdp animals (developed overt diabetes before 120 days, n = 7, or animals with overt diabetes, BBd). Sera from individual patient (n = 23) and non-diabetic HLA-DQ-matched control children (n = 37) were diluted 1:50. Following 5 times 5-min washes with TBS containing 1% (v/v) Tween 20, the membrane was exposed to horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (Fcγ-fragment specific; Cedarlane Laboratories, Hornby, Ontario, Canada) or rabbit anti-human total IgG antibody (Dako), diluted 1:2000 with SMP-TBS. Bands were visualized using ECL according to the manufacturer's instructions (ECL-Western blotting detection, AmershamBiosciences) and quantified by densitometry. Digital images of the Western blot films were acquired using the Kodak Digital ScienceTM image station 440CF (Rochester, NY) and analyzed using the Kodak Digital ScienceTM one-dimensional image software (New Haven, CT). 150 μg of wheat gluten proteins in lysis buffer were added to the IEF buffer (4% CHAPS, 7 m urea, 2m thiourea, 40 mm Trizma base, 2 mmtributylphosphine, and 0.4% Bio-lyte 3/10 (Bio-Rad)) and applied to rehydrated Ready Strips (Bio-Rad) with an immobilized linear pH gradient from pH 3 to 10. Wheat proteins were focused at 21 °C for a total of 100,000 V-h on the Protean IEF cell (Bio-Rad), reduced with 20 mg/ml of dithiothreitol, and alkylated with 25 mg/ml iodoacetamide. Proteins were separated in the second dimension in 10% SDS-PAGE gels by electrophoresis at 30 mA for 15 min and 60 mA for 2 h, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and blocked using SMP-TBS overnight at 4 °C. Serum was pooled from the 23 patients and 37 controls, diluted 1:500 in SMP-TBS buffer, and used to probe two-dimensional Western blots (1 h at 4 °C). The secondary antibody, rabbit anti-human total IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Dako), was diluted to 1:2000 with SMP-TBS buffer and incubated with the membranes for 30 min at 4 °C. Antibody binding was visualized using ECL as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences) and analyzed using two-dimensional analysis software (PDQuest, Bio-Rad). Two-dimensional gels of wheat gluten proteins were stained with a non-fixing silver stain (36Gharahdaghi F. Weinberg C.R. Meagher D.A. Imai B.S. Mische S.M. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). Excised gel plugs were digested overnight at 37 °C with 200 ng of modified sequencing grade trypsin (Promega) in the ProGestTM automatic digester (Genomic Solutions, Ann Arbor, MI) as described (36Gharahdaghi F. Weinberg C.R. Meagher D.A. Imai B.S. Mische S.M. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). Rapid capillary LC-MS/MS was performed using a Waters CapLC liquid chromatograph (Waters, Milford, MA) coupled to a Q-TOF2 mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK) with an electrospray ionization interface. The digested extracts were redissolved in 5% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.5% acetic acid, and 10 μl was loaded onto a 0.3 × 5 mm C18 micro pre-column cartridge (Dionex/LC-Packings) for each analysis. Rapid peptide elution was achieved using a linear gradient of 5–60% acetonitrile, 0.2% formic acid in 6 min (flow rate of 1 μl/min). The mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent acquisition mode. Comparisons between sample populations were made using one-way ANOVA and Scheffe's or LSD post hoc tests (Statistica version 4.5, StatSoft Inc., 1993, Tulsa, OK). Fisher's Exact test (two-tailed) was used to compare the frequency of individuals with antibody reactivity to wheat proteins. Pearson Product-Moment correlation was used to determine r andp values. Survival analysis using the log Rank test was used to compare the effect of different diets on diabetes incidence (Statistica). Animals fed a non-purified, defined, mainly wheat-based (31Rao G.N. Fundam. Appl. Toxicol. 1996; 32: 102-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), NTP-2000 diet showed the highest incidence of diabetes (n = 6 experiments, total of 169 rats, 65.3 ± 14.9%, Fig. 1). When comparing only defined, isocaloric, and isonitrogenous semi-purified diets with amino acids from wheat gluten or hydrolyzed casein, there were more cases of diabetes in BBdp rats fed WP diets (n = 12 experiments, total of 282 rats, 50.6 ± 11.1%) compared with BBdp rats fed a protective HC diet (n = 14 experiments, total of 322 rats, 18.8 ± 10.6% Fig. 1; ANOVA/LSD, p < 1 × 10−5). A wheat cDNA expression library consisting of over one million recombinant phage was generated. The primary screening of the library, using pooled diabetic BB rat serum (n = 7), yielded 48 positive clones. Eight of these were found to be true positives and were repeatedly screened until"
https://openalex.org/W2140484793,"The activity of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) can be modulated by a diverse spectrum of drugs ranging from full agonists to partial agonists, antagonists, and inverse agonists. The vast majority of these ligands compete with native ligands for binding to orthosteric binding sites. Allosteric ligands have also been described for a number of GPCRs. However, little is known about the mechanism by which these ligands modulate the affinity of receptors for orthosteric ligands. We have previously reported that Zn(II) acts as a positive allosteric modulator of the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR). To identify the Zn2+ binding site responsible for the enhancement of agonist affinity in the β2AR, we mutated histidines located in hydrophilic sequences bridging the seven transmembrane domains. Mutation of His-269 abolished the effect of Zn2+ on agonist affinity. Mutations of other histidines had no effect on agonist affinity. Further mutagenesis of residues adjacent to His-269 demonstrated that Cys-265 and Glu-225 are also required to achieve the full allosteric effect of Zn2+ on agonist binding. Our results suggest that bridging of the cytoplasmic extensions of TM5 and TM6 by Zn2+ facilitates agonist binding. These results are in agreement with recent biophysical studies demonstrating that agonist binding leads to movement of TM6 relative to TM5.

G protein-coupled receptors β2-adrenergic receptor wild type transmembrane domain dihydroalprenelol (−)-isoproterenol 723, (2-amino-4,5-dimethyl-3-thienyl)-[3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]methanone guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)1 respond to a wide range of structurally diverse natural and synthetic ligands. The majority of these ligands are classified as orthosteres. They compete for binding with the natural ligand, and their binding site is predicted to overlap with that of the natural ligand. Allosteric modulation of ligand binding has been observed for several GPCRs. Allosteric modulators include physiologically relevant ions as well as small organic molecules. A large number of compounds allosterically increase binding affinity for muscarinic receptor antagonists. Allosteric regulation can be demonstrated in all five subtypes of muscarinic receptors, but the m2 receptor appears to be the most sensitive (1Tucek S. Proska J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 205-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Although most allosteric modulators for the muscarinic receptors affect antagonist binding, allosteric modulation of agonist binding has also been described (2Jakubik J. Bacakova L., El- Fakahany E.E. Tucek S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 172-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In addition to the muscarinic receptor, allosteric compounds have been identified for the A1 adenosine receptor. The 2-amino-3-benzoylthiophene, PD 81,723, has been shown to enhance agonist binding and G protein coupling in a Mg2+-dependent manner (3Bhattacharya S. Linden J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1265: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 4Musser B. Mudumbi R.V. Liu J. Olson R.D. Vestal R.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 288: 446-454PubMed Google Scholar). The function of several Gi-coupled receptors has been shown to be modulated by amilioride analogs and by Na+. This effect has been particularly well characterized for the α2 adrenergic receptor (5Limbird, L. E. (1984) Am. J. Physiol. E59–E68Google Scholar, 6Horstman D.A. Brandon S. Wilson A.L. Guyer C.A.

Sibley D.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 296: 359-363PubMed Google Scholar). Na+ both uncouples the receptor from Gi and reduces agonist affinity. A conserved Asp residue within the cytoplasmic side of TM2 is responsible for the Na+-sensitive binding of the α2A receptor (6Horstman D.A. Brandon S. Wilson A.L. Guyer C.A. Cragoe E.J. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21590-21595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the D4 dopamine receptor (9Schetz J.A. Sibley D.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 296: 359-363PubMed Google Scholar). This Na+ sensitivity may be physiologically relevant, as relatively high local concentrations of Na+ ions may accumulate at the cytoplasmic side of the receptor after membrane depolarization. Recently the function of the calcium receptor has been shown to be positively modulated by certain l-amino acids (10Conigrave A.D. Quinn S.J. Brown E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4814-4819Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 11Conigrave A.D. Quinn S.J. Brown E.M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 401-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This finding may be physiologically relevant as nutrient and Ca2+ homeostasis may be coordinately regulated. We recently reported that Zn2+ has complex effects on the functional properties of the β2AR (12Swaminath G. Steenhuis J. Kobilka B. Lee T.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Zn2+binding to a high affinity site (IC50 ∼5 μm) enhances agonist affinity, whereas Zn2+binding to one or more low affinity sites (IC50 >500 μm) inhibits antagonist binding and yet slows antagonist dissociation. To identify the Zn2+ binding site responsible for the positive allosteric effect of Zn2+ on agonist affinity, we mutated seven histidines located in intracellular and extracellular hydrophilic sequences connecting transmembrane (TM) domains. Mutation of His-269 dramatically reduced the effect of Zn2+ on agonist affinity. Mutations of other histidines had no effect. Further mutagenesis of residues predicted to be adjacent to His-269 in the three-dimensional structure of the β2AR revealed that Cys-265 and Glu-225 are also required to achieve the full allosteric effect of Zn2+ on agonist binding. Our results suggest that bridging of the cytoplasmic extensions of TM5 and TM6 by Zn2+ facilitates agonist binding. These results are in agreement with recent biophysical studies demonstrating that agonist binding leads to movement of TM6 relative to TM5. The cDNA sequence encoding the human β2AR, epitope-tagged at the amino terminus with a cleavable influenza-hemagglutinin signal sequence followed by the FLAG epitope (IBI, New Haven, CT) and tagged with six histidines at the carboxyl terminus, was used as a template for mutagenesis (13Kobilka B.K. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 231: 269-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). This cDNA was subcloned in baculovirus expression vector pACMP2 atBamHI/EcoRI site. Mutations were generated by the polymerase chain reaction-mediated mutagenesis using Pfupolymerase (Stratagene). The polymerase-generated DNA fragments were subcloned into pACMP2 plasmid, and the single mutants H93A, H172A, H178A, H241A, H256A, H269A, H296A, and E225A and double mutants E225A/H269A and E225A/C265A were confirmed by DNA sequencing and restriction analysis. The construct C265Aβ2AR was a gift from Dr. Charles Parnot. HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Stable cell lines were obtained for wild-type β2AR (WTβ2AR) and the mutants in the presence of 0.5 mg/ml G418. SF-hβ2-6H and the mutant constructs in the baculovirus expression vector pACMP2 were co-transfected with linearized SapphireTM Baculovirus DNA into SF9 insect cells using the Insectin Plus transfection kit (Invitrogen). The resulting viruses were harvested 4–5 days and amplified for another 4–5 days to obtain a high titer virus. SF9 insect cells were grown in suspension culture in SF-900 II medium (Invitrogen) containing 5% fetal calf serum (Gemini, Calabasas, CA) and 0.1 mg/ml gentamicin (Invitrogen). For membrane preparation the cells were grown in 100-ml cultures. Cells were infected with a 1:100 dilution of a high titer virus stock at a density of 3.5–5.5 × 106 cells/ml and harvested after 48 h by centrifugation for 10 min at 5000 × g. The resulting cell pellets were kept at −80 °C until further use. All of the membrane preparation steps were done at 4 °C as described elsewhere (12Swaminath G. Steenhuis J. Kobilka B. Lee T.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested and washed once with phosphate-buffer saline, recentrifuged, and then resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, with 1 mm EDTA) containing protease inhibitors (leupeptin and benzamidine at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml) and lysed using 25 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer. Nuclei and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation (5 min at 500g). The supernatant was removed and centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, buffer alone containing protease inhibitors and recentrifuged. Membranes were resuspended at 0.5–1.5 mg/ml in binding buffer (75 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) and stored at −80 °C until use. All of the binding assays were done on SF9 membranes expressing either the WTβ2AR or mutant receptors. The saturation binding assays were done by incubating the membranes (20–50 μg) with 10 different concentrations of the antagonist [3H]DHA between 100 pm and 20 nm with or without 1 mm Zn(II). Competition assays were done by incubating the membranes with different concentrations of agonist isoproterenol (10−9 to 10−3m) with or without 20 μmZn(II). Zn2+ modified competition assays were also done similar to competition assays expect that membranes were incubated with different concentrations of Zn(II) (0.3–300 μm) in the presence or absence of 100 nm isoproterenol. All of the assays were performed for 1 h at room temperature with shaking at 230 rpm. Competition assays were carried out with 1 nm[3H]DHA around the K D. Binding data were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis using Prism from GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA. Inhibitory constant (KI values) were calculated from IC50 values using the Cheng-Prusoff equation:KI = IC50/(1 + [ligand]/K D). The effect of Zn2+ on the rate of antagonist dissociation from β2AR was examined by measuring thek off in the absence and presence of 1 mm Zn2+. Membranes were suspended in 75 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, with 1 nm[3H]DHA for 30 min at room temperature (shaking at 230 rpm). At time zero, total binding was determined, and a saturating amount of cold alprenolol (final 10−5m) or cold alprenolol (final 10−5m) and ZnCl2 (final 1 mm) was added to tubes containing membranes and [3H]DHA. Bound [3H]DHA was measured at 5-min intervals. The production of cAMP was determined by adenylyl cyclase activation FlashPlate assay (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), in which 96-well plates are coated with solid scintillant to which anti-cyclic cAMP antibody has been bound. Briefly, HEK293 cells expressing stable human β2AR and mutants were detached, washed four times in 1× phosphate-buffered saline without Ca2+/Mg2+, and then resuspended to a density of ∼2 × 106 cells/ml in stimulation buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline without calcium/magnesium, with 700 μm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 0.1% protease-free bovine serum albumin, and 0.09% chloroacetamide) from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Ligands (25 μl each) were diluted in Milli-Q water with various concentrations and dispensed to the FlashPlate. Resuspended whole cells (50 μl) were added to the ligand-loaded plate and stimulated at 37 °C for 10 min before lysing cells with 100 μl of Detection Buffer (Invitrogen) containing [125I]cAMP, permeabilizer, and 0.09% sodium azide as provided by the manufacturer. After 2 h of incubation at room temperature, radioactivity was counted. To determine the concentrations of cAMP in the sample, cAMP standards were run in the same plate and expressed as pmol/well. The expression level of mutant β2ARs in stable HEK293 cell lines was assessed using a single saturating concentration of [3H]dihydroalprenelol (10 nm). Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit. To examine the effect of Zn2+ on both agonist and antagonist binding to the β2AR, we performed a modified competition experiment in which the β2AR is incubated with 1 nm[3H]DHA and varying concentrations of Zn2+ in the presence or absence of 100 nm isoproterenol. These studies are also done with 10 μm GTPγS to eliminate the effects of Gs on agonist binding. In the absence of isoproterenol we observed a reduction of [3H]DHA binding only at relatively high concentrations of Zn2+ (>500 μm). Agonist binding is more sensitive to Zn2+. In the presence of increasing concentrations of Zn2+, 100 nm isoproterenol becomes more effective at displacing [3H]DHA (Fig. 1 A). The maximal effect of Zn2+ on isoproterenol affinity occurs at ∼20 μm with an IC50 of 3.0 μm (12Swaminath G. Steenhuis J. Kobilka B. Lee T.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These effects of Zn2+ can also be observed in more conventional saturation (Fig. 1 B) and competition (Fig. 1 C) binding studies. At 1 mm Zn2+ we observe a decrease in B max and an increase in the K D for [3H]DHA (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, the affinity of the β2AR for isoproterenol is enhanced in the presence of 20 μmZn2+ (Fig. 1 C). Histidines are often involved in the formation of Zn2+ binding sites in proteins (14Harvey R.J. Thomas P. James C.H. Wilderspin A. Smart T.G. J. Physiol. 1999; 520: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 15Regan L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 280-285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the Zn2+ binding site responsible for the positive allosteric effect on agonist binding to the β2AR would be located in extracellular loops. However, mutations of histidines 93, 172, 178, and 296 (Fig. 2) had no effect on the positive allosteric effect of Zn2+ (data not shown). We therefore examined the role of cytoplasmic histidines (His-241, His-256, and His-269) (Fig. 2). Of these, only H269A exhibited a reduced response to Zn2+. The effect of Zn2+ on both agonist and antagonist affinity is nearly abolished in H269A (Fig. 3; TablesI and II). Of interest, we found that H269A mutation does not alter the effect of 1 mmZn2+ on the dissociation rate of [3H]DHA (data not shown), indicating that the site responsible for the positive allosteric effect of Zn2+on agonist binding is different from the binding site responsible for the effect of Zn2+ on the dissociate rate of antagonists.Figure 3Effect of Zn2+ on antagonist and agonist binding in H269Aβ2AR expressed in SF9 membranes.

In addition to histidine, cysteine, aspartate, and glutamate can contribute to the formation of a Zn2+binding site (16Vallee B.L. Falchuk K.H. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 79-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Maret W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12325-12327Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We therefore used a three-dimensional model based on rhodopsin (18Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A., Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5039) Google Scholar) to identify cysteines as well as acidic residues in proximity to His-269. This analysis identified the closest candidates as Cys-265 on the cytoplasmic end of TM6 and Glu-225 on the cytoplasmic end of TM5. Mutation of Glu-225 and Cys-265 to alanine had no significant effect on either agonist or antagonist affinity in the absence of Zn2+ (Tables I and II). However, both mutant receptors had altered agonist and antagonist responses to Zn2+. For both mutants there was a smaller decrease in antagonist affinity in the presence of 1 mmZn2+ (Table I) and a smaller increase in agonist affinity in the presence of 20 μm Zn2+ (Table II). The effect of Zn2+ on agonist affinity is almost abolished for the double mutant E225A/H269A and completely abolished when C265A is combined with H269A (Tables I and II, and Fig. 4). We previously reported that low concentrations of Zn2+ enhance cAMP accumulation by submaximal concentrations of isoproterenol in intact cells (12Swaminath G. Steenhuis J. Kobilka B. Lee T.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To determine whether the Zn2+ site formed by His-269, Cys-265, and Glu-225 is also responsible for the effect of Zn2+ on cAMP accumulation, we generated stable cell lines expressing the wild-type β2AR as well as H269A, C265A, C265A/H2269A, and E225A/H269A. Fig. 5 A shows the effect of Zn2+ on cAMP accumulation in the presence and absence of 0.1 nm isoproterenol in nontransfected HEK293 cells and in HEK293 cells stably expressing the wild-type β2AR. Isoproterenol at 0.1 nm stimulates a submaximal cAMP response that is augmented by 10 μm Zn2+. As shown in Fig. 5 B, this effect of Zn2+ was also observed in all of the cell lines expressing mutant receptors. Therefore, the Zn2+ binding site responsible for allosteric modulation of agonist binding is not responsible for the effect of Zn2+ on cAMP accumulation in intact cells. Allosteric ligands have been identified for only a small number of GPCRs including the M2 muscarinic receptor (19Ellis J. Seidenberg M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1451-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), the A1 adenosine receptor (3Bhattacharya S. Linden J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1265: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and the Ca2+-sensitive receptor (11Conigrave A.D. Quinn S.J. Brown E.M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 401-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Binding of the well characterized muscarinic allosteric ligand gallamine has been mapped to extracellular loops 2 and 3 (20Gnagey A.L. Seidenberg M. Ellis J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1245-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 21Leppik R.A. Miller R.C. Eck M. Paquet J.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 983-990PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed that, when bound to gallamine, extracellular loops 2 and 3 may form a plug over the binding pocket, thereby slowing the dissociation rate (22Shi L. Javitch J.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 437-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Another well characterized allosteric modulator of GPCR function is ionized sodium. Sodium ions act as negative allosteric regulators for a number of Gi-coupled receptors including the α2Aadrenergic receptor and the D2 and D4 dopamine receptor. In contrast to the extracellular location of the allosteric binding site for gallamine in muscarinic receptors, sodium sensitivity is mediated at the cytoplasmic surface of the receptor. A highly conserved Asp at the cytoplasmic end of TM2 has been shown to be critical for this effect of sodium (6Horstman D.A. Brandon S. Wilson A.L. Guyer C.A. Cragoe E.J. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21590-21595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Schetz J.A. Sibley D.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 296: 359-363PubMed Google Scholar). Our mutagenesis studies localize the binding site responsible for the positive allosteric effect of Zn2+ on agonist affinity to the third intracellular loop. This Zn2+ binding site consists of Cys-265 and His-269 on the cytoplasmic extension of TM6 and Glu-225 on the cytoplasmic extension of TM5. This location is of particular interest because recent biophysical studies from our laboratory demonstrate that agonist binding is associated with a movement of Cys-265 on TM6 relative to TM5 (23Ghanouni P. Steenhuis J.J. Farrens D.L. Kobilka B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5997-6002Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). These studies were performed on purified β2AR labeled at Cys-265 with fluorescein. Moreover, cysteine cross-linking studies on the M3 muscarinic receptor provide evidence for agonist-induced movement of the cytoplasmic end of TM5 relative to TM6 (24Ward S.D. Hamdan F.F. Bloodworth L.M. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2247-2257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus, Zn2+may form a bridge between TM5 and TM6. This bridge is likely to alter the position of TM5 relative to TM6. On the basis of these observations, we speculate that Zn2+ binding approximates or stabilizes the conformational changes induced by agonists. It is of interest that this Zn2+ binding site is not responsible for the ability of Zn2+ to augment cAMP accumulation by submaximal concentrations of isoproterenol (Fig. 5) or for the effect of Zn2+ on antagonist dissociation (data not shown). In conclusion, we have identified the Zn2+ binding site responsible for the positive effect of Zn2+ ions on agonist binding to the β2AR. Our results suggest that Zn2+ stabilizes an orientation of TM6 relative to TM5 that favors agonist binding and inhibits antagonist binding. These results provide further evidence for the role of TM5 and TM6 in agonist-induced conformational changes."
https://openalex.org/W1987180743,"nNOS, anchored to the sarcolemma through its interactions with the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex, is dramatically reduced in dystrophin-deficient mdx mice and Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients. Recent evidence suggests that loss of nNOS in dystrophin-deficient muscle may contribute significantly to the progression of muscle pathology through a variety of mechanisms. To investigate whether nNOS plays a role in other forms of muscular dystrophy, we analyzed protein expression of nNOS in several sarcoglycan-deficient animal models of muscular dystrophy as well as patients with primary mutations in the sarcoglycan genes. Primary mutations in alpha-, beta-, delta-, and gamma-sarcoglycan result in autosomal recessive limb girdle muscular dystrophy (AR-LGMD). We report that loss of the sarcoglycan-sarcospan complex in muscle causes a dramatic reduction in the levels of nNOS expression at the membrane, even in the presence of normal dystrophin and syntrophin expression. Furthermore, we show that expression of three out of four sarcoglycans is not sufficient to maintain nNOS at the sarcolemma. Our data suggest that loss of nNOS may contribute to muscle pathology in AR-LGMD with primary mutations in the sarcoglycans."

It has been reported that basal, ciliated, and secretory cells form a coordinated airway defense mechanism against inhaled air pollutants (1Wu R. Zhao Y.H. Chang M.M. Eur. Respir. J. 1997; 10: 2398-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Goblet cells in the airway epithelium and secretory cells in the submucosal glands are the major contributors to mucus secretion (2Kim K.C. McCracken K. Lee B.C. Shin C.Y., Jo, M.J. Lee C.J. Ko K.H. Eur. Respir. J. 1997; 10: 2644-2649Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 3Jeffery P.K. Li D. Eur. Respir. J. 1997; 10: 1655-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The secretory products contributed by each cell type are currently unknown. Therefore, identifying secretory products for each cell type provides a marker to either assess the functional role of a specific cell type in maintaining homeostasis of mucociliary function or evaluate its role in the pathogenesis of various airway diseases.Airway epithelial secretory proteins are divided into two major classes: mucins and non-mucins. Mucins are major secretory components that play an essential role in protecting and lubricating the airway epithelial surface. Mucins constitute a very large molecular weight glycoprotein family that are poly-dispersed and heavilyO-glycosylated (4Seregni E. Botti C. Massaron S. Lombardo C. Capobianco A. Bogni A. Bombardieri E. Tumori. 1997; 83: 625-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 5Kim Y.S. Gum J., Jr. Brockhausen I. Glycoconj. J. 1996; 13: 693-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Currently, there are at least 12 mucin genes identified. MUC1, MUC2,MUC4, MUC5AC, and MUC5B are expressed at relatively high levels in the human respiratory tracts compared with other mucin genes (6Reid C.J. Gould S. Harris A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 17: 592-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 7Aust M.R. Madsen C.S. Jennings A. Kasperbauer J.L. Gendler S.J. Am. J.

Rhinology. 1998; 36: 146-152PubMed Google Scholar). Non-mucin secretory proteins include lysozyme, lactoferrin, peroxidase, and antileukoprotease. These proteins contribute directly or indirectly to the pulmonary defense mechanism against infectious pathogens (12Basbaum C.B. Jany B. Finkbeiner W.E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 13Finkbeiner W.E. Respir. Physiol. 1999; 118: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The cell of origin for most of these non-mucin secretory proteins is the serous cell contained within submucosal glands (11Basbaum C.B. CIBA Found. Symp. 1984; 109: 4-19PubMed Google Scholar, 12Basbaum C.B. Jany B. Finkbeiner W.E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 13Finkbeiner W.E. Respir. Physiol. 1999; 118: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, there is still a large gap of information about the nature of these secretory proteins and their role in pulmonary defense.Vitamin A and its metabolites, retinoids, are critical to the maintenance of mucociliary functions and secretions in the airway epithelium. In vitamin A-depleted animals, the airway epithelial surface changes from a mucociliary cell layer to a protective, squamous cell surface. This alteration can be reversed upon the addition of retinoids, such as all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA)1 (14Chytil F. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 986-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Similar changes can be demonstrated in vitro in primary cultures of airway epithelial cells derived from humans and other species (15Koo J.S. Yoon J.H. Gray T. Norford D. Jetten A.M. Nettesheim P. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 20: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 16Emura M. Mohr U. Riebe M. Aufderheide M. Dungworth D.L. In Vitro Cell Dev.

Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1990; 3: 467-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Despite efforts by researchers, effects of retinoids on airway epithelia are not completely understood. We propose that retinoids induce differentiation through sequential changes in gene expression. This is based on observations that retinoid administration coincides with airway cell differentiation.To test this hypothesis, we employed a two-color-based differential hybridization on a high density cDNA microarray membrane, which contained 30,000 cDNA spots (18Chen J.J., Wu, R. Yang P.C. Huang J.Y. Sher Y.P. Han M.H. Kao W.C. Lee P.J. Chiu T.F. Chang F. Chu Y.W., Wu, C.W. Peck K. Genomics. 1998; 51: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 19Wu R., Di, Y.P. Chen J.W. Chimel K. Juarez M. Chang M.J. Soref C.M. Zhao Y.H. Chen Y. Zhou J.W., Wu, K. Kao T.L. Peck K. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1999; 159: A507Google Scholar). These cDNA clones were individually selected from a pool of cDNA libraries created from human tracheobroncheal epithelial (TBE) cells. The membrane was differentially hybridized with cDNA probes derived from ATRA-treated and -depleted cultures of primary human TBE cells. Several ATRA-responsive cDNA clones were identified, and one of them, theDD4 clone, encoded the cDNA sequence of a novel gene. In this report, we characterize the expression of this novel gene in airway epithelia. Results from our studies suggest that theDD4 clone encodes a novel gene product that corresponds to a secretory protein specifically produced by epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract. Based on the characteristics of this gene, we subsequently named this gene spurt (secretoryprotein in upper respiratorytracts).DISCUSSIONIn this study, we utilized a microarray assay to identify an ATRA-inducible, novel secretory protein, spurt, which is secreted by conducting airway epithelia. Our results indicate retinoids regulate spurt mRNA and protein levels in cultured airway epithelial (TBE) cells. We observed that ATRA significantly increases spurt gene expression. Increased expression occurs after several days of ATRA treatment and with higher doses of retinoids.Furthermore, we demonstrated that specific cell culture manipulations enhance spurt expression. Expression of spurtincreased in a progressive fashion as the culture conditions were changed from tissue culture plates alone (TC) to biphasic conditions without and with collagen gel substrata. Optimized expression ofspurt message occurred when airway epithelial cells were plated on a collagen gel substratum with air-liquid interface culture conditions (BI-CG). These data suggest that expression ofspurt occurs as the airway epithelial cell layer develops toward the more mature stages of differentiation.In support of this idea, it has been observed that the most suitable culture conditions to promote airway mucociliary differentiationin vitro include the combination of an air-liquid interface, a collagen gel substratum, and retinoid supplementation (1Wu R. Zhao Y.H. Chang M.M. Eur. Respir. J. 1997; 10: 2398-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Under these culture conditions, human airway epithelial cells develop into a fully differentiated cell layer with multiple mucociliary functions. In the absence of one or more of these conditions, the differentiated features are not as extensive. In addition, spurt gene expression in vivo appears to be limited to specialized cells in the human airway. In situ hybridization of lung tissue and Northern blot analyses of RNA samples from various human tissues demonstrated an abundance of spurt message in the upper respiratory tract. Gene expression was particularly high in serous cells within the submucosal glands.Based on the sequence information obtained from our genomic cloning effort and information in the public data base, full-lengthspurt sequence consists of nine exons and eight introns that spans a genomic DNA region of 7,313 bp (spurt genomic clone GenBankTM accession number AF421369). Because the matched BAC clone, bA49G10, is designated to contig 158 of chromosome 20, the corresponding cytogenetic chromosome position of the spurtgene is assigned to 20q11.21. In addition, we have found that twospurt transcripts, a short and a long form, exist in EST data bases and our airway epithelial cell specific cDNA library. These two transcripts differ at the 3′-untranslated region. This observation supports the proposal that there is alternative splicing ofspurt in the 9th exon that generates two transcripts with the same ORF. How this alternative splicing affects the function and expression of the spurt gene is currently unknown.It is necessary to point out that several human EST clones identified in GenBankTM and other sequence data bases show high sequence alignments with our spurt clone, but all of them have shorter inserts than ours and contain only partial sequence information. Importantly, although several different researchers independently identified spurt-like EST clones, all of the EST clones were identified in cDNA libraries from human lung or olfactory epithelium. These observations further support our finding that spurt is a human airway-specific gene.To elucidate the putative function of spurt, protein structural analyses were performed using several software packages including Geneworks, Lasergene, GCG, and web-based search sites. These analyses predicted spurt to be a globular protein with slightly hydrophobic properties. Furthermore, protein analyses by SignalP predicted a 19-amino acid secretory signal peptide at the N-terminal region of spurt. This signal peptide sequence is homologous to other secretory proteins such as the von Ebner minor salivary gland protein (46Moro I. Umemura S. Crago S.S. Mestecky J. J.

Based on this information, we generated a specific polyclonal antibody, spurtAb2, to detect the protein expression of spurt. Examination of sputum samples confirmed the secretory nature of the protein. We easily detectedspurt protein in sputum samples by Western blot analyses using spurtAb2 antibody.Although we have identified spurt to be an upper airway-specific secretory protein, the function of spurt is still unknown. Despite an extensive blast search, no human protein with known function shows more than 40% homology to the deduced amino acid sequence of spurt. A separate group identified a “mouse unknown protein,” plunc (palate,lung, and nasal epithelium clone) (43Weston W.M. LeClair E.E. Trzyna W. McHugh K.M. Nugent P. Lafferty C.M., Ma, L. Tuan R.S. Greene R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13698-13703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) with 74% homology to the human spurt deduced amino acid sequence. Mouse plunc was identified through mRNA differential display methods as a gene up-regulated during palate closure of the developing mouse embryo. Similarly, Iwao et al. (44Iwao K. Watanabe T. Fujiwara Y. Takami K. Kodama K. Higashiyama M. Yokouchi H. Ozaki K. Monden M. Tanigami A. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 91: 433-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) identified a novel human lung-specific gene,LUNX (lung-specific X protein), to be a potential molecular marker for detection of micro-metastasis in non-small cell lung cancer. However, the protein properties and function of plunc were not described in these papers.Recently, a human sequence homologous to mouse plunc and human spurt was reported in a brief communication by Bingle and Bingle (45Bingle C.D. Bingle L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1493: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Similar to LUNX, the human pluncsequence is highly homologous to the short form of spurtwith some sequence discrepancies in both the coding and noncoding regions. One important difference regarding the expression of humanspurt and the expression of human plunc was the induction by retinoids. spurt was originally identified in our microarray study as an ATRA-responsive gene. This induction was further confirmed by Northern blot analyses as shown in our data. However, Bingle's research group described high levels ofplunc RNA expression in cultured airway epithelial cells without any retinoid treatment and showed that this expression was not altered by retinoid treatment as indicated in the manuscript. Although we observed higher expression levels of spurt mRNA in human nasal turbinates and trachea, we did not identify a significant amount of spurt RNA expression in primary cultures of normal nasal epithelial or tracheobronchial epithelial cells under retinoid-depleted culture conditions. In addition, we did not demonstrate the expression of spurt or plunc-like message in NCI-H647 cell lines obtained from the ATCC. This cell line was shown by Bingle's group to be the only cell line constitutively expressing plunc message. The reason for these discrepancies is currently unclear.Based on our protein structural analyses of spurt, two functional motifs have been identified. One of them is a conserved phosphorylation site from Ser190 to Asp193 for casein kinase II, which is known to regulate cellular responses through phosphorylation and is associated with a number of substrates, including topoisomerase I, p53, and protein phosphatase 2A (50Kordiyak G.J.

Science. 1997; 276: 952-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Currently, we have not determined whether spurt is phosphorylated. However, based on the similarity of the molecular weight obtained from amino acid sequence estimations and the mobility of spurt in SDS-PAGE, we concluded that phosphorylation is less likely.The second “putative” domain identified in spurt shows amino acid sequence homology to both the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of BPI. BPI has been implicated in bactericidal processes (53Wiese A. Brandenburg K. Lindner B. Schromm A.B. Carroll S.F. Rietschel E.T. Seydel U. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10301-10310Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 54Calafat J. Janssen H. Tool A. Dentener M.A. Knol E.F. Rosenberg H.F. Egesten A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 18682-18685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The presence of a BPI-like domain in spurt protein suggests an antibacterial role for this novel protein. Consistent with this idea, our in situ hybridization studies demonstrated that spurt is frequently expressed in the serous cells of secretory ducts and submucosal glands. Some serous cell secretions, such as lysozyme, are known to have antibacterial activity. It is interested to note that plunc, a spurt-like mouse gene, has been shown to be expressed in mouse thymus, a tissue that harbors antimicrobial gene products (58LeClair E.E. Nguyen L. Bingle L. MacGowan A. Singleton V. Ward S.J. Bingle C.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 284: 792-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that spurt and plunc represent members of a new bactericidal gene family.To better understand the role of spurt in human disease, we compared the level of spurt expression between normal subjects and subjects with chronic lung diseases. Based on in situ hybridization, we observed a higher level of spurtmRNA expression in submucosal gland serous cells of patients with COPD. In addition, the submucosal gland ducts and airway epithelial surface of lung tissue from COPD patients also displayed expression ofspurt mRNA. We were unable to demonstratespurt mRNA expression in the airway epithelial surface of lung tissue obtained from normal patients. Similarly, Western blot analysis demonstrated that spurt protein expression is significantly elevated in all sputum samples obtained from COPD patients compared with normal subjects. We postulate that the recurrent infections seen in patients with chronic lung diseases such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis results in the up-regulation of airway bactericidal proteins such as spurt. This higher expression of spurt involves both increased induction of the gene in submucosal gland serous cells that normally express the gene as well as the induction of cells in the submucosal gland ducts and airway surface epithelia that normally do not express spurt.In conclusion, we have shown that spurt is a novel upper airway-specific secretory protein that is induced by retinoids. Two alternatively spliced forms of spurt exist. spurthas putative antibacterial functions, and the expression of this protein is increased in lung diseases such as chronic bronchitis and emphysema. The mechanisms and purpose of this up-regulation are actively being investigated in our laboratory. The mucociliary functions of conducting airway epithelia play an essential role in pulmonary defense against various inhaled pollutants. It has been reported that basal, ciliated, and secretory cells form a coordinated airway defense mechanism against inhaled air pollutants (1Wu R. Zhao Y.H. Chang M.M. Eur. Respir. J. 1997; 10: 2398-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Goblet cells in the airway epithelium and secretory cells in the submucosal glands are the major contributors to mucus secretion (2Kim K.C. McCracken K. Lee B.C. Shin C.Y., Jo, M.J. Lee C.J. Ko K.H. Eur. Respir. J. 1997; 10: 2644-2649Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 3Jeffery P.K. Li D. Eur. Respir. J. 1997; 10: 1655-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The secretory products contributed by each cell type are currently unknown. Therefore, identifying secretory products for each cell type provides a marker to either assess the functional role of a specific cell type in maintaining homeostasis of mucociliary function or evaluate its role in the pathogenesis of various airway diseases. Airway epithelial secretory proteins are divided into two major classes: mucins and non-mucins. Mucins are major secretory components that play an essential role in protecting and lubricating the airway epithelial surface. Mucins constitute a very large molecular weight glycoprotein family that are poly-dispersed and heavilyO-glycosylated (4Seregni E. Botti C. Massaron S. Lombardo C. Capobianco A. Bogni A. Bombardieri E. Tumori. 1997; 83: 625-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 5Kim Y.S. Gum J., Jr. Brockhausen I. Glycoconj. J. 1996; 13: 693-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Currently, there are at least 12 mucin genes identified. MUC1, MUC2,MUC4, MUC5AC, and MUC5B are expressed at relatively high levels in the human respiratory tracts compared with other mucin genes (6Reid C.J. Gould S. Harris A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 17: 592-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 7Aust M.R. Madsen C.S. Jennings A. Kasperbauer J.L. Gendler S.J. Am. J.

Rhinology. 1998; 36: 146-152PubMed Google Scholar). Non-mucin secretory proteins include lysozyme, lactoferrin, peroxidase, and antileukoprotease. These proteins contribute directly or indirectly to the pulmonary defense mechanism against infectious pathogens (12Basbaum C.B. Jany B. Finkbeiner W.E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 13Finkbeiner W.E. Respir. Physiol. 1999; 118: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The cell of origin for most of these non-mucin secretory proteins is the serous cell contained within submucosal glands (11Basbaum C.B. CIBA Found. Symp. 1984; 109: 4-19PubMed Google Scholar, 12Basbaum C.B. Jany B. Finkbeiner W.E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 13Finkbeiner W.E. Respir. Physiol. 1999; 118: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, there is still a large gap of information about the nature of these secretory proteins and their role in pulmonary defense. Vitamin A and its metabolites, retinoids, are critical to the maintenance of mucociliary functions and secretions in the airway epithelium. In vitamin A-depleted animals, the airway epithelial surface changes from a mucociliary cell layer to a protective, squamous cell surface. This alteration can be reversed upon the addition of retinoids, such as all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA)1 (14Chytil F. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 986-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Similar changes can be demonstrated in vitro in primary cultures of airway epithelial cells derived from humans and other species (15Koo J.S. Yoon J.H. Gray T. Norford D. Jetten A.M. Nettesheim P. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 20: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 16Emura M. Mohr U. Riebe M. Aufderheide M. Dungworth D.L. In Vitro Cell Dev.

Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1990; 3: 467-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Despite efforts by researchers, effects of retinoids on airway epithelia are not completely understood. We propose that retinoids induce differentiation through sequential changes in gene expression. This is based on observations that retinoid administration coincides with airway cell differentiation. To test this hypothesis, we employed a two-color-based differential hybridization on a high density cDNA microarray membrane, which contained 30,000 cDNA spots (18Chen J.J., Wu, R. Yang P.C. Huang J.Y. Sher Y.P. Han M.H. Kao W.C. Lee P.J. Chiu T.F. Chang F. Chu Y.W., Wu, C.W. Peck K. Genomics. 1998; 51: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 19Wu R., Di, Y.P. Chen J.W.

These cDNA clones were individually selected from a pool of cDNA libraries created from human tracheobroncheal epithelial (TBE) cells. The membrane was differentially hybridized with cDNA probes derived from ATRA-treated and -depleted cultures of primary human TBE cells. Several ATRA-responsive cDNA clones were identified, and one of them, theDD4 clone, encoded the cDNA sequence of a novel gene. In this report, we characterize the expression of this novel gene in airway epithelia. Results from our studies suggest that theDD4 clone encodes a novel gene product that corresponds to a secretory protein specifically produced by epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract. Based on the characteristics of this gene, we subsequently named this gene spurt (secretoryprotein in upper respiratorytracts). DISCUSSIONIn this study, we utilized a microarray assay to identify an ATRA-inducible, novel secretory protein, spurt, which is secreted by conducting airway epithelia. Our results indicate retinoids regulate spurt mRNA and protein levels in cultured airway epithelial (TBE) cells. We observed that ATRA significantly increases spurt gene expression. Increased expression occurs after several days of ATRA treatment and with higher doses of retinoids.Furthermore, we demonstrated that specific cell culture manipulations enhance spurt expression. Expression of spurtincreased in a progressive fashion as the culture conditions were changed from tissue culture plates alone (TC) to biphasic conditions without and with collagen gel substrata. Optimized expression ofspurt message occurred when airway epithelial cells were plated on a collagen gel substratum with air-liquid interface culture conditions (BI-CG). These data suggest that expression ofspurt occurs as the airway epithelial cell layer develops toward the more mature stages of differentiation.In support of this idea, it has been observed that the most suitable culture conditions to promote airway mucociliary differentiationin vitro include the combination of an air-liquid interface, a collagen gel substratum, and retinoid supplementation (1Wu R. Zhao Y.H. Chang M.M. Eur. Respir. J. 1997; 10: 2398-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Under these culture conditions, human airway epithelial cells develop into a fully differentiated cell layer with multiple mucociliary functions. In the absence of one or more of these conditions, the differentiated features are not as extensive. In addition, spurt gene expression in vivo appears to be limited to specialized cells in the human airway. In situ hybridization of lung tissue and Northern blot analyses of RNA samples from various human tissues demonstrated an abundance of spurt message in the upper respiratory tract. Gene expression was particularly high in serous cells within the submucosal glands.Based on the sequence information obtained from our genomic cloning effort and information in the public data base, full-lengthspurt sequence consists of nine exons and eight introns that spans a genomic DNA region of 7,313 bp (spurt genomic clone GenBankTM accession number AF421369).

Two stereoisomers of the product are used in different metabolic pathways, and, accordingly, enzymes with different stereospecificities are involved in each pathway. The enzyme responsible for the production of the S-isomer is the classical enoyl-CoA hydratase (crotonase) and is involved in degradation of fatty acids in mitochondria, peroxisomes, and bacterial cells. The rat mitochondrial enzyme has been studied extensively. The rat enzyme has a specific activity for CoA thioesters of straight chain fatty acids with a broad range of chain lengths (C4–C16) (1Waterson R.M. Hil R.L. J. Biol.

However, the enzyme responsible for the production of the R-isomer, (R)-specific enoyl-CoA hydratase, hydratase 2, ord-hydratase (hereafter referred to as (R)-hydratase), has been identified recently in mammals, yeast, and some polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA)-producing bacteria. In mammals, this enzyme occurs as a domain of the peroxisomal multifunctional enzyme type 2 (MFE-2) and is involved in the degradation of very long chain and 2-methyl-branched fatty acids and the biosynthesis of bile acids (9Qin Y.-M.

The yeast enzyme is also localized in the peroxisome as a part of MFE-2 but is involved in the degradation of straight chain fatty acids (14Hiltunen J.K. Wenzel B. Beyer A. Erdmann R. Fosså A. Kunau Q.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6646-6653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These eucaryotic enzymes are similar in size, composed of about 300 amino acid residues, and are highly homologous (15Qin Y.-M. Haapalainen A.M. Kilpeläinen S.H. Marttila M.S. Koski M.K. Glumoff T.

Bacterial (R)-hydratases have been found to date in Aeromonas caviae (16Fukui T. Doi Y. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4821-4830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Fukui T. Shiomi N. Doi Y. J.

Microbiol. 1995; 41: 68-72Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar), all of which are known to accumulate PHA granules in their cells. These enzymes have been characterized at the molecular level except for the case of M. rhodesianum. However, the A. caviaeenzyme is the only bacterial one whose physiological role has been identified to date. The A. caviae (R)-hydratase is essentially involved in the biosynthesis of an energy storage material of PHA, functioning as a monomer-supplying enzyme (16Fukui T. Doi Y. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4821-4830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Fukui T. Shiomi N. Doi Y. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 667-673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is encoded as aphaJ gene in the PHA biosynthesis operon, including thephaC and phaP genes coding for PHA synthase (16Fukui T. Doi Y. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4821-4830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and granule-associated protein (21Fukui T. Kichise T. Iwata T. Doi Y. Biomacromolecules. 2001; 2: 148-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), respectively. The hydratase acts on the β-oxidation intermediates trans-2-enoyl-CoAs to produce (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoAs, which are subsequently polymerized to form PHA by PHA synthase. The hydratase, and the synthase as well, preferably act on the substrates with a chain length of 4–6 carbon atoms, accounting for the fact that the produced PHA is a copolymer of (R)-3-hydroxybutyric (C4) and (R)-3-hydroxyhexanoic (C6) acids (22Doi Y. Kitamura S. Abe H. Macromolecules. 1995; 28: 4822-4828Crossref Scopus (642) Google Scholar). Unlike the eucaryotic enzymes, this bacterial (R)-hydratase is a monofunctional enzyme forming a homodimer of identical subunits with a molecular weight of 13,954. The mature polypeptide chain contains 133 amino acid residues (17Fukui T. Shiomi N. Doi Y. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 667-673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, despite the lack of a physiological relationship with the eucaryotic enzyme, the A. caviae enzyme has significant sequence homology with the C-terminal region of the eucaryotic enzyme (e.g. a 38.4% identity with the yeast enzyme for a limited region of 73 amino acid residues (16Fukui T. Doi Y. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4821-4830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), indicating that they are derived from a common ancestor. The reaction mechanism of the (R)-hydratase has not been well characterized, in contrast to the rat crotonase. Recently, a highly conserved amino acid sequence, referred to as the hydratase 2 motif, has been identified by comparing the hydratase 2 domains of peroxisomal MFE-2s and several fungal and bacterial proteins (15Qin Y.-M. Haapalainen A.M. Kilpeläinen S.H. Marttila M.S. Koski M.K. Glumoff T. Novikov D.K. Hiltunen J.K. J. Biol.

On the basis of the sequence comparison, pK ameasurement, and mutagenesis, it has been proposed that in the human hydratase 2, Glu366 and Asp510 play a critical role in the catalytic reaction through an acid-base mechanism that is similar to that for the crotonase (15Qin Y.-M.

Although Asp510 of the human enzyme, one of the hydratase 2 motif residues, corresponds to Asp31 of the A. caviaeenzyme, there is no counterpart of Glu366 in the A. caviae enzyme, because of the lack of a region corresponding to the N-terminal half (residues from 319 to 483) of the human enzyme where Glu366 is located. Therefore, if the catalytic reaction of the A. caviae hydratase also proceeds via an acid-base mechanism, which residue partners with Asp31 to form the catalytic dyad? A preference for the chain length of the CoA thioester substrate is another remarkable difference between bacterial and peroxisomal enzymes. Because no structure of either bacterial or peroxisomal enzymes has been reported, it is not clear whether or not the difference in substrate specificity is linked to the large difference in the polypeptide chain length of these proteins. To elucidate the mechanisms of the catalytic reaction and recognition of the chain length of substrates, a three-dimensional structure of the enzyme is indispensable. Here we report the first crystal structure of (R)-hydratase. The structure of A. caviae(R)-hydratase has a so-called “hot dog” fold as a main frame, with an overhanging segment that contains conserved residues including the hydratase 2 motif residues. The catalytic residues Asp31 and His36 are on the overhanging segment and are located at the dimer interface. The substrate-binding site is tunnel-shaped, which accounts for the preference for a substrate with chain length of four to six. The structure will provide invaluable information for the application of this enzyme to the production of PHAs that have attracted considerable attention because of their potential as renewable and biodegradable plastics (23Slater S.

Recombinant (R)-hydratase was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified according to the procedure described by Fukui et al. (17Fukui T. Shiomi N. Doi Y. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 667-673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the sample was found to be degraded perhaps due to contaminated proteinases, further purification by gel filtration was performed with a Superdex 70pg column (Amersham Biosciences). Crystals of the enzyme were obtained by sitting-drop vapor-diffusion using a mother liquor containing 20% polyethylene glycol 4000, 5% 2-propanol, and 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), as described previously (31Hisano T. Fukui T. Iwata T. Doi Y. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 145-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The crystallization experiments were set up at 25 °C. Large crystals were grown in 2–3 weeks to maximum dimensions of 0.5 × 0.1 × 0.04 mm and were stabilized in a solution containing 28% polyethylene glycol 4000, 5% 2-propanol, and 20 mm MES (pH 6.0). These crystals belong to space group C2, with cell parameters a = 111.5 Å, b = 59.3 Å, c = 47.3 Å and β = 112.9°, and contain two subunits per asymmetric unit. They diffracted CuKα radiation up to a resolution of 2.0 Å. The intensity data (Native 1) were processed to a resolution of 2.5 Å with an R merge of 7.8% using PROCESS (Rigaku). Higher resolution data (Native 2; up to 1.5-Å resolution) from a flash-cooled crystal were collected using synchrotron radiation at SPring-8, Harima, Japan (32Adachi S. Oguchi T. Ueki T. SPring-8 Annual Report 1996. JASRI, Harima, Japan1996: 239-240Google Scholar), and were processed with anR merge of 5.5% using MOSFLM (33Leslie A.G.W.

On flash-cooling, the cell parameters of the crystal changed slightly toa = 110.0 Å, b = 57.8 Å,c = 47.0 Å, and β = 112.7°.

Open table in a new tab For the preparation of heavy atom derivatives, the (R)-hydratase crystals were transferred to a synthetic mother liquor containing 28% polyethylene glycol 4000, 5% 2-propanol, and 100 mm MES (pH 6.0). Three isomorphous heavy atom derivatives were prepared with 1 mm HgCl2, 3 mm K3IrCl6, or 3 mmK2PtCl4. All sets of derivative data were collected using CuKα radiation at room temperature and processed with PROCESS (Table I). Initial phase calculation was conducted with the Native 1 and derivative data sets. Two mercury sites were identified by calculating the difference-Patterson function using PHASES (34Furey W. Swaminathan S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 590-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Two iridium sites and one platinum site were identified using the difference-Fourier technique. Heavy atom parameters were refined at 3.5-Å resolution in PHASES, including the anomalous dispersion signals of mercury. Following solvent-flattening density modification and phase extension to 3.0-Å resolution, the electron density map was clearly interpretable. A model was built interactively using XTALVIEW (35McRee D.E. Practical Protein Crystallography. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, CA1999Google Scholar) and TURBO-FRODO (36Jones T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 115: 15-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Because the encoded first Met residue does not exist in the mature enzyme due to a post-translational modification (17Fukui T. Shiomi N. Doi Y. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 667-673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the sequence number was started with the encoded second residue Ser as the first. This model was positioned in a unit cell by molecular replacement using REPLACE (37Tong L.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 748-751Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar) calculated against the Native 2 data set, and then refined with a simulated annealing protocol using X-PLOR (38Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Manual, Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) and CNS (39Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J.

The final model includes residues 2–133 and 1–133 for chains A and B, respectively, one 2-propanol, and 347 water molecules. Fig. 1 shows a representative (2mF o − DF c) electron density map of the protein. The stereochemistry was verified using PROCHECK (40Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The atomic coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (accession code 1IQ6). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by means of the PCR method (41Imai Y. Matsushima Y. Sugimura T. Terada M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) and was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The PCR primers containing mutational sites were designed in inverted tail-to-tail directions and used for the amplification reaction with the expression vector for the (R)-hydratase (pETNB3) as a template. The oligonucleotide sequences of the primers used are as follows: 5′-CTCTCGGAGGCCTTCAACCCCCTGC-3′ for the D31A mutation; 5′-CTCTCGGAGGACTTCAACCCCCTGGCCCTGGACCCGGCC-3′ for the H36A mutation; 5′-CGCGGCGAAGGCGGCTACCTCCGCC-3′ for the D31A and H36A mutations; and 5′-CTCTTCGCCGGGCTGCTGGGCCAGCAG-3′ and 5′-GCTGGCGAGCAGCATGCCGTGGACTATGGG-3′ for the S62A mutation (the changed codons causing the mutations are indicated as boldface letters). The products were self-ligated and transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3). The expression, purification, and activity assay for the mutant enzymes were carried out in the manner described previously (17Fukui T. Shiomi N. Doi Y. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 667-673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for the wild-type enzyme. The structural conformations of the mutants were evaluated by far-UV CD spectroscopy using a Jasco J720 spectropolarimeter in a range of 200–250 nm with a 1-mm path length quartz cuvette at 20 °C. The crystal structure of the (R)-hydratase was solved by isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering using the mercury, iridium, and platinum derivatives. The final model was refined to 1.5-Å resolution with crystallographic and free (5% of the total reflections) R-factors of 20.3 and 23.1%, respectively (Table I). The asymmetric unit contained two polypeptide chains, referred to as A and B, which together formed a functional dimeric molecule. Because the first encoded residue, methionine, is post-translationally deleted (17Fukui T. Shiomi N. Doi Y. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 667-673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and not present in the mature protein, the encoded second residue serine represents residue 1 in our numbering system. Chain B consists of all of the 133 amino acid residues, whereas chain A contains 132 residues, because Ser1 was not well defined in the electron density map. Both chains are effectively identical with a root-mean-square (r.m.s.) deviation between the 130 Cα atoms of each monomer (residues 4–133) of 0.59 Å. However, small conformational differences occur in the region from Asn33 to Arg49 and its adjacent region from Leu65 to Ile75 (r.m.s. deviation of 1.28 Å for 28 Cα atoms). As a result, the segment from Pro39 to Ala42 forms a 310-helix in chain B, whereas it is an α-helix in chain A. This helix in chain B has more contact with another molecule in the crystal than that in chain A. Thus, it is not clear whether the differences for these regions are merely due to the different environment in the crystal lattice or are linked to the enzymatic function of the molecule. On the other hand, the conformational difference for the N-terminal residues before Ser4 is very large, probably due to the intrinsic flexibility, and was excluded from the calculation of the deviation. Apparently this N-terminal region is not functionally important. The Ramachandran plot shows that almost all of the non-glycine residues are in allowed regions, with the exception of Glu48A ((φ, ψ) = (67.6°, −31.1°)) which is in a disallowed region. This unusual conformation for Glu48A is, however, validated with the omit map calculated from the model without this residue. Note that Glu48E has very similar values for the dihedral angles ((φ, ψ) = (68.1°, −28.5°)), which lie in the allowed region for the left-handed helical conformation. The (R)-hydratase monomer consists of a five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and four helices (Fig. 2, a and b). The order of strands in the β-sheet is 1-3-4-5-2, and the length of each strand ranges between 7 and 11 residues. All the helices (H1–H4) are connected between the first strand, S1, and the second strand, S2. Strand S1 is followed by the first α-helix H1 having three turns. Two contiguous short helices with one turn for each follow helix H1. In chain A, both helices are in the α-helical conformation, whereas in chain B, helices H2 and H3 are in the α- and 310-helical conformations, respectively, as described above. Helix H3 is then followed by a long extended loop of about 10 residues, and finally the central helix H4, with four turns, comes to be connected to strand S2. Helix H4 has a very interesting feature. It is a complex of three helices that are fused continuously along a common axis. The first and the last portions, Gly54–Leu57 and Phe61–Gln68, form α-helices, whereas the middle portion, Leu57–Phe61, forms a 310-helix. Helix H4 is wrapped around by the largely wound β-sheet like a hot dog, where the β-sheet and the central helix H4 are a “bun” and a “sausage,” respectively. The hot dog fold has been originally observed for the β-hydroxydecanoyl thiol ester dehydrase from E. coli (42Leesong M. Henderson B.S. Gillig J.R. Schwab J.M. Smith J.L. Structure. 1996; 4: 253-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) and later for the 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA thioesterase fromPseudomonas sp. CBS-3 as well (43Benning M. Wesenber G. Lius R. Taylor K.L. Dunaway-Mariano D. Holden H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33572-33579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Two hot dog repeats in a single peptide, called the “double hot dog” fold, have also been reported for the medium chain length acyl-CoA thioesterase II fromE. coli (44Li J. Derewenda U. Dauter Z. Smith S. Derewenda Z.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Although they have a fold similar to the core structure, (R)-hydratase has a feature that distinguishes it from other hot dog fold enzymes. The most notable difference is an overhanging segment situated between the first strand S1 and the central helix H4. This region in other hot dog fold enzymes is a relatively short loop of around 15 residues, whereas in (R)-hydratase, it is a large fragment of about 35 residues. This overhang in (R)-hydratase is rather compact and has little interaction with the hot dog main body, other than the central helix H4. The B-factor values for the main chain atoms in the region from Asn33 to Arg49 (from helix H2 to the loop after helix H3; see Fig. 2 b) are relatively high compared with those in the hot dog main frame (the averageB-factors for the Cα atoms of chains A and B are 18.01 and 17.03 Å2, respectively, whereas those in the region from Asn33 to Arg49 of both chains are 23.65 and 23.24 Å2, respectively), indicating the intrinsic lability of this region. This is consistent with the observed conformational differences between chains A and B as described above. The residues in this overhang are highly conserved among the (R)-hydratases, indicating the importance of this overhang. In fact, the catalytically important residues Asp31 and His36 are involved in this segment (see below). Thus, this overhang is both structurally and functionally characteristic to the (R)-hydratase. A secondary structure-based sequence alignment shows that (R)-hydratase from A. caviae has some homology with the β-hydroxydecanoyl thiol ester dehydrase from E. coli (Fig. 3). A total of 12 identical residues are localized in S1, H4, S3, and S5 (the (R)-hydratase notation). This suggests that (R)-hydratase and dehydrase may have been derived from a common ancestor protein. This is not surprising because the functions of both enzymes are very similar; both catalyze the addition/elimination of a water molecule to/from 2-enoyl/(R)-3-hydroxyacyl thioesters (CoA and acyl-carrier protein thioesters for (R)-hydratase and dehydrase, respectively). In the case of (R)-hydratase, the overhang, including the functionally important residues, may have been inserted in the course of molecular evolution. In the dimeric form (Fig. 2, cand d), two monomers make extensive contacts, burying 1426.02 Å2 (about 20%) of the surface area of the monomer, 68% of which is apolar (values from www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/bsm/PP/server/). Helices H1 and H4 and strand S2 are situated at the subunit interface. Strands S2s are associated in an antiparallel direction so that the two β-sheets form a 10-stranded β-sheet as a whole. The extended 10-stranded β-sheet wraps around the two central helices, with the overhangs covering the gaps that occur at the interface of the two subunits. Helices H1 and H4 are associated with their counterparts across the molecular dyad, facing side by side in an antiparallel direction. These paired helices are then packed so that the axes of the helices run almost perpendicular to each other. Thus, the two H4 helices are sandwiched between the two H1 helices and the 10-stranded β-sheet. This results in the helix H4 being almost entirely buried in the molecule, with the C terminus of the helix partially exposed to the solvent. In fact, helix H4, which is composed of 14 residues (Gly54–Gln67), is dominantly hydrophobic wi"

The tail domain anchors troponin to tropomyosin and actin, modulates myosin function, and is a site of cardiomyopathy-inducing mutations. Critical interactions between tropomyosin and troponin are proposed to depend on tail domain residues 112–136, which are highly conserved across phyla. Most cardiomyopathy mutations in TnT flank this region. Three such mutations were examined and had contrasting effects on peptide TnT-(1–156), promoting folding and thermal stability assessed by circular dichroism (F110I) or weakening folding and stability (T104V and to a small extent R92Q). Folding of both TnT-(1–156) and whole troponin was promoted by replacing bovine TnT Thr-104 with human TnT Ala-104, further indicating the importance of this cardiomyopathy site residue for protein folding. Mutation F110I markedly stabilized the troponin tail but weakened binding of holo-troponin to actin-tropomyosin 8-fold, suggesting that loss of flexibility impairs troponin tail function. The effect of the F110I mutation on troponin-tropomyosin binding to actin was much less, indicating this flexibility is particularly important for the interactions of troponin with tropomyosin. We suggest that most cardiomyopathic mutations in the troponin tail alter muscle function indirectly, by perturbing interactions between troponin and tropomyosin requisite for the complex effects of these proteins on myosin.

Tight and specific attachment of troponin to the thin filament is mediated by the troponin tail domain, which is composed of the N-terminal portion of TnT1 and interacts with the tropomyosin C terminus.

J. 1996; 73: 1763-1770Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (34) Google Scholar) indicate that the tail domain is highly asymmetric and ∼160 Å in length. Electron microscopy of tropomyosin-TnT co-crystals suggests that a long region of the tropomyosin C terminus may interact with the troponin tail (4Cabral-Lilly D. Tobacman L.S. Mehegan J.P. Cohen C. Biophys. J. 1996; 73: 1763-1770Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, most of this extended interaction may be very weak, because a variety of other evidence suggests that only the C terminus of tropomyosin binds strongly to troponin (reviewed in Ref. 5Tobacman L.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 447-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Recently, an x-ray crystallographic study of the tropomyosin C terminus identified and determined the structure of an 18-residue tropomyosin region that comprises a critical TnT-binding site (6Li Y. Mui S. Brown J.H. Strand J. Reshetnikova L. Tobacman L.S. Cohen C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7378-7383Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The TnT element that binds to this tropomyosin region is unknown. A new approach to these important interactions has been provided by the discovery that any of several mutations in the troponin tail region can cause the autosomal dominant disorder, familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC). Regardless whether because of mutations in thick filament or thin filament components of the cardiac sarcomere, the characteristic finding in FHC patients is missense or mild truncation mutations (7Geisterfer-Lowrance A.A.

As many as 15% of FHC kindreds have cardiac TnT mutations, and the largest portion of these are in the troponin tail (see below). The disease phenotype has high penetrance, including myofibrillar disarray and risk of sudden death by arrhythmia. Therefore, troponin tail function must be altered and protein function studies, if sufficiently sensitive, are likely to identify abnormalities. Indeed, beginning in 1996 (14Lin D. Bobkova A.

These effects support the view that the troponin tail has subtle effects on myosin, in addition to its critical function as an anchoring domain. The present work concerns three FHC-inducing TnT mutations that are of interest because of their location in the important but poorly understood troponin tail region, and because their unexpected effects on troponin solubility suggested alterations in protein folding. In an earlier publication (18Tobacman L.S. Lin D. Butters C.A. Landis C.A. Back N. Pavlov D. Homsher E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28363-28370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), we found that mutations R92Q and F110I (11Watkins H. McKenna W.J. Thierfelder L. Suk H.J. Anan R.

(Bovine TnT amino acids are designated in the present report, unlike some of our previous work (18Tobacman L.S. Lin D. Butters C.A. Landis C.A. Back N. Pavlov D. Homsher E. J. Biol.

Espinasse I. Durand J. Neveux J.-Y. Mercadier J.-J. FEBS Lett. 1993; 328: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).) Although it was possible to reconstitute troponin complexes containing these mutant TnTs by gradually dialyzing away denaturant under high salt conditions, R92Q troponin precipitated when the ionic strength was decreased below 0.5m, and F110I troponin precipitated unless 10% glycerol was added in addition to a high ionic strength buffer. Insoluble proteins can cause human disease (28Dobson C.M. Nature. 2002; 418: 729-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 29Taylor J.P. Hardy J. Fischbeck K.H. Science. 2002; 296: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar), but there was no precedent for protein insolubility in FHC. Therefore, it seemed plausible that the observations were due to the use of bovine rather than human troponin. In this regard, it is notable that between residues 70 and 141, human and bovine TnTs are identical except at one position: bovine Thr-104 is Ala in the human sequence. Because this residue is located near both positions 92 and 110, the sites of mutations causing poor solubility, we created bovine TnT double mutants R92Q/T104A and F110I/T104A. As shown below, this maneuver corrected the insolubility and permitted reconstitution of functional troponins, suggesting the importance of residue 104 in proper folding of the troponin tail. Interestingly, there is a family with FHC due to the TnT mutation T104V (30Nakajima-Taniguchi C. Matusi H. Fujio Y. Nagata S. Kishimoto T. Yamauchi-Takihara K. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 839-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), reinforcing the significance of this residue for folding and/or function. The results below detail the effects of R92Q, T104A, T104V, and F110I mutations on the folding of the troponin tail region and on its function as an anchoring domain. The respective mutation sites either had little effect, inhibited, or strongly promoted folding stability of the troponin tail. Mutation F110I weakened the affinity of troponin for the thin filament, despite promoting folding, and overall the data suggest that troponin tail flexibility is particularly important for the interactions of troponin with tropomyosin. In addition, multiple vertebrate and invertebrate TnTs were subjected to amino acid sequence alignment, revealing very high conservation of residues 112–136. In consideration of this analysis as well as previous deletional studies, we suggest this region is a critical anchoring element of TnT. Numerous cardiomyopathy-inducing mutations flank this TnT sequence. Bovine cardiac tropomyosin, native troponin, TnI, and TnC were purified as described previously (31Tobacman L.S. Adelstein R.S. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 798-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 32Tobacman L.S. Lee R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4059-4064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from a heart muscle ether powder. Actin was obtained from an acetone powder of rabbit fast skeletal muscle (33Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whole troponin was reconstituted from denatured subunits mixed in a 1:1:1 ratio, followed by stepwise dialysis and size exclusion column chromatography (32Tobacman L.S. Lee R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4059-4064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant control and mutant bovine whole TnT and TnT-(1–156) were expressed using pET3d in DE3 cells and purified to homogeneity as described (25Hinkle A. Goranson A. Butters C.A. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7157-7164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). T104V or T104A mutations were introduced into bovine cardiac TnT cDNA (18Tobacman L.S. Lin D. Butters C.A. Landis C.A. Back N. Pavlov D. Homsher E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28363-28370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) by the same PCR-based approach used previously to create the R92Q and F110I mutations (18Tobacman L.S. Lin D. Butters C.A. Landis C.A. Back N. Pavlov D. Homsher E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28363-28370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The same method was also used to introduce the T104A mutation into TnT R92Q and F110I. To create the various TnT-(1–156) constructs, the corresponding DNA fragment was amplified by PCR from the various full-length plasmids and inserted into the NcoI/BamHI sites of pET3d. All coding sequences in expression plasmids were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing at the University of Iowa DNA Facility. The ellipticity of TnT-(1–156) was monitored as a function of temperature using an Aviv DS65 circular dichroism spectrometer, recording from −5 to 80 °C. Two sets of protein preparations gave similar results. Conditions are as follows: 0.1 mg/ml TnT-(1–156), 300 mm KCl, 15 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 6.5). Similar results were also obtained for one of the sets of protein preparations, examined in the presence of 150 mm KCl. Data were fit to a two-state, temperature (T)-dependent transition, with −RT lnK = ΔG = ΔH m(1 − T/T m). The ellipticity of the unfolded state was taken as constant, but satisfactory fits required that the ellipticity of the folded state be assumed to vary linearly with temperature. This procedure should be considered as semi-empirical, because the unfolding process is not two-state as assumed in the modeling. Differential scanning calorimetry of wt TnT-(1–156), F110I TnT-(1–156), and of F110I/T104A TnT-(1–156) demonstrated that the heat of unfolding was in fact gradual and could not be described accurately with models including as many as four states (three transitions) (data not shown). Binding of radiolabeled tropomyosin to actin was measured by cosedimentation with a TLA100 rotor in a Beckman TL100 centrifuge (34Hill L.E. Mehegan J.P. Butters C.A. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16106-16113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The tropomyosin was stoichiometrically labeled under denaturing conditions on Cys-190 with [3H]iodoacetic acid (34Hill L.E. Mehegan J.P. Butters C.A. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16106-16113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding was calculated from the decrease in supernatant radioactivity following sedimentation. As described in the figures, conditions were chosen in which the tropomyosin bound negligibly to actin unless troponin or a troponin fragment was added. Troponin binds very tightly to the thin filament, making its affinity problematic to measure by sedimentation. Therefore, the relative affinity of troponin for actin-tropomyosin was measured by its ability to displace a control, 3H-labeled troponin from the thin filament. Bound and free [3H]troponin were separated by ultracentrifugation as described previously (25Hinkle A. Goranson A. Butters C.A. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7157-7164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). By fitting the data to Equation 1 from Ref. 25Hinkle A. Goranson A. Butters C.A. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7157-7164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, the affinity of troponin for actin-tropomyosin was measured, relative to the affinity of the3H-labeled troponin. Conditions are as follows: 25 °C, 7 μm actin, 3 μm tropomyosin, 1 μm3H-labeled troponin, 10 mmTris (pH 7.5), 300 mm KCl, 3 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.5 mm EGTA. The strongest interaction between troponin and tropomyosin involves the TnT N terminus and a tropomyosin C-terminal region found specifically in tropomyosins that bind to troponin (reviewed in Ref. 6Li Y. Mui S. Brown J.H. Strand J. Reshetnikova L. Tobacman L.S. Cohen C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7378-7383Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Moreover, a newly reported crystallographic study of tropomyosin shows that conserved C-terminal residues of mammalian striated muscle tropomyosin effect a distinctive structure, a troponin T recognition site. This structural and sequence conservation in tropomyosin suggests a similar conservation in the protein target, i.e. in the troponin tail. To help identify this region, a multiple sequence alignment of 15 TnTs was performed (Fig. 1). In the figure, chordate (mammals, birds, and tunicate) TnT conservation is indicated in yellow, and blue indicates conservation among three invertebrate phyla (nematode, mollusks, and insect). Regions conserved among both vertebrate and invertebrate TnTs are indicated in green and are readily apparent. Fig. 1 shows that no TnT region is more conserved than residues 112–136 of the troponin tail domain. These residues are 70% homologous across the analyzed sequences. Significantly, engineered cardiac troponin constructs bind tightly to the thin filament only if they contain this entire region (see “Discussion”), regardless whether the construct is a troponin tail fragment containing only the TnT N terminus or instead is a truncated ternary troponin complex with an N-terminal deletion (25Hinkle A. Goranson A. Butters C.A. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7157-7164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 34Hill L.E. Mehegan J.P. Butters C.A. Tobacman L.S. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 25455-25460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The present sequence alignment and these earlier deletional experiments together suggest that residues 112–136 comprise a tropomyosin-binding element. Also, note that this region is flanked by many hypertrophic cardiomyopathy alleles, including (# in Fig. 1) sites Arg-92, Ala-104, and Phe-110. Although not the focus of the present study, the sequence alignment in Fig. 1 should also be considered in relationship to a preliminary, high resolution structure of a troponin complex containing TnC, most of TnI, and TnT fragment 188–288 (36Takeda S. Yamashita A. Maeda K. Maeda Y. Biophys. J. 2002; 82 (abstr.): 170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Of the 101 TnT residues crystallized, 70 (residues 202–271) are ordered and identifiable in the x-ray structure. As can be seen in the figure, these boundaries correspond to those residues of the C-terminal half of TnT that are evolutionarily conserved. Within this region there is particular conservation of amino acids 226–271, which form a coiled coil with subunit TnI and also interact with TnC (36Takeda S. Yamashita A. Maeda K. Maeda Y. Biophys. J. 2002; 82 (abstr.): 170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In an earlier study, we reported that TnT R92Q and F110I mutations interfered with the ability of bovine cardiac troponin subunits to reconstitute into a soluble troponin complex (18Tobacman L.S. Lin D. Butters C.A. Landis C.A. Back N. Pavlov D. Homsher E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28363-28370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To investigate this folding abnormality quantitatively, we isolated troponin tail fragments TnT-(1–156), finding them to be soluble regardless of mutation. No precipitation was observed in low ionic strength buffer at protein concentrations studied (∼1.5 mg/ml). Troponin tail fragment TnT-(1–156) was predominantly α-helical as assessed by circular dichroism (data not shown), as expected (37Pearlstone J.R. Smillie L.B. Can. J. Biochem. 1977; 55: 1032-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 38Tanokura M. Tawada Y. Ono A. Ohtsuki I. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1983; 93: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). When ellipticity was examined as a function of temperature, the mutations caused large but disparate effects (Fig. 2 A and TableI). TnT T104V altered the ellipticity in the manner expected for a destabilizing mutation, decreasing the temperature of the unfolding curve midpoint (T m) by 4.2 °C and also decreasing the absolute magnitude of the maximal ellipticity observed at the lowest temperature examined (−5 °C). Cardiomyopathy causing mutation R92Q similarly decreased both the ellipticity magnitude at low temperature and the T m, but to lesser extents. Interestingly, TnT mutation F110I had the opposite consequences, markedly shifting the circular dichroism results in the direction expected for a stabilizing rather than a de-stabilizing mutation.Table IThermal denaturation midpoint of bovine cardiac troponin tail peptide TnT-(1–156) containing cardiomyopathy mutations and/or bovine versus human difference T104ACardiomyopathy mutationBovine Thr-104 (control and single mutants)Human Ala-104 (control and double mutants)°CNone (control)29.5 ± 0.333.2 ± 0.2R92Q27.7 ± 0.533.1 ± 0.2F110I32.3 ± 0.338.8 ± 0.1T104V25.3 ± 0.5NACircular dichroism results in Fig. 2 were analyzed to determine values for T m, the temperature corresponding to 50% thermal denaturation. Cardiomyopathic mutation T104V decreased thermal stability; F110I increased thermal stability, and R92Q had little effect. Thermal stability was increased when human Ala-104 was inserted into the bovine sequence, in either the absence (“none”) or the presence of the R92Q and F110I mutations. NA indicates not applicable. Open table in a new tab Circular dichroism results in Fig. 2 were analyzed to determine values for T m, the temperature corresponding to 50% thermal denaturation. Cardiomyopathic mutation T104V decreased thermal stability; F110I increased thermal stability, and R92Q had little effect. Thermal stability was increased when human Ala-104 was inserted into the bovine sequence, in either the absence (“none”) or the presence of the R92Q and F110I mutations. NA indicates not applicable. Human cardiac and bovine cardiac TnT residues 70–141 are identical except at amino acid 104, which is alanine in the former and threonine in the latter. Alanine is among the most helix-promoting amino acids, and as described below, the solubility of bovine troponins containing human cardiomyopathy mutations R92Q or F110I was restored by incorporating Ala at position 104 of bovine TnT. Ala-104 improved the folding of the troponin tail fragments (Table I and Fig. 2 B), raising the melting temperature by 4–6 °C regardless of the presence of the R92Q mutation, the F110I mutation, or neither. This suggests the importance of residue 104 for troponin tail folding stability, and this implication is reinforced by the results with the cardiomyopathy-causing valine at this position. T104V TnT-(1–156) had the lowest stability of any of the tail fragments tested. Fig. 2 B shows that bovine TnT-(1–156) containing the double mutation T104A/F110I was particularly stable, with aT m even higher than that of the T104A peptide, by 5.6 °C. In contrast, cardiomyopathic mutation R92Q had no effect on the melting curve in the presence of the T104A mutation (Fig. 2 B, circles versus triangles). The CD data overall demonstrate that cardiomyopathy-causing mutations at the three positions, 92, 104, and 110, had strikingly disparate effects on the folding of the troponin tail domain. While this work was in preparation, qualitatively similar results were reported using human cardiac TnT fragment 70–170 (39Palm T. Graboski S. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Greenfield N.J. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 2827-2837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) (see “Discussion”). Despite substantial differences in the N and C termini of the peptides studied in the two reports, and differences in T m values and ellipticity at 0 °C, the effects of the mutations on apparent stability were very similar. Like whole troponin, troponin tail peptide TnT-(1–156) promotes the binding of tropomyosin to actin (25Hinkle A. Goranson A. Butters C.A. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7157-7164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 26Tobacman L.S. Nihli M. Butters C. Heller M. Hatch V. Craig R. Lehman W. Homsher E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27636-27642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), an effect most conveniently studied under high ionic strength conditions that weaken tropomyosin-actin affinity. In the presence of 300 mm KCl and sub-micromolar tropomyosin concentrations, negligible tropomyosin binds to actin unless either troponin or the troponin tail peptide is added (Fig. 3). The effect of TnT-(1–156) was independent of the bovineversus human Thr-104 versus Ala-104 substitution but was significantly impaired by each of the cardiomyopathy mutations, T104V, F110I, or R92Q. Thus, function was lost not only by mutations that impaired folding (T104V and R92Q), but also by a mutation that strengthened folding (F110I). When the R92Q mutation was combined with the T104A substitution (construct R92Q/T104A), troponin tail function was restored. Because folding was also improved (Table I), this is explainable by a higher fraction of the protein being folded and therefore binding competent at 25 °C. However, the F110I/T104A troponin tail fragment is particularly stable according to the data in Fig. 2, but nevertheless had no effect on tropomyosin binding to actin. This suggests that normal interactions of the troponin tail with its target (actin and/or tropomyosin) require sufficient flexibility, lacking as a consequence of the mutation. TnT R92Q and F110I mutations adversely affect bovine cardiac whole troponin solubility (25Hinkle A. Goranson A. Butters C.A. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7157-7164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), complicating assessment of the properties of these molecules. Similarly, repeated efforts in the present study to reconstitute bovine troponin containing the T104V mutation produced a soluble complex only when the ionic strength was maintained very high, with more than 1 m KCl. However, no such problem was observed for troponins with the TnT double mutants R92Q/T104A or F110I/T104A. In the context of the human Ala-104, which promotes folding (Fig. 2), the cardiomyopathy mutations did not affect troponin solubility, and ternary troponin complexes were routinely isolated at concentrations of ∼1.5 mg/ml in low ionic strength buffer. Fig. 4 shows the same experiment as in Fig. 3, except binding of tropomyosin to actin is promoted by whole troponin with or without cardiomyopathy mutations, instead of by troponin tail fragments. T104A troponin behaved similarly to control troponin, as did R92Q/T104A troponin. Both the maximal tropomyosin-actin binding and the troponin concentration dependence of the effect were indistinguishable from data for control troponin"

In the present study, we analyzed the Cdc42 binding and scaffolding activities of Scd2 by co-precipitation assays. We found that two SH3-containing regions, amino acid residues 1–87 (CB1 (Cdc42-binding region 1)) and 110–266 (CB2), of Scd2 can bind to the GTP-bound form of Cdc42. CB2 is cryptic because of the intramolecular binding between the SH3 domain in CB2 (SH3(C)) and the PX domain and binds to Cdc42 only when the Scd2 PB1 domain binds to the PC motif-containing region (residues 760–872) of Scd1. This CB2·Cdc42 association, which would stabilize the open configuration of Scd2, enables the SH3(C) domain to bind to the polyproline motif of Shk1. We also found that the GTP-bound form of Cdc42 binds to the CRIB motif of Shk1 more strongly than to Scd2. Thus, Scd2 functions as a scaffold to form a protein complex, and the GTP-bound Cdc42 might be transferred effectively from the upstream activator Scd1 to the downstream effector Shk1 via Scd2.

Because the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae homologue of Scd2, Bem1p, binds to Cdc42 in a GTP-dependent manner (33Bose I. Irazoqui J.E. Moskow J.J. Bardes E.S. Zyla T.R. Lew D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7176-7186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), Scd2 is expected to bind to the GTP-bound form of Cdc42. However, neither Bem1p nor Scd2 contains the CRIB motif (13Chang E.C. Barr M. Wang Y. Jung V., Xu, H.P. Wigler M.H. Cell. 1994; 79: 131-141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 33Bose I. Irazoqui J.E. Moskow J.J. Bardes E.S. Zyla T.R. Lew D.J. J. Biol.

We found that the four domains of Scd2 have important roles in the interactions with these proteins. The SH3(N)- and SH3(C)-containing regions (CB1 and CB2 (Cdc42-binding regions 1 and2)) bind to the switch regions of the GTP-bound form of Cdc42. The SH3(C) domain intramolecularly binds to the PX domain, which prevents CB2 from binding to Cdc42. CB2 is able to bind to the GTP-bound form of Cdc42 when the PB1 domain of Scd2 is associated with the PC motif-containing region of Scd1 (Scd1-PC). Furthermore, the binding of the polyproline-binding site of the SH3(C) domain to Shk1 is enhanced when Scd2 binds to Scd1-PC and the GTP-bound form of Cdc42. Thus, these four proteins can form a quaternary complex that includes two Cdc42-binding proteins. On the other hand, we also found that the CRIB motif of Shk1 binds preferentially to Cdc42, even in the presence of Scd2. The Cdc42/Rac protein is a member of the Rho family of small GTP-binding proteins (1Kaibuchi K. Kuroda S. Amano M. Annu. Rev.

Because the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae homologue of Scd2, Bem1p, binds to Cdc42 in a GTP-dependent manner (33Bose I. Irazoqui J.E. Moskow J.J. Bardes E.S. Zyla T.R. Lew D.J. J. Biol.

However, neither Bem1p nor Scd2 contains the CRIB motif (13Chang E.C. Barr M. Wang Y. Jung V., Xu, H.P. Wigler M.H.

In the present study on the fission yeast system, we analyzed the interactions of Scd2 with Scd1, Cdc42, and Shk1. We found that the four domains of Scd2 have important roles in the interactions with these proteins. The SH3(N)- and SH3(C)-containing regions (CB1 and CB2 (Cdc42-binding regions 1 and2)) bind to the switch regions of the GTP-bound form of Cdc42. The SH3(C) domain intramolecularly binds to the PX domain, which prevents CB2 from binding to Cdc42. CB2 is able to bind to the GTP-bound form of Cdc42 when the PB1 domain of Scd2 is associated with the PC motif-containing region of Scd1 (Scd1-PC). Furthermore, the binding of the polyproline-binding site of the SH3(C) domain to Shk1 is enhanced when Scd2 binds to Scd1-PC and the GTP-bound form of Cdc42. Thus, these four proteins can form a quaternary complex that includes two Cdc42-binding proteins. On the other hand, we also found that the CRIB motif of Shk1 binds preferentially to Cdc42, even in the presence of Scd2. We are grateful to M.

The bulk of bicarbonate secretion in the luminal membrane of duct cells is mediated by a Cl−-dependent mechanism (Cl−/HCO3− exchange), and we previously reported that the mechanism is CFTR-dependent and cAMP-activated (Lee, M.

In the present study, we provide comprehensive evidence that calcium signaling also activates the same CFTR- and Cl−-dependent HCO3− transport. ATP and trypsin evoked intracellular calcium signaling in pancreatic duct-derived cells through the activation of purinergic and protease-activated receptors, respectively. Cl−/HCO3− exchange activity was measured by recording pHi in response to [Cl−]o changes of the perfusate.

Notably, adenoviral transfection of wild-type CFTR in CFPAC-1 cells completely restored the stimulatory effect of ATP on luminal Cl−/HCO3− exchange. In addition, the chelation of intracellular calcium by 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N,N′-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) treatment abolished the effect of calcium agonists on luminal Cl−/HCO3− exchange.

HCO3− protects duodenal epithelia by neutralizing gastric acid and maintains an optimum intraluminal pH for digestive enzymes (1Argent B.E. Case R.M. Johnson E.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 1473-1497Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence suggests that HCO3−-rich pancreatic fluid secretion is also important for maintaining the patency of intrapancreatic ductal trees (2Johansen P.G. Anderson C.M. Hadorn B. Lancet. 1968; 1: 455-460Abstract Google Scholar, 3Kopelman H. Durie P. Gaskin K. Weizman Z. Forstner N. Engl. J. Med. 1985; 312: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 4Quinton P.M. Nat.

Transepithelial HCO3− transport is the principal driving force for fluid secretion by pancreatic duct cells, and reduced HCO3− concentrations result in acidification of the luminal environment. The rheologic properties of mucus are critically affected by mucin concentrations and the pH of solvent. In general, mucin precipitation and viscosity are progressively increased as the pH and the volume of secreted fluid decrease (5Smith B.F. Peetermans J.A. Tanaka T. LaMont J.T. Gastroenterology. 1989; 97: 179-187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 6Bansil R. Stanley E. LaMont J.T. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 635-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Indeed, the most prominent changes observed in the pancreatic juice of obstructive ductal diseases, such as cystic fibrosis (CF)1 or chronic pancreatitis, are reductions in secreted volume and HCO3− concentration (2Johansen P.G. Anderson C.M. Hadorn B. Lancet. 1968; 1: 455-460Abstract Google Scholar, 7Cohn J.A. Friedman K.J. Noone P.G. Knowles M.R. Silverman L.M. Jowell P.S. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 339: 653-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar).Although there is some disagreement on the precise mechanism of ductal HCO3− secretion, it is widely accepted that the bulk of HCO3− secretion is mediated by Cl−/HCO3− exchange on the luminal membrane (8Sohma Y. Gray M.A. Imai Y. Argent B.E. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 176: 77-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Previously, we showed that cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) activates Cl−/HCO3− exchange activity in heterologous expression systems and in the luminal membrane of pancreatic duct (9Lee M.G.

Strickland E. Thomas P.J. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14670-14677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Notably, the CFTR-dependent HCO3−/Cl− transport ratio in each CF-causing CFTR mutation appears to correlate well with the reported disease severity, especially with the pancreatic status of patients (11Choi J.Y. Muallem D. Kiselyov K. Lee M.G. Thomas P.J. Muallem S. Nature. 2001; 410: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar).An increase in intracellular cAMP by secretin is one of the major signals of pancreatic HCO3− secretion. Activation of the CFTR Cl− channel and the CFTR-dependent Cl−/HCO3− exchange activities was shown to be responsible for cAMP-induced HCO3− secretion (1Argent B.E. Case R.M. Johnson E.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 1473-1497Google Scholar,8Sohma Y. Gray M.A. Imai Y. Argent B.E. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 176: 77-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It was also shown that cAMP increases electrogenic HCO3− permeability in the luminal membrane of guinea pig pancreas through a mechanism that has not been identified (12Ishiguro H. Naruse S. Steward M.C. Kitagawa M., Ko, S.B.H. Hayakawa T. Case R.M. J. Physiol. (Lond). 1998; 511: 407-422Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In addition, intracellular calcium signaling evoked by various stimuli, such as activations of cholinergic, purinergic (P2R), and protease-activated receptors (PAR), is also known to increase fluid and HCO3− secretion either directly or by potentiating cAMP-mediated mechanisms (1Argent B.E. Case R.M. Johnson E.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 1473-1497Google Scholar, 13Luo X. Zheng W. Yan M. Lee M.G. Muallem S. Am. J.

Cholinergic activation through vagal efferent fibers is the major physiologic stimulus for the cephalic phase of pancreatic secretion. Recent studies have demonstrated that P2Rs control fluid and the HCO3−secretion of many epithelial cells including pancreatic duct cells, in an auto- or paracrine manner (13Luo X. Zheng W. Yan M. Lee M.G. Muallem S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C205-C215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Sorensen C.E. Novak I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32925-32932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Moreover, PARs, which can be activated by interstitially released trypsin during pancreatic inflammation, have been suggested to increase pancreatic secretion (14Kawabata A. Nishikawa H. Kuroda R. Kawai K. Hollenberg M.D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 1808-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar,17Nguyen T.D. Moody M.W. Steinhoff M. Okolo C. Koh D.S. Bunnett N.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the precise mechanism of calcium-induced HCO3− and fluid secretion in pancreatic duct cells.In the present study, we report that calcium signals activate CFTR- and Cl−-dependent HCO3− transport in the luminal membrane of pancreatic duct-derived cells. ATP and trypsin were found to increase the luminal Cl−/HCO3− exchange activity of CAPAN-1 cells expressing wild type (WT)-CFTR, and this was inhibited by buffering [Ca2+]i with 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N,N′-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA). The effects of ATP on luminal Cl−/HCO3− exchange were not prominent in CFPAC-1 cells bearing a defective form (Δ508) of CFTR, although ATP evoked significant calcium signaling in the cells. Notably, adenoviral transfection of WT-CFTR in CFPAC-1 cells increased ATP-activated luminal Cl−/HCO3− exchange. These results provide the molecular basis for calcium-induced bicarbonate secretion by pancreatic duct cells and possibly by other epithelial cells.DISCUSSIONThe coordinated actions of various transporters on both the luminal and basolateral membranes of pancreatic duct cells perform transepithelial HCO3− transport. Although the precise mechanisms of how duct cells can secrete such high concentrations of HCO3− (up to 140 mm) are unknown, the following two processes are generally accepted as important pathways of ductal HCO3− secretion (8Sohma Y. Gray M.A. Imai Y. Argent B.E. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 176: 77-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). First, CFTR performs a critical role in HCO3− secretion. This is supported by the observation that HCO3− secretion is severely defective in the pancreatic juice of CF patients (2Johansen P.G. Anderson C.M. Hadorn B. Lancet. 1968; 1: 455-460Abstract Google Scholar, 3Kopelman H. Durie P. Gaskin K. Weizman Z. Forstner N. Engl. J. Med. 1985; 312: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Second, Cl−/HCO3− exchange at the luminal membrane mediates significant portions of HCO3−secretion and accounts for the transport of at least 70–80 mm concentrations of HCO3− in the pancreatic juice (8Sohma Y. Gray M.A. Imai Y. Argent B.E. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 176: 77-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that the activity of luminal Cl−/HCO3− exchange depends on CFTR expression (9Lee M.G. Wigley W.C. Zeng W. Noel L.E. Marino C.R. Thomas P.J. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3414-3421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 10Lee M.G. Choi J.Y. Luo X. Strickland E. Thomas P.J. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14670-14677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). A series of studies support the notion that CFTR-dependent pancreatic HCO3− secretion is critical for maintaining the patency of ductal trees (2Johansen P.G. Anderson C.M. Hadorn B. Lancet. 1968; 1: 455-460Abstract Google Scholar, 3Kopelman H. Durie P. Gaskin K. Weizman Z. Forstner N. Engl. J. Med. 1985; 312: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 11Choi J.Y. Muallem D. Kiselyov K. Lee M.G. Thomas P.J. Muallem S. Nature. 2001; 410: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Thus, the impairment of this process was suggested to be an important pathologic mechanism in mutated CFTR-related pancreatic damage and possibly other organ pathologies (4Quinton P.M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 292-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).It has long been known that calcium agonists such as cholecystokinin or acetylcholine can increase fluid and HCO3− secretion and that these have a strong potentiatory effect when combined with cAMP agonists, such as secretin or vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), in in vivo experiments (1Argent B.E. Case R.M. Johnson E.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 1473-1497Google Scholar, 15Szalmay G. Varga G. Kajiyama F. Yang X.S. Lang T.F. Case R.M. Steward M.C. J. Physiol. (Lond). 2001; 535: 795-807Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for Ca2+-induced fluid and HCO3− secretion are largely unknown. Recently, it was suggested that the activation of the Ca2+-activated Cl− channel by P2R activation in pancreatic duct cells can stimulate HCO3− secretion by the parallel activation of electroneutral Cl−/HCO3− exchange, as a substitute for CFTR Cl− channel (25Zsembery A. Strazzabosco M. Graf J. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2345-2356Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, this study focused on electrogenic Cl− conductance, not on electroneutral Cl−/HCO3− exchange, the transporter that actually mediates HCO3− transport. Moreover, the study was undertaken in nonpolarized cultures, and thus it is impossible to isolate the luminal membrane-specific effect.Our results demonstrate that calcium agonists activate CFTR- and Cl−-dependent HCO3− transport in the luminal membrane of pancreatic duct cells. 1) Activation of P2R or PAR stimulated luminal Cl−/HCO3−exchange only in CAPAN-1 cells expressing WT-CFTR, but not in CFPAC-1 cells bearing an impaired CFTR, although the calcium agonists evoked similar [Ca2+]i elevation in both cells (Figs. 1 and 4). 2) The stimulatory effects of calcium agonists on luminal Cl−/HCO3− exchange were well correlated with the duration of high [Ca2+]i peak, and these effects were completely abolished by BAPTA pretreatment (Fig. 7). Although other Gq-coupled events such as the activation of PKC (27Jia Y. Mathews C.J. Hanrahan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4978-4984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) or the direct stimulation by heterotrimeric G proteins (28Reddy M.M. Sun D. Quinton P.M. J. Membr. Biol. 2001; 179: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) cannot be completely excluded as a possible stimulatory mechanism, the above findings suggest that [Ca2+]iincrease is a prerequisite for the P2R- or PAR-mediated stimulation of luminal Cl−/HCO3− exchange. 3) Notably, exogenous CFTR expression by Ad-CFTR transfection substantially increased the stimulatory effect of calcium agonists on luminal Cl−/HCO3− exchange in CFPAC-1 cells (Fig. 6).Although cAMP is regarded as the major intracellular signal for HCO3− secretion, agonists that evoke calcium signals also stimulate HCO3− secretion in many CFTR-expressing epithelia. Therefore, it is not surprising that not only cAMP-activated but also Ca2+-activated HCO3− secretion was found to be impaired in the intestinal epithelia of CFTR(−/−) mice (29Seidler U. Blumenstein I. Kretz A. Viellard-Baron D. Rossmann H. Colledge W.H. Evans M. Ratcliff R. Gregor M. J. Physiol. (Lond). 1997; 505: 411-423Crossref Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 30Hogan D.L. Crombie D.L. Isenberg J.I. Svendsen P. Schaffalitzky de Muckadell O.B. Ainsworth M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G872-G878PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, purinergic stimulation increased luminal Cl−/HCO3− exchange only by 27% in CFTR-impaired CFPAC-1 cells. However, this value jumped to 164 and 246% in endogenous (CAPAN-1, Fig. 4 B) and exogenous CFTR-expressing cells (CFPAC-1 transfected with 200 m.o.i. of Ad-CFTR, Fig. 6), respectively. These findings are comparable with the data obtained from mouse duodenum in which cholinergic stimulation increased HCO3− secretion by 168% in CFTR(+/+) mice but only by 67% in CFTR(−/−) mice (30Hogan D.L. Crombie D.L. Isenberg J.I. Svendsen P. Schaffalitzky de Muckadell O.B. Ainsworth M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G872-G878PubMed Google Scholar). When combined, these results suggest that CFTR plays an important role in the epithelial HCO3− secretion mediated by various intracellular signals. Therefore, we expect that without the restoration of CFTR expression in the luminal membrane, the application of calcium agonists such as ATP may regain only a limited amount of HCO3−secretion in CF epithelia, if any.The present findings may be applicable to other CFTR-expressing epithelia. For example, the primary sweat from CF patients is acidic and hypertonic, suggesting that there is some defect in HCO3−-driven fluid secretion (31Quinton P.M. Pediatr. Res. 1982; 16: 533-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 32Sato K. Sato F. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1990; 115: 504-511PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the physiologic stimuli for sweat secretion, both sympathetic and parasympathetic, are mediated by calcium-coupled cholinergic receptors. Although it was originally hinted from studies upon sweat glands that the disease-related protein, which we call now CFTR, is a cAMP-activated Cl− channel (33Quinton P.M. Nature. 1982; 301: 421-422Crossref Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 34Bijman J. Quinton P.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 247: C10-C13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the cAMP signal is not the major physiologic signal in human sweat glands (35Quinton P.M. The Second Joseph Levy Memorial Lecture. Cystic Fibrosis Trust, Bromley, Kent, UK1994Google Scholar). According to the present study, a defect in Ca2+-activated HCO3− transport, which depends on CFTR expression, can be used to explain the puzzling abnormalities of CF sweat.In addition to the classical cholinergic and cholecystokinin pathways, recent studies have revealed the importance of other calcium-related receptors, such as P2R and PAR, in the regulation of pancreatic fluid and HCO3− secretion. An interesting suggestion is that cholinergic stimulation releases ATP from zymogen granules in acinar cells, and that this in turn activates P2Rs in the luminal membrane of duct cells (16Sorensen C.E. Novak I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32925-32932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Combining the present data of P2R-induced HCO3− secretion with the above idea provides a possible molecular basis for the strong potentiation of pancreatic fluid secretion by cholinergic stimulations in vivo.The activation of PARs, which may be prominent during pancreatic inflammation due to proteolytic cleavage by tryptase released from mast cells or autoactivated trypsin from acinar cells (23Vergnolle N. Aliment. Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 14: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), evokes a complicated pattern of pancreatic juice secretion, characterized by a prompt increase followed by a transient suppression and a subsequent protracted increase (14Kawabata A. Nishikawa H. Kuroda R. Kawai K. Hollenberg M.D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 1808-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Observations made in the present study may provide explanations for this complicated pattern of secretion. Initial PAR activation caused a single calcium peak, but subsequent application of agonists did not evoke calcium signaling due to receptor internalization and degradation. Cells began to regain their response to PAR agonists 30 min after initial stimulation caused by new receptor expression on the membrane (see Fig. 1 and the relevant result section). Therefore, the secretory activity by PAR stimulation closely follows [Ca2+]i increase and subsequent Cl−/HCO3− exchange activity.In conclusion, the regulation of HCO3− transport by calcium signaling demonstrated here may be of particular significance for the understanding of the physiologic and pathologic roles of calcium-mediated bicarbonate secretion. Activation of CFTR- and Cl−-dependent HCO3− transport provide the molecular basis for pancreatic fluid and bicarbonate secretion by calcium agonists. In addition, impairments in the above mechanism can explain the puzzling defect of calcium-induced HCO3− secretion in several CF epithelia including intestinal mucosa and sweat glands, which, in turn, highlights the general importance of CFTR in epithelial bicarbonate secretion induced by various stimuli. It is well established that pancreatic HCO3− secretion performs a critical role in digestion. HCO3− protects duodenal epithelia by neutralizing gastric acid and maintains an optimum intraluminal pH for digestive enzymes (1Argent B.E. Case R.M. Johnson E.R.

Accumulating evidence suggests that HCO3−-rich pancreatic fluid secretion is also important for maintaining the patency of intrapancreatic ductal trees (2Johansen P.G. Anderson C.M. Hadorn B. Lancet. 1968; 1: 455-460Abstract Google Scholar, 3Kopelman H. Durie P. Gaskin K. Weizman Z. Forstner N. Engl. J. Med. 1985; 312: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 4Quinton P.M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 292-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Transepithelial HCO3− transport is the principal driving force for fluid secretion by pancreatic duct cells, and reduced HCO3− concentrations result in acidification of the luminal environment. The rheologic properties of mucus are critically affected by mucin concentrations and the pH of solvent. In general, mucin precipitation and viscosity are progressively increased as the pH and the volume of secreted fluid decrease (5Smith B.F. Peetermans J.A. Tanaka T. LaMont J.T. Gastroenterology. 1989; 97: 179-187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 6Bansil R. Stanley E. LaMont J.T. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 635-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Indeed, the most prominent changes observed in the pancreatic juice of obstructive ductal diseases, such as cystic fibrosis (CF)1 or chronic pancreatitis, are reductions in secreted volume and HCO3− concentration (2Johansen P.G. Anderson C.M. Hadorn B. Lancet. 1968; 1: 455-460Abstract Google Scholar, 7Cohn J.A. Friedman K.J. Noone P.G. Knowles M.R. Silverman L.M. Jowell P.S. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 339: 653-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Although there is some disagreement on the precise mechanism of ductal HCO3− secretion, it is widely accepted that the bulk of HCO3− secretion is mediated by Cl−/HCO3− exchange on the luminal membrane (8Sohma Y. Gray M.A. Imai Y. Argent B.E. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 176: 77-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Previously, we showed that cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) activates Cl−/HCO3− exchange activity in heterologous expression systems and in the luminal membrane of pancreatic duct (9Lee M.G.

Strickland E. Thomas P.J. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14670-14677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Notably, the CFTR-dependent HCO3−/Cl− transport ratio in each CF-causing CFTR mutation appears to correlate well with the reported disease severity, especially with the pancreatic status of patients (11Choi J.Y. Muallem D. Kiselyov K. Lee M.G. Thomas P.J. Muallem S. Nature. 2001; 410: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). An increase in intracellular cAMP by secretin is one of the major signals of pancreatic HCO3− secretion. Activation of the CFTR Cl− channel and the CFTR-dependent Cl−/HCO3− exchange activities was shown to be responsible for cAMP-induced HCO3− secretion (1Argent B.E. Case R.M. Johnson E.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 1473-1497Google Scholar,8Sohma Y. Gray M.A. Imai Y. Argent B.E. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 176: 77-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It was also shown that cAMP increases electrogenic HCO3− permeability in the luminal membrane of guinea pig pancreas through a mechanism that has not been identified (12Ishiguro H. Naruse S. Steward M.C. Kitagawa M., Ko, S.B.H. Hayakawa T. Case R.M. J. Physiol. (Lond). 1998; 511: 407-422Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In addition, intracellular calcium signaling evoked by various stimuli, such as activations of cholinergic, purinergic (P2R), and protease-activated receptors (PAR), is also known to increase fluid and HCO3− secretion either directly or by potentiating cAMP-mediated mechanisms (1Argent B.E. Case R.M. Johnson E.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 1473-1497Google Scholar, 13Luo X. Zheng W. Yan M. Lee M.G. Muallem S. Am. J.

Cholinergic activation through vagal efferent fibers is the major physiologic stimulus for the cephalic phase of pancreatic secretion. Recent studies have demonstrated that P2Rs control fluid and the HCO3−secretion of many epithelial cells including pancreatic duct cells, in an auto- or paracrine manner (13Luo X. Zheng W. Yan M. Lee M.G. Muallem S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C205-C215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Sorensen C.E. Novak I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32925-32932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Moreover, PARs, which can be activated by interstitially released trypsin during pancreatic inflammation, have been suggested to increase pancreatic secretion (14Kawabata A. Nishikawa H. Kuroda R. Kawai K. Hollenberg M.D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 1808-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar,17Nguyen T.D. Moody M.W. Steinhoff M. Okolo C. Koh D.S. Bunnett N.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the precise mechanism of calcium-induced HCO3− and fluid secretion in pancreatic duct cells. In the present study, we report that calcium signals activate CFTR- and Cl−-dependent HCO3− transport in the luminal membrane of pancreatic duct-derived cells. ATP and trypsin were found to increase the luminal Cl−/HCO3− exchange activity of CAPAN-1 cells expressing wild type (WT)-CFTR, and this was inhibited by buffering [Ca2+]i with 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N,N′-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA). The effects of ATP on luminal Cl−/HCO3− exchange were not prominent in CFPAC-1 cells bearing a defective form (Δ508) of CFTR, although ATP evoked significant calcium signaling in the cells. Notably, adenoviral transfection of WT-CFTR in CFPAC-1 cells increased ATP-activated luminal Cl−/HCO3− exchange. These results provide the molecular basis for calcium-induced bicarbonate secretion by pancreatic duct cells and possibly by other epithelial cells. DISCUSSIONThe coordinated actions of various transporters on both the luminal and basolateral membranes of pancreatic duct cells perform transepithelial HCO3− transport. Although the precise mechanisms of how duct cells can secrete such high concentrations of HCO3− (up to 140 mm) are unknown, the following two processes are generally accepted as important pathways of ductal HCO3− secretion (8Sohma Y. Gray M.A. Imai Y. Argent B.E. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 176: 77-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). First, CFTR performs a critical role in HCO3− secretion. This is supported by the observation that HCO3− secretion is severely defective in the pancreatic juice of CF patients (2Johansen P.G. Anderson C.M. Hadorn B. Lancet. 1968; 1: 455-460Abstract Google Scholar, 3Kopelman H. Durie P. Gaskin K. Weizman Z. Forstner N. Engl. J. Med. 1985; 312: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Second, Cl−/HCO3− exchange at the luminal membrane mediates significant portions of HCO3−secretion and accounts for the transport of at least 70–80 mm concentrations of HCO3− in the pancreatic juice (8Sohma Y. Gray M.A. Imai Y. Argent B.E. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 176: 77-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that the activity of luminal Cl−/HCO3− exchange depends on CFTR expression (9Lee M.G. Wigley W.C. Zeng W. Noel L.E. Marino C.R. Thomas P.J. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3414-3421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 10Lee M.G. Choi J.Y. Luo X. Strickland E. Thomas P.J. Muallem S. J. Biol.

A series of studies support the notion that CFTR-dependent pancreatic HCO3− secretion is critical for maintaining the patency of ductal trees (2Johansen P.G. Anderson C.M. Hadorn B. Lancet. 1968; 1: 455-460Abstract Google Scholar, 3Kopelman H. Durie P. Gaskin K. Weizman Z. Forstner N. Engl. J. Med. 1985; 312: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 11Choi J.Y. Muallem D. Kiselyov K. Lee M.G. Thomas P.J. Muallem S. Nature. 2001; 410: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Thus, the impairment of this process was suggested to be an important pathologic mechanism in mutated CFTR-related pancreatic damage and possibly other organ pathologies (4Quinton P.M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 292-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).It has long been known that calcium agonists such as cholecystokinin or acetylcholine can increase fluid and HCO3− secretion and that these have a strong potentiatory effect when combined with cAMP agonists, such as secretin or vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), in in vivo experiments (1Argent B.E. Case R.M. Johnson E.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 1473-1497Google Scholar, 15Szalmay G. Varga G. Kajiyama F. Yang X.S. Lang T.F. Case R.M. Steward M.C. J. Physiol. (Lond). 2001; 535: 795-807Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for Ca2+-induced fluid and HCO3− secretion are largely unknown. Recently, it was suggested that the activation of the Ca2+-activated Cl− channel by P2R activation in pancreatic duct cells can stimulate HCO3− secretion by the parallel activation of electroneutral Cl−/HCO3− exchange, as a substitute for CFTR Cl− channel (25Zsembery A. Strazzabosco M. Graf J. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2345-2356Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, this study focused on electrogenic Cl− conductance, not on electroneutral Cl−/HCO3− exchange, the transporter that actually mediates HCO3− transport. Moreover, the study was undertaken in nonpolarized cultures, and thus it is impossible to isolate the luminal membrane-specific effect.Our results demonstrate that calcium agonists activate CFTR- and Cl−-dependent HCO3− transport in the luminal membrane of pancreatic duct cells. 1) Activation of P2R or PAR stimulated luminal Cl−/HCO3−exchange only in CAPAN-1 cells expressing WT-CFTR, but not in CFPAC-1 cells bearing an impaired CFTR, although the calcium agonists evoked similar [Ca2+]i elevation in both cells (Figs. 1 and 4). 2) The stimulatory effects of calcium agonists on luminal Cl−/HCO3− exchange were well correlated with the duration of high [Ca2+]i peak, and these effects were completely abolished by BAPTA pretreatment (Fig. 7). Although other Gq-coupled events such as the activation of PKC (27Jia Y. Mathews C.J. Hanrahan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4978-4984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) or the direct stimulation by heterotrimeric G proteins (28Reddy M.M. Sun D. Quinton P.M. J. Membr. Biol. 2001; 179: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) cannot be completely excluded as a possible stimulatory mechanism, the above findings suggest that [Ca2+]iincrease is a prerequisite for the P2R- or PAR-mediated stimulation of luminal Cl−/HCO3− exchange. 3) Notably, exogenous CFTR expression by Ad-CFTR transfection substantially increased the stimulatory effect of calcium agonists on luminal Cl−/HCO3− exchange in CFPAC-1 cells (Fig. 6).Although cAMP is regarded as the major intracellular signal for HCO3− secretion, agonists that evoke calcium signals also stimulate HCO3− secretion in many CFTR-expressing epithelia. Therefore, it is not surprising that not only cAMP-activated but also Ca2+-activated HCO3− secretion was found to be impaired in the intestinal epithelia of CFTR(−/−) mice (29Seidler U. Blumenstein I. Kretz A. Viellard-Baron D. Rossmann H. Colledge W.H. Evans M. Ratcliff R. Gregor M. J. Physiol. (Lond). 1997; 505: 411-423Crossref Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 30Hogan D.L. Crombie D.L. Isenberg J.I. Svendsen P. Schaffalitzky de Muckadell O.B. Ainsworth M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G872-G878PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, purinergic stimulation increased luminal Cl−/HCO3− exchange only by 27% in CFTR-impaired CFPAC-1 cells. However, this value jumped to 164 and 246% in endogenous (CAPAN-1, Fig. 4 B) and exogenous CFTR-expressing cells (CFPAC-1 transfected with 200 m.o.i. of Ad-CFTR, Fig. 6), respectively. These findings are comparable with the data obtained from mouse duodenum in which cholinergic stimulation increased HCO3− secretion by 168% in CFTR(+/+) mice but only by 67% in CFTR(−/−) mice (30Hogan D.L. Crombie D.L. Isenberg J.I. Svendsen P. Schaffalitzky de Muckadell O.B. Ainsworth M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G872-G878PubMed Google Scholar). When combined, these results suggest that CFTR plays an important role in the epithelial HCO3− secretion mediated by various intracellular signals. Therefore, we expect that without the restoration of CFTR expression in the luminal membrane, the application of calcium agonists such as ATP may regain only a limited amount of HCO3−secretion in CF epithelia, if any.The present findings may be applicable to other CFTR-expressing epithelia. For example, the primary sweat from CF patients is acidic and hypertonic, suggesting that there is some defect in HCO3−-driven fluid secretion (31Quinton P.M. Pediatr. Res. 1982; 16: 533-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 32Sato K. Sato F. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1990; 115: 504-511PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the physiologic stimuli for sweat secretion, both sympathetic and parasympathetic, are mediated by calcium-coupled cholinergic receptors. Although it was originally hinted from studies upon sweat glands that the disease-related protein, which we call now CFTR, is a cAMP-activated Cl− channel (33Quinton P.M. Nature. 1982; 301: 421-422Crossref Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 34Bijman J. Quinton P.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 247: C10-C13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the cAMP signal is not the major physiologic signal in human sweat glands (35Quinton P.M. The Second Joseph Levy Memorial Lecture. Cystic Fibrosis Trust, Bromley, Kent, UK1994Google Scholar). According to the present study, a defect in Ca2+-activated HCO3− transport, which depends on CFTR expression, can be used to explain the puzzling abnormalities of CF sweat.In addition to the classical cholinergic and cholecystokinin pathways, recent studies have revealed the importance of other calcium-related receptors, such as P2R and PAR, in the regulation of pancreatic fluid and HCO3− secretion. An interesting suggestion is that cholinergic stimulation releases ATP from zymogen granules in acinar cells, and that this in turn activates P2Rs in the luminal membrane of duct cells (16Sorensen C.E. Novak I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32925-32932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Combining the present data of P2R-induced HCO3− secretion with the above idea provides a possible molecular basis for the strong potentiation of pancreatic fluid secretion by cholinergic stimulations in vivo.The activation of PARs, which may be prominent during pancreatic inflammation due to proteolytic cleavage by tryptase released from mast cells or autoactivated trypsin from acinar cells (23Vergnolle N. Aliment. Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 14: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), evokes a complicated pattern of pancreatic juice secretion, characterized by a prompt increase followed by a transient suppression and a subsequent protracted increase (14Kawabata A. Nishikawa H. Kuroda R. Kawai K. Hollenberg M.D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 1808-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Observations made in the present study may provide explanations for this complicated pattern of secretion. Initial PAR activation caused a single calcium peak, but subsequent application of agonists did not evoke calcium signaling due to receptor internalization and degradation. Cells began to regain their response to PAR agonists 30 min after initial stimulation caused by new receptor expression on the membrane (see Fig. 1 and the relevant result section). Therefore, the secretory activity by PAR stimulation closely follows [Ca2+]i increase and subsequent Cl−/HCO3− exchange activity.In conclusion, the regulation of HCO3− transport by calcium signaling demonstrated here may be of particular significance for the understanding of the physiologic and pathologic roles of calcium-mediated bicarbonate secretion. Activation of CFTR- and Cl−-dependent HCO3− transport provide the molecular basis for pancreatic fluid and bicarbonate secretion by calcium agonists. In addition, impairments in the above mechanism can explain the puzzling defect of calcium-induced HCO3− secretion in several CF epithelia including intestinal mucosa and sweat glands, which, in turn, highlights the general importance of CFTR in epithelial bicarbonate secretion induced by various stimuli. The coordinated actions of various transporters on both the luminal and basolateral membranes of pancreatic duct cells perform transepithelial HCO3− transport. Although the precise mechanisms of how duct cells can secrete such high concentrations of HCO3− (up to 140 mm) are unknown, the following two processes are generally accepted as important pathways of ductal HCO3− secretion (8Sohma Y.

Ther. 2000; 14: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), evokes a complicated pattern of pancreatic juice secretion, characterized by a prompt increase followed by a transient suppression and a subsequent protracted increase (14Kawabata A. Nishikawa H. Kuroda R. Kawai K. Hollenberg M.D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 1808-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Observations made in the present study may provide explanations for this complicated pattern of secretion. Initial PAR activation caused a single calcium peak, but subsequent application of agonists did not evoke calcium signaling due to receptor internalization and degradation. Cells began to regain their response to PAR agonists 30 min after initial stimulation caused by new receptor expression on the membrane (see Fig. 1 and the relevant result section). Therefore, the secretory activity by PAR stimulation closely follows [Ca2+]i increase and subsequent Cl−/HCO3− exchange activity. In conclusion, the regulation of HCO3− transport by calcium signaling demonstrated here may be of particular significance for the understanding of the physiologic and pathologic roles of calcium-mediated bicarbonate secretion. Activation of CFTR- and Cl−-dependent HCO3− transport provide the molecular basis for pancreatic fluid and bicarbonate secretion by calcium agonists. In addition, impairments in the above mechanism can explain the puzzling defect of calcium-induced HCO3− secretion in several CF epithelia including intestinal mucosa and sweat glands, which, in turn, highlights the general importance of CFTR in epithelial bicarbonate secretion induced by various stimuli.

https://openalex.org/W2031206045,"Cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and apoptosis have been implicated in the loss of contractile function during heart failure (HF). Moreover, patients with HF have been shown to exhibit increased levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in the myocardium. However, the multiple signal transduction pathways generating from the TNF-alpha receptor in cardiomyocytes and leading preferentially to apoptosis or hypertrophy are still unknown. Here we demonstrate in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes that 1) TNF-alpha induces phosphorylation of AKT, activation of NF-kappaB, and the phosphorylation of JUN kinase; 2) blocking AKT activity prevents NF-kappaB activation, suggesting a role for AKT in regulating NF-kappaB function; 3) AKT and JUN are both critical for the hypertrophic effects of TNF-alpha, since dominant-negative mutants of these genes are capable of inhibiting TNF-alpha-induced ANF-promoter up-regulation and increase in cardiomyocyte cell size, and 4) blocking NF-kappaB, AKT, or JUN alone or in combination does not sensitize cardiomyocytes to the proapoptotic effects of TNF-alpha, in contrast to other cell types, suggesting a cardiac-specific pathway regulating the anti-apoptotic events induced by TNF-alpha. Altogether, the data presented evidence the role of AKT and JUN in TNF-alpha-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2044913614,"We used mass spectrometry to identify proteins that are released in the gas phase from Escherichia coliribosomes in response to a range of different solution conditions and cofactor binding. From solution at neutral pH the spectra are dominated by just 4 of the 54 ribosomal proteins (L7/L12, L11, and L10). Lowering the pH of the solution leads to the gas phase dissociation of four additional proteins as well as the 5 S RNA. Replacement of Mg2+ by Li+ ions in solutions of ribosomes induced the dissociation of 17 ribosomal proteins. Correlation of these results with available structural information for ribosomes revealed that a relatively high interaction surface area of the protein with RNA was the major force in preventing dissociation. By using the proteins that dissociate to probe their interactions with RNA, we examined different complexes of the ribosome formed with the elongation factor G and inhibited by fusidic acid or thiostrepton. Mass spectra recorded for the fusidic acid-inhibited complex reveal subtle changes in peak intensity of the proteins that dissociate. By contrast gas phase dissociation from the thiostrepton-inhibited complex is markedly different and demonstrates the presence of L5 and L18, two proteins that interact exclusively with the 5 S RNA.

Moore P.B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 144-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), is composed of two unequal subunits the 30 S and 50 S that together constitute the intact 70 S. This macromolecular assembly which in Escherichia coli consists of 54 proteins and 3 RNA molecules has a molecular mass of 2.3 MDa. We have shown previously by using MS1that it is possible to maintain the non-covalent associations ofE. coli ribosomes in the gas phase (2Benjamin D.R. Robinson C.V. Hendrick J.P. Hartl F.U. Dobson C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7391-7395Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 3Rostom A.A. Fucini P. Benjamin D.R. Juenemann R. Nierhaus K.H. Hartl F.U. Dobson C.M.

Benjamin D.R. Juenemann R. Nierhaus K.H. Hartl F.U. Dobson C.M. Robinson C.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Unlike the stalk proteins, the majority of ribosomal proteins has been shown by x-ray crystallography to be largely globular with highly basic polypeptide tails, 26% of the amino acid composition being either arginine or lysine, and having little or no secondary structure. These tails insert into crevices between RNA helices in the ribosomal subunits and act to maintain the structure of the ribosome (4Moore P.B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3243-32450Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Previously, we observed that the proteins that are released in the mass spectrometer (3Rostom A.A. Fucini P. Benjamin D.R. Juenemann R. Nierhaus K.H. Hartl F.U. Dobson C.M. Robinson C.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5185-5190Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) are among the most acidic of the ribosomal proteins (5Kaltschmidt E. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 43: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) implying that dissociation of proteins from ribosomes in the gas phase is in part dependent on reducing the positive charge of the protein, thereby weakening interactions with negatively charged RNA. In addition to detailed structural information, considerable insight into the mechanistic details of protein synthesis has also arisen from atomic resolution images of the ribosome. The original picture of a multistep process requiring a number of protein factors that hydrolyze GTP (6Kaziro Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 505: 95-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) is emerging with atomic detail (7Nissen P. Hansen J. Ban N. Moore P. Steitz T. Science. 2000; 289: 905-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (1766) Google Scholar). The elongation phase of protein synthesis begins with the insertion of an aminoacyl-tRNA into the aminoacyl site by elongation factor EF-Tu. Subsequent binding of the elongation factor G (EF-G) to the ribosome triggers the movement of tRNA from the aminoacyl to the peptidyltransferase site in a process known as translocation. EF-G binding to the ribosome is labile but can be trapped using antibiotics. Fusidic acid allows translocation and GTP cleavage but prevents the release of EF-G from the ribosome and traps the ribosome in the post-translocational state (post-state) (8Bodley J.W. Zieve F.J. Lin L. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 5662-5667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Bodley J.W. Zieve F.J. Lin L. Zieve S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 5656-5661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast thiostrepton does not bind directly to EF-G or affect factor binding and GTP hydrolysis, rather it is reported to bind directly to RNA in a region close the L11-binding site (10Thompson J. Cundliffe E. Biochimie (Paris). 1991; 73: 1131-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and traps the ribosome in a pre-translocational state (pre-state). Thiostrepton has been shown to block translocation even in the absence of EF-G (11Hausner T.P. Atmadja J. Nierhaus K.H. Biochimie (Paris). 1987; 69: 911-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and recently under certain conditions to prevent complex formation (12Cameron D. Thompson J. March P. Dahlberg A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to a report where inhibition of phosphate ion and EF-G release from the ribosome was inferred (13Rodnina M.V. Savelsbergh A. Matassova N.B. Katunin V.I. Semenkov Y.P. Wintermeyer W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9586-9590Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies have also revealed changes of conformation of the ribosome upon interaction with elongation factors, in particular protein L12 and its acetylated counterpart L7 (14Gudkov A.T. Bubunenko M.G. Biochimie (Paris). 1989; 71: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 15Gudkov A.T. Gongadze G.M. FEBS Lett. 1984; 176: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The results were substantiated by cryo-electron microscopy studies that demonstrate large scale movements in response to binding EF-G (16Frank J. Agrawal R.K. Nature. 2000; 406: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar, 17Agrawal R.K. Penczek P. Grassucci R.A. Frank J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6134-6138Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The primary aim of this study is to investigate the factors that govern the loss of proteins from ribosomes in the mass spectrometer. A secondary aim is to apply the information that can be gained from such experiments to probe conformational changes in complexes of the ribosome. The recent x-ray analyses of 50 S ribosomes fromHaloarcula marismortui (18Ban N. Nissen P. Hansen J. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. Science. 2000; 289: 905-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (2813) Google Scholar) and the 30 S subunit from Thermus thermophilus (19Wimberley B.T. Brodersen D.E., Jr., W.M.C. Morgan-Warren R.J. Carter A.P. Vonrhein C. Hartsch T. Ramamkrishnan V. Nature. 2000; 407: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar) allows examination of the precise protein-RNA interactions and solvent accessibility for a number of ribosomal proteins and enables us to relate this information to ribosomes from E. coli. To investigate gas phase dissociation, we have manipulated samples of E. coliribosomes, specifically the pH and metal ion content of the solution, and recorded spectra under identical MS conditions. By using the molecular weight calculated from known amino acid sequences to identify the individual ribosomal protein, we examined the relationship between pI of the protein and its interaction with other proteins and with different RNA molecules. These experiments demonstrate, through distinctive protein dissociation patterns, the sensitivity of the approach to changes in RNA structure. By having established a relationship between the surface area of interaction and the propensity for gas phase dissociation, we examined the release of proteins from ribosomes in complexes with the cofactor EF-G in the presence of two inhibitors of elongation: fusidic acid and thiostrepton freezing the ribosome in complexes analogous to post- and pre-translocation states, respectively. The results show that the two EF-G ribosome complexes are significantly different and are indicative of conformational changes in the mobile stalk region and, in the case of the thiostrepton-inhibited complex, of the 5 S RNA molecule itself. Ribosomes were harvested from E. colistrain MRE600 in the log phase of the growth cycle by using standard protocols and were stored in Tico buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 6 mm magnesium acetate, 30 mm ammonium acetate, 4 mm β-mercaptoethanol) (20Spedding G. Spedding G. Ribosomes and Protein Synthesis: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1990: 1-27Google Scholar). Stock solutions were prepared immediately prior to analysis by buffer-exchange at 4 °C to give a final concentration of 1 μm ribosome in 10 mm ammonium acetate (pH 7.0) using Bio-Spin 6 chromatography columns (Bio-Rad) equilibrated previously with 10 mm ammonium acetate at pH 7.0 unless stated otherwise. Although some separation of 70 S particles into 30 S and 50 S subunits is observed in the mass spectrometer as the Mg2+ion concentration is reduced, we have shown previously (21Rostom A.A. Mass Spectrometry of Protein Interactions.Ph.D. thesis. University of Oxford, Oxford, UK1999Google Scholar) that the majority of particles (>90%) remains associated as the 70 S. Moreover, the fact that MS conditions could be found whereby no individual proteins are observed strongly implies that protein-RNA interactions are not perturbed by this treatment (3Rostom A.A. Fucini P. Benjamin D.R. Juenemann R. Nierhaus K.H. Hartl F.U. Dobson C.M. Robinson C.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5185-5190Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). GTP, thiostrepton, and fusidic acid were purchased from Sigma. XL1 cells were transformed with the vector pQE70fusA, which carries the EF-G gene under the pLac promoter. The cells were grown at 37 °C at 300 rpm with aeration, in Luria Broth (LB) containing 100 mg/ml ampicillin. The 6 liters of culture was induced with isopropylthiogalactopyranoside at a final concentration of 1 mm, when cell growth reached a logarithmic phase. The absorbance was 0.45 at 560 nm. The incubation was continued for 4 h after induction. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C and then washed twice in 1 liter of buffer A, pH 7.5, containing 50 mm KHPO4, 10 mm NH4OAc, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 mm NaCl. The final cell pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of buffer A/g of cell pellet. Lysozyme, DNase, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were added to a final concentration of 0.5 and 0.1 g/liter and 0.1 mm, respectively. The mixture was sonicated, and the lysate was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × gfor 45 min at 4 °C. EF-G was purified from the cell extract using a BioCAD system (Applied Biosystems). The supernatant from the last centrifugation process was loaded onto a nickel column equilibrated in buffer A with 10 mm imidazole. The fractions containing EF-G were pooled and dialyzed five times against 30 volumes of buffer A. The final yield of EF-G was 28 mg/g of cell pellet. The EF-G produced by this process has N- and C-terminal extensions of ML and RSHHHHHH, respectively, and two sequence changes I575V and E357A resulting in an increase in mass of 1237 over the calculated mass for the sequence of EF-G from the Swiss Protein Data Bank (codeP02996). Solutions were kept at 4 °C throughout buffer exchange and immediately before electrospray analysis. The precise solution pH was measured as 4.7, 7.0, and 10.8 after addition of the pH 4.5, 7.0, and 11.0 buffered solutions. For the LiCl treatment ribosomes were exchanged into 300 μm LiCl solution and incubated for 30 min. Immediately prior to analysis by MS, samples were buffer-exchanged at 4 °C into 10 mmammonium acetate solution at pH 6.5 and analyzed as described below. EDTA in ethanol was added to 20-μl aliquots of a 1 μmsolution of ribosomes equilibrated with 10 mm ammonium acetate, to give final EDTA concentrations of 50 and 300 μm and 50 mm. Each solution was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The EDTA was removed immediately before analysis using a Bio-Spin 6 column pre-equilibrated with 10 mmammonium acetate, and samples were analyzed as described below. The ribosome-EF-G complex was prepared by using 50 μl of a stock solution of 70 S ribosomes at a concentration of 1.5 μmin 10 mm ammonium acetate, pH 7.0. 40 μl of EF-G from a stock solution at a concentration of 60 μm and 19 μl GTP at a concentration of 3 mm were added to give a final volume of 119 μl. Stock solutions of fusidic acid and thiostrepton were prepared at a concentration of 1 mm in 10 mm ammonium acetate, pH 7.0. For the thiostrepton stock solution it was necessary to add 2% v/v of Me2SO to ensure complete dissolution of the antibiotic. 1 μl of the antibiotic solution, either fusidic acid or thiostrepton, was added to the solution containing ribosomes, EF-G, and GTP after incubation on ice for 1 min. The resulting solution was kept at 4 °C. The molar ratio of 70 S/EF-G/GTP/antibiotic was 1:32:760:13, closely similar to that employed in cryo-EM studies of these complexes (22Agrawal R.K. Heagle A.B. Penczek P. Grassucci R.A. Frank J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 643-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Excess antibiotic was removed before analysis by filtering the reaction mixture through a Bio-Spin 6 column equilibrated with 10 mm ammonium acetate, pH 7.0. To examine the effect of trace amounts of Me2SO on gas phase dissociation from the ribosome, mass spectra were recorded for ribosomes in 10 mm ammonium acetate containing 0.2% (v/v) Me2SO (the maximum amount of Me2SO that could be present in the solution of the complex after 10-fold dilution and after Bio-Spin chromatography). The spectra recorded were identical to those recorded in the absence of Me2SO confirming that at these low concentrations Me2SO does not affect the pattern of gas phase dissociation from ribosomes. Further control experiments were carried out in which a single component from the reaction was omitted, and the solutions were prepared and incubated as described above. In the absence of the antibiotics fusidic acid and thiostrepton, but with identical solvent composition to the inhibited EF-G ribosome complexes, the spectra showed similar patterns of peaks observed routinely for naked ribosomes. In the absence of GTP, EF-G was observed in mass spectra but showed no hydrolysis of GTP. For EF-G in the absence of ribosomes no appreciable hydrolysis of GTP to GDP could be detected. All samples were analyzed by nanoflow electrospray using capillaries prepared as described previously (23Nettleton E.J. Sunde M. Lai V. Kelly J.W. Dobson C.M. Robinson C.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 553-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The high viscosity of the ribosomal samples necessitated the use of needles with large tip orifices and a backing pressure of 10–20 pounds/square inch. 2-μl aliquots of sample were loaded into capillaries, and spectra were recorded on a modified Micromass QToF2 mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK). This modified mass spectrometer has been described in detail elsewhere (24Sobott F. Hernandez H. McCammon M.G. Tito M.A. Robinson C.V. Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 1402-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) and consists of a nanoflow electrospray interface, a low frequency extended mass range quadrupole, capable of isolating ions up tom/z 32,000, followed by a hexapole collision cell, and a time-of-flight (ToF) mass analyzer. The capillary and cone voltages were maintained at 1800 and 80 V, respectively, throughout this investigation. Pressure conditions were maintained at 9 × 10−3 mbar in the hexapole ion guide. For the MS/MS experiments of the 5 S RNA, the peak centered atm/z 3570 was isolated with a window of ±30m/z units. A voltage of 40 V was applied to the collision cell at an argon pressure of 3.0 × 10−2mbar. For the comparison between the EF-G complexes and naked ribosome sample, the same batch of ribosomes was used throughout, and the mass spectra were recorded on the same day to ensure that conditions were entirely reproducible. In addition the use of the same batch of ribosomes ensures that the tRNA content is identical in each of the complexes formed. Control experiments with re-associated ribosomes, in which tRNA is absent, have shown that the dissociation pattern is the same as that observed for naked ribosomes used in this study. The calculated masses of ribosomal proteins from E. coli were calculated from the known amino acid sequences in the Swiss-Prot data base. For the spectra recorded from solutions at different pH values results were calculated from three replicate experiments. The spectra recorded from LiCl solutions were repeated twice, whereas those for complexes were repeated at least in triplicate. The intensities of three charge states from each series were summed, and the average intensity of the peaks assigned to each protein from the replicate experiments was calculated. These values were expressed as a percentage of total intensity assigned to protein peaks in the spectra. It was not possible to deconvolute the peaks assigned to L7/L12 because of extensive metal ion binding under neutral pH solution conditions. However, because low pH conditions confirm their equal population on the ribosome, the intensity of the peaks assigned to L7/L12 was divided by two, and only the intensity calculated for L12 is displayed. Because only three small subunit proteins (S1, S8, and S10) are released in mass spectra from the different solution conditions, it was difficult to draw conclusions about the extent of protein dissociation from 16 S RNA. This study therefore focuses on interactions in the large subunit. For the large subunit 16 proteins were released from the 23 S and 5 S RNA molecules. To calculate the extent of protein-protein and protein-rRNA interactions, the solvent-accessible surface areas of the protein, buried in the respective contact, was calculated (ΔSASA). These values were calculated using a modified version of the program NACCESS (25Hubbard S.J. The Analysis of Protein-Protein Recognition.Ph.D. thesis. University of London, London1992Google Scholar), which implements the algorithm of Lee and Richards (26Lee B. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 55: 379-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (5360) Google Scholar). Default atomic radii (27Chothia C. Nature. 1974; 248: 338-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar) and a standard probe radius of 1.4 Å were used. The buried surface area ΔSASA was computed for protein-rRNA and protein-protein interactions in the 50 S subunit. The results showed the same trends for ΔSASA when both protein backbone and side chain atoms are computed as when only backbone atoms are considered. Because only a limited data set is available for the three-dimensional structure of protein backbone and side chains (12 proteins from the 50 S as opposed to 21 for which only backbone coordinates have been deposited, Protein Data Bank accession code 1KQS), the larger data set was used to enable trends to be established. Both protein-RNA and protein-protein interactions in the 50 S subunit were calculated. However, given that L12 is associated solely through protein-protein interactions and is readily observed in mass spectra, such interactions are clearly not the driving force for maintaining the gas phase ribosome. Moreover with the exception of L7, L3, and L14, all other proteins interact exclusively with rRNA and no other proteins. Therefore, to examine the correlation between the extent of protein dissociation in the mass spectrometer and protein-rRNA interactions, protein-protein interactions were not included. Considering only protein-rRNA interactions the values calculated for L7, L3, and L14 are reduced by 65, 2.6, and 45%, respectively, from the values calculated for protein-protein and protein-rRNA interactions. Protein interaction surface area calculated in this way will depend at least in part on the size of the protein. In order to reduce this dependence, the ΔSASA was divided by the molecular mass of the protein. This value is then plotted against the extent of protein dissociation calculated from the mass spectra from the different solution conditions. Solutions of E. coli ribosomes were prepared over a range of pH values to examine the influence of pH on the dissociation of proteins (see “Experimental Procedures”). An example of a typical spectrum recorded for a solution of E. coliribosomes at pH 7.0 is shown (Fig. 1 A). Assignment of the peaks together with the known masses of the ribosomal proteins shows that spectra are dominated by L10, L11, and L7/L12. Under these MS and solution conditions, no intact stalk complex was observed, in contrast to our previous experiments, as in this case the mass spectrometer was optimized for dissociation of proteins (2Benjamin D.R. Robinson C.V. Hendrick J.P. Hartl F.U. Dobson C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7391-7395Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 3Rostom A.A. Fucini P. Benjamin D.R. Juenemann R. Nierhaus K.H. Hartl F.U. Dobson C.M. Robinson C.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5185-5190Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Observation of these individual proteins from solution at neutral pH is attributed to their preferential gas phase dissociation from the intact ribosome. These proteins are located in the 50 S stalk region together with the protein L11, located immediately at the base of the stalk complex. The intensity of the peaks assigned to the proteins L10 and L11 is much lower than those of L7/L12. Intensity in a mass spectrum is governed by the interplay of many different factors, and in this case can be attributed at least in part to the fact that four copies of L7 or L12 are present on ribosomes. However, the peaks assigned to L7/L12 are a factor of ∼10 greater than those of both L11 and L10, and this relatively high intensity is therefore consistent with their more favorable release from ribosomes. Close examination of the peaks assigned to L7/L12 in the spectrum recorded for E. coliribosomes from pH 7.0 shows multiple peaks each separated by 22 Da (Fig. 1 C). This mass difference could be attributed either to sodium ion binding, in which a monovalent sodium ion replaces a single proton, or divalent magnesium ion binding in which two protons are replaced. To distinguish these two possibilities, EDTA was added in increasing amounts to chelate the divalent cation and spectra recorded. The resulting spectra showed a substantial reduction in the intensity of the multiplet with increasing concentrations of EDTA. Removal of the multiple peaks under these conditions identifies the ion binding as magnesium. We also examined solutions of E. coli ribosomes at unit pH values from 7 to 11 to investigate further the effect of charging proteins and rRNA on the propensity for release. Although little is known of the solution structure of ribosomes at these high pH values, the proteins that were observed (L7/L12, L10, and L11) are the same subset as those released under neutral pH conditions. These results suggest therefore that reducing the positive charge of the proteins at high pH does not alter their dissociation pattern from that observed at pH 7.0. By contrast at low pH (4.5), the spectra reveal a number of additional proteins not seen at neutral pH that correspond in mass to the proteins L1, L6, L9, and S8 (Fig. 1 B). Unlike L7/L12, L10, and L11 stalk proteins that dissociate at neutral pH, the proteins released from ribosomes at pH 4.5 are known from x-ray crystallography to have no mutual interactions, see structure in Fig. 1. Moreover the peaks assigned to L7/L12 are of comparable intensity to those of other ribosomal proteins implying that at pH 4.5 additional proteins dissociate from the ribosome as readily as L7/L12. The multiplets assigned to L7/L12 recorded from low pH solutions, Fig. 1 D, give rise to fewer peaks than were seen at neutral pH. Theirm/z values are consistent with their identity as L12 and its acetylated counterpart L7. The similarity in their intensity under these solution conditions confirms their equal population on the ribosome. Removal of the multiple peaks due to Mg2+ binding also allows an examination of the post-translational modifications of the proteins and reveals the extent of methylation of both proteins as <10%. Also apparent in the spectra recorded from pH 4.5 solution conditions are signals at m/z 3,600–4,400 (data not shown). It is difficult to assign a mass to this series due to the broad nature of the peaks (100 m/z units at half-height for the peak at m/z ∼3500). In order to obtain a precise mass measurement of these peaks, a single charge state was isolated in the quadrupole of the Q ToF mass spectrometer (see “Experimental Procedures”) and subjected to increased acceleration in the collision cell. Under these conditions the width of the peaks decreases (40 m/z units at half-height for the +11 charge state) enabling the mass to be measured as 39,038 ± 24 Da (Fig. 1 B and TableI). This value is in reasonable agreement to that calculated from the sequence of the 5 S RNA of 38,731 Da. The broad appearance of the peaks and increased molecular mass over that calculated from the sequence are consistent with multiple metal ions adducting to negatively charged RNA. Acceleration within the mass spectrometer and multiple collisions are sufficient to remove small molecule binding strongly suggesting the identity of the species as 5 S RNA.Table IMasses of proteins released under different conditionsProteinMeasured massCalculated masspIDaA L1212,162 ± 0.312,1644.0 L12-Me12,177 ± 4.212,178 L12-Mg2+12,186 ± 3.512,188 L712,206 ± 1.012,2064.8 L7-Me12,219 ± 1.912,220 L1017,578 ± 1.217,5807.5 L1114,869 ± 2.514,8709.7B L124,597 ± 4.824,5989.2 L618,771 ± 0.818,77310.6 L915,768 ± 0.115,7696.4 S161,167 ± 8.761,158<7.6 S813,992 ± 2.613,99512.2 5 S RNA39,038 ± 2438,731C L331-aDenotes proteins that are known to be released stoichiometrically (28) in solution by 2m LiCl treatment.6240 ± 1.06240>12.0 L321-aDenotes proteins that are known to be released stoichiometrically (28) in solution by 2m LiCl treatment.6318 ± 0.4631511.3 L297278 ± 0.6727410.0 L281-aDenotes proteins that are known to be released stoichiometrically (28) in solution by 2m LiCl treatment.8877 ± 1.28875 L271-aDenotes proteins that are known to be released stoichiometrically (28) in solution by 2m LiCl treatment.8994 ± 2.68994>12.0 L251-bDenotes proteins that are known to be partially released in solution by 2 m LiCl treatment.10,691 ± 5.410,6939.4 L2411,184 ± 2.711,15510.7 L2111,571 ± 2.911,5648.2 S101-aDenotes proteins that are known to be released stoichiometrically (28) in solution by 2m LiCl treatment.11,734 ± 7.711,735>12.0 L12-Li1-aDenotes proteins that are known to be released stoichiometrically (28) in solution by 2m LiCl treatment.12,172 ± 0.512,1704.0 L12-Mg12,186 ± 0.112,188 L7-Li1-aDenotes proteins that are known to be released stoichiometrically (28) in solution by 2m LiCl treatment.12,213 ± 1.012,2124.8 L7-Mg-Li12,230 ± 1.012,234 L7-Mg212,250 ± 1.012,250 L181-bDenotes proteins that are known to be partially released in solution b"
https://openalex.org/W2094346519,"Tie1 is an endothelial receptor tyrosine kinase essential for development and maintenance of the vascular system. Here we report generation of transgenic mice expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) or a chimeric protein consisting of a Zeosin resistance marker and EGFP under the control of mouse Tie1 promoter. Intravital monitoring of fluorescence showed that the EGFP reporter recapitulates the Tie1 expression pattern in the developing vasculature, and flow cytometry using EGFP allowed the isolation of essentially pure Tie1-expressing endothelial cells from transgenic mouse embryos. However, EGFP and LacZ transgenic markers were strongly down-regulated in the adult vasculature; unlike the Tie1-LacZ knock-in locus, the promoter was not reactivated during tumor neovascularization, indicating the presence of additional regulatory elements in the Tie1 locus. Starting at midgestation, Tie1 promoter activity became stronger in the arterial than in the venous endothelium; in adult mice, promoter activity was observed in arterioles, capillaries, and lymphatic vessels, indicating a significant degree of specificity in different types of endothelial cells. Our results establish Tie1-Z/EGFP transgenic mice as a useful model to study embryonic vascular development and a convenient source for the isolation of primary endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2009181911,"The extracellular calcium (Ca2+o)-sensing receptor (CaR) activates Ca2+ influx independent of the release of intracellular Ca2+ stores. The latter can be negatively regulated by protein kinase C (PKC) through phosphorylation of Thr-888 of the CaR. In this study, we substituted Thr-888 with various amino acid residues or a stop codon to understand how PKC phosphorylation of the CaR inhibits receptor-mediated release of intracellular Ca2+stores. Substitutions of Thr-888 with hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acid residues had various effects on CaR-mediated release of intracellular Ca2+ stores as well as activation of Ca2+ influx. Several point mutations, such as T888D, had marked negative effects on CaR-mediated release of intracellular Ca2+ stores but not on phorbol myristate acetate-insensitive activation of Ca2+ influx. Presumably, the negatively charged aspartate mimics phospho-threonine. Interestingly, truncating the receptor at 888 had an even more pronounced negative effect on CaR-elicited release of intracellular Ca2+ stores without significantly affecting CaR-mediated activation of Ca2+ influx. Therefore, truncation at position 888 of the CaR affects the activity of the receptor in a manner that resembles PKC phosphorylation of the CaR. This in turn suggests that PKC phosphorylation of the CaR prevents G protein subtypes from interacting with the region of the receptor critical for releasing Ca2+ stores, which is missing in the truncated receptor.

Ca2+o-sensing receptor protein kinase C phospholipase C phorbol myristate acetate inositol phosphate Extracellular calcium concentration (Ca2+o) is tightly regulated by the interactions of several hormones (e.g. parathyroid hormone, vitamin D, and calcitonin) and organ systems (i.e. parathyroid gland, kidney, bone, and intestine) (1Brown E.M. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 371-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Parathyroid cells respond to changes in Ca2+o with oppositely directed alterations in parathyroid hormone secretion through the Ca2+o-sensing receptor (CaR).1 Such responses can be down-regulated by activators of protein kinase C (PKC) (2Clarke B.L.

Hanley D.A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1992; 7: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), a process that has been implicated in the reduced responsiveness to Ca2+o of adenomatous or hyperplastic parathyroid glands (11Ishizuka T.

Akerstrom G. Gylfe E. Acta Endocrinol. 1992; 126: 505-509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although these glands also have reduced expression of the CaR (13Gogusev J. Duchambon P. Hory B.

Kifor I. Hebert S.C. Brown E.M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 81: 1598-1606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, PKC may contribute to age-related changes in the regulation of parathyroid hormone secretion by Ca2+o in rats (15Wongsurawat N. Armbrecht H.J. Exp. Gerontol. 1987; 22: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Therefore, stimulus-secretion coupling in parathyroid cells can be modulated by PKC. We recently showed that some of this modulation occurs at the receptor level (16Bai M. Trivedi S. Lane C.R. Yang Y. Quinn S.J. Brown E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21267-21275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The human homologue of the CaR has five putative PKC phosphorylation sites in its intracellular domains. An alteration in the coupling of the CaR to secondary signaling pathways has been implicated as one of mechanisms by which PKC exerts negative effects on the function of the receptor (16Bai M. Trivedi S. Lane C.R. Yang Y. Quinn S.J. Brown E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21267-21275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In particular, PKC phosphorylation of Thr-888 inhibits CaR-mediated increases in cytosolic calcium (Ca2+i) via mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ stores. In this study, we introduced various mutations at position 888 and examined whether any of these mutations mimic or block the action of PKC activators on CaR-mediated PLC signaling pathways. We found that truncating the CaR at 888 impairs the function of the receptor in a similar way as activating cellular PKC. Site-directed mutagenesis utilized the approach described by Kunkel (17Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar) to produce mutated receptors in which the threonine residue at position 888, one of the five predicted PKC phosphorylation sites in the cytoplasmic tail of the human CaR, was mutated to various amino acid residues or a stop codon. The dut-1 ung-1 strain of Escherichia coli, CJ236, was transformed separately with mutagenesis cassette 6, as described previously (18Bai M. Quinn S. Trivedi S. Kifor O. Pearce S.H.S. Pollak M.R. Krapcho K. Hebert S.C. Brown E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19537-19545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Uracil-containing, single-stranded DNA was produced by infecting the cells with the helper phage VCSM13 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The single-stranded DNA was then annealed to a mutagenesis primer that contained the desired nucleotide change encoding a single-point mutation flanked on both sides by wild-type sequences. The primer was subsequently extended around the entire single-stranded DNA and ligated to generate closed circular heteroduplex DNA. DH5α competent cells were transformed with these DNA heteroduplexes, and incorporation of the desired mutation was confirmed by sequencing the entire cassette. The resultant mutated cassette 6 containing the desired mutation was doubly digested withXhoI and XbaI and cloned into the full-length of the receptor in pcDNA3. CaR cDNA was prepared with the Midi plasmid kit (Qiagen). LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) was employed as a DNA carrier for transfection. The HEK293 cells used for transient transfection were provided by NPS Pharmaceuticals (Salt Lake City, UT) and were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). The DNA-liposome complex was prepared by mixing DNA and LipofectAMINE in OPTI-MEM I reduced serum medium (Invitrogen) and incubating the mixture at room temperature for 30 min. The DNA-LipofectAMINE mixture was then diluted with OPTI-MEM I reduced serum medium and added to 90% confluent HEK293 cells plated on 13.5 × 20.1 mm glass coverslips using 2.5 μg of DNA. After the cells were incubated for 5 h at 37 °C, an equivalent amount of OPTI-MEM I reduced serum medium with 20% fetal bovine serum was added to the medium overlying the transfected cells, and the latter was replaced with fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum at 24 h after transfection. The expressed Ca2+o-sensing receptor protein was assayed 48 h after the start of transfection. Before whole cell lysates were prepared, intact HEK293 cells transiently transfected with FLAG-tagged CaR were labeled with 1 mmImmunoPure N-hydroxysulfosuccinimidobiotin (Pierce), a membrane-impermeable biotinylation reagent, as described previously (19Bai M. Trivedi S. Brown E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23605-23610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). The surface-biotinylated HEK293 cells were solubilized, and the FLAG-tagged receptor was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma). The immunopurified species were subsequently eluted and subjected to SDS-containing PAGE using a linear gradient of polyacrylamide (3–10%). The forms of the receptor present on the cell surface were detected with an avidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Bio-Rad) followed by visualization of the biotinylated bands with an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). HEK293 cells, which were plated on coverslips and transfected with CaR cDNAs, were loaded for 2 h at room temperature with fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes) in 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, containing 125 mm NaCl, 4 mmKCl, 1.25 mm CaCl2, 1 mmMgSO4, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% dextrose and washed once at 37 °C for 20–30 min with a buffer solution (20 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, containing 125 mm NaCl, 4 mmKCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mmMgCl2, 0.1% dextrose, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin). The coverslips were then placed diagonally in a thermostatted quartz cuvette that contained the buffer solution using a modification of the technique employed previously (20Fajtova V.T. Quinn S.J. Brown E.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: E151-E158PubMed Google Scholar). The CaR was activated by multiple additions of an agonist in incremental doses to reach the desired concentrations. Excitation monochrometers were centered at 340 and 380 nm with emission light collected at 510 ± 40 nm through a wide band emission filter. The 340/380 excitation ratio of emitted light was used as readout for Ca2+i as described previously (20Fajtova V.T. Quinn S.J. Brown E.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: E151-E158PubMed Google Scholar). For PKC activation, the cells were preincubated with a PKC activator such as phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) for 1–2 min. For measuring transient Ca2+i responses elicited by spermine, the buffer solution was devoid of MgCl2, CaCl2, and bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm EGTA was added in the beginning of the experiment. The transiently transfected HEK293 cells were prelabeled overnight with [3H]myo-inositol (6.25 μCi/well) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in 199 media. The cells were washed once with Eagle's medium containing 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and incubated with varying concentrations of agonists for 30 min in the presence of 10 mm LiCl (21Kifor O. Kifor I. Brown E.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1992; 7: 1327-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The reactions were terminated with 10% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (final w/v). After centrifugation to remove insoluble debris, trichloroacetic acid was extracted with water-saturated diethylether, and total inositol phosphates were separated on Dowex anion exchange columns and quantitated with a liquid scintillation counter, as described previously (21Kifor O. Kifor I. Brown E.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1992; 7: 1327-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The mean EC50 for the wild-type or each mutant receptor in response to increasing concentrations of Ca2+o or spermine was calculated from the EC50 values for all of the individual experiments and expressed with the standard error of the mean (S.E.) as the index of dispersion. Comparisons of the EC50 values and inositol phosphate (IP) responses were performed by analysis of variance or Duncan's multiple comparison test (22Duncan D.B. Biometrics. 1955; 11: 1-42Crossref Google Scholar). A pvalue of ≤ 0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. The impact of various substitutions of Thr-888 on the function of the CaR was examined by stimulating the mutant receptors in transiently transfected HEK293 cells by Ca2+o for a full CaR response or by spermine in the absence of Ca2+o to avoid Ca2+ influx. The activities of mutant receptors were evaluated initially by measuring Ca2+i responses. As summarized in TableI, the substitutions of hydrophobic amino acid residues for Thr-888, including the previously reported T888V, reduced EC50[Ca2+]o significantly, whereas the substitutions of negatively charged amino acid residues or glycine increased EC50[Ca2+]o. The other substitutions, such as Asn, Gln, and Lys, did not change EC50[Ca2+]o significantly. The patterns of the Ca2+i responses of all the mutant receptors were somewhat different from those of the wild-type receptor (Fig. 1). Among them, T888K and T888D showed little transient responses but did show prominent sustained responses that were indicative of activation of Ca2+influx. In addition to substituting Thr-888 with various amino acid residues, we also truncated the receptor by introducing a stop codon at position 888. We found that T888Stop further blunted transient Ca2+i responses with an increased EC50[Ca2+]o and a 50% reduction in its maximal cumulative Ca2+i response. In addition, the pattern of the Ca2+i response of T888Stop showed a close resemblance to that of the wild-type receptor in PMA-treated cells (Fig. 1) (16Bai M. Trivedi S. Lane C.R. Yang Y. Quinn S.J. Brown E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21267-21275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) in which CaR-evoked transient Ca2+i increases due to the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ stores were substantially blunted.Table IEC50 values and maximal Ca2+i responses of the wild-type (WT) and mutant receptors when stimulated with either Ca2+o or spermine in the presence or absence of PMAMutantsCa2+oSpermineEC50[Ca2+]1-aEC50s are means ± S.E.

Open table in a new tab Both the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and activation of Ca2+ influx contribute to CaR-mediated increases in Ca2+i when Ca2+ois used as a CaR agonist. Therefore, we also used an alternative CaR agonist, spermine, to determine the impact of PKC activation on CaR-evoked mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ stores. In the following experiment, we stimulated the receptor with spermine in the absence of Ca2+o and Mg2+o. A trace amount of divalent cations was removed by including 1 mm EGTA in the experimental buffer prior to the addition of spermine. All mutant receptors had significant spermine-elicited Ca2+i responses, but they were still less than those of the wild-type receptor (Table I). Among them, T888Stop had the lowest maximal response, about 25% of that of the wild-type receptor, followed by T888K and T888D, which had maximal responses about 55% of that of the wild-type receptor. Others had maximal responses ranging from 62% to 99% (Table I). These results suggest that mutations at position 888 affect CaR-mediated activation of certain G protein subtypes that induce the release of intracellular Ca2+stores. Next, we tested the effect of PMA on various mutants when stimulated by spermine in the absence of Ca2+o and Mg2+o. Consistent with our previous study, the effects of PMA on the CaR were significantly reduced by all the mutations. As shown in Table I, all mutant receptors except T888Stop showed greater maximal responses in the presence of PMA than did the wild-type receptor. Among them, T888W, T888Y, T888Q, and T888G were most resistant to PMA with maximal responses over 2-fold higher than those of the wild-type receptor in cells similarly pretreated with 100 nm PMA. Although T888Stop-mediated responses were insensitive to PMA, the responses in the control conditions were similar to those of the wild-type receptor in cells pretreated with PMA. As shown in Fig. 2, pretreatment of T888Stop-transfected cells with PMA hardly affected the Ca2+i responses elicited by either spermine or Ca2+o. Moreover, the resultant response curves of the truncated receptor under all conditions were essentially superimposed on those of the wild-type receptor pretreated with 100 nm PMA, which markedly attenuated CaR-mediated release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, as shown in our previous study (16Bai M. Trivedi S. Lane C.R. Yang Y. Quinn S.J. Brown E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21267-21275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). These results suggest that PKC phosphorylation of Thr-888 blocks the respective G proteins from interacting with the region of the receptor C-terminal to Ala-887 and from activating Ca2+stores. To determine whether PKC activation exerts its negative effects on signaling components upstream of mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ stores, we determined IP responses of some receptors. IP responses were determined in the transfected cells prelabeled overnight with [3H]inositol. For the effects of PKC activation, we pretreated the cells with 100 nm PMA for 10 min and subsequently stimulated the cells with either Ca2+o or spermine. Pretreatment of the cells with PMA reduced Ca2+o-elicited IP responses of the wild-type receptor by 14.5% and shifted the response curve to the right by 2–4 mm Ca2+o (Fig. 3 A and Table II). Pretreatment of the cells with PMA had a much milder negative effect on IP responses than on Ca2+i responses when the wild-type receptor was stimulated by Ca2+o. In contrast, PKC activation markedly reduced IP responses when the wild-type receptor was stimulated by spermine alone (Fig. 3 Band Table II). For instance, at 1 mm spermine (when the IP response approached the maximal value), pretreatment of cells with PMA reduced the response by 99%. This suggests that the major component of the Ca2+o-elicited IP response of the wild-type receptor, about 85% at concentrations of Ca2+o as high as 8–16 mm, is dependent on activation of Ca2+ influx.Table IIEffects of PMA and CaR mutations on CaR-mediated acummulation of total IP in response to Ca2+o or spermineWt2-aWt, wild type.T888StopT888VControlPMAControlPMAControlPMACa2+o(mm)2-bValues are means ± S.E. and normalized to the maximal IP response of the wild-type receptor elicied by spermine alone in the absence of PMA.

Open table in a new tab Consistent with the hypothesis that PKC-phosphorylated CaR blocks the interaction of certain G proteins with structural elements located C-terminally to Ala-887, no significant IP responses were elicited by spermine even in the absence of PMA (Fig. 4 A and Table II). In contrast, Ca2+o-induced IP responses of T888Stop were substantial but insensitive to PMA (Fig. 4 B and Table II), presumably through activation of PMA-insensitive Ca2+influx. Like T888Stop-mediated Ca2+i responses, the PMA-insensitive IP responses of T888Stop have no significant difference from those of PMA-pretreated wild-type receptor (Fig. 3 and TableII). To further test the hypothesis that CaR-induced elevation of Ca2+i through activation of Ca2+ influx markedly activates PLC, we stimulated the cells with spermine in the presence of 0.5 mm Ca2+o, a concentration below the threshold for activation of the CaR. The presence of 0.5 mm Ca2+o increased the spermine-elicited maximal IP response of the wild-type receptor ∼2.5-fold (Fig. 5 A) to a level similar to that stimulated by high Ca2+o(Fig. 3 A). Likewise, the presence of 0.5 mmCa2+o increased spermine-elicited maximal IP response of T888Stop (Fig. 5 B) to a level similar to that stimulated by high Ca2+o (Fig. 4 B). Moreover, the Ca2+o-depedent IP productions were similar in cells transfected with T888Stop (Fig. 5 B) to those in cells transfected with the wild-type receptor (Fig. 5 A). These results further support that CaR-mediated Ca2+ influx activates PLC and that the magnitude of CaR-elicited Ca2+ influx in cells transfected with T888Stop is similar to that in cells transfected with the wild-type receptor. Importantly, these results also rule out the possibilities that spermine is significantly transported into the cells and subsequently inhibits intracellular PLC activities in HEK293 cells when applied extracellularly. In contrast to T888Stop, T888V had maximal IP responses significantly higher than the wild-type receptor when stimulated with spermine or Ca2+o (Fig. 6 and Table II). This result suggests that T888V primarily enhances the activity of the receptor for activation of pathways leading to mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ stores. Consistent with our studies on Ca2+i responses, spermine- or Ca2+o-elicited IP responses of T888V were also affected negatively by PMA. However, the IP response of T888V at any given concentration in the PMA-treated cells was not lower than that of the wild-type receptor in non-treated cells. This suggests that PMA exerts additional negative effect on signaling elements downstream of PLC activation that are involved in the release of intracellular Ca2+ stores. Western analysis showed that all the mutant receptors had normal expression on the cell surface (Fig. 7). In fact, the truncated receptor had slightly higher expression than did the wild-type receptor. Ca2+o is the main physiological regulator of calcium homeostasis through its action on its own cell surface receptor, i.e. the CaR. Increases in the concentration of Ca2+o elicit rapid transient Ca2+i responses followed by sustained increases in Ca2+i in parathyroid cells and CaR-transfected HEK293 cells. Previous studies have shown that both activation and inhibition of PKC have profound effects on Ca2+o-elicited Ca2+i responses in parathyroid cells (6Racke F.K. Nemeth E.F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1993; 468: 163-176Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 7Racke F.K. Nemeth E.F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1993; 468: 141-162Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and CaR-transfected HEK293 cells and that these effects can be significantly blocked by substituting Thr-888 with valine in the CaR (16Bai M. Trivedi S. Lane C.R. Yang Y. Quinn S.J. Brown E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21267-21275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In this study, we introduced a variety of amino acid substitutions for threonine at position 888 to test whether we can create a mutant receptor that resembles the PKC-phosphorylated receptor. We found that substitutions with hydrophobic amino acid residues such as alanine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan increased apparent receptor affinities to its agonists similar to those associated with valine substitution reported in our previous study (16Bai M. Trivedi S. Lane C.R. Yang Y. Quinn S.J. Brown E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21267-21275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). These increased apparent receptor affinities for its agonists, such as calcium and spermine, suggest that the CaR might be somewhat inhibited by basal PKC activity. In contrast, T888D, T888E, and T888G are apparently less sensitive than the wild-type CaR to the receptor agonists with increased EC50values. The reason for T888E and T888D to simulate the wild-type receptor following PMA treatment is likely that the negatively charged amino acid residues may somewhat resemble the PKC-phosphorylated receptor with charges acquired at the phosphorylation site. In the case of T888G, substitution with glycine could significantly alter the secondary structure of the region that is important for the interaction of the receptor with its respective G proteins by introducing a turn in the helix, as predicted by Chou-Fasman indices. Regardless, all the mutant receptors with various point mutations elicited modest-to-high Ca2+i responses via mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ stores and showed significant but reduced sensitivities to PMA that may reflect the presence of additional PKC sites and/or more downstream modulation by PMA. In contrast, the action of PKC phosphorylation can be fully mimicked by the removal of the C-terminal region following alanine at position 887, suggesting that PKC phosphorylation at Thr-888 blocks the interaction of this C-terminal region of the receptor with its cognate G proteins that leads to mobilization of intracellular Ca2+stores. However, the removal of this C-terminal region of the receptor does not impede the receptor's PMA-insensitive activation of Ca2+ influx and the subsequent Ca2+i-dependent activation of PLC, suggesting that the structural determinants activating PMA-insensitive Ca2+ influx are intact in the truncated receptor, T888Stop. Since our previous study showed that truncation upstream of Thr-888 at position 877 completely inactivates not only CaR-mediated mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ stores but also CaR-mediated Ca2+ influx (24Bai M. Janicic N. Trivedi S. Quinn S.J. Cole D.E.C. Brown E.M. Hendy G.N. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1917-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) the elements important for activation of Ca2+ influx are likely situated between the residues between 877 and 887. For the wild-type CaR, activation of PMA-insensitive Ca2+influx pathways becomes significant when the receptor is activated by a concentration of Ca2+o that is 3.5 mmor higher. The activation of this pathway increases not only the concentration of Ca2+i but also the production of inositol phosphates. In fact, more than 85% of the IP response may be attributed to activation of Ca2+ influx when the receptor is stimulated by a concentration of Ca2+o that is 8 mm or higher. It becomes clear that at least 60% of the IP response is attributable to activation of Ca2+ influx when the receptor is activated by 1 or 2 mm spermine in the presence of 0.5 mm Ca2+o. Since all subtypes of PLC can be activated by Ca2+, it is likely that increases in Ca2+i due to activation of Ca2+ influx non-selectively activate all subtypes of PLC, including PLC-βs that could be otherwise activated by Gqor G11. Activating PLC via activation of PMA-insensitive Ca2+ influx pathways could play an important role in bone remodeling at the site of bone erosion, where the concentration of Ca2+o can be as high as 40 mm (23Silver I.A. Murrills R.J. Etherington D.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 175: 266-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the IP responses of T888V were not only significantly higher than those of the wild-type receptor but also much less sensitive to PMA than its own Ca2+i responses. Moreover, the maximal IP response of T888V in PMA-treated cells was significantly higher than that of the wild-type receptor in non-treated cells. Hence, over 50% reduction in spermine-elicited Ca2+i responses of T888V may result from activation of PMA-sensitive Ca2+ stores, which can be inhibited by PMA. In contrast, T888Stop neither activates any PMA-sensitive Ca2+ stores nor fully activates PMA-insensitive stores. Therefore, PKC phosphorylation of the CaR inhibits both CaR-mediated activation of both PMA-sensitive and -insensitive Ca2+stores. In summary, we have demonstrated that PKC regulation of CaR-mediated PLC signaling pathways can be mimicked by truncating the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor at position 888. Therefore, PKC phosphorylation of the CaR impairs functional interaction of G proteins with the region of the cytoplasmic tail downstream of Ala-887. We are grateful to Dr. Edward M. Brown for critical review of the manuscript."

Chronic overexpression of GH in transgenic mice results in systemically and locally increased IGF-I levels and in disproportionate overgrowth, including adrenocortical enlargement and corticosterone hypersecretion. Using PEPCK-bovine GH transgenic (G) mice, we demonstrate that adrenal enlargement involves both hypertrophy (44%) and hyperplasia (50%) of zona fasciculata cells. To clarify whether IGFBP-2 affected cell volume and number, we crossed hemizygous G mice with hemizygous CMV-IGFBP-2 transgenic (B) mice, generating G mice, B mice, GB double transgenic mice, and nontransgenic controls (C). The absolute weight of the adrenal glands was significantly increased in 5-wk- and 4-month-old G mice vs. C and B mice. IGFBP-2 overexpression in GB mice reduced this effect of GH excess by 26% and 37% in 5-wk- and 4-month-old animals, respectively. GH-induced hypertrophy of zona fasciculata cells was completely abolished by IGFBP-2 overexpression in GB mice whereas hyperplasia was not affected. Basal and ACTH-induced plasma corticosterone levels of 4-month-old G mice, but not of GB mice, were two- to threefold increased compared with C mice. Plasma ACTH levels were similar in all groups. Our data show that IGFBP-2 potently separates hypertrophic and hyperplastic effects of GH/IGF-I excess on adrenocortical cells."

The β subunits of the voltage-gated calcium channels are known to be capable of forming heterogenous complexes both in vivo (17Pichler M. Cassidy T.N. Reimer D. Haase H. Kraus R. Ostler D.

The β subunits and the α1 subunit possess highly conserved interaction regions (19Pragnell M., De Waard M. Mori Y. Tanabe T. Snutch T.P. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1994; 368: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar) allowing the formation of heterogeneous channel complexes. The α2δ subunits modulate different α1subunits in vitro (20Klugbauer N. Lacinova L. Marais E. Hobom M. Hofmann F. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 684-691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and presumably this heterogeneity extends to the in vivo situation. Such diversity of interaction would potentially multiply the number of possible combinations of channels with different biophysical and physiological properties, which could then translate into fine modulation of a variety of cellular responses. γ subunits are relatively less well understood. Subunit interactions of γ subunits with the voltage-gated calcium channels are unknown, and their ability to form heterogeneous complexes is unclear. To address these questions, we took advantage of γ1 null mice. Mice that lack γ1 have been generated by use of conventional gene targeting strategy (21Ahern, C. A., Powers, P. A., Biddlecome, G. H., Roethe, L., Vallejo, P., Mortenson, L., Strube, C., Campbell, K. P., Coronado, R., and Gregg, R. G. (2001) BMC Physiol.http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472–6793/1/8Google Scholar, 22Freise D.

A., Biddlecome, G. H., Roethe, L., Vallejo, P., Mortenson, L., Strube, C., Campbell, K. P., Coronado, R., and Gregg, R. G. (2001) BMC Physiol.http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472–6793/1/8Google Scholar) that the subunits of the skeletal muscle calcium channel are expressed at wild type levels in the γ1 null mice. The lack of the γ1 subunit also does not appear to diminish the ability of the other subunits to assemble together and conduct voltage-gated calcium currents. However, the absence of the γ1 subunit slows the inactivation kinetics and increases the amplitude (21Ahern, C. A., Powers, P. A., Biddlecome, G. H., Roethe, L., Vallejo, P., Mortenson, L., Strube, C., Campbell, K. P., Coronado, R., and Gregg, R. G. (2001) BMC Physiol.http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472–6793/1/8Google Scholar, 22Freise D.

This led us to examine if the L-type calcium channel is maintained as a complex in the γ1 null mice. We hypothesized that if the channel were still maintained as a complex in the γ1 null mice, it would serve as a valuable tool offering the potential to explore subunit-subunit interactions in an in vivo environment. Our data show that the skeletal L-type channel is indeed maintained as a complex in the γ1 null mice. To examine the ability of the γ subunits to form heterogeneous complexes, the γ1and γ2 subunits were introduced into the skeletal muscle of the γ1 null mice via adenovirus-mediated expression, and their ability to incorporate into the channel was examined. We demonstrate that the γ1 does incorporate, but the γ2 does not. Consistent with these results, γ1EGFP localizes to the t-tubules, whereas the γ2EGFP does not demonstrate organized t-tubule localization. Furthermore, by using a γ1/γ2chimeric strategy, we demonstrate that the first half of the γ1 subunit mediates its interaction with the calcium channel. Examination of the electrophysiological characteristics of the chimeric subunits in γ1 null myotubes showed that the first half of the protein is sufficient to restore calcium conductance of L-type currents in γ1 null myotubes. To examine the subunit of the channel with which the γ1subunit associates, we examined the channel in the muscular dysgenesis (mdg) mice. In the absence of α11.1 in themdg mice, γ1 does not associate with α2δ, indicating that α11.1 is necessary for γ1 to associate with the calcium channel. These predictions are confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation of α11.1 and γ1EGFP subunits from transiently transfected cells. KCl microsomes were prepared from wild type and γ1 null mice as described previously (23Duclos F. Straub V. Moore S.A. Venzke D.P. Hrstka R.F. Crosbie R.H. Durbeej M. Lebakken C.S. Ettinger A.J. van der Meulen J. Holt K.H. Lim L.E. Sanes J.R. Davidson B.L. Faulkner J.A. Williamson R. Campbell K.P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1461-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The microsomes were solubilized twice in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, 1% digitonin, 0.5 m NaCl, and seven protease inhibitors (benzamidine, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, leupeptin, calpain inhibitor, calpeptin, and pepstatin). The solubilized material was subjected to wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) chromatography. The material bound to the WGA column was eluted usingN-acetylglucosamine and concentrated. In some cases, the material was used as the enriched voltage-gated calcium channel. For purification, the WGA-eluted material was diluted and applied to a diethylaminoethylcellulose column, and the bound material eluted with buffer containing 50 mm Tris, 0.1% digitonin, and 100 mm NaCl. All the adenoviruses and cell expression constructs used in this study expressed the protein under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. The cDNAs of interest were subcloned into the pAd5CMVK-NpA vector and used for generation of the adenovirus by standard homologous recombination techniques. The recombinant viruses were then purified using standard techniques. The Gene Transfer Vector Core at the University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, generated all adenoviruses in this study. In some cases, the cDNAs in the adenovirus vectors were used for cell expression studies. The rabbit γ1 subunit (GenBankTM accession number M32231) was subcloned into theBamHI/BamHI site of the adenovirus shuttle vector. The resulting construct was checked for appropriate orientation by restriction analysis. The mouse γ2 subunit (GenBankTM accession number NM_007583) was excised from the pCDNA3 vector using HindIII and BamHI and subcloned into the HindIII/BamHI sites of the adenovirus vector. The γ1EGFP and γ2EGFP constructs were generated by inserting the cDNA into the pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech) in-frame with the enhanced fluorescent green protein (EGFP) using standard PCR techniques. The resulting construct encoded the γ subunit with the EGFP tag at the C terminus of the protein. The resulting constructs were excised and subcloned into the adenovirus vector. To generate this construct, a fragment of the rabbit γ1 cDNA was amplified using a forward primer that includes aHindIII site and the start codon (γ1 forward, 5′ CCC AAG CTT CCA CCA TGT CCC CGA CGG AAG CC 3′) and the reverse primer in the region after the second transmembrane domain (5′ GTT GTG GCG TGT CTT CCG CTT CTT CCT GAA GGC 3′). This reverse primer also includes a stretch of residues homologous to the γ2subunit. Another PCR fragment was generated using the γ2cDNA as a template, with the forward primer (5′ GCC TTC AGG AAG AAG CGG AAG ACA ACG CCA CAA C 3′) and a reverse primer that includes a stop codon and a BamHI site (γ2 reverse, 5′ CGG GAT CCC GTC ATA CGG GCG TGG TCC GGC G 3′). The products from the two PCRs were mixed and reamplified using the γ1 forward and γ2 reverse primers. The resulting product was subcloned into the adenovirus shuttle vector into the HindIII andBamHI sites. The final construct was sequenced to verify integrity. This construct encodes a protein that includes the N terminus to aa 133 of γ1 and aa 129 through the C terminus of the γ2 subunit. This protein is detected by an antibody to the γ2 subunit. A fragment of the γ2 cDNA was amplified using the forward primer that includes a HindIII site and the start codon (γ2 forward, 5′ CCC AAG CTT CCA CCA TGG GGC TGT TTG ATC GAG 3′) and the reverse primer (5′ CGG CCG CAG CAG GTA ATC GTA GAA CTC GCT CGC CGC 3′). A fragment of the γ1cDNA was amplified using the forward primer (5′ GCG AGC GAG TTC TAC GAT TAC CTG CTG CGG CCG 3′) and a reverse primer that includes a stop codon and a BamHI site (γ1 reverse, 5′ CGT GGA TCC CGT TAA TGC TCG GGT TCG GC 3′). The products from the two PCRs were mixed and reamplified with the γ2 forward and γ1 reverse primers. The resulting product was subcloned into the adenovirus shuttle vector into the HindIII andBamHI sites. The final construct was sequenced to verify the integrity. This construct encodes a protein that includes the N terminus to aa 128 followed by aa 134 through the C terminus of the γ1 subunit. This protein is detected by an antibody to the γ1 subunit. This construct was generated by standard PCR techniques to replace the first extracellular loop of the γ1EGFP with the first extracellular loop of the unrelated four-transmembrane protein sarcospan (24Crosbie R.H. Heighway J. Venzke D.P. Lee J.C. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31221-31224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The first extracellular loop of sarcospan includes the six amino acids RTDPFW. The protein can be detected by an antibody to GFP. This construct has been described previously (25Ahern C.A. Bhattacharya D. Mortenson L. Coronado R. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 3294-3307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). 10 μl of primary particles or diluted secondary particles (∼1011 particles/ml) of the adenovirus were injected into the tibialis anterior and the quadriceps muscles of 2–5-day-old γ1 null pups as described previously (26Allamand V. Donahue K.M. Straub V. Davisson R.L. Davidson B.L. Campbell K.P. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1385-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). 3 to 5 weeks later, the mice were sacrificed and the injected muscles collected. The tissue was processed for immunohistochemistry or biochemical analysis as described below. Wheat germ agglutinin-enriched material or KCl microsomes that were solubilized as described in the methods for the purification of the channel complex were concentrated and loaded on 5–30% linear sucrose gradients with 0.1% digitonin and 0.5 m NaCl. The gradients were centrifuged for 90 min at 50,000 rpm in a 65.2 Ti rotor (Beckman Instruments). 800-μl fractions were collected from the top from each tube. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE on gradient gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for immunoblotting. The membranes were blocked and incubated with the primary antibody, followed by secondary antibody and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. The antibodies used in this study have been described previously, IID5E1, IIF7 (α11.1 (26Allamand V. Donahue K.M. Straub V. Davisson R.L. Davidson B.L. Campbell K.P.

Chem. 1989; 264: 2816-2825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Tissue samples (quadriceps) were frozen and processed for immunohistochemistry as described previously (26Allamand V. Donahue K.M. Straub V. Davisson R.L. Davidson B.L. Campbell K.P. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1385-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The sections were labeled with a rabbit polyclonal antibody to β-dystroglycan (AP83). To visualize the α11.1 subunit, the sections were labeled with the monoclonal antibody to the α11.1 subunit (IIID5E1). To minimize the background, the sections were first treated with the Fab fragment using the conditions described by the manufacturer (The Jackson Laboratories). Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies were used to detect the primary antibodies. EGFP fluorescence was used to detect the γ subunits. Immunolabeled sections were visualized with the ×60 objective using confocal microscopy (Bio-Rad). The barrepresents 10 μm. Primary cultures were prepared from enzyme-digested hind limbs of late-gestation (E18) γ1 null embryos. Myoblasts were isolated by enzymatic digestion with 0.125% (w/v) trypsin and 0.05% (w/v) pancreatin. After centrifugation, mononucleated cells were resuspended in plating medium containing 78% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with low glucose, 10% horse serum, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 2% chick embryo extract. Cells were then plated at a density of ∼1 × 104 cells per dish on gelatin-coated plastic culture dishes (BD Biosciences). Cultures were grown at 37 °C in 8% CO2, and after the fusion of myoblasts (5–7 days), the medium was replaced with fetal bovine serum-free medium, and CO2 was decreased to 5%. In the case of cDNA expression, γ subunit cDNAs of interest and a separate plasmid encoding the T-cell membrane antigen CD8 were mixed at a 1:1 weight ratio and cotransfected with the polyamine LT-1 (Panvera, WI). CD8-transfected cells were identified by incubation with anti-CD8 antibody beads (Dynal, Norway). Cells were voltage-clamped ∼48 h after transfection. Transfected cells revealed by CD8 beads were voltage-clamped with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, CA) and a Digidata 1200 (Axon) pulse generator and digitizer. Linear capacitance, leak currents, and effective series resistance were compensated with the amplifier circuit. The voltage dependence of the Ca2+ conductance was fitted according to a Boltzmann distribution, A =A max/(1 + exp(−(V −V 12)/k)). WhereA max is G max;V 12 is the potential at which A =A max/2; and k is the slope factor. The external solution in all cases was (in mm) 130 triethanolamine methanesulfonate, 10 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 0.001 tetrodotoxin (Sigma), and 10 HEPES titrated with triethanolamine(OH) to pH 7.4. The pipette solution was (in mm) 140 Cs+-aspartate, 5 MgCl2, 5 EGTA, 10 MOPS-CsOH, pH 7.2. Skeletal muscle frommdg pups or 1- to 2-day-old wild type mice were obtained, and KCl-washed microsomes were prepared as described above. The skeletal muscle calcium channel was enriched using a wheat germ agglutinin column after solubilization as described above. The enriched material was subjected to sucrose gradient fractionation as described, and the fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. tsA201 cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate method. Cells were lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, 1% digitonin, 0.5 m NaCl, and protease inhibitors, and the solubilized material was isolated by centrifugation. The solubilized material was immunoprecipitated with beads to which the antibody to the α11.1 subunit (IIF7) was coupled. The beads were then thoroughly washed in a buffer containing 0.1% digitonin, 0.5 m NaCl, 50 mmTris, and two protease inhibitors (benzamidine and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The bound material was eluted using SDS loading buffer and immunoblotted. Aliquots of the cell lysate were also immunoblotted to examine the expression of the proteins. TsA201 cells were transfected as described above. Tunicamycin (10 μg/ml) was then added to the medium, the cells were incubated for 2 days and immunoprecipitated as described above. The generation of γ1null mice using conventional gene targeting strategy has been described previously (21Ahern, C. A., Powers, P. A., Biddlecome, G. H., Roethe, L., Vallejo, P., Mortenson, L., Strube, C., Campbell, K. P., Coronado, R., and Gregg, R. G. (2001) BMC Physiol.http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472–6793/1/8Google Scholar). The subunits of the calcium channel are expressed at normal levels in these mice. This, in conjunction with the expression of robust voltage-gated calcium currents in the skeletal muscle (21Ahern, C. A., Powers, P. A., Biddlecome, G. H., Roethe, L., Vallejo, P., Mortenson, L., Strube, C., Campbell, K. P., Coronado, R., and Gregg, R. G.

Flockerzi V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14476-14481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), led us to examine if the calcium channel subunits are maintained as a complex. The calcium channel was purified from the wild type and γ1 null mice as described under “Materials and Methods.” The presence of all the subunits in the complex was verified by Western blotting with antibodies specific to each subunit of the channel (Fig. 1). The γ1 subunit can be detected in the complex from the wild type mice but not in the γ1 null mice. The α11.1, α2δ, and β1asubunits can be detected in the purified material from both the wild type and the γ1 null mice, demonstrating that the residual calcium channel is maintained as a complex in the γ1 null mice. The γ1subunit was reintroduced into the skeletal muscle of the γ1 null mice, via recombinant adenoviruses, to determine whether it could be incorporated into the calcium channel of the γ1 null mice. Expression of the protein was examined by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 2 A). The muscle from the wild type mice showed expression of the γ1 protein, whereas the γ1 null mice did not express any γ1 protein. Robust expression of γ1 recombinant protein was detected in the muscle of the mice injected with the recombinant adenovirus, confirming that the adenovirus-mediated expression may be successfully used for the expression of this subunit in the skeletal muscle. To examine if the virally expressed γ1 is incorporated into the residual calcium channel complex of γ1 null mice, a WGA-enriched preparation containing highly enriched material was examined for the presence of the γ1. γ1is enriched by the WGA column, as is the rest of the channel as indicted by the presence of the α2δ subunit in the elution. This suggests that γ1 may be incorporated into the channel complex (Fig. 2 B). To confirm this further, the enriched material was subjected to sucrose gradient fractionation and immunoblot analysis (Fig. 2 C). Our results clearly demonstrate that γ1 cofractionates with the other subunits of the calcium channel, indicating that indeed it is stably incorporated into the calcium channel complex of γ1 null mice. A fraction of γ1 is not associated with the channel. It is possible that this pool represents free γ1that is not complexed with the channel due to overexpression of the protein, because it is not observed in similar preparations from older wild type skeletal muscle (data not shown). To examine the localization of γ1, a construct that encodes γ1 with an EGFP at the C terminus was engineered. Expression of this protein in mammalian cells revealed that γ1EGFP traffics to the plasma membrane, even in the absence of the other subunits of the calcium channel (data not shown). By using adenovirus-mediated expression, the EGFP tagged constructs were introduced in the muscle of the γ1 null mice. Interestingly, the protein is also localized to the sarcolemma (Fig. 2 D), as indicated by its colocalization with β-dystroglycan, a marker for the sarcolemma (30Roberds S.L. Anderson R.D. Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya O. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23739-23742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 D). In addition, γ1EGFP is localized to the t-tubules (Fig. 2, D and E), as confirmed by its colocalization with α11.1 (Fig. 2 E). The ability of γ2 to incorporate into the calcium channel of γ1 null mice was then examined using a similar approach. The adenovirus encoding γ2 allows robust expression of the protein in the skeletal muscle of γ1 null mice. There is no detectable endogenous protein in the skeletal muscle of either wild type or γ1 null mice (Fig. 3 A) as reported previously (13Letts V.A. Felix R. Biddlecome G.H. Arikkath J. Mahaffey C.L. Valenzuela A. Bartlett F.S., II Mori Y. Campbell K.P. Frankel W.N. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 340-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). WGA enrichment of the channel complex indicates that, unlike γ1, γ2 is in the void, indicating that that γ2 may not be incorporated into the complex (Fig. 3 B). To ascertain if the γ2 subunit is weakly associated with the complex and the steps leading to the WGA chromatography disrupt this association, sucrose gradient fractionation of solubilized microsomes from γ2 injected mice was examined for the presence of γ2 and the other subunits of the channel (Fig. 3 C). These results demonstrate that γ2 does not comigrate in the same fractions as the rest of the channel complex confirming that it is not incorporated into the channel complex in γ1 null mice. Similar to γ1EGFP, γ2EGFP traffics to the plasma membrane in transiently transfected mammalian cells (data not shown). Consistent with the biochemical data indicating the absence of an association of γ2 with the calcium channel, the adenovirally expressed γ2EGFP in the skeletal muscle of the γ1 null mice does not demonstrate an organized t-tubule expression pattern (Fig. 3 D). Interestingly, similar to that observed with the γ1 subunit, the protein is also localized to the sarcolemma (Fig. 3 D) and colocalizes with β-dystroglyca"

These genes encode transcription factors that bind DNA through a highly conserved 60-amino acid domain known as the homeodomain, which consists of three α-helices and an N-terminal arm. The third helix lies in the major groove of the DNA and, along with the N-terminal arm, is responsible for DNA recognition. Well conserved amino acid residues contact DNA and form a hydrophobic core (1Gehring W.J. Affolter M. Bürglin T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 487-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). The Hox gene cluster in Drosophila consists of eight genes, the expression of which is directly related to their location in the cluster. In mammals, four Hox clusters, A to D, encompass a total of 39 genes. The mammalian HOX proteins are classified into 13 paralog groups on the basis of their position in the gene cluster and homology to the Drosophila Hox genes (2Krumlauf R.

The 15 amino acids immediately C-terminal to the PBX homeodomain are highly conserved among PBX (PBX1, -2, and -3) and related proteins (Drosophila Exd, Caenorhabditis elegans ceh-20) and increase the affinity of PBX for DNA and HOX proteins (11Lu Q.

The minimal elements required for formation of PBX-HOX complexes are the PBX and HOX homeodomains and the HOX YPWM motif (15Chang C.P. Shen W.F. Rozenfeld S. Lawrence H.J. Largman C. Cleary M.L.

Peptides that encompass the HOX YPWM motif and flanking amino acids disrupt the formation of PBX-HOX heterodimers (11Lu Q. Kamps M.P. Mol. Cell.

PBX-HOX heterodimers recognize the DNA sequence 5′-ATGATTNATNN-3′ (5Chang C.P. Brocchieri L. Shen W.F. Largman C. Cleary M.L. Mol. Cell.

We have solved the solution structure of the extended PBX homeodomain-DNA binary complex and studied the binding of a HOX-derived YPWM peptide to the complex. The structure provides insights into the role of the C-terminal extension and the PBX-YPWM motif interaction in increasing the affinity and specificity of HOX and PBX for DNA. Recombinant PBX protein, chemically synthesized HOX-derived peptides, and DNA oligonucleotides (Fig. 1) were purified as described previously (9Sprules T. Green N. Featherstone M. Gehring K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9943-9950Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding the HOXA1 and HOXD4 peptides were constructed by polymerase chain reaction amplification using primers that incorporated stop codons andBamHI and MfeI sites to clone HOXA1 amino acids 203–221 and HOXD4 amino acids 129–147 into pGEX-6P-1 (AmershamBiosciences). The glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells grown on M9 minimal media supplemented with15N NH4Cl and U13C6d-glucose as the sole nitrogen and carbon sources. The proteins were purified according to the manufacturer's protocol (24Amersham Biosciences Glutathione Sepharose 4B. Amersham Biosciences, 1998Google Scholar), and the peptide was cleaved from glutathione S-transferase with 50 units of Precission Protease (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 20 h. The resulting peptides were purified by reverse-phase chromatography on a C-18 column (Vydac), lyophilized, and resuspended in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, for NMR studies. NMR experiments were recorded on Bruker DRX 500, Varian INOVA 750, and Varian INOVA 800 spectrometers equipped with pulsed-field gradient probes. Proton chemical shifts were referenced to internal 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentanesulfonic acid at 0 ppm. 15N and 13C chemical shifts were referenced to the proton spectrum using the ratio of gyromagnetic moments (γN/γH = 0.10132905, γC/γH = 0.25144952). Data were processed using the Gifa program, versions 4.2 and 4.3 (25Pons J.L. Malliavin T.E. Delsuc M.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), and peak picking and assignment were carried out with XEASY (26Bartels C. Xia T.-H. Billeter M. Guntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar). Resonance assignments and HNHα coupling constants for the PBX homeodomain and the HOXA1 peptide were obtained by standard methods. The methyl groups of valine and leucine side chains were assigned stereospecifically from a13C-HSQC of a 10% 13C-labeled sample. DNA assignments were made from a two-dimensional ω1,ω2-13C-filtered NOESY. Distance restraints for the binary complex were derived from a 15N-edited HSQC-NOESY, a13C-edited HSQC-NOESY, a two-dimensional ω1,ω2-13C-filtered NOESY, and a two-dimensional ω2-13C-filtered NOESY. All NOESY spectra were recorded at 30 °C with mixing times of 150 ms. Intermolecular NOEs in the ternary complex were obtained from a 15N-HSQC NOESY, a13C-HSQC NOESY, and a two-dimensional transferred NOE experiment recorded for a sample of 4.3 mm chemically synthesized HOXA1 with 5% (mol:mol) PBX 1–78-DNA complex. 1H-15N couplings were measured for the PBX-DNA complex in isotropic solution and two aligned media: 10 mg/ml filamentous phage at 30 °C, and 5 mg/mlq = 3.0 DMPC/DHPC bicelles at 37 °C. Initial values for Da and R were estimated from the RDC powder pattern (27Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1998; 133: 216-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Final values of 13.5 and 0.6 in bicelles and 15.5 and 0.55 in phage for Da and R, respectively, were determined using a variational method (28Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Tjandra N. J. Magn. Reson. 1998; 131: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar).1H-13C residual couplings were measured by taking twice the difference in peak position between at1-coupled 13C-HSQC and a13C-HMQC. DNA RDCs were recorded in the presence and absence of DMPC/DHPC bicelles in 100% D2O. 100 structures of the PBX-DNA complex were generated on the basis of the restraints listed in Table I. The 20 lowest energy structures were chosen to represent the solution structure of the binary complex. 1180 NOEs were assigned manually, and eight iterations of ARIA (29Nilges M. Macias M.J. O'Donoghue S.I. Oschkinat H. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 408-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) were used to obtain additional assignments. The starting conformation for the calculation consisted of the free PBX homeodomain (9Sprules T. Green N. Featherstone M. Gehring K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9943-9950Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) with the N-terminal arm and C-terminal extension modeled as extended strands and placed next to B-form DNA. Initially crystallography and NMR System (CNS; Yale University) was used to generate 100 structures with the DNA duplex frozen. The protein and DNA were then submitted to a second round of dynamical annealing using Cartesian dynamics, starting from the structures generated in the first round, with the dummy coordinate system for the RDCs fixed and with NOE and RDC constraints for the DNA added.Table IStructure calculationsRestraints for structure calculations Total restraints used2747 Total PBX NOE restraints1886 Intraresidue573 Sequential (‖i −j‖ = 1)468 Medium range (1 < ‖i− j‖ ≤ 4)510 Long range (‖i −j‖ > 4)335 Total DNA NOE restraints562 Total Intermolecular restraints60 Hydrogen bond restraints84 Dihedral angle restraints57 J-coupling restraints11 Residual dipolar coupling restraints PBX60 DNA27Statistics for structure calculations〈SA〉1-a〈SA〉 refers to the ensemble of the 20 lowest energy structures of 100 calculated. r.m.s.d. from idealized covalent geometry Bonds (Å)0.0033 ± 0.0001 Bond angles (°)0.60 ± 0.02 Improper torsions (°)0.66 ± 0.02 r.m.s.d. from experimental restraints1-bNo distance restraint in any of the structures included in the ensemble was violated by more than 0.45 Å.

Open table in a new tab We have determined the structure of the extended PBX homeodomain (PBX 1–78) bound to a DNA duplex containing the PBX recognition site 3′-ATGAT-5′ (Fig. 1). An ensemble of 20 structures, with a backbone root-mean-square deviation of 0.54 Å (Table I), was chosen to represent the structure of the complex in solution. The extended PBX homeodomain consists of four α-helices and an N-terminal arm (Fig. 2). The first α-helix runs from Lys-10 to Phe-20, the second from Glu-28 to Ser-38, the third from Val-42 to Lys-58, and the fourth from Ile-60 to Ala-72. The fourth α-helix forms on binding of the homeodomain to the DNA duplex and folds across the homeodomain at an angle of approximately 65° to helix three, crossing helix one. A number of intermolecular NOEs are observed that position PBX on the DNA duplex. The N-terminal arm lies in the minor groove of the DNA. Many NOEs are observed between its arginine and lysine side chains and the sugar protons of −G4, −T5, −A6 and +A8, as well as the H2s of −A6 and +A8. Particularly strong NOEs are observed between the δ and ε protons of Arg-5 and the H2 of −A6. Both Arg-5 and the TA base pair (T NAT) are highly conserved in all homeodomains and recognition sites (1Gehring W.J. Affolter M. Bürglin T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 487-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). The PBX three-amino acid extension is accommodated in loop 1 in such a way that a conserved Tyr-25-phosphate backbone contact is preserved. The third α-helix sits in the major groove of the DNA. The methyl groups of isoleucine 54 in the third helix show strong NOEs to the sugars and bases of −A9, −A10, and −C11. Residual dipolar couplings were used in the refinement of the structure to compensate for the lack of long range NOEs in the nucleic acid. RDCs in the binary complex were measured in two aligned media, lipid bicelles and filamentous phage. The structure was refined using the RDCs measured in bicelle media. 601H-15N residual dipolar couplings were measured for the backbone amides of the PBX homeodomain aligned in lipid bicelles. The distribution of positive and negative RDCs reflects the orientation of the four α-helices (Fig. 3). The PBX-DNA complex aligns with the axis of the DNA duplex; the first three α-helices are roughly perpendicular to the magnetic field, and the fourth α-helix is parallel to the magnetic field. RDCs were also measured for PBX in the ternary PBX-DNA-HOX complex aligned in filamentous phage (data not shown). The orientation of both the binary and ternary complexes with respect to the external magnetic field was very similar. 28 aromatic and H1′-C1′ residual dipolar couplings in the DNA were measured at natural 13C abundance. Interference between chemical shift anisotropy and dipolar relaxation mechanisms in the binary complex resulted in a TROSY-like effect (30Pervushin K. Riek R. Wider G. Wüthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12366-12371Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar) in the proton-coupled 13C-HSQC. The effect was most pronounced for the aromatic and C1′-H1′ cross-peaks, for which only the slowly relaxing component of each 13C doublet was observed. The large chemical shift anisotropy of aromatic carbons (>100 ppm) results in favorable conditions for implementation of TROSY-type experiments in the assignment of nucleic acids and aromatic residues of proteins (31Pervushin K. Riek R. Wider G. Wüthrich K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 6394-6400Crossref Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 32Riek R. Pervushin K. Fernandez C. Kainosho M. Wüthrich K. J. Am. Chem.

The transverse relaxation rates of multiple quantum coherences are longer than those of the corresponding single quantum coherences. This phenomenon has also been exploited to improve sensitivity in NMR experiments on large biomolecules (33Fiala R. Czernek J. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 16: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 34Kuboniwa H. Grzesiek S. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol.

A13C-HMQC spectrum was acquired to measure1H-13C splittings. This method showed the1H-decoupled chemical shifts and hence allowed calculation of the 1H-13C couplings with only a single component of the doublet (Fig. 3). The 13C-HMQC experiment was more sensitive than an 1H-decoupled13C-HSQC and yielded a more complete set of residual dipolar couplings (data not shown). Residual dipolar couplings for both the DNA and the PBX homeodomain were well satisfied in the structure calculation (Fig. 3 e). HOX-derived YPWM peptides were studied both free and bound to the PBX-DNA complex. The peptides encompass the YPWM motif and flanking residues of HOXA1 and HOXD4 (Fig. 1). ROESY spectra were recorded at 15 °C and pH 5.0 for the free peptides. Medium range ROEs were observed between the aromatic ring of residue 4 and methionine 7 in both peptides (Fig. 4). ROEs between the methyl groups of Val-9 and the aromatic rings of Phe-4 and Trp-6 are observed in HOXA1, and the side-chains of Val-2 and Tyr-4 of HOXD4 are close together. At a higher temperature and pH value (30 °C, pH 6.8), the amide cross-peaks in the 15N-HSQC are well dispersed, indicating that the structure is retained under these conditions (Fig. 5 a).Figure 5Binding of the HOXA1 peptide to the PBX-DNA complex. a, superposition of the 15N-HSQC of the free (black) and bound (gray) HOXA1 peptide.

Formation of the ternary complex was followed by the recording of a series of 15N-HSQC spectra of the labeled polypeptide during titration with the unlabeled component. The amide cross-peaks for residues in PBX loop one and the C-terminal half of helix three broaden and shift as HOXA1 is added to the PBX-DNA complex. Residues in the C-terminal extension experience smaller changes in chemical shift (9Sprules T. Green N. Featherstone M. Gehring K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9943-9950Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Amide cross-peaks broaden, and significant changes in chemical shift are observed for residues 4–10 of HOXA1 when the PBX-DNA complex is titrated into the peptide (Fig. 5). 1H-15N heteronuclear NOEs are positive for amino acids 3–12, indicating that they are structured (Fig. 5 c). In contrast to the binding of PBX to DNA, which is in slow exchange on the NMR time scale, the HOXA1 peptide binds to the PBX-DNA complex in an intermediate exchange regime. The low affinity of a truncated HOXA1 peptide (residues 1–12 of the HOXA1 peptide) for the PBX-DNA complex allowed the use of transferred NOEs to study its bound conformation. A sample in which the peptide was in 20-fold molar excess over the binary complex was prepared. Under these conditions information about the bound state of the peptide is transferred to the free state and observed. The proton resonances of the side chains of Phe-4, Trp-6, and Lys-8 were broadened compared with the free peptide (Fig. 4). These side chains are involved in binding to PBX. More intramolecular NOEs are observed in a transferred NOESY spectrum than in the ROESY spectrum of the free HOXA1 peptide, indicating that it becomes more structured on binding to the PBX-DNA complex. Intermolecular NOEs between the aromatic rings of Phe-4 and Trp-6 and the methyls of Leu-23a, and Met-7 and Ile-60 place the YPWM motif in a pocket formed by loop one and helix three, as expected from the changes in PBX chemical shifts. 15N and 13C-HSQC-NOESY spectra of PBX in the binary and ternary complexes are very similar. Additional NOEs are observed to the backbone amide of Ser-23b, which is solvent-exposed in the binary complex. Some chemical shifts change for the amino acids around the hydrophobic binding pocket, although the NOE patterns are the same. The imino protons of base pairs 7 and 8 shift slightly when HOXA1 is titrated into the PBX-DNA complex; otherwise the DNA spectrum is unchanged. The HOXA1 peptide binds to a preformed hydrophobic pocket bordered by the TALE and helices three and four of PBX. Our determination of the binary PBX-DNA structure demonstrates that the PBX homeodomain and the HOX YPWM motif interact via a “lock and key” mechanism. On binding to DNA, the third α-helix of the PBX homeodomain lengthens, and contact between Tyr-25 and the DNA duplex brings the loop between the first two helices closer to the third helix. This creates a hydrophobic pocket bordered by the TALE and the C terminus of the third α-helix. The fourth α-helix, which forms on binding to DNA, contributes an additional side to the pocket. The HOX YPWM motif, which is partially folded by hydrophobic interactions, inserts into this pocket. An increase in the number of NOEs observed for the HOXA1 peptide indicates it becomes more structured when it binds to PBX. No changes are observed in the conformation of the PBX homeodomain on formation of the ternary complex. The lengthening of the third α-helix when PBX binds to DNA induces the formation of a fourth α-helix in the C-terminal extension (9Sprules T. Green N. Featherstone M. Gehring K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9943-9950Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar,36Jabet C. Gitti R. Summers M.F. Wolberger C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 521-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This α-helix folds over the homeodomain and contacts helix one, thereby reducing the mobility of the third helix. This accounts for the increased DNA-binding affinity of the extended PBX homeodomain, PBX 1–78, in comparison with the homeodomain, PBX 1–59 (11Lu Q. Kamps M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1632-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 14Green N.C. Rambaldi I. Teakles J. Featherstone M.S. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 663-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). No additional DNA contacts are formed by the C-terminal extension. PBX 1–78 also demonstrates higher affinity for HOX proteins and peptides (11Lu Q. Kamps M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1632-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 14Green N.C. Rambaldi I.

Chem. 1998; 273: 13273-13279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) because of stabilization of the hydrophobic binding pocket and formation of additional PBX-HOX contacts in the C-terminal extension. Conversely, HOX-derived peptides stimulate binding of the PBX homeodomain to DNA (11Lu Q. Kamps M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1632-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 16Knoepfler P.S. Kamps M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5811-5819Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The third α-helix is involved in both DNA and YPWM binding interactions (9Sprules T. Green N. Featherstone M. Gehring K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9943-9950Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 12Piper D.E. Batchelor A.H. Chang C.-P. Cleary M.L. Wolberger C.

Nature. 1999; 397: 714-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The chemical shifts of the imino protons of base pairs 7 and 8 change slightly when the HOXA1 peptide binds to the PBX-DNA complex. No direct contacts occur between the peptide and the DNA, which suggests that the change in the environment of the base pairs is a result of the repositioning of PBX side chains. Proton resonances in the base and sugar moieties of +G7 and +A8 are among the broadest in the binary complex. The disordered side chains of Arg-53 and Arg-55 may form more stable contacts with DNA in the presence of the HOX YPWM motif. The PBX-DNA structure was compared with the crystal structure of a PBX-DNA-HOXB1 complex (12Piper D.E. Batchelor A.H. Chang C.-P. Cleary M.L. Wolberger C. Cell. 1999; 96: 587-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The conformation of the PBX homeodomain is very similar in the NMR and crystal structures (average root-mean-square deviation 1.1 Å for the backbone atoms of the three core α-helices). Differences are seen in the positions of the C-terminal half of helix three, helix four, and the extended loop. The crystal structure includes the PBX homeodomain, the HOXB1 homeodomain and YPWM motif, and a 20-base pair DNA duplex. Each homeodomain introduces a slight bend in the DNA. In comparison, a single PBX homeodomain is bound to a 14-mer DNA duplex in the NMR structure. Helix three of the PBX homeodomain lies in the major groove of the DNA. In the PBX-HOXB1 heterodimer, the N-terminal arm of the HOX homeodomain contacts the same bases from the minor groove. The slightly different conformation of the DNA results in the differences in the positions of the third and fourth helices between the NMR and crystal structures. The PBX-HOXB1 recognition site is 5′-TGATTGAT-3′. A single TGAT site was used in the NMR structure determination to avoid homodimer formation. In the NMR structure tyrosine 25 in the extended loop thus contacts a guanine close to the end of the DNA duplex rather than the thymine present in the crystal structure. Combined with the bend in the DNA introduced by the HOXB1 homeodomain in the crystal structure, this results in the shift in the position of the loop between helices one and two. No changes were observed in the conformation of the PBX-DNA complex on binding of a HOXA1-derived YPWM peptide. The differences in PBX in the NMR and crystal structures are a result of the sandwiching of the DNA between two homeodomains. ROESY spectra of the HOXA1 and HOXD4 peptides indicate that there is some structure in the absence of PBX (Fig. 4 a). Hydrophobic interactions between the aromatic ring of the tyrosine (or phenylalanine) and the conserved methionine fold the peptide. Interactions between conserved aromatic and hydrophobic residues flanking the core YPWM motif also contribute. The HOXA1 peptide becomes more structured on binding to the PBX homeodomain. Chemical shift dispersion increases in 15N-HSQC spectra and more intramolecular NOEs are observed. NMR studies at low temperature of two six-amino acid peptides, TFDWMK and LFPWMR (i.e. residues 3–8 of our HOX peptides), have also demonstrated that the YPWM motif is partially prefolded in solution (37Slupsky C.M. Sykes D.B. Gay G.L. Sykes B.D. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1244-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The conformation of the PBX-bound HOXA1 peptide is similar to the corresponding region of HOXB1 in the crystal structure of the PBX-HOXB1 heterodimer (12Piper D.E. Batchelor A.H. Chang C.-P. Cleary M.L. Wolberger C. Cell. 1999; 96: 587-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The HOX YPWM motif binds to PBX through hydrophobic interactions. Contacts are observed between the conserved tryptophan ring and the side chain of Leu-23a in the extended loop in both the crystal structure and NOESY spectra of the ternary complex. Intermolecular NOEs also place the methionine and phenylalanine side chains within the hydrophobic binding pocket as in the PBX-HOXB1 heterodimer. However, the relatively weak binding of the HOXA1 peptide to the PBX-DNA complex, and broad NMR line widths indicate that the peptide experiences some conformational exchange that is not seen in the crystal structure. In the crystal, the intact HOXB1 homeodomain and linker region stabilize the HOX YPWM motif-PBX interaction. The structures of the PBX-DNA and PBX-DNA-HOXB1 complexes show how PBX-HOX heterodimers achieve increased DNA binding affinity and different sequence selectivity (4Lu Q. Knoepfler P.S. Scheele J.

Biol. 1996; 16: 1734-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) and demonstrate the importance of DNA-binding by PBX for heterodimer formation. The amino acid sequences of the HOX N-terminal arm and the YPWM motif are the most important determinants of binding site preference for PBX-HOX complexes (5Chang C.P. Brocchieri L. Shen W.F.

The insertion of the HOX YPWM “key” into the hydrophobic “lock” on the surface of the PBX homeodomain tethers the HOX homeodomain to the DNA duplex, resulting in the formation of more stable contacts between the HOX N-terminal arm and DNA. Nevertheless, the formation of PBX-HOX heterodimers is not the sole determinant of the very precise in vivo functions of the different HOX proteins. PBX-HOX binding sites have been identified in several gene regulatory elements, including the Hoxb1 andHoxb2 r4 enhancers (38Chen J. Ruley H.E. J. Biol.

Thus, the presence of a third partner may be expected to further modify protein-protein and subtle protein-DNA interactions in the DNA-bound homeodomains. 750-MHz spectra were acquired at the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory (a national scientific user facility sponsored by the United States Department of Energy Office of Biological and Environmental Research) located at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, operated by Battelle for the Department of Energy. 800-MHz spectra were acquired at the National Highfield Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Centre facility located at the University of Alberta."
https://openalex.org/W2171899761,"We characterized the uptake of ferric enterobactin (FeEnt), the native Escherichia coli ferric siderophore, through its cognate outer membrane receptor protein, FepA, using a site-directed fluorescence methodology. The experiments first defined locations in FepA that were accessible to covalent modification with fluorescein maleimide (FM) in vivo; among 10 sites that we tested by substituting single Cys residues, FM labeled W101C, S271C, F329C, and S397C, and all these exist within surface-exposed loops of the outer membrane protein. FeEnt normally adsorbed to the fluoresceinated S271C and S397C mutant FepA proteins in vivo, which we observed as quenching of fluorescence intensity, but the ferric siderophore did not bind to the FM-modified derivatives of W101C or F329C. These in vivo fluorescence determinations showed, for the first time, consistency with radioisotopic measurements of the affinity of the FeEnt-FepA interaction; K d was 0.2 nm by both methods. Analysis of the FepA mutants with AlexaFluor680, a fluorescein derivative with red-shifted absorption and emission spectra that do not overlap the absorbance spectrum of FeEnt, refuted the possibility that the fluorescence quenching resulted from resonance energy transfer. These and other data instead indicated that the quenching originated from changes in the environment of the fluor as a result of loop conformational changes during ligand binding and transport. We used the fluorescence system to monitor FeEnt uptake by live bacteria and determined its dependence on ligand concentration, temperature, pH, and carbon sources and its susceptibility to inhibition by the metabolic poisons. Unlike cyanocobalamin transport through the outer membrane, FeEnt uptake was sensitive to inhibitors of electron transport and phosphorylation, in addition to its sensitivity to proton motive force depletion.

Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N. Y.1972Google Scholar) and subcultured at 1% into MOPS medium (44Neidhardt F.C. Bloch P.L. Smith D.F. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 119: 736-747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing appropriate nutritional supplements at 37 °C with shaking to mid-log phase. For labeling in energy-deficient conditions, after growth in LB and subculture in MOPS the bacteria were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in the same volume of MOPS media but without glucose or casamino acids, and with half the usual supplementation of required amino acids. The culture was then incubated with shaking for 10 h at 37 °C. Bacteria were collected by centrifugation (5000 × g, 20 min), washed with and resuspended in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), pH 7.4, to a final concentration of 5 × 108 cells/ml. Fluorescein maleimide (FM) or AlexaFluor680 maleimide (AM) in dimethyl formamide (less than 0.1% of final volume) was added to a final concentration of 5 μm and incubated at room temperature for 30 min in the dark with shaking. The labeled cells were centrifuged, washed three times with 25 ml of ice-cold TBS plus 0.05% Tween-20, washed once with and resuspended in ice-cold TBS, and stored on ice for immediate use. We evaluated labeling specificity with anti-FepA and anti-IAF immunoblots of cell lysates and with fluorescence emission scans of labeled experimental and control bacterial cultures. In the former case, lysates from 108cells were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and Western immunoblot with anti-BSA-IAF sera; the reactions were quantified on a Storm Scanner (Molecular Dynamics) after development with 125I-Protein A (42Newton S.M. Allen J.S. Cao Z., Qi, Z. Jiang X. Sprencel C. Igo J.D. Foster S.B. Payne M.A. Klebba P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4560-4565Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The immunoblots showed that expression of FepA did not significantly vary under the culture conditions we employed. The anti-BSA-IAF serum was equally effective against proteins and cells modified by FM, demonstrating its recognition of the fluorescein moiety. The characteristic orange color of fluorescein facilitated qualitative evaluation of labeling specificity by visual inspection of treated cell pellets. Strains expressing wild type FepA, which was not labeled by either IAF or FM, were not colored after treatment with the reagents, whereas bacteria expressing mutant FepA proteins containing single, genetically engineered cysteines in accessible locations were identified by the orange color of their cell pellets. To quantitatively determine fluorescein labeling specificity, we performed emission scans at 20 °C with an excitation wavelength of 490 nm and a 5 s integration time. We compared scans for fluorescein-labeled strains expressing wild type and mutant FepA proteins and used scans of untreated bacteria to establish the background fluorescence. Using an SLM-AMINCO 8000 fluorimeter (Rochester, NY) upgraded to 8100 functionality, we recorded the fluorescence intensities of bacteria (5 × 107 cells) suspended in 2 ml of either TBS or MOPS media and equilibrated at temperature. For fluorescence determinations of FeEnt binding affinity, we added various concentrations of FeEnt to the cell suspension and recorded fluorescence intensity with excitation and emission wavelengths of 490 nm and 518 nm, respectively, for fluorescein and 679 nm and 702 nm for AlexaFluor680. We accounted for background fluorescence and volume changes and analyzed the data with the bound (1-F/F0)versus total function of GraFit 4 (Erithacus Software Ltd., Middlesex, UK). To study the effect of inhibitors on FeEnt uptake, 5 × 107FM-labeled, energy-starved cells were first incubated for 40 min at 37 °C with shaking in TBS buffer plus glucose (0.4%) and the corresponding inhibitors. The cells were transferred to the sample cuvette, equilibrated at the measurement temperature, and the uptake time course was recorded. OM proteins contain few unpaired cysteines, and we tested the possibility that genetically engineered single Cys residues at sites of interest may be covalently modified in live bacteria with -SH-specific fluorescent probes. Although we previously modified residue E280C in FepA L3 with nitroxide compounds (14Jiang X. Payne M.A. Cao Z. Foster S.B. Feix J.B. Newton S.M. Klebba P.E.

Ferric Enterobactin Transport through FepA in Escherichia coli from Hydrophobic Stacking to Charge InteractionsPh.D. thesis.

Therefore, from the FepA crystal structure we designed and introduced 10 more individual, unpaired Cys residues at positions either on the cell surface or within the periplasm: W101C, S150C, S211C, Y260C, S271C, F329C, S397C, S423C, S575C, and S595C. Among these 10 target Cys residues, FM specifically labeled W101C, S271C, F329C, and S397C, which all reside in cell surface-exposed loops of FepA (Fig. 1 A) above the level of the LPS core sugars; W101 lies in the second loop of the N-domain, whereas S271, F329, and S397 exist in loops 3, 4, and 5, respectively, of the C-domain. FM also specifically modified, at lower levels, sites S63C and S150C, which reside in NL1 and on the periplasmic rim of the FepA β-barrel, respectively. Further study showed that two circumstances affected the specificity and efficiency of the fluorescence labeling procedure: the nature of the LPS O-antigen and the bacterial culture conditions. In our initial experiments the bacteria adsorbed fluorescence probes, but we saw little difference in the fluorescence intensity of FM-treated KDF541/pFepAS271C and KDF541/pITS449 (fepA +). The use of two different reagents, IAEDANS and coumarin maleimide, did not remedy this lack of specificity (data not shown). KDF541, the E. coli strain that was the usual host for plasmids, produces rough LPS without any O-antigen, and we considered the possibility that LPS was a determining factor in the specificity of the fluorescence labeling reactions. The use of deep rough mutant strains did not improve the labeling specificity of surface-exposed Cys residues (data not shown). Although Western blots revealed specific covalent modification of some of the Cys mutants, FM nonspecifically adsorbed to deep rough strains, which was apparent in the yellow color of the cell pellets that was not diminished by repeated washing. These results suggested that in deep rough strains, and to a lesser extent in rough strains, the fluorescent reagents penetrated into the OM bilayer and resisted washing procedures. The converse experiment confirmed this inference; the use of bacterial cells synthesizing full-length LPS minimized nonspecific adsorption of fluorescent dyes. We achieved this result by introducing pMF19, which carries a rhamnosyl transferase that allows production of the LPS O-chain (wbbL+) (37Feldman M.F. Valvano M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35129-35138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Strains harboring pMF19 and one of the four accessible Cys substitution mutants of FepA were specifically labeled by FM, as seen by fluorescence intensity measurements of live bacteria and in Western immunoblots (Fig. 1 B). We measured the ability of the four surface-localized, Cys substitution mutants of FepA to bind 59FeEnt before and after fluoresceination. Adsorption of the ferric siderophore was weak and barely detectable in W101C- and F329C-FM; attachment of fluorescein at these sites sterically hindered the adsorption of the siderophore. These data concurred with the prior conclusion that residue Phe329 exists in close proximity to, or is a component of, an initial FeEnt binding site (B1) (11Cao Z., Qi, Z. Sprencel C. Newton S.M. Klebba P.E. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 1306-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar); the crystal structure shows W101C in the middle of the FepA vestibule (Fig. 1 A). On the other hand, FM modification of S271C or S397C did not interfere with FeEnt recognition and binding; bacteria expressing either of these mutant proteins manifested normal (subnanomolar) binding affinities (Fig. 2) even after fluoresceination. These experiments showed, for the first time, correspondence between the binding affinities measured in vivo by radioisotopic and fluorescence methodologies (K d = 0.3 nm). In subsequent experiments we exclusively studied the S271C site, located at the extremity of L3. Ligand binding diminished the fluorescence of probes attached to FepA at E280C, and our modifications and analyses of S271C and S397C showed the same quenching phenomenon in vivo. Previous determinations of binding kinetics found a biphasic association reaction between purified FepAE280C-FM and FeEnt and ColB (10Payne M.A. Igo J.D. Cao Z. Foster S.B. Newton S.M. Klebba P.E. J.

Microbiol. 2000; 37: 1306-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We interpreted these data as initial ligand adsorption to an external site (B1), followed by movement to a second site deeper in the vestibule (B2). The ability of E280C-FM to reflect these two binding phases presumably arose from changes in the local environment of the fluor that occurred as the receptor protein underwent conformational dynamics during ligand adsorption. However, because its absorption spectrum overlaps the emission spectrum of fluorescein, the possibility existed that during its binding FeEnt quenched fluorescence by energy transfer between the excited fluor and the ferric siderophore. Studies with a red-shifted fluorescein derivative that does not overlap the absorption spectrum of FeEnt (AM: 679 nm and 702 nm, respectively), refuted this explanation (Fig. 2); during FeEnt binding, FepA proteins modified with AM exhibited equivalent reductions in intensity to those modified with FM. The comparable quenching of AM, without the possibility of energy transfer to FeEnt, indicated that the reductions in intensity did not derive from close proximity of the ferric siderophore to the fluor. Rather, the data favored the notion that binding triggers conformational dynamics that alter the environment of the reporter molecules. At physiological temperatures we expected a decrease in the polarization of fluorescent labels attached to the surface loops of FepA because of increased Brownian motion (46Einstein A. Ann. Phys. 1906; 19: 371Crossref Scopus (685) Google Scholar, 47Langevin P. Comptes Rendus. 1908; 146: 530Google Scholar). The polarization of FepAS397C-FM (in L5) decreased as the temperature of the system was raised, but that of FepAS271C-FM (in L3) increased (Fig. 3). These data confirmed that the temperature affected the motion of the attached fluor; L3 became less mobile and L5 became more mobile in response to increased temperature. These states were reversible as the temperature of the system decreased again. When exposed to FeEnt at 20 °C, KDF541/pMF19/pS271C-FM bound and transported it, and we spectroscopically monitored these reactions. Subsequent to its binding, we observed FeEnt transport as a recovery of fluorescence intensity, but only when the extracellular free ligand was depleted by its uptake into the cells. At that time, when the population of receptor proteins was vacated, its original fluorescence intensity returned. The consumption of FeEnt was necessary to observe fluorescence changes because, when present, it bound and quenched again. Thus in the presence of sufficient excess of the ferric siderophore, we saw no renewal of fluorescence.2 When it occurred, the resurgence of fluorescence paralleled the kinetics of FeEnt uptake, independently measured in 59Fe uptake experiments (Fig. 4). In those studies, the increase in fluorescence intensity occurred between 1200 and 1400 s. The corresponding radioisotope uptake experiment at 20 °C showed that accumulation of 59FeEnt stopped at the same time as a result of depletion of the substrate from the media. So the recovery of fluorescence intensity precisely mirrored the depletion of the ligand from the culture. Consistent with prior observations of the energy-dependent uptake reaction (9Newton S.M.

Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6689-6696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the spectroscopic measurement of FeEnt transport was affected by media composition, FeEnt concentration, and temperature. It occurred more slowly in bacteria deprived of nutritional requirements, either in minimal media lacking auxotrophic amino acid supplements or suspended in TBS (Fig. 5 A). As discussed above, at 20 °C the transport of FeEnt was visible as a return of fluorescence intensity, and the concentration-dependence of the phenomenon was striking. For bacteria exposed to 2, 5, 10, and 20 nmFeEnt, the lag time preceding transport was 250, 550, 1000, and 2050 s, respectively (Fig. 5 B). Furthermore, AM-labeled cells showed t"

To test whether tumors might be prevented by maintaining the innate immune system on continuous alert, proto-neu transgenic female mice, which develop spontaneous mammary tumors, were systemically treated with CpG-ODNs at 10-day intervals. Tumor incidence and number of tumors/mouse were significantly lower in treated mice compared with the control group. Moreover, CpG-ODN systemic treatment significantly reduced lung metastases induced by intravenous inoculation of N202.1A cells derived from a spontaneous mammary carcinoma. Growth of established tumors was modestly inhibited after CpG-ODN systemic treatment but strongly on peritumoral application. Our data indicate that systemic repeated injection of CpG-ODN to maintain the innate immune system on continuous alert prevents the onset of genetically determined tumors and confers tumor protection when the tumor load is low."

The α1-ARs initiate their physiological effects by activating phospholipase C at the cell membrane, resulting in production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate.

The CHO-K1 cell line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Genes encoding the human α1A-, α1B-, or α1D-AR were ligated into the EcoRI site of the eukaryotic expression vector, pSVK3, containing the neomycin-resistance gene of pMAM-neo (pSVK3neo) as described previously (23Shibata K.

Cells were passaged using trypsin. For stable expression of human α1A-, α1B-, or α1D-AR subtype, CHO-K1 cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 104 cells in 35-mm tissue culture dishes. One day after seeding the cells, the medium was removed, and 1 ml of serum-free F12 medium containing 13.8 μg of Lipofectin (24Felgner P.L. Gadek T.R. Holm M. Roman R. Chan H.W. Wenz M. Northrop J.P.

At 24 h after DNA-lipid treatment, 1 ml of F12 medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum was added. The cells were passaged at a low density ∼72 h later. Single colonies resistant to the antibiotic G418 (600 μg/ml) were isolated and maintained in F12 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 200 μg/ml G418. Three clonal CHO cell lines for each α1-AR subtype (α1A-, α1B-, or α1D-AR), which stably express the α1-AR at similar level, were established and used for subsequent studies. Specifically, one line of CHO stable transfectants was designated as CHOα1A, CHOα1B, and CHOα1D. The ligand-binding characteristics of the receptors expressed in CHO cells were determined in a preliminary series of radioligand-binding studies performed as described previously (23Shibata K.

Competition isotherms showed the expected pharmacology for each receptor subtype (23Shibata K. Foglar R. Horie K. Obika K. Sakamoto A. Ogawa S. Tsujimoto G. Mol.

Cell. 1994; 79: 487-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Confluent cells grown in 96-well plates were rendered quiescent by serum deprivation for 24 h. The cells were then incubated with 10% serum with or without 10 μm phenylephrine for 18 h and for an additional 6 h with [6-3H]thymidine (1 μCi/ml, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, precipitated with cold 5% trichloroacetic acid, and then washed with cold ethanol and solubilized with 0.5n NaOH. DNA radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. Cells at 50% confluence in 35-mm culture dishes were rendered quiescent by serum deprivation for 24 h. The cells were then incubated with 10% serum with or without 10 μm phenylephrine for 48 h. Flow cytometric analysis of each CHO cell stained with propidium iodide was used to estimate the cell cycle phase distributions using the CycleTESTTM Plus DNA Regent Kit (BD Biosciences). Subsequent flow-cytometric analysis was performed with a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Data were analyzed using the CellFIT software (BD Biosciences). Cells at 50% confluence in 35-mm culture dishes were rendered quiescent by serum deprivation for 24 h and treated with phenylephrine (10 μm) for 10 s at 37 °C. The medium was subsequently removed, and cells were scraped into 1 ml of 20% (w/v) perchloric acid on ice. After centrifugation, the supernatant was adjusted to pH 7.0 with HEPES-KOH solution, and the sediment was eliminated by centrifugation. Amounts of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate in a sample were measured by a radioreceptor assay with thed-myo-inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate [3H] assay kit (TRK 1000, Amersham Biosciences). Cells were rendered quiescent by serum deprivation for 24 h before stimulation with 10% serum in the presence or absence of phenylephrine for 30 min at 37 °C. Cell monolayers were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and lysed, and the overall activity of ERK1/2 MAPK in the lysate was determined using the BiotrakTM MAPK assay (Amersham Biosciences) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Aliquots of 15 μl of cell lysates freshly obtained or stored at −80 °C corresponding to 10 μg of protein were incubated at 30 °C with 15 μl of a reaction mixture containing a synthetic specific peptide substrate and [γ-32P]ATP (1 μCi; 1.2 mm, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After 30 min, the reaction was stopped and samples were spotted on 3-cm discs of binding paper. After several washes in 0.75% phosphoric acid and water, the radioactivity on each disc was then determined by scintillation counting. cAMP production in intact transfected CHO cells was determined as described previously (26Horie K. Itoh H. Tsujimoto G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 392-400PubMed Google Scholar). Each transfected CHO cell population was seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 5 × 105 cells/well and cultured for 12–16 h. The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, incubated for 30 min in HEPES buffer, and then the medium was replaced with the fresh HEPES buffer containing 1 mmisobutylmethylxanthine for 10 min. The reaction was started by adding phenylephrine (10 μm) or forskolin (10 μm). After incubation for 10 min, the medium was aspirated and the reaction was stopped with 6% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. cAMP levels were determined by radioimmunoassay (Yamasa cAMP Assay Kit, Yamasa Shoyu Co., Chiba, Japan). Phentolamine was added 10 min prior to agonist stimulation in HEPES buffer containing 1 mmisobutylmethylxanthine and 1 μmpropanolol. Each transfected CHO cell population was cultured in 15-cm dishes, suspended in lysis buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm benzamidine, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin), and homogenized using the Cell Disruption Bomb (Parr Instrument Co., Moline, IL) at 400 p.s.i. for 30 min. The homogenate was centrifuged at 35,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm benzamidine, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin and then used as membrane preparations. The standard assay mixture contained 20 μg of membrane proteins in 100 μl of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm isobutylmethylxanthine, 0.5 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μm guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate or guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate), and 1 μmpropanolol. Reactions were started by the addition of the agonists, carried out for 15 min at 37 °C, and terminated by boiling at 90 s. The cAMP levels were determined using a cAMP radioimmunoassay kit (Yamasa Shoyu Co.). Following the experimental treatments, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 1% Nonidet P-40 in a buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.4 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors (1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 2.5 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin). After 30 min on ice, the cell extracts were clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 14,500 × g at 4 °C. The p27 Kip1 quantitation was adjusted for protein load, and equal amount of the lysates (10 μg of protein) were mixed with 1× Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 12% gel. The proteins were electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidine fluoride membranes as recommended by the manufacturer. The blots were first incubated with blocking buffer (l% bovine serum albumin in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) and probed with rabbit polyclonal anti-p27 Kip1 antibody (sc-776). The immune complexes were detected using the ECL reagents from AmershamBiosciences and quantitated by densitometry using NIH Image software. The protein concentration was measured using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Values are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Two-way analysis of variance with 95 or 99% confidence limits followed by a Student's t test on individual sets of data was performed with the analytical software StatView 4.0 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). The cell proliferation of CHO cells stably expressing each α1-AR subtype (CHOα1A, CHOα1B, and CHOα1D) was measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation after serum deprivation. Cells were then exposed to serum in either the presence or the absence of α1-AR stimulation. The addition of 10% serum to serum-deprived cells markedly stimulated DNA synthesis in all CHO cell lines expressing any of the α1-AR subtypes. The activation of α1-AR by phenylephrine (10 μm) inhibited the serum-promoted [3H]thymidine incorporation in CHOα1A and CHOα1B cells, whereas such an inhibitory effect was not observed when treating CHOα1D cells with phenylephrine (Fig. 1). [3H]Thymidine incorporation experiments were also performed for additional two clonal CHO stable transfectants for each α1-AR (α1A-, α1B-, or α1D-AR), and we observed similar subtype-specific anti-proliferative effects (data not shown). Thus, the results clearly showed α1-AR subtype-dependent differential effects on the cell proliferation. To explore the mechanism underlying the α1-AR subtype-dependent differential effects on DNA synthesis and morphological alterations, the effects of α1-AR activation on the cell cycle progression were examined by flow cytometric analysis in each of the CHO cell lines. Three distinct cell populations corresponding to the G1, S, and G2/M phases of the cell cycle were readily observed in serum-deprived cells. In addition, there were no significant differences among the cell cycle profiles of CHOα1A, CHOα1B, and CHOα1D cells (Fig. 2). Treatment with serum resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in the cell population in S phase with a concomitant reduction in the cell population in G1 in all CHO cell groups, indicating entry of a significant number of cells into S phase. The addition of 10 μm phenylephrine to serum, however, markedly and reproducibly blocked the cell cycle progression in CHOα1A and CHOα1B. In contrast, the addition of 10 μmphenylephrine to CHOα1D cells failed to block the serum-induced proliferation (Fig. 2). These results indicate that α1-AR activation has an inhibitory effect on serum-promoted cell cycle progression in CHOα1A and CHOα1B cells, whereas stimulation of CHOα1D may have been mildly growth promoting. The phenylephrine-stimulated cell cycle blockade observed in CHOα1A and CHOα1B was reversed by treatment with the α1-AR antagonist, phentolamine, at 10 μm (Fig. 2). We postulated that participation of different intracellular signaling transduction pathways might explain the differential regulation of cell proliferation by α1-AR subtype activation. To evaluate this possibility, we first examined the production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate after α1-AR activation. α1-AR-activated production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate was observed in all α1-AR-expressing CHO cells (Fig. 3 A) but not in untransfected CHO-K1 cells (data not shown). When MAPK activity (ERK isoforms) was measured, α1-AR activation had no discernible effect on serum-stimulated MAPK activity in all CHO cells stably expressing each α1-AR subtype (Fig. 3 B). These results indicated that these early events caused after receptor stimulation were not different upon activation of different α1-AR subtypes. We next decided to examine the ability of α1-AR activation to induce production of cAMP in CHOα1A, CHOα1B, and CHOα1D cells. As shown in Fig. 3 C, α1-AR stimulation resulted in marked cAMP production in CHOα1A and CHOα1B but not in CHOα1D. This was also found to be true for additional two clonal CHO stable transfectants for each α1-AR (α1A-, α1B-, or α1D-AR) (data not shown). On the other hand, an adenylyl cyclase activator, forskolin (5 μm), elicited an ∼10- to 25-fold increase in cAMP production above basal levels in all α1-AR-expressing CHO cells (Fig. 3 C) as well as in untransfected CHO-K1 cells (data not shown). Furthermore, we examined the effects of α1-AR activation on the adenylyl cyclase activity of membranes from each transfected CHO cell line. α1-AR activation increased the adenylyl cyclase activity in the CHOα1A and CHOα1B membranes but not in the CHOα1D (Fig. 3 D). The GTP analog, GTPγS (10 μm), elicited an ∼2- to 4-fold increase in adenylyl cyclase activity above basal levels in all CHOα1A, CHOα1B, and CHOα1D cells. α1-AR-mediated cAMP production and adenylyl cyclase activation in CHOα1A and CHOα1B were abolished by the α1-AR antagonist, phentolamine (10 μm). The α1-AR-induced cAMP response was not observed in wild-type CHO-K1 cells (data not shown). Hence, the above data show that stimulation of α1A- and α1B-AR but not α1D-AR promotes cAMP synthesis in part by activating adenylate cyclase. We next examined the correlation between cAMP signaling pathway and α1-AR-mediated anti-proliferative effects as observed in CHOα1A and CHOα1B. cAMP-inducing agents, cholera toxin, forskolin, and dibutyrl cyclic AMP, all inhibited serum-promoted [3H]thymidine incorporation to 30∼40% of control levels in all three transfected CHO cells (Fig. 4), suggesting that cAMP signaling is an important anti-mitogenic signal in CHO cells. On the other hand, treatment with RpcAMP, an antagonist of cAMP, significantly blocked α1-AR-mediated inhibitory effects on cell proliferation in CHOα1A and CHOα1B (Fig. 4). A series of experiments using cAMP modulators were also performed for additional two clonal CHO stable transfectants for each α1-AR (α1A-, α1B-, or α1D-AR), and we observed basically similar subtype-dependent behavior (data not shown). We next examined whether α1-AR-mediated cAMP production may have an inhibitory effect on the cell cycle progression of CHOα1A and CHOα1B cells. The effect of direct stimulation of Gs protein by cholera toxin on cell proliferation was examined in each α1-AR-expressing CHO cell. As shown in Fig. 2,bottom, the addition of 10 μm cholera toxin resulted in a decreased cell population in S phase in all CHO cell lines. This change in cell cycle profile was similar to that observed in the CHOα1A and CHOα1B cells. Thus, the data indicate that the differential effect of α1-AR subtype stimulation on cell proliferation may be attributed to the differential activation of the cAMP-mediated signaling pathway by each α1-AR subtype. p27 Kip1 is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that negatively regulates cell cycle progression and enforces cell cycle arrest in a cAMP-dependent manner (25Kato J.Y. Matsuoka M. Polyak K. Massague J. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 487-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Hence, we further examined whether changes in p27 Kip1 expression levels could account for the differential effect of α1-AR subtype stimulation on cell cycle progression. As shown in Fig. 5, immunoblot with a specific anti-p27 Kip1 antibody revealed that serum treatment caused a significant reduction in the protein expression level of p27 Kip1 with similar kinetics in all α1-AR-expressing CHO cell lines. On the other hand, the activation of α1-AR by phenylephrine blocked this serum-induced reduction of p27 Kip1 expression only in the CHOα1A and CHOα1B cells but not in the CHOα1D cells (Fig. 5). These phenylephrine-induced changes in the expression of p27 Kip1 in CHOα1A and CHOα1B were blocked by pretreatment with phentolamine (data not shown). Corresponding with the effects on serum-induced cell proliferation, we observed that treatment with cholera toxin and forskolin inhibited the serum-induced reduction in p27 Kip1 expression in all three CHO cell lines as observed when α1A/α1B-AR are activated (Fig. 6). Also, these phenylephrine-induced changes in the expression of p27 Kip1 in CHOα1A and CHOα1B were blocked by RpcAMP (Fig. 6).Figure 6Effect of various agents that modulate cAMP pathway on the level of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1. Serum-starved cells were stimulated with 10% serum in the presence or absence of phenylephrine. Cells were then harvested 48 h after serum addition, and total cell lysates were electrophoresed and immunoblotted with anti-p27 Kip1 antibody. Both the autoradiograph (A) and quantitative data obtained by densitometry using NIH Image software (B) are shown. In all experiments, phentolamine (10 μm) treatment was started 30 min prior to the phenylephrine stimulation.

The activation of α1A- or α1B-AR but not α1D-AR inhibited serum-promoted cell proliferation as evidenced by changes in the cell cycle profiles. In view of the differential expression profiles obtained between α1A/α1B-AR- and α1D-AR-activated cells, we examined the molecular mechanism for the α1-AR subtype-dependent differential effect on cell proliferation. We found that all of the α1-AR subtypes share induction of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production and activation of MAPK pathways (ERK isoforms), but only α1A- and α1B-ARs are coupled to the cAMP signaling pathway. Furthermore, we observed that α1A- or α1B-AR but not α1D-AR can block the serum-induced depletion of the cell cycle-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 Kip1 , which is known to mediate cAMP-induced G1 phase arrest. Taken together, our present data show that the α1A- and α1B-ARs but not α1D-AR are coupled to cAMP synthesis and block serum-promoted depletion of p27 Kip1 , and thereby inhibit serum-promoted cell proliferation. α1-AR stimulation generally promotes cell growth in various cell types. However, recent studies have reported an anti-proliferative effect of α1-AR activation in certain cell types (27Feinstein D.L. Rozelman E. Neurosci. Lett. 1997; 223: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 28Auer K.L. Spector M.S. Tombes R.M. Seth P. Fisher P.B. Gao B. Dent P. Kunos G.

Cell Res. 2000; 258: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In the process of hepatic regeneration after hepatectomy, α1-AR stimulation is thought to act as anti-proliferative signal in hepatic cells (28Auer K.L. Spector M.S. Tombes R.M. Seth P. Fisher P.B. Gao B. Dent P. Kunos G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 29Spector M. Nguyen V.A. Sheng X., He, L. Woodward J. Fan S. Baumgarten C.M. Kunos G. Dent P. Gao B. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 258: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Also, it was reported that the activation of α1B-AR in HepG2 human hepatoma cells stably transfected with a rat α1B-AR cDNA inhibited cell growth via a p42 MAPK and p21 WAF1/CIP1 -dependent mechanism (28Auer K.L. Spector M.S. Tombes R.M. Seth P. Fisher P.B. Gao B. Dent P. Kunos G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This study confirms an inhibitory effect of α1-AR activation on the serum-promoted cell proliferation in a heterologous expression system and shows that the inhibitory effect is subtype-dependent and mediated through cAMP production. In agreement with our findings, Keffel et al.(30Keffel S. Alexandrov A. Goepel M. Michel M.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 906-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) recently has reported that α1-AR subtypes are differentially coupled to growth promotion and growth inhibition in CHO cells (30Keffel S. Alexandrov A. Goepel M. Michel M.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 906-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, Keffel et al. (30Keffel S. Alexandrov A. Goepel M. Michel M.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 906-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) concluded that the opposite effects of α1-AR subtypes on cellular growth are because of quantitative differences in the ERK isoforms in the MAPK signal transduction pathway. Although we confirmed the subtype-dependent differential extent of MAPK activation that is previously reported by Keffel et al. (30Keffel S. Alexandrov A. Goepel M. Michel M.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 906-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) in the serum-free conditions (data not shown), we also found that serum activates the MAPK pathway more dramatically than α1-AR activation. In fact, as shown in Fig. 3 B of this study, α1-AR activation had a small additive stimulatory effect on the serum-promoted MAPK activation in all subtypes. Therefore, we consider that the anti-proliferative effect observed upon activation of α1A/α1B-AR but not of α1D-AR may not be solely explained by the quantitative difference in MAPK activation. α1-ARs have been reported to have a stimulating effect on adenylyl cyclase activity in certain native tissues. In fact, the activation of α1-AR increases cAMP production in tissue sections of rat brain or rat liver (9Morgan N.G. Blackmore P.F. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5103-5109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Johnson R.D. Minneman K.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1986; 31: 239-246Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism and physiological significance of the α1-AR-induced cAMP production have remained uncertain. This report proposes for the first time that α1-ARs activate the cAMP cascade in a subtype-dependent manner and that this differential activation is closely associated with the anti-proliferative effect of the α1-AR subtype. We previously examined the mechanism of α1-AR-mediated cAMP synthesis using α1B-AR as a model and found that α1B-AR-mediated cAMP synthesis is because of a direct coupling of α1B-AR to the Gs protein (26Horie K. Itoh H. Tsujimoto G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 392-400PubMed Google Scholar). However, in other studies, the mechanism of α1-AR-mediated induction of cAMP synthesis was shown to be secondary to its phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis/protein kinase C activation (12Perez D.M. DeYoung M.B. Graham R.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 784-795PubMed Google Scholar, 31Cotecchia S. Kobilka B.K. Daniel K.W. Nolan R.D. Lapetina E.Y. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Regan J.W. J. Biol.

Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 619-626PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, α1-AR-stimulated cAMP production is now considered to involve multiple mechanisms including direct activation of Gs/adenylyl cyclase and a secondary effect through activation of phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis. However, our data showing that all subtypes are efficiently coupled to phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis but that only α1A- and α1B-AR promote cAMP production provide support for a mechanism by which α1-AR-mediated cAMP synthesis is the result of direct coupling to a Gs protein. This study shows that activation of α1-ARs inhibits the serum-promoted cellular growth in a cAMP-dependent manner. Several studies (34Wu J. Dent P. Jelinek T. Wolfman A. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Science. 1993; 262: 1065-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 35Ciullo I. Diez-Roux G., Di Domenico M. Migliaccio A. Avvedimento E.V. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1186-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) have reported that cAMP inhibits growth factor-induced mitogenesis by antagonizing the ERK/MAPK pathway at the Raf-1 level. In this study, however, we did not obtain any evidence in support of such a mechanism. Cell cycle blockade is recognized as another potential mechanism for cAMP/protein kinase A-mediated inhibition of cell proliferation in certain cells (36Hamilton J.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1983; 115: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 37Vairo G. Argyriou S. Bordun A.M. Whitty G. Hamilton J.A. J. Biol.

A. 1993; 90: 6676-6680Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, the cell division cycle is controlled by the formation and activation of protein kinase complexes consisting of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (39Coleman T.R. Dunphy W.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 877-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 40Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2930) Google Scholar, 41Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3209) Google Scholar). The activity of cyclin-cyclin-dependent kinase complexes controls the cell cycle checkpoints in a coordinated way. By inhibiting the kinase activity of the cyclin-dependent kinases, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor proteins interfere with phosphorylation events critical for cell cycle transition (33Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5130) Google Scholar, 41Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3209) Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that cAMP blocks colony-stimulating factor-induced mitogenesis in macrophages by inhibiting the cyclin D1-cyclin-dependent kinase 4 activity via increasing the expression of p27 Kip1 (25Kato J.Y. Matsuoka M. Polyak K. Massague J. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 487-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Our results show that serum stimulation is capable of activating the G1/S transition with a concomitant decrease in the expression level of p27 Kip1 and that these events are inhibited by α1-AR subtype-dependent activation of cAMP. Therefore, it is possible that serum-promoted cell growth may be mediated by a decrease in the steady-state level of p27 Kip1 and that the subtype-dependent anti-proliferative effect could be caused by a cAMP-dependent inhibition of serum-promoted down-regulation of p27 Kip1 . This study provides evidence for the first time for regulation of cell proliferation through a cAMP/p27 Kip1 -related mechanism rather than through an ERK/MAPK-related mechanism. In conclusion, we hereby report that a gene family of highly related α1-ARs exert subtype-dependent differential effects on cell proliferation, although α1-ARs are generally viewed to promote cell proliferation. Moreover, we found that the subtype-dependent differential effects are because of the different signal coupling associated with each subtype. Thus, activation of α1A- and α1B-ARs but not α1D-AR, exerts anti-proliferative effects via the cAMP/p27 Kip1 pathway. The present study was performed by using an α1-AR overexpression system where receptor couplings are sometimes promiscuous. Hence, direct extrapolation of the present findings to a natural system requires caution. Furthermore, in vivo cells naturally co-express varying levels of multiple or all subtypes. The physiological output of adrenergic stimulation in vivo system may consist of complex cellular responses, which involve subtype-dependent differential effects as observed in this study.

Intron-exon boundaries were established for the human and murine ICA1 genes using a combination of λ phage genomic DNA library screening and PCR experiments (4Gaedigk R. Karges W. Hui M.F. Scherer S.W. Dosch H.-M. Genomics. 1996; 38: 382-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Collectively, these data argue for a high level of evolutionary conservation of the ICA1 gene, not only upon comparison of the human protein to the rat (6Miyazaki I. Gaedigk R. Hui M.F. Cheung R.K.

Genomics. 1996; 38: 382-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Recently a protein from the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, termed ric-19, was reported to exhibit amino acid homology with ICA69 (3Pilon M. Peng X.R. Spence A.M. Plasterk R.H. Dosch H.-M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3277-3288Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Based on functional studies of ric-19 in C. elegans, these authors have proposed that ICA69/ric-19 participates in the process of neuroendocrine secretion through an association with secretory vesicles. These data suggest that ICA69 may be involved in the insulin secretory pathway in islet β cells, as the molecule is known to be specifically expressed within islets (8Stassi G. Schloot N. Pietropaolo M. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 120-122PubMed Google Scholar) and by insulin-producing cell lines maintained in culture (2Karges W. Pietropaolo M. Ackerley C. Dosch H.-M. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 513-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, the true cellular function of ICA69 and its importance to normal mammalian pancreatic islet physiology remain unknown. Most basic and clinical research investigations concerning ICA69 have focused on the importance of the molecule as an autoimmune target in Type 1 diabetes. Three lines of evidence from at least four independent groups substantiate a role for ICA69 autoimmunity in diabetes. 1) First degree relatives of diabetic patients who developed the disease during follow-up have detectable serum levels of ICA69 autoantibodies (1Pietropaolo M. Castaño L. Babu S. Buelow R. Kuo Y.-L. Martin S. Martin A. Powers A.C. Prochazka M. Naggert J. Leiter E.H. Eisenbarth G.S. J. Clin.

Diabetologia. 1995; 38: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). 2) T-cells isolated from newly diagnosed diabetic patients and from non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice demonstrate reactivity against the recombinant ICA69 molecule (10Roep B.O. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1147-1156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Roep B.O. Duinkerken G. Schreuder G.M. Th. Kolb H. DeVries R.R.P. Martin S. Eur. J.

Immunol. 1995; 154: 1461-1469PubMed Google Scholar). 3) T-cells specific for the ICA69 peptide Tep-69 play a driving role in the acceleration of islet cell destruction in the NOD mouse model of Type 1 diabetes (13Winer S. Gunaratnam L. Astsatourov I. Cheung R.K. Kubiak V. Karges W. Hammond-McKibben D. Gaedigk R. Graziano D. Trucco M. Becker D.J. Dosch H.-M. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 4086-4094Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), whereas intraperitoneal injection of Tep-69 is associated with apparent immune toleration and decreased diabetes incidence in NOD mice (14Karges W. Hammond-McKibben D. Gaedigk R. Shibuya N. Cheung R. Dosch H.M. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1548-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It has been reported that a majority of patients with recent onset Type 1 diabetes shows evidence of autoreactive T-cells and/or autoantibodies with immune specificity for the ICA69 molecule (11Roep B.O. Duinkerken G. Schreuder G.M. Th. Kolb H. DeVries R.R.P. Martin S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 1285-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), but it must also be acknowledged that some investigators have questioned the significance of ICA69 autoantibodies based on their own studies (15Lampasona V. Ferrari M. Bosi E. Pastore M.R. Bingley P.J. Bonifacio E. J. Autoimmun. 1994; 7: 665-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Motivated by an interest in understanding how autoantigen expression in key body tissues relates to autoimmunity and as a prerequisite to searching for functional polymorphisms in the promoter region of the gene encoding ICA69, we have defined the basic structure and functional characteristics of the ICA1 promoter. Sequences adjacent to the multiple ICA1 transcription initiation sites contain motifs typical of a non-TATA, non-CAAT, GC-rich regulatory region, including consensus Sp1/GC box sites, Inr (initiator) elements, and CREB sites. The major alternative transcription initiation sites associate with independent 5′-UTR exons, and a detailed analysis ofICA1 transcripts from different tissues provides evidence for a tissue-specific utilization of the distinct initiation sites consistent with the observed 5′-UTR heterogeneity of mature protein-coding ICA69 transcripts. In vitro luciferase reporter gene assays of promoter function correlate with the observed preferential transcription initiation site usage within different tissues, whereas site-directed mutagenesis of promoter reporter constructs demonstrate the importance of an Sp1/GC box site and a CREB site to the regulation of expression from exons A and B, respectively. The significance and potential implications of the ICA1promoter structure and function are discussed in the context of understanding ICA69 biology and its role as a Type 1 diabetes autoantigen. Two adherent cell lines were maintained in culture in order to provide RNA for transcript analysis and for testing promoter activity of cloned ICA1 5′-flanking sequences in a firefly luciferase reporter assay. The human neuroblastoma cell line NMB7 was grown in RPMI containing 10% fetal bovine serum, supplemented with l-glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin. Rat insulinoma (RIN 1046-38) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum,l-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Passage of cells was conducted at 70–80% confluence as necessary. All cell culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen and lot-certified in-house. NMB7 cells were provided by Dr. Ira Bergman and Judi Griffin (Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh). Human total genomic DNA was purified from whole blood using the Qiagen Genomic DNA Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA). Briefly, 10 ml of heparinized blood was successively subjected to cellular lysis, nuclear isolation, nuclear lysis, and anion-exchange chromatography using the buffers and prepared columns supplied with the Qiagen kit. Typical yields ranged from 150 to 350 μg of total genomic DNA per 10 ml of whole blood. Bacterial plasmid DNA was isolated by one of two methods, depending upon the quantity and concentration desired. For DNA sequencing and restriction enzyme analysis of subcloned DNA, the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen) was used to isolate 10–20 μg of plasmid DNA from 3 to 5 ml of an overnight bacterial culture. Alternatively, plasmid DNA used for transfection of cultured cells was prepared from 100 to 200 ml of overnight bacterial culture using the Qiagen Maxiprep DNA Isolation Kit. Typical DNA yields ranged from 150 to 450 μg. For BAC clone DNA, a Qiagen Maxiprep protocol modified for use with BACs was followed (protocol available from manufacturer). Major modifications to the basic protocol included the use of a larger culture volume (500 ml) and elution of BAC clone DNA from the column with buffer warmed to 50 °C. Yields of BAC clone DNA ranged from 100 to 150 μg. YAC clone DNA was co-purified along with yeast genomic DNA according to a standard protocol (16Chaplin D.D. Brownstein B.H. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1992Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, following 2000 × g centrifugation of 100 ml of fresh yeast cell culture at room temperature for 10 min, the cell pellet was resuspended in SCE buffer (0.9 m sorbitol, 0.1 m sodium citrate, 0.06 m EDTA) with freshly added 0.3 mβ-mercaptoethanol and lyticase enzyme (Sigma). Formation of yeast spheroplasts was allowed to proceed for 1–2 h at 37 °C with gentle shaking. Spheroplasted cells were then pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min. Yeast cell lysis was achieved by suspension of spheroplasts in lysis buffer (0.5 m Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 3% N-lauroylsarcosine, 0.2 m EDTA, 1 mg/ml proteinase K) buffer and incubation for 30–45 min at 65 °C in a water bath. Overnight treatment of cell lysate with RNase PLUS (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO) at 37 °C adequately removed contaminating yeast RNA from the sample. Isolation of the DNA fraction was achieved through two successive organic extractions with an equal volume of 50:50 phenol/chloroform, followed by 3–4 extractions of the aqueous phase with chloroform only. YAC and yeast DNA were co-precipitated from the aqueous phase with 0.1 volumes of 3m NaCl and 2.5 volumes of ice-cold 100% ethanol. After gentle spooling, the precipitated DNA was washed in 70% ethanol and air-dried. Purified DNA was resuspended in TE buffer, pH 8.0, with a typical preparation yielding 300–700 mg of nucleic acid as measured byA 260 measurement. Due to the nature of the sequences being amplified, the PCR technology used in an experiment was adapted to each DNA target and template. Reaction components were used in amounts and concentrations as recommended by the manufacturer unless otherwise noted. Suggested annealing temperatures for each PCR kit were adjusted based on the sequence identity of the amplification primers and the sequence composition of the amplification target with the assistance of Oligo 4.0 (Molecular Biology Insights, Inc., Cascade, CO) primer design software. Reactions were cycled 30–35 times unless otherwise specified. For PCR amplification of simple target DNAs (i.e. <5 kb with moderate to low GC content) AmpliTaq DNA polymerase enzyme and buffers (PerkinElmer Life Sciences/Applied Biosystems) were used. GC-rich regions of ICA1 sequence from human genomic, YAC, and BAC DNA samples were amplified using reagents from the Advantage GC Genomic PCR kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), whereas the Advantage GC cDNA Enzyme (Clontech) facilitated amplification of GC-rich plasmid inserts and cDNA templates generated for 5′-RACE analysis. In cases of long PCR (>5 kb), or when other PCR methods failed, the eLONGase long PCR enzyme mix (Invitrogen) was employed. Oligonucleotides were synthesized in the DNA Sequencing and Synthesis Core Facilities of the Diabetes Institute, Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. PCR primers designed from theICA1 exon 2 intron-exon boundary sequences were used to screen the Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH) Mega-YAC Human DNA Library by systematic amplification of YAC clone DNA pools (primer sequences: 5′-CCTGGGACTTACAGGATCGA-3′ and 5′-GACAGCAATAAAGAGCTCAC-3′, annealing temperature 55 °C, 178-bp PCR product). The California Institute of Technology BAC Library (CITB Release IV, Research Genetics, Inc., Pasadena, CA) was similarly screened using a PCR approach. The PCR amplimer used for BAC library screening was a microsatellite (CA repeat) centered 1830 bp upstream of the ICA1 translation initiation codon (primer sequences: 5′-TATGAAACAGTGTTATTCTGGACCT-3′ and 5′-GTACAGTATAGTAGTGCTAACA-3′, annealing temperature 55 °C, 540-bp PCR product). Stab vials or frozen aliquots of each PCR-positive YAC and BAC library clone identified through screening were obtained, and purified DNA extracted from their respective cultures was retested under PCR conditions similar to those used for library screening to verify that the targetICA1 sequences were present. If necessary, amplified products from GenomeWalker-PCR, RT-PCR, and 5′-RACE experiments were gel-purified using the Qiagen Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen) before subcloning, or they were subcloned by direct ligation of an aliquot of the PCR. The gel-purified or neat PCRs were subcloned into the pCR 2.1 vector (Original TA Cloning Kit, Invitrogen). When PCR primers were designed to include restriction sites, they were digested with the appropriate restriction enzyme(s) and ligated into an overhang-compatible aliquot of the pGL3 basic luciferase reporter vector. All ligation reac-competent Escherichia coli(Invitrogen) and plated on 100-mm LB agar plates containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin or kanamycin and 50 μg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) for blue-white color selection of transformants (if applicable). In situations where T/A PCR product ligation proved to be inefficient because of 3′→ 5′-exonuclease activity from the PCR enzyme or enzyme mix used for amplification, the PCR product(s) were “tailed” with dA-overhangs prior to ligation. Briefly, 1 unit of AmpliTaqDNA polymerase was added to the completely cycled PCRs, incubated for 15 min at 37 °C, and immediately extracted with an equal volume of phenol/chloroform. The tailed products were then ethanol-precipitated, resuspended in a small volume (∼½ of original reaction volume), and directly used in the T/A ligation step. The FirstChoice RLM-RACE Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) was used for RNA ligase-mediated (RLM) RACE analysis of ICA1 transcripts, because it permits selective amplification of capped RNA molecules from non-poly(A)-selected RNA. Briefly, total cellular RNA is treated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase to remove the 5′-phosphate group from uncapped mRNA precursors, tRNA, rRNA, and small nuclear RNA molecules, followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and recovery of the dephosphorylated RNA by ethanol precipitation. Dephosphorylated RNA is then incubated with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase to remove m7Gpp from the cap structure of the 5′ end of capped RNAs, leaving a single 5′-terminal phosphate group. Ligation of a synthetic RNA adapter of known sequence to the calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase- and tobacco acid pyrophosphatase-treated RNA proceeds in the presence of E. coli RNA ligase. Adapter-ligated RNA is reverse-transcribed into cDNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase enzyme in the presence of random decamer primers. The resultant single-stranded cDNA then serves as template in nested PCRs using adapter sequence-specific primers (provided with the RLM-RACE kit) and gene-specific primers (GSP1 and GSP2) designed from ICA1 exons 1 and 2. The sequences of these latter primers are as follows: GSP1 (antisense exon 2), 5′-TGCATCTTATTTACAACTGACTTATCTTGA G-3′ and GSP2 (antisense exon 1/2 boundary), 5′-TGTAAGTCCCAGGGATAACTGCATTTGTGT CCTGA-3′. The Advantage GC cDNA enzyme was used in all nested RLM-RACE PCRs. To clone segments of the ICA1 5′-flanking region and UTR exons, a 1028-bp genomic segment spanning the entire region was amplified from CITB-503D2 DNA via PCR, followed by T/A ligation of the product into the pCR2.1 vector (amplification primers, 5′-TAGGAAGCAGCTATGCCAACACT-3′ and 5′-CAGAGAAGGCAGCTCCTACCA-3′). Excision of various segments of the cloned PCR product using pairs of restriction endonucleases recognizing sites found in the pCR2.1 vector arms, internal restriction sites of the insert, or a combination of the two allowed for directional cloning of defined ICA1 sequences into a pGL3 Basic vector having compatible overhangs. A second strategy for cloning ICA1sequences into pGL3 Basic involved the design ofICA1-specific primers with restriction endonuclease sites added at the 5′ end. After spin column chromatography purification of a PCR product amplified with these primers, the product was digested with one or more restriction enzymes to create overhangs compatible with those generated on an aliquot of the pGL3 Basic vector. Heat inactivation and gel purification or spin column purification of the digested PCR product was then followed by ligation into pGL3 Basic. Two pGL3 promoter reporter constructs, ExA −957 and ExB −440, were modified using the QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX) to introduce mutations at suspected key sites within these promoters. Sequence mutations were introduced to the Sp1/GC box, Inr, (Sp1/GC box + Inr), and CREB sites within ExA −957 using the following oligonucleotides, respectively (mutant name and bases mutated are in boldface and in parentheses): 5′-CCTGCCGGAGAGCAGGGtattGGTCACTCTGGGCGGCG (ExA-GC, −564 to −561), 5′-CGGAGAGCAGGGGCGGGGTggaggTGGGCGGCGGATCCG (ExA-Inr, −557 to −553), 5′-CCTGCCGGAGAGCAGGGtattGGTggaggTGGGCGGCGGATCCGAGC (ExA-GC/Inr, mutations of −564 to −561 and −557 to −553), and 5′-CCTGTCCGCCAGGTCATcggcACGCAAACGCTATGGCCACGTGG (ExA-CREB, −612 to −609). For the ExB −440 construct, the Sp1/GC box and CREB sites were modified with the following oligonucleotides, respectively: 5′-CCGGTTCCTGCGCTCCCCaataCCCTTTCCCTCGCCTTCG (ExB-GC, −196 to −193) and 5′-CCCTTTCCCTCGCCTTCGatccACGCTGACGTCGGATGAGTG (ExB-CREB, −174 to −171). The mutation strategy of the QuikChange protocol was adhered to for all site-directed mutation reactions, using the above oligonucleotides in combination with a reverse complement sequence primer in each PCR-based mutagenesis reaction. After digestion of the reactions with DpnI to remove non-mutated, methylated DNA, each mutated plasmid reaction was used to transform XL1-Blue supercompetent cells. Resultant colonies were then miniprepped and screened via automated fluorescent sequencing for successful mutation incorporation. For luciferase transfection experiments, NMB7 and RIN 1046-38 cells were plated at a density of 0.8 × 105 cells/well of a 12-well plate the day before transfection. Growth in the appropriate complete medium for 20–24 h generally resulted in 50–70% cellular confluence in each well at the time of transfection. Transient transfection of luciferase constructs and mutants thereof into the various cultured cell lines using Effectene Transfection Reagent (Qiagen) was followed by incubation of the transfected cells at 37 °C and cellular lysis 35–45 h after transfection. Luminescence assays of cellular lysates allowed for a semi-quantitative measure of luciferase production driven by each cloned segment of the ICA1 5′-flanking region. Within a given assay, plate wells were set up in triplicate for each transfected construct or control vector. The amount of DNA transfected was held constant for each construct and cell line, with a total amount 0.3 μg/well of a 12-well plate. Each Effectene reagent was used in the amount recommended by the manufacturer's protocol in proportion to the amount of DNA applied to each well. The strength of the promoting activity for each construct was assessed by comparison to basal luciferase expression from the promoterless pGL3 Basic vector transfected into triplicate samples of the same cell type within the same assay. To allow for normalization of firefly luciferase values based on transfection efficiency, a co-reporter vector expressingRenilla luciferase from the thymidine kinase promoter (pRL-TK) was included at a ratio of 1:10 of co-reporter plasmid to experimental promoter construct (or control vector) in the transfection mixture. Careful optimization of transfection conditions to maximize transfection efficiency provided an assay system yielding consistent results from repeated experiments. Transfected cells were lysed by adding 100 μl of Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) to each well of a 12-well plate, followed by vigorous pipetting of the detached cells. Cell lysates were subjected to two freeze-thaw cycles (liquid N2 and 20 °C H2O) and either immediately assayed for luciferase activity or stored at −70 °C for analysis the following day. Firefly andRenilla luciferase activities of each lysate were measured sequentially via manual reagent injection in a Monolight 2010 luminometer using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). In order to compare inter-construct firefly (FF) luciferase activity values, the raw data relative light unit (RLU) readings were corrected by normalizing each sample according to transfection efficiency. OneRenilla luciferase RLU (R-RLU) measurement from the pGL3 Basic control transfectant samples in a given experiment was selected and used to normalize each measured FF luciferase value as follows: ((normalizing R-RLU) ÷ (sample R-RLU)) × (sample FF-RLU) = (Nml sample FF activity). The normalized (Nml) triplicate values for each construct were then averaged to arrive at a relative measure of luciferase activity for that ICA1promoter reporter construct. Fold increases in promoter activity over the pGL3 Basic vector were calculated from the following formula: (Avg Nml sample FF activity) ÷ (Avg Nml pGL3 Basic control) = (sample fold increased activity over pGL3 Basic); where Avg is average. These calculations were performed independently for each transfection experiment data set (n = 3–5), and the average of all results obtained for a given ICA1 promoter reporter construct was used as a measure of relative promoter strength. Where indicated, statistical analysis of luciferase reporter data was performed using the Mann-Whitney U test. All oligonucleotides used as primers in the various PCR-based methods were synthesized on an ABI 394 DNA Synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) using solid phase synthesis and phosphoramidite nucleoside chemistry, unless a primer was provided with a particular molecular biology kit.

We found that MAIDS progression was severely retarded in IL-15 transgenic (Tg) mice constructed with cDNA encoding secretable IL-15 under the control of an MHC class I promoter. Several immune defects, including impaired natural killer activity, depressed IFN-gamma production by T cells stimulated with anti-T cell receptor cross-linking, and increased susceptibility to Mycobacterium bovis infection, were prevented in IL-15 Tg mice inoculated with LP-BM5 MuLV. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte response to a highly antigenic 10-mer peptide encoded by LP-BM5-defective virus gag p12 gene was detected in the spleen and peritoneal exudate cells from IL-15 Tg mice infected with LP-BM5 MuLV. Intramuscular injection of cDNA encoding secretable IL-15 also prevented the development of MAIDS. These results indicate that IL-15 prevents the progression of MAIDS and may provide insight into an immunotherapeutic approach using the IL-15 gene for controlling retrovirus-induced immunodeficiency."

It displays hydrolytic activity on acyl phosphates, nucleoside di- and triphosphates, aryl phosphate monoesters, and polynucleotides, with acyl phosphates being the most specific substrates in vitro.

Several reports indicate that ACP is involved in controlling membrane ion pumps (Refs. 1Nediani C. Marchetti E. Nassi P. Liguri G. Ramponi G. Biochem.

The fact that ACP is able to bind sarco-/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (3Cecchi C. Liguri G. Pieri A. Degl'Innocenti D. Nediani C. Fiorillo C. Nassi P. Ramponi G. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 211: 95-102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is in line with the preceding hypothesis. Other reports note the involvement of ACP in cell differentiation and apoptosis (4Berti A.

In this article we demonstrate that human CT acylphosphatase catalyzes the hydrolysis of aryl phosphates displaying a different mechanism from the one it uses for acyl phosphate hydrolysis. Forp-nitrophenyl phosphate hydrolysis, we found that the enzyme uses His-25 to perform a nucleophilic catalysis step, which, by contrast, it does not use in the catalytic hydrolysis of acyl phosphates. Benzoyl phosphate was synthesized as described previously (13Camici G. Manao G. Cappugi G. Ramponi G. Experientia. 1976; 32: 535Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The aryl phosphate monoesters 4-cyano and 3-chloro were synthesized as dicycloexylammonium salts in accordance with Zhang and Van Etten (14Zhang Z.Y. Van Etten R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1516-1525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas p-nitrophenyl phosphate, phenyl phosphate, β-naphtyl phosphate, andl-tyrosine phosphate where purchased from Sigma. [18O]water at 97% isotope enrichment was purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories. All other reagents were the purest commercially available grade. wild-type human CT-ACP was produced and purified as previously described (15Fiaschi T. Raugei G. Marzocchini R. Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Ramponi G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The H25Q mutant of CT-ACP was obtained by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis using a unique site elimination (USE) mutagenesis kit based on the USE method developed by Deng and Nickoloff (16Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing according to Sanger et al. (17Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar) and by amino acid analysis of the purified proteins. Benzoylphosphatase activity was assayed using a continuous optical test in accordance with Ramponi et al. (18Ramponi G. Treves C. Guerritore A. Experientia. 1966; 22: 705-706Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The hydrolytic activity on aryl phosphates was in general assayed as follows: substrates were dissolved in 1 ml of 0.1 m acetate buffer, pH 5.3, containing 1 mm EDTA (Buffer 1). The mixture was incubated at 37 °C and after the addition of the enzyme, aliquots were taken at different times to assay the released Pi by the method of Baginskiet al. (19Baginski E.S. Foa P.P. Zak B. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1967; 15: 155-158Crossref Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The p-nitrophenyl phosphatase activity was assayed at 37 °C; pNPP was dissolved in Buffer 1 at the final volume of 1 ml. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 4 ml of 0.1 m KOH, and the released p-nitrophenolate ion was measured at 400 nm (ε = 18,000m−1cm−1). An orthophosphoric acid solution (100 mmfinal concentration) was adjusted to pH 5.3 with NaOH. Then, 25 μl were withdrawn and transferred to a small screw-cap conical vial and dried. The residue was dissolved in 25 μl of [18O]water, and 1 μl of human CT-ACP (0.28 g/liter) was added. The mixture was incubated at room temperature. Aliquots of 2 μl were withdrawn at varying incubation times and diluted with water to 100 μl in order to perform MS analyses. To verify the performance of the method, a parallel experiment with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase was carried out (in this experiment, the pH of the incubation mixture (25 μl) was adjusted to 9.0, and 0.14 units of alkaline phosphatase were added (the unit is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of 1 μmol of pNPP at 25 °C and pH 9.0)). Electrospray mass spectra in negative ion mode were obtained under the following conditions: ion spray voltage, 2.2 kV; nozzle potential, 120 V; quadrupole DC potential, 8.5 V; quadrupole rf potential, 350 V. Analyzer settings: push pulse potential, 770 V; pull pulse potential, 250 V; pull bias potential, 11.5 V; acceleration potential, 4 kV; reflector potential, 1.5 kV; detector potential, 2.05 kV. Scan range m/z, 60–300; scan rate, 8 ms/atomic mass. The ability of ACP to catalyze phosphate transfer was verified by partition experiments using two different substrates, pNPP and benzoyl phosphate. Wild-type enzyme was added to Buffer 1 solution containing pNPP or, alternatively, benzoyl phosphate either in the presence or absence of 1 mglycerol, a nucleophile that may compete with water in attacking the phosphorus atom of the hypothesized E-P covalent intermediate (see Scheme FS1). At the appropriate times, aliquots of the mixtures were drawn off, and measurements were taken of the quantities of Pi and pNP or Pi and benzoate released. The overall rates of substrate turnovers (hydrolysis plus substrate transfer) were measured by the quantity of pNP or benzoate (from pNPP or benzoyl phosphate, respectively) produced, whereas the hydrolysis rates were measured by the quantity of inorganic phosphate produced. TableI shows that, in the absence of glycerol, the hydrolysis rates of pNPP or benzoyl phosphate, determined by the pNP or benzoate assays, were very close to those determined by the phosphate assays. In the presence of 1 m glycerol, we observed an increase in pNPP but not of benzoyl phosphate overall turnover. Table I shows the molar ratios of pNP/Pi produced by the ACP catalysis; at pH 5.3 and 6.5 they were, respectively, 0.97 and 0.94 in water, and 1.77 and 1.97 in 1 m glycerol. TableI also shows the results of experiments carried out with benzoyl phosphate; at pH 5.3, we found the benzoate/Pi molar ratio in water to be 1.01 and, in the water-glycerol mixture, 0.96, whereas at pH 6.5, we found it to be 1.0 in water and 0.97 in 1 mglycerol.Table IPartition experiments with wild-type and H25Q mutant of CT acylphosphatasepH 5.3pH 6.5B-P wtpNPP wtpNPP H25QB-P wtpNPP wtpNPP H25QRate of R-OH production1-aValues are expressed as μmol/min/mg of protein. in water98160.5670.10326620.5630.104 in 1 mglycerol93691.1660.14224341.1140.129Rate of phosphate production1-aValues are expressed as μmol/min/mg of protein. in water97570.5840.10726560.6020.101 in 1mglycerol97720.6600.15625180.5650.126Rate of phosphate transfer1-aValues are expressed as μmol/min/mg of protein.00.506000.5490[R-OH]/[phosphate] in water1.010.970.961.000.941.03 in 1m glycerol0.961.770.910.971.971.02Transfer/hydrolysis ratio00.77000.970Experiments were performed at 37 °C in 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.3, and 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 6.5.

On measuring the fluorescence emission spectra of ACP at varying concentration of glycerol, we found that a higher glycerol concentration causes both a small drop of the signal and a small red-shift of the tryptophan emission band (Fig. 1 A). ΔF increases hyperbolically in the range 0–0.2m glycerol, suggesting that ACP binds glycerol. In the range 0–0.32 m glycerol, data fit well to the following equation (Fig. 1 B), ΔF=ΔFmax[Gly­OH]KG+[Gly­OH]Equation 1 where KG is the dissociation constant of the enzyme-glycerol complex, ΔF max is the maximum value of ΔF, and Gly-OH indicates glycerol. This enables us to calculate a KG value of 17 ± 1 mm. The plot of k cat/K m against glycerol concentration (Fig. 1 C) also shows hyperbolic behavior. Data fitting to the following equation (Fig. 1 C),kcatKm=K′[Gly­OH]KG+[Gly­OH]Equation 2 where K′ is the size of the hyperbolic increase ofk cat/K m due to glycerol binding and KG indicates the dissociation constant of the enzyme-glycerol complex, givesKG = 15 ± 4 mm, a value close to that calculated from fluorescence. To assess the effect of glycerol on k cat, we derived the overall k cat of pNPP turnover from Scheme FS1 (20Fersht, A. (ed) (1999) Structure and Mechanism in Protein Sciences, p.216-244, W. H. Freeman and Co., New YorkGoogle Scholar, 21Zhao Y., Wu, L. Noh S.J. Guan K.L. Zhang Z.Y. J. Biol.

Thus, the data fit Equation 5 quite well,kcat(obs)=k″[Gly­OH]KG+[Gly­OH]+(k3+k4[Gly­OH])Equation 5 where k“ is the size of the hyperbolic increase ofk cat caused by glycerol binding,KG is the dissociation constant of the enzyme-glycerol complex, and k 4 is the rate constant for alcoholysis of E-P (Scheme FS1). From thek cat data we calculate aKG of 74 ± 15 mm, a value that is about 5-fold higher than that calculated from the data of fluorescence and k cat/K m. Considering that k cat/K m is the apparent second-order constant for the reaction of free enzyme and free substrate and that k cat is the first order kinetic constant for the hydrolysis of the E-P covalent complex, the difference in the value of KGindicates that the free enzyme binds glycerol more strongly than theE-P complex does. The second-order rate constant (k 4) for phosphotransfer and the E-P hydrolysis constant (k 3) can be determined from Equation 5 (Fig. 1 D). We found that k 4 = 0.10 ± 0.01 m−1s−1 andk 3 = 0.11 ± 0.01 s−1. The ratio of the rate of phosphotransfer (k 4) to the rate of hydrolysis (k 3′ =k 3/[H2O] (Scheme FS1) is 50.5. This value, compared with those of other phosphatases forming E-P covalent intermediates in their catalytic pathways (21Zhao Y., Wu, L. Noh S.J. Guan K.L. Zhang Z.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5484-5492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), indicates a moderate tendency of ACP to catalyze phosphotransfer. The results of the fluorimetry experiments performed at low glycerol concentration demonstrate that glycerol interacts with the enzyme causing a hyperbolic increase of the overall activity. Nevertheless, at glycerol concentrations above 0.2 m, the linear increase of activity agrees with the fact that alcoholysis competes with hydrolysis for the E-P breakdown (Scheme FS1). Enzyme-catalyzed 18O exchange between Pi and water was observed in a number of enzyme such as acid and alkaline phosphatases, ATPases, low Mrphosphotyrosine protein phosphatase, and the catalytic domain of leukocyte antigen-related phosphotyrosine protein phosphatase (Ref. 22Zhang Z.Y. Malachowski W.P. Van Etten R.L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8140-8145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholarand citations therein). All of these enzymes indeed form a phosphoenzyme in their pathways. 18O exchange is therefore a convenient technique for tracing E-P covalent complex formation in an enzymatic pathway. Human CT-ACP is able to catalyze the inorganic phosphate-H218O oxygen exchange reaction (Fig. 2). Experiments were performed at 25 °C and pH 5.3. MS spectra of control samples to which no enzyme was added confirm that the spontaneous exchange reaction was negligible (Fig. 2 E). Fig. 2, A–C, shows the MS spectra of the mixtures containing wild-type ACP measured at 25, 49, and 76 h and demonstrates that the enzyme is able to catalyze the time-dependent incorporation of18O atoms into phosphate when incubated with unlabeled Pi and H218O in the absence ofp-nitrophenol. All possible isotopomers are clearly present after 76 h of incubation. Taking into account the preceding results, we deduce that, in the presence of the enzyme and in the absence of phenols, the inorganic phosphate-H218O oxygen exchange can occur only if an E-P covalent intermediate is formed and then hydrolyzed by cycling the two terminal steps in the overall catalytic process shown in Scheme FS2.Figure FS2The overall catalytic pathway of aryl phosphate monoester hydrolysis by human CT-ACP.

Crowder M.W. Averill B.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 105-110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). This experiment, which shows the rapid incorporation of all oxygen isotopomers into phosphate, is a good control on the performance of the technique used here. The initial rates for the ACP-catalyzed hydrolysis of six aryl phosphates differing in the leaving group pKa values (phenyl phosphate, 4-cyanophenyl phosphate, 3-chlorophenyl phosphate, 4-nitrophenyl phosphate, β-naphthyl phosphate, andl-phosphotyrosine) were determined. Measurements were performed at pH 5.3 and 37 °C using the concentration range 0.05–3.2 mm for all substrates tested. The V max and K m values were obtained by solving the Michaelis-Menten equationv = V max[S]/(K m + [S]) by nonlinear regression analysis with the aid of a computer program (Fig. P, BioSoft). We examined the effect of the leaving group pKa(pKa range, 7.14–10.07) onk cat andk cat/K m regarding the aryl phosphatase activity of ACP (Brønsted correlation). These free energy relationships provide information about the rate-limiting step of the catalytic process and the nature of the transition state. Fig. 3 shows the Brønsted plots that correlate, respectively, k cat andk cat/K m values to the pKa values of the substrate leaving group. The left side of this figure shows the findings of earlier experiments onk cat andk cat/K m dependence on the leaving group of seven acyl phosphates (24Paoli P. Cirri P. Camici L. Manao G. Cappugi G. Moneti G. Pieraccini G. Camici G. Ramponi G. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), whereas the right side shows the results obtained here for k cat andk cat/K m dependence on the leaving group pKa of six aryl phosphates. For aryl phosphates, we found that the dependence of both logk cat and logk cat/K m on the leaving group pKa are monophasic (Fig. 3, right). By fitting the data to the linear equationslogkcat=β1gpKXOH+constantEquation 6 orlogkcat/Km=β1gpKXOH+constantEquation 7 where pK is the pKa of the leaving group XOH, we calculated, respectively, the β1gvalues for k cat (–0.07 ± 0.02) andk cat/K m (– 0.20 ± 0.11). The very small dependence of k cat andk cat/K m on the leaving group pKa for aryl phosphates contrasts with the strong dependence of k cat andk cat/K m on the leaving group pKa for acyl phosphates (β1g = −1.38 ± 0.14, and β1g = −1.44 ± 0.22, respectively (see left side of Fig. 3, which shows data for the strictly homologous bovine enzyme; taken from Paoli et al. (24Paoli P. Cirri P. Camici L. Manao G. Cappugi G. Moneti G. Pieraccini G. Camici G. Ramponi G. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar)). For aryl phosphates, the small dependence ofk cat on the structures of leaving group, which differ markedly in the pKa (7.14 for 4-nitrophenyl phosphate and 10.07 for phosphotyrosine) indicates that the k cat values for various aryl phosphates are very close to each other, suggesting that a common intermediate complex is formed and accumulated before the limiting step of the catalytic process takes place. No such accumulation of intermediate complex can be seen from the data relative to the hydrolysis of acyl phosphates catalyzed by the bovine CT-ACP (24Paoli P. Cirri P. Camici L. Manao G. Cappugi G. Moneti G. Pieraccini G. Camici G. Ramponi G. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), which is about 90% identical in sequence with the human CT acylphosphatase. Previous experiments have demonstrated that human CT-ACP was inactivated by the Woodward reagent K, which reacts specifically with His-25 located in the active site region, even though the enzyme contains other histidine residues and also several acidic residues that are potential targets for this reagent (25Paoli P. Fiaschi T. Cirri P. Camici G. Manao G. Cappugi G. Raugei G. Moneti G. Ramponi G. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 855-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This finding revealed a very reactive nucleophile in the active site region. We thus performed partition experiments with the H25Q mutant of human CT-ACP in the presence and absence of 1 m glycerol. Table I shows that the mutation of His-25 to Gln eliminates the enzyme capacity to catalyze the phosphotransfer reaction. Interestingly, as observed in the wild-type ACP, 1 m glycerol enhances the activity of the H25Q mutant (by ∼40% at pH 5.3 and ∼25% at pH 6.5), suggesting that the presence of glycerol also causes structural modifications to occur in this mutant. Furthermore, Fig. 2 Dshows that the mutation of His-25 to Gln in ACP causes a strong decrease in the catalytic rate of the inorganic phosphate-H218O oxygen exchange reaction. Taken together, all of these results suggest that His-25 is involved in the formation of an enzyme phosphohistidine intermediate during the catalytic hydrolysis of pNPP. Our results show evidence that human CT acylphosphatase catalyzes the hydrolysis of aryl phosphate monoesters by a mechanism that involves a nucleophilic catalysis step. On the contrary, no nucleophilic catalysis occurs in the enzymatic hydrolysis of acyl phosphates. We obtained consistent proof of our conclusions. First, the results obtained by kinetic experiments performed at both pH 5.3 and 6.5 in the presence and absence of glycerol suggest that anE-P covalent intermediate is formed during the catalytic hydrolysis of pNPP but not of benzoyl phosphate (see Table I). These findings also suggest that the hydrolysis of E-P is the limiting step of pNPP hydrolysis by CT-ACP. In fact, if the rate-limiting step is the formation of E-P (Scheme FS1) and the acceptor reacts with the intermediate after the rate-limiting step, it does not increase the overall rate of pNPP breakdown. Only if the rate-limiting step is the hydrolysis of E-P, will the addition of the acceptor nucleophile increase the breakdown of the intermediate and hence enhance the overall reaction rate (14Zhang Z.Y. Van Etten R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1516-1525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Fersht, A. (ed) (1999) Structure and Mechanism in Protein Sciences, p.216-244, W. H. Freeman and Co., New YorkGoogle Scholar). Furthermore, the results of experiments performed at increasing glycerol concentrations (range, 0.2–1 m) agree with the model described in Scheme FS1 and Equation 4; this model assumes that an E-P covalent intermediate is formed in the catalytic pathway of aryl phosphate hydrolysis. In the 0–0.2 mglycerol concentration range, fluorescence spectroscopy shows that glycerol interacts with the enzyme and enhances its activity (see Fig1). We also demonstrate that the mutation of His-25 to Gln completely eliminates the capacity of the enzyme to catalyze the transphosphorylation from pNPP to glycerol (Table I) demonstrating that His-25 is involved in the nucleophilic catalysis step. The second proof derives from the results obtained by experiments with inorganic phosphate-H218O oxygen exchange. These also demonstrate that an E-P covalent intermediate is formed in the catalytic pathway (Fig. 2). Indeed, the inorganic phosphate-H218O oxygen exchange can occur only if an E-P covalent intermediate is formed and is hydrolyzed by cycling the two terminal step in the overall catalytic process shown in Scheme FS2. The mutation of His-25 to Gln eliminates the capacity of the enzyme to catalyze the inorganic phosphate-H218O oxygen exchange (Fig. 2 D), suggesting that a phosphohistidine is involved in the process. The third proof comes from the Brønsted free energy relationship experiments. For different aryl phosphates, the Brønsted plot of kcat versus the leaving group pKa shows effectively constantk cat values (Fig. 3, right), indicating that a common intermediate is formed before the rate-limiting step of the catalytic pathway (see Scheme FS1). The slope of the curve is slightly negative, giving a β1g value close to zero (–0.07). This value indicates that a very low amount of negative charge develops on the leaving group oxygen in the transition state. A flat leaving group dependence suggests two hypotheses: either the protonation of the leaving group occurs at the transition state by general acid catalysis, or alternatively, the hydrolysis step that leads to the release of phosphate is not rate-limiting. The latter hypothesis is ruled out because CT-ACP is able to catalyze transphosphorylation from pNPP to glycerol; only if theE-P covalent complex (Scheme FS1) accumulates before the rate-limiting step can the addition of a nucleophile (glycerol) competing with water increase the overall substrate breakdown (TableI). In contrast with the results on aryl phosphates, previous findings on acyl phosphates (24Paoli P. Cirri P. Camici L. Manao G. Cappugi G. Moneti G. Pieraccini G. Camici G. Ramponi G. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the structure of the acyl group can have a dramatic effect on the rate of CT-ACP catalysis (β1g value of −1.38). The difference of 1.34 units of the leaving group pKa for acetyl phosphate (4.75) and p-nitrobenzoyl phosphate (3.41) leads to a 50-fold enhancement of k cat forp-nitrobenzoyl phosphate versus acetyl phosphate (24Paoli P. Cirri P. Camici L. Manao G. Cappugi G. Moneti G. Pieraccini G. Camici G. Ramponi G. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Considering both substrate types (acyl phosphates and aryl phosphates), a break in the leaving group dependence (see Fig. 3) is usually attributed to a change in either the mechanism or the rate-limiting step. The results of our experiments support the former. Indeed, the earlier model for the hydrolysis mechanism of acyl phosphates by CT-ACP, based on x-ray crystallography data, does not include any step of nucleophilic catalysis (12Thunnissen M.M.G.M. Taddei N. Liguri G. Ramponi G. Nordlund P. Structure. 1997; 5: 69-79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The mechanism proposed by Thunnissen et al. (12Thunnissen M.M.G.M. Taddei N. Liguri G. Ramponi G. Nordlund P. Structure. 1997; 5: 69-79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) also agrees with our results because we observed no transphosphorylation from benzoyl phosphate to glycerol, consistent with the absence of any E-P covalent intermediate in the catalytic pathway of acyl phosphate hydrolysis. Collectively, all of our findings suggest that CT-ACP-catalyzed hydrolyses of the two kinds of substrates follow two different pathways (as shown in Scheme FS3). For acyl phosphates, a nucleophilic water molecule attacks the Michaelis complex directly, producing Pi and the carboxylate anion. On the contrary, for aryl phosphates, the nucleophilic His-25 attacks the phosphorus atom of the substrate in the Michaelis complex, phosphorylating the enzyme. The hydrolysis of theE-P covalent complex concludes the process and is rate-limiting. The difference among the two mechanisms could depend on the fact that the carboxylate anion is a better leaving group than the phenolate anion. For acyl phosphates, this may favor the formation of a strongly dissociative transition state in the limiting step (as indicated by the strong dependence of k cat on the leaving group pKa; see Fig. 3,left), which is efficiently stabilized by the active site environment. This conclusion is supported by previous findings obtained for the strictly homologous bovine CT-ACP (about 90% sequence identity), which show that the formation of the transition state during benzoyl phosphate hydrolysis is accompanied by a strong reduction in the entropy of the hydrated enzyme-transition state complex compared with that of the hydrated enzyme-substrate Michaelis complex (24Paoli P. Cirri P. Camici L. Manao G. Cappugi G. Moneti G. Pieraccini G. Camici G. Ramponi G. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The binding of ACP to pNPP is not influenced by the H25Q mutation; at pH 5.3 we found a K m = 1.03 ± 0.13 mm for the mutant and a K m = 1.10 ± 0.04 mm for the wild-type enzyme. In contrast, the binding of ACP to benzoyl phosphate is significantly affected by the His-25 mutation; at pH 5.3, we found K m = 0.55 ± 0.03 mm for the mutant and K m = 0.16 ± 0.01 mm for the wild-type enzyme. Furthermore, the mutation H25Q causes a significant decrease in the specificity constant k cat/K m for both pNPP and benzoyl phosphate. These findings indicate that His-25 is involved in the catalysis of both kinds of substrates, although the results reported in this study suggest that this residue plays different roles in the two different pathways. These and other findings, such as the observation that aryl phosphates behave as competitive inhibitors with respect to acyl phosphates (data not shown), collectively demonstrate that the enzyme possesses a unique active site. The unusual behavior of CT-ACP with regard to the mechanism of hydrolysis of two different kinds of substrates could be related to the strongly different chemical properties of the leaving groups (carboxylate and phenolate), which favor the formation of different transition states in the respective chemical steps of the catalytic hydrolysis processes. Results from the Brønsted analysis of acylphosphatase-catalyzed reactions (Fig. 3) clearly indicate a change in the nature of the transition state with a change the nature of the substrates. We think that for acyl phosphates, the intrinsic high stability of the carboxylate anion leaving group in the transition state is the driving force of the hydrolytic reaction, whereas for aryl phosphate monoesters a proton must be donated to the leaving group in the transition state for a productive forward reaction. Previously, we demonstrated that Woodward's reagent K (N-ethyl-5-phenylisoxazolium-3′-sulfonate) is able to form a Michaelis-like complex with human CT-ACP and then inactivate the enzyme modifying His-25 (25Paoli P. Fiaschi T. Cirri P. Camici G. Manao G. Cappugi G. Raugei G. Moneti G. Ramponi G. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 855-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Woodward's reagent K interacts with the substrate binding site by its sulfonic group moiety, as suggested by the fact that some competitive inhibitors elicit protective actions against inactivation. The chemical modification of His-25 by Woodward's reagent K is relatively fast and highly specific, because other residues in the ACP molecule were not modified (25Paoli P. Fiaschi T. Cirri P. Camici G. Manao G. Cappugi G. Raugei G. Moneti G. Ramponi G. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 855-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The fact that Woodward's reagent K, which behaves as a substrate-like compound, binds to the CT-ACP active site and reacts easily with His-25 agrees with the presence of this strongly reactive nucleophilic residue in the active site environment. In fact, His-25 is very close to Arg-23, an essential residue involved in substrate binding (12Thunnissen M.M.G.M. Taddei N. Liguri G. Ramponi G. Nordlund P. Structure. 1997; 5: 69-79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The cellular function of acylphosphatase is still under debate. In our opinion, the most interesting results on the physiological function of the enzyme in metazoan organisms are those demonstrating its capability of uncoupling the membrane ion pumps acting on the aspartyl phosphate intermediate formed during their functions. Nevertheless, the enzyme seems to be implicated in other processes such as differentiation and apoptosis (4Berti A. Degl'Innocenti D. Stefani M. Ramponi G. Arch. Biochem.

An understanding of all of the aspects of the action mechanism of acylphosphatase may help in the design and construction of specific enzyme inhibitors useful for revealing the true substrates of acylphosphatase in differing cell types and thus toward discovering its function.
