https://openalex.org/W2036104317,"Oxygen isotopic measurements in three Late Quaternary deep-sea cores from the Gulf of Mexico record a major anomaly between about 15,000 and 12,000 years ago superimposed on a more characteristic oceanic oxygen isotopic curve. This resulted from major influx of isotopically light glacial meltwater via the Mississippi River from the disintegrating Late Wisconsin Laurentide Ice Sheet 2000 kilometers to the north."

(ii) The cost of nonrenewable energy resources continue to rise, but a fixed amount of energy from continuous sources may be utilized at constant cost. In this case a lower production level may be set by the amount of energy that is available from renewable sources, and society may thus have to be reshaped with energy economization in focus. If it is possible to choose between these two alternatives, the choice should be based on a discussion of the pros and cons of each one, and in particular on the desirability of having to process an increasing fraction of the earth's crust in search of raw materials in order to maintain growth as long as possible. However, the availability, of the first option is far from certain and it thus seems reasonable to plan for the second alternative. I have tried to propose such a plan for a small, homogeneous geographical region, namely Denmark. The ceiling on the consumption of energy from continuous sources is chosen in accordance with the criterion of not having to convert a major part of the land area to energy-collecting systems. The proposed annual average energy consumption of 19 gigawatts by the year 2050 corresponds to solar energy collecting panels (in use only 50 percent of the time) with an area of roughly 180 square kilometers and a windmill swept area of about 150 square kilometers. These (vertical) areas constitute less than 1 percent of the total land area. The selection of solar or wind energy for different applications has been based on known technology and may be subject to adjustments. The project has been shown to be economically feasible according to estimates of the cost of various alternatives during the 25-year depreciation period adopted. However, the initial cost per energy unit produced is higher than that for most of the alternatives, so that action is not expected to be taken immediately as a result of purely private initiative. In a public economic evaluation, other factors must be considered in addition to the cost of energy per kilowatt-hour. At present, Denmark has over 10 percent of its labor force out of employment and a substantial deficit on its balance of payments, so that an early start on the solar and wind energy project, based on national industry, would have additional payoffs compared with energy systems based on imported technology or imported fuels. Several factories that are now being closed down as a result of the economic crisis could be adapted to the production of parts for solar or wind power systems, and the building industry, badly hit by unemployment, would receive legitimate work."

An increase in the solar nitrogen-15 content during the lifetime of the lunar regolith is probably caused by spallation of oxygen-16 in the surface regions of the sun."
https://openalex.org/W1982832196,"Studies of the trumpet creeper, Campsis radicans (L.) Seem. (Bignoniaceae), reveal five distinct nectary systems, a phenomenon never before reported among temperate zone plants. Ant activity, centered around the four extrafloral systems, clearly demonstrates the ant-guard symbiosis usually associated only with tropical or subtropical species. Floral nectar, an attractant for hummingbird and bumblebee pollinators, differs chemically from the ant-attracting nectar produced extraflorally."
https://openalex.org/W2025759630,Observations from spacecraft have revealed naturally occurring radio emission emanating from two regions near Earth. The characteristics of these two sources suggest a correlation with areas of known electron precipitation. The possibility of a similar production mechanism for observed nonthermal radio emissions from other planetary magnetospheres permits the polar magnetic field strengths of Jupiter and Saturn to be predicted.

It is proposed that these rocks were formed when hydrothermal solutions emanating from a fracture zone offsetting the active spreading center in the Lau Basin came into contact with cooler ocean waters."
https://openalex.org/W2076710055,"Our analysis of the interviews with a sample of the California public about a range of their attitudes toward technology shows that a modification of our understanding of the collective state of mind on this subject is in order. The current assessment of the public as largely, and somewhat vacantly, enamored with science and technology does not hold. Nor does a picture of a public generally hostile and alienated by technology. Neither panglossian optimism nor prophecies of doom can be supported by these interviews. Rather a more mixed picture emerges. Out of that picture, a potential public can be isolated, whose mood it behooves science policy-makers to watch. This group tends to associate a number of related conditions with technological development; moreover, it is likely to make assessments on those relationships so perceived. To the degree this group has ""antitechnological"" feelings, these feelings are clearly linked to the group's awareness that the social consequences of technology can produce conditions which threaten important values. The particular distribution of age and political identification suggests that those who are young and who identify themselves as ""liberal"" form the core of potential opposition to technological development and that such opposition is at least in part a function of different value preferences. The associations between political identification and attitudes about technology, distrust of decision-making, and concern for environmental impacts all make this point. In short, ""technological dissent"" cannot be written off as antiintellectual and without foundation. It is, in fact, preeminently sensible. What the alignments visible within the potential public portend for the future is not clear, although they do not allow us to accept an inference drawn from past studies-that because the young retain confidence in scientists and engineers all is well for the general climate of science and technology. We can only speculate whether, as these younger people grow older, they will carry their uneasiness about technology with them. Were they to do so, and were this group to be joined by still younger people who also hold these wary attitudes, the context of scientific and technological work could become much more fraught with political controversy. Another point emerging from our interpretation is how very crucial to continued free scientific inquiry is the distinction between scientific work and technological activities apparently now made by a sizable portion of the public. Should this distinction become lost, perhaps through continual merging of science's role with technology's by the popular press, attitudes now mainly associated with technology could spill over to scientific research as well. Yet our data also provide evidence of the successes of the scientific and technological communities. They have become such a critical part of life that people are seriously concerned with their future development. The opportunity is present for both communities to find ways of responding to the situation so that thoughtful action can be taken to implement technology for the benefit of the commonweal."
https://openalex.org/W2087148429,"The preliminary results from a three-dimensional dynamic-chemical model applied to the SST-NOx (NO + NO2) problem are reported. Simulations indicate that a depletion of about 12 per cent in total stratospheric O3 would be realized for a continuous NOx injection rate of 1.8 x 10 to the sixth power metric tons per year from a hypothetical fleet of SST's flying at an altitude of 20 km in the midlatitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. Sixteen per cent of the existing O3 would be destroyed on an annual basis. The model assumes a fleet of about 500 aircraft of the now-canceled American Boeing 2707 type; if only present Anglo-French and Russian SST models, which fly at lower, less harmful altitudes, are built, it will take a fleet of a few thousand such craft to attain an effective injection rate equal to the one above."

https://openalex.org/W2056721117,"Man's knowledge about air pollution and its causes is limited. Despite the laws that have been enacted to curtail emissions of potential pollutants from automobiles, for example, the role of automobile emissions in the genesis of the most severe forms of pollution, including photochemical smog, is incompletely understood, The lack of knowledge about this subject was recently illustrated by the controversy surrounding a report which concluded that in certain areas and under certain conditions, hydrocarbons released from trees and other vegetation may be more important than those released from automobiles in the initiation of smog. This possibility, which is based on very preliminary results obtained from limited data, has been sharply criticized by many investigators who have argued - largely on the basis of intuition - that the hypothesis cannot be correct. But the fact of the controversy is that there is not enough background information either to support or to refute the hypothesis."

A proposed open-cycle system uses low-pressure steam to elevate vate water, which is then run through a hydraulic turbine to generate power. The device is analogous to an air lift pump."

https://openalex.org/W2056788442,"Recent observations indicate that the rate of evaporation of elemental arsenic into a vacuum is determined by the rate of formation, at screw dislocations, of kinks in ledges of molecular height. Once formed, a kink advances along the ledge, which makes a continuous spiral ramp outward from the dislocation, until the ledge terminates. A kink advances by releasing As(4) molecules from the ledge. A given kink releases almost 10(6) As(4) molecules before the next kink is initiated."
