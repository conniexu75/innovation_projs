https://openalex.org/W1491444896,"Abstract The active species of CO2, i.e. CO2 or HCO3-, utilized in the ribulose diphosphate carboxylase reaction was determined with the use of homogeneous preparations of the spinach enzyme. Employing an assay system predicated upon the observation that the hydration of CO2 requires more than 60 sec to reach equilibrium at temperatures below 15°, data were obtained which are quite compatible with those expected if CO2 is the active species."
https://openalex.org/W1502475319,"Abstract Preparations of bovine pancreatic deoxyribonuclease obtained by the ammonium sulfate precipitation procedure of Kunitz can be further purified by chromatography on sulfoethyl-Sephadex at pH 4.70. The instability of earlier preparations of the enzyme has usually been attributed to the sensitivity of the protein to proteolytic digestion. This hypothesis has been confirmed; treatment of the starting product in the present experiments with diisopropylphosphorofluoridate inactivates contaminating proteases and leads to a stable preparation of the enzyme. Chromatography on sulfoethyl-Sephadex shows the presence of two active components which have almost identical properties. The major product is homogeneous by chromatography on hydroxylapatite at pH 6.7, by gel electrophoresis at pH 8.4, and by gel filtration on Sephadex G-75. Its amino acid composition is consistent with the molecular weight of 31,000 determined by ultracentrifugation by Lindberg. The analyses also show that the enzyme contains glucosamine and mannose and establish DNase as a glycoprotein. Lindberg's results, together with the present data, show the protein to be a single chain of about 270 residues with leucine at the NH2-terminal position and two disulfide bonds. The stabilized, purified product provides a suitable starting material for structural study. DNase can also be fully stabilized against proteolytic digestion by 5 mm Ca++; the concentration of Ca++ needed to reduce the rate of inactivation by one-half is 0.1 mm. This property may permit the enzyme to remain active in the presence of the proteases concurrently excreted by the pancreas."
https://openalex.org/W1556291384,"Abstract β-Cyanoalanine synthase, an enzyme which catalyzes the formation of β-cyanoalanine from l-cysteine and cyanide, has been isolated from the mitochondria of 10-day-old etiolated blue lupine seedlings. The enzyme can be assayed by measuring colorimetrically the sulfide that is also formed during the reaction. A partially purified fraction has been obtained with a specific activity that is 1700 times higher than that of an extract of whole seedling acetone powders. The purification procedure started with an extract of a mitochondrial acetone powder and involved the following steps: MnCl2 treatment, 0 to 80% (NH4)2SO4 precipitation, 38 to 52% (NH4)2SO4 precipitation, 50 to 75% acetone precipitation, Sephadex G-100 column chromatography, and preparative gel electrophoresis. An over-all yield of about 10% was achieved with an 140-fold increase in the specific activity over that of the initial extract of the mitochondrial acetone powder. β-Cyanoalanine synthase has a pH optimum of about 9.5 and a molecular weight of about 53,000 calculated from its elution volume on Sephadex G-100. The enzyme is stable and requires no added cofactors in the reaction mixture. The Km values for l-cysteine and cyanide are 2.5 mm and 0.55 mm, respectively, in the reaction forming β-cyanoalanine. The reverse reaction between β-cyanoalanine and sulfide does not occur under the conditions of the forward reaction. The enzyme is highly specific for l-cysteine with O-acetyl-l-serine being the only other substrate that will react with cyanide. However, the rate of β-cyanoalanine formation with O-acetyl-l-serine is only 5.4% of the rate observed with cysteine. The enzyme will also catalyze an exchange of sulfide into cysteine at one-half the rate of β-cyanoalanine formation. In addition, the purified enzyme will form cysteine from O-acetyl-l-serine and sulfide, but at only one-twenty-fifth of the rate of β-cyanoalanine formation. Methanethiol can replace cyanide as a substrate for the enzyme and in this case S-methylcysteine is formed. However the reaction rate is about one-sixth the rate of β-cyanoalanine formation with all substrates at 2.5 mm. During the purification it was also shown that O-acetylserine sulfhydrase, the enzyme that apparently synthesizes cysteine from O-acetylserine and sulfide in the blue lupine, is a soluble enzyme. This protein has an approximate molecular weight of 41,000 as judged from its elution volume on Sephadex G-100. O-Acetylserine sulfhydrase can also form β-cyanoalanine from O-acetylserine and cyanide; the rate for this reaction, however, is only one-tenth the rate of cysteine formation."
https://openalex.org/W1606288198,"Abstract During normal greening of the y-1 mutant of Chlamydomonas reinhardi, photoreductive activities with 2,6-dichloroindophenol (DCI), an assay for Photosystem II, and with methyl red (ascorbate and DCI as electron donors), an assay for Photosystem I, increased in parallel with chlorophyll. Disc membranes formed approximately in parallel with chlorophyll synthesis and fused to form grana. In the presence of 20 µg of chloramphenicol (CAP) per ml, the cells produced chlorophyll and membranes at 90% of the rate of control cells, but photoreductive activities were drastically reduced. Photoreduction of DCI and of methyl red in CAP-treated cells increased at rates only 35% and 50%, respectively, of those in control cells. Also, in CAP-treated cells the discs rarely fused to form grana. Inhibition of these activities was reversible upon removal of CAP. Chlorophyll synthesis and disc formation in cells in the presence of cycloheximide (CHI) at 1 µg per ml occurred at about one-half of the rate of control cells, but photoreductive activity with DCI and disc fusion into grana was the same as in controls on a chlorophyll basis. At concentrations of CHI above 5 µg per ml, chlorophyll synthesis was completely inhibited. The incorporation of 14C-leucine into total protein by whole cells was inhibited maximally 30 to 50% by CAP and maximally 40 to 50% by CHI; the effects of the drugs were additive. The membranes formed in the presence of CAP could be repaired by transferring the cells to a medium containing CHI (10 µg per ml). During 2 hours of subsequent incubation in light, the existing membranes gained activity until, on a chlorophyll basis, they were at least as active as the membranes formed in control cells. These results indicate that products of both the cytoplasmic and the chloroplastic protein-synthesizing systems are required for disc membrane production in the chloroplast of this alga."

Addition of calcium ions to the solution (100 millimolar sodium chloride, pH 7.0) on one side only, produces lowering of the direct-current resistance and results in breaking of the membrane. However, with calcium ions on both sides the membranes are stable and show very high electrical resistance."

https://openalex.org/W1605851000,"Abstract The activity of ribonuclease increases with increasing concentration of added divalent metal ions until the attainment of an optimal metal concentration, beyond which the addition of further metal ions inhibits the reaction. When either the optimal metal concentration or the enzymatic activity at that concentration is plotted versus the atomic number of the transition metals, the resulting curves can be correlated with the stability constants of complexes of the metals. These results are in line with metal ions reacting at two types of sites, one activating and the other inhibiting. Crystalline bovine pancreatic ribonuclease is affected in the same way as ribonuclease A. The activation of deoxyribonuclease I has been reinvestigated. Metal ions generally activate this enzyme, but the relative activating ability of the various metal ions is not readily correlated with complexing ability, as in the case of ribonuclease. Co(II) activates deoxyribonuclease I better than the metals that have generally been used for this purpose."
https://openalex.org/W1557764366,"Abstract Preceding experiments by Price and his associates establish that bovine pancreatic deoxyribonuclease is a glycoprotein which contains glucosamine and mannose. In order to determine the mode of attachment of the carbohydrate to the enzyme molecule, chromatographically purified deoxyribonuclease has been digested with Pronase. Gel filtration of the digest yielded a fraction containing all of the carbohydrate in association with a mixture of the dipeptide and tetrapeptide sequences Ser-Asp and Ser-Asp-Ala-Thr. Removal of serine by the Edman degradation demonstrated that all of the carbohydrate is in association with aspartic acid. Analyses of the glycopeptides showed 1 residue of ammonia, 2 residues of glucosamine, and 5 of mannose to be present per residue of aspartic acid. Since only 2 residues of glucosamine (assumed to occur as the N-acetyl derivative) are present in the parent molecule, it is concluded that the saccharide moiety is attached at a single position on the enzyme and through an aspartamido-hexose linkage."

https://openalex.org/W1754348470,"Abstract Inhibition of serum cholinesterase (ChE) and erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase by diisopropylphosphorofluoridate and amiton did not follow first order kinetics. Curving of the rate plots was concave upward and varied greatly. An equation was derived on the assumption that curving reflected inhibition of a multiple enzyme system. The curves obtained with partially purified horse ChE were then resolved into four linear components at 5° and into three linear components with an indication of a fourth at 25°. Similar results were obtained with human IV-6-3 ChE and bovine erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase. Each resolved component represented the first order rate plot for the inhibition of one form of ChE, indicating that four forms were present in each preparation. The phosphorylation (k2) and binding constants (Ka) of the various forms of horse and human ChE inhibited by amiton at 5° and of horse ChE inhibited by diisopropylphosphorofluoridate at 25° were obtained and were found to vary significantly. For example, the k2 values of horse ChE inhibited by amiton at 5° varied from 48.8 ± 2.2 min-1 to 0.0028 ± 0.0003 min-1 while Ka varied from 7.6 ± 1.2 x 10-6 m to 3.2 ± 1.5 x 10-7 m. Binding increased as k2 decreased with one exception. Since cholinesterases are probably agglomerates of subunits, this indicated that the kinetic properties of the various forms may differ profoundly with the state of agglomeration. However, additional results also indicated that not every inhibitor nor inhibition at every concentration is capable of bringing out these differences. The intercepts at t = 0 of the linear first order plots were independent of the inhibitor used and of its concentration and provided a criterion by which shifts in the relative concentrations of the various forms could be followed. Changes in either temperature or the ChE concentration changed the relative concentrations of the multiple forms, suggesting that they were interconvertible. With the horse ChE preparations the rates of reversibility increased by about 60-fold when the temperature was raised from 5° to 25°."
https://openalex.org/W1584906894,"The amino acid sequences of the six peptides obtained from tryptic digests of alfalfa ferredoxin were determined by chemical and enzymic degradations. The order of tryptic peptides was established from the properties of the two segments of the succinylated protein obtained by tryptic hydrolysis at the single arginyl residue. Alfalfa ferredoxin consists of a polypeptide chain of 97 residues, characterized by clusters of acidic and hydrophobic amino acids. It is suggested that this type of distribution of hydrophobic and strongly hydrophilic residues implies a low α-helical content of the native structure. Of the 5 cysteinyl residues only 2, separated by 2 serine residues, show a grouped arrangement similar to that observed in clostridial ferredoxins. Alfalfa ferredoxin differs from spinach ferredoxin at 19 residue positions. The over-all effect of these substitutions is largely conservative in terms of the total numbers of charged, hydroxy- and hydrophobic residues. Most of the variant positions are clustered in the vicinity of Ala-Ala sequences, leaving several long stretches unaltered. Comparisons of peptide segments based on minimal mutation distances indicate the occurrence of internal repetitions of similar sequences 27 and 14 residues long in alfalfa ferredoxin. A rigorous statistical comparison of alfalfa and clostridial ferredoxins demonstrates a degree of amino acid sequence similarity clearly greater than would be expected on the basis of random occurrences. Although this raises the possibility of a common evolutionary origin for all ferredoxins, without knowledge of the minimal number of invariant residues required for function, such analyses cannot conclusively prove ancestral homology."

https://openalex.org/W1483825714,"Abstract A multienzyme complex which carries out the anthranilate synthetase, N-(5'-phosphoribosyl)anthranilate isomerase and indole-3-glycerol phosphate synthetase reactions in the tryptophan pathway of Neurospora crassa has been purified and characterized. The complex, as prepared here, is a single homogeneous protein molecule having a sedimentation coefficient of 10.3 S and a molecular weight of 240,000. Sedimentation equilibrium studies in 6 m guanidine HCl and in 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate reveal that the complex consists of six 40,000 molecular weight subunits. Amino acid analysis and titration with p-chloromercuribenzoate show that the complex contains 20 sulfhydryl groups and no disulfide bridges. Titration of 12 of the sulfhydryl groups or more with p-chloromercuribenzoate leads to the quantitative dissociation of the complex into 4.4 S and 7.4 S fragments. Based on the sedimentation values, the 4.4 S fragment is a dimer and the 7.4 S fragment is a tetramer of the 40,000 molecular weight subunits. The 4.4 S fragment is itself inactive but in the presence of dithiothreitol a 7 S form of anthranilate synthetase develops as the only enzymic activity. The 7.4 S fragment on the other hand, is fully active in indole-3-glycerol phosphate synthetase and N-(5'-phosphoribosyl)anthranilate isomerase. Electrophoresis in 8 m urea shows that the 4.4 S and 7.4 S fragments consist of single but distinct polypeptides, termed here the A and the I subunits, respectively. An A2I4 model for the complex is discussed."

When investigated in the presence of Mg++, the rate of the phosphorylation and the dephosphorylation reaction was found to exceed that of the over-all reaction, indicating that the phosphorylenzyme is an intermediate in the nucleoside diphosphate kinase reaction.

https://openalex.org/W1523854601,"Abstract A soil microorganism, designated Arthrobacter GJM-1, has been isolated which is capable of growing on Saccharomyces cerevisiae mannan as the carbon source. When grown on mannan, the microorganism secretes an α-mannosidase into the cultural medium. The enzyme is not found when mannose, glucose, or glycerol is substituted for mannan, but is present when oligosaccharides obtained by acetolysis of mannan are used as carbon sources. The α-mannosidase has been isolated and partially purified. It was free of contaminating glycosidase, phosphatase, and protease activities. The enzyme is active on mannans from several different yeasts and on the oligosaccharides produced by acetolysis of yeast mannans, but has a low activity on α-mannosides with aromatic or aliphatic aglycons. This is in contrast to results obtained with other α-mannosidases and may reflect the different metabolic roles of the respective enzymes. The Km values for the di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, and hexasaccharides from S. cerevisiae mannan varied between 0.5 and 2 mm. Because of the structural heterogeneity of these oligosaccharides, it is not certain what features contribute to the differences observed. The Km value for intact mannan was 1 x 10-5 m, but this value probably reflects the higher concentration of side chains in the mannan molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1538926214,"Polynucleotide phosphorylase from Micrococcus luteus (formerly Micrococcus lysodeikticus) can be converted from a primer-independent form (Form-I) to a primer-dependent form (Form-T) by limited proteolysis with trypsin. The conversion of Form-I to Form-T is accompanied by the breaking of between five and six peptide bonds per molecule of enzyme, and results in the removal of a small portion of the peptide chain of each subunit. The two enzymes have molecular weights of 2.6 × 105 and 2.2 × 105, respectively, and both are composed of four subunits. Restoration of primer independence to Form-T is obtained by treatment of Form-T with sulfhydryl reagents. After thiol treatment, one or two enzyme sulfhydryl groups become titratable."
https://openalex.org/W1489250509,"Abstract Two soil organisms that degrade pyridoxine by related but independent pathways were examined for enzymes involved in the initial oxidative attack on pyridoxine. Pyridoxine 4-dehydrogenase, an FAD-dependent enzyme isolated from Pseudomonas MA-1, dehydrogenates pyridoxine to pyridoxal, and utilizes either oxygen or 2,6-dichloroindophenol, an as the hydrogen acceptor. Pyridoxine 5-dehydrogenase, an FAD-dependent enzyme isolated from Pseudomonas IA, converts pyridoxine to isopyridoxal and utilizes 2,6-dichloroindophenol, but not oxygen, as hydrogen acceptor. FMN does not replace FAD for either dehydrogenase. The two dehydrogenases differ substantially in their pH optima, in their affinities for pyridoxine and FAD, and in their behavior toward substrate analogues and inhibitors. Both are quite specific for pyridoxine as substrate, and both contain essential —SH groups. Pyridoxal and isopyridoxal, the initial products formed by these enzymes, are also the initial products formed during degradation of pyridoxine by growing cultures of the bacterial strains from which these dehydrogenases were obtained."
https://openalex.org/W1524776014,"Abstract The presence of dissolved salt during the enzymatic aminoacylation of transfer RNA diminishes the amount of aminoacyl-tRNA formed at the completion of the reaction. Experiments indicate that, although salt inhibits aminoacyl-fstRNA synthetases, the diminution of the final level of aminoacylation is the result of salt-dependent changes in tRNA. tRNAs accepting different amino acids differ widely in their sensitivity to the same salt, and each tRNA species varies considerably in its sensitivity to different substances. The salt-induced changes in tRNA can be reversed by dilution or by removal of the salt. Several physical studies have failed to reveal any measurable alteration in tRNA structure in the presence of salt concentrations in which tRNA is partially or wholly inactive in amino acid acceptance, provided Mg++ is present in all salt solutions which are compared."
https://openalex.org/W1662521859,"Sequential oligopeptides prepared by condensation of peptides with the sequence Ala-Pro-Gly or Gly-Pro-Gly were examined as possible substrates or inhibitors for the synthesis of hydroxyproline by protocollagen proline hydroxylase. The tripeptide BOC-Ala-Pro-Gly-OMe (where BOC-represents t-butoxycarboxyl- and Me represents methyl) was not hydroxylated, but oligopeptides ranging in size from BOC(Ala-Pro-Gly)2OMe to BOC(Ala-Pro-Gly)6OMe served as substrates for the synthesis of hydroxyproline. The results indicated that a peptide must contain a minimum of 4 to 6 amino acid residues in order to serve as a substrate, and they supported previous indications that a peptide of more than about 20 residues is required for optimal interaction with the enzyme. The oligopeptides H(Gly-Pro-Gly)2OH and H(Gly-Pro-Gly)4OH were not substrates for the enzyme, but H(Gly-Pro-Gly)4OH was a competitive inhibitor for the hydroxylation of proline in the polymer (Gly-Pro-Pro)n (synthesized as (Pro-Gly-Pro)n). Comparison of H(Gly-Pro-Gly)4OH with H(Pro)12OH indicated that H(Gly-Pro-Gly)4OH was a more effective inhibitor than the proline homopeptide with the same number of amino acid residues. A polymer with the permuted sequence Gly-Pro-Ala had a small inhibitory effect, and it also served as a substrate for the synthesis of hydroxyproline at a small but significant rate."

https://openalex.org/W1597136875,"Abstract The adenosine diphosphate glucose pyrophosphorylase from Rhodospirillum rubrum has been purified to apparent homogeneity with a heat step, protamine sulfate fractionation, ammonium sulfate fractionation, DEAE-Sephadex chromatography, and two preparative disc gel electrophoresis steps. The molecular weight obtained from this enzyme from sedimentation equilibrium was from 195,000 (for v = 0.70) to 245,000 (for v = 0.75). A molecular weight of 225,000 was obtained by a disc gel electrophoresis technique. The synthesis of ADP-glucose was dependent on the presence of ATP, glucose-1-P, enzyme, and either magnesium or manganous ion. The enzyme was quite specific for ATP. CTP, dGTP, ITP, TTP, and UTP could not substitute for ATP. In the presence of pyruvate, CTP gave 4.4% and dATP 1.9% of the activity found when ATP was the substrate. The enzyme was activated by pyruvate. None of the other glycolytic intermediates tested activated this enzyme. Pyruvate (5 mm) increased the Vmax of ADPglucose synthesis 2.5- to 3-fold, decreased the S0.5 for ATP about 10-fold (from 3.4 mm to 0.36 mm), and shifted the pH optimum of the enzyme from pH 8.5 to a broader pH optimum extending from pH 7.5 to 9.2. The saturation curves for ATP and pyruvate were sigmoidal, and a reciprocal heterotropic interaction exists between these two ligands. Increasing the concentration of one of these ligands decreased the sigmoidicity of the saturation curve for the other, as well as the concentration needed for half-maximal activity. The Hill constant (n) for pyruvate was 1.9 at 0.25 mm ATP, 1.7 at 0.50 mm ATP, and 1.2 at 2.5 mm ATP. n for ATP was 2.97 in the absence of pyruvate and 1.82 in the presence of 5 mm pyruvate. It was also found that pyruvate decreased the amount of metal ion required for half-maximal velocity: from 6.0 mm to 2.7 mm with Mg++, and from 5.4 mm to 1.8 mm with Mn++. When the level of ATP was below 1 mm, and Mg++ below 2 mm, the enzyme was almost totally dependent on pyruvate for activity. At 0.5 mm ATP, pyruvate in the range of concentration of 0.1 mm to 3 mm dramatically increased the activity of the enzyme. The reverse reaction, the pyrophosphorolysis of ADP-glucose, was dependent on the presence of ADP-glucose, enzyme, and Mg++. Pyruvate increased the Vmax of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorolysis from 1.5- to 2-fold, decreased the S0.5 for ADP-glucose more than 5-fold (from 2.0 mm to 0.38 mm), and decreased the Hill constant n with respect to ADP-glucose from n = 2.02 to n = 1.42."

The final product which appears homogeneous in gel diffusion patterns and in sedimentation patterns on sucrose density gradients has a molecular weight of approximately 40,000. Turnover numbers and Km values for the five substrate sugars were d-glucose (1.1 x 106 min-1, 25.2 mm), d-galactose (1.3 x 106 min-1, 6.5 mm), d-xylose (1.3 x 106 min-1, 13.2 mm), l-arabinose (2.0 x 106 min-1, 8.3 mm), and d-fucose (0.35 x 106 min-1, 2.0 mm). Dialysis against water inactivated the enzyme while 10-5 m NaCl restored 50% activity. The preparation is completely stable at 4° but loses activity when stored frozen. It is reversibly inactivated by traces of organic solvents. The enzyme is sulfhydryl-dependent and was completely inactivated by mercuric ions or p-chloromercuribenzoate. The sulfhydryl content measured by titration with p-chloromercuribenzoate was 8 moles of cysteine per mole of enzyme and preliminary amino acid analyses indicated the presence of approximately 18 moles of histidine. Structural requirements for substrates are a pyranose ring with free hydroxyl groups on C-2 and C-3 in the equatorial-equatorial (trans) configuration. Many sugars, including enantiomorphs of the substrates, are good competitive inhibitors. The steric requirements indicate that a three-point attachment to the enzyme is required for substrate activity but that a two-point attachment at C-2 or C-3 or the ring oxygen (or both) is sufficient for inhibition."

https://openalex.org/W1583855102,"Abstract A procedure was developed for purifying l-citramalate hydrolyase (mesaconase), an enzyme system from Clostridium tetanomorphum known to consist of two components. Component I was purified 1,000-fold in 20% yield to a final specific activity of 11,800 e.u. per mg of protein. Component II was routinely purified 150-fold in 14% yield to a specific activity of 1,600 e.u. per mg and sometimes 600-fold in 10% yield to a specific activity of 6,200 e.u. per mg. Although neither component was homogeneous, the best preparations of each compound were free of the other component and of neighboring enzymes on the path of glutamate fermentation. The molecular weights of Components I and II, determined by gel filtration on Sephadex, are about 45,000 and 310,000, respectively. At pH 7.5 or below, Component II partially dissociates into species with molecular weights of about 165,000, 82,000, and 37,000. At pH 9.0, these species reassociate to form active Component II of about the original molecular weight. The observed species may represent a monomer, dimer, tetramer, and octamer of a single subunit. The stability of Components I and II under various conditions was investigated. Conditions affecting the activity of the enzyme system in the assay were examined and the essentiality of an active sulfhydryl reducing agent and Fe2+ was established. Fe2+ cannot be replaced in the assay by other divalent cations; Mn2+ is strongly inhibitory and competes with Fe2+. Substrate specificity studies showed that the purified enzyme system catalyzes the reversible dehydration of l(+)-citramalate to mesaconate and l-malate to fumarate. Although mesaconate and l-citramalate have high affinities for the enzyme, fumarate and l-malate are interconverted more rapidly. Other structurally related compounds are not used. d-Malate, l-tartrate, and succinate, but not d-citramalate, are competitive inhibitors of the enzyme. The equilibrium constants for the hydrations of mesaconate and fumarate are about the same (6.0 ± 1.0)."

https://openalex.org/W1604555355,"Abstract A butyrylcholinesterase, purified from porcine parotid glands, behaved as a single component in sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation and migrated as a single esterase in starch gel electrophoresis. The molecular weight of the enzyme was estimated to be 368,000. Amino acid analysis showed a high proline content (7.6%) and the presence of two unidentified components. Substrate specificity and inhibitor studies indicated that the enzyme is a butyrylcholinesterase of the type described in porcine serum and colostrum. Over a broad range of acetylcholine concentrations, the enzyme follows MichaelisMenten kinetics. A study of product inhibition indicated choline to be a competitive inhibitor with a Ki of 2.4 x 10-3 m; no inhibition by acetate could be shown. Maximum activity and lowest Km with acetylcholine were observed at pH values 8 to 9. The effect of pH on Vmax suggested that a group at the active site of the enzyme has a pK' of 6.3 to 6.5. Tetramethylammonium ion was a competitive inhibitor, the dissociation constant of which decreased as the pH was increased."
https://openalex.org/W1606193410,"Abstract A gulonolactone oxidase (l-gulono-γ-lactone:O2 oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.3.b) preparation was obtained from rat liver microsomes in which the enzyme was nonsedimentable after several hours of centrifugation at 100,000 x g. This initial preparation had 3- to 4-fold the specific activity of the microsomes. The enzyme has properties which suggest that it is associated with a lipid-containing membrane subunit of the endoplasmic reticulum. Gel filtration studies indicate that the subunit has a molecular weight of about 450,000. Acrylamide electrophoresis of fractions obtained from gel filtration of this enzyme preparation displayed only two observable bands in fractions having the highest specific activity for gulonolactone oxidase as compared to eight bands in the unfractionated preparation. There was substantial recovery of total activity in the fractions showing only two observable components; nevertheless the specific activity of these fractions was only 10- to 12-fold that of the starting microsomes, indicating that the enzyme may be only a small part of one of these components. The sedimentation behavior of the enzyme in the soluble preparation, its relative insensitivity to pH changes, and the presence of lipid in the gel filtration fractions mentioned above indicate that the subunit must contain considerable lipid in which the enzyme may exist in an essentially hydrophobic environment."

This indicates that the coenzyme is bound by a thiol ester linkage to the γ-carboxyl group of a protein glutamic acid residue.

The concentrations of nickel-63 are low (maximum of 163 disintegrations per minute per gram of dry weight), but this radionuclide may be a useful tracer of oceanic processes because of its long half-life and long residence time in the ocean."
https://openalex.org/W1672918571,"Abstract The effects of N-methylphenazonium methosulfate (PMS) have been compared with three other phenazine dyes and N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD). All accelerate the recovery of the initial absorbance changes in Rhodospirillum rubrum extracts induced by a 10-µsec flash, although only N-ethylphenazonium ethosulfate and TMPD stimulate photophosphorylation to the same extent as PMS. N-Ethyl-1,2-benzophenazonium perchlorate and N-ethyl-1,2,6,7-dibenzophenazonium chloride are less active. Absorbance changes with the dyes give evidence for the presence of at least three steps. The first is the light reaction, occurring at the instant of a flash (g25 µsec), generating an oxidant and a reductant. This is represented by the initial flash-induced absorbance change, which is unaffected by the presence of dyes. The second step, a slower reaction (complete in approximately 100 µsec with 0.5 mm reduced PMS), is the reduction of the photo-oxidant at the expense of reduced dye. This is evidenced by the marked stimulation of recovery of the initial flash-induced absorbance change by reduced dye, coupled with the appearance of oxidized dye (TMPD). The kinetics is monophasic first order, in contrast to the slow polyphasic kinetics of recovery in absence of dye. The initial rate of recovery of absorbance change is directly proportional to reduced dye concentration. The oxidation of TMPD induced by a single saturating 10-µsec flash is directly proportional to extract concentration and represents one-thirtieth of the bacteriochlorophyll content. Double flash experiments show that the initial flash-induced absorbance changes signal saturation of photochemical reaction centers. Maximal utilization of a second flash for dye photo-oxidation requires complete recovery of the initial absorbance changes induced by the first flash. The third step is the reduction of oxidized dye at the expense of reductant formed in the light reaction, completing the cyclic process of electron transport. Reduction of photo-oxidized TMPD is stimulated markedly by repetitive flashes. Reduction of TMPD following a single flash is very slow (t1/2 ∼ 1 sec), whereas reduction in repetitive flashes is complete in less than 50 msec (with a flashing rate of 20 per sec). The slowness of dye reduction compared to dye photo-oxidation is evidenced by the accumulation of oxidized dye during repetitive excitation. In continuous illumination the level of oxidized dye (∼20-fold that formed in by single 10-µsec flash) approximates the bacteriochlorophyll content. A study of photophosphorylation in flashing illumination indicates that addition of PMS or TMPD lowers the yield of ATP formed in a 10-µsec flash. With TMPD, the 10-µsec flash yield represents 0.05 ATP per electron (TMPD photo-oxidized). Double flash experiments show that maximal utilization of a second flash for phosphorylation (as with dye photo-oxidation) requires complete recovery of the initial absorbance change induced by the first flash. These experiments show that the rapid recovery of photochemical reaction centers induced by both TMPD and PMS allows accumulation of intermediates involved in photophosphorylation during repetitive excitation. The dyes thus increase the flash yield of ATP obtained with 2-msec flashes. The rate of phosphorylation in darkness following a 2-msec flash also is increased by the dyes."

https://openalex.org/W1574580032,"Abstract Citramalate hydrolyase (mesaconase) is inactivated by oxygen and can be reactivated by incubating the two protein components (Components I and II) with a reducing agent and ferrous ion in the absence of oxygen. Optimal conditions for the activation of the enzyme have been determined by the use of purified preparations of the two components, and the specificity of the reducing agent and ferrous ion requirements has been investigated. Several mercaptans and dithionite are effective in varying degrees as reducing agents. Three mercaptans, 2-mercaptoethanol, 2-mercaptoethylamine, and homocysteine, are fully effective at pH 8 and at a low Fe2+ concentration, whereas other mercaptans are maximally effective only when the pH and the Fe2+ level are increased. Ferrous ion is essential for activation of the enzyme and cannot be replaced by other divalent cations. Manganous ion inhibits activation. Evidence has been obtained that reduction of Component II by a mercaptan is the first rate-limiting step in the activation process. Reduction of Component II is a slow process, requiring about 45 min at 37° to reach completion under specific conditions. The degree of reduction appears to depend on the mercaptan concentration. Reduction is fully reversible by exposure to oxygen. Component II, either oxidized or reduced, is strongly inhibited by exposure to iodoacetate, whereas Component I is insensitive to iodoacetate. Ferrous ion is not involved in reduction of Component II by mercaptans, but is essential for the interaction of the protein components to form a catalytically active complex. The formation of the active complex from Component I and reduced Component II, in the presence of mercaptoethanol and ferrous ion, requires about 15 min at 37° and 45 min at 25° to reach completion under specific conditions. At temperatures below about 15°, full activation is not achieved, but a stable activity level is reached that varies linearly with temperature. At 0°, this level is about 50% of maximal activity when Component II is limiting and about 80% when Component I is limiting. The effect of temperature on the activity level is irreversible in the sense that raising the temperature increases activity whereas lowering the temperature has no effect. The pH of the activation solution also markedly affects the extent of active complex formation; at 37°, the final activity level increases sharply between pH 6.5 and 7.5, and approaches a maximal value at pH 8.0 and above. These and other results are interpreted to indicate the existence of two conformational states or more of Component II and several types of complexes of the two components. The stability of the conformational states and the complexes is postulated to vary with temperature and pH of the activation solution."
https://openalex.org/W1506068929,"Abstract A prototrophic revertant SP22 has been isolated from a double auxotroph of Rhodopseudomonas spheroides M29.5 requiring methionine and leucine for growth. As compared to M29.5, the specific activity of threonine deaminase in cell-free extract of SP22 is about 4-fold higher; the specific activity of aspartokinase, on the other hand, is about one-fifth to one-tenth of that found in M29.5. DEAE-cellulose chromatography of crude extracts of SP22 reveals two threonine deaminase activities, designated as PR-TDI and PR-TDII. The ratio of activities of PR-TDI and PR-TDII in extracts is about 0.67. The deaminase of the double auxotrophic strain M29.5 is indistinguishable from the enzyme obtained from the wild type R. spheroides and no such enzyme activity is detected in extracts prepared from SP22. The activity of PR-TDII is much more stable to storage at 4° and during heat treatment at 55°. PR-TDI activity, on the other hand, like the M29.5 enzyme, is susceptible to rapid inactivation under various experimental conditions. l-Isoleucine protects the deaminase of M29.5 against heat inactivation, whereas this amino acid increases the rate of heat inactivation of the PR-TDI activity. In contrast to the M29.5 threonine deaminase, the enzymes of the mutant strain do not require pyridoxal phosphate for activity during successive purification steps, indicating tightly bound coenzyme on the enzyme molecules. Studies with the feedback inhibitor l-isoleucine reveal that both wild type and PR-TDI activities are strongly inhibited by this amino acid, whereas the activity of PR-TDII is much less sensitive to isoleucine inhibition. The molecular weights of all three deaminases, as judged by gel filtration on Sephadex G-200, are not significantly different from one another. These results, and the data of the kinetic studies presented in the following paper, indicate that the two enzymes obtained from the prototrophic revertant are different from each other as well as from that of the auxotrophic strain M29.5."

https://openalex.org/W1580456943,"Abstract The metabolism of orally administered 8-methyl ether of xanthurenic acid-carboxy-14C and methoxy-14C was studied in rabbits. There was no evidence for decarboxylation of the 8-methyl ether of xanthurenic acid-carboxy-14C. However, rabbits O-demethylated nearly 20% of administered 8-methyl ether of xanthurenic acid-methoxy-14C, giving rise to 14CO2. This O-demethylation was accompanied by the presence of xanthurenic acid and its further metabolites, 8-hydroxyquinaldic acid and an 8-hydroxyquinaldic acid conjugate, in urine samples from rabbits receiving the 8-methyl ether of xanthurenic acid-carboxy-14C. The 8-methyl ether of xanthurenic acid-carboxy-14C and methoxy-14C were dehydroxylated in rabbits, as are xanthurenic acid and kynurenic acid, giving rise to a small amount of urinary 8-methoxyquinaldic acid. Thus, dehydroxylation represents a significant metabolic pathway for all 4-hydroxyquinoline-2-carboxylic acid derivatives studied to date. Pretreatment of rabbits with oral Neomycin sulfate in amounts sufficient to inhibit the multiplication of gastrointestinal microorganisms severely inhibited the O-demethylation and dehydroxylation of the 8-methyl ether of xanthurenic acid in rabbits. These results suggest that all further metabolism of the 8-methyl ether of xanthurenic acid in rabbits is mediated by or requires the presence of the gastrointestinal flora."

https://openalex.org/W1589707614,"Abstract Preliminary-kinetic analyses with two mutationally altered threonine deaminases, PR-TDI and PR-TDII, as well as the wild type enzyme of Rhodopseudomonas spheroides with l-threonine and l-serine as substrates reveal large differences in the substrate-binding abilities and significant variations in the homotropic interactions. The wild type enzyme shows sigmoid threonine saturation kinetics whereas the mutant enzymes reveal normal Michaelis-Menten behavior. The slope of the Hill plots with threonine as substrate indicates strong cooperative interactions for the wild type enzyme, while the slopes obtained for the mutant enzymes indicate lack of homotropic interactions. Similar experiments with l-serine as the substrate suggest loss of cooperativity with PR-TDI but not with PR-TDII. The substrate concentrations required for one-half maximal velocity, S0.5, with respect to both substrates are different for the mutationally altered enzymes as compared to the wild type enzyme. The dual effects of l-valine for activation and inhibition of enzyme activity are strongly dependent on the particular substrate used. With threonine as substrate, the activity of PR-TDI is stimulated at low levels of valine and inhibited at higher concentrations of this amino acid. The activity of PR-TDII is not stimulated by valine, but significant inhibition is observed at high valine concentrations. In contrast to the enzyme from the wild type organism, with serine as the substrate, no stimulation of enzyme activity by valine is observed with either PR-TDI or PR-TDII. Valine inhibits the activity of both mutant enzymes; with PR-TDII, 20-fold higher levels of valine are required for similar inhibition, and the maximal inhibition is only 50%. The inhibitory effect of isoleucine on enzyme activity is generally similar when either threonine or serine is used as substrate. PR-TDII is about 1000-fold less sensitive to isoleucine inhibition than PR-TDI. The data presented here support the model proposed earlier that there are two binding sites for valine per enzyme molecule and that one of these sites is closely associated with a threonine-binding site, whereas the second one is identical with or closely overlapping that of the isoleucine site. Furthermore, it is concluded from these studies that threonine and serine occupy separate sites on the enzyme molecule."
