https://openalex.org/W2015423321,"Infrared spectra demonstrate that at pressures above 20 gigapascals and room temperature the regular tetrahedral coordination of oxygen around both silicon and aluminum ions is severely disrupted in SiO2, CaMgSi2O6, and CaAlSi2O8 composition glasses. The spectra are consistent with gradual, pressure-induced increases in the coordination numbers of silicon and aluminum. A variety of coordination environments, from sixfold to fourfold, appears to be present at pressures as high as about 40 gigapascals. This apparent change in coordination is not quenchable at room temperature: on decompression, the glasses return to tetrahedral coordination. This continuous and reversible coordination change in amorphous silicates explains the lack of observation of coordination changes in silicate glasses quenched from high pressure, the shallow melting slopes observed for mantle silicates at high pressures, and the possible presence of neutrally buoyant magmas deep within the terrestrial planets."

It is the first bacterium known to both digest cellulose and fix nitrogen, and it is a participant in a unique symbiotic relation with shipworms that may explain how teredinids are able to use wood as their principal food source."
https://openalex.org/W1984749780,"Bell miners (Manorina melanophrys) feed primarily on the lerps and nymphs of psyllids, and they defend communal territories against other bird species. As bell miners were removed exprimentally from a psyllid-infested patch of eucalypt forest, birds of 11 other species moved in to feed on psyllids and within 4 months they eradicated the infestation. This shows the ability of other birds to control these insects in the absence of bell miners and the value of interspecific territoriality to bell miners."
https://openalex.org/W2055303708,"The magnon pairing mechanism is derived to explain the high-temperature superconductivity of both the La2-xSrxCu1O4 and Y1Ba2Cu3O7 systems. Critical features include (i) a one- or two-dimensional lattice of linear Cu-O-Cu bonds that contribute to large antiferromagnetic (superexchange) coupling of the CuII(d9) orbitals; (ii) holes in the oxygen pπ bands [rather than CuIII(d8)] leading to high mobility hole conduction; and (iii) strong ferromagnetic coupling between oxygen pπ holes and adjacent CuII(d9) electrons. The ferromagnetic coupling of the conduction electrons with copper d spins induces the attractive interaction responsible for the superconductivity, leading to triplet-coupled pairs called ""tripgems."" The disordered Heisenberg lattice of antiferromagnetically coupled copper d spins serves a role analogous to the phonons in a conventional system. This leads to a maximum transition temperature of about 200 K. For La1.85Sr0.15Cu1O4, the energy gap is in excellent agreement with experiment. For Y1Ba2Cu3O7, we find that both the CuO sheets and the CuO chains can contribute to the supercurrent."
https://openalex.org/W2158216061,"Year-long measurements of subsurface current and temperature on Peru's continental shelf included the onset of El Niño in 1976 and 1982. The Peru Coastal Undercurrent more than doubled in speed and advected anomalously warm water poleward. El Niño began in different seasons in 1976 and 1982, but the current and temperature responses were very similar. Acceleration of poleward flow at 10 degrees S occurred several days after sea level rose at the Galápagos Islands in October 1982, suggesting the onset of El Niño propagated as a Kelvin wave."
https://openalex.org/W2070865929,"Carbon films with a diamondlike structure that are chemically bonded to surfaces have been deposited by means of low-energy C(+) ion beams. When mass-selected C(+) beams at energies in the range from 20 to 200 electron volts impinge on atomically clean surfaces, the first carbon monolayer grows as a carbide structure that is chemically bonded to the surface. As deposition continues, the structure evolves over the next several atomic layers into a diamondlike structure. These pure carbon films are strongly adhered to the surface through the carbide bonds, which also provide for an intimate interface. There are significant applications for such films, particularly as insulators and doped semiconductors."
https://openalex.org/W2027188688,"Interest in direct coal liquefaction steadily decreased during the 1980s as the price of crude oil dropped; there is now only one integrated coal liquefaction pilot plant active full time in the United States. The economics derived early in the decade established the price of transportation fuels from coal at $80 per barrel or higher. However, there have been dramatic improvements in the technology since 1983 that have not been widely appreciated. Recent designs and cost estimates show that a 60 percent decrease in the cost of liquid fuels from coal to an equivalent of $35 per barrel for crude oil. Although this cost is not low enough to justify immediate commercialization, additional improvements have been identified that could make direct liquefaction an attractive way to produce gasoline and other conventional fuels."
https://openalex.org/W2000491747,"Significant advances have been made in the ability to control the motion of neutral atoms. Cooling and trapping atoms present new possibilities for studies of ultracold atoms and atomic interactions. The techniques of laser cooling and deceleration of atomic beams, magnetic and laser trapping of neutral atoms, and a number of recent advances in the use of radiative forces to manipulate atoms are reviewed."

https://openalex.org/W2045734935,"Ground-based observations of the object IRAS 14348-1447, which was discovered with the Infrared Astronomical Satellite, show that it is an extremely luminous colliding galaxy system that emits more than 95 percent of its energy at far-infrared wavelengths. IRAS 14348-1447, which is receding from the sun at 8 percent of the speed of light, has a bolometric luminosity more than 100 times larger than that of our galaxy, and is therefore as luminous as optical quasars. New optical, infrared, and spectroscopic measurements suggest that the dominant luminosity source is a dust-enshrouded quasar. The fuel for the intense activity is an enormous supply of molecular gas. Carbon monoxide emission has been detected at a wavelength of 2.6 millimeters by means of a new, more sensitive receiver recently installed on the 12-meter telescope of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory. IRAS 14348-1447 is the most distant and luminous source of carbon monoxide line emission yet detected. The derived mass of interstellar molecular hydrogen is 6 × 1010 solar masses. This value is approximately 20 times that of the molecular gas content of the Milky Way and is similar to the largest masses of atomic hydrogen found in galaxies. A large mass of molecular gas may be a prerequisite for the formation of quasars during strong galactic collisions."
