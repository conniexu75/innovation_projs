https://openalex.org/W2024763326,"THE origin of plasma cells in inflammatory reactions in non-lymphoid tissue is perplexing. They are found in the circulation only in unusual circumstances1 and are not a usual cellular component of normal connective tissue. A possible source of these cells in areas of injury is suggested from investigations of lymphocytic cells in the vascular spaces and alveolar walls of the lung following the intravenous injection of complete Freund's adjuvant. The changes in some of these lymphocytes are similar to those described for white cells of the peripheral blood grown in tissue culture in the presence of a variety of materials. When phytohæmagglutinin, tuberculin, tetanus toxoid, diphtheria toxoid, smallpox vaccine, hæmophilus pertussis antigen, staphylococcal antigen, leukocyte antiserum, pollen extract and various tissue antigens are added to cultures of white cells from the peripheral blood, the small and medium sized lymphocytes enlarge and mitotic division may occur2–13. Tanaka et al.14 have described a developing Golgi apparatus, increased ribosomes and a small amount of endoplasmic reticulum in cultures of lymphocytes from peripheral blood."

https://openalex.org/W2064006774,"THE recent publication of a device for applying liquids to paper chromatograms1 prompts this report of a simple arrangement for the reproducible transfer of small volumes which is in routine use in this laboratory for the application of steroid standards to paper chromatograms. It consists of a lambda pipette clamped in the vertical position with the pipette tip firmly against the surface of the chromatography paper which is supported on a perforated metal disk. A stream of compressed air for drying passes through holes in the metal disk against the lower surface of the paper (Fig. 1). In practice the pipette is filled with solvent and positioned while keeping a finger over the upper orifice to prevent leakage. Gradual transfer of solvent to paper begins when the finger is released. A Medtec Spotting Device was employed, but a simpler device for support of the paper and delivery of a gas stream would serve the purpose."

Experimental evidence for this has been obtained by workers using chemically-induced tumours and others with a virus-induced tumour and spontaneous tumours1–3. It has also been shown, however, that the spontaneous. A-strain carcinoma is not antigenic after repeated transplantation in the strain of origin4."
