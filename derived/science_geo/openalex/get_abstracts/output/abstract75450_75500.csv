The material stained at synapses is distinct from the adjacent unstained synaptic membranes and has cytochemical properties of protein. The specialized spatial arrangement exhibited by this synaptic material suggests its close involvement in synaptic function.
https://openalex.org/W2025735179,The kinetics of the primary antibody response to bacteriophage φX174 have been studied in the fetal lamb in utero after permanent indwelling catheterization of the fetal blood vessels. The initial antibody response by the developing fetus to this form of antigenic stimulus is comparable to that found in adult animals and shows none of the characteristics of the immature immunologic response that have generally been ascribed to fetal and neonatal animals.
https://openalex.org/W2046776858,"In segregating F(2), F(3), and F(4) generations, albino mice had lower activity and higher defecation scores than pigmented animals when tested in a brightly lighted open field. These differences persisted when members of an F(5) generation were tested under white light, but largely disappeared under red light. Thus it was concluded that there is a major gene effect on the quantitative traits of open-field activity and defecation which is mediated by the visual system and that albino mice are more photophobic than pigmented mice under conditions of bright illumination."

https://openalex.org/W1500562856,"Abstract The principal proteinpolysaccharide, called PP-L, of bovine nasal cartilage has been fractionated centrifugally to give four products. The method requires low concentration of PP-L, high concentration of salt, and makes use of a remarkable difference between the effects of salts with monovalent and divalent cations on the sedimentation behavior of these proteinpolysaccharides. A fifth product, PP-L2, has previously been isolated from cartilage residue. Of these five, three are almost identical analytically, but differ in the stage of the whole procedure at which their separation becomes possible. The protein contents of the five lie in the range 9 to 36%, but the amino acid profiles of all five are very similar. Of the five forms, the one called PP-L3 behaves in the analytical ultracentrifuge as a single component; the others do not. The two forms with high protein contents sediment most easily and have the highest limiting viscosity numbers. These five products account for 40% of the original dry cartilage weight and 85% of its uronic acid content."
https://openalex.org/W1559698715,"Abstract The composition and metabolism of the fatty acids and lipids in the larval and adult forms of Spirometra mansonoides were studied. The parasite has a high content of cholesterol and of neutral and phospholipids which contain large amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids. The fatty acid composition of the parasite closely resembles that of its host. S. mansonoides lacks the mechanisms required for the synthesis de novo of its sterols and long chain saturated and unsaturated fatty acids either in the presence or in the absence of molecular oxygen. By contrast, it possesses mechanisms for the synthesis of its own triglycerides, sterolesters, and phospholipids, with the use of exogenously supplied sterols and fatty acids."
https://openalex.org/W2042728667,Abstract. Mice were injected in the temporal region of the brain with cycloheximide or puromycin; both agents markedly inhibit protein synthesis in the brain. Recordings of electrical activity were made in the hippocampal region 5 hours after injection of these drugs. The amplitude and frequency observed in records from mice injected with cycloheximide were indistinguishable from those injected with saline alone. Records from puromycin-injected mice were strikingly abnormal. This finding may contribute to the differences in behavioral effects of intracerebral injections of the two inhibitors of protein synthesis studied.
https://openalex.org/W1551022303,"Abstract A procedure has been described for the purification of ribonucleotide reductase from Lactobacillus leichmannii, a rich source of enzyme. The enzyme is monodisperse in the ultracentrifuge and on cellulose acetate electrophoresis. Only trace impurities appear on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, but this procedure, performed at pH 9.5, yields two major bands. This may reflect alteration of the enzyme by the conditions of electrophoresis. The sedimentation coefficient is 5.8 S, and the molecular weight calculated from sedimentation equilibrium analysis is approximately 110,000. The preferred substrates are ribonucleoside triphosphates. Purified enzyme requires 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazolylcobamide coenzyme and dihydrolipoate or the thioredoxinthioredoxin reductase system from Escherichia coli B. The requirements for divalent cations and adenosine triphosphate vary, depending upon the presence of one another and the identity of the substrate. For example, in the absence of Mg++, the ATP requirement for cytidine triphosphate reduction is decreased, and, in the absence of ATP, Mg++ inhibits CTP, uridine triphosphate, and guanosine triphosphate reduction. It is concluded that divalent cations function in regulating the rates at which different substrates are reduced. Studies of the role of ATP in CTP reduction show that dATP can replace ATP. ATP and dATP both participate catalytically and decrease the apparent Km for CTP. Evidence is presented which suggests that ATP may be converted to dATP, which then serves as an allosteric effector for CTP reduction."
https://openalex.org/W2397866928,"Some of the kinetic and structural properties of purified adenylate kinase derived from bovine liver mitochondria have been investigated and compared with the corresponding properties of adenylate kinase from rabbit muscle. The results of studies of the isotope exchange reaction between each of the substrates at equilibrium are consistent with the two-site mechanism proposed for the skeletal muscle enzyme. Other studies show that the liver enzyme is similar to the muscle enzyme with respect to maximum catalytic rate, Km values of the several substrates, product inhibition, cation activation, and pH optimum, and therefore provide evidence that both enzymes utilize a similar reaction mechanism. Studies of the structural properties of the liver enzyme have confirmed earlier suggestions that it does not contain an essential sulfhydryl group but does contain at least one and probably two disulfide bridges which are essential for enzymatic activity. The presence of essential disulfide groups was inferred from the loss of activity when the enzyme was treated with reagents such as sodium sulfite or β-mercaptoethanol. The inactivation observed with β-mercaptoethanol could be reversed by exposure to air, which presumably results in reoxidation of the reduced disulfide bridge, or bridges. The results described in this and the preceding communication indicate that different, possibly tissue-specific, forms of adenylate kinase do exist in mammalian tissues and, therefore, that this enzyme constitutes an addition to a growing list of enzymes that exist in multiple molecular forms."
https://openalex.org/W1604842102,"Abstract Adenylate kinase has been purified approximately 700-fold from bovine liver mitochondria. The purity of the final preparation was evaluated by studies with ion exchange and molecular sieve chromatography and by sedimentation studies. By these criteria the enzyme is estimated to be 85 to 95% pure. The purified enzyme catalyzes transphosphorylation reactions between adenosine triphosphate and adenosine monophosphate, ATP and deoxy-AMP, and inosine triphosphate and AMP. The nearly constant ratios of these three activities throughout the purification scheme suggests that all are catalyzed by the same enzyme. Studies of the physical properties of the purified enzyme indicate it to possess a sedimentation constant of 2.49 S, a diffusion constant of 10.3 x 10-7 cm2 sec-1, a partial specific volume of 0.73 ml per g, and a molecular weight of 21,500. These properties are identical with those previously reported for crystalline adenylate kinase from skeletal muscle. Amino acid analysis of the purified enzyme indicate its composition to be: Asp18, Thr9, Ser11, Glu20, Pro13, Gly15, Ala17, Val13, Met5, Leu20, Illeu9, Phe7, Tyr5, Lys15, His4, Arg10, Try2, and CyS4, totaling 197 residues. Spectral studies with p-chloromercuribenzoate indicate that the enzyme does not contain free sulfhydryl groups. This finding is consistent with the lack of inhibition of catalytic activity by this and other sulfhydryl reagents and indicates that whereas the skeletal enzyme is sensitive to sulfhydryl reagents and is known to contain free sulfhydryl groups, the liver enzyme contains 4 half-cystine residues in some other form, possibly as two disulfide groups."

These doubly heterozygous patients were phenotypically indistinguishable from cystinuric homozygotes of genotype I-I, II-II, or III-III. The data provide the first direct evidence that all of the known mutations responsible for the genetic heterogeneity in cystinuria are allelic."

Michaelis constants for reduced glutathione and CoASSG are 3.3 x 10-4 m and 4.5 x 10-5 m, respectively. The molecular weight of the enzyme, determined by gel filtration, is approximately 12,000. Several unsymmetrical disulfides containing a glutathione residue are equally as effective as substrates. The enzyme, which becomes less active during storage, is largely reactivated by GSH. Its potential physiological significance is discussed."

Certain moths have ears sensitive to these chirps and can detect bats well beyond the range of the bats' sonar. On hearing a distant bat, many moths turn and fly directly away from the source of ultrasound. Only one sense cell in each ear of a moth provides the primary nervous information for this response. This article describes my initial attempts to find out how a moth's central nervous system processes the train of chirps reaching its two ears."
https://openalex.org/W31506792,"Abstract The following reactions which lead to formation of a 3,6-dideoxyhexose have been described in the five known serotypes of Pasteurella pseudotuberculosis: formation of cytidine diphosphate d-glucose from CTP and α-d-glucose 1-phosphate, formation of CDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose from CDP-d-glucose, and conversion of CDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose to CDP-3,6-dideoxyhexose. The dideoxyhexose synthesized enzymatically in these pathways (paratose in Types I and III, abequose in Type II, tyvelose in Type IV, or ascarylose in Type V) was in each case the same as that which is found in the lipopolysaccharide of the smooth strain. A rough mutant of Type I lacked CDP-d-glucose oxidoreductase. This pathway was also found in several strains of Salmonella."

https://openalex.org/W1527714365,"Abstract Two distinct d-amino acid dehydrogenases, each showing absolute specificity for methylene blue or 2,6-dichloroindophenol, respectively, were isolated from Pseudomonas fluorescens (ATCC 11299B). The methylene blue-specific d-amino acid dehydrogenase was detectable only in extracts from d-tryptophan-grown cells and was purified about 40-fold. The 2,6-dichloroindophenol-specific d-amino acid dehydrogenase is constitutive, being present in all cell extracts irrespective of culture conditions, and it was purified about 65-fold. These enzymes appear to be flavoproteins in which the flavin adenine dinucleotide prosthetic group is tightly bound to the enzyme protein. The optimal pH of two enzymes was 7 to 8 and the Michaelis-Menten constant was 3 to 5 x 10-4 m for each d-amino acid. Substrate specificity and thermal stability were observed to be somewhat different for the two enzymes. No inhibition of these enzymes was observed with metal chelating agents."
https://openalex.org/W1571398323,"Cell-free extracts of Clostridium thermoaceticum have been shown to synthesize acetate, labeled in both carbon atoms, from 14CO2. The extracts can also catalyze the conversion of the methyl group of Co-14CH3-cobalamin into the methyl group of acetate. This conversion is dependent upon coenzyme A and pyruvate, and is sensitive to sulfhydryl poisons, especially arsenite and cadmium. An exchange between CO2 and the carboxyl group of pyruvate is catalyzed by the extracts and is sensitive to iodoacetamide. Passage of the extracts over diethylaminoethyl cellulose resolves the system into two fractions which can be reactivated on recombination only by the further addition of ferredoxin."

https://openalex.org/W2163366250,"Abstract The control of protein synthesis has been investigated in subcellular systems from livers of rats with plasma protein overproduction following nephrotoxic serum. The following observations were made. The microsomal fraction from nephrotic liver exhibited an increased synthesis of acid-insoluble protein and of plasma albumin, as measured by amino acid incorporation per mg of ribonucleic acid present. The synthesis of plasma albumin showed a much greater increase than did the synthesis of other proteins. This is in contrast to the situation in regenerating liver, in which the increase in plasma albumin synthesis was of the same order of magnitude as the increase in acid-insoluble protein. Ribosomes or polysomes, prepared from nephrotic liver with deoxycholate, did not differ from normal liver in their ability to synthesize protein. This finding, together with the observation that mixtures of control and nephrotic microsomal fractions behaved like the nephrotic system, suggested that the difference between control and nephrotic microsomes was not the result of any inherent difference in ribosomes but might be due to the presence of additional amounts of messenger RNA. Polysomes prepared from nephrotic liver without the use of deoxycholate but still containing small amounts of attached membrane protein showed slight but significant increases in plasma albumin synthesis, averaging 33%. Cell sap from nephrotic liver was more active than that from controls in promoting protein and plasma albumin synthesis by microsomes. This difference was ascribed to the presence of increased amounts of messenger RNA in this fraction on the basis of indirect evidence."

https://openalex.org/W1524711591,Abstract Aldolase was slowly inhibited in the presence of dihydroxyacetone phosphate and hydrogen cyanide. Activity was recovered on removal of these reagents. Neither dihydroxyacetone phosphate or hydrogen cyanide separately nor dihydroxyacetone with cyanide inhibited aldolase. The formation of an inactive aminonitrile enzyme derivative by addition of cyanide to an enzyme-substrate imine (Schiff base) is postulated. The rate and equilibrium constants for inhibition were marginally lower for carboxypeptidase A-treated aldolase than for native aldolase.

Even after 6 months' exposure to ""days"" longer than the normal 24 hours, the animals returned promptly to circadian rhythmicity when placed under freerunning conditions of continuous dark. That such rhythms also reappeared when the light condition of the 36-hour cycle was reduced from 660 to 33 lumens per square meter suggests that brightness may be the critical factor in the unexpectedly broad range of entrainment demonstrated."
https://openalex.org/W1550697629,"Abstract By the use of a rapid dialysis equilibrium technique, the binding of skatole and acetyl-l-tryptophan with bovine albumin has been studied at various concentrations of KCl, dioxane, urea, and glycine, at different pH values, and at different temperatures. Binding was found to be principally at one site with an association constant much higher than at any secondary sites. The primary association constant, k'1, for skatole at pH 6.3, 0.1 m KCl, was 4.2 x 105 m-1 (4°) and 1.9 x 105 m-1 (18°); for acetyl-l-tryptophan at the same conditions, k'1 was 3.5 x 105 m-1 (4°) and 1.8 x 105 m-1 (18°). A decrease in KCl concentration from 0.1 to 0 decreased k'1 for skatole to a value 1/12 and 1/15 that in 0.1 m KCl. A decrease in KCl concentration from 0.1 to 0.002 m, on the other hand, increased k'1 for acetyl-l-tryptophan approximately 3-fold. Chloride was a competitive inhibitor of acetyl-l-tryptophan. The addition of either dioxane or urea reduced k'1 for skatole and acetyl-l-tryptophan, whereas the addition of glycine had no effect on k'1. When added to urea solutions, glycine increased k'1. The activity coefficient of skatole, γ, in urea, dioxane, or glycine-water mixtures and urea-glycine-water mixtures was determined by solubility measurements. The changes in k'1 for skatole in dioxane at all concentrations studied and in urea up to 2 m could be approximately reconciled by the assignment 1/γ2 for the ratio of the activity coefficients of the protein-skatole complex and the unassociated protein. The similarities in the effects of dioxane and urea (up to 2 m) on the association of the ligand have been taken to indicate that the primary influence of these solutes is on the apolar surfaces of the associating molecules. At approximately 4 m urea, k'1 became larger at 18° than at 4°, resulting in a crossing over of the temperature curves of k'1 plotted as a function of urea concentration. Thermodynamic changes for the association were also estimated. Under the same conditions, ΔS° was 5 to 15 calories per mol degree more negative for skatole than for acetyl-l-tryptophan. ΔS° increased markedly at urea concentrations above 2 m urea and also increased, but at a somewhat slower rate, as KCl concentrations were reduced from 0.1 to 0.002 m. The pH binding profiles of the indole ligands show a sharp change in binding at the position of the N-F transition, and also a change in binding between pH 7.5 and 9.5 consistent with a simple ionization process on the protein. The fatty acid content of several albumin preparations was determined, and the binding of the indole compounds was found to decrease in the presence of fatty acid. A molecular weight of 64,300 ± 300 was obtained for bovine albumin on the basis of a 1:1 stoichiometric relationship of the primary site ligand and albumin."
https://openalex.org/W1927333819,"Abstract To obtain information on factors that control the expression of and late phage functions during λ development, we have studied the formation of the two known λ-directed enzymes, exonuclease and endolysin, under various conditions of infection and lysogenic induction. The data indicate that exonuclease synthesis begins early in the latent period and is independent of phage DNA replication. In contrast, endolysin formation coincides with and appears to some extent to be dependent on λ DNA synthesis. During infection of the lysogen, K-12λ, by the virulent λ mutant, λvir, exonuclease synthesis, but not that of endolysin, is partially repressed. From their relation to phage DNA replication, exonuclease and endolysin appear to be analogous to and late enzymes, respectively, described during T-even phage infection. The results indicate that exonuclease and endolysin are encoded in different operons on the λ chromosome, of which only the operon is under the direct control of the λ repressor."

A comparison of the two assay procedures revealed that the pronounced stimulation of lactate dehydrogenase LDH activity was noted with the tetrazolium salt method but could not be detected with a direct photometric determination method. Incubation of lactate dehydrogenase with DDT or heptachlor prior to the addition of either diphosphopyridine nucleotide or substrate resulted in a complete inhibition of enzyme activity. The inclusion of either diphosphopyridine nucleotide or substrate in the prior incubation mixtures afforded no protection to the enzyme.

Data are presented showing that α-ketoisovalerate is probably not an intermediate in the total synthesis of acetate from CO2 which is catalyzed by C. thermoaceticum.
