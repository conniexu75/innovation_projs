https://openalex.org/W2087239801,"Historically, the reactions of O/sub 3/ and O(/sup 3/P) in photochemical smog formation have received major attention; however, during the last 5 years, the great importance of other species, such as OH and HO/sub 2/, has been established. Indeed, the hydroxyl radical has now been measured directly in urban air. Determination of the concentration-time profiles of OH under a variety of conditions in simulated and real atmospheres will most certainly greatly enhance our understanding of photooxidation processes occurring in these complex mixtures. Development of sufficiently sensitive detection techniques for other free radical species such as HO/sub 2/ will also prove of great value. Detailed quantitative data on the irradiation of simulated and real polluted atmospheres (even on the stable products) remain sparse; this is especially true for reactions of aromatic hydrocarbons. Furthermore, virtually no quantitative information, necessary for the validation of computer models, is available on the yields of such minor but mechanistically important species as HONO and H/sub 2/O/sub 2/. The complex chemistry of photochemical smog must include heterogeneous as well as homogeneous reactions. In addition, studies of physical and chemical synergisms arising from the introduction of SO/sub 2/ into the HC-NO/sub x/-Ox-UV system are of top priority, sincemore » the rate of photooxidation of gaseous SO/sub 2/ to particulate sulfate is greatly enhanced in ambient photochemical smog. Synergisms in these systems may also have important biological consequences. Finally, physical and chemical transformations occurring in the HC-NO/sub x/-Ox-UV system must be far better understood, because such knowledge is a cornerstone of rational, cost-effective air pollution control strategies. However, while this overall research goal is being pursued, we must utilize our existing knowledge and continue to press for an acceptable balance among our needs in energy, economics, and air quality.« less"

There is no such agreement for the upper ionosphere, where the densities of He(+) and H(+) are difficult to understand in terms of present concepts concerning the relevant production and loss processes. Sources of ionizing radiation are needed to explain night- time observations in the E region and perhaps also in the F region. The D region remains a poorly understood laboratory of negative-ion and positiveion chemistry, where neither observation nor theory is as yet adequate."

With direct coupling, separations of 10(5):1 between column ends have been obtained, with indications of great potential for further separation. A mathematical model and its solution describe the behavior of the system."

https://openalex.org/W2082254753,"Three-dimensional analysis of the crystal structure of kornerupine reveals the crystallochemical formula Mg(VI)(2)Mg(VI)AlVI(6)[Si(2)O(7)] [(Al,Si)(2) SiO(10)]O(4)(OH), with four formula units in the structure cell of a = 16.100 (2) A, b = 13.767(2) A, c = 6.735(2) A; space group, Cmcm. The unusual crystal structure includes walls of Al-O edge and corner-sharing octahedra, and chains of alternating Mg-O and Al-O octahedra fused to the walls by further edge-sharing to form dense slabs. These slabs are held together by [Si(2)O(7)] corner-sharing tetrahedral pairs and [(Al,Si)(2)SiO(10)] corner-sharing tetrahedral triplets."

https://openalex.org/W2065939027,Transform faults appear in the process of stretching during freezing of the surface films on liquid wax. These films are composed of a warp yarn of wax fibers with optical anisotropy. This fabric is absent in materials that fail to produce transform faults. The mechanical anisotropy of these wax films (with high tensile strength and low shear strength in the direction of spreading) is responsible for the initiation of the transform faults. It is suggested that the anisotropy of the ocean upper mantle recorded seismically may likewise be responsible for the creation of the ridge-ridge transform faults in the oceans.
https://openalex.org/W1965463335,"Surface oxidation irreversibly removes both oxygen and hydrogen from the martian atmosphere at a rate of 10(8) to 10(11) per square centimeter per second. This rate corresponds to a net loss of 10(25) to 10(28) per square centimeter (10(2) to 10(5) grams per square centimeter) of H(2)O, if it is assumed that the loss rate is uniform over geologic time. Heretofore, exospheric escape was considered to be the principal irreversible sink for H(2)O, but the loss rate was estimated to be only 10(8) per square centimeter per second. It is possible that surface oxidation may have had a minor effect on the supply of H(2)O in the regolith and polar caps."

Nature. —Infantile paralysis is an infectious and communicable disease which is caused by the invasion of the central nervous organs—the spinal cord and brain—of a minute, filterable micro-organism which has now been secured in artificial culture and as such is distinctly visible under the higher powers of the microscope. Location of the Micro-Organism or Virus in the Sick. —The virus of infantile paralysis, as the micro-organism causing it is termed, exists constantly in the central nervous organs and on the mucous membrane of the nose and throat and of the intestines in persons suffering from"
