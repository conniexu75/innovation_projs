https://openalex.org/W1999478182,"Geneticists study the gene; however, for epigeneticists, there is no obvious 'epigene'. Nevertheless, during the past year, more than 2,500 articles, numerous scientific meetings and a new journal were devoted to the subject of epigenetics. It encompasses some of the most exciting contemporary biology and is portrayed by the popular press as a revolutionary new science--an antidote to the idea that we are hard-wired by our genes. So what is epigenetics?"
https://openalex.org/W2090763917,"Midbrain dopamine neurons are key components of the brain's reward system, which is thought to guide reward-seeking behaviours. Although recent studies have shown how dopamine neurons respond to rewards and sensory stimuli predicting reward, it is unclear which parts of the brain provide dopamine neurons with signals necessary for these actions. Here we show that the primate lateral habenula, part of the structure called the epithalamus, is a major candidate for a source of negative reward-related signals in dopamine neurons. We recorded the activity of habenula neurons and dopamine neurons while rhesus monkeys were performing a visually guided saccade task with positionally biased reward outcomes. Many habenula neurons were excited by a no-reward-predicting target and inhibited by a reward-predicting target. In contrast, dopamine neurons were excited and inhibited by reward-predicting and no-reward-predicting targets, respectively. Each time the rewarded and unrewarded positions were reversed, both habenula and dopamine neurons reversed their responses as the bias in saccade latency reversed. In unrewarded trials, the excitation of habenula neurons started earlier than the inhibition of dopamine neurons. Furthermore, weak electrical stimulation of the lateral habenula elicited strong inhibitions in dopamine neurons. These results suggest that the inhibitory input from the lateral habenula plays an important role in determining the reward-related activity of dopamine neurons."

https://openalex.org/W2120811265,"Active adult neurogenesis occurs in discrete brain regions of all mammals and is widely regarded as a neuronal replacement mechanism. Whether adult-born neurons make unique contributions to brain functions is largely unknown. Here we systematically characterized synaptic plasticity of retrovirally labeled adult-born dentate granule cells at different stages during their neuronal maturation. We identified a critical period between 1 and 1.5 months of the cell age when adult-born neurons exhibit enhanced long-term potentiation with increased potentiation amplitude and decreased induction threshold. Furthermore, such enhanced plasticity in adult-born neurons depends on developmentally regulated synaptic expression of NR2B-containing NMDA receptors. Our study demonstrates that adult-born neurons exhibit the same classic critical period plasticity as neurons in the developing nervous system. The transient nature of such enhanced plasticity may provide a fundamental mechanism allowing adult-born neurons within the critical period to serve as major mediators of experience-induced plasticity while maintaining stability of the mature circuitry."

https://openalex.org/W2074775898,"microRNAs (miRNAs) bind to Argonaute (Ago) proteins and inhibit translation or promote degradation of mRNA targets. Human let-7 miRNA inhibits translation initiation of mRNA targets in an m(7)G cap-dependent manner and also appears to block protein production, but the molecular mechanism(s) involved is unknown and the role of Ago proteins in translational regulation remains elusive. Here we identify a motif (MC) within the Mid domain of Ago proteins, which bears significant similarity to the m(7)G cap-binding domain of eIF4E, an essential translation initiation factor. We identify conserved aromatic residues within the MC motif of human Ago2 that are required for binding to the m(7)G cap and for translational repression but do not affect the assembly of Ago2 with miRNA or its catalytic activity. We propose that Ago2 represses the initiation of mRNA translation by binding to the m(7)G cap of mRNA targets, thus likely precluding the recruitment of eIF4E."

https://openalex.org/W1980073907,"Neuregulin-1 (NRG1) signaling participates in numerous neurodevelopmental processes. Through linkage analysis, nrg1 has been associated with schizophrenia, although its pathophysiological role is not understood. The prevailing models of schizophrenia invoke hypofunction of the glutamatergic synapse and defects in early development of hippocampal-cortical circuitry. Here, we show that the erbB4 receptor, as a postsynaptic target of NRG1, plays a key role in activity-dependent maturation and plasticity of excitatory synaptic structure and function. Synaptic activity leads to the activation and recruitment of erbB4 into the synapse. Overexpressed erbB4 selectively enhances AMPA synaptic currents and increases dendritic spine size. Preventing NRG1/erbB4 signaling destabilizes synaptic AMPA receptors and leads to loss of synaptic NMDA currents and spines. Our results indicate that normal activity-driven glutamatergic synapse development is impaired by genetic deficits in NRG1/erbB4 signaling leading to glutamatergic hypofunction. These findings link proposed effectors in schizophrenia: NRG1/erbB4 signaling perturbation, neurodevelopmental deficit, and glutamatergic hypofunction.

Neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) mRNA and protein in the adult human brain.Neuroscience. 2004; 127: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, Okada and Corfas, 2004Okada M. Corfas G. Neuregulin1 downregulates postsynaptic GABAA receptors at the hippocampal inhibitory synapse.Hippocampus. 2004; 14: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that NRG1/erbB4 signaling might be important for the function or development of glutamatergic synapse and circuitry in the brain. Here, by manipulating NRG1/erbB4 signaling at the hippocampal CA3-CA1 pathway, we demonstrate that postsynaptic erbB4 controls activity-dependent maturation and plasticity of excitatory synaptic structure and function. In particular, NRG/erbB4 signaling is positively regulated by synaptic activity. In turn, NRG/erbB4 signaling is also required for activity-dependent AMPA receptor synaptic incorporation and stabilization as well as maintenance of spine structure. As a result, interruption of signaling from presynaptic NRG1 to postsynaptic erbB4 leads to impaired synaptic development and depressed glutamatergic function. Our study indicates that NRG1/erbB4 signaling plays an important role in glutamatergic synapses and suggests a mechanism by which genetic or activity-dependent perturbation of this pathway can contribute to the etiology of schizophrenia. Previous biochemical studies have shown that erbB4 is enriched in the PSD fraction of excitatory synapse in the brain (Garcia et al., 2000Garcia R.A. Vasudevan K. Buonanno A.

However, it is not clear how erbB4 synaptic localization is achieved and how its localization and function are regulated. Since NRG1 processing or release is regulated by neuronal activity (Bao et al., 2003Bao J. Wolpowitz D. Role L.W. Talmage D.A. Back signaling by the Nrg-1 intracellular domain.J.

Protein processing and releases of neuregulin-1 are regulated in an activity-dependent manner.J. Neurochem. 2004; 91: 176-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that neuronal activity also regulates erbB4 activation and its recruitment and stabilization in the synapse. We predicted that synaptic erbB4 should have a higher phosphorylation level than extrasynaptic erbB4, and changing neuronal activity should change erbB4 phosphorylation and distribution. As expected, erbB4 isolated from the PSD fraction displayed a greater degree of phosphorylation than erbB4 in the brain homogenate (homogenate, 1 ± 0.05; PSD, 4.1 ± 0.55; n = 4 experiments; p < 0.01; Figure 1A), indicating synaptic erbB4 is preferentially activated. Moreover, increasing neuronal activity by treating hippocampal slices with picrotoxin for 1 hr markedly increased erbB4 phosphorylation in the PSD (control, 1 ± 0.1; picrotoxin, 5 ± 0.3; n = 4 experiments; p < 0.01; Figure 1B), whereas inhibiting neuronal activity by elevated concentration of MgCl2 (Zhu et al., 2000Zhu J.J. Esteban J.A. Hayashi Y. Malinow R. Postnatal synaptic potentiation: delivery of GluR4-containing AMPA receptors by spontaneous activity.Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1098-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) or TTX for 1 hr significantly decreased erbB4 phosphorylation in the PSD (control, 1 ± 0.12; MgCl2, 0.23 ± 0.08; TTX, 0.16 ± 0.06; n = 3 experiments; p < 0.01 for both MgCl2 and TTX compared with control; Figures 1C and 1D). Interestingly, inhibition of neuronal activity also reduced the total amount of erbB4 in the PSD fraction (Figures 1C and 1E). To directly visualize the subcellular distribution of erbB4, we tagged recombinant erbB4 in the extracellular region with a pH-sensitive form of GFP, super-ecliptic pHluorin (SEP), which we have previously shown to be a marker for receptors on the cell surface (Kopec et al., 2006Kopec C.D. Li B. Wei W. Boehm J. Malinow R. Glutamate receptor exocytosis and spine enlargement during chemically induced long-term potentiation.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 2000-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). After transfection of CA1 pyramidal cells in organotypic hippocampal slices with SEP-erbB4 together with a red fluorescent protein, tomato DsRed, as a cellular marker, the subcellular distribution of erbB4 was examined by dual-channel two-photon laser-scanning microscopy (TPLSM) (Kopec et al., 2006Kopec C.D. Li B. Wei W. Boehm J. Malinow R. Glutamate receptor exocytosis and spine enlargement during chemically induced long-term potentiation.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 2000-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). We found that SEP-erbB4 is highly enriched on the surface of spines of CA1 pyramidal cells (Figures 1F, 1G, and 1H). Consistent with the biochemical results, our imaging data also showed that erbB4 subcellular localization is regulated by neuronal activity. When transfected slices are maintained in normal media, SEP-erbB4 is highly enriched on the surface of spines. However, maintaining slices with elevated concentration of Mg2+ markedly reduced this enrichment (normal media, 47 ± 6.3, n = 212 spines from three cells; Mg2+-treated, 5.9 ± 0.1, n = 266 spines from four cells; p < 0.01; Figures 1G, 1H, and 1I). To test if erbB4 activation is required for its spine enrichment, we expressed an erbB4 mutant that lacks the kinase activity due to a point mutation in the kinase domain, which has been shown to function as a dominant-negative erbB4 (Yang et al., 2005Yang X.L. Huang Y.Z. Xiong W.C. Mei L. Neuregulin-induced expression of the acetylcholine receptor requires endocytosis of ErbB receptors.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2005; 28: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The kinase-dead erbB4 (SEP-erbB4-KD) is much less enriched on the surface of spine (11.1 ± 0.3, n = 417 spines from four cells; p < 0.01 compared with SEP-erbB4). Treatment with Mg2+ further reduced the enrichment of SEP-erbB4-KD on the spine surface (6.4 ± 0.2, n = 163 spines from four cells; p < 0.01 compared with nontreated SEP-erbB4-KD; Figures 1G, 1H, and 1I). These data indicate that neuronal activity regulates erbB4 activation and erbB4 activation is required for its synaptic recruitment or stabilization and suggest that erbB4 plays an important role in glutamatergic synapses. To test if erbB4 is important for synaptic function at hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapse, we first examined the effects of erbB4 overexpression on synaptic transmission by simultaneous recordings of evoked EPSCs from a CA1 pyramidal neuron overexpressing erbB4 and an adjacent control neuron. Overexpression of either nontagged erbB4 (together with GFP as a cellular marker) or SEP-erbB4 results in a potentiation of AMPA receptor (AMPAR)-mediated transmission (control, 1 ± 0.1; erbB4, 1.8 ± 0.2; n = 31 pairs; p < 0.01), but not NMDA receptor (NMDAR)- (control, 1 ± 0.2; erbB4, 0.83 ± 0.1; n = 27 pairs; p > 0.05) mediated transmission (Figure 2A). Overexpression of erbB4 isoform CYT-1, or isoform CYT-2, which lacks a PI3-kinase binding domain, had similar effects (data not shown), suggesting that the PI3-kinase binding domain is not required for potentiating AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission. To examine the function of endogenous erbB4, we employed RNA interference (RNAi) to knock down erbB4 protein level. Neurons were infected with a Lenti virus expressing, via a dual-promoter system, GFP (as a marker for infected cells) and short hairpin RNAs specif"
https://openalex.org/W2147376890,"The ability to stimulate select neurons in isolated tissue and in living animals is important for investigating their role in circuits and behavior. We show that the engineered light-gated ionotropic glutamate receptor (LiGluR), when introduced into neurons, enables remote control of their activity. Trains of action potentials are optimally evoked and extinguished by 380 nm and 500 nm light, respectively, while intermediate wavelengths provide graded control over the amplitude of depolarization. Light pulses of 1–5 ms in duration at ∼380 nm trigger precisely timed action potentials and EPSP-like responses or can evoke sustained depolarizations that persist for minutes in the dark until extinguished by a short pulse of ∼500 nm light. When introduced into sensory neurons in zebrafish larvae, activation of LiGluR reversibly blocks the escape response to touch. Our studies show that LiGluR provides robust control over neuronal activity, enabling the dissection and manipulation of neural circuitry in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1980682773,"Synaptotagmin-1 and -2 are known Ca2+ sensors for fast synchronous neurotransmitter release, but the potential Ca2+-sensor functions of other synaptotagmins in release remain uncharacterized. We now show that besides synaptotagmin-1 and -2, only synaptotagmin-9 (also called synaptotagmin-5) mediates fast Ca2+ triggering of release. Release induced by the three different synaptotagmin Ca2+ sensors exhibits distinct kinetics and apparent Ca2+ sensitivities, suggesting that the synaptotagmin isoform expressed by a neuron determines the release properties of its synapses. Conditional knockout mice producing GFP-tagged synaptotagmin-9 revealed that synaptotagmin-9 is primarily expressed in the limbic system and striatum. Acute deletion of synaptotagmin-9 in striatal neurons severely impaired fast synchronous release without changing the size of the readily-releasable vesicle pool. These data show that in mammalian brain, only synaptotagmin-1, -2, and -9 function as Ca2+ sensors for fast release, and that these synaptotagmins are differentially expressed to confer distinct release properties onto synapses formed by defined subsets of neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2078102941,"Astrocytes are considered the third component of the synapse, responding to neurotransmitter release from synaptic terminals and releasing gliotransmitters--including glutamate--in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner to affect neuronal synaptic activity. Many studies reporting astrocyte-driven neuronal activity have evoked astrocyte Ca(2+) increases by application of endogenous ligands that directly activate neuronal receptors, making astrocyte contribution to neuronal effect(s) difficult to determine. We have made transgenic mice that express a Gq-coupled receptor only in astrocytes to evoke astrocyte Ca(2+) increases using an agonist that does not bind endogenous receptors in brain. By recording from CA1 pyramidal cells in acute hippocampal slices from these mice, we demonstrate that widespread Ca(2+) elevations in 80%-90% of stratum radiatum astrocytes do not increase neuronal Ca(2+), produce neuronal slow inward currents, or affect excitatory synaptic activity. Our findings call into question the developing consensus that Ca(2+)-dependent glutamate release by astrocytes directly affects neuronal synaptic activity in situ."

https://openalex.org/W2125705356,"Neuregulin-1 (NRG1), a regulator of neural development, has been shown to regulate neurotransmission at excitatory synapses. Although ErbB4, a key NRG1 receptor, is expressed in glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)-positive neurons, little is known about its role in GABAergic transmission. We show that ErbB4 is localized at GABAergic terminals of the prefrontal cortex. Our data indicate a role of NRG1, both endogenous and exogenous, in regulation of GABAergic transmission. This effect was blocked by inhibition or mutation of ErbB4, suggesting the involvement of ErbB4. Together, these results indicate that NRG1 regulates GABAergic transmission via presynaptic ErbB4 receptors, identifying a novel function of NRG1. Because both NRG1 and ErbB4 have emerged as susceptibility genes of schizophrenia, these observations may suggest a mechanism for abnormal GABAergic neurotransmission in this disorder."
https://openalex.org/W2072583006,"It is often assumed that learning takes place by changing an otherwise stable neural representation. To test this assumption, we studied changes in the directional tuning of primate motor cortical neurons during reaching movements performed in familiar and novel environments. During the familiar task, tuning curves exhibited slow random drift. During learning of the novel task, random drift was accompanied by systematic shifts of tuning curves. Our analysis suggests that motor learning is based on a surprisingly unstable neural representation. To explain these results, we propose that motor cortex is a redundant neural network, i.e., any single behavior can be realized by multiple configurations of synaptic strengths. We further hypothesize that synaptic modifications underlying learning contain a random component, which causes wandering among synaptic configurations with equivalent behaviors but different neural representations. We use a simple model to explore the implications of these assumptions."

We report that PLAP-1/asporin is also expressed specifically and predominantly in the periodontal ligament (PDL) and that it negatively regulates the mineralization of PDL cells. In situ hybridization analysis revealed that PLAP-1/asporin was expressed specifically not only in the PDL of an erupted tooth but also in the dental follicle, which is the progenitor tissue of the PDL during tooth development. Overexpression of PLAP-1/asporin in mouse PDL-derived clone cells interfered with both naturally and bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2)-induced mineralization of the PDL cells. On the other hand, knockdown of PLAP-1/asporin transcript levels by RNA interference enhanced BMP-2-induced differentiation of PDL cells. Furthermore co-immunoprecipitation assays showed a direct interaction between PLAP-1/asporin and BMP-2 in vitro, and immunohistochemistry staining revealed the co-localization of PLAP-1/asporin and BMP-2 at the cellular level.

The collagenous fibers form a meshwork that stretches out between the cementum covering the root surface and the bone and is firmly anchored by Sharpey fibers. The periodontal ligament links the teeth to the alveolar bone proper, providing support, protection, and sensory input to the masticatory system (1Beertsen W. McCulloch C.A. Sodek J. Periodontol. 2000. 1997; 13: 20-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). In addition, the PDL also contributes to tooth nutrition, homeostasis, and the repair of damaged periodontal tissue. PDL cells originate in part from the ectomesenchyme of the investing layer of the dental follicle; this developmental origin gives these cells differential properties. Recently it has been revealed that PDL tissue possesses multipotential mesenchymal stem cells that can differentiate into mineralized tissue-forming cells such as osteoblasts and cementoblasts (2Bartold P.M. Shi S. Gronthos S. Periodontol. 2000. 2006; 40: 164-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 3Seo B.M. Miura M. Gronthos S. Bartold P.M. Batouli S. Brahim J. Young M. Robey P.G. Wang C.Y. Shi S. Lancet. 2004; 364: 149-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2424) Google Scholar). In fact, in vitro maintained PDL cells have various osteoblast-like properties, including the capacity to form mineralized nodules, expression of bone-associated markers, and response to bone-inductive factors such as bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) (4Cho M.I. Matsuda N. Lin W.L. Moshier A. Ramakrishnan P.R. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1992; 50: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 5Arceo N. Sauk J.J. Moehring J. Foster R.A. Somerman M.J. J. Periodontol. 1991; 62: 499-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, PDL tissue is never ossified in vivo under normal circumstances. This suggests that some mechanisms exist to constitutively prevent unorchestrated osteogenesis and cementogenesis by PDL cells. Previously we have reported the gene expression profile, described the quantitative aspects of the genes active in the human PDL, and identified a novel gene, PLAP-1, that is frequently expressed in human PDL tissue (6Yamada S. Murakami S. Matoba R. Ozawa Y. Yokokoji T. Nakahira Y. Ikezawa K. Takayama S. Matsubara K. Okada H. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 275: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). An identical gene has been reported by other groups and named asporin because of its unique aspartic acid repeat at the N terminus of the mature protein (7Lorenzo P. Aspberg A. Onnerfjord P.

The PLAP-1/asporin gene encodes a novel small leucine-rich repeat proteoglycan (SLRP) protein that resembles decorin and biglycan. Interestingly the expression of the PLAP-1/asporin gene was shown to be enhanced during the course of PDL cell cytodifferentiation into mineralized tissue-forming cells and is tightly regulated by BMP-2 (9Yamada S. Ozawa Y. Tomoeda M. Matoba R. Matsubara K. Murakami S. J. Dent. Res. 2006; 85: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Furthermore a recent report demonstrated that there is a significant association between a polymorphism in the aspartic acid repeat of the gene encoding PLAP-1/asporin and osteoarthritis, which is characterized by the progressive loss of articular cartilage (10Kizawa H. Kou I. Iida A. Sudo A. Miyamoto Y. Fukuda A. Mabuchi A. Kotani A. Kawakami A. Yamamoto S. Uchida A. Nakamura K. Notoya K. Nakamura Y. Ikegawa S. Nat.

Genet. 2006; 51: 151-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 12Ikegawa S. Kawamura S. Takahashi A. Nakamura T. Kamatani N. Arthritis Res. Ther. 2006; 8: 403Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that PLAP-1/asporin functioned as a negative regulator of chondrogenesis in vitro by inhibiting TGF-β function (10Kizawa H. Kou I. Iida A. Sudo A. Miyamoto Y. Fukuda A. Mabuchi A. Kotani A. Kawakami A. Yamamoto S. Uchida A. Nakamura K. Notoya K. Nakamura Y. Ikegawa S. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 138-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Both articular cartilage and the PDL are rich in extracellular matrix and have a similar characteristic function, which involves cushioning the mechanical forces of the joints and teeth, respectively. These results suggest the possible involvement of PLAP-1/asporin in the regulation of PDL differentiation into hard tissue-forming cells. To gain insight into PLAP-1/asporin functions in the PDL, we first examined the tissue distribution of PLAP-1/asporin in vivo. In situ hybridization analysis demonstrated specific and dominant expression of PLAP-1/asporin mRNA in the PDL. Furthermore during tooth development, strong mRNA expression of PLAP-1/asporin was observed in the dental follicle, which is the progenitor tissue that forms cementum, alveolar bone, and the PDL. We then examined an in vitro model of PDL differentiation that uses a PDL cell clone derived from mouse PDL tissues. Interestingly overexpression of PLAP-1/asporin in PDL cells repressed PDL differentiation and mineralization probably through BMP-2 signaling pathways. Conversely small interference RNA knockdown of PLAP-1/asporin in PDL cells augmented PDL differentiation induced by BMP-2. Furthermore co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that PLAP-1/asporin could bind to BMP-2 in vitro, and two-color immunohistochemistry staining showed co-localization of PLAP-1/asporin and BMP-2 at the cellular level. These data showed that PLAP-1/asporin is a periodontal ligament-specific gene that negatively regulates PDL differentiation and mineralization to ensure that the periodontal ligament is not ossified and to maintain homeostasis of the tooth-supporting system. RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from mouse tissues and cells using the QIA RNA isolation kit (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA) and then purified using the RNAeasy kit (Qiagen). Purified total RNA was reverse transcribed with SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) with oligo(dT) primer. All PCRs were carried out using AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science). The primers used in this study are listed in supplemental Table 1. Probe Preparation—We subcloned the 709-bp 5′-end/EcoRI fragment, including the 5′-untranslated region and a portion of the open reading frame of mouse PLAP-1/asporin gene, into the pGEM-T easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The plasmid containing the PLAP-1/asporin insert was linearized by digestion with NcoI and SalI restriction enzymes to generate antisense and sense strands, respectively. In the presence of digoxigenin-labeled 11-dUTP (Roche Applied Science), the antisense and sense cRNA probes were prepared by in vitro transcription using SP6 and T7 RNA polymerases, respectively. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA (15 μg) isolated from the maxillary and tibial tissues of 4-week-old BALB/c mice was electrophoresed on a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose filter (Roche Applied Science). The membranes were then hybridized overnight at 68 °C with digoxigenin-dUTP-labeled antisense single-stranded RNA probes specific for PLAP-1/asporin as described above. The blot was washed under high stringency (2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature) and low stringency (0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 68 °C) conditions. The reaction was then blocked using the DIG (digoxigenin) Wash and Block Buffer Set (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The hybrids were detected using the anti-digoxigenin-alkaline phosphatase Fab fragment (Roche Applied Science). Tissue Preparation and in Situ Hybridization—To analyze erupted teeth, 4-week-old BALB/c mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of Nembutal (50 mg/kg of body weight) and intracardially perfused with physiological saline containing 5 units/ml heparin (Aventis Pharma, Tokyo, Japan) for 2–3 min followed by perfusion with 5% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at 4 °C for 15 min. The upper jaw samples containing the teeth were excised, and most of the soft tissue was removed. All of the samples were further fixed by immersion in the fixative described above overnight at 4 °C and then demineralized in buffered 10% EDTA at 4 °C under agitation for 7 days. The EDTA solution was changed daily. After processing, the blocks were rinsed and embedded in paraffin. Serial 5-μm-thick sections were cut in the transverse direction for the first molars and mounted onto aminopropylsilane-coated slides. Representative sections from each block were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. In situ hybridization of developing tooth germ was carried out on the fresh frozen horizontal sections of BALB/c mice fetal heads. The sections were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, and this was followed by acetylation. In situ hybridization was performed as described previously (13Toyosawa S. Shintani S. Fujiwara T. Ooshima T. Sato A. Ijuhin N. Komori T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 2017-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). We used the cRNA probe of PLAP-1/asporin described above. The sections were deparaffinized in xylene, hydrated, postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and sequentially treated with 10 mg/ml proteinase K at 37 °C for 30 min and with 0.1 m triethanolamine containing 0.25% acetic anhydride for 10 min. Hybridization was done at 50 °C under high stringency conditions using the denatured probes at concentrations of about 1 ng/ml in a freshly prepared hybridization mixture. All samples were hybridized overnight at 50 °C. Posthybridization treatment included incubation with RNase A at 37 °C for 30 min followed by thorough washes. The washed slides were incubated with anti-digoxigenin monoclonal antibody (Roche Applied Science) overnight at 4 °C. After the application of biotinylated rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), the sections were incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin (Dako) and then with nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate solution (Roche Applied Science) for 3–5 h to visualize the hybridized sites. The activity of endogenous bone alkaline phosphatases in these specimens was inhibited by heating during paraffin embedding at 60 °C for 6 h. Negative controls for in situ hybridization were obtained by substituting the antisense probe with its sense probe. Cloning of Mouse PDL Cell Line—Mouse PDL cells were obtained from the PDL tissues of the molar teeth obtained from 2.5-week-old BALB/c mice. The PDL tissues were scraped from the middle of one-third of the root surface and transferred into 24-well plates. The outgrown cells from the explants were cultured in α-MEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 10 ng/ml FGF-2 (Kaken, Kyoto, Japan), and 60 μg/ml kanamycin (Meijiseika, Tokyo, Japan). The cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. At subconfluence, the cells were passaged with trypsin-EDTA and cultured on tissue culture plates. After 12 subcultures, the cell suspension was diluted and plated on 96-well plates at a ratio of one or two cells per well. Cell cloning was done twice using the limiting dilution method in α-MEM supplemented with 10% FCS and 100 ng/ml FGF-2. Twenty-nine clonal cell lines were obtained and classified by alkaline phosphatase (ALPase) activity. One clonal cell line possessing the highest ALPase activity was selected and named MPDL22. The preosteoblastic cell line MC3T3-E1 was a generous gift from Prof. Toshiyuki Yoneda (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan). Plasmids—We cloned the open reading frame of mouse PLAP-1/asporin gene into pCl-neo (Promega). We confirmed whole sequences of the insert by DNA sequencing and named it pCl-neo-PLAP-1/asporin. We used the pCl-neo plasmid vector without the insert as a negative control. We also cloned the open reading frame of mouse PLAP-1/asporin into p3XFLAG-CMV-14 (Sigma) in which the 3XFLAG protein can be fused to the C terminus of the insert. We named it p3XFLAG-PLAP-1/asporin. We used the p3XFLAG-CMV-14 vector without the insert as a negative control. Cell Culture and Transfection—We maintained the MPDL22 cells in a standard medium of α-MEM supplemented with both 10% FCS and 100 ng/ml FGF-2. For stable transfections, we plated 5 × 104 of the MPDL22 cells/well in a 6-well plate. After 12 h, we transfected the cells with the pCl-neo-PLAP-1/asporin expression vector or the p3XFLAG-PLAP-1/asporin expression vector using Effectene transfection reagent (Invitrogen) in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol. After 24 h, we added G418 (400 μg/ml) to the culture medium to initiate drug selection. After selection, we evaluated PLAP-1/asporin expression using RT-PCR. We then established the stable transfectants overexpressing PLAP-1/asporin. To differentiate transfected MPDL22 cells into hard tissueforming cells in vitro, we cultured cells in a 24-well plate until they reached confluence. At this point, we removed FGF-2 from the culture medium and replaced the standard medium with α-MEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid (mineralization medium). We replaced the mineralization medium every 3 days. During the culture of the transfectant cells, we always added 400 μg/ml G418 to the mineralization medium. To examine the effects of PLAP-1/asporin on BMP-2-induced cytodifferentiation, transfectant cells were cultured in standard medium in a 24-well plate until they reached confluence. On the next day, the medium was replaced with FCS-free α-MEM. After serum deprivation for 24 h, the cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml BMP-2 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) in FCS-free α-MEM. The stimulated cells were then harvested at 24, 48, and 72 h after stimulation to assess ALPase activity. RNA Interference of PLAP-1/Asporin—The small interference RNA oligonucleotide against mouse PLAP-1/asporin was designed according to Reynolds et al. (14Reynolds A. Leake D. Boese Q. Scaringe S. Marshall W.S. Khvorova A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 326-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1631) Google Scholar). The target sequences included 5′-CGA TGA TGA CGA CAA CTC T-3′ and 5′-CCT GCA ACA TTT CGT TGT G-3′, which are located at nucleotides 326–344 and 1260–1278 of the mouse PLAP-1/asporin gene (GenBank™ accession number NM_025711), respectively. The pSilencer RNA interference kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) was used for generating small hairpin RNA (shRNA). We used a negative control shRNA oligonucleotide from the Ambion kit that is unrelated to PLAP-1/asporin. Briefly a double-stranded DNA oligonucleotide containing the shRNA and BamHI and HindIII overhangs was cloned into the BamHI and HindIII sites of the pSilencer 2.1-U6 hygro vector (Ambion), an expression vector designed to express shRNAs using the U6 promoter. The constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The shRNA vectors were introduced into MPDL22 cells by Nucleofection (Amaxa, Gaithersburg, MD) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. We started drug selection by hygromycin (600 μg/ml) 24 h after transfection. Alkaline Phosphatase Activity and Mineralization Assay—ALPase activity was assessed according to the procedure of Bessey et al. (15Bessey O. Lowry O. Brock M. J. Biol. Chem. 1946; 164: 321-329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly after washing twice with PBS, the cells were homogenized in a glass homogenizer in 1 ml of 0.9% NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100 at 4 °C and then centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000 × g. ALPase activity in the supernatant was measured using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as a substrate. Subsequently the supernatant was mixed with 0.5 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 9.0) containing 0.5 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate and 0.5 mm MgCl2. Next the samples were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and the reaction was stopped by addition of 0.25 ml of 1 n NaOH. Using a spectrometer, hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate was monitored as a change in A410; p-nitrophenol was used as a standard. One unit of activity was defined as the enzyme activity hydrolyzing 1 nmol of p-nitrophenyl phosphate in 30 min. The histochemical method that was used for staining calcified nodules was done using the alizarin red staining method of Dahl (16Dahl L.K. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1952; 80: 474-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The cell layers were washed twice with PBS and then fixed in dehydrated ethanol. After fixation, the cell layers were stained with 1% alizarin red S in 0.1% NH4OH (pH 6.3–6.5) for 5 min. The dishes were washed with H2O and then observed microscopically. Cellular DNA Contents—DNA content was measured using a modification of the method of Labarca and Paigen (17Labarca C. Paigen K. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 102: 344-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (4550) Google Scholar). The cells were washed with PBS and then homogenized at 4 °C in 1 ml of 2 m NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). After centrifugation at 12, 000 × g for 10 min, 25 μlof5 μg/ml bisbenzimidazole (Hoechst 33258) were added to 100 μl of the supernatant. After excitation at 356 nm, the fluorescent spectra of the emission at 458 nm were monitored using a spectrophotometer (microplate reader MTP-32, Corona Electric, Ibaragi, Japan). The concentration of DNA in the samples was determined using a standard curve based on various concentrations of calf thymus DNA. [3H]Thymidine Incorporation Assay—The proliferation activity of the PLAP-1/asporin overexpressing transfectant cells and PLAP-1/asporin shRNA transfectant cells was assessed by measuring the [3H]thymidine incorporation. The cells were seeded to 24-well culture dishes (1 × 104 cells/well). On the next day, the medium was replaced with FCS-free α-MEM. After serum deprivation for 24 h, the cells were stimulated with α-MEM containing 10% FCS for 24 h. DNA synthesis was measured by pulsing wells with 2 μCi/well [3H]thymidine for 4 h. The cells were then washed three times with PBS, and soluble radioactivity was extracted with 5% trichloroacetic acid. The cells were solubilized in 1 n NaOH, and lysate was brought to a neutral pH by addition of 6 n HCl. The incorporated radioactivity was determined in a liquid scintillation counter (Aloka, Tokyo, Japan) using an aqueous scintillation mixture. Expression and Purification of Recombinant PLAP-1/Asporin—Recombinant mouse PLAP-1/asporin protein was generated from baculovirus-infected silkworms as described previously (18Ishihara K. Satoh I. Nittoh T. Kanaya T. Okazaki H. Suzuki T. Koyama T. Sakamoto T. Ide T. Ohuchi K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 48-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly we subcloned the full length of mouse PLAP-1/asporin cDNA into the transfer vector pSYNGCH_Th that was to be fused to a His tag in the C terminus. Then the plasmid was co-transfected with the linearized baculovirus DNA BacDuo (Katakura Industries, Saitama, Japan) into the Spodoptera frugipedra cell line SF21AE. Three days after transfection, the culture supernatants containing the recombinant baculovirus were harvested. The recombinant virus was injected into the body cavities of silkworm larvae (8.0 × 105 plaque-forming units/head). The whole body of the infected larvae was mechanically blended in lysis buffer (20 mm Na2PO4, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm benzamide, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA). Homogenized lysates were centrifuged at 80,000 × g for 60 min, and the supernatants were then diluted five times by dilution buffer (20 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 0.3% Zwittergent 3-14). The diluted solution was loaded on a nickel-Sepharose column. After washing with washing buffer (20 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 0.3% Zwittergent 3-14), His-tagged mouse PLAP-1/asporin was eluted by elution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.3 m NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Zwittergent 3-14, 0.05% 2-mercaptoethanol). To confirm the quality of recombinant protein, the elution sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE (5–20% gradient gel). The proteins separated in the gel were stained using Silver Stain II kit (Wako, Osaka, Japan). After the SDS-PAGE, electroblotting onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes was performed. The membranes were incubated in TBST (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) with 5% (w/v) nonfat dried milk at 4 °C overnight, washed in TBST three times, and incubated with primary antibody in TBST containing 5% milk for 1 h at room temperature. The primary antibody was a rabbit polyclonal anti-polyhistidine antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) at 1:1,000. After further washing in TBST, membranes were incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences), and immunoreactive proteins were detected using the ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). Co-immunoprecipitation Assay and Western Blotting—Recombinant PLAP-1/asporin protein (1.2 μg) was incubated with 3.0 μg of BMP-2 for 1 h at 4 °C in 0.5 ml of binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). Then 7.5 μl of anti-polyhistidine antibody-conjugated agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or 40 μl of anti-BMP-2 antibody (Calbiochem-Novabiochem)-conjugated Protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) were added to the reaction and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The precipitates were washed three times with binding buffer, subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE, and then electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were incubated in TBST with 5% (w/v) nonfat dried milk at 4 °C overnight, washed in TBST three times, and incubated with primary antibody in TBST containing 5% milk for 1 h at room temperature. The primary antibodies were a rabbit polyclonal anti-polyhistidine antibody at 1:1,000 and a goat polyclonal anti-BMP-2/4 antibody (R&D Systems) at 1:250. After further washing in TBST, membranes were incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) or anti-goat IgG secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and immunoreactive proteins were detected using the ECL kit. Immunohistochemistry—The FLAG-tagged PLAP-1/asporin-transfected MPDL22 cells were seeded on a collagen type I-coated 10-mm glass-bottomed dish (Matsunami, Osaka, Japan). On the next day, to detect BMP-2 binding, the cells were preincubated with BMP-2 (10 μg/ml) for 2 h at 37 °C and washed with PBS three times. The cells were fixed in a mixture of methanol:acetone (1:1) for 1 min at room temperature, then washed with PBS three times, and pre-blocked in PBS containing 10% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature. The BMP-2-positive cells were identified by incubation with biotinylated anti-BMP-2/4 antibody (2.5 μg/ml, R&D Systems) overnight at 4 °C and subsequently streptavidin-rhodamine red (Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. Then the cells were washed, and the nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Statistical Analysis—All of the experiments in this study were conducted at least three times. The data shown are representative results. Experimental values are given as means ± S.D. of triplicate assays. The statistical significance of the differences between two means was examined by the Mann-Whitney U test; p values less than 0.05 were considered to indicate a significant difference. Specific Expression of PLAP-1/Asporin in the Periodontal Ligament—We analyzed PLAP-1/asporin expression in various mouse tissues. RT-PCR analysis revealed dominant expression of PLAP-1/asporin in the maxilla, which contains teeth and periodontal tissues consisting of gingiva, cementum, alveolar bone, and the PDL (Fig. 1A). Our previous study showed dominant expression of PLAP-1/asporin in human PDL tissue (6Yamada S. Murakami S. Matoba R. Ozawa Y. Yokokoji T. Nakahira Y. Ikezawa K. Takayama S. Matsubara K. Okada H. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 275: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). On the other hand, PLAP-1/asporin mRNA has been shown to be expressed abundantly in the heart in both mice and humans (7Lorenzo P. Aspberg A. Onnerfjord P. Bayliss M.T. Neame P.J. Heinegard D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12201-12211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 8Henry S.P. Takanosu M. Boyd T.C. Mayne P.M. Eberspaecher H. Zhou W. de Crombrugghe B. Hook M. Mayne R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12212-12221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). However, as Fig. 1A indicates, the maxilla, which contains PDL tissues, had a higher expression of PLAP-1/asporin mRNA than the heart (Fig. 1A). These results prompted us to investigate the specific expression of PLAP-1/asporin in periodontal tissues. Next we performed Northern blot analysis to assess the in vivo expression of PLAP-1/asporin mRNA in the maxilla, which includes both teeth and periodontal tissues. We selected the 5′-region of PLAP-1/asporin mRNA, which has nucleotide sequences specific to PLAP-1/asporin, to use as a probe. The analysis revealed specific detection of the 2.3-kb transcript of PLAP-1/asporin in the maxilla (Fig. 1B)"
https://openalex.org/W2045203721,"Fragile X syndrome, caused by a mutation in the Fmr1 gene, is characterized by mental retardation. Several studies reported the absence of long-term potentiation (LTP) at neocortical synapses in Fmr1 knockout (FMR1-KO) mice, but underlying cellular mechanisms are unknown. We find that in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of FMR1-KO mice, spike-timing-dependent LTP (tLTP) is not so much absent, but rather, the threshold for tLTP induction is increased. Calcium signaling in dendrites and spines is compromised. First, dendrites and spines more often fail to show calcium transients. Second, the activity of L-type calcium channels is absent in spines. tLTP could be restored by improving reliability and amplitude of calcium signaling by increasing neuronal activity. In FMR1-KO mice that were raised in enriched environments, tLTP was restored to WT levels. Our results show that mechanisms for synaptic plasticity are in place in the FMR1-KO mouse PFC, but require stronger neuronal activity to be triggered."
https://openalex.org/W2087173527,"A characterization of the factors that control collagen fibril formation is critical for an understanding of tissue organization and the mechanisms that lead to fibrosis. SPARC (secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine) is a counter-adhesive protein that binds collagens. Herein we show that collagen fibrils in SPARC-null skin from mice 1 month of age were inefficient in fibril aggregation and accumulated in the diameter range of 60-70 nm, a proposed intermediate in collagen fibril growth. In vitro, procollagen I produced by SPARC-null dermal fibroblasts demonstrated an initial preferential association with cell layers, in comparison to that produced by wild-type fibroblasts. However, the collagen I produced by SPARC-null cells was not efficiently incorporated into detergent-insoluble fractions. Coincident with an initial increase in cell association, greater amounts of total collagen I were present as processed forms in SPARC-null versus wild-type cells. Addition of recombinant SPARC reversed collagen I association with cell layers and decreased the processing of procollagen I in SPARC-null cells. Although collagen fibers formed on the surface of SPARC-null fibroblasts earlier than those on wild-type cells, fibers on SPARC-null fibroblasts did not persist. We conclude that SPARC mediates the association of procollagen I with cells, as well as its processing and incorporation into the extracellular matrix.

Matricellular proteins are defined as proteins that are associated with the extracellular matrix (ECM) 2The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; WT, wild type; SPARC, secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine; rSPARC, recombinant secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine.2The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; WT, wild type; SPARC, secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine; rSPARC, recombinant secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine. but are not considered structural components of the ECM, in contrast to classical ECM proteins such as laminin and collagen I (1Bornstein P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 503-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 2Bornstein P. Sage E.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 608-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). SPARC is a prototypic matricellular protein that exhibits counter-adhesive and anti-proliferative activity when added to cultured cells (3Brekken R.A. Sage E.H. Matrix Biol. 2001; 19: 816-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). SPARC has been shown to bind to a number of ECM proteins including collagens I, III, and IV (3Brekken R.A. Sage E.H. Matrix Biol. 2001; 19: 816-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Expression of SPARC is elevated during development and decreases upon differentiation in a majority of tissues (4Bradshaw A.D. Sage E.H. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 1049-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). However, expression of SPARC persists in tissues in which ECM remodeling is ongoing, such as bone and gut epithelia (4Bradshaw A.D. Sage E.H. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 1049-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Increased levels of SPARC are detected in response to injury where ECM remodeling is initiated, with fibroses in liver, lungs, and kidney, and in the skin of individuals with scleroderma (5Frizell E. Liu S.L. Abraham A. Ozaki I. Eghbali M. Sage E.H. Zern M.A. Hepatology. 1995; 21: 847-854PubMed Google Scholar, 6Kuhn C. Mason R.J. Am. J.

Hence, SPARC expression patterns implicate this protein as an important mediator of collagen I deposition and/or remodeling. The α1(I) and α2(I) subunits of procollagen I are synthesized with N- and C-propeptides that are enzymatically released by specific proteases to yield processed collagen I (9Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 403-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar). Processing of procollagen I to collagen I is essential for correct assembly of collagen fibrils. Spatial and temporal regulation of procollagen processing has been proposed as a potential regulatory event in collagen fibril assembly (9Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 403-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar). For example, antibodies against the N-propeptide of collagen I were immunolocalized exclusively to the surface of collagen fibrils that were 20-40 nm in diameter (10Fleischmajer R. Timpl R. Tuderman L. Raisher L. Wiestner M. Perlish J.S. Graves P.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7360-7364Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Retention of the propeptides of procollagen I following incorporation into fibrils might present a steric hindrance to fibril fusion and thus limit fibril expansion. Alternatively, Watson et al. (11Watson R.B. Holmes D.F. Graham H.K. Nusgens B.V. Kadler K.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) reported that pN collagen I (procollagen I with N-propeptides retained) could be incorporated into collagen fibrils with the N-propeptide accommodated within the fibril. The authors suggested that the N-propeptide acts to enhance collagen fibril aggregation (11Watson R.B. Holmes D.F. Graham H.K. Nusgens B.V. Kadler K.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In this case, premature processing of the N-propeptide would limit fibril expansion. The factors that influence the spatial and temporal regulation of procollagen I conversion to collagen I are predicted to have a profound influence on collagen deposition (9Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 403-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar). SPARC-null mice display a number of phenotypic abnormalities, the majority of which are manifested in aberrant ECM structure and assembly, consistent with a function of SPARC as a modulator of cell-ECM interactions (4Bradshaw A.D. Sage E.H. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 1049-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Adult SPARC-null mice exhibit decreased amounts of collagen in skin and bone (12Bradshaw A.D. Puolakkainen P. Dasgupta J. Davidson J.M. Wight T.N. Sage E.H. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2003; 120: 949-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 13Delany A.M. Kalajzic I. Bradshaw A.D. Sage E.H. Canalis E. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 2588-2596Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In addition, fibrotic deposition of collagen is diminished in the absence of SPARC. For example, streptozoticin-induced renal fibrosis in SPARC-null mice was reduced in comparison to that of wild-type (14Taneda S. Pippin J.W. Sage E.H. Hudkins K.L. Takeuchi Y. Couser W.G. Alpers C.E. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: 968-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Increased expression of SPARC is associated with collagen production, and the lack of SPARC results in decreased collagen accumulation. SPARC is therefore implicated as a key regulator of collagen incorporation in tissues. To investigate further the mechanisms by which SPARC influences collagen deposition, we cultured SPARC-null and wild-type (WT) primary dermal fibroblasts and characterized collagen I maturation and fiber formation in vitro. Our studies indicate that, in the absence of SPARC, an initial increase in the levels of procollagen I in cell layers was coupled with an increase in the conversion of procollagen I to collagen I. The addition of recombinant SPARC (rSPARC) reduced the levels of procollagen I associated with cell layers and was accompanied by a decrease in conversion of procollagen I. Enhanced association of procollagen I with SPARC-null cells did not lead to a greater incorporation of collagen into detergent-insoluble fractions. In fact, SPARC-null fibroblasts demonstrated substantially less incorporation of collagen into detergent-insoluble fractions after extended culture. Likewise, collagen fibers formed sooner on the surface of SPARC-null cells but did not persist, in comparison to fibers on WT cells. Reagents—Cell culture reagents were from Invitrogen. rSPARC was generated by baculovirus infection of insect cells and purified as described in Ref. 15Bradshaw A.D. Bassuk J.A. Francki A. Sage E.H.

The majority of animals used in these experiments were 2-3 months of age. Dermal fibroblasts were cultured in growth media supplemented with 50 μg/ml sodium ascorbate to induce collagen production and secretion as indicated. All experiments were performed with dermal fibroblasts between passages 1 and 4. Analysis of ECM Production and Deposition—Primary dermal fibroblasts plated at equal concentrations were labeled with 25 μCi/ml [2,3,4,5-3H]proline (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in growth media for 18-24 h to assess collagen production in media and cell layers from WT and SPARC-null cells.

Briefly, equal numbers of age-matched WT and SPARC-null dermal fibroblasts were cultured in growth media in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without phenol red and supplemented with ascorbate (50 μg/ml) for the designated periods. Detergent-soluble and -insoluble cell layers were collected as stated above and placed in 6 n HCl for hydrolysis. Media fractions were freeze-dried, resuspended in 6 n HCl, and hydrolyzed at 120 °C. Cell extracts were hydrolyzed according to the same protocol. Samples were neutralized with 4 n NaOH. Samples and standards (l-hydroxyproline, Sigma) were incubated for 20 min at room temperature with chloramine T followed by addition of Ehrlich reagent (3.75 g of p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde, 15 ml of 1-propanol, 6.5 ml of perchloric acid (60%) in 25 ml) for 20 min at 60 °C. Absorbance of standards and samples were read at λ = 558 nm. Values were calculated from a standard curve generated for each analysis. Amounts of total protein in detergent-soluble fractions were determined by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assays according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). After separation by SDS-PAGE, metabolically labeled proteins were detected by fluorography on X-Omat film. Immunoblot analysis was performed by transfer of separated proteins to nitrocellulose and detection with anti-murine collagen I antibodies. Chemiluminescence was used to detect secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Quantification of protein bands was performed with NIH Image software. Metabolically labeled conditioned media generated by equal numbers of WT and SPARC-null cells grown in ascorbate for 18-24 h were incubated with an anti-N-propeptide rabbit polyclonal antibody against recombinant mouse N-propeptide that was produced in insect cells, or polyclonal anti-murine SPARC antibodies (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Primary antibodies were precipitated with protein A/G-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare). Immune complexes were boiled in SDS-PAGE buffer with dithiothreitol, separated by SDS-PAGE, and exposed to film. Pulse-chase experiments were performed by labeling equal amounts of WT and SPARC-null fibroblasts in growth media. Ascorbate was added ∼2 h prior to pulse labeling with 25 μCi/ml [3H]proline for 12 min (pulse label). The pulse labeling media were removed, and the cell layer was rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline followed by incubation in chase media (growth media with ascorbate and 1 mg/ml unlabeled proline) for the indicated time periods. Cell layers were collected in SDS-PAGE buffer with dithiothreitol, and proteins were resolved on 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Bands representing procollagen and collagen I were detected by fluorography and were quantified by the use of NIH Image software. Immunohistochemistry—Age-matched WT and SPARC-null cells were plated in equal numbers on glass coverslips in growth media. Cells were treated with 50 μg/ml ascorbate and were grown for the indicated number of days. Cell layers were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.5) for 30-45 min. Coverslips were blocked in 1% normal goat serum in Tris-buffered saline (blocking solution) prior to addition of anti-murine collagen I antibodies (1:200 dilution in blocking solution) or anti-cellular fibronectin (1:200 in blocking solution, Sigma). Primary antibodies were detected with goat anti-mouse fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson Laboratories). Coverslips were mounted in Anti-Fade reagent (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and were viewed on a Leica microscope equipped for epifluorescence. EM of Collagen Fibrils from 1-Month-old Mice—Thin collagen fibrils characteristic of young dermis undergo lateral fusion to generate collagen fibrils of increasing diameter. We have reported that collagen fibrils in adult SPARC-null skin were smaller and more uniform in diameter than those of WT mice (12Bradshaw A.D. Puolakkainen P. Dasgupta J. Davidson J.M. Wight T.N. Sage E.H. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2003; 120: 949-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). We sought to determine whether the absence of SPARC was associated with phenotypic differences in collagen fibril morphology in the dermis during times characterized by active collagen fibril aggregation. As shown in Fig. 1, a more limited range of fibril diameters was observed in SPARC-null skin in comparison to WT at 1 month of age. Although the average diameter of WT fibrils was slightly larger than SPARC-null fibrils (60.2 versus 53.8 nm), the standard deviation of the WT fibril population was 24, whereas that of SPARC-null fibrils was 14.6, which is indicative of a more restricted range of fibril diameters in null dermis. Whereas collagen fibrils as large as 220 nm were observed in WT dermis, SPARC-null fibrils larger than 110 nm were not found. The frequency of SPARC-null collagen fibrils with diameters of ∼60-70 nm was disproportionately represented in SPARC-null skin. Thirty-seven percent of measured SPARC-null collagen fibrils were ∼60-70 nm in diameter, whereas 20% of WT fibrils were in this range. We conclude that in the absence of SPARC, collagen fibril accretion is compromised, as early as 1 month after birth. Production and Deposition of Collagen I by SPARC-null Dermal Fibroblasts—Primary dermal fibroblasts from age-matched WT and SPARC-null mice were cultured to examine differences in collagen deposition that might implicate SPARC in collagen fibril formation. We have found that collagen secretion by primary murine dermal fibroblasts is greatly enhanced by the addition of ascorbate. As shown in Fig. 2, collagen produced by SPARC-null fibroblasts displayed an increased interaction with detergent-soluble cell layers in comparison to collagen produced by WT cells at ∼18-24 h after induction of collagen secretion by ascorbate. Likewise, decreased amounts of collagen were present in media conditioned by SPARC-null compared with WT fibroblasts at this time. Fig. 2A shows a representative fluorograph generated from cells incubated with [3H]proline. Labeled collagen produced by WT (+/+) and null (-/-) cells was apparent in conditioned media, detergent-soluble, and detergent-insoluble cell layers. Quantification from 7 separate experiments performed with different cell preparations showed a consistent increase in collagen I associated with SPARC-null detergent-soluble cell layers that was accompanied by a decrease in the amounts of collagen I in the media, in contrast to the distribution of collagen observed in WT fibroblasts (Fig. 2B). As detergent-insoluble fractions did not completely dissolve in boiling Laemmli buffer, we relied on hydroxyproline analysis (see below) for quantification of collagen in detergent-insoluble cell extracts. To characterize further the association of collagen I with separate cellular fractions, we performed hydroxyproline analysis of detergent-extracted WT and SPARC-null cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, the percent of hydroxyproline normalized to total protein (Hyp/total protein) associated with detergent-soluble layers was higher in the absence of SPARC after 4 h of collagen secretion. In contrast, the percent of Hyp/total protein in detergent-insoluble extracts was reduced in SPARC-null versus WT cells. Deposition and accumulation of ECM occur over several days in cultured cells. We sought to determine whether initial increases in cell-associated collagen influenced deposition of collagen by SPARC-null cells over a 5-day time period. Hydroxyproline analysis carried out on cell layers from WT and SPARC-null fibroblasts cultured for 1, 2, and 5 days after ascorbate addition indicated that initial increases in cell-associated collagen did not result in increased collagen deposition. A significant decrease in collagen accumulation in detergent-insoluble cell layers in null versus WT cells was observed (Fig. 3B). The amounts of collagen were decreased in conditioned media from SPARC-null fibroblasts in comparison to WT levels at each day (data not shown). We conclude from these results that in the absence of SPARC, procollagen I initially associated with cell surfaces to a greater extent than procollagen I produced concomitantly with SPARC. However, SPARC-null fibroblasts did not incorporate collagen as efficiently into an insoluble matrix. Enhanced Procollagen Processing in the Absence of SPARC—As procollagen processing is a critical component of collagen I ECM assembly, we asked whether SPARC influenced procollagen I processing in vitro. Fig. 4 is a representative immunoblot from conditioned media and detergent-soluble cell layers collected 1 and 2 days after addition of ascorbate. The polyclonal antibody used in these experiments displayed a significant preference for the α1(I) subunit of collagen I, such that the procollagen α2(I) and its processed chains were not apparent. Three distinct bands that represent procollagen α1(I), pC α(I) (procollagen α1(I) with the N-propeptide removed), and collagen α1(I) were evident in detergent-soluble extracts. Procollagen α1(I) and pC α1(I) exhibit greater solubility in comparison with pN α1(I) and collagen α1(I) (21Prockop D.J. Hulmes D.J.S. Assembly of Collagen Fibrils de novo from Soluble Precursors: Polymerization and Copolymerization of Procollagen, pN-collagen, and Mutated Collagens. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1994Google Scholar). Accordingly, conditioned media from SPARC-null and WT fibroblasts contained predominantly procollagen α1(I) and pC α1(I). However, a higher proportion of collagen I was present as pC α1(I) in SPARC-null versus WT conditioned media. Furthermore, an increase in the amounts of processed collagen α1(I) was also apparent in detergent-soluble cell layers from SPARC-null fibroblasts. Differences detectable at day 1 were more substantial at day 2 (Fig. 4A). The identity of pC collagen I was confirmed with antibodies against the C-propeptide of collagen I (LF41, data not shown) (16Fisher L.W. Stubbs 3rd, J.T. Young M.F. Acta Orthop. Scand. Suppl. 1995; 266: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). The lack of detectable pN collagen I in detergent-soluble cell layers is most likely due to incorporation of pN collagen I into the detergent-insoluble fraction, which is difficult to solubilize and resolve by SDS-PAGE. Quantification of band intensity associated with collagen in the media (Fig. 4C) and in the detergent-soluble fraction (Fig. 4D) is shown. An enhancement of procollagen I processing is expected to result in the production of greater amounts of cleaved propeptides in conditioned media. Immunoprecipitation was carried out with antibodies against the N-propeptide of collagen I to determine whether increased amounts of cleaved N-propeptide were observed in media conditioned by SPARC-null fibroblasts. A representative experiment is shown in Fig. 5A. Although a slight decrease in amounts of collagen I was observed in the starting material of SPARC-null versus WT conditioned media, increased amounts of N-propeptide were consistently found associated with SPARC-null conditioned media. As shown in Fig. 5B, quantification of three separate immunoprecipitation experiments with different primary cell isolates confirmed a reproducible increase in processed N-propeptide in media conditioned by SPARC-null versus WT fibroblasts. We performed pulse-chase experiments to determine whether the absence of SPARC influenced procollagen I processing and/or whether longer periods of time were required to detect differences in procollagen I conversion in SPARC-null fibroblasts. A representative pulse-chase experiment is shown in Fig. 6A. Whereas mature collagen I was detected in SPARC-null cell layers at 36 min of chase, mature collagen I in WT cells was not detectable until 60 min of chase. An immunoblot analysis with anti-collagen I antibodies is shown in Fig. 6A, lower panel,to demonstrate that approximately equal amounts of total collagen I were present in SPARC-null and WT cells. The immunoblot also demonstrated the increase in processed collagen I associated with SPARC-null cells. Fig. 6B shows quantification from three separate experiments demonstrating that less time following pulse labeling was required to detect processed collagen I in SPARC-null versus WT cells. We conclude that SPARC diminishes procollagen I binding to cell surfaces and functions as a regulatory component in the conversion of procollagen I to collagen I. rSPARC Reverses Increases in Cell-associated Collagen I and in Collagen I Processing in SPARC-null Cells—We asked whether restoration of SPARC activity to SPARC-null fibroblasts reversed the differences in procollagen conversion in SPARC-null cells. Addition of recombinant SPARC (rSPARC) to SPARC-null fibroblasts led to an appreciable decrease in procollagen I associated with null cell layers (Fig. 7A, compare lane 3 (-rSPARC) to lane 4 (+rSPARC)). Coincident with a decrease in overall amounts of cell-associated collagen I, a significant inhibition of procollagen processing was evident upon addition of rSPARC. Quantification from three separate experiments is shown in Fig. 7, B and C. We consistently recorded a decrease in collagen I in detergent-soluble SPARC-null cell layers treated with rSPARC, in comparison to that of control null cells treated with equal amounts of nonspecific protein (ovalbumin, Fig. 7B). In addition, the proportion of collagen present as processed collagen α1(I) in detergent-soluble fractions was significantly decreased by addition of rSPARC (Fig. 7C). The decrease in amounts of procollagen I converted into collagen I was accompanied by a decrease in the levels of collagen I associated with SPARC-null cell layers. Fiber Formation on SPARC-null Versus WT Fibroblasts—Immunofluorescence studies to detect collagen fibers on the surface of WT and SPARC-null dermal fibroblasts were carried out to discern whether the differences seen in collagen I processing influenced collagen fiber formation in vitro. At 1 (Fig. 8, C and D) and 2 h (E and F) after addition of ascorbate, more collagen immunoreactivity was associated with SPARC-null cells (D and F) in comparison to WT cells (C and E). These results are consistent with the initial increases in cell-associated collagen as described in Fig. 2. After addition of ascorbate for 1 day, collagen fibers were apparent on WT and SPARC-null fibroblasts (Fig. 9, A and B). However, 3 days after treatment with ascorbate, collagen fibers on the surface of SPARC-null fibroblasts (Fig. 9D) were diminished, whereas those associated with WT cells persisted (Fig. 9C). Collagen fibers on WT fibroblasts at day 3 appeared to have increased staining over those present at day 1. We conclude that collagen fibers on WT cells continued to develop with time as expected, whereas collagen fibers formed in the absence of SPARC did not persist. In this study, we have found that collagen fibrils generated in the absence of SPARC in mice at 1 month of age appeared to be stalled at a stage of fibril aggregation and accumulated as proposed intermediates in fibril fusion (22Birk D.E. Zycband E.I. Woodruff S. Winkelmann D.A. Trelstad R.L. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 208: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Previous studies demonstrated a substantial decrease in amounts of collagen in SPARC-null dermis (12Bradshaw A.D. Puolakkainen P. Dasgupta J. Davidson J.M. Wight T.N. Sage E.H. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2003; 120: 949-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). This observation suggested to us that SPARC was essential for collagen fibril growth and deposition in skin. To elucidate the cellular basis of the SPARC-null collagen phenotype, we investigated collagen I production in SPARC-null dermal fibroblasts. We have shown, by a number of different techniques, that SPARC-null dermal fibroblasts exhibited an increased association of collagen I with cell layers and enhanced processing of procollagen α1(I) to collagen α1(I). The processed collagen I was not efficiently incorporated into SPARC-null detergent-insoluble cell layers, and collagen fibers that formed on SPARC-null cells did not persist to the same extent as those on WT cells. These results indicate that regulation of collagen association with cell surfaces by SPARC is critical for appropriate procollagen processing and formation of stable collagen fibers.

https://openalex.org/W2147656680,"Hypoxia causes increased expression of several proteins that have the potential to promote neovascularization. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is up-regulated by hypoxia in the retina and plays a central role in the development of several types of ocular neovascularization, but the effects of other hypoxia-regulated proteins are less clear. Stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) and its receptor, CXCR4, have hypoxia response elements in the promoter regions of their genes and are increased in hypoxic liver and heart. In this study, we found that SDF-1 and CXCR4 are increased in hypoxic retina, with SDF-1 localized in glial cells primarily near the surface of the retina and CXCR4 localized in bone marrow-derived cells. Glial cells also expressed CXCR4, which suggested the possibility of autocrine stimulation, but influx of bone marrow-derived cells is the major source of increased levels of CXCR4. High levels of VEGF in the retina in the absence of hypoxia also increased levels of Cxcr4 and Sdf1 mRNA. CXCR4 antagonists reduced influx of bone marrow-derived cells into ischemic retina and strongly suppressed retinal neovascularization, VEGF-induced subretinal neovascularization, and choroidal neovascularization. These data suggest that SDF-1 and CXCR4 contribute to the involvement of bone marrow-derived cells and collaborate with VEGF in the development of several types of ocular neovascularization. They provide new targets for therapeutic intervention that may help to bolster and supplement effects obtained with VEGF antagonists."

The role of protein thiol modification in mitochondrial redox regulation, however, remains unclear, in large part because of the difficulty of identifying mitochondrial thiol proteins responsive to the low ROS fluxes found in vivo. To explore the role of mitochondrial protein thiols in redox signaling, we developed a sensitive proteomic approach to identify thiol proteins that are modified by low levels of endogenous ROS. We adapted the difference gel electrophoresis (DIGE) technique (20Lilley K.S. Friedman D.B. Expert Rev. Proteomics. 2004; 1: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 21Unlu M. Morgan M.E. Minden J.S. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2071-2077Crossref PubMed Scopus (1861) Google Scholar) labeling protein thiols in control and redox-challenged samples with two different fluorescent dyes containing thiol-reactive maleimide groups, followed by detection of changes in the relative fluorescence on a single two-dimensional gel. This approach, which we call redox-DIGE, enabled us to identify proteins containing redox-sensitive thiols by peptide mass fingerprinting and tandem mass spectrometry. When this technique was applied to mitochondria exposed to low ROS fluxes emanating from the respiratory chain, such as occur during redox signaling in vivo, there was selective oxidation of a small number of redox-sensitive thiol proteins. These proteins were predominantly involved in fatty acid oxidation or in the regulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase. This finding indicates that the reversible modification of a small subset of mitochondrial protein thiols occurs during low endogenous ROS fluxes, suggesting that protein thiol modification may be an important but neglected aspect of mitochondrial redox signaling. Mitochondrial Preparations and Incubations—Rat heart mitochondria were prepared by homogenization in STE (250 mm sucrose, 5 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% fatty acid-free BSA, pH 7.4) using an Ultraturrax blender followed by differential centrifugation (22Chappell J.B. Hansford R.G. Birnie G.D. Subcellular Components: Preparation and Fractionation. Butterworths, London1972: 77-91Google Scholar). Protein concentration was measured by the biuret assay with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard (23Gornall A.G. Bardawill C.J. David M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1949; 177: 751-766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondrial incubations were in 250 mm sucrose, 5 mm HEPES, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.4 (NaOH) (standard assay medium). Neocuproine (10 μm) was included for S-nitroso-N-acetyl-dl-penicillamine (SNAP) incubations that were protected from light. For exogenous SNAP/H2O2, mitochondria (1 mg of protein/ml) were incubated with 5 mm glutamate, 5 mm malate for 5 min at 37 °C. To generate endogenous ROS, 0.01% BSA was included, and mitochondria (1 mg of protein/ml) were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C with 10 mm succinate for reverse electron transport (RET); with 10 mm succinate, 400 nm carbonylcyanide-p-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP), and 2.5 μm antimycin to generate ROS at complex III; or with 10 mm succinate, and 400 nm FCCP as a low ROS control. Protein Thiol, Glutathione, and Hydrogen Peroxide Measurements—Free mitochondrial protein thiols were measured using DTNB or biotinylated maleimide (BMAL). For the DTNB assay (24Ellman G. Lysko H. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 93: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), pelleted mitochondria were resuspended in standard assay medium containing 1% (w/v) n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside (DDM). To remove glutathione, the mitochondria lysates were then passed through a Micro Bio-Spin 6 chromatography column (pre-equilibrated with standard assay medium containing 1% (w/v) DDM), diluted 17-fold with 200 μm DTNB, 80 mm sodium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0 (NaOH), and incubated for 20 min at room temperature before measuring A412 (ϵ412 (thionitrobenzoic acid) = 13,600 m-1 cm-1).

After various incubations, mitochondria (2 mg of protein) were pelleted by centrifugation, and the pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of 5% (w/v) 5-sulfosalicylic acid and 0.2% (w/v) Triton X-100, and the samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 13 000 × g. To determine the total glutathione equivalents (GSH + 2GSSG), 10 μl of supernatant or 10 μl of standard (0-70 μm GSH in 5% (w/v) 5-sulfosalicylic acid) were incubated in triplicate in 285 μl of recycling assay buffer (125 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 5.5 mm EDTA, 183 μm NADPH, and 0.53 mm DTNB) with 0.7 units/ml glutathione reductase and read (A405 for 10 min; SpectraMax Plus 384; Molecular Devices). GSSG was measured by incubating 60 μl of supernatant or standard (0-20 μm GSSG in 5% (w/v) 5-sulfosalicylic acid) with 3.4 μl of 2-vinylpyridine and 2.8 μl of triethanolamine sealed under argon at 4 °C for 1 h with agitation. 10-20 μl of the samples in triplicate were then added to 285 μl of recycling assay buffer with 3.5 units/ml glutathione reductase and read (as above). To determine protein mixed disulfides with glutathione (28Akerboom T.P. Sies H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 77: 373-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1475) Google Scholar), the pellets were washed three times in 250 μl of 5% (w/v) 5-sulfosalicyclic acid. The washed pellets or 10 μl of standard (0-400 μm GSSG in 5% (w/v) 5-sulfosalicylic acid) were resuspended in 65 μl of 8 m urea, neutralized with 15 μl of 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and reduced by the addition of 20 μl of 10% (w/v) NaBH4 (in 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) for 30 min at 40 °C. After the incubation, 25 μl of 5% (w/v) 5-sulfosalicyclic acid was added; the samples were incubated at 23 °C for 15 min and then on ice for 15 min before centrifugation for 5 min at 16,000 × g. The top layer (if any) was aspirated off, and the supernatant (10 μl) was assayed in the same way as the GSSG measurements. The average total glutathione concentration ± S.D. in control samples was 1.6 ± 0.2 nmol/mg mitochondrial protein. Efflux of H2O2 from isolated mitochondria was measured by the horseradish peroxidase oxidation of Amplex Red to fluorescent resorufin (29Zhou M. Diwu Z. Panchuk-Voloshina N. Haugland R.P. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 253: 162-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were incubated with stirring at 37 °C in standard assay medium containing 50 μm Amplex Red (Molecular Probes) and 4 units/ml horseradish peroxidase. Resorufin was monitored continuously in a fluorimeter (Shimadzu Rf-5301PC) (λex = 560 nm, λem = 590 nm), and the response was calibrated using known amounts of H2O2 (ϵ240 = 43.5 m-1 cm-1). Sample Preparation for Redox-DIGE—After incubation 1 ml of 50 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) was added, and the mitochondria samples were then pelleted. Pellets were resuspended in assay medium containing 50 mm NEM for 5 min at 37 °C; 1% SDS was then added, and the mitochondrial lysate was incubated for a further 5 min. The NEM was removed using a Micro Bio-Spin 6 chromatography column (Bio-Rad), and a 1% concentration of SDS was maintained throughout the assay. The samples were then reduced with 2.5 mm DTT for 10 min at room temperature. DTT was removed with two Micro Bio-Spin 6 chromatography columns (Bio-Rad), and the samples were labeled with 40 μm CyDye™ DIGE Fluor Cy™3 saturation dye (GE Healthcare) or CyDye™ DIGE Fluor Cy™5 saturation dye (GE Healthcare). After 30 min at 37 °C, the reaction was quenched with 2.5 mm DTT, and equal amounts of the Cy3 and Cy5 maleimide labeled samples were pooled and resolved by two-dimensional electrophoresis. Careful optimization experiments were performed for the initial blocking step with NEM, the DTT reduction and the subsequent Cy maleimide labeling steps of the redox-DIGE method using the DTNB assay to quantify free thiols. For the blocking step, 25 mm NEM was used because at this concentration 99% of the free thiols in the samples was alkylated. For the DTT reduction, a range of DTT concentrations were tested, and maximal free thiol concentrations were observed when 0.5 mm DTT or greater was used. Experiments were carried out with 2.5 mm DTT because concentrations greater than this interfered with Cy maleimide labeling. For the Cy maleimide labeling, careful control experiments were conducted to optimize the concentration, time, temperature, and pH of the reaction so that complete alkylation of thiol residues occurred. At higher concentrations of Cy maleimides, charge shifting occurred on the two-dimensional gels, presumably because of the Cy maleimides reacting with protein amines in the sample. The Cy3 maleimide appeared to react at a greater rate with amines than the Cy5 maleimide resulting in color changes that did not reflect changes in protein thiol state. Two-dimensional Electrophoresis—Equal volumes of 2× sample buffer (7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 2% amidosulfobetaine-14, 20 mg/ml DTT, and 2% Pharmalytes 3-10 NL) were added to the fluorescently labeled samples (25 μg of total protein per gel) and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Rehydration buffer (7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 2% amidosulfobetaine-14, 2 mg/ml DTT, and 1% Pharmalytes 3-10 NL) was added to make the volume up to 250 μl prior to isoelectric focusing. IPG strips (13 cm, pH 3-10 NL; GE Healthcare) were rehydrated with the samples for 10 h at 20 °C at 20 V using the IPGphor II apparatus following the manufacturer's instructions (GE Healthcare). IEF was performed for a total of 41,700 V-h at 20 °C at 50 μA. Prior to SDS-PAGE, the strips were equilibrated with rocking for 15 min in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 30% glycerol, 8 m urea, 1% SDS, 5 mg/ml DTT. The strips were loaded onto a 12%, 1-mm acrylamide gel and overlaid with 1% agarose in SDS running buffer (5 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 192 mm glycine, and 0.1% SDS) containing 0.2 mg/ml bromphenol blue. The gels were run at 15 °C at 20 mV for 15 min and then at 40 mV until the bromphenol blue dye front had run off the bottom of the gels. Gel Imaging and Analysis—After two-dimensional electrophoresis, gels were transferred to a Typhoon™ 9410 imager (GE Healthcare), and fluorescent spots were viewed using 532 and 633 nm lasers in conjunction with 580 and 670 nm emission filters (band pass 30 nm), respectively. The gels were then stained with Deep Purple™ total protein stain (GE Healthcare), and the protein spots were imaged using a 457 nm laser in conjunction with a 610 nm band pass emission filter. All gels were scanned at 100 μm pixel size, and the photomultiplier tube (PMT) was set to ensure a maximum pixel intensity between 40,000 and 80,000 to avoid saturation. Most proteins were present as multiple spots aligned horizontally in charge trains. Each spot within a charge train was assumed to represent the same protein, and this was confirmed where possible by mass spectrometry. Gel analysis was performed using DeCyder™ DIA version 5.0 (GE Healthcare), a two-dimensional gel analysis software package designed specifically for DIGE. Using DeCyder™ software, a range approach for determining significance thresholds was established (30Karp N.A. Kreil D.P. Lilley K.S. Proteomics. 2004; 4: 1421-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Spots were co-detected between the two fluorescence images from a single gel and any with a volume less than 0.01% of the total fluorescence or a slope (the change in fluorescent intensity versus pixel width) greater than 1 were excluded as artifacts. The DeCyder™ (version 5) program then generated a frequency histogram of the log volume ratios and normalized the Cy3 fluorescent image (V1) and Cy5 fluorescent image (V2) by adjusting the spot volume of the Cy3 fluorescent image (V1′) such that the frequency histogram of the log volume ratios centered on zero (i.e. a Cy5/Cy3 fluorescence ratio of 1). To do this, a normal distribution is fitted to the main peak of the histogram using a standard least squares gradient descent. Outliers were excluded from the model curve fitting procedure by discarding spots below 10% of the top of the main peak in the frequency histogram of the log volume ratios. The calculated normalized log volume ratios were then converted into expression ratios (E) using the equation E = (V2/V1′). The expression ratios from the analysis of 6 control versus control gels were then ordered from smallest to largest, and a range of expression ratios that encompassed 99% of the spots was established, which was in the ratio range from 0.47 to 1.73. Only spots with intensity outside this 99% confidence threshold on three gels were taken as significant. As less than 0.1% false positives were observed in the six control versus control gels, this indicates that the selected significant spots are significant with a p < 0.001. Three independent biological replicates were conducted for the 10 μm SNAP, 100 μm SNAP, 25 μm H2O2, and 250 μm H2O2 conditions, four for the 2.5 μm H2O2 and antimycin conditions, and six for the RET conditions. Spot Excision and Mass Spectrometry—For mass spectrometry prior to gel casting, a glass plate was treated with 0.1% PlusOne™ Bind Silane (GE Healthcare), 2% acetic acid, and 80% ethanol, and two plastic fluorescent reference marker stickers were attached to the plate. Then 200 μg of mitochondrial protein was run (see above); a spot-picking list generated from DeCyder software was exported to Ettan Spot Picker (GE Healthcare), and the gel spots were excised using 1.4-mm diameter plugs. Excised protein spots were digested by “in-gel” cleavage (31Wilm M. Shevchenko A. Houthaeve T. Breit S. Schweigerer L. Fotsis T. Mann M. Nature. 1996; 379: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1510) Google Scholar) at 37 °C with 12.5 ng/ml sequencing grade trypsin (Roche Applied Science) in buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 5 mm CaCl2. Peptides were extracted from the gel with a 4% ARISTAR-grade formic acid, 60% acetonitrile (Romil) solution. All digests were examined in a MALDI-TOF-TOF mass spectrometer (4700 Proteomics Analyzer, Applied Biosystems) using α-cyano-hydroxy-trans-cinnamic acid as the matrix. The instrument was calibrated with bovine trypsin autolysis products (m/z values, 2163.057 and 2273.160) and a calcium-related matrix ion (m/z value, 1060.048). Peptide masses and peptide fragmentation data were searched against the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) number 20060817 data base against all entries or Rattus with a peptide tolerance of ±25 ppm, tandem mass spectrometry tolerance of ±0.8 Da, allowed missed cleavages of 1, and with NEM as a variable modification using MASCOT. In an attempt to identify the specific sites of redox modification, all MASCOT searches were conducted again with the inclusion of the Cy5 and Cy3 maleimide modifications, but in no cases were these modifications observed. The identification of protein spots was primarily based on peptide mass fingerprinting that gave a statistically significant MASCOT score for assignment of the protein, based either on all data base entries or on Rattus entries only. In addition, the assignment was corroborated by tandem mass spectrometry sequencing of peptides, which often itself was sufficient to give a statistically significant identification of a protein. In the one case where the assignment based on peptide mass fingerprinting was not statistically significant (Complex III, Rieske FeS protein), peptide sequencing was significant. Therefore, most assignments are based on both peptide mass fingerprinting and peptide sequencing, with a few assignments based on peptide fingerprinting alone and one based on peptide sequencing. In the case of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, isoenzyme 2, identity was further supported by immunoblotting. Although it is impossible to entirely exclude the possibility that redox-DIGE picks a low abundant thiol protein that is misidentified because it co-migrates with a more abundant protein, none of the protein spots positively identified here contained significant amounts of peptides from other proteins. Enzyme Assays—The presence of sulfinates or sulfonates on Cys47 of PrxIII was detected by Western blotting using a rabbit polyclonal antibody (LF-PA0004, LabFrontier) that recognizes cysteine sulfinic and sulfonic acids in the active sites of peroxiredoxins. PrxIII oligomerization was assayed by nonreducing Western blotting using a polyclonal antibody against PrxIII (LF-PA0030, LabFrontier). To prevent spontaneous dimerization of PrxIII, samples were incubated in 100 mm NEM for 15 min at 37 °C before the mitochondria were pelleted and lysed in sample loading buffer containing 100 mm NEM without DTT. The oxidation state of Trx2 was monitored using a protein electrophoretic mobility shift assay (32Bersani N.A. Merwin J.R. Lopez N.I. Pearson G.D. Merrill G.F. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 347: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). After various incubations, mitochondria (0.3 μg of protein) were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 100 μl of urea buffer (8 m urea, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA) with 60 mm iodoacetic acid, and incubated for 2 min at 37 °C. The iodoacetic acid was then removed using a micro Bio-spin column (pre-equilibrated with urea buffer), and 10 mm DTT was added to the samples for 30 min at 37 °C followed by the addition of 30 mm iodoacetamide for 15 min at 37 °C. 3.5 mm DTT, 8% glycerol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue was then added to the samples, and they were resolved on a 1-mm urea-polyacrylamide gel (stacking gel contained 8 m urea, 2.5% acrylamide, 0.075% bisacrylamide, 0.12 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and the separating gel consisted of 8 m urea, 9% acrylamide, 0.27% bisacrylamide, 0.037 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.8) using a Mini Protean system (Bio-Rad) at 120 V. The chamber buffer used for gel electrophoresis was 0.025 m Tris, 0.192 m glycine, pH 8.3. The gels were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (0.45 μm; Millipore) using a Mini Protean transfer cell (Bio-Rad), and the blots were probed with a Trx2 antibody (1:500; Abcam) and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare). Propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC) activity was assayed radiochemically by counting the incorporation of [14C]bicarbonate (GE Healthcare) into methylmalonyl-CoA in mitochondrial lysates (33Kalousek F. Darigo M.D. Rosenberg L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 60-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After various incubations, rat heart mitochondria (50 μg of protein) were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in medium containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (23 °C), 2 mm ATP, 125 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 6.0 mm propionyl-CoA, 0.5 mg/ml BSA, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 10 mm NaH[14C]O3 (specific activity 0.1 Ci/mol) in a final volume of 50 μl, and incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 50 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid; the mixture was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 5 min, and 95 μl of the supernatant was dried in a scintillation vial in a water bath at 80 °C for 50 min. The dry residue was dissolved in 150 μl of H2O, 4 ml of scintillation fluid (Scintran Fluoran-Safe 2; BDH) was added, and the samples were counted (Liquid Scintillation Analyzer Tri-Carb 2800TR; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The counts from samples in the assay mixture without propionyl-CoA were subtracted for those with propionyl-CoA, and protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method using BSA as a standard (25Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18792) Google Scholar). The incorporation of [14C]bicarbonate was linear over 10 min and proportional to the amount of mitochondrial lysate assayed. The average propionyl-CoA carboxylase activity ± S.D. in control samples was 57 ± 10 nmol/min/mg mitochondrial protein. The activity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDHK) was determined by measuring the initial rate of incorporation of [32P]phosphate from [γ-32P]ATP into exogenously added pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (34Hucho F.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3945-3948Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). After various incubations mitochondria were pelleted by centrifugation and incubated in 25 μl of buffer (20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 25 μg/ml oligomycin, 10 mm NaF, 0.73 units/ml porcine pyruvate dehydrogenase complex), 0.25% (w/v) Triton X-100, and 0.3 mm [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 333 Ci/mol) for 1 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by adding 25 μl of 2× sample buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% (w/v) SDS, 20% (w/v) glycerol, 0.2% (w/v) bromphenol blue, and 100 mm DTT), and the samples were analyzed immediately by SDS-PAGE (4-20% Precise™ protein gels; Pierce) followed by phosphorimaging (Typhoon™ 9410 Imager; GE Healthcare). The phosphorylation of pyruvate dehydrogenase was linear for at least 2 min and proportional to the amount of mitochondrial lysate assayed. Effect of Exogenous H2O2 and SNAP and Endogenous Superoxide Production on Mitochondrial Protein Thiols—We first determined how exogenous ROS or RNS affected the redox state of solvent-exposed thiols on native mitochondrial proteins, chosen because these are the protein thiols most likely to be modified during redox challenge (19Taylor E.R.

https://openalex.org/W1976619149,"Historically, variable and transient sources have both surprised astronomers and provided new views of the heavens. Here we report the discovery of an optical transient in the outskirts of the lenticular galaxy Messier 85 in the Virgo cluster. With a peak absolute R magnitude of -12, this event is distinctly brighter than novae, but fainter than type Ia supernovae (which are expected in a population of old stars in lenticular galaxies). Archival images of the field do not show a luminous star at that position with an upper limit in the g filter of about -4.1 mag, so it is unlikely to be a giant eruption from a luminous blue variable star. Over a two-month period, the transient source emitted radiation energy of almost 10(47) erg and subsequently faded in the optical sky. It is similar to, but six times more luminous at peak than, an enigmatic transient in the galaxy M31 (ref. 1). A possible origin of M85 OT2006-1 is a stellar merger. If so, searches for similar events in nearby galaxies will not only allow study of the physics of hyper-Eddington sources, but also probe an important phase in the evolution of stellar binary systems."
https://openalex.org/W2160301335,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-transmembrane proteins, ATF6α and ATF6β, are cleaved during the ER stress response (ERSR). The resulting N-terminal fragments (N-ATF6α and N-ATF6β) have conserved DNA-binding domains and divergent transcriptional activation domains. N-ATF6α and N-ATF6β translocate to the nucleus, bind to specific regulatory elements, and influence expression of ERSR genes, such as glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), that contribute to resolving the ERSR, thus, enhancing cell viability.

In this study we explored the molecular basis and functional impact of these isoform-specific characteristics in HeLa cells. Mutants in the transcriptional activation domain or DNA-binding domain of N-ATF6α exhibited loss of function and increased expression, the latter of which suggested decreased rates of degradation. Fusing N-ATF6α to the mutant estrogen receptor generated N-ATF6α-MER, which, without tamoxifen exhibited loss-of-function and high expression, but in the presence of tamoxifen N-ATF6α-MER exhibited gain-of-function and low expression. N-ATF6β conferred loss-of-function and high expression to N-ATF6α, suggesting that ATF6β is an endogenous inhibitor of ATF6α. In vitro DNA binding experiments showed that recombinant N-ATF6β inhibited the binding of recombinant N-ATF6α to an ERSR element from the GRP78 promoter. Moreover, siRNA-mediated knock-down of endogenous ATF6β increased GRP78 promoter activity and GRP78 gene expression, as well as augmenting cell viability. Thus, the relative levels of ATF6α and -β, may contribute to regulating the strength and duration of ATF6-dependent ERSR gene induction and cell viability.

Numerous proteins induced under such conditions are targeted to the ER, where they aid in nascent protein folding and thus, counteract the stress; this ER-initiated signaling process is known as the ER stress response (ERSR). ERSR elements (ERSEs) are located in the regulatory regions of many ERSR genes. One of the transcription factors that mediates ERSR gene induction via ERSEs is ATF6α, a 670-aa ER trans-membrane protein (5Zhu C. Johansen F.E. Prywes R. Mol. Cell.

Several other potent transcription factors that exert rapid, transient effects exhibit similar coupling of transcriptional activation and degradation (15Salghetti S.E. Muratani M. Wijnen H. Futcher B. Tansey W.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3118-3123Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), including the virally encoded protein, VP16 (16Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1207-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). An 8-aa domain in VP16, called VN8, confers strong transcriptional activity and susceptibility to degradation, and mutations in VN8 that reduce VP16 activity decrease degradation (17Tanaka M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4311-4315Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 18Molinari E. Gilman M. Natesan S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6439-6447Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The TAD of ATF6α possesses a VN8-like sequence, and mutating it in ways known to decrease VP16 activity decrease ATF6α activity and degradation (14Thuerauf D.J. Morrison L.E. Hoover H. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20734-20739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To the best of our knowledge, the VN8 domain has not been found in any other mammalian transcription factor, including a second isoform of ATF6, ATF6β. Like ATF6α, ATF6β is an ER-transmembrane protein (Fig. 1A, ATF6β), and during ER stress proteolysis generates an N-terminal fragment of ∼400 aa (19Haze K. Okada T. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Negishi M. Mori K. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). N-ATF6α and N-ATF6β possess highly conserved b-Zip domains, which allow them to bind to ERSEs as homo- or heterodimers (20Yoshida H. Okada T. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Negishi M. Mori K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1239-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar); however, the N-terminal regions are divergent. For example, the region of N-ATF6β corresponding to the VN8 of N-ATF6α differs in 5 of 8 aa in ways predicted from studies with VP16 to diminish transcriptional activity (21Regier J.L. Shen F. Triezenberg S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 883-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B, N-ATF6β). In support of this prediction were findings that ectopically expressed N-ATF6β is a poor ERSR gene inducer (6Yoshida H. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33741-33749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar) that exhibits much greater stability than N-ATF6α (14Thuerauf D.J. Morrison L.E. Hoover H. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20734-20739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Accordingly, although they can bind to the same regulatory elements, N-ATF6α and -β exhibit isoform-specific transcriptional activation and stability characteristics. Thus, N-ATF6α and -β might function in a combinatorial fashion to fine-tune the strength of ERSR gene activation. In the present study, we examined the molecular mechanism and function of the isoform-specific characteristics of N-ATF6α and -β, addressing the following hypotheses: 1) the isoform-specific characteristics of N-ATF6α and -β are conferred by their divergent N-terminal TADs; 2) N-ATF6α-mediated transcriptional activation and rapid degradation are coordinated processes, and 3) the relative levels of N-ATF6α and -β impact ERSR gene induction and cell viability in ways consistent with roles of N-ATF6β as a transcriptional repressor of N-ATF6α. Replicates and Statistical Analysis—Unless otherwise stated in the legends or figures, each treatment was performed on three identical cultures, and each experiment was repeated at least three times. Representative experiments are shown. Statistical analyses were performed using a one-way ANOVA followed by the Student-Newman-Keul post-hoc analysis. *, #, or § = p < 0.05; **, ##, §§, or ⊕⊕ = p < 0.01. Cell Culture—HeLa Cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. For transfection experiments, HeLa cells were resuspended at 5-9 × 106 cells per 400 μl of cold Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline and electroporated in a 0.4-cm gap electroporation cuvette at 250 V and 950 microfarads using a GenePulser II Electroporator (Bio-Rad). The cells were then plated at a density of 0.5 × 106 per 24-mm well for experiments involving luciferase and β-galactosidase enzyme assays, or 1.5 × 106 per 35-mm well for experiments involving immunoblotting. Reporter assays and immunoblotting were carried out as previously described (22Thuerauf D.J. Morrison L. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21078-21084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). CMV-Galactosidase—CMV-β-galactosidase, which codes for a β-galactosidase reporter driven by the CMV promoter, was used to normalize for transfection efficiency. N-ATF6β-VN8 Mutations—Mutations were introduced into 3× FLAG-ATF6β-(1-392) to mimic the VN8 region of ATF6α. Accordingly, the following changes were introduced into ATF6β-VN8-M1: V65F, G66D, and M67L; whereas the following changes were introduced into ATF6β-VN8-M2: V65F, G66D, M67L, V69L, and S70L. ATF6β-VN8-M1 and ATF6β-VN8-M2 were created by PCR, using QuikChange from Stratagene and the relevant primers required to introduce the desired amino acid substitutions. N-ATF6α and N-ATF6β Chimeras—Constructs encoding chimeric proteins composed of various portions of N-ATF6α and -β were designed by aligning the sequences of N-ATF6α and -β and selecting homologous regions for domain swapping studies. Appropriate PCR fragments were generated from 3× FLAG-N-ATF6α and -β, so that an XhoI restriction site was introduced at the ATF6α and -β junction in each chimera. The amino acid sequence used to name each chimera refers to the original, full-length sequence of either ATF6α and -β. The constructs generated are: ATF6α-(1-114)/ATF6β-(116-392), ATF6α-(1-180)/ATF6β-(191-392), and ATF6α-(1-302)/ATF6β-(322-392), which are named constructs 3, 4, and 5, respectively, in Fig. 3A. N-ATF6α and N-ATF6β Gal4 DBD Fusion Proteins—A construct encoding the Gal4 DBD fused to the N terminus of ATF6α-(1-114) (i.e. Gal4 DBD-ATF6α-(1-114)) was created by PCR, using 3× FLAG-ATF6α-(1-373) as the template, and the appropriate primers, to create an amplicon with a BamH1 site on the 5′-end, and a termination codon and SacI site on the 3′-end. This PCR product was then cloned into Gal4 DBD (pSG424, GenBank™ accession number X85976). Clones Gal4 DBD-M (L32P) and Gal4 DBD-M (L32P)-ATF6α-(1-114) were generated using QuikChange from Stratagene and the appropriate primers. N-ATF6α-MER Fusion Protein—A PCR product composed of the nucleotides encoding aa 281-599 of the mouse mutated (G525R) estrogen receptor (MER, a gift from Dr. Michael Reth, Max-Plank-Institute, Freiburg, Germany) was cloned into the NotI/EcoR1 site of pCDNA3.1-3× FLAG vector to create 3× FLAG-MER. Subsequently, a PCR product of N-ATF6α was generated, which introduced a NotI site and removed the termination site after aa 373, was cloned into the XhoI/NotI site of 3× FLAG-MER to create 3× FLAG-N-ATF6α-MER. 3× HA-ATF6β—3× HA-ATF6β was generated by subcloning N-ATF6β from 3× FLAG-N-ATF6β into pCDNA3.1-3× HA, which has been described elsewhere (22Thuerauf D.J. Morrison L. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21078-21084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). GRP78-Promoter-luc—Reporter constructs encoding the GRP78 promoter from -284 to +7or -284 to +221 driving luciferase have been described elsewhere (23Thuerauf D.J. Marcinko M. Gude N. Rubio M. Sussman M.A. Glembotski C.C. Circ. Res. 2006; 99: 275-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The use of small interfering (si) RNA targeted against human ATF6α and -β has been described elsewhere (22Thuerauf D.J. Morrison L. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21078-21084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa cells were plated on 6-well plates at ∼400 K cells per well, then transfected with 50 ng of the relevant dicer siRNAs, using Lipofectamine 2000™. After 24 h, cells were treated with or without tunicamycin (2 μg/ml), and then examined by real-time quantitative PCR (see below), or, before tunicamycin treatment, they were removed from the plate with TripLE (Invitrogen), and re-plated in 96-well plates at ∼10 K cells per well in preparation for viability assays. To examine viability, cells in 96-well plates were treated with or without tunicamycin (2 μg/ml) and 2-deoxyglucose (3 mm) in serum-free media for 32 h. Cell viability was then assessed using an MTT Cell Proliferation Kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Roche Applied Science). Samples were read at 570 nm in a VersaMax microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Downingtown, PA). HeLa cells were transfected with the appropriate siRNA, as described above, then after treatments, they were lysed and RNA was extracted using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen). cDNA was generated by reverse transcription using a Superscript III kit (Invitrogen). Real-time quantitative PCR was performed on cDNA using the Quanti-Tect SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen) on an ABI Prism 7000 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The relative abundance of GRP78 RNA was calculated using the ΔΔCt method, as previously described (24Martindale J.J. Fernandez R. Thuerauf D. Whittaker R. Gude N. Sussman M.A. Glembotski C.C. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 1186-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Primers (see below) were designed using primer express version 2.0 (Applied Biosystems). All primers were determined to be 90% to 110% efficient, and all exhibited only one dissociation peak as follows: GRP78: (+) CCACCTCAGTCTCCCAGCTAA; (-) GCCGAGCATGGTGGTAACA; ATF6α:(+) CACAGCTCCCTAATCACGTGG; (-) ACTGGGCTATTCGCTGAAGG; ATF6β:(+) CAGCCATCAGCCACAACAAG; (-) GGCATCACCAGGGACATCTT; and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase: (+) GCCACATCGCTCAGACACC; (-) CAAATCCGTTGACTCCGACC. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were carried out essentially as previously described (25Yoshida H. Okada T. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Negishi M. Mori K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6755-6767Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). Double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides were used as 32P-labeled probes or competitors, as described in the figure legends. The GRP78 ERSE-1 sequence was: CCGGGAGGGCCTTCACCAATCGGCGGCCTCCACGACGGGGCTGGC (underlined nucleotides are a consensus ERSE), and the GRP78 ERSE1 MM sequence was CCGGGAGGGCCTTCAgactaCGGCGGCCTgatgtACGGGGCTGGC (mutated nucleotides indicated by lowercase). Nuclear extracts, which provide the source of other proteins (e.g. NF-Y, YY1, and TFII-I) needed for ATF6 binding to ERSEs, were prepared as previously described (25Yoshida H. Okada T. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Negishi M. Mori K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6755-6767Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). Binding reactions were carried out in a solution composed of 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 6 μg of HeLa nuclear extract, 2 μl of in vitro translated ATF6α-(1-373), ATF6α-(115-373), or ATF6β-(1-392), prepared as previously described (10Thuerauf D.J. Arnold N.D. Zechner D. Hanford D.S. DeMartin K.M. McDonough P.M. Prywes R. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20636-20643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and 10,000 cpm of 32P-labeled probe. Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 20 min, and then fractionated on a 5% polyacrylamide gel at 200 V for 150 min in 0.5× TBE buffer (45 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA). For supershift EMSAs, 1 μl of anti-ATF6α (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-22799), 1 μl of anti-ATF6β (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-30596), or 1 μl of non-immune mouse antisera was added 15 min prior to probe addition. For oligonucleotide specificity assessment, 250-fold excess of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide was added 15 min prior to addition of probe. Isoform-specific Characteristics of N-ATF6α and -β Are Conferred by Their Divergent N-terminal TADs—Because we previously showed the importance of the VN8 sequence for the transcriptional activity and rapid degradation of ATF6α (22Thuerauf D.J. Morrison L. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21078-21084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), we assessed whether the lack of a VN8 sequence in ATF6β is responsible for its low transcriptional activity and high stability. Upon sequence alignment of N-ATF6α and -β, we found that residues 64-71 of β correspond to residues 61-68 of α, the VN8-like region (Fig. 1B). Accordingly, residues 64-67 of N-ATF6β (i.e. ATF6β-(1-392)) were mutated to the same residues found in the VN8-like region of ATF6α, which possess the Phe and Leu known to be required for optimal activity (Fig. 2A, construct 3, ATF6β-VN8-M1). We also prepared a mutation that converted the entire 64-71 region N-ATF6β to be identical to the VN8 in ATF6α (Fig. 2A, construct 4, ATF6β-VN8-M2). The abilities of native N-ATF6β or the VN8 mutations to activate the promoter of the prototypical ERSR gene, GRP78, in HeLa cells were compared with N-ATF6α (i.e. ATF6α-(1-373)). As previously seen (22Thuerauf D.J. Morrison L. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21078-21084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), N-ATF6α exerted strong GRP78 promoter activation, whereas native N-ATF6β exhibited weak effects (Fig. 2B, constructs 1 versus 2). Among the ATF6β VN8 mutations, only ATF6β-VN8-M2 exhibited detectible GRP78 promoter activation, although it amounted to only ∼8% of N-ATF6α (Fig. 2B, construct 4). Previous studies showed that the relative levels of ectopically expressed ATF6α and -β are proportional to their half-lives (22Thuerauf D.J. Morrison L. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21078-21084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). N-ATF6α was expressed in very low quantities (Fig. 2C, construct 1), consistent with its known short half-life, whereas all forms of N-ATF6β were expressed at much higher levels (Fig. 2C, constructs 2-4), suggesting that they exhibited relatively long half-lives, as previously shown for native N-ATF6β (22Thuerauf D.J. Morrison L. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21078-21084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Quantification demonstrated that N-ATF6β, N-ATF6β-VN8-M1, and N-ATF6β-VN8-M2 were expressed at ∼40-, 29-, and 20-fold higher levels than N-ATF6α, respectively (Fig. 2C). Thus, although their expression levels and apparent half-lives decreased in coordination with the minor increases in activity, it was apparent that the low transcriptional activity and high stability of N-ATF6β were not due entirely to the lack of a consensus VN8 sequence, but that larger portions of ATF6β must be required to confer these isoform-specific characteristics. To examine the effects of mutating larger portions of ATF6α and -β, a series of domain-swap mutations were generated where the N terminus of N-ATF6β was replaced with progressively larger portions of the corresponding sequences from N-ATF6α (Fig. 3A). As expected, native N-ATF6α was a strong activator of the GRP78 promoter, whereas native N-ATF6β was much weaker (Fig. 3B, constructs 1 versus 2). However, when the N-terminal 115 or 190 aa of N-ATF6β were replaced with corresponding sequences from α, transcriptional activity increased progressively (Fig. 3B, constructs 3 and 4). Finally, when the N-terminal 321 aa of N-ATF6β, representing all but the 71-aa b-Zip domain, were replaced by corresponding sequences from N-ATF6α, GRP78 promoter activity increased to about the same level as that observed using native N-ATF6α (Fig. 3B, construct 5), suggesting that the b-Zip domains of N-ATF6α and -β were interchangeable. As expected, the level of expression of N-ATF6β was ∼80-fold greater than N-ATF6α (Fig. 3C, constructs 1 and 2); moreover, expression levels of the chimeras declined coordinately as more sequences from N-ATF6α replaced corresponding sequences in β (Fig. 3C, constructs 3-5), consistent with the hypothesis that the degradation rate of ATF6 coordinates with its transcriptional activity. When GRP78 promoter activity was normalized to the levels of ectopic N-ATF6α or -β protein expression, the only domain-swap mutant exhibiting activity approximating that of native N-ATF6α was construct 5 (Fig. 3D). Accordingly, these data suggested that, although the b-Zip domain of ATF6β can substitute for the b-Zip domain of ATF6α without much loss of function, most of the sequences lying to the N terminus of the b-Zip domain of ATF6α are necessary to confer the full transcriptional activity and rapid degradation characteristic of this ATF6 isoform. N-ATF6α-mediated Transcriptional Activation and Rapid Degradation Are Coordinated Processes—It is not known whether it is the sequences in the TAD of ATF6α that confer strong transcriptional activation and rapid degradation, or whether rapid degradation is a function of the engagement of ATF6α in a productive transcription complex. If the latter is true, then mutating the basic region of the b-Zip domain to disrupt binding of N-ATF6α to ERSEs should decrease transcriptional activation and decrease degradation. Consistent with this hypothesis was our finding that mutating the basic region of N-ATF6α (Fig. 4A, construct 2) to disrupt the binding of N-ATF6α to ERSEs (9Wang Y. Shen J. Arenzana N. Tirasophon W. Kaufman R.J. Prywes R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27013-27020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) resulted in decreased GRP78 promoter activation (Fig. 4B, constructs 1 and 2) and increased N-ATF6α expression of >3-fold (Fig. 4C, FLAG blot, constructs 1 and 2). To test this hypothesis in a heterologous gene expression system, we used a truncated form of the yeast transcription factor Gal4, Gal4-(1-147), composed of the Gal4 DBD, which does not possess a TAD. The binding of the Gal4 DBD to appropriate DNA sequences was assessed using a luciferase reporter driven by a neutral promoter flanked by tandem repeats of the Gal4 binding element. A mutation known to block the binding of Gal4-(1-147) to the Gal4 binding element (26Corton J.C. Moreno E. Johnston S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13776-13780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) was introduced into a construct featuring the TAD of ATF6α without the ATF6 DBD, i.e. ATF6α-(1-114), fused to the Gal4 DBD (Fig. 4A, constructs 5 and 6). As expected, the ATF6α(1-114)/Gal4 DBD fusion protein without the DBD mutation exhibited robust transcriptional activation, compared with the Gal4 DBD alone (Fig. 4B, constructs 3 and 5); however, the ATF6α(1-114)/Gal4 DBD fusion protein harboring the DBD mutation exhibited no transcriptional activation (Fig. 4B, construct 6). Moreover, the level of expression of ATF6α/Gal4 DBD-M was ∼2-fold greater than that of ATF6α/Gal4 DBD (Fig. 4C, Gal4 blot, constructs 5 and 6), whereas the level of expression of Gal4 DBD-M was actually somewhat lower than that of Gal4 DBD (Fig. 4C, Gal4 blot, constructs 3 and 4). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that rapid degradation of N-ATF6α requires its engagement in transcriptional activation. To examine the relationship between transcriptional engagement and ATF6 degradation in a different model system, we designed a method for conditionally activating N-ATF6α in a ligand-dependent manner. For this purpose, we generated a construct encoding N-ATF6α fused to a fragment of the MER, which has no TAD or DBD, but features a tamoxifen-ligand-binding domain replacing the estrogen-binding domain. By analogy to the way MER affects other proteins to which is has been fused (27Littlewood T.D. Hancock D.C. Danielian P.S. Parker M.G. Evan G.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1686-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar), we reasoned that, in the absence of tamoxifen, the MER would attract other cellular components, e.g. HSP90, which would block functional domains of ATF6, but that, upon tamoxifen binding, release of HSP90, among others, would reveal functional domains and allow full engagement of ATF6 in transcription (Fig. 5A). Accordingly, constructs encoding FLAG-MER or FLAG-N-ATF6α-MER, where MER is fused to the C terminus of FLAG-N-ATF6α, were prepared (Fig. 5B), and the abilities of each to activate the GRP78 promoter were examined. As expected, FLAG-MER exhibited essentially no activity (Fig. 5C, construct 1), whereas FLAG-N-ATF6α exhibited high activity that was affected very little by tamoxifen (Fig. 5C, construct 3). In contrast, FLAG-N-ATF6α-MER exhibited little activity in the absence of tamoxifen, but, upon tamoxifen addition, activity increased 3-fold, nearly equal to that of FLAG-N-ATF6α (Fig. 5C, construct 2). The protein levels of FLAG-MER were relatively high in the absence of tamoxifen (Fig. 5D, lanes 1 and 2), and actually increased by 1.6-fold in the presence of tamoxifen (Fig. 5D, lanes 3 and 4), which was somewhat expected, because tamoxifen stabilizes MER. The levels of FLAG-N-ATF6α were low and unchanged by tamoxifen (Fig. 5D, lanes 9-12). However, the levels of FLAG-N-ATF6α-MER were decreased by ∼5-fold in tamoxi"
https://openalex.org/W2019252988,"Kidney ischemia/reperfusion injury (I/R) is characterized by renal dysfunction and tubular damages resulting from an early activation of innate immunity. Recently, nicotine administration has been shown to be a powerful inhibitor of a variety of innate immune responses, including LPS-induced toxaemia. This cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway acts via the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR). Herein, we tested the potential protective effect of nicotine administration in a mouse model of renal I/R injury induced by bilateral clamping of kidney arteries. Renal function, tubular damages and inflammatory response were compared between control animals and mice receiving nicotine at the time of ischemia. Nicotine pretreatment protected mice from renal dysfunction in a dose-dependent manner and through the α7nAChR, as attested by the absence of protection in α7nAChR-deficient mice. Additionally, nicotine significantly reduced tubular damages, prevented neutrophil infiltration and decreased productions of the CXC-chemokine KC, TNF-α and the proinflammatory high-mobility group box 1 protein. Reduced tubular damage in nicotine pre-treated mice was associated with a decrease in tubular cell apoptosis and proliferative response as attested by the reduction of caspase-3 and Ki67 positive cells, respectively. All together, these data highlight that nicotine exerts a protective anti-inflammatory effect during kidney I/R through the cholinergic α7nAChR pathway. In addition, this could provide an opportunity to overcome the effect of surgical cholinergic denervation during kidney transplantation."

https://openalex.org/W1972256954,"Previous studies from our laboratory have shown anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of 3,3′-diindolylmethane (DIM) through regulation of Akt and androgen receptor (AR) in prostate cancer cells. However, the mechanism by which DIM regulates Akt and AR signaling pathways has not been fully investigated. It has been known that FOXO3a and glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), two targets of activated Akt, interact with β-catenin, regulating cell proliferation and apoptotic cell death. More importantly, FOXO3a, GSK-3β, and β-catenin are all AR coregulators and regulate the activity of AR, mediating the development and progression of prostate cancers. Here, we investigated the molecular effects of B-DIM, a formulated DIM with higher bioavailability, on Akt/FOXO3a/GSK-3β/β-catenin/AR signaling in hormone-sensitive LNCaP and hormone-insensitive C4-2B prostate cancer cells. We found that B-DIM significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt and FOXO3a and increased the phosphorylation of β-catenin, leading to the inhibition of cell growth and induction of apoptosis. We also found that B-DIM significantly inhibited β-catenin nuclear translocation. By electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we found that B-DIM inhibited FOXO3a binding to the promoter of AR and promoted FOXO3a binding to the p27KIP1 promoter, resulting in the alteration of AR and p27KIP1 expression, the inhibition of cell proliferation, and the induction of apoptosis in both androgen-sensitive and -insensitive prostate cancer cells. These results suggest that B-DIM-induced cell growth inhibition and apoptosis induction are partly mediated through the regulation of Akt/FOXO3a/GSK-3β/β-catenin/AR signaling. Therefore, B-DIM could be a promising non-toxic agent for possible treatment of hormone-sensitive but most importantly hormone-refractory prostate cancers.

Regulation of FOXO3a/β-catenin/GSK-3β signaling by 3,3′-diindolylmethane contributes to inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.Journal of Biological ChemistryVol. 288Issue 48PreviewVOLUME 282 (2007) PAGES 21542–21550 Full-Text PDF Open Access Prostate cancer has become a significant health problem in the United States because of its high incidence and mortality (1Jemal A. Siegel R. Ward E. Murray T. Xu J. Smigal C. Thun M.J. CA-Cancer J. Clin. 2006; 56: 106-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (5513) Google Scholar). Despite an initial efficacy of androgen-deprivation therapy, most patients with prostate cancer progress from androgen-dependent status to hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) 2The abbreviations used are: HRPC, hormone-refractory prostate cancer; AR, androgen receptor; DIM, 3,3′-diindolylmethane; GSK, glycogen synthase kinase; FOXO, Forkhead transcription factor class O; IGF, insulin-like growth factor; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation. 2The abbreviations used are: HRPC, hormone-refractory prostate cancer; AR, androgen receptor; DIM, 3,3′-diindolylmethane; GSK, glycogen synthase kinase; FOXO, Forkhead transcription factor class O; IGF, insulin-like growth factor; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation. for which there is no curative therapy. It is still unclear how the prostate cancer cells progress to androgen independence. However, more evidence indicates that androgen receptor (AR) and Akt pathways participate in the development of HRPC (2Chen C.D. Welsbie D.S. Tran C. Baek S.H. Chen R. Vessella R. Rosenfeld M.G. Sawyers C.L. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (1960) Google Scholar, 3Mulholland D.J. Dedhar S. Wu H. Nelson C.C. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). It has been known that during the progression of prostate cancers from androgen-sensitive status to an androgen-independent stage, the majority of prostate cancer cells still expresses AR, suggesting that AR signaling plays a critical role in the development and progression of prostate cancer (4Heinlein C.A. Chang C. Endocr. Rev. 2004; 25: 276-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). In prostate epithelial cells, ligand-free AR is sequestered in the cytoplasm bound to heat shock proteins. Binding of androgen to the AR induces a AR conformational change, which allows dissociation of heat shock proteins. The AR then forms a homodimer and is phosphorylated. This phosphorylation stabilizes the ligand-AR complex and the complex translocates to the nucleus (5Edwards J. Bartlett J.M. BJU Int. 2005; 95: 1320-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The activated AR then initiates gene transcription by binding to specific androgen-response elements in the promoter regions of target genes. Evidence is emerging showing that phosphorylation of the AR by other molecules in cell signaling pathways can also influence AR transactivation (6Lee H.J. Chang C. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1613-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). It has been found that Akt can phosphorylate the AR at Ser-210/213 and Ser-790/791 and transactivate the activity of AR (7Lin H.K. Yeh S. Kang H.Y. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7200-7205Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 8Wen Y. Hu M.C. Makino K. Spohn B. Bartholomeusz G. Yan D.H. Hung M.C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6841-6845PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphorylation by Akt also sensitizes the AR to low circulating levels of androgen, such as those present during maximum androgen blockade (9Rochette-Egly C. Cell. Signal. 2003; 15: 355-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). This sensitization allows low levels of androgen to induce phosphorylation at specific sites required for translocation of the AR to the nucleus. Therefore, Akt is another activator of AR required for androgen-independent survival and growth of prostate cancer cells. Akt can be activated by the lipid kinase phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (10Franke T.F. Hornik C.P. Segev L. Shostak G.A. Sugimoto C. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8983-8998Crossref PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar). The activated Akt can inhibit apoptosis by direct phosphorylation of its downstream molecules (10Franke T.F. Hornik C.P. Segev L. Shostak G.A. Sugimoto C. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8983-8998Crossref PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar). Two of the important targets of Akt-mediated phosphorylation are the Forkhead transcription factor class O (FOXO) and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3). The family of FOXO mainly includes FOXO1, FOXO3a, and FOXO4. By binding to the nuclear importer, active FOXO3a translocates to the nucleus, binds to DNA, and promotes the transcription of its target genes, inducing either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis (11Burgering B.M. Kops G.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 352-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). However, activated Akt regulates transcription of FOXO3a target genes through modulation of FOXO3a activity by phosphorylating it at three conserved serine/threonine residues (Thr-32, Ser-253, and Ser-315), leading to the release of FOXO3a from DNA and translocation to the cytoplasm (11Burgering B.M. Kops G.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 352-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 12Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5427) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a recent report shows that FOXO3a also promotes the transcription of AR (13Yang L. Xie S. Jamaluddin M.S. Altuwaijri S. Ni J. Kim E. Chen Y.T. Hu Y.C. Wang L. Chuang K.H. Wu C.T. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33558-33565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Therefore, Akt/FOXO3a/AR signaling appears to play important roles in the development of hormone-refractory prostate cancer. GSK-3, including GSK-3α and GSK-3β, has been implicated in a variety of physiological processes such as induction of apoptosis (10Franke T.F. Hornik C.P. Segev L. Shostak G.A. Sugimoto C. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8983-8998Crossref PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar). GSK-3β also controls cell survival through regulation of β-catenin, one of the important molecules in Wnt signaling (14Kikuchi A. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 777-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In the nucleus, β-catenin acts as a transcriptional coactivator and activates genes involved in cell proliferation and survival. GSK-3β binds to β-catenin and induces phosphorylation of β-catenin, which is subsequently ubiquitinated and degraded via the protosome pathway within the cytoplasmic compartment (14Kikuchi A. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 777-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 15Deng J. Xia W. Miller S.A. Wen Y. Wang H.Y. Hung M.C. Mol.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1443-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar). The activity of GSK-3β can be inhibited through phosphorylation at Ser-9 by activated Akt, resulting in more nonphosphorylated β-catenin moving into the nucleus. Importantly, GSK-3β and β-catenin are two important AR co-regulators, which regulate transcriptional activity of AR and play important roles in the development of clinical androgen escape by regulation of AR oncogenic functions (3Mulholland D.J. Dedhar S. Wu H. Nelson C.C. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 17Salas T.R. Kim J. Vakar-Lopez F. Sabichi A.L. Troncoso P. Jenster G. Kikuchi A. Chen S.Y.

Moreover, both GSK-3β and β-catenin can interact with molecules (including IKK, p105, etc.) in the NF-κB cell signaling pathway (15Deng J. Xia W. Miller S.A. Wen Y. Wang H.Y. Hung M.C. Mol. Carcinog. 2004; 39: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 19Demarchi F. Bertoli C. Sandy P. Schneider C. J. Biol.

Therefore, Akt/GSK-3β/β-catenin/AR signaling may play important roles in the development of HRPC and specific targeting of these signaling pathways could be important for killing HRPC cells. Studies from our laboratory and others have found that 3,3′-diindilylmethane (DIM) shows potent antiproliferative activities against various cancers including prostate cancer (21Firestone G.L. Bjeldanes L.F. J. Nutr. 2003; 133 (S): 2448S-2455Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Nachshon-Kedmi M. Yannai S. Haj A. Fares F.A. Food Chem.

Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 1297-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). We have also reported that B-DIM, a formulated DIM with higher bioavailability in vivo (24Anderton M.J. Manson M.M. Verschoyle R. Gescher A. Steward W.P. Williams M.L. Mager D.E. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2004; 32: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), induces growth inhibition and apoptotic cell death in both androgen-sensitive LNCaP and androgen-insensitive C4-2B prostate cancer cells through the down-regulation of AR and Akt (25Bhuiyan M.M. Li Y. Banerjee S. Ahmed F. Wang Z. Ali S. Sarkar F.H. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 10064-10072Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, no studies have been reported to date to elucidate the effect and molecular mechanisms of action of B-DIM on FOXO3a/GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling in prostate cancer cells, especially in HRPC cells. Here we report, for the first time, that B-DIM is a potent agent for inducing growth inhibition and apoptotic cell death in both androgen-sensitive LNCaP and androgen-insensitive C4-2B prostate cancer cells partly mediated through the inactivation of Akt/FOXO3a/GSK-3β/β-catenin/AR signaling pathways. Cell Lines, Reagents, and Antibodies—Human prostate cancer cell lines including LNCaP and C4-2B cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. B-DIM (BioResponse, Boulder, CO; known as BR-DIM and referred as B-DIM) was generously provided by Dr. Michael Zeligs and was dissolved in Me2SO to make a 50 mm stock solution. IGF-1 was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) and LY294002 was from Sigma. Anti-AR (Santa Cruz Biologicals, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-Akt (Santa Cruz), anti-pAkt Ser-473 (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), anti-FOXO3a (Cell Signaling), anti-pFOXO3a Ser-253 (Cell Signaling), anti-pFOXO3a Thr-32 (Cell Signaling), anti-β-catenin (Cell Signaling), anti-p-β-catenin Ser-33/37/Thr-41 (Cell Signaling), anti-GSK-3 (Upstate), anti-karyopherin α (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA), anti-karyopherin β (BD Biosciences), and anti-β-actin (Sigma) primary antibodies were used for immunoprecipitation, Western blot analysis, or immunofluorescent staining. Cell Proliferation Inhibition Studies by 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium Bromide Assay—Human LNCaP and C4-2B prostate cancer cells were seeded in 96-well plates. After 24 h, the complete medium was removed and the cells were washed with serum-free medium. The cells were then incubated in serum-free medium supplemented with 100 ng/ml IGF-1, 50 μm B-DIM, or 50 μm B-DIM plus 100 ng/ml IGF-1 for 48 h. Control cells were treated with 0.1% Me2SO (vehicle control). After treatment, the cells were incubated with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (0.5 mg/ml, Sigma) in medium at 37 °C for 2 h and then with isopropyl alcohol at room temperature for 1 h. The spectrophotometric absorbance of the samples was determined by using Ultra Multifunctional Microplate Reader (Tecan, Durham, NC) at 595 nm. The growth inhibition of LNCaP and C4-2B cells by B-DIM treatment was statistically evaluated with Student’s t test using GraphPad StatMate software (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). Comparisons were made between control and treatment. p value less than 0.05 was used to indicate statistical significance. Histone/DNA ELISA for Detection of Apoptosis—The Cell Death Detection ELISA Kit (Roche, Palo Alto, CA) was used to detect apoptosis in prostate cancer cells treated with B-DIM according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, LNCaP and C4-2B cells were treated with 100 ng/ml IGF-1, 50 μm B-DIM, or 50 μm B-DIM plus 100 ng/ml IGF-1 for 48 h as described above. The cytoplasmic histone/DNA fragments from these cells were then extracted and incubated in microtiter plate modules coated with anti-histone antibody. Subsequently, the peroxidase-conjugated anti-DNA antibody was used for the detection of immobilized histone/DNA fragments followed by color development with ABTS substrate for peroxidase. The spectrophotometric absorbance of the samples was determined by using Ultra Multifunctional Microplate Reader (Tecan) at 405 nm. The induction of apoptosis by B-DIM treatment in LNCaP and C4-2B cells was statistically evaluated with Student’s t test using GraphPad StatMate software (GraphPad Software Inc.). Comparisons were made between control and treatment. p value less than 0.05 was used to indicate statistical significance. Preparation of Cytoplasmic and Nuclear Lysates—LNCaP and C4-2B cells were treated with 50 μm B-DIM for 48 and 72 h. After treatment and harvesting, the cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (0.08 m KCl, 35 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 25 mm CaCl2, 0.15 m sucrose, 2mm PMSF, 8 mm dithiothreitol) and frozen at -80 °C overnight. The cell suspension was thawed and passed through a 28-gauge needle three times. A small aliquot of the cells were checked for cell membrane breakage using trypan blue. Then, the cell suspension was centrifuged and the supernatant were saved as cytoplasmic lysate. The pellet was suspended in lysis buffer and the nuclei were lysed by sonication. After centrifugation, supernatant was saved as nuclear lysate. The pellet was further lysed in 62 mm Tris-HCl and 2% SDS as membrane lysate. The protein concentration in each sample was measured using Coomassie Plus Protein Assay (Pierce). To clarify the absence of membrane proteins in cytoplasmic and nuclear lysates, we tested the presence of E-cadherin (a protein mainly detected in cytoplasmic membrane) and lamin B (a protein mainly detected in nuclear membrane and less amount in nucleus) using cytoplasmic, nuclear, and membrane lysates by Western blot analysis. The results showed that cytoplasmic and nuclear lysates did not contain E-cadherin, whereas membrane lysate had high levels of E-cadherin and lamin B (data not shown), demonstrating the absence of membrane proteins in cytoplasmic and nuclear lysate. Immunoprecipitation—Nuclear lysate (500 μg) and cytoplasmic lysate (800 μg) were diluted and subjected to immunoprecipitation using 2.5-5 μg of anti-AR, anti-FOXO3a, or anti-β-catenin antibody. The lysate and antibody mixtures were incubated overnight at 4 °C with rotation. After adding 50 μl of Protein G-agarose (Santa Cruz) and incubation for 1 h, the samples were centrifuged. The agarose pellet was then washed three times, resuspended in 50 μl of Laemmli buffer with 2-mercaptoethanol, and boiled for 5 min. Boiled samples were centrifuged and supernatant was used for Western blot analysis. Western Blot Analysis—LNCaP and C4-2B cells were treated with 50 μm B-DIM for 24-72 h. Whole cell lysate of the cells was prepared by sonicating the cell lysed in 62 mm Tris-HCl and 2% SDS. The protein concentration was measured by BCA Protein Assay (Pierce). Immunoprecipitates and whole cell lysates were subjected to 10 or 14% SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were incubated with the indicated primary antibodies, and subsequently incubated with appropriate secondary antibody conjugated with peroxidase (Bio-Rad) or TrueBlot secondary antibody (eBioscience, San Diego, CA). The signal was then detected using the chemiluminescent detection system (Pierce) and quantified with AlphaEaseFC software (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). Immunofluorescence Staining—LNCaP and C4-2B cells were plated on coverslips in each well of a 6-well plate. Cells were then treated with 50 μm B-DIM for 24-72 h. Cells were then fixed with acetone for 15 min, rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min. The cells were then incubated with anti-FOXO3a or anti-β-catenin antibody at 4 °C overnight. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated (1:100, Santa Cruz) or Texas Red-conjugated (1:100, Santa Cruz) secondary antibody at 37 °C for 1 h and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Cell images were observed under a fluorescent microscope. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—EMSA was conducted to measure the activity of FOXO3a binding to AR or p27KIP1 promoter in B-DIM-treated and untreated cells. LNCaP and C4-2B cells were treated as described above. Following treatment, cells were harvested and incubated in ice-cold cell lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm PMSF, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 mg/ml benzamidine) on ice. After 15 min, Nonidet P-40 was added to the cell suspension at a final concentration of 0.3% and the samples were vortexed vigorously for 20 s. After centrifugation, the supernatant was saved as cytoplasmic protein and the nuclear pellet was incubated in ice-cold nuclear extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm PMSF, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 mg/ml benzamidine) on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation, the supernatant was saved as nuclear protein and the protein concentration was measured using the BCA Protein Assay (Pierce). 8 μg of nuclear protein was assembled with 10 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 6 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Tween 20, 0.08 mg/ml poly(dI)-poly(dC), and 0.01 μm IR Dye 700 or 800-labeled oligonucleotide (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE), which contains AR or p27KIP1 promoter sequences with a consensus FOXO3a DNA binding site. The sequences of oligonucleotides are as follows: 5′-ATTATGTCCTTGTTTCAGCCTGTT-3′ for AR; 5′-ATGTGTAGCTTGTTTTCTTAGCCAC-3′ for p27KIP1 (13Yang L. Xie S. Jamaluddin M.S. Altuwaijri S. Ni J. Kim E.

After incubation at room temperature for 30 min, the samples were loaded on a pre-run 4.5 (for AR) or 8% (for KIP1) polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresis was continued at 100 volts for 60 min. The signal was then detected and quantified by using Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR). Supershift assay using FOXO3a antibody was also conducted to confirm the specificity of FOXO3a DNA-binding activity. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—ChIP assay was performed to test the effect of B-DIM on FOXO3a binding to AR or p27KIP1 promoter under an in vivo environment. Briefly, LNCaP and C4-2B cells were treated with 50 μm B-DIM for 48 h. Formaldehyde was then added to the cells at a final concentration of 1%. After formaldehyde cross-linking the reaction was quenched with 125 mm glycine, the cells were incubated in cell lysis buffer (5 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 85 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm PMSF) on ice for 10 min. The nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in nuclear lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm PMSF). After incubation on ice for 10 min, the nuclear lysates were sonicated to generate an average DNA size of ∼600 bp and the protein concentration was measured using BCA Protein Assay (Pierce). 1000 μg of each sample were diluted and 200 μg of diluted sample were kept as input. The remaining sample was incubated with FOXO3a antibody (Santa Cruz) at 4 °C overnight. The FOXO3a antibody-bound AR and p27KIP1 promoter DNA complexes were pelleted with Protein G-agarose at 4 °C for 2 h. After washing and elution, the immunoprecipitated complexes and input were reversed from cross-linking by adding RNase and 0.3 m NaCl and heating at 65 °C for 5 h. The input DNA and immunoprecipitated DNA were then precipitated with ethanol. After being treated with proteinase K and purified with phenol/chloroform, the purified DNA was precipitated again with ethanol. Real-time and conventional PCRs were performed using purified DNA (input DNA for β-actin and FOXO3a immunoprecipitated DNA for AR or p27KIP1 promoter with FOXO3a binding site) and the following primers: AR promoter (forward, 5′-AGCCTTTCCCAAATGACAATG-3′; reverse, 5′-GCACAGCCAAACATCATAGG-3′), p27KIP1 promoter (forward, 5′-GTCCCTTCCAGCTGTCACAT-3′; reverse, 5′-GGAAACCAACCTTCCGTTCT-3′), β-actin (forward, 5′-CCACACTGTGCCCATCTACG-3′; reverse, 5′-AGGATCTTCATGAGGTAGTCAGTCAG-3′). For real-time PCR, data were analyzed according to the comparative Ct method and the amount of FOXO3a-bound AR or p27KIP1 promoter DNA was normalized by input β-actin DNA. For conventional PCR, PCR product was visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. Inhibition of FOXO3a Phosphorylation by B-DIM—We previously reported that B-DIM significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt and the expression of AR in LNCaP and C4-2B prostate cancer cells (25Bhuiyan M.M. Li Y. Banerjee S. Ahmed F. Wang Z. Ali S. Sarkar F.H. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 10064-10072Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To further investigate how B-DIM suppresses the expression of AR through the inhibition of Akt phosphorylation, we tested the effects of B-DIM on FOXO3a, one of the main downstream target genes of Akt. We observed that phosphorylation of Akt and FOXO3a was up-regulated by IGF-1 and down-regulated by LY294002 in prostate cancer cells as expected (Fig. 1, A and C). We found that B-DIM significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of FOXO3a in C4-2B and LNCaP cells (Fig. 1B). Moreover, B-DIM abrogated the up-regulation of Akt and FOXO3a phosphorylation induced by IGF-1 (Fig. 1, A-C). Furthermore, we found that B-DIM significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of FOXO3a at Thr-32 and Ser-253 and decreased the ratio of p-FOXO3a over FOXO3a in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of prostate cancer cells (Fig. 1C), suggesting that B-DIM could help to retain a greater amount of FOXO3a in the activated form to inhibit cancer cell growth. By immunoprecipitation, we found that B-DIM significantly inhibited the formation of FOXO3a and Akt complex in the cytosol and nucleus of prostate cancer cells (Fig. 1D), consistent with Akt inactivation and the subsequent decrease of FOXO3a phosphorylation by B-DIM treatment. We also found that B-DIM significantly decreased the formation of the FOXO3a and AR complex, which could inhibit FOXO3a activity in both cytoplasmic and nuclear components (Fig. 1D), suggesting that a greater level of active FOXO3a proteins will exert their anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects on B-DIM-treated cells. It has been known that activated Akt also phosphorylates and inactivates GSK-3β, leading to the dephosphorylation of β-catenin and cancer cell survival. β-Catenin also interacts with FOXO3a to regulate cell growth. Therefore, we further investigated the effects of B-DIM on GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling. Increased GSK-3β Binding to β-Catenin and Induction of β-Catenin Phosphorylation by B-DIM—By Western blot analysis, we found that B-DIM significantly decreased the level of β-catenin protein in the cytosol and nucleus of C4-2B cells (Fig. 2, A and B). More importantly, we found that B-DIM enhanced the phosphorylation of β-catenin and increased the ratio of p-β-catenin over β-catenin in the nucleus of C4-2B cells (Fig. 2B). By immunoprecipitation, we discovered that GSK-3β binding to β-catenin was increased upon B-DIM treatment (Fig. 2C), consistent with the increase in the phosphorylation of β-catenin. We also found that B-DIM inhibited FOXO3a binding to β-catenin (Fig. 2C). In LNCaP cells, we also observed similar effects of B-DIM on the down-regulation of the β-catenin level and up-regulation of β-catenin phosphorylation (data not shown). These results suggest that B-DIM treatment leads to a greater level of inactivated β-catenin and less of activated β-catenin in prostate cancer cells, causing a decrease in the activated β-catenin in the nucleus of prostate cancer cells. Therefore, we further investigated the location of β-catenin and FOXO3a altered by B-DIM treatment. Inhibition of β-Catenin Nuclear Localization by B-DIM—Indeed, we observed a lower level of β-catenin protein in the nucleus after B-DIM treatment (Fig. 2, A and B). By immunofluorescent staining, we found that B-DIM significantly inhibited the nuclear localization of β-catenin; however, no significant change in the nuclear localization of FOXO"
https://openalex.org/W2086642544,"To perform recognition, molecules must locate and specifically bind their targets within a noisy biochemical environment with many look-alikes. Molecular recognition processes, especially the induced-fit mechanism, are known to involve conformational changes. This arises a basic question: does molecular recognition gain any advantage by such conformational changes? By introducing a simple statistical-mechanics approach, we study the effect of conformation and flexibility on the quality of recognition processes. Our model relates specificity to the conformation of the participant molecules and thus suggests a possible answer: Optimal specificity is achieved when the ligand is slightly off target, that is a conformational mismatch between the ligand and its main target improves the selectivity of the process.

To analyze fibrate-induced changes of complex metabolic networks, we have compared the proteome of rat liver peroxisomes from control and bezafibrate-treated rats. Highly purified peroxisomes were subfractionated, and the proteins of the matrix, peripheral, and integral membrane subfractions thus obtained were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight/time-of-flight mass spectrometry after labeling of tryptic peptides with the iTRAQ reagent. By means of this quantitative technique, we were able to identify 134 individual proteins, covering most of the known peroxisomal proteome. Ten predicted new open reading frames were verified by cDNA cloning, and seven of them could be localized to peroxisomes by immunocytochemistry. Moreover, quantitative mass spectrometry substantiated the induction of most of the known peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α-regulated peroxisomal proteins upon treatment with bezafibrate, documenting the suitability of the iTRAQ procedure in larger scale experiments. However, not all proteins reacted to a similar extent but exerted a fibrate-specific induction scheme showing the variability of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptorα-transmitted responses to specific ligands. In view of our data, rat hepatic peroxisomes are apparently not specialized to sequester very long chain fatty acids (C22–C26) but rather metabolize preferentially long chain fatty acids (C16–18).

Peroxisomes, often described as multipurpose organelles, are involved in numerous biochemical pathways of lipid and peroxide metabolism. The existence of more than 15 peroxisomal inherited diseases like the Zellweger syndrome or X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, which are often lethal, emphasizes the vital importance of these organelles (1Raymond G.V. Curr. Opin. Pediatr. 1999; 11: 572-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 2Moser H.W. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5 (–D306): D298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Schluter A. Fourcade S.

Cells are able to remodel the protein composition of their peroxisomes and to adjust the number of these organelles in response to physiological or environmental stimuli to cope with the metabolic needs. Consequently, peroxisomes are regarded as highly modular organelles, with different protein composition depending on the metabolic function or cell type. Fibrates, used as hypolipidemic drugs, induce both the proliferation of peroxisomes as well as the β-oxidation of fatty acids (4Lazarow P.B. De Duve C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2043-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar). These alterations of the metabolic functions of peroxisomes are accompanied by changes of proteins involved in the biogenesis of the organelles as well as in enzymes for the breakdown of fatty acids (5Lazarow P.B. Fujiki Y. Mortensen R. Hashimoto T. FEBS Lett. 1982; 150: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 6Fahimi H.D. Reinicke A. Sujatta M. Yokota S. Ozel M. Hartig F. Stegmeier K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1982; 386: 111-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Several investigators in the past have used fibrate-induced peroxisome proliferation as a model to analyze selected aspects of peroxisome biogenesis or lipid metabolism, using techniques like Western blotting, enzyme assays, immunocytochemistry, Northern blotting, or in situ hybridization (6Fahimi H.D. Reinicke A. Sujatta M. Yokota S. Ozel M. Hartig F. Stegmeier K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1982; 386: 111-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 7Leighton F. Coloma L. Koenig C. J.

However, complex rearrangements of the entire peroxisomal proteome could not be analyzed with these techniques. In this respect, mass spectrometry represents a straightforward alternative, particularly because of the development of more sensitive analyzers and the introduction of isotope labeling reagents (12Ong S.E. Mann M. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2005; 1: 252-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar). Thus, it is now possible to characterize the different physiological states of an organelle structure by top-down quantitative mass spectrometry because of its ability to identify hydrophobic polypeptides, like integral membrane proteins (13Wu C.C. MacCoss M.J. Howell K.E. Yates J.R. II I Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 508-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 14Goshe M.B. Blonder J. Smith R.D. J.

Mann M. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 874-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), and to record modulations of selected pathways in response to exogenous stimuli. Last but not least, it enables the identification of previously undetected proteins and their integration into a cellular network as a basis for further functional studies. Because of their small proteome, peroxisomes represent a model of comparably low complexity suitable to use quantitative MS 3The abbreviations used are: MS, mass spectrometry; ACOX1, acyl-CoA oxidase 1; d-PBE, peroxisomal D-bifunctional enzyme; l-PBE, peroxisomal l-bifunctional enzyme; Tysnd1, trypsin domain containing 1; ACBD, acyl-CoA binding domain; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropane-sulfonic acid; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; ALDP, adrenoleukodystrophy protein. in a functional approach. By using this technique, we have analyzed the peroxisomal proteome in response to fibrate treatment with the aim to elucidate complex proteome rearrangements, to identify undetected proteins, and to define their subcellular location and organelle-specific functions. In our analysis we isolated peroxisomes from bezafibrate-treated and control rats by means of density gradient centrifugation using a standardized procedure (18Voölkl A. Fahimi H.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 149: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To further increase the precision of the analysis, isolated peroxisomes were carefully subfractionated into matrix and peripheral as well as integral membrane protein fractions to enrich low abundant proteins. The proteins were directly digested with trypsin and labeled with iTRAQ reagent for quantitative liquid chromatography-MS/MS analysis. Thus, we were able to identify 134 proteins, including 15 new predicted open reading frames. Ten of them could be verified by cDNA cloning, and seven were shown to localize at least partially to peroxisomes. The quantitative assessment of protein abundance in response to the fibrate treatment revealed no new fibrate-induced protein species. Convincing evidence, however, is provided by the quite distinct induction rates of long chain fatty acid synthetase and PMP70 in contrast to very long chain fatty acid synthetase and ALDP and the finding that long chain fatty acids (C16–C18) rather than very long chain fatty acids (C22–C26) are the primary substrates of rat liver peroxisomes after fibrate treatment. Maintenance and Bezafibrate Treatment of Rats—Female Sprague-Dawley rats (200–300 g) were kept in accordance with the guidelines of the humane care and use of laboratory animals at the Zentrale Versuchstieranlage, University of Heidelberg, Germany. Each of 50 animals was fed for 10 days with 20 g of Altromin 1324 (Altromin International, Lage, Germany) containing 1 mg/g bezafibrate (Roche Diagnostics), equaling a dose of ∼75 mg/kg body weight. The control group of 70 animals was fed with the same amount of untreated Altromin 1324. After the 10-day treatment, the animals were starved overnight and anesthetized with chloral hydrate. Subsequently, livers were excised, weighed, and minced in ice-cold homogenization buffer (250 mm sucrose, 5 mm MOPS, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% ethanol, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ɛ-aminocaproic acid, pH 7.2). Isolation and Subfractionation of Peroxisomes—Homogenization of the tissue and subcellular fractionation was performed according to Voölkl and Fahimi (18Voölkl A. Fahimi H.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 149: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) with a few modifications described by Weber and co-workers (19Weber G. Islinger M. Weber P. Eckerskorn C. Voelkl A. Electrophoresis. 2004; 25: 1735-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Finally, purified peroxisomes were washed once with gradient buffer (5 mm MOPS, 1mm EDTA, 0.1% ethanol, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ɛ-aminocaproic acid, pH 7.2) and stored at –80 °C. For subfractionation into matrix, peripheral, and integral membrane compartments, peroxisomes were thawed and centrifuged at 30,000 × g, resulting in supernatant S1 and pellet P1. P1 was resuspended in TVBE buffer (1 mm Na2CO3, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% ethanol, 0.01% Triton X-100, pH 7.6), supplemented to 0.1% Triton and sonicated with two 15-s pulses at 100 watts for quantitative membrane disruption. Thereafter, a second centrifugation step at 100,000 × g for 30 min, resulted in a first membrane pellet (P2) and supernatant S2. To remove peripherally attached proteins, P2 was suspended in 250 mm KCl and centrifuged again at 100,000 × g (S3 and P3). Subsequently, P3 was suspended in 100 mm Na2CO3 and kept on ice for 30 min. After a final centrifugation at 100,000 × g, the supernatant (S4), containing mainly the core protein urate oxidase (>90%), was discarded, and the integral membrane pellet (P4) was washed and stored in gradient buffer. For the matrix fraction, S1 and S2 were combined, concentrated with VivaSpin columns (MW 5000, Sartorius, Goettingen, Germany), and dialyzed in gradient buffer. Supernatant S3 was concentrated and dialyzed in the same way to obtain a fraction of peripherally attached membrane proteins. iTRAQ Labeling and Liquid Chromatography-MS/MS—To ensure that equal protein amounts were subjected to iTRAQ labeling, first protein concentrations of the subfractions were determined by the Bradford method. For a more precise comparison of protein amounts in the membrane fractions, aliquots of all three subfractions were run on an SDS gel and stained with Coomassie Blue. Thereafter, staining intensity of the protein pattern was compared by densitometric analysis of the gel (Quantity One Software, Bio-Rad). Peroxisomal proteins (100 μg per sample) were trypsin-digested (membrane pellets were first solubilized in 0.8% RapiGest, Waters) and tagged with iTRAQ reagents according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems). The iTRAQ-labeled peptides were resolved in the first-dimensional liquid chromatography with a polysulfoethyl A column. Peptides were eluted with a linear gradient of 0–500 mm KCl in 20% acetonitrile, 10 mm KH2PO4, pH 2.9, over 25 min at a flow rate of 50 μl/min. Fractions were collected at 1-min intervals, dried, and redissolved in 30 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. For the second-dimensional liquid chromatography, 10 μl were injected into a capillary C18 column (150 × 100 mm inner diameter. column) at 500 nl/min and separated with a linearly increasing concentration of acetonitrile from 5 to 50% in 30 min and to 100% in 5 min. The eluent was mixed with matrix (7 mg of α-cyanohydroxycinnaminic acid in 1 ml of 50% acetronitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 10 mm dicitrate ammonium) delivered at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min and deposited off-line to the Applied Biosystems metal target every 15 s for a total of 192 spots, and analyzed on an ABI 4700 proteomics analyzer. Peptide CID was performed at 1 kV; the collision gas was nitrogen. MS/MS spectra were collected from 5000 laser shots. The peptides with signal to noise ratio above 50 at the MS mode were selected for MS/MS experiment; a maximum of 30 MS/MS was allowed per spot. The precursor mass window was 180 relative resolution (at full width half-maximum). MS/MS spectra were searched against the rat and mice data bases (Celera Discovery System, CDS) using GPS Explorer (ABI) and Mascot (MatrixScience) with trypsin specificity and fixed iTRAQ modifications at lysine residue and the N termini of the peptides. Mass tolerance was 100 ppm for precursor ions and 0.5 Da for fragment ions; one missed cleavage was allowed. For each MS/MS spectrum, a single peptide annotation with the highest Mascot score was retrieved. CDS protein sequence redundancy was removed by clustering the precursor protein sequences of the retrieved peptides using the cluster algorithm Cd hit (20Li W. Godzik A. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2006; 22: 1658-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (6447) Google Scholar) at a sequence similarity threshold of 90%. Subsequently, all peptides were matched against the obtained protein clusters; those peptides that matched more than one protein cluster represent common sequences between proteins and were not considered for protein identification and quantification. For quantification, peak areas for each iTRAQ signature peak were obtained and corrected according to the manufacturer’s instruction to account for the differences in isotopic overlap. To compensate for the possible variation in the starting amount between the samples, the individual peak areas of each iTRAQ signature peak were log2-transformed to obtain a normal distribution and then normalized to the total peak area of this signature peak. Low signature peaks generally have larger variation, which may compromise the quantitative analysis of the proteins. Therefore, the iTRAQ signature peaks lower than 2000 were removed from quantitation. Within an MS experiment a Student’s t test was used over bezafibrate versus control groups. In the mass spectrometry, samples of peripheral and integral membrane proteins were run in parallel to obtain quantitative information on proteins retained at the membrane after carbonate stripping (data not shown). Because most of the proteins detected in the peripheral fraction were found in the matrix as well but specifically enriched proteins were not detected, the data for these subgroups were combined in Table 4. The ratio obtained for individual proteins identified in both groups was used to calculate a conjoint value for the induction in both subfractions to reduce data complexity. The mass spectrometry of the peroxisomal matrix was done independently, in a double experiment, and hence the quantitative measurements are shown as autonomous data. As a threshold for proteins presented, we used the identification of at least three peptides with the ion score of the highest peptide match >95% or two peptides with the highest peptide match >99%. For completion, some known peroxisomal proteins with identification rates below the threshold (indicated in Table 4) were included in the lists, because of the high probability of detection in a fraction of isolated peroxisomes. Nevertheless, only proteins detected with at least three peptides (peak area > 2000) were considered for quantification.TABLE 4List of protein identifications Open table in a new tab Immunoblotting of Selected Peroxisomal Proteins and Enzyme Assays—Western blotting was performed according to the semi-dry method using polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (21Kyhse-Andersen J. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1984; 10: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (2159) Google Scholar). Antibodies used for the immunodetection of selected proteins are of rabbit origin and were raised as published previously (uricase, PMP70, catalase, l-bifunctional enzyme, hydroxyacid oxidase, and acyl-CoA oxidase 1) or kind gifts from T. Hashimoto, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Nagano, Japan (long chain fatty acid CoA ligase 1, PMP22, and Pex11α), J. Adamski, GSF-Neuherberg, Germany (d-bifunctional enzyme), and G. Dodt, University of Tuebingen, Germany (Pex14). The polyclonal antibodies against GRP78/BiP and PECI were purchased from BD Biosciences. The activity of acyl-CoA oxidase 1 (ACOX1) was determined according to Small et al. (22Small G.M. Burdett K. Connock M.J. Biochem. J. 1985; 227: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) and total β-oxidation activities as described by Lazarow and De Duve (4Lazarow P.B. De Duve C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2043-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar). Enzyme activities of catalase, esterase, cytochrome c oxidase, and acid phosphatase were performed as described previously (18Voölkl A. Fahimi H.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 149: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Plasmids and Cloning of Expression Vectors for Newly Identified Peroxisomal Proteins—For the cloning of newly identified potential peroxisomal proteins, total rat liver RNA was isolated using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and reversetranscribed into cDNA by SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Primers spanning the whole predicted open reading frame of the genes of interest were synthesized at MWG (Muönchen, Germany). PCR amplification of the target cDNAs was performed using Pfx polymerase (Invitrogen), and the amplicon was directly cloned into TOPO II vectors. After sequencing of the inserts (GATC, Konstanz, Germany), the open reading frames were isolated and ligated into pCMV-Tag vectors (Stratagene, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) for generation of fusions with the Myc epitope. For expression of Myc fusion proteins in mammalian cell lines, the coding regions were under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. Except for protein sequences with predicted PTS1 signals at the C terminus where only N-terminal cDNA versions were constructed, both C- and N-terminally tagged versions were generated (see Table 1). For the analysis of wild-type protein variants, open reading frames of XP_237252.1 (ACBD5.2) and PMP52 were cloned into pCDNA3.1 vectors. In the case of XP_237252.1 (ACBD5) the 5′-end of the cDNA was determined using the GeneRacer RACE-PCR kit (Invitrogen). For cotransfection experiments, plasmid pDsRed (Clontech) or pGHL252 were used to visualize transgenic cells. The plasmid pGHL252 contains the sequence encoding a fusion protein (RFP-PTS1) of the red fluorescent protein (from pDsRed) with a peroxisomal targeting signal SKL under control of the murine ROSA26 promoter as well as an expression cassette for selection of bleomycin in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.TABLE 1Plasmid constructs used for microscopic investigationsProtein nameAbbreviation used in textProtein accession numberGenBank™ accession number of cDNAWild typeN-terminal tagC-terminal tagAcyl-CoA dehydrogenase family member 11Q80XL6XM_236582–Myc–δ3,δ2-Enoyl-CoA isomeraseNP_001009275BC088178.1–Myc–Zinc-binding alcohol dehydrogenase domain containing 2Zn-ADHXP_214526XM_001060611–Myc–Mosc domain containing protein 2MOSC2O88994AF095741.1–MycMycTrypsin domain containing 1Tysnd1XP_345107.1XP_001056113.1–Myc–PMP52PMP52NP_001013918NM_001013896+MycMycShort chain dehydrogenase 7bDhrs7bXP_213317.1BC086453.1–MycMycDhrs7b.2EF445633MycMycAcyl-CoA-binding protein ACBD5ACBD5.1XP_237252.1EF026991+MycMycACBD5.2EF026992MycMycPotential dienelactone hydrolaseNP_001008770.1BC088459.1–MycMycLactamase, β2NP_663356NM_001024247.1–Myc–Ezrin-radixin-moesin-binding phosphoproteinEBP 50Q9JJ19AF154336.1–Myc– Open table in a new tab Cell Culture and Cell Lines—Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and CHO-derived cells were maintained in Ham’s F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (PAA, Coölbe, Germany) in a fully humidified incubator at a temperature of 37 °C and an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. For visualization of peroxisomes in living cells, CHO cells were transfected with a mixture of plasmid pVgRXR (Invitrogen) and of plasmid pGHL97 (23Islinger M. Luöers G.H. Zischka H. Ueffing M. Voölkl A. Proteomics. 2006; 6: 804-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) that contains an expression cassette for a GFP-PTS1 fusion protein under control of the murine phosphoglycerate kinase promoter. Cell clones were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy for expression of the GFP-PTS1 fusion protein, and positive clones were isolated for further analysis. One of the resulting cell clones with homogeneous expression of the GFP-PTS1 was named BGL69 and was used in this study. Subcellular Localization of Epitope-tagged Proteins—For colocalization studies of epitope-tagged proteins with peroxisomes, expression vectors were transiently transfected into BGL69 cells cultured on glass coverslips using the Gene Porter system (Peqlab, Erlangen, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. After transfection, coverslips were washed with PBS and then fixed at room temperature in 4% freshly depolymerized paraformaldehyde in 0.15 m HEPES, pH 7.4, for 15 min. Cells were washed and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 and 0.2% Tween 20 in PBS. To reduce nonspecific binding of antibodies, cells were blocked for 30 min with Roti-Block (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) in PBS. Roti-Block was also used for dilution of specific primary and Cy3-labeled secondary antibodies. Cells were incubated with monoclonal primary antibodies against the Myc epitope (9E10, kindly provided by M. Schrader, University of Marburg, Germany) for 1 h. After washing the coverslips three times for 5 min, they were incubated with the Cy3-labeled goat anti-mouse antibodies (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) for 1 h. Control stainings were performed according to the same protocol except that the primary antibodies were omitted. After a final washing, the coverslips were mounted with 50% glycerol in PBS containing 1.5% (w/v) n-propyl gallate as an antifade. For visualization of mitochondria, living CHO cells were incubated in Ham’s F-12 medium supplemented with 0.5 μm MitoTracker Red (Invitrogen) for 30 min followed by an incubation in regular medium for 15 min. Cells were fixed and propagated for immunocytochemistry as described. For costaining of the Myc epitope in Mitotracker-labeled cells, the monoclonal anti-Myc antibodies were visualized using a Cy2-labeled goat anti-mouse antiserum (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany). Visualization of the endoplasmic reticulum with Concanavalin A was performed as described recently (23Islinger M. Luöers G.H. Zischka H. Ueffing M. Voölkl A. Proteomics. 2006; 6: 804-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Light microscopic analysis was carried out on a Leica DMRE fluorescence microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) with standard filters for detection of fluorescein isothiocyanate and Cy3. Digital images were acquired using a DXM1200F digital camera system with the Nikon ACT-1 software. Fibrates are known to induce hepatomegaly, to stimulate peroxisome proliferation, and to induce the enzymes involved in the β-oxidation of fatty acids (6Fahimi H.D. Reinicke A. Sujatta M. Yokota S. Ozel M. Hartig F. Stegmeier K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1982; 386: 111-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the bezafibrate treatment of animals was found to cause an increase in liver weight of 18.8% compared with untreated control animals (9.24 ± 1.06 versus 7.78 ± 0.64, p < 0.001). A more pronounced effect of the drug treatment was observed at the organellar level. Total peroxisomal protein increased from 26.5 to 102.4 μg/g liver, reflecting a 3.9-fold augmentation. Because this ratio was more or less consistent in all peroxisomal subfractions (matrix, 4.2, integral membrane fraction 3.3; peripheral membrane fraction, 3.7), peroxisomes were increased primarily in their number and to a lesser extent in size. In Table 2, the properties of peroxisomes isolated in up to 10 experiments are summarized. According to the values concerning catalase and β-oxidation activities, the peroxisomal fractions obtained are highly enriched (purity of ∼95%), with an average contamination by mitochondria and by endoplasmic reticulum of 2%, and hence are expected to meet the requirements for proteome analysis. To evaluate also the purity and contamination of peroxisomes isolated from bezafibrate-treated animals, we used the marker enzymes cytochrome c oxidase (mitochondria), esterase (endoplasmic reticulum), and acid phosphatase (lysosomes) to compare the former with “control peroxisomes.” Because of the increase in peroxisome number in response to the treatment, most contaminating organelles decreased. In detail, the activities of cytochrome c oxidase were reduced by the factor of 3.4 and of esterase by 1.92, whereas that of acid phosphatase was augmented by the factor of 2.3 (Table 3), although no lysosomal proteins could be identified in the MS analysis.TABLE 2Properties of the peroxisome fraction (PO) purified from livers of untreated ratsEnzymeNo. of exp.Units/g liverUnits/mg liver proteinRecovery in PORelative specific activitySpecific activityPurity/contaminationmg/g liver% total liverUnits/mg PO protein%Protein10265.36 ± 81.840.28 ± 0.08Catalase1053.86 ± 11.34202.96 × 10-39.96 ± 1.9237.67 ± 4.287.6595.31Lipid β-oxidation40.951 ± 0.2553.58 × 10-311.18 ± 3.2536.32 ± 5.090.13091.89β-Glucuronidase410.12 ± 1.5638.14 × 10-30.014 ± 0.010.069 ± 0.0560.0030.139Esterase6326.15 ± 65.461.2290.014 ± 0.010.093 ± 0.070.1141.99Cytochrome c oxidase833.10 ± 9.45124.74 × 10-30.018 ± 0.020.09 ± 0.050.0111.82Lactate dehydrogenase2448.15 ± 6.981.6890.060.2940.497 Open table in a new tab TABLE 3Marker enzymes activities in isolated peroxisomes of bezafibrate-treated and control animalsEnzymeControlBezafibrateUnits/mgUnits/mgCatalase8.58.0ACOX 1 (C18)24.1324.83ACOX 1 (C24)1.130.30β-Oxidation (C18)16.98 (milliunits/mg)45.45 (milliunits/mg)β-Oxidation (C24)0.30 (milliunits/mg)0.22 (milliunits/mg)Unspecific esterase0.1400.073Acidic phosphatase0.0960.223Cytochrome c oxidase0.0170.005 Open table in a new tab To improve the precision of our MS analysis, isolated peroxisomes were subfractionated into so-called matrix, peripheral, and integral membrane fractions prior to MS/MS. Because peroxisomes exhibit a quite unique ratio of membrane to matrix (usually 1:10) and, moreover, are characterized by a portion of “poorly soluble” matrix proteins, which do not easily separate from the membrane (24Alexson S.E. Fujiki Y. Shio H. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 294-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), we had to adapt our subfractionation protocol to obtain a membrane preparation as pure as possible. For this purpose, we first disrupted the organelles by freezing and thawing in the presence of 0.075% Triton X-100, followed by sonication in 0.1% Triton X-100. Using this procedure, the matrix fraction was indeed enriched with the poorly soluble matrix proteins, e.g. the bifunctional enzymes (supplemental Fig. S1a), which was not possible with lower Triton X-100 concentrations. Yet, the Triton treatment also solubilized the integral membrane proteins to a minor extent (supplemental Fig. S1b), which was accepted to avoid contamination of the membrane fraction by matrix proteins. High salt KCl treatment is typically used for extraction of peripheral membrane proteins. However, because a complete clearance of poorl"

We used patch clamp to compare Kir4.1 K+ channel function in freshly isolated Müller cells from retinas of wild-type (+/+) and AQP4 knock-out (-/-) mice. Immunocytochemistry showed a comparable Kir4.1 protein expression pattern in Müller cells from +/+ and -/- retinas, with greatest expression at their end feet.

Resting membrane potential did not differ significantly in +/+ versus -/- Müller cells (-64 ± 1 versus -64 ± 1 mV, S.E., n = 24). Whole-cell K+ currents recorded with a micropipette inserted into the cell soma were Ba2+-sensitive and showed no significant differences in magnitude in +/+ versus -/- Müller cells (1.3 ± 0.1 versus 1.2 ± 0.1 nA at -160 mV) or in inwardly rectifying current-voltage relationships. Spatially resolved K+ currents generated by pulsed K+ injections along Müller cell bodies were also comparable in +/+ versus -/- Müller cells. Single-channel cell-attached patch clamp showed comparable unitary conductance, current-voltage data, and open probability in +/+ versus -/- Müller cells.

Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) 3The abbreviations used are: AQP4, aquaporin-4; ECS, extracellular space; pS, picosiemens.3The abbreviations used are: AQP4, aquaporin-4; ECS, extracellular space; pS, picosiemens. is a water-selective transport protein expressed strongly in plasma membranes of supporting cells that are closely associated with electrically excitable cells, including Müller cells in retina (associated with bipolar cells), astroglial cells in the central nervous system (associated with neurons), and Hensen's/Claudius' cells in cochlea (associated with hair cells) (1Hasegawa H.

Phenotype studies of mice lacking AQP4 support the possibility of functionally significant AQP4-Kir4.1 interactions. AQP4 null mice manifest altered seizure susceptibility and duration (7Binder D.K.

After neuronal stimulation in mouse models of spreading cortical depression and electrical seizure induction associated with increased extracellular space (ECS) K+ (8Binder D.K. Yao X. Sick T.J. Verkman A.S. Manley G.T. Glia. 2006; 53: 631-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 11Padmawar P. Yao X. Bloch O. Manley G.T. Verkman A.S. Nat. Meth. 2005; 2: 825-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), mice lacking AQP4 have remarkably delayed cellular reuptake of K+ from the ECS. Similar alterations in seizure and ECS K+ dynamics have been reported in α-syntrophin knockout mice that manifest cellular mislocalization in glial cell AQP4 (12Amiry-Moghaddam M. Williamson A. Palomba M. Eid T. de Lanerolle N.C. Nagelhus E.A. Adams M.E. Froehner S.C. Agre P. Ottersen O.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13615-13620Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Impaired Kir4.1-dependent cellular K+ uptake in AQP4 deficiency/mislocalization has been proposed to account for these phenotype findings. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that AQP4 expression modulates Kir4.1 K+ channel function in retinal Müller cells. For these studies we used patch clamp to characterize Kir4.1 K+ channel function in freshly isolated Müller cells from retinas of wild-type and AQP4 knock-out mice and immunofluorescence to compare Kir4.1 protein expression. Contrary to expectations, we found, based on multiple criteria, no influence of AQP4 knock-out on Müller cell Kir4.1 expression or function. Müller Cell Isolation—Adult wild-type and AQP4 null mice in a CD1 genetic background were used as described (13Ma T. Yang B. Gillespie A. Carlson E.J. Epstein C.J. Verkman A.S. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 957-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). After mouse sacrifice, enucleation, and removal of the anterior segment, retinas were carefully dissected and incubated at 37 °C for 30-40 min in Ringer solution containing 0.3 mg/ml papain and 2.5 mm l-cysteine (both from Sigma). Retinas were then briefly incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 0.1 mg/ml DNase I (Sigma) and gently triturated using a Pasteur pipette. To enrich for Müller cells, the triturated material was transferred to a 15-ml tube containing a continuous density gradient composed of 0-30% Percoll (GE Healthcare) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and centrifuged at 1500 × g for 5 min. The band located in the middle of the tube, which was enriched in Müller cells, was transferred with a Pasteur pipette to a polylysine-laminin-coated plastic plate in CO2-independent medium and kept for ∼30 min at room temperature to allow cells to adhere. Immunofluorescence—Eye globes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h at 4 °C, processed in increasing concentrations of ethanol and then in a clearing agent (Citrisolv, Fisher), and embedded in paraffin. Five-micrometer-thick sagittal sections from the central eye were used, taking the optic nerve and the pupil as reference points. Sections were deparaffinized in the clearing agent and rehydrated in graded ethanol. After epitope retrieval with citrate buffer (10 mm sodium citrate, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 6.0, 30 min, 95-100 °C), sections were blocked with bovine serum and incubated with rabbit anti-AQP4 or anti-Kir4.1 antibodies (at 1:500 and 1:250, respectively; Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel). Primary antibodies were detected with Texas Red goat-anti-rabbit and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rat secondary antibodies (1:200; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). For immunostaining of isolated cells (as prepared for electrophysiological measurements), adherent cells were fixed for 15 min at room temperature, blocked with bovine serum, and incubated with primary and secondary antibodies as described above. Colocalization studies were done using Zenon Technology (Molecular Probes) according to manufacturer's instructions. Kir4.1 immunofluorescence was quantified using a Leica DM4000B epifluorescence microscope equipped with a 40× objective lens (Leica, Heidelberg, Germany) and cooled CCD camera (Spot, Sterling Heights, MI). Fluorescence intensities were measured using NIH ImageJ software in eight square regions-of-interest, each ∼50 μm2, selected along the longitudinal axis of a total of 18 Müller cells (as shown in Fig. 1B). Area-integrated fluorescence intensities were background-corrected and normalized to the fluorescence in the cell soma. Immunoblot Analysis—Retinas were isolated and homogenized in 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 100 μg/ml serine protease inhibitor (Sigma). Homogenates were centrifuged at 1500 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was loaded onto a 4-12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel (20 μg of protein/lane). Proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and incubated with rabbit anti-AQP4 or anti-Kir4.1 antibody (1:1000 and 1:400, respectively; Alomone Labs) or anti-β-actin antibody (1:2000; GE Healthcare) followed by horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit IgG (1:10,000: GE Healthcare) and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Roche Diagnostics). Protein band densitometry was performed (Scion Image for Macintosh; Scion, Frederick, MD) normalizing to β-actin immunoreactivity. Osmotic Water Permeability—After immobilization of retinal cell suspensions on a plastic dish as described above, cell cytoplasm was labeled with calcein by 30 min of incubation with 10 μm calcein-AM (Molecular Probes) at 37 °C. Müller cells were identified by their characteristic morphology. Osmotic water permeability was measured by calcein fluorescence in response to changing perfusate osmolalities from 300 (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)) to 150 mosm (diluted PBS) as described (14Solenov E. Watanabe H. Manley G.T. Verkman A.S. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2004; 286: 426-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Calcein fluorescence was measured on a Nikon TE-2000 inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with ×40 oil immersion objective lens and cooled CCD camera. Whole-cell Patch Clamp—After cell immobilization as described above, Müller cells were identified by their characteristic morphology. Whole-cell patch clamp recording was done at room temperature (20-22 °C) using an Axon 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Union City, CA). All recordings were done within 4 h after plating. Standard external recording solution contained 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 mm dextrose, pH 7.4, adjusted with NaOH. In some experiments, BaCl2 (final concentration 100 μm) was added to the bath solution. Exchange of perfusion solutions was done using a DAD-8VC superfusion drug application system (ALA Scientific Instruments, Westbury, NY). Microelectrodes were fabricated using a P-97 Micropipette Puller (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA). A small tip with resistance of 6-10 megaohms was used for the relatively small soma of mouse Müller cells. The intracellular (pipette) solution contained 10 mm NaCl, 130 mm KCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, and 3 mm Na2ATP, pH 7.2, adjusted with NaOH. Data were acquired using a Digidata 1440A digitizer (Molecular Devices) with Clampex 10.0 software (Molecular Devices). Data were sampled at 5 kHz and low-passed at 5 kHz. Series resistance and capacitance compensation were not used during recording. Data were analyzed by Clampfit 10.0 (Molecular Devices) and Sigmaplot (SPSS, Chicago, IL). For K+ injection experiments, Müller cells with two long arms were identified and voltage-clamped by micropipette puncture of the soma as described above. A second pipette with a tip diameter of 3 μm was backfilled with high K+ solution containing 90 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dextrose, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Injection was controlled by a Nanoliter 2000 injector (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) mounted on a high-resolution micromanipulator (New Focus, San Jose, CA). The tip was positioned at specified regions of the cell, as visualized by phase-contrast microscopy at 400× magnification. Cell-micropipette images were recorded at the site of each current recording. Data were recorded as described above after 100-ms injections of 2.3 nl of high K+ solution at a cell holding potential of -80 mV. All electrophysiological studies were done with the experimenter blinded to information about mouse genotype. Single Channel Recordings—Cell-attached single-channel patch recordings were done at room temperature. Pipettes were pulled from borosilicate tubing (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA). The tips of the pipettes were coated with sticky wax (Pourette Candlemaking Supplies, Seattle, WA) and fire-polished with a MF-830 Microforge (Narishige, Japan). Pipettes were filled with a solution containing 145 mm KCl, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, adjusted with KOH. The bath solution contained 145 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, adjusted with KOH. Data were sampled at 5 kHz and low-passed at 1 kHz using an Axon 200B amplifier. Data were analyzed using Clampfit 10.0 software. Kir4.1 and AQP4 Expression in Müller Cells—Kir4.1 and AQP4 expression were studied by immunofluorescence in isolated cells and retinal sections. Fig. 1A shows representative fluorescence micrographs of two Müller cells from wild-type (+/+) and AQP4 null (-/-) mice. Kir4.1 and AQP4 showed similar distributions in wild-type Müller cells, with protein expression throughout the membrane and a higher concentration in the end feet and to a lesser extent in the soma and the apical region. As expected, no specific staining for AQP4 was detected in Müller cells from AQP4 null mice. The distribution of Kir4.1 was not affected by AQP4 deletion, as seen qualitatively in Fig. 1A and by quantitative image analysis in Fig. 1B, where background-subtracted, area-integrated fluorescence intensity was determined along the axis of many isolated Müller cells and normalized to fluorescence in the soma. Reduced osmotic water permeability in the AQP4 null Müller cells was verified using a calcein fluorescence quenching method in which immobilized cells were labeled with calcein (Fig. 1C, top) and subjected to an osmotic gradient (Fig. 1C, center). Osmotic equilibration was very fast in wild-type Müller cells, with the measurement limited by solution mixing. Relative water permeability, which is proportional to the reciprocal half-time for cell osmotic equilibration, was more than 4-fold reduced in the AQP4 null Müller cells (Fig. 1C, bottom). In retinal sections from wild-type mice, Kir4.1 and AQP4 showed a polarized distribution, with greatest expression in inner retina containing the end foot processes (Fig. 2A). Immunofluorescence labeling was also seen in perivascular processes (arrows), and strong expression of AQP4 was also detected in the outer plexiform layer. The distribution of Kir4.1 was similar in wild-type and AQP4 null retinas. Immunoblot analysis with AQP4 antibody of homogenates of retinas from wild-type mice showed a band at ∼32 kDa (Fig. 2B, top) that was absent in retinas from AQP4 null mice. Kir4.1 expression was seen as an ∼85-kDa band corresponding to the dimeric form of the channel that was similar in retinas from wild-type and AQP4 null mice as seen qualitatively and by quantitative analysis after normalization to β-actin expression (Fig. 2B, bottom). Electrophysiological Properties of Müller Cell K+ Channels—Whole-cell currents were characterized in Müller cells isolated from retinas of wild-type mice. The isolated cells had the typical morphological characteristics of Müller cells as seen in Fig. 1A. The resting membrane potential was -64.2 ± 1.1 mV (S.E., n = 24). Under whole-cell voltage-clamp conditions (-80 mV holding potential), a series of voltage steps from -160 to +40 mV with 10-mV increments produced inward and outward currents as shown in Fig. 3A. The currents were strongly inhibited by 100 μm Ba2+ added to the bathing solution. After subtraction, the Ba2+-insensitive currents showed weak inward rectification (Fig. 3B) with a reversal potential of -81.6 ± 0.3 mV (n = 21), in good agreement with the calculated K+ reversal potential of 82.8 mV. As shown in Fig. 3B, increasing the extracellular K+ concentration to 20 mm (by replacing NaCl) shifted the reversal potential to -48.6 ± 1.7 mV (n = 8), in agreement with the calculated reversal potential of -47.6 mV. We conclude that the Ba2+-sensitive current component in Müller cells from wild-type mice is carried mainly by K+ ions. All of these characteristics are consistent with those reported for Kir4.1 channel-mediated currents (15Ishii M. Horio Y. Tada Y. Hibino H. Inanobe A. Ito M. Yamada M. Gotow T. Uchiyama Y. Kurachi Y. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7725-7735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kofuji P. Ceelen P. Zahs K.R. Surbeck L.W. Lester H.A. Newman E.A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5733-5740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Kir4.1 Currents in Wild-type and AQP4-deficient Müller Cells—To determine whether AQP4 expression alters Kir4.1 function, K+ currents were measured in Müller cells isolated from retinas of wild-type and AQP4 null mice. Representative current recordings are shown in Fig. 4A. All currents were sensitive to 100 μm Ba2+ (data not shown). Fig. 4B summarizes averaged data from many cells, showing no significant difference in current magnitude or current-voltage relationships in wild-type versus AQP4 null Müller cells. We also used a voltage-ramp protocol to characterize Kir4.1 K+ currents. Fig. 4C summarizes data from many cells, showing weak inward rectification with no significant differences in wild-type versus AQP4 null Müller cells. Fig. 4D shows a single component distribution of resting membrane potentials, with no significant difference in mean resting potential in wild-type versus AQP4 null Müller cells. Prior studies of Müller cells in different mammalian species have suggested a non-uniform spatial distribution of K+ conductance along their long axis, with the highest conductance at their end feet and in the central region (17Connors N.C. Kofuji P. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4321-4327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Newman E.A. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1987; 65: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Cell regional conductance is dependent on the product of specific K+ membrane conductance and regional cell surface area. To determine the cellular distribution of Kir4.1, cells were voltage-clamped to -80 mV, and induced currents were recorded after focal injection of a high K+ solution. Currents were recorded from eight distinct regions of Müller cells, from the end feet to the apical end. Fig. 5A shows representative currents evoked from different regions in wild-type and AQP4 null Müller cells. There were relatively large currents at the end feet, soma, and apical end, with lower current in the proximal process (Fig. 5A). A qualitatively similar pattern was seen in AQP4 null Müller cells. Fig. 5B summarizes the data, with current maxima normalized to currents in the soma of the same cells. There was no significant difference in K+ currents in wild-type versus AQP4 null Müller cells, which is consistent with the similar spatial distribution of Kir4.1 protein as shown in Fig. 1B. The single-channel properties of Kir4.1 in Müller cells were examined by the cell-attached patch clamp technique with pipette and bath solutions containing 145 mm K+. A single population of Kir channel currents was seen in ∼30 successful cell-attached patch recordings for each type, with ∼40% of recordings showing single channels. Representative single-channel recordings at different holding potentials are shown in Fig. 6A. The recordings were qualitatively similar. Single-channel current-voltage analysis showed no significant differences in wild-type versus AQP4-deficient Müller cells (Fig. 6B). The unitary conductances of Kir4.1 (in the inward direction) were 21 ± 4 pS (n = 8, wild-type) and 20 ± 4 pS (n = 8, AQP4-deficient). The channel opened in bursts with relatively high open probabilities at negative holding potentials as summarized in Fig. 6C. The open probabilities were 0.8-1.0 at -40 to -100 mV, with no significant difference in wild-type versus AQP4-deficient Müller cells. We found no influence of AQP4 deletion on Müller cell Kir4.1 function or distribution as measured by whole-cell current and single channel patch clamp recordings in freshly isolated Müller cells as well as by immunofluorescence in isolated cells and retinal sections. These results contradict the widely accepted notion that glial/Müller cell AQP4 modulates Kir4.1 function. Indirect evidence that had supported a functional AQP4-Kir4.1 interaction includes membrane co-localization of AQP4 and Kir4.1, studies of changes in the extracellular space volume in acute cortical slices, where K+ spatial buffering paralleled changes in extracellular space volume, and delayed K+ clearance in α-syntrophin null mice (16Kofuji P. Ceelen P. Zahs K.R. Surbeck L.W. Lester H.A. Newman E.A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5733-5740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Neely J.D. Amiry-Moghaddam M. Ottersen O.P. Froehner S.C. Agre P. Adams M.E.

Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3045-3051Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). From these findings it was proposed that AQP4 and Kir4.1 work in concert so that AQP4 itself or water flux through AQP4 contributes to Kir4.1-dependent volume changes in the extracellular space (12Amiry-Moghaddam M. Williamson A. Palomba M. Eid T. de Lanerolle N.C. Nagelhus E.A. Adams M.E. Froehner S.C. Agre P. Ottersen O.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

More recently, using immunoprecipitation, evidence for a direct physical interaction between AQP4 and Kir4.1 through the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex was reported in retinal Müller cells (6Connors N.C. Kofuji P. Glia. 2006; 53: 124-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). K+ channels in retinal Müller cells are believed to play a crucial role in extracellular K+ homeostasis. Of the various K+ channels, inwardly rectifying K+ (Kir) channels are considered most important for spatial buffering of K+ (17Connors N.C. Kofuji P. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4321-4327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In retinal Müller cells in mammals, the weakly rectifying Kir4.1 channel is the predominant Kir-type K+ channel (15Ishii M. Horio Y. Tada Y. Hibino H. Inanobe A. Ito M. Yamada M. Gotow T. Uchiyama Y. Kurachi Y. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7725-7735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Connors N.C. Kofuji P. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4321-4327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using similar methods as reported before (15Ishii M. Horio Y. Tada Y. Hibino H. Inanobe A. Ito M. Yamada M. Gotow T. Uchiyama Y. Kurachi Y. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7725-7735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we recorded Kir4.1 currents from adult mouse Müller cells. The membrane conductance of Müller cells is dominated by K+ currents with mild inward rectification as seen in whole-cell currents recorded in physiological solutions. The resting reversal potential was close to the calculated K+ equilibrium potential as reported previously to be typical for retinal Müller cells in rat, mouse, and rabbit (15Ishii M. Horio Y. Tada Y. Hibino H. Inanobe A. Ito M. Yamada M. Gotow T. Uchiyama Y. Kurachi Y. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7725-7735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Connors N.C. Kofuji P. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4321-4327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as Kir4.1 currents in heterologously expressing oocytes and HEK293 cells (15Ishii M. Horio Y. Tada Y. Hibino H. Inanobe A. Ito M. Yamada M. Gotow T. Uchiyama Y. Kurachi Y. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7725-7735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Takumi T. Ishii T. Horio Y. Morishige K. Takahashi N. Yamada M. Yamashita T. Kiyama H.

In our experiment the majority of whole-cell current was sensitive to a low extracellular concentration of Ba2+, as expected from prior data (18Newman E.A. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1987; 65: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 23Solessio E. Linn D.M. Perlman I. Lasater E.M. J.

Pfluegers Arch. 1994; 426: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), other voltage-dependent K+ (Kv) currents play at most a minor role in Müller cell K+ conductance. The single-channel properties of Kir4.1 have been studied from different mammals and in transfected cell lines (15Ishii M. Horio Y. Tada Y. Hibino H. Inanobe A. Ito M. Yamada M. Gotow T. Uchiyama Y.

All studies indicated a similar inward rectification with a unitary conductance of 20-30 pS, in agreement with our data in Fig. 6. We found no significant difference in the Kir4.1 single channel properties in wild-type versus AQP4-deficient Müller cells in unitary conductance, voltage-dependent open probability, and current-voltage relationships. These results support the conclusion that AQP4 expression does not affect Kir4.1 K+ channel function. In contrast to most measurements in mammalian cells, two distinct conductances of 21 and 36 pS were reported in Xenopus oocytes expressing Kir4.1. In isolated mouse Müller cells we recorded only a single population of Kir4.1 channels, which likely corresponds to the low conductance channel seen in Xenopus oocytes (22Takumi T. Ishii T. Horio Y. Morishige K. Takahashi N. Yamada M. Yamashita T. Kiyama H. Sohmiya K. Nakanishi S. Kurachi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16339-16346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and on HEK293T cells (15Ishii M. Horio Y. Tada Y. Hibino H. Inanobe A. Ito M. Yamada M. Gotow T. Uchiyama Y. Kurachi Y. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7725-7735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There are a number of possible explanations to reconcile our data showing no effect of AQP4 expression on Kir4.1 function with the prior immunolocalization and immunoprecipitation studies suggesting a possible AQP4-Kir4.1 interaction. AQP4 and Kir4.1 may indeed interact physically, although physical association does not necessarily imply that they form a functional unit. Alternatively, there may be little AQP4-Kir4.1 interaction. Immunogold evidence indicates co-enrichment of AQP4 and Kir4.1 on Müller cell vitreal and perivascular end feet membranes, although only small regions show good colocalization (4Nagelhus E.A. Horio Y. Inanobe A. Fujita A. Haug F.M. Nielsen S. Kurachi Y. Ottersen O.P. Glia. 1999; 26: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Another concern in postulating AQP4-Kir4.1 interactions is the quite different membrane densities of these proteins, with AQPs generally expressed at a density of >104/μm2 of membrane compared with less than 1 K+ channel/μm2. The reported immunoprecipitation studies supporting AQP4-Kir4.1 interaction are non-quantitative and required non-physiological detergent solubilization conditions and covalent cross-linking that do not mimic native protein interactions (6Connors N.C. Kofuji P. Glia. 2006; 53: 124-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A final possibility to reconcile our results with prior data is that a different K+ channel becomes up-regulated in AQP4 deficiency to restore native K+ conductance. However, this possibility is unlikely given the essentially identical electrophysiological properties and Kir4.1 expression pattern in wild-type versus AQP4-deficient Müller cells. As described in the Introduction, several types of studies in living mice indicate slowed K+ uptake from the ECS in brain in AQP4 deficiency or dysfunction as well as altered seizure dynamics. The absence of functionally significant Kir4.1-AQP4 interactions as found here, thus, requires identification of alternative mechanism(s) to account for the phenotype observations in mice. One possibility proposed by our laboratory is ECS expansion in AQP4 deficiency, which is supported by a variety of biophysical measurements of macromolecule diffusion in the ECS (30Binder D.K. Papadopoulos M.C. Haggie P.M. Verkman A.S. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 8049-8056Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of ECS expansion in AQP4 deficiency remains unknown, nor is it known whether the ECS expansion in AQP4 deficiency is sufficient to account quantitatively for the delayed K+ reuptake. An alternative explanation is that compensatory changes in other channels expressed in Müller cell membranes in AQP4 null mice contribute to water influx, such as the Na+/HCO-3 cotransporter (31Newman E.A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 159-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Increases in ECS K+ cause Müller cell depolarization, which favors the cellular uptake of Na+ and bicarbonate, producing an osmotic gradient driving water influx. We cannot at this time exclude the possibility of such compensatory changes in AQP4 deficiency. Small-molecule AQP4 inhibitors, when available, are needed to explore this possibility. Yet another possible explanation is that reduced water permeability by itself in AQP4 null mice might account for the impaired K+ reuptake and seizure phenotype differences in AQP4 deficiency. Perhaps local osmotic effects or highly polarized water flow might influence K+ transport by electro-osmotic or pseudosolvent drag phenomena. However, these possibilities remain speculative and will be quite challenging to verify experimentally. In conclusion, we found that Kir4.1 K+ channel function and expression in retinal Müller cells is independent of AQP4 water channel expression. Our data contradict a widely accepted view of a functionally significant macromolecular complex that includes AQP4 and Kir4.1 and, thus, indicate the need to identify alternative mechanisms to account for altered K+ and seizure dynamics in AQP4 deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2057455189,"Fatty acid transport protein 4 (FATP4) is a fatty acyl-CoA synthetase that preferentially activates very long chain fatty acid substrates, such as C24:0, to their CoA derivatives. To gain better insight into the physiological functions of FATP4, we established dermal fibroblast cell lines from FATP4-deficient wrinkle-free mice and wild type (w.t.) mice. FATP4 -/- fibroblasts had no detectable FATP4 protein by Western blot. Compared with w.t. fibroblasts, cells lacking FATP4 had an 83% decrease in C24:0 activation. Peroxisomal degradation of C24:0 was reduced by 58%, and rates of C24:0 incorporation into major phospholipid species (54–64% decrease), triacylglycerol (64% decrease), and cholesterol esters (58% decrease) were significantly diminished. Because these lipid metabolic processes take place in different subcellular organelles, we used immunofluorescence and Western blotting of subcellular fractions to investigate the distribution of FATP4 protein and measured enzyme activity in fractions from w.t. and FATP4 -/- fibroblasts. FATP4 protein and acyl-CoA synthetase activity localized to multiple organelles, including mitochondria, peroxisomes, endoplasmic reticulum, and the mitochondria-associated membrane fraction. We conclude that in murine skin fibroblasts, FATP4 is the major enzyme producing very long chain fatty acid-CoA for lipid metabolic pathways. Although FATP4 deficiency primarily affected very long chain fatty acid metabolism, mutant fibroblasts also showed reduced uptake of a fluorescent long chain fatty acid and reduced levels of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. FATP4-deficient cells also contained abnormal neutral lipid droplets. These additional defects indicate that metabolic abnormalities in these cells are not limited to very long chain fatty acids.

Fatty acids containing 22 or more carbon atoms are referred to as very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA). 2The abbreviations used are: VLCFA, very long chain fatty acid; ACS, acyl-CoA synthetase; FATP, fatty acid transport protein; LCFA, long chain fatty acid; MAM, mitochondria-associated membrane; w.t., wild type. VLCFA are normal constituents of membrane lipids but are particularly abundant in brain, testis, and skin (1Stewart M.E. Downing D.T. Adv.

Lipid Res. 1994; 33: 387-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Fatty acids, including VLCFA, cannot participate in most metabolic processes unless they are first activated to their CoA derivatives (4Watkins P.A. Prog. Lipid Res. 1997; 36: 55-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Once activated, however, fatty acids can be degraded to release stored energy or incorporated into glycerolipids, phospholipids, sphingolipids, glycolipids, cholesterol esters, and other complex lipids. Certain acyl-CoAs also serve as substrates for protein acylation and/or function as regulatory molecules. Thus, the fatty acid activation reaction is central to normal cellular lipid metabolism. The acyl-CoA synthetase (ACS) enzyme family catalyzes this essential reaction (4Watkins P.A. Prog. Lipid Res. 1997; 36: 55-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Because fatty acid chain lengths vary from 2 to more than 30 carbon atoms, different ACSs capable of activating short, medium, long, and very long chain fatty acids have evolved. Based on analysis of amino acid sequence homology, we estimate that mammalian genomes encode at least 25 different ACSs. 3P. A. Watkins, D. Maiguel, and Z. Jia, submitted for publication.

In addition to their enzymatic function in fatty acid activation, members of the very long chain ACS family have been described as fatty acid transport proteins (FATP) (12Schaffer J.E. Lodish H.F.

These proteins, which are encoded by the Slc27a gene family, have been associated with increased cellular uptake of 16–18-carbon fatty acids when overexpressed. One enzyme of this family, FATP4 (Slc27a4), 4Because the initial protein in the very long chain ACS family was first identified as an FATP, the six members of this enzyme family have been placed in the solute carrier 27 family and designated SLC27A1–6.

It was therefore suggested that FATP4 might control intestinal fatty acid uptake and that this protein would be an attractive target for anti-obesity therapy. To pursue this further, two laboratories produced mice with targeted disruption of FATP4 (17Herrmann T. Van Der Hoeven F. Grone H.J. Stewart A.F. Langbein L. Kaiser I. Liebisch G. Gosch I.

To gain further insight into the metabolic function of FATP4, we established dermal fibroblast cell lines from w.t. and FATP4-deficient wrfr -/- (Slc27a4wrfr) mice. In this report, we demonstrate that a lack of FATP4 causes significant alterations in cellular lipid metabolism. We observed reduced fatty acid uptake in mutant cells and decreased flux of VLCFA through both catabolic and anabolic pathways. We conclude that FATP4 is the principal VLCFA-activating enzyme in skin fibroblasts.

Establishment of Fibroblast Cell Lines—Skin samples were obtained under sterile conditions from the dorsum of newborn w.t. and Slc27a4wrfr littermates on the day of birth. Skin was washed with sterile phosphate-buffered saline and stored at 4 °C in complete cell culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics) until processed. The samples were cut into small (∼1 mm2) pieces, which were attached to the bottom of cell culture dishes by scoring with a scalpel blade. Complete medium was added, and the dishes were incubated in a 5% CO2 atmosphere in a humidified 37 °C incubator. After a few days, monolayer cell growth near the attached skin pieces was observed, and the culture medium was changed. Once colonies reached a size of ≥5 mm in diameter, they were harvested by gentle trypsinization and replated in new dishes. Several cell lines were established from two different w.t. and two different Slc27a4wrfr mice. The cells were subcultured weekly (1:3). For experiments, the cells were used at passage ≤15. For cell fractionation and lipid metabolism studies, the cells were harvested by gentle trypsinization, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 0.25 m sucrose containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 1 mm EDTA. Assay of fatty acid β-oxidation rates (see below) of passage 3 cells versus passage 15 cells gave identical results (data not shown). Subcellular Fractionation—Cell suspensions were homogenized using a precision ball bearing homogenizer that efficiently disrupts the plasma membrane without significant organelle damage (24Balch W.E.

FATP4 Antibody Production—To produce an antigen for immunization of rabbits, a fusion construct encoding the C-terminal 35 amino acids of FATP4 in frame with glutathione S-transferase was prepared. A 108-bp fragment was amplified by PCR using FATP4 full-length cDNA 5Jia, Z., Pei, Z., Maiguel, D., Toomer, C. J., and Watkins, P. A. (2007) J. Mol. Neurosci., in press. as template with forward primer 5′-ATGCCGAATTCCGCTATTGTGAAAGACCCG-3′, which incorporates an EcoRI site (underlined), and reverse primer 5′-TATTCTCGAGTCACAGCTTCTCCTCGCCTGC-3′, which incorporates an XhoI site (underlined) just after the TGA stop codon (reverse complement shown in bold). This fragment was cloned in frame into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of the pGEX-His-T3 vector (Amersham Biosciences). After transfer to Escherichia coli strain BL21-DE3, induction of fusion protein expression and subsequent purification was as described previously (9Pei Z. Fraisl P. Berger J. Jia Z. Forss-Petter S.

Immunization and bleeding of rabbits was done by Cocalico Biologicals (Reamstown PA). The antibody was affinity-purified using previously described methods (9Pei Z. Fraisl P. Berger J. Jia Z.

Briefly, dilute antiserum was first passed over a glutathione-Sepharose column to remove anti-glutathione S-transferase antibodies. Anti-FATP4 antibodies were then bound to and eluted from a Sepharose column containing covalently linked fusion protein. Indirect Immunofluorescence and Western Blotting—For immunofluorescence studies, the cells were cultured on glass coverslips and grown to ∼50% confluence. The cells were fixed with 3% formaldehyde, permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100, and incubated with primary antibodies and fluorescent-conjugated secondary antibodies as previously described (25Watkins P.A.

For labeling of plasma membranes, the cells were fixed, but not permeabilized, and incubated for 1 h with Alexa fluor 594-conjugated cholera toxin B-subunit (4 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline). After extensive washing, the cells were permeabilized with Triton X-100 (25Watkins P.A. Gould S.J. Smith M.A. Braiterman L.T. Wei H-M. Kok F. Moser A.B. Moser H.W. Smith K.D. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 57: 292-301PubMed Google Scholar) prior to incubation with anti-FATP4 antibody. For Western blots, the protein concentrations of samples to be compared were first normalized, and equal amounts were loaded in each lane. Electrophoresis was carried out according to the method of Laemmli (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). After transfer to nitrocellulose membrane and incubation with primary and secondary antibodies, proteins were detected using the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate System (Pierce). Acyl-CoA Synthetase and β-Oxidation Assays—Activation of [1-14C]palmitic acid and [1-14C]lignoceric acid to their CoA derivatives was assayed as previously described (27Watkins P.A. Ferrell Jr., E.V. Pedersen J.I. Hoefler G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 289: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Briefly, labeled fatty acid (20 μm final concentration; ∼20,000 dpm/nmol) solubilized with α-cyclodextrin (10 mg/ml in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0) was incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in a total volume of 0.25 ml with 40 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm CoA, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, and cell suspension or subcellular fraction as indicated in the figure legends. The reactions were terminated by the addition of Dole's solution (28Dole V.P. J. Clin. Investig. 1956; 35: 150-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar), unreacted substrate was removed by heptane extraction, and radioactivity in the aqueous phase was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. Activation of the fluorescent fatty acid C1-BODIPY 500/510 C12 by frozen/thawed suspensions of COS-1 cells following transfection for 2 days with FATP4 cDNA or empty vector was assayed similarly, except that fluorescence intensity of the aqueous phase was measured using a Turner model 450 fluorometer. Oxidation of [1-14C] fatty acids to water-soluble products was also measured as previously described (27Watkins P.A. Ferrell Jr., E.V. Pedersen J.I. Hoefler G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 289: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Briefly, fatty acids were solubilized with α-cyclodextrin as described for ACS assays and incubated in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, for 1 h at 37 °C with freshly harvested cell suspensions and required cofactors (8.5 mm ATP, 8.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm NAD, 0.17 mm FAD, 2.5 mm carnitine, 0.16 mm CoA, 1 mm malate). The reaction was carried out under hypotonic conditions in which substrates and cofactors can readily permeate the plasma membrane. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 50 μl of 1 n KOH. After saponification by incubation for 1 h at 60°C, the mixtures were acidified and extracted by the method of Folch et al. (29Folch J. Lees M. Sloane-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 457-509Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar); radioactivity in the aqueous phase was determined by scintillation counting. In some experiments, the reaction tubes were fitted with serum caps and center wells for collection of 14CO2 prior to saponification and extraction. Center wells contained glass fiber filter paper wetted with 3 n KOH. The reactions were terminated by injection of 0.125 ml of 3 n H2SO4 into the bottom of reaction tubes, and further incubation was carried out overnight at room temperature. 14CO2 trapped on the filter paper was quantified by scintillation counting. The reaction mixtures were then alkalinized with KOH and subjected to saponification, acidification, and extraction as described above. For C16:0, an average of 18% of total oxidation products was recovered as CO2, and for C24:0, the value was 8%. For FATP4-deficient cells, the decreases in radioactivity recovered as CO2 and water-soluble products were similar. For all β-oxidation experiments, <10% of the fatty acid substrate was consumed during the 1-h assay. Incorporation of Fatty Acids into Neutral Lipids, Polar Lipids, and Ceramide—Labeled fatty acids and unlabeled cholesterol were solubilized with cyclodextrins (5 mg/ml α-cyclodextrin + 5 mg/ml β-cyclodextrin in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0). To measure incorporation into neutral and polar lipids, fibroblast cell suspensions were incubated with 20 μm [1-14C]palmitic acid (50 μg of cell protein) or 20 μm [1-14C]lignoceric acid (100 μg of cell protein) in 40 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm CoA, 1 μm cholesterol, and 1 mm α-glycerophosphate in a total volume of 250 μl, for 2 h at 37°C. The reactions were terminated by the addition of chloroform/methanol (2:1) containing 5 mm HCl, and extraction was carried out according to the method of Folch et al. (29Folch J. Lees M. Sloane-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 457-509Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The organic phase was dried under a stream of nitrogen and solubilized with 50 μl of chloroform. Duplicate 20-μl aliquots were applied to Whatman Lk6D silica gel high performance thin layer plates. For measurement of ceramide synthesis, the same reaction conditions were used with the following exceptions: 1.2 mm serine and 0.12 mm NADPH replaced α-glycerophosphate and cholesterol, and all assays contained 100 μg of protein. After chloroform/methanol extracts were dried as above, they were subjected to mild saponification by incubating for 1 h at 37 °C in 2 ml of 0.1 m KOH in chloroform/methanol (2:1). 0.5 ml of 0.7 n HCl was then added to acidify the mixture and to cause a phase separation. The upper aqueous phase was discarded, and the lower phase was washed twice with theoretical upper phase (29Folch J. Lees M. Sloane-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 457-509Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), before drying under nitrogen. Following solubilization with 50 μl of hexane/diethyl ether (1:1), duplicate 20-μl aliquots were applied to Whatman Lk6D plates. All thin layer chromatography plates were prewashed with chloroform/methanol (1:1), and for phospholipid analysis only, the plates were subsequently wetted with 2.3% boric acid in ethanol and drained for 5 min. All of the plates were dried for 15 min at 100 °C. Solvent systems used were hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid (80:20:1) for neutral lipids, chloroform/ethanol/water/triethylamine (30:35:7:35) for phospholipids, and hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid (90:10:1) for ceramide. Labeled lipids were detected by phosphorimaging analysis (Fuji-BAS 2500) and identified by comparison with authentic standards. For quantitation of phosphorimaging data, known amounts of [1-14C]palmitic acid (200–2500 dpm) were spotted on a blank area of TLC plates following development to generate a standard curve (r2 > 0.98). Graphpad Prism software was used to convert phosphorimaging densities to dpm using the standard curve. In these studies, <20% of the available substrate was consumed during the 2-h incubation. Neutral lipid standards were detected by exposure to iodine vapor, and phospholipid standards were detected under ultraviolet light after spraying the plates with primuline (0.005% (w/v) in acetone/water (4:1)). To verify that radioactivity in neutral and polar lipids in cell suspensions labeled with [1-14C]lignoceric acid remained as intact C24:0 and was not shorter chain fatty acids resulting from recycling of [14C]acetyl-CoA generated from β-oxidation of lignoceric acid, Folch extracts were subjected to acid methanolysis (30Moser H.W. Moser A.B. Hommes F.A. Techniques in Diagnostic Human Biochemical Genetics. Wiley-Liss, New York1991: 177-191Google Scholar). Methyl esters were applied to high performance reverse phase TLC plates (Analtech) and developed in the solvent system chloroform/methanol/water (7:15:1) (31Morita Y.S. Paul K.S. Englund P.T. Science. 2000; 288: 140-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). For standards, authentic [1-14C]fatty acids containing 16–24 carbons were converted to their respective methyl esters using the same protocol. Other than methyllignocerate, methylpalmitate was the only radioactive species detected. Quantitation of the methylpalmitate produced indicated that it accounted for <2% of the radioactivity associated with neutral and polar lipids. Thus, we conclude that at least 98% of radioactivity incorporated into complex lipids remained in the form of C24:0. Cellular Uptake of Fluorescent Fatty Acid and Staining of Neutral Lipid Droplets—For fatty acid uptake measurements, the fluorescent fatty acid C1-BODIPY 500/510 C12 (4,4-difluoro-5-methyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-dodecanoic acid) (Molecular Probes number D3823) was used as described previously (11Milger K.

The cells were grown as monolayers on glass coverslips. After washing with warm phosphate-buffered saline, C1-BODIPY 500/510 C12 in dimethyl sulfoxide was added to a final concentration of 20 μm, and the cells were incubated 2 min at 37 °C. After washing, the coverslips were mounted and viewed using a 20× objective. Vesicles containing neutral lipids were stained with the fluorescent dye BODIPY 493/503 (Molecular Probes number D3922) as described (32Gocze P.M. Freeman D.A. Cytometry. 1994; 17: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 33DiDonato D. Brasaemle D.L. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2003; 51: 773-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This BODIPY fluorophor is a lipophilic dye that has an affinity for neutral lipids and is not a fatty acid analog. Briefly, cell monolayers on glass coverslips were fixed and washed as for indirect immunofluorescence. BODIPY 493/503 in dimethyl sulfoxide was added to a final concentration of 20 μm, and the cells were incubated 10 min at 37 °C. After washing, the coverslips were mounted an"

Central to this process is the SoxYZ complex that carries the pathway intermediates on a cysteine residue near the C terminus of SoxY. Crystal structures have been determined for Paracoccus pantotrophus SoxYZ with the carrier cysteine in the underivatized state, conjugated to the polysulfide mimic β-mercaptoethanol, and as the sulfonate adduct pathway intermediate. The carrier cysteine is located on a peptide swinging arm and is bracketed on either side by diglycine dipeptides acting as molecular universal joints. This structure provides a novel solution to the requirement that the cysteine-bound intermediates be able to access and orient themselves within the active sites of multiple partner enzymes. Adjacent to the swinging arm there is a conserved, deep, apolar pocket into which the β-mercaptoethanol adduct extends. This pocket would be well suited to a role in protecting labile pathway intermediates from adventitious reactions.

Oxidation of inorganic sulfur species to sulfate by bacteria is a vital part of the global sulfur cycle (1Friedrich C.G. Bardischewsky F. Rother D. Quentmeier A. Fischer J. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2005; 8: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) and has applied importance in agriculture, waste treatment, biocorrosion, and biomining (2Lengeler J.W. Drews G. Schlegel H.G.

The bacteria use the electrons that they derive from the sulfur species as the reductant in carbon dioxide fixation or as the electron donor for respiratory energy metabolism.The Sox 4The abbreviations used are: DTT, dithiothreitol; MAD, multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion; GGCGG, the Gly-Gly-Cys-Gly-Gly C-terminal pentapeptide of the SoxY protein; Bicine, N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine. 4The abbreviations used are: DTT, dithiothreitol; MAD, multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion; GGCGG, the Gly-Gly-Cys-Gly-Gly C-terminal pentapeptide of the SoxY protein; Bicine, N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine. (sulfur oxidizing) system appears to be the most widely distributed sulfur oxidation pathway and is found in both photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic sulfur-oxidizing Eubacteria. The Sox pathway has been most extensively studied in the α-Proteobacterium Paracoccus pantotrophus. The current model for the oxidation of thiosulfate (–S-SO–3) to sulfate by the Sox pathway in this organism is shown in Fig. 1A. It involves the four periplasmic protein complexes SoxYZ, SoxAX, SoxB, and SoxCD (1Friedrich C.G. Bardischewsky F. Rother D. Quentmeier A. Fischer J. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2005; 8: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 4Rother D. Henrich H-J. Quentmeier A. Bardischewsky F. Friedrich C. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4499-4508Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 5Friedrich C.G. Rother D. Bardischewsky F. Quentmeier A. Fischer J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 2873-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Intermediates in the pathway are covalently bound to a cysteine residue located within a characteristic GGCGG pentapeptide at the C terminus of the SoxY subunit of the SoxYZ complex (6Quentmeier A. Friedrich C.G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 503: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). All but the extreme C-terminal glycine residue are conserved in SoxY orthologs and are presumably essential (Fig. 1, B and C). The first step in the pathway is oxidative linkage of thiosulfate to SoxYZ to form a cysteine S-thiosulfonate (thiocysteine sulfate) derivative. This reaction is catalyzed by the triheme-containing SoxAX complex. Crystal structures of SoxAX reveal unprecedented cysteine persulfide coordination to the heme group at the active site of the enzyme (7Bamford V.A. Bruno S. Rasmussen T. Appia-Ayme C. Cheesman M.R. Berks B.C. Hemmings A.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5599-5610Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 8Dambe T. Quentmeier A. Rother D. Friedrich C. Scheidig A.J. J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 152: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In subsequent steps the S-thiosulfonate species is degraded by a combination of the hydrolase SoxB, which removes terminal sulfone (–SO–3) groups as sulfate, and the molybdopterin-containing SoxCD complex, which oxidizes terminal sulfane (–S–) groups to the corresponding sulfone. The eight electrons extracted in the two oxidative steps of the Sox pathway are transferred to a small c-type cytochrome for delivery to the electron transfer chain.As well as its role in thiosulfate metabolism the Sox pathway has been reported to be involved in the oxidation of other reduced sulfur species including sulfide (HS–), elemental sulfur (S8), sulfite (HSO–3), and tetrathionate (–O3S-S-S-SO–3) (9Appia-Ayme C. Little P.J. Matsumoto Y. Leech A.P. Berks B.C. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6107-6118Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 10Mukhopadhyaya P.N. Deb C. Lahiri C. Roy P. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4278-4287Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 11Wodara C. Bardischewsky F. Friedrich C.G. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5014-5023Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The modular nature of the Sox system would allow such species to be fed into the pathway as an appropriate intermediate (illustrative examples are shown in Fig. 1D). In some cases this would result in formation of adducts containing long chains of sulfur atoms before the terminal sulfane or sulfone groups. An additional important consequence of the modular arrangement of the Sox system is that the reactions are not necessarily ordered. It is, therefore, conceivable that instead of a sulfane intermediate being oxidized by SoxCD it could be oxidatively conjugated to a thiosulfate molecule by SoxAX (Fig. 1E). This would be a further mechanism by which longer chain sulfur species might accumulate on SoxY. Such species have been experimentally observed (6Quentmeier A. Friedrich C.G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 503: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Whatever the origins of long chain sulfur intermediates, they can be broken down by repeated iterations of the SoxCD and SoxB reactions.Many bacteria with a Sox system lack the SoxCD component found in the prototypical Sox pathway of α-Proteobacteria (1Friedrich C.G. Bardischewsky F. Rother D. Quentmeier A. Fischer J. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2005; 8: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 12Beller H.R. Chain P.S. Letain T.E. Chakicherla A.

Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 62: 794-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In these organisms it is thought that the Sox system feeds sulfane groups derived from thiosulfate into other sulfur oxidation pathways. In some cases this involves incorporation of the sulfane atoms into distinct zero-valent storage forms of sulfur located in periplasmic sulfur globules (purple sulfur bacteria) or deposited extracellularly (green sulfur bacteria) (13Hensen D. Sperling D. Truper H.G. Brune D.C. Dahl C. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 62: 794-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 14Dahl C. Prange A. Steudel R.

Microbiol. 1966; 42: 357-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).The SoxYZ complex is the pivotal component of the Sox system because it participates in every reaction of the pathway. Consideration of the molecular tasks it must undertake reveals the remarkable nature of this protein. The SoxYZ complex has to carry sulfur compounds containing either a terminal sulfane or sulfone group, and that may contain variable numbers of zero-valent sulfur atoms. In addition, it must interact with multiple partner proteins, namely SoxAX, SoxB, and SoxCD (or alternatives in organisms lacking this complex), and possibly other proteins coded at sox loci such as the flavocytochrome SoxEF and thioredoxins. SoxYZ is unique among known sulfur carrier proteins in that it both carries multiple types of adduct and exhibits specific interactions with multiple structurally and functionally unrelated partner proteins. To understand the molecular basis for this multitasking behavior we have determined the crystal structure of the SoxYZ complex from P. pantotrophus together with two mechanistically relevant derivatives. These structures reveal that the SoxYZ complex carries the Sox pathway intermediates on an unusual swinging arm structure in which the carrier cysteine is bracketed by two molecular universal joints. The structure also identifies an apolar pocket that may protect labile pathway intermediates.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPreparation of Plasmids for Heterologous Coexpression of SoxYZ—A plasmid suitable for heterologous co-expression of P. pantotrophus LMD82.5T SoxYZ proteins in Escherichia coli was constructed. PCR was used to amplify the soxY gene without the signal peptide coding region. This fragment was cloned into expression vector pQE80L (Qiagen) such that the soxY gene was translationally fused behind the hexahistidine tag-coding region specified by the vector. The partner soxZ was then cloned directly behind the soxY gene after amplification with appropriate primers. To ensure efficient translation of this second gene the primers used to amplify soxZ introduced a duplicate copy of the optimized E. coli ribosome binding site sequence of pQE80L directly in front of the gene. The P. pantotrophus SoxYZ expression plasmid was labeled pVS005. The primers used in this process are given in supplementary Table S1.Purification of Heterologously Expressed SoxYZ Proteins—P. pantotrophus SoxYZ was expressed in E. coli strain BL21 (16Wood W.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1966; 16: 118-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar) from plasmid pVS005. The cells were cultured aerobically at 37 °C in 1 liter of LB medium supplemented with 100 μgml–1 ampicillin. Expression of the soxYZ genes was induced at an A600 nm = 0.8 by addition of 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The cells were cultured for a further 5 h at 30 °C and then harvested by centrifugation at 9,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. The pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 5% glycerol, 10 mm imidazole (resuspension buffer) together with a tablet of EDTA-free Complete protease inhibitors (Roche), a pinch of lysozyme (Sigma), and a pinch of DNase I (Sigma). The suspension was passed 3 times through a French press at 8000 p.s.i. The lysate was centrifuged at 200,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min and the supernatant loaded onto a 5-ml Ni(II)-loaded chelating Sepharose Fast Flow column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with resuspension buffer. The column was washed with resuspension buffer and then resuspension buffer containing 25 mm imidazole until the A280 nm of the column eluant fell to a low and constant value. The SoxYZ protein was then eluted using a 40-ml linear 25–185 mm imidazole gradient in resuspension buffer. The SoxYZ peak from the Ni(II) affinity column was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 30 mm Bicine, pH 9.0, 5 mm DTT (Bicine buffer). The dialysate was loaded onto a 5-ml Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with the Bicine buffer. This was followed by a 40-ml linear 0 to 110 mm NaCl gradient in Bicine buffer and then isocratic elution of SoxYZ in Bicine buffer containing 110 mm NaCl. Fractions containing SoxYZ were pooled, dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm DTT at 4 °C and concentrated by ultrafiltration. Mass spectrometry demonstrated that both subunits had the masses expected of the native recombinant proteins (supplemental Fig. S2).P. pantotrophus SoxYZ bearing a β-mercaptoethanol adduct on the SoxY carrier cysteine was prepared in the same way as native SoxYZ except that 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol was added and DTT omitted from all purification buffers. N-terminal sequencing of the purified SoxYZ-β-mercaptoethanol adduct protein gave the expected sequence for SoxY (MRGSHHHHHH) but showed that SoxZ (ADDAKPRVKV) had its initiation methionine processed. Electrospray mass spectrometry analysis of this protein (supplemental Fig. S5A) showed a SoxZ peak at the expected mass of 11,719 Da and a SoxY peak at 76 Da greater than the expected mass of 12,375 Da corresponding to a single β-mercaptoethanol adduct. After dialysis against 5 mm DTT the mass of SoxZ was unchanged but the SoxY mass moved to its predicted value (supplemental Fig. S5B). This confirmed that the β-mercaptoethanol adduct was linked to SoxY via a disulfide bridge.For preparation of selenomethionine-labeled P. pantotrophus SoxYZ plasmid pVS005 was transformed into the E. coli methionine auxotroph B834 (16Wood W.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1966; 16: 118-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). The strain was cultured aerobically at 37 °C in LB medium containing 100 μgml–1 ampicillin until the A600 nm reached 0.2. The culture was then centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the pellet was washed twice with 15 ml of SelenoMet medium (Molecular Dimensions), and then resuspended in 1 liter of SelenoMet medium containing 100 μgml–1 ampicillin. The resulting culture was grown aerobically at 37 °C until the A600 nm reached 0.8 at which point 100 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added and growth was continued for a further 16 h. Purification of selenomethionine SoxYZ used the same protocol as employed for the SoxYZ-β-mercaptoethanol adduct. Mass spectrometry gave mass peaks at 12,592 and 11,766 Da corresponding to a full incorporation of selenomethionine in both the SoxY (three methionines) and SoxZ (one methionine) proteins with retention of β-mercaptoethanol derivatization of the SoxY carrier cysteine.The SoxY cysteine-S-sulfonate derivative of P. pantotrophus SoxYZ (SoxYZ-SO3) was produced by overnight dialysis of native SoxYZ against 50 mm potassium tetrathionate, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The derivatized protein was then purified by size exclusion chromatography. The nature of the modification to the SoxY cysteine residue was verified by mass spectrometry of the derivatized protein before and after treatment with 5 mm DTT (supplemental Fig. S6).Crystallization and Crystal Structure Determinations—The selenomethionyl SoxYZ-β-mercaptoethanol derivative was concentrated to 10 mg/ml prior to crystallization. Single crystals were obtained by vapor diffusion at 20 °C using PEG 3350 as precipitant and could be cryoprotected by addition of 25% (v/v) ethylene glycol. These crystals contained four copies of the heterodimer in the asymmetric unit. The crystal structure was solved by Se-MAD using heavy atom sites located by SOLVE (17Terwilliger T. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar). Refinement at 1.98-Å resolution resulted in a final model lacking only residues 35 to 41 in two copies of SoxZ (these residues lie at the extremity of the Z-loop), the C-terminal Gly-Gly dipeptide of two copies of SoxY, and the penultimate glycine residue alone in a further copy.Crystals of native P. pantotrophus SoxYZ were grown under similar conditions to those found for the β-mercaptoethanol derivative and were cryoprotected by addition of 15% (v/v) ethylene glycol. They were found to be essentially isomorphous with those of the selenomethionine protein and the structure was solved by molecular replacement using a monomer of selenomethionyl β-mercaptoethanol SoxYZ as search model. Refinement at 1.4-Å resolution resulted in a model in which all four copies of SoxY in the asymmetric unit lack the C-terminal Gly-Gly dipeptide. The carrier cysteine residue of SoxY, Cys110, is also missing in two of these copies. An additional redundant sulfur single wavelength anomalous dispersion dataset was taken from an isomorphous single crystal of native SoxYZ using X-rays of wavelength λ = 2.07 Å. Anomalous difference Fourier maps calculated using this data were used to help position the Sγ atom of the carrier cysteine residue in the two visible copies of this residue in SoxY.Crystals of the SoxYZ S-sulfonate derivative grew in vapor diffusion hanging drops at 20 °C. The protein concentration and crystallization condition used were similar to those employed for native SoxYZ and for the β-mercaptoethanol derivative. For this form of the protein, however, the crystals were of space group P1 with four copies of the heterodimer in the asymmetric unit. Crystals were cryoprotected by addition of mother liquor containing 5% (v/v) glycerol and 15% (v/v) ethylene glycol. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using a monomer of native SoxYZ lacking the C-terminal peptide as a search model and refined at 2.35-Å resolution.Data collection and refinement statistics for all the structures reported here are presented in Table 1.

Mass spectrometric analysis of the purified complex showed that both subunits had their expected molecular masses (supplemental Fig. S2). SoxZ possessed 108 amino acids (having lost its N-terminal methionine residue) and SoxY 124 amino acids (the predicted C-terminal 112 amino acids of SoxY plus the sequence Met-Arg-Gly-Ser followed by a hexahistidine tag and a Gly-Ser dipeptide introduced as a cloning artifact at the N terminus). No post-translational modification of the single cysteine residues in each of the subunits was observed. The complex was crystallized and a structure determined at 1.4-Å resolution. The final structural model has an overall crystallographic R-factor of 16.8% (Rfree 19.4%) (Table 1). The four copies of SoxYZ found in the crystallographic asymmetric unit are very similar, with a root mean square deviation calculated for the Cα atoms of 0.66 ± 0.36 Å.SoxY and SoxZ both possess an immunoglobulin-like β-sandwich fold consisting of 7 β-strands (labeled β1 to β7) organized in a typical Greek key topology and arranged in stacked three-stranded and four-stranded antiparallel sheets (Fig. 2A). The folds of SoxY and SoxZ are clearly homologous despite the absence of significant sequence similarity between the subunits. Structural alignment of the two subunits gives a root mean square deviation of 1.8 Å for 84 aligned residues of which only 13 are identical (Fig. 2B). These identical residues appear to be conserved for structural reasons. In addition to the core strands of the immunoglobulin-like fold, an additional β-strand (βA) is found in the loop joining strands β1 and β2 in both subunits. The βA strand forms a short parallel sheet by hydrogen bonding to a further strand (labeled βB) that forms a continuation of strand β7. This interaction is present in all subunits of the four heterodimers found in the asymmetric unit except in one copy of SoxY in which strand βB does not form. This variation is apparently due to lattice contact differences between molecules in the crystal and suggests that the βA–βB interaction is susceptible to disruption.FIGURE 2Structural analysis of native SoxYZ. A, architecture of the SoxYZ complex. Theβ-strands of the immunoglobulin-likeβ-sandwich fold of the Z subunit are colored cyan, whereas those of the Y subunit are in yellow. The additional βA and βB strands are colored dark blue in both subunits. The Z-loop is colored light green. The N-terminalα-helix of SoxY is in red. Those residues of the C-terminal pentapeptide of SoxY that were visible in the electron density map are shown in ball and stick representation. The sole cysteine residue of the SoxZ subunit (Cys53Z) is buried and solvent-inaccessible. N and C termini of both subunits are labeled where unobscured. Here and elsewhere the primed labels refer to the SoxZ subunit. B, sequence alignment of P. pantotrophus SoxY mature domain and SoxZ based on their structural superposition. Secondary structural elements in both subunits are shown and identical residues are highlighted in red. The residues of the Z-loop are boxed as are the single cysteine residues of each subunit. C, the 2Fo – Fc electron density map in the region of cysteine 110 of the SoxY subunit calculated at 1.4-Å resolution and contoured at the 1.0σ level (gray contours). Selected residues forming an apolar pocket adjacent to the carrier cysteine are shown as are three ordered water molecules (W1–W3). Hydrogen bonds are indicated by dashed lines. Note that the close approach of the bound ethylene glycol molecule (labeled *) and the Sγ atom of the carrier cysteine residue can only be explained by assuming partial occupancy of these pocket occupants. Superimposed on the 2Fo – Fc map is the sulfur anomalous difference Fourier map in this region contoured at the 2σ level and calculated using data to 2.2-Å resolution from a dataset measured using x-ray radiation of wavelength 2.07 Å (blue contours).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The main differences between the structures of the two subunits of SoxYZ are the presence of an α-helix at the N terminus of SoxY, an extended loop linking strands β2 and β3 in SoxZ (hereafter termed the Z-loop), and the conserved GGCGG pentapeptide (residues 108–112) containing the carrier cysteine that forms an extension of the C terminus of SoxY relative to SoxZ (Fig. 2, A and B). Analysis of residue average temperature factors shows that the Z-loop and the C-terminal pentapeptide of SoxY bearing the carrier cysteine are among the most mobile regions of the SoxYZ complex (supplemental Fig. S1). Indeed, no electron density is observed for the extreme C-terminal Gly-Gly dipeptide of SoxY (Fig. 2C) and the residues of a β-turn at the extremity of the Z loop are visible in only two copies of the complex.The side chain of the single cysteine residue in SoxZ contributes to the hydrophobic core of the subunit and is completely inaccessible to solvent (Fig. 2A). Previous studies have identified a cross-link between this residue and the carrier cysteine of SoxY and a role for this linkage in the Sox mechanism has been suggested (22Quentmeier A. Hellwig P. Bardischewsky F. Grelle G. Kraft R. Friedrich C.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 312: 1011-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The structure reveals that this residue could not plausibly be involved in a disulfide linkage to SoxY in the native protein.Overall, 20 hydrogen bonds and a single salt bridge contribute to the stabilization of the SoxYZ heterodimer interface. These contacts result in the burial of 1121 ± 18 Å2 of solvent accessible surface area, representing around 18% of the surface area of isolated SoxZ and 20% of the surface area of isolated SoxY. The interface is also well packed as evidenced by a calculated shape complementarity statistic (23Lawrence M.C. Colman P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 946-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar) of 0.74. The heterodimer interface thus has the general characteristics of that from a permanent complex (18Jones S. Thornton J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2254) Google Scholar). In the crystal, SoxYZ forms a higher order (SoxYZ)2 heterotetramer structure in which SoxYZ heterodimers interact primarily through the SoxY N-terminal helix (supplemental Fig. S3). This tetramer interaction is probably not of physiological importance because it is not observed in analytical ultracentrifugation measurements (carried out either in the crystallization buffer or at neutral pH), which confirm that SoxYZ forms a stable heterodimer in solution (supplemental Fig. S4). The SoxZ subunit of SoxYZ has the highest degree of structural similarity to the unpublished SoxZ protein from Thermus thermophilus (root mean square deviation of 1.9 Å) (PDB entry 1V8H). The closest structural neighbor to SoxY is the superoxide reductase from Pyrococcus furiosus (root mean square deviation of 2.2 Å) (PDB entry 1DO6) (24Yeh A.P. Hu Y. Jenney Jr., F.E. Adams M.W. Rees D.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2499-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The intersubunit packing of this homodimeric protein is similar to, but looser than, that of SoxYZ.The SoxY GGCGG Carrier Pentapeptide and Its Environment—In the structure of native P. pantotrophus SoxYZ the conserved GGCGG carrier pentapeptide immediately follows the βB strand of SoxY and lies along the top of the immunoglobulin β-sandwich fold (Fig. 2A).

https://openalex.org/W2016490468,"Aquaporin-1 (AQP1) channels contribute to osmotically induced water transport in several organs including the kidney and serosal membranes such as the peritoneum and the pleura. In addition, AQP1 channels have been shown to conduct cationic currents upon stimulation by cyclic nucleotides. To date, the short term regulation of AQP1 function by other major intracellular signaling pathways has not been studied. In the present study, we therefore investigated the regulation of AQP1 by protein kinase C. AQP1 wild type channels were expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Water permeability was assessed by hypotonic challenges. Activation of protein kinase C (PKC) by 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG) induced a marked increase of AQP1-dependent water permeability. This regulation was abolished in mutated AQP1 channels lacking both consensus PKC phosphorylation sites Thr157 and Thr239 (termed AQP1 ΔPKC). AQP1 cationic currents measured with double-electrode voltage clamp were markedly increased after pharmacological activation of PKC by either OAG or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Deletion of either Thr157 or Thr239 caused a marked attenuation of PKC-dependent current increases, and deletion of both phosphorylation sites in AQP1 ΔPKC channels abolished the effect. In vitro phosphorylation studies with synthesized peptides corresponding to amino acids 154–168 and 236–250 revealed that both Thr157 and Thr239 are phosphorylated by PKC. Upon stimulation by cyclic nucleotides, AQP1 wild type currents exhibited a strong activation. This regulation was not affected after deletion of PKC phosphorylation sites in AQP1 ΔPKC channels. In conclusion, this is the first study to show that PKC positively regulates both water permeability and ionic conductance of AQP1 channels. This new pathway of AQP1 regulation is independent of the previously described cyclic nucleotide pathway and may contribute to the PKC stimulation of AQP1-modulated processes such as endothelial permeability, angiogenesis, and urine concentration.

King L.S. Yasui M. Guggino W.B. Ottersen O.P. Fujiyoshi Y. Engel A. Nielsen S. J. Physiol. 2002; 542: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). Their main physiological function is rapid transmembrane transport of water driven by osmotic gradients. In addition to water transport, some aquaporins also conduct ion currents. In humans, 11 aquaporins have been found so far (AQP0–AQP10). Of these, AQP1 is the predominant and least specialized subtype. It plays a major role in constitutive water transport through the membranes of several cell types including endothelial cells, red blood cells, and renal proximal tubule cells (1Agre P. King L.S. Yasui M. Guggino W.B. Ottersen O.P. Fujiyoshi Y. Engel A. Nielsen S. J. Physiol. 2002; 542: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). It has been shown that AQP1 may also function as a cyclic nucleotide-gated cation channel that is activated mainly by cGMP and indirectly also by cAMP (2Anthony T.L. Brooks H.L. Boassa D. Leonov S. Yanochko G.M. Regan J.W. Yool A.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 576-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 3Yool A.J. Stamer D. Regan J.W. Science. 1996; 273: 1216-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Recently, ion currents of native aquaporins were confirmed in choroid plexus epithelium and shown to modulate fluid transport of those cells (4Boassa D. Stamer W.D. Yool A.J. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 7811-7819Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Because of its significance for determining endothelial water permeability, AQP1 has been found to play a major physiological role in the peritoneal membrane (5Devuyst O. Ni J. Verbavatz J. Biol. Cell. 2005; 97: 667-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Subsequently, it has been shown to be the molecular correlate of the “ultrasmall pore” responsible for transcellular water permeability during peritoneal dialysis (6Ni J. Verbavatz J.M. Rippe A. Boisde I. Moulin P. Rippe B. Verkman A.S. Devuyst O. Kidney Int. 2006; 69: 1518-1525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent reports have demonstrated a previously unexpected role of AQP1 in cell migration (7Sadoun S. Papadopoulos M.C. Hara-Chikuma M. Verkman A.S. Nature. 2005; 434: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 8Hara-Chikuma M. Verkman A.S. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2006; 17: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 9Belge H. Devuyst O. Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. 2006; 21: 2069-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Endothelial cells lacking AQP1 have impaired cell motility because of reduced formation of lamellipodia, resulting in impaired angiogenesis (7Sadoun S. Papadopoulos M.C. Hara-Chikuma M. Verkman A.S. Nature. 2005; 434: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Interestingly, AQP1 was also found to be essential for normal migration of renal proximal tubule cells and restitution of renal injury (8Hara-Chikuma M. Verkman A.S. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2006; 17: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 9Belge H. Devuyst O. Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. 2006; 21: 2069-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). It is well documented that aquaporin channels may be subject to intense short term regulation by cellular signal cascades, with the most recognized example being the cAMP-dependent protein kinase-dependent regulation of AQP-2 in the kidney collecting duct (1Agre P. King L.S. Yasui M. Guggino W.B. Ottersen O.P. Fujiyoshi Y. Engel A. Nielsen S. J. Physiol. 2002; 542: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar, 10Verkman A.S. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 118: 3225-3232Crossref Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, little is known to date about the short term regulation of AQP1, because this channel was originally considered to be constitutively open (1Agre P. King L.S. Yasui M. Guggino W.B. Ottersen O.P. Fujiyoshi Y. Engel A. Nielsen S. J. Physiol. 2002; 542: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). The role of signaling pathways apart from cyclic nucleotides in the regulation of AQP1 has not been investigated to date. The protein kinase C (PKC) system is a key component of intracellular signaling, and PKC activation is a central pathway downstream of Gq/11 coupled receptors such as adrenergic α1 receptors and muscarinergic M1 receptors (11Rockman H.A. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 2002; 415: 206-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar, 12Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2347) Google Scholar). PKC has been shown to be involved in the regulation of structurally diverse membrane proteins, particularly ion channels (13Karle C.A. Zitron E. Zhang W. Wendt-Nordahl G. Kathoöfer S. Thomas D.

Recently, it has been demonstrated that PKC mediates the dopamine-dependent down-regulation of renal aquaporin-4 channels (15Zelenina M. Zelenin S. Bondar A.A. Brismar H. Aperia A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283 (–F318): F309Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 16Han Z. Wax M.B. Patil R.V. J. Biol.

Notably, a major role of PKC in the regulation of endothelial permeability, angiogenesis, and water transport in the proximal renal tubule has been observed in physiological studies (17Chang Y.S.

Here, we show that PKC positively regulates AQP1 channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes. PKC activation induces an increase of both water permeability and ion currents mediated by AQP1. On the molecular level, the effect depends on both consensus PKC phosphorylation sites Thr157 and Thr239 with approximately half of the overall effect being attributable to each site. Solutions and Drug Administration—Two microelectrode voltage clamp measurements of Xenopus oocytes were performed in isotonic NaCl saline containing (in mm) 100 NaCl, 2 KCl, 4.3 MgCl, and 5 HEPES, pH 7.3. Ca2+ was omitted from the bath solution to minimize Ca2+-dependent Cl– currents in the oocytes as described by Barish (25Barish M.E. J. Physiol. 1983; 342: 309-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Current and voltage electrodes were filled with 3 m KCl solution. OAG (1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol), staurosporine, and chelerythrine (all from Calbiochem) were dissolved in Me2SO to stock solutions of 10 mm and stored at –20 °C. Aliquots of the stock solutions were diluted to the desired concentration with the bath solution on the day of experiments. The maximum concentration of Me2SO in the bath had no effects on the measured currents. All of the measurements were performed at room temperature (20 °C). Electrophysiology and Data Analysis—The two microlelectrode voltage clamp configuration was used to record currents from Xenopus laevis oocytes as published previously (13Karle C.A. Zitron E. Zhang W. Wendt-Nordahl G. Kathoöfer S. Thomas D. Gut B. Scholz E. Vahl C.F. Katus H.A. Kiehn J. Circulation. 2002; 106: 1493-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Pclamp software (Axon instruments) was used for generation of the voltage pulse protocols and for data acquisition. The statistical data are presented as the means ± S.E. Statistical significance was evaluated using Student’s t test for pairwise comparison and analysis of variance for comparison of several groups of data. The differences were considered to be significant if the p value was <0.05 and highly significant if the p value was <0.01. In the figures, significance levels are indicated by asterisks (*,p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001). All of the results were obtained in oocytes from at least three different batches. Analysis of Osmotic Swelling—Water permeability assays at room temperature (20 °C) were initiated with the transfer of AQP1-expressing or control oocytes at time zero from 200 mosm ND96 saline into 100 mm mosm ND96 diluted with distilled water as described by Anthony et al. (2Anthony T.L. Brooks H.L. Boassa D. Leonov S. Yanochko G.M. Regan J.W. Yool A.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 576-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). After the transfer of the cell, the images were recorded at intervals of 30 s for 5 min. Volume changes were analyzed with ImageJ on the basis of digital images captured every 30 s with a digital Nikon Coolpix 5400 camera on a Nikon SMZ 1500 stereomicroscope. The data were analyzed as proportional change in volume and normalized to the initial volume at time zero. All of the results were obtained in oocytes from at least three different batches. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Sequence analysis revealed two potential PKC phosphorylation residues at positions Thr157 and Thr239. To eliminate PKC-mediated phosphorylation at these positions, the two threonine residues were replaced with alanine. This resulted in the mutated channels T157A and T239A. Through repetitive mutagenesis, both point mutations were introduced into a single clone termed AQP1-ΔPKC. Point mutations were generated with the QuikChange protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). We used the primers CGTGCTGGCTACTG CCGACCGGAGGCG (forward) and CGCCTCCGGTCGGCAGTAGCCAGCACG (reverse) to introduce mutation T157A, and for mutation T239A, we used the primers CAGCAGTGACCTCGCAGACCGCGTGAAG (forward) and CTTCACGCGGTCTGC GAGGTCACTGCTG (reverse). All of the cDNAs used in this study were verified by complete sequencing (Sequence Laboratories Goöttingen GmBH). Expression of AQP1 Channels in Xenopus Oocytes—The human AQP1 wild type clone was a kind gift from Peter Agre (Baltimore, MD). cRNA was prepared from the corresponding cDNA (AQP1 WT, AQP1-T157A, AQP1-T239A, and AQP1-ΔPKC) with T3 RNA polymerase after linearization with SmaI using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE in vitro transcription kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). AQP1 cRNA of wild type and mutant channels (always at the same concentration of 20 ng/μl) was injected into stage V and VI defolliculated oocytes using a Nanoject automatic injector (Drummond, Broomall, PA). The volume of injected cRNA solution was 46 nl/oocyte. The measurements were performed 2–3 days after expression. Peptide Synthesis—Peptides corresponding to amino acid sequences 154–168 (P154–168, LATTDRRRRDLGGSG, with a single conservative replacement of alanine by glycine at residue 168 to improve solubility) and to 236–250 (P236–250, SDLTDRVKVWTSGEV, with a single conservative replacement of glutamine by glutamate at residue 249 to improve solubility) were obtained from Sigma-Genosys. Homologous peptides containing threonine-to-alanine mutations at residues 157 and 239, respectively, were obtained from the same source and referred to as P154–168(T157A) and P236–250(T239A), respectively. In Vitro Phosphorylation Assays—10 μl (5 μg) of peptide and 25 ng of active PKC (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions, Lake Placid, NY) were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min in the presence of ADBII, which was composed of 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm CaCl2), 10 μl of lipid activator (1 mg/ml phosphatidylserine, 0.1 mg/ml diacylglycerol, 0.3% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol), and 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (GE Healthcare, Munich, Germany) including 15 mm MgCl2 and 200 μm unlabeled ATP in ADBII. The reactions were stopped by adding 4× SDS sample buffer, and the mixture was boiled for 5 min. The peptides were resolved by 20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography using Hyperfilm MS film (GE Healthcare, Munich, Germany). The bands were quantified densitometrically with ImageJ on the basis of digitalized images. Oocyte Membrane Isolation and Western Blotting Analysis—Noninjected and AQP1-cRNA-injected (200 ng/μl) Xenopus oocytes were used to isolate crude membrane fractions. 23 oocytes were incubated in 1000 μl of ice-cold hypotonic phosphate buffer (7.5 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, plus a protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science)) for 5 min. All of the steps were done at 4 °C. The samples were vortexed and pipetted repeatedly to lyse the oocytes. The yolk and cellular debris were pelleted at 500 × g for 5 min. The membranes were then pelleted at 48,000 × g for 30 min. The membrane pellets were resuspended in 30 μl of 1× SDS protein loading buffer, incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, and electrophoresed on a 12% polyacrylamide SDS gel. Afterward they were electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose filters (Whatman, Dasel, Germany). The blots were blocked for 1 h with TBS-T (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 138 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 3% nonfat dry milk. The blots were then incubated with AQP1 primary antibody (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany) in 3% milk at 4 °C overnight. The blots were washed three times for 15 min with TBS-T and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:2000) (Cell Signaling Technology, Frankfurt, Germany) for 1 h at room temperature and were washed again three times. After washing, immune complexes were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; GE Healthcare, Munich, Germany). Protein Kinase C Activation Increases Water Permeability of Aquaporin-1 Channels—Human AQP1 channels were expressed heterologously in Xenopus oocytes to allow measurement of water permeability and ion conductance. First, water permeability of the membrane of those cells was assessed by hypotonic swelling experiments according to Anthony et al. (2Anthony T.L. Brooks H.L. Boassa D. Leonov S. Yanochko G.M. Regan J.W. Yool A.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 576-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The duration of these experiments had to be limited to 5 min (as in other studies (2Anthony T.L. Brooks H.L. Boassa D. Leonov S. Yanochko G.M. Regan J.W. Yool A.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 576-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar)) to avoid cell destruction as a consequence of the volume increases. To activate PKC in a group of experiments, specific PKC activator OAG (a synthetic and more stable analogue of the physiological activator diacylglycerol) was added to the hypo-osmotic solution at a concentration of 10 μm. No preincubation of cells in OAG was performed. Summary data of the time course of volume change in those cells is plotted in Fig. 1A. Within 5 min, cell volume increased to 131.1 ± 2.6% (n = 8; p < 0.01 in comparison with control experiments without OAG). Without addition of OAG to the hypoosmotic solution, cells expressing AQP1 exhibited a smaller volume increase to 115.3 ± 1.9% (n = 6; Fig. 1A; significantly different from the effect of OAG with p < 0.01). Cells that did not express AQP1 did not show any relevant volume change (100.3 ± 0.3%; n = 7; Fig. 1A; p < 0.001 in comparison with cells expressing AQP1). Regulation of Aquaporin-1 Water Permeability by PKC Is Abolished in AQP1-ΔPKC Channels Lacking Phosphorylation Sites Thr157 and Thr239—Sequence analysis of AQP1 channel amino acid sequence revealed two consensus sites for PKC phosphorylation at Thr157 and Thr239, respectively. To elucidate the functional role of those sites, we modified channel subunits by site-directed mutagenesis. The respective threonin residue was replaced by alanine to abolish phosphorylation at the respective site. Channels lacking both PKC phosphorylation sites (i.e. including mutations T157A and T239A) were termed AQP1-ΔPKC and measured under conditions analogous to those described for wild type channels. The results are summarized in Fig. 1B. After 5 min of exposure to the hypo-osmotic solution, the volume of oocytes expressing AQP1-ΔPKC channels increased to 109.8 ± 1.1% of the respective initial values (Fig. 1B, left column, n = 5). Then experiments were repeated, and OAG (10 μm) was added to the hypo-osmotic solution to activate PKC. In contrast to the effect observed in AQP1 wt channels, volume increase was not enhanced by PKC activation in AQP1-ΔPKC channels. After the observation period of 5 min, the volume of those cells increased to 110.4 ± 0.6% (Fig. 1B, right column, n = 5), i.e. values without significant difference to those observed without application of OAG (p ≫ 0.05). Therefore, we concluded that inactivation of both PKC phosphorylation sites abolishes the positive regulation of AQP1 water permeability by protein kinase C. Protein Kinase C Activation Increases Aquaporin-1 Ion Currents—It has been demonstrated previously that AQP1 channels also conduct ions and that this conductance is activated by an increase in intracellular cyclic nucleotide levels, particularly cGMP and potentially also cAMP (2Anthony T.L. Brooks H.L. Boassa D. Leonov S. Yanochko G.M. Regan J.W. Yool A.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 576-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 3Yool A.J. Stamer D. Regan J.W. Science. 1996; 273: 1216-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Hence, we examined whether the PKC system also regulates AQP1 ion currents. A standardized voltage protocol was used to elicit AQP1 currents in Xenopus oocytes heterologously expressing these channels. From a holding potential of –30 mV that is close to the reversal potential of AQP1 currents in low K+ solution, voltage steps to potentials from –110 mV to +60 mV (400 ms each) were applied. After recording a measurement under control conditions, phorbol ester PMA (100 nm) was perfused into the bath for 30 min to activate PKC. In contrast to the water permeability measurements, the electrophysiological experiments did not affect the integrity of the cells and could therefore be extended to an observation period of 30 min (instead of 5 min) that allowed a longer observation of the time courses. Measurements were recorded at intervals of 5 min until the end of the observation period. Outward current amplitudes during the step to +60 mV were determined and compared with quantify effects. Typical recordings under control conditions and after 30 min of exposure to PMA are shown in Fig. 2. Under control conditions, the cells merely exhibited small currents (Fig. 2A) with a reversal potential of approximately –30 mV and lack of inward or outward rectification (Fig. 2C). Application of PMA induced a marked increase of currents (Fig. 2B) without affecting reversal potential and rectification (Fig. 2C). During observation of the PMA effect, the currents increased exponentially and reached a plateau after ∼20 min (Fig. 2D). Overall, a relative increase of current amplitudes by 102.5 ± 4.1% was observed (Fig. 2E; n = 10; p < 0.001 in comparison with control experiments). Control experiments were performed with oocytes that did not express AQP1. Those cells exhibited a merely small current increase (Fig. 2, D and E; n = 7; 14.2 ± 4.0%). For additional control experiments, oocytes expressing AQP1 were monitored for 30 min under identical conditions, but without the addition of PMA to the bath solution. Again, only a small current increase was observed in those cells (Fig. 2, D and E; n = 9, 17.1 ± 2.2%). PMA is a well established and highly potent activator of PKC, but it is less specific than OAG. Therefore, we repeated the experiments using OAG instead of PMA to further confirm the role of PKC in the observed effect. Because OAG is less potent than PMA, a higher concentration of OAG had to be applied (10 μm) as already used in previous studies from our laboratory (13Karle C.A. Zitron E. Zhang W. Wendt-Nordahl G. Kathoöfer S. Thomas D. Gut B. Scholz E. Vahl C.F. Katus H.A. Kiehn J. Circulation. 2002; 106: 1493-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The experiments were performed as described for PMA. The results are shown in Fig. 3. OAG also induced a marked current increase without affecting biophysical current characteristics (Fig. 3, A–C). Time course of effect was comparable with that seen with PMA (Fig. 3D). Overall, currents increased by 117.9 ± 3.2% (Fig. 3E; n = 12; p < 0.001 in comparison with control experiments). Co-application of PKC inhibitor chelerythrine (10 μm) suppressed the effect almost completely, resulting in a relative current increase by merely 35.6 ± 3.2% (Fig. 3, D and E; n = 9). Control experiments either without exposure to OAG or without expression of AQP1 yielded current increases of 17.1 ± 2.2% (n = 9) and 21.9 ± 3.6% (n = 7), respectively (Fig. 3, D and E). The small current increases in all of the control experiments described in this study were stable and similar effects of statistical significance when compared with the respective initial values (p < 0.01 each). Their relative amplitude was within the range of nonspecific current increases that are commonly observed in the Xenopus oocyte expression system (26Zitron E. Kiesecker C. Luöck S. Kathoöfer S.

Sets of corresponding control experiments are shown in each figure together with the observed effects (Figs. 2, D and E; 3, D and E; 4, D and E; and 5, D and E).FIGURE 4Phosphorylation sites Thr157 and Thr239 are essential for protein kinase C regulation of aquaporin-1 channels. Aquaporin-1 channels exhibit two PKC phosphorylation sites at Thr157 and Thr239, respectively. Mutated AQP1 channels with one inactivated site (AQP1-T157A and AQP1-T239A) or with both sites inactivated (AQP1-ΔPKC) were measured under conditions identical to those described for AQP1 wt channels. PKC was activated by application of OAG (10 μm). AQP1-ΔPKC currents at base line were comparable with those of AQP1 wt and exhibited the same biophysical characteristics. Western blots of cells expressing AQP1 wt and mutant channels demonstrated identical patterns in line with those reported from the literature (2Anthony T.L. Brooks H.L. Boassa D. Leonov S.

The position of the 28-kDa band is marked by the black arrow, and the white arrow shows the running direction of the gel. Noninjected oocytes were used as controls. Functionally, however, AQP1 mutants exhibited a markedly attenuated response to OAG (A–C). Time course of measurements is plotted in D. For comparison, the effect observed in wild type (wt) channels is included. Summary data after 30 min are shown in E. Inactivation of either of the two sites reduced PKC effects to approximately half of the values observed in wild type channels with 78.7% in T157A and 78.6% in T239A (n = 9 each; p < 0.001 each). In AQP1-ΔPKC channels lacking both sites, the effect was almost absent, with values approaching those of the control experiments (41%; n = 7; p < 0.05 compared with T157A and T239A). Control experiments performed with all clones yielded results comparable with the control experiments with wild type channels and with those with oocytes that did not express AQP1. In F, results of the in vitro phosphorylation assays of peptides homologous to the phosphorylation sites and the respective mutants are displayed. The autoradiograph is shown in the inset (results were reproduced in two experiments). The relative intensity of the corresponding radiographic band is shown as column graph.

https://openalex.org/W1966010528,"Acyl carrier protein (ACP) is a key component of the fatty acid synthesis pathways of both type I and type II synthesis systems. A large number of structure-function studies of various type II ACPs have been reported, but all are in vitro studies that assayed function or interaction of mutant ACPs with various enzymes of fatty acid synthesis or transfer. Hence in these studies functional properties of various mutant ACPs were assayed with only a subset of the many ACP-interacting proteins, which may not give an accurate overall view of the function of these proteins in vivo. This is especially so because Escherichia coli ACP has been reported to interact with several proteins that have no known roles in lipid metabolism. We therefore tested a large number of mutant derivatives of E. coli ACP carrying single amino acid substitutions for their abilities to restore growth to an E. coli strain carrying a temperature-sensitive mutation in acpP, the gene that encodes ACP. Many of these mutant proteins had previously been tested in vitro thus providing data for comparison with our results. We found that several mutant ACPs containing substitutions of ACP residues reported previously to be required for ACP function in vitro support normal growth of the acpP mutant strain. However, several mutant proteins reported to be severely defective in vitro failed to support growth of the acpP strain in vivo (or supported only weak growth). A collection of ACPs from diverse bacteria and from three eukaryotic organelles was also tested. All of the bacterial ACPs tested restored growth to the E. coli acpP mutant strain except those from two related bacteria, Enterococcus faecalis and Lactococcus lactis. Only one of the three eukaryotic organellar ACPs allowed growth. Strikingly the ACP is that of the apicoplast of Plasmodium falciparum (the protozoan that causes malaria). The fact that an ACP from a such diverse organism can replace AcpP function in E. coli suggests that some of the protein-protein interactions detected for AcpP may be not be essential for growth of E. coli.

Both type I and type II fatty acid biosynthetic systems have a key component, the acyl carrier protein (ACP), 2The abbreviations used are: ACP, acyl carrier protein; IPTG, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. that is essential for function (1De Lay N.R.

In both synthetic systems the ACP component carries fatty acyl intermediates among the different enzyme active sites. To perform this function ACP must be posttranslationally modified via the transfer of a 4′-phosphopantetheine moiety from CoA to a conserved serine residue of ACP. Attachment of this prosthetic group is mandatory because the thiol group of the phosphopantetheinyl moiety carries the intermediates of fatty acid biosynthesis. In the type I systems found in the mammalian cytosol, ACP is a domain of a very large polypeptide that contains all the enzymatic domains required for fatty acid biosynthesis (4Smith S. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1248-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). The functional mammalian fatty-acid synthase is a dimer of two identical polypeptides in head-to-head orientation that synthesizes the fatty acids used for complex lipid biosynthesis (5Witkowski A.

The finished full-length fatty acid is cleaved from the ACP domain and released into the cytosol by a thioesterase domain. In the fungal type I systems the active sites are divided between two non-identical proteins that function as hexamers with the ACP domain on the α subunit (7Cronan J.E. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 232-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 8Smith S. Science. 2006; 311: 1251-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Although the two type I enzymes have strikingly different structures and produce different products (the fungal enzymes produce acyl-CoAs), they function by the same general mechanism (8Smith S. Science. 2006; 311: 1251-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In the type II systems found in bacteria, mitochondria, most plant plastids, and apicomplexan protozoans, ACPs are small (8–10 kDa), discrete, and very soluble proteins that are highly acidic (9Rock C.O. Jackowski S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 1155-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli ACP, which is encoded by the gene acpP (10Rawlings M. Cronan Jr., J.E.

Chem. 1979; 254: 9778-9785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) E. coli ACP consists of four α helices that form a hydrophobic pocket. The hydrophobic pocket is able to accommodate an acyl chain up to eight carbons in length (15Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5013-5017Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Near the bottom of the pocket lies Ile-54, a residue that interacts with residues of helices II, III, and IV (13Roujeinikova A. Baldock C. Simon W.J. Gilroy J. Baker P.J. Stuitje A.R. Rice D.W.

Serine 36 of E. coli ACP is the site of 4′-phosphopantetheine attachment and is located at the end of helix II near the opening of the hydrophobic pocket. Prosthetic group attachment is catalyzed by the AcpS phosphopantetheinyl transferase (20De Lay N.R. Cronan J.E. Mol.

Chem. 1981; 256: 5750-5754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It should be noted that, although the mammalian fatty-acid synthase ACP is a protein domain rather than a discrete protein, upon expression of the isolated domain it was found to have a structure highly similar to that of E. coli ACP and to be a substrate for two type II bacterial fatty acid synthetic enzymes (23Reed M.A. Schweizer M. Szafranska A.E. Arthur C. Nicholson T.P. Cox R.J. Crosby J. Crump M.P. Simpson T.J. Org. Biomol. Chem. 2003; 1: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Therefore, studies of type II ACPs should provide data useful in understanding the functions of type I ACP domains. E. coli ACP not only interacts with AcpS and the fatty acid biosynthetic enzymes but also with several different acyltransferases involved in complex lipid synthesis. Each acyltransferase targets an acyl group of appropriate chain length and oxidation state to a specific biosynthetic pathway. There are separate acyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of lipid A (LpxA, LpxM, and MsbB), phospholipids (PlsB, PlsC, and PlsX), lipoic acid (LipB), acylhomoserine lactones (LuxI), and protein toxins (HlyC-type proteins). Several recent in vitro studies have attempted to identify residues important for the interaction of E. coli and other ACPs with various enzymes of lipid synthesis. A difficulty with these studies is that only the abilities of AcpP site-directed mutants to function as substrates for only one or two enzymes were assayed, although more general conclusions have sometimes been drawn. Another function often tested is the activity of mutant ACPs in the E. coli in vitro fatty acid synthetic system. Although this system has the advantage of involving an appreciable number of enzymes, some enzymes are not required for function of the in vitro system, and because the system functions at only a few percent of the rate of fatty acid biosynthesis in vivo (17Flaman A.S.

Other studies have assayed the activity of several mutant ACPs as the substrate for a single fatty acid biosynthetic enzyme (25Worsham L.M. Earls L. Jolly C. Langston K.G. Trent M.S. Ernst-Fonberg M.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 26Zhang Y.M. Rao M.S. Heath R.J. Price A.C. Olson A.J. Rock C.O. White S.W. J. Biol.

Although these studies have provided useful data, they are of a piecemeal nature and hence often difficult to interpret in physiological terms. For example, some mutant ACPs function in one in vitro assay but not in a another (17Flaman A.S. Chen J.M. Van Iderstine S.C. Byers D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35934-35939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 24Gong H. Byers D.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Therefore, our understanding of the residues critical to the overall physiological function of ACP is very limited. The above in vitro approaches were taken largely because no acpP mutants were available to assay function in vivo. The acpP gene is essential (1De Lay N.R. Cronan J.E. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and thus conditionally defective mutants were required. We recently reported the isolation and characterization of the first conditionally defective acpP mutants. These acpP(Ts) mutants encode proteins that are functional at 30 °C but that rapidly lose function and are degraded at 42 °C (1De Lay N.R. Cronan J.E. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In this study we report the abilities of a large panel of E. coli AcpP site-directed mutants to allow growth of an acpP(Ts) mutant strain under non-permissive conditions. We also tested the abilities of ACPs from a variety of other bacteria and eukaryote organelles to allow growth of the acpP(Ts) strain. Bacterial Strains and Plasmids—The strains used in this study were all derivatives of the E. coli K-12 strain MG1655, the genome sequence of which is known (Table 1). Strains NRD29 and NRD44 were described in a previous study (1De Lay N.R. Cronan J.E. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Strain NRD44 carries a nonpolar deletion of panD and was used in the β-[3H]alanine labeling experiments described below. Strain NRD29, which contains a temperature-sensitive allele of acpP and a chloramphenicol resistance cassette inserted into the downstream gene fabF, was used in the complementation studies.TABLE 1Bacterial strainsStrainRelevant genotypeSource or Ref.CAG12025yadC::Tn1063Nichols B.P.

The araBAD deletion of strain NRD204 was transduced via phage P1vir into the ΔlacZY strain JT34 generating strain NRD205. The cat cassette was subsequently removed from strain NRD205 using the FLP recombinase encoded on plasmid pCP20 (29Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The yadC::Tn10 insertion of strain CAG12025 was transduced using phage P1vir into the pcnB mutant strain WT286 to yield strain NRD214. The presence of the pcnB286 allele in strains NRD214 and WT286 was confirmed by sequencing of the PCR product generated using the primers pcnB-For and pcnB-Rev. The pcnB286 allele was transduced from strain NRD214 into strain NRD206 by phage P1vir. Transductants were selected for the acquisition of tetracycline resistance and then screened for the presence of the pcnB286 allele by PCR using primers pcnB-For and pcnB-Rev. The PCR products generated from the amplification of the wild type pcnB and the pcnB286 alleles using primers pcnB-For and pcnB-Rev could be distinguished by gel electrophoresis because the pcnB286 allele is an 81-bp deletion. The transductant that acquired the tetracycline resistance of the yadC::Tn10 and the pcnB286 allele was named NRD216. The acpP(Ts) mutation of strain NRD28 was transduced via phage P1vir into strain NRD216 to yield strain NRD224. Strain NRD224 harboring the lacIq-containing plasmid pMS421 was used for the complementation studies with the pMR19-derived plasmids. Plasmids derived from pMR19 (10Rawlings M. Cronan Jr., J.E. J.

The primers used in this study (Table 2) were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. Cloned species ACPs were PCR-amplified from genomic or plasmid DNA and inserted into the pCR2.1 vector by TOPO cloning (Invitrogen) and sequenced using the M13For (–21) and M13Rev (–24) primers. Site-directed mutants of the synthetic E. coli ACP gene were made by QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) and were sequenced in the pBAD322 vector using pNRD26seq-For and -Rev primers. All sequencing was performed by the Core Sequencing Unit at the Keck Center for Comparative and Functional Genomics at the University of Illinois.TABLE 2Summary of the complementation and 4′-phosphopantetheine modification resultsAcyl carrier proteinComplementationAcpS 4′-PPa4′-PP, 4′-phosphopantetheine.

Open table in a new tab Culture Media and Growth Conditions—All strains were grown in liquid medium or agar plates of RB or minimal E salts. RB or minimal E medium was supplemented at final concentrations with the following carbon sources: arabinose (0.2%), glucose (0.2%), or glycerol (0.8%). Antibiotics were added to liquid medium or agar plates at the following concentrations: kanamycin at 50 mg/liter or a combination of ticarcillin and clavulanate (Timentin; GlaxoSmithKline) at 25 mg/liter. For β-alanine starvation, β-alanine was added at a final concentration of 0.5 nm. For in vivo phosphopantetheinylation assays, β-[2,3-3H]alanine (specific activity, 60 Ci/mmol; American Radiolabeled Chemicals) was used at a final concentration of 0.5 mm. In Vivo Phosphopantetheinylation Analysis—The in vivo phosphopantetheinylation experiments were performed by a method similar to that described by De Lay and Cronan (1De Lay N.R. Cronan J.E. J.

Alternatively the experiments were performed using strain NRD44 derivatives that carry either a plasmid expressing Sfp or an empty vector in addition to a plasmid that encoded an ACP. The strains were first starved for β-alanine on minimal E-glycerol-clavulanate-ticarcillin agar plates containing a trace amount of β-alanine at 42 °C overnight. Each strain was then suspended in minimal E-glycerol-clavulanate-ticarcillin liquid medium to an A600 between 0.6 and 0.7. Arabinose and β-[3H]alanine were then added to the medium, and the cultures were incubated at 42 °C for 2 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, suspended in 50 mm sodium 2-(N-morpholin-o)ethanesulfonic acid (pH 6.1), and sonicated. Cell debris were removed by centrifugation, and the concentration of soluble protein was determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Equal amounts of protein from each cell extract were fractionated on a 20% native polyacrylamide gel at 120 V. Prior to fractionation, dithiothreitol was added to each sample at a final concentration of 100 mm. The polyacrylamide gel was fixed, soaked in enhancer solution (NRAMP100V, Ambion), dried, and then exposed to preflashed x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co. BIOmax XAR film) at –80 °C.

We investigated the functional role of these Cys residues in Na+ self-inhibition, an allosteric inhibition of ENaC activity by extracellular Na+. All 16 Cys residues within α and γ ECLs and selected β ECL Cys residues were individually mutated to alanine or serine residues. The Na+ self-inhibition response of wild type and mutant channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes was determined by whole cell voltage clamp. Individual mutation of eight α (Cys-1, -4, -5, -6, -7, -10, -13, or -16), one β (Cys-7), and nine γ (Cys-3, -4, -6, -7, -10, -11, -12, -13, or -16) residues significantly reduced the magnitude of Na+ self-inhibition. Na+ self-inhibition was eliminated by simultaneous mutations of either the last three α ECL Cys residues (Cys-14, -15, and -16) or Cys-7 within both α and γ ECLs. By analyzing the Na+ self-inhibition responses and the effects of a methanethiosulfonate reagent on channel currents in single and double Cys mutants, we identified five Cys pairs within the αECL (αCys-1/αCys-6, αCys-4/αCys-5, αCys-7/αCys-16, αCys-10/αCys-13, and αCys-11/αCys-12) and one pair within the γECL (γCys-7/γCys-16) that likely form intrasubunit disulfide bonds. We conclude that approximately half of the ECL Cys residues in the α and γ ENaC subunits are required to establish the tertiary structure that ensures a proper Na+ self-inhibition response, likely by formation of multiple intrasubunit disulfide bonds.

These pore-forming subunits have the same membrane topology as other two-transmem-brane domain channels such as inward rectifier K+ channels and purinergic P2X receptors. A distinguishing feature of ENaC subunits among these two-transmembrane domain channels is a large extracellular loop (ECL) consisting of about 450 residues of the total 600–700 amino acids. Recent studies have suggested a number of functional roles for the ECL, including channel trafficking, amiloride binding, regulation of gating, binding to transition metals, protease cleavage, and Na+ self-inhibition (5Sheng S.

We previously identified a histidine residue in the γECL (γHis-239) as a required structural element for Na+ self-inhibition of mouse ENaC (mENaC), because substitutions at this site eliminated the inhibitory response (5Sheng S. Bruns J.B. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9743-9749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, it is unlikely that γHis-239 is the sole participant in the allosteric inhibition by Na+, given its steep temperature dependence that implicates a large scale conformational change associated with the inhibition (4Chraibi A. Horisberger J.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 19Chraibi A. Horisberger J.D. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2003; 447: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Each ECL contains 16 conserved Cys residues that can be grouped into two cysteine-rich domains (CRD): CRD-I, including cysteines 1–6, and CRD-II, including cysteines 7–16 (see Fig. 1). Theoretically, these Cys residues could form intrasubunit or intersubunit disulfide bonds that normally facilitate proper folding in the endoplasmic reticulum and maintain structural integrity (20Hogg P.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 210-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Firsov et al. (14Firsov D. Robert-Nicoud M. Gruender S. Schild L. Rossier B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2743-2749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) investigated the roles of the ECL Cys residues by a systematic mutation of all 16 Cys residues in the rat αECL, as well as selected mutations of Cys residues in the βECL and γECL. The authors concluded that the Cys-1 and Cys-6 residues of CRD-I in all three subunits and the Cys-11 and Cys-12 of CRD-II in α and β (but not in γ) ECLs are required for efficient expression of ENaC at the plasma membrane. However, the authors also reported that individual mutation of six of ten CRD-II Cys residues significantly increased Na+ currents without a proportional change in the number of channels expressed at the cell surface (14Firsov D. Robert-Nicoud M. Gruender S. Schild L. Rossier B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2743-2749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), suggesting that these Cys mutations increase the single channel activity. It has been known for many years that specific extracellular sulfhydryl reagents activate ENaC currents by interfering with Na+ self-inhibition (4Chraibi A. Horisberger J.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 21Van Driessche W. Zeiske W. Physiol. Rev. 1985; 65: 833-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In addition, we recently demonstrated that thiophilic Zn2+ activates mouse αβγENaC by eliminating Na+ self-inhibition (22Sheng S. Perry C.J. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31687-31696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In the context of these findings, we hypothesized that that certain Cys residues in ENaC might be required for its Na+ self-inhibition response. We tested this hypothesis by mutating ECL Cys residues and comparing the Na+ self-inhibition response in oocytes expressing wild type (WT) or mutant ENaCs. Our results suggest that multiple Cys residues of both CRD-I and CRD-II in the α and γ subunits play significant roles in Na+ self-inhibition. Site-directed Mutagenesis and in Vitro Transcription— Mouse α, β, and γ ENaC cDNAs in pBluescript SK- vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) were used as templates to generate point mutations using a PCR-based method as previously described (23Sheng S. Li J. McNulty K.A. Avery D. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8572-8581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Each of the αECL Cys residues was mutated to a Ser or Ala, and γECL Cys residues were systematically mutated to Ala. Target mutations were confirmed by direct sequencing. For clarity, the Cys residues within the ECLs are identified in the text (Cys-1 to Cys-16) or figures (C-1 to C-16) with their sequential numbers. The complementary RNAs (cRNAs) for WT and mutant ENaC subunits were synthesized with T3 RNA polymerase (Ambion, Inc.), purified with an RNA purification kit (Ambion, Inc.), and quantitated by spectrophotometry and density analyses of the RNA band in a denaturing agarose gel. ENaC Expression and Two-electrode Voltage Clamp—ENaC expression in Xenopus oocytes and current measurements by two-electrode voltage clamp were performed as previously reported (23Sheng S. Li J. McNulty K.A. Avery D. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8572-8581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Defolliculated oocytes were injected with 1 ng of cRNA for each mENaC subunit (α, β, and γ) per oocyte and incubated at 18 °C in modified Barth's saline (88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 15 mm HEPES, 0.3 mm Ca (NO3)2, 0.41 mm CaCl2, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 10 μg/ml sodium penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, 100 μg/ml gentamycin sulfate, pH 7.4). All of the experiments were performed 20–50 h following cRNA injections at room temperature (20–24 °C). The oocytes were placed in an oocyte recording chamber from Warner Instruments (Hamden, CT) and perfused with constant flow rate of 12–15 ml/min. Procedures for Observing Na+ Self-inhibition—To examine Na+ self-inhibition, a low Na+ bath solution (NaCl-1; containing 1 mm NaCl, 109 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine, 2 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) was replaced rapidly by a high Na+ bath solution (NaCl-110; containing 110 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), while the oocytes were continuously clamped to–60 or–100 mV as indicated. Bath solution exchange was performed with a six-channel Teflon valve perfusion system from Warner Instruments. At the end of the experiment, 10 μm amiloride was added to the bath to determine the amiloride-insensitive component of the whole cell current. Currents remaining in the presence of 10 μm amiloride were generally less than 200 nA. The results from oocytes that showed unusually large amiloride-insensitive currents (> 5% of total currents) were discarded to minimize current contamination from endogenous channels and membrane leak. Given the well known variability of the Xenopus oocyte expression system and our initial observation that the Na+ self-inhibition responses of WT αβγ mENaCs varied moderately among different batches of oocytes, despite a very small variation in the response within the same batch of oocytes, the responses of WT channels were always examined with mutants in the same batch of oocytes in an alternating manner. The first 40 s of current decay was fit with an exponential equation by Clampfit 9.0 (Axon Instruments Inc.). The peak current (Ipeak) was the measured maximal inward current immediately after bath solution exchange from low Na+ to high Na+ concentration. The steady state current (Iss) represented the measured current at 40 s after Ipeak. The current ratio of Iss/Ipeak was calculated from amiloride-sensitive Iss and Ipeak obtained by subtracting amiloride-insensitive currents from Iss and Ipeak. Procedure for Observing the Effects of MTSET—The oocytes were clamped at –60 mV and perfused with the bath solution NaCl-110. After 1 min recording of the control current, the bath solution was replaced by one containing 1 mm 2-(trimethylammonium) ethyl methanethiosulfonate bromide (MTSET; Toronto Research Chemicals Inc.) for 2 or 3 min. The bath was then switched back to NaCl-110 to wash out MTSET for 1 min. Amiloride at 10 μm was added to the bath to determine amiloride-insensitive current. Because MTSET has a short life time in aqueous solution with pH 7.0 at 20 °C (11 min) (24Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar), the reagent was dissolved in the NaCl-110 no earlier than 1 min prior to use. The oocytes with unstable currents were not used for these experiments. Statistical Analysis—The data are presented as the means ± S.E. Significance comparisons between groups were performed with Student's t tests. A p value of less than 0.01 was considered statistically different, because responses within the same group showed very little variation, which could increase the probability of a false positive result. The 16 conserved ECL Cys residues that were mutated in this study are clustered in two cysteine-rich domains, CRD-I and CRD-II, which are separated by a stretch of less well conserved residues (Fig. 1). We examined the hypothesis that specific disulfide bonds formed by these extracellular Cys residues are required to generate or maintain the structures that determine the response of ENaC to extracellular Na+. The response of Na+ self-inhibi-tion was examined by clamping oocytes at –60 mV, whereas bath [Na+] was rapidly increased from 1 to 110 mm, as previously reported (5Sheng S. Bruns J.B. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9743-9749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). WT channels were always examined and compared with mutants in the same batch of oocytes. The time constants (τ) for the inhibition in WT oocytes were in the range of 6.0 ± 0.2 and 8.1 ± 0.4 s, whereas the Iss/Ipeak values varied in the range of 0.49 ± 0.02 and 0.66 ± 0.02 in 18 different batches of oocytes. The variability among different batches of oocytes was likely due, in part, to variability in the extent of proteolytic processing of ENaC subunits that regulate the Na+ self-inhibition response (6Sheng S.

Alterations of Na+ Self-inhibition by Mutations of αECL Cys Residues— All of the mENaCs with mutant α subunits expressed amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents sufficient to examine Na+ self-inhibition. The oocytes expressing ENaCs with eight different α mutants showed a Na+-dependent current decay that was significantly smaller in magnitude (greater Iss/Ipeak) than for cells expressing WT ENaC, indicating a reduced Na+ self-inhibition response (Figs. 2 and 3). These mutations were located in both CRD-I (αCys-1, -4, -5, and -6) and CRD-II (αCys-7, -10, -13, and -16) of the ECL (Fig. 1). An increased Iss/Ipeak was typically accompanied by an increased time constant, except for ENaCs with mutated αCys-5 and αCys-13 (Figs. 2 and 3). Among the eight mutants with increased Iss/Ipeak, αCys-7 and αCys-16 showed the greatest reduction in the magnitude and speed of Na+ self-inhibi-tion. An enhanced Na+ self-inhibition (reduced Iss/Ipeak) was only observed with αC458Aβγ (αCys-11). Although mutation of αCys-14 or αCys-15 alone did not significantly alter Na+ self-in-hibition, a triple mutation of αCys-14, αCys-15, and αCys-16 (αC498A-C502A-C506A) eliminated the response with an Iss/Ipeak of 0.96 ± 0.00 (n = 10) (Fig. 2).FIGURE 3Effects of mutations of individual αECL Cys residues on Na+ self-inhibition. Wild type β and γ ENaC subunits were co-expressed with either WT or a mutant α subunit. The Na+ self-inhibition responses in oocytes expressing WT or mutant channels were examined at a clamping voltage of –60 mV. The time constants and Iss/Ipeak values were obtained as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data were collected in different batches of oocytes. The WT (αβγ) values represent 108 observations pooled from 17 batches of oocytes, whereas mutant data are from 6–9 oocytes. Student's t tests were performed in the same batch of oocytes to compare the responses of Na+ self-inhibition of WT and an individual mutant. The values that are significantly different from that of WT (p < 0.01) are shown as black bars.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Alterations of ENaC Na+ Self-inhibition by Mutations of γECL Cys Residues—All of the mENaCs with mutant γ subunits were functional following cRNA injections in oocytes. Nine γ mutants showed a significantly reduced and slowed Na+ self-inhibition response (Figs. 4 and 5). Mutation of γCys-7 produced the greatest effect. Interestingly, six ENaCs with a mutant γ subunit, including γCys-4 (C266A), γCys-6 (C289A), γCys-7 (C378A), γCys-10 (C413A), γCys-13 (C440A), and γCys-16 (C463A) showed qualitatively similar changes to ENaCs with the corresponding mutations in α (Figs. 3 and 5). However, unlike the α mutants, mutation of γCys-3 (C220S) and γCys-12 (C429A) blunted Na+ self-inhibition, whereas mutation of γCys-1 (C100A) and γCys-5 (C273A) did not change the response. In addition, mutation of γCys-11 (C415A) reduced the Na+ self-inhibition response, an effect opposite to that observed with mutation of αCys-11.FIGURE 5Effects of mutations of individual γECL Cys residues on Na+ self-inhibition. Wild type α and β ENaC subunits were co-expressed with either WT or a mutant γ subunit. The Na+ self-inhibition responses in oocytes expressing WT and mutant αβγ mENaCs were examined at a clamping voltage of –60 mV. The data were collected in different batches of oocytes. The WT (αβγ) values represent 108 observations pooled from 17 batches of oocytes, whereas the mutant data are from 5–13 oocytes. Student's t tests were performed in the same batch of oocytes to compare the responses of Na+ self-inhibition of WT and a mutant. Black bars indicate that the values are significantly different from that of WT (p < 0.01).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Effects of Mutations of βECL Cys Residues on Na+ Self-inhibition—Although all three ENaC subunits contribute to pore formation, mutations at corresponding sites of different subunits often result in nonidentical changes, suggestive of asymmetric roles for the subunits (26Kellenberger S. Schild L. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 735-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar, 27Li J. Sheng S. Perry C.J. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13867-13874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A previous study suggested that γENaC and αENaC subunits play larger roles in the Na+ self-inhibition response than does βENaC (5Sheng S. Bruns J.B. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9743-9749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We examined Na+ self-inhibition of selected β mutants including βCys-3, -4, -7, and -16, whose corresponding mutations in α and/or γ significantly reduced the Na+ self-inhibition response. As shown in Fig. 6, only mutation of βCys-7 (βC359A) moderately reduced the magnitude and speed of Na+ self-inhibition. Our results indicate that ECL Cys-7 in all three subunits (αCys-421, βCys-359, and γCys-378) is particularly sensitive to point mutations with regard to the Na+ self-inhibition response, suggestive of a critical role for these Cys residues. Probing Disulfide Bond-forming Cys Pairs by Functional Additivity—One possible reason for the reduced Na+ self-inhi-bition response in the ENaCs with selected Cys mutations is a disruption of disulfide bonds that are required to stabilize the ECL structure pertinent to the mechanism of the Na+ inhibition. Firsov et al. (14Firsov D. Robert-Nicoud M. Gruender S. Schild L. Rossier B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2743-2749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) suggested that αCys-1 and αCys-6 in CRD-I as well as αCys-11 and αCys-12 in CRD-II form disulfide bonds, based on a comparison of changes in ENaC currents in oocytes expressing subunits with single or double Cys mutations. Using a similar approach, we tested whether those Cys residues whose substitutions significantly suppressed Na+ self-inhibition represented disulfide-linked residues by construction of double Cys mutants in the α or γ subunits. We reasoned that if a pair of Cys residues forms a disulfide bond that has a role in the Na+ self-inhibition response, mutation of either one or both Cys residues should result in a similar, but not additive change in the Na+ self-inhibition response. On the other hand, if two Cys residues do not form a disulfide bond, the change in Na+ self-inhibition response should be largely additive, resulting from their independent influence on Na+ self-inhibition. Therefore, we analyzed the relative changes of Iss/Ipeak (ΔIss/Ipeak, mutant Iss/Ipeak minus WT Iss/Ipeak) in mENaCs with single or double Cys mutations. As shown in Fig. 7A, the double mutation of αCys-1 and αCys-6 (αC-1/αC-6) resulted in a value of ΔIss/Ipeak (black bar) that was no more than those caused by either αCys-1 or αCys-6 single mutation but was much less than the value for an additive effect (αC-1 + αC-6, gray bar) that was predicted assuming independence of the two Cys residues (i.e. no disulfide bond). Because we observed a similar reduction in ENaC Na+ self-inhibition with either the αCys-1 or αCys-6 single mutation, which was not additive in the double mutant, these data are consistent with the presence of a disulfide bond between αCys-1 and αCys-6, in accordance with previous findings (14Firsov D. Robert-Nicoud M. Gruender S. Schild L. Rossier B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2743-2749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Similarly, the Na+ self-inhibition response of mENaCs with double mutations at αCys-4/αCys-5, αC7/αCys-16, and αCys-10/αCys-13, showed nonadditive effects compared with ENaC with the corresponding single mutations (Fig. 7, B–D), consistent with the presence of disulfide bonds between these three pairs of Cys residues. In contrast, mENaCs with the αCys-4/αCys-16, αCys-5/αCys-16, and αC13/αCys-16 double Cys mutations displayed additive effects (Fig. 7, E–G), inconsistent with disulfide bonds between αCys-4 and αCys-16, αCys-5 and αCys-16, and αCys-13 and αCys-16, respectively. Our observation that ENaC with the αCys-11 mutation enhanced Na+ inhibition, whereas αCys-12 mutation did not change the response is not consistent with a disulfide bond between the two Cys residues. However, ENaCs with the double mutation αCys-11/αCys-12 behaved like channels with αCys-12 single mutation (Fig. 7H), suggesting interactions between these two Cys residues. Similar analyses of ENaCs with γCys-7/γCys-16 and γCys-4/γCys-16 double Cys mutations revealed an additive effect for ENaC with γCys-4/γCys-16 and nonadditive effect for ENaC with γCys-7/γCys-16. These data are consistent with a disulfide bond between γCys-7 and γCys-16, similar to that proposed between αCys-7 and αCys-16 (Fig. 8).FIGURE 8Effects of double Cys mutations within γECL. The responses of Na+ self-inhibition in oocytes co-expressing a mutant γ subunit containing either single or double Cys mutations and WT α and β subunits were compared as described in the legend to Fig. 7. The bars have the same meaning as in Fig. 7. The numbers of observations are indicated in parentheses. An asterisk indicates p < 0.01 between single Cys mutant and double Cys mutant.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It is unknown whether the functional ENaC complex formed by heterologous αβγ subunits contains intersubunit disulfide bonds. The observed changes in Na+ self-inhibition resulting from substitution of ECL Cys residues could also result from a disruption of intersubunit as well as intrasubunit disulfide bonds, given the observation of significant reduction in Na+ self-inhibition by multiple α and γ mutations. As an initial test for the existence of intersubunit disulfide bonds, we examined the Na+ self-inhibition response of ENaCs expressing two different mutant subunits containing homologous Cys mutations of Cys-4, Cys-7, Cys-13, or Cys-16 and a WT subunit. ENaCs with homologous Cys mutations in α and γ (Fig. 9, A–D), α and β (C-7; Fig. 9B), or β and γ (C-7; Fig. 9B) showed clear additive effects in their suppression of self-inhibition with exception of αCys-7/γCys-7. The results do not support formation of intersubunit disulfide bonds between these Cys residue pairs and are in line with formation of intrasubunit bridges suggested above. Mutations of both αCys-7 and γCys-7 eliminated the Na+ self-inhibition response (Iss/Ipeak = 0.99 ± 0.00, n = 8). The ΔIss/Ipeak from the double mutations was significantly greater than that of either single mutation (p < 0.01). However, it did not reach the predicted change in Na+ self-inhibition, assuming an additive effect of these two mutations. This was due to an apparent “ceiling effect” that prevented the ΔIss/Ipeak from going beyond a value of 0.41 (1–Iss/Ipeak of WT = 0.59 ± 0.02, n ="
https://openalex.org/W2041993831,"In the visual system, early atomized representations are grouped into higher-level entities through processes of perceptual organization. Here we present neurophysiological evidence that a representation of a simple object, a surface defined by color and motion, can be the unit of attentional selection at an early stage of visual processing. Monkeys were cued by the color of a fixation spot to attend to one of two transparent random-dot surfaces, one red and one green, which occupied the same region of space. Motion of the attended surface drove neurons in the middle temporal (MT) visual area more strongly than physically identical motion of the non-attended surface, even though both occurred within the spotlight of attention. Surface-based effects of attention persisted even without differential surface coloring, but attentional modulation was stronger with color. These results show that attention can select surface representations to modulate visual processing as early as cortical area MT."
https://openalex.org/W1968251266,"The coordination of gene expression is critical for cell differentiation and the subsequent establishment of tissue function. We show here that a multiple zinc finger transcription factor, Zfp423/OAZ, is transiently expressed in newly differentiating olfactory-receptor neurons (ORNs) and has a key role in coordinating the expression of immature and mature stage-specific genes. OAZ deletion in mice impairs aspects of ORN differentiation, particularly the patterns of axonal projection to the olfactory bulb. OAZ gain-of-function experiments show that sustained OAZ expression throughout ORN maturation arrests ORN development at an immature stage and alters OR gene expression. Importantly, reintroducing OAZ expression in mature ORNs suppresses mature marker expression and reactivates immature-specific markers. Together, these experiments suggest that OAZ participates in a developmental switch regulating the transition from differentiation to maturation in ORNs."

Fatty acids subserve a large number of specialized cellular functions including cholesterol esterification, production of lung surfactant, mammary gland secretions, and signaling molecules. Fatty acids are also fundamental components of all biological membranes and the primary biochemical form of energy storage. Despite being a multistep enzymatic process, basic fatty acid biosynthesis in higher eukaryotes is accomplished through the catalytic activities of only two gene products, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) 3The abbreviations used are: ACC, acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase; FAS, fatty acid synthase; LXR, liver X receptor; TR, thyroid hormone receptor; RXR, retinoid X receptor; SHP, small heterodimer partner; LRH, liver receptor homologue; SREBP, sterol regulatory element-binding protein; CETP, cholesterol ester transfer protein; Q-PCR, quantitative PCR; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; siRNA, small interfering RNA; CMV, cytomegalovirus; CMX, cytomegalovirus X. and fatty acid synthase (FAS). ACC catalyzes the first step in which condensation of two acetyl-CoA molecules forms malonyl-CoA; FAS then catalyzes the remaining steps required to produce the fully saturated 16-carbon fatty acid palmitate. Although ACC is generally considered the rate-limiting enzyme in the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway, in mammals FAS appears to be independently regulated at the transcription level by a large number of nutritional, hormonal, and cellular signals, including insulin (1Wilson S.B.

This DR-4 was identified in a region of the FAS promoter that was also shown to be required for TR regulation (13Xiong S. Chirala S.S. Hsu M.H. Wakil S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12260-12265Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). On further analysis of the FAS promoter, we identified an additional nuclear receptor half-site 21 bases downstream of the DR-4 element (Fig. 1). The region surrounding this putative nuclear receptor site did not suggest the existence of an additional DR-4-type element. However, because of its proximity to the DR-4, we hypothesized that it might play a role in the activation of FAS by either LXR or TR. In the study reported here, we show that the additional half-site binds the orphan nuclear receptor liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1)/fetoprotein transcription factor and that LRH-1 binding to this site specifically augments the LXR response. In contrast, LRH-1 has no effect on thyroid hormone activation of FAS. Cell Culture—HepG2 human hepatoma cells were obtained from ATCC, cultured in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) with penicillin/streptomycin (100 μg/ml), l-glutamine (2 mm), nonessential amino acids (100 μm), sodium pyruvate (1 mm), 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, and 10% fetal bovine serum, and maintained at 5% CO2. One day before transfection, cells were plated at a density of 3.5 × 105 cells/well in a 6-well plate in 3 ml of normal culture medium. HEK293T human embryonic kidney cells were obtained from ATCC, cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium high glucose (Irvine Scientific) with penicillin/streptomycin (100 μg/ml), l-glutamine (10 mm), nonessential amino acids (100 μm), 5 mm Hepes pH 7.2, and 10% fetal bovine serum, and maintained at 5% CO2. One day before transfection, cells were plated at a density of 3.5 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates with 3 ml of normal culture medium. Transient DNA Transfections—12–24 h after plating, cells were transfected by the standard calcium phosphate method as described previously (18Yieh L. Sanchez H.B. Osborne T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6102-6106Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Where indicated, expression vectors for CMX-LXRα (0.1 μg/well), CMX-RXRα (0.1 μg/well), CMX-TRβ (0.4 μg/well), pCI-LRH-1 (0.1–0.5 μg/well), or CMX-SHP (50 ng/well) plus individual luciferase reporters (1 μg/well) and control CMV-β-galactosidase (1 μg/well) were used. 6–8 h post-transfection, cells were glycerol-shocked for 2 min and then washed 3 times with sterile phosphate-buffered saline. Medium was replaced with defined serum-free medium (Dulbecco's minimum essential medium, penicillin/streptomycin (100 μg/ml), l-glutamine (2 mm), nonessential amino acids (100 μm), 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, insulin/transferrin/selenite (5 μg/ml; 5 μg/ml; 5 ng/ml) (Sigma), 4% bovine serum albumin (Sigma, A-3803), and 25-hydroxycholesterol (0.1 μg/ml)) plus one or more of the following: dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) (0.1%) as a vehicle control, GW3965 (1 μm), LG268 (100 nm), 22-R-hydroxycholesterol (2.5 μg/ml), T0901317 (1 μm), or T3 (100 nm or 1 μm). Cells were allowed to incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for an additional 36–48 h before harvesting. Plasmids—The FAS-700/+65 pGL2 luciferase reporter construct was subcloned by PCR from the rat FAS-1594/+65 pGL2 and the FAS-700/+65 MUT1 have been described previously (5Bennett M.K. Lopez J.M.

All other FAS mutant reporter constructs were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) by replacing the individual half-site sequences with an equal number of adenosine residues. The remaining reporter constructs were generated by PCR amplification and subcloning. pSynTATALuc is a reporter vector containing a minimal promoter region of the hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase promoter (–28/+39) and has been described previously (19Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1161-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The SREBP-1c promoter used here contains a sequence from –937/+29 fused to the luciferase coding sequence in pGL2 basic. The following expression vectors were provided by other laboratories: CMX-hTRβ (Barry Forman), CMX-mLXRα (Peter Tontonoz), CMX-hRXRα (Ron Evans and Bruce Blumberg), pCI-LRH-1 (Gregorio Gil), CMX-SHP (David Mangelsdorf). Enzyme Assays—At the time of harvest cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in a reporter lysis buffer (25 mm Gly-Gly, 15 mm MgSO4, 4 mm EGTA, 0.25% Triton). Luciferase activity of the lysates was measured in an Analytical Luminescence MonoLight 2010 luminometer using 20–40 μl of cell extract plus 100 μl of luciferase assay reagent (Promega) and expressed in relative light units. β-Galactosidase activity was measured by a standard colorimetric assay at 420 nm absorbance using 50–100 μl of cell lysate and 2-nitrophenyl β-galactopyranoside as the substrate. Luciferase activity for each sample was divided by the β-galactosidase activity to yield normalized relative light units. -Fold activation was determined by dividing the normalized relative light units for a given sample by the normalized relative light units for the control sample (no activators plus Me2SO). Each transfection was performed at least twice with similar results. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—In vitro transcribed and translated LXRα and RXRα proteins were generated using the T7 TnT rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega). One or two microliters of each translation were added to each binding mixture (containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 μg/μl poly(dI:dC), 0.05% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol) in a final volume of 20 μl. For an electrophoretic mobility shift assay using GST-LRH-1, 20 ng of purified bacterially expressed GST-LRH-1 were added per reaction. A 57-base double-stranded oligo containing the wild type sequence of the three nuclear receptor half-sites was 5′ end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and added to the binding mixtures (1–2 ng/reaction). Binding mixtures were incubated at 4 °C for 1–2 h. Samples were then run on 5% polyacrylamide:bisacrylamide (19:1) gels at room temperature for 1.5 h, fixed in a solution of 10% methanol, 10% acetic acid, and dried onto Whatman No. 3MM chromatography paper at 80 °C for 1 h. Dried gels were exposed to x-ray film for 12–48 h. DNA sequences (one strand from 5′-3′ only) were as follows; note that mutant bases are underlined. DNA sequences at all three half-sites were: wild type, KM 42, CTAGCACGATGACCGGTAGTAACCCCGCCTGAGGCGCCCTCCGCCAGGGTCAACGAC; mut 1, KM 44, CTAGCACGAAAAAAGGTAGTAACCCCGCCTGAGGCGCCCTCCGCCAGGGTCAACGAC; mut 2, KM 46, CTAGCACGATGACCGGTAG AAAAACCGCCTGAGGCGCCCTCCGCCAGGGTCAACGAC; mut 3, KM 48, CTAGCACGATGACCGGTAGTAACCCCGCCTGAGGCGCCCTCCGCCAAAAAAAACGAC; mut 1/2, KM 58, CTAGCACGAAAAAAGGTAGAAAAACCGCCTGAGGCGCCCTCCGCCAGGGTCAACGAC; mut 1/3, KM 56, CTAGCACGA AAAAAGGTAGTAACCCCGCCTGAGGCGCCCTCCGCCAAAAAAAACGAC; mut 2/3, KM 54, CTAGCACGATGACCGGTAG AAAAACCGCCTGAGGCGCCCTCCGCCAAAAAAAACGAC; Triple Mut, KM 70, CTAGCACGAAAAAAGGTAGAAAAACCGCCTGAGGCGCCCTCCGCCAAAAAAAACGAC.

Animal Studies—SHP knock-out mice described previously (20Wang L. Lee Y.K. Bundman D. Han Y. Thevananther S. Kim C.S. Chua S.S. Wei P. Heyman R.A. Karin M. Moore D.D. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 721-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) and wild type C57B1/129sv mice were maintained on a normal chow diet. Adult animals were sacrificed, and liver RNA was extracted and analyzed for FAS expression by Q-PCR as described (21Wang L. Han Y. Kim C.S. Lee Y.K. Moore D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44475-44481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—B6/129 mice (6-week-old male) were purchased from Taconic and allowed to adapt for 2 weeks to a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle and sacrificed at the end of the dark cycle (8 a.m.). Livers from 4 mice were combined and placed in 40 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1.4 μg/ml pepstatin, and 2 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) plus 1 mm EDTA and 1 mm EGTA. The tissue was disrupted in a Tekmar Tissumizer at the lowest setting. Formaldehyde was added from a 37% stock (v/v) to a final concentration of 1%, and samples were rotated on a shaker for 6 min followed by the addition of glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 m. Samples were returned to the shaker for an additional 5 min, and then cells were collected by centrifugation (2000 rpm in Sorvall RC3B) at 4 °C. The cell pellet was washed once with homogenization buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6), 25 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 2 m sucrose, 10% glycerol, 0.15 mm spermine, plus protease inhibitors as above. The final pellet was resuspended in buffer A and homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer with a B pestle to release nuclei. The solution was layered over buffer A and centrifuged in a Beckman ultracentrifuge (1 h at 26,000 rpm, 4 °C), and the nuclear pellet was resuspended in nuclei lysis buffer (1% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 10 mm EDTA). Nuclei were disrupted using an Ultrasonic model W-220F sonicator for 5 × 10 s to shear chromatin. Chromatin size was checked by agarose electrophoresis to ensure that the average size was between 200 and 500 bp. Aliquots were used in immunoprecipitation experiments with an antibody to LRH-1 (Santa Cruz; sc25389X) and processed for the rest of the chromatin immunoprecipitation protocol as described (22Bennett M. Toth J.I. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37360-37367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 23Matsukuma K.E. Bennett M.K. Huang J. Wang L. Gil G. Osborne T.F. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 2754-2761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Final DNA samples were analyzed by quantitative PCR in triplicate with a standard dilution curve of the input DNA performed in parallel. Oligo pairs for the FAS LRH-1 binding region or exon 4 from the YY1 gene used in the Q-PCR are as follows: FAS-700 (5′), ATCCTGGTCTCCAAGGTG; FAS-534 (3′), TAGGCAATAGGGTGATGGG; YY1, (5′) TCTGACGAGAGGATTGTGTGGAC; YY1, (3′) CTGAAGGGCTTTTCTCCAGTATG. LRH-1 Knockdown—HepG2 cells were plated in triplicate at 150,000 cells/well in 24-well plates in normal medium. 1–4 h after plating cells were transfected with either 5 nm siRNA molecule specific for LRH-1 (Qiagen HP GenomeWide siRNA catalog SI00056406) or a negative control siRNA sequence (Allstars negative control siRNA) using the HiPerfect transfection reagent (Qiagen). Twenty-four hours after the first transfection, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and transfected a second time in medium containing defined serum-free medium plus T0901317 (1 μm)or Me2SO (0.1%). After an additional 24 h, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and then harvested for RNA using Trizol reagent. An equal amount of RNA (0.6–1.0 μg) from each sample was used to prepare cDNAs for quantitative PCR. One microliter of each cDNA synthesis reaction was used as template for Q-PCR using the Bio-Rad iQ5 icycler and the SYBR green fluorophore. Each PCR was run in duplicate. Expression of LRH-1 and FAS was determined, and expression of each gene was normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase expression in each PCR run. PCR oligos for FAS, LRH-1, LXRα, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase are as follows: human (hu) FAS, (5′), AACTCCAAGGACACAGTCACCAT; hu FAS (3′), CAGCTGCTCCACGAACTCAA; hu LRH-1 (5′), CTGATACTGGAACTTTTGAA; hu LRH-1 (3′), CTTCATTTGGTCATCAACCTT; hu LXRα (5′), GGAGGTACAACCCTGGGAGT; hu LXRα (3′), AGCAATGAGCAAGGCAAACT; hu glyceral-dehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (5′), GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTC; hu glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (3′), GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC. In our analysis of the FAS promoter, we noted a highly conserved sequence 21 bases downstream of the RXR/LXR response element bearing a strong resemblance to other nuclear receptor half-sites (Fig. 1). To determine whether this sequence played a role in the FAS LXR response, we first compared LXR activation of the wild type FAS promoter to LXR activation of similar reporter constructs containing mutations in each of the three half-sites (Fig. 2A). As expected, mutations of either half-site 1 or 2 (comprising the known LXR DR-4 element) resulted in a significant decrease in LXR activation. Surprisingly, however, mutation of the third half-site alone also resulted in a substantial defect in LXR activation, suggesting that the third half-site played an important and previously unappreciated role in LXR activation of FAS. Furthermore, mutation of all three half-sites simultaneously resulted in the most significant defect. Even with all three sites mutated there was still a 6-fold activation by LXR/RXR. This residual activity is due to LXR induction of SREBP-1c, which subsequently activates the FAS promoter through binding to sites in the proximal promoter (6Joseph S.B. Laffitte B.A. Patel P.H. Watson M.A. Matsukuma K.E. Walczak R. Collins J.L. Osborne T.F. Tontonoz P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11019-11025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). To better understand the mechanism through which the third half-site exerts its effect on LXR activation of FAS, we examined binding of in vitro translated RXRα and LXRα proteins to a 32P-labeled DNA probe containing all three nuclear receptor half-sites (Fig. 2B). The addition of both RXRα and LXRα proteins resulted in a single band (lane 1) that migrated in parallel with a known RXRα/LXRα heterodimer on a consensus DR-4. The addition of a 200-fold excess of unlabeled wild type competitor DNA effectively competed for RXRα/LXRα heterodimer binding (lane 2); however, competitor DNAs containing mutations in the first and/or second half-sites (lanes 3, 4, 6–9) were unable to compete significantly for heterodimer binding. In contrast, competitor DNA containing a mutation in the third half-site alone effectively competed for RXRα/LXRα heterodimer binding (lane 5). Thus, the third half-site did not play a significant role in RXRα/LXRα binding to this region of the promoter despite being an important determinant of the FAS LXR response. Two other known LXR target genes, murine CYP7A1 (24Lu T.T. Makishima M. Repa J.J. Schoonjans K. Kerr T.A. Auwerx J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 507-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar) and human CETP (25Luo Y. Liang C.P. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24767-24773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), require binding of the monomeric nuclear receptor LRH-1 (also known as fetoprotein transcription factor and CYP7A1 promoter binding factor) at a site proximal the LXR element, for efficient LXR activation. To determine whether LRH-1 could bind to the FAS third half-site and potentiate the LXR response of the FAS gene, we first assessed binding of recombinant LRH-1 protein to the FAS third half-site by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (Fig. 3A). Incubation of 20 ng of GST-LRH-1 with the labeled third half-site resulted in a single shifted band (lane 2) that migrated in parallel with GST-LRH-1 bound to a known LRH-1 binding site from the CYP8B1 promoter (lane 10). The addition of a 50- and 200-fold excess of unlabeled competitor DNA containing the wild type third half-site sequence effectively competed for GST-LRH-1 binding to the FAS half-site in a dose-dependent manner (lanes 3 and 4) as did competitor DNA containing the LRH-1 binding site from the CYP8B1 promoter (lanes 7 and 8). In contrast, the addition of competitor DNA containing a mutation in the third half-site did not compete for LRH-1 binding (lanes 5 and 6). We next investigated direct binding of LRH-1 to the endogenous FAS promoter by chromatin immunoprecipitation in normal mouse liver using an antibody to LRH-1 and oligonucleotides that amplify the relevant region of the FAS promoter (Fig. 3B). Here, there was significant enrichment of the FAS promoter by the LRH-1 antibody relative to an IgG control, and this effect was specific as there was no enrichment of DNA from the YY1 locus analyzed in parallel. To determine whether LRH-1 might activate the FAS promoter and augment the LXR response, we turned to HEK293T cells because HepG2 cells contain a significant level of endogenous LRH-1. To eliminate any indirect effects mediated through LXR activation of SREBP-1c (an LXR target gene and direct activator of FAS) (Fig. 2 and Refs. 5Bennett M.K. Lopez J.M. Sanchez H.B. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25578-25583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar and 6Joseph S.B. Laffitte B.A. Patel P.H. Watson M.A. Matsukuma K.E. Walczak R. Collins J.L. Osborne T.F. Tontonoz P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11019-11025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar), a truncated wild type FAS promoter construct was constructed that contained the three nuclear receptor half-sites but lacked the downstream SREBP recognition motifs (FAS-700/-574) fused to a minimal TATA box containing promoter. This was transfected into HEK293T human embryonic kidney cells with an expression vector for LRH-1 along with the FAS promoter construct containing the three nuclear receptor half-sites (Fig. 4A). Because the RXR/LXR heterodimer is permissive and, thus, can be activated simultaneously by an RXR ligand and an LXR ligand (26Willy P.J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), we compared activation of the FAS promoter by a synthetic RXR agonist (LG268), an oxysterol known to activate LXR (22-R-hydroxycholesterol) or both in combination. In the absence of transfected LRH-1, the addition of each ligand or the combination of both resulted in 2–5-fold increases in FAS activation, as is consistent with the FAS being an RXR/LXR target gene. In the presence of transfected LRH-1, however, this modest response increased to 20.5-fold, whereas LXR ligands or LRH-1 alone activated FAS 4.4- and 2.9-fold, respectively. Furthermore, the effect of LRH-1 on the LXR response was specific to FAS, as no such effect was noted on a control promoter construct analyzed in parallel. To better understand the contribution of each half-site to the LRH-1 potentiation effect, we used mutant versions of this FAS reporter construct containing either a double mutation of both halves of the DR-4 or a mutation in the putative LRH-1 (third) half-site (Fig. 4B). As in the previous experiment, LXR activation of the corresponding wild type FAS promoter was dramatically increased in the presence of LRH-1. Furthermore, the addition of an expression vector for SHP, a novel non-DNA binding nuclear receptor known to be a potent inhibitor of LRH-1 activity in other promoters, significantly blunted this response. The FAS promoter construct containing a mutation in the DR-4 (MUT1/2) was defective for RXR/LXR signaling irrespective of the presence of LRH-1. Importantly, the magnitude of activation by LRH-1 alone on this mutant construct was similar to that seen on the wild type promoter, demonstrating an intact LRH-1 response. Activation of the promoter construct containing a mutation in the third half-site (MUT 3) by RXR/LXR alone was comparable with that seen on the wild type construct; however, activation by LRH-1 alone was lost as was the concerted activation by both LXR and LRH-1. The residual inhibitory effect of SHP in the absence of the LRH-1 site was likely due to its known ability to inhibit LXR activation (27Brendel C. Schoonjans K. Botrugno O.A. Treuter E. Auwerx J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2065-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Thus, SHP likely inhibits FAS gene expression through interactions with both LRH-1 and LXR. We next used an siRNA approach to evaluate the effects of specifically reducing endogenous LRH-1 expression on the LXR-mediated induction of FAS in HepG2 cells (Fig. 5A). We used HepG2 cells because an siRNA approach has been used previously to silence LRH-1 gene expression (28Venteclef N. Smith J.C. Goodwin B. Delerive P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 6799-6807Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The siRNA specifically reduced endogenous LRH-1 mRNA by 30–50%, which resulted in a significant blunting of the response of FAS to LXR activation. To rule out off-target effects of the siRNA, we also measured mRNA expression of LXRα in these cells. As expected, the addition of the siRNA did not decrease LXRα levels. Although LRH-1 knock-out mice die early in embryogenesis and are, thus, unavailable for study (29Pare J.F. Malenfant D. Courtemanche C. Jacob-Wagner M. Roy S. Allard D. Belanger L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21206-21216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), SHP knock-out mice are viable (20Wang L. Lee Y.K. Bundman D. Han Y. Thevananther S. Kim C.S.

Given that SHP is a potent inhibitor of LRH-1 (24Lu T.T. Makishima M. Repa J.J. Schoonjans K. Kerr T.A. Auwerx J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Mol.

Cell. 2000; 6: 517-526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1513) Google Scholar), it follows that if FAS is indeed an LRH-1 target gene, FAS mRNA expression would be elevated in SHP knock-out mice. Consistent with this hypothesis, our animal studies showed that FAS mRNA expression in SHP knockout mice was 6.8-fold higher than in matched wild type controls (Fig. 5B). In a previous report LRH-1 was shown to augment the LXR response of SREBP-1c (43Watanabe M. Houten S.M. Wang L. Moschetta A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Heyman R.A. Moore D.D. Auwerx J. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 1408-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar).

This phenotype of cholesterol overload is consistent with the observed 45% reduction in low density lipoprotein receptor and 2.5-fold increase in ABCA1 levels. However, cholesterol mass in CETP-deficient adipocytes was actually reduced. Strikingly, CETP-deficient adipocytes stored <50% of normal TG, principally reflecting reduced synthesis. The hydrolysis of cellular CE and TG in CETP-deficient cells was reduced by >50%, although hydrolase/lipase activity was increased 3-fold. Notably, the incorporation of recently synthesized CE and TG into lipid storage droplets in CETP-deficient cells was just 40% of control, suggesting that these lipids are inefficiently transported to droplets where the hydrolase/lipase resides. The capacity of cellular CETP to transport CE and TG into storage droplets was directly demonstrated in vitro. Overall, chronic CETP deficiency disrupts lipid homeostasis and compromises the TG storage function of adipocytes. Inefficient CETP-mediated translocation of CE and TG from the endoplasmic reticulum to their site of storage may partially explain these defects. These studies in adipocytic cells strongly support a novel role for CETP in intracellular lipid transport and storage. Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) transfers cholesteryl ester (CE) and triglyceride (TG) between lipoproteins in plasma. However, short term suppression of CETP biosynthesis in cells alters cellular cholesterol homeostasis, demonstrating an intracellular role for CETP as well. The consequences of chronic CETP deficiency in lipid-storing cells normally expressing CETP have not been reported.

Chem. 1988; 263: 5020-5023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CETP is a member of the lipid transfer/lipopolysaccharide-binding protein gene family that is composed of highly hydrophobic proteins involved in lipid binding and transport (5Bruce C. Chouinard Jr., R.A. Tall A.R. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1998; 18: 297-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 6Bruce C. Beamer L.J. Tall A.R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 426-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Two CETP transcripts exist, a 1.6-kb transcript produced from the full-length, 16-exon CETP gene and a 1.4-kb transcript lacking exon 9 (180 nucleotides) derived by alternative splicing (7Inazu A. Quinet E.M. Wang S. Brown M.L. Stevenson S. Barr M.L. Moulin P. Tall A.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2352-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). mRNAs for both variants are present in all human tissues expressing CETP. When compared with the full-length form, which accounts for essentially all plasma CETP, exon 9-deleted CETP is poorly secreted, and its function is unknown (7Inazu A. Quinet E.M. Wang S. Brown M.L.

Exon 9-deleted CETP retains the amino acids that constitute the binding sites for TG and CE (residues 470–475) (9Wang S. Deng L. Milne R.W. Tall A.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 12603-12609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and may lead to a variant with different substrate preference or affinity. In addition to its abundant hepatic expression, CETP is synthesized by many tissues, such as adipose, adrenal (7Inazu A. Quinet E.M. Wang S. Brown M.L. Stevenson S. Barr M.L. Moulin P. Tall A.R.

Both forms of CETP are readily detected in tissue homogenates (7Inazu A. Quinet E.M. Wang S. Brown M.L. Stevenson S. Barr M.L. Moulin P. Tall A.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2352-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 8Yang T.P. Agellon L.B. Walsh A. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12603-12609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), indicating that even the well secreted full-length form of CETP can accumulate intracellularly. CETP has broad specificity for membrane surfaces and can transfer lipids from native lipoproteins, from liposomes, and between membranes (18Morton R.E. Experientia (Basel). 1990; 46: 552-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 19Hashimoto S. Morton R.E. Zilversmit D.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 120: 586-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). It appears that the only essential substrate requirement for CETP activity is a phospholipid surface (20Pattnaik N.M. Zilversmit D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2782-2786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is growing evidence that CETP has intracellular functions as well. For example, the selective uptake of CE from HDL into adipocyte cells is mediated by CETP produced and associated with these cells (21Benoist F. Lau P. McDonnell M. Doelle H. Milne R. McPherson R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23572-23577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and adenovirus-mediated CETP expression in mouse hepatocytes directly mediates CE selective uptake from HDL (22Gauthier A. Lau P. Zha X. Milne R. McPherson R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2005; 25: 2177-2184Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Transient expression of recombinant CETP in COS-7 cells stimulates their ability to efflux cholesterol to HDL by a process that is not inhibited by extracellular anti-CETP antibody or stimulated by the addition of CETP to the culture media (17Zhang Z. Yamashita S. Hirano K. Nakagawa-Toyama Y. Matsuyama A. Nishida M. Sakai N. Fukasawa M. Arai H. Miyagawa J. Matsuzawa Y. Atherosclerosis. 2001; 159: 67-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Also, acute suppression of CETP biosynthesis in HepG2 cells alters multiple aspects of reverse cholesterol transport (23Sawada S. Sugano M. Makino N. Okamoto H. Tsuchida K. Atherosclerosis. 1999; 146: 291-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 24Huang Z. Inazu A. Kawashiri M.A. Nohara A. Higashikata T. Mabuchi H. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: E1210-E1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Additionally, our laboratory has shown that CETP gene expression and cholesterol homeostasis are tightly linked (25Izem L. Morton R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26534-26541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Using an antisense oligonucleotide approach, we observed that short term, partial CETP suppression in the SW872 adipocytic cell line led to a 2–3-fold increase in cellular CE and interfered with the capacity of these cells to efflux cholesterol to an acceptor. The consequences of long term CETP deficiency in lipid-storing cells that normally express CETP, such as the human adipocyte, has not been reported. We show here that chronic CETP deficiency induces dramatic changes in the ability of SW872 adipocytic cells to synthesize and store cholesterol and TG. We also demonstrate that these abnormalities in cellular lipid homeostasis can be attributed, at least in part, to an inappropriate cellular distribution of CE and TG, suggesting that CETP may be directly involved in transferring these lipids from the site of their synthesis to their site of storage in SW872 adipocytes. Materials—The human lipocarcinoma cell line, SW872 (HTB-92), was purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Penicillin, streptomycin, bovine serum albumin, and sodium oleate were from Sigma. [1α,2α-3H]Cholesterol, [9,10-3H]oleic acid, [1-14C]oleic acid, and [1-14C]acetic acid sodium salt were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (catalog number 1873580) was from Roche Applied Science. Immobilized Protein A was from Pierce Chemical. LDL and HDL were prepared from human plasma by sequential ultracentrifugation (26Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Investig. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6487) Google Scholar). Lipoprotein-deficient serum (LPDS) was isolated from fresh human serum as the d > 1.25 g/ml density fraction. LDL, HDL, and LPDS were dialyzed extensively versus 0.9% NaCl, 0.02% EDTA and then sterile filtered. Preparation of Stable Transfectants—SW872 adipocytes were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 (3:1) (DMEM/F-12) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Cambrex Corp., Walkersville, MD) and 50 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin in 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C. A 549-bp fragment of human CETP cDNA, corresponding to amino acid 1–183 of the mature protein (13Drayna D. Jarnagin A.S. McLean J. Henzel W. Kohr W. Fielding C. Lawn R. Nature. 1987; 327: 632-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), was excised from pCETP.11 (American Type Culture Collection number 59792) using natural restriction sites in the vector (EcoR I) and the CETP cDNA (BglII). This sequence exists in both full-length and exon 9-deleted CETP mRNA. The EcoRI-BglII restriction fragment was inserted in reverse orientation into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) using BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites in the vector. Sequence was verified by automated sequencing. Vector containing antisense-CETP or vector alone was transfected into SW872 adipocytes using Lipofectamine according to manufacturer's protocol. After a 5-h transfection, the plasmid-containing medium was removed, and cells were maintained in serum-containing medium overnight. Subsequently, cells were passaged, and selection with 500 μg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen) was begun. After 10–15 days, clones were picked and subcultured under the same selection conditions. Confluent cultures of cells were assayed for CETP expression by determining CETP activity and mass (Western blot) in 48-h conditioned medium collected in the absence of serum. A vector-transfected clone with the same level of CETP as cells transfected with Lipofectamine alone was designated as control. Secreted CETP Activity and Mass—When cells were nearly confluent, the culture medium was removed, and fresh serum-free medium was added. After 48 h, the conditioned medium was collected, centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 min to remove cellular debris, and then assayed for CE transfer activity as described (27Morton R.E. Zilversmit D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11751-11757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with [3H]CE-LDL (donor) and HDL (acceptor) at 10 μg/ml of cholesterol each). In some instances, samples were preincubated with 10 μg of anti-CETP IgG (TP2) for 30 min before initiating the transfer assay. CETP secreted into the medium was immunoprecipitated with polyclonal antibody against human CETP (28Morton R.E. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 1367-1377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and quantified by Western blot analysis as described previously (25Izem L. Morton R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26534-26541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Incorporation of Acetate into Cholesterol and CE—To assess the impact of CETP reduction on the net balance of synthetic and degradative pathways for cholesterol and CE, control cells and CETP-deficient cells were pretreated with DMEM/F-12 ± 5% LPDS overnight and then incubated with DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 5% LPDS or 10% FBS and 0.5 μCi of [14C]acetate for 4 days. The cells were washed three times with PBS, and lipids were extracted (29Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Phys. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42875) Google Scholar) and fractionated by thin layer chromatography using a mixture of hexanes, diethyl ether, and acetic acid (70:30:1). Radiolabeled CE and free cholesterol were scraped from the plate and counted. Results were not qualitatively different when the cell incubation media contained 200 μm acetate in addition to the tracer. The rate of cholesterol de novo synthesis was similarly determined but under conditions (t ≤ 3 h) where acetate incorporation was linear. CE Synthesis and Hydrolysis—To assess the effect of CETP expression on CE metabolism, cells were grown to 80% confluence in medium containing 10% FBS and then switched to serum-free medium containing 1% BSA and 100 μm [3H]oleate/BSA (7:1, mole/mole; 1.2 × 104 cpm/nmol of oleate) for 48 h to prelabel the CE pool. Subsequently, the medium was removed, and cells were washed and then incubated in serum-free medium supplemented with 1% BSA, 100 μm [14C]oleate/BSA (3.5 × 103 cpm/nmol of oleate), and 100 μg/ml HDL. At the times indicated, medium was removed, cells were washed, and the 3H and 14C content of the cellular CE pool was measured as described above to quantify CE hydrolysis and synthesis reactions, respectively. The rate of CE synthesis from cholesterol, i.e. acylCoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) activity, was determined in a similar fashion. Here, after near confluence, cells were incubated in medium containing 10% FBS and 500 μm [3H]oleate/BSA. After 5 h at 37 °C, cells were harvested, lipids were extracted, and [3H]CE was quantified as above. Total Cholesterol Mass in Cellular Fractions—Cell were grown in 10% FBS-containing medium until they were confluent and then incubated either with serum-containing medium or with medium containing 5% LPDS for 48 h. The cells were washed, resuspended in PBS, and disrupted in a glass/Teflon homogenizer, and an aliquot was used to measure total cholesterol using a fluorometric assay (30Gamble W. Vaughan M. Kruth H.S. Avigan J. J. Lipid Res. 1978; 19: 1068-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mass of TG and Its Synthesis and Turnover—Cells grown to confluence in serum-containing medium were incubated for 48 h in the same medium or medium supplemented with 500 μm oleate/BSA. The cells were harvested and suspended in PBS, and an aliquot was used to measure TG mass using a fluorometric assay (31Mendez A.J. Cabeza C. Hsia S.L. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 156: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To measure the rate of TG synthesis, cells were incubated for the indicated times with DMEM/F-12 medium containing 10% FBS plus 100 μm [3H]oleate/BSA. Cells were washed with PBS and scraped, lipids were extracted (29Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Phys. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42875) Google Scholar), and the content of radiolabeled TG was determined as described above for CE. TG hydrolysis activity was measured as described above for CE except that TG-labeled cells also received triacsin D (12 μm) to block oleate reesterification. Oil Red O Staining—Cells were cultured on glass coverslips in 12-well plates in DMEM/F12 containing 10% FBS and 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin. At 70% confluence, 250 μm oleic acid/BSA was added to the cells in culture medium containing 2% serum and incubated for 48 h. Cells were washed three times with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution for 30 min, washed with PBS for 1 min, and incubated in 60% isopropyl alcohol for 2 min. The cells were then incubated for 15 min in 0.3% Oil Red O in 60% isopropyl alcohol. After destaining for 1 min in 60% isopropyl alcohol and washing with water for 10 min, coverslips were mounted on glass slides using 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-containing mounting solution. Confocal images were obtained using a Leika TCS-NT confocal laser-scanning microscope. Quantitative analysis of the size of lipid droplets was performed using ImagePro software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). Cellular Fractionation—Cell fractionation was done as described previously (32Brasaemle D.L. Rubin B. Harten I.A. Gruia-Gray J. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38486-38493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent cells were harvested and lysed in hypotonic medium (100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture) for 10 min at 4 °C followed by 10 strokes in a Teflon-glass homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 1000 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatant was adjusted to 35% sucrose and layered over 0.5 ml of 50% sucrose. A linear gradient of 0–30% sucrose was layered over the density-adjusted supernatant and centrifuged for 4 h at 154,000 × g at 4 °C. Ten fractions of 1 ml each were collected starting from the top of the tube. Immunoblots using an antibody against perilipin, a lipid storage droplet marker (a generous gift from Dr. Dawn Brasaemle, Department of Nutritional Sciences, Rutgers), or against calnexin, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) integral membrane protein (Santa Cruz Biotechnology., Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), were performed to determine the localization of these organelles in the gradient. To determine the distribution of recently synthesized lipids among cellular fractions, cells in 100-mm dishes were grown in 5 ml of medium containing 10% FBS and 2 μCi of [14C]acetate for 3 days before being homogenized and fractionated by the sucrose gradient procedure above. Lipids in each fraction were extracted (29Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Phys. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42875) Google Scholar), separated by thin layer chromatography as above, and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Interorganelle Lipid Transfer Assay—Confluent CETP-deficient cells were incubated with DMEM/F12 2% FBS containing 100 μm [3H]oleic acid-BSA for 48 h. The medium was removed, and the cells were washed three times with PBS, harvested, and homogenized as described before. Also, cell homogenates were prepared from unlabeled control and CETP-deficient cells. Unlabeled homogenates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, and the cytosol, the fraction between the floating lipid droplets on the top and the membrane pellet at the bottom, was collected. For the in vitro transfer assay, cytosol (a source of cellular CETP, 300 μg of protein) from unlabeled cells was added to the homogenate of radiolabeled CETP-deficient cells (1 mg of protein) and incubated for 8 h at 37 °C with continuous mixing. When indicated, a monoclonal antibody against human CETP (TP2, 8 μg)) was preincubated (1 h, 37 °C) with control cell cytosol before addition to the assay. Diethyl umbelliferyl phosphate (Sigma-Aldrich) at 300μm was included in the assay to block TG and CE hydrolysis. At the end of the incubation time, the mixture was fractionated on sucrose gradient as described before. Fractions were collected, and CE and TG present in those fractions were extracted and analyzed as described earlier. [125I]LDL Uptake—Confluent cells were pretreated with DMEM/F-12 containing 5% LPDS overnight to up-regulate LDL receptors and then incubated in the same medium containing 50 μg/ml of 125I-LDL for 5 h at 37 °C. LDL degradation was determined from the trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity contained in the media (33Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 5153-5162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LDL uptake was calculated as the sum of cell-associated LDL and degradation values. Nonspecific uptake, determined in the presence of excess (1 mg/ml) unlabeled LDL, was subtracted from the values presented. LDL was iodinated by the iodine monochloride method (34MacFarlane A.S. Nature. 1958; 182: 53-57Crossref Scopus (1497) Google Scholar, 35Bilheimer D.W. Eisenberg S. Levy R.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 260: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar) and had a final specific activity of 32 cpm/ng of protein. ABCA1 Expression Level—Confluent cells were harvested and lysed in buffer containing 25 mm Tris, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton, and protease inhibitor mixture and spun for 10 min at 1000 × g. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. A50-μg protein aliquot of the pellet was used for SDS-PAGE and Western analysis. ABCA1 was detected by reaction of blots with a polyclonal antibody against human ABCA1 (a generous gift from Dr. Jonathan Smith, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH) and goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with peroxidase. Neutral Cholesteryl Ester Hydrolase Assay—To quantify cellular neutral CE hydrolase activity, confluent cells, incubated with media with or without 10% FBS, were washed with PBS and then suspended in cold buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, and protease inhibitor mixture and sonicated 2 × 10 s using a probe sonicator at low power setting. An aliquot of the homogenate was combined with 20 μl of substrate and sufficient 0.05% BSA, 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4 buffer to yield 300 μl and then incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Liposomal substrate, containing cholesteryl-[1-14C]oleate, was prepared as described by Kraemer et al. (36Kraemer F.B. Patel S. Saedi M.S. Sztalryd C. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 663-671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CE hydrolysis was terminated by adding 50 μl of 2 n NaOH. The reaction mixture was extracted using a mixture of methyl alcohol/chloroform/benzene (2.4:2:1) (v/v), and the 14C content of the aqueous phase was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Selection of CETP-deficient Clones—A 549-bp fragment of CETP cDNA was inserted in reverse orientation into pcDNA3 and transfected into SW872 adipocytic cells, and stable transfectants were selected with Geneticin. After 10–15 days, clones were picked and subcultured under the same selection conditions. Confluent cultures of cells were assayed for CETP expression by determining CETP activity and mass (Western blot) in 48-h conditioned medium collected in the absence of serum. Among six clones, CETP activities ranged 20–100% of control cells. CETP synthesis and secretion were markedly reduced in three of these clones as measured by activity or mass (Fig. 1). Comparable reductions in intracellular CETP were also noted for these three clones (Fig. 1, inset). Clone 1 was selected for most studies shown. Limited studies are reported for clones 6 and 8. Influence of Chronic CETP Deficiency on CE Metabolism—We previously observed that acute suppression of CETP expression by antisense oligonucleotides caused a small but significant increase in CE following 24 h of CETP inhibition. Inhibition of CETP expression for 3 days amplified this effect, resulting in a 2–3-fold increase in CE mass (25Izem L. Morton R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26534-26541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This unusual phenotype, i.e. the accumulation of CE by adipocytes, was exacerbated in cells chronically deficient in CETP. As seen in Fig. 2A, the incorporation of [14C]acetate into CE in CETP-deficient cells was 4-fold higher than in control adipocytes. In two other clones expressing similar CETP levels as clone 1, CE was 2.5-fold (clone 6) and 2.0-fold (clone 8) higher than control. We have previously demonstrated in these cells that the CE pool measured using this long term radiolabel approach mirrors closely that quantitated by direct chemical analysis of CE mass (25Izem L. Morton R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26534-26541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This increased incorporation of [14C]acetate into CE in CETP-deficient cells was not due to altered fatty acid synthesis or the capacity of cells to esterify fatty acids into complex lipids since the incorporation of [14C]acetate into free fatty acids and into phospholipid was not different between control and CETP-deficient cells (data not shown). Also, the marked increase of [14C]acetate incorporation into CE in CETP-deficient cells was not due to a change in the relative amounts of radioactivity originating from fatty acid versus cholesterol. In control and CETP-deficient cells, 58.7 ± 2.0 and 62.0 ± 6.2%, respectively, of 14C in CE derived from radiolabeled labeled fatty acid. In cells incubated in 5% LPDS, which promotes cholesterol efflux and reduces CE levels, the CE content of CETP-deficient cells remained >4-fold elevated when compared with control cells (Fig. 2A). Surprisingly, although exposure of CETP-deficient cells to LPDS reduced their CE content, even after residing in this efflux medium for 5 days (2 days pretreatment and 3 days of labeling), these cells still contained more CE than control cells grown under conditions conducive to CE accumulation (10% FBS) (Fig. 2A). To understand the mechanism(s) underlying this increase, we measured the acylation and deacylation activities of the cholesterol cycle. Cells were incubated with [3H]oleate to label the CE pool and then subsequently incubated in medium containing HDL to serve as a cholesterol acceptor to promote CE hydrolysis and [14C]oleate to determine the rate of cholesterol reesterification. CETP-deficient cells were aberrant in both CE acylation and deacylation pathways. HDL-stimulated CE hydrolysis in CETP-deficient cells was significantly impaired (Fig. 2B). On the other hand, CE synthesis was 2-fold higher in cells with low CETP expression (Fig. 2C). The decreased hydrolysis of CE in CETP-deficient cells was not due to a reduction in neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase, the enzyme that hydrolyzes non-lysosomal CE. Neutral CE hydrolase activity, measured under conditions that approximate enzyme mass (36Kraemer F.B. Patel S. Saedi M.S. Sztalryd C. J.

https://openalex.org/W1992540943,"Cardiovascular disease, such as atherosclerosis, has been associated with reduced bone mineral density and fracture risk. A major etiologic factor in atherogenesis is believed to be oxidized phospholipids. We previously found that these phospholipids inhibit spontaneous osteogenic differentiation of marrow stromal cells, suggesting that they may account for the clinical link between atherosclerosis and osteoporosis. Currently, anabolic agents that promote bone formation are increasingly used as a new treatment for osteoporosis. It is not known, however, whether atherogenic phospholipids alter the effects of bone anabolic agents, such as bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 and parathyroid hormone (PTH). Therefore we investigated the effects of oxidized 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine (ox-PAPC) on osteogenic signaling induced by BMP-2 and PTH in MC3T3-E1 cells. Results showed that ox-PAPC attenuated BMP-2 induction of osteogenic markers alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin. Ox-PAPC also inhibited both spontaneous and BMP-induced expression of PTH receptor. Consistently, pretreatment of cells with ox-PAPC inhibited PTH-induced cAMP production and expression of immediate early genes Nurr1 and IL-6. Results from immunofluorescence and Western blot analyses showed that inhibitory effects of ox-PAPC on BMP-2 signaling were associated with inhibition of SMAD 1/5/8 but not p38-MAPK activation. These effects appear to be due to ox-PAPC activation of the ERK pathway, as the ERK inhibitor PD98059 reversed ox-PAPC inhibitory effects on BMP-2-induced alkaline phosphatase activity, osteocalcin expression, and SMAD activation. These results suggest that atherogenic lipids inhibit osteogenic signaling induced by BMP-2 and PTH, raising the possibility that hyperlipidemia and atherogenic phospholipids may interfere with anabolic therapy.

Cardiovascular disease has been associated with lower bone mineral density, especially in the presence of atherosclerosis.

Recent evidence suggests that postmenopausal women with atherogenic lipid profiles have a greater risk of osteopenia than those with normal lipid profiles, paralleling the risk of cardiovascular disease (5Orozco P. Eur. J. Epidemiol. 2004; 19: 1105-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In animal models, atherosclerosis-susceptible mice fed a high fat diet have reduced bone density and bone marrow osteocalcin expression compared with those on a chow diet (6Parhami F. Tintut Y.

A major etiologic factor in atherogenesis is believed to be oxidatively modified lipoproteins and phospholipids. A mildly oxidized form of low density lipoprotein (MM-LDL) and one of its biologically active components, 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine (ox-PAPC), have been shown to trigger atherogenic responses in endothelial cells (7Cushing S.D.

In vitro, these atherogenic lipids inhibit spontaneous osteoblastic differentiation and mineralization of calvarial preosteoblasts and bone marrow stromal cells (9Parhami F. Jackson S.M. Tintut Y.

Activation of the ERK pathway has been shown to negatively regulate osteoblastic differentiation (9Parhami F. Jackson S.M. Tintut Y. Le V. Balucan J.P. Territo M. Demer L.L. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 2067-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Suppression of ERK activation by dominant negative Ras expression in the calvaria of 1-day-old mice results in increased mineralization in the calvaria (13Kono S.J. Oshima Y. Hoshi K. Bonewald L.F. Oda H. Nakamura K. Kawaguchi H. Tanaka S. Bone. 2007; 40: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In addition, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-induced osteogenesis requires down-regulation of the ERK pathway in bone marrow stromal cells (14Osyczka A.M. Leboy P.S. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 3428-3437Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Currently, anabolic agents that promote osteoblastic differentiation leading to increased bone formation have opened a new therapeutic approach for treating osteoporosis. BMPs are potent anabolic agents and play a role in postnatal bone formation. The osteogenic potential of BMP-2 has been shown in both animal models and in clinical studies. It has been used in clinical treatment of non-union fractures as well as osteoporosis (15Chen D. Zhao M. Mundy G.R. Growth Factors. 2004; 22: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar, 16Johnson E.E. Urist M.R. Finerman G.A. Clin. Orthop. Relat. Res. 1988; 230: 257-265PubMed Google Scholar, 17Urist M.R.

Upon ligand binding, BMP-2 signals are mediated by activation of SMAD 1, 5, and 8. In addition to the SMAD proteins, activation of the p38-MAPK pathway is important for BMP-2-induced signaling, and it influences osteoblastic differentiation (18Lee K.S. Hong S.H. Bae S.C. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7156-7163Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Another important anabolic factor is parathyroid hormone (PTH). When given intermittently, PTH has been shown to increase bone mineral density (19Dempster D.W. Cosman F. Parisien M. Shen V. Lindsay R. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 690-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar, 20Ma Y.F. Jee W.S. Ke H.Z. Lin B.Y. Liang X.G. Li M. Yamamoto N. J. Bone Miner.

Chem. 2003; 278: 50195-50202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In contrast, continuous administration of PTH has the opposite effect (22Iida-Klein A. Lu S.S. Kapadia R. Burkhart M. Moreno A. Dempster D.W. Lindsay R. J. Endocrinol. 2005; 186: 549-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, the anabolic response of PTH has been difficult to study in vitro.Ithas been shown that anabolic effects of PTH in vivo are mediated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A pathway (23Keller H. Kneissel M. Bone. 2005; 37: 148-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). In this report, we extend our previous findings to address the effects of oxidized phospholipids on osteogenic activity of BMP-2. Results showed that ox-PAPC attenuates BMP-induced osteoblastic differentiation and PTH receptor expression in calvarial preosteoblasts, MC3T3-E1 cells. In addition, results showed that ox-PAPC inhibits PTH signaling including cAMP production and expression of immediate early genes, suggesting that atherogenic lipids interfere with effects of anabolic agents. These findings raise the possibility that hyperlipidemia may adversely affect anabolic therapies for osteoporosis. Materials—MC3T3-E1, a murine preosteoblastic calvarial cell line, was obtained from Riken Cell Bank (Japan). BMP-2 was obtained from R&D Systems and Peprotech. PAPC was from Avanti-Polar Lipids. PAPC was oxidized and its oxidation state verified as described previously (24Watson A.D. Leitinger N. Navab M. Faull K.F. Horkko S. Witztum J.L. Palinski W. Schwenke D. Salomon R.G. Sha W. Subbanagounder G. Fogelman A.M. Berliner J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13597-13607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Purified human high density lipoproteins (HDL) SB203580 and PD98059 were from Calbiochem. Antibodies to phosphorylated ERK, p38-MAPK, and total p38-MAPK and ERK were from Cell Signaling. Antibodies for total SMAD 1/5/8 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Cell Culture—MC3T3-E1 cells were plated at 40,000/cm2. β-glycerophosphate (5 mm) and ascorbic acid (50 μg/ml) were added as part of the BMP-2 treatment. These osteogenic supplements were not used in experiments without BMP-2. In the experiments using ox-PAPC pretreatment, cells were incubated with ox-PAPC for a total of 6-8 days unless otherwise indicated. Assays were performed at different time points as appropriate for the earliest expected appearance of each osteoblastic differentiation marker (25Date T. Doiguchi Y. Nobuta M. Shindo H. J. Orthop. Sci. 2004; 9: 503-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 26Stein G.S. Lian J.B. Stein J.L. Van Wijnen A.J. Montecino M. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 593-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Alkaline phosphatase activity was assayed at 2 days and osteocalcin expression at 3-4 days after BMP-2 treatment. Alkaline Phosphatase Activity—Cells were plated at 40,000/cm2. One day after plating, cells were treated with the indicated reagents in α-minimal essential medium (Mediatech) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate (Sigma), and 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid (Sigma). Alkaline phosphatase activity in a whole cell lysate was assayed in quadruplicate and normalized to total protein, determined by the Bradford method (27Abedin M. Lim J. Tang T.B. Park D. Demer L.L. Tintut Y. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 727-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Real-time RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), DNase-treated RNA was reverse transcribed, and real-time PCR was performed using the Mx3005P (Stratagene). Sequences for the primers are as follows: Nurr-1 (sense) 5′-ACTCCAATAACTCTGCTGAAG-3′, (antisense) 5′-TGCTAAACTTGACAAACTCTG-3′; β-actin (sense) 5′-AGAGGGAAATCGT-GCGTGAC-3′, (antisense) 5′-CAATAGTGAT-GACCTGGCCGT-3′; osteocalcin (sense) 5′-CCGGGAGCAGTGTGAGCTTA-3′, (antisense) 5′-TAGATGCGTTTGTAGGCGGTC-3′; PTH receptor (sense) 5′-TCAGGGACACTGTGGCAGATC-3′, (antisense) 5′-GCACCTCACCATTGCAGAAAC-3′; IL-6 (sense) 5′-TGTATGAAC-AACGATGATGCACTT-3′, (antisense) 5′-GGTACTCCAGAAGACCAGAGGAAAT-3′. cAMP Assay—Cells were pretreated with ox-PAPC 1 day after seeding. After 6-7 days of treatment, cells were treated with 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (0.5 mm) for 15 min, followed by treatment with PTH (10-8 m) for 30 min. Cyclic AMP accumulation in the whole cell extracts was measured by a cAMP EIA kit (Cayman Chemical) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The data are represented as an average of 3 wells ± S.D. Western Blot Analysis—Whole cell lysates were prepared using lysis buffer supplemented with phosphatase and protease inhibitors, and Western analysis was performed using standard protocols. Immunocytochemistry—Cells were washed, fixed in 10% formalin, and blocked in 5% normal serum. Cells were probed with primary antibody pSMAD1/5/8 (1:100; Cell Signaling) overnight at 4 °C and visualized by the secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (1:200; Invitrogen). ProLong Gold antifade reagent with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Invitrogen P36935) was used for mounting. Data Analysis—Each experiment was performed in at least triplicate wells for each condition, and each experiment was repeated at least three times. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. from all experiments where noted, otherwise as mean ± S.D. from a representative experiment. Means were compared using one-way analysis of variance, with comparison of different groups by Fisher’s protected least significant difference test. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. Effect of Ox-PAPC on BMP-induced Osteoblastic Differentiation—To determine the effects of ox-PAPC on BMP-induced osteoblastic differentiation, MC3T3-E1 cells were cotreated with vehicle, ox-PAPC, and/or BMP-2 for 2 days, after which alkaline phosphatase activity was assessed. Results showed that ox-PAPC decreased the alkaline phosphatase activity induced by BMP-2 (Fig. 1A). Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that pretreatment of cells with ox-PAPC for 4 days, followed by cotreatment with BMP-2 for 4 additional days, also inhibited BMP-2 induction of osteocalcin (Fig. 1A). In additional studies, we found that cotreatment (without ox-PAPC pretreatment) was sufficient for the inhibitory effects (Fig. 1B). Treatment of cells with native PAPC (negative control) did not (Fig. 1B), suggesting that oxidative modification is required for the inhibitory effects. Because BMP-2 induces PTH receptor expression (28Ju W. Hoffmann A. Verschueren K. Tylzanowski P. Kaps C. Gross G. Huylebroeck D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 1889-1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), we next assessed the ox-PAPC effect on PTH receptor expression. Results showed that PTHR expression induced by BMP-2 was also attenuated by ox-PAPC (Fig. 1C). Effect of Ox-PAPC on PTH Signaling—PTH and its related peptides induce anabolic bone formation in vivo when administered intermittently (19Dempster D.W. Cosman F. Parisien M. Shen V. Lindsay R. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 690-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar, 20Ma Y.F. Jee W.S. Ke H.Z. Lin B.Y. Liang X.G. Li M. Yamamoto N. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1995; 10: 496-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Because our results showed that ox-PAPC attenuated BMP-2-induced PTHR expression, we further assessed the effect of ox-PAPC on PTH signaling. Treatment of MC3T3-E1 cells with ox-PAPC alone for 6 days inhibited PTHR expression (Fig. 2A). In addition, pretreatment of cells with ox-PAPC for 7 days inhibited PTH induction of cAMP (Fig. 2B). We next assessed the effects of ox-PAPC on PTH induction of immediate early genes mediated both in vitro and in vivo via the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A pathway (29Pirih F.Q. Aghaloo T.L. Bezouglaia O. Nervina J.M. Tetradis S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 332: 494-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 30Pirih F.Q. Nervina J.M. Pham L. Aghaloo T. Tetradis S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 306: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Results showed that pretreatment of cells with ox-PAPC inhibited expression of immediate early genes Nurr1 and IL-6 induced by PTH at 2 h (Fig. 2C). Ox-PAPC treatment alone showed some induction of IL-6 expression (Fig. 2C). Effect of Ox-PAPC on BMP-2 Signaling Pathway—Osteogenic effects of BMP-2 have been shown to be mediated by the SMAD and p38-MAPK pathways (18Lee K.S. Hong S.H. Bae S.C. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7156-7163Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Consistently, we found that treatment of MC3T3-E1 cells with SB203580, an inhibitor of p38-MAPK, attenuated BMP-induced alkaline phosphatase activity (data not shown). To assess whether the inhibitory effect of ox-PAPC is due to inhibition of BMP-2-induced p38-MAPK, cells were treated with BMP-2 and/or ox-PAPC. Results showed that BMP-2 treatment alone induced p38-MAPK phosphorylation, which was not attenuated by ox-PAPC (Fig. 3A). Cotreatment with ox-PAPC and SB203580, a specific p38-MAPK inhibitor, caused further inhibition of alkaline phosphatase activity (Fig. 3B, compare bars 2, 3, and 4). Altogether, these results suggest that the inhibitory effect of ox-PAPC on BMP-2 signaling is either downstream of p38-MAPK or not via inhibition of the p38-MAPK pathway. We next assessed the effect of ox-PAPC on BMP-induced SMAD activation by Western analysis and immunofluorescence. Cells were treated with BMP-2 and ox-PAPC for 1.5 h, the time point previously shown for SMAD activation (14Osyczka A.M. Leboy P.S. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 3428-3437Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Results showed that ox-PAPC attenuated BMP-2 activation of SMAD 1/5/8 phosphorylation (Fig. 3, C and D). In marrow stromal cells, MM-LDL activated the ERK pathway (9Parhami F. Jackson S.M. Tintut Y. Le V. Balucan J.P. Territo M. Demer L.L. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 2067-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), which negatively regulates matrix mineralization both in vitro and in vivo (13Kono S.J. Oshima Y. Hoshi K. Bonewald L.F. Oda H. Nakamura K. Kawaguchi H. Tanaka S. Bone. 2007; 40: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Therefore, we assessed the effect of ox-PAPC on ERK activation. Results showed that ox-PAPC induced ERK phosphorylation, slightly at 30 min and more significantly at 3 h, but BMP-2 did not (Fig. 4A). Consistently, both Western analysis and immunofluorescence showed that treatment of cells with an ERK inhibitor, PD98059, partially reversed the inhibitory effects of ox-PAPC on BMP-2 activation of SMAD 1/5/8 (Fig. 4, B and C). In addition, treatment of cells with PD98059 reversed the BMP-induced alkaline phosphatase activity and osteocalcin expression (Fig. 4, D and E). Oxidant Stress Does Not Mediate Ox-PAPC Inhibitory Effects—Because oxidant stress has been shown to inhibit osteoblastic differentiation via the ERK pathway (31Bai X.C. Lu D. Bai J. Zheng H. Ke Z.Y. Li X.M. Luo S.Q. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 314: 197-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), and oxidant stress mediates MM-LDL inhibitory effects on differentiation of osteoblasts (32Mody N. Parhami F. Sarafian T.A. Demer L.L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar), we next examined whether antioxidants were able to reverse ox-PAPC inhibitory effects. Cells were pretreated with the antioxidant particle HDL (100 μg/ml) for 24 h prior to cotreatment with BMP-2 and ox-PAPC. Results showed that HDL treatment did not reverse the inhibitory effect of ox-PAPC on BMP-2-induced alkaline phosphatase activity (Fig. 5). Treatment with other antioxidants, Trolox (100 μm) or pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate (10 μm), also had no significant effect on ox-PAPC inhibitory effects (data not shown). The present study extends our previous findings concerning spontaneous osteogenesis to the clinically important area of anabolic stimulation. In previous studies, we found that atherogenic lipoproteins and phospholipids, including mildly oxidized LDL and ox-PAPC, inhibit spontaneous osteogenesis in marrow stromal cells via the ERK pathway (9Parhami F. Jackson S.M. Tintut Y. Le V. Balucan J.P. Territo M. Demer L.L. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 2067-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), thus providing a possible link for the epidemiological association of osteoporosis with atherosclerosis. The present results indicate that ox-PAPC also inhibits osteoblastic differentiation induced by BMP-2 in mouse calvarial preosteoblasts. The inhibitory effects of ox-PAPC on BMP-2 signaling appear to be through inhibition of SMADs via ERK, and not p38-MAPK (Fig. 6). The ERK signaling pathway has been shown to play a role in osteoblastic differentiation. Some have reported that ERK activation is required for induction of alkaline phosphatase activity (33Chae H.J.

The inhibitory mechanism of ERK has been shown to involve attenuation of BMP-induced nuclear translocation of SMAD 1, 5, and 8 (14Osyczka A.M. Leboy P.S. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 3428-3437Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In the present study, we also found that ox-PAPC reduces BMP-2 activation of SMADs (Fig. 6). Consistent with this, inhibitors of ERK reverse the inhibitory effects of ox-PAPC on BMP-2 effects, including activation of SMAD 1, 5, and 8, thus supporting the inhibitory role of ERK in osteoblastic differentiation. We have previously found that MM-LDL induces reactive oxygen species, which inhibit osteoblastic differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells (32Mody N. Parhami F. Sarafian T.A. Demer L.L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). In addition, oxidant stress has been shown to inhibit osteoblastic differentiation via the ERK pathway (31Bai X.C. Lu D. Bai J. Zheng H. Ke Z.Y. Li X.M. Luo S.Q. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 314: 197-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether antioxidants reverse the inhibitory effects of ox-PAPC. Although ox-PAPC is an active component of MM-LDL, our results show that inhibitors of oxidant stress did not attenuate ox-PAPC effects on BMP-2 induction of alkaline phosphatase activity, suggesting that components other than ox-PAPC in MM-LDL mediate oxidant stress or, alternatively, that BMP-2-induced osteoblastic differentiation is independent of oxidant stress. Inhibitory effects of ox-PAPC on BMP-2 may stem from inhibition of PTH receptor expression or vice versa since studies from other investigators demonstrate an interaction between BMP-2 and PTH receptor signaling. For example, BMP-2 induces PTH receptor expression (28Ju W. Hoffmann A. Verschueren K. Tylzanowski P. Kaps C. Gross G. Huylebroeck D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 1889-1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), whereas PTH-related protein enhances BMP-2 induction of osteogenesis (38Chan G.K. Miao D. Deckelbaum R. Bolivar I. Karaplis A. Goltzman D. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 5511-5520Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that ox-PAPC also inhibits PTH receptor induction by BMP-2 and consequently that it inhibits PTH-induced cAMP production and expression of immediate early genes Nurr1 and IL-6 (Fig. 6). Interestingly, the data also suggest that preosteoblasts may be more sensitive to the inhibitory effects of ox-PAPC, since ox-PAPC inhibited PTH receptor expression to a greater extent in cells that did not receive the osteogenic supplements (Fig. 2A versus Fig. 1C). Prolonged expression of inflammatory cytokines enhances bone resorption and thus contributes to osteoporosis (39Rodan G.A. Bone. 1992; 13 (, Suppl. 1, -S6): S3Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Previously, ox-PAPC has been shown to induce inflammatory genes, including IL-6, in endothelial cells and monocytes both in vitro and in vivo (8Furnkranz A. Schober A. Bochkov V.N. Bashtrykov P. Kronke G. Kadl A. Binder B.R. Weber C. Leitinger N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2005; 25: 633-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 40Kadl A. Huber J. Gruber F. Bochkov V.N. Binder B.R. Leitinger N. Vascul. Pharmacol. 2002; 38: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Our results show that chronic ox-PAPC treatment increased IL-6 expression in preosteoblastic calvarial cells. These findings suggest the potential role of atherogenic lipids in osteoclastic resorption by induction of inflammatory cytokines by osteoblasts. This is in agreement with our previous findings where oxidized lipids enhance osteoclastic differentiation of marrow preosteoclasts both directly and in coculture with stromal/osteoblasts (41Tintut Y. Morony S. Demer L.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24 (-e10): e6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Tintut Y. Parhami F. Tsingotjidou A. Tetradis S. Territo M. Demer L.L. J. Biol.

The two experimentally characterized NikR orthologs, from Helicobacter pylori and Escherichia coli, display vastly different regulatory capabilities in response to increased intracellular Ni2+. Here, we demonstrate that the nine-residue N-terminal arm present in H. pylori NikR plays a critical role in the expanded regulatory capabilities of this NikR family member. Specifically, the N-terminal arm is required to inhibit NikR binding to low affinity and nonspecific DNA sequences and is also linked to a cation requirement for NikR binding to the nixA promoter. Site-directed mutagenesis and arm-truncation variants of NikR indicate that two residues, Asp-7 and Asp-8, are linked to the cation requirement for binding. Pro-4 and Lys-6 are required for maximal DNA binding affinity of the full-length protein to both the nixA and ureA promoters. The N-terminal arm is highly variable among NikR family members, and these results suggest that it is an adaptable structural feature that can tune the regulatory capabilities of NikR to the nickel physiology of the microbe in which it is found.

The N-terminal arm is highly variable among NikR family members, and these results suggest that it is an adaptable structural feature that can tune the regulatory capabilities of NikR to the nickel physiology of the microbe in which it is found. Nickel is an essential cofactor in several metalloenzymes (1Mulrooney S.B. Hausinger R.P. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 27: 239-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 2Maroney M.J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 188-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) that are expressed primarily in microorganisms. Many microbes are capable of expressing at least one Ni2+-enzyme; however no microbial genome encodes more than four known Ni2+-enzymes. The cellular Ni2+ requirement is often directly proportional to Ni2+-enzyme expression levels. Facultative anaerobes, such as Escherichia coli, require Ni-Fe hydrogenases for growth under specific anaerobic conditions (3Ballantine S.P. Boxer D.H. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 454-459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Sawers R.G. Ballantine S.P. Boxer D.H. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 1324-1331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Zinoni F. Beier A. Pecher A. Wirth R. Bock A. Arch. Microbiol. 1984; 139: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The induction of hydrogenase expression results in a concomitant increase in Ni2+ transporter expression and intracellular Ni2+ levels (6Rowe J.L. Starnes G.L. Chivers P.T. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 6317-6323Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 7Iwig J.S. Rowe J.L. Chivers P.T. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 62: 252-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In some cases microbes maintain high Ni2+-enzyme levels in the apo form and only increase intracellular Ni2+ under conditions in which enzyme activity is required. For example, Helicobacter pylori urease can compose up to 10% of the total protein of cells grown at neutral pH (8Bauerfeind P. Garner R. Dunn B.E. Mobley H.L. Gut. 1997; 40: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), where the acid buffering activity of urease is not necessary for cell viability (9Eaton K.A. Brooks C.L. Morgan D.R. Krakowka S.

In both examples the coordinated regulation of Ni2+ import with the nickel requirements of each organism is critical for optimizing Ni2+-enzyme activity to specific growth conditions while also preventing the accumulation of excess nickel ions, which are potentially toxic. The microbes described above in addition to many others possess a gene that encodes the Ni2+-dependent transcriptional regulator NikR. E. coli NikR (EcNikR) 2The abbreviations used are: EcNikR, E. coli NikR; HpNikR, H. pylori NikR; DMS, dimethyl sulfate; RHH, ribbon-helix-helix; Strep, streptavidin. was the first identified family member (19Chivers P.T.

The lower affinity Ni2+ site is structurally distinct from the high affinity site and exhibits six-coordinate, octahedral geometry (43Leitch S. Bradley M.J. Rowe J.L. Chivers P.T. Maroney M.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007; 129: 5085-5095Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Both protein-DNA complexes are hypothesized to have a biological function, resulting in a graded response to extracellular Ni2+ concentrations (6Rowe J.L. Starnes G.L. Chivers P.T. J.

In contrast, HpNikR displays only a modest increase in affinity for the ureA promoter when the Ni2+:NikR stoichiometry is greater than 1:1, suggesting that the second, lower affinity Ni2+-binding site observed for EcNikR is not a conserved feature of all NikR orthologs (26Abraham L.O.

Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 2520-2529Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Here, we show that the nine-residue N-terminal arm of HpNikR (Fig. 1), not visible in the recent crystal structures of HpNikR (45Dian C. Schauer K. Kapp U. McSweeney S.M. Labigne A. Terradot L. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 361: 715-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), plays a critical role in NikR DNA binding. The arm inhibited low affinity and nonspecific NikR-DNA interactions. Additionally, removal of the arm relieved a cation requirement for DNA binding specifically at the nixA promoter, providing evidence that the arm plays distinct structural roles at different promoters. Mutagenesis of individual arm residues identified amino acids responsible for the PnixA cation requirement as well as those necessary for high affinity DNA binding. These results suggest that the N-terminal arm of HpNikR is critical for the ability of this transcription factor to recognize degenerate DNA-binding sites and, thus, regulate many genes to integrate the complex Ni2+ physiology of this organism in response to changes in intracellular Ni2+ levels. The N-terminal arms of different NikR family members vary widely in sequence and length, suggesting that this structural feature may be important for evolving regulatory specificity in accordance with cell physiology. HpNikR, Cloning and Mutagenesis—H. pylori strain 26695 nikR (HP1338) was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA using the primers PC121 and PC122 (Table 1; Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA) and cloned into pET22-b using the NdeI and XhoI restriction sites (Novagen, Madison, WI) to create pEB116. nt9- and nt5-HpNikR were created using primers EB058 or EB190, respectively, and PC122 to amplify a 5′-trun-cated nikR from pEB116. The resulting products were digested with NdeI and XhoI and ligated into pET22-b digested with the same enzymes to create pEB149 (nt9-HpNikR) and pEB202 (nt5-HpNikR). Site-directed mutagenesis of individual HpNikR residues (described under “Results”) was carried out using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using complementary oligonucleotides with the mutated codon and Pfu DNA polymerase.

Protein concentration was determined in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride using ∊276 = 9895 m–1 cm–1, as predicted by primary sequence analysis. To remove Ni2+ from purified protein, the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid eluate was incubated with 50 mm EDTA for 48 h at 4 °C followed by gel filtration (the second purification step). The removal of Ni2+ ions was confirmed using UV-visible spectroscopy at 302 nm. Promoter Fragments, Cloning and Labeling—DNA fragments for promoter regions were amplified by PCR using the oligonucleotide pairs described in Table 1. A subset of fragments (Table 1) was cloned into pBluescriptII SK (Stratagene) using standard molecular biology techniques. The cloned promoter sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Promoter fragments for DNA binding assays were generated by PCR as follows. 0.5 μm forward (5′) primers (listed first in Table 1) for the nixA, ureA, fur, nikR, hpn, and rpoD fragments were 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (GE Biosciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) in a total volume of 40 μl. Excess [γ-32P]ATP was removed by desalting, and the purified primers were used in a PCR reaction with the corresponding reverse primers (listed second in Table 1) using plasmids pEB106, pEB131, or pEB104 as templates for the nixA, ureA, and nikR promoters or H. pylori 26695 genomic DNA for the fur, hpn, and rpoD fragments. The 143-bp fragment of the H. pylori rpoD gene had comparable length and GC content to the other fragments and was used as a negative control. The resulting labeled fragments were purified using a Qiagen PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). DNA Binding Assays—DNase I footprinting was performed as described previously (19Chivers P.T.

https://openalex.org/W1976637856,"Background Statins have previously been shown to reduce the in vitro infection of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) through modulation of Rho GTPase activity and lipid raft formation at the cell surface, as well as by disrupting LFA-1 incorporation into viral particles. Principle Findings Here we demonstrate that treatment of an enriched CD4+ lymphocyte population with lovastatin (Lov), mevastatin (Mev) and simvastatin (activated and non-activated, Sim(A) and Sim(N), respectively) can reduce the cell surface expression of the CC-chemokine receptor CCR5 (P<0.01 for Sim(A) and Lov). The lowered CCR5 expression was associated with down-regulation of CCR5 mRNA expression. The CC-chemokine RANTES protein and mRNA expression levels were slightly increased in CD4+ enriched lymphocytes treated with statins. Both R5 and X4 HIV-1 were reduced for their infection of statin-treated cells; however, in cultures where statins were removed and where a decrease in CCR5 expression was observed, there was a preferential inhibition of infection with an R5 versus X4 virus. Conclusions The results indicate that the modulation of CC-chemokine receptor (CCR5) and CC-chemokine (RANTES) expression levels should be considered as contributing to the anti-viral effects of statins, preferentially inhibiting R5 viruses. This observation, in combination with the immunomodulatory activity exerted by statins, suggests they may possess more potent anti-HIV-1 activity when applied during the early stages of infection or in lowering viral transmission. Alternatively, statin treatment could be considered as a way to modulate immune induction such as during vaccination protocols."
https://openalex.org/W2113535055,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a bacterial endotoxin, triggers deleterious systemic inflammatory responses when released into blood circulation, causing organ dysfunction and death. In response to LPS stimulation, CD14 and toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 elicit inflammatory signaling cascades. Although leukocyte integrins (CD11b/CD18 and CD11c/CD18) were reported to bind LPS and induce NF-kappaB translocation, the evidence on such epitope location remains elusive. The present study aims to delineate the LPS-binding sites on the integrin CD18 antigen and to design peptide(s) as potential prophylactic and/or therapeutic agents to modulate LPS effects in activated Jurkat cells. Epitope mapping analysis using a series of CD18 truncated variants revealed two putative LPS-binding sites within the betaA region (216-248 and 266-318 a.a.), which were further confirmed by point mutation studies. Inhibition assay demonstrated that the CD18-betaA(266-318) peptide could block LPS binding in a dose-dependent manner. Our data also indicated that treatment with the CD18-peptide modulated TNF-alpha mRNA transcription via the NF-kappaB signaling pathway in LPS-activated Jurkat cells. In conclusion, we have identified two novel LPS-binding sites located at the CD18 betaA domain of leukocyte integrin, and the integrin peptide betaA(266-318) is shown to inhibit LPS binding and subsequent inflammatory events, having therapeutic implications to cure gram-negative endotoxemia."
https://openalex.org/W2093522910,"The self-perpetuating conversion of cellular prion proteins (PrP(C)) into an aggregated beta-sheet rich conformation is associated with transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE). The loop 166-175 (L1) in PrP(C), which displays sequence and structural variation among species, has been suggested to play a role in species barrier, in particular against transmission of TSE from cervids to domestic and laboratory animals. L1 is ordered in elk PrP, as well as in a mouse/elk hybrid (in which L1 of mouse is replaced by elk) but not in other species such as mice, humans, and bovine. To investigate the source and significance of L1 dynamics, we carried out explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations (approximately 0.5 micros in total) of the mouse prion protein, the mouse/elk hybrid, and control simulations, in which the mouse sequence is reintroduced into the structure of the mouse/elk hybrid. We found that the flexibility of L1 correlates with the backbone dynamics of Ser170. Furthermore, L1 mobility promotes a substantial displacement of Tyr169, rupture of the Asp178-Tyr128 and Asp178-Tyr169 side chain hydrogen bonds, as well as disruption of Tyr169-Phe175 pi-stacking interaction. The simulation results go beyond the available experimental data because they highlight the dependence of this network of interactions on residue 170 and L1 plasticity."

In reality, these conductances represent a crucial functional mechanism by which neurons control resting membrane potentials. A new study in Cell by Lu et al. has surprisingly confirmed the identity of the long-sought voltage-insensitive sodium leak conductance to be encoded by the third branch of the voltage-gated sodium and calcium channel family. Most electrophysiologists generally do not speak highly of leak currents. In reality, these conductances represent a crucial functional mechanism by which neurons control resting membrane potentials. A new study in Cell by Lu et al. has surprisingly confirmed the identity of the long-sought voltage-insensitive sodium leak conductance to be encoded by the third branch of the voltage-gated sodium and calcium channel family. Nerve cell resting membrane potentials are set by a complex interplay of ionic pumps, transporters, and channels, most of which have been well characterized at the molecular level. Missing from this molecular description has been the identification of the voltage-insensitive background sodium “leak” conductance that helps to maintain resting potentials depolarized to the ∼−90 mV potassium equilibrium potential. While the background sodium conductance has variously been speculated to result from voltage-gated sodium channels, “leaky” potassium channels, transporters, and TRP channels, until a recent report in Cell (Lu et al., 2007Lu B. Su Y. Das S. Liu J. Xia J. Ren D. Cell. 2007; 129: 371-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) there has been no definitive evidence one way or the other as to the molecular nature of this conductance so crucial to setting membrane resting potential. To set the story up, between the late 1980s and into the 1990s, molecular cloning and exogenous expression studies revealed that a family of 20 four-domain type α subunits encode the known voltage-gated sodium (Nav1.1–1.9 and Nax) and calcium (Cav1.1–1.4, Cav2.1–2.3, Cav3.1–3.3) channels (Figure 1). Much subsequent work went into defining the structure-function relationships concerning sodium and calcium channel permeation, gating, modulation, and trafficking. However, a 1999 report of the existence of a third branch on the four-domain voltage-gated ion channel genetic tree left the somewhat uncomfortable feeling that something important was missing from the big picture (Lee et al., 1999Lee J.H. Cribbs L.L. Perez-Reyes E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 231-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The third branch encoded a related but structurally distinct four-domain channel (now called NALCN) that is widely expressed in mammalian neurons, but until now there had not been a report of its physiological or pharmacological properties. In a convincing study published in the April 20, 2007, issue of Cell, Lu et al. have finally been able to elucidate the permeation characteristics and some of the biophysical and pharmacological properties of this channel. Utilizing heterologous expression in HEK293 cells, the authors find the NALCN channel to encode a constitutively activated, nonselective cation channel that forms the long-sought neuronal background sodium “leak” conductance. Similar to that for the native conductance, the NALCN current is voltage insensitive and both TTX and Cs+ resistant. That the NALCN channel is not voltage gated is perhaps not surprising since the S4 transmembrane segment in each of the four domains contains a reduced number of positively charged residues compared to the strongly voltage-activated calcium and sodium channels. In the same way, the distinct permeation properties of NALCN are consistent with the unique residues in its selectivity filter (EEKE) that are a “hybrid” between that for the sodium (DEKA) and calcium (EEEE or EEDD) channels. Indeed, that NALCN actually forms the channel itself is supported by the fact that when Lu and coworkers mutated the wild-type NALCN selectivity filter from EEKE to EEKA the selectivity ratio for calcium decreased from PCa = 0.5 to PCa = 0.1. Homozygous NALCN gene knockout mice present a severely disrupted respiratory rhythm associated with increased periods of apnea and leading to neonatal death of all animals within 24 hr of birth. The disrupted respiratory patterns in the mutant animals are likely due to a defect in neuronal function, as C4 nerve root electrical recordings showed a loss of the normal rhythmic bursting pattern associated with control of diaphragm contraction. Further analysis of hippocampal neurons from NALCN mutant mice suggests that this channel is the major contributor to resting sodium conductance in central neurons. Mutant neurons exhibit a resting membrane potential about 10 mV more hyperpolarized than wild-type (∼−71 mV versus ∼−61 mV), an effect that clearly contributes basally to hippocampal excitability. The study of Lu et al., 2007Lu B. Su Y. Das S. Liu J. Xia J. Ren D. Cell. 2007; 129: 371-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, is the first piece in a puzzle, and plenty of questions remain concerning understanding the contributions of NALCN toward overall neuronal physiology. Some of these may be addressed by construction of a conditional knockout to determine the physiological roles of NALCN in adult populations of neurons. Additional interesting clues already come from studies performed in D. melanogaster and C. elegans. The D. melanogaster NALCN ortholog called na (for narrow abdomen) and two orthologous genes in C. elegans, nca-1 and nca-2, are also known to be expressed in neurons (Nash et al., 2002Nash H.A. Scott R.L. Lear B.C. Allada R. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 2152-2158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, Humphrey et al., 2007Humphrey J.A. Hamming K.S. Thacker C.M. Scott R.L. Sedensky M.M. Snutch T.P. Morgan P.G. Nash H.A. Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 624-629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, na protein is concentrated in synaptic regions but not in areas of the brain occupied primarily by cell bodies or axonal tracts. Some hypomorphic mutations of na in Drosophila induce a strong resistance to halothane, while contrastingly the depletion of nca-1 and nca-2 in C. elegans results in hypersensitivity to halothane (Nash et al., 2002Nash H.A. Scott R.L. Lear B.C. Allada R. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 2152-2158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, Mir et al., 1997Mir B. Iyer S. Ramaswami M. Krishnan K.S. Genetics. 1997; 147: 701-712PubMed Google Scholar). It has been reported that halothane significantly reduces the amplitude of nerve-evoked excitatory junctional currents but not miniature excitatory junctional currents in wild-type D. melanogaster neuromuscular junction. Halothane has no effect in the mutant har38 and har85 nerve-evoked excitatory neuromuscular junction currents (Nishikawa and Kidokoro, 1999Nishikawa K. Kidokoro Y. Anesthesiology. 1999; 90: 1691-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the NALCN channel could have a presynaptic function at the glutamate-mediated synapses of the neuromuscular junction in D. melanogaster. It should be of interest to examine the possibility of a presynaptic localization of NALCN in mammalian central neurons. Why other groups over the past 8 years were unsuccessful in functionally expressing the cloned NACLN channel remains a mystery. Another and perhaps related issue is whether the NALCN α subunit protein functions alone or as part of a multisubunit complex. Considering the situation for the other four-domain voltage-gated channels (Catterall et al., 2006Catterall W.A. Hulme J.T. Jiang X. Few W.P. J. Recept. Signal Transduct. Res. 2006; 26: 577-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), a multisubunit complex is likely, and further molecular and biochemical experiments are needed. This is also hinted at in both D. melanogaster and C. elegans, where Humphrey et al., 2007Humphrey J.A. Hamming K.S. Thacker C.M. Scott R.L. Sedensky M.M. Snutch T.P. Morgan P.G. Nash H.A. Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 624-629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar have recently reported the existence of a large cytosolic gene product (called unc-79) that modulates the expression of ortholog NALCN protein levels via a posttranscriptional mechanism. The depletion of unc-79 protein in these organisms results in similar locomotion and anesthetic sensitivity phenotypes to those observed for the NALCN ortholog mutants. Interestingly, homozygous gene knockout of the mouse ortholog of unc-79 also results in a phenotype similar to that reported by Lu and coworkers for NALCN, namely initial activity just after birth but followed shortly thereafter by neonatal lethality (Nakayama et al., 2006Nakayama M. Iida M. Koseki H. Ohara O. FASEB J. 2006; 20: E1061-E1070Google Scholar). In the human genome, NALCN is localized on chromosome 13q32.3, a region known to contain a susceptibility locus for bipolar disorders (Hayden and Nurnberger, 2006Hayden E.P. Nurnberger Jr., J.I. Genes Brain Behav. 2006; 5: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in Drosophila, the na hypomorphic mutation affects the neuronal output of the circadian pacemaker, presumably by an abnormal release of the key neuropeptide PDF (Lear et al., 2005Lear B.C. Lin J.M. Keath J.R. McGill J.J. Raman I.M. Allada R. Neuron. 2005; 48: 965-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The involvement of NALCN in the circadian rhythm of Drosophila may be of importance since bipolar disorders are often associated with altered diurnal behavior (McClung, 2007McClung C.A. Pharmacol. Ther. 2007; 114: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Further investigations are needed to determine any possible contributions of NALCN in bipolar or related psychiatric disorders. In summary, Lu and coworkers have at last revealed some of the biophysical, pharmacological, and neurophysiological properties of the last member of the four-domain type of ion channel. Describing NALCN as the sodium “leak” channel implies this conductance to be passive, understated, and perhaps even somewhat annoying from the electrophysiologist's experimental perspective. In fact, as NALCN critically contributes to setting neuronal resting potential, its function and regulation are likely to be crucially relevant to the multitude of downstream physiological processes dependent upon such a fundamental activity. The description “sodium resting conductance” is perhaps a more apt name for this fundamental ionic channel. The Neuronal Channel NALCN Contributes Resting Sodium Permeability and Is Required for Normal Respiratory RhythmLu et al.CellApril 20, 2007In BriefSodium plays a key role in determining the basal excitability of the nervous systems through the resting “leak” Na+ permeabilities, but the molecular identities of the TTX- and Cs+-resistant Na+ leak conductance are totally unknown. Here we show that this conductance is formed by the protein NALCN, a substantially uncharacterized member of the sodium/calcium channel family. Unlike any of the other 20 family members, NALCN forms a voltage-independent, nonselective cation channel. NALCN mutant mice have a severely disrupted respiratory rhythm and die within 24 hours of birth. Full-Text PDF Open Archive"

Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4840-4848Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, Nithianantharajah and Hannan, 2006Nithianantharajah J. Hannan A.J. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 7: 697-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). In laboratories, exposure to EE is achieved by housing animals (rodents) in large cages where exploratory activity is promoted by the presence of a variety of toys, tunnels, and climbing devices. A recent study in Nature by Fischer et al. suggests that these enrichment effects might be mediated, at least in part, by chromatin remodeling (Fischer et al., 2007Fischer A. Sananbenesi F. Wang X. Dobbin M. Tsai L.H. Nature. 2007; 447 (Published online April 29, 2007): 178-182https://doi.org/10.1038/nature05772Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). Fischer et al. examined the beneficial effects of EE in a mouse model, the p25 transgenic mouse, which allows temporally and spatially restricted induction of neuronal loss. The p25 protein has been implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (Cruz and Tsai, 2004Cruz J.C. Tsai L.H. Trends Mol. Med. 2004; 10: 452-458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The authors had previously demonstrated that, upon induction of the p25 transgene in adult mice, neurodegeneration is triggered, and animals also display both learning and memory impairments (Fischer et al., 2005Fischer A. Sananbenesi F. Pang P.T. Lu B. Tsai L.H. Neuron. 2005; 48: 825-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Six weeks after switching the transgene on, mice are not only unable to form new memories but they are also unable to retrieve memories acquired before the transgene was switched on. Now, Fischer et al. have used this model system to assess whether EE has beneficial effects in this transgenic animal model (Fischer et al., 2007Fischer A. Sananbenesi F. Wang X. Dobbin M. Tsai L.H. Nature. 2007; 447 (Published online April 29, 2007): 178-182https://doi.org/10.1038/nature05772Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). Six weeks after induction of p25, when anatomical and functional deficits are well established, the authors transferred the animals into an EE for 4 weeks. Surprisingly, the authors found that this rescued the mice's ability to form new memories (i.e., the mice learned a new fear conditioning and a new spatial task) and also allowed the mice to re-establish access to remote memories learned prior to brain degeneration, all of this despite the fact that the neuronal loss did not recover (Figure 1). It is important to note that the new memories formed by the mice required the hippocampus, while remembering the remote memories likely involved accessing neocortical networks, as these remote memories would have been progressively transferred from the hippocampus to the neocortex over time. Indeed, while recall of recent memories activates the hippocampus and hippocampal lesions impair this recall, remote memory retrieval is impaired by cortical lesions, and their recall activates cortical areas (Frankland and Bontempi, 2005Frankland P.W. Bontempi B. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar). The fact that EE restores both new learning and access to remote memories suggests that the effects of EE are probably widespread within hippocampal and cortical areas. What caused the effects reported by Fischer et al.? The authors demonstrated that synaptic-related proteins were increased in EE mice, indicating the presence of new dendritic branching and activation of synaptogenesis. This increase was seen in both the hippocampus and the cortex, strengthening the idea that the behavioral effects they reported might be related to these anatomical changes. Prior studies had also shown an effect of EE on neural connectivity, and these results had been taken as an indication that synaptic plasticity was induced. But the authors also went a step further. They first demonstrated that EE increased histone acetylation in the hippocampus and, to a lesser extent, in the cortex of wild-type mice. Histone posttranslational modifications regulate chromatin susceptibility to transcription: high levels of histone acetylation on a specific DNA segment is generally correlated with increased transcription rates. The effects of EE on wild-type mice suggested that the effects of EE in the p25 transgenic mice might be mediated, at least in part, by histone acetylation. Indeed, the authors also found that promoting histone acetylation by means of administration of histone deacetylation inhibitors to these mice also promoted synaptogenesis and recovery from learning and memory deficits, similar to that seen with exposure to EE. Beneficial effects of histone acetylation in memory-related plasticity had previously been described both in WT animals and in animal models of human mental retardation (Alarcon et al., 2004Alarcon J.M. Malleret G. Touzani K. Vronskaya S. Ishii S. Kandel E.R. Barco A. Neuron. 2004; 42: 947-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar, Korzus et al., 2004Korzus E. Rosenfeld M.G. Mayford M. Neuron. 2004; 42: 961-972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, Levenson and Sweatt, 2005Levenson J.M. Sweatt J.D. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 108-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). The importance of the Fischer et al. results is that they show, for the first time, that promoting histone acetylation restores learning and the access to long-term memories in a degenerated brain, after synaptic and neuronal loss had already occurred and in the absence of neuronal regeneration. Similar beneficial relationships between histone acetylation states and EE effects have also recently been shown to exist in the visual system. Histone acetylation can be modulated by visual experience, and this affects subsequent experience-dependent plasticity in the visual cortex (Putignano et al., 2007Putignano E. Lonetti G. Cancedda L. Ratto G. Costa M. Maffei L. Pizzorusso T. Neuron. 2007; 53: 747-759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Visual experience activates histone acetylation during the critical period for ocular dominance plasticity, but its action becomes downregulated in adult animals, in correlation with the lower levels of adult cortical plasticity: this suggests that, as it does with plasticity of visual cortical connections, visual experience progressively reduces its own effectiveness in regulating gene transcription and/or modifies the ensemble of regulated genes (Majdan and Shatz, 2006Majdan M. Shatz C.J. Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 650-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Trichostatin treatment, which promotes histone acetylation in the visual cortex, also enhances adult visual cortical plasticity (Putignano et al., 2007Putignano E. Lonetti G. Cancedda L. Ratto G. Costa M. Maffei L. Pizzorusso T. Neuron. 2007; 53: 747-759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Similarly, EE in adult rats promotes recovery from a pathological reduction in visual acuity arising from a defective visual experience during development (amblyopia) (Sale et al., 2007Sale A. Maya Vetencourt J.F. Medini P. Cenni M.C. Baroncelli L. De Pasquale R. Maffei L. Nat Neurosci. 2007; (in press. Published online April 29, 2007)https://doi.org/10.1038/nn1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Monocular deprivation during the critical period causes strong modifications in visual cortical circuits and leads to loss of vision in the deprived eye. While visual acuity recovers if normal vision is restored to the deprived eye during the critical period, very little recovery is observed in adult animals. Sale et al. showed that when they reopened the deprived eye in adult rats and exposed these amblyopic animals to EE, these rats recovered normal visual acuity in the formerly deprived eye. The effects of enrichment seemed to be mediated by a reduction in the intracortical inhibitory tone in the visual cortex: EE animals showed a reduction in GABA release, while enhancing GABA action by diazepam infusion into the visual cortex prevented EE-induced recovery of visual acuity. This recovery was also associated with modulation of other factors known to be involved in visual cortical plasticity (e.g., BDNF and extracellular matrix components, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans [CSPGs]; Pizzorusso et al., 2002Pizzorusso T. Medini P. Berardi N. Chierzi S. Fawcett J.W. Maffei L. Science. 2002; 298: 1248-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). In particular, BDNF was shown to be upregulated in the visual cortex of enriched animals, and the assembly of CSPGs in perineuronal nets (PNNs) was reduced (Sale et al., 2007Sale A. Maya Vetencourt J.F. Medini P. Cenni M.C. Baroncelli L. De Pasquale R. Maffei L. Nat Neurosci. 2007; (in press. Published online April 29, 2007)https://doi.org/10.1038/nn1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The studies on the effects of EE on memory (Fischer et al., 2007Fischer A. Sananbenesi F. Wang X. Dobbin M. Tsai L.H. Nature. 2007; 447 (Published online April 29, 2007): 178-182https://doi.org/10.1038/nature05772Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar) and adult visual cortical plasticity (Sale et al., 2007Sale A. Maya Vetencourt J.F. Medini P. Cenni M.C. Baroncelli L. De Pasquale R. Maffei L. Nat Neurosci. 2007; (in press. Published online April 29, 2007)https://doi.org/10.1038/nn1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) nicely complement each other. It is possible that the cellular and molecular mechanisms proposed to mediate the effects of EE on adult visual cortical plasticity could be upstream of the histone acetylation effects reported by Fischer et al., thus filling the gap between EE and control of chromatin remodeling. Taken together, the results of these two papers allow one to draw a tentative scenario linking EE with the activation of gene transcription programs leading to plastic changes that subserve functional recovery (Figure 2). This interpretation is strengthened by the fact that the two very different models of plasticity used in Sale et al. and Fischer et al. share two common features, sensitivity to EE and to histone acetylation. Indeed, promoting histone acetylation enhances plasticity both in the visual cortex (Putignano et al., 2007Putignano E. Lonetti G. Cancedda L. Ratto G. Costa M. Maffei L. Pizzorusso T. Neuron. 2007; 53: 747-759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and in different learning and memory systems (Fischer et al., 2007Fischer A. Sananbenesi F. Wang X. Dobbin M. Tsai L.H. Nature. 2007; 447 (Published online April 29, 2007): 178-182https://doi.org/10.1038/nature05772Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar, Alarcon et al., 2004Alarcon J.M.

Rosenfeld M.G. Mayford M. Neuron. 2004; 42: 961-972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar), as is the case for EE, which promotes recovery both in amblyopic rats and in p25 mice. This strongly suggests that epigenetic control of gene transcription through histone acetylation could be the final gate opened by EE to promote plasticity. EE has been demonstrated to be beneficial in reducing cognitive deficits and the progression of the disease in several models of neurodegenerative pathologies related to human diseases, such as Huntington's and Alzheimer's, and in preventing neurodegeneration caused by different types of insults (ischemic, traumatic) (Nithianantharajah and Hannan, 2006Nithianantharajah J. Hannan A.J. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 7: 697-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar, Berardi et al., 2007Berardi N. Braschi C. Capsoni S. Cattaneo A. Maffei L.

Sisodia S.S. Cell. 2005; 120: 701-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). In these models, many of the factors regulated by EE are neuroprotective, promote plasticity, and ameliorate behavioral and morphofunctional deficits. Could this be true also for histone acetylation? Fischer et al. provide some support for this idea by showing that histone deacetylation inhibitors allow cognitive recovery after behavioral and anatomical pathology are already established. It is hoped that studies such as these will eventually allow sufficient understanding of the EE process such that this mechanism might be exploited to its full potential as a “behavioral therapy” in humans. In addition, EE animals can be viewed as potential models to fish out molecules that mediate the beneficial effects of EE and that might someday be used to develop possible therapeutic agents for humans. It should be stressed that the Fischer et al., 2007Fischer A. Sananbenesi F. Wang X. Dobbin M. Tsai L.H. Nature. 2007; 447 (Published online April 29, 2007): 178-182https://doi.org/10.1038/nature05772Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar study does not directly address whether promoting histone acetylation might be beneficial in human neurodegenerative pathologies, given that it remains unknown whether the elegant mouse model used in their studies truly recapitulates all the features found in patients affected by neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. However, by increasing our knowledge on the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying EE's beneficial effects, papers like those discussed here pave the way for the possibility that therapeutic applications for humans may well be developed in the future."

This essential amino acid plays critical roles in many ubiquitous cellular functions including protein synthesis, biological methylation, polyamine biosynthesis, as well as in the biosynthesis of the plant hormone ethylene and in some bacteria, quorum sensing. The biosynthesis of methionine is energetically costly, and the need for sufficient methionine has driven the evolution of methionine salvage pathways (1Sufrin J.R. Meshnick S.R. Spiess A.J.

Although the pathway is ubiquitous in almost all organisms, some metabolic variations are found in the pathways between mammals, plants, microbes, and certain parasitic protozoa. A key metabolic difference between mammals and prokaryotic pathogens is the absolute requirement for mtnK (2Sekowska A. Denervaud V. Ashida H. Michoud K. Haas D. Yokota A. Danchin A.

MTR kinase is regulated by the environmental methionine level (4Tower P.A. Alexander D.B. Johnson L.L. Riscoe M.K. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 1027-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and its expression enables organisms to grow on non-methionine sulfur sources such as MTR or 5′-methylthioadenosine (MTA) (5Riscoe M.K.

MTA is a byproduct and inhibitor of polyamine synthesis (8Sekowska A. Danchin A. BMC Microbiol. 2002; 2: 8Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and hence is toxic to cells and must be rapidly degraded. In various microbes, plants, and certain protozoa, MTA is degraded by MTA nucleosidase into MTR and adenine. MTR kinase then catalyzes the phosphorylation of MTR to MTR 1-phosphate, which is subsequently converted to methionine via a series of intermediates (8Sekowska A. Danchin A. BMC Microbiol. 2002; 2: 8Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 9Murphy B.A. Grundy F.J. Henkin T.M. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2314-2318Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, however, the degradation of MTA and its conversion to MTR 1-phosphate is achieved in a single step by MTA phosphorylase (10Pegg A.E. Williams-Ashman H.G. Biochem. J. 1969; 115: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). This metabolic difference in the way MTA is removed has been explored and analogs of MTR, synthesized as pro-drugs, have been shown to selectively kill MTR kinase-containing organisms with little effect on mammalian cells (5Riscoe M.K.

The modern rational approach to new drug discovery includes structure-based drug design, which requires a detailed understanding of the structure of the target enzyme and its catalytic mechanism and substrate specificity. Thus, three-dimensional structures of MTR kinase with and without substrates are indispensable for the development of specific antibiotics targeting this enzyme. To this end, we present the first structural analysis of MTR kinase in its apo form and in complex with ADP, ADP-PO4, AMPPCP, and AMPPCP-MTR. Structure Determination of MTR Kinase Using Ho-MAD Phasing—Bacillus subtilis MTR kinase (gi:37999472) was expressed, purified, and crystallized as described previously (12Ku S.Y. Yip P. Cornell K.A. Riscoe M.K. Howell P.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 116-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The crystals were derivatized by soaking the crystals for 3 days in 2 mm HoCl3, 25% (w/v) PEG2000MME, 25% (v/v) ethylene glycol, 0.3 m sodium acetate, and 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.8. The holmium derivative was flash frozen in a nitrogen stream at 110 K, and a MAD dataset was collected around the LIII edge of Ho to 2.5 Å resolution at Station X8C, National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS), Brookhaven National Laboratory. The peak and inflection data were processed using HKL2000 (13Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Smith G.D. Howell P.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2007; 63: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The MTRK-ADP-Ho complex (21Ku S.Y. Smith G.D. Howell P.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2007; 63: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) was used as the initial model for the refinement of other MTR kinase structures: the apo-MTR kinase (MTRK), the ADP-magnesium complex (MTRK-ADP), the ADP-magnesium phosphate complex (MTRK-ADP-PO4), the AMPPCP-magnesium complex (MTRK-AMPPCP), and the AMPPCP-magnesium, substrate MTR complex (MTRK-AMPPCP-MTR). Structure Determination of Apo-MTR Kinase and Its Substrate Complexes—Crystals of apo-MTRK were grown as described previously (12Ku S.Y. Yip P. Cornell K.A. Riscoe M.K. Howell P.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 116-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The MTRK-ADP and the MTRK-AMPPCP complexes were prepared by overnight soaking of MTRK crystals in 25% (w/v) PEG2000MME, 0.3 m sodium acetate, 20 mm magnesium acetate, and either 4 mm ADP or AMPPCP (sodium salt). The MTRK-AMPPCP-MTR complex was prepared by soaking the MTRK crystals in 25% (w/v) PEG2000MME, 0.3 m sodium acetate, 20 mm magnesium acetate, 4 mm AMPPCP, and 2 mm MTR for 2 h. The substrate MTR was synthesized by hydrolysis of MTA as described previously (22Schlenk F. Zydek-Cwick C.R. Dainko J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 320: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We also attempted, by co-crystallization, to determine the structure of an MTRK-ATP complex. In this case 10 mm ATP (sodium salt) and 2 mm MgCl2 were added to the apo-MTRK protein solution prior to crystallizing the mixture as described for apo-MTRK (12Ku S.Y. Yip P. Cornell K.A. Riscoe M.K. Howell P.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 116-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Due to hydrolysis of the ATP by the enzyme, ADP, rather than ATP, was observed in each of the active sites (see below). Crystals of the complexes were soaked in 25% (v/v) ethylene glycol, 25% (w/v) PEG2000MME, 0.3 m sodium acetate for 30 s and flash frozen at 110 K. All data were collected using CuKα x-radiation from an RU-H3R rotating anode generator, Osmic optics, and R-AXIS IV++ image plate detector, and processed using d*TREK (14Pflugrath J.W.

Two TLS groups per subunit (residues 1-120 and 121-397) were defined and the TLS tensor was refined using Refmac in the CCP4 program suite (26Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr.

The final B. subtilis structural models of apo-MTRK, MTRK-ADP, MTRK-AMPPCP, and MTRK-AMPPCP-MTR have R/Rfree factors of 20.0/25.2% (2.1 Å), 19.9/24.9% (2.2 Å), 20.4/23.8% (2.0 Å), and 20.2/25.5% (2.3 Å), respectively. Co-crystallization of ATP with the protein resulted in electron density compatible with ADP molecules rather than ATP in both active sites of the protein. In both monomers spherical density was also observed in the σA weighted Fo - Fc map just below the position that the γ-phosphate of ATP would have occupied if ATP was present. A water molecule was initially modeled in both monomers but in monomer B, the B-factor for the water refined to a very small value while still showing positive density of >3σ in the Fo - Fc difference map. A phosphate ion was therefore modeled in place of this water molecule. The phosphate has higher B-factors than its neighboring atoms suggesting that it is not present at full occupancy. Reduced occupancy for the phosphate is supported by the observation that when its occupancy was set to 0.5, its B-factor refined to about half of those of the neighboring atoms. During the refinement of the phosphate we have fixed the occupancy at 1 and have refined its B-factor. A water molecule rather than a phosphate ion is modeled in monomer A because, although visible, the density for a phosphate ion is less convincing than that observed in monomer B. The final co-crystallized MTRK-ADP-PO4 complex has R/Rfree factors of 21.1/27.4% (2.6 Å). Data, refinement, and structure validation statistics for the five MTR kinase structures are summarized in Table 1. A list of the disordered residues and disordered side chains in the five structures is provided in the supplementary material (Table S1). All figures were prepared using PyMOL (29DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar). Overall Fold and Quaternary Structure—The structure of B. subtilis MTR kinase has a bilobal architecture consisting of a smaller N-terminal lobe (N-lobe) and a larger C-terminal MTR-binding lobe (C-lobe) connected by a linker region (residue 115-120) (Fig. 1A). Although about 30% of the N-lobe is disordered in the structures and could not be modeled (see supplementary Table S1), the backbone density clearly reveals the same fold as the N-lobe of a protein kinase. The N-lobe of MTR kinase is composed of 5 twisted anti-parallel β strands (β1-β5) flanked by two α helices (α1 and α2) in a αβββαββ topology. The larger C-lobe is predominantly α helical, with 12 α helices (α3-14) and four short 310 helices (η1-η4) along with four short β strands (β7-β10) between helices α8 and α9, and a short strand β6 at the C-terminal end of the linker region. Strand β8 forms an anti-parallel β turn with β9 and also interacts with the tip of strand β6, whereas strands β7 and β10 form a second twisted anti-parallel sheet. Together with the N-lobe, the topology profile of these anti-parallel β strands in a helical environment is also consistent with that of a protein kinase. Thus, although MTR kinase is only found in bacteria, plants, and other lower organisms, the protein has the same bilobal fold seen in eukaryotic protein kinases. The crystal structure of B. subtilis MTR kinase has two subunits in the asymmetric unit related by 2-fold non-crystallographic symmetry (Fig. 1B). The inter-subunit interactions in the dimer interface are symmetrical: there are six inter-subunit salt bridges between Lys162 and Glu178, Lys217 and Asp321, and Lys220 and Glu227; four inter-subunit main chain interactions between Thr224 and its non-crystallographic symmetry equivalent, and Ala226 and its non-crystallographic symmetry equivalent; and two inter-subunit hydrogen bonds between the carbonyl oxygen of Phe182 and the Oη oxygen of Tyr312 (Fig. 1C). Upon dimerization of MTR kinase, about 1670 Å2 of surface area is buried (30Fraternali F. Cavallo L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2950-2960Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Examination of the protein quaternary structure data base (31Henrick K. Thornton J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 358-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) reveals that this interface is larger than the interfaces found in 75% of all homodimeric kinases. The dimeric structure of B. subtilis MTR kinase is also consistent with the gel filtration profile of the 45-kDa enzyme showing an apparent molecular mass of ∼100 kDa in solution (data not shown) and previous in vitro characterization of MTR kinases from other species (32Guranowski A.

FATCAT calculates that MTR kinase has Cα root mean square deviations of 3.4 and 3.0 Å when compared with choline kinase and APH(3′)-IIIa, respectively. MTR kinase is also structurally similar to many eukaryotic protein kinases including casein kinase (38Xu R.M. Carmel G. Sweet R.M. Kuret J. Cheng X. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1015-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) (39Zheng J. Trafny E.A. Knighton D.R. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Ten Eyck L.F. Sowadski J.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1993; 49: 362-365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and G protein-coupled receptor kinase (40Lodowski D.T. Tesmer V.M. Benovic J.L. Tesmer J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16785-16793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In the structural alignment, the anti-parallel β sheet found in the N-lobe of MTR kinase, choline kinase, and APH(3′)-IIIa superimpose readily (Fig. 2C), whereas the C-lobes reveal larger structural variations that account for the diversity of the substrates catalyzed. Nevertheless, the alignment reveals “core helices” corresponding to helices α4, α6, α8, α9, α10, and α11 of MTR kinase that are common to all three proteins. Examination of the quaternary structure of MTK kinase, choline kinase, and APH(3′)-IIIa reveals that although they share a common fold, their quaternary structures are unique. MTR kinase dimerizes mainly via interactions between helices α8 (Fig. 1B), whereas choline kinase dimerizes via interactions between helices that are structurally equivalent to helix α2 of MTR kinase (Fig. 2A). APH(3′)-IIIa is held together as a dimer in the crystal structure via disulfide bonds (37Hon W.C. McKay G.A. Thompson P.R. Sweet R.M. Yang D.S. Wright G.D. Berghuis A.M. Cell. 1997; 89: 887-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B) between strand β1 and the poorly conserved region between helices α6 and α7. The quaternary structure of MTK kinase, choline kinase, and APH(3′)-IIIa differs from the catalytic domains of many protein kinase that appear to function as monomers in the absence of their regulatory domains (38Xu R.M. Carmel G. Sweet R.M. Kuret J. Cheng X. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1015-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 41Zhao B. Bower M.J. McDevitt P.J. Zhao H. Davis S.T. Johanson K.O. Green S.M.

Nucleotide-binding Site—Overall the nucleotide-binding site is relatively unperturbed between the apo, ADP, ADP-PO4, AMPPCP, and AMPPCP-MTR bound MTR kinase structures (Fig. 3A) and the residues in the substrate binding pocket can be readily superimposed (Fig. 3B). The nucleotide binds in the cleft region between the two lobes of the MTR kinase, making extensive interactions with residues from both lobes as well as with residues from the linker region (residue 115-120). The adenine ring of the nucleotide binds near the linker region in a hydrophobic pocket consisting of residues Val46, Ile59, Met114, Leu117, Phe240, and Ile249 (Fig. 3B). Only the hydrophobicity of these residues is conserved across species. Besides these hydrophobic interactions, the adenine ring is also held by two hydrogen bonds: one from the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Glu115 to the N-6 amino nitrogen of the adenine, and the other from the amide nitrogen of Leu117 to the N-1 nitrogen (Fig. 4). A structurally conserved water molecule donates two hydrogen bonds to the nucleotide: one to the N-7 nitrogen of the adenine ring and the second to the O-1 oxygen of the α phosphoryl group of the nucleotide (Fig. 4). This water molecule is observed in all but the lowest resolution MTRK-ADP-PO4 structure. In all nucleotide complexes, the O-1 oxygen atoms of the α phosphoryl group of the nucleotide also interact via ionic interactions with the Nζ nitrogen of the strictly conserved Lys61 (Fig. 4), which in turn forms a salt bridge with the Oϵ carboxyl oxygen of Glu84 from helix α2.FIGURE 4Active site of B. subtilis MTR kinase. A and B, schematic diagram showing the non-hydrophobic interactions between the ligands and the protein (in A) the MTRK-ADP and MTRK-ADP-PO4 complexes and the MTRK-AMPPCP and MTRK-AMPPCP-MTR complexes (in B). In A, the nucleotide and protein are presented as sticks with C, N, O, and P atoms colored green, blue, red, and magenta, respectively. In B, C atoms are colored in cyan. Magnesium ions and water molecules are shown as yellow and blue spheres, respectively. The distances, in Å, are the average of four monomers with the standard deviations given in square brackets. The water molecule in A is not clearly observed in the MTRK-ADP-PO4 complex thus the distances given refer to those in chain A of the MTRK-ADP complex; distances in chain B are given in brackets. In B, the distances between MTR and the protein refer to those in chain A of the MTRK-AMPPCP-MTR complex; distances in chain B are given in brackets. The water labeled in gray in B does not have a conserved position in all structures although its distance to Mg(1) is comparable. For consistency between the two panels, some distances >3 Å are also depicted but are shown in light gray. Residues that are part of the G-loop are labeled green. The side chain of Asp40 is only visible in monomers A of MTRK-AMPPCP and MTRK-AMPPCP-MTR complexes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Apparent Lack of Lobe Movement—The apparent rigidity of the nucleotide-binding site between the two lobes of MTR kinase is supported by the lack of interactions between the ribosyl moiety of the nucleotide and residues from C-lobe. In PKA, nucleotide binding induces lobe closure. Interactions between residues in the C-lobe of PKA and the bound nucleotide have been defined as “closure-inducing residues” as these interactions produce a torque about the hinge axis and drive lobe closure (42Hayward S. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 339: 1001-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The most important closure-inducing residue in PKA is Glu127, which is located on the C-lobe and interacts with both ribosyl hydroxyl oxygens of ATP (39Zheng J. Trafny E.A. Knighton D.R. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Ten Eyck L.F. Sowadski J.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1993; 49: 362-365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). No residue in MTR kinase plays an equivalent role. A general problem associated with every crystal structure is that crystal-packing forces can occasionally lock the protein into a single conformation, open or closed. Whereas the presence of lobe or domain movement is perhaps easier to identify given two structures with different conformations, proving that no lobe movement occurs is more challenging. Additional evidence that supports our hypothesis that the lack of lobe closure observed between apo-MTRK and the various complexes is not the result of crystal packing, but relevant to the function of the protein, is as follows. First, B. subtilis MTR kinase in the absence of detergent crystallizes in a different space group (12Ku S.Y. Yip P. Cornell K.A. Riscoe M.K. Howell P.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 116-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) with different surfaces involved in the packing interactions. Despite the differences in packing environments no major structural differences occur as a result of the different crystal contacts. Second, we have recently determined the structure of Arabidopsis thaliana MTR kinase complexed with ADP and MTR. 4S.-Y. Ku, K. A. Cornell, and P. L. Howell, manuscript in preparation. This co-crystal structure packs in yet another space group and reveals that the plant enzyme has the same conformation as the apo and complexed forms of the bacterial enzyme. Third, soaking (data not shown) and co-crystallization of B. subtilis MTRK with ATP produced in both cases ADP rather than ATP in the active site. For the soaking experiment this suggests that MTR kinase is active in the crystalline state and that ATP hydrolysis can occur without disrupting the crystal lattice. If significant inter-lobal movement was required for ATP binding or hydrolysis, and this movement was prevented by crystal contacts, one would have expected the crystals to shatter during the soaking experiment. The similarity of the ADP-PO4 (co-crystallized) and ADP (produced by soaking ADP) complexes also supports our hypothesis that no lobe movement occurs because, regardless of when hydrolysis of the ATP occurred, crystal-packing forces could not have influenced the conformation of the protein complex prior to its incorporation into the lattice. As the nucleotide-binding site of MTR kinase comprises residues from both lobes as well as the linker region, and the entire active site is readily superimposable in all MTRK structures determined to date (Fig. 3), current structural data suggests that unlike protein kinases, but comparable with APH(3′)-IIIa, MTRK does not undergo large lobe movement upon ATP binding, ATP hydrolysis, and ADP release. The Gly-rich Loop—A Gly-rich motif or G-loop is found between β-strands β1 and β2 in the N-lobe of MTR kinase. The G-loop of MTR kinase has a highly conserved GXGNXN motif (residue 39-44), although the last residue, Asn44, is not structurally in the loop but located on strand β2 according to DSSP (see supplemental Fig. S1). The G-loop is structurally analogous to the “nucleotide positioning loop” in APH(3′)-IIIa (44Thompson P.R. Boehr D.D. Berghuis A.M. Wright G.D. Bioch"

Herein, we describe a new form of 6-phosphofructokinase (Pfk) present in several Pichia species, which is composed of three different types of subunit, α, β, and γ. The sequence of the γ subunit shows no similarity to classic Pfk subunits or to other known protein sequences. In-depth structural and functional studies revealed that the γ subunit is a constitutive component of Pfk from Pichia pastoris (PpPfk). Analyses of the purified PpPfk suggest a heterododecameric assembly from the three different subunits. Accordingly, it is the largest and most complex Pfk identified yet. Although, the γ subunit is not required for enzymatic activity, the γ subunit-deficient mutant displays a decreased growth on nutrient limitation and reduced cell flocculation when compared with the P. pastoris wild-type strain. Subsequent characterization of purified Pfks from wild-type and γ subunit-deficient strains revealed that the allosteric regulation of the PpPfk by ATP, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, and AMP is fine-tuned by the γ subunit. Therefore, we suggest that the γ subunit contributes to adaptation of P. pastoris to energy resources.

The Pfk activity is generally being sensitive to a number of allosteric regulators, e.g. ATP, AMP, NH4+, and fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (Fru 2,6-P2). Therefore, this irreversible reaction is considered to be one of the rate-limiting steps of glycolysis (1Hofmann E. Rev. Physiol. Biochem.

Most eukaryotic Pfks are heteromeric enzymes consisting of subunits, which evolved from a single ancestor gene by gene duplication and mutational events (4Poorman R.A. Randolph A. Kemp R.G.

In eukaryotes the N-terminal half of a Pfk subunit obviously retained the catalytic function, whereas in the C-terminal half allosteric ligand binding sites have evolved from former catalytic and regulatory sites (4Poorman R.A.

This assumption is supported by studies with mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing only the α or the β subunit of Pfk. It was demonstrated that one subunit type alone is able to form an enzymatically active Pfk entity in vivo (10Heinisch J. Curr.

Crystallographic analysis showed that an active bacterial Pfk consists of four identical subunits (12Evans P.R. Farrants G.W. Hudson P.J. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol.

No high resolution structure of a eukaryotic Pfk is available yet. But electron microscopic studies with S. cerevisiae Pfk (ScPfk) at 10.8-Å resolution suggested an octameric enzyme assembly (14Ruiz T. Mechin I. Baör J. Rypniewski W. Kopperschlaöger G. Radermacher M. J. Struct. Biol. 2003; 143: 124-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Recently we co-purified a protein component together with the known Pfk α and β subunits (15Yuan W. Tuttle D.L. Shi Y.J. Ralph G.S. Dunn W.A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1935-1945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kirchberger J. Baör J. Schellenberger W. Dihazi H. Kopperschlaöger G.

Yeast. 2002; 19: 949-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) from the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. This unknown protein could only be separated under denaturating conditions and with loss of Pfk activity. Herein, we present the sequence of the co-purified component and describe this new protein as a constitutively bound and regulatory relevant subunit of Pfk from P. pastoris (PpPfk) and other Pichia sp. Based on the molecular mass of the native PpPfk and the molar ratio and the molecular mass of the individual subunits we propose an enzyme complex formed of four α, β, and γ subunits. Yeast Strains and Growth Conditions—Strains used for isolation of nucleic acids and for analysis of Pfk proteins are summarized in supplemental Table S1. Yeast cells were cultivated in YP medium (1% yeast extract and 2% BactoPepton) containing 2% glucose or 0.5% methanol at 30 °C under rotation up to the growth phase as indicated. Minimal medium containing 0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, and 2% glucose supplemented with adenine and amino acids but lacking uracil was used as selective medium. All biochemicals for cell cultivation were purchased from Difco (BD Biosciences) and Invitrogen. Preparation of Cell-free Extract and Assays—Cell-free extract was prepared according to Schwock et al. (18Schwock J. Kirchberger J. Edelmann A. Kriegel T.M. Kopperschlaöger G. Yeast. 2004; 21: 483-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar).

For kinetic studies a Pfk assay with simultaneous ATP and Fru 6-P regeneration (100 mm imidazole/HCl, pH 6.6, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm potassium phosphate, 0.2 mm NADH+, 0.6 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 8.5 units of pyruvate kinase/ml, 7 units of lactate dehydrogenase/ml, 1 unit of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase/ml; ATP, Fru 6-P, AMP, and Fru 2,6-P2 as indicated) was used (16Kirchberger J.

A two-state Monod-Wyman-Changeux model was applied to describe the ATP velocity curves under the assumptions: 1) an octameric allosteric mode, 2) AMP and Fru 2,6-P2 binding to the R-state enzyme only, and 3) ATP serves as substrate ( KSATP) in a hyperbolic manner, but acts also as allosteric inhibitor ( KTATP), V=V×[ATP](KSATP+[ATP])×11+L L=(m0×(1+[ATP]/KTATP)(1+[AMP]/KRAMP)×(1+[Fru2,6−P2]/KRFru2,6−P2)) where V is maximum activity, m0 is the allosteric constant, KSATP is the ATP Michaelis constant, KTATP is the ATP-binding constant of the T-state enzyme, and KRAMP and KRFru2,6−P2 are AMP and Fru 2,6-P2 binding constants of the R-state enzyme. For description of the Fru 6-P velocity curves and the dependence of Pfk activity on AMP and Fru 2,6-P2 concentrations, a generalized Hill equation was used, V=V0+(Vmax−V0)×([X]/KAXjbcnH(1+([X]/KAXjbcnH where X is Fru 6-P, AMP or Fru 2,6-P2, and KXA is the half-activity constant. The kinetic data were fitted to Equations 1-3 by non-linear regression analysis applying SigmaPlot 9.0 (Systat Software, Inc., San Jose, CA) that uses the Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm for minimization. Alcohol oxidase activity was measured in a reaction coupled to horseradish peroxidase and the oxidation of 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (Sigma-Aldrich) in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, at 25 °C according to the company’s technical information. For determination of protein concentrations, the procedure of Bradford (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) was applied using bovine serum albumin as standard. Purification of Pfk from P. pastoris and Protein Sequencing—Pfk was isolated from cell-free extract of P. pastoris strain MH458 as described previously (16Kirchberger J. Baör J. Schellenberger W. Dihazi H. Kopperschlaöger G. Yeast. 2002; 19: 933-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). N-terminal sequences of polypeptides were determined according to the Edman procedure using the Protein Sequencer 473A (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Tryptic in-gel digestion and MALDI mass spectrometry measurements of the generated tryptic peptides were carried out as described previously (20Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7831) Google Scholar). The mass spectrometric measurements were performed on a Bruker Reflex MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonik, Bremen, Germany) equipped with an ion gate and pulsed ion extraction. Post source decay fragment ion spectra were obtained by using the FAST method (Bruker Daltonik). Generation of a Polyclonal Antibody against the γ Subunit of PpPfk—Subunits of purified Pfk from P. pastoris strain MH458 were separated under reducing conditions by SDS-PAGE. The γ subunit was cut out, destained in 10% acetic acid containing 40% methanol at 4 °C, and extracted by electroelution (Electro-Eluter Model 422, Bio-Rad). Then, the protein was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 50 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.0). 200 μg of antigen in complete Freund’s adjuvant (0.5-ml final volume) was used for rabbit immunization. After 5 weeks the animal was boosted in the same way. Antiserum was fractionated by 50% ammonium sulfate saturation. The precipitated protein was dialyzed against 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and loaded onto a protein-A-Sepharose CL-4B column (Amersham Biosciences). The antibody was eluted with 100 mm citrate buffer, pH 3.0, neutralized with 1 m Tris/HCl, pH 9.0, precipitated with ammonium sulfate, and dissolved in PBS. For affinity purification, purified PpPfk was covalently coupled with bromocyan-activated Sepharose 4B as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). After washing with PBS, the antibody was eluted with 3 m MgCl2, dialyzed alternate against 155 mm NaCl and PBS, and stored at -20 °C. Protein concentration was calculated according to A1cm,1mg/ml279nm=1.35 (21Kirschenbaum D.M. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 237-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Cloning of PpPFK3 Encoding the γ Subunit—Touchdown PCR was carried out with genomic DNA as template and HotStarTaq™ DNA Polymerase (Qiagen). Furthermore, degenerate primers 4 and 14 were used, which corresponded to the identified amino acid sequences of the γ subunit (all primers are listed in supplemental Table S2). PCR was performed under the following conditions: Predenaturation at 95 °C for 15 min was followed by cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing beginning at 72 °C for 30 s, and elongation at 72 °C for 90 s. The annealing temperature was lowered 1 °C per cycle to 50 °C, which then was applied for annealing in the next 20 cycles. To identify the 5′- and 3′-ends, rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE)-PCR was performed as described previously (17Edelmann A. Baör J. Yeast. 2002; 19: 949-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Gene-Racer™ kit with cloned avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase, Invitrogen). PCR fragments were subcloned into pCR2.1 (the TOPOT-mTA Cloning® kit for sequencing, Invitrogen) and sequenced in both directions using the ABI PRISM® Big-Dye™ Terminators version 2.0 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems). Generation of Individual Pfk Subunit-deficient P. pastoris Strains—Pfk subunit-deficient P. pastoris strains were generated by homologous recombination. Each plasmid (pAE27, pAE28, and pAE34) harbored one of the PpPfk genes interrupted by URA3 from P. pastoris (plasmids are depicted in supplemental Fig. S1). Transformation of the P. pastoris strain JC307 his4 ura3 was performed by electroporation (P. pastoris adjustment, GenePulser Xcell, Bio-Rad). To screen mutants and to verify homologous recombination, Southern blot analyses were performed as described previously (22Edelmann A. Kruöger M. Schmid J. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2005; 43: 6164-6166Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE/Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis followed the description of Baör et al. (23Baör J. Schellenberger J. Kopperschlaöger G. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1309-1317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the exception of the use of 10% polyacrylamide gels. Polyclonal rabbit antibodies against the γ subunit of PpPfk (this work) and against the purified ScPfk (24Huse K. Kopperschlaöger G. FEBS Lett. 1983; 155: 50-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) were applied. The anti-ScPfk antibody showed strong cross-reactivity to the α and β subunits of PpPfk. Immunological detection was performed with anti-rabbit-IgG peroxidase conjugate (Dianova, Germany) and a chemiluminescent detection ECL™ Western blotting system (Amersham Biosciences-GE Healthcare). FACS Analysis and Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were characterized by FACS analysis using forward light scattering and side light scattering, reflecting cell size and cell complexity, respectively. These were recorded on linear scales. Flow cytometric analysis was performed using the FACSCalibur™ scanner equipped with CellQuest™ software (both BD Biosciences). Thus, cells were grown in YP medium containing 2% glucose to an optical density of A580 nm =∼10 and diluted 1:51 (v/v) in the respective medium. For analysis of the subcellular distribution of Pfk protein by immunofluorescence microscopy, P. pastoris cells (A580 nm ≈ 1) were processed according to Pringle et al. (25Pringle J.R. Adams A.E. Drubin D.G. Haarer B.K. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 565-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies against Pfk subunits (see SDS-PAGE/Western blot analysis) were used for specific protein detection. Cy3-labeled goat anti-rabbit-IgG antibody (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) 200-fold (v/v) diluted with PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin was applied as secondary antibody. Nucleus staining was performed with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindol (1 μg/ml in PBS, Serva, Heidelberg, Germany) at room temperature for 5 min. Fluorescence images were obtained with a fluorescence microscope (Leica DM 5000B, Leica Microsystems CMS GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) equipped with a 63×/1.4-0.6 oil immersion objective, a DFC350FX camera, and FW4000 software. Immunoprecipitation of PpPfk—The polyclonal antibody against the γ subunit of PpPfk (44 μl of affinity-purified IgG fraction; 0.6 μg/μl) was mixed with 200 μl of cell-free extract and stored at 4 °C for 30 min. Then, 20 mg of protein-A-agarose (wet weight, Roche Applied Science) washed with PBS were added. Following incubation at 4 °C for 3 h and centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 1 min, the gel was washed twice with ice-cold PBS. Immunoprecipitated proteins were released by incubation with 20 μl of 65 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 6.8, containing 20% Bromphenol Blue, 20% glycerol, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 2% SDS in a boiling water bath for 5 min. Protein samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Molecular Identification of a Pfk γ Subunit in P. pastoris—The protein band corresponding to the unknown polypeptide chain, which was co-purified together with the α and β subunits of PpPfk, was isolated from SDS-PAGE gel. Then, the N-terminal amino acid sequences of this protein and of several fragments obtained by chymotrypsin or trypsin degradation were determined by Edman procedure and MALDI-TOF post source decay analysis. Amino acid sequences identified are summarized in Table 1. Based on these results, degenerate primers were designed (supplemental Table S2). PCR and cloning techniques (see “Experimental Procedures”) revealed a genomic DNA fragment of 3113 bp containing a complete coding sequence of 1056 bp (GenBank™ accession number AY686600). The transcription start was found at -43 bp from start ATG by 5′-RACE-PCR from mRNA. The coding sequence, further referred to as PpPFK3 (according to the nomenclature of other Pfk genes), encodes a polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass of 40.8 kDa (Fig. 1). N-terminal and internal amino acid sequences of the co-purified component determined by protein sequencing were identical to the respective sequence regions of the translated open reading frame of PpPFK3. However, the potential γ subunit appears at ∼34 kDa when purified PpPfk is analyzed by SDS-PAGE (see Fig. 5). The integrity of the N- and C-terminal ends of the γ subunit isolated by SDS-PAGE (Table 1) was verified by Edman and MALDI-TOF analyses, respectively. Therefore, proteolytic modifications of this protein can be excluded. Accordingly, the discrepancy between the sequence-based calculated mass and the apparent molecular mass found by SDS-PAGE is caused by the specific migration property of the γ subunit in this electrophoresis.TABLE 1Protein sequence analysis of the γ subunit of PpPfkFragmentMolecular mass, mono[M + H]+Putative sequenceaNumbers in parentheses represent amino acid position.DaEDMAN sequencingbPurified PpPfk from P. pastoris strain MH458 was subjected to SDS-PAGE.

Open table in a new tab FIGURE 5Limited proteolysis of purified PpPfk. Purified PpPfk (150 μg) was dissolved in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing 5 mm ATP (200 μl and pH 7.0). 2 μl of α-chymotrypsin (0.2 mg/ml) were added, and the sample was incubated at 25 °C for 2 h. Proteolytic activity was stopped by addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm final concentration), and the sample was divided into two aliquots. One aliquot was kept for SDS-PAGE, and the other aliquot was subjected to gel filtration on an SE-HPLC BioSelect SEC400 column (Bio-Rad) using 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 150 mm NaCl. Gel filtration yielded a main protein fraction of ∼900 kDa. This fraction was concentrated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (lane 4) together with the non-size-fractionated chymotrypsin-modified PpPfk (lane 3) and the undigested PpPfk (lane 2). Precision Plus Protein Unstained Standard (Bio-Rad) was used as molecular mass standard. Proteins were stained with Coo-massie Blue R250.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Extensive sequence analyses with various bioinformatic tools (NCBI Blast analyses, Predict-Protein, ELM) revealed no significant sequence similarity to any sequence deposit in GenBank™ (last analysis February, 27, 2007). Within the cloned genomic 5′ non-coding region (∼2000 bp) we identified putative consensus sequences for GCR1. This transcription factor is involved in specific regulatory mechanisms for glycolytic gene expression (26Clifton D. Weinstock S.B. Fraenkel D.G. Genetics. 1978; 88: 1-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Holland M.J. Yokoi T. Holland J.P. Myambo K. Innis M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In addition, an incomplete open reading frame of a hypothetical protein was detected. It shows sequence homology to the hypothetical proteins CAHO2429.1 and DEHAOCO3872.g from Kluyveromyces lactis (8/324 = 27%) and from Debaryomyces hansenii CBS767 (111/311 = 35%), respectively. Screening Other Yeasts for the Presence of the Pfk γ Subunit—To address the question whether the γ subunit is unique to P. pastoris, several other yeasts (supplemental Table S1) were initially screened for immuno-cross-reactivity by Western blot analysis. For this purpose, we used the polyclonal antibody against the PpPfk γ subunit. Whereas different P. pastoris strains and several other Pichia species displayed an immunoreactive band between 34 and 42 kDa, all extracts of distantly related yeasts (see supplemental Table S1) showed no specific immunoreactivity (data not shown). Next, PCR was applied to amplify ortholog sequences using degenerate primer sets designed on the basis of the γ subunit sequence from P. pastoris strain MH458. So far, the presence of a γ subunit was verified in P. pastoris strains JC307 and GS115, and in P. pseudopastoris (GenBank™ accession numbers DQ352840, DQ374390, and DQ386148). The γ subunits from GS115 are identical and show 95.4% amino acid identity to the γ subunit of P. pastoris strain MH458. The γ subunit of P. pseudopastoris, a species closely related to P. pastoris (28Dlauchy D. Tornai-Lehoczki J. Fulop L. Peter G. Antonie Van. Leeuwenhoek. 2003; 83: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), displays 79.8% identity at the amino acid level to the γ subunits from P. pastoris strains. Generation and Functional Characterization of γ Subunit-deficient P. pastoris Strains—To analyze the relevance of the γ subunit, three P. pastoris mutants were generated by deletion of PpPFK3. Correct recombination and gene deletion were confirmed by Southern and Western blot analyses (supplemental Fig. S2). The transformed recipient P. pastoris strain, which contained the Ura3 marker gene homologously integrated at the endogenous ura3 locus but still maintained an intact PpPFK3 locus, served as proper control (further referred to as wild-type strain). First, basic cell functions of the three γ subunit-deficient strains were studied. Since these strains behaved identically in all experiments, data are exemplarily shown for JC307-22ΔPpPFK3 (further referred to as γ subunit-deficient strain). Growth of the γ subunit-deficient strain was significantly reduced by 20% after 22 h of cultivation (Fig. 2A). This effect was found also under cultivation in a continuously oxygenized atmosphere. Deletion of the γ subunit did not interfere with the specific Pfk activity in cell-free extracts (Fig. 2B). Wild-type and γ subunit-deficient strains were able to grow on medium containing glycerol, rhamnose, or cycloheximide. This was determined by cultivation on pre-made culture plates (ID32C bioMerieux system) at 30 °C for 4 days (data not shown). Temperature sensitivity and NaCl tolerance were also indistinguishable between the strains (supplemental Fig. S3). Further, we analyzed the adaptation ability of the mutant and wild-type strains to glucose-containing medium after cultivation on methanol. In both cases a 50% reduction of alcohol oxidase activity over 3 h was observed (supplemental Fig. S4A) as a result of induced degradation of peroxisomes (microautophagy) (15Yuan W. Tuttle D.L. Shi Y.J. Ralph G.S. Dunn W.A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1935-1945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Sakai Y. Koller A. Rangell L.K. Keller G.A. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). This was accompanied by a 50% increase in Pfk activity (supplemental Fig. S4B). Further, the strains were tested for endocytosis and vacuolar morphology by in vivo labeling (30Vida T.A. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 779-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). For this purpose we used the fluorescent lipophilic dye FM1-43 (Molecular probes, Brussels, Belgium). FM1-43 internalization from the plasma membrane into endosomes and vacuolar membranes was indistinguishable between mutant and wild-type strains (supplemental Fig. S5). Although most of the phenotypes of the wild-type and the γ subunit-deficient strains were very similar, cells of the wild-type strain show remarkable flocculation with increasing cell density. The cells started to adhere at the middle log growth phase. The formed macroscopic flocs rapidly sedimented when continuous shaking was stopped. This phenotype was greatly reduced in γ subunit-deficient strains (Fig. 3). We observed that cell-cell adhesion in the wild-type strain was abolished in the presence of 2 mm EDTA but occurred again after the addition of 5 mm Ca2+. Adhesion of cells lacking the γ subunit was also induced by addition of Ca2+ but to a lesser extent (data not shown). Differences in the cellular structure of the γ subunit-deficient and the wild-type strains were also reflected by FACS analysis (supplemental Fig. S6). Kinetic Properties of the Wild-type and γ Subunit-deficient PpPfks—Because the γ subunit is not essential for the catalytic function of PpPfk per se (see above), we initiated an in-depth kinetic analysis of PpPfks purified from wild-type and γ subunit-deficient strains (Tables 2 and 3).TABLE 2Comparison of kinetic properties of purified Pfks from P. pastoris wild type and γ subunit-deficient strainsParameterPpPfkPpPfkWild typeγ-DeficientWithout effectoraMeasurement was carried out at 3 mm ATP.KFru 6-P0.5 (mm)2.17 ± 0.142.29 ± 0.18nFru 6-PH (mm)2.30 ± 0.102.00 ± 0.10Plus 1 mm AMPaMeasurement was carried out at 3 mm ATP.KFru 6-P0.5 (mm)0.17 ± 0.030.23 ± 0.03nFru 6-PH (mm)1.30 ± 0.101.10 ± 0.10Plus 20 μm Fru 2,6-P2aMeasurement was carried out at 3 mm ATP.KFru 6-P0.5 (mm)0.28 ± 0.020.33 ± 0.03nFru 6-PH (mm)1.20 ± 0.101.00 ± 0.10Half-activation constants of allosteric effectorsbMeasurement was carried out at 0.3 mm Fru 6-P and 3 mM ATP.KFru 2,6-P2A (μm)16.10 ± 1.1014.10 ± 1.00nFru 2,6-P2H (μm)1.20 ± 0.101.00 ± 0.10KAMPA (mm)0.12 ± 0.010.14 ± 0.02nAMPH (mm)1.60 ± 0.101.20 ± 0.10Inhibition by 5 mm ATPcData were obtained by measuring at 0.3 mm Fru 6-P without allosteric activator.Residual Pfk activity<0.05<0.05a Measurement was carr"

A key question in brain development is how migration of neuronal precursors is guided to establish the ordered laminar layers. In the April 20, 2007 issue of Cell, Guan et al. show that the leading process of migrating cerebellar granule neurons senses repulsive Slit molecules by generating a Ca2+ wave that propagates to the soma to cause reversal of cell polarity and migration. Guided migration of immature neurons from their birthplace to the final destination constitutes the basis for highly ordered cytoarchitecture, specific synaptic connectivity, and complex function of the nervous system (Bronner-Fraser, 1994Bronner-Fraser M. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 699-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, Hatten, 1999Hatten M.E. Annu. Rev.

USA. 1995; 92: 11323-11327Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that several axon guidance molecules are also involved in directing neuronal migration, suggesting that the same set of membrane receptors and cytoplasmic transduction mechanisms may be used for these two forms of neuronal motility (Ayala et al., 2007Ayala R. Shu T. Tsai L.H. Cell. 2007; 128: 29-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Most of the migrating neurons exhibit a highly polarized morphology with a leading and a trailing neurite process. Directed movement of the neuron typically requires three distinct steps: extension of the leading process, translocation of the soma and nucleus, and retraction of the trailing process. The leading process has a growth-cone-like motile tip similar to the axonal growth cone and is responsible for the process' extension. Successful migration of the cell also requires the translocation of the soma, which involves the detachment of the somal adhesion to the substrate and movement of the nucleus (“nucleokinesis”) and other cytoplasmic organelles, and perhaps uses mechanisms distinct from those operating at the growth cone. In vitro observations of cultured cerebellar granule cells indicate that both the leading growth cone and the soma exhibit saltatory, but coordinated, advancement (Hatten, 1999Hatten M.E. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 511-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). However, two different modes of neuronal migration have been observed in vivo, one relying primarily on somal translocation, with its long leading process remaining attached to the pial surface, and the other involving coordinated movement of the short leading process and soma (Ayala et al., 2007Ayala R. Shu T. Tsai L.H. Cell. 2007; 128: 29-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Therefore, the extension of the leading process and the somal translocation may be differentially coupled in different modes of migration. How does a migrating neuron detect extracellular cues? If only the leading growth cone is responsible for the signal detection, a long-range signaling mechanism between the growth cone and the soma is required for proper coordination of the motility of these two distant parts of the neuron. Furthermore, coordinated retraction of the trailing process, as the cell advances, must involve actin-based contractile machinery and degradation of the adhesion complex, as suggested by studies of nonneuronal cell migration (Horwitz and Parsons, 1999Horwitz A.R. Parsons J.T. Science. 1999; 286: 1102-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, Sheetz et al., 1998Sheetz M.P. Felsenfeld D.P. Galbraith C.G. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 51-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). In a study in the April 20, 2007 issue of Cell, Poo and his collaborators have tackled these questions using an elegant culture system in which potential guidance molecules can be delivered to different parts of the migrating cerebellar granule cell in the dish (Guan et al., 2007Guan C.B. Xu H.T. Jin M. Yuan X.B. Poo M.M. Cell. 2007; 129: 385-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). They present compelling imaging data demonstrating that the growth cone of the leading process senses Slit gradients by generating a Ca2+ wave that propagates to the soma, triggering the repolarization of the granule cell morphology and the reversal of migration direction. Cerebellar granule neurons in culture display a bipolar morphology with spontaneous movement following a leading process. To test which part or parts of the neuron sense extracellular cues, the authors employed local application of Slit-2, a repulsive molecule for axons and migrating neurons, to the tip of the leading edge (frontal), the soma, or the trailing process. The authors found that only frontal Slit-2 application caused the leading edge to collapse, which was followed by reversal of the cell polarity and migration. Specifically, the direction of somal translocation was reversed and, interestingly, the original trailing process assumed a growth cone morphology and exhibited active motility. Using high-resolution ratiometric Ca2+ imaging, the authors determined that frontal Slit application elicited a local elevation of intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in the growth cone that gradually propagated as a wave to the soma (Figure 1). Using bath application of high concentrations of ryanodine to block Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR), the authors demonstrated that Slit-2-induced Ca2+ elevation at the growth cone was slightly affected, but at the soma it was completely abolished (together with the reversal of somal translocation). Therefore, CICR mediates the propagation of a Ca2+ wave from the growth cone to the soma to induce the reversal of translocation. The requirement and sufficiency of the Ca2+ wave at the soma for reversal of migration was elegantly tested by either local blockade of CICR with high ryanodine or local activation of CICR by frontal application of a low concentration of ryanodine. These data thus provide convincing evidence that Ca2+ elevation at the soma from a Ca2+ wave emanating at the growth cone is the cause of the reversal of migration. Previous studies have established a positive correlation between the rate of cell movement and the amplitude and frequency of [Ca2+]i fluctuations in the cell body through NMDA receptors and voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, but no reversal of migration was observed (Komuro and Kumada, 2005Komuro H. Kumada T. Cell Calcium. 2005; 37: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Therefore, the reversal of somal translocation by frontal application of low concentrations of ryanodine indicates that either CICR functions distinctly from Ca2+ influx through membrane depolarization or that the Ca2+ wave carries the directional instructions in a spatiotemporal pattern. The lack of high-resolution imaging applied to investigate the spatiotemporal pattern of [Ca2+]i in the soma during reversal leaves this question open. Another important conclusion from the study by Guan et al., 2007Guan C.B. Xu H.T. Jin M. Yuan X.B. Poo M.M. Cell. 2007; 129: 385-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar is that growth cone behavior and somal translocation are independent, and in this regard, it is important to show that the growth cone collapse is not linked to the reversal of somal translocation. Otherwise, one might suspect that the reversal of migration may simply result from growth cone collapse of the leading process, which would force the neuron to reverse the direction. The separation between growth cone and somal responses is supported by the finding that local blockade of CICR in the soma (by high concentrations of ryanodine) blocked the reversal of somal translocation without affecting the growth cone collapse induced by frontal Slit-2 application. The most convincing piece of evidence comes from the frontal application of low concentrations of ryanodine, after which both the growth cone and soma exhibited a similar elevation of Ca2+ through CICR and the soma reversed its direction of translocation, but no apparent collapse of the leading process was observed. Therefore, Slit-2 molecules appear to trigger to two distinct effects: the large elevation of [Ca2+]i that is responsible for collapse and the initiation of a Ca2+ wave through CICR that propagates to the soma and causes the reversal of translocation. While the mechanism underlying the Ca2+ elevation at the growth cone by Slit-2 remains unclear, these data demonstrate the amazing ability of Ca2+ to produce short-range and long-range effects on different parts of a neuron, which could be a key for coordinating the various cellular activities in a highly polarized neuron. What is the downstream effector or effectors of Ca2+ in the reversal of migration direction? An even more intriguing question is, “How is the trailing process transformed into a leading process during the reversal of migration?” This is particularly puzzling since the Ca2+ signals appear to only reach the soma, rather than reach all the way to the end of the trailing process (Figure 1). The authors indicate that the reversal of cell polarity and migration is mediated by the small GTPase RhoA, which is preferentially localized in the soma with accumulation toward the leading front, but then redistributed when the neuron is induced to reverse its orientation by frontal application of Slit-2 molecules. Experiments using high and low concentrations of ryanodine were performed to demonstrate that [Ca2+]i elevation at the growth cone is both necessary and sufficient to induce redistribution of RhoA expression. Finally, using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to observe active RhoA, the authors claim that the reversal of migration may also be due to the inhibition of RhoA at the frontal end and the redistribution of active RhoA. Since RhoA inhibition has been shown to actually promote nerve growth, it is unlikely that inhibition of RhoA activity halts the migration of the neuron. Rather, the redistribution of RhoA is probably involved in changing the polarity of the migrating neuron. Thus, the mechanism by which the neuron stops migrating in the forward direction and begins migrating in the reverse direction is not yet known. It also remains to be seen how the trailing process acquires the motility of a leading process during the reversal of migration. The study has clearly illustrated several intriguing and exciting findings on the role of long-range Ca2+ signaling and RhoA in repolarizing and reversing migrating neurons. However, several outstanding issues remain to be addressed, particularly those regarding the role of the cytoskeleton. For example, the mechanism by which Ca2+ waves induce the redistribution of RhoA has not been addressed by this study, although the authors propose a cortical myosin-dependent mechanism in which a front-to-rear Ca2+ gradient may cause a myosin-dependent rearward flow of cortical F-actin, thus pulling RhoA to the rear. Furthermore, the effects of the Ca2+ wave on the cytoskeletal structures in the soma were not clear. Migrating neurons have a specialized motility apparatus consisting of a perinuclear tubulin cage that holds the nucleus in the rear of the cell, an actin network around the soma, and microtubules that project to the leading process extending in the direction of migration. Recent studies also indicate that the movement of the centrosome into the leading process precedes nucleokinesis and that the centrosome coordinates cytoskeletal dynamics in response to mPar6α-PKCς and GSK3β-mediated signaling (Higginbotham and Gleeson, 2007Higginbotham H.R. Gleeson J.G. Trends Neurosci. 2007; (in press. Published online April 7, 2007.)PubMed Google Scholar, Solecki et al., 2006Solecki D.J. Govek E.E. Hatten M.E. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 10624-10625Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It would of great interest to see if the Ca2+ wave elicited by Slit-2 causes the relocation of the centrosome to the new leading process following reversal of migration (Figure 1). Clearly, further elucidation of the molecular link between the Ca2+ signals and these known cellular components involved in migration would significantly advance our knowledge of directed migration during brain development. One question that begs for answers is the in vivo relevance of the findings described by Guan et al., 2007Guan C.B. Xu H.T. Jin M. Yuan X.B. Poo M.M. Cell. 2007; 129: 385-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar. The observed migration of cerebellar granule neurons in culture more closely resembles cortical rather than cerebellar migration in vivo. Granule cells of the cerebellum first migrate tangentially in the external granule layer (EGL), then extend a T-shaped bipolar process which become the parallel fiber axons, followed by radial migration of the cell body into the internal granule layer (IGL) where the dendrites form (Komuro and Yacubova, 2003Komuro H. Yacubova E. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1084-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Radial migration of granule neurons along glial fibers involves the extension of a prominent leading process with a growth cone-like motile tip. However, the trailing processes do not retract as the cell body moves toward the IGL. The reversal of migration observed in culture almost never happens in cerebellum in vivo (Solecki et al., 2004Solecki D.J. Model L. Gaetz J. Kapoor T.M. Hatten M.E. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 1195-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the identification of the function of Slit-2 repulsion during development remains to be revealed. As Slit-2 is expressed by Purkinje cells and its receptor Robo2 by granule cells (Marillat et al., 2002Marillat V. Cases O. Nguyen-Ba-Charvet K.T. Tessier-Lavigne M. Sotelo C. Chedotal A. J. Comp. Neurol. 2002; 442: 130-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), Guan et al. suggest that the repulsive action of Slit-2 prevents the premature migration of EGL cells to the IGL. Therefore, Slit-2 may be potentially involved in controlling the transition of granule cell migration from tangential migration to radial directions. In this case, Slit-2 expression in the Purkinje cells or Robo2 expression on the granule cells would need to be downregulated at the time that the granule cells begin migrating radially. Alternatively, Slit-Robo signaling could be silenced by crosstalk with other guidance signaling pathways (Grunwald and Klein, 2002Grunwald I.C. Klein R. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2002; 12: 250-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Regardless of these outstanding questions, the exciting findings on long-range Ca2+ signaling reversing neuronal polarity and migration have opened up a door for more studies that will provide a better understanding of the developmental events that pack billions of neurons into highly organized structures for complex functions and how their failure contributes to human migration disorders. Long-Range Ca2+ Signaling from Growth Cone to Soma Mediates Reversal of Neuronal Migration Induced by Slit-2Guan et al.CellApril 20, 2007In BriefNeuronal migration and growth-cone extension are both guided by extracellular factors in the developing brain, but whether these two forms of guidance are mechanistically linked is unclear. Application of a Slit-2 gradient in front of the leading process of cultured cerebellar granule cells led to the collapse of the growth cone and the reversal of neuronal migration, an event preceded by a propagating Ca2+ wave from the growth cone to the soma. The Ca2+ wave was required for the Slit-2 effect and was sufficient by itself to induce the reversal of migration. Full-Text PDF Open Archive"
