https://openalex.org/W4307931636,"Cells respond to physical stimuli, such as stiffness1, fluid shear stress2 and hydraulic pressure3,4. Extracellular fluid viscosity is a key physical cue that varies under physiological and pathological conditions, such as cancer5. However, its influence on cancer biology and the mechanism by which cells sense and respond to changes in viscosity are unknown. Here we demonstrate that elevated viscosity counterintuitively increases the motility of various cell types on two-dimensional surfaces and in confinement, and increases cell dissemination from three-dimensional tumour spheroids. Increased mechanical loading imposed by elevated viscosity induces an actin-related protein 2/3 (ARP2/3)-complex-dependent dense actin network, which enhances Na+/H+ exchanger 1 (NHE1) polarization through its actin-binding partner ezrin. NHE1 promotes cell swelling and increased membrane tension, which, in turn, activates transient receptor potential cation vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) and mediates calcium influx, leading to increased RHOA-dependent cell contractility. The coordinated action of actin remodelling/dynamics, NHE1-mediated swelling and RHOA-based contractility facilitates enhanced motility at elevated viscosities. Breast cancer cells pre-exposed to elevated viscosity acquire TRPV4-dependent mechanical memory through transcriptional control of the Hippo pathway, leading to increased migration in zebrafish, extravasation in chick embryos and lung colonization in mice. Cumulatively, extracellular viscosity is a physical cue that regulates both short- and long-term cellular processes with pathophysiological relevance to cancer biology."

https://openalex.org/W4307985186,"The BA.2 sublineage of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant has become dominant in most countries around the world; however, the prevalence of BA.4 and BA.5 is increasing rapidly in several regions. BA.2 is less pathogenic in animal models than previously circulating variants of concern1–4. Compared with BA.2, however, BA.4 and BA.5 possess additional substitutions in the spike protein, which play a key role in viral entry, raising concerns that the replication capacity and pathogenicity of BA.4 and BA.5 are higher than those of BA.2. Here we have evaluated the replicative ability and pathogenicity of BA.4 and BA.5 isolates in wild-type Syrian hamsters, human ACE2 (hACE2) transgenic hamsters and hACE2 transgenic mice. We have observed no obvious differences among BA.2, BA.4 and BA.5 isolates in growth ability or pathogenicity in rodent models, and less pathogenicity compared to a previously circulating Delta (B.1.617.2 lineage) isolate. In addition, in vivo competition experiments revealed that BA.5 outcompeted BA.2 in hamsters, whereas BA.4 and BA.2 exhibited similar fitness. These findings suggest that BA.4 and BA.5 clinical isolates have similar pathogenicity to BA.2 in rodents and that BA.5 possesses viral fitness superior to that of BA.2. Results indicate that the sublineages BA.4 and BA.5 of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variants have similar pathogenicity to that of the BA.2 sublineage in rodents, highlighting the importance of evaluating viral replication and pathogenesis using clinical isolates."
https://openalex.org/W4307931650,"Abstract Neuropsychiatric disorders classically lack defining brain pathologies, but recent work has demonstrated dysregulation at the molecular level, characterized by transcriptomic and epigenetic alterations 1–3 . In autism spectrum disorder (ASD), this molecular pathology involves the upregulation of microglial, astrocyte and neural–immune genes, the downregulation of synaptic genes, and attenuation of gene-expression gradients in cortex 1,2,4–6 . However, whether these changes are limited to cortical association regions or are more widespread remains unknown. To address this issue, we performed RNA-sequencing analysis of 725 brain samples spanning 11 cortical areas from 112 post-mortem samples from individuals with ASD and neurotypical controls. We find widespread transcriptomic changes across the cortex in ASD, exhibiting an anterior-to-posterior gradient, with the greatest differences in primary visual cortex, coincident with an attenuation of the typical transcriptomic differences between cortical regions. Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing and methylation profiling demonstrate that this robust molecular signature reflects changes in cell-type-specific gene expression, particularly affecting excitatory neurons and glia. Both rare and common ASD-associated genetic variation converge within a downregulated co-expression module involving synaptic signalling, and common variation alone is enriched within a module of upregulated protein chaperone genes. These results highlight widespread molecular changes across the cerebral cortex in ASD, extending beyond association cortex to broadly involve primary sensory regions."
https://openalex.org/W4307931719,"Solid tumours are innervated by nerve fibres that arise from the autonomic and sensory peripheral nervous systems1-5. Whether the neo-innervation of tumours by pain-initiating sensory neurons affects cancer immunosurveillance remains unclear. Here we show that melanoma cells interact with nociceptor neurons, leading to increases in their neurite outgrowth, responsiveness to noxious ligands and neuropeptide release. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-one such nociceptor-produced neuropeptide-directly increases the exhaustion of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, which limits their capacity to eliminate melanoma. Genetic ablation of the TRPV1 lineage, local pharmacological silencing of nociceptors and antagonism of the CGRP receptor RAMP1 all reduced the exhaustion of tumour-infiltrating leukocytes and decreased the growth of tumours, nearly tripling the survival rate of mice that were inoculated with B16F10 melanoma cells. Conversely, CD8+ T cell exhaustion was rescued in sensory-neuron-depleted mice that were treated with local recombinant CGRP. As compared with wild-type CD8+ T cells, Ramp1-/- CD8+ T cells were protected against exhaustion when co-transplanted into tumour-bearing Rag1-deficient mice. Single-cell RNA sequencing of biopsies from patients with melanoma revealed that intratumoral RAMP1-expressing CD8+ T cells were more exhausted than their RAMP1-negative counterparts, whereas overexpression of RAMP1 correlated with a poorer clinical prognosis. Overall, our results suggest that reducing the release of CGRP from tumour-innervating nociceptors could be a strategy to improve anti-tumour immunity by eliminating the immunomodulatory effects of CGRP on cytotoxic CD8+ T cells."
https://openalex.org/W4307931718,"Enrichment of nutrients and loss of herbivores are assumed to cause a loss of plant diversity in grassland ecosystems because they increase plant cover, which leads to a decrease of light in the understory1-3. Empirical tests of the role of competition for light in natural systems are based on indirect evidence, and have been a topic of debate for the last 40 years. Here we show that experimentally restoring light to understory plants in a natural grassland mitigates the loss of plant diversity that is caused by either nutrient enrichment or the absence of mammalian herbivores. The initial effect of light addition on restoring diversity under fertilization was transitory and outweighed by the greater effect of herbivory on light levels, indicating that herbivory is a major factor that controls diversity, partly through light. Our results provide direct experimental evidence, in a natural system, that competition for light is a key mechanism that contributes to the loss of biodiversity after cessation of mammalian herbivory. Our findings also show that the effects of herbivores can outpace the effects of fertilization on competition for light. Management practices that target maintaining grazing by native or domestic herbivores could therefore have applications in protecting biodiversity in grassland ecosystems, because they alleviate competition for light in the understory."
https://openalex.org/W4307931819,"Protective immunity relies on the interplay of innate and adaptive immune cells with complementary and redundant functions. Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) have recently emerged as tissue-resident, innate mirror images of the T cell system, with which they share lineage-specifying transcription factors and effector machinery1. Located at barrier surfaces, ILCs are among the first responders against invading pathogens and thus could potentially determine the outcome of the immune response2. However, so far it has not been possible to dissect the unique contributions of ILCs to protective immunity owing to limitations in specific targeting of ILC subsets. Thus, all of the available data have been generated either in mice lacking the adaptive immune system or with tools that also affect other immune cell subsets. In addition, it has been proposed that ILCs might be dispensable for a proper immune response because other immune cells could compensate for their absence3-7. Here we report the generation of a mouse model based on the neuromedin U receptor 1 (Nmur1) promoter as a driver for simultaneous expression of Cre recombinase and green fluorescent protein, which enables gene targeting in group 2 ILCs (ILC2s) without affecting other innate and adaptive immune cells. Using Cre-mediated gene deletion of Id2 and Gata3 in Nmur1-expressing cells, we generated mice with a selective and specific deficiency in ILC2s. ILC2-deficient mice have decreased eosinophil counts at steady state and are unable to recruit eosinophils to the airways in models of allergic asthma. Further, ILC2-deficient mice do not mount an appropriate immune and epithelial type 2 response, resulting in a profound defect in worm expulsion and a non-protective type 3 immune response. In total, our data establish non-redundant functions for ILC2s in the presence of adaptive immune cells at steady state and during disease and argue for a multilayered organization of the immune system on the basis of a spatiotemporal division of labour."

https://openalex.org/W4308037645,"After ingestion of toxin-contaminated food, the brain initiates a series of defensive responses (e.g., nausea, retching, and vomiting). How the brain detects ingested toxin and coordinates diverse defensive responses remains poorly understood. Here, we developed a mouse-based paradigm to study defensive responses induced by bacterial toxins. Using this paradigm, we identified a set of molecularly defined gut-to-brain and brain circuits that jointly mediate toxin-induced defensive responses. The gut-to-brain circuit consists of a subset of Htr3a+ vagal sensory neurons that transmit toxin-related signals from intestinal enterochromaffin cells to Tac1+ neurons in the dorsal vagal complex (DVC). Tac1+ DVC neurons drive retching-like behavior and conditioned flavor avoidance via divergent projections to the rostral ventral respiratory group and lateral parabrachial nucleus, respectively. Manipulating these circuits also interferes with defensive responses induced by the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin. These results suggest that food poisoning and chemotherapy recruit similar circuit modules to initiate defensive responses."
https://openalex.org/W4307931716,"Learning-related changes in brain activity are thought to underlie adaptive behaviours1,2. For instance, the learning of a reward site by rodents requires the development of an over-representation of that location in the hippocampus3-6. How this learning-related change occurs remains unknown. Here we recorded hippocampal CA1 population activity as mice learned a reward location on a linear treadmill. Physiological and pharmacological evidence suggests that the adaptive over-representation required behavioural timescale synaptic plasticity (BTSP)7. BTSP is known to be driven by dendritic voltage signals that we proposed were initiated by input from entorhinal cortex layer 3 (EC3). Accordingly, the CA1 over-representation was largely removed by optogenetic inhibition of EC3 activity. Recordings from EC3 neurons revealed an activity pattern that could provide an instructive signal directing BTSP to generate the over-representation. Consistent with this function, our observations show that exposure to a second environment possessing a prominent reward-predictive cue resulted in both EC3 activity and CA1 place field density that were more elevated at the cue than at the reward. These data indicate that learning-related changes in the hippocampus are produced by synaptic plasticity directed by an instructive signal from the EC3 that seems to be specifically adapted to the behaviourally relevant features of the environment."
https://openalex.org/W4307930537,"Optical atomic clocks are the most accurate measurement devices ever constructed and have found many applications in fundamental science and technology. The use of highly charged ions (HCI) as a new class of references for highest accuracy clocks and precision tests of fundamental physics has long been motivated by their extreme atomic properties and reduced sensitivity to perturbations from external electric and magnetic fields compared to singly charged ions or neutral atoms. Here we present the first realisation of this new class of clocks, based on an optical magnetic-dipole transition in Ar$^{13+}$. Its comprehensively evaluated systematic frequency uncertainty of $2.2\times10^{-17}$ is comparable to that of many optical clocks in operation. From clock comparisons we improve by eight and nine orders of magnitude upon the uncertainties for the absolute transition frequency and isotope shift ($^{40}$Ar vs. $^{36}$Ar), respectively. These measurements allow us to probe the largely unexplored quantum electrodynamic nuclear recoil, presented as part of improved calculations of the isotope shift which reduce the uncertainty of previous theory by a factor of three. This work establishes forbidden optical transitions in HCI as references for cutting-edge optical clocks and future high-sensitivity searches for physics beyond the standard model."
https://openalex.org/W4307931690,"Abstract Sperm chromatin is typically transformed by protamines into a compact and transcriptionally inactive state 1,2 . Sperm cells of flowering plants lack protamines, yet they have small, transcriptionally active nuclei with chromatin condensed through an unknown mechanism 3,4 . Here we show that a histone variant, H2B.8, mediates sperm chromatin and nuclear condensation in Arabidopsis thaliana . Loss of H2B.8 causes enlarged sperm nuclei with dispersed chromatin, whereas ectopic expression in somatic cells produces smaller nuclei with aggregated chromatin. This result demonstrates that H2B.8 is sufficient for chromatin condensation. H2B.8 aggregates transcriptionally inactive AT-rich chromatin into phase-separated condensates, which facilitates nuclear compaction without reducing transcription. Reciprocal crosses show that mutation of h2b.8 reduces male transmission, which suggests that H2B.8-mediated sperm compaction is important for fertility. Altogether, our results reveal a new mechanism of nuclear compaction through global aggregation of unexpressed chromatin. We propose that H2B.8 is an evolutionary innovation of flowering plants that achieves nuclear condensation compatible with active transcription."
https://openalex.org/W4307931169,"The forested swamps of the central Congo Basin store approximately 30 billion metric tonnes of carbon in peat1,2. Little is known about the vulnerability of these carbon stocks. Here we investigate this vulnerability using peat cores from a large interfluvial basin in the Republic of the Congo and palaeoenvironmental methods. We find that peat accumulation began at least at 17,500 calibrated years before present (cal. yr BP; taken as AD 1950). Our data show that the peat that accumulated between around 7,500 to around 2,000 cal. yr BP is much more decomposed compared with older and younger peat. Hydrogen isotopes of plant waxes indicate a drying trend, starting at approximately 5,000 cal. yr BP and culminating at approximately 2,000 cal. yr BP, coeval with a decline in dominant swamp forest taxa. The data imply that the drying climate probably resulted in a regional drop in the water table, which triggered peat decomposition, including the loss of peat carbon accumulated prior to the onset of the drier conditions. After approximately 2,000 cal. yr BP, our data show that the drying trend ceased, hydrologic conditions stabilized and peat accumulation resumed. This reversible accumulation-loss-accumulation pattern is consistent with other peat cores across the region, indicating that the carbon stocks of the central Congo peatlands may lie close to a climatically driven drought threshold. Further research should quantify the combination of peatland threshold behaviour and droughts driven by anthropogenic carbon emissions that may trigger this positive carbon cycle feedback in the Earth system."

We characterized the fecal microbiome and metabolome of 222 young children in Dhaka, Bangladesh during the first two years of life. A distinct Bifidobacterium longum clade expanded with introduction of solid foods and harbored enzymes for utilizing both breast milk and solid food substrates. The clade was highly prevalent in Bangladesh, present globally (at lower prevalence), and correlated with many other gut taxa and metabolites, indicating an important role in gut ecology. We also found that the B. longum clades and associated metabolites were implicated in childhood diarrhea and early growth, including positive associations between growth measures and B. longum subsp. infantis, indolelactate and N-acetylglutamate. Our data demonstrate geographic, cultural, seasonal, and ecological heterogeneity that should be accounted for when identifying microbiome factors implicated in and potentially benefiting infant development."
https://openalex.org/W4307930460,"Surface plasmonics with its unique confinement of light1,2 is expected to be a cornerstone for future compact radiation sources and integrated photonics devices. The energy transfer between light and matter is a defining aspect that underlies recent studies on optical surface-wave-mediated spontaneous emissions3–5. However, coherent stimulated emission of free electrons, which is essential for free-electron light sources, and its dynamical amplification process remain to be disclosed in a clear, unambiguous and calibrated manner. Here we present the coherent amplification of terahertz surface plasmon polaritons via free-electron-stimulated emission: a femtosecond optical pulse creates an in-phase free-electron pulse with an initial terahertz surface wave, and their ensuing interactions intensify the terahertz surface wave coherently. The underlying dynamics of the amplification, including a twofold redshift in the radiation frequency over a one-millimetre interaction length, are resolved as electromagnetic-field-profile evolutions using an optical pump–probe method. By extending the approach to a properly phase-matched electron bunch, our theoretical analysis predicts a super-radiant surface-wave growth, which lays the ground for a stimulated surface-wave light source and may facilitate capable means for matter manipulation, especially in the terahertz band. Stimulated emission by free electrons is used to amplify terahertz surface plasmon polaritons in a manner resembles that of light amplification in a high-gain free-electron laser."

https://openalex.org/W4308030382,"Proper sensing of ambient temperature is of utmost importance for the survival of euthermic animals, including humans. While considerable progress has been made in our understanding of temperature sensors and transduction mechanisms, the higher-order neural circuits processing such information are still only incompletely understood. Using intersectional genetics in combination with circuit tracing and functional neuron manipulation, we identified Kcnip2-expressing inhibitory (Kcnip2GlyT2) interneurons of the mouse spinal dorsal horn as critical elements of a neural circuit that tunes sensitivity to cold. Diphtheria toxin-mediated ablation of these neurons increased cold sensitivity without affecting responses to other somatosensory modalities, while their chemogenetic activation reduced cold and also heat sensitivity. We also show that Kcnip2GlyT2 neurons become activated preferentially upon exposure to cold temperatures and subsequently inhibit spinal nociceptive output neurons that project to the lateral parabrachial nucleus. Our results thus identify a hitherto unknown spinal circuit that tunes cold sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W4307930848,"Mortality due to COVID-19 is not increased in immunosuppressed individuals after liver transplantation (OLT) compared to individuals without immunosuppression. Data on long-term protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in immunosuppressed convalescents, is limited. We prospectively measured immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 by quantifying antibodies against 4 different antigens (spike protein 1 and 2, receptor binding domain, nucleocapsid) and T cell responses by IFN-γ ELISPOT against 4 antigens (membrane, nucleocapsid, spike protein 1 and 2) in 24 OLT convalescents with immunosuppressive therapy longitudinally in the first year after COVID-19 including a booster vaccination in comparison to a matched cohort of non-immunosuppressed convalescents (non-IS-Con). Pre-pandemic OLT samples were retrieved from our prospective OLT biorepository (n = 16). No relevant T cell reactivity or immunoglobulin G (IgG) against SARS-CoV-2 were detectable in pre-pandemic samples of OLT recipients despite reactivity against endemic corona-viruses. OLT convalescents had a lower prevalence of IgG against nucleocapsid (54% vs. 90%) but not against spike protein domains (98–100% vs. 100%) after vaccination in the second half-year after COVID-19 compared to non-IS-Con. Also, concentrations of anti-nucleocapsid IgG were lower in OLT convalescents than in non-IS-Con. Concentration of IgG against spike protein domains was significantly increased by a booster vaccination in OLT convalescents. But concentration of IgG against two of three spike protein domains remains slightly lower compared to non-IS-Con finally. However, none of these differences was mirrored by the cellular immunity against SARS-CoV-2 that remained stable during the first year after COVID-19 and was not further stimulated by a corona vaccination in OLT convalescents. In conclusion, despite lower concentrations of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in OLT convalescents anti-SARS-CoV-2 cellular immunity was as robust as in non-IS-Con."
https://openalex.org/W4307934758,"A healthy lifestyle is defined as 'a way of living that lowers the risk of being seriously ill or dying early.' Although barriers and facilitators of healthy lifestyles have been well-studied among populations like those with chronic non-communicable diseases, adolescents, and older adults in Asia, less information is available on barriers and facilitators perceived by the general adult population. Using a qualitative methodology and leveraging the socio-ecological model, the current study aimed to understand the barriers and facilitators of a healthy lifestyle in a sample of Singapore residents. Overall, 30 semi-structured interviews were conducted in English and other local languages from August 2020 to March 2021. Transcripts were analysed using framework analysis. Five main themes pertaining to personal, interpersonal, environmental, socio-cultural, and policy-level factors were classified under the two overarching categories of barriers and facilitators of healthy lifestyles. The results of this study offer important insights into understanding the barriers and facilitators to the adoption of a healthy lifestyle among people in Singapore. Furthermore, our findings illustrate the complex interplay between individuals, social relationships, environment, and policy that can act as either a barrier or a facilitator to adopting a healthy lifestyle."

https://openalex.org/W4307930467,"Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a common chronic disease of the large intestine. Current anti-inflammatory drugs prescribed to treat this disease have limited utility due to significant side-effects. Thus, immunotherapies for UC treatment are still sought. In the DSS mouse model of UC, we recently demonstrated that systemic administration of the Bin1 monoclonal antibody 99D (Bin1 mAb) developed in our laboratory was sufficient to reinforce intestinal barrier function and preserve an intact colonic mucosa, compared to control subjects which displayed severe mucosal lesions, high-level neutrophil and lymphocyte infiltration of mucosal and submucosal areas, and loss of crypts. A dysbiotic microbiome may lead to UC. We determined the effects of Bin1 mAb on the gut microbiome and colonic neurons and correlated the benefits of immunotherapeutic treatment. In the DSS model, we found that induction of UC was associated with disintegration of enteric neurons and elevated levels of glial cells, which translocated to the muscularis at distinct sites. Further, we characterized an altered gut microbiome in DSS treated mice associated with pathogenic proinflammatory characters. Both of these features of UC induction were normalized by Bin1 mAb treatment. With regard to microbiome changes, we observed in particular, increase in Enterobacteriaceae; whereas Firmicutes were eliminated by UC induction and Bin1 mAb treatment restored this phylum including the genus Lactobacillus. Overall, our findings suggest that the intestinal barrier function restored by Bin1 immunotherapy in the DSS model of UC is associated with an improvement in the gut microbiome and preservation of enteric neurons, contributing overall to a healthy intestinal tract."
https://openalex.org/W4307934684,"Background Up to 50% of women will develop pelvic organ prolapse (POP) over their lifetime. Symptoms include pain, bulge, urinary, bowel and sexual symptoms affecting all aspects of a woman’s life. This study explores the lived experience of women with POP. Methodology A qualitative study was undertaken. Following institutional ethical approval women from an online peer support group (n = 930 members) were recruited to participate in semi-structured interviews. Inclusion criteria stipulated women (&gt; 18years), pre-menopausal, at least one-year post-partum, diagnosed with POP and aware of their diagnosis. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with a clinician specialising in pelvic health. A battery of questions was designed to elicit discussion on their experience of being diagnosed with POP and its impact on daily life and relationships. Interviews were carried out via Zoom, recorded and transcribed. Thematic analysis was undertaken. Findings Fourteen women (32–41 years), para 1–3 participated. All had at least one vaginal birth; three had vacuum, four had forceps operative births. All had Grade 1–3 POP. Interviews lasted 40–100 minutes. Three core themes with subthemes were identified; biological/physical, psychological and social. Women were particularly affected in terms of sport and exercise participation, their own perceptions of their ability as mothers and fear of their condition worsening. They described societal attitudes, reporting stigma around POP and women’s pelvic health in general, expectations placed on women to put up with their symptoms and an idealised perception of new motherhood. Conclusions The impact of POP from a biopsychosocial perspective reflects other chronic conditions. Prevention, early education and supports for developing strong self-management approaches would be beneficial for long term management of this condition."
https://openalex.org/W4307930424,"Providing access to non-confidential government data to the public is one of the initiatives adopted by many governments today to embrace government transparency practices. The initiative of publishing non-confidential government data for the public to use and re-use without restrictions is known as Open Government Data (OGD). Nevertheless, after several years after its inception, the direction of OGD implementation remains uncertain. The extant literature on OGD adoption concentrates primarily on identifying factors influencing adoption decisions. Yet, studies on the underlying factors influencing OGD after the adoption phase are scarce. Based on these issues, this study investigated the post-adoption of OGD in the public sector, particularly the data provider agencies. The OGD post-adoption framework is crafted by anchoring the Technology–Organization–Environment (TOE) framework and the innovation adoption process theory. The data was collected from 266 government agencies in the Malaysian public sector. This study employed the partial least square-structural equation modeling as the statistical technique for factor analysis. The results indicate that two factors from the organizational context (top management support, organizational culture) and two from the technological context (complexity, relative advantage) have a significant contribution to the post-adoption of OGD in the public sector. The contribution of this study is threefold: theoretical, conceptual, and practical. This study contributed theoretically by introducing the post-adoption framework of OGD that comprises the acceptance, routinization, and infusion stages. As the majority of OGD adoption studies conclude their analysis at the adoption (decisions) phase, this study gives novel insight to extend the analysis into unexplored territory, specifically the post-adoption phase. Conceptually, this study presents two new factors in the environmental context to be explored in the OGD adoption study, namely, the data demand and incentives. The fact that data providers are not influenced by data requests from the agency’s external environment and incentive offerings is something that needs further investigation. In practicality, the findings of this study are anticipated to assist policymakers in strategizing for long-term OGD implementation from the data provider’s perspective. This effort is crucial to ensure that the OGD initiatives will be incorporated into the public sector’s service thrust and become one of the digital government services provided to the citizen."
https://openalex.org/W4307930597,"Introduction Everyday walking often involves walking with divided attention (i.e., dual-tasking). Exercise interventions for older adults should mimic these simultaneous physical and cognitive demands. This proof-of-concept study had a two-fold purpose: 1) identify acute cognitive and gait benefits of a single session of virtual reality treadmill training (VRTT), relative to conventional treadmill training (CTT), and 2) identify differences between those who reduced dual-task costs (i.e., responders) on gait or cognition and those who did not, after the session. Methods Sixty older adults were randomized to complete a single 30-minute session of VRTT (n = 30, 71.2±6.5 years, 22 females) or CTT (n = 30, 72.0±7.7 years, 21 females). Pre- and post-exercise session, participants performed single-task walking, single-task cognitive, and dual-task walking trials while gait and cognition were recorded. Gait variables were gait speed and gait speed variability. Cognition variables were response reaction time, response accuracy, and cognitive throughput. Dual-task effects (DTE) on gait and cognition variables were also calculated. Results Post-exercise, there were no group differences (all p &gt;0.05). During single- and dual-task trials, both groups walked faster (single-task: F (1, 58) = 9.560, p = 0.003; dual-task: F (1, 58) = 19.228, p &lt;0.001), responded more quickly (single-task: F (1, 58) = 5.054, p = 0.028; dual-task: F (1, 58) = 8.543, p = 0.005), and reduced cognitive throughput (single-task: F (1, 58) = 6.425, p = 0.014; dual-task: F (1, 58) = 28.152, p &lt;0.001). Both groups also exhibited reduced DTE on gait speed ( F (1, 58) = 8.066, p = 0.006), response accuracy ( F (1, 58) = 4.123, p = 0.047), and cognitive throughput ( F (1, 58) = 6.807, p = 0.012). Gait responders and non-responders did not differ (all p &gt;0.05), but cognitive responders completed fewer years of education ( t (58) = 2.114, p = 0.039) and better information processing speed ( t (58) = -2.265, p = 0.027) than cognitive non-responders. Conclusions The results indicate that both VRTT and CTT may acutely improve gait and cognition. Therefore, older adults will likely benefit from participating in either type of exercise. The study also provides evidence that baseline cognition can impact training effects on DTE on cognition."

https://openalex.org/W4307930855,"Background and objectives Prior research has established steep socioeconomic status (SES) disparities in children’s cognitive skills at kindergarten entry. Yet, few studies have had comprehensive, multi-informant data to examine SES-related differences in foundational social and emotional skills and executive function. The objective of the current study is to systematically examine SES-related differences in young children’s executive function (EF), self-regulation skills, and behaviors. Methods The current study analyzed data on 2,309 young children from the Early Learning Study at Harvard (ELS@H). Multi-method (direct-assessment and reports) and multi-informant (parents and early education and care educators) information on children’s executive function, self-regulation skills, and internalizing, externalizing, and adaptive behaviors were used. A parametric framework employing Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimation was used to quantify the size of the SES-related differences in this set of children’s foundational social-emotional skills. Results On average, there were differences of 0.24–0.45 SD for EF, 0.22–0.32 SD for self-regulation skills, and 0.27–0.54 SD for behaviors favoring children from the highest SES quartile of the distribution of SES relative to children from the lowest quartile. The SES-related differences were consistent across direct assessment, parent reports, and educator reports. Some differences were larger for older children relative to their younger counterparts. Conclusions Findings indicate a need for comprehensive intervention efforts well before kindergarten entry aimed at closing early disparities in children’s foundational social and emotional skills and executive function."
https://openalex.org/W4308045239,"Internet gaming disorder (IGD) is a social problem that cannot be ignored. Considerable research has shown that IGD can impede the healthy physical and mental development of adolescents. Based on positive youth development theory and stage-environment fit theory, the current study explored the mediating effect of depression and the moderating effect of gender to determine the association between positive youth development (PYD) and IGD. A sample of 1970 Chinese adolescents aged 11–18 years (1021 boys, 940 girls, and 10 unidentifiable individuals) completed questionnaires related to PYD, depression, IGD, and their background information. The results revealed that PYD negatively predicted IGD. After controlling for gender and age, this study found that depression mediated the relationship between PYD and IGD. Furthermore, gender moderated the relationship between depression and IGD. Boys with depressive symptoms were more likely to indulge in IGD than girls. This research contributes to a more thorough understanding of how PYD decreases the risk of IGD. These findings suggest that cultivating PYD attributes is a promising approach to prevent or reduce depression and IGD among adolescents in mainland China."
https://openalex.org/W4308045299,"Growing evidence has indicated that the characteristics of gut microbiota are associated with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Phlegm-heat syndrome (PHS), a specific pathological state of the AIS, is one of the common traditional Chinese syndromes of stroke. The long duration of PHS in patients with AIS could lead to poor clinical outcomes. Gut microbiota characteristics in patients with both AIS and PHS, and their relationship remains unknown. This study was designed to investigate the alterations in gut microbiota in patients with AIS and PHS through a cross-sectional study. Fecal samples were collected from 10 patients with AIS and non-PHS (ntAIS), 7 patients with AIS and PHS (tAIS), and 10 healthy controls (HC). Samples were profiled via Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA V3-V4. Stroke severity was assessed at admission by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and modified Rankin scale (mRS); their correlation with gut microbiota was investigated. The alpha-diversity of the bacterial communities was significantly higher in the fecal samples of patients with tAIS than in patients with ntAIS (Shannon index, P = 0.037). In addition, the combined tAIS and ntAIS group (tntAIS) exhibited higher microbiotic diversity when compared with HC (chao1, P = 0.019). The structure of intestinal microbiota was effectively distinguished between the tAIS and ntAIS group (ANOSIM, r = 0.337, P = 0.007). Additionally, the gut microbiota structure was significantly different between the tntAIS and HC groups (ANOSIM, r = 0.217, P = 0.005). The genera, Ruminococcaceae_ UCG_002 and Christensenellaceae_R-7_group, were implicated in the discrimination of PHS from non-PHS. The order Lactobacillales and family Lachnospiraceae were significantly negatively correlated with NIHSS and mRS at admission (P < 0.05). By contrast, the order Desulfovibrionales, families Christensenellaceae and Desulfovibrionaceae, and genera Ruminococcaceae UCG-014 and Ruminococcaceae UCG-002 were significantly positively correlated with NIHSS and mRS at admission (P < 0.05). This study is the first to profile the characteristics of gut microbiota in patients with AIS and PHS, compared with those with non-PHS. The genera, Ruminococcaceae_ UCG_002 and Christensenellaceae_R-7_group, may be objective indicators of this traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) syndrome in AIS. Furthermore, it provides a microbe-inspired biological basis for TCM syndrome differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W4308099309,"Oleotourism (olive oil tourism) is a new form of gastronomic tourism that satisfies increasingly challenging tourist demand, especially in the wake of the pandemic and for tourists who seek not only quality food products but also a safe environment to enjoy their chosen activity. Córdoba is a province in southern Spain where olives play a very important role, accounting for 50% of its cultivated area, and whose agricultural activity can be complemented with tourism due to its 189 oil mills that can welcome visitors for oil tasting. However, this type of tourism is not seeing an expected boom. This research analyzes, through a varimax analysis, the factors that attract and drive oleotourists as well as the components of such tourism. As a result, four principal components related to tourists and tourism offers were obtained, finding a high degree of satisfaction of oleotourist with the routes explored as well as a lack of knowledge of this type of tourism in international markets."
https://openalex.org/W4307930440,"Brucellosis is one of the main livestock disease risks in Kazakhstan. It’s been endemic there since 1930, accounting for over 1300 human cases per annum. The economic loss was 45 million USD in 2015 alone. Since 1952, Kazakhstan has implemented various control strategies with little success. One Health approaches have been suggested to tackle brucellosis, however, there is a lack of evidence for best practices to operationalise One Health in the literature, and methods for implementation are not established. The intention of this study was to introduce the One Health approach during the evaluation phase of the policy cycle. A two-day workshop was organized by the authors to familiarize participants with the evaluation methodology. Twenty-one specialists representing veterinary and public health sector, together with researchers, took part in this study. For two weeks following the workshop, first author conducted individual interviews with workshop participants to obtain individual scorings to assess knowledge integration capacity (One Health-ness). The evaluation results show that there is a lack of knowledge about the perceived damage caused by brucellosis to animal owners and other stakeholders. There is insufficient data available about farmers’ practices, interests and motivations, and also data is missing for important transmission processes such as the amount of unsafe dairy consumption. The absence of such data illustrates the extent of the uncertainty to which decision-makers are exposed despite well-elaborated transmission models and supports the importance of co-producing solutions with participatory methods. The results suggest the need for broader involvement of stakeholders. Outputs of this study could help navigate the initial stages of One Health operationalization."
https://openalex.org/W4307931036,"The use of multispecies swards on livestock farms is growing due to the wide range of benefits they bring, such as improved biomass yield and animal performance. Preferential uptake of micronutrients by some plant species means the inclusion of legumes and forbs in grass-dominated pasture swards could improve micronutrient provision to livestock via careful species selection. However, although soil properties affect plant micronutrient concentrations, it is unknown whether choosing ‘best-performing’ species, in terms of their micronutrient content, needs to be soil-specific or whether the recommendations can be more generic. To address this question, we carried out an experiment with 15 common grass, forb and legume species grown on four soils for five weeks in a controlled environment. The soils were chosen to have contrasting properties such as texture, organic matter content and micronutrient concentrations. The effect of soil pH was tested on two soils (pH 5.4 and 7.4) chosen to minimise other confounding variables. Yield was significantly affected by soil properties and there was a significant interaction with botanical group but not species within a botanical group (grass, forb or legume). There were differences between botanical groups and between species in both their micronutrient concentrations and total uptake. Micronutrient herbage concentrations often, but not always, reflected soil micronutrient concentrations. There were soil-botanical group interactions for micronutrient concentration and uptake by plants, but the interaction between plant species (within a botanical group) and soil was significant only for forbs, and predominantly occurred when considering micronutrient uptake rather than concentration. Generally, plants had higher yields and micronutrient contents at pH 5.4 than 7.4. Forbs tended to have higher concentrations of micronutrients than other botanical groups and the effect of soil on micronutrient uptake was only significant for forbs."
https://openalex.org/W4308099602,"We present a novel setup for treating sepsis using distributional reinforcement learning (RL). Sepsis is a life-threatening medical emergency. Its treatment is considered to be a challenging high-stakes decision-making problem, which has to procedurally account for risk. Treating sepsis by machine learning algorithms is difficult due to a couple of reasons: There is limited and error-afflicted initial data in a highly complex biological system combined with the need to make robust, transparent and safe decisions. We demonstrate a suitable method that combines data imputation by a kNN model using a custom distance with state representation by discretization using clustering, and that enables superhuman decision-making using speedy Q-learning in the framework of distributional RL. Compared to clinicians, the recovery rate is increased by more than 3% on the test data set. Our results illustrate how risk-aware RL agents can play a decisive role in critical situations such as the treatment of sepsis patients, a situation acerbated due to the COVID-19 pandemic (Martineau 2020). In addition, we emphasize the tractability of the methodology and the learning behavior while addressing some criticisms of the previous work (Komorowski et al. 2018) on this topic."
https://openalex.org/W4308099605,"According to recent literature on “architecture” as a discipline, practical knowledge relevant to its process of making has decreased in importance in favor of a more academic approach. Using data derived from Ulrich’s Periodical Directory and Clarivate Analytics’s Web of Science, this paper suggests providing empirical evidence supporting of such shift, as revealed by an overview of the dissemination practices in architecture scholarly production between 1980 and 2015. Our results support that architecture is becoming increasingly academic , as demonstrated by the growing proportion of articles and journals intended for scholars rather than for professionals. We also show that architecture is increasingly global, with decreased interest in local and/or national issues and the growing prevalence of English as a publication language. Finally, this academic focus is manifested in references cited by architectural papers with the gradual substitution of professional and artistic oriented knowledge, for scientific approaches tied to engineering and technology."
https://openalex.org/W4307930339,"Background Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has emerged and spread rapidly worldwide and established a global public health crisis in early 2020. The first Moroccan case was reported on March 2, 2020. Since then, healthcare workers (HCWs) played a major role in saving human lives threatened by COVID-19. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of COVID-19 infection among Moroccan physicians and to report associated risk factors prior vaccination campaign. Methods A cross-sectional study was carried out in the Fez-Meknes region of Morocco, 545 physicians’ data was collected using a self-reported online questionnaire. The data collection was done between December 1, 2020, and February 1, 2021. Results The prevalence of COVID-19 among physicians was 27.3%. The mean age of the confirmed COVID-19 group was 38.4±12.9 years old. There was no association between COVID-19 infection and preventive measures compliance by physicians and healthcare authorities in the workplace. However, multivariate analysis strengthened the following factors such as increased risk of COVID-19 infection within men ☯aOR:1.896; 95% IC 1.272–2.828; p = 0.002]; the presence of at least one comorbidity ☯aOR:2.268; 95%IC 1.414–3.637; p = 0.001]; and working at a university or military hospitals ☯aOR:2.578; 95%IC 1.667–3.989; p = 0.001]. Conclusion This study allows comparing COVID-19 prevalence among healthcare workers before and after vaccination programs. This should support better preparation strategy for any future pandemics with appropriate and increased awareness for men, carrying comorbidity, and working environment with high COVID-19 disease management."
https://openalex.org/W4307930366,"The correlation between form and function is influenced by biomechanical constraints, natural selection, and ecological interactions. In many species of suction-feeding fishes, jaw shape has shown to be closely associated with diet. However, these correlations have not been tested in fishes that have more complex jaw functions. For example, the neotropical loricariid catfishes possess a ventrally facing oral disk, which allows for the oral jaws to adhere to surfaces to conduct feeding. To determine if jaw shape is correlated to diet type, we assessed oral jaw shape across 36 species using CT scans. Shape was quantified with traditional and automated landmarking in 3DSlicer, and diet type correlation was calculated using the phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS) method. We found that traditional and automated processes captured shape effectively when all jaw components were combined. PGLS found that diet type did not correlate to jaw shape; however, there was a correlation between clades with diverse diets and fast evolutionary rates of shape. These results suggest that shape is not constrained to diet type, and that similarly shaped jaws coupled with different types of teeth could allow the fishes to feed on a wide range of materials."

Effects of chronic exposure to low PAH concentrations have been evaluated in cross-sectional, but not in longitudinal studies, to date. We aimed to assess the effects of long-term exposure to the low-concentration PAHs on alterations in platelet indices in the Chinese population. During 2014-2017, we enrolled 222 participants who had lived in a village in northern China, 1-2 km downwind from a coal plant, for more than 25 years, but who were not employed by the plant or related businesses. During three follow-ups, annually in June, demographic information and urine and blood samples were collected. Eight PAHs were tested: namely 2-hydroxynaphthalene, 1-hydroxynaphthalene, 2-hydroxyfluorene, 9-hydroxyfluorene (9-OHFlu), 2-hydroxyphenanthrene (2-OHPh), 1-hydroxyphenanthrene (1-OHPh), 1-hydroxypyrene (1-OHP), and 3-hydroxybenzo [a] pyrene. Five platelet indices were measured: platelet count (PLT), platelet distribution width (PDW), mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet crit, and the platelet-large cell ratio. Generalized mixed and generalized linear mixed models were used to estimate correlations between eight urinary PAH metabolites and platelet indices. Model 1 assessed whether these correlations varied over time. Models 2 and 3 adjusted for additional personal information and personal habits. We found the following significant correlations: 2-OHPh (Model1 β1 = 18.06, Model2 β2 = 18.54, Model β3 = 18.54), 1-OHPh (β1 = 16.43, β2 = 17.42, β3 = 17.42), 1-OHP(β1 = 13.93, β2 = 14.03, β3 = 14.03) with PLT, as well as 9-OHFlu with PDW and MPV (odds ratio or Model3 ORPDW[95%CI] = 1.64[1.3-2.06], ORMPV[95%CI] = 1.33[1.19-1.48]). Long-term exposure to low concentrations of PAHs, indicated by2-OHPh, 1-OHPh, 1-OHP, and 9-OHFlu, as urinary biomarkers, affects PLT, PDW, and MPV. 9-OHFlu increased both PDW and MPV after elimination of the effects of other PAH exposure modes."
https://openalex.org/W4307930423,"Adherence to behavioral measures such as physical distancing are key to mitigating the effects of viral pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Adherence depends in part on people's perception of what others do (descriptive norms) or approve of (injunctive norms). This study examines the effects that exposure to images depicting people following or breaking physical distancing rules have on perceptions of descriptive and injunctive norms and subsequent adherence behavior.An online between-subjects experiment (n = 315) was conducted, in which participants were exposed to a set of five photographs of different public spaces in which people either did or did not adhere to physical distancing rules (pre-registration: https://www.osf.io/uek2p). Participants' adherence behavior was measured using a triangulation of measures (incentivized online behavioral task, vignettes, intention measure). Perceptions of relevant social norms were also measured.Mann-Whitney tests showed no effects of condition on perceptions of descriptive and injunctive norms or on adherence behavior. Linear regressions showed that both component paths of the indirect effect (condition on norm perceptions, and norm perceptions on adherence behavior) were non-significant, hence mediation analyses were not conducted.Exposure to images of people following (compared to breaking) physical distancing rules did not affect adherence to such rules or perceived norms. We surmise that a single exposure to such images, especially in the context of COVID-19, is insufficient to affect behavior. We therefore recommend performing a comparable experiment in which participants are exposed repeatedly to images showing people (non)adhering to a specific behavior in a particular context for a longer period."
https://openalex.org/W4307930456,"Home cage aggression causes poor welfare in male laboratory mice and reduces data quality. One of the few proven strategies to reduce aggression involves preserving used nesting material at cage change. Volatile organic compounds from the nesting material and several body fluids not only correlate with less home cage aggression, but with more affiliative allo-grooming behavior. To date, these compounds have not been tested for a direct influence on male mouse social behavior. This study aimed to determine if 4 previously identified volatile compounds impact home cage interactions. A factorial design was used with cages equally split between C57BL/6N and SJL male mice (N = 40). Treatments were randomly assigned across cages and administered by spraying one compound solution on each cage's nesting material. Treatments were refreshed after day 3 and during cage change on day 7. Home cage social behavior was observed throughout the study week and immediately after cage change. Several hours after cage change, feces were collected from individual mice to measure corticosterone metabolites as an index of social stress. Wound severity was also assessed after euthanasia. Measures were analyzed with mixed models. Compound treatments did not impact most study measures. For behavior, SJL mice performed more aggression and submission, and C57BL/6N mice performed more allo-grooming. Wound severity was highest in the posterior region of both strains, and the middle back region of C57BL/6N mice. Posterior wounding also increased with more observed aggression. Corticosterone metabolites were higher in C57BL/6N mice and in mice treated with 3,4-dimethyl-1,2-cyclopentanedione with more wounding. These data confirm previous strain patterns in social behavior and further validates wound assessment as a measure of escalated aggression. The lack of observed treatment effects could be due to limitations in the compound administration procedure and/or the previous correlation study, which is further discussed."
https://openalex.org/W4307930464,"Natural occurrences and the choice of specific materials have a major impact on the experience of the physical environment. The results of a recent study using a free listing task involving only adjectives suggested that the conceptual structure of the aesthetics of materials is structured by sensorial, neutrally valenced, descriptive terms, while showing no primacy of beauty. The present article examined the conceptual structure underlying the aesthetic experience of various materials using a different methodological approach. Applying a technique based upon semantic differentials, individuals in the present study (n = 272) were asked to judge the applicability of the most frequently listed terms in the previous study to the aesthetics of different materials. Overall, the results of multiple analyses yielded a converging picture for the two studies. Additionally, as materials constitute the basis of complete entities, the role of products in the conceptual representation of the aesthetics of materials was investigated with an exploratory approach. No support was found for the hypothesis that products play such a role. Finally, limitations regarding the outcome of the present study are discussed. All things considered, the results of this study highlight the uniqueness of the aesthetics of materials and its distinctness from the conceptual representations underlying most other aesthetic domains."

We therefore sought to examine whether the positive effect of makeup on attractiveness can be extended to male faces. Twenty men were photographed facing forward, under constant camera and lighting conditions, with neutral expressions, and closed mouths. Each man was photographed twice: once without any cosmetics applied and another time with subtle cosmetics applied by a professional makeup artist. Two hundred participants then rated those 40 images on attractiveness. The male faces were rated as higher in attractiveness when presented wearing makeup, compared to when presented not wearing makeup. This was true for both male and female raters, and whether analyzing the data using a by-participant or a by-face analysis. These results provide the first empirical evidence that makeup increases attractiveness in male faces. Following work on female faces, future research should examine the effect of makeup on several other traits in male faces. The market for male cosmetics products is growing and evolving and this study serves as an initial step in understanding the effect of makeup on the perceptions of male faces."

To date there are few studies that document RC as experienced by immigrant and refugee women. In this article, we explore cases of RC as described by women who were part of a larger qualitative study investigating violence against immigrant and refugee women in southern Australia. The study aimed to identify the types of RC detailed in immigrant and refugee women's narratives, and to illustrate the contexts in which these experiences occurred. Analysis followed Baxter and Jack's (2008) case study methodology; whereby particular ""cases"" are used to describe a phenomenon in context. Thirteen women from seven countries described experiences that fit definitions of RC. The cases describe various types of RC including violence during pregnancy with the intent of causing miscarriage, forced abortion, contraception sabotage and forced pregnancy. As well as intimate partners, some women described multiple perpetrators being complicit in their experience of RC, especially in regard to controlling women's access to, and interactions with health services. More information is needed about immigrant and refugee women's experiences of RC, and how vulnerability to multi-perpetrator violence affects health service access. In particular knowledge about how multi-perpetrator RC can affect consent processes for women who already face barriers to health care requires attention. Further research is required to address knowledge gaps about appropriate prevention and advocacy work about RC in refugee and migrant communities, and what training is needed for professionals in the family violence sector, women's health services, women's organisations, multicultural and ethno-specific services."

This information needs to be summarized to evaluate disease severity and predict disease progression. We, therefore, sought to develop a machine learning-derived index, SPARE-Tau, which successfully detects pathology in the earliest disease stages and accurately predicts progression compared to a priori-based region of interest approaches (ROI). Methods 587 participants of the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort had flortaucipir scans, structural MRI scans, and an Aβ biomarker test (CSF or florbetapir PET) performed on the same visit. We derived the SPARE-Tau index in a subset of 367 participants. We evaluated associations with clinical measures for CSF p-tau, SPARE-MRI, and flortaucipir PET indices (SPARE-Tau, meta-temporal, and average Braak ROIs). Bootstrapped multivariate adaptive regression splines linear regression analyzed the association between the biomarkers and baseline ADAS-Cog13 scores. Bootstrapped multivariate linear regression models evaluated associations with clinical diagnosis. Cox-hazards and mixed-effects models investigated clinical progression and longitudinal ADAS-Cog13 changes. The Aβ positive cognitively unremarkable participants, not included in the SPARE-Tau training, served as an independent validation group. Results Compared to CSF p-tau, meta-temporal, and averaged Braak tau PET ROIs, SPARE-Tau showed the strongest association with baseline ADAS-cog13 scores and diagnosis. SPARE-Tau also presented the strongest association with clinical progression in cognitively unremarkable participants and longitudinal ADAS-Cog13 changes. Results were confirmed in the Aβ+ cognitively unremarkable hold-out sample participants. CSF p-tau showed the weakest cross-sectional associations and longitudinal prediction. Discussion Flortaucipir indices showed the strongest clinical association among the studied biomarkers (flortaucipir, florbetapir, structural MRI, and CSF p-tau) and were predictive in the preclinical disease stages. Among the flortaucipir indices, the machine-learning derived SPARE-Tau index was the most sensitive clinical progression biomarker. The combination of different biomarker modalities better predicted cognitive performance."

Hence, the present study focused on synthesizing SnCaAl2O3 core-shell nanoparticles (C.N.P.s) in the α-Alumina phase by thermal annealing a stacked structure sandwiched between two Al2O3 layers at low temperatures. The obtained structure showed Sn N.P. floating gate with an Al2O3 dielectric stacked tunneling barrier to remove the excess of these heavy metals from polluted water. To characterize the prepared composites, X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) were used. The synthesized SnCaAl2O3 C.N.P.s composite was examined to utilize it as an adsorbent for removing Zn, Cd, and Pb divalent cations. The removal efficiency was studied by various parameters such as adsorbent dose, pH, contact time, metal concentrations, temperature, and coexisting ions. The experimental results were tested via Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models. The obtained results were convenient to the Freundlich isotherm model. Moreover, the adsorption thermodynamic behavior of Zn+2, Cd+2, and Pb+2 on the synthesized composite was examined, and the process is endothermic and spontaneous under experimental conditions. The results illustrated that the adsorption efficiency of the SnCaAl2O3 core-shell nanoparticles (C.N.P.s) ranged from 88% to about 100% for all cations."
https://openalex.org/W4308099565,"Rwanda has high unmet need for family planning (FP), especially in the postpartum period when women are advised to space pregnancies at least two years for improved maternal-child health. Despite interest in the copper intrauterine device (IUD), a highly cost-effective method, access and uptake remain low. This study aimed to determine factors associated with postpartum IUD (PPIUD) uptake after postpartum family planning (PPFP) counseling as well as provider perceptions of facilitators and barriers to clients' PPIUD uptake.Postpartum women who received PPFP counseling and were less than 6 weeks postpartum were recruited for a case-control study in Kigali, Rwanda in 2018. We recruited n = 74 women who had accepted and n = 91 women who had declined the PPIUD. Multivariate logistic regression analyses evaluated associations between women's socio-demographics, FP knowledge and decision-making, and the outcome of PPIUD uptake. Six focus groups (FGs) were conducted with FP providers (n = 24) and community health workers (n = 17) trained to deliver PPFP counseling to assess perceptions of PPFP counseling and facilitators and barriers to PPIUD uptake. FG discussions were recorded, translated, and analyzed for themes.Factors associated (P<0.1) with PPIUD uptake included citing its non-hormonal nature, effectiveness, and duration of protection against pregnancy as advantages. Exclusive male partner control over FP decisions (relative to women's control or joint decision-making) was associated with non-use. Overall, limited knowledge about some aspects of the PPIUD persisted among clients even after counseling. Provider FGs highlighted client concerns, inconsistent FP messaging, and lack of male partner involvement as factors influencing non-use.Knowledge of the IUD and its benefits was associated with PPIUD uptake. There is need to refine PPFP counseling messages to address remaining knowledge gaps and concerns. Additionally, male partner involvement in FP counseling and decisions with their partners could be a key strategy to increase both PPIUD and FP uptake in Rwanda."
