https://openalex.org/W1493000352,"Abstract Acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase has been isolated from chicken liver and purified more than 1000-fold in good yield. It is an unusually stable protein exhibiting negligible loss of enzymatic activity during 1 week of storage (1 to 5 mg of protein per ml) at room temperature in potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7. The pure enzyme catalyzes the carboxylation of 8.8 µmoles of acetyl-CoA (or 7.0 µmoles of propionyl-CoA) per min per mg of refractometrically determined protein at its pH optimum of 7.5 at 37°. The carboxylase-catalyzed carboxylation of acetyl-CoA is activated 15- to 16-fold by dl-isocitrate or citrate and 5-fold by malonate; tricarballylate is essentially inactive. Arrhenius plots for acetyl-CoA carboxylation in the presence or absence of isocitrate are biphasic, having a transition point at about 21°. Below this temperature, where there is very little activator effect, the temperature coefficient (Q10) in the presence of isocitrate is 8.0. Above the transition point, where isocitrate activation is evident, the temperature coefficient (Q10) in the presence of activator is 2.0 and in its absence is a negative value. At pH 7.5 and 37°, the carboxylase catalyzes the over-all reverse reaction (decarboxylation), ATP-32Pi exchange, malonyl-CoA-14C-acetyl-CoA exchange, and ADP-, Pi-, and Mg2+-independent malonyl-CoA decarboxylation reactions at 14%, 6.2%, 33%, and 1.2%, respectively, of the rate of the over-all forward (carboxylation) reaction. All of the above mentioned reactions exhibit essentially the same tri- and dicarboxylic acid activation patterns. Evidence is presented which indicates that isocitrate activation of the carboxylase is associated with an increased maximum velocity."

The curve of lactate production plotted against pH for the cell-free system was steepest between pH 6.5 and 7.0. Our studies indicate that phosphofructokinase is the key control point, and a secondary locus of control may be at glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase or diphosphoglycerate kinase. The over-all effect of pH on glycolysis appears not to be dependent on the concentrations of cofactors known to affect phosphofructokinase. In the case of inorganic phosphate, the concentration of neither the monobasic nor the dibasic species is involved in the effect of pH."
https://openalex.org/W1527742387,"Abstract The initial reaction of 4-methylsterol demethylation is an aerobic hydroxylation of the methyl group by a mixed function oxidase. Since the microsomal carbon monoxidebinding hemoprotein, P-450, is the terminal oxidase of some similar mixed function oxidases, the role of P-450 in the process of methylsterol demethylation has now been investigated. The specific content of P-450 in a preparation of rat liver microsomes that actively demethylates sterols is approximately 1.2 mµmoles per mg of protein. This concentration of microsomal P-450 is decreased markedly by treatment of microsomes with deoxycholic acid. However, upon deoxycholate treatment, methylsterol demethylase activity is retained disproportionately. Microsomes from various sources contain sterol demethylase activity, but many active preparations contain no P-450. The sterol demethylase is not inhibited by compounds that inhibit P-450-dependent mixed function oxidases. For example, methylsterol demethylase is not inhibited by carbon monoxide, ethyl isocyanide, or nicotinamide. In further contradistinction, the demethylase is inhibited by cyanide. An aerobic hydroxylase is released from rat liver microsomes in soluble form by treatment of the particles with deoxycholic acid. The isolated hydroxylase has been purified approximately 100-fold by gel filtration, ammonium sulfate fractionation, and chromatography on diethylaminoethyl Sephadex. The ratio of activity to P-450 content is increased approximately 1000-fold by purification. Similar but less extensive evidence suggests that microsomal cytochrome b5 may not be a carrier of electrons in methylsterol hydroxylase."

https://openalex.org/W1536814444,"Abstract A new method is described for the isolation of the reduced and S-carboxymethylated light chain derivative of human plasmin. Complete reduction and carboxymethylation of urokinase-activated human plasmin followed by dialysis against 0.002 m NH4HCO3 results in the formation of a precipitate which was shown to be the S-carboxymethylated light chain derivative of human plasmin by gel filtration through Sephadex G-200, carboxyl-terminal amino acid analysis, and diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate-32P and l-1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone-14C incorporation. A complete amino acid composition of the S-carboxymethylated light chain derivative is reported. Reaction of human plasmin with l-1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone-14C resulted in the incorporation of 0.96 ± 0.13 mole of l-1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone-14C per mole of plasmin. Amino acid analysis showed the loss of a single histidine residue and analysis following performic acid oxidation yielded 0.74 residue of 3-carboxymethylhistidine, thus confirming the involvement of a histidine residue. A similar analysis of the S-carboxymethylated light and heavy chain preparations of l-1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone-14C plasmin showed that the single histidine residue in question was located on the light chain of plasmin. The light chain derivative prepared in this manner from diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate-32P-treated human plasmin contains 1 mole of diisopropylphosphoryl-32P per mole of light chain. A peptide map of the tryptic digest of the diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate-32P-treated S-carboxymethylated light chain gave a single radioactive peptide containing histidine but devoid of both tyrosine and tryptophan. The isolated peptide had the composition Lys1, His1, Cys3, Asp2, Thr2, Ser3, diisopropylphosphoryl-32P1, Glu4, Pro1, Gly6, Ala2, Val2, Leu3, Phe1."

https://openalex.org/W1561713943,"Abstract HD formation from either D2 and H2O or H2 and D2O is shown to be catalyzed by N2-fixing extracts of Azotobacter vinelandii. The activity parallels nitrogenase but not hydrogenase activity and is not catalyzed by the sites of nitrogenase responsible for either ATP-dependent H2 evolution or competitive inhibition by H2 of N2 fixation. Requirements in addition to nitrogenase are N2, ATP, and reductant. HD formation occurs only while N2 is being reduced and is inhibited by CO. Other reducible substrates of nitrogenase including N3-, N2O, C2H2, HCN, CH2CHCN, and CH3NC do not support HD formation. The ratio of HD to NH3 formed is directly related to pD2 (0.8 and 4.5 HD per NH3 formed at 0.1 and 0.6 atm of D2, respectively) but not pN2. An exchange reaction is also catalyzed by intermediates of an inorganic model of nitrogenase. An equilibrium mixture of D2, HD, and H2 is formed from D2 and hydrogen atoms of either the aryldiimide- or arylhydrazine-platinum complexes of this model. These biological and model results provide the first evidence for nitrogenase-complexed diimide, hydrazine, and NH3 as intermediates of N2 fixation. It is proposed that protons of intermediates of N2 fixation bound via transiion metal or metals of nitrogenase, e.g. N2H+·nitrogenase, N2H3+·nitrogenase, NH3+·nitrogenase, exchange with D2 bounded to the transition metal or metals. Both D2 and H2 are equally effective competitive inhibitors of N2 fixation with a Ki of 0.2 atm. Protons are the ultimate source of the H2 evolved by nitrogenase based on the ratios of H2:HD:D2 evolved from H2O-D2O mixtures, but appear to be non-rate-limiting since there is no isotope effect (D2O versus H2O) on rates of either reductant-dependent adenosine triphosphatase or N2-fixing activities of nitrogenase."
https://openalex.org/W1609717152,"Abstract 1. A DEAE-Sephadex chromatography step was introduced in the purification of the latent ATPase from chloroplasts (chloroplast coupling factor (CF1)). On elution an inactive protein was obtained, which was reactivated on storage in 2.0 m ammonium sulfate containing 2 mm ATP. 2. Treatment of tritium-labeled acetyl-CF1 with trypsin or heat activated the Ca++-dependent ATPase, but abolished the capacity of CF1 to combine with resolved chloroplast particles. 3. It was shown with tritium-labeled CF1 that a divalent cation such as Mg++ or Ca++ was required for the binding of the protein to the chloroplast membrane. 4. Combination of CF1 with the chloroplast membrane resulted in an increase in the cold stability of the protein. This allotopic property was used as an additional assay for the interaction between CF1 and the membrane. 5. On extraction of chloroplasts with solvents, two fractions, one soluble and one insoluble, were separated. Both were required for the reconstitution of particles that were capable of combining with CF1."

https://openalex.org/W1548279578,"Abstract 1. A crude extract of chloroplasts protected coupling factor 1 from chloroplasts (CF1) against heat inactivation at 64°. Two components present in crude extracts appeared to contribute to this stabilization. Polynucleotides as well as lipids purified from chloroplast extracts conferred heat stability on CF1. 2. RNA from various sources substituted for chloroplast RNA, but distinct differences in effectiveness were noted. No protection was observed either with RNA digested with RNase or with native or denatured DNA. Relatively high concentrations of polycytidylic acid, but not of polyadenylic acid or polyuridylic acid, conferred heat stability. At very high concentration (5 mm) nucleoside triphosphates protected, CTP and UTP being much more effective than the other nucleotides tested. 3. In contrast to RNA, which protected both CF1 and the heat-activated ATPase, the protection by lipids was much more pronounced with CF1 than with ATPase. Moreover, lipids but not RNA protected CF1 against cold inactivation. Dithiothreitol-activated ATPase of CF1 was slightly stimulated by lipids. 4. These findings pointed strongly to a lipid component in the chloroplast membrane as one of the reactants with CF1. They suggested, furthermore, that another component must be responsible for the masking of ATPase activity observed with chloroplast particles."
https://openalex.org/W1819116419,"Abstract A nicotinate ribonucleotide:benzimidazole (adenine) phosphoribosyltransferase which catalyzes the formation of N-α-glycosidic 5'-ribonucleotides occurs in Clostridium sticklandii. The enzyme has been purified 680-fold by a method involving lysozyme treatment, acid precipitation, ammonium sulfate fractionation, and elution from hydroxylapatite and Sephadex columns. The enzyme resembles a corresponding enzyme from Propionibacterium shermanii. An apparently narrower specificity of the present enzyme than of the P. shermanii enzyme for the ribose phosphate donor and a broader specificity for the base may be a consequence of higher purity. The reactivity toward nicotinamide mononucleotide decreases markedly with purification, and most, if not all, of this activity is due to a contaminating nicotinamide mononucleotide deamidase. The present enzyme catalyzes the formation of an N-α-glycosidic adenine nucleotide. Rate studies with varying concentrations of adenine and nicotinate ribonucleotide support a single displacement mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W1531188585,"Abstract In the absence of divalent cations, the adenosine triphosphatase activity of myosin is activated by salts of K+, Rb+, or NH4+ and the extent of activation depends both on the cation and the anion present. In contrast to the specific requirement for the monovalent cations K+, Rb+, or NH4+, all monovalent anions tested increase activity and differ only in the concentration needed to produce a given degree of activation. The effectiveness of various anions in stimulating activity follows the Hofmeister series. Salts of nonactivating cations such as tetramethylammonium chloride increase ATPase activity if an activating monovalent cation is present. The effect of salts on activity is the same in the presence or absence of EDTA, and this compound does not alter the loss of K+-activated ATPase produced by N-ethylmaleimide, indicating that the ATPase activity in the presence of EDTA is actually a K+-activated ATPase. Addition of Ca++ reverses both the effect of salts and the effect of thiol reagents on ATPase activity. Thus the effects of salts and the effects of thiol reagents on enzymic activity depend qualitatively on the nature of the activating cation. The effect of salts on the Ca++-activated ATPase of sulfhydryl-modified myosin depends on the reagent used for modification. The activity of Ca++-activated ATPase of N-ethylmaleimide-modified myosin is increased by monovalent salts, the degree of activation varying with the anion but being the same with all monovalent cations. Modification with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate) or p-mercuribenzoate results in a myosin which is inhibited by salts. In either case, whether salts inhibit or activate, their effectiveness follows the Hofmeister anionic series."

At low ionic strengths of K+, Mg++, and Ca++ the activating effect of carnosine was marked at optimal concentration of ATP, and at levels of ATP in which there was apparent substrate inhibition the effect was very pronounced. The effect of carnosine appears to be specific rather than an ionic strength effect. The lowest concentrations of carnosine and anserine found to be activating were comparable to concentrations found in tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1583456976,"A procedure has been described for photo-oxidation of crystalline sheep heart phosphofructokinase in the presence of methylene blue. The enzyme after photo-oxidation was insensitive to ATP inhibition. Kinetic studies at pH 8.2 before and after photo-oxidation of the enzyme revealed no significant change in the Km for either fructose 6-phosphate or ATP. Kinetic studies at pH 6.9 revealed a decrease in both the Km for ATP and the Km for fructose-6-P in the photo-oxidized enzyme. The Hill coefficient of the enzyme was 3.15 before photo-oxidation and was decreased to 1.1 after photo-oxidation, indicating disappearance of homotropic interactions between different fructose-6-P sites. The photo-oxidized enzyme was not inhibited by citrate nor activated by AMP. The stability of the enzyme at pH 6.5 was increased after photo-oxidation. ATP protected the enzyme against inactivation during photo-oxidation at pH 8.0 but not at pH 6.9. Fructose-6-P, on the other hand, protected the enzyme at both hydrogen ion concentrations. Neither of the two substrates prevented the desensitization of the enzyme to ATP inhibition following photo-oxidation. The results indicate that desensitization of the enzyme to ATP inhibition is related to the presence of the enzyme in a stable conformation."

Rotenone and cyanide are used as respiratory inhibitors in simultaneous observation of reversal of electron transport between cytochrome b measured spectroscopically and cytochrome c measured potentiometrically. Rotenone, malonate, antimycin A, and cyanide are employed to inhibit respiration for observation of reversal of electron transfer between cytochrome a measured spectroscopically and cytochrome c measured potentiometrically. The midpoint potential of cytochrome a at pH 7.4 is estimated to be more than 330 mv. Rotenone alone is used as an inhibitor of electron transfer in a study of the interrelation between the phosphate potential and the reduction potential of cytochrome c in nonrespiring mitochondria; reduction potential changes in cytochrome c are shown to give an accurate estimate of phosphate potential changes in mitochondria. The standard free energy of hydrolysis of bound ATP to bound ADP at pH 7.4 is estimated to be -9.4 kcal. By means of the potentiometric technique with rotenone-inhibited mitochondria to follow phosphate potential changes, the interaction of ion gradient and ion transport with the energy conservation system is investigated by adding calcium, valinomycin, nigericin, or uncoupling agents to alter ion permeability or ion gradients."

Temperature changes between 0° and 40° had no significant effects on calcium ion concentrations established by an EGTA-CaEGTA buffer system. Both initial and basic rates of myosin B ATPase activity showed a constant calcium ion requirement from 20° to 40° with [Ca++] for half-maximal activity of 7.1 ± 1.0 x 10-7 m. During a brief initial period the rate of myofibrillar ATPase activity showed the same calcium ion dependence. The initial high rate of calcium ion-dependent myofibrillar ATPase activity was associated with a rapid increase in absorbance, which lasted for about 1 min at 20° and only 20 set at 37°. After the initial rapid increase in absorbance was complete, the rate of calcium ion-dependent myofibrillar ATPase activity declined (although considerable calcium ion-insensitive ATPase activity remained). The extent to which calcium ion-dependent myofibrillar ATPase activity was lost increased with the extent of syneresis, both factors being promoted by an increase in temperature. At all temperatures there was a correlation between the initial calcium ion-dependent rate of myofibrillar ATPase activity and the over-all rate of the initial rapid increase in absorbance. The decrease in calcium ion-dependent ATPase activity in myofibrils, but not in myosin B, following the rapid phase of syneresis appears to be a consequence of the contractile event."

It was shown that the microsomes contain a heat-labile inhibitory factor, presumably ATPase, and a heat-stable stimulatory factor. The latter was localized in the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum and could be activated by treatment with Pronase. The factor was extractable in lipid solvents and was shown to be phospholipid in nature. Synthetic phospholipids also stimulated fatty acid synthesis, while preliminary treatment of microsomes with phospholipase C removed stimulatory activity. The factor was shown to activate hepatic acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase and presumably stimulated fatty acid synthesis in the soluble fraction by this mechanism."

Two components with different electrophoretic mobilities were observed in all cases, although the separation was least obvious in the light fraction from bovine nasal septum. The fractions with faster electrophoretic mobility have a higher content of chondroitin sulfate, whereas those of lower mobility contain more keratan sulfate and protein. The amino acid composition of the two fractions is significantly different, especially with regard to the content of hydroxy- and dicarboxylic amino acids and glycine. Gel filtration produced no evidence of degradation of the proteinpolysaccharides. It is concluded that at least two types of proteinpolysaccharides with different protein cores exist in the light fraction, one with chondroitin sulfate and the other with keratan sulfate as the predominant mucopolysaccharide."

https://openalex.org/W1551590175,"Abstract Bicarbonate buffer was found to slow down the rate of human plasminogen activation by streptokinase. Increasing the pH of the activation medium from 7 to 10 or increasing the bicarbonate concentration to 0.3 m not only slowed down the rate of activation, but also gradually transformed the normally first order kinetics to a sigmoid pattern of development. The use of borate, instead of bicarbonate, buffer in the same pH and concentration range produced only insignificant changes in the rate of activation. The pH dependence of the bicarbonate effect suggests that the active ionic species is probably carbonate, rather than bicarbonate. The sigmoid pattern of development is interpreted as resulting from a decrease in the rate of formation of activator, a hypothetical streptokinase-proactivator complex, thought to be responsible for the catalytic conversion of plasminogen to plasmin. The use of bicarbonate permitted the detection of the process of activator formation separately from that of activator action, thereby lending support to the activator theory of human plasminogen activation by streptokinase. It is also observed that the pH profile of the proteolytic action of plasmin is markedly affected by bicarbonate. In addition, it is shown that, contrary to prevailing notions, e-aminocaproic acid does not prevent completely plasminogen activation by streptokinase, when measured by the casein assay. In the presence of bicarbonate, however, this inhibition is complete."
