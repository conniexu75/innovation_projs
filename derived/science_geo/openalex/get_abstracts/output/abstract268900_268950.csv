https://openalex.org/W2016355139,"Plant foliage accumulates the vapor of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's) from the atmosphere, and there is a variation in the amount that is accumulated from one plant species to another. This differential accumulation factor between species remains constant over more than two orders of magnitude of PCB concentrations in plants. The relationships between foliar and atmospheric PCB concentrations hold promise for cost-effective atmospheric PCB monitoring through foliar analyses."
https://openalex.org/W2058398028,"Field-grown pearl millet (Pennisetum americanum) and guinea grass (Panicum maximum), lightly fertilized and inoculated with Spirillum lipoferum, produced significantly higher yields of dry matter than did uninoculated controls. Up to 42 and 39 kilograms of nitrogen per hectare were replaced by inoculation for pearl millet and guinea grass, respectively. The data demonstrate that nitrogen fixation by these grass-Spirillum systems is efficient and is achieved at a reasonable energy cost to the plant."
https://openalex.org/W2081775139,"Sediment traps were deployed at several depths between 660 and 3800 meters in the Panama Basin. The flux of lithogenic particles increased with increasing depth. This increase was due primarily to particles of beidellite (a smectite clay), which was identical to the clay occurring in bottom sediment on the continental slope to the west of the sediment trap mooring. The beidellite vertical flux at the Panama Basin station increased when an easterly current prevailed and decreased when the current reversed, indicating that a major portion of smectite was transported horizontally at mid-water depth to the mooring site from the nearby continental slope."
https://openalex.org/W2034392019,"Tetravalent thorium, pentavalent protactinium, hexavalent uranium, and plutonium (oxidation state uncertain) are present in much higher concentrations in Mono Lake, a saline, alkaline lake in eastern central California, than in seawater. Low ratios of actinium to protactinium and of americium to plutonium indicate that the concentrations of trivalent actinides are not similarly enhanced. The elevated concentrations of the ordinarily very insoluble actinides are maintained in solution by natural ligands, which inhibit their chemical removal from the water column, rather than by an unusually large rate of supply."
https://openalex.org/W1980361268,"Several radioisotopes of the naturally occurring uranium and thorium decay series, in addition to fallout plutonium, have unusually high concentrations in the water column of Mono Lake, a natural alkaline, saline lake. Complexing by carbonate ions appears to be responsible for the enhanced solubility of actinide elements with oxidation states of IV to VI. In contrast, fallout strontium-90 has been largely removed from the water, probably as a result of coprecipitation with calcium carbonate. The daughter/parent activity ratios of thorium, radium, and uranium isotopes suggest that thorium is removed from the water column to the sediments on time scales substantially longer than a month and that the desorption of thorium from the sediments to the water column requires less than a few years."
https://openalex.org/W2055016886,The estimated median accuracy of 194 single-day determinations of the earth's angular position in space is 0.7 millisecond (0.01 arc second). Comparison with classical astronomical results gives agreement to about the expected 2-millisecond uncertainty of the 5-day averages obtained by the Bureau International de l'Heure. Little evidence for very rapid variations in the earth's rotation is present in the data.
https://openalex.org/W2013074858,Concentrations of cloud condensation nuclei measured along the East Coast from Virginia to Long Island ranged from 1000 to 3500 per cubic centimeter as compared to 100 per cubic centimeter in clean maritime air and 300 per cubic centimeter in continental air. The global anthropogenic production rate of cloud condensation nuclei may be comparable to the natural production rate; in some industrial areas cloud condensation nuclei are dominated by anthropogenic sources.

The three-dimensional distribution of suspended material and its rate of diffusion are indicated after digital processing of the data."
https://openalex.org/W1979496112,"The astronauts on Skylab 4 observed bursts of intense visual light flash activity when their spacecraft passed through the South Atlantic Anomaly. Flash rates as high as 20 per minute have in the past been considered unexpectedly high. When the effect of nuclear interactions in and near the retina is included, the apparent anomaly is removed."

https://openalex.org/W2094347530,"The bulk of the sun's radiation is in the visible and infrared. Solar radiation at these wavelengths controls the weather in the lowest levels of the earth's atmosphere. The rate at which this energy is emitted (the so-called solar constant) varies by a few tenths of 1 percent over a time scale of days. Longer period variations may exist, but have yet to be detected. Far more variable are the amounts of energy emitted as ultraviolet, extreme ultraviolet, and x-rays, and in the continuous outflow of ionized solar particles. The latter controls the properties of the space between the earth and the sun as well as those of the earth's magnetosphere. The ultraviolet and particle emissions control the properties of the earth's upper atmosphere, including the global wind circulation and changes therein associated with intense auroral storms. While considerable progress has been made in exploring the solar-terrestrial system since the advent of space research, many problems remain. These include the question of how magnetic energy is converted into ionized particle energy in the sun and in the earth's magnetosphere, the way in which solar and terrestrial magnetic fields join or merge, and how large electric fields are generated and sustained a few thousand kilometers above the earth's poles. Perhaps the most intriguing question concerns the possible relation between solar variability and the earth's weather and climate."
https://openalex.org/W1977565315,"The potential for energy conservation through increased use of steel scrap by the U.S. steel industry is examined. It is concluded that increased use of scrap would reduce energy use, but it is not economical, due mainly to volatile scrap prices. Other energy-saving technologies exist, but it is likely that energy will be conserved through reduced use of steel as rising energy costs are passed through to consumers."

https://openalex.org/W2139018818,"Early this year, the U.S. land-based force of nuclear missiles became vulnerable-on paper-to destruction in a preemptive attack by the Soviet Union. The Air Force has worried about this problem for a long time, searching high and low for a better place to put both the existing, silo-based Minuteman missiles and a new missile, the MX. Under the Carter Admnistration, the Air Force agreed to a missle basing plan known as MPS, for multiple protective shelters. The Reagan Administration has ostensibly dropped this plan in favour of several alternatives. Previous articles in this series explored why U.S. officials became alarmed about missile vulnerability; the genesis of a short-term plan to put more missiles into silos; continuing Air Force opposition to a plan for missiles on constantly roving aricraft; and a bizare plan to bury missiles deep underground."

This misidentification in no way changes the conclusions about these plant substances."
