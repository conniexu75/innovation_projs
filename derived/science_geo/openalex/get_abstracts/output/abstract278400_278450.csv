https://openalex.org/W1969991238,"The network of strong motion accelerographs in Mexico includes instruments that were installed, under an international cooperative research program, in sites selected for the high potenial of a large earthquake. The 19 September 1985 earthquake (magnitude 8.1) occurred in a seismic gap where an earthquake was expected. As a result, there is an excellent descripton of the ground motions that caused the disaster."
https://openalex.org/W2029818683,"Coastal uplift associated with the great Mexican earthquake of 19 September 1985 and its principal aftershock produced widespread mortality of intertidal organisms along the coast of the states of Michoacán and Guerrero, Mexico. Measurements of the vertical extent of mortality at ten sites provided estimates of the magnitude of the vertical component of deformation along the coast. Within the affected area, uplift ranged from about 12 centimeters to about 1 meter, and no subsidence was observed. The observations are consistent with models of the tectonic deformation that results from buried slip on a shallow-dipping underthrust fault."

The eruption was largely subaqueous, taking place in the 180-m-deep crater lake, and resulted in the emergence of a steep-sided island. The mild character of the eruption and the absence of seismic activity stand in direct contrast to the highly explosive character of the eruption of 1902 to 1903."
https://openalex.org/W2074790128,"Direct catalytic hydration of terminal alkenes to primary alcohols would be an inexpensive route to industrially useful alcohols and a convenient synthetic route for the synthesis of terminal alcohols in general. The reaction between trans- PtHCl(PMe(3))(2) (where Me = CH(3)) and sodium hydroxide in a one-to-one mixture of water and 1-hexene yields a species that, at 60 degrees C and in the presence of the phasetransfer catalyst benzyltriethylammonium chloride, catalyzes selective hydration of 1-hexene to n-hexanol at a rate of 6.9 +/- 0.2 turnovers per hour. Hydration of 1-dodecene to n-dodecanol occurs at a rate of 8.3 +/- 0.4 turnovers per hour at 100 degrees C. Deuterium labeling experiments with trans-PtDCl(PMe(3))(2) show that hydration involves reductive elimination of a C-H bond. At low hydroxide concentrations (<8 equivalents), hydration of the water-soluble olefin 3-butene-1-ol to 1,4-butanediol exhibited a first-order dependence on hydroxide concentration for loss of catalytic activity. This suggests that hydroxide attacks the coordinated alkene slowly. At high hydroxide concentrations, the rate of catalysis was hydroxide-independent and first order in alkene. Substitution of coordinated water (k(1) = 9.3 +/- 0.5 x 10(-3) liters per mol per second) appears to be limitng under these conditions."

The rising nation, in the late 19th century, established the seat of that sovereignty in its universities. Today those institutions have come to be regarded as contract research centers at the service of the federal government. Research contracts in support of the proposed Strategic Defense Initiative are pressed on them against the consensus of the scientific community that holds this ""Star Wars"" enterprise to be technically infeasible. The time has come to reconstruct the relation between the federal government and university science in the spirit of our social contract."
