Rodriques et al. developed a method called Slide-seq, whereby RNA was spatially resolved from tissue sections by transfer onto a surface covered with DNA-barcoded beads. Applying Slide-seq to regions of a mouse brain revealed spatial gene expression patterns in the Purkinje layer of the cerebellum and axes of variation across Purkinje cell compartments. The authors used this method to dissect the temporal evolution of cell type–specific responses in a mouse model of traumatic brain injury. Science , this issue p. 1463"

The chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis was identified in amphibian populations about 20 years ago and has caused death and species extinction at a global scale. Scheele et al. found that the fungus has caused declines in amphibian populations everywhere except at its origin in Asia (see the Perspective by Greenberg and Palen). A majority of species and populations are still experiencing decline, but there is evidence of limited recovery in some species. The analysis also suggests some conditions that predict resilience.

However, most implementations rely on expensive chromophores to absorb light. Fu et al. now show that a pair of cheap components acting in concert can induce these reactions, despite not being strong visible absorbers individually. The combination of sodium iodide and triphenylphosphine allowed photoinduced electron transfer to catalyze a variety of alkylations. Science , this issue p. 1429"
https://openalex.org/W2924300946,"A paradox of tumor immunology is that tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes are dysfunctional in situ, yet are capable of stem cell-like behavior including self-renewal, expansion, and multipotency, resulting in the eradication of large metastatic tumors. We find that the overabundance of potassium in the tumor microenvironment underlies this dichotomy, triggering suppression of T cell effector function while preserving stemness. High levels of extracellular potassium constrain T cell effector programs by limiting nutrient uptake, thereby inducing autophagy and reduction of histone acetylation at effector and exhaustion loci, which in turn produces CD8+ T cells with improved in vivo persistence, multipotency, and tumor clearance. This mechanistic knowledge advances our understanding of T cell dysfunction and may lead to novel approaches that enable the development of enhanced T cell strategies for cancer immunotherapy."

Pa infections frequently result in considerable morbidity and mortality. Sweere et al. found that a type of temperate filamentous bacteriophage that infects and integrates into Pa is associated with chronic human wound infections. Likewise, wounds in mice colonized with phage-infected Pa were more severe and longer-lasting than those colonized by Pa alone. Immune cell uptake of phage-infected Pa resulted in phage RNA production and inappropriate antiviral immune responses, impeding bacterial clearance. Both phage vaccination and transfer of antiphage antibodies were protective against Pa infection. Science , this issue p. eaat9691"

Because of the lagging response, photosynthesis is less efficient, and excess water is lost through the open pores. Papanatsiou et al. introduced a blue light–responsive ion channel into stomata of the small mustard plant Arabidopsis. The channel increased the rate of stomata opening and closing in response to light. The engineered plants produced more biomass, especially in the fluctuating light conditions typical of outdoor growth. Science , this issue p. 1456"

But how well do these areas withstand pressure from human activity in surrounding landscapes? Veldhuis et al. studied long-term data from the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem in East Africa. Human activities at boundary regions cause animals to concentrate in the core of the protected area, which eventually reduces soil carbon storage and nitrogen fixation rates and increases vulnerability to extreme droughts. Similar patterns are likely for many, if not all, large protected areas. Science , this issue p. 1424"

Here, we investigated how IL-6 signals and modifies gene expression in differentiated osteoblasts and osteocytes and determined whether these activities can promote bone formation or support osteoclastogenesis. Moreover, we used a genetically altered mouse with circulating levels of the pharmacological IL-6 trans-signaling inhibitor sgp130-Fc to determine whether IL-6 trans-signaling is required for normal bone growth and remodeling. We found that IL-6 increases suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (Socs3) and CCAAT enhancer-binding protein δ (Cebpd) mRNA levels and promotes signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation by both cis- and trans-signaling in cultured osteocytes. In contrast, RANKL (Tnfsf11) mRNA levels were elevated only by trans-signaling. Furthermore, we observed soluble IL-6 receptor release and ADAM metallopeptidase domain 17 (ADAM17) sheddase expression by osteocytes. Despite the observation that IL-6 cis-signaling occurs, IL-6 stimulated bone formation in vivo only via trans-signaling. Although IL-6 stimulated RANKL (Tnfsf11) mRNA in osteocytes, these cells did not support osteoclast formation in response to IL-6 alone; binucleated TRAP+ cells formed, and only in response to trans-signaling. Finally, pharmacological, sgp130-Fc–mediated inhibition of IL-6 trans-signaling did not impair bone growth or remodeling unless mice had circulating sgp130-Fc levels > 10 μg/ml. At those levels, osteopenia and impaired bone growth occurred, reducing bone strength. We conclude that high sgp130-Fc levels may have detrimental off-target effects on the skeleton.

https://openalex.org/W2923564700,"Cost-effective heat mitigation strategies are imperative for maintaining milk production and dairy farm profitability in the U.S. with projected climate change. This study investigated the cost-effectiveness of four heat abatement strategies, including Minimal (open barn or shading), Moderate (forced ventilation), High (fans and misting), and Intense (air conditioning). Heat stress and subsequent impacts on milk production per cow were predicted across nine climatic regions in the U.S. for early (2015 to 2034), mid (2045 to 2064) and late (2081 to 2100) 21st century, using downscaled climate projections. Heat abatements were used to adjust predicted milk production losses and illustrate the potential to reduce milk production losses due to heat stress. Economic analysis included a cost-benefit ratio calculation associated with the implementation of each heat abatement. Results showed that milk production losses were expected to accelerate across the U.S. at a mean rate of 174±7 kg/cow/decade, with the fastest rate in the Southeast region. Relative to Minimal heat abatement, Moderate, High, and Intense heat abatements increased annual milk production per cow by 3%, 4%, and 6% during early-21st century, 3%, 6%, and 11% during mid-21st century, and 3%, 8%, and 21% during late-21st century, respectively. The cost effectiveness of different heat abatement strategies generally increased with subsequently stronger heat abatements. In mid- and late-21st century, mean annual net values of High and Intense heat stress abatement implementation approached -$30 to $190 /cow and -$20 to $590 /cow, respectively, with the largest net annual benefit in late-21st century under Intense abatement. Findings from the study demonstrate the value of using downscaled climate projections to shed light on local and regional strategies to abate heat stress on cattle and mitigate potential milk production losses due to climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2930577892,"Background Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQL) represent individuals’ subjective assessment of their mental and physical well-being, and is highly predictive of future health. C-reactive protein (CRP) is a well-established marker of inflammation. Low-grade inflammation (LGI), defined as slightly increased CRP levels, is associated with increased risk of several diseases. LGI may reflect subclinical pathology, which could affect individual’s subjective health assessment. This study aimed to examine whether LGI has an independent impact on self-reported health or rather is a mediator of a confounder in a large population of healthy individuals. Methods Plasma CRP levels were measured in 17,024 participants from the Danish Blood Donor Study (DBDS). All participants completed a standard questionnaire including smoking status, and the 12-item short-form health survey (SF-12), which is a widely used scale for HRQL. SF-12 is reported as a mental (MCS) and physical (PCS) score. The relationship between LGI (defined as a plasma CRP level between 3 mg/L and 10 mg/L) and MCS or PCS was explored by mediation analysis and adjusted multivariable linear regression analysis. Multiple imputation modelling was used to remedy missing values. The analyses were stratified according to sex and use of combined oral contraception (OC). Results In the study, 1,542 (10.3%) participants had LGI. PCS was associated with LGI in all strata, i.e. women using OC: RC = -0.36 points lower PCS in participants with LGI vs no LGI, CI: -0.94 to -0.19, women not using OC: RC = -0.63, CI: -1.05 to -0.21 and men: RC = -0.76, CI: -1.10 to -0.42. But LGI had no impact on MCS. Predictors of lower PCS included obesity, current smoking, and waist circumference in all strata. Physical activity in leisure time was the only factor positively associated with PCS. Age and physical activity in leisure time was associated with increased MCS in all strata whereas current smoking was the only strong predictor of a reduction in MCS. Only a small effect of smoking on PCS was mediated through LGI. Conclusion In this population of healthy individuals, LGI had independent impact on lower self-rated physical health score in HRQL in both sexes, but was not associated with self-rated mental health score. A small and significant effect of smoking on physical health score was mediated through LGI."
https://openalex.org/W2928274172,"Background Achieving fair access to healthcare and improving population health are crucial in all settings. Properly staffed and fairly distributed primary health care (PHC) facilities are prerequisites to ensure accessible healthcare services. Nevertheless, availability and accessibility issues are common public health concerns, especially in under-resourced countries including Ethiopia. Measuring inequalities in accessibility of healthcare resources guide policy decisions to improve PHC services and ultimately achieving universal health coverage (UHC). Purpose To assess availability and measure magnitude and trend of inequalities in accessibility of health centre-based PHC resources in Ethiopia during 2015 to 2017. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional population-based analysis of district-level data collected from 16th December 2017 until 24th May 2018. Afar, Dire-Dawa, and Tigray regions were purposefully included in the study to represent the four pastoralist/semi-pastoralist, three urban and four agrarian regions in Ethiopia, respectively. We used ratios, different inequality indices and Gini decomposition techniques to characterise the inequalities. Results In 2017, median of health centres (HCs) per 15,000 inhabitants and their Gini indices (GIs) for Afar, Dire-Dawa, and Tigray were 0.781, 0.566, 0.591 vs. 0.237, 0.280, 0.216 respectively. Median overall skilled health workers (SHWs) per 10,000 inhabitants were 5.250, 7.539, and 6.246, respectively. These accounted for 11.80%, 16.94% and 14.04% of the WHO target of 44.5 to achieve SDGs. The corresponding GIs for the regions were 0.347, 0.186 and 0.175. Despite a higher overall SHWs inequality in the urban districts of Tigray (GI = 0.301), only Tigray showed significant inequality reductions in GHE (p < 0.001) and in all categories of SHWs (p < 0.05). Conclusions Our analysis provided a clear picture of availability and inequalities in PHC resources across three regions in Ethiopia. Identifying contributing factors to low densities and high inequalities of SHWs may help improve PHC services nationwide, along with pathway towards UHC."

The present study assessed the effect and mechanism of long-term, real-world airborne particulate matter (PM) exposure on oxidative stress and hepatic steatosis in the context of a standard chow diet (STD) and a high-fat diet (HFD); the study further explored whether a combination of PM exposure and HFD treatment exacerbates the adverse effects in mice.C57BL/6J mice fed with STD or HFD (41.26% kcal fat) were exposed to PM or filtered air (FA) for 5 months. Lipid metabolism, oxidative stress and liver pathogenesis were evaluated. Real-time PCR and western blotting were performed to determine gene expression and molecular signal transduction in liver.Chronic airborne PM exposure impaired oxidative homeostasis, caused inflammation and induced hepatic steatosis in mice. Further investigation found that exposure to real-world PM increased the expression of hepatic Nrf2 and Nrf2-regulated antioxidant enzyme gene. The increased protein expression of the sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) and fatty acid synthase (FAS) in the liver were also observed in PM-exposed groups. Furthermore, the combination of PM exposure and HFD treatment caused a synergistic effect on the changes of lipid accumulation oxidative stress, inflammation in the mouse liver.Through in vivo study, we reveal that the combination of real-world ambient PM exposure and HFD treatment aggravates hepatic lipid metabolism disorders, inflammation and oxidative stress. PM exposure may accelerate the progression to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis by regulating SREBP-1c/FAS regulatory axis."

We previously reported that human hepatoma cells with mitochondrial defects exhibit down-regulated lactate dehydrogenase subunit B (LDHB) expression. Here, using several molecular and biochemical assays and informatics analyses, we investigated how LDHB suppression regulates mitochondrial respiratory activity and contributes to liver cancer progression. We found that transcriptional LDHB down-regulation is an upstream event during suppressed oxidative phosphorylation. We also observed that LDHB knockdown increases inhibitory phosphorylation of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) via lactate-mediated PDH kinase (PDK) activation and thereby attenuates oxidative phosphorylation activity. Interestingly, monocarboxylate transporter 1 was the major lactate transporter in hepatoma cells, and its expression was essential for PDH phosphorylation by modulating intracellular lactate levels. Finally, bioinformatics analysis of the hepatocellular carcinoma cohort from The Cancer Genome Atlas revealed that a low LDHB/LDHA ratio is statistically significantly associated with poor prognostic outcomes. A low ratio was also associated with a significant enrichment in glycolysis genes and negatively correlated with PDK1 and 2 expression, supporting a close link between LDHB suppression and the PDK–PDH axis. These results suggest that LDHB suppression is a key mechanism that enhances glycolysis and is critically involved in the maintenance and propagation of mitochondrial dysfunction via lactate release in liver cancer progression.

Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is another key enzyme in determining cellular bioenergetic flow, cellular dependence on glycolytic ATP generation, and oxidative mitochondrial activity. LDH uses the redox power of NADH to catalyze reversible conversion between pyruvate and lactate. Enzymatically functional LDH is a tetramer formed by diverse combinations of two different gene products encoded by LDHA and LDHB genes, which ultimately form five different isozymes: LDH1 (B4), LDH2 (AB3), LDH3 (A2B2), LDH4 (A3B), and LDH5 (A4) (26Drent M.

LDH5 preferentially catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to lactate, and its increased expression and activity is linked to the glycolytic phenotype and metastatic activity in many cancers (27Koukourakis M.I.

Some studies show that LDH5 activity is mainly enhanced because of increased LDHA expression via the interplay of HIF-1α and cMyc (15Dang C.V. Kim J.W. Gao P. Yustein J.

However, we recently reported an LDH isozyme shift toward LDH5 in hepatoma cells, which was unexpectedly achieved by LDHB down-expression rather than LDHA up-expression (30Kim J.H. Kim E.L. Lee Y.K.

Moreover, this LDHB suppression restrained mitochondrial respiration, providing a model to elucidate the mechanism by which enhanced glycolysis regulates mitochondrial respiratory activity. In the present study, we demonstrate that LDHB suppression induced enhanced glycolysis, which lowered mitochondrial respiratory activity via lactate-mediated modulation of the PDK–PDH axis. These findings support an interplay between the tumoral bioenergetics phenomena of aerobic glycolysis and mitochondrial dysfunction in the absence of hypoxic or oncogenic stimulus, emphasizing the glycolytic control of mitochondrial activity. We first examined the metabolic status of three different Seoul National University hepatoma cells (SNU387, SNU354, and SNU423) and of the normal liver cell clone Ch-L (30Kim J.H. Kim E.L. Lee Y.K.

Compared with SNU387 and Ch-L, SNU354 and SNU423 showed a clear isoenzyme shift toward LDH5 (Fig. 1A) and harbored decreased LDHB protein expression, showing a low LDHB/LDHA ratio (Fig. 1B). SNU354 and SNU423 cells also exhibited decreased LDHB mRNA levels (Fig. 1C), implying its transcriptional control. Notably, SNU354 exhibited almost complete suppression of LDHB protein, which corresponded well to its LDH5 activity. The low LDHB levels in SNU354 and SNU423 cells were also accompanied by a significantly decreased cellular oxygen consumption rates (OCR) (Fig. 1D), suggesting a possible mechanistic association between the two phenotypes. In SNU387 hepatoma cells (which showed high LDHB expression), LDHB suppression by siRNA-mediated knockdown effectively induced an LDH isozyme shift toward LDH5, indicating dependence on LDHB level (Fig. 1, E and F). Unfortunately, to generate complete isozyme shift toward LDH5 using siRNA-mediated LDHB knockdown was not easy, implying that additional mechanisms, such as LDHA phosphorylation (31Jin L. Chun J.

Ishikawa J. Sugimura H. Sugano K. Kanno T. Promoter hypermethylation in cancer silences LDHB, eliminating lactate dehydrogenase isoenzymes 1–4.Clin. Chem. 2003; 49 (12928234): 1518-152010.1373/49.9.1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), might be required. Nevertheless, partial LDH isozyme shift by LDHB knockdown was enough to significantly decrease OCR, without alteration of OXPHOS subunit expressions (Fig. 1, E–G). Although LDHA suppression shifted LDH isozyme toward LDH1, it did not affect OCR (Fig. 1, E–G), showing specificity of the inhibitory effect of LDHB suppression on OCR. To further test the causal relationship, we exposed SNU387 cells to respiratory inhibitors such as antimycin A (complex III inhibitor) and oligomycin (complex V inhibitor) and found that LDHA and LDHB levels were unaltered (Fig. 1H). Similar results were obtained with Ch-L cell (Fig. 1, I–L). These results indicated that LDHB suppression-mediated LDH5 activation occurred upstream of OXPHOS activity suppression. We next investigated the mechanism underlying the regulation of OXPHOS activity via LDHB suppression. LDHB knockdown did not affect protein expressions of OXPHOS subunits (Fig. 1F), and the LDHB-mediated LDH isozyme shift could potentially alter cellular lactate and pyruvate levels; therefore, we examined whether LDHB level controlled the overall OXPHOS flux through PDH activity. LDHB knockdown increased inhibitory phosphorylation of PDH, without stabilizing HIF-1α (Fig. 2A) and induction of mRNA expressions of all four PDK isoforms (Fig. 2B). Moreover, the specific PDK inhibitor dichloroacetate (DCA) effectively abolished the PDH phosphorylation induced by LDHB knockdown (Fig. 2C). This suggested that PDK activity was critically involved in LDHB suppression-mediated PDH phosphorylation. Similarly, SNU354 and SNU423, which harbor low LDHB expression and decreased OXPHOS activity, exhibited enhanced PDH phosphorylation (Fig. 2D). Moreover, overexpression of LDHB in SNU423 cells shifted LDH isozyme toward LDH1 (Fig. 2E) and decreased PDH phosphorylation status (Fig. 2F). These results explained that LDHB suppression played a key role in PDH inactivation and consequent OXPHOS control in hepatoma cells. We further confirmed the high glycolytic activity of SNU354 and SNU423 cells, based on cellular glucose consumption, lactate release, and medium acidity (Fig. 3, A and B). Additionally, LDHB knockdown in SNU387 cells (with high LDHB) increased both glucose consumption and lactate release into the medium (Fig. 3C), indicating that LDHB suppression was sufficient to enhance the cellular glycolytic phenotype. These findings suggested that released lactate might control cellular PDH activity, and the subsequent OXPHOS activity. Lactate levels in the glycolytic tumor microenvironment are generally within the range of 5–20 mm (34Kato Y. Maeda T. Suzuki A. Baba Y. Cancer metabolism: new insights into classic characteristics.Jpn. Dent. Sci. Rev. 2018; 54 (29628997): 8-2110.1016/j.jdsr.2017.08.003Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 35Walenta S.

We exposed SNU387 cells to lactic acid (LA) levels within this range and observed dose-dependent increases in PDH phosphorylation, without alterations of PDK mRNA (Fig. 3, D and E). These results indicated that lactate released by LDHB suppression augmented PDH phosphorylation in an autocrinal or paracrinal mode. We also examined the time course effect of LA on both PDH phosphorylation and cellular OCR. Exposure of SNU387 cells to 20 mm LA in fresh medium gradually increased PDH phosphorylation over a time course (Fig. 4A, upper panels), whereas medium change alone decreased the phosphorylation (Fig. 4A, lower panels). Consistent with the PDH phosphorylation status, OCR significantly decreased upon LA treatment without alteration of OXPHOS subunit expressions (Fig. 4, B and C), suggesting that LA may regulate OXPHOS activity via PDH phosphorylation (inactivation). Next, we asked whether the PDH phosphorylation is due to lactate per se or the acidic environment. Because extracellular pH values in solid tumors have a pH level of ∼6.5 (36Parks S.K. Chiche J. Pouysségur J. Disrupting proton dynamics and energy metabolism for cancer therapy.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2013; 13 (23969692): 611-62310.1038/nrc3579Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 37Lutz N.W.

Medium containing 20 mm LA (pH 6.5) gradually enhanced PDH phosphorylation over a time course, whereas medium containing with 20 mm LA (pH 7.8) showed results similar to those with medium replenishment alone (Fig. 4D). The effect of pH 7.8 medium was confirmed by exposure to different concentrations of sodium lactate up to 30 mm (Fig. 4F). These results clearly indicated that lactate per se without acidity did not affect PDH phosphorylation. Moreover, PDH phosphorylation was not affected by acidification alone of media without lactate (Fig. 4E). Consistently, LA treatment significantly augmented intracellular lactate level, compared with sodium lactate treatment (Fig. 4G), implying that proton concentration facilitated lactate import across cell plasma membrane. These results supported the possibility that lactic acidosis, combined action of lactate level and acidity, by LA treatment was required for intracellular PDH phosphorylation. We further confirmed that lactic acidosis-mediated PDH phosphorylation and OCR inhibition were clearly resolved by pharmacological PDK inhibition (Fig. 4, H and I). Overall, these results indicated that lactic acidosis decreased OXPHOS activity via PDK-mediated PDH inactivation. Lactic acid is transported across the plasma membrane by proton-linked monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs), mainly MCT1–4 (38Halestrap A.P. The monocarboxylate transporter family: structure and functional characterization.IUBMB Life. 2012; 64 (22131303): 1-910.1002/iub.573Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 39Halestrap A.P.

Interestingly, all four examined cell lines showed very high MCT1 mRNA levels (Fig. 5A), compared with mRNA levels of other MCTs (MCT2–4). Bioinformatic analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma (TCGA-LIHC) open database confirmed that LIHC tissues expressed MCT1 at a higher level than MCT2–4 (Fig. 5C), implying a key role of MCT1 in lactate transport in hepatoma cells. SNU354 and SNU423 cells showed markedly high MCT2 expression (Fig. 5A), whereas MCT2 levels were barely detectable in Ch-L and SNU387 cells. Relative mRNA levels of MCT1 and MCT2 in all tested cells were further confirmed by conventional RT-PCR (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, in SNU387 cells, LDHB knockdown attenuated MCT1, MCT3, and MCT4 expression (Fig. 5D), whereas knockdown of MCT1 or MCT2 did not affect LDHB expression (Fig. 5E). These results suggested that LDHB expression is linked to MCT expression and may act as an upstream regulator. We next examined whether lactate transport via MCTs was critical for PDH phosphorylation. Because all four cell lines showed much higher expression of MCT1 compared with MCT2, MCT3, and MCT4, we investigated whether MCT1-mediated lactate transport influenced PDH phosphorylation. In the two glycolytic hepatoma cells (SNU354 and SNU423), which possess high lactate production capacity (Fig. 3A), MCT1 knockdown increased intracellular lactate levels and further augmented PDH phosphorylation status (Fig. 5, F and G). These findings suggested that MCT1 played a key role as a lactate exporter in glycolytic hepatoma cells and that high intracellular lactate regulated PDH phosphorylation. We further investigated whether extracellular lactic acidosis could impact intracellular PDH phosphorylation via MCT-mediated lactate import. As expected, the MCT1/2-specific inhibitor α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHC) (40Miranda-Gonçalves V. Honavar M. Pinheiro C. Martinho O. Pires M.M. Pinheiro C. Cordeiro M. Bebiano G. Costa P.

Similar results were also obtained in SNU354 and SNU423 cells (Fig. 5H), implying that lactate could act in an autocrinal mode. Together, our findings suggested that increased intracellular lactate may inhibit mitochondrial OXPHOS activity via PDH phosphorylation, indicating a potential role of lactate as a key player in both autocrinal maintenance and paracrinal propagation of OXPHOS dysfunction. We performed Kaplan–Meier survival analysis to compare clinical outcomes between LDHB-high and LDHB-low expression groups from the TCGA-LIHC cohort. Unexpectedly, we found no significant differences (data not shown). We also could not find any negative association between LDHA and LDHB mRNA levels in the TCGA-LIHC cohort (Fig. 6A). Thus, we hypothesized that individual hepatoma cells may exhibit either LDHB suppression or LDHA induction, such that the LDHB/LDHA ratio may represent the glycolytic status in heterogeneous LIHC tissue context. Interestingly, the low LDHB/LDHA group (n = 93) displayed a poor prognosis with significantly shorter survival compared with the high LDHB/LDHA group (Fig. 6B). Moreover, the low LDHB/LDHA group showed significantly higher LDHA and lower LDHB expression (Fig. 6C). These results suggested that individual LIHC tumor tissue may acquire the LDH5 isozyme via one strategy, either LDHA induction or LDHB suppression. Next, we evaluated whether the LDHB/LDHA ratio was truly associated with an overall metabolic shift from OXPHOS to glycolysis. Gene set enr"

Treatment includes ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), but it is not clear if UDCA protects the fetus. This study explores the placental transport of the bile acid taurocholate (TC) by the organic anion–transporting polypeptide, (OATP)4A1, its effects on the placental proteome and vascular function, and how these are modified by UDCA. Various methodological approaches including placental villous fragments and Xenopus laevis oocytes were used to investigate UDCA transport. Placental perfusions and myography investigated the effect of TC on vasculature. The effects of acute TC exposure on placental tissue were investigated using quantitative proteomics. UDCA inhibited OATP4A1 activity in placental villous fragments and oocytes. TC induced vasoconstriction in placental and rat vasculature, which was attenuated by UDCA. Quantitative proteomic analysis of villous fragments showed direct effects of TC on multiple placental pathways, including oxidative stress and autophagy. The effects of TC on the placental proteome and vasculature demonstrate how bile acids may cause fetal distress in ICP. UDCA inhibition of OATP4A1 suggests it will protect the mother and fetus against the vascular effects of TC by inhibiting its cellular uptake. UDCA may protect the fetus in ICP by inhibiting OATP4A1-mediated bile acid transfer and TC-induced placental vasoconstriction. Understanding the physiologic mechanisms of UDCA may allow better therapeutic interventions to be designed specifically for the fetus in the future.—Lofthouse, E.

https://openalex.org/W2933063538,"MicroRNAs (miRs) are important posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression. Besides their well-characterized inhibitory effects on mRNA stability and translation, miRs can also activate gene expression. In this study, we identified a novel noncanonical function of miR-574-5p. We found that miR-574-5p acts as an RNA decoy to CUG RNA-binding protein 1 (CUGBP1) and antagonizes its function. MiR-574-5p induces microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1) expression by preventing CUGBP1 binding to its 3′UTR, leading to an enhanced alternative splicing and generation of an mPGES-1 3′UTR isoform, increased mPGES-1 protein expression, PGE2 formation, and tumor growth in vivo. miR-574-5p–induced tumor growth in mice could be completely inhibited with the mPGES-1 inhibitor OIL Moreover, miR-574-5p is induced by IL-1β and is strongly overexpressed in human nonsmall cell lung cancer where high mPGES-1 expression correlates with a low survival rate.

https://openalex.org/W2926607850,"Spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) is a signaling node in many immune pathways and comprises two tandem Src homology (SH) 2 domains, an SH2-kinase linker, and a C-terminal tyrosine kinase domain. Two prevalent models of SYK activation exist. The OR-gate model contends that SYK can be fully activated by phosphorylation or binding of its SH2 domains to a dual-phosphorylated immune-receptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ppITAM). An alternative model proposes that SYK activation requires ppITAM binding and phosphorylation of the SH2-kinase linker by a SRC family kinase such as LYN proto-oncogene, SRC family tyrosine kinase (LYN). To evaluate these two models, we generated directly comparable unphosphorylated (upSYK) and phosphorylated (pSYK) proteins with or without an N-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST) tag, resulting in monomeric or obligatory dimeric SYK, respectively. We assessed the ability of a ppITAM peptide and LYN to activate these SYK proteins. The ppITAM peptide strongly activated GST-SYK but was less effective in activating upSYK untagged with GST. LYN alone activated untagged upSYK to a greater extent than did ppITAM, and inclusion of both proteins rapidly and fully activated upSYK. Using immunoblot and phosphoproteomic approaches, we correlated the kinetics and order of site-specific SYK phosphorylation. Our results are consistent with the alternative model, indicating that ppITAM binding primes SYK for rapid LYN-mediated phosphorylation of Tyr-352 and then Tyr-348 of the SH2-kinase linker, which facilitates activation loop phosphorylation and full SYK activation. This gradual activation mechanism may also explain how SYK maintains ligand-independent tonic signaling, important for B-cell development and survival."
https://openalex.org/W2924922555,"Diacylglycerol (DAG)/phorbol ester-regulated protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes have been widely linked to tumor promotion and the development of a metastatic phenotype. PKCε, an oncogenic member of the PKC family, is abnormally overexpressed in lung cancer and other cancer types. This kinase plays significant roles in proliferation, survival, and migration; however, its role in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been scarcely studied. Silencing experiments in non-small lung cancer (NSCLC) cells revealed that PKCε or other DAG-regulated PKCs (PKCα and PKCδ) were dispensable for the acquisition of a mesenchymal phenotype induced by transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β). Unexpectedly, we found a nearly complete down-regulation of PKCε expression in TGF-β-mesenchymally transformed NSCLC cells. PMA and AJH-836 (a DAG-mimetic that preferentially activates PKCε) promote ruffle formation in NSCLC cells via Rac1, however they fail to induce these morphological changes in TGF-β-mesenchymally transformed cells despite their elevated Rac1 activity. Several Rac guanine nucleotide exchange-factors (Rac-GEFs) were also up-regulated in TGF-β-treated NSCLC cells, including Trio and Tiam2, which were required for cell motility. Lastly, we found that silencing or inhibiting PKCε enhances RhoA activity and stress fiber formation, a phenotype also observed in TGF-β-transformed cells.

One of the possible interventions is health education because students are potential health advocates and influencers to their communities through the knowledge transfers from their teachers. The competency of Filipino teachers on ZIKV Disease is yet to be described. This study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of public secondary school teachers on ZIKV Disease. A modified version of the Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices Survey Tool on Zika Virus Disease from the World Health Organization—Pan American Health Organization (WHO-PAHO) was used to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of teachers of eight public secondary schools in five villages in Quezon City, Philippines. Out of the 609 respondents, 87.3% reported that their main source of information about ZIKV is tri-media, which includes television, print, and radio. Majority of the respondents mentioned that ZIKV is transmitted through a mosquito bite (80.3%). However, only half of the participants identified vector control as a preventive strategy. Moreover, only 54% admitted to have cleaned their water containers or water sources within the last week. Only a few identified mother-to-child (23%) and sexual intercourse (8%) as other means of transmission. Half (49.8%) of the respondents felt that it is possible to acquire ZIKV in their community, while 90% perceived that a private doctor (90%) or a public hospital (88%) can effectively treat the disease. Perceived stigma is high at 50%. This study showed there was good knowledge among teachers on vector transmission of ZIKV but poor knowledge on other aspects of the disease. Also, there was a low level of perceived susceptibility and severity of ZIKV which can be explained by the absence of a personal encounter with a Zika patient and the low number of cases in the Philippines. Half of the respondents said that they cleaned the possible mosquito breeding sites within the last week, followed by those who cleaned their water source more than a week ago (19%). None of the socio-demographic characteristics is significantly associated with respondents’ knowledge on Zika. Only income and location of residence were found to be significantly associated with attitudes towards Zika. These findings call for a comprehensive training program that includes development of teaching materials for public secondary school teachers on ZIKV Disease based from this study."
https://openalex.org/W2934172802,"The genus Cyphostemma (Planch.) Alston (Vitaceae) includes about 150 species distributed in eastern and southern Africa and Madagascar. Some species are used in traditional medicine and their biological activities, including antiproliferative effects against cancer cell lines, have been demonstrated. To date no investigations on Cyphostemma essential oils have been carried out. Essential oils, which play important roles in plant defenses have been demonstrated to be active in the treatment of several human diseases and to enhance bioavability of other drugs. The aim of this paper was to identify the chemical composition of the essential oil of the leaves of Cyphostemma juttae (Dinter & Gilg) Desc. and to verify some biological activities on two triple negative breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231, SUM 149), characterized by the over-expression of the transcription factor NF-κB. In the essential oil, obtained by hydrodistillation and analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, 39 compounds were detected and with phytol (30%) dominating the chemical composition. C. juttae essential oil reduced cell growth and showed a pro-oxidant activity in both cell lines. Moreover, C. juttae essential oil caused a substantial decrease of NF-κB activation and consequently a significant reduction of some NF-κB target genes. The present study shows for the first time the cytotoxic properties of C. juttae essential oil and highlight its availability to interfere with NF-κB pathway, suggesting a potential therapeutic use in triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs) of this essential oil."
https://openalex.org/W2934550109,"Hypersecretion of hepatic very LDL (VLDL)–associated triglyceride (TG) is the hallmark of hypertriglyceridemia. The estrogen-related receptor γ (ERRγ), an orphan nuclear receptor, plays crucial roles in the regulation of metabolic homeostasis, including TG formation in the liver. It remains unclear whether ERRγ regulates hepatic VLDL-TG secretion. We demonstrated that knockdown of ERRγ impairs hepatic VLDL-TG secretion in mice, whereas overexpression of ERRγ favors the secretion, indicating a novel role of ERRγ in hepatic TG metabolism. We found that ERRγ transcriptionally regulates the expression of PLA2G12B by binding to the promoter region of the Pla2g12b gene. In Pla2g12b-null mice, ERRγ fails to regulate hepatic VLDL-TG secretion. There is an apparent accumulation of large lipid droplets in the liver of Pla2g12b-null mice. These data suggest that ERRγ is a novel regulator of hepatic VLDL-TG secretion, which is mediated through the action on PLA2G12B.—Chen, L., Wu, M., Zhang, S., Tan, W., Guan, M., Feng, L., Chen, C., Tao, J., Chen, L., Qu, L.

Here, we purified the human SPCA1a/2 isoforms from a yeast recombinant expression system and compared their biochemical properties after reconstitution. We observed that the purified SPCA1a displays a lower Ca2+ affinity and slightly lower Mn2+ affinity than SPCA2. Remarkably, the turnover rates of SPCA1a in the presence of Mn2+ and SPCA2 incubated with Ca2+ and Mn2+ were comparable, whereas the turnover rate of SPCA1a in Ca2+ was 2-fold higher. Moreover, we noted an unusual biphasic activation curve for the SPCA1a ATPase and autophosphorylation activity, not observed with SPCA2. We also found that the biphasic pattern and low apparent ion affinity of SPCA1a critically depends on ATP concentration. We further show that the specific properties of SPCA1a at least partially depend on an N-terminal EF-hand–like motif, which is present only in the SPCA1a isoform and absent in SPCA2. This motif binds Ca2+, and its mutation lowered the Ca2+ turnover rate relative to that of Mn2+, increased substrate affinity, and reduced the level of biphasic activation of SPCA1a. A biochemical analysis indicated that Ca2+ binding to the N-terminal EF-hand–like motif promotes the activity of SPCA1a by facilitating autophosphorylation.

https://openalex.org/W2925949251,"There is a pressing need for improved preclinical model systems in which to study human skin wound healing. Here, we report the development and application of a serum-free full thickness human skin wound healing model. Not only can re-epithelialization (epidermal repair) and angiogenesis be studied in this simple and instructive model, but the model can also be used to identify clinically relevant wound-healing promoting agents, and to dissect underlying candidate mechanisms of action in the target tissue. We present preliminary ex vivo data to suggest that Thyroxine (T4), which reportedly promotes skin wound healing in rodents in vivo, may promote key features of human skin wound healing. Namely, T4 stimulates re-epithelialisation and angiogenesis, and modulates both wound healing-associated epidermal keratin expression and energy metabolism in experimentally wound human skin. Functionally, the wound healing-promoting effects of T4 are at least partially mediated via fibroblast growth factor/fibroblast growth factor receptor-mediated signalling, since they could be significantly antagonized by bFGF-neutralizing antibody. Thus, this pragmatic, easy-to-use full-thickness human skin wound healing model provides a useful preclinical research tool in the search for clinically relevant candidate wound healing-promoting agents. These ex vivo data encourage further pre-clinical testing of topical T4 as a cost-efficient, novel agent in the management of chronic human skin wounds."

Major spliceosome defects are implicated in male infertility; however, the underlying mechanistic links between the spliceosome and the ribosome in Drosophila testes remains largely unresolved. Small ribonucleoprotein particle protein SmD3 (SmD3) is a novel germline stem cell (GSC) regulatory gene identified in our previous screen of Drosophila testes. In the present study, using genetic manipulation in a Drosophila model, we demonstrated that SmD3 is required for the GSC niche and controls the self-renewal and differentiation of GSCs in the testis. Using in vitro assays in Schneider 2 cells, we showed that SmD3 also regulates the homeostasis of proliferation and apoptosis in Drosophila. Furthermore, using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry methods, SmD3 was identified as binding with ribosomal protein (Rp)L18, which is a key regulator of the large subunit in the ribosome. Moreover, SmD3 was observed to regulate spliceosome and ribosome subunit expression levels and controlled spliceosome and ribosome function via RpL18. Significantly, our findings revealed the genetic causes and molecular mechanisms underlying the stem cell niche and the crosstalk between the spliceosome and the ribosome.-Yu, J., Luan, X., Yan, Y., Qiao, C., Liu, Y., Zhao, D., Xie, B., Zheng, Q., Wang, M., Chen, W., Shen, C., He, Z., Hu, X., Huang, X., Li, H., Chen, B., Zheng, B., Chen, X., Fang, J.

https://openalex.org/W2932549607,"Research on patient engagement in health care shows that better health outcomes and lower healthcare costs are observed among highly engaged patients. Similar to other illnesses, high levels of patient engagement in HIV care are considered essential to maintaining optimal health, and patients who are on treatment and retained in HIV care are known to have better health outcomes. In this article, we draw on focus group discussion data with patients living with HIV in order to explain tacit expectations associated with engagement in care. The main objective of our research was to elicit an explanatory model of engagement in HIV care from the patients’ perspective. We conducted focus group discussions with a sample of two distinct types of patients: those who regularly attended medical appointments and those who did not. In total, we conducted six focus group discussions (n = 43) across in three cities in the US; these included two focus group discussions with a well-engaged and less-well-engaged group in each location. Both types of patients assigned a moral dimension to engagement in care, in that well-engaged patients were considered to be ‘good’ patients. Aspiring to become a ‘good’ patient provided a meaningful goal for some and deepened vulnerabilities among patients that struggled to achieve this status. More vulnerable patients may feel less secure in health care interactions and these feelings may be amplified if patients have an unreasonable impression of what constitutes a ‘good’ patient; thereby leading to disengagement in care. Our findings can inform the development of patient-centered, tailored messages to better serve patients struggling to stay engaged in HIV care."
https://openalex.org/W2934635783,"Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) establish the entire hematopoietic system and maintain lifelong hematopoiesis. Previous studies have reported the significance of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the regulation of self-renewal and differentiation of HSCs. In this study, we show that the expression of miRNA 34a (miR-34a) is markedly up-regulated in HSCs from mice subjected to ionizing radiation (IR). Reduced numbers and DNA damage repair, as well as increased apoptosis, are observed in HSCs from miR-34a-deficient mice induced by irradiation, although miR-34a is dispensable for steady-state hematopoiesis. Further investigations show that HSCs deficient in miR-34a exhibit decreased expressions of DNA repair-associated genes involved in homologous recombination and nonhomologous end joining. Competitive transplantation confirms that loss of miR-34a leads to more severe impairment of the long-term hematopoietic function of HSCs after irradiation exposure. Consistently, treating mice with an miR-34a agomir can significantly alleviate irradiation-induced DNA damage in HSCs. Our findings demonstrate that miR-34a contributes to promoting HSCs' survival after irradiation, which provides a promising approach for protecting HSCs from IR.-Zeng, H., Hu, M., Lu, Y., Zhang, Z., Xu, Y., Wang, S., Chen, M., Shen, M., Wang, C., Chen, F., Du, C., Tang, Y., Su,Y., Chen, S., Wang, J.

https://openalex.org/W2926024536,"Based on more recent science spending developments in countries such as China, Korea, India and Brazil, there is a growing sense that the world's scientific deck of cards is in the midst of a major reshuffle. But it is not clear if this reordering is limited to just the top spenders, or, indeed, how these changes have been playing out over the longer term. The new, more comprehensive research and development (R&D) spending estimates presented and discussed here reveal that we are in the midst of a possibly game-changing, albeit partial and perhaps irregular, reshuffle of the global R&D deck. These changes have potentially profound domestic and international economic development implications over the medium to long term. Notably, the fortunes of many of the world's poorer countries continue to look bleak. Using the evolving structure of past R&D spending to project forward, and absent marked changes in science policies and spending priorities, we foresee a continuing and substantial shift in the geography of R&D towards parts of Asia, along with a continuing large, and in many respects growing, gap between the world's scientific haves and have-nots."
https://openalex.org/W2927933260,"Reproductive strategies can act as strong selective forces on reproductive traits of male insects, resulting in species-specific variation in sperm quantity and viability. For solitary bees, basic measures of sperm quantity and viability are scarce. Here we evaluated for the first time quantity and viability of sperm in male Osmia cornuta solitary bees at different times after emergence, and how they were affected by male body mass and environmental condition (laboratory or semi-field arena). Sperm viability immediately after adult emergence showed no significant difference compared to four day old individuals, suggesting that O. cornuta males are capable of mating immediately post emergence. However, sperm counts were significantly higher in four day old individuals from the semi-field arena when compared to newly emerged males. This might reflect a final phase of sperm maturation. Regardless of individual male age and body mass differences, O. cornuta males produced on average ~175'000 spermatozoa that were ~65% viable, which are both significantly lower compared to eusocial honeybees and bumblebees. Moreover, sperm quantity, but not viability, was positively correlated with male body mass four days after emergence, while no such relationship was detected immediately after emergence. Even though individuals maintained in semi-field conditions exhibited a significantly greater loss of body mass, experimental arena had no significant effect on male survival, sperm quality or total living sperm produced. This suggests that the proposed laboratory design provides a cost-efficient and simple experimental approach to assess sperm traits in solitary bees. In conclusion, our data suggest a reduced investment in both sperm quantity and quality by male O. cornuta, which appears to be adaptive in light of the life history of this solitary bee."
https://openalex.org/W2926268620,"The connection between adipose glucocorticoid action and whole-body metabolism is incompletely understood. Thus, we generated adipose tissue-specific glucocorticoid receptor-knockout (Ad-GcR-/-) mice to explore potential mechanisms. Ad-GcR-/- mice had a lower concentration of fasting plasma nonesterified fatty acids and less hepatic steatosis. This was associated with increased protein kinase B phosphorylation and increased hepatic glycogen synthesis after an oral glucose challenge. High-fat diet (HFD)-fed Ad-GcR-/- mice were protected against the development of hepatic steatosis and diacylglycerol-PKCε-induced impairments in hepatic insulin signaling. Under hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic conditions, hepatic insulin response was ∼10-fold higher in HFD-fed Ad-GcR-/- mice. Insulin-mediated suppression of adipose lipolysis was improved by 40% in Ad-GcR-/- mice. Adipose triglyceride lipase expression was decreased and insulin-mediated perilipin dephosphorylation was increased in Ad-GcR-/- mice. In metabolic cages, food intake decreased by 3 kcal/kg per hour in Ad-GcR-/- mice. Therefore, physiologic adipose glucocorticoid action appears to drive hepatic lipid accumulation during stressors such as fasting. The resultant hepatic insulin resistance prevents hepatic glycogen synthesis, preserving glucose for glucose-dependent organs. Absence of adipose glucocorticoid action attenuates HFD-induced hepatic insulin resistance; potential explanations for reduction in hepatic steatosis include reductions in adipose lipolysis and food intake.-Abulizi, A., Camporez, J.-P., Jurczak, M.

In protomer oligomerization, the interaction between trimeric NC1 domains is a chloride-dependent event (16Cummings C.F. Pedchenko V. Brown K.L. Colon S. Rafi M. Jones-Paris C. Pokydeshava E. Liu M.

The first evidence for a role of chloride ions in scaffold assembly was revealed from the crystal structure of α121 NC1 hexamers, derived from a native collagen IV scaffold by collagenase digestion, which showed the presence of a group of six Cl− ions, three per NC1 trimer, embedded at the NC1 trimer–trimer interface (18Vanacore R.M.

Our recent studies showed that the high concentration of Cl− ions on the outside of cells signals protomer oligomerization and that Cl− ions bound to NC1 trimers trigger a conformational switch, which mediates protomer oligomerization (16Cummings C.F. Pedchenko V. Brown K.L. Colon S. Rafi M. Jones-Paris C. Pokydeshava E. Liu M. Pastor-Pareja J.C. Stothers C. Ero-Tolliver I.A. McCall A.S. Vanacore R. Bhave G.

Cell Biol. 2016; 213 (27216258): 479-49410.1083/jcb.201510065Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Importantly, our recent studies of the crystal structures of α121 NC1 hexamers revealed an additional group of six Cl− ions that are embedded at the trimer–trimer interface (19Casino P. Gozalbo-Rovira R. Rodríguez-Díaz J. Banerjee S. Boutaud A. Rubio V. Hudson B.G. Saus J. Cervera J. Marina A. Structures of collagen IV globular domains: insight into associated pathologies, folding and network assembly.IUCrJ. 2018; 5 (30443360): 765-77910.1107/S2052252518012459Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), indicating a role for these ions in hexamer assembly. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms, kinetics, and functionality of the 12 chloride ions in protomer oligomerization in the formation of α121 scaffolds. For these studies, we used novel single-chain technology to produce a stable recombinant α121 NC1 trimer. We discovered that the 12 ions form a chloride ring at the interface of NC1 trimers, which induces assembly and stabilizes the NC1 hexamer. Collectively, our findings reveal a fundamental role for chloride ions in the assembly of collagen IV scaffolds of BMs, a critical event that enabled tissue evolution and development in animals. In our previous study, we focused on the role of various ions in the assembly mechanism whereby NC1 monomers oligomerize forming NC1 hexamers. Chloride ions were found to induce hexamer assembly directly from monomers (16Cummings C.F. Pedchenko V. Brown K.L. Colon S. Rafi M. Jones-Paris C. Pokydeshava E. Liu M. Pastor-Pareja J.C. Stothers C. Ero-Tolliver I.A. McCall A.S. Vanacore R. Bhave G. Santoro S. et al.Extracellular chloride signals collagen IV network assembly during basement membrane formation.J. Cell Biol. 2016; 213 (27216258): 479-49410.1083/jcb.201510065Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, hexamer assembly involves two steps: monomers first oligomerize into trimers and, in turn, NC1 trimers oligomerize forming the NC1 hexamer. Initial findings suggest that chloride ions mediate the latter step, a critical step of scaffold assembly in tissues. Here, we sought to directly investigate the mechanisms, kinetics, and function of chloride ions in the oligomerization of NC1 trimers forming hexamers (Fig. 2). A trimeric state of NC1 domains is only stable when it is attached to a folded triple helical portion of the collagen IV molecule (Fig. 2, A and B). Although a significantly shortened segment of triple helix can stabilize trimers of NC1 at low chloride concentrations (16Cummings C.F. Pedchenko V. Brown K.L. Colon S. Rafi M. Jones-Paris C. Pokydeshava E. Liu M. Pastor-Pareja J.C. Stothers C. Ero-Tolliver I.A. McCall A.S. Vanacore R. Bhave G. Santoro S. et al.Extracellular chloride signals collagen IV network assembly during basement membrane formation.J. Cell Biol. 2016; 213 (27216258): 479-49410.1083/jcb.201510065Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), such trimers have limitations that precluded their use in studying the mechanism of NC1 trimer–to–hexamer assembly, a native process outside the cells. These limitations include a low yield in production, a susceptibility to proteolysis, and a loss of the trimeric structure at physiological temperature (16Cummings C.F. Pedchenko V. Brown K.L. Colon S. Rafi M. Jones-Paris C. Pokydeshava E. Liu M. Pastor-Pareja J.C. Stothers C. Ero-Tolliver I.A. McCall A.S. Vanacore R. Bhave G.

Cell Biol. 2016; 213 (27216258): 479-49410.1083/jcb.201510065Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To overcome these challenges, we developed a novel strategy to stabilize the NC1 trimer. Analysis of the crystal structures of the α121 NC1 hexamer revealed that the N and C termini of adjacent domains of the NC1 trimer are proximal to each other (20Sundaramoorthy M. Meiyappan M. Todd P. Hudson B.G. Crystal structure of NC1 domains. Structural basis for type IV collagen assembly in basement membranes.J. Biol.

Furthermore, the sub-domain architecture of an NC1 monomer represents the shortest possible linker, which potentially would prevent undesired linker flexibility, add to trimer stability, provide better resistance to proteolysis of linkers, and exclude the possibility of domain swapping. Single-chain approaches have been successfully applied to produce and solve the crystal structures of trimerization domains of collagen-like proteins adiponectin (22Min X. Lemon B. Tang J. Liu Q. Zhang R. Walker N. Li Y. Wang Z. Crystal structure of a single-chain trimer of human adiponectin globular domain.FEBS Lett. 2012; 586 (22449980): 912-91710.1016/j.febslet.2012.02.024Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and complement protein C1q (23Moreau C. Bally I. Chouquet A. Bottazzi B. Ghebrehiwet B. Gaboriaud C. Thielens N. Structural and functional characterization of a single-chain form of the recognition domain of complement protein C1q.Front. Immunol. 2016; 7 (26973654): 79Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The monomeric NC1 domain of α1 and α2 collagen IV chains consists of two C4 sub-domains (C41 and C42) connected by a short three-residue linker (Fig. 3, A and B). The linker sequence is conserved with Ala-Pro-Ala being a consensus for α-chains of collagen IV (Fig. S1A). The C4 atomic structures are superimposable (Fig. 3C), and positions of either N or C termini trimmed down to core sequences (with removed linkers and terminal extensions) coincide. Thus, native C41–C42 connections can be supplemented with similar artificial connections between C42 and C41 of adjacent domains to generate a single-chain α121 NC1 trimer (sc121 NC1 trimer) combining six C4 sub-domains (Fig. 3D). Exact trimming and linking sequences for α1–α2 and α2–α1 connections are provided in Fig. S2, B and C. The resulting polypeptide construct (Fig. S2) also contains an N-terminal FLAG-tag sequence for immunoprecipitation and a signal peptide for secretion. Such a complex polypeptide should have a pathway for successful oxidative folding and formation of 18 disulfides. The polypeptide backbone of C4 has a knot-free topology, which does not require sequential folding of C4 sub-domains. We hypothesized that each C4 sub-domain represents an independent folding unit where the three disulfides (Fig. 3D) significantly restrain its structure upon oxidation. Indeed, the protein was expressed and secreted in a soluble form with all cysteines oxidized into disulfides (see below). The sc121 NC1-trimer was collected from the cell culture medium containing a regular Cl− concentration and purified in the presence of 150 mm NaCl. After size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) on a column equilibrated with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, supplemented with 150 mm NaCl, the protein eluted as a single peak (Fig. 4A, indicated by blue line) with an apparent molecular mass of 113 kDa, according to a protein calibration kit. The major peak was pooled and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, which showed a single band that was sensitive to reduction (Fig. 4B), expected because the protein contains 18 potential disulfide bonds. The protein was concentrated to the same volume of sample that was initially applied to the column, and was re-run over the same column, but equilibrated with Cl−-free buffer, 25 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, supplemented with 150 mm sodium acetate. A clear shift was detected for the position of the major peak with an elution volume that corresponded to an apparent molecular mass of 60 kDa (Fig. 4A, indicated by red line). These results suggest that the sc121 NC1-trimer occurred in a hexamer configuration in the cell culture medium, but upon removal of chloride the hexamer dissociated into NC1 trimers. The apparent molecular masses are less than expected, as the calculated molecular mass of the single-chain NC1-trimer is 76.2 kDa and the corresponding hexamer is 152.4 kDa. This phenomenon is consistent with our previous data on chloride-dependent hexamer assembly using monomeric NC1 chains (16Cummings C.F. Pedchenko V. Brown K.L. Colon S. Rafi M. Jones-Paris C. Pokydeshava E. Liu M. Pastor-Pareja J.C. Stothers C. Ero-Tolliver I.A. McCall A.S. Vanacore R. Bhave G. Santoro S. et al.Extracellular chloride signals collagen IV network assembly during basement membrane formation.J. Cell Biol. 2016; 213 (27216258): 479-49410.1083/jcb.201510065Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Whereas elution profiles of high molecular mass complexes assembled from monomeric or single-chain trimeric NC1 domains are identical on a SEC column in the presence of chloride, the samples in Cl−-free buffer eluted at different positions, corresponding to the monomeric and trimeric states (Fig. 4, C and D, indicated by red lines). Upon the addition of chloride, sc121 NC1-trimers re-assembled into hexamers (Fig. 4C). This behavior is identical to that of NC1 monomers in the presence of chloride, as described previously (Fig. 4D) (16Cummings C.F. Pedchenko V. Brown K.L. Colon S. Rafi M. Jones-Paris C. Pokydeshava E. Liu M. Pastor-Pareja J.C. Stothers C. Ero-Tolliver I.A. McCall A.S. Vanacore R. Bhave G. Santoro S. et al.Extracellular chloride signals collagen IV network assembly during basement membrane formation.J. Cell Biol. 2016; 213 (27216258): 479-49410.1083/jcb.201510065Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Moreover, sc121 NC1-trimers have the capacity to co-assemble with tissue-derived α1 and α2 NC1 monomers, forming a complex that elutes in the position of NC1 hexamer. The monomers were incubated with the sc121 NC1-trimer in the presence of Cl−, and a composition of formed hexamers was analyzed after immunoprecipitation with the FLAG tag of the recombinant trimer (Fig. S3). Both bovine α1 and α2 NC1 monomers were incorporated into the heterotypic hexamer along with the sc121 NC1-trimer. Together, these results indicate that the sc121 NC1-trimer harbors the capacity to interact with chloride ions which induces (a) self-dimerization forming a hexamer and (b) oligomerization with NC1 monomers forming a heterotypic hexamer. The putative NC1 hexamer formed from sc121 NC1-trimers in the presence of chloride was collected from an SEC column, concentrated, and used for crystallization trials while maintaining the high chloride concentration. Ultimately, it was crystallized in space group P41212 with a single polypeptide chain per asymmetric unit (Table S1). The crystal structure was determined using X-ray diffraction. The overall atomic structure is identical to the previously reported structures for human and bovine NC1 domains isolated from tissues (Fig. S4). Least-square superimpositions revealed no significant variations between corresponding Cα atoms. Despite being of human origin, our structure fits bovine structures (1t60 and 1t61, RMSD 0.35–0.38 Å) slightly better than human (PDB code 1LI1, RMSD ∼0.49 Å). These minor discrepancies can be attributed to the different crystallization conditions and crystal packing. Structural identity for native and recombinant proteins demonstrates the validity of our strategy of sc121 NC1-trimer production. All C4–C4 linkers, native and artificial, are well-structured and are related by a pseudo-hexagonal symmetry (Fig. 5). All linker residues have a well-defined electron density map (Fig. S5). Although slightly higher for the artificial sequences, atomic displacement factors are comparable (Fig. S5F). Previously reported structures of NC1 domains derived from α121 scaffolds have one or several hexamers per asymmetric unit, where each hexamer contains two NC1 trimers related by a pseudo 2-fold rotation symmetry. Here, the hexamer is formed by two sc121 NC1-trimers related by a crystal 2-fold rotation symmetry (Fig. 6). These results show that in the presence of chloride the sc121 NC1-trimer assembles into a hexamer configuration. In the crystal structure of α121 NC1 hexamers, derived from a native collagen IV scaffold, two sets of ions were found at the interface between NC1 trimers and assigned to six Cl− and six K+ ions (18Vanacore R.M.

Re-analysis of structural data pointed to a possibility that sites originally assigned to K+ are rather occupied by an additional six Cl−. Very recently, the same conclusion was reached based on structural data of different NC1 hexamers assembled from recombinant polypeptides (19Casino P. Gozalbo-Rovira R. Rodríguez-Díaz J. Banerjee S.

The enzymatic activity of Cyp is inhibited by cyclosporin A (CsA), an immunosuppressive drug. To precisely determine the unfolding mechanism and the domain structure of Cyp, we have investigated a chimeric S. aureus Cyp (rCyp) using various probes. Our limited proteolysis and the consequent analysis of the proteolytic fragments indicate that rCyp is composed of one domain with a short flexible tail at the C-terminal end. We also show that the urea-induced unfolding of both rCyp and rCyp-CsA is completely reversible and proceeds via the synthesis of at least one stable intermediate. Both the secondary structure and the tertiary structure of each intermediate appears very similar to those of the corresponding native protein. Conversely, the hydrophobic surface areas of the intermediates are comparatively less. Further analyses reveal no loss of CsA binding activity in rCyp intermediate. The thermodynamic stability of rCyp was also significantly increased in the presence of CsA, recommending that this protein could be employed to screen new CsA derivatives in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2923676279,"Developmental milestones are commonly used in child health care, although from many milestones the predictive validity has not been adequately assessed. We aimed to determine the predictive validity of 75 developmental milestones for detecting limited intellectual functioning that can be obtained before the age of 4 years. We performed a case-control study with 148 children aged 5–10 years with limited intellectual functioning (IQ 50–69), who were in special education (cases) and a random sample of 300 children aged 5–10 years who were in regular elementary education (controls). Developmental milestones scores were retrieved from Child Healthcare files. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratios (LR+) and diagnostic odds ratios (DOR) for limited intellectual functioning. The LR+ determines whether a test result changes the probability that a condition exists. Given the prevalence of intellectual disability (1–3%), we considered that an LR+ > 10 would be clinically useful, as it increases the a priori probability of limited intellectual functioning from 2% to a posteriori probability of at least 17%. Out of 75 assessed milestones, 50 were included in the analysis. We found nine milestones to have a significant adjusted (for socio-economic status and prematurity) DOR > 1 and a significant LR+ > 10 (assessment age in months between brackets): ‘says ""dada-baba‴ (9), ‘balances head well while sitting’ (9), ‘sits on buttocks while legs stretched’ (9), ‘babbles while playing’ (12), ‘sits in stable position without support’ (12), ‘walks well alone’ (24), ‘says ""sentences"" of 3 or more words’ (36), ‘places 3 forms in form-box’ (36) and ‘copies circle’ (48). Sensitivities of these 9 milestones varied from 8–54%, specificities of these 9 milestones varied from 95–100%. Combining these milestones at 9, 12, and 36 months respectively resulted in sensitivities of 27–60% and specificities of 94–99%. These nine developmental milestones have substantial predictive validity for limited intellectual functioning."

Methods A retrospective study of consecutive emergency department (ED) patients with IVD during one year was conducted. ACI was based on the diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI), and SOL was based on the concurrent MRI sequences. A sensitivity analysis of CFT and D-dimer was also performed. Results Among the 468 patients enrolled, 13 patients (2.8%) had ACI, 11 at cerebellum, 1 at occipital lobe, and 1 at centrum semiovale. Twenty-five patients (5.3%) had SOL. Aneurysm is most frequent (n = 7), followed by meningioma (n = 4) and venous anomaly (n = 4). In total, ACI/SOL was found in 8.1% (n = 38). Abnormal findings in finger-to-nose (FN), heel-to-shin (HTS), and rapid alternative movement (RAM) tests were significantly higher in ACI or ACI/SOL group, while gait disturbance, tandem gait abnormality, and Romberg’s test were not. CFT sensitivities were low for ACI as well as for ACI/SOL, but specificities were high for ACI and ACI/SOL. D-dimer level showed a sensitivity of 100% at >0.18 mg/L for ACI and >0.15 mg/L for ACI/SOL. However, specificity was low at corresponding D-dimer level. Among the subgroup (n = 411) who did not show any abnormality in CFT, 9 patients (2.2%) had ACI, and 33 patients (8.0%) had ACI/SOL.

https://openalex.org/W2933489396,"Background China has a substantial tuberculosis (TB) disease burden and an aging population. Seniors have a higher risk of developing TB disease compared to younger age groups. Active case finding (ACF) could help identify seniors with TB disease. Methods From March to June 2017, we included ACF during annual physical check-ups for persons aged ≥ 65 years in Bayi, Sichuan Province. Seniors with clinical TB symptoms (i.e., cough lasting ≥ 2 weeks and/or hemoptysis) or one or more risk factors (e.g., previous TB disease, diabetes, and heavy alcohol consumption) were offered chest x-rays. We used acid-Fast Bacilli smear and solid culture laboratory testing for TB confirmation. We calculated the yield (i.e., cases identified among seniors screened) and cost per new each TB case detected. Focus group-interviews were conducted with health care workers and seniors to evaluate project acceptability. Participation rates and acceptability were used to assess feasibility. Results Of the 2,393 seniors residing in Bayi, 2,049 (85.6%) were enrolled in the pilot project. Of these seniors, 794 (38.7%) presented with at least one TB risk factor and 74 (3.6%) had symptoms consistent with active TB disease. Three seniors (0.2%)–each presenting with at least one risk factor—were diagnosed with active TB. The project yielded 146 TB cases per 100,000 seniors screened; the cost per case detected was $4,897. Most workers supported ACF if additional resources and staff could be provided. Seniors appreciated the convenience of this integrated health service approach. Conclusions Although the yield was lower than expected, ACF appeared feasible in Bayi. Targeting seniors with at least one known TB risk factor could help detect previously unidentified TB cases. However, similar projects in communities with a higher TB prevalence are needed to further evaluate the yield and required resources prior to implementation on a larger scale. Findings from our pilot project should be combined with data from these future ACF projects to improve TB screening criteria."

Creative props are encouraged, and some fellow students and I had held up signs that read “Sustainability requires social justice” and “Dismantle white supremacy in the environmental movement.” These issues were part of why I was pursuing these studies; highlighting them was important to me. But so was graduating in a few weeks, which would be in jeopardy if this professor didn't give me a passing grade on my thesis.

To make matters worse, he had sent the email to my other committee members, my advisers, an assistant dean, and nearly a dozen of my classmates. I was terrified.

I had never viewed my advocacy as separate from or incompatible with my research. They both stemmed from the same drive to make the world more equitable. Through my work with youth delegations to United Nations climate negotiations and a decade of community organizing, I had witnessed the impact of climate change on marginalized and vulnerable communities. These experiences shaped my research. As an undergraduate, I was inspired by graduate students who combined rigorous climate research with advocacy. Following their example, I did ecological research while leading a fossil fuel divestment campaign on campus. And I was lucky that my advisers supported me in being my most authentic self, regardless of whether we shared the same world views.

But upon reading the professor's email, I realized that many academic institutions are not designed to accommodate the social engagement that makes me and many other young researchers passionate about science. For the most part, our success is measured by our research output. Any political engagement is, at best, tolerated. At worst, it can be seen as compromising the integrity of our research. As a productive researcher, I was the ideal graduate student. As an advocate, I was the worst graduate student. Many administrators and faculty members didn't know what to do with a student who was both.

As news of the email spread, other faculty members, classmates, and alumni offered advice and support. The experience brought home just how important it is to find an academic community that nurtures every part of my identity—climate organizer, first-generation college student, and a woman in science. (A male classmate pointed out that, even though he had participated in the same demonstration, he had not been called out.)

I eventually resolved the issue with my thesis committee member, graduated, and moved on to my Ph.D. program. (I had accepted the offer just a few days before receiving the email.) I am now at an institution where public engagement is encouraged. I have conversations with other graduate students about the kind of equitable world we would like to build through our research. Students in my program write opinion pieces in newspapers and online, informed by our research findings. I speak with faculty members about climate research that is “hopeful”—that both gets at the root of environmental problems and paves the way for solutions. I take part in an informal campus discussion group about science and social justice. My colleagues and I don't always agree, but we support one another's right to respectfully share our views.

I recognize that, as I continue working at this nexus of research and policy, I may get pushback from the academic community for my public engagement. But caring about justice doesn't undermine my ability to conduct rigorous research or cloud my conclusions. For me, fighting climate change means persevering with both my research and my community organizing. I am grateful for the communities of young scientists who, rather than tiptoe around the edges of wicked problems, step right into the fire.

Even on a confocal microscope this can usually only be achieved by using an external laser power meter. By combining low-cost wireless Arduino based light sensors with an easy to use Android smartphone app we provide microscope users with a simple but powerful tool to maintain sample illumination for quantitative imaging, for tracking the intensity, stability and alignment of the light sources and for comparing microscope performance."

Allopregnanolone and its synthetic analog alphaxalone are GABAAR-positive allosteric modulators (PAMs), whereas alphaxalone and most neuroactive steroids are nAChR inhibitors. In this report, we used 11β-(p-azidotetrafluorobenzoyloxy)allopregnanolone (F4N3Bzoxy-AP), a general anesthetic and photoreactive allopregnanolone analog that is a potent GABAAR PAM, to characterize steroid-binding sites in the Torpedo α2βγδ nAChR in its native membrane environment. We found that F4N3Bzoxy-AP (IC50 = 31 μm) is 7-fold more potent than alphaxalone in inhibiting binding of the channel blocker [3H]tenocyclidine to nAChRs in the desensitized state. At 300 μm, neither steroid inhibited binding of [3H]tetracaine, a closed-state selective channel blocker, or of [3H]acetylcholine. Photolabeling identified three distinct [3H]F4N3Bzoxy-AP–binding sites in the nAChR transmembrane domain: 1) in the ion channel, identified by photolabeling in the M2 helices of βVal-261 and δVal-269 (position M2–13′); 2) at the interface between the αM1 and αM4 helices, identified by photolabeling in αM1 (αCys-222/αLeu-223); and 3) at the lipid–protein interface involving γTrp-453 (M4), a residue photolabeled by small lipophilic probes and promegestone, a steroid nAChR antagonist. Photolabeling in the ion channel and αM1 was higher in the nAChR-desensitized state than in the resting state and inhibitable by promegestone. These results directly indicate a steroid-binding site in the nAChR ion channel and identify additional steroid-binding sites also occupied by other lipophilic nAChR antagonists.

https://openalex.org/W2928058566,"Computational modeling of engineered gene circuits is an important while challenged task in systems biology. In order to describe and predict the response behaviors of genetic circuits using reliable model parameters, this paper applies an optimal experimental design(OED) method to obtain input signals. In order to obtain informative observations, this study focuses on maximizing Fisher information matrix(FIM)-based optimal criteria and to provide optimal inputs. Furthermore, this paper designs a two-stage optimization with the modified E-optimal criteria and applies harmony search(HS)-based OED algorithm to minimize estimation errors. The proposed optimal identification methodology involves estimation errors and the sample size to pursue a trade-off between estimation accuracy and measurement cost in modeling gene networks. The designed cost function takes two major factors into account, in which experimental costs are proportional to the number of time points. Experiments select two types of synthetic genetic networks to validate the effectiveness of the proposed HS-OED approach. Identification outcomes and analysis indicate the proposed HS-OED method outperforms two candidate OED approaches, with reduced computational effort."
