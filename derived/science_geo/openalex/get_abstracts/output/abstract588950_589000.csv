https://openalex.org/W2626059976,"More than a hundred hydropower dams have already been built in the Amazon basin and numerous proposals for further dam constructions are under consideration. The accumulated negative environmental effects of existing dams and proposed dams, if constructed, will trigger massive hydrophysical and biotic disturbances that will affect the Amazon basin’s floodplains, estuary and sediment plume. We introduce a Dam Environmental Vulnerability Index to quantify the current and potential impacts of dams in the basin. The scale of foreseeable environmental degradation indicates the need for collective action among nations and states to avoid cumulative, far-reaching impacts. We suggest institutional innovations to assess and avoid the likely impoverishment of Amazon rivers. The current and expected environmental consequences of built dams and proposed dam constructions in the Amazon basin are explored with the help of a Dam Environmental Vulnerability Index. There are already more than 100 hydropower dams in place across the Amazon basin. They are not just a source of energy, but also of on-going contention between developers, government officials, locals and environmentalists. This Perspective explores the current and expected environmental consequences of existing and proposed dams in the Amazon basin, with the help of a Dam Environmental Vulnerability Index (DEVI). The authors quantitatively assess the vulnerability of different regions of the basin, and propose that an integrative legal framework is required to guide all nine stakeholder countries towards minimizing the negative socio-economic and environmental impacts of present and future dams."

https://openalex.org/W2625702801,"According to the EU Directive 2010/63, the severity of a procedure has to be classified as mild, moderate or severe. General anesthesia is thought to be mild, but the Directive does not differentiate between single and repeated anesthesia. Therefore, we investigated the impact of repeated administration of isoflurane, the most commonly used inhalation anesthetic, on the well-being of adult C57BL/6JRj mice, in comparison to single administrations and to untreated animals, when applied six times for 45 min at an interval of 3-4 days. For the animals anesthetized, excitations, phases of anesthesia, and vital parameters were monitored. Well-being after anesthesia was assessed using a behavioral test battery including luxury behavior like burrowing and nest building behavior, the Mouse Grimace Scale (MGS), the free exploratory paradigm for anxiety-related behavior, home cage activity and the rotarod test for activity, as well as food intake and body weight. Additionally, hair corticosterone and fecal corticosterone metabolites were measured. Our results show that nest building behavior, home cage activity, body weight, and corticosterone concentrations were not influenced by anesthesia, whereas changes in burrowing behavior, the MGS, food intake, and the free exploratory behavior indicated that the well-being of the mice was more affected by repeated than single isoflurane anesthesia. This effect depended on the sex of the animals, with female mice being more susceptible than male mice. However, repeated isoflurane anesthesia caused only short-term mild distress and impairment of well-being, mainly in the immediate postanesthetic period. Well-being stabilized at 8 days after the last anesthesia, at the latest. Therefore, we conclude that when using our anesthesia protocol, the severity of both single and repeated isoflurane anesthesia in C57BL/6JRj mice can be classified as mild. However, within the mild severity category, repeated isoflurane anesthesia ranks higher than single isoflurane anesthesia. Additionally, our results imply that male and female mice can differently perceive the severity of a procedure."

Failure during these different processes can lead to difficulties in conception. Alternatives to overcome these problems are based on assisted reproductive techniques. Extracellular vesicles are cell-secreted vesicles present in different body fluids and contain bioactive materials, such as messenger RNA, microRNAs (miRNAs), and proteins. Thus, our hypothesis is that extracellular vesicles from follicular fluid from 3–6 mm ovarian follicles can modulate bovine embryo development in vitro. To test our hypothesis follicular fluid from bovine ovaries was aspirated and small-extracellular vesicles (<200 nm) were isolated for further analysis. Additionally, small-extracellular vesicles (EVs) were utilized for functional experiments investigating their role in modulating messenger RNA, microRNA as well as global DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation levels of bovine blastocysts. EVs from 3–6 mm follicles were used for RNA-seq and miRNA analysis. Functional annotation analysis of the EVs transcripts revealed messages related to chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. EVs treatment during oocyte maturation and embryo development causes changes in blastocyst rates, as well as changes in the transcription levels of genes related to embryonic metabolism and development. Supplementation with EVs from 3–6 mm follicles during oocyte maturation and early embryo development (until the 4-cell stage) increased the levels of bta-miR-631 (enriched in EVs from 3–6 mm follicles) in embryos. Interestingly, the addition of EVs from 3–6 mm follicles induced changes in global DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation levels compared to embryos produced by the standard in vitro production system. Our results indicate that the supplementation of culture media with EVs isolated from the follicular fluid of 3–6 mm follicles during oocyte maturation and early embryo development can partially modify metabolic and developmental related genes as well as miRNA and global DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation, suggesting that EVs play an important role during oocyte maturation and early embryo development in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2626049069,"Endothelial cells represent major effectors in inflammation and angiogenesis, processes that drive a multitude of pathological states such as atherosclerosis and cancer. Both inflammation and angiogenesis are interconnected with each other in the sense that many pro-inflammatory proteins possess proangiogenic properties and vice versa. To elucidate this interplay further, we present a comparative proteome study of inflammatory and angiogenic activated endothelial cells. HUVEC were stimulated with interleukin 1-β and VEGF, respectively. Cultured primary cells were fractionated into secreted, cytoplasmic and nuclear protein fractions and processed for subsequent LC-MS/MS analysis. Obtained protein profiles were filtered for fraction-specific proteins to address potential cross fractional contamination, subjected to comparative computational biology analysis (GO-Term enrichment analysis, weighted gene co-expression analysis) and compared to published mRNA profiles of IL-1β respectively VEGF stimulated HUVEC. GO Term enrichment analysis and comparative pathway analysis revealed features such as NOD and NfkB signaling for inflammatory activated HUVEC and VEGF and ErB signaling for VEGF-activated HUVEC with potential crosstalk via map kinases MAP2K2. Weighted protein co-expression network analysis revealed several potential hub genes so far not associated with driver function in inflammation or angiogenesis such as HSPG2, ANXA3, and GPI. “Classical” inflammation or angiogenesis markers such as IL6, CXCL8 or CST1 were found in a less central position within the co-expression networks. In conclusion, this study reports a framework for the computational biology based analysis of proteomics data applied to cytoplasmic, nucleic and extracellular fractions of quiescent, inflammatory and angiogenic activated HUVEC. Novel potential hub genes relevant for these processes were successfully identified."
https://openalex.org/W2736197611,"Activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) is a critical step in the development of liver fibrosis. During activation, HSCs lose their lipid droplets (LDs) containing triacylglycerols (TAGs), cholesteryl esters, and retinyl esters (REs). We previously provided evidence for the presence of two distinct LD pools, a preexisting and a dynamic LD pool. Here we investigate the mechanisms of neutral lipid metabolism in the preexisting LD pool. To investigate the involvement of lysosomal degradation of neutral lipids, we studied the effect of lalistat, a specific lysosomal acid lipase (LAL/Lipa) inhibitor on LD degradation in HSCs during activation in vitro. The LAL inhibitor increased the levels of TAG, cholesteryl ester, and RE in both rat and mouse HSCs. Lalistat was less potent in inhibiting the degradation of newly synthesized TAG species as compared with a more general lipase inhibitor orlistat. Lalistat also induced the presence of RE-containing LDs in an acidic compartment. However, targeted deletion of the Lipa gene in mice decreased the liver levels of RE, most likely as the result of a gradual disappearance of HSCs in livers of Lipa−/− mice. Lalistat partially inhibited the induction of activation marker α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) in rat and mouse HSCs. Our data suggest that LAL/Lipa is involved in the degradation of a specific preexisting pool of LDs and that inhibition of this pathway attenuates HSC activation.

Hepatic stellate cells: protean, multifunctional, and enigmatic cells of the liver.Physiol. Rev. 2008; 88: 125-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (2066) Google Scholar). HSCs are located in the spaces of Disse, between sinusoidal endothelial cells and hepatocytes. In a healthy liver, HSCs contain large lipid droplets filled with REs, triacylglycerols (TAGs), and cholesteryl esters (CEs). After liver injury, quiescent HSCs can transdifferentiate into activated cells with a myofibroblastic phenotype (1Blaner W.S. O'Byrne S.M. Wongsiriroj N. Kluwe J. D'Ambrosio D.M. Jiang H. Schwabe R.F. Hillman E.M. Piantedosi R. Libien J. Hepatic stellate cell lipid droplets: a specialized lipid droplet for retinoid storage.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1791: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Activated macrophages in concert with HSCs may initiate this transition by secreting cytokines such as transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), which stimulate the synthesis of matrix proteins and the release of retinoids by HSCs (1Blaner W.S. O'Byrne S.M. Wongsiriroj N. Kluwe J. D'Ambrosio D.M. Jiang H. Schwabe R.F. Hillman E.M. Piantedosi R. Libien J.

We previously reported that LD degradation in activated rat HSCs occurs in two phases (4Testerink N. Ajat M. Houweling M. Brouwers J.F. Pully V.V. van Manen H.J. Otto C. Helms J.B. Vaandrager A.B. Replacement of retinyl esters by polyunsaturated triacylglycerol species in lipid droplets of hepatic stellate cells during activation.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e34945Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Upon activation of HSCs, the LDs reduce in size but increase in number during the first 7 days in culture. In the second phase the lipid droplets disappear. Raman and lipidomic studies showed that in the initial phase of HSC activation, the REs disappear rapidly, whereas the TAG content transiently increases (4Testerink N. Ajat M. Houweling M. Brouwers J.F. Pully V.V. van Manen H.J. Otto C. Helms J.B. Vaandrager A.B. Replacement of retinyl esters by polyunsaturated triacylglycerol species in lipid droplets of hepatic stellate cells during activation.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e34945Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This increase in TAGs in rat HSCs is predominantly caused by a large and specific increase in polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-containing triacylglycerol species during the first 7 days in culture, mediated by the increase in the ratio of the PUFA-specific fatty acid CoA synthase 4 (ACSL4) to the nonspecific ASCLs, especially ASCL1 (5Tuohetahuntila M.

The observed increase in the number of LDs during the first phase of HSC activation can in principle be accomplished by the de novo synthesis of the new LDs (6Wilfling F. Haas J.T. Walther T.C. Farese Jr., R.V. Lipid droplet biogenesis.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2014; 29: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) or fission of existing large LDs (7Long A.P. Manneschmidt A.K.

We previously suggested that HSCs contain two pools of LDs, a preexisting and a dynamic pool of LDs. The preexisting LD pool is characterized by a larger average size of the LD diameter, the presence of REs, and the involvement of its synthesizing enzyme LRAT (8Ajat M. Molenaar M. Brouwers J.F.

Lipid Res. 2016; 57: 1162-1174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The dynamic LDs were shown to be smaller than preexisting LDs and have a dynamic lipid metabolism, with new TAG synthesis and hydrolysis at relatively high rates (9Tuohetahuntila M. Molenaar M.R.

Lipid Res. 2016; 57: 1162-1174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that the observed increase in number of LDs during the first phase of HSC activation is likely the result of a decrease of the preexisting pool of LDs and concomitant presence of a highly dynamic pool of lipid droplets. In the dynamic LD pool, DGAT1 and ATGL (also known as PNPLA2) are involved in the synthesis and breakdown of newly synthesized TAGs, respectively (9Tuohetahuntila M. Molenaar M.R. Spee B.

The degradation pathway of the dynamic LD pool resembles the well known mechanism of LD breakdown in adipose cells. In these cells key roles were assigned to ATGL, its co-activator CGI-58, and hormone-sensitive lipase (10Zechner R. Kienesberger P.C. Haemmerle G. Zimmermann R. Lass A. Adipose triglyceride lipase and the lipolytic catabolism of cellular fat stores.J. Lipid Res. 2009; 50: 3-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). The first two proteins are known to have a more general function as deficiencies in either one leads to neutral lipid storage diseases (11Schweiger M. Lass A. Zimmermann R. Eichmann T.O. Zechner R.

Expression of carboxylesterase and lipase genes in rat liver cell types.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 374: 460-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In mouse and rat HSCs, ATGL was found to be involved specifically in breakdown of newly synthesized TAGs but not in degrading TAGs in the preexisting LD pool. This suggests the existence of another lipolysis pathway (9Tuohetahuntila M. Molenaar M.R. Spee B. Brouwers J.F. Houweling M. Vaandrager A.B. Helms J.B.

Lipid Res. 2016; 57: 1162-1174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In mouse HSCs, lipid breakdown was shown to be partially mediated by a lipophagic pathway, as inhibition of autophagy increased the amount of LDs (13Thoen L.F. Guimarães E.L. Dollé L. Mannaerts I.

Autophagy regulates turnover of lipid droplets via ROS-dependent Rab25 activation in hepatic stellate cell.Redox Biol. 2017; 11: 322-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Because inhibition of autophagy was shown to impair HSC activation in mice and this effect could be partially reversed by the addition of exogenous FAs, it was suggested that LD breakdown is required to fulfill the energy demands of HSCs during activation (14Hernández-Gea V.

The lipase active in lipophagy is thought to be lysosomal acid lipase (LAL), which is encoded by the Lipa gene (16Ouimet M. Franklin V. Mak E. Liao X. Tabas I. Marcel Y.L. Autophagy regulates cholesterol efflux from macrophage foam cells via lysosomal acid lipase.Cell. Metab. 2011; 13: 655-667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar) and which is also responsible for the degradation of lipoprotein derived CEs and TAGs taken up by endocytosis (17Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. A receptor-mediated pathway for cholesterol homeostasis.Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4350) Google Scholar). Targeted deletion of Lipa in mice leads to severe CE and TAG accumulation in hepatocytes (18Du H. Duanmu M. Witte D. Grabowski G.A.

Genet. 1998; 7: 1347-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and LAL deficiency in humans results in either Wolman disease or its milder variant, cholesteryl ester storage disease (CESD), depending on the mutation in the Lipa gene (19Anderson R.A.

In this study we addressed the question of whether inhibition of LAL affects lipid metabolism in HSCs and the activation process in rat and mouse HSCs. We, therefore, studied the effect of the LAL-specific inhibitor lalistat (20Rosenbaum A.I. Rujoi M. Huang A.Y. Du H. Grabowski G.A. Maxfield F.R.

Acta. 2012; 413: 1207-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) on HSC lipid metabolism and activation, and we made use of a knock-out strain of mice deficient in LAL. The contribution of LAL/Lipa to neutral lipid breakdown was studied by incubating rat HSCs with the LAL-specific inhibitor lalistat (100 μm) during the early activating phase (days 1–7). As shown in Fig. 1A, lalistat caused a 3–4-fold increase in the levels of all neutral lipids including TAGs, CEs, and REs. Lalistat (100 μm) proved to be non-toxic to the HSCs, as the 6-day incubation had no effect on cell viability (98 ± 13% of control viable cells). The increase in TAGs and CEs could be (partially) the result of uptake of exogenous lipids, e.g. as lipoproteins, from the medium that are also degraded by LAL. To determine whether the observed increase in neutral lipids during HSC activation by lalistat resulted from inhibition of breakdown of extracellular or intracellular neutral lipids, we limited the contribution of exogenous lipids during the inhibitor treatment by culturing the cells in medium with delipidated serum. Under these conditions the levels of TAG species containing PUFAs and the levels of CEs were much lower (Fig. 1B), in line with the notion that PUFA-TAGs are synthesized from exogenous PUFAs (5Tuohetahuntila M. Spee B. Kruitwagen H.S. Wubbolts R. Brouwers J.F. van de Lest C.H. Molenaar M.R. Houweling M. Helms J.B. Vaandrager A.B. Role of long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 4 in formation of polyunsaturated lipid species in hepatic stellate cells.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2015; 1851: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and that CEs are derived from lipoproteins from the medium. The levels of non-PUFA TAGs were less affected by growing the HSCs in delipidated medium. Nevertheless, the levels of these non-PUFA TAGs and REs were increased by lalistat to similar levels when compared with cells grown in normal medium (cf. Fig. 1, A and B). During the incubation with delipidated medium, TAGs might still be (re)synthesized from endogenous FAs, derived from TAG and phospholipid breakdown. We, therefore, also studied the effect of lalistat in delipidated medium and in the presence of T863, a DGAT1 inhibitor that was shown to inhibit TAG synthesis in rat HSCs for >80% (9Tuohetahuntila M. Molenaar M.R. Spee B. Brouwers J.F. Houweling M. Vaandrager A.B. Helms J.B. ATGL and DGAT1 are involved in the turnover of newly synthesized triacylglycerols in hepatic stellate cells.J. Lipid Res. 2016; 57: 1162-1174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). When re-synthesis is inhibited, the amount of non-PUFA TAGs is almost halved during the 3-day incubation, similar to the ∼60% decrease in RE levels (Fig. 1C). Lalistat completely prevented the degradation of these lipids, clearly indicating that this LAL inhibitor prevented the breakdown of preexisting lipids. To determine the specificity of lalistat, we tested the pyrazole-methanone compounds E4, F2, and H4, which have been described to inhibit LAL (23VanderVen B.C. Hermetter A. Huang A. Maxfield F.R.

Development of a novel, cell-based chemical screen to identify inhibitors of intraphagosomal lipolysis in macrophages.Cytometry A. 2010; 77: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1D, the potency of the compounds to increase the level of CEs, a clear hallmark of LAL-inhibition (18Du H. Duanmu M. Witte D. Grabowski G.A. Targeted disruption of the mouse lysosomal acid lipase gene: long-term survival with massive cholesteryl ester and triglyceride storage.Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1347-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), was correlated to their capacity to increase the levels of TAGs and REs. The lalistat-induced accumulation of non-PUFA TAGs and REs is opposite from our previous observation that HSCs from ATGL-deficient mice accumulated PUFA-TAGs but not non-PUFA TAGs and REs (9Tuohetahuntila M.

Lipid Res. 2016; 57: 1162-1174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). As ATGL is involved in the turnover of lipids in the dynamic LD pool (9Tuohetahuntila M.

Lipid Res. 2016; 57: 1162-1174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), our combined results indicate that Lalistat does not affect the dynamic LD pool but, rather, the preexisting LD pool. The dynamic LD pool can be readily labeled by the addition of deuterated fatty acids to the medium resulting in rapid incorporation of the stable isotope in this pool of lipids (9Tuohetahuntila M.

To investigate directly whether the LAL inhibitor could inhibit the dynamic TAG pool, we labeled freshly isolated rat HSCs for 2 days with 25 μm D4-palmitate in medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum followed by a 2-day chase without stable isotope-labeled palmitate but in the presence of lalistat or orlistat, a general lipase inhibitor formerly known as tetrahydrolipstatin (20Rosenbaum A.I.

As shown in Fig. 2A, a large percentage of TAGs can be labeled with D4-palmitate. In the absence of inhibitors, the doubly labeled TAG species are almost completely degraded during the 2-day chase (Fig. 2, A and B). The general lipase inhibitor orlistat could inhibit the degradation of the newly made TAGs almost completely. However, lalistat did not significantly affect the degradation of the labeled TAGs. Both lalistat and orlistat increased the amount of unlabeled TAGs during the chase to a similar level (Fig. 2). This suggests that lalistat preferentially inhibits the degradation of a pool of unlabeled TAGs, whereas orlistat affects the breakdown of both a pool of labeled (i.e. newly synthesized) and unlabeled (preexisting) TAGs. The observed lalistat-induced increase of a specific pool of neutral lipids might lead to changes in LD size and/or number. Examination of lipid droplet morphology in HSCs by fluorescence microscopy showed that lalistat induces an increase in the number, but not in the size of the of LDs, whereas orlistat increased both parameters, resulting in a specific increase in big LDs (>2 μm) (Fig. 3). These data are in agreement with the fact that these drugs affect different lipid breakdown pathways. To verify that lalistat inhibits lipid breakdown in the lysosomal compartment, we imaged LDs in HSCs after staining the acidic compartments with Lysotracker red (Fig. 4). In control cells we observed that ∼20% of the Lysotracker positive structures were close to RE-containing LDs, but colocalization was not observed. Only in the HSCs incubated with lalistat did we detect a consistent colocalization of these structures, indicating that the lipids accumulated inside lysosomes (Fig. 4 and supplemental Fig. S1). After incubation with lalistat we also noticed HSCs that clearly contained two populations of LDs, one that contained retinoids (UV autofluorescent), and one that did not (Fig. 4A and supplemental Fig. S1). Typically, the latter population was localized at the periphery of the cell, whereas the former was present around the nucleus together with the Lysotracker red-positive structures.Figure 4Lalistat increased colocalization of LD and the lysosomal compartment in rat HSCs. A, confocal images of HSCs isolated from rats incubated from day 1 to day 4 in medium with 10% FBS in the presence of vehicle (control) or 100 μm lalistat.

In the boxes higher magnification of the separate channels and the merge are shown. The white bar is 10 μm. B, UV-positive LDs were counted and classified manually.

Previously, an acidic REH has been described that was different from LAL/Lipa as judged from its insensitivity to bivalent metal ions like Ca2+ and Mg2+ (25Mercier M. Forget A. Grolier P.

Vitamin A contained in the lipid droplets of rat liver stellate cells is substrate for acid retinyl ester hydrolase.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1259: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We also found that the main REH in a homogenate of rat HSCs and rat hepatocytes has an optimum at pH 4 (Fig. 5, A and B). However, we could not observe a difference in inhibition by bivalent cations between the REH in comparison to the CE hydrolase activity, assayed simultaneously (Fig. 5B). We also found that both activities were inhibited by lalistat (Fig. 5B), with a similar IC50 ∼1–3 μm. Furthermore, the acidic REH activity was absent in liver homogenates from Lipa−/− mice and could be induced in CHO homogenates by transfecting the CHO cells with recombinant rat Lipa (Fig. 5, C and D). These latter experiments clearly show that Lipa has REH activity in vitro. To investigate the effect of Lipa on RE metabolism in HSCs, we attempted to isolate HSCs from Lipa−/− mice. However, isolation of Lipa−/− HSCs was not possible, most likely due to the massive accumulation of lipids in the Lipa−/− livers (18Du H. Duanmu M. Witte D. Grabowski G.A. Targeted disruption of the mouse lysosomal acid lipase gene: long-term survival with massive cholesteryl ester and triglyceride storage.Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1347-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Therefore, we analyzed the RE content in livers of Lipa-deficient and corresponding WT mice. Surprisingly, we found that despite the 100-fold higher levels of CEs (Fig. 6A), the levels of the REs were similar (retinyl stearate) or lower (retinyl palmitate and retinyl oleate) in the livers of 7-week-old Lipa−/− mice (Fig. 6B). In older mice (4–5 months; average 20 weeks), the difference between the WT and the Lipa-deficient mice became even larger, as the WT mice continued to accumulate REs, and the Lipa−/− mice lost most of their REs (Fig. 6B). The low levels of REs in the livers of the 4–5-month-old Lipa−/− mice were accompanied by a decrease in the expression of LRAT mRNA, considered a marker for quiescent HSCs (27Kluwe J. Wongsiriroj N. Troeger J.S. Gwak G.Y. Dapito D.H. Pradere J.P. Jiang H. Siddiqi M. Piantedosi R. O'Byrne S.M. Blaner W.S. Schwabe R.F. Absence of hepatic stellate cell retinoid lipid droplets does not enhance hepatic fibrosis but decreases hepatic carcinogenesis.Gut. 2011; 60: 1260-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), but not by an up-regulation of the HSC activation marker α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA; Fig. 6, C and D). This suggests that the livers of the Lipa−/− mice gradually lose their HSCs. To exclude that the apparent discrepancy between the lack of effect of Lipa knock out in mice in vivo on RE storage and the observed effect of the Lipa-inhibitor lalistat on RE levels in rat HSCs in vitro is caused by species differences between rat and mouse, we compared the effect of lalistat on neutral lipid levels in primary mouse HSCs with its effect on rat HSCs (cf. Figure 7, Figure 1A). The levels of REs in primary isolated mouse HSCs at day 1 (5.5 ± 3 nmol of RE/mg of protein) were found to be similar to that in rat HSCs (6 ± 4 nmol of RE/mg of protein). We found that lalistat also caused an increase in TAGs, CEs, and REs in mouse HSCs. In comparison to rat HSCs, the lalistat-induced increase in RE level in mouse was somewhat lower (2.5-fold versus almost 4-fold in rat HSCs). Determination of Lipa mRNA expression in quiescent (day 1) and activated (day 7) rat HSCs shows that Lipa mRNA is up-regulated during activation in vitro (Fig. 8A).

It has been assumed that oxidative stress contributes to the ß-amyloid deposition in cerebral blood vessels. Methods In order to prove this hypothesis, we examined the effect of oxidative stress on the processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) in primary endothelial cells (EC) derived from cerebral cortical tissue of transgenic Tg2576 mice. Following exposure of EC by 1 μM hydrogen peroxide for up to 48 hours, formation and secretion of APP cleavage products sAPPα and sAPPß into the culture medium as well as the expression of endothelial APP were assessed. Results Oxidative stress resulted in enhanced secretion of sAPPß into the culture medium as compared to controls (absence of hydrogen peroxide), which was accompanied by an increased APP expression, induction of VEGF synthesis, nitric oxide and oxygen free radicals productions, and differential changes of endothelial phospo-p42/44 MAPK expression. Conclusion The data suggest that oxidative stress may represent a major risk factor in causing Aß deposition in the brain vascular system by initiating the amyloidogenic route of endothelial APP processing. The enhanced β-secretase activity following oxidative stress exposure, possibly promoted by phosphorylation of p42/44 MAPK."
https://openalex.org/W2624969058,"Human giardiosis and cryptosporidiosis are caused by the enteric protozoan parasites Giardia duodenalis and Cryptosporidium spp. Both pathogens are major contributors to the global burden of diarrhoeal disease, affecting primarily children and immunodebilitated individuals in resource-poor settings. Giardiosis and cryptosporidiosis also represent an important, often underestimate, public health threat in developed countries. In Spain only limited information is currently available on the epidemiology of these infections. Molecular data on the diversity, frequency, geographical distribution, and seasonality of G. duodenalis assemblages/sub-assemblages and Cryptosporidium species/sub-genotypes are particularly scarce.A longitudinal molecular epidemiological survey was conducted between July 2015 to September 2016 in patients referred to or attended at the Hospital San Pedro (La Rioja, Northern Spain) that tested positive for G. duodenalis (N = 106) or Cryptosporidium spp. (N = 103) by direct microscopy and/or a rapid lateral flow immunochromatographic assay. G. duodenalis infections were subsequently confirmed by real-time PCR and positive isolates assessed by multi-locus sequence genotyping of the glutamate dehydrogenase and β-giardin genes of the parasite. Cryptosporidium species and sub-genotypes were investigated at the 60 kDa glycoprotein or the small subunit ribosomal RNA genes of the parasite. Sociodemographic and clinical parameters of infected patients were also gathered and analysed.Out of 90 G. duodenalis-positive isolates by real-time PCR a total of 16 isolates were successfully typed. AII (44%, 7/16) was the most prevalent sub-assemblage found, followed by BIV (31%, 5/16) and BIII (19%, 3/16). A discordant genotype result AII/AIII was identified in an additional (6%, 1/16) isolate. No mixed infections A+B were detected. Similarly, a total of 81 Cryptosporidium spp. isolates were successfully typed, revealing the presence of C. hominis (81%, 66/81) and C. parvum (19%, 15/81). Obtained GP60 sequences were assigned to sub-type families Ib (73%, 59/81) within C. hominis, and IIa (7%, 6/81) and IId (2%, 2/81) within C. parvum. A marked inter-annual variation in Cryptosporidium cases was observed.Human giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis are commonly identified in patients seeking medical care in Northern Spain and represent a more important health concern than initially thought. Assemblage A within G. duodenalis and sub-genotype IbA10G2 within C. hominis were the genetic variants of these parasite species more frequently found circulating in the population under study. Molecular data presented here seem to suggest that G. duodenalis and Cryptosporidium infections arise through anthroponotic rather than zoonotic transmission in this Spanish region."

The aim of this study was to examine trends of overall, clinical and forensic autopsy rates among adults in the Netherlands over the last four decades, and trends per sex, age (groups), and hospital type. Methods We performed a retrospective study covering 35 years of Dutch national death counts (1977–2011), the number of in-hospital deceased patients, the number of deaths due to external causes, and the proportion of autopsies performed in these populations. The effects of sex, age and hospital category were analysed by linear and logistic regression and differences were evaluated by chi-square tests. Results Overall autopsy rates declined by 0.3% per calendar year, clinical autopsy rates by 0.7% per calendar year (from 31.4% to 7.7%), and forensic autopsy rates did not decline. Per calendar year the fraction of in-hospital deceased patients decreased by 0.2%. Autopsy rates were highest among men and younger patients; clinical autopsy rates were highest for patients dying in academic hospitals. Conclusions In the Netherlands clinical autopsy rates have rapidly declined while at the same time the fraction of in-hospital deaths decreased, both contributing to the overall reduced absolute number of autopsies performed. It is important to improve awareness among both clinicians and general practitioners of the significance of the clinical autopsy."

The rs1544410 or BsmI single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the intronic region of the VDR gene has been previously associated with vitamin D levels, obesity and insulin resistance. Aims This study was aimed to examine the association between BsmI polymorphism and risk of vitamin D deficiency, obesity and insulin resistance in adolescents living in a tropical country. Methods Thirteen-year-old adolescents were recruited via multistage sampling from twenty-three randomly selected schools across the city of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (n = 941). Anthropometric measurements were obtained. Obesity was defined as body mass index higher than the 95th percentile of the WHO chart. Levels of fasting serum vitamin D (25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D)), glucose and insulin were measured. HOMA-IR was calculated as an indicator for insulin resistance. Genotyping was performed using the Sequenom MassARRAY platform (n = 807). The associations between BsmI and vitamin D, anthropometric parameters and HOMA-IR were examined using analysis of covariance and logistic regression. Result Those with AA genotype of BsmI had significantly lower levels of 25(OH)D (p = 0.001) compared to other genotypes. No significant differences was found across genotypes for obesity parameters. The AA genotype was associated with higher risk of vitamin D deficiency (p = 0.03) and insulin resistance (p = 0.03) compared to GG. The A allele was significantly associated with increased risk of vitamin D deficiency compared to G allele (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.63 (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.03–2.59, p = 0.04). In those with concurrent vitamin D deficiency, having an A allele significantly increased their risk of having insulin resistance compared to G allele (adjusted OR = 2.66 (95% CI 1.36–5.19, p = 0.004). Conclusion VDR BsmI polymorphism was significantly associated with vitamin D deficiency and insulin resistance, but not with obesity in this population."
https://openalex.org/W2691282576,"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a central cellular energy sensor that adapts metabolism and growth to the energy state of the cell. AMPK senses the ratio of adenine nucleotides (adenylate energy charge) by competitive binding of AMP, ADP, and ATP to three sites (CBS1, CBS3, and CBS4) in its γ-subunit. Because these three binding sites are functionally interconnected, it remains unclear how nucleotides bind to individual sites, which nucleotides occupy each site under physiological conditions, and how binding to one site affects binding to the other sites. Here, we comprehensively analyze nucleotide binding to wild-type and mutant AMPK protein complexes by quantitative competition assays and by hydrogen-deuterium exchange MS. We also demonstrate that NADPH, in addition to the known AMPK ligand NADH, directly and competitively binds AMPK at the AMP-sensing CBS3 site. Our findings reveal how AMP binding to one site affects the conformation and adenine nucleotide binding at the other two sites and establish CBS3, and not CBS1, as the high affinity exchangeable AMP/ADP/ATP-binding site. We further show that AMP binding at CBS4 increases AMP binding at CBS3 by 2 orders of magnitude and reverses the AMP/ATP preference of CBS3. Together, these results illustrate how the three CBS sites collaborate to enable highly sensitive detection of cellular energy states to maintain the tight ATP homeostastis required for cellular metabolism."

https://openalex.org/W2626480093,"Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) is overexpressed in ovarian cancer and thus is a promising anticancer therapeutic target. Our previous work suggests that coumarin compounds are potential inhibitors of PDKs. In this study, we used the ovarian cancer cell line SKOV3 as the model system and examined whether dicumarol (DIC), a coumarin compound, could inhibit ovarian cancer through targeting PDK1. We showed that DIC potently inhibited the kinase activity of PDK1, shifted the glucose metabolism from aerobic glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation, generated a higher level of reactive oxygen species (ROS), attenuated the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), induced apoptosis, and reduced cell viability in vitro. The same phenotypes induced by DIC also were translated in vivo, leading to significant suppression of xenograft growth. This study not only identifies a novel inhibitor for PDK1, but it also reveals novel anticancer mechanisms of DIC and provides a promising anticancer therapy that targets the Warburg effect."
https://openalex.org/W2625072623,"Tropical montane forests provide an important natural laboratory to test ecological theory. While it is well-known that some aspects of forest structure change with altitude, little is known on the effects of altitude on above ground biomass (AGB), particularly with regard to changing height-diameter allometry. To address this we investigate (1) the effects of altitude on height-diameter allometry, (2) how different height-diameter allometric models affect above ground biomass estimates; and (3) how other forest structural, taxonomic and environmental attributes affect above ground biomass using 30 permanent sample plots (1-ha; all trees ≥ 10 cm diameter measured) established between 1250 and 2600 m asl in Kahuzi Biega National Park in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. Forest structure and species composition differed with increasing altitude, with four forest types identified. Different height-diameter allometric models performed better with the different forest types, as trees got smaller with increasing altitude. Above ground biomass ranged from 168 to 290 Mg ha-1, but there were no significant differences in AGB between forests types, as tree size decreased but stem density increased with increasing altitude. Forest structure had greater effects on above ground biomass than forest diversity. Soil attributes (K and acidity, pH) also significantly affected above ground biomass. Results show how forest structural, taxonomic and environmental attributes affect above ground biomass in African tropical montane forests. They particularly highlight that the use of regional height-diameter models introduces significant biases in above ground biomass estimates, and that different height-diameter models might be preferred for different forest types, and these should be considered in future studies."

Thermal analysis of articular cartilage was performed to examine the structural changes in collagen. At day 70 of gestation, a total of 12 sows (Large White Polish breed, at the second parity) were randomly assigned to two groups, with each group receiving either a basal diet or the same diet supplemented with 0.2 g/day HMB until the 90th day. Maternal HMB supplementation enhanced body weight, bone length, and diameter in males. It also improved geometric and mechanical properties contributing to increased bone morphology and endurance. In turn, alteration of the length was only observed in females. The positive effects were mediated by increased serum concentrations of insulin-like growth factor-1 and leptin. HMB-treatment enhanced the concentration of FSH, LH, estradiol, and testosterone. Serum TAP was enhanced by the HMB-treatment by 34% in females and 138% in males. Beneficial effects of the HMB-treatment on trabecular bone and content of proteoglycans in articular cartilage were shown. The HMB-treatment significantly changed the collagen structure in cartilages, especially in the females, which was demonstrated by the PSR analysis. Differences between the HMB-supplemented and the control females in the calorimetric peak temperatures were presumably related to different collagen fibril density in the articular cartilage structure. In summary, maternal HMB supplementation in the mid-gestation period significantly improved general growth and mechanical endurance of long bones by the influence on the somatotropic and pituitary-gonadal axes in the offspring."
https://openalex.org/W2569369954,"Birdsong is a complex behavior that exhibits hierarchical organization. While the representation of singing behavior and its hierarchical organization has been studied in some detail in avian cortical premotor circuits, our understanding of the role of the thalamus in adult birdsong is incomplete. Using a combination of behavioral and electrophysiological studies, we seek to expand on earlier work showing that the thalamic nucleus Uvaeformis (Uva) is necessary for the production of stereotyped, adult song in zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata). We confirm that complete bilateral lesions of Uva abolish singing in the 'directed' social context, but find that in the 'undirected' social context, such lesions result in highly variable vocalizations similar to early babbling song in juvenile birds. Recordings of neural activity in Uva reveal strong syllable-related modulation, maximally active prior to syllable onsets and minimally active prior to syllable offsets. Furthermore, both song and Uva activity exhibit a pronounced coherent modulation at 10Hz-a pattern observed in downstream premotor areas in adult and, even more prominently, in juvenile birds. These findings are broadly consistent with the idea that Uva is critical in the sequential activation of behavioral modules in HVC."

Methods Frequency of depression was determined according to the DSM-IV criteria for major depression or the National Institute of Mental Health criteria for depression in AD (NIMH-dAD). Severity of depression were assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia, and the depression subscale in Neuropsychiatric Inventory. The rates of depressive symptoms were compared between AD and DLB. Results A total of 312 patients were investigated (AD/DLB = 241/71). The frequency of major depression was significantly higher (p = 0.017) in DLB (19.7%) than in AD (8.7%). The higher frequency of depression in DLB was not reproduced by using the NIMH-dAD criteria (DLB: AD = 43.7%: 33.2%; p = 0.105). The severity of depression was higher in DLB than in AD according to the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (p < 0.001) and the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (p < 0.001). Among depressive symptoms, pervasive anhedonia had the highest odds ratio in DLB compared with AD. Conclusion This is the first study using the NIMH-dAD criteria to investigate the frequency of depression in DLB. Our study shows that co-morbid major depression is more frequent in DLB than in AD. Pervasive anhedonia had the greatest value for the differential diagnosis of depression between DLB and AD."
https://openalex.org/W2626959333,"Objective Traditionally, gait analysis has been centered on the idea of average behavior and normality. On one hand, clinical diagnoses and therapeutic interventions typically assume that average gait patterns remain constant over time. On the other hand, it is well known that all our movements are accompanied by a certain amount of variability, which does not allow us to make two identical steps. The purpose of this study was to examine changes in the intra-individual gait patterns across different time-scales (i.e., tens-of-mins, tens-of-hours). Methods Nine healthy subjects performed 15 gait trials at a self-selected speed on 6 sessions within one day (duration between two subsequent sessions from 10 to 90 mins). For each trial, time-continuous ground reaction forces and lower body joint angles were measured. A supervised learning model using a kernel-based discriminant regression was applied for classifying sessions within individual gait patterns. Results and discussion Discernable characteristics of intra-individual gait patterns could be distinguished between repeated sessions by classification rates of 67.8 ± 8.8% and 86.3 ± 7.9% for the six-session-classification of ground reaction forces and lower body joint angles, respectively. Furthermore, the one-on-one-classification showed that increasing classification rates go along with increasing time durations between two sessions and indicate that changes of gait patterns appear at different time-scales. Conclusion Discernable characteristics between repeated sessions indicate continuous intrinsic changes in intra-individual gait patterns and suggest a predominant role of deterministic processes in human motor control and learning. Natural changes of gait patterns without any externally induced injury or intervention may reflect continuous adaptations of the motor system over several time-scales. Accordingly, the modelling of walking by means of average gait patterns that are assumed to be near constant over time needs to be reconsidered in the context of these findings, especially towards more individualized and situational diagnoses and therapy."

We aimed to evaluate the potential interaction effect between corticosteroids and macrolides on the systemic inflammatory response in patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia to determine if combining these two immunomodulating agents was harmful, or possibly beneficial. Methods We performed a post-hoc exploratory analysis of a randomized clinical trial conducted in three tertiary hospitals in Spain. This trial included patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia with high inflammatory response (C-reactive protein [CRP] >15 mg/dL) who were randomized to receive methylprednisolone 0.5 mg/kg/tpd or placebo. The choice of antibiotic treatment was at the physician's discretion. One hundred and six patients were classified into four groups according to antimicrobial therapy combination (β-lactam plus macrolide or β-lactam plus fluoroquinolone) and corticosteroid arm (placebo or corticosteroids). The primary outcome was treatment failure (composite outcome of early treatment failure, or of late treatment failure, or of both early and late treatment failure). Results The methylprednisolone with β-lactam plus macrolide group had more elderly patients, with comorbidities, and higher pneumonia severity index (PSI) risk class V, but a lower proportion of intensive care unit admission, compared to the other groups. We found non differences in treatment failure between groups (overall p = 0.374); however, a significant difference in late treatment failure was observed (4 patients in the placebo with β-lactam plus macrolide group (31%) vs. 9 patients in the placebo with β-lactam plus fluoroquinolone group (24%) vs. 0 patients in the methylprednisolone with β-lactam plus macrolide group (0%) vs. 2 patients [5%] in the methylprednisolone with β-lactam plus fluoroquinolone group overall p = 0.009). We found a significant difference for In-hospital mortality in the per protocol population (overall p = 0.01). We did not find significant differences in treatment failure, early or late; or In-hospital mortality after adjusting for severity (PSI), year and centre of enrolment. Conclusions In this exploratory analysis, we observed that the glucocorticosteroids and macrolides combination had no statistically significant association with main clinical outcomes compared with other combinations in patients with severe community acquired pneumonia and a high inflammatory response after taking account potential confounders.

Prognostic biomarkers are urgently needed to identify patients with a high risk of death after initial curative treatment. Methylation status of the paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 2 (PITX2) has recently emerged as a powerful prognostic biomarker in various cancers. In the present study, the clinical performance of PITX2 methylation was validated in a HNSCC cohort by means of an independent analytical platform (Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip, Illumina, Inc.).A total of 528 HNSCC patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were included in the study. Death was defined as primary endpoint. PITX2 methylation was correlated with overall survival and clinicopathological parameters.PITX2 methylation was significantly associated with sex, tumor site, p16 status, and grade. In univariate Cox proportional hazards analysis, PITX2 hypermethylation analyzed as continuous and dichotomized variable was significantly associated with prolonged overall survival of HNSCC patients (continuous: hazard ratio (HR) = 0.19 [95%CI: 0.04-0.88], p = 0.034; dichotomized: HR = 0.52 [95%CI: 0.33-0.84], p = 0.007).

This protein aggregates in the endoplasmic reticulum, which is the main cause of liver disease in childhood. Based on recent evidences and on the frequency of liver disease occurrence in Z-1AT patients, it seems that liver disease progression is linked to still unknown genetic factors.We used an innovative approach combining yeast genetic screens with next generation exome sequencing to identify and functionally characterize the genes involved in 1ATD associated liver disease.Using yeast genetic screens, we identified HRD1, an Endoplasmic Reticulum Associated Degradation (ERAD) associated protein, as an inducer of Z-mediated toxicity. Whole exome sequencing of 1ATD patients resulted in the identification of two variants associated with liver damages in Z-1AT homozygous cases: HFE H63D and HERPUD1 R50H. Functional characterization in Z-1AT model cell lines demonstrated that impairment of the ERAD machinery combined with the HFE H63D variant expression decreased both cell proliferation and cell viability, while Unfolded Protein Response (UPR)-mediated cell death was hyperstimulated.This powerful experimental pipeline allowed us to identify and functionally validate two genes involved in Z-1AT-mediated severe liver toxicity. This pilot study moves forward our understanding on genetic modifiers involved in 1ATD and highlights the UPR pathway as a target for the treatment of liver diseases associated with 1ATD. Finally, these findings support a larger scale screening for HERPUD1 R50H and HFE H63D variants in the sub-group of 1ATD patients developing significant chronic hepatic injuries (hepatomegaly, chronic cholestasis, elevated liver enzymes) and at risk developing liver cirrhosis."

We assessed the effect of ART eligibility on treatment uptake and simulated the impact of WHO’s recommendations in South Africa. Methods We conducted an empirical analysis of cohort data using a regression discontinuity design, and then used this model for policy simulation. We enrolled all patients (n = 19,279) diagnosed with HIV between August 2011 and December 2013 in the Hlabisa HIV Treatment and Care Programme in rural South Africa. Patients were ART-eligible with CD4<350 cells/mm3 or Stage III/IV illness. We estimated: (1) distribution of first CD4 counts in 2013; (2) probability of initiating ART ≤6 months of HIV diagnosis under existing criteria at each CD4 count; (3) probability of initiating ART by CD4 count if thresholds were eliminated; and (4) number of expected new initiators if South Africa eliminates thresholds. Findings In 2013, 38.9% of patients diagnosed had a CD4 count ≥500. 8.0% of these patients initiated even without eligible CD4 counts. If CD4 criteria were eliminated, we project that an additional 19.2% of patients with CD4 ≥500 would initiate ART; 72.8% would not initiate ART despite being eligible. Eliminating CD4 criteria would increase the number starting ART by 26.7%. If these numbers hold nationally, this would represent an additional 164,000 initiators per year, a 5.2% increase in patients receiving ART and 5.3% increase in programme costs. Conclusions Removing CD4 criteria alone will modestly increase timely uptake of ART. However, our results suggest the majority of newly-eligible patients will not initiate. Improved testing, linkage, and initiation procedures are needed to achieve 90-90-90 targets."
https://openalex.org/W2626464749,"Background The ankle—brachial index (ABI) is a marker of generalized atherosclerosis and is predictive of future cardiovascular events. However, few studies have assessed its relation to long-term future cardiovascular events, especially in patients with borderline ABI. We therefore evaluated the relationship between long-term future cardiovascular events and ABI. Methods In the IMPACT-ABI study, a single-center, retrospective cohort study, we enrolled 3131 consecutive patients (67 ± 13 years; 82% male) hospitalized for cardiovascular disease and measured ABI between January 2005 and December 2012. After excluding patients with an ABI > 1.4, the remaining 3056 patients were categorized as having low ABI (≤ 0.9), borderline ABI (0.91–0.99), or normal ABI (1.00–1.40). The primary endpoint was MACE (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction [MI] and stroke). The secondary endpoints were cardiovascular death, MI, stroke, admission due to heart failure, and major bleeding. Results During a 4.8-year mean follow-up period, the incidences of MACE (low vs. borderline vs. normal: 32.9% vs. 25.0% vs. 14.6%, P<0.0001) and cardiovascular death (26.2% vs. 18.7% vs. 8.9%, P<0.0001) differed significantly across ABIs. The incidences of stroke (9.1% vs. 8.6% vs. 4.8%, P<0.0001) and heart failure (25.7% vs. 20.8% vs. 8.9%, P<0.0001) were significantly higher in the low and borderline ABI groups than in the normal ABI group. But the incidences of MI and major bleeding were similar in the borderline and normal ABI groups. The hazard ratios for MACE adjusted for traditional atherosclerosis risk factors were significantly higher in patients with low and borderline ABI than those with normal ABI (HR, 1.93; 95%CI: 1.44–2.59, P < 0.0001, HR, 1.54; 95% CI: 1.03–2.29, P = 0.035). Conclusions The incidence of long-term adverse events was markedly higher among patients with low or borderline ABI than among those with normal ABI. This suggests that more attention should be paid to patients with borderline ABIs, especially with regard to cardiovascular death, stroke, and heart failure."
https://openalex.org/W2626952205,"To confirm the association of previously discovered psoriasis (Ps) risk loci with the disease in a Polish population and to create predictive models based on the combination of these single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).Thirty-eight SNPs were genotyped in 480 Ps patients and 490 controls. Alleles distributions were compared between patients and controls, as well as between different Ps sub-phenotypes. The genetic risk score (GRS) was calculated to assess the cumulative risk conferred by multiple loci.We confirmed associations of several loci with Ps: HLA-C, REL, IL12B, TRIM39/RPP21, POU5F1, MICA. The analysis of ROC curves showed that GRS combining 16 SNPs at least nominally (uncorrected P<0.05) associated with Ps (GRS-N) had significantly better discriminative power than GRS combining SNPs associated with Ps after the Bonferroni correction (AUC 0.776 vs. 0.750, P = 1 x 10-4) or HLA-C (AUC 0.776 vs. 0.694, P<1 x 10-5). On the other hand, adding additional SNPs to the model did not improve its discriminatory ability (AUC 0.782 for GRS combining all SNPs, P>0.05). In order to assess the total risk conferred by GRS-N, we calculated ORs according to GRS-N quartile - the Ps OR for top vs. bottom GRS-N quartiles was 12.29 (P<1 x 10-6). The analysis of different Ps sub-phenotypes showed an association of GRS-N with age of onset and family history of Ps.We confirmed the association of Ps with several previously identified genetic risk factors in a Polish population. We found that a GRS combining 16 SNPs at least nominally associated with Ps had a significantly better discriminatory ability than HLA-C or GRS combining SNPs associated with Ps after the Bonferroni correction. In contrast, adding additional SNPs to GRS did not increase significantly the discriminative power."
https://openalex.org/W2626514221,"Background Globally, Latin America ranks third among regions with most cases of AIDS related cryptococcal meningitis. In 2009, a lateral flow immunoassay (LFA) for the detection of cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) was developed as a potential point-of-care test for diagnosis of cryptococcal infection. In 2011 World Health Organizations recommended on CrAg screening for HIV positive persons with CD4 below 100 cells/μL, followed by preemptive fluconazole treatment. However, in Argentina no formal recommendations for CrAg screening have been issued. Methods HIV positive patients > = 18 years with advanced immunosuppression (CD4 counts ≤100 cells/μL within 3 months or WHO stage III/IV), who visited the hospital between April 1, 2014 and January 31, 2015, were included. The LFA was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions on all serum samples. When CrAg detection was positive, a lumbar puncture was performed to rule out cryptococcal meningitis. Patients without evidence of meningeal involvement were treated with preemptive oral fluconazole in ambulatory care. Results We included 123 patients. Prevalence of CrAg-positivity was 8.1%. Among the 10 CrAg-positive patients, 6 had meningeal involvement detected through the CSF analysis (CSF India-ink testing, CSF CrAg and culture). The remaining 4 patients with positive CrAg received targeted preemptive treatment with oral fluconazole and were free of cryptococcal disease during the follow-up period. None of the 113 patients with a negative CrAg test result developed cryptococcal disease. Conclusions This is the first study in Argentina, to our knowledge, describing the prevalence of cryptococcosis and usefulness of CrAg screening. LFA provided early diagnosis to determine a high prevalence of CrAg in our hospital, and that screening for subclinical infection with preemptive antifungal treatment, prevented a substantial proportion of meningeal disease."
https://openalex.org/W2625097671,"White-nose syndrome (WNS) is a devastating fungal disease that has been causing the mass mortality of hibernating bats in North America since 2006 and is caused by the psychrophilic dermatophyte Pseudogymnoascus destructans. Infected bats shed conidia into hibernaculum sediments and surfaces, but it is unknown if P. destructans can form stable, reproductive populations outside its bat hosts. Previous studies have found non-pathogenic Pseudogymnoascus in bat hibernacula, and these fungi may provide insight into the natural history of P. destructans. We compared the relatedness, resource capture, and competitive ability of non-pathogenic Pseudogymnoascus isolates with P. destructans to determine if they have similar adaptations for survival in hibernacula sediment. All non-pathogenic Pseudogymnoascus isolates grew faster, utilized a broader range of substrates with higher efficiency, and were generally more resistant to antifungals compared to P. destructans. All isolates also showed the ability to displace P. destructans in co-culture assays, but only some produced extractible antifungal metabolites. These results suggest that P. destructans would perform poorly in the same environmental niche as non-pathogenic Pseudogymnoascus, and must have an alternative saprophytic survival strategy if it establishes active populations in hibernaculum sediment and non-host surfaces."
https://openalex.org/W2625592265,"Background Wheelchairs for children with impaired mobility provide health, developmental and psychosocial benefits, however there is limited understanding of how mobility aids affect the health-related quality of life of children with impaired mobility. Preference-based health-related quality of life outcome measures are used to calculate quality-adjusted life years; an important concept in health economics. The aim of this research was to understand how young wheelchair users and their parents define health-related quality of life in relation to mobility impairment and wheelchair use. Methods The sampling frame was children with impaired mobility (≤18 years) who use a wheelchair and their parents. Data were collected through semi-structured face-to-face interviews conducted in participants’ homes. Qualitative framework analysis was used to analyse the interview transcripts. An a priori thematic coding framework was developed. Emerging codes were grouped into categories, and refined into analytical themes. The data were used to build an understanding of how children with impaired mobility define health-related quality of life in relation to mobility impairment, and to assess the applicability of two standard measures of health-related quality of life. Results Eleven children with impaired mobility and 24 parents were interviewed across 27 interviews. Participants defined mobility-related quality of life through three distinct but interrelated concepts: 1) participation and positive experiences; 2) self-worth and feeling fulfilled; 3) health and functioning. A good degree of consensus was found between child and parent responses, although there was some evidence to suggest a shift in perception of mobility-related quality of life with child age. Conclusions Young wheelchair users define health-related quality of life in a distinct way as a result of their mobility impairment and adaptation use. Generic, preference-based measures of health-related quality of life lack sensitivity in this population. Development of a mobility-related quality of life outcome measure for children is recommended."
https://openalex.org/W2625510020,"Genetic variants of ESR1 have been implicated in multiple diseases, including behavioral disorders, but causative variants remain uncertain. We have searched for regulatory variants affecting ESR1 expression in human brain, measuring allelic ESR1 mRNA expression in human brain tissues with marker SNPs in exon4 representing ESR1-008 (or ESRα-36), and in the 3'UTR of ESR1-203, two main ESR1 isoforms in brain. In prefrontal cortex from subjects with bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and controls (n = 35 each; Stanley Foundation brain bank), allelic ESR1 mRNA ratios deviated from unity up to tenfold at the exon4 marker SNP, with large allelic ratios observed primarily in bipolar and schizophrenic subjects. SNP scanning and targeted sequencing identified rs2144025, associated with large allelic mRNA ratios (p = 1.6E10-6). Moreover, rs2144025 was significantly associated with ESR1 mRNA levels in the Brain eQTL Almanac and in brain regions in the Genotype-Tissue Expression project. In four GWAS cohorts, rs2104425 was significantly associated with behavioral traits, including: hypomanic episodes in female bipolar disorder subjects (GAIN bipolar disorder study; p = 0.0004), comorbid psychological symptoms in both males and females with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (GAIN ADHD, p = 0.00002), psychological diagnoses in female children (eMERGE study of childhood health, subject age ≥9, p = 0.0009), and traits in schizophrenia (e.g., grandiose delusions, GAIN schizophrenia, p = 0.0004). The first common ESR1 variant (MAF 12-33% across races) linked to regulatory functions, rs2144025 appears conditionally to affect ESR1 mRNA expression in the brain and modulate traits in behavioral disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2626469107,"Immunodeficient mice transplanted with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are promising tools to evaluate human immune responses to vaccines. However, these mice usually develop severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), which makes estimation of antigen-specific IgG production after antigen immunization difficult. To evaluate antigen-specific IgG responses in PBMC-transplanted immunodeficient mice, we developed a novel NOD/Shi-scid-IL2rγnull (NOG) mouse strain that systemically expresses the human IL-4 gene (NOG-hIL-4-Tg). After human PBMC transplantation, GVHD symptoms were significantly suppressed in NOG-hIL-4-Tg compared to conventional NOG mice. In kinetic analyses of human leukocytes, long-term engraftment of human T cells has been observed in peripheral blood of NOG-hIL-4-Tg, followed by dominant CD4+ T rather than CD8+ T cell proliferation. Furthermore, these CD4+ T cells shifted to type 2 helper (Th2) cells, resulting in long-term suppression of GVHD. Most of the human B cells detected in the transplanted mice had a plasmablast phenotype. Vaccination with HER2 multiple antigen peptide (CH401MAP) or keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) successfully induced antigen-specific IgG production in PBMC-transplanted NOG-hIL-4-Tg. The HLA haplotype of donor PBMCs might not be relevant to the antibody secretion ability after immunization. These results suggest that the human PBMC-transplanted NOG-hIL-4-Tg mouse is an effective tool to evaluate the production of antigen-specific IgG antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W2625138689,"To investigate choroidal thickness (CT) and its associations in children in a school-based study.The cross-sectional school-based Gobi Desert Children Eye Study included 1565 out of 1911 (81.9%) eligible children from all schools in the oasis region of Ejina in the Gobi Desert. A detailed ophthalmic examination was performed, including spectral-domain optical coherence tomography with enhanced depth imaging for CT measurement.CT measurements were available for 1463 (93.5%) students (mean age: 11.8±3.5 years; range:7-21 years). Mean subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT) was 282±49μm. CT was thickest at 1000μm temporal to the fovea (286±49μm), followed by the subfoveal region (282±49 μm; P<0.001), the region at 2500μm temporal to the fovea (278±49μm), the region at 1000μm nasal to the fovea (254±49μm;P<0.001), and the region at 2500μm nasal to the fovea (197±50μm;P<0.001). In cross-sectional analysis, the mean SFCT increased with age from 288μm at 7 years of age to 304μm at 11 years, and then decreased to 258 μm at 18 years. In multivariate analysis, thicker SFCT was associated (regression coefficient r:0.38) with higher hyperopic refractive error (P<0.001;standardized regression coefficient beta:0.31;non-standardized regression coefficient B:7.61;95% confidence intervals (CI):6.29,8.93), younger age (P<0.001;beta:-0.10;B:-1.39;95%CI:-2.14,-0.64), male gender (P = 0.03;beta:-0.05;B:-5.33;95%CI:-10.1,-0.53), higher corneal refractive power (P<0.001;beta:0.12;B:3.68;95%CI:2.12,5.24), and non-Han Chinese ethnicity (P = 0.03;beta:0.05;B:6.16;95%CI:0.50,11.8). Ratio of CT(1000μm nasal to fovea)/SFCT (0.90±0.06;range:0.66,1.23) and ratio of CT(2500μm nasal to fovea)/SFCT (0.70±0.13;range:0.28,1.23) decreased with older age (P = 0.01;and P = 0.001, respectively), while ratio of CT(1000μm temporal to fovea)/SFCT (1.02±0.06;range:0.56,1.37) and ratio of CT(2500μm temporal to fovea)/SFCT (0.99±0.11;range:0.54,1.84) increased with older age (both P<0.001). Time spent outdoors or indoors was not significantly associated with CT-related parameter in multivariate analysis.In contrast to SFCT in adults and despite elongating axial length, SFCT in children increased in cross-sectional analysis with older age (up to 11 years of age) and then started to decrease with further ageing. It suggests an increase in choroidal volume up to the age of 11 years. In children, the choroid was thickest at 1000μm temporal to the fovea, followed by the subfoveal region, and this difference significantly increased with older age. In contrast, CT nasal to the fovea in relationship to SFCT decreased with older age. CT was independent of lifestyle-associated parameters."
https://openalex.org/W2625040953,"The soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis is often found in association with plants in the rhizosphere. Previously, plant polysaccharides have been shown to stimulate formation of root-associated multicellular communities, or biofilms, in this bacterium, yet the underlying mechanism is not fully understood. A five-gene gan operon (ganSPQAB) in B. subtilis has recently been shown to be involved in utilization of the plant-derived polysaccharide galactan. Despite these findings, molecular details about the regulation of the operon and the role of the operon in biofilm formation remain elusive. In this study, we performed comprehensive genetic analyses on the regulation of the gan operon. We show that this operon is regulated both by a LacI-like transcription repressor (GanR), which directly binds to pairs of inverted DNA repeats in the promoter region of the operon, and by the catabolite control protein A (CcpA). Derepression can be triggered by the presence of the inducer β-1,4-galactobiose, a hydrolysis product of galactan, or in situ when B. subtilis cells are associated with plant roots. In addition to the transcriptional regulation, the encoded ß-galactosidase GanA (by ganA), which hydrolyzes ß-1,4-galactobiose into galactose, is inhibited at the enzymatic level by the catalytic product galactose. Thus, the galactan utilization pathway is under complex regulation involving both positive and negative feedback mechanisms in B. subtilis. We discuss about the biological significance of such complex regulation as well as a hypothesis of biofilm induction by galactan via multiple mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2625436637,"Purpose Moyamoya disease (MMD) is a rare cerebrovascular disorder characterized by stenosis of the internal carotid arteries with compensatory development of collateral vessels. Although a founder variant of RNF213, p.Arg4810Lys (c.14429G>A, rs112735431), is a major genetic risk factor for MMD in East Asians, the frequency and disease susceptibility of other variants in this gene remain largely unknown. In the present study, we investigated the association of RNF213 variants with MMD in Korean patients and population controls. Methods For all RNF213 variants listed in the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) as disease-causing or likely disease-causing mutations for MMD, genotyping was performed using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Genetic data from 264 adult patients with MMD were analyzed and compared with two control populations comprised of 622 and 1,100 Korean individuals, respectively. Results Among the 30 RNF213 variants that were listed in the HGMD, p.Arg4810Lys was identified in 67.4% (178/264) of patients with MMD and showed a significantly higher allele frequency than in the controls, giving an odds ratio of 63.29 (95% confidence interval, 33.11–120.98) for the 622 controls and 48.55 (95% confidence interval, 31.00–76.03) for the 1100 controls. One additional variant, p.Ala5021Val (c.15062C>T, rs138130613), was identified in 0.8% (2/264) of patients; however, the allele frequencies were not significantly different from those in the controls. Conclusions These results suggest that, in our cohort of Korean patients, the p.Arg4810Lys is the only variant that is strongly associated with MMD among the 30 RNF213 variants listed in the HGMD."
https://openalex.org/W2626317404,"The incidence of stroke in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals has been well analyzed in recent epidemiological studies. However, little is known about the specific contribution of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection to stroke among HIV-infected individuals. The aims of this study were to analyze trends in the incidence rates of stroke in HIV-infected individuals during the combination antiretroviral (cART) era in Spain and to categorize them by the presence or absence of HCV coinfection. We analyzed hospital discharges with a diagnosis of stroke in Spain according to ICD-9-CM during 1997-2013. The study period was divided into four calendar periods (1997-1999, 2000-2003, 2004-2007, and 2008-2013). Patients were classified according to HCV serology. The number of HIV-infected patients was estimated based on data from the National Centre of Epidemiology. We calculated incidence rates (events per 10,000 patient-years) and in-hospital case fatality rates (CFR). The incidence of hemorrhagic stroke (HS) decreased in HIV-monoinfected patients (15.8 [1997-1999] to 6.5 [2008-2013]; P<0.001) and increased in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients (1.3 [1997-1999] to 5.5 [2008-2013]; P<0.001). The incidence of ischemic stroke (IS) decreased in HIV-monoinfected patients (27.4 [1997-1999] to 21.7 [2008-2013]; P = 0.005) and increased in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients (1.8 [1997-1999] to 11.9 [2008-2013]; P<0.001). The CFR was 3.3 times higher for HS than for IS for the whole study period. The CFR of HS in HIV-monoinfected patients decreased significantly (47.4% [1997-1999] to 30.6% [2008-2013]; P = 0.010) but did not change significantly among HIV/HCV-coinfected patients (41.4% [1997-1999] to 44.7% [2008-2013]; P = 0.784). The CFR of IS in the whole HIV-infected population decreased significantly (14.6% [1997-1999] to 10.9% [2008-2013]; P = 0.034), although no significant differences were found when each group was analyzed separately. In conclusion, after the introduction of cART, HS and IS rates decreased in HIV-monoinfected individuals, but increased steadily in HIV/HCV-coinfected individuals."

The objective of this study was to determine whether tesamorelin, a stabilized growth hormone-releasing hormone analogue, would alter insulin sensitivity or control of diabetes. Design A 12-week randomized, placebo-controlled study of 53 patients with type 2 diabetes. Three treatment groups: placebo, 1 and 2 mg tesamorelin. Measurements Fasting glucose, glucose and insulin from oral glucose tolerance test, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), home blood glucose, insulin-like growth factor-1, and lipids. Main outcome measure Relative insulin response following oral ingestion of glucose. Results No significant differences were observed between groups in relative insulin response over the 12-week treatment period. At Week 12, fasting glucose, HbA1c and overall diabetes control were not significantly different between groups. In addition, relevant modifications in diabetes medications were similar between groups. Total cholesterol (-0.3±0.6 mmol/L) and non-HDL cholesterol (-0.3±0.5 mmol/L) significantly decreased from baseline to Week 12 in the tesamorelin 2 mg group (p<0.05 vs. placebo). No patient discontinued the study due to loss of diabetes control. Conclusions Treatment of type 2 diabetic patients with tesamorelin for 12 weeks did not alter insulin response or glycemic control.

https://openalex.org/W2626533257,"Neonatal imitation is the matching of (often facial) gestures by newborn infants. Some studies suggest that performance of facial gestures is due to general arousal, which may produce false positives on neonatal imitation assessments. Here we examine whether arousal is linked to facial gesturing in newborn infant rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). We tested 163 infants in a neonatal imitation paradigm in their first postnatal week and analyzed their lipsmacking gestures (a rapid opening and closing of the mouth), tongue protrusion gestures, and yawn responses (a measure of arousal). Arousal increased during dynamic stimulus presentation compared to the static baseline across all conditions, and arousal was higher in the facial gestures conditions than the nonsocial control condition. However, even after controlling for arousal, we found a condition-specific increase in facial gestures in infants who matched lipsmacking and tongue protrusion gestures. Thus, we found no support for the arousal hypothesis. Consistent with reports in human newborns, imitators' propensity to match facial gestures is based on abilities that go beyond mere arousal. We discuss optimal testing conditions to minimize potentially confounding effects of arousal on measurements of neonatal imitation."
https://openalex.org/W2626716999,"Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death of death in Taiwan. Atherosclerosis can lead to serious problems, including heart attack, stroke, or even death. Coronary heart disease (CHD) occurs when plaque builds up in the coronary arteries to cause the ischemic heart disease which will enhance myocardial remodeling and also induce myocardial hypoxia. High density lipoprotein (HDL) has been proposed to have cardio-protective effects. Under hypoxic conditions (1%O2 for 24hr), in H9c2 cells, reactive oxygen species (ROS) is induced which leads to cardiomyocyte apoptosis and cardiac dysfunction. Therefore, the present study described the protective effect of HDL on hypoxia-induced cardiomyocyte damage. We investigated the NADPH oxidase-produced ROS-related signaling pathways and apoptosis in cardiomyocytes under hypoxia conditions. Results showed that the ROS mediated cardiac damage might occur via AT1 and PKC activation. Furthermore, hypoxia downregulated the survival protein (p-AKTser473) and anti-apoptotic protein (BCL2), whereas pro-apoptotic protein, Bax and caspase 3 were upregulated. These detrimental effects by ROS and apoptosis were prevented by HDL pretreatment. Our findings revealed the underlying molecular mechanism by which HDL suppresses the hypoxia-induced cardiomyocyte dysfunction. Further, we elucidated the role of HDL on preventing hypoxia induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis is mediated through the inhibition of NADPH oxidase-derived ROS."
https://openalex.org/W2625218760,"We investigated whether caffeine ingestion before submaximal exercise bouts would affect supramaximal oxygen demand and maximal accumulated oxygen deficit (MAOD), and if caffeine-induced improvement on the anaerobic capacity (AC) could be detected by different methods. Nine men took part in several submaximal and supramaximal exercise bouts one hour after ingesting caffeine (5 mg·kg-1) or placebo. The AC was estimated by MAOD, alternative MAOD, critical power, and gross efficiency methods. Caffeine had no effect on exercise endurance during the supramaximal bout (caffeine: 131.3 ± 21.9 and placebo: 130.8 ± 20.8 s, P = 0.80). Caffeine ingestion before submaximal trials did not affect supramaximal oxygen demand and MAOD compared to placebo (7.88 ± 1.56 L and 65.80 ± 16.06 kJ vs. 7.89 ± 1.30 L and 62.85 ± 13.67 kJ, P = 0.99). Additionally, MAOD was similar between caffeine and placebo when supramaximal oxygen demand was estimated without caffeine effects during submaximal bouts (67.02 ± 16.36 and 62.85 ± 13.67 kJ, P = 0.41) or when estimated by alternative MAOD (56.61 ± 8.49 and 56.87 ± 9.76 kJ, P = 0.91). The AC estimated by gross efficiency was also similar between caffeine and placebo (21.80 ± 3.09 and 20.94 ± 2.67 kJ, P = 0.15), but was lower in caffeine when estimated by critical power method (16.2 ± 2.6 vs. 19.3 ± 3.5 kJ, P = 0.03). In conclusion, caffeine ingestion before submaximal bouts did not affect supramaximal oxygen demand and consequently MAOD. Otherwise, caffeine seems to have no clear positive effect on AC."
https://openalex.org/W2626682108,"Facial identity and facial expression processing both appear to follow a protracted developmental trajectory, yet these trajectories have been studied independently and have not been directly compared. Here we investigated whether these processes develop at the same or different rates using matched identity and expression discrimination tasks. The Identity task begins with a target face that is a morph between two identities (Identity A/Identity B). After a brief delay, the target face is replaced by two choice faces: 100% Identity A and 100% Identity B. Children 5-12-years-old were asked to pick the choice face that is most similar to the target identity. The Expression task is matched in format and difficulty to the Identity task, except the targets are morphs between two expressions (Angry/Happy, or Disgust/Surprise). The same children were asked to pick the choice face with the expression that is most similar to the target expression. There were significant effects of age, with performance improving (becoming more accurate and faster) on both tasks with increasing age. Accuracy and reaction times were not significantly different across tasks and there was no significant Age x Task interaction. Thus, facial identity and facial expression discrimination appear to develop at a similar rate, with comparable improvement on both tasks from age five to twelve. Because our tasks are so closely matched in format and difficulty, they may prove useful for testing face identity and face expression processing in special populations, such as autism or prosopagnosia, where one of these abilities might be impaired."
https://openalex.org/W2625404449,"Increased adrenergic tone might be an additional trigger of orthostatic stress of vasovagal syncope (VVS). Exercise before standing might provide increased sensitivity compared to standing using a sublingual nitroglycerines protocol during tilt table testing. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of treadmill testing before standing with nitroglycerin administration.A total of 36 patients with syncope or presyncope were enrolled for the test. VVS was confirmed in 29 patients according to the Calgary Score (≥ -2), including 20 patients who were likely to have typical (classical) VVS. All 36 subjects were subjected to a novel provocation test consisting of treadmill test using the Bruce protocol followed by standing with administration of 300 μg sublingual nitroglycerin. Consequently, syncope or presyncope occurred in 22 patients of the 36 patients. The sensitivity and a specificity of the test for Calgary score based VVS was 82.7% and 85.75%, respectively. Reproducibility rate for typical VVS was 90% (18 of 20). In all symptomatic patients, systolic blood pressure dropped to < 90 mmHg and symptom occurred a mean of 6.7 ± 2.3 minutes after the nitroglycerine administration. No patient required anticholinergics injection to restore vital signs.Treadmill test with administration of sublingual nitroglycerines might be safely used to reproduce syncope in patients with VVS.

A validated 25-item self-administered questionnaire covering interest and attitude related to pharmacy practice-research was distributed. Responses were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. A total of 389 community pharmacists responded to the survey (response rate- 88.4%). Most of community pharmacists showed a high level of interest and positive attitude in being involved in all aspects of pharmacy practice-research. The median summary score for interest and attitude were 38 (IQR 20–40) (range possible 10–50) and 30 (IQR 18–39), respectively. Sixty-seven percent of the respondents thought about being involved in research, felt research is important for their career (57.6%), confident to conduct the research (56.2%), and agreed that research is a part of pharmacy practice (48.5%). However, only forty-six percent agreed that they underwent research training. A multivariate analysis showed that females were more interested in pharmacy practice research than males [AOR: 1.50, 95% CI: 0.99–2.27; p<0.05]. Community pharmacists showed high interest towards several areas of research competencies and demonstrated positive attitude towards pharmacy practice-research. Our findings suggest that providing research training to community pharmacists may contribute in undertaking research activities and build the research capacity in Ethiopia."

In humans, type 1 deiodinase (D1) is highly expressed in the liver, but the mechanism by which its gene expression is regulated remains to be elucidated. Liver X receptor α (LXRα), a transcription factor of the nuclear receptor superfamily, is highly expressed in the liver, where it functions as a sensor for excess intracellular oxysterols. LXRα interacts with other nuclear receptors on promoters of genes that contain a binding core sequence for nuclear receptors. In addition, it is reported that the promoter of the gene encoding human D1 (hDIO1) contains the core sequence for one of nuclear receptors, thyroid hormone receptor (TR). We investigated the involvement of LXRα in the regulation of hDIO1, in the liver. We performed hDIO1 promoter–reporter assays using a synthetic LXR agonist, T0901317, and compared promoter activity between a human liver carcinoma cell line, HepG2, and a clone of human embryonic kidney cells, TSA201. We defined the region between nucleotides −131 and −114, especially nucleotides −126 and −125, of the hDIO1 promoter as critical for basal and LXRα-mediated specific transcriptional activation in HepG2 cells. An increase in hDIO1 expression was observed in LXRα-stimulated cells, but absent in cycloheximide-treated cells, indicating that new protein synthesis is required for LXRα-mediated regulation of hDIO1. On the other hand, electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that LXRα and RXRα bound to the hDIO1 promoter. We also demonstrated that LXRα and TRβ compete with each other on this specific region of the promoter. In conclusion, our results indicated that LXRα plays a specific and important role in activation of TH by regulating D1, and that LXRα binds to and regulates the hDIO1 promoter, competing with TRβ on specific sequences within the promoter."
https://openalex.org/W2625584408,"Quarter vehicle model is the simplest representation of a vehicle that belongs to lumped-mass vehicle models. It is widely used in vehicle and suspension analyses, particularly those related to ride dynamics. However, as much as its common adoption, it is also commonly accepted without quantification that this model is not as accurate as many higher-degree-of-freedom models due to its simplicity and limited degrees of freedom. This study investigates the trade-off between simplicity and accuracy within the context of quarter vehicle model by determining the effect of adding various modeling details on model accuracy. In the study, road input detail, tire detail, suspension stiffness detail and suspension damping detail were factored in, and several enhanced models were compared to the base model to assess the significance of these details. The results clearly indicated that these details do have effect on simulated vehicle response, but to various extents. In particular, road input detail and suspension damping detail have the most significance and are worth being added to quarter vehicle model, as the inclusion of these details changed the response quite fundamentally. Overall, when it comes to lumped-mass vehicle modeling, it is reasonable to say that model accuracy depends not just on the number of degrees of freedom employed, but also on the contributions from various modeling details."
https://openalex.org/W2626097148,"CF2 and Mef2 influence a variety of developmental muscle processes at distinct stages of development. Nevertheless, the exact nature of the CF2-Mef2 relationship and its effects on muscle building remain yet to be resolved. Here, we explored the regulatory role of CF2 in the Drosophila embryo muscle formation. To address this question and not having proper null CF2 mutants we exploited loss or gain of function strategies to study the contribution of CF2 to Mef2 transcription regulation and to muscle formation. Our data point to CF2 as a factor involved in the regulation of muscle final size and/or the number of nuclei present in each muscle. This function is independent of its role as a Mef2 collaborative factor in the transcriptional regulation of muscle-structural genes. Although Mef2 expression patterns do not change, reductions or increases in parallel in CF2 and Mef2 transcript abundance were observed in interfered and overexpressed CF2 embryos. Since CF2 expression variations yield altered Mef2 expression levels but with correct spatio-temporal Mef2 expression patterns, it can be concluded that only the mechanism controlling expression levels is de-regulated. Here, it is proposed that CF2 regulates Mef2 expression through a Feedforward Loop circuit."

https://openalex.org/W2625895263,"TAL (transcription activator-like) effectors (TALEs) are bacterial proteins that are secreted from bacteria to plant cells to act as transcriptional activators. TALEs and related proteins (RipTALs, BurrH, MOrTL1 and MOrTL2) contain approximate tandem repeats that differ in conserved positions that define specificity. Using PERL, we screened ~47 million protein sequences for TALE-like architecture characterized by approximate tandem repeats (between 30 and 43 amino acids in length) and sequence variability in conserved positions, without requiring sequence similarity to TALEs. Candidate proteins were scored according to their propensity for nuclear localization, secondary structure, repeat sequence complexity, as well as covariation and predicted structural proximity of variable residues. Biological context was tentatively inferred from co-occurrence of other domains and interactome predictions. Approximate repeats with TALE-like features that merit experimental characterization were found in a protein of chestnut blight fungus, a eukaryotic plant pathogen."
