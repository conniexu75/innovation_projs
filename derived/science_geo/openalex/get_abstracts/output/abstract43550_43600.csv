https://openalex.org/W2059556539,"Expression of a complementary DNA (cDNA) encoding the mouse MyoD1 protein in a variety of fibroblast and adipoblast cell lines converts them to myogenic cells. Polyclonal antisera to fusion proteins containing the MyoD1 sequence show that MyoD1 is a phosphoprotein present in the nuclei of proliferating myoblasts and differentiated myotubes but not expressed in 10T1/2 fibroblasts or other nonmuscle cell types. Functional domains of the MyoD1 protein were analyzed by site-directed deletional mutagenesis of the MyoD1 cDNA. Deletion of a highly basic region (residues 102 to 135) interferes with both nuclear localization and induction of myogenesis. Deletion of a short region (residues 143 to 162) that is similar to a conserved region in the c-Myc family of proteins eliminates the ability of the MyoD1 protein to initiate myogenesis but does not alter nuclear localization. Deletions of regions spanning the remainder of MyoD1 did not affect nuclear localization and did not inhibit myogenesis. Furthermore, expression of only 68 amino acids of MyoD1, containing the basic and the Myc similarity domains, is sufficient to activate myogenesis in stably transfected 10T1/2 cells. Genetic analysis maps the MyoD1 gene to mouse chromosome 7 and human chromosome 11."
https://openalex.org/W2033618020,"Transcriptional activation of the int-1 gene by proviral insertion mutations is thought to be a key step in mammary tumor induction by the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV). To test this hypothesis, we have constructed an int-1 allele resembling those found in virus-induced tumors, with an MMTV LTR placed 5' to the int-1 gene in the opposite transcriptional orientation. Transgenic mice harboring this allele express int-1 RNA at high levels in mammary and salivary glands of male and female mice and in male reproductive organs. The mammary glands of males and virgin females are grossly hyperplastic compared with those of nontrasgenic littermates. Mammary and (less frequently) salivary adenocarcinomas occur in these animals at rates indicating that transcriptional activation of int-1 and associated hyperplasia are initiating events in multistep carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1975729483,"Control of growth and differentiation during mammalian embryogenesis may be regulated by growth factors from embryonic or maternal sources. With the use of single-cell messenger RNA phenotyping, the simultaneous expression of growth factor transcripts in single or small numbers of preimplantation mouse embryos was examined. Transcripts for platelet-derived growth factor A chain (PDGF-A), transforming growth factor (TGF)-alpha, and TGF-beta 1, but not for four other growth factors, were found in whole blastocysts. TGF-alpha, TGF-beta 1, and PDGF antigens were detected in blastocysts by immunocytochemistry. Both PDGF-A and TGF-alpha were detected as maternal transcripts in the unfertilized ovulated oocyte, and again in blastocysts. TGF-beta 1 transcripts appeared only after fertilization. The expression of a subset of growth factors in mouse blastocysts suggests a role for these factors in the growth and differentiation of early mammalian embryos."
https://openalex.org/W2060071007,"Synthesis of a small group of highly conserved proteins in response to elevated temperature and other agents that induce stress is a universal feature of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Although correlative evidence suggests that these proteins play a role in enhancing survival during and after stress, there is no direct evidence to support this in mammalian cells. To assess the role of the most highly conserved heat shock protein (hsp) family during heat shock, affinity-purified monoclonal antibodies to hsp70 were introduced into fibroblasts by needle microinjection. In addition to impairing the heat-induced translocation of hsp70 proteins into the nucleus after mild heat shock treatment, injected cells were unable to survive a brief incubation at 45Â°C. Cells injected with control antibodies survived a similar heat shock. These results indicate that functional hsp70 is required for survival of these cells during and after thermal stress."
https://openalex.org/W1972562299,"Resistance to antineoplastic agents is the major obstacle to curative therapy of cancer. Tumor cell lines with acquired resistance to the antineoplastic agent cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) overexpressed metallothionein and demonstrated cross-resistance to alkylating agents such as chlorambucil and melphalan. Human carcinoma cells that maintained high levels of metallothionein because of chronic exposure to heavy metals were resistant to cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II), melphalan, and chlorambucil. Furthermore, cells transfected with bovine papilloma virus expression vectors containing DNA encoding human metallothionein-IIA were resistant to cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II), melphalan, and chlorambucil but not to 5-fluorouracil or vincristine. Thus, overexpression of metallothionein represents one mechanism of resistance to a subset of clinically important anticancer drugs."
https://openalex.org/W1968721939,"Homicide is an extreme manifestation of interpersonal conflict with minimal reporting bias and can thus be used as a conflict ""assay."" Evolutionary models of social motives predict that genetic relationship will be associated with mitigation of conflict, and various analyses of homicide data support this prediction. Most ""family"" homicides are spousal homicides, fueled by male sexual proprietariness. In the case of parent-offspring conflict, an evolutionary model predicts variations in the risk of violence as a function of the ages, sexes, and other characteristics of protagonists, and these predictions are upheld in tests with data on infanticides, parricides, and filicides."
https://openalex.org/W2039729026,"In the adult mammalian visual system, ganglion cell axons from the two eyes are segregated from each other into separate layers within their principal target, the lateral geniculate nucleus. The involvement of spontaneously generated action potential activity in the process of segregation was investigated during the fetal period in which segregation normally occurs in the cat, between embryonic day 45 (E45) and birth (E65). Tetrodotoxin, which blocks the voltage-sensitive sodium channel, was used to prevent action potentials. Fetuses received continuous intracranial infusions of tetrodotoxin from osmotic minipumps implanted in utero on E42. After a 2-week infusion, intraocular injections of anterograde tracers revealed that tetrodotoxin prevented segregation. The contralateral projection filled the lateral geniculate nucleus uniformly, and the ipsilateral projection expanded to occupy most of what would normally be contralaterally innervated layer A. Thus, in the fetus, long before the onset of vision, spontaneous action potential activity is likely to be present in the visual system and to contribute to the segregation of the retinogeniculate pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2061574765,A large MERRF pedigree permitted the direct testing of the predictions for a mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutation. A mtDNA mutation was demonstrated by proving maternal inheritance and by identifying specific deficiencies in muscle energetics and mitochondrial respiratory complexes I and IV. mtDNA heteroplasmy (a mixture of mutant and wild-type mtDNAs) was demonstrated by showing variation in the mitochondrial energetic capacity between family members. The phenotypic consequences of differential tissue-specific reliance on mitochondrial ATP was shown by correlating individual respiratory deficiency with the nature and severity of patients' clinical manifestations. The observed spectrum of clinical manifestations resulting from this heteroplasmic mtDNA mutation implies that mtDNA disease may be much more prevalent than previously anticipated.
https://openalex.org/W1998621123,"An increase in the synthesis of heat shock proteins that is induced in cells in vitro by hyperthermia or other types of metabolic stress correlates with enhanced cell survival upon further stress. To determine if a similar increase in stress tolerance could be elicited in vivo, rats were made hyperthermic, and then their retinas were tested for sensitivity to light damage. This treatment resulted in a marked decrease in photoreceptor degeneration after exposure to bright light as compared to normothermic animals. Concomitant with such protection was an increase in retinal synthesis of three heat shock proteins. Thus, a physiological rise in body temperature enhances the stress tolerance of nerve tissue, perhaps by increasing heat shock protein production."
https://openalex.org/W2072244168,The existence of spontaneous neural activity in mammalian retinal ganglion cells during prenatal life has long been suspected. This activity could play a key role in the refinement of retinal projections during development. Recordings in vivo from the retinas of rat fetuses between embryonic day 17 and 21 found action potentials in spontaneously active ganglion cells at all the ages studied.
https://openalex.org/W2052878543,"Structural changes of the human retinoblastoma gene have been demonstrated previously in retinoblastoma and some clinically related tumors including osteosarcoma. Structural aberrations of the retinoblastoma locus (RB1) were observed in 25% of breast tumor cell lines studied and 7% of the primary tumors. These changes include homozygous internal deletions and total deletion of RB1; a duplication of an exon was observed in one of the cell lines. In all cases, structural changes either resulted in the absence or truncation of the RB1 transcript. No obvious defect in RB1 was detected by DNA blot analysis in primary tumors or cell lines from Wilms' tumor, cervical carcinoma, or hepatoma. These results further support the concept that the human RB1 gene has pleiotropic effects on specific types of cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2008561915,"The disease xeroderma pigmentosum is characterized by deficient repair of damaged DNA. Fusions of cells from different patients have defined nine genetic complementation groups (A through I), implying that DNA repair in humans involves multiple gene products. In this report, an extension of the gel electrophoresis binding assay was used to identify at least one nuclear factor that (i) bound to DNA damaged by ultraviolet radiation or the antitumor drug cisplatin, but (ii) was notably absent in cells from complementation group E. Therefore, the factor appears to participate in a versatile DNA repair pathway at the stage of binding and recognition."
https://openalex.org/W2089632065,"undulated (un) homozygous mice exhibit vertebral malformations along the entire rostro-caudal axis. Pax 1, a murine paired box-containing gene, is expressed in ventral sclerotome cells and later in intervertebral disks along the entire vertebral column. We localized the Pax 1 gene on chromosome 2 between Î²2-microglobulin and the agouti locus to an area where un maps. DNA analysis of the un mutant revealed a point mutation in a highly conserved part of the paired box of Pax 1, leading to a Gly-Ser replacement. The chromosomal location and the mutation in the paired box of un mice in conjunction with Pax 1 gene expression in wild-type mice implicate a causative role of Pax 1 in generation of the vertebral column."
https://openalex.org/W1976354375,"Risk assessment is commonly seen as the domain of physical and biological sciences, with social scientists focusing instead on risk management and communication. This division is unnecessary, and it may lead to errors in risk assessments. Social science input is needed for more accurate calculations of risk consequences and probabilities and for identifying potential biases created by certain risk assessment procedures, as well as in analyzing and explaining public responses to risk. Findings, moreover, suggest that the dichotomy between ""real"" and ""perceived"" risk is less ""real"" than is often assumed, particularly in cases involving controversial technologies."
https://openalex.org/W1988433137,"Retinoblastoma (RB) is a malignant tumor of developing retina that arises when abnormalities resulting in loss of function affect both alleles of the gene at the retinoblastoma locus (RB1) on chromosome 13q. The majority of RB tumors do not show gross alterations in a 4.7-kb fragment (4.7R), which is a candidate RB1 gene. To search for more subtle mutations, the ribonuclease protection method was used to analyze 4.7R messenger RNA from RB tumors. Five of 11 RB tumors, which exhibit normal 4.7R DNA and normal-sized RNA transcripts, showed abnormal ribonuclease cleavage patterns. Three of the five mutations affected the same region of the messenger RNA, consistent with an effect on splicing involving an as yet unidentified 5' exon. The high frequency of mutations in 4.7R supports the identification of 4.7R as the RB1 gene. However, the unusual nature of some of the abnormalities of 4.7 R alleles indicates that the accepted sequence of genetic events involved in the genesis of RB may require reevaluation."
https://openalex.org/W1971111760,"Adhesion of blood cells to endothelial cells is an essential component of all inflammatory responses. The capacity of the endothelium to support adhesion of neutrophils is increased by cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-Î±, interleukin-1, and endotoxin. Another cytokine, transforming growth factor-Î² (TGF-Î²), was a strong inhibitor of basalneutrophil adhesion and also decreased the adhesive response of endothelial cells to tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±). The ability of cells to respond to TGF-Î² was related to the duration of culture of endothelial cells after explantation from umbilical veins. TGF-Î² is likely to serve an anti-inflammatory role at sites of blood vessel injury undergoing active endothelial regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2142466677,"Two hepatocellular carcinomas, induced in woodchucks chronically infected with woodchuck hepatitis virus, were characterized for viral integration near c-myc and alterations of c-myc expression. In one tumor, viral integration within the untranslated region of c-myc exon 3 resulted in overexpression of a long c-myc viral cotranscript. In the second tumor, a single insertion of highly rearranged viral sequences 600 bp upstream of c-myc exon 1 was associated with increased levels of normal c-myc mRNA. In both cases, viral enhancer insertion and disruption of normal c-myc transcriptional or posttranscriptional control appear to be involved in c-myc activation. These results demonstrate that integration of woodchuck hepatitis virus near a cellular proto-oncogene, as in several retroviral models, can contribute to the genesis of liver tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2089111392,"The promoter of a Xenopus tropicalis U6 gene can be transcribed by both RNA polymerases II and III. Two distinct elements, a TATA-like sequence and the region of transcription initiation, are only required for transcription by RNA polymerase III, while further common elements are required for transcription by both polymerases. Based on the unusually stringent requirement for a purine at the normal position of polymerase III transcription initiation and on the properties of mutants in this region, we suggest that RNA polymerase III itself may recognize the site of transcription initiation and thus be directly involved in efficient promoter selection. We have used the information obtained on U6 promoter structure to manufacture a U6 promoter that is RNA polymerase II-specific and to change the Xenopus U2 gene promoter specificity from RNA polymerase II to RNA polymerase III."

https://openalex.org/W2007579152,"Computer algorithms have been developed for several early vision processes, such as edge detection, stereopsis, motion, texture, and color, that give separate cues to the distance from the viewer of three-dimensional surfaces, their shape, and their material properties. Not surprisingly, biological vision systems still greatly outperform computer vision programs. One of the keys to the reliability, flexibility, and robustness of biological vision systems is their ability to integrate several visual cues. A computational technique for integrating different visual cues has now been developed and implemented with encouraging results on a parallel supercomputer."
https://openalex.org/W1592797175,"Kinins in the ascitic fluid from a patient with gastric cancer were purified by gel filtration and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Two fractions (fractions I and II) showed kinin activity. Fraction I did not correspond to either bradykinin or other known kinins, whereas fraction II corresponded to bradykinin. Fraction I contained 8 amino acid residues from bradykinin minus 1 proline plus 1 additional hydroxyproline. Sequence analysis of fraction I showed that the proline at the third amino acid residue of bradykinin was replaced by hydroxyproline. The retention time of fraction I on reversed-phase HPLC was exactly the same as that of synthetic [hydroxyprolyl3]bradykinin (Arg-Pro-Hyp-Gly-Phe-Ser-Pro-Phe-Arg) and was distinguishable from des-Pro3-bradykinin. Thus, these results demonstrate for the first time the presence of [hydroxyprolyl3]bradykinin in vivo. This is also the first report of the presence of bradykinin in human tumor ascites."
https://openalex.org/W2038045503,"Different mutations in the sqt-1 gene of C. elegans can lengthen, shorten, or helically twist the entire animal. We have cloned the sqt-1 gene and have shown that it encodes a collagen. sqt-1 was localized to a 35 kb region of DNA by physical mapping of chromosomal deficiencies. A transposon (Tc1)-induced mutation of sqt-1 was generated and utilized to identify the sqt-1 gene within this 35 kb region. Sequence analysis of the sqt-1 gene shows that it encodes a 32 kd collagen polypeptide that is similar in size and structure to other members of the C. elegans collagen family. The Tc1 insertion mutant has no detectable sqt-1 transcripts, yet it is morphologically normal, indicating that the null phenotype of sqt-1 is wild type. These results demonstrate that collagen mutations can have dramatic effects on organismal morphology."
https://openalex.org/W1542114776,"lambda gt11 cDNA libraries were constructed with poly(A)+ RNA preparations from both porphyric chicken and rat livers. A cDNA which encodes chicken hepatic delta-aminolevulinate synthase was cloned by screening with an anti-chicken liver delta-aminolevulinate synthase antibody. Using this cDNA as a probe, cDNAs encoding the entire protein coding sequence of rat hepatic delta-aminolevulinate synthase were then cloned. The complete nucleotide sequences of the cDNAs have been determined. The result predicts that the rat hepatic pre-delta-aminolevulinate synthase comprises 642 amino acids. We measured the half-life of the hepatic delta-aminolevulinate synthase mRNA by RNA blot hybridization analysis using allylisopropylacetamide-induced porphyric rats as an experimental model and the rat cDNA as a hybridization probe. The half-life of the mRNA determined by the injection of alpha-amanitin is as short as 20 min. This value is significantly shorter than the estimated half-lives of most other mRNAs in the differentiated tissues of animals. The effect of hemin administration on the level of hepatic delta-amino-levulinate synthase mRNA was also examined. The half-disappearance time of the mRNA after the hemin administration was essentially the same as that determined by alpha-amanitin or actinomycin D, and no additive effect was observed between alpha-amanitin and hemin on the half-life determination. The results provide convincing evidence that heme inhibits the transcription of delta-aminolevulinate synthase mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1580450276,"Abstract A study is made of the effect of GSH as a co-antioxidant with vitamin E during free radical chain autoxidation inhibition studies of dilinoleoylphosphatidylcholine (DLPC) liposomes. Oxidations are initiated in the aqueous phase with azobis(2-amidinopropane hydrochloride) and in the bilayer phase of DLPC with azobis(2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile) under known conditions of the rate of free radical chain initiation (Ri). In reactions initiated in the aqueous phase, GSH is not an efficient antioxidant when acting alone; however, in cooperation with vitamin E in the bilayers, it does effect significant extensions of the efficient induction period of vitamin E. Quantitative studies show that GSH 0.4 molecules of vitamin E in the bilayer/molecule of GSH and therefore terminates approximately 0.8 peroxyl radical chains as a co-antioxidant with vitamin E. In contrast, GSH is not an effective co-antioxidant with an efficient water-soluble antioxidant, 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylate (Trolox). GSH spares only 0.08 molecules of Trolox/molecule of GSH during autoxidation initiated in the aqueous phase with azobis(2-amidinopropane hydrochloride). The inhibition rate constant for GSH in trapping aqueous phase peroxyls is at least an order of magnitude less than that of Trolox. When peroxidation is initiated in the bilayer phase of DLPC with azobis(2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile), GSH is not an effective co-antioxidant with either vitamin E in the bilayer or Trolox in the water. Comparatively higher ratios of GSH to E (GSH/E = 50) or Trolox (GSH/Trolox = 30) are required to give significant extensions of the E or Trolox induction periods. GSH is estimated to preserve only approximately one vitamin E or Trolox molecule for a hundred GSH for peroxidations initiated in the DLPC bilayers. From the kinetic studies and GSH decay studies during inhibition periods, it is concluded that GSH does not act synergistically by regenerating ArOH from the phenoxyl, ArO, radical of vitamin E or Trolox. The mode of antioxidant action of GSH is concluded to be that of trapping peroxyl radicals in the aqueous phase and thereby indirectly sparing vitamin E in the bilayer."
https://openalex.org/W1570727420,"We have investigated the carbohydrate-binding specificity of a mammalian lectin, calf heart agglutinin, by determining the interaction of the immobilized lectin with a variety of complex-type Asn-linked oligosaccharides. Our results demonstrate that calf-heart agglutinin binds with high affinity to oligosaccharides containing the repeating disaccharide (3Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc beta 1)n or poly-N-acetyllactosamine sequence and that the presence of terminal beta-linked galactosyl residues is neither sufficient nor necessary for high affinity interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2065572126,"Restriction of maternal dietary sodium on or before embryonic day 8 reduced taste responses of the chorda tympani nerve to sodium chloride in the offspring. The response attenuation was substantial; responses to sodium chloride in the offspring of deprived rats were approximately 40 percent of those in control animals. Instituting the low sodium diet at embryonic day 10 or later did not produce functional changes. Thus, a sensitive period for the gustatory system exists, and the abrupt transition from maximal environmental susceptibility to no susceptibility occurs during a 2-day prenatal period. Moreover, events important in determining the developmental fate of taste membrane components occur before the initial formation of taste buds."
https://openalex.org/W2007597735,"To investigate the mechanism by which the purified Xenopus tRNA splicing endonuclease recognizes its splice sites, we utilized yeast pre-tRNA(3Leu) and pre-tRNA(Phe) variants constructed by in vitro mutagenesis. We found that the endonuclease interacts with conserved features of the mature tRNA domain. In particular, U8 and C56 may be examples of contact points between protein and RNA. Given that there are no conserved sequences at the splice junctions, the specificity of cutting at both splice sites is determined by the length of the anticodon stem. Although in general, the sequence of the intron is unimportant for splicing, there are some structural requirements."
https://openalex.org/W2023323483,"Fetal injury associated with maternal ethanol ingestion is a major cause of congenital anomalies and mental retardation. Studies with animals suggest that acetaldehyde, the primary hepatic oxidative metabolite of ethanol, may contribute to fetal damage. It is not known, however, whether acetaldehyde reaches the human fetus, either by placental production or transfer. Studies utilizing the perfused human placental cotyledon show that the human placenta oxidizes ethanol to acetaldehyde, releasing it into the fetal perfusate. Moreover, when acetaldehyde is present in the maternal perfusate, it is transferred to the fetal side, reaching approximately 50 percent of the maternal level. These findings suggest that the human placenta may play a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of ethanol-associated fetal injury."
https://openalex.org/W2115621608,"The translational diffusion of wild-type and underglycosylated molecules of a membrane-integral glycoprotein the Ld class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigen has been measured. The Ld mutant molecules, which lack one or more glycosylation sites, had larger translational diffusion coefficients, D, than did wild-type Ld molecules glycosylated at three sites. The increase in D is linear with loss of glycosylation. The highest value of D approaches that for translational diffusion of molecules constrained only by viscosity of the membrane lipid bilayer. These results indicate that the external portions of cell surface glycoproteins interact significantly with other nearby molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2116441002,"There is increasing evidence that the use of cocaine can trigger lethal cardiac events, including ventricular fibrillation. The mechanism responsible for these lethal cardiac arrhythmias remains to be determined. Therefore, 13 mongrel dogs were instrumented so that heart rate, left ventricular pressure (LVP), and d(LVP)/dt could be measured. After a 3- to 4-wk recovery period, the left circumflex coronary artery was occluded for 2 min, beginning with the last minute of an exercise stress test and continuing for 1 min after the cessation of exercise. None of the dogs developed cardiac arrhythmias during the control exercise plus ischemia test. On a subsequent day, the test was repeated after the injection of cocaine HCl (1.0 mg/kg). Cocaine significantly (P less than 0.01) elevated heart rate, systolic LVP, and d(LVP)/dt, and it elicited cardiac arrhythmias in 12 of the 13 animals during the exercise plus test. In fact, 11 animals developed ventricular fibrillation. Verapamil, a calcium channel antagonist (250 micrograms/kg), attenuated the hemodynamic effects of cocaine and prevented the development of ventricular arrhythmias. These data suggest that cocaine can induce ventricular fibrillation during myocardial ischemia and that these lethal arrhythmias may be prevented by a calcium channel antagonist."
https://openalex.org/W1514812844,"In order to understand how subtle variations in lipid structure can influence the stability of an integral membrane protein, the purified, delipidated anion transport domain of human erythrocyte band 3 was reconstituted into a series of well-defined lipids and examined by differential scanning calorimetry. From the calorimetric scans, plots of denaturation temperature (Tm), enthalpy (delta Hd), and heat capacity (delta Cdp) as a function of phospholipid chain length, degree of unsaturation, headgroup type, and cholesterol content were constructed. The data show that the stability of the 55,000-dalton membrane-spanning domain of band 3 is exquisitely sensitive to the acyl chain length of its phospholipid environment, increasing almost linearly from a Tm of 47 degrees C in dimyristoleylphosphatidylcholine (C14:1) to 66 degrees C in dinervonylphosphatidylcholine (C24:1). The integral domain was also found to be significantly stabilized by increasing the degree of saturation of the fatty acyl chains and by elevating the cholesterol content of the membrane. Although band 3 was native in all reconstituted lipid systems, the transport protein's stability was clearly much greater in zwitterionic lipids (phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine) than anionic lipids (phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylglycerol). Enthalpy and delta Cdp values were generally within the ranges expected of globular proteins in the various reconstituted systems, except the values for the anionic and polyunsaturated phospholipids were anomalously low. Much of the data can be accounted for by the hypothesis that band 3 has a long hydrophobic cross-section and that a close match between the hydrophobic zone of the membrane-spanning protein and the nonpolar region of the bilayer is necessary for maximum protein stability. Because the integral domain of band 3 may be structurally representative of a larger group of transport proteins, the data should be useful in interpreting structural observations on protein-lipid interactions in other membrane systems."
https://openalex.org/W1630357099,"An unusual monomeric cGMP-dependent protein kinase, enriched in cilia, was isolated from Paramecium cilia and whole cells. Cilia and whole cell extracts had relatively high ratios of cGMP-dependent to cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity (1:2). The calculated molecular weight of the native enzyme was 88,000. The enzyme was identified on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels as a 77,000 molecular weight band based on copurification of this protein with enzyme activity, 8-N3-[32P]cAMP labeling, and autophosphorylation. Based on the size of the native enzyme, it was concluded that the kinase is a monomer with cGMP-binding and catalytic activities on the same polypeptide. Dimer-sized cGMP-dependent protein kinase, like that of the well characterized mammalian enzyme, was never seen, despite stringent efforts to control proteolysis. The structure of the Paramecium cGMP-dependent protein kinase supports a model in which the dimeric vertebrate form of the enzyme evolved from an early monomeric form. The catalytic properties of the Paramecium enzyme differed in several respects from those of the mammalian enzyme: it could use GTP or ATP as the phosphoryl donor, it did not phosphorylate Kemptide effectively, and it had poor histone kinase activity with high Mg2+ concentrations. Quercertin, 5'-guanylyl imidodiphosphate, indomethacin, and the isoquinolinesulfonamide drug H7 inhibited Paramecium cGMP-dependent protein kinase activity. The enzyme had fast and slow binding sites (with kd values of 5-10 x 10(-3)s-1 and 0.44 x 10(-3)s-1) and showed an order of preference for cyclic nucleotides and cyclic nucleotide analogs similar to that of the mammalian enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1508018835,"A guanine nucleotide-dependent protein carboxyl methylation is demonstrated in mammalian cell membranes. The methylation of membrane proteins of Mr 20,000-23,000 requires S-adenosylmethionine, GTP or nonhydrolyzable GTP analogs, and a cytoplasmic methyltransferase. The protein methyl groups are stable at neutral pH and under basic conditions hydrolyze to produce methanol. The specific methyl acceptor proteins and methyltransferases varied between tissues and cell types, suggesting that these methylations have cell-specific functions. The guanine nucleotide-dependent carboxyl methylations provide a possible mechanism for regulating the function of GTP-binding membrane proteins in the transduction of receptor-mediated signals of eukaryotic cells."
https://openalex.org/W2146346647,"The major ribonuclease of human liver has been isolated in a four-step procedure. The protein appears homogeneous by several criteria. The amino acid composition and the amino-terminal sequence of the enzyme indicate that the protein is related to human pancreatic ribonuclease and to angiogenin, and that it may be identical with an eosinophil-derived neurotoxin and to a ribonuclease that has been isolated from urine. The catalytic activity of the liver ribonuclease and its sensitivity to iodoacetic acid inactivation also relate the enzyme to the pancreatic RNases, but the liver protein is clearly differentiated by immunological measurements. Antibodies to the liver ribonuclease inhibit its activity, but not that of the human pancreatic enzyme; cross-reactivity in a radioimmunological assay is small but measurable. Immunochemical measurements have been used to examine the distribution of the liver-type protein in other tissues. Inhibition of enzyme activity by anti-liver ribonuclease shows that a cross-reactive enzyme is predominant in extracts of spleen and is a significant component in kidney preparations, while the liver-type protein is almost absent in brain or pancreas homogenates. Cross-reactive ribonuclease is present in serum, but levels are not correlated with any of the disease states examined."
https://openalex.org/W1506904792,"CO dehydrogenase, a key enzyme of the acetyl-CoA pathway of autotrophic growth, has been methylated using 14CH3I or 14CH3-corrinoid enzyme plus ferredoxin. Acetyl-CoA was synthesized from the resulting 14CH3-CO dehydrogenase, CO, and CoASH, with about 50% yield of the available 14C and without addition of other enzymes except CO dehydrogenase disulfide reductase. Even the reductase could be replaced by dithioerythritol. Amino acid analysis of the 14CH3-CO dehydrogenase showed two radioactive peaks, one of which migrated as S-methylcysteine but very close to the methyl ester of glutamic acid. By oxidation with H2O2, the radioactive component of this peak was identified as S-methylcysteine sulfone. Amino acid analysis of the 14CH3-CO dehydrogenase after synthesis of acetyl-CoA demonstrated that there was a large decrease in radioactivity of the peak containing the S-methyl-cysteine. The compound present in the second peak has not been identified; there was no decrease in its radioactivity. By nonreducing gel electrophoresis of the 14CH3-CO dehydrogenase, followed by autoradiography, it was shown that the beta subunit is the methyl acceptor. These results demonstrate that a cysteine of the beta subunit is the methyl acceptor and that CO dehydrogenase per se catalyzes the synthesis of acetyl-CoA."
https://openalex.org/W1583244898,"1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3) induces monocytic differentiation of the human promyelocytic leukemia line, HL-60, and enhances Ca2+ transport in target cells of the mineral metabolism system. Hence, we determined whether the steroid's maturational effect on HL-60 involves alterations of intracellular calcium [(Ca2+]i). We found that, as detected by indo-1 fluorescence, [Ca2+]i increases in a slow tonic manner from 99 +/- 11 nM in virgin HL-60 to 182 +/- 19 nM (p less than 0.001) in those treated with 1,25-(OH)2D3 for 24 h. The first apparent rise in [Ca2+]i occurs at between 6 and 12 h and parallels expression of alpha-thrombin and N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) receptors. This increase in [Ca2+]i is derived from extracellular calcium as its reduction abolishes the effect. The increase in [Ca2+]i is associated with an increase in inositol trisphosphate-stimulated Ca2+ flux from intracellular stores. Interestingly, 1,25-(OH)2D3-mediated HL-60 differentiation as manifest by expression of the macrophage-specific antigen, 63D3, is not blocked by low extracellular calcium. In contrast, the fMLP-induced superoxide ion generation is diminished if the increase in [Ca2+]i is prevented. Furthermore, fMLP-stimulated signal transduction is also reduced by limiting the stimulation of [Ca2+]i during 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment. Thus, although differentiation of HL-60 to the monocytic phenotype by 1,25-(OH)2D3 is Ca2+-independent, expression of response to regulatory stimuli requires priming of cellular Ca2+ stores. The latter appears to be induced by 1,25-(OH)2D3 via stimulated Ca2+ entry through the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2048120189,"Numerous human learning phenomena have been observed and captured by individual laws, but no unified theory of learning has succeeded in accounting for these observations. A theory and model are proposed that account for two of these phenomena: the power law of practice and the problem-solving fan-effect. The power law of practice states that the speed of performance of a task will improve as a power of the number of times that the task is performed. The power law resulting from two sorts of problem-solving changes, addition of operators to the problem-space graph and alterations in the decision procedure used to decide which operator to apply at a particular state, is empirically demonstrated. The model provides an analytic account for both of these sources of the power law. The model also predicts a problem-solving fan-effect, slowdown during practice caused by an increase in the difficulty of making useful decisions between possible paths, which is also found empirically."
https://openalex.org/W1588864704,"U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA), an essential component of the eukaryotic spliceosomes, is unique in that it is synthesized by RNA polymerase III, while all other U-snRNAs are synthesized by RNA polymerase II. U6 genes are notable for functional upstream regulatory elements which resemble RNA polymerase II regulatory sequence motifs. In this study, the optimal conditions for transcription of the U6 snRNA gene in vitro were found to be similar to conditions optimal for transcription of 5S RNA genes. To purify the trans-acting factors necessary for the transcription of the U6 RNA gene, HeLa cell extracts were fractionated on a DEAE-Sephadex column, and three fractions, designated DE-50, DE-175, and DE-500, were obtained by stepwise elution with 50, 175, and 500 mM ammonium sulfate, respectively. DE-175 fraction transcribed tRNA and 5S RNA genes but not a mouse U6 RNA gene. Complementation of the DE-175 fraction with the DE-50 fraction resulted in the transcription of the U6 RNA gene. Experiments in which the transcription factor (TFIIIA) was selectively inactivated indicated that TFIIIA is not required for the transcription of the U6 RNA gene. These results show that the U6 snRNA gene, although transcribed by RNA polymerase III, differs from tRNA and 5S RNA genes in that factors other than TFIIIA, -IIIB, and -IIIC are required for U6 gene transcription in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1587853732,"Chicken liver fatty acid synthase is cleaved by kallikrein into polypeptides ranging in molecular weight from 10,000 to 100,000. Fractionation of the digest by ammonium sulfate and chromatography on a Matrix Red A affinity column resulted in the isolation of a polypeptide (Mr = 26,000) containing the beta-hydroxyacyl dehydratase activity, but no other partial activities normally associated with the fatty acid synthase. The specific activity of the dehydratase increased 9 to 12 times in this fraction, an increase that is within the expected range based on relative molecular weight. Kinetic parameters of the purified dehydratase toward the model substrate, crotonyl-CoA, showed no change in apparent Km values and a 12-fold increase in Vmax values as compared to dehydratase activity of the intact synthase. However, the purified fragment did not catalyze the hydration of the crotonyl-N-acetylcysteamine derivative, a substrate that is readily hydrated by the intact synthase. Antibodies against the purified 26-kDa fragment cross-react with the intact synthase and the hydratase-containing fragments produced at all stages of digestion with kallikrein or trypsin as shown by Western blot analyses. The results show that the beta-hydroxyl dehydratase activity of the fatty acid synthase is located in the reduction Domain II (Tsukamoto, Y., Wong, H., Mattick, J. S., and Wakil, S. J. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 15312-15322) of the synthase subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1537704303,"Parent B16 melanoma and B16-F1 cell lines express a third actin (Ax) in addition to beta- and gamma-actin. It has the same molecular mass (43,000 daltons) and a more acidic isoelectric point (pI = 5.2) than the latter two actins (pI = 5.3) (Taniguchi, S., Kawano, T., Kakunaga, T., and Baba, T. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 6100-6106). We constructed a cDNA library from poly(A)+ RNA of B16-F1 and then isolated Ax actin candidate clones. According to the nucleotide sequencing analysis for one of the candidate clones, pMA 30, the predicted amino acid sequence was composed of 375 amino acids and was similar to that of beta-actin, but differed at the 28th amino acid in that leucine replaced the arginine of beta-actin. When RNA synthesized from the clone pMA 30 with the SP6 transcription system was translated in vitro using reticulocyte lysate, we identified a polypeptide which had the same isoelectric point and molecular weight as Ax actin; the polypeptide had binding activity to DNase I, a common characteristic of native actin. These observations provide evidence that the clone pMA 30 encodes the mRNA for Ax actin. In the nucleotide sequence of the Ax cDNA, there are: 1) one base change in the coding region which causes a loss of the SmaI site and an amino acid exchange, as mentioned above; 2) four deletion sites in the 3'-noncoding region; 3) one insertion site in the 3'-noncoding region; and 4) one base change in the 5'-noncoding region, as compared with hitherto known mouse beta-actin cDNA. These differences between Ax and beta-actin cDNA indicate that the Ax actin is encoded by an unique gene set, independent of beta-actin."
https://openalex.org/W2109232075,"We have obtained oxygen-17 (17O) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of C17O ligands bound to ferrous horseradish peroxidase isozyme A, isozyme C, and ferrous chloroperoxidase, as a function of pH. Our results show that the peroxidases exist in two distinct states, the acidic and alkaline forms, which undergo reversible acid-base-induced transitions characterized by a single pK value. The two forms are characterized spectroscopically in much the same way in all three proteins, suggesting a similar structural origin for the transition process. In particular, the 17O NMR signal of the acidic form is approximately 7 ppm more shielded than that of the alkaline form, and the CO ligand in the acidic form appears to have a smaller 17O nuclear quadrupole coupling constant than that of the alkaline form. We have also obtained the pK values and exchange rates for all three peroxidases. The results indicate that a similar structural change may be involved in the transition process in all three peroxidases."
https://openalex.org/W1602780943,"We describe the in vitro expression and characterization of the isolated beta-tubulin subunit in rabbit reticulocyte lysates and compare its assembly and chromatographic properties with that of the isolated alpha-subunit and the tubulin heterodimer. The beta-tubulin polypeptides, derived from a single chicken beta-tubulin cDNA, were found in three distinct molecular forms: a multimeric or lysate-associated form, beta I (Mr approximately 180,000); the free beta-subunit beta II (Mr approximately 55,000); and the hybrid heterodimer alpha(rabbit) beta(chick), beta III (Mr approximately 80,000-100,000). The hybrid heterodimers were 100% assembly competent, whereas beta-tubulin in the associated beta I and the monomeric beta II forms displayed only approximately 70 +/- 15 and 25 +/- 10% competence, respectively, in coassembly assays with bovine brain tubulin. This reduced functionality was not a consequence of diminished beta-subunit stability or protein denaturation. By comparing the elution positions of the three beta forms, the monomeric alpha-subunit, and tubulin dimer purified from bovine brain, we demonstrate that anion-exchange columns (Mono-Q) interact preferentially with the alpha-subunit and chromatograph tubulin dimer on the basis of alpha-subunit isotype. The rate of exchange of the free beta-subunit into bovine tubulin dimer was followed chromatographically. The exchange was slow at 4 degrees C and rapid at 37 degrees C where it is essentially complete in 40 min in the presence of 2.5 mg/ml bovine microtubule protein. Exogenous GTP, a potent effector of microtubule assembly, binds exchangeably to beta II and enhances the recovery of this form from the Mono-Q column, suggesting that GTP binding may occur at identical sites in the isolated beta-subunit and in the tubulin heterodimer."
https://openalex.org/W1489176363,"Abstract The role of osmotic pressure in the exocytosis of prolactin from rat pituitary tumor (GH) cells in culture was investigated. Reducing the osmotic strength of the medium from 300 mosm to 150 mosm by removal of NaCl did not alter basal secretion of prolactin but inhibited secretion stimulated by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and forskolin. Both basal and stimulated secretion of prolactin were inhibited by increasing the osmotic strength of the medium with NaCl (IC50 at approximately 500 mosm). The stimulated release of hormone from GH-cells was independent of sodium and unaffected by replacement of sodium ion with tetramethylammonium or choline, or by addition of 500 nM tetrodotoxin. Secretagogue-stimulated release was, however, dependent upon chloride. Exchange of medium chloride with benzoate or isethionate significantly inhibited the stimulated release of prolactin (IC50 at approximately 60 mM exchange) regardless of the secretagogue utilized (phorbol ester, forskolin, depolarization plus BAY K8644, or TRH). Exchange of medium chloride with either isethionate or benzoate reduced cell volume by 10% compared to 60% for sucrose and mannitol, suggesting that inhibition of secretion by isethionate exchange was not a result of increased intracellular osmotic pressure. Complete exchange of medium chloride with isethionate did not alter equilibrium [3H]methyl-TRH binding, resting internal [Ca2+], or the [Ca2+]i response to depolarization and TRH as measured with intracellularly trapped Fura 2. Chloride removal did not change resting internal pH and recovery from an acid load as measured by the intracellular pH-sensitive dye 2',7'-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein. The stimulated secretion of prolactin was also inhibited by exchange of chloride with isethionate in normal pituitary cells in primary culture and the ability of normal cells to respond to the dopamine agonist bromocryptine was not affected by the exchange. These results suggest that exocytosis of prolactin from GH-cells and normal pituitary cells in culture is an osmotically driven process that is chloride-dependent. Stimulated release is more chloride-dependent than constitutive release. The inhibitory effect of isethionate substitution occurs after signal transduction and is distinct from the site of dopamine inhibition of prolactin release."
https://openalex.org/W1531821087,"The intracellular site of incorporation and degradation of heme and globin moiety of hemoglobin-haptoglobin in rat liver cells was investigated in vivo. Hemoglobin-haptoglobin, administered intravenously to rats, is cleared from the circulation and incorporated exclusively into liver parenchymal cells through the receptor specific for the molecule (Kino, K., Tsunoo, H., Higa, Y., Takami, M., Hamaguchi, H., and Nakajima, H. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 9616-9620). Intracellular distribution of radioactivity was determined after intravenous administration of [3H-Heme,14C-Globin]hemoglobin-haptoglobin to rats. The doubly labeled hemoglobin-haptoglobin was incorporated first in organelles of lower anodic mobility in carrier-free electrophoresis and of low density (density range, 1.05-1.07 g/ml) in Percoll density gradient centrifugation recovered in Golgi subfractions of the liver cells in a substantially intact form. In the subsequent stages, these organelles progressively acquired a higher anodic mobility as well as higher density, presumably through fusion with other organelles. In the resulting organelles of higher anodic mobility in electrophoresis and high density (density range, 1.07-1.15 g/ml) in Percoll, the hemoglobin-haptoglobin first dissociated symmetrically into two 82,000-dalton subunits having intact heme, and then the organelles containing only 3H radioactivity but no 14C radioactivity were separated by electrophoresis. Most of the 3H radioactive materials in these organelles are identified as intact [3H]heme. These investigations suggest that the heme moiety of hemoglobin-haptoglobin in the organelles is detached from globin-haptoglobin and binds to another carrier protein prior to conversion of heme to bilirubin."
https://openalex.org/W1740432990,"The human H1 histone gene FNC16 resides in a 2.7-kb EcoRI fragment present in a histone gene cluster that also contains one copy of each of the core (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) histone genes. The cap site for FNC16 H1 mRNA is located 58 nucleotides upstream of the ATG translational start codon, and S1 nuclease protection analysis clearly distinguishes between correctly initiated FNC16 transcripts and transcripts from other nonidentical H1 histone genes. We have observed, using S1 analysis, that the FNC16 H1 histone gene is expressed in a replication-dependent manner in HeLa cells and is expressed in proliferating, but down-regulated in differentiated, HL60 cells. Similar results were found in HeLa S3 and HL60 cells for the cell cycle-dependent human H4 histone gene FO108. Nuclear extracts derived from HeLa S3 cells are capable of directing FNC16 H1 histone gene transcription in vitro. This finding is consistent with previous work that established at least two sites for protein-DNA interaction in vitro in the proximal promoter region of this gene. We have observed a difference in the extent to which the FNC16 H1 histone gene is expressed in HeLa S3 and proliferating HL60 cells, which suggests that this H1 gene is differentially regulated in various cell types. Although results reported for a potentially identical human H1 histone gene designated Hh8C (LaBella, F., Zhong, R., and Heintz, N. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 2115-2118) support differential regulation of human H1 genes in various cell types, their observations that the Hh8C gene is not expressed in HeLa cells and that the restriction patterns differ indicate that FNC16 and Hh8C are different H1 genes."
https://openalex.org/W1487586266,"Abstract The gene encoding ribosomal protein S11 (Escherichia coli S15 homologue) from Halobacterium marismortui was cloned employing two synthetic oligonucleotide mixtures, 23 and 32 bases in length, as hybridization probes. The nucleotide sequence of the gene and the adjacent 5'- and 3'-flanking regions (1300 base pairs) were then determined by the dideoxy chain termination method. Comparison of the nucleotide sequence of the H. marismortui S11 gene with that of the E. coli S15 gene (rpsO) showed that the 3'-end of the S11 gene can be aligned with the entire E. coli S15 gene, sharing 44% identical nucleotides. It has been found that the S11 gene has a higher G + C content (G + C = 65%) than that of the E. coli S15 gene (G + C = 53%). This increase in G + C content specifically shows up as a preference for G + C in the 3rd position of the codon. Upstream of the S11 gene, an archaebacterial promoter sequence (GGACTTTCA) and a putative ribosomal binding site (GCGGT) have been found, 88 and 15 (or 24) base pairs from the initiation codon of the gene. In addition, an open reading frame could be identified immediately after the stop codon for the S11 gene. Northern blotting analysis using the S11 coding region as probe has shown that the S11 gene is located on a 2.4-kilobase mRNA, suggesting that it is cotranscribed with other downstream gene(s)."

https://openalex.org/W1545157621,"We have identified and partially characterized a complex transcriptional unit within the murine beta-glucuronidase gene complex on chromosome 5. On the same strand and within the first intron of the beta-glucuronidase structural gene, Gus-s, we observe an RNA polymerase II promoter motif. That sequences within this carefully defined region can promote RNA polymerase II transcription is supported by results of in vitro transcriptional runoff assays and by expression of a linked reporter gene in both cultured cells and transgenic mice. Results of RNA blot hybridization and S1 nuclease protection studies reveal a 2.2-kilobase processed liver transcript which is initiated just downstream of the promoter motif and sharing little, if any, sequence with the 2.7-kilobase beta-glucuronidase mRNA. Both RNA species are found in liver where beta-glucuronidase is known to be expressed in all cell types. To our knowledge, this is the first description of eukaryotic mRNAs from overlapping transcription units which share the same strand yet exhibit little, if any, sequence similarity. A possible regulatory relationship between these overlapping structural genes is discussed."
