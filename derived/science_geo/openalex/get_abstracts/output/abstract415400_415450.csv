While the size of the pores will influence which molecules are able to pass, other factors—including the surface chemistry of the pore walls, electrostatic interactions, and differences in solubility—can also affect the diffusion rates. There is also a trade-off between the thickness of the membrane regarding strength and permeation rates (see the Perspective by Paul ). Karan et al. (p. 444 ) fabricated membranes from amorphous carbon, which showed excellent strength and could be used for filtrations involving organic solvents. Nair et al. (p. 442 ) observed unusual behavior in graphene-based membranes which were able to prevent the diffusion of many small-molecule gases, including helium, but showed almost barrier-free movement of water."

https://openalex.org/W2041357218,"Several cell types have been proposed to create niches for haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). However, the expression patterns of HSC maintenance factors have not been systematically studied and no such factor has been conditionally deleted from any candidate niche cell. Thus, the cellular sources of these factors are undetermined. Stem cell factor (SCF; also known as KITL) is a key niche component that maintains HSCs. Here, using Scf(gfp) knock-in mice, we found that Scf was primarily expressed by perivascular cells throughout the bone marrow. HSC frequency and function were not affected when Scf was conditionally deleted from haematopoietic cells, osteoblasts, nestin-cre- or nestin-creER-expressing cells. However, HSCs were depleted from bone marrow when Scf was deleted from endothelial cells or leptin receptor (Lepr)-expressing perivascular stromal cells. Most HSCs were lost when Scf was deleted from both endothelial and Lepr-expressing perivascular cells. Thus, HSCs reside in a perivascular niche in which multiple cell types express factors that promote HSC maintenance."

These mutations are associated with the accumulation of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) in the tumor. Here we report the noninvasive detection of 2HG by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). We developed and optimized the pulse sequence with numerical and phantom analyses for 2HG detection, and we estimated the concentrations of 2HG using spectral fitting in the tumors of 30 subjects. Detection of 2HG correlated with mutations in IDH1 or IDH2 and with increased levels of D-2HG by mass spectrometry of the resected tumors. Noninvasive detection of 2HG may prove to be a valuable diagnostic and prognostic biomarker."

We identified 1331 total mutations, affecting more than 600 different sites. Few mutations were shared among replicates, but a strong pattern of convergence emerged at the level of genes, operons, and functional complexes. Our experiment uncovered a set of primary functional targets of high temperature, but we estimate that many other beneficial mutations could contribute to similar adaptive outcomes. We inferred the pervasive presence of epistasis among beneficial mutations, which shaped adaptive trajectories into at least two distinct pathways involving mutations either in the RNA polymerase complex or the termination factor rho."
https://openalex.org/W1999404512,"How fast can correlations spread in a quantum many-body system? Based on the seminal work by Lieb and Robinson, it has recently been shown that several interacting many-body systems exhibit an effective light cone that bounds the propagation speed of correlations. The existence of such a ""speed of light"" has profound implications for condensed matter physics and quantum information, but has never been observed experimentally. Here we report on the time-resolved detection of propagating correlations in an interacting quantum many-body system. By quenching a one-dimensional quantum gas in an optical lattice, we reveal how quasiparticle pairs transport correlations with a finite velocity across the system, resulting in an effective light cone for the quantum dynamics. Our results open important perspectives for understanding relaxation of closed quantum systems far from equilibrium as well as for engineering efficient quantum channels necessary for fast quantum computations."
https://openalex.org/W1966344422,"The social networks of Hadza hunter-gatherers are structurally similar to modern social networks and show signs of clustering in cooperative behaviour, which suggests that these networks may have contributed to the emergence of cooperation in early humans. The Hadza bushmen of northern Tanzania are almost totally cut off from the modern developed world, providing anthropologists with a useful model of an early hunter-gatherer society. A study of Hadza social networks, quantifying their ties to each other and their propensity to cooperate, shows that the main characteristics of modernized networks, such as transitivity and homophily, are observed in the Hadza. In addition, social ties are more likely between individuals with similar levels of public goods game donations, and Hadza camps exhibit high between-group and low within-group variation in cooperation. Taken together, these results provide the strongest evidence so far that these key features of human networks reflect shared ancestry and may have developed at an early point in human history. Social networks show striking structural regularities1,2, and both theory and evidence suggest that networks may have facilitated the development of large-scale cooperation in humans3,4,5,6,7. Here, we characterize the social networks of the Hadza, a population of hunter-gatherers in Tanzania8. We show that Hadza networks have important properties also seen in modernized social networks, including a skewed degree distribution, degree assortativity, transitivity, reciprocity, geographic decay and homophily. We demonstrate that Hadza camps exhibit high between-group and low within-group variation in public goods game donations. Network ties are also more likely between people who give the same amount, and the similarity in cooperative behaviour extends up to two degrees of separation. Social distance appears to be as important as genetic relatedness and physical proximity in explaining assortativity in cooperation. Our results suggest that certain elements of social network structure may have been present at an early point in human history. Also, early humans may have formed ties with both kin and non-kin, based in part on their tendency to cooperate. Social networks may thus have contributed to the emergence of cooperation."
https://openalex.org/W1984117161,"Life of Li Because lithium primarily exists in silicate minerals on continents, the variations of Li isotopes in marine sedimentary rocks reflect the degree of silicate weathering and formation of new sediments on the seafloor, which in turn are largely controlled by climate and tectonic forces over geologic time. By analyzing sedimentary cores from eight drill sites around the world's oceans, Misra and Froelich (p. 818 , published online 26 January; see the cover; see the Perspective by Paytan ) assembled a 68-million-year record of the Li isotope composition of seawater. The record reveals a stepwise change in the Li isotopic ratio, suggesting that several intense episodes of tectonic uplift increased continental weathering rates and delivery of sediments to the oceans. Abrupt swings in the record at specific points in Earth's history, for example, around the time when dinosaurs became extinct, imply major changes in ocean chemistry—but their mechanisms remain enigmatic."
https://openalex.org/W1982286661,"Natural Selection Caught in the Act Understanding how new functions evolve has been of long-standing interest. However, the number of mutations needed to evolve a key innovation is rarely known, or whether other sets of mutations would also suffice, whether the intermediate steps are driven by natural selection, or how contingent the outcome is on steps along the way. Meyer et al. (p. 428 ; see the Perspective by Thompson ) answer these questions for a case in which phage lambda evolved the ability to infect its host Escherichia coli through a novel receptor. This shift required four mutations, which accumulated under natural selection in concert with coevolution of the host. However, when Tenaillon et al. (p. 457 ) exposed 115 lines of E. coli to high temperature and sequenced them, adaptation occurred through many different genetic paths, showing parallelism at the level of genes and interacting protein complexes, but only rarely at the nucleotide level. Thus, epistasis—nonadditive genetic interaction—is likely to play an important part in the process of adaptation to this environment."

https://openalex.org/W2041345208,"TRAAK channels, members of the two-pore domain K(+) (potassium ion) channel family K2P, are expressed almost exclusively in the nervous system and control the resting membrane potential. Their gating is sensitive to polyunsaturated fatty acids, mechanical deformation of the membrane, and temperature changes. Physiologically, these channels appear to control the noxious input threshold for temperature and pressure sensitivity in dorsal root ganglia neurons. We present the crystal structure of human TRAAK at a resolution of 3.8 angstroms. The channel comprises two protomers, each containing two distinct pore domains, which create a two-fold symmetric K(+) channel. The extracellular surface features a helical cap, 35 angstroms tall, that creates a bifurcated pore entryway and accounts for the insensitivity of two-pore domain K(+) channels to inhibitory toxins. Two diagonally opposed gate-forming inner helices form membrane-interacting structures that may underlie this channel's sensitivity to chemical and mechanical properties of the cell membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2000520243,"The adult dentate gyrus generates new granule cells (GCs) that develop over several weeks and integrate into the preexisting network. Although adult hippocampal neurogenesis has been implicated in learning and memory, the specific role of new GCs remains unclear. We examined whether immature adult-born neurons contribute to information encoding. By combining calcium imaging and electrophysiology in acute slices, we found that weak afferent activity recruits few mature GCs while activating a substantial proportion of the immature neurons. These different activation thresholds are dictated by an enhanced excitation/inhibition balance transiently expressed in immature GCs. Immature GCs exhibit low input specificity that switches with time toward a highly specific responsiveness. Therefore, activity patterns entering the dentate gyrus can undergo differential decoding by a heterogeneous population of GCs originated at different times."

https://openalex.org/W2032297237,"We identified subsets of neurons in the brain that coexpress the dopamine receptor subtype-2 (DRD2) and the ghrelin receptor (GHSR1a). Combination of FRET confocal microscopy and Tr-FRET established the presence of GHSR1a:DRD2 heteromers in hypothalamic neurons. To interrogate function, mice were treated with the selective DRD2 agonist cabergoline, which produced anorexia in wild-type and ghrelin⁻/⁻ mice; intriguingly, ghsr⁻/⁻ mice were refractory illustrating dependence on GHSR1a, but not ghrelin. Elucidation of mechanism showed that formation of GHSR1a:DRD2 heteromers allosterically modifies canonical DRD2 dopamine signaling resulting in Gβγ subunit-dependent mobilization of [Ca²⁺](i) independent of GHSR1a basal activity. By targeting the interaction between GHSR1a and DRD2 in wild-type mice with a highly selective GHSR1a antagonist (JMV2959) cabergoline-induced anorexia was blocked. Inhibiting dopamine signaling in subsets of neurons with a GHSR1a antagonist has profound therapeutic implications by providing enhanced selectivity because neurons expressing DRD2 alone would be unaffected."
https://openalex.org/W2032443344,Potassium Permeation Two–pore domain potassium (K2P) channels conduct K + ions across the plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells. They help to maintain the cellular resting potential and their modulation can tune cellular excitability (see the Perspective by Poulsen and Nissen ). Miller and Long (p. 432 ) describe a high-resolution crystal structure of the human K2P channel K2P1 (TWIK-1) and Brohawn et al. (p. 436 ) present a high-resolution structure of the lipid and mechanosensitive human channel TRAAK. In both structures an extracellular domain constricts the channel entrance so that K + ions reach the selectivity filter through side portals. Openings in the transmembrane region expose the central cavity to the lipid bilayer and a helix is kinked so that its C-terminal part lies in the cytosol-membrane interface. The structural features explain K2P conductance and gating and give insight into how the channels are regulated by diverse stimuli.
https://openalex.org/W2046849514,"G-protein-coupled receptors are the largest class of cell-surface receptors, and these membrane proteins exist in equilibrium between inactive and active states. Conformational changes induced by extracellular ligands binding to G-protein-coupled receptors result in a cellular response through the activation of G proteins. The A(2A) adenosine receptor (A(2A)AR) is responsible for regulating blood flow to the cardiac muscle and is important in the regulation of glutamate and dopamine release in the brain. Here we report the raising of a mouse monoclonal antibody against human A(2A)AR that prevents agonist but not antagonist binding to the extracellular ligand-binding pocket, and describe the structure of A(2A)AR in complex with the antibody Fab fragment (Fab2838). This structure reveals that Fab2838 recognizes the intracellular surface of A(2A)AR and that its complementarity-determining region, CDR-H3, penetrates into the receptor. CDR-H3 is located in a similar position to the G-protein carboxy-terminal fragment in the active opsin structure and to CDR-3 of the nanobody in the active β(2)-adrenergic receptor structure, but locks A(2A)AR in an inactive conformation. These results suggest a new strategy to modulate the activity of G-protein-coupled receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2106046434,"A long-standing question in the study of long-term memory is how a memory trace persists for years when the proteins that initiated the process turn over and disappear within days. Previously, we postulated that self-sustaining amyloidogenic oligomers of cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein (CPEB) provide a mechanism for the maintenance of activity-dependent synaptic changes and, thus, the persistence of memory. Here, we found that the Drosophila CPEB Orb2 forms amyloid-like oligomers, and oligomers are enriched in the synaptic membrane fraction. Of the two protein isoforms of Orb2, the amyloid-like oligomer formation is dependent on the Orb2A form. A point mutation in the prion-like domain of Orb2A, which reduced amyloid-like oligomerization of Orb2, did not interfere with learning or memory persisting up to 24 hr. However the mutant flies failed to stabilize memory beyond 48 hr. These results support the idea that amyloid-like oligomers of neuronal CPEB are critical for the persistence of long-term memory.

Drosophila Orb2 forms amyloid-like oligomers Orb2 oligomerization increases upon neuronal stimulation Orb2 mutant with reduced oligomerization capacity fails to form stable long-term memory Learning changes the efficacy and number of synaptic connections. Memory is the maintenance of that altered state over time. Synaptic modification is likely to include both quantitative and qualitative changes in local protein composition. However, this model of memory raises a fundamental question that remains unanswered: how does the altered protein composition of a synapse persist for years when the molecules that initiated the process should disappear within days (Crick, 1984Crick F.

In Drosophila, reduction in Orb2, a member of the CPEB protein family, does not affect short-term memory (<3 hr) but does prevent the memories from persisting beyond 12 hr (Keleman et al., 2007Keleman K.

In mice, deletion of the CPEB-1 gene reduces long-term potentiation evoked by theta-burst stimulation (Alarcon et al., 2004Alarcon J.M. Hodgman R. Theis M. Huang Y.S. Kandel E.R. Richter J.D.

Neurosci. 2008; 28: 8502-8509Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Together, these observations suggest that CPEBs play a role in stabilizing activity-dependent changes in synaptic efficacy. However, how CPEB-dependent changes in molecular composition of the synapse persist over time is unknown. Previously, based on the self-sustaining amyloidogenic (prion-like) properties of Aplysia CPEB, we hypothesized that the activity-dependent conversion of CPEB to the amyloidogenic state provides a self-sustaining mechanism for the persistent change in molecular composition of the synapse and thereby persistence of memory (Heinrich and Lindquist, 2011Heinrich S.U. Lindquist S. Protein-only mechanism induces self-perpetuating changes in the activity of neuronal Aplysia cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein (CPEB).Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Aplysia CPEB can form prion-like multimers in sensory neurons that contribute to long-term facilitation.Cell. 2010; 140: 421-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Consistent with this idea, in Aplysia sensory neurons ApCPEB forms amyloidogenic aggregates when overexpressed, and the number of aggregates increases following stimulation with serotonin (Si et al., 2010Si K. Choi Y.B. White-Grindley E. Majumdar A. Kandel E.R. Aplysia CPEB can form prion-like multimers in sensory neurons that contribute to long-term facilitation.Cell. 2010; 140: 421-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Moreover, an antibody that recognizes oligomeric ApCPEB selectively blocks the persistence of long-term facilitation of the sensory-motor neuron synapse beyond 24 hr (Si et al., 2010Si K. Choi Y.B. White-Grindley E. Majumdar A. Kandel E.R. Aplysia CPEB can form prion-like multimers in sensory neurons that contribute to long-term facilitation.Cell. 2010; 140: 421-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). However, the central question of whether such conversion of neuronal CPEB to the amyloid-like state is necessary for the persistence of memory remains unanswered. To address the behavioral significance of the amyloid-like state of CPEB, we turned to Drosophila Orb2. Drosophila Orb2 protein carry a prion-like domain (Figure S1A available online) (Si et al., 2003bSi K. Lindquist S. Kandel E.R. A neuronal isoform of the aplysia CPEB has prion-like properties.Cell. 2003; 115: 879-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) and target synaptic growth-related proteins, suggesting that Orb2 is not only structurally but also functionally similar to ApCPEB (Mastushita-Sakai et al., 2010Mastushita-Sakai T. White-Grindley E. Samuelson J. Seidel C. Si K. Drosophila Orb2 targets genes involved in neuronal growth, synapse formation, and protein turnover.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 11987-11992Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In this paper, we asked two specific questions. First, does the Orb2 protein form amyloid-like oligomers in the adult Drosophila brain in an activity-dependent manner? Second, is this oligomerization necessary for long-term memory? We find that Drosophila Orb2 forms stable SDS-resistant, amyloid-like oligomers upon neuronal stimulation, and Orb2 mutant defective in activity-dependent oligomerization is specifically impaired in forming stable long-term memories. These observations support the hypothesis that self-sustaining amyloid-like conversion of neuronal CPEB is involved in the persistence of memory. Previously, in Aplysia we observed two forms of neuronal CPEB: an abundant monomer and a rarer SDS-resistant oligomer that was detectable only after immunopurification (Si et al., 2003bSi K. Lindquist S. Kandel E.R. A neuronal isoform of the aplysia CPEB has prion-like properties.Cell. 2003; 115: 879-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, Si et al., 2010Si K. Choi Y.B.

Aplysia CPEB can form prion-like multimers in sensory neurons that contribute to long-term facilitation.Cell. 2010; 140: 421-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Similarly, in Drosophila two size classes of Orb2 proteins were observed only upon immunoprecipitation of tyramine-stimulated (please see Figure 2 for detail of tyramine stimulation) head extracts: an 82 kDa monomer and a high-molecular-weight species migrating between 160 and 420 kDa (Figures 1A and S1 for antibody specificity). This high-molecular-weight species contains Orb2 because it is absent in orb2 null or Orb2 RNAi flies (Figures 1A and 1B) and reappears following rescue with Orb2 genomic fragment (Figures 1C and S1B). In addition, multiple antibodies against Orb2 (Figure S1C) recognize the high-molecular-weight form (Figures 1A and 1B). Immunoprecipitation per se did not induce the high-molecular-weight form because immunopurification from increasing amounts of body extract (Figure 1D) did not lead to a corresponding increase in the high-molecular-weight Orb2. Additionally, the smaller form did not arise from dissociation of the high-molecular-weight species because fractionation of Orb2 immunoprecipitates in a high-salt sucrose gradient prior to boiling and SDS treatment still revealed two distinct peaks of Orb2: one distributed around 80–150 kDa and another around 670 kDa (Figure 1E). These results are consistent with the coexistence of two distinct size classes of Orb2 in vivo. Treatment of Orb2 immunoprecipitate with phosphatase or N-glycosidase (PGNaseF) did not change Orb2 mobility in SDS-PAGE (Figure 1F), and antibodies against ubiquitin, sumo, or acetyl groups recognized neither the high- nor the low-molecular-weight Orb2 (data not shown). These results suggest that the higher-molecular-weight form is not due to phosphorylation, N-glycosylation, ubiquitination, sumoylation, or acetylation (data not shown). In fact, the high-molecular-weight Orb2 species is resistant to all the following treatments: RNaseA and high salt (Figure 1E), detergents such as 1%Triton X-100 and sodium deoxycholate (Figure 1F, +Detergents lane), denaturants 6M urea or 6M guanidine hydrochloride (Figure 1F), and subsequent 10 min boiling in the presence of 10% SDS and 10 mM DTT (Figure 1F), suggesting that the high-molecular-weight Orb2 protein is not due to association with other proteins or mRNA. Purified recombinant Orb2 proteins also form heat-stable SDS-resistant oligomers in 6M guanidine hydrochloride that are similar in size to endogenous Orb2 oligomers (Figure 1G, also see Figure 3 for detail of Orb2A and Orb2B) and after 4 hr in 1M urea form large amyloid-like fibers (Figure 1H). We therefore conclude that the high-molecular-weight species are formed by self-assembly of the Orb2 proteins into heat- and SDS-resistant amyloid-like structures. Henceforth the high-molecular-weight form is referred to as oligomeric Orb2, and the low-molecular-weight form as monomeric Orb2. If Orb2 is an activity-dependent regulator of protein synthesis, we reasoned that neuronal stimulation may alter the level of oligomeric Orb2. To test this possibility, we used the thermo-sensitive dTrpA1 channel (Hamada et al., 2008Hamada F.N. Rosenzweig M. Kang K. Pulver S.R. Ghezzi A. Jegla T.J. Garrity P.A. An internal thermal sensor controlling temperature preference in Drosophila.Nature. 2008; 454: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar) to depolarize Kenyon cells of the mushroom body, a structure known to be involved in memory formation in Drosophila (Berry et al., 2008Berry J.

Mushroom body memoir: from maps to models.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 266-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). Flies with a single copy of UAS-dTrpA1 under mushroom body drivers C747-Gal4 and MB247-Gal4 showed no significant change in the level of the monomer (Figure S1D) but had 4- to 5-fold more of oligomeric Orb2 at 29°C compared to 22°C (Figures 2A, 2C , and S1E). This increase required both UAS-dTrpA1 and Gal4 transgene (Figure 2A). In contrast, stimulating glutamatergic neurons outside the mushroom body caused no change in either form of Orb2 (Figures 2C and S1F) even though the Gal4 driver (OK371) (Mahr and Aberle, 2006Mahr A. Aberle H. The expression pattern of the Drosophila vesicular glutamate transporter: a marker protein for motoneurons and glutamatergic centers in the brain.Gene Expr. Patterns. 2006; 6: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) is expressed in a similar number of neurons. These results suggest that stimulation of mushroom body neurons increases the amount of oligomeric Orb2. In Drosophila, the neurotransmitters octopamine and dopamine are known to regulate memory formation in the mushroom body (Aso et al., 2010Aso Y. Siwanowicz I. Bräcker L. Ito K. Kitamoto T.

To test whether activation of these neuromodulatory pathways can alter Orb2 levels, the temperature-sensitive dTrpA1 channel was expressed in either tyraminergic/octopaminergic neurons or dopaminergic/serotonergic neurons using the drivers Tdc2-Gal4 and Ddc-Gal4, respectively. Exposure to 29°C doubled the amount of oligomeric Orb2 within an hour (Figures 2B and 2C). We also stimulated the neuromodulatory pathways by feeding wild-type flies biogenic amines and observed a 7- to 8-fold increase in oligomeric Orb2 protein upon exposure to dopamine, octopamine, and tyramine but not serotonin (Figures 2D, 2E and S1G). This increase occurred within 2 hr, peaked around 4 hr, and persisted up to 24 hr (Figure 2F). The increase was observed only in the head but not in the body (Figure 1D), suggesting that oligomeric Orb2 is induced upon activation of the mushroom body directly or via dopamine/tyramine/octopamine-responsive neurons. These results are similar to what we observed in Aplysia, where stimulation with the neurotransmitter serotonin increased oligomeric Aplysia CPEB protein (Si et al., 2003aSi K. Giustetto M. Etkin A. Hsu R. Janisiewicz A.M. Miniaci M.C. Kim J.H. Zhu H. Kandel E.R.

Our model posits that oligomeric Orb2 proteins act as a synaptic mark, conferring temporal and spatial restriction to the activity-dependent synaptic changes. Thus, we sought to localize the monomeric and oligomeric forms of Orb2 within the fly nervous system. Tissue-specific RNAi indicated that in the adult head, neurons are the primary cell type expressing Orb2 (Figure S2A ). To determine the neuroanatomical distribution of Orb2, we introduced an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-tagged genomic rescue construct (see Figure S1B for rescue construct) into the orb2 null background. Orb2 expression was readily detectable in soma throughout the brain including the mushroom body (Figures S2B–S2D). In live brain imaging, low but EGFP-specific signals were observed in the synaptic-neuropil region surrounding the mushroom body but not in the antennal lobe or subesophageal ganglia (Figure S2C). To determine the subcellular distribution of Orb2 proteins, we prepared synaptosome from 3 ml of tyramine-stimulated wild-type adult fly heads and separated the membranes from the soluble fraction (Figures S2E and S2F). The SDS-resistant oligomeric Orb2 was specifically enriched in the detergent-extracted synaptic membrane fraction (Figures 2G and 2H). This enrichment was in striking contrast to monomeric Orb2 whose prevalence actually decreased in the synaptosome fractions (Figure 2G). Notably, these oligomers are stable after boiling in 6M urea (Figure 2I) and detectable without immunoprecipitation, suggesting a native amyloid-like state of Orb2. Taken together, the live brain imaging and biochemical fractionation suggest that the majority of monomeric Orb2 is present in neuronal cell bodies, whereas SDS-resistant oligomeric Orb2 is enriched in the synaptic region. What is the composition of the Orb2 oligomer? The Orb2 locus encodes six protein isoforms (based on Flybase modENCODE data), of which two isoforms, Orb2A and Orb2B, are CPEB homologs (Figures 3A and S1B for detail) (Keleman et al., 2007Keleman K. Krüttner S. Alenius M. Dickson B.J. Function of the Drosophila CPEB protein Orb2 in long-term courtship memory.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 1587-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, Mastushita-Sakai et al., 2010Mastushita-Sakai T. White-Grindley E. Samuelson J. Seidel C. Si K. Drosophila Orb2 targets genes involved in neuronal growth, synapse formation, and protein turnover.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 11987-11992Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The short Orb2A form differs from the long Orb2B form in the number of amino acids leading the N-terminal prion-like domain: 8 amino acids for Orb2A and 162 amino acids for Orb2B (Figures S1A and 3A). Does this domain organization have any consequence with respect to Orb2 oligomerization? In flies, exogenous Orb2AEGFP but not Orb2BEGFP formed fluorescent puncta in neurons (Figure 3A). These puncta probably represent assembly of higher-order oligomers detectable in SDS-PAGE of fly head extracts (Figures 3B and S3A) and in sucrose gradient fractionation (Figure S3B ). These differences are inherent to the two isoforms because as in neurons, in S2 cells, only Orb2A formed large aggregates and fluorescent puncta (Figures S3C and S3D), even though both Orb2A and Orb2B protein formed SDS-resistant oligomers (Figure S3C). Additionally, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) analysis revealed that Orb2A aggregates are more tightly assembled (Figures S3E–S3G). FRAP analysis also revealed that Orb2A puncta are more stable than Orb2B and other Drosophila Q-rich RNA-binding proteins and simple polyQ aggregates (Figures S3F and S3G). Similarly, only Orb2A formed puncta in stimulated Aplysia sensory neurons (Si et al., 2010Si K. Choi Y.B. White-Grindley E. Majumdar A. Kandel E.R. Aplysia CPEB can form prion-like multimers in sensory neurons that contribute to long-term facilitation.Cell. 2010; 140: 421-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). These observations imply that Orb2A is more efficient at forming stable self-assembled oligomers. Indeed, recombinant Orb2A monomers obtained by passing purified proteins through a 100 kDa filter to remove all pre-existing aggregates formed oligomers in 6M guanidine hydrochloride more readily than Orb2B monomers did (% of total protein in oligomers: Orb2A: 31.8 ± 5.2, n = 6, Orb2B, 3.3 ± 0.6, n = 3, p = 0.008) (Figure 3C).Figure S3Related to Figure 3, Figure 4Show full caption(A) The EGFP-tagged Orb2A and Orb2B form SDS-resistant oligomers in the adult brain. A corresponding increase in the oligomer size is evident in the EGFP-tagged Orb2 flies.(B) Gradient analysis of adult brain extract reveals Orb2A (top panel) but not Orb2B (bottom panel), sediments as a high-molecular-weight entity. The Orb2AEGFP- or Orb2BEGFP-expressing head lysates were fractionated on a 10%–40% sucrose gradient. The approximate molecular weights represented in the fractions are shown above. The lighter and heavier fractions of the gradients are marked as top and bottom, respectively.(C–G) Analysis of Orb2 oligomerization in S2 cells. In S2 cells there is no detectable Orb2 protein making it easier to study the exogenous protein (Mastushita-Sakai et al., 2010Mastushita-Sakai T. White-Grindley E. Samuelson J. Seidel C. Si K. Drosophila Orb2 targets genes involved in neuronal growth, synapse formation, and protein turnover.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 11987-11992Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).(C) Upon exogenous expression, both the Orb2A and Orb2B protein formed SDS-resistant oligomers in S2 cells and Orb2A formed large aggregates. The pellet in 1.2% SDS-agarose gel shows Orb2A forms large aggregates in S2 cell (left panel). The western blotting of supernatant shows more Orb2B proteins in the monomeric form (right panel).(D) Orb2AEGFP forms visible punctate structures characteristic of aggregated proteins in Drosophila S2 cells. Within 8 hr post-transfection, Orb2AEGFP formed fluorescent puncta in all transfected cells, whereas the expression of Orb2BEGFP was primarily diffuse, with visible puncta found in <1% cells even 36 hr post-transfection. Scale bar, 5 μm.(E) Orb2A shows higher FRET efficiency. To test whether the puncta contained self-assembled Orb2, and could serve as a proxy for Orb2 oligomerization, we performed FRET analysis on C-terminal EGFP- and mCherry-tagged Orb2A and the rare Orb2B puncta. FRET measures the proximity and the packing of labeled proteins. Surprisingly, mush higher FRET was observed within Orb2A puncta (mean ± SEM: 0.0636 ± 0.0056, n = 18) than Orb2B puncta (mean ± SEM: 0.0276 ± 0.0029, p = 0.0011, n = 6) (Figure S3E), suggesting Orb2B by itself packed differently from Orb2A.(F) Other Q-rich RNA-binding proteins also form puncta when expressed in S2 cells. EGFP tagged Unr (41.4% Q/N in the first 162 amino acids compared to 23% in Orb2A), ELAV (32.7%Q/N), RBP9 (27.5% Q/N), Fne (13.2%) as well as 47Q (Orb2A has 27Q residues in first 160 amino acids) form numerous punctate structures like Orb2A. Scale bar, 5 μm.(G) Compared to other Q-rich proteins, Orb2A punctate structures are less mobile. Because in vivo Orb2 oligomers are very stable, for comparison we expressed Q/N rich RNA binding proteins in S2 cells (Figure S3F) and examined their relative stability by FRAP. FRAP studies show a much smaller pool of EGFP-tagged Orb2A exchanging with the free cytoplasmic form of the protein compared to Orb2B, Elav, RBP9, Fne and Unr (left panel), HttQ23 and HttQ47. All the fluorescent puncta tested recovered between 50%–90% within 45 s except Orb2AEGFP. Data are represented as mean ± SEM. From these several results, we conclude that in S2 cells the visible Orb2A puncta serve as a good proxy for stable self-assembled oligomerization of Orb2 in the adult brain.View Large Image"

Of the four JAK isoforms and seven STAT isoforms known, JAK2 and STAT3 are highly expressed in the brain where they are present in the postsynaptic density (PSD). Here, we demonstrate a new neuronal function for the JAK/STAT pathway. Using a variety of complementary approaches, we show that the JAK/STAT pathway plays an essential role in the induction of NMDA-receptor dependent long-term depression (NMDAR-LTD) in the hippocampus. Therefore, in addition to established roles in cytokine signaling, the JAK/STAT pathway is involved in synaptic plasticity in the brain."

The HPX2-NOX5 system potentiates nitric oxide toxicity and is critical for mosquitoes to mount an effective antiplasmodial response.

https://openalex.org/W2102848317,"Plasticity of excitatory synapses onto striatal projection neurons (MSNs) has the potential to regulate motor function by setting the gain on signals driving both direct- and indirect-pathway basal ganglia circuits. Endocannabinoid-dependent long-term depression (eCB-LTD) is the best characterized form of striatal plasticity, but the mechanisms governing its normal regulation and pathological dysregulation are not well understood. We characterized two distinct signaling pathways mediating eCB production in striatal indirect-pathway MSNs and found that both pathways were modulated by dopamine D2 and adenosine A2A receptors, acting through cAMP/PKA. We identified regulator of G protein signaling 4 (RGS4) as a key link between D2/A2A signaling and eCB mobilization pathways. In contrast to wild-type mice, RGS4⁻/⁻ mice exhibited normal eCB-LTD after dopamine depletion and were significantly less impaired in the 6-OHDA model of Parkinson's disease. Taken together, these results suggest that inhibition of RGS4 may be an effective nondopaminergic strategy for treating Parkinson's disease."

Genetic sources of risk for SUDs are not highly substance specific in their effects. Genetic and environmental risks for SUDs typically do not only add together but also interact with each other over development. Risk gene identification for SUDs has been difficult, with one recent success in identifying nicotinic receptor variants that affect risk for nicotine dependence. The impact of genetic variants on SUD risk will individually be small. Although genetic epidemiologic methods are giving us an increasingly accurate map of broad causal pathways to SUDs, gene discovery will be needed to identify the specific biological systems. Identifying these risk genes and understanding their action will require large clinical samples, and interaction between these studies and work in model organisms."
https://openalex.org/W1996940119,"Transient increases in nucleus accumbens (NAc) dopamine concentration are observed when animals are presented with motivationally salient stimuli and are theorized to energize reward seeking. They arise from high-frequency firing of dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), which also results in the release of endocannabinoids from dopamine cell bodies. In this context, endocannabinoids are thought to regulate reward seeking by modulating dopamine signaling, although a direct link has never been demonstrated. To test this, we pharmacologically manipulated endocannabinoid neurotransmission in the VTA while measuring transient changes in dopamine concentration in the NAc during reward seeking. Disrupting endocannabinoid signaling dramatically reduced, whereas augmenting levels of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2AG) increased, cue-evoked dopamine concentrations and reward seeking. These data suggest that 2AG in the VTA regulates reward seeking by sculpting ethologically relevant patterns of dopamine release during reward-directed behavior."

Antigen acquired by B lymphocytes exhibited a polarized distribution that was sustained over several rounds of cell division. This produced a population of activated B lymphocytes that contained very low levels of antigen. Daughter cells that received more antigen were better able to stimulate T cells. Because cues received through T lymphocyte interactions are likely to influence B lymphocyte fate decisions, unequal distribution of antigen in dividing B lymphocytes may influence their differentiation."

Here, we discover editing within Ca(v)1.3 Ca²⁺ channels, renown for low-voltage Ca²⁺-influx and neuronal pacemaking. Significantly, editing occurs within the channel's IQ domain, a calmodulin-binding site mediating inhibitory Ca²⁺-feedback (CDI) on channels. The editing turns out to require RNA adenosine deaminase ADAR2, whose variable activity could underlie a spatially diverse pattern of Ca(v)1.3 editing seen across the brain. Edited Ca(v)1.3 protein is detected both in brain tissue and within the surface membrane of primary neurons. Functionally, edited Ca(v)1.3 channels exhibit strong reduction of CDI; in particular, neurons within the suprachiasmatic nucleus show diminished CDI, with higher frequencies of repetitive action-potential and calcium-spike activity, in wild-type versus ADAR2 knockout mice. Our study reveals a mechanism for fine-tuning Ca(v)1.3 channel properties in CNS, which likely impacts a broad spectrum of neurobiological functions."

The neuroimaging community is at a crossroads. Long characterized by individualism, the data and computational and analytic needs of the connectome-wide association era necessitate cultural reform. Emerging initiatives have demonstrated the feasibility and utility of adopting an open neuroscience model to accelerate the pace and success of scientific discovery. Human neuroimaging has entered the connectome-wide association (CWA) era. As with genome-wide association studies (GWAS), the objective is clear: to attribute phenotypic variation among individuals to differences in the macro- and microarchitecture of the human connectome (Bilder et al., 2009Bilder R.M. Sabb F.W. Cannon T.D. London E.D. Jentsch J.D. Parker D.S. Poldrack R.A. Evans C. Freimer N.B. Neuroscience. 2009; 164: 30-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, Cichon et al., 2009Cichon S.

Neurophysiol. 2010; 103: 297-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). Similar to the genome, the complexities of the connectome have compelled the community to expand its analytic repertoire beyond hypothesis-driven approaches and to embrace discovery science (e.g., exploratory data analysis). The discovery paradigm provides a vehicle for generating novel and unexpected hypotheses that can then be rigorously tested. The acquisition and aggregation of large-scale, uniformly phenotyped data sets are essential to provide the necessary statistical power for effective discovery. In addition to the challenges of amassing such data sets, the neuroscience community must develop the necessary computational infrastructure and inference techniques (Akil et al., 2011Akil H. Martone M.E. Van Essen D.C. Science. 2011; 331: 708-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). It is my tenet that adoption of an open neuroscience model can overcome many barriers to success. This NeuroView will look at the neuroimaging community through the lens of discovery science, identifying practices that currently hinder progress, as well as open neuroscience initiatives that are rapidly advancing the field. I will focus on functional neuroimaging, because resting-state functional MRI (R-fMRI) approaches have proven to be highly amenable to discovery science. However, the majority of issues raised will apply to all scales (macro to micro) and modalities (e.g., diffusion imaging) used to characterize the human connectome. Van Horn and Gazzaniga first called for unrestricted public sharing of functional imaging data in 2002 (Van Horn and Gazzaniga, 2002Van Horn J.D. Gazzaniga M.S. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 314-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). They created the fMRI Data Center (fMRIDC) and asserted that data sharing would lead to the generation of new hypotheses and testing of novel methods. However, the dominant approach at the time was task-based imaging (T-fMRI), which has struggled with marked variability in approaches and findings across laboratories, even when studying the same cognitive construct. Such variability is problematic for data aggregation. The community failed to embrace their enthusiasm, limiting the practical success of the visionary fMRIDC effort. The 1000 Functional Connectomes Project (FCP) reinvigorated the ethos of data sharing and discovery science among imagers (Biswal et al., 2010Biswal B.B. Mennes M. Zuo X.N. Gohel S. Kelly C. Smith S.M. Beckmann C.F. Adelstein J.S. Buckner R.L. Colcombe S. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 4734-4739Crossref PubMed Scopus (2140) Google Scholar). In large part, the success of the FCP can be attributed to its focus on R-fMRI. Despite initial concerns, R-fMRI has emerged as a powerful imaging modality due to high reproducibility of findings across laboratories and impressive test-retest reliability. In December 2009, the FCP (http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org) publicly released over 1,300 data sets independently collected at 33 imaging sites worldwide—a sample size several orders of magnitude greater than nearly any laboratory could hope to obtain alone. Investigators from over 2,000 sites in 86 countries have downloaded FCP data sets (per Google Analytics). The initial FCP publication demonstrated the feasibility of data pooling and discovery science for R-fMRI. However, barriers to open sharing remain. Here, I enumerate existing obstacles and then review the progress of data-sharing efforts that aim to overcome them. Countless data sets comprising both phenotypic and neuroimaging data remain stored in laboratory archives long after publication and are often lost to the scientific community forever. Such a loss commonly reflects a lack of appreciation of the potential value of one's data to others beyond the primary study focus. Additionally, such a loss can arise from concerns about losing a competitive advantage. Regardless of motive, the end result is a missed opportunity to advance our understanding of brain-behavior relationships and the methodologies required to successfully characterize them. When data sharing does occur, it is commonly after a cycle of data collection, data analysis, and subsequent publication. This cycle can last 3–6 years, resulting in substantial opportunity costs relative to promptly shared data, as well as unnecessary duplication of effort among groups with similar interests. Understandably, researchers are reluctant to release data that they themselves have had insufficient time to analyze or explore, let alone publish—again primarily a reflection of fears about loss of competitive advantages. Yet, as the molecular genetics community has demonstrated, open, prospective data sharing is a powerful means to advance a field rapidly. This is especially true when the broader scientific community can be brought into the process through the provision of free and unrestricted access to full data sets. Importantly, the potential to create large-scale aggregate data sets across independent imaging sites will not be realized by the adoption of an open-sharing philosophy alone. The success of such aggregate data sets is dependent on the collection of common phenotypic information across imaging sites. Unfortunately, no commonly accepted standards for collecting phenotypic information exist (Bilder et al., 2009Bilder R.M. Sabb F.W. Cannon T.D. London E.D. Jentsch J.D. Parker D.S. Poldrack R.A. Evans C. Freimer N.B. Neuroscience. 2009; 164: 30-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). A wide variety of instruments exists, often with numerous versions and revisions, to measure seemingly simple traits (e.g., handedness) or complex phenomena (e.g., psychiatric symptomatology). Further, few instruments are designed for crosscultural use, limiting the feasibility of global aggregation. Another challenge is that researchers pay limited attention to variations in R-fMRI data acquisition, and the specifics of the scan sessions are rarely documented. Systematic variation can be introduced by acquiring R-fMRI data after an effortful task (Barnes et al., 2009Barnes A. Bullmore E.T. Suckling J. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e6626Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Similarly, fatigue related to duration of time in the scanner can also impact R-fMRI measures (i.e., if a scan is collected early versus late in a session) (Yan et al., 2009Yan C. Liu D. He Y. Zou Q. Zhu C. Zuo X. Long X. Zang Y. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e5743Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Additional sources of variation that are inconsistently taken into account include the specific instructions provided to subjects (e.g., “relax” versus “try not to think” versus “keep your head still”) and eyes open/closed status (Yan et al., 2009Yan C. Liu D. He Y. Zou Q. Zhu C. Zuo X. Long X. Zang Y. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e5743Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). FCP feasibility analyses suggested that these sources of variation do not preclude the possibility of successful data aggregation. However, greater attention to these details will minimize the unexplained noise that degrades the statistical power inherent in large-scale data aggregation. Finally, beyond the coordination of data acquisition and distribution approaches, a key question that remains is whether to share only data that pass certain quality criteria or to share all data, thereby placing responsibility for quality control in the hands of users. A complicating reality is the lack of consensus regarding data quality standards to guide the detection of outliers. Even if standards for data quality were established (Friedman and Glover, 2006Friedman L. Glover G.H. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging. 2006; 23: 827-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), data rejected based on current standards may become useful in the future as correction algorithms emerge that are capable of “rescuing” some of the previously rejected data. Although the challenges are formidable, several ongoing efforts suggest that we are in the midst of a cultural revolution in favor of open data sharing. The major funders of institutional science have long advocated such a shift. Ongoing initiatives can be broadly divided into coordinated data-generating efforts and investigator-initiated data-sharing efforts. Following the model of prior coordinated data-generating efforts (e.g., Biomedical Informatics Research Network [BIRN], Functional BIRN, the National Institutes of Health [NIH] MRI Study of Normal Brain Development, and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative [ADNI]), the NIH recently charged the Human Connectome Project (HCP) with the generation and open sharing of a large-scale coordinated data set with state-of-the-art multimodal imaging and genetics using a twin design (n = 1,200; 300 families) (Marcus et al., 2011Marcus D.S. Harwell J. Olsen T. Hodge M. Glasser M.F. Prior F. Jenkinson M. Laumann T. Curtiss S.W. Van Essen D.C. Front Neuroinform. 2011; 5: 4Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The effort promises to deliver carefully collected, high-quality data sets, which will fuel years of analytic efforts. Additionally, the HCP is working to innovate data acquisition procedures (e.g., fast repetition time acquisitions) and to address the limitations of current data formats. Although this effort will be transformative, advances in imaging cannot depend solely on the acquisition and release of a single sample. Extensively coordinated efforts, such as ADNI, BIRN, and HCP, are designed to maximally reduce noise arising from between-site differences in imaging protocols or sampling strategies. However, the costs of such efforts (e.g., $69 million for ADNI or $40 million for the HCP) limit how many extensively coordinated efforts can be conducted. As an alternative, investigator-initiated sharing efforts provide an economical option for accelerating discovery science. In that regard, the International Neuroimaging Data-sharing Initiative (INDI), a next-generation FCP endeavor, was founded in an attempt to (1) expand the scope of open data sharing in the functional neuroimaging community to include phenotypic data beyond age and sex (a limitation of the FCP data set) and (2) provide a model for prospective, prepublication data sharing. INDI has already demonstrated the feasibility of achieving these goals. In particular, the Nathan Kline Institute-Rockland Sample (NKI-RS) successfully and prospectively distributed over 200 deeply phenotyped R-fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging data sets sampling the life span via weekly uploads. With recently granted National Institute of Mental Health funding, the NKI-RS effort will phenotype and image 1,000 individuals over the next 4 years—once again with weekly prepublication sharing, including R-fMRI and diffusion imaging data acquired via novel sequences (Feinberg et al., 2010Feinberg D.A. Moeller S. Smith S.M. Auerbach E. Ramanna S. Gunther M. Glasser M.F. Miller K.L. Ugurbil K. Yacoub E. PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e15710Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar) provided by the HCP. Numerous other prospective data sets have been pledged or provided, with varying distribution schedules (e.g., quarterly). INDI also actively gathers and shares retrospective data sets. The Brain Genomics Superstruct Project, launched in 2008 at Harvard University and Massachusetts General Hospital, will share 1,500 data sets in 2012 (Yeo et al., 2011Yeo B.T. Krienen F.M. Sepulcre J. Sabuncu M.R. Lashkari D. Hollinshead M. Roffman J.L. Smoller J.W. Zöllei L. Polimeni J.R. et al.J. Neurophysiol. 2011; 106: 1125-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (4116) Google Scholar). The ADHD-200 was launched in March 2011, sharing data sets from 485 typically developing children and 291 children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder aggregated from eight independent imaging sites. This was a landmark event for child psychiatry, for which data collection can be exceedingly costly and technically challenging. INDI offers a drastically less expensive means of accelerating science by providing large boluses of data upon which future efforts can be based. The FCP and INDI efforts are not unique in embracing open data sharing. The first, fMRIDC, successfully accumulated thousands of images and inspired researchers worldwide. Similarly, Brainscape, OASIS (http://www.oasis-brains.org) and XNAT Central (http://central.xnat.org) were established to encourage investigators to deposit data sets for open sharing. Additionally, the XNAT-based efforts aim to enable easy data accessioning and databasing: highly desirable goals that are increasingly being realized (Marcus et al., 2007Marcus D.S. Olsen T.R. Ramaratnam M. Buckner R.L. Neuroinformatics. 2007; 5: 11-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The mantle of T-fMRI data sharing is now being taken up again by Open fMRI (http://www.openfmri.org), which also provides analytic tools (Poldrack, 2011Poldrack R.A. Neuron. 2011; 72: 692-697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Additionally, http://openconnectome.org has launched a data-sharing initiative for electron microscopy data that provides information about microlevel connectome properties. Finally, the NIH recently demonstrated its commitment to open neuroscience by mandating that certain NIH-funded autism research be entered into the National Database for Autism Research for eventual sharing. Beyond unlocking data archives, numerous initiatives are attempting to advance phenotypic harmonization. The NIH Toolbox, a suite of assessment tools, will be the phenotyping engine for large-scale data-collection efforts such as the HCP. The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke has developed the Common Data Elements (http://www.commondataelements.ninds.nih.gov), consisting of a streamlined set of phenotypic acquisition tools for characterizing clinical populations in neurology. PhenX (http://www.phenxtoolkit.org) has emerged as a comprehensive acquisition package for phenotypic and exposure information. Finally, INDI plans to promote the global usage of the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessments (ASEBA; http://www.aseba.org), which provides standardized dimensional measures of psychiatric symptomatology. The ASEBA consists of easily administered self-report and informant questionnaires, normed between ages 1.5 and 90+ years and available in more than 85 languages. As discussed, the establishment of an open-access, data-sharing community would represent an important step forward for the CWA era. However, it is not the only cultural change required. Below I discuss neuroimaging community practices that can continue to retard progress. 1. Open Access, Closed Science. Open data sharing should not be confused with open neuroscience. As per Wikipedia, open science mandates the “subsequent research to take place openly. Projects that provide open data but don't offer open collaboration are referred to as ‘open access’ rather than open research.” This means that open neuroscience involves more than just openly sharing data. Imaging researchers must begin to share their intermediate or end data products; this is especially important as the computational complexity of image analysis increases beyond the resources of any individual laboratory. 2. In-House Software. Although numerous fMRI analysis packages are available, their interfaces and workflows tend to be geared toward regional analysis rather than connectivity. In response, R-fMRI researchers frequently rely on in-house software that either specifically conducts connectivity analyses or interfaces with common analytic packages to accomplish the goal. Rarely is this software available to others, often due to concerns about insufficient documentation or the challenges of supporting it. The resulting unnecessary duplication of efforts hampers the development of common, user-friendly software. Moreover, the lack of open access to in-house software and typically sparse descriptions of implementation details limits fair evaluations for accuracy. The open sharing and/or publication of code and scripts supporting data analysis can rapidly alleviate these challenges. 3. Big Data, Small Databases. As thoroughly outlined by Akil et al., 2011Akil H. Martone M.E. Van Essen D.C. Science. 2011; 331: 708-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, the creation of large-scale data sets will challenge the vast majority of in-house databasing infrastructures, as well as current implementations of freeware databases (e.g., XNAT, Human Imaging Database). Greater investment in the development and/or maturation of user-friendly, high-capacity databases is required for the CWA era. 4. The Jack-of-All-Trades Phenomenon. The modern-day neuroscientist feels increasingly pressured to be proficient in a growing array of scientific domains (e.g., cognitive neuroscience, clinical neuroscience, computer science, statistics, and biophysics). Unfortunately, existing centralized educational resources cannot cover the broad gamut of interdisciplinary domains with which a researcher must be familiar. Although interdisciplinary training and fluency in multiple domains is essential, mastery of all is unlikely. Success in the CWA era will require the involvement of the broader scientific community and greater focus on active interdisciplinary collaboration. Open science initiatives serve to both inspire and facilitate collaborative research efforts within and across scientific disciplines. 5. Analytic Inertia. To date, imaging analysis has predominantly relied upon univariate statistical approaches. Unfortunately, such analytic frameworks fail to consider the complexities of the connectome. Similarly, conventional statistical models are poorly equipped for high-dimensional data sets. Novel analytic approaches to characterizing and exploring the connectome, as well as linking its properties to phenotypic variation, are needed. Recent applications of multivariate pattern analytic techniques based in graph theory and statistical or machine learning have highlighted the potential value of more complex analytic approaches (Bullmore and Bassett, 2011Bullmore E.T. Bassett D.S. Annu. Rev. Clin. Psychol. 2011; 7: 113-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar, Craddock et al., 2009Craddock R.C. Holtzheimer 3rd, P.E. Hu X.P. Mayberg H.S. Magn. Reson. Med. 2009; 62: 1619-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, Dosenbach et al., 2010Dosenbach N.U. Nardos B. Cohen A.L. Fair D.A. Power J.D. Church J.A. Nelson S.M. Wig G.S. Vogel A.C. Lessov-Schlaggar C.N. et al.Science. 2010; 329: 1358-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (1437) Google Scholar, Poldrack, 2011Poldrack R.A. Neuron. 2011; 72: 692-697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Once again, the expertise and input of the broader scientific community will be needed to ensure appropriate implementation. Every significant innovation entails a new set of challenges and opens new avenues of research—often larger in scale. Although neuroimaging researchers could once work in silos, with only a limited set of developers supporting the community (e.g., Analysis of Functional NeuroImages [AFNI], FMRIB software library [FSL], and Statistical Parameter Mapping [SPM]), the demands of the CWA era have changed the game. Fortunately, the community is mobilizing and shifting toward open science at a rapid pace. A full review of all the emerging initiatives would be too extensive for the present work. Instead, I provide descriptions (see Table 1) of selected initiatives that (1) guide users to or host open science initiatives (e.g., Neuroscience Information Framework, The Neuroimaging Tools and Resources Clearinghouse [NITRC]), (2) actively promote communication and collaboration (e.g., International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility, Neuro Bureau [NB]), (3) promote infrastructure pipeline development using nonproprietary platforms (e.g., NiPype, Niak), or (4) provide novel analytic platforms for the connectome (e.g., The Brain Connectivity Toolbox, Connectome Toolkit, Connectir). These efforts represent the building blocks of a new culture of competitive collaboration.Table 1Selected Open Neuroscience Initiatives and ResourcesThe Brain Connectivity Toolbox (BCT; https://sites.google.com/a/brain-connectivity-toolbox.net/bct) contains a large selection of complex network measures in MATLAB. These measures are increasingly used to characterize structural and functional brain connectivity.Connectome Mapping Toolkit (http://www.cmtk.org) is a free, open-source, crossplatform toolkit for connectome visualization and analysis. Allows for large sets of multimodal data to be processed, analyzed, and visualized. It also enhances data organization, integration, and sharing.The Debian Neuroscience Repository (http://neuro.debian.net) is a software repository for neuroscience-related packages for use on the free operating system, Debian. It contains both currently available packages and unofficial or prospective packages not yet available from the Debian archive. Initially created for distributing PyMVPA, collaborative efforts with the NiPy team have yielded NiBable and NiPype.International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility (INCF; http://www.incf.org) seeks to develop an international neuroinformatics infrastructure to facilitate and guide the setting of standards for the collection, modeling, and sharing of diverse neuroscientific data sets. Specialized INCF programs include Digital Brain Atlasing Program, Multiscale Modeling Program, and Standards for Datasharing.The Neuro Bureau (http://neurobureau.projects.nitrc.org) is a forum and collaborative initiative that supports open neuroscience by promoting the sharing of ideas, data, and methods across disciplines. Recent projects include the ADHD-200 Preprocessed Initiative, the 2011 Brain-Art Competition, and the 2011 Brain Cartographies art exhibition.The Neuroimaging Analysis Kit (NIAK; http://www.nitrc.org/projects/niak) is an open source interactive toolbox dedicated to the creation of data analysis workflows within Octave or MATLAB(r): implementation in Octave reduces the potentially prohibitive costs of MATLAB. Processing steps can easily be combined into novel workflows.Neuroimaging in Python (NIPYPE; http://nipy.sourceforge.net/nipype) is an open-source, community-developed software initiative dedicated to analytic workflow development in Python. Provides a uniform interface to existing imaging analysis software, allowing distinct packages to interact within a single workflow.The Neuroimaging Tools and Resources Clearinghouse (NITRC; http://www.nitrc.org) is a web-based clearinghouse for openly shared analytical tools and resources—both popular and in-house software. Provides support forums, workflow, and traffic monitoring free of charge. Also provides support for data repositories such as the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project and the International Neuroimaging Data-sharing Initiative.Neuroscience Information Framework (NIF; http://www.neuinfo.org) is a data-sharing initiative that allows researchers to discover and share data, materials, and tools through an open-source, networked environment. NIF provides access to over 3,800 resources through their registry and more than 70 independent databases in the data federation.Additional Open Resources: Cognitive Atlas (http://www.cognitiveatlas.org); Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience (http://crcns.org); Connectir (http://connectir.projects.nitrc.org); Magnetic Resonance Connectome Automated Pipeline (MRCAP; http://www.nitrc.org/projects/mrcap); Medical Image Analysis Lab (http://mialab.mrn.org/software); Medical Image Processing, Analysis, and Visualization (MIPAV; http://mipav.cit.nih.gov); Mindboggle (http://www.mindboggle.info); Resting State fMRI Data Analysis Toolkit (http://restfmri.net/forum) Open table in a new tab An example of this developing culture comes from the recent Global ADHD-200 Competition. The path of the data from origin to the winning entry was as follows: data were (1) contributed to INDI by the ADHD-200 Consortium (eight independent imaging sites spanning three continents), (2) organized by the INDI team, (3) distributed via the INDI website based on NITRC—an open community resource, (4) downloaded from INDI and preprocessed by the Neuro Bureau, (5) distributed via NITRC in preprocessed form by the NB, and (6) downloaded in processed and unprocessed form by competitors around the world. The winning team (specializing in biostatistics) elected to use NB processed data, as did many others. This is an excellent model of open neuroscience: the community worked collaboratively, building off of each other's accomplishments, whether in a coordinated fashion or not. The promise of the CWA era is as great as the infrastructural and analytic challenges posed. Ongoing initiatives demonstrate the feasibility and desire for the community to adopt an open neuroscience model to meet this challenge. The support of scientific leaders and funding institutions has and will continue to be paramount in this transformation."

https://openalex.org/W2013383287,"The principal eyes of jumping spiders have a unique retina with four tiered photoreceptor layers, on each of which light of different wavelengths is focused by a lens with appreciable chromatic aberration. We found that all photoreceptors in both the deepest and second-deepest layers contain a green-sensitive visual pigment, although green light is only focused on the deepest layer. This mismatch indicates that the second-deepest layer always receives defocused images, which contain depth information of the scene in optical theory. Behavioral experiments revealed that depth perception in the spider was affected by the wavelength of the illuminating light, which affects the amount of defocus in the images resulting from chromatic aberration. Therefore, we propose a depth perception mechanism based on how much the retinal image is defocused."
https://openalex.org/W2085433160,"Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a compelling synaptic correlate of learning and memory. LTP induction requires NMDA receptor (NMDAR) activation, which triggers SNARE-dependent exocytosis of AMPA receptors (AMPARs). However, the molecular mechanisms mediating AMPAR exocytosis induced by NMDAR activation remain largely unknown. Here, we show that complexin, a protein that regulates neurotransmitter release via binding to SNARE complexes, is essential for AMPAR exocytosis during LTP but not for the constitutive AMPAR exocytosis that maintains basal synaptic strength. The regulated postsynaptic AMPAR exocytosis during LTP requires binding of complexin to SNARE complexes. In hippocampal neurons, presynaptic complexin acts together with synaptotagmin-1 to mediate neurotransmitter release. However, postsynaptic synaptotagmin-1 is not required for complexin-dependent AMPAR exocytosis during LTP. These results suggest a complexin-dependent molecular mechanism for regulating AMPAR delivery to synapses, a mechanism that is surprisingly similar to presynaptic exocytosis but controlled by regulators other than synaptotagmin-1."
https://openalex.org/W2128128446,"Although transcription factors that repress gene expression play critical roles in nervous system development, their mechanism of action remains to be understood. Here, we report that the Olig-related transcription factor Bhlhb5 (also known as Bhlhe22) forms a repressor complex with the PR/SET domain protein, Prdm8. We find that Bhlhb5 binds to sequence-specific DNA elements and then recruits Prdm8, which mediates the repression of target genes. This interaction is critical for repressor function since mice lacking either Bhlhb5 or Prdm8 have strikingly similar cellular and behavioral phenotypes, including axonal mistargeting by neurons of the dorsal telencephalon and abnormal itch-like behavior. We provide evidence that Cadherin-11 functions as target of the Prdm8/Bhlhb5 repressor complex that must be repressed for proper neural circuit formation to occur. These findings suggest that Prdm8 is an obligate partner of Bhlhb5, forming a repressor complex that directs neural circuit assembly in part through the precise regulation of Cadherin-11."

This study, together with a previous study of different lunar rock, implies that a lunar core dynamo existed between 4.2 and 3.7 billion years ago, which extends the known lifetime of the lunar dynamo by 500 million years."
https://openalex.org/W2034733896,"Forest Diversification The relative role of neutral and deterministic processes in generating species richness in ecological communities (particularly tropical trees) has dominated recent discussions about patterns of diversity and abundance of species. Ricklefs and Renner (p. 464 ) present a test of random diversification and population change by comparing the numbers of individuals and species in plant families between forest plots on different continents that have diversified independently for millions of years. Stochastic theory, based on random events, predicts that there should be no correlation between the regions; however, the data reveal strong, statistically significant correlations. Thus, patterns of diversity appear to be dominated by deterministic processes."
https://openalex.org/W2161061580,"Many neurons have limited capacity to regenerate their axons after injury. Neurons in the mammalian central nervous system do not regenerate, and even neurons in the peripheral nervous system often fail to regenerate to their former targets. This failure is likely due in part to pathways that actively restrict regeneration; however, only a few factors that limit regeneration are known. Here, using single-neuron analysis of regeneration in vivo, we show that Notch/lin-12 signaling inhibits the regeneration of mature C. elegans neurons. Notch signaling suppresses regeneration by acting autonomously in the injured cell to prevent growth cone formation. The metalloprotease and gamma-secretase cleavage events that lead to Notch activation during development are also required for its activity in regeneration. Furthermore, blocking Notch activation immediately after injury improves regeneration. Our results define a postdevelopmental role for the Notch pathway as a repressor of axon regeneration in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2083982327,"Distinguishing Ciliopathy Cilia were once thought to be evolutionary remnants, but structural defects reveal their importance in signaling pathways and human disease, such as Joubert syndrome. Either of the genes TMEM138 and TMEM216 can be found mutated in phenotypically indistinguishable ciliopathy patients. Interestingly, despite their lack of sequence homology, these genes have always been aligned in head-to-tail configuration during vertebrate evolution. The proteins expressed by these genes mark distinct tethered vesicles, which differentially carry ciliary proteins for assembly. Lee et al. (p. 966 , published online 26 January; see the Perspective by Chakravarti and Kapoor ) show that the coordinated expression of these adjacent genes depends upon a coevolved regulatory element in the noncoding intergenic region, which thus integrates the roles of both gene products. This discovery explains not only the indistinguishable pathogenesis of the patients' genotypes but also how the evolutionary clustering of genes unrelated in sequence may correlate with coordinated control of expression and function."

These adaptive processes are thought to tune sensory neurons to the features they detect in the environment. In adulthood, plasticity persists in visual and somatosensory cortex chiefly in extragranular layers (LII/III and LV) (Daw et al., 1992Daw N.W. Fox K. Sato H. Czepita D.

Conversely, most of the studies on structural plasticity to date have investigated spine plasticity of LV neurons (Hofer et al., 2009Hofer S.B. Mrsic-Flogel T.D. Bonhoeffer T. Hübener M.

LV is a major output projection layer of the cortex and in the somatosensory system sends connections to a variety of subcortical targets including trigeminal, pontine, thalamic, striatal, and collicular locations as well as other cortical areas (see Fox, 2008Fox K. Barrel Cortex. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge2008Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The relative paucity of studies on LV plasticity makes it difficult both to relate spine plasticity to functional plasticity and to gain some understanding of how cortical plasticity affects intracortical circuits and subcortical targets. LV contains a major subdivision between LVa and LVb and these layers are engaged by distinct cortical circuits (Manns et al., 2004Manns I.D. Sakmann B. Brecht M.

IB cells fire bursts of spikes in response to steady somatic current injection and tend to have complex dendritic arbors and large somata. RS cells fire adapting trains of spikes in response to steady current injection and tend to have relatively simple dendritic arbors and small somata. The intracortical circuits for IB and RS cells are different (Schubert et al., 2001Schubert D. Staiger J.F. Cho N. Kötter R. Zilles K. Luhmann H.J.

Cortex. 2007; 17: 2204-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Spine plasticity also differs between the two cell types, with complex tufted cells showing greater spine plasticity in response to whisker deprivation than regular spiking cells (Holtmaat et al., 2006Holtmaat A. Wilbrecht L. Knott G.W. Welker E. Svoboda K. Experience-dependent and cell-type-specific spine growth in the neocortex.Nature. 2006; 441: 979-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, Knott et al., 2006Knott G.W. Holtmaat A. Wilbrecht L.

Therefore, as a first step to understanding LV plasticity we studied plasticity in IB and RS cells. We used extracellular spike recording to map the time course of cortical plasticity in LV of the barrel cortex of rats and mice followed by intracellular recording in vivo to measure plasticity in IB and RS cells characterized using their intrinsic firing properties. We used quantitative laser scanning photostimulation to map the circuits impinging on LVb neurons to understand the intracortical circuits contributing to the plasticity in LV. We found that plasticity was distinctly different between RS and IB cells and that the LII/III to V projections terminating on RS and IB cells are a major determinant of plasticity within the local cortical microcircuit. We measured extracellular spike responses to whisker stimulation in order to obtain an overall picture of the time course of deprivation induced plasticity in different cortical layers. Animals were age P32–45 at the start of deprivation. We recorded receptive fields of 452 single cells in four layers at 3 time points in anaesthetized Long Evans rats. Principal whisker responses were affected by D-row deprivation over the 10 day time course only in LII/III and Vb (Figure 1). A two-way ANOVA showed an effect of layer (F(3,3) = 66.5, p < 0.0001) and deprivation time (F(2,2) = 13.0, p < 0.0001) and interactions between deprivation and layer (F(6,6) = 3.7, p < 0.002) (see Table S1 available online for all post hoc t tests). LVb neurones located in deprived barrels showed the earliest depression of principal whisker responses before any other layer was affected, showing a reduction to 52% of control levels after just 3 days deprivation (t(71) = 5.3; p < 0.001). After 10 days of D-row deprivation, depression was also observed in layers II/III (reduction to 60% of control levels, t(54) = 3.1; p < 0.01). Principal whisker responses of neurones in layers IV and Va were unaffected by deprivation at any time point (two-way ANOVA, no effect of deprivation F(2,2) = 0.45, p = 0.636, nor interaction between deprivation and layer F(2,2) = 0.05, p = 0.95). We also characterized the responses to stimulation of the spared row whiskers for the same cells. Responses of spared surround whiskers were ordered from greatest to smallest for each cell (i.e., S1, S2, … S8) before averaging the responses across cells. The only cells showing clear and significant potentiation in response to D-row deprivation were located in LVa and Vb (Figure 1). A two-way ANOVA for the strongest S1 whisker response showed an effect of layer (F(3,3) = 29.2, p < 0.0001), deprivation (F(2,2) = 4.37, p < 0.02) and an interaction between layer and deprivation (F(6,6) = 7.46, p < 0.0001) and similarly for S2: layer F(3,3) = 43.3, p < 0.0001, deprivation F(2,2) = 6.9, p < 0.001, interaction F(6,6,) = 7.0, p < 0.0001) (see Table S1 for all post hoc t tests). In LVa, the S1 and S2 responses increased almost two fold at 3 days (197% and 205%, respectively) and maintained that level at 10 days (203% and 206% of control values), which was highly statistically significant (for S1, t(60) = 2.95, p < 0.005 and for S2 t(60) = 3.0, p < 0.004). In LVb, the S1 response also increased by about 2-fold at 3 days (to 201% of control) and the S2 response by 225% of control values and while both fell back slightly after 10 days of deprivation (to 163% and 183% for S1 and S2, respectively), they were still highly significantly greater than control values in both cases (for S1 t(91) = 4.0, p < 0.0001 and for S2, t(91) = 4.2, p < 0.0001). We repeated our experiments in mice to see whether the findings would generalize. We studied the receptive fields of 474 cells over identical D-row deprivation conditions (Figure 1D). Mice had slightly stronger principal whisker responses and slightly smaller surround whisker responses. Receptive field kurtosis was greater in mouse than rat in LIV (5.8 versus 5.16), LVa (3.1 versus 2.6), and LVb (2.4 versus 2.2), but not in LII/III (3.6 versus 3.8). With the notable exception of layer Va, the reaction of cells in the different cortical layers to D-row deprivation was almost identical in the two species and in particular for the main effects described for layers Vb and LII/III above (Figure 1; see Table S2 for all similarities and differences). The S1 whisker response potentiated after 3 days in mice in LVb and was the only layer to show any potentiation (Figure 1D). The response increased 190% at 3 day and 155% at 10 days both of which were highly significant (t(98) = 4.1, p < 0.0001; t(82) = 2.3, p < 0.03). The LII/III surround whisker responses showed no potentiation in either species, but the principal whisker response depressed in LII/III in mice at 10 days but not at 3 days similar to the rat (for 3 day time point t(127) = 0.35, p = 0.73; at 10 days, t(94) = 4.2, p < 0.0001). The main difference between the rat and mouse results was the plasticity in layer Va. We did not observe any potentiation of the S1 or S2 whisker response in LVa in mice whereas this effect was clear in rats (Figure 1D; Table S2). Conversely, the principal whisker showed only a minor and statistically insignificant depression in layer Va of the rat, but was clearly depressed in the mice (Figure 1D; Table S2). We concentrated on layers Va and Vb in the rat and used intracellular recording with sharp electrodes in order to identify RS and IB pyramidal cell subtypes (Figure 2A ; see Experimental Procedures). Animals were age P32–45 at the start of deprivation and recorded at 10 days after the start of deprivation. In agreement with the literature (Nowak et al., 2003Nowak L.G. Azouz R. Sanchez-Vives M.V. Gray C.M. McCormick D.A. Electrophysiological classes of cat primary visual cortical neurons in vivo as revealed by quantitative analyses.J. Neurophysiol. 2003; 89: 1541-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), RS cells (33 cells) lay uniformly in both LVa and Vb (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for depth uniformity, p > 0.6) while IB (39 cells) cells were preferentially located in LVb (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for depth uniformity, p < 0.01; Figure 2B). IB cells had higher capacitances (Figure 2A; sum of rank test p < 10−7) and displayed a stronger spike amplitude adaptation than RS cells (sum of rank test p < 10−6). Cell morphology was recovered for a subset of cells characterized by firing pattern and receptive field together with cells for which the receptive field was not determined (Figure 2C). From this data set, we found that IB cells and RS cells differed in soma diameter (t(31) = 3.80, p < 0.001), apical dendrite diameter (t(31) = 4.03, p < 0.0005), ratio between apical dendrite diameter and soma diameter (t(31) = 3.86, p < 0.001), distance between the pia and the deepest bifurcation (t(30) = 2.54, p < 0.02), and total apical dendrite length (t(30) = 3.33, p < 0.005). These observations are consistent with the idea that IB cells are likely to correspond to thick tufted and RS cells to thin slender pyramidal neurons (Chagnac-Amitai et al., 1990Chagnac-Amitai Y. Luhmann H.J. Prince D.A. Burst generating and regular spiking layer 5 pyramidal neurons of rat neocortex have different morphological features.J. Comp.

Cortex. 2007; 17: 2204-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Average membrane potential and resistance did not differ between control and deprived animals, neither for IB cells (respectively, Vm = −64.0 ± 5.1 versus 64.1 ± 8.4 mV and R = 28.4 ± 12.9 versus 27.3 ± 14.7 MΩ) nor for RS cells (Vm = −61.3 ± 4.9 versus −63.0 ± 5.5 mV and R = 28.8 ± 10.7 versus 22.3 ± 12.1 MΩ). In control animals, IB cells had greater whisker responses compared to RS cells (two-way ANOVA, F(1,1) = 24.6, p < 10−5), in agreement with (de Kock et al., 2007de Kock C.P. Bruno R.M. Spors H. Sakmann B. Layer- and cell-type-specific suprathreshold stimulus representation in rat primary somatosensory cortex.J. Physiol. 2007; 581: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). We used sparse noise stimuli applied via a nine-whisker stimulator (Jacob et al., 2010Jacob V. Estebanez L. Le Cam J. Tiercelin J.Y. Parra P. Parésys G. Shulz D.E. The Matrix: a new tool for probing the whisker-to-barrel system with natural stimuli.J. Neurosci. Methods. 2010; 189: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) to map receptive fields (Figures 3A and 3B ). Examples of LV receptive fields evaluated using peristimulus time histograms (PSTH) and whisker-evoked postsynaptic potentials (wPSP) are shown in Figure 3C (neurons 2 and 4 are D-row deprived). We found that RS and IB cells' suprathreshold receptive fields were affected differently by whisker deprivation: an ANOVA for all whisker responses confirmed a significant interaction between deprivation and cell type (F(1,1) = 5.1, p < 0.05). This was because the deprived whisker responses were depressed for RS cells (F(1,1) = 13, p < 0.001) but not for IB cells (F(1,1) = 1.0, p > 0.3), whereas spared whiskers responses were potentiated for IB cells (F(1,1) = 5.6, p < 0.02) but not for RS cells (F(1,1) = 0.2, p > 0.6). Therefore, while the in vivo intracellular recordings showed the same overall potentiation and depression components seen in the extracellular studies, remarkably the potentiation and depression components were split between IB and RS cells, respectively. To understand the derivation of the suprathreshold responses, we analyzed the time course of the wPSPs. The amplitude of the first wPSP peak, the total area of the whisker-evoked depolarization and the initial slope of the wPSP were calculated for RS and IB cells (all significant differences found are shown in Figure 4C and detailed further in Figure S1). Potentiation of the spared whisker responses in IB cells was reflected by an increase in all three parameters (peak: F(1,1) = 16.1, p < 0.0001; area: F(1,1) = 5.1, p < 0.05; slope: F(1,1) = 5.0, p < 0.05) and therefore corresponded in a simple manner with the suprathreshold responses. However, the initial slope of the wPSP was depressed for the deprived whisker response of the IB cells (F(1,1) = 6.7, p < 0.02) without an apparent concomitant change in the suprathreshold response (Figures 4B and 4C). Depression of the deprived whisker responses in RS cells was reflected in a decrease in the area of the wPSP depolarization (F(1,1) = 5.8, p < 0.02). This was the only parameter that changed for the deprived whisker response and shows that a change in area of the wPSP is sufficient for a decrease in surprathreshold response. Consistent with this idea, the IB cells showed no decrease in area and no decrease in surprathreshold response. The changes in the subthreshold responses to spared whisker stimulation for the RS cells were more complex and to some extent cancelled each other out. While the slope of the wPSP increased significantly (F(1,1) = 11.4, p < 0.001) the wPSP area decreased significantly (F(1,1) = 6.6, p < 0.02). While this has implications for the timing of the response as described in the next section, it had no overall effect on the suprathreshold responses (Figure 4B). The initial slope of the wPSP reflects the activity of the first inputs to activate the cell following whisker stimulation and was correlated with the early but not the late evoked spikes (early: <15 ms after stimulation, linear regression from PW response r2 = 0.17, p < 0.001; late: >15 ms after stimulation, r2 = 0.03, p > 0.15). In contrast, the area of the wPSP was correlated with the late (r2 = 0.14, p < 0.002) but not the early evoked spikes (r2 = 0.02, p > 0.2). The wPSP amplitude peak occurred on average at 12 ms after stimulation for the PW and 18ms for S1 and was best correlated with the total spike count (r2 = 0.22, p < 10−4). Further analysis revealed that deprivation produced corresponding changes in wPSPs slope and early evoked spikes on the one hand and between depolarization area and late evoked spikes on the other (Figure S1). Indeed, an increase in wPSPs slope and a decrease in depolarization area for RS cells corresponded to a concomitant increase of the early component (F(1,1) = 5.3, p < 0.05) and decrease of the late component (F(1,1) = 3.9, p < 0.05) of the suprathreshold response. A decrease in the initial slope for the IB cells appeared to correspond to a decrease in the early component of the suprathreshold response, but this was not statistically significant (F(1,1) = 3.9, p = 0.051; Figure S1). Because the early or late components of the response are only fractions of the total response, significant changes in either component could be diluted (as with the trimmed whisker responses in IB cells) or cancelled out because they changed in opposite directions (as for spared whisker responses in RS cells) so that total spike count was not affected significantly. We found that a simple integrate and fire model applied to the subthreshold activity was sufficient to explain deprivation-induced changes in suprathreshold activity. The membrane voltage distribution was shifted by the amount of depolarization (method 1) or recalculated for each time step around stimulation (method 2). The probability of firing was then calculated and used to create a predicted PSTH, which could be compared to the real PSTHs (see Figure S2). The exact shapes of the PSTHs were not closely reproduced for IB cells, but the effects of sensory deprivation were. The complex time-specific modifications observed for RS cells were also reproduced by the model. In conclusion, changes observed in suprathreshold activity directly reflected changes at the subthreshold level, which implies that synaptic and not spike generation mechanism explain the observed plasticity. As whisker deprivation affected the timing as well as the amplitude of the responses to whisker stimulation, we analyzed the time course of response for RS and IB cells. Figure 5 represents averaged wPSPs and PSTHs for one trimmed and one spared whisker only. Note that the early spikes (<15 ms poststimulus) were significantly depressed for PW stimulation in the IB cell population (t(38) = 3.2, p < 0.005; see Figure S1), but not for the other trimmed whiskers, as revealed in Figure 5A. The potentiation in IB cells and the depression in RS cells appear to be roughly uniform throughout the whole time course of the response. In contrast, depression of PW responses in IB cells was greater in the early part of the response (<30 ms poststimulus). Similarly for RS cells, the best spared whisker was potentiated for the early part of the response (<25 ms poststimulus) but depressed for the late component. The latter observation held when all the spared whiskers were considered. We quantified the area of the subthreshold response in four time windows (0–25; 25–50; 50–75; 75–100 ms poststimulus) and the suprathreshold response in three time-windows (0–15; 15–30; 30–45 ms poststimulus). RS cells' response to spared whisker stimulation displayed a significant interaction between deprivation and time both for suprathreshold (F(2,2) = 6.8, p < 0.005) and subthreshold (F(3,3) = 5.5, p < 0.005) parameters. These data suggest that the early component of the response can be potentiated (as with the RS cells) or depressed (as with the IB cells) independently of later components of the wPSP. Latency and jitter of evoked action potentials are important temporal parameters for coding sensory information. Figure 5 shows sub- and suprathreshold latency and jitter of the first action potential following stimulation for the PW and S1 (see Figure S1 for all whiskers). Both RS and IB cells' latency and jitter were affected by deprivation in an inverse complementary way. For IB cells, latency (F(1,1) = 16.6, p < 2.10−4) and jitter (F(1,1) = 11.2, p < 0.002) of the suprathreshold response to the deprived whiskers were increased, but were unchanged for the spared whiskers (latency, F(1,1) = 0.18, p > 0.6; jitter, F(1,1) = 0.001, p > 0.9). For RS cells, deprivation did not affect the temporal information in the response to stimulation of the deprived whiskers (latency, F(1,1) = 1.04, p > 0.3; F(1,1) = 0.006, jitter, p > 0.9), but both latency (F(1,1) = 7.6, p < 0.01) and jitter (F(1,1) = 15.0, p < 0.001) of action potentials evoked by deflections of the spared whiskers were decreased. Action potential rate and jitter can therefore change independently and did so in opposite directions for the different inputs to RS and IB cells. Finally, the rate of spontaneous activity preceding stimulation was also affected by deprivation (Figure 5). We observed a significant decrease for RS cells (10.6 ± 2.2 versus 3.9 ± 1.6 Hz, t(30) = 2.5, p < 0.05) but not for IB cells (11.8 ± 1.9 versus 16.0 ± 2.3 Hz, t(38) = 1.4, p > 0.1). To understand which intracortical pathways might give rise to these different components of plasticity, we studied the synaptic responses of LV neurons in whisker deprived mice ex vivo using laser scanning photo stimulation. As LVa showed no potentiation in mice we concentrated the study on LVb. We analyzed barrel cortex circuits in brain slices cut across barrel rows (Allen et a"

However, due to the lack of reagents for precise delivery of peptides within dense brain tissue, the spatiotemporal scale over which neuropeptides act is unknown. To achieve rapid and spatially delimited delivery of neuropeptides in mammalian brain tissue, we developed photoactivatable analogs of two opioids: [Leu⁵]-enkephalin (LE) and the 8 amino acid form of Dynorphin A (Dyn-8). These peptides are functionally inactive prior to photolysis, and exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light causes clean release of LE and Dyn-8. Recordings from acute slices of rat locus coeruleus (LC) demonstrated that photorelease of LE activates mu opioid receptor-coupled K+ channels with kinetics that approach the limits imposed by G protein-mediated signaling. Temporally precise and spatially delimited photorelease revealed the kinetics and ionic nature of the mu opioid response and the mechanisms that determine the spatial profile of enkephalinergic volume transmission in LC."
https://openalex.org/W2140066802,"Atovaquone is an anti-malarial drug used in combination with proguanil (e.g. Malarone(TM)) for the curative and prophylactic treatment of malaria. Atovaquone, a 2-hydroxynaphthoquinone, is a competitive inhibitor of the quinol oxidation (Q(o)) site of the mitochondrial cytochrome bc(1) complex. Inhibition of this enzyme results in the collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential, disruption of pyrimidine biosynthesis, and subsequent parasite death. Resistance to atovaquone in the field is associated with point mutations in the Q(o) pocket of cytochrome b, most notably near the conserved Pro(260)-Glu(261)-Trp(262)-Tyr(263) (PEWY) region in the ef loop). The effect of this mutation has been extensively studied in model organisms but hitherto not in the parasite itself. Here, we have performed a molecular and biochemical characterization of an atovaquone-resistant field isolate, TM902CB. Molecular analysis of this strain reveals the presence of the Y268S mutation in cytochrome b. The Y268S mutation is shown to confer a 270-fold shift of the inhibitory constant (K(i)) for atovaquone with a concomitant reduction in the V(max) of the bc(1) complex of ∼40% and a 3-fold increase in the observed K(m) for decylubiquinol. Western blotting analyses reveal a reduced iron-sulfur protein content in Y268S bc(1) suggestive of a weakened interaction between this subunit and cytochrome b. Gene expression analysis of the TM902CB strain reveals higher levels of expression, compared with the 3D7 (atovaquone-sensitive) control strain in bc(1) and cytochrome c oxidase genes. It is hypothesized that the observed differential expression of these and other key genes offsets the fitness cost resulting from reduced bc(1) activity."
https://openalex.org/W2013136684,"Neurons often integrate information from multiple parallel signaling streams. How a neuron combines these inputs largely determines its computational role in signal processing. Experimental assessment of neuronal signal integration, however, is often confounded by cell-intrinsic nonlinear processes that arise after signal integration has taken place. To overcome this problem and determine how ganglion cells in the salamander retina integrate visual contrast over space, we used automated online analysis of recorded spike trains and closed-loop control of the visual stimuli to identify different stimulus patterns that give the same neuronal response. These iso-response stimuli revealed a threshold-quadratic transformation as a fundamental nonlinearity within the receptive field center. Moreover, for a subset of ganglion cells, the method revealed an additional dynamic nonlinearity that renders these cells particularly sensitive to spatially homogeneous stimuli. This function is shown to arise from a local inhibition-mediated dynamic gain control mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2006148647,"PGC-1α is an inducible transcriptional coactivator that regulates cellular energy metabolism and adaptation to environmental and nutritional stimuli. In tissues expressing PGC-1α, alternative splicing produces a truncated protein (NT-PGC-1α) corresponding to the first 267 amino acids of PGC-1α. Brown adipose tissue also expresses two novel exon 1b-derived isoforms of PGC-1α and NT-PGC-1α, which are 4 and 13 amino acids shorter in the N termini than canonical PGC-1α and NT-PGC-1α, respectively. To evaluate the ability of NT-PGC-1α to substitute for PGC-1α and assess the isoform-specific role of NT-PGC-1α, adaptive thermogenic responses of adipose tissue were evaluated in mice lacking full-length PGC-1α (FL-PGC-1−/−) but expressing slightly shorter but functionally equivalent forms of NT-PGC-1α (NT-PGC-1α254). At room temperature, NT-PGC-1α and NT-PGC-1α254 were produced from conventional exon 1a-derived transcripts in brown adipose tissue of wild type and FL-PGC-1α−/− mice, respectively. However, cold exposure shifted transcription to exon 1b, increasing exon 1b-derived mRNA levels. The resulting transcriptional responses produced comparable increases in energy expenditure and maintenance of core body temperature in WT and FL-PGC-1α−/− mice. Moreover, treatment of the two genotypes with a selective β3-adrenergic receptor agonist produced similar increases in energy expenditure, mitochondrial DNA, and reductions in adiposity. Collectively, these findings illustrate that the transcriptional and physiological responses to sympathetic input are unabridged in FL-PGC-1α−/− mice, and that NT-PGC-1α is sufficient to link β3-androgenic receptor activation to adaptive thermogenesis in adipose tissue. Furthermore, the transcriptional shift from exon 1a to 1b supports isoform-specific roles for NT-PGC-1α in basal and adaptive thermogenesis. PGC-1α is an inducible transcriptional coactivator that regulates cellular energy metabolism and adaptation to environmental and nutritional stimuli. In tissues expressing PGC-1α, alternative splicing produces a truncated protein (NT-PGC-1α) corresponding to the first 267 amino acids of PGC-1α. Brown adipose tissue also expresses two novel exon 1b-derived isoforms of PGC-1α and NT-PGC-1α, which are 4 and 13 amino acids shorter in the N termini than canonical PGC-1α and NT-PGC-1α, respectively. To evaluate the ability of NT-PGC-1α to substitute for PGC-1α and assess the isoform-specific role of NT-PGC-1α, adaptive thermogenic responses of adipose tissue were evaluated in mice lacking full-length PGC-1α (FL-PGC-1−/−) but expressing slightly shorter but functionally equivalent forms of NT-PGC-1α (NT-PGC-1α254). At room temperature, NT-PGC-1α and NT-PGC-1α254 were produced from conventional exon 1a-derived transcripts in brown adipose tissue of wild type and FL-PGC-1α−/− mice, respectively. However, cold exposure shifted transcription to exon 1b, increasing exon 1b-derived mRNA levels. The resulting transcriptional responses produced comparable increases in energy expenditure and maintenance of core body temperature in WT and FL-PGC-1α−/− mice. Moreover, treatment of the two genotypes with a selective β3-adrenergic receptor agonist produced similar increases in energy expenditure, mitochondrial DNA, and reductions in adiposity. Collectively, these findings illustrate that the transcriptional and physiological responses to sympathetic input are unabridged in FL-PGC-1α−/− mice, and that NT-PGC-1α is sufficient to link β3-androgenic receptor activation to adaptive thermogenesis in adipose tissue. Furthermore, the transcriptional shift from exon 1a to 1b supports isoform-specific roles for NT-PGC-1α in basal and adaptive thermogenesis. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) plays a central role in mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation (1.Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R.

In each of these cellular contexts, the function of PGC-1α is regulated by signaling inputs that increase transcription of the PGC-1α gene and activity of expressed protein. This allows PGC-1α to function as an inducible conduit that links environmental and nutritional stimuli to tissue-specific transcriptional programs of cellular adaptation. Alternative splicing of PGC-1α between exons 6 and 7 produces an additional transcript that codes for a shorter isoform of the gene called NT-PGC-1α (10.Zhang Y. Huypens P. Adamson A.W. Chang J.S.

The expressed protein includes the first 267 amino acids of PGC-1α and three additional amino acids from the inserted intron. Cold-induced transcriptional activation of the PGC-1α gene produces a comparable increase in the mRNAs for PGC-1α and NT-PGC-1α in adipose tissue (10.Zhang Y. Huypens P. Adamson A.W. Chang J.S.

Both PGC-1α isoforms are transcriptionally active, but because the proteins are co-expressed, the specific role of NT-PGC-1α in the overall function of PGC-1α remains uncertain. Mice lacking PGC-1α were produced by two groups using different targeting strategies (12.Lin J. Wu P.H. Tarr P.T. Lindenberg K.S. St-Pierre J. Zhang C.Y. Mootha V.K. Jäger S. Vianna C.R. Reznick R.M.

Evaluation of their respective phenotypes revealed many similarities, but several interesting differences emerged with respect to brown fat morphology and thermogenic responses to cold. For example, in the null line produced by Lin et al. (12.Lin J. Wu P.H. Tarr P.T. Lindenberg K.S. St-Pierre J. Zhang C.Y. Mootha V.K. Jäger S. Vianna C.R. Reznick R.M. Cui L. Manieri M. Donovan M.X.

Of particular interest was the finding that the mice were cold-sensitive for ∼2 weeks after weaning, whereas slightly older null mice (42–77 days of age) were cold-tolerant (13.Leone T.C. Lehman J.J.

The frameshift generated a premature termination codon at amino acid 255, which effectively blocked expression of full-length PGC-1α (FL-PGC-1α). However, the question of whether these FL-PGC-1α−/− mice retained the ability to express a truncated PGC-1α protein from the imputed transcript was not established (13.Leone T.C. Lehman J.J.

At room temperature, expressed protein in BAT is produced from a conventional exon 1 (exon 1a)-derived transcript, whereas acute cold exposure shifts transcription to the recently identified alternative exon 1 (exon 1b), producing new exon 1b-derived transcripts (14.Miura S.

Using a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches, we show that NT-PGC-1α254 is functionally equivalent to NT-PGC-1α and that the cold-induced isoforms of NT-PGC-1α254 effectively couple β-adrenergic receptors to the in vivo components of adaptive thermogenesis. brown adipose tissue β3-androgenic receptor dibutyryl cyclic AMP energy expenditure body weight ligand binding domain peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor PPAR response element epididymal white adipose tissue inguinal white adipose tissue retroperitoneal white adipose tissue DNA-binding domain estrogen-related receptor long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase.

All experiments were performed using 8- or 10-week-old male C57BL/6J mice that are homozygous for the wild type allele (WT) and FL-PGC-1α−/− genotype. For cold exposure experiments, WT and FL-PGC-1α−/− mice were singly housed and placed at 4 °C for 5 h. Core rectal temperature was measured at baseline and every 1 h over the 5-h period as described previously (15.Hasek B.E. Stewart L.K. Henagan T.M. Boudreau A. Lenard N.R. Black C. Shin J. Huypens P.

Following the 5-h cold exposure, mice were rapidly euthanized, and tissues were harvested for RNA and protein isolation. To conduct metabolic phenotyping, eight WT and FL-PGC-1α−/− mice were provided a low fat (10 kcal % fat) diet (D12450B, Research Diets, Inc., New Brunswick, NJ) ad libitum for 2 weeks. Thereafter, mice were weighed, and their body composition was determined by NMR using a Bruker Mouse Minispec (Bruker Optics, Billerica, MA) prior to transfer of the mice into indirect calorimetry chambers. After an overnight acclimation, oxygen consumption (VO2) was monitored at 18-min intervals for 7 days using a Comprehensive Laboratory Animal Monitoring System (CLAMS) (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH). Physical activity was monitored using an OPTO-M3 sensor system while the mice were in the chamber. After 3 days in the chamber, mice were switched to the same low fat diet but formulated by Research Diets, Inc. (New Brunswick, NJ) to contain 0.001% CL316,243 as described previously (16.Surwit R.S.

Thereafter, body weight and composition were determined prior to harvest of brown and white adipose tissue. Energy expenditure was calculated as {VO2 × [3.815 + (1.232 × RQ)] × 4.187} and expressed as either kilojoules per hour per kilogram body weight or per kilogram fat free mass for analysis. In a separate cohort of age-matched WT and FL-PGC-1α−/− mice, morphological remodeling of brown and white adipose tissue was assessed after consumption of the CL316,243-containing low fat diet for 6 days. pcDNA3.1-NT-PGC-1α-HA has been described previously (10.Zhang Y.

However, the molecular mechanism underlying this transcriptional response to stress is not well understood. Using various stress paradigms in mouse and zebrafish, we show that the hypothalamic transcription factor Orthopedia modulates the expression of CRH as well as the splicing factor Ataxin 2-Binding Protein-1 (A2BP1/Rbfox-1). We further show that the G protein coupled receptor PAC1, which is a known A2BP1/Rbfox-1 splicing target and an important mediator of CRH activity, is alternatively spliced in response to a stressful challenge. The generation of PAC1-hop messenger RNA isoform by alternative splicing is required for termination of CRH transcription, normal activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and adaptive anxiety-like behavior. Our study identifies an evolutionarily conserved biochemical pathway that modulates the neuronal adaptation to stress through transcriptional activation and alternative splicing."

The failure rate for drugs in clinical development is still startlingly high despite unprecedented investment in RD many compounds are shown to be safe and to engage the intended target but do not improve the primary indication. This failure stems from the simplistic ways in which we have historically studied potential drug targets for complex diseases and indicates a need for more innovative approaches to identify causal relationships between molecular entities and disease. Biology is rapidly changing and becoming a technology and data-intensive science with the development of new instrumentation to measure various molecular states in greater detail. Herein lays an opportunity to transform our understanding of the molecular underpinnings of disease and develop modeling frameworks that can describe complex systems and predict their behavior. Without these models acting as maps, biologists risk drowning in an ever-growing sea of data. This vision for biology, to use large-scale data to model disease, reflects parallel developments in other scientific disciplines: for example, modeling future trends in climate based on complex meteorological information in atmospheric science. The term fourth paradigm has been coined for this “data intensive” science discovery to distinguish it from empiric, theoretical and computational approaches 3"
https://openalex.org/W1976986649,"Actin cytoskeletal remodeling plays a critical role in transforming the morphology of subcellular structures across various cell types. In the brain, restructuring of dendritic spines through actin cytoskeleletal reorganization is implicated in the regulation of synaptic efficacy and the storage of information in neural circuits. However, the upstream pathways that provoke actin-based spine changes remain only partly understood. Here we show that EphA receptor signaling remodels spines by triggering a sequence of events involving actin filament rearrangement and synapse/spine reorganization. Rapid EphA signaling over minutes activates the actin filament depolymerizing/severing factor cofilin, alters F-actin distribution in spines, and causes transient spine elongation through the phosphatases slingshot 1 (SSH1) and calcineurin/protein phosphatase 2B (PP2B). This early phase of spine extension is followed by synaptic reorganization events that take place over minutes to hours and involve the relocation of pre/postsynaptic components and ultimately spine retraction. Thus, EphA receptors utilize discrete cellular and molecular pathways to promote actin-based structural plasticity of excitatory synapses.

The refinement of neural circuits through synaptic remodeling and turnover is believed to play a critical role in brain plasticity (1.Kasai H. Fukuda M. Watanabe S. Hayashi-Takagi A. Noguchi J.

Structural dynamics of dendritic spines in memory and cognition.Trends Neurosci. 2010; 33: 121-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Spines are the main site of excitatory synapses and vary in morphology and size. They typically have an enlarged head that is connected to the dendrite shaft by a constricted neck. This architecture helps compartmentalize ion channels, scaffolding proteins, and other signaling components at postsynaptic sites (10.Sheng M. Hoogenraad C.C. The postsynaptic architecture of excitatory synapses. A more quantitative view.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 823-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar).

Thus, reconfiguring the properties of spines is an important feature of neurons and likely required for the storage of information at synapses. A complex network of signaling pathways impinge upon the actin cytoskeletal framework of spines to govern their structural dynamics and molecular composition (15.Matus A.

This equilibrium is readjusted by synaptic activity (11.Okamoto K. Nagai T. Miyawaki A. Hayashi Y.

Thus, reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton is important for spine remodeling and associated changes in synaptic strength. long term potentiation Semliki Forest virus farnesylated enhanced green fluorescent protein days in vitro analysis of variance. The actin cytoskeleton in neurons is organized through a multitude of pathways including those downstream of Rho GTPases, Arp2/3, and other molecules (16.Hotulainen P. Hoogenraad C.C. Actin in dendritic spines. Connecting dynamics to function.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 189: 619-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Several proteins in these signaling pathways have robust effects on the morphogenesis and maintenance of spines. Among these proteins, cofilin/ADF (actin-depolymerization factor) family proteins bind, depolymerize, and sever actin filaments (22.Bamburg J.R. Proteins of the ADF/cofilin family. Essential regulators of actin dynamics.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 185-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar) and play an important role in spine remodeling (23.Racz B.

Defining mechanisms of actin polymerization and depolymerization during dendritic spine morphogenesis.J. Cell Biol. 2009; 185: 323-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The activity of cofilin is directly regulated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events. Phosphorylation of serine 3 of cofilin by Lim kinases (LimKs) and Tes kinases inactivates cofilin, whereas dephosphorylation by Slingshot and chronophin reactivates it (27.Bernstein B.W. Bamburg J.R.

Homma K.J. Poo M.M. Shrinkage of dendritic spines associated with long-term depression of hippocampal synapses.Neuron. 2004; 44: 749-757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). Temporal regulation of cofilin phosphorylation also plays a critical role in glutamate receptor trafficking during LTP (30.Gu J. Lee C.W. Fan Y. Komlos D. Tang X. Sun C. Yu K. Hartzell H.C. Chen G. Bamburg J.R. Zheng J.Q. ADF/cofilin-mediated actin dynamics regulate AMPA receptor trafficking during synaptic plasticity.Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 1208-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Thus, cofilin is an integral component of cytoskeletal remodeling in spines and synaptic regulation. However, the upstream receptors and signaling proteins that recruit cofilin and coordinate its ability to stabilize/destabilize F-actin in spines remain poorly understood. Eph receptors are one class of proteins that trigger changes in spine morphology (31.Klein R. Bidirectional modulation of synaptic functions by Eph/ephrin signaling.Nat.

Roles of ephrin/Eph receptor signaling.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2009; 19: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Eph receptors comprise a family of receptor tyrosine kinases that are activated by ligands known as ephrins. In general, ephrin-As and ephrin-Bs bind and activate EphAs and EphBs, respectively, with some exceptions (34.Murai K.K. Pasquale E.B. 'Eph'ective signaling. Forward, reverse and crosstalk.J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2823-2832Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Ephs activate factors that regulate actin cytoskeletal reorganization (20.Ethell I.M. Pasquale E.B. Molecular mechanisms of dendritic spine development and remodeling.Prog. Neurobiol. 2005; 75: 161-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). For example, EphBs promote spine development and increase spine stability following their maturation through members of Rho family of small GTPases (25.Shi Y. Pontrello C.G. DeFea K.A. Reichardt L.F.

However, the precise mechanisms that enable EphAs to directly affect the actin cytoskeleton and facilitate spine remodeling are not well understood. Here we show that EphA signaling engages a series of events that promote actin, spine, and synaptic reorganization. We found that EphA signaling elicits rapid activation of the actin filament depolymerizing/severing factor cofilin (22.Bamburg J.R. Proteins of the ADF/cofilin family. Essential regulators of actin dynamics.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 185-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar) through the phosphatase slingshot 1 (SSH1) (42.Niwa R. Nagata-Ohashi K. Takeichi M. Mizuno K. Uemura T. Control of actin reorganization by Slingshot, a family of phosphatases that dephosphorylate ADF/cofilin.Cell. 2002; 108: 233-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar) and the upstream activator calcineurin/PP2B (43.Winder D.G. Sweatt J.D. Roles of serine/threonine phosphatases in hippocampal synaptic plasticity.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 461-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Both SSH1 and calcineurin are required for EphA-induced actin filament and spine remodeling. Remarkably, EphA signaling causes an initial phase of spine elongation that is followed by synapse reorganization and ultimately spine retraction. This study uncovers a novel molecular pathway utilized by EphAs to restructure excitatory synaptic connections and reveals the time course for these reorganization events. Animal procedures were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Canadian Council for Animal Care and the Montreal General Hospital Facility Animal Care Committee. Full-length V5-tagged, human Slingshot 1 (SSHwt) and a phosphatase-inactive mutant (C393S; now referred to as SSH(CS)) were cloned into pcDNA3 (44.Hsieh S.H. Ferraro G.B. Fournier A.E.

A custom rabbit polyclonal antibody was raised against a synthesized peptide containing a sequence of 16 amino acids of SSH1 (KSAPEHLKSPSRVNKS) that covers a partially conserved region in both human and mouse SSH1 but not retained in SSH2 or SSH3. Antibodies for the following proteins were also used: cofilin (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), phospho-cofilin (Cell Signaling Technology), GAPDH (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), PSD-95 (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ), synapsin I (Synaptic Systems, Goettingen, Germany), V5 (Sigma), and control mouse IgGs (Jackson Immunochemicals, West Grove, PA). Actin filaments were detected using Alexa 568 phalloidin (Invitrogen).

Briefly, the hippocampal astrocyte feeder layer was prepared by plating mouse astrocytes 5 days before neuronal dissection in astrocyte medium (minimal essential medium containing Earle's salts and l-glutamine supplemented with 10% horse serum, 0.6% glucose and 1% penicillin/streptomycin) (Invitrogen). 24 h prior to dissection, the medium was replaced with Neurobasal-ATM medium supplemented with 2% B27, 1 mm GlutaMAXTM, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Hippocampal neurons were dissociated by papain treatment (0.1% papain, 0.02% BSA in Neurobasal-ATM medium) followed by trituration with a fire-polished glass pipette in Neurobasal-ATM medium containing trypsin inhibitor (1%) (Sigma) and BSA (1%). The neurons were then plated on coverslips and transferred to dishes containing the astrocyte feeder layers after 3 h. To visualize dendritic spines, F-actin, and synaptic punctae in primary hippocampal neurons, 13-day-old neurons were infected with Semliki Forest virus expressing EGFP-f only or SSH(CS) and EGFP-f. The next day, neurons were either pretreated with FK506 for 10 min or directly treated with Fc or ephrin-A3 Fc for the times indicated. The neurons were washed with ice-cold PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1 m phosphate buffer, 4% sucrose for 10 min. The cells were permeabilized following fixation in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and immunolabeled with antibodies in 5% BSA/PBS against PSD-95 (1:100) and synapsin (1:300) as indicated. After three washes in PBS, primary antibodies were revealed with a 1-h incubation with Alexa Fluor secondary antibodies (1:300, 5% BSA/PBS) and confocal microscopy. For visualization of F-actin, Alexa 568 phalloidin (1:50) was added to the secondary antibody incubation step. All of the measurements described below were obtained using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). For measurement of synaptic punctae, RGB overlays of red (synapsin) and green (PSD-95) images (channels were separately thresholded to exclude background noise) were used. Colocalization masks were generated using the “RG2B colocalization” ImageJ plugin (using default parameters) and then overlaid with EGFP-f images to visualize the dendrites and spines. ImageJ was used to measure dendritic spine density, length, synaptic punctae size, and distance from the dendritic shaft. For measurements of F-actin cluster size, intensity, and circularity, the images were cropped and thresholded in ImageJ. “Analyze particles” was used to obtain measurements of F-actin punctae size, intensity, and circularity. For measuring fluorescence intensity changes along a spine, a line was drawn across a spine, and the fluorescence intensity of the signal in each channel was measured in ImageJ. The spine head, neck, and dendritic shaft regions were approximated using the EGFP-f label. Organotypic hippocampal slices were prepared as described (38.Zhou L. Martinez S.J. Haber M. Jones E.V. Bouvier D. Doucet G. Corera A.T. Fon E.A. Zisch A.H. Murai K.K. EphA4 signaling regulates phospholipase Cgamma1 activation, cofilin membrane association, and dendritic spine morphology.J.

Methods. 1991; 37: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2529) Google Scholar). Briefly, 300-μm slices from postnatal day 5 mouse pups were made using a McIllwain tissue chopper (Stoelting, Kiel, WI) and transferred onto semi-porous tissue culture inserts (0.4-μm pore size; Millipore, Billerica, MA) containing medium (50% minimum essential medium, 25% horse serum, 25% Hanks' balanced salt solution, 6.5 mg/ml d-glucose, 0.5% penicillin/streptomycin, pH ∼7.2). The medium was replaced every 2 days, and slices were cultured for 1 week prior to viral gene delivery. 16–20 h post-infection, the slices were fixed and mounted for confocal imaging or subjected to immunofluorescence using anti-V5 antibodies. For expressing SSH1 constructs and fluorescent proteins in hippocampal slices, SFV constructs were created using established techniques (50.Ehrengruber M.U. Lundstrom K. Schweitzer C. Heuss C. Schlesinger S. Gähwiler B.H. Recombinant Semliki Forest virus and Sindbis virus efficiently infect neurons in hippocampal slice cultures.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Neurosci. 2006; 26: 8881-8891Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Viral particles were created by cotransfecting SFV vectors (see DNA constructs section for plasmids used) with a viral packaging vector into baby hamster kidney cells (52.DiCiommo D.P. Bremner R. Rapid, high level protein production using DNA-based Semliki Forest virus vectors.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18060-18066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). 72 h following transfection, the cell medium was removed and purified on a sucrose gradient (20%, 55% w/v) by ultracentrifugation. Viral particles were collected and diluted with PBS and concentrated using a filter column (Millipore) and low speed centrifugation. Viral particles were reconstituted in ice-cold PBS, activated with chymotrypsin (10 mg/ml), and treated with aprotinin (10 mg/ml). SFV particles were injected into hippocampal slices with a Picospritzer (Parker Hannifin, Cleveland, OH) or directly apply to culture medium (for dissociated hippocampal neuronal cultures). Confocal imaging of spine morphology in dissociated hippocampal neurons and slices was performed as previously described using a Nikon Eclipse TE-2000 microscope with either a Plan Fluor 20× (0.45 N.A.) or Plan Fluor 60× (1.25 N.A.) objective connected to a Ultraview Spinning Disc confocal system (38.Zhou L.

For imaging in organotypic slices, images of dendrites were taken for each condition (control, SSHwt, or SSH(CS)) from at least three independent experiments. Each image contained a Z-stack maximum projection of a primary apical dendrite from a CA1 pyramidal cell taken ∼100 μm from the cell body. All of the images were normalized for EGFP-f signal intensity using Adobe Photoshop. Geometric measurements of spine parameters (total length, head length, head width, neck length, neck width, spine area, spine density) were acquired using the Reconstruct computer program. All spine analysis was performed by an investigator blind to the experimental conditions. The siRNA duplexes composed of 21-bp sense and antisense oligonucleotides were purchased from Qiagen along with Allstars negative control siRNAs. The sequences of siRNA for mouse SSH1 used were GGC UUG UUU GCG UAC CAU ATT and CGU UUA GAU CAC ACC AGU ATT. HT22 cells were transfected with 30 pm SSH1 siRNAs or control siRNAs using HiPerFect (Qiagen), and protein knockdown was determined after 72 h. For HT22 cell experiments, the cells (∼80% confluency) were serum-starved for 1 h befo"

https://openalex.org/W2058194510,"Intuition tells us that perceptual experience—the seamless flow of conscious images of vision, sound, touch, and so forth—reflects the external world. Accordingly, information flow along the brain's sensory pathways has been thought to follow a caudo-rostral direction, away from the ports of entry, toward integrative cortices in the anterior parts of the frontal and temporal lobes. However, this view of a unidirectional, “bottom-up” processing cascade is challenged by findings which suggest that there is also information transfer in the opposite, “top-down” direction, from association areas toward early sensory cortices. A particularly intriguing observation is that while the initial bottom-up activation sweep along the sensory pathways can accomplish stimulus processing of considerable complexity and yield certain automated behaviors, conscious awareness of a sensory object appears to depend on top-down signals (1–3), as observed in the visual (4), auditory (5), and somatosensory (6) systems. Why is this the case?"

https://openalex.org/W2074872437,"Only 28% of the U.S. adult population is considered scientifically literate. Although this is the second highest among 35 developed countries, a fact attributed to postsecondary science requirements ( 1 ), it should not be considered satisfactory, and improvement is critical to our future. A trend of many U.S. colleges and universities is to offer courses for nonmajors that cover a wide range of material via lectures, with few opportunities for students to engage in hands-on learning. This is particularly disturbing given that “a growing body of science educators has found that students' attitudes toward science, their motivation for learning, and their conceptual development … can all be enhanced by engagement in real scientific investigations” ( 2 )."
