https://openalex.org/W1965723431,"We chemically synthesized 20 peptides corresponding to 75% of the HA1 molecule of the influenza virus. Antibodies to the majority (18) of these peptides were capable of reacting with the hemagglutinin molecule. These 18 peptides are not confined to the known antigenic determinants of the hemagglutinin molecule, but rather are scattered throughout its three-dimensional structure. In contrast, antibody raised to intact hemagglutinin did not react with any of the 20 peptides. Taken together these results suggest that the immunogenicity of an intact protein molecule is not the sum of the immunogenicity of its pieces."

Fluorescence intensities of single BALB/c 3T3 mouse fibroblasts were measured by using a microscope spectrofluorometer with narrow bandpass excitation filters. The pH was determined from the ratio of fluorescein fluorescence intensities with 450 nm and 490 nm excitation. A standard pH curve was obtained by incubating cells with F-alpha 2M for 30 min at 37 degrees C followed by fixation and incubation in buffers of varying pH. To measure the pH of endocytic vesicles, cells were incubated with F-alpha 2M for 15 min at 37 degrees C. Fluorescence intensities were measured on living cells within 5 min of rinsing. Under these conditions, the pH of the F-alpha 2M microenvironment was 5.0 +/- 0.2. Using colloidal gold-alpha 2M for electron microscopic localizations we have verified that, under these conditions, alpha 2M is predominantly in uncoated vesicles that are negative for acid phosphatase activity. With further incubation for 1/2 hr, we obtained a pH of 5.0 +/- 0.2 for the F-alpha 2M. Using fluorescein dextran, we obtained a lysosomal pH of 4.6 +/- 0.2. These results indicate that endocytic vesicles become acidic prior to fusion with lysosomes."

This line, designated HEL, is capable of spontaneous and induced globin synthesis, producing mainly Gγ and Aγ chains. Embryonic chains (ε, ζ) and α chains are detectable in very small amounts; β chains are undetectable. This line provides a new model system for studying aspects of erythroid cell differentiation and differential globin gene expression."

It was shown to be alpha-interferon by neutralization with specific antiserums, affinity column chromatography, and antiviral activity on bovine cells. However, 23 of 30 interferon samples tested were inactivated by incubation at pH 2, a characteristic of human ""immune,"" or gamma, interferon. Multiple samples of interferon from the same patient had similar biological properties, but samples from different patients were not all identical, suggesting that several variants of this species of human alpha-interferon may exist."

The finding of separate and alternating ipsilateral and contralateral inputs in the frontal association cortex opens up new possibilities for the functional analysis of this large but unexplored area of the primate brain."
https://openalex.org/W1502799818,"The interactions of dopaminergic agonists and antagonists with binding sites in bovine anterior pituitary membranes have been investigated with radioligand-binding techniques and computer-modeling procedures. 3H-labeled agonist binding is stereospecific, reversible, saturable, and of high affinity. The rank order of catecholamines, phenothiazines, and related drugs in competing for 3H-agonist binding is indicative of interactions with a D-2 dopamine receptor. Both agonist/3H-agonist and antagonist/3H-agonist competition curves are monophasic and noncooperative (nH = 1) with computer analysis indicating a single class of binding sites. Specific 3H-agonist binding can be completely inhibited by guanine nucleotides. GppNHp us the most potent nucleotide followed by GTP and GDP which are equipotent. The equilibrium binding capacity for 3H-labeled antagonists is twice that for 3H-agonists. Unlabeled antagonists inhibit 3H-antagonist binding competitively and exhibit antagonist/3H-antagonist competition curves which model best to a state of homogeneous affinity. In contrast, unlabeled agonists inhibit 3H-antagonist binding in a heterogeneous fashion displaying multiphasic (nH less than 1) competition curves which can be resolved into high and low affinity binding sites. In the presence of saturating concentrations of guanine nucleotides, however, the agonist/3H-antagonist curves model best to a single affinity state which is identical with the low affinity state seen in control curves. The binding data can be explained by postulating two states of the D-2 dopamine receptor, inducible by agonists but not antagonists and modulated by guanine nucleotides."

https://openalex.org/W1581667553,"Double-stranded complementary DNAs were constructed enzymatically from polyadenylated RNA extracted from pituitary glands of ovariectomized rats, were inserted into the Pst I site of plasmid pBR322 and were cloned in Escherichia coli chi 1776. Cloned cDNAs encoding the precursor to the alpha subunit (pre-alpha) of the glycoprotein hormones were identified by hybridization with a restriction fragment of a previously cloned and sequenced cDNA encoding the precursor to the alpha subunit of mouse thyrotropin (Chin, W. W., Kronenberg, H. M., Dee, P. C., Maloof, F., and Habener, J. F. (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 78, 5329-5333). The DNA sequences of the two largest rat cDNA inserts (591 and 554 base pairs) were determined and the amino acid sequence of the rat pre-alpha subunit was deduced from these sequences. The composite sequence determined from these cDNAs spans 610 base pairs, or almost the entire length of the messenger RNA (mRNA) of 800 bases, when account is taken of the 3' poly(A) tract. The rat alpha precursor consists of a 24 amino acid leader sequence and a 96 amino acid alpha subunit apoprotein. The amino acid homologies between the rat and mouse, and between the rat and human sequences are 95% and 74%, respectively. Nucleotide homologies between the rat and mouse cDNAs in the coding and untranslated regions are 94% and 80%, respectively. This cloned cDNA will be applied to analysis of the structure of the rat alpha subunit gene(s) and of the regulation of alpha subunit gene expression."

Relaxation was augmented by a threshold concentration of isobutyl methylxanthine. The direct relaxant effect of vasoactive intestinal peptide and the distribution of nerves containing this peptide to circular smooth muscle support the view that vasoactive intestinal peptide is the neuromuscular transmitter of enteric inhibitory nerves."
https://openalex.org/W1531052981,"The effect of Ca2+ antagonist drugs on Ca2+ uptake and Na+-induced Ca2+ release by isolated rabbit heart mitochondria has been studied using arsenazo III and dansylaziridine-labeled troponin C as Ca2+ indicators. Mitochondria accumulated 20 nmol of Ca2+/mg of protein by a respiration-dependent process. A23187, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, or Na+ induced a release of Ca2+ from Ca2+-loaded and ruthenium red (RR)-treated mitochondria. Ca2+ antagonist drugs had no effect on the Ca2+ uptake process or on Ca2+ release induced either by A23187 or by carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone but they were effective in inhibiting the Na+-induced Ca2+ release process. The drug concentrations that resulted in 50% inhibition of Na+-induced Ca2+ release were 7, 12, 13, 66, and 150 microM for diltiazem, prenylamine, fendiline, nifedipine, and verapamil, respectively. In the absence of RR, the net amount of Ca2+ released by Na+ was less than that which occurred in the presence of RR due to the simultaneous operation of both the Ca2+ uptake and the Ca2+ release processes. Under these conditions, the inhibition of Ca2+ uptake by RR brought about a complete release of Ca2+ from the mitochondria, and the inhibition of the Na+-induced Ca2+ release by diltiazem resulted in an apparent uptake of Ca2+ by the mitochondria. These results indicate that diltiazem and certain other Ca2+ antagonist drugs may be selective inhibitors of the Na+/Ca2+ antiporter in heart mitochondria much like ruthenium red is a selective inhibitor of the Ca2+ uniporter."

https://openalex.org/W2066960327,"Rat embryo fibroblasts transformed by Abelson murine leukemia virus (MuLV) produce and release a transforming growth factor (TGF). Production of this factor is correlated with a tyrosine-specific protein kinase that is functionally active and is associated with the major Abelson MuLV gene product, P120. Transformation-defective mutants of Abelson MuLV do not transform cells, do not have their virus coded transforming gene product phosphorylated in tyrosine, and do not induce TGF production. Abelson MuLV-induced TGF morphologically transforms cells in culture, competes with 125I-labeled epidermal growth factor (EGF) for binding to cell receptors, and induces phosphorylation of tyrosine acceptor sites in the 160,000-dalton EGF membrane receptor. After purification to homogeneity, Abelson virus-induced TGF migrates as a single polypeptide with an apparent size of 7400 daltons as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis."

In radioimmunoassays the cholecystokinin-like material showed similarities to the carboxy terminal regions of mammalian cholecystokinin and gastrin. Since much is known about the morphology and synaptic connections of this serotonin neuron, the role of the cholecystokinin-like peptides can now be investigated by neurophysiological methods, thus opening the way to discovering whether a neuron can use more than one transmitter."
https://openalex.org/W1495757056,"Ca2+ release from mitochondria induced by oxalacetate or t-butyl hydroperoxide is accompanied by loss of endogenous Mg2+ and K+, swelling, loss of membrane potential, and other alterations which indicate that Ca2+ release is a result of increased inner membrane permeability. When ruthenium red is added after Ca2+ uptake, but before the releasing agent, the extent of Ca2+ release is diminished as is the extent of Mg2+ and K+ depletion and the extent of swelling. Under these conditions, the membrane potential appears to remain at a high value. When Ca2+ release is induced by oxalacetate or t-butyl hydroperoxide and ruthenium red is added subsequently, an apparent regeneration of membrane potential is observed providing that the associated swelling and Mg2+ loss had not been completed at the time ruthenium red was added. Under these conditions subsequent swelling and Mg2+ loss are inhibited.l Ultrastructural observations show the mitochondria become permeable in response to Ca2+ plus oxalacetate or Ca2+ plus t-butyl hydroperoxide in a heterogeneous manner. Conditions which appear to separate Ca2+ release from a decline in membrane potential or to produce an apparent recovery of membrane potential following partial collapse are shown to prevent a subpopulation of the mitochondria from becoming permeable. It is shown that membrane potential probes will not indicate a decline in potential or the presence of a permeable fraction under these conditions. It is concluded that the presence of Ca2+ accumulation inhibitors does not separate Ca2+ release from the development of increased inner membrane permeability."

Voltage responses to a rapid change of temperature are pyroelectric, while voltage responses to pressure pulses are piezoelectric in nature. The time course of the responses depends on dX/dt (X, temperature or pressure). The epidermal surface can react to all physical environmental influences to which nonbiological pyroelectric materials are known to respond. Epidermal voltage signals can be perceived through the intraepidermal and the superficial dermal nervous network. The pyroelectric and piezoelectric properties are also measurable on dead, dry skin samples."

https://openalex.org/W1564480961,"Two major high molecular weight proteins of human platelets are highly susceptible to proteolytic degradation by endogenous calcium-activated protease activities. Of the two proteins, one has been identified as filamin (Mr = 250,000 subunit); the second, a Mr = 235,000 subunit protein contributing 3-8% of the total platelet proteins, has not been previously characterized. We have now purified this protein, designated P235, to apparent homogeneity (greater than 95%). P235 was extracted by a Triton X-100 and EDTA containing buffer at pH 9.0 and purified by a series of DEAE-cellulose, phosphocellulose, and gel filtration chromatographies. Purified P235 is a dimer of Mr = 235,000 subunit. Its Stokes radius (67 A) and frictional ratio of 1.3 suggest that P235 is approximately globular. Despite this similarity in subunit and molecular weight of P235 to filamin, spectrin, fibronectin, and myosin, its amino acid composition, immunological properties, and peptide map are distinctly different and showed no precursor-product relationship to these proteins. Calcium-activated protease(s) in crude platelet extract rapidly degrade P235 into a Mr = 200,000 stable fragment. Upon prolonged storage at 4 degrees C, purified P235 partially degrades into a Mr = 220,000 and a Mr = 200,000 fragment. This degradation pattern suggests that P235 contains a large Mr = 200,000 protease-resistant domain. The availability of pure P235 will be useful in elucidating the functional role of this platelet protein, as well as the role of calcium-activated proteases in platelet function."
https://openalex.org/W1982291902,"Infection of suckling mice with mammalian reovirus type 3 results in fatal encephalitis associated with marked destruction of neurones1–4. The viral tropism specific to neural cells is determined by the reovirus haemagglutinin3,4. This haemagglutinin (HA), the σ1 polypeptide, is encoded in the S1 dsRNA segment5,6. In addition to determining cell and tissue tropism, the viral haemagglutinin determines humoral and cellular immune specificity7–10, binding to cellular micro-tubules11 and inhibition of cellular DNA synthesis12. To elucidate the structural basis for the functions of the reovirus type 3 HA, we have recently isolated and characterized several anti-HA monoclonal antibodies, which we have used to show that there are distinct functional domains on the reovirus type 3 HA13. One group of monoclonal antibodies neutralizes viruses while a second inhibits haemagglutination. Thus there are distinct HA functional domains involving haemagglutination and neutralization. One of the neutralizing monoclonal antibodies was used to select reovirus antigenic variants that were no longer neutralized by the monoclonal antibodies. These ‘variant’ viruses were tested for their neurovirulence by determining their capacity to replicate in mouse brains, leading to fatal encephalitis. We report here that all variants are markedly less virulent then the parental type 3 virus from which they were selected. These findings demonstrate directly the critical role of the viral haemagglutinin in neurovirulence and show that variant viruses that are altered at a site recognized by neutralizing antibody cannot grow efficiently in neural tissue."

https://openalex.org/W1575012910,"To elucidate mechanisms involved in the regulation of lung collagen content we studied hamsters with bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Lung collagen in this model is increased as the result of greatly increased lung collagen synthesis rates. However, collagen synthesis rates are subsequently restored to normal. Hamster lung explants from both normal and bleomycin-exposed hamsters were cultured, and the effects of explant conditioned medium (CM) on lung fibroblast (IMR-90) proliferation and collagen production in vitro were determined. Lung explant CM increased fibroblast prostaglandin (PG)E2 production and intracellular cAMP, and decreased both fibroblast proliferation and collagen production in a dose-dependent manner. Greater activity was observed with lung explant CM from bleomycin-exposed lungs. Incubation of fibroblasts with indomethacin prior to addition of CM blocked CM-mediated changes in PGE2 and cAMP and inhibited changes in fibroblast proliferation and collagen production. Exogenous PGE2 or dibutyryl cAMP also suppressed fibroblast proliferation and collagen production. The suppressive activity in lung-conditioned medium is nondialyzable, has an apparent molecular weight of 15,000-20,000 by gel filtration, and is heat-stable. It is not species-restricted since CM from hamster lung affected human and hamster lung fibroblasts similarly. Activity is present preformed in lung and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, although bronchoalveolar macrophages produce a nondialyzable factor in culture which suppresses fibroblast proliferation. The suppressive activity identified in fibrotic lung may represent a means for limiting collagen accumulation following tumor injury."

Immunoreaction of polypeptides translated in vitro from isolated seed mRNA using antibodies prepared against either purified acidic or basic subunit groups precipitated precursor polypeptides of Mr = 60,000 to Mr = 63,000. High pressure liquid chromatography fingerprinting of trypsin-generated fragments from in vitro synthesized precursors showed fragments specific to both acidic and basic subunits. No mature acidic or basic subunits were detected in vitro translation reactions by either immunoprecipitation or high pressure liquid chromatography fingerprinting. Pulse-labeling of cotyledons growing in culture with [3H]glycine showed rapid accumulation of label in glycinin precursors of Mr = 59,000 to Mr = 62,000. Although in vivo synthesized precursors had slightly greater electrophoretic mobility than in vitro synthesized precursors, little label initially appeared in mature glycinin subunits. After several hours of continued cotyledon growth in absence of label, precursors were processed and label accumulated in both acidic and basic subunit groups. Recombinant plasmids were prepared by reverse transcription of soybean seed mRNA, and clones which encode glycinin precursors were identified by heteroduplex-hybridization of translatable messages. Northern blot analysis of seed mRNA shows the mRNA-encoding glycinin precursors to migrate at Mr = 0.71 X 10(6) on agarose gels, corresponding to approximately 2050 nucleotides. This is sufficiently large to encode a polypeptide consisting of both a glycinin acidic and basic subunit."
https://openalex.org/W2008936728,"Golgi-impregnated biplexiform cells of the macaque retina are neurons with cell bodies in the ganglion cell layer, an axon in the nerve fiber layer, and dendrites in the inner plexiform layer that are postsynaptic to amacrine cell processes and bipolar cell axon terminals. In these features they resemble conventional ganglion cells, but they also have processes that arise from the main dendritic arborization, extend to the outer plexiform layer, and are postsynaptic to rod photoreceptor terminals as central elements at the ribbon synaptic complex. However, ordinary retinal ganglion cell dendrites ramify in the inner plexifrom layer and do not contact photoreceptors. Thus, biplexiform cells represent a previously undescribed class of neuron, part of whose synaptic input could bypass the commonly described interneuron circuitry of the vertebrate retina."

Fragments that bind gelatin and heparin bind to both gelatin and heparin were isolated by affinity chromatography. These fragments were further characterized by their ability to bind to two different monoclonal antibodies: monoclonal 2-8 and monoclonal 180-8. Using this approach, we have established the positions of two unique heparin-, a gelatin-, and two monoclonal antibody-binding sites on the fibronectin subunit."

This polypeptide is 6,000 daltons larger than mature ornithine aminotransferase when electrophoresed on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels. One-dimensional peptide mapping demonstrated that this 49,000-dalton polypeptide is structurally related to ornithine aminotransferase.

https://openalex.org/W1519921860,"Hypophysectomy is known to cause complete suppression of the hepatic synthesis alpha 2u-globulin. The effect of hypophysectomy on the synthesis of alpha 2u-globulin can be reversed by multiple hormone treatment. The role of pituitary growth hormone in the multihormonal regulation of alpha 2u-globulin in rat liver was examined in the hypophysectomized male rats with and without growth hormone supplementation. Daily treatment of hypophysectomized rats with 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone, corticosterone, thyroxine, and growth hormone for 8 days caused about 80% recovery in the hepatic content of alpha 2u-globulin and its corresponding mRNA as determined by radioimmunoassay, in vitro translation, and liquid hybridization with a cloned cDNA probe. However, omission of growth hormone from the treatment regimen failed to raise hepatic alpha 2u-globulin and its mRNA to more than 5% of the normal control. The possible effect of growth hormone on the translation of the mRNA for alpha 2u-globulin was examined with cultured hepatocytes derived from growth hormone-deficient rats. Culture of these cells in the presence of growth hormone for 24 h did not turn on the synthesis of alpha 2u-globulin. These results indicate that growth hormone regulates the synthesis of alpha 2u-globulin by acting at a step antecedent to mRNA translation."

The calcium ion is also shown to exchange rapidly with the solution such that the impermeability of the channel to calcium ion is due to the proximity of the lipid which limits solvation energy. Also at its binding site, calcium is shown to be able to draw into binding a peptide carbonyl which is not drawn into coordination by the sodium ion. These results demonstrate aspects of calcium ion transport and interaction which are considered central to its role as a cellular messenger."
https://openalex.org/W1532136079,"31P NMR has been used to study phosphoribosyldiphosphate (P-Rib-PP) over a wide range of pH values, both in the absence and presence of MgCl2. In the absence of MgCl2, the chemical shift variations of the three 31P nuclei in the molecule, over the pH range 4 to 9, were found to be largest for the terminal 1-diphosphate (1P beta) oxyanion and the 5-phosphate (5P) moiety. Apparent pK alpha values of approximately 6.1 and 6.3 were estimated for protonation of the 1P beta and 5P groups, respectively. Variations in the apparent pK alpha values associated with 1P beta and 5P oxyanions in the presence of various concentrations of MgCl2 were consistent with P-Rib-PP having two independent metal ion binding sites with different affinities for Mg2+ ions. The binding of Mg2+ reduced the apparent pK alpha of the 1P beta moiety by approximately 1.6 units and the apparent pK alpha of the 5P group by approximately 0.7 unit. This behavior is analogous to the situation reported for the terminal phosphooxyanion of ADP and observed for the phosphate group of ribose 5-phosphate, respectively. In the presence of an equimolar concentration of added MgCl2, the 1P alpha and 1P beta resonances of P-Rib-PP were shifted downfield and the 31P-31P coupling constant was decreased. Changes in both these parameters were very similar to those reported for the MgADP- complex. The observed chemical shifts and spin-spin coupling constants suggest that the diphosphate and monophosphate moieties of P-Rib-PP act as independent binding sites for Mg2+ in a manner similar to the phosphooxyanion groups of ADP and ribose 5-phosphate, respectively."

Continuation of our immunological analysis, using a protein blotting procedure for antigen detection and immunoaffinity chromatography, revealed that the native enzyme molecule is composed of polypeptides A and C with molecular weights of 31,600 and 24,800 respectively, in a molar ratio of 2 to 1. This is in accordance with a trimeric structure (A,A,C) for calf thymus ribonuclease H I.

https://openalex.org/W1559114606,"In the GH3 line of pituitary cells, growth hormone (GH) production is stimulated by thyroid and glucocorticoid hormones, yet non-pituitary cells, for example mouse fibroblast cells, which also contain receptors for these hormones do not produce GH. We have chosen to study both types of control over GH production in GH3 rat pituitary x GH nonexpressing LB82 mouse fibroblast hybrid cells. Most hybrid cells fail to produce GH in either the absence or presence of the inducers triiodothyronine and dexamethasone although these hormone receptors are present. Rat and mouse GH genes were detected in the hybrid cells' DNA by Southern hybridization following restriction enzyme digestion and gel electrophoresis. The probe was a cloned, full length rat GH cDNA which cross-hybridizes with the mouse GH gene. Analyses with multiple restriction enzymes that cut inside and outside the rat and mouse GH coding sequences were performed. We conclude that 1) both rat and mouse GH genes are present in the hybrid cells in copy number equivalent to those in the parental cell lines, and 2) the rat GH structural gene and flanking sequences are identical in the GH3 and hybrid cell DNA at the level of sensitivity afforded by restriction enzyme analyses. GH mRNA was not detected in total cell or poly(A+) RNA isolated from control or hormone-treated hybrid cells assayed by translation in 2 in vitro systems or by Northern hybridization analyzes. The latter experiments showed that no hybridizable GH mRNA sequences were present in the hybrids as either incomplete transcripts, mature mRNA, or unprocessed high molecular weight precursors. We conclude that extinction of GH in these hybrid cells results from a transcriptional block and/or rapid transcript degradation."
