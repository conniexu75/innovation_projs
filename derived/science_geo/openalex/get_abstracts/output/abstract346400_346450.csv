https://openalex.org/W2051584593,"Nanoscale building blocks are individually exceptionally strong because they are close to ideal, defect-free materials. It is, however, difficult to retain the ideal properties in macroscale composites. Bottom-up assembly of a clay/polymer nanocomposite allowed for the preparation of a homogeneous, optically transparent material with planar orientation of the alumosilicate nanosheets. The stiffness and tensile strength of these multilayer composites are one order of magnitude greater than those of analogous nanocomposites at a processing temperature that is much lower than those of ceramic or polymer materials with similar characteristics. A high level of ordering of the nanoscale building blocks, combined with dense covalent and hydrogen bonding and stiffening of the polymer chains, leads to highly effective load transfer between nanosheets and the polymer."

Until now, telomeres have been considered to be transcriptionally silent. We demonstrate that mammalian telomeres are transcribed into telomeric repeat–containing RNA (TERRA). TERRA molecules are heterogeneous in length, are transcribed from several subtelomeric loci toward chromosome ends, and localize to telomeres. We also show that suppressors with morphogenetic defects in genitalia (SMG) proteins, which are effectors of nonsense-mediated messenger RNA decay, are enriched at telomeres in vivo, negatively regulate TERRA association with chromatin, and protect chromosome ends from telomere loss. Thus, telomeres are actively transcribed into TERRA, and SMG factors represent a molecular link between TERRA regulation and the maintenance of telomere integrity."

Following adaptation to head restraint, mice maneuver on the spherical treadmill as their heads remain motionless.

Existing methods for mammalian brain imaging either have been difficult to apply to awake animals or lack the cellular resolution necessary for characterizing neural circuits. Wide-field CCD imaging has revealed large-scale activity patterns in response to whisker stimuli in freely moving mice (Ferezou et al., 2006Ferezou I. Bolea S. Petersen C.C.

However, because high-resolution imaging requires mechanical stability, all previous in vivo mouse TPM studies have used anesthetized preparations. Anesthesia greatly reduces overall brain activity (Berg-Johnsen and Langmoen, 1992Berg-Johnsen J. Langmoen I.A. The effect of isoflurane on excitatory synaptic transmission in the rat hippocampus.Acta Anaesthesiol. Scand. 1992; 36: 350-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and completely abolishes or alters several forms of neural dynamics, such as persistent activity (Major and Tank, 2004Major G. Tank D. Persistent neural activity: prevalence and mechanisms.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2004; 14: 675-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Currently, the chief impediment for TPM in awake, behaving mice is the relative motion between the brain and microscope that is typically associated with animal movements. There are two general approaches for TPM in awake mice: head-mounted microscopes and head restraint. A head-mounted microscope requires innovative engineering to miniaturize the excitation, laser scanning, and fluorescence collection. One such device demonstrated stable TPM of capillaries in awake and resting adult rats (Helmchen et al., 2001Helmchen F. Fee M.S. Tank D.W. Denk W. A miniature head-mounted two-photon microscope. high-resolution brain imaging in freely moving animals.Neuron. 2001; 31: 903-912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar); however, because it was not optimized for moving animals, relative motion between the microscope and brain was apparent during animal movements. An even smaller device has been reported (Flusberg et al., 2005Flusberg B.A. Jung J.C. Cocker E.D. Anderson E.P. Schnitzer M.J. In vivo brain imaging using a portable 3.9 gram two-photon fluorescence microendoscope.Opt. Lett. 2005; 30: 2272-2274Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), but its use in awake, behaving mice has not been demonstrated. As an alternative to a head-mounted, miniaturized microscope, head-restrained TPM may be possible using a standard microscope design. Little research has been directed toward head-restrained TPM in the awake mouse, possibly because there are concerns over the induction of stress, or that the animal's increased leverage would cause torques leading to large relative movements between the microscope and brain. The imaging technique we developed uses head restraint, but employs an air-supported spherical treadmill to allow walking and running. The treadmill was adapted from insect studies (Dahmen, 1980Dahmen H.J. A simple apparatus to investigate the orientation of walking insects.Experientia. 1980; 36: 685-687Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar, Mason et al., 2001Mason A.C. Oshinsky M.L. Hoy R.R.

Schildberger K. Octopamine and experience-dependent modulation of aggression in crickets.J.

(2004). Recording head direction cells in head fixed mice. Paper presented at: Society for Neuroscience (San Diego, Ca, Program No. 667.8).Google Scholar). We demonstrate that TPM image sequences at cellular resolution can be collected with relatively little frame-to-frame displacement or within-frame distortion due to brain motion. Furthermore, residual in-plane motion can be corrected using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) algorithm. Our approach allows imaging of cellular resolution calcium dynamics in neural and astrocytic populations in behaving mice. Our strategy is based on a two-photon microscope built around a spherical treadmill constructed from an air-supported, 8 inch diameter Styrofoam ball (Figure 1A). The animal can run freely in two dimensions on the upper surface of the ball while the skull is held rigidly in place with respect to the microscope objective. The frictionless movement of the treadmill reduces possible head torques the animal can apply, and thus relative motion between the brain and microscope is potentially reduced. To record ball rotation produced by walking and running, two optical computer mice were positioned along the equator of the spherical treadmill 90° apart. Detected motion signals were computer recorded and synchronized in time with image sequence acquisition. An infrared CCD camera was used for observing whisking and grooming. Adapting the mice to the head-restrained treadmill consisted of three sessions totaling ∼1 hr (see Experimental Procedures). By the end of the third session, mice walked, ran, and rested on the treadmill and showed no signs of struggling against the head restraint; in addition, most animals displayed grooming behavior (see online Movie S1 in the online Supplemental Data). Running activity was quantified (n = 7 mice) in terms of mean distance ran per hour (236 ± 72 m), time spent running (34% ± 8%), and speed while running (0.13 ± 0.003 m/s). These values were within the range seen during conventional exercise wheel running for isolated caged mice with free wheel access (Turner et al., 2005Turner M.J. Kleeberger S.R. Lightfoot J.T. Influence of genetic background on daily running-wheel activity differs with aging.Physiol. Genomics. 2005; 22: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We implanted custom-designed head plates and cranial windows in adult Thy1.2 YFP mice (Feng et al., 2000Feng G. Mellor R.H. Bernstein M. Keller-Peck C. Nguyen Q.T. Wallace M. Nerbonne J.M. Lichtman J.W. Sanes J.R. Imaging neuronal subsets in transgenic mice expressing multiple spectral variants of GFP.Neuron. 2000; 28: 41-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2243) Google Scholar) and 5- to 7-week-old adolescent wild-type (WT) mice. The head plate design consisted of a two-piece, 1 g titanium assembly (Figure 1B). The larger piece, containing an ∼4 mm diameter hole with a recessed seat for a coverslip to sit in, was permanently affixed to the skull with the hole centered over the brain region to be imaged; the second smaller piece could be clamped with screws onto the first piece to rigidly hold a coverslip in place. The void in the craniotomy between the dura surface and the coverslip was filled with a premolded plug of Kwik-Sil (Figure 1B). The uniform thickness of the plug was chosen so that it applied slight pressure to the surface of the dura when the clamping plate was installed; when in place, the plug pushed the brain surface ∼100–200 μm below the bottom edge of the skull. The dura was allowed to dry until tacky before the plug was implanted; this resulted in greater contact friction between the dura and plug and reduced brain motion. After spherical treadmill training and head plate installation, the brain area within the craniotomy could be routinely imaged by TPM in awake mice. To characterize our imaging technique, image sequences of cortical neurons expressing YFP in adult mice and cortical astrocytes highlighted with the dye Sulforhodamine 101 (SR101) in younger WT adolescent mice were collected during resting, walking, and running. Image sequences, shown in Figures 2A and 2C (time series of YFP and SR101 in online Movies S2 and S3, respectively), showed little frame-to-frame distortion during the resting state. During running, there were small movement-related lateral displacements of ∼3–5 μm for adult YFP mice and ∼2–3 μm for adolescent WT mice (see shifts relative to cross-hairs in Figures 2A and 2C). In addition, there was very little out-of-plane (Z direction) brain motion: small-scale structures typically remained in focus during the entire imaging sequence. Although functional imaging experiments could be performed with this unprocessed data (see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online), residual lateral shifts could be corrected in order to both quantify brain motions and further reduce image distortions. Our strategy to quantify in-focal-plane brain motion was to correct frames back to a reference image selected from the resting state using an offline line-by-line algorithm (Figure 3) based on an HMM (Rabiner, 1989Rabiner L.R. A tutorial on hidden Markov-models and selected applications in speech recognition.Proc. IEEE. 1989; 77: 257-286Crossref Scopus (15047) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Figure 3A, relative motion of the brain with respect to the microscope during the raster-scanned progression of the focused beam across the sample replaces an expected line in the image with a line of pixels from the sample at an X- and Y-shifted location. The appropriate correction is to remap the recorded line by placing it at the corresponding X- and Y-shifted location in a reconstructed image. The HMM model uses a maximum likelihood method to determine which X- and Y-shifted position (displacements) of the image is the most probable, by finding the most probable sequence of brain movement offsets for the successive lines acquired in the time series (Figure 3Di). The probability of a given sequence of offsets is a function of two components, summed over all time points in the sequence: (1) the fit of the line scanned at a given time point compared with the reference image at the offset given; and (2) the probability of the offset transitioning from the offset given at the previous time point to the current offset. The fit was based upon Poisson statistics of photon counting (Figure 3Diii), and the probability of a transition in offset was modeled as a spatially invariant exponential relation whose space constant was determined by expectation maximization (Figure 3Dii) (see Experimental Procedures for more details). Tests on simulated image sequences produced by distorting a real image using a known sequence of movements (Figure 3B) directly demonstrate the ability of the algorithm to predict the true displacement of the sample (Figure 3C) and produce a spatially undistorted image (Figure 3Biii). The results of motion correction on real time series data can be seen in Movies S2 and S3. X and Y displacements calculated by the motion correction algorithm were used as a metric for quantifying in-plane brain motion. Out-of-plane motion (Z direction) was determined by comparing a region of each frame in the time series to a Z-series image stack obtained above and below the time series acquisition plane to find the plane of maximal correlation. A typical example and quantification of brain motion induced by movement in adult YFP (Figure 2Bi) and adolescent WT (Figure 2Di) mice is shown in Figure 2 along with the pooled brain motion averaged across all YFP mice (n = 3) (Figure 2Bii) and all adolescent WT mice (n = 7) (Figures 2Dii and 2E). In general, the average out-of-plane (Z) motion was on the order of the axial point spread function radius (∼2 μm) (Sato et al., 2007Sato T.R. Gray N.W. Mainen Z.F. Svoboda K. The functional microarchitecture of the mouse barrel cortex.PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e189https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0050189Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and much less than the in-plane motion for both classes of mice. The quantitative results of the motion analysis are consistent with the qualitative observations of quite limited brain motion evident by visual inspection of the image sequences: maximum in-plane brain motion seen in the younger WT mice (Figure 2D) was ∼2–3 μm, while in adult YFP mice it was greater (∼3–5 μm) but still relatively modest. In adolescent WT mice the displacements were well correlated with positive acceleration of running (Figures 2Dii and 2E). In both classes, medial-lateral (X axis) in-plane motion was found to be smaller than rostral-caudal (Y axis) in-plane motion. One possible explanation for this difference is the symmetry of the forces on the brain in the medial-lateral direction compared with the asymmetry in the rostral-caudal direction, with skull on one side and spinal cord exerting force on the other (Britt and Rossi, 1982Britt R.H. Rossi G.T. Quantitative analysis of methods for reducing physiological brain pulsations.J. Neurosci. Methods. 1982; 6: 219-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Though frame-to-frame out-of-plane motion was typically low (∼1 μm), slow drifts were often observed over the course of 4–5 min recordings; these changes were relatively small (0.6 ± 0.5 μm/min) and rarely inhibited acquisition or analysis of functional or structural data. Relative brain and skull motion was compared by imaging fluorescent neurons in the cortex and intrinsic fluorescence from the skull. We found similar motion of both structures in young WT mice (in-plane standard deviation of Y motion of 0.9 ± 0.8 μm for brain and 0.7 ± 0.6 μm for skull, p = 0.85), but statistically less skull motion compared with brain motion in older YFP mice (1.7 ± 0.3 μm for brain and 0.6 ± 0.3 μm for skull, p = 0.008). This indicates that the brain motion observed while imaging older YFP mice likely stems from the brain moving inside the more stable skull with respect to the microscope, while for younger WT mice, either the skull/brain unit or independent but comparable skull and brain motion contribute to the observed displacements during imaging. The usefulness of the spherical treadmill microscope system for functional imaging was tested by imaging experiments following the loading of large populations of neurons in Hind Limb Sensory Cortex (S1HL) (identified stereotactically; see Experimental Procedures) with the green calcium-sensitive dye Calcium Green-1-AM, using multicell bolus loading (Stosiek et al., 2003Stosiek C. Garaschuk O. Holthoff K. Konnerth A. In vivo two-photon calcium imaging of neuronal networks.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 7319-7324Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). The red fluorescent dye SR101 was simultaneously injected in order to label astrocytes (Nimmerjahn et al., 2004Nimmerjahn A. Kirchhoff F. Kerr J.N. Helmchen F. Sulforhodamine 101 as a specific marker of astroglia in the neocortex in vivo.Nat. Methods. 2004; 1: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar) and provide a static, non-cell-activity-dependent channel on which to apply the motion correction algorithm. Injections were performed immediately following implantation of the head plate. A typical calcium-sensitive dye recording is illustrated in Figure 4. Imaging was performed in layer 2/3, which contained many fluorescently labeled neurons and astrocytes (Figure 4Ai). An image time series (see Movie S4) associated with this region was collected (0.256 s/frame) after the animal awoke from anesthesia, during voluntary running and resting behavior, and during stimulated running induced by air puff stimuli to the contralateral trunk and limbs. The fluorescence over time for the neuropil and numbered neuronal soma regions of interest (ROIs) indicated in Figure 4Aii is plotted in Figure 4B along with the running speed, stimulus timing, and brain motion. This time series was motion corrected as described above (see Figure S1 for a comparison of the unprocessed and corrected fluorescence traces). Nearly every neuron showed transient fluorescence increases, corresponding to increased free calcium ion concentration, during this time series. The transients of four of the neurons almost exactly mimic the time course of running speed (neurons 1, 2, 3, and 4 in Figure 4B): increased fluorescence during periods of running and a constant baseline level with reduced frequency of transients during periods of resting. In addition, many neurons (i.e., 17, 26, 27, and 28) show more sparse, but still significant, fluorescence transients that are not visibly linked to mouse running. An expanded view of four neurons is shown in Figure 4C. The correlation of fluorescence changes to behavior was quantified by computing the cross-correlation coefficient (C) between the fluorescence and running traces (Figure 4D). A wide range of correlations was observed: a significant fraction of the neurons showed strong running correlation (neurons 1–11, C > 0.5), while others showed some (neurons 12–19, 0.5 > C > 0.3) or little (neurons 20–34, 0.3 > C > 0) correlation. The running-related activity of neurons from these different correlation groups can also be seen in the form of running-onset-triggered fluorescence averages (Figure 4E). (Interestingly, neuron 10 showed an ∼1 s onset delayed response compared with running onset.) As with many of the neurons, the neuropil fluorescence transients were also strongly running correlated (C of 0.6); however, the neuropil transients were many times smaller than the typical neuronal transients (∼2%–5% versus ∼15%–30% ΔF/F, respectively). In addition to neuron-running correlations, neuron-neuron correlations were also computed (Figure 4F). In general, neurons highly, moderately, or weakly correlated with running were also highly, moderately, or weakly correlated with each other, respectively. In a few specific cases, this generality did not hold; for example, while neurons 4 and 10 are strongly running correlated, their mutual fluorescence activity correlation was only moderately correlated (C of 0.4), and while neurons 31 and 32 are weakly running correlated, their activity was correlated with a C of 0.46. It was feasible to record image time series, such as the one shown in Figure 4, for hours. Recordings with similar signal-to-noise (S/N), brain motion, neural activity, and staining were obtained in all mice (n = 7 mice, 13 ± 4 time series per mouse, 34 ± 20 neurons per time series) (see Movies S5 and S6 and Figures S4 and S5). Time-series movies simultaneously tracking the activity of >100 neurons were possible (Movie S6 and Figure S5). Running-correlated neuronal and neuropil activity was observed in every mouse (on average, 16% ± 16% and 53% ± 38% of neurons and neuropil regions respectively with C > 0.5; 31% ± 15% and 27% ± 23% with 0.5 > C > 0.3; and 53% ± 28% and 19% ± 20% with 0.3 > C > 0). In order to show that basic properties of calcium transients we measured were similar to those observed in anesthetized preparations (Kerr et al., 2005Kerr J.N. Greenberg D. Helmchen F. Imaging input and output of neocortical networks in vivo.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 14063-14068Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), we examined the fast temporal dynamics using high-frame-rate time series and line-scan acquisitions. An image time series acquired at 64 ms/frame in sensory cortex during air puff stimulation is shown in Figures 5A and 5B. Isolated transients show a fast rise (within one frame) with exponential decay. Transients are of varying amplitude, consistent with a difference in the number of action potentials (Kerr et al., 2005Kerr J.N. Greenberg D. Helmchen F. Imaging input and output of neocortical networks in vivo.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 14063-14068Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The effect of summation can be clearly seen in examples where the two events are separated in time (Figure 5B neuron 2 and Figure 5E neuron 2, Trial 3, arrowheads). In general, the fast onset times, amplitude, duration, and exponential decay dynamics of these transients are similar to action-potential-generated transients seen in anesthetized animals (Kerr et al., 2005Kerr J.N. Greenberg D. Helmchen F. Imaging input and output of neocortical networks in vivo.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 14063-14068Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Figures 5C and 5D demonstrate line-scan recordings (2 ms/line) from four individual layer 2/3 neurons of the sensory cortex during air puff stimulation. These stimuli evoked calcium transients in one out of the four neurons. The responses have a rapid onset but demonstrate a more complex waveform. Interestingly, the time course of the transients in the responding neuron varied significantly from trial to trial (Figure 5E). This effect could be due to positional and postural differences of the mouse with respect to the fixed air stimulus (see Experimental Procedures), differences in the evoked running behavior of the mouse (Figure 5E, right column), or possibly a variable response due to differences in background activity of the network (Arieli et al., 1996Arieli A. Sterkin A. Grinvald A. Aertsen A. Dynamics of ongoing activity: explanation of the large variability in evoked cortical responses.Science. 1996; 273: 1868-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar). The summation of many fast transients is the likely origin of the longer running-correlated transients seen in Figure 4 (i.e., neurons 1–4). One possible concern when examining cell-activity-dependent fluorescence traces in awake, behaving animals is brain-motion-induced fluorescence changes giving false signatures for cell activity. Even after in-plane motion correction, motion causing cells to move in and out of the focal plane can still remain. To evaluate the magnitude of this problem in young WT mice, we used our Z-series image stacks to estimate the fluorescence change that would occur if a cell moved up or down with respect to the imaging plane. Across the population of cells used in the generation of Figure 6, the average change in fluorescence was 2% ± 4% for a 2 μm up or down movement, which represents the typical maximal Z motion. Further confidence in this analysis can be provided by consideration of the ratio of positive to negative transients. Because the many tens to hundreds of cells are distributed randomly in the Z direction on the scale of our ∼2 μm thick focal plane (no preferred position of the soma with respect to the imaging plane), out-of-plane motion would be expected to cause an equal number of positive-going (cells moving into the plane and increasing the signal) and negative-going (cells moving out of the plane and decreasing the signal) false fluorescence transients. In fact, these effects are exactly what we observe for the brain-motion-induced small fluorescence transients seen in adult YFP mice: both in their size (<∼5%) and in the near equal number of positive- and negative-going events (Figure S3). In contrast to the non-cell-activity-dependent fluorescence of YFP, cell activity induces a transient increase in Calcium Green-1-AM fluorescence. Therefore, if a majority of the observed signals in Calcium-Green-1-AM-labeled neurons are positive-going (unipolar), they are mostly activity-dependent fluorescence transients from active cells, but any deviation from unipolarity implies the existence of motion-induced fluorescence changes. This effect can be quantified by calculating the ratio of negative- to positive-going transients, making it possible to estimate a false positive error rate for cell-activity-dependent increases in fluorescence. In Figure 6, we have calculated this ratio for events of varying duration and varying S/N (n = 7 mice, 26 time series at 128 × 128 resolution). In general, shorter, smaller S/N events are far more error prone than longer, larger S/N signals. For example, 8000 positive-going and 4000 negative-going fluorescence signals of 0.5 s (two samples) duration with amplitude two times the fluorescence baseline standard deviation (2σ) were detected (Figure 6A). Assuming all negative-going fluorescence signals are caused by brain motion (Figure 6F) and assuming an equal number of positive- and negative-going motion-induced fluorescence signals, one can expect an error rate of ∼50% due to brain motion when observing such short and small signals (Figure 6E). However, this error rate decreases dramatically for longer and higher S/N events: 4σ amplitude, 1.5 s duration positive signals are only ∼2% error prone; i.e., for every 100 positive transients of this S/N and duration assumed to be caused by neural activity, only 2 would be expected to represent a false signal due to brain motion. Using these results, we highlighted the transients in Figure 4B in red that have an error rate of <5%. Of course, brain motion is not the only source of error in our system. Other sources, such as electronics or photon shot noise, also contribute and become more apparent with lower S/N. Therefore, our error rate estimation provides an upper bound on the percent of signals that could be associated with brain motion; it could actually be significantly less. Using the above definition for activity-dependent fluorescence signals, we found that an average of 77% ± 15% of neurons in each mouse (n = 7) showed at least 1 calcium transient/min (defined as a >3σ transient with a 5% or lower error rate [Figure 6E]), while 23% of neurons displayed <1 transient/min. The mean activity rate averaged across all neurons was 2.6 ± 1.0 transients/min. Bolus loading also allowed the recording of calcium dynamics from astrocytes that were loaded with Calcium Green-1-AM and were identified with their specific labeling by SR101. We observed a wide variety of astrocytic calcium dynamics ranging from waves of activity spreading from astrocyte to astrocyte to synchronized periodic “bursting” activity seen across many astrocytes in t"

By stimulating immune responses in mosaic tobacco plants created by grafting different genetic backgrounds, we showed that the methyl salicylate (MeSA) esterase activity of salicylic acid-binding protein 2 (SABP2), which converts MeSA into salicylic acid (SA), is required for SAR signal perception in systemic tissue, the tissue that does not receive the primary (initial) infection. Moreover, in plants expressing mutant SABP2 with unregulated MeSA esterase activity in SAR signal-generating, primary infected leaves, SAR was compromised and the associated increase in MeSA levels was suppressed in primary infected leaves, their phloem exudates, and systemic leaves. SAR was also blocked when SA methyl transferase (which converts SA to MeSA) was silenced in primary infected leaves, and MeSA treatment of lower leaves induced SAR in upper untreated leaves.

We investigated both aspects of population structure for microbial communities at two neighboring hydrothermal vents by examining the sequences of more than 900,000 microbial small-subunit ribosomal RNA amplicons. The two vent communities have different population structures that reflect local geochemical regimes. Descriptions of archaeal diversity were nearly exhaustive, but despite collecting an unparalleled number of sequences, statistical analyses indicated additional bacterial diversity at every taxonomic level. We predict that hundreds of thousands of sequences will be necessary to capture the vast diversity of microbial communities, and that different patterns of evenness for both high- and low-abundance taxa may be important in defining microbial ecosystem dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2126941515,"Captive breeding is used to supplement populations of many species that are declining in the wild. The suitability of and long-term species survival from such programs remain largely untested, however. We measured lifetime reproductive success of the first two generations of steelhead trout that were reared in captivity and bred in the wild after they were released. By reconstructing a three-generation pedigree with microsatellite markers, we show that genetic effects of domestication reduce subsequent reproductive capabilities by ∼40% per captive-reared generation when fish are moved to natural environments. These results suggest that even a few generations of domestication may have negative effects on natural reproduction in the wild and that the repeated use of captive-reared parents to supplement wild populations should be carefully reconsidered."
https://openalex.org/W2020304716,"The resting brain is not silent, but exhibits organized fluctuations in neuronal activity even in the absence of tasks or stimuli. This intrinsic brain activity persists during task performance and contributes to variability in evoked brain responses. What is unknown is if this intrinsic activity also contributes to variability in behavior. In the current fMRI study, we identify a relationship between human brain activity in the left somatomotor cortex and spontaneous trial-to-trial variability in button press force. We then demonstrate that 74% of this brain-behavior relationship is attributable to ongoing fluctuations in intrinsic activity similar to those observed during resting fixation. In addition to establishing a functional and behavioral significance of intrinsic brain activity, these results lend new insight into the origins of variability in human behavior.

In addition to establishing a functional and behavioral significance of intrinsic brain activity, these results lend new insight into the origins of variability in human behavior. Historically, there have existed two alternate perspectives for understanding brain function (Llinas, 2001Llinas R. I of the Vortex: From Neurons to Self. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA2001Google Scholar). The first conceptualizes the brain as an input-output system primarily driven by interaction with the external world. The second suggests that the brain operates on its own, intrinsically, with external factors modulating rather than determining the operation of the system. The former perspective has motivated the majority of neuroscience research, but accumulating evidence is emphasizing the importance of the latter. Support for the intrinsic perspective on brain function comes from studies of spontaneous brain activity, or activity present even in the absence of task performance or stimuli. These studies span the gamut of techniques from fMRI BOLD (Biswal et al., 1995Biswal B. Yetkin F. Haughton V. Hyde J.

One highly reproducible example of this intrinsic organization is the observation that spontaneous BOLD fluctuations in the left somatomotor cortex (SMC) are specifically correlated with fluctuations in the right SMC as well as with those in medial motor areas (Biswal et al., 1995Biswal B. Yetkin F. Haughton V. Hyde J. Functional connectivity in the motor cortex of resting human brain using echo-planar MRI.Magn. Reson.

Functional connectivity in single and multislice echoplanar imaging using resting-state fluctuations.Neuroimage. 1998; 7: 119-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar). Importantly, this intrinsic activity does not disappear with the administration of stimuli or during task performance. Rather, it continues and can account for a significant fraction of the intertrial variability routinely observed in evoked neuronal responses in animals (Arieli et al., 1996Arieli A. Sterkin A.

Coherent spontaneous activity accounts for trial-to-trial variability in human evoked brain responses.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 23-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). An important unanswered question is whether these fluctuations in ongoing intrinsic activity are manifested functionally as fluctuations in behavior. Several previous studies have examined the relationship between human brain activity and intertrial variability in behavior (Boly et al., 2007Boly M. Balteau E. Schnakers C. Degueldre C. Moonen G.

Most studies have attributed their findings to intertrial variability in task-related factors such as attention or anticipation (Pessoa et al., 2002Pessoa L. Gutierrez E. Bandettini P.A.

Recently, we proposed an alternative mechanism, suggesting that intrinsic fluctuations in brain activity such as those observed during rest continue during task performance and contribute to intertrial variability in behavior (Fox et al., 2006bFox M.D. Snyder A.Z.

The retinotopy of visual spatial attention.Neuron. 1998; 21: 1409-1422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar), the behavioral significance of fluctuations in ongoing intrinsic activity remains to be demonstrated. To test the hypothesis that fluctuations in ongoing intrinsic activity contribute to variability in behavior, we examined BOLD activity within the human somatomotor system both during rest and during a simple right-hand button-press task in which the force of each button press was recorded. This experimental design was used for three reasons. First, brain activity in the left SMC has previously been shown to relate to force output (Cramer et al., 2002Cramer S.C. Weisskoff R.M. Schaechter J.D. Nelles G. Foley M. Finklestein S.P. Rosen B.R. Motor cortex activation is related to force of squeezing.Hum.

Brooks D.J. Frackowiak R. Relation between cerebral activity and force in the motor areas of the human brain.J. Neurophysiol. 1995; 74: 802-815PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a suitable behavioral measure for the current investigation. Second, the left SMC and right SMC are coherent in their spontaneous activity but differentially activated by a right-handed button press (Biswal et al., 1995Biswal B. Yetkin F. Haughton V. Hyde J. Functional connectivity in the motor cortex of resting human brain using echo-planar MRI.Magn. Reson.

Functional connectivity in single and multislice echoplanar imaging using resting-state fluctuations.Neuroimage. 1998; 7: 119-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar), facilitating a separation of spontaneous and task-related activity in the left SMC (Fox et al., 2006bFox M.D. Snyder A.Z. Zacks J.M. Raichle M.E. Coherent spontaneous activity accounts for trial-to-trial variability in human evoked brain responses.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 23-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Finally, our experimental design allows us to rule out confounding factors such as attention, arousal, and anticipation by examining the spatial distribution of the BOLD-behavior effect, correlations with reaction time, and the influence of interstimulus interval. fMRI BOLD data were acquired in 17 normal right-handed subjects under two conditions: resting while maintaining visual fixation on a crosshair and during a button-press task. In the task condition, subjects were asked to press a button as quickly as possible with their right index finger when the crosshair dimmed. The force of each button press was measured with a custom-built optical transducer. Each subject performed 80 trials pressing with an average force of 9.34 N and a within-run standard deviation (trial-to-trial variability) of 2.34 N. The average reaction time was 365 ms with an average within run standard deviation of 58 ms. For each subject, we identified a left SMC region significantly activated by right-handed button presses (Figures 1A and 1B). We then identified a right SMC region significantly correlated with the left SMC in its spontaneous activity during the resting runs (Figures 1C and 1D; Biswal et al., 1995Biswal B. Yetkin F. Haughton V. Hyde J. Functional connectivity in the motor cortex of resting human brain using echo-planar MRI.Magn. Reson.

Coherent spontaneous activity accounts for trial-to-trial variability in human evoked brain responses.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 23-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). This procedure identifies two regions of interest strongly correlated in their spontaneous activity (Figures 1C and 1E) but differentially activated by right hand button presses (Figure 1A). The locations of the left SMC and right SMC regions of interest across our population of 17 subjects are displayed in Supplementary Figure 1. Average BOLD activity following a button press was extracted for both the left SMC (Figure 2A) and right SMC (Figure 2B) along with the average within-run standard deviations. The large standard deviations indicate pronounced trial-to-trial variability, with the mean evoked response accounting for 20.2% of the total left SMC variance and only 2.88% of the total right SMC variance. Thus, the majority of the left SMC activity and almost all of the right SMC activity following a button press was due to factors other than the deterministic evoked response. We have previously reported that much of the variance in left SMC BOLD responses can be accounted for by coherent spontaneous activity as measured in the right SMC (Fox et al., 2006bFox M.D. Snyder A.Z. Zacks J.M. Raichle M.E. Coherent spontaneous activity accounts for trial-to-trial variability in human evoked brain responses.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 23-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). However, this previous study was a reanalysis of data not collected for this purpose and included complicating features such as video stimuli, a nonmotor cognitive task, and button-press responses not synchronized with scanner acquisitions. Our first step therefore was to confirm the previous finding in the present data set. As in our original report, we used the signal from the right SMC as an estimate of ongoing spontaneous activity in the left SMC. We subtracted the right SMC activity from the left SMC after weighting by a regression coefficient derived from the resting-state data (Figure 2C). Comparing left SMC responses before and after removal of right SMC activity (Figure 2D), we observed a 59.3% reduction in noise (p < 0.0005), a 19.4% reduction in signal (p < 0.005), and a 109.4% increase in signal-to-noise ratio (p < 0.0005). The increase in signal to noise is important as it rules out the possibility that a small task-evoked response in the right SMC accounts for the reduction in left SMC variance (Fox et al., 2006bFox M.D. Snyder A.Z. Zacks J.M. Raichle M.E. Coherent spontaneous activity accounts for trial-to-trial variability in human evoked brain responses.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 23-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). These results replicate our previous finding (Fox et al., 2006bFox M.D. Snyder A.Z. Zacks J.M. Raichle M.E. Coherent spontaneous activity accounts for trial-to-trial variability in human evoked brain responses.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 23-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar) and establish our experimental approach, showing that left SMC activity following right-handed button presses (Figure 2A) can be partitioned into coherent spontaneous activity (monitored in the right SMC; Figure 2B) and activity specific to the left SMC (Figure 2C). In the next section of this article, we will again apply this experimental approach, but instead of focusing on total left SMC variance we will focus on the portion left SMC variance related to force output. It is clear from the material presented above that intrinsic activity can account for much of the variability in measured left SMC BOLD responses. However, the critical question is whether intrinsic activity can account for the portion of left SMC variance that is related to behavior. To answer this question, we first identified a significant brain-behavior relationship in the left SMC and then applied the above analytic approach to determine how much of this relationship was attributable to intrinsic activity. The first step was therefore to find some measure of left SMC BOLD variance that was related to natural trial-to-trial variability in force output. For each button press run of each subject, we sorted trials into three bins based on the force of the button press (hard, medium, and soft). To maximize the difference in force, we compared trials in the hard bin (mean = 12.04 N) to trials in the soft bin (mean = 6.91 N). The average left SMC time courses for spontaneous hard and"

Remarkable progress has been made in delineating the molecular mechanisms whereby changes in cellular oxygenation are transduced to the nucleus as changes in gene transcription through the activity of HIF-1.

Choline-sensitive microelectrodes were used to measure the synaptic release of cortical acetylcholine (ACh) at a subsecond resolution in rats performing a task involving the detection of cues. Cues that were detected, defined behaviorally, evoked transient increases in cholinergic activity (at the scale of seconds) in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), but not in a nonassociational control region (motor cortex). In trials involving missed cues, cholinergic transients were not observed. Cholinergic deafferentation of the mPFC, but not motor cortex, impaired cue detection. Furthermore, decreases and increases in precue cholinergic activity predicted subsequent cue detection or misses, respectively. Finally, cue-evoked cholinergic transients were superimposed over slower (at the timescale of minutes) changes in cholinergic activity. Cortical cholinergic neurotransmission is regulated on multiple timescales to mediate the detection of behaviorally significant cues and to support cognitive performance."
https://openalex.org/W2169233494,"All known human societies establish social order by punishing violators of social norms. However, little is known about how the brain processes the punishment threat associated with norm violations. We use fMRI to study the neural circuitry behind social norm compliance by comparing a treatment in which norm violations can be punished with a control treatment in which punishment is impossible. Individuals' increase in norm compliance when punishment is possible exhibits a strong positive correlation with activations in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Moreover, lateral orbitofrontal cortex activity is strongly correlated with Machiavellian personality characteristics. These findings indicate a neural network involved in social norm compliance that might constitute an important basis for human sociality. Different activations of this network reveal individual differences in the behavioral response to the punishment threat and might thus provide a deeper understanding of the neurobiological sources of pathologies such as antisocial personality disorder."

Prior studies demonstrated that either loss or doubling of MeCP2 results in postnatal neurodevelopmental disorders. To understand the impact of MeCP2 expression on neuronal function, we studied the synaptic properties of individual neurons from mice that either lack or express twice the normal levels of MeCP2. Hippocampal glutamatergic neurons that lack MeCP2 display a 46% reduction in synaptic response, whereas neurons with doubling of MeCP2 exhibit a 2-fold enhancement in synaptic response. Further analysis shows that these changes were primarily due to the number of synapses formed. These results reveal that MeCP2 is a key rate-limiting factor in regulating glutamatergic synapse formation in early postnatal development and that changes in excitatory synaptic strength may underlie global network alterations in neurological disorders due to altered MeCP2 levels."

https://openalex.org/W2081737839,"The diversity of dendritic patterns is one of the fundamental characteristics of neurons and is in part regulated by transcriptional programs initiated by electrical activity. We show that dendritic outgrowth requires a family of combinatorially assembled, neuron-specific chromatin remodeling complexes (nBAF complexes) distinguished by the actin-related protein BAF53b and based on the Brg/Brm ATPases. nBAF complexes bind tightly to the Ca(2+)-responsive dendritic regulator CREST and directly regulate genes essential for dendritic outgrowth. BAF53b is not required for nBAF complex assembly or the interaction with CREST, yet is required for their recruitment to the promoters of specific target genes. The highly homologous BAF53a protein, which is a component of neural progenitor and nonneural BAF complexes, cannot replace BAF53b's role in dendritic development. Remarkably, we find that this functional specificity is conferred by the actin fold subdomain 2 of BAF53b. These studies suggest that the genes encoding the individual subunits of BAF complexes function like letters in a ten-letter word to produce biologically specific meanings (in this case dendritic outgrowth) by combinatorial assembly of their products."

Using Cre-lox conditional knockout mice, we demonstrate that lipoprotein receptor LRP1 expression regulates apoE and cholesterol levels within the CNS. We also found that deletion of APP and its homolog APLP2, or components of the γ-secretase complex, significantly enhanced the expression and function of LRP1, which was reversed by forced expression of the APP intracellular domain (AICD). We further show that AICD, together with Fe65 and Tip60, interacts with the LRP1 promoter and suppresses its transcription. Together, our findings support that the γ-secretase cleavage of APP plays a central role in regulating apoE and cholesterol metabolism in the CNS via LRP1 and establish a biological linkage between APP and apoE, the two major genetic determinants of AD."

This effect was reversed by the action of Ran guanosine triphosphate, which returned the FG domains into a polymer brush-like, entropic barrier conformation.

In the presynaptic neuron AIY, UNC-40 (DCC) plays an unexpected and previously uncharacterized role: It cell-autonomously promotes assembly of presynaptic terminals in the immediate vicinity of the glial cell endfeet.

Here, we genetically dissect the achromatic motion channel in the fly Drosophila melanogaster at the level of the first relay station in the brain, the lamina, where it is split into four parallel pathways (L1-L3, amc/T1). The functional relevance of this divergence is little understood. We now show that the two most prominent pathways, L1 and L2, together are necessary and largely sufficient for motion-dependent behavior. At high pattern contrast, the two pathways are redundant. At intermediate contrast, they mediate motion stimuli of opposite polarity, L2 front-to-back, L1 back-to-front motion. At low contrast, L1 and L2 depend upon each other for motion processing.

By analyzing the mating patterns of female hybrids and cross-fostered offspring, we demonstrate that species recognition is inherited on the Z chromosome, which is also the known location of species-specific male plumage traits and genes causing low hybrid fitness.

It remains unclear whether these proteins may control neurogenesis by regulating other microtubule-dependent processes such as nuclear migration. Here, we identify Cep120, a centrosomal protein preferentially expressed in neural progenitors during neocortical development. We demonstrate that silencing Cep120 in the developing neocortex impairs both interkinetic nuclear migration (INM), a characteristic pattern of nuclear movement in neural progenitors, and neural progenitor self-renewal. Furthermore, we show that Cep120 interacts with transforming acidic coiled-coil proteins (TACCs) and that silencing TACCs also causes defects in INM and neural progenitor self-renewal. Our data suggest a critical role for Cep120 and TACCs in both INM and neurogenesis.

Pollen-laden thrips leave male cycad cones en masse during the daily thermogenic phase, when cone temperatures and volatile emissions increase dramatically and thrips are repelled. As thermogenesis declines, total volatile emissions diminish and cones attract thrips, resulting in pollination of female cones. Behavioral and electrophysiological tests on thrips reveal that variations in b-myrcene and ocimene emissions by male and female cones are sufficient to explain the observed sequential thrips' repellence (push) and attraction (pull). These dynamic interactions represent complex adaptations that enhance the likelihood of pollination and may reflect an intermediate state in the evolution of biotic pollination."

Mammals carry six Prx enzymes that distribute in the three Prx subtypes with four typical 2-Cys Prxs (I-IV), one atypical 2-Cys Prx (Prx V), and one 1-Cys Prx (Prx VI) (17Wood Z.A. Schroder E. Robin Harris J. Poole L.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 32-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2100) Google Scholar). Typical 2-Cys Prxs have the unique feature of undergoing substrate-mediated inactivation by overoxidation of their catalytic cysteine to a sulfinic acid (R-SO2H). Overoxidation only occurs during enzymatic cycling and is proportional to the amount of substrate under both non-saturating and saturating conditions (15Bryk R. Griffin P. Nathan C. Nature. 2000; 407: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). The fact that inactivation by overoxidation is both unique to eukaryotic Prxs and reversible by ATP-dependent reduction of the Prx Cys-SO2H by sulfiredoxin (Srx or npn3) and sestrins (18Biteau B. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. Nature. 2003; 425: 980-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar, 19Woo H.A. Kang S.W. Kim H.K. Yang K.S. Chae H.Z. Rhee S.G. J. Biol.

Poole L.B. Karplus P.A. Science. 2003; 300: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar). Hence, 2-Cys Prx activity is controlled both by the levels of its substrate H2O2 and by the activity of sulfinyl reductases, and this dual control is likely important for regulating H2O2 signaling. In this report, we have investigated the impact of NO on the expression of Prxs, Srx, and sestrins in murine macrophages. We provide a global view of the expression of the six mammalian Prxs in macrophages that produce NO upon stimulation with interferon γ (IFN-γ) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We show that gene expression of Prx I, V, and VI and of Srx was increased in stimulated macrophages. Up-regulation of Prx I and VI, but not Prx V, was mediated by NO. We also report that NO decreases spontaneous and H2O2-induced Prx sulfinylation and hastens recovery upon H2O2-induced Prx sulfinylation, thus pointing to a role for NO in overoxidation prevention and reactivation of 2-Cys Prx. Reagents—Recombinant mouse IFN-γ (specific activity 2 × 106 units/mg) was from R&D Systems, Abigdon, UK). Escherichia coli LPS, N-(3-(aminomethyl-benzyl-acetamidine)) (1400W), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), tert-butyl hydroperoxide, and cycloheximide were from Sigma. S-ethylisothiourea and the nitric oxide donor diethylenetriamine NONOate (DETA-NO) were from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Glucose oxidase was from Calbiochem. Cell Culture and Treatments—Protocols involving animal experimentation were approved by a national animal care committee. Bone marrow cells were obtained by flushing femurs of WT C57BL/6 mice and of NOS2–/– or Srx–/– mice. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM) were differentiated from bone marrow cells by culture in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 10% L929 cell-conditioned medium. The phenotype of BMM was verified by fluorescence-activated cell sorter. It was shown that >95% of the cells expressed the monocyte/macrophage marker CD11b. BMM were stimulated or not with IFN-γ and/or E. coli LPS at the concentrations and for the times indicated in the figure legends. When indicated, BMM were treated with the nitric oxide donor DETA-NO. Its decomposition rate was determined by the loss of the chromophore at 252 nm. Preparation of Cell Extracts—BMM cells were washed two times with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 0.5% Triton X-100 in 100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing protease inhibitor mixture Set III (Calbiochem). Cell lysate was then centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min, and the protein content of supernatant was determined spectrophotometrically at 595 nm by using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Antibodies and Immunoblot Analysis—Anti-Prx I antibody was from Upstate/Chemicon, anti-Prx III antibody was from Abcam, and antibodies to Prx II, Prx VI, Prx (I-IV)-SO2H, and Prx VI-SO2H were from LabFrontier (Seoul, South Korea). The anti-Srx antibody was a purified rabbit polyclonal serum prepared by Neosystem (Strasbourg, France). Anti-vinculin antibody was from Sigma-Aldrich. Cell lysates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE in 12% (Prx) or 15% (Srx) polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions. After the electrophoretic run and protein immobilization, nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences-GE Healthcare) were blocked with Tris-Tween-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat milk and incubated with primary antibodies. Proteins were visualized with horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody (Dako) using enhanced chemiluminescence assay (Millipore) or fluorescent secondary antibodies coupled to either LI-COR IRDye™ 700 or IRDye™ 800. RNA Extraction and Real-time Quantitative PCR—Total RNA was extracted from BMM cells using the SV Total RNA Isolation System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transcription of total RNA was performed using the Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) and random primers. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using a Light Cycler, and the detection of amplification products was carried out using the Light Cycler-DNA Master SYBR Green I kit (Roche Diagnostics). The generation of specific PCR products was confirmed by melting curve analysis. Data were analyzed with Light Cycler 3.5 software. Quantification was performed relative to the 18 S rRNA. All assays were performed in triplicate. Nitrite Measurement—Nitrite, the stable end product of NO, was quantified in culture medium by using the Griess reagent. Briefly, 200 μl of medium were reacted with 800 μl of Griess reagent (0.5% sulfanilamide and 0.05% N-(1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine in 45% acetic acid), and the absorbance was measured at 543 nm. The nitrite concentration was determined from a sodium nitrite standard curve. H2O2 Generation—Generation of H2O2 was assessed using the fluorescence indicator 2′,7′-di-chlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA; Molecular Probes, Inc.). BMM were incubated in a 24-well microplate and loaded for 30 min with 20 μm H2DCFDA in Hanks'-buffered solution. They were then stimulated for 30, 60, and 180 min with 500 nm PMA. Dichlorofluoroscein fluorescence was measured with a Victor3 fluorescence microplate reader (PerkinElmer) by emission at 520 nm (excitation, 485 nm). NO Increases Prx I and Prx VI Expression in Macrophages—BMM from WT or NOS2–/– mice were stimulated with IFN-γ and LPS. After 18 h, nitrite that had accumulated in the culture medium was quantified, and the expression of the six Prxs was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR. In stimulated WT BMM, Prx I, Prx V, and Prx VI mRNA expression was noticeably increased compared with unstimulated cells, whereas Prx IV was significantly reduced (Fig. 1A). In contrast, in stimulated NOS2–/– BMM, mRNA level of Prx I, Prx IV, and Prx VI remained unchanged compared with stimulated WT cells, showing that regulation was dependent on NOS2. Still, Prx V mRNA levels remained increased in NOS2–/– BMM, indicating that the up-regulation of this gene by IFN-γ and LPS is independent of NOS2. Prx II and Prx III mRNA levels were not significantly altered by stimulation in either mouse strain. We also used DETA-NO, an NO donor with a long half-life that releases NO at nanomolar concentrations, in the range produced by IFN-γ and LPS-activated macrophages (24Pervin S. Singh R. Chaudhuri G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3583-3588Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). DETA-NO treatment (500 μm) of resting macrophages during 18 h reproduced the effects of endogenous NO produced by BMM on Prx gene expression. Shorter exposures to DETA-NO revealed that Prx VI and Prx I mRNA levels increased 2- and 3-fold after 4 and 8 h, respectively (supplemental Fig. S1), suggesting that regulation is at least in part transcriptional. Moreover, the use of DETA-NO that had been left to decompose for 7 days at 37 °C (>8 half-lives) had no effect on gene expression, indicating that neither DETA nor nitrite is responsible for the regulation of Prxs observed with DETA-NO (not shown). Altogether, these data point to a physiological role of NO in the selective regulation of Prx I, IV, and VI mRNA levels. We further checked whether the NO-dependent increase in Prx I and VI transcript levels also occurred at protein level. Higher Prx I and VI protein levels were seen in BMM stimulated with IFN-γ and LPS, but not when cells were stimulated in the presence of NOS inhibitors or using cells explanted from NOS –/–2-deficient mice (Fig. 1B). Prx I and Prx VI protein levels were also increased in BMM incubated with DETA-NO, in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, Prx II and III protein levels were not sensitive to NO (Fig. 1C). On the whole, these results highlight the role of NO in up-regulation of Prx I and VI protein expression. Effect of NO on Prx Overoxidation—The active site cysteine of eukaryotic Prxs undergoes substrate-mediated oxidation to the sulfinic acid form (SO2H), which inactivates enzyme activity (25Rabilloud T. Heller M. Gasnier F. Luche S. Rey C. Aebersold R. Benahmed M. Louisot P. Lunardi J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19396-19401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 26Yang K.S. Kang S.W. Woo H.A. Hwang S.C. Chae H.Z. Kim K. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38029-38036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Based on the notion than NO induces cysteine sulfinylation in vitro (27Becker K. Savvides S.N. Keese M. Schirmer R.H. Karplus P.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 28Noguchi T. Nojiri M. Takei K. Odaka M. Kamiya N. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11642-11650Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we evaluated whether NO would also promote overoxidation of Prxs. Using an antibody that immunoreacts with the sulfinylated form of the four 2-Cys Prxs (I–IV), we thus monitored the level of overoxidized Prxs in macrophages that were stimulated to produce NO (Fig. 2A). In lysates of H2O2-challenged RAW 264.7 macrophages used as a positive control, the anti-Prx-SO2H antibody revealed the presence of two main bands and one barely visible band. Based on molecular mass and published data (19Woo H.A. Kang S.W. Kim H.K. Yang K.S. Chae H.Z. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47361-47364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 29Woo H.A. Jeong W. Chang T.S. Park K.J. Park S.J. Yang J.S. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), the lower band is sulfinylated Prx I/II and the upper main band corresponds to sulfinylated Prx III, whereas the uppermost faint band is presumably Prx IV. In control WT BMM, a unique anti-Prx-SO2H immunoreactive band was detected at the size of Prx I/II. This low steady-state oxidation level is expected to be the consequence of ROS basal production by macrophages. Surprisingly, in IFN-γ- and LPS-stimulated macrophages, Prx overoxidation was not or barely detectable, but in NOS2–/–-stimulated macrophages and in macrophages stimulated in the presence of NOS inhibitors, overoxidation was still present at the levels of unstimulated cells. To identify the NO-derived species responsible for the decrease in Prx overoxidation observed in stimulated macrophages, we tested the effect of DETA-NO. Exposure of BMM to DETA-NO also lessened Prx overoxidation (Fig. 2B). This effect was observed at DETA-NO concentrations as low as 50 μm and was markedly increased at 500 μm. Time course experiments indicated that the effect of NO on Prx oxidation occurred early, with an ∼50% decrease at 2 h after addition of DETA-NO (Fig. 2B, lower panel). We next evaluated whether NO would also alter the overoxidation of Prxs induced by exogenous H2O2. BMM were treated with IFN-γ and LPS or were exposed to DETA-NO for 16 h. After extensive washings, they were then challenged with a bolus of H2O2 (Fig. 3A) with the membrane-permeant pro-oxidant agent tert-butyl-hydroperoxide (Fig. 3B) or with H2O2 continuously produced at low concentrations by the glucose/glucose oxidase system (Fig. 3C). Again, H2O2-induced Prx I/II, Prx III, and, to a lesser extent, Prx IV overoxidation was significantly decreased in DETA-NO-treated macrophages as compared with the untreated controls. At least with respect to Prx I/II, similar results were obtained with human epithelial carcinoma (HeLa) cells exposed to exogenous NO (supplemental Fig. S2), pointing to a more general effect on various cell populations and species. We also used PMA, a potent NOX2 activator that stimulates endogenous H2O2 production. Macrophage treatment with PMA indeed led to H2O2 production, as testified by oxidation of the fluorescent probe dichlorofluoroscein diacetate (not shown). PMA also increased the basal levels of sulfinylated 2-Cys Prxs, which was not seen when cells had been previously treated with DETA-NO (Fig. 3C). We also checked whether 1-Cys Prx VI overoxidation was also affected by NO, using a Prx VI-SO2H-specific antibody. Overoxidized Prx VI was detectable only after exposure of resting BMM to 100 μm H2O2, and prior stimulation of BMM by IFN-γ/LPS or exposure to DETA-NO did not alter Prx VI overoxidation (supplemental Fig. S3). Prx VI protein levels were increased by NO as shown above (Fig. 1B) and after reprobing membranes with an anti-Prx VI antibody (supplemental Fig. S3). Prx V was not evaluated, because this Prx isoform is not sensitive to overoxidation (20Chevallet M. Wagner E. Luche S. van Dorsselaer A. Leize-Wagner E. Rabilloud T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37146-37153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In summary, these data clearly indicate that NO decreases 2-Cys Prx sulfinylation rather than promoting this form of oxidation. These results could be explained by NO either preventing Prx sulfinylation or favoring its recycling. Based on the simultaneous effect of NO on up-regulation of Prx I expression, it is possible that the resulting increased H2O2-scavenging capacity could act as a factor diminishing Prx I overoxidation. However, the fact that the translation inhibitor cycloheximide did not prevent DETA-NO from abating H2O2-mediated Prx overoxidation (supplemental Fig. S4) indicates that Prx I up-regulation and overoxidation can be dissociated. This result also show that decrease in Prx overoxidation does not require de novo protein synthesis. Effect of NO on Srx Expression—Sulfinylated 2-Cys Prx (I–IV) can be reduced by two different types of enzymes with ATP-dependent sulfinic acid reductase activity, Srx (18Biteau B. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. Nature. 2003; 425: 980-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar, 21Chang T.S. Jeong W. Woo H.A. Lee S.M. Park S. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50994-51001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) and the sestrins (22Budanov A.V. Sablina A.A. Feinstein E. Koonin E.V. Chumakov P.M. Science. 2004; 304: 596-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the possible involvement of Srx and sestrins in the NO-dependent decline in Prx overoxidation. Sestrin mRNA levels were not significantly modified in NO-producing or DETA-NO-exposed BMM (not shown). In contrast, Srx mRNA levels were significantly up-regulated in IFN-γ/LPS-stimulated macrophages (Fig. 4A), and this increase was dependent on NOS2-derived NO because it was not observed in stimulated macrophages from NOS2–/– mice. A time course experiment showed that the increase in Srx expression in DETA-NO-exposed BMM began as early as 1 h after DETA-NO exposure, peaked after ∼5 h, and remained high after 24 h (Fig. 4B). Western blot analyses using an Srx-specific antibody showed that the increase in Srx mRNA levels was paralleled by an increase in Srx protein levels (Fig. 4C). We sought to determine whether the NO-dependent up-regulation of Srx and the decline in Prx I–IV overoxidation were linked. To this aim, we analyzed the Prx oxidation status in BMM from WT or Srx-deficient mice that had been exposed to DETA-NO and then challenged with 100 μm H2O2. As already shown in Fig. 2, preincubation of WT BMM with DETA-NO decreased both constitutive and H2O2-induced Prx overoxidation (Fig. 5A, compare lane 3 with lane 1 and lane 4 with lane 2). The same results were observed in Srx–/– BMM (compare lane 7 with lane 5 and lane 8 with lane 6), indicating that the effect of NO on the decrease of Prx overoxidation does not involve Srx. To further investigate a possible role of Srx on Prx regeneration, we measured the rate of Prx sulfinic acid reversion after a brief exposure to H2O2. Prx sulfinylation was measured at different time points in BMM preincubated with DETA-NO that were then exposed to H2O2 (100 μm) during 30 min and then washed and re-incubated in fresh medium (Fig. 5B). Densitometric analysis of immunoblots showed that the intensity of the H2O2-induced sulfinic acid signal had decreased by 50% after 1.5 h in WT control BMM and after only 45 min in DETA-NO-treated WT BMM. Furthermore, in lysates of Srx–/– BMM that had been incubated or not with NO, the signal of H2O2-induced sulfinylated Prx did not decrease, remaining high throughout the entire observation period. These results indicate that NO not only prevents Prx sulfinylation but also increases the efficiency of its in vivo reduction. They also confirm the crucial role of Srx in the reduction of sulfinylated 2-Cys Prxs in mammals. Signaling by oxygen- and nitrogen-derived species is attracting growing attention as its involvement in diverse cellular responses is being disclosed (30Finkel T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar, 31Forman H.J. Torres M. Fukuto J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 234–235: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). As these mediators are reactive, they can also potentially damage various biomolecules, making their control of prime importance for cell physiopathology (1Nathan C. Shiloh M.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8841-8848Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar, 32Espey M.G. Miranda K.M. Thomas D.D. Xavier S. Citrin D. Vitek M.P. Wink D.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Prxs are important cellular peroxide-scavenging enzymes and have been shown to also modulate signaling by H2O. Classical 2-Cys Prxs, which comprise Prx I-Prx IV, undergo reversible hydroperoxide-mediated inactivation by overoxidation of their catalytic cysteine to the sulfinic acid form (16Rhee S.G. Chae H.Z. Kim K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2005; 38: 1543-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar, 23Wood Z.A. Poole L.B. Karplus P.A. Science. 2003; 300: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar) and reduction by ATP-dependent sulfiredoxin and sestrins (18Biteau B. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. Nature. 2003; 425: 980-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar, 21Chang T.S. Jeong W. Woo H.A. Lee S.M. Park S. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50994-51001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). This inactivation, being unique to eukaryotic Prxs, has led to suggestions that it is an acquired gain of function selected for regulatory purposes (23Wood Z.A. Poole L.B. Karplus P.A. Science. 2003; 300: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have identified a novel cross-talk between the action of NO and H2O2 in primary macrophages. This cross-talk is based on the effect of NO of decreasing H2O2-induced 2-Cys Prx sulfinylation, of speeding up the regeneration of sulfinylated inactive enzymes, and of up-regulating Prx I, Prx VI, and Srx at mRNA and protein levels. These effects were observed whether NO was endogenously produced by NOS2 or delivered extracellularly by the slow NO donor DETA-NO and when Prxs were sulfinylated by H2O2 that was endogenously produced by stimulated macrophages or applied extracellularly. Our data also provide evidence that Prx V is induced in macrophages stimulated by IFN-γ and LPS, but in contrast to Prx I and Prx VI this induction is independent of NO production. Also, in contrast to what was observed for 2-Cys Prxs, H2O2-mediated overoxidation of 1-Cys Prx VI was not significantly altered by endogenous or exogenous NO, which is consistent with the fact that Srx is not able to reduce sulfinyl-Prx VI (29Woo H.A.

Taken together, these results indicate that NO production increases the Prx-dependent antioxidant capacity of macrophages, both by increasing Prx I and VI levels and by preserving typical 2-Cys Prxs in their reduced active form, particularly when macrophages release high amounts of H2O2. These data are in accordance with the growing body of evidence that NO has antioxidant properties (33Thomas D.D. Ridnour L.A. Espey M.G. Donzelli S. Ambs S. Hussain S.P. Harris C.C. DeGraff W.

Moro M.A. Neuropharmacology. 1999; 38: 1307-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). More importantly, they provide a mechanistic insight of this protective effect, as depicted in the model of Fig. 6. Prx V is also known as an efficient peroxynitrite reductase (39Dubuisson M. Vander Stricht D. Clippe A. Etienne F. Nauser T. Kissner R. Koppenol W.H. Rees J.F. Knoops B. FEBS Lett. 2004; 571: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and is partly located in mitochondria, a compartment expected to be a site of significant peroxynitrite production (40Moncada S. Bolanos J.P. J. Neurochem. 2006; 97: 1676-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Therefore, the increased expression of Prx V in IFN-γ- and LPS-activated macrophages might also represent a protection mechanism for avoiding the long-term toxic effects of NO that is produced by these activated cells. We thus propose that stimulated macrophages are likely to benefit from having a high level of active Prx to limit the collateral negative effects of ROS-mediated and nitrosative stress. An NO-dependent, but guanylate cyclase-independent, up-regulation of Prx I had been previously observed in LPS-stimulated rat liver macrophages (41Immenschuh S. Stritzke J. Iwahara S. Ramadori G. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 118-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), but the mechanism of this regulation was not further documented. The Prx I and Prx VI promoters contain sites for the NO-responsive transcription factor Nrf2 (42Gallagher B.M. Phelan S.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2007; 42: 1270-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 43Kim Y.J. Ahn J.Y. Liang P. Ip C. Zhang Y. Park Y.M.

Methods Enzymol. 2005; 396: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and macrophages of Nrf2-deficient mice are unable to induce Prx I expression in response to H2O2 and to electrophilic compounds (45Ishii T.

Similarly, Srx (also referred to as neoplastic progression 3) was highly induced in a strictly Nrf2-dependent manner in the liver of mice fed with the Nrf2-inducer 3H-1,2-dithiole-3-thione, as shown by DNA microarray analysis (46Kwak M.K.

It is therefore tempting to propose that NO, via the Nrf2/Keap1 system, contributes to an adaptive response to oxidative and nitrosative stresses by coordinate up-regulation of these three redox enzymes. The question arises: How does NO affect 2-Cys Prx overoxidation? Our data indicate that NO both prevented catalytic cysteine overoxidation and accelerated the rate of its recovery by sulfiredoxin (18Biteau B. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. Nature. 2003; 425: 980-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar, 21Chang T.S. Jeong W. Woo H.A. Lee S.M. Park S. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50994-51001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). We found that NO-exposed WT BMM displayed much lower constitutive amounts of Prx-SO2H (see Fig. 2A). As this effect was prominent as early as 2 h after exposing cells to NO (Fig. 2B), it could not be the consequence of faster reduction of the sulfinylated form of Prxs by Srx because induction of the later gene by NO peaked much later, at 5 h (Fig. 4). We also observed that the overoxidation of Prxs that resulted from a 30-min exposure to H2O2 was significantly lower in NO-treated versus untreated macrophages, also implying that the effect could not be a consequence of a more efficient reduction by Srx. In addition, the effect of NO pretreatment on the overoxidation of Prxs by exogenous H2O2 was fully maintained in Srx–/– BMM, further indicating that the effect of NO in preventing 2-Cys Prx overoxidation is unrelated to Srx (Fig. 4). Lipid hydroperoxide metabolites of arachidonic acid, which are commonly produced by stimulated macrophages, have recently been shown to reversibly overoxidize 2-Cys Prxs in cyclooxygenase- or lipoxygenase-overexpressing human cell lines (48Cordray P. Doyle K. Edes K. Moos P.J. Fitzpatrick F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32623-32629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It would be worth considering that NO, by scavenging lipid peroxyl radicals (49Hogg N. Kalyanaraman B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 378-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 50Bloodsworth A. O'Donnell V.B. Freeman B.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1707-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), decreases the level of 2-Cys Prx overoxidation. Alternatively, a plausible explanation is that Prxs from NO-producing macrophages are protected from overoxidation by H2O2 by a post-translational modification of its catalytic cysteine residues. Based on the role of S-glutathionylation in the adaptive response to oxidative stress (51Klatt P. Lamas S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4928-4944Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 52West M.B. Hill B.G. Xuan Y.T. Bhatnagar A. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 1715-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), protection of the Prx active site cysteine(s) by NO-induced disulfide formation with glutathione is an appealing hypothesis. Nevertheless, NO also affected the rate of the Srx-dependent reversion of sulfinylated Prxs. This was deduced from the faster decline in the amount of PrxI/II-SO2H generated by exogenous H2O2 in NO-treated versus untreated macrophages (Fig. 5B). Our data also revealed that in Srx-deficient BMM, H2O2-induced Prx sulfinylation remained stable over time, indicating that Srx is the major macrophage sulfinyl reductase and that no other enzyme can compensate for its deficiency in these cells. This finding is in keeping with the work of Chang et al. (21Chang T.S. Jeong W. Woo H.A. Lee S.M. Park S. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50994-51001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) showing that small interfering RNA-mediated Srx silencing delays Prx regeneration in epithelial cells. It also supports the idea that the effect of NO in accelerating Prx regeneration is mediated by NO-induced Srx up-regulation, thus exemplifying the role of Srx in modulating the redox state of Prxs in a physiological setting. To conclude, by pointing to Prxs as a cross-talk between NO and H2O2 signaling, we propose a novel control mechanism by which physiologically produced NO exerts an antioxidant effect. Increase in the amount of active Prxs is likely to represent a negative feedback loop to protect against excessive stress. It may also contribute to the redox control of the kinase/phosphatase balance. Further, the intrusion of the IFN-γ- and LPS-driven NOS2 as a new player in the Prx/Srx-regulating system of H2O2 flux opens a wide field for investigations of a connection between host defense and cell redox signaling.

We developed miniaturized, animal-borne video cameras to record the undisturbed behavior and foraging ecology of wild, free-ranging crows. Our video recordings enabled an estimate of the species' natural foraging efficiency and revealed that tool use, and choice of tool materials, are more diverse than previously thought. Video tracking has potential for studying the behavior and ecology of many other bird species that are shy or live in inaccessible habitats."

Here we show that NM23-H1 and its binding partner STRAP (serine-threonine kinase receptor-associated protein) interact with p53 and potentiate p53 activity. Both NM23-H1 and STRAP directly interact with the central DNA binding domain within residues 113-290. The use of NM23-H1 and STRAP mutants revealed that Cys145 of NM23-H1 and Cys152 (or Cys270) of STRAP were responsible for p53 binding. Furthermore, Cys176 and Cys135 of p53 were required to bind NM23-H1 and STRAP, respectively. Ectopic expression of wild-type NM23-H1 and STRAP, but not NM23-H1(C145S) and STRAP(C152S/C270S), positively regulated p53-mediated transcription in a dose-dependent manner. Knockdown of endogenous NM23-H1 or STRAP produced an opposite trend and inhibited the p53-mediated transcription. Similarly, NM23-H1 and STRAP stimulated p53-induced apoptosis and growth inhibition, whereas the NM23-H1(C145S) and STRAP(C152S/C270S) mutants had no effect. We also demonstrated that p53 activation by NM23-H1 and STRAP was mediated by removing Mdm2, a negative regulator of p53, from the p53-Mdm2 complex. These results suggest that NM23-H1 and its interacting partner STRAP physically interact with p53 and positively regulate its functions, including p53-induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. p53 plays a critical role in a variety of growth inhibitory responses, including cell cycle arrest, differentiation, and apoptosis, and contributes to tumor suppression.

For example, p14ARF (p19ARF in mice) is predominantly located within nucleoli, where it promotes p53 accumulation by binding to and sequestering Mdm2 and acts as a direct inhibitor of the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of Mdm2 (15Honda R. Yasuda H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). However, in response to stress, p53 stabilization may also occur through Mdm2-independent mechanisms.

These results suggest that the identification of additional interacting partners of p53 or Mdm2 will provide greater insight into the regulation of p53 activity. NM23-H1 was initially identified as a putative metastasis suppressor on the basis of its reduced expression in certain highly metastatic cell lines and tumors, even though its enzymatic activity provided no evidence for a role as a metastasis suppressor in tumor progression (22Steeg P.S. Bevilacqua G. Kopper L. Thorgeirsson U.P. Talmadge J.E. Liotta L.A. Sobel M.E. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1988; 80: 200-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). In humans, eight NM23 genes have been identified as follows: NM23-H1, NM23-H2, NM23-H3, NM23-H4, NM23-H5, NM23-H6, NM23-H7, and NM23-H8. These genes encode for nucleoside diphosphate kinases or for homologous isoforms (23Ishikawa N. Shimada N. Takagi Y. Ishijima Y. Fukuda M. Kimura N. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2003; 35: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Extensive studies using NM23 proteins have shown that they participate in the regulation of a broad spectrum of cellular responses, including development, differentiation, proliferation, endocytosis, and apoptosis (24Kimura N. Shimada N. Fukuda M. Ishijima Y. Miyazaki H. Ishii A. Takagi Y. Ishikawa N. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms underlying the role of NM23-H1 as a metastasis suppressor, however, have so far remained unclear. Serine-threonine kinase receptor-associated protein (STRAP), known as a transforming growth factor-β receptor-interacting protein, is a positive regulator of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) and negatively regulates TGF-β signaling by stabilizing the association between TGF-β receptor and Smad7 (25Seong H.-A. Jung H. Choi H.-S. Kim K.-T. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42897-42908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Recent studies also suggest that STRAP might be involved in tumorigenesis and development (26Halder S.K. Anumanthan G. Maddula R. Mann J. Chytil A. Gonzalez A.L. Washington M.K. Moses H.L.

We have recently reported that STRAP-induced inhibition of TGF-β signaling was enhanced by direct interaction with the NM23-H1 tumor suppressor, suggesting a possible link between TGF-β- and NM23-H1-mediated signaling pathways (28Seong H.-A. Jung H. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12075-12096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). TGF-β signaling has also been connected with p53-mediated signaling in which p53 cooperated with Smads for TGF-β gene responses (29Cordenonsi M. Dupont S. Maretto S. Insinga A. Imbriano C. Piccolo S. Cell. 2003; 113: 301-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that the NM23-H1 tumor suppressor and its interacting partner STRAP may play an important role in the regulation of a p53-induced signaling pathway in which they act as positive regulators of p53 activity by dissociating Mdm2, a known negative regulator of p53.

The p53(DBD) construct was generated by PCR using human p53 cDNA (Gen-Bank™ accession number NM000546) as the template. To generate p53(DBD) construct, PCR was performed using the following primers: forward primer (5′-GCGAATTCTTCTTGCATTCTGGGACA-3′) contains an EcoRI site (underlined), and reverse primer (5′-GCCTCGAGGCGGAGATTCTCTTCCTC-3′) contains an XhoI site (underlined). The amplified PCR products for construct were cut with EcoRI plus XhoI and cloned into a pFLAG-CMV2 vector using EcoRI plus SalI sites to generate the FLAG-DBD. To generate pEBG-DBD (GST-DBD), the EcoRI/BamHI fragment of FLAG-DBD was first subcloned into the EcoRI/BamHI site of pBluescript to make KS-DBD. The GST-DBD was generated after subcloning of the ClaI/NotI fragments of KS-DBD into the ClaI/NotI site of pEBG vector.

Preparation of Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Fractions—HeLa cells (∼4 × 105 per 60-mm dish) transfected with the indicated combinations of expression vectors (wild-type and mutant forms of NM23-H1 and STRAP) were used for the preparation of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions that were used in immunoblot analyses, as described previously (28Seong H.-A.

In Vivo Ubiquitination Assay—p53-null HCT116 cells were transiently transfected with expression plasmids encoding p53, NM23-H1, STRAP, and HA-tagged ubiquitin either alone or in combination using WelFect-Ex™ Plus. 44 h after transfection, the cells were treated with 10 μg/ml MG132 (Calbiochem) for 4 h, harvested, and then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4), lysed in 200 μl of Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 2% SDS, and incubated at 95 °C for 10 min. Tris-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100 (800 μl) was added to the lysate, and the mixture was incubated on ice after sonication and clarified by centrifugation at 4 °C for 30 min to remove cellular debris. Lysates (500 μg) were incubated with anti-p53 antibody. The immunoprecipitates were collected with protein A-Sepharose 4B, washed three times with Tris-buffered saline, separated by 8% SDS-PAGE, and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies and then developed using an ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Apoptosis Assay—The apoptosis assay was performed as described previously (25Seong H.-A. Jung H. Choi H.-S. Kim K.-T. Ha H. J. Biol.

Briefly, cells grown on sterile coverslips were transfected with pEGFP, an expression vector encoding GFP, together with expression vectors as indicated. 24 h after transfection, the cells were treated with 5-fluorouracil (3.8 mm), fixed with ice-cold 100% methanol, and then washed three times with PBS. The cells were then stained with a bisbenzimide (Hoechst 33258) and visualized under a fluorescence microscope.

The trypsinized cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with a solution (1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) consisting of 50 μg/ml propidium iodide and 1 mg/ml RNase A (Sigma). Flow cytometry analysis was performed on a FACSCalibur-S system (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), and cell cycle distribution was analyzed using the ModFitLT version 3.0 program (PMac). Immunofluorescence Staining—In brief, HeLa cells (34Park K. Kim K. Rho S.-B. Choi K. Kim D. Oh S.-H. Park J. Lee S.-H. Lee J.-H. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 749-757PubMed Google Scholar) were plated on sterile coverslips, transfected with the appropriate plasmids as indicated, placed on ice, and washed three times with ice-cold PBS prior to fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed with PBS, treated with 0.2% Triton X-100, and rewashed with PBS. The mouse anti-p53 antibody diluted 1000-fold in PBS or rabbit anti-NM23-H1 (or STRAP) antibody diluted 200-fold in PBS was applied for 2 h at 37 °C. The cells were then washed three times with PBS and incubated with a 1000-fold dilution of Alexa Fluor-594 anti-mouse secondary antibody or Alexa Fluor-488 anti-rabbit secondary antibody at 37 °C for 1 h. Cell nuclei were stained with 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole. The coverslips were washed three times with PBS and then mounted on glass slides using Gelvatol. The localized proteins were visualized on a Leica Dmire2 confocal laser-scanning microscope (Germany). NM23-H1 and STRAP Physically Interact with p53 in Vivo—We have found previously that the NM23-H1 tumor suppressor physically interacts with STRAP, a TGF-β receptor interacting protein and inhibits TGF-β signaling in cells (28Seong H.-A. Jung H. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12075-12096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). p53 activation is associated with its tumor suppressor function (1Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5799) Google Scholar), as well as with possible cross-talk between TGF-β- and p53-induced signaling (29Cordenonsi M. Dupont S. Maretto S. Insinga A. Imbriano C. Piccolo S. Cell. 2003; 113: 301-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Based on these data, we reasoned that NM23-H1 and its interacting partner STRAP might interact with p53 in intact cells. To examine whether NM23-H1 and STRAP directly bind to p53, we performed in vivo binding assays and coimmunoprecipitation experiments using exogenous or endogenous proteins in 293T, HeLa, and HepG2 cells. The interaction of FLAG-tagged NM23-H1 and STRAP proteins with endogenous p53 was analyzed by immunoprecipitation with an anti-p53 antibody, followed by immunoblotting with an anti-FLAG antibody. Both NM23-H1 and STRAP were detected in the p53 immunoprecipitate (Fig. 1A), indicating that NM23-H1 and STRAP physically interact with p53 in cells. To confirm the interaction of NM23-H1 and STRAP with p53 in vivo, we next performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments with endogenous proteins using an anti-p53 antibody, or preimmune IgG as a control. Both NM23-H1 and STRAP were only present in anti-p53 immune complexes from all cell lines tested, including 293T, HeLa, and HepG2 cells (Fig. 1B), demonstrating that NM23-H1 and STRAP physically interact with p53 in vivo. Furthermore, to verify a specific interaction between NM23 proteins and p53, we performed in vivo binding assays using five members of NM23 gene family, NM23-H1, NM23-H2, NM23-H3, NM23-H5, and NM23-H6. Coprecipitations between NM23-H1 and p53 and between NM23-H2 and p53 were only detected when NM23 proteins were expressed, whereas NM23-H3-p53, NM23-H5-p53, and NM23-H6-p53 interactions were not detectable (Fig. 1C). This result suggests that p53 selectively binds to NM23-H1 and -H2 among NM23 proteins. Physical Association between NM23-H1 and p53 or STRAP and p53 Is Affected by Cysteine Residues—Protein-protein interactions can be mediated by disulfide linkages as well as prototypical protein binding domains in interacting proteins (28Seong H.-A. Jung H. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12075-12096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 31Jung H. Kim T. Chae H.-Z. Kim K.-T. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15504-15510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Although STRAP contains six WD40 repeat regions that may be important for p53 binding, NM23-H1 lacks any of the typical protein binding domains that would potentially mediate its interaction with p53. In addition, it has been demonstrated recently that NM23-H1 and STRAP could be bridged through interchain disulfides (28Seong H.-A. Jung H. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12075-12096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Based on this, we speculated that the interaction of NM23-H1 and STRAP with p53 might be mediated by cysteine residues present in each of these two proteins. 293T cells were transiently transfected with expression vectors encoding GST-tagged wild-type NM23-H1 (GST-NM23-H1(WT)) or the GST-tagged NM23-H1 substitution mutants NM23-H1(C4S), NM23-H1(C109S), or NM23-H1(C145S), together with an expression vector for FLAG-tagged wild-type p53 (FLAG-p53). GST-NM23-H1 proteins were precipitated using glutathione-Sepharose beads, and complex formation between NM23-H1 and p53 proteins was examined by immunoblot analysis using an anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 2A, left panel). There was a dramatic decrease in complex formation in cells expressing NM23-H1(C145S) as compared with wild-type NM23-H1 (Fig. 2A, left top panel, 2nd versus 5th lane), whereas complex formation was not significantly influenced in cells expressing NM23-H1(C4S) and NM23-H1(C109S) (Fig. 2A, left top panel, 2nd versus 3rd and 4th lanes). These results suggest that Cys145 of NM23-H1 plays a critical role in the association of NM23-H1 with p53. We next determined whether STRAP interacts with p53 via a disulfide linkage because the cysteine residues within the WD40 repeat regions of STRAP (Cys152 and Cys270) affected complex formation between NM23-H1 and STRAP (28Seong H.-A. Jung H. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12075-12096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). 293T cells were cotransfected with expression plasmids encoding wild-type or mutant forms of GST-tagged STRAP, together with wild-type FLAG-p53. Coexpression of p53 with STRAP(C152S/270S) resulted in a remarkable decrease in complex formation between STRAP and p53 (Fig. 2A, right top panel, 2nd versus 5th lane), whereas coexpression of p53 with either STRAP (C152S) or STRAP(C270S) resulted in only a slight decrease in complex formation as compared with the expression of wild-type STRAP and p53 (Fig. 2A, right top panel, 2nd versus 3rd and 4th lanes). These results indicate that both Cys152 and Cys270 of STRAP play an important role in its association with p53. We also analyzed the association of purified, recombinant NM23-H1 or STRAP with p53 using nondenaturing PAGE. In vitro translated 35S-labeled p53 was incubated with unlabeled, recombinant NM23-H1 or STRAP. A shift in the mobility of 35S-labeled p53 was clearly evident upon incubation in the presence of wild-type NM23-H1 and STRAP, NM23-H1(C4S), NM23-H1(C109S), STRAP(C152S), and STRAP(C270S), but it was undetectable when 35S-labeled p53 was in"
https://openalex.org/W2057830963,"It has been generally thought that scleractinian corals form purely aragonitic skeletons. We show that a well-preserved fossil coral, Coelosmilia sp. from the Upper Cretaceous (about 70 million years ago), has preserved skeletal structural features identical to those observed in present-day scleractinians. However, the skeleton of Coelosmilia sp. is entirely calcitic. Its fine-scale structure and chemistry indicate that the calcite is primary and did not form from the diagenetic alteration of aragonite. This result implies that corals, like other groups of marine, calcium carbonate–producing organisms, can form skeletons of different carbonate polymorphs."
https://openalex.org/W1984494145,"Class I phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathways regulate several important cellular functions, including cellular growth, division, survival, and movement. Class IB PI3K (also known as PI3Kgamma) links heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein-coupled receptors to these pathways. Activation of class IB PI3K results in the rapid synthesis of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate [PtdIns(3,4,5)P3] and its dephosphorylation product PtdIns(3,4)P2 in the plasma membrane. These two lipid messengers bind to pleckstrin homology domain-containing effectors that regulate a complex signaling web downstream of receptor activation. Characteristic features of this pathway are the regulation of protein kinases and the regulation of small guanosine triphosphatases that control cellular movement, adhesion, contraction, and secretion. Most of the ligands that activate class IB PI3K are involved in coordinating the body's response to injury and infection, and recent studies suggest that small molecule inhibitors of this enzyme may represent a novel class of anti-inflammatory therapeutic agents."
https://openalex.org/W1981143815,"The Hedgehog (Hh) family of secreted signaling proteins is a master regulator of cell fate determination in metazoans, contributing to both pattern formation during embryonic development and postembryonic tissue homeostasis. In a universally used mode of action, graded distribution of Hh protein induces differential cell fate in a dose-dependent manner in cells that receive Hh. Though much of this pathway has been elucidated from genetically based studies in model organisms, such as Drosophila and mice, the importance of Hh-mediated signaling in humans is clearly evident from malformations and a broad range of cancers that arise when the pathway is corrupted."

Antibodies can bind antigens with high affinity and high specificity. Their binding domains can be artificially expressed as recombinant single polypeptide chains. This allows the construction of recombinant antibody libraries in bacteria from which antibodies with desired binding properties can be selected (1Hoogenboom H.R. Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 1105-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar).

In addition, several other single domain scaffolds are emerging now (2Holt L.J. Herring C. Jespers L.S. Woolven B.P. Tomlinson I.M.

Sci. 2001; 26: 230-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). One promising alternative to the scFv fragments are the variable domains of heavy chain antibodies from Camelidae (VHH). They are naturally devoid of light chains and contain the full antigen binding capacity in a single polypeptide chain (4Hamers-Casterman C. Atarhouch T. Muyldermans S. Robinson G. Hamers C.

Furthermore, the availability of recombinant fluorescent antibodies would simplify traditional immunoassays and be a major advance for modern fluorescence imaging techniques, e.g. in the emerging field of biosensors of protein activities. However, the efficient production of direct fusions between recombinant antibodies and fluorescent proteins in Escherichia coli has been a major challenge. Because recombinant antibodies contain disulfide bonds, they require an oxidizing environment for correct folding and are therefore expressed either in the secretory pathway of eukaryotic cells or more commonly in the periplasm of bacteria (7Frenken L.G. van der Linden R.H.

Methods Enzymol. 1989; 178: 497-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In contrast, fluorescent proteins like green fluorescent protein (GFP) fold correctly in the cytosol but not in the periplasm of E. coli (9Feilmeier B.J. Iseminger G. Schroeder D. Webber H. Phillips G.J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4068-4076Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). For example, scFv-GFP fusions have been produced only in a few cases in E. coli and not surprisingly only at very low yields of active protein (10Casey J.L. Coley A.M. Tilley L.M. Foley M.

Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 18: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In exceptional cases, antibody scaffolds are stable without the formation of disulfide bonds (15Worn A.

Biol. 2003; 332: 489-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). This is probably a prerequisite for the reported stable folding of some antibody fragment-GFP fusions expressed as intrabodies in cultured eukaryotic cells (17Bazl M.R. Rasaee M.J. Foruzandeh M.

A general solution to the folding problem of fusions of recombinant antibodies and fluorescent proteins is still lacking, however. In this study, we report an efficient solution to this folding problem for a subclass of recombinant antibodies that are especially suited for the generation of fluorescent antibodies. We designed and tested a direct selection strategy based on the coexpression of a chaperone to obtain fluorescent single domain antibodies engineered for efficient expression in the cytosol of wild-type E. coli. We used this novel approach for the selection of fluorescent antibodies directed against microtubules. We demonstrate proper folding and high specificity and affinity of a selected microtubule biomarker. Plasmid Construction—For the cytosolic expression of fluorescent VHH, the fluobody vector pAOD-GFP was constructed by inserting PCR-amplified monomeric GFP (upstream primer, 5′-GGACTTGGCGGCCGCAGCGGTTCTGGTCCGGGCGGTTCACCGGTGGGTATGAGCGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGGAG-3′; and downstream primer, 5′-CTGAACCGCTCCAACTTGGATCCTTACTTAACTATTAGGTACCATCTGAGTACTTGTACAG-3′) (a kind gift from Jennifer Lippincott-Schwartz) between the NotI and BamHI sites of plasmid pETM-82 (a kind gift from Gunter Stier, European Molecular Biology Laboratory). The generated plasmid encodes the leaderless disulfide bond isomerase DsbC (disulfide bond oxidoreductase and isomerase C), followed by a His6 tag, a tobacco etch virus protease site, and monomeric GFP. VHH genes can be inserted between the tobacco etch virus site and monomeric GFP using the NcoI and NotI restriction sites. For analysis of the folding of VHH Tub1, the pAOD-Tub1 vector was generated by removing monomeric GFP from pAOD-Tub1-GFP using the NotI and Acc65I sites. The plasmid was religated after removal of the overhang using mung bean nuclease. pAOZ-Tub1 and the pAOZ-Tub1-GFP were created by replacing DsbC in pAOD-Tub1 and pAOD-Tub1-GFP with the Z tag from the pETM-Z vector (a kind gift from Günter Stier) using XbaI and NcoI restriction sites. For periplasmic expression in E. coli XL1-Blue cells (20Skerra A. Pluckthun A. Science. 1988; 240: 1038-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar), VHH Tub1 was recloned into the expression vector pHEN6 (21Conrath K.E. Lauwereys M. Galleni M. Matagne A. Frere J.M. Kinne J. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 2807-2812Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) using the restriction enzymes NcoI and NotI. To generate a bivalent Tub1 antibody, PCR-amplified Tub1 (upstream primer, 5′-CTCGCGGCCCAGCCGGCCATGGCGGATGTGCAGCTTCAGGCGTCTGGG-3′; and downstream primer, 5′-GCATTGGTTCTGCAGTTGCACATCTGACGGCGGGGTGGACGGAGACGGCCGCGGCGGGGTAGACGGGCCCGATGAGGAGACGGTGACCTGG-3′) was inserted between the NcoI and PstI sites of pAOD-Tub1-GFP. The two Tub1 VHH domains are separated by a modified hinge domain of IgA in this newly created pAOD-bivTub1-GFP construct. Immunization and Library Construction—A llama (Eurogentec) was injected six times subcutaneously at weekly intervals with 500 μg of a mixture of highly purified pig brain tubulin and partially purified Xenopus laevis egg extract tubulin (22Liska A.J. Popov A.V. Sunyaev S. Coughlin P. Habermann B. Shevchenko A. Bork P. Karsenti E. Proteomics. 2004; 4: 2707-2721Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Sixty days after the start of the immunization, peripheral blood lymphocytes were isolated from 300 ml of blood (Lymphoprep, Axis-Shield). The RNA was extracted from the lymphocytes using the RNA II purification kit (Macherey-Nagel). mRNA was isolated using oligo(dT) magnetic beads (Dynal Biotech), and the cDNA was prepared using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Gene fragments encoding the variable and CH2 domains were amplified by PCR using primers 5′-GTCCTGGCTGCTCTTCTACAAGG-3′ and 5′-GGTACGTGCTGTTGAACTGTTCC-3′, which anneal at the leader sequence and at the CH2 exon of the heavy chains of all llama immunoglobulins, respectively. The 600-bp fragments (VHH-CH2 without the CH1 exon) were eluted from an agarose gel after separation from the 900-bp fragments (VH-CH1-CH2 exons). Because all VHH molecules belong to the same family (family III), they could be amplified by one additional PCR with primers 5′-AACATGCCATGACTCGCGGCTCAACCGGCCATGGCTGAKGTBCAGCTGCAGGCGTCTGGRGGAGG-3′ and 5′-ATTATTATTCAGATTATTAGTGCGGCCGCGTGAGGAGACGGTGACCWGGGTCC-3′, which anneal at the framework 1 and 4 regions, respectively. The final PCR fragments were ligated into the modified phagemid vector pHEN4 (23Arbabi Ghahroudi M. Desmyter A. Wyns L. Hamers R. Muyldermans S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 521-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar) using the upstream restriction site NcoI or PstI and the downstream restriction site NotI. Ligated material was transformed into E. coli TG1 cells. This phagemid library was stored at –80 °C in LB medium supplemented with glycerol (50% final concentration). Selection by Phage Display—To display VHH on phages, the phagemid library was expressed after infection with M13K07ΔpIII hyperphages (24Rondot S. Koch J. Breitling F. Dubel S. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) (Progen). VHH molecules recognizing microtubules were enriched by three consecutive rounds of in vitro selection. Selection was achieved by co-sedimentation of phages with microtubules (stabilized by the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog GMP-CPP (25Desai A. Mitchison T.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 83-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (1905) Google Scholar)) at 30,000 × g, followed by resuspension of phages after depolymerization of microtubules in cold water. Phage particles were finally used to infect exponentially growing E. coli TG1 cells. Selection of Fluobodies—To directly screen for functional fluobodies, after the third round of panning, the selected colonies were pooled; phagemid DNA was extracted; and the VHH inserts were cloned NcoI-NotI in the pAOD-GFP vector, thus creating the fluobody library. Several hundred colonies were picked to isolate individual plasmids using a 96-well miniprep kit (Macherey-Nagel). The plasmids were individually transformed into E. coli BL21 Star-pRARE cells and spotted on plates. Single colonies were grown in 96-well plates in LB medium supplemented with 0.1% glucose and antibiotics until A600 = 0.6–0.8 was reached. Fluobody expression was then induced with 500 μm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 12 h at 18 °C. After centrifugation, the cell pellets were lysed and centrifuged again. The cleared lysate was directly used at a 1:100 dilution in immunofluorescence (see below) on normal rat kidney (NRK) cells cultured in glass-bottom 96-well plates. Automated acquisition of cell images was performed using a Zeiss Cell Observer microscope with a ×40 objective and Zeiss AxioVision software. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Antibodies—For the purification of fluobodies, the plasmid constructs were transformed into E. coli BL21 Star-pRARE cells and induced as described above. Cell lysates were cleared and loaded onto a Proteino ®/Ni-TED resin affinity column (Macherey-Nagel). The eluted fraction was dialyzed, and if necessary, cleavage with a His6-tagged tobacco etch virus protease (European Molecular Biology Laboratory) was performed overnight at 4 °C. The tobacco etch virus protease was removed together with the cleaved DsbC-His6 tag by chromatography using a Talon metal affinity matrix (Clontech), and the purity of the protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Tub1cut_DsbC and DsbC-bivTub1-GFP were further purified using HiTrap SP and Superose 6 columns (Amersham Biosciences), respectively. The final yield of purified VHH was determined using the theoretical extinction coefficient for the absorption at 280 nm. CD spectra were measured with a Jasco Labor spectropolarimeter. Immunofluorescence—NRK cells (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured on glass coverslips under standard conditions and fixed using a protocol for preservation of cytoskeletal structures (26Bell Jr., P.B. Safiejko-Mroczka B. Scanning Microsc. 1995; 9 (Discussion 858–860): 843-857PubMed Google Scholar). Fixed cells were incubated with fluorescent VHH (20–500 nm) or with periplasmically expressed VHH-His6 (100 nm) for 1 h. For indirect immunofluorescence, an anti-pentahistidine monoclonal antibody (1:500; Qiagen Inc.) or a rabbit anti-α-tubulin polyclonal antibody (1:300; Abcam) was used, followed by an Alexa 488-labeled anti-mouse or Alexa 595- or Alexa 488-labeled anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:800; Molecular Probes). DNA was visualized by 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining (0.02 μg/ml). Coverslips were mounted with Dako mounting medium. Images were taken with a Zeiss Cell Observer microscope with a ×63 oil objective using AxioVision software. In Vitro Microtubule Binding Assay—Gel-filtered fluobodies were precentrifuged at 85,000 rpm and then incubated at a concentration of 500 nm for 10 min with microtubules (5 μm tubulin) in BRB80 (80 mm PIPES (pH 6.8), 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EGTA) supplemented with 40 μm Taxol, 10% glycerol, and 150 mm NaCl. The mixture was ultracentrifuged at 40,000 rpm for 10 min. Co-sedimentation was assessed by analyzing equal volumes of resuspended pellet and supernatant by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. For Kd measurements, 2, 6, or 20 nm gel-filtrated and precentrifuged monovalent or bivalent VHH-GFP was mixed with 0.1 nm to 1 μm microtubules in the presence of 1 μm β-casein (Sigma). After ultracentrifugation for 5 min at 85,000 rpm, the fluorescence of unbound fluobody in the supernatant and of microtubule-bound fluobody in the dissolved pellet was measured using a Safire2™ spectrofluorometer (Tecan). Concentrations were calculated from the fluorescence signals using a calibration curve. The concentrations of free binding sites on the microtubules were obtained as the difference between the total microtubule concentration in the experiment and the measured concentration of bound fluobodies. A hyperbolic fit (F = Fmax·M/ (Kd + M)) to the concentration of microtubule-bound fluobodies (F) as a function of the concentration of free binding sites on microtubules (M) provided the dissociation constant (Kd). In Vitro Microtubule Bundling Assay—A solution of 50 nm gelfiltrated fluobodies was precentrifuged at 70,000 rpm and then incubated for 10 min with tetramethylrhodamine-labeled microtubules in BRB80 supplemented with 150 mm NaCl and 20 μm Taxol. A sample of the mixture was directly observed between slide and coverslip by fluorescence microscopy (see above). We developed a direct screen for correctly folded and functional fluorescent antibodies starting from a library of recombinant antibody genes. Llama VHH was chosen as the antibody scaffold because llama VHH often has only one disulfide bond, whereas camel VHH and scFv fragments usually have two disulfide bonds that are required for their stability. Because our strategy is based on the cytosolic expression of VHH-GFP fusions, it was important to increase the probability of disulfide bond formation of VHH in the cytosol of bacteria without interfering with the GFP folding. Therefore, we first tested whether a method originally developed for improved disulfide bond formation of scFv molecules expressed in the cytosol of bacteria (29Zhang Z. Li Z.H. Wang F. Fang M. Yin C.C. Zhou Z.Y. Lin Q. Huang H.L. Protein. Expression Purif. 2002; 26: 218-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 30Jurado P. Ritz D. Beckwith J. de Lorenzo V. Fernandez L.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) could be adapted for VHH-GFP. To this end, we fused the leaderless disulfide bond isomerase DsbC, which is usually involved in disulfide bond maturation in the periplasm (31Segatori L. Paukstelis P.J. Gilbert H.F. Georgiou G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10018-10023Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 32Missiakas D. Georgopoulos C. Raina S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2013-2020Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), to the N terminus of the test VHH molecule Re3, directed against the small GTPase Ran (33Olichon A. Schweizer D. Muyldermans S. de Marco A. BMC Biotechnol. 2007; 7: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), which also carried a C-terminal GFP extension. This construct could be expressed in the cytosol of the standard E. coli strain BL21(DE3) with a high yield (supplemental Fig. 1A). We furthermore showed that VHH was functional using a binding assay (supplemental Fig. 1B) and that the GFP fluorophore had formed using fluorescence spectroscopy (supplemental Fig. 1C). We did not succeed in expressing VHH-GFP without the DsbC tag in a functional and fluorescent form in either the cytosol or the periplasm of various E. coli strains. These results suggest that the leaderless DsbC tag might also promote the efficient production of other functional recombinant VHH-GFP antibodies in the bacterial cytosol. To demonstrate that fluobodies can be produced using a systematic approach, we decided to generate recombinant fluorescent antibodies that recognize microtubules and that can be used, for example, as convenient biomarkers of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton. To this end, we first produced a phagemid library containing VHH genes from lymphocytes of a llama that was immunized with tubulin. The size of the library was assessed by measuring the number of initial transformants, which was >107. The complexity of the library was tested by sequencing 50 randomly picked clones (23Arbabi Ghahroudi M. Desmyter A. Wyns L. Hamers R. Muyldermans S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 521-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar) that were all found to be different. This indicates that the library was diverse. The procedure for the subsequent selection of fluorescent microtubule binders from this library consisted of two consecutive steps (Fig. 1A). Step 1 involved conventional phage display (biopanning) (34Sidhu S.S. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2000; 11: 610-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) to enrich for binders of microtubules in vitro and to reduce the size of the library for the next step. No co-selection for certain folding and fluorescence properties of VHH takes place here. The VHH folds in the bacterial periplasm without GFP while being fused to a surface protein of the phage. Step 2 involves a novel direct immunofluorescence screen of fixed eukaryotic cells stained with bacterial lysates of a sublibrary expressing DsbC-VHH-GFP fusions in the cytosol. This second step co-selects in a very time-efficient manner for both specific antigen binding of VHH and generation of the fluorophore of GFP. Both requirements are fulfilled only if the VHH-GFP fusion folds efficiently in the cytosol. The transition from the first biopanning by conventional phage display (35Bradbury A.R. Marks J.D. J. Immunol. Methods. 2004; 290: 29-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) to the second screen using direct immunofluorescence was made possible by subcloning the polyclonal pool of the VHH DNA from the selected phagemids after the last round of biopanning into a vector for cytosolic fluobody expression. This step generated a sublibrary with a pool of DsbC-VHH-GFP fusions, which was already enriched for tubulin binders by the previous biopanning. Several hundred individual clones of this fluobody sublibrary were then grown in liquid culture in 96-well plates. After cytosolic expression of the fluobodies, clarified cell lysates were used for the direct immunofluorescence screen of fixed NRK cells that were also grown in 96-well plates (Fig. 1B). Automatic fluorescence imaging of the fluobody-stained NRK cells allowed the rapid identification of those clones that could be efficiently expressed in a functional form and that selectively bound microtubules in the presence of other cellular proteins. Of the nine identified clones, six differed in sequence (Fig. 1C). All six fluobodies could be expressed and purified to further analyze their ability to label the microtubule cytoskeleton in NRK cells. In conclusion, our screen allowed the fast identification of the first anti-tubulin fluorescent antibodies produced in E. coli. The fluobody clone (Tub1) giving the best staining of the microtubule cytoskeleton in direct immunofluorescence (Fig. 1D) was selected for further characterization. First, we showed by fluorescence spectroscopy that the GFP fluorescence was not impaired by the presence of DsbC during cytosolic expression (Fig. 2A), confirming the result with the test VHH molecule Re3 (see above). Next, we determined the secondary structure of the Tub1 VHH domain by CD spectroscopy (36Greenfield N.J. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 2876-2890Crossref PubMed Scopus (2264) Google Scholar) using constructs lacking C-terminal GFP. A DsbC-Tub1 fusion was expressed in the bacterial cytosol, and the structure of only the VHH domain was analyzed after proteolytic removal of the DsbC tag (producing Tub1cut_DsbC). The CD spectrum was characteristic for the native β-strand fold of VHH and indistinguishable from purified Tub1 expressed in the periplasm without DsbC (periTub1) (Fig. 2B). We also expressed in the cytosol a Z-Tub1 fusion as a control, in which the DsbC domain was replaced by the commonly used Z tag (a domain from Staphylococcus aureus protein A). Our aim was to determine whether a tag that can improve solubility but that has no disulfide oxidoreductase and isomerase activity could promote correct Tub1 folding in the cytosol. Although Z-Tub1 was as soluble as DsbC-Tub1 (supplemental Table 1), after removal of the Z tag, the purified VHH domain (Tub1cut_Z) was partially insoluble, and the soluble fraction showed a significant degree of random coil structure (Fig. 2B). This indicates that the enzymatic activity of DsbC is required for the correct folding of Tub1 in the bacterial cytosol. This conclusion was supported by two additional experiments comparing the binding properties of different Tub1 constructs. First, in a biochemical antigen binding assay, Tub1cut_DsbC and periTub1, but not Tub1cut_Z, co-sedimented with microtubules in vitro (data not shown). Second, in contrast to DsbC-Tub1-GFP, a fluorescent Z-Tub1-GFP construct (Fig. 2A) expressed in the cytoplasm did not label microtubules upon direct immunofluorescence of fixed NRK cells (Fig. 2C), most likely because the VHH domain was not folded in this construct. In contrast and as expected, periTub1 specifically labeled microtubules upon indirect immunofluorescence using a secondary detection antibody (Fig. 2C). To test the specificity of Tub1 for microtubules by comparison with the control VHH Re3, purified Tub1-GFP was produced with a yield of 28 mg of purified protein/liter of bacterial culture. First, we showed by SDS gel electrophoresis that the Tub1 fluobody co-sedimented with microtubules in vitro, in contrast to the Re3 fluobody, which did not bind to microtubules (Fig. 3B). Similarly, Tub1-GFP, but not the control fluobody, co-localized to microtubules in NRK cells with the rabbit anti-α-tubulin polyclonal antibody (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, the labeling by direct immunofluorescence with Tub1-GFP (Figs. 1D, 2C, and 3A) appeared generally slightly more confined along the contour of the microtubules than the labeling by indirect immunofluorescence used for the secondary detection of periTub1 (Fig. 2C) or of the anti-α-tubulin polyclonal antibody (Fig. 3A). Taken together, these results confirm that the Tub1-GFP fluobody is specific for microtubules while offering advantages because of its high yield of production, ease of use, and the potential to be further engineered, e.g. by exchanging GFP with another fluorescent protein. Finally, we tested whether we could engineer the properties of the Tub1-GFP fluobody by transforming it from a monovalent to a bivalent antibody. We constructed a tandem repetition of the Tub1 VHH domain separated by a linker. The bivalent DsbC-bivTub1-GFP fluobody could also be expressed in the bacterial cytosol (Fig. 3C), but at lower yields compared with the monovalent version. To compare the affinities of the bivalent and monovalent fluobodies, we measured binding curves in vitro by co-sedimentation with microtubules, a simple method commonly used for microtubule-associated proteins (37Wallis K.T. Azhar S. Rho M.B. Lewis S.A. Cowan N.J. Murphy D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15158-15167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using directly the GFP fluorescence of the fluobodies as a readout. As expected, the affinity of the bivalent antibody was higher than that of the monovalent fluobody (Fig. 3D). The dissociation constants of the monovalent and bivalent fluobodies (Kd = 31.2 ± 3.2 and 2.4 ± 0.3 nm, respectively) were in the range of those reported for other mono- or bivalent VHH molecules (38Spinelli S. Frenken L. Bourgeois D. de Ron L. Bos W. Verrips T. Anguille C. Cambillau C. Tegoni M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 752-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 39Zarebski L.M. Urrutia M. Goldbaum F.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 349: 814-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 40Conrath K.E. Lauwereys M. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7346-7350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The surprisingly low increase of affinity due to bivalency could be a consequence of steric constraints imposed on the VHH molecule when also the second domain of bivalent VHH binds to the rigid structure as a microtubule. We could furthermore show by fluorescence microscopy with rhodamine-labeled microtubules polymerized in vitro that the affinity increase of the bivalent fluobody was correlated with its transformation into an artificial microtubule cross-linking molecule (Fig. 3E). Bivalent bivTub1-GFP bound along microtubules and organized them into large bundles, whereas monovalent Tub1-GFP co-localized only with microtubules, but did not bundle them significantly. The VHH Re3-GFP control did not bind to microtubules, as expected (see also above). These results indicate that both VHH domains are functional in the purified bivalent fluobody and that they provide a nice example for the possibility to tailor the properties of recombinant antibodies to create molecules with novel functionalities. In this study, we have demonstrated that llama single domain antibodies with single disulfide bonds fold correctly and can be produced very efficiently in the cytosol of bacteria. On the basis of this solution to the folding problem of recombinant antibodies in a reducing environment, we developed a method for the efficient production of genetically encoded fluorescent antibodies using llama VHH domains as a scaffold. Coexpression of fluorescent proteins and recombinant antibodies has so far been a major challenge, preventing the use of recombinant antibodies routinely as biosensors of, for example, protein activities, taking advantage of modern fluorescence imaging techniques. Because our method can probably also be used for the coexpression of recombinant VHH antibodies with other cytosolic proteins, it extends the repertoire of functionalities that can be engineered with recombinant antibodies. The possibility to tailor their properties at will promises to open new lines of research in the fields of biomarkers, biosensors, and nanobiotechnology.

https://openalex.org/W1967944377,"B cell-specific expression of immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) genes utilizes two cis regulatory regions, the intronic enhancer (Eμ), located in the JH-Cμ intron, and a complex regulatory region that lies 3′ to the IgH gene cluster, 3′ RR. We hypothesized that the 3′ RR is involved in IgH gene transcription in plasma cells via physical interaction between distal 3′ RR enhancers and target VH sequences, with loop formation by intervening DNA. In support of this hypothesis we report sequence data at DNA recombination breakpoints as evidence for loop formation preceding DNA inversion in a plasma cell line. In addition, using the chromosome conformation capture technique, physical interactions between VH and 3′ RR were analyzed directly and detected in MPC11 plasma cells and variants and normal splenic B cells but not detected in splenic T cells or in non-B cells. VH-3′ RR interactions were present in the absence of Eμ, but when the hs1,2 enhancer was replaced by a NeoR gene in a variant cell line lacking Eμ, H chain expression was lost, and interactions between VH and 3′ RR and among the 3′ RR regulators themselves were severely disrupted. In addition, the chromosome conformation capture technique detected interactions between the myc promoter and 3′ RR elements in MPC11, which like other plasmacytomas contains a reciprocal translocation between the c-myc and the IgH locus. In sum, our data support a hypothesis that cis VH-3′ RR and myc-3′ RR interactions involve physical interactions between these DNA elements. B cell-specific expression of immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) genes utilizes two cis regulatory regions, the intronic enhancer (Eμ), located in the JH-Cμ intron, and a complex regulatory region that lies 3′ to the IgH gene cluster, 3′ RR.

During B cell development, antibody heavy chain genes undergo sequential DNA recombination and mutation events. These include construction of the variable region gene (VDJ joining), which occurs very early in B cell development, synthesis of membrane Ig, class switch recombination, and somatic hypermutation at the mature B cell stage, and secretion of IgH from plasma cells. Key cis regulators of B cellspecific expression of immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) 5The abbreviations used are: IgH, immunoglobulin heavy chain; 3′ RR, 3′ regulatory region; CSR, class switch recombination; 3C, chromosome conformation capture; BAC, bacterial artificial chromosome; kb, kilobase(s). genes are VH promoters, I region promoters located upstream of each constant region gene, and two sets of enhancers (the intronic enhancer (Eμ) located in the JH-Cμ intron and a complex regulatory region that lies 3′ of the IgH gene locus (3′ RR) (1Max E.E. Paul W.E. Fundamental Immunology. 5th Ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2003: 107-158Google Scholar)). The murine 3′ RR contains four enhancers arrayed in two separate structural and functional units (2Saleque S. Singh M. Little R.D. Giannini S.L. Michaelson J.S. Birshtein B.K. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4780-4787PubMed Google Scholar) together with a recently identified downstream extension, which contains additional DNase I hypersensitive sites, binding sites for CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), and insulator sequences (3Garrett F.E. Emelyanov A.V. Sepulveda M.A. Flanagan P. Volpi S. Li F. Loukinov D. Eckhardt L.A. Lobanenkov V.V. Birshtein B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1511-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Initial insight into the contribution of 3′ RR enhancers to high levels of IgH gene expression in plasma cells came from analysis of cell lines containing deletions of intronic or 3′ RR enhancers. These data include 1) maintenance of IgH chain expression in plasma cell lines at high levels despite deletion of the intronic enhancer (4Eckhardt L.A. Birshtein B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 856-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), 2) ∼90% reduction in IgH expression in a plasma cell line that has a deletion of 3′ RR regulators extending from hs3a to hs4 (5Gregor P.D. Morrison S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 1903-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 6Michaelson J.S. Giannini S.L. Birshtein B.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 975-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and 3) complete loss of H chain expression from a plasma cell line that has a combination of a deletion of the intronic enhancer and substitution of the hs1,2 enhancer by the NeoR gene (7Lieberson R. Ong J. Shi X. Eckhardt L.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6229-6238Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Knock-out mouse models have provided insight into the contribution of 3′ enhancers to CSR; a combined deletion of hs3b and hs4 affects CSR to all isotypes except IgG1 (8Pinaud E. Khamlichi A.A. Le Morvan C. Drouet M. Nalesso V. Le Bert M. Cogne M. Immunity. 2001; 15: 187-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), whereas a deletion of all 3′ IgH sequences from a BAC transgenic mouse affected CSR to all isotypes (9Dunnick W.A. Shi J. Graves K.A. Collins J.T. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 1459-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, the contribution of the entire endogenous 3′ RR to heavy chain expression in plasma cells has not been addressed by knock-out models, and no phenotype was detected upon examination of other 3′ RR deletions in cell lines, including a combined deletion of hs3a and hs1,2 (10Saleque S. Singh M. Birshtein B.K. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2791-2803PubMed Google Scholar) and a specific deletion of hs4 (11Zhang B. Alaie-Petrillo A. Kon M. Li F. Eckhardt L.A. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 6297-6306Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). These various observations suggest a potential physical interaction between distal 3′ RR enhancers and target IgH sequences, with intervening DNA sequences forming loops. The distances involved are as much as ∼40-180 kb. Previous experiments identified a plasma cell line in which DNA rearrangements detected by genomic Southern analysis were consistent with an inversion of sequences extending from VH to 3′ RR (12Calvo C.-F. Giannini S.L. Martinez N. Birshtein B.K. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 1353-1360PubMed Google Scholar). Here we report DNA sequence analysis of recombination breakpoints that explains this inversion by recombination between the VH gene and the 3′ RR. To determine whether VH-3′ RR interactions regularly occur, we have implemented the chromosome conformation capture (3C) technique, which captures transient interactions between otherwise linearly distant DNA sequences. This method has been used to analyze the effects of enhancers on target promoters in the β-globin and TH2 cytokine loci (13Tolhuis B. Palstra R.J. Splinter E. Grosveld F. de Laat W. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1453-1465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar, 14Vakoc C.R. Letting D.L. Gheldof N. Sawado T. Bender M.A. Groudine M. Weiss M.J. Dekker J. Blobel G.A.

Immunol. 2004; 5: 1017-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Of particular pertinence to the regulation of antibody gene regulation is a recent study that has shown 3C interactions between DNA segments containing the κ intronic and 3′ enhancers and the expressed Vκ gene both in the MPC11 plasmacytoma cell line and in normal splenic B cells (16Liu Z. Garrard W.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3220-3231Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This interaction likely reflects the impact of intronic and distal enhancers on transcriptional activation of κ expression. The 3C experiments reported here have confirmed interactions in cis between VH sequences and 3′ RR enhancers in the MPC11 plasma cell line and in normal resting B cells. Interactions in cis between the myc exon 2 promoter and 3′ RR enhancers were also detected in MPC11, which like other plasmacytoma cell lines contains a reciprocal chromosomal translocation that brings the myc oncogene under the control of IgH regulatory sequences. Analysis of MPC11 variants with deletions of endogenous intronic or 3′ enhancers has addressed the role of specific VH-3′ RR interactions in heavy chain expression. Cells—The mouse plasmacytoma cell line, MPC11 (BALB/c, IgG2b, κ), synthesizes a 55-kDa heavy chain and has a single JH region and intronic enhancer associated with the expressed γ2b chain (17Eckhardt L.A. Tilley S.A. Lang R.B. Marcu K.B. Birshtein B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3006-3010Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The IgH unexpressed allele has undergone a reciprocal chromosomal translocation with the myc oncogene (18Stanton L.W. Yang J.Q. Eckhardt L.A. Harris L.J. Birshtein B.K. Marcu K.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 829-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). 9921 cells were derived from MPC11 via an intermediate (9.7.1) (19Koskimies S. Birshtein B.K. Nature. 1976; 264: 480-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). These cells synthesize IgG2a instead of the parental IgG2b as a result of a deletion that juxtaposes the MPC11-rearranged VH gene to switch γ2a sequences (17Eckhardt L.A. Tilley S.A. Lang R.B. Marcu K.B. Birshtein B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3006-3010Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In the course of the DNA recombination, the intronic enhancer and Cγ2b sequences were deleted. B48 cells, obtained from Laurel Eckhardt, Hunter College, The City University of New York, were derived from 9921, differing only in the substitution of the NeoR gene for the hs1,2 enhancer on the expressed allele. H chain expression is completely absent from B48 cells (7Lieberson R. Ong J. Shi X. Eckhardt L.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6229-6238Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). F5.5 cells were derived from MPC11 via an intermediate (ICR4.68) (20Gilmore G.L. Bard J.A. Birshtein B.K. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 1754-1761PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of F5.5 cDNA showed that the expressed 50-kDa γ2b H chain resulted from a single base insertion leading to a premature termination (20Gilmore G.L. Bard J.A. Birshtein B.K. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 1754-1761PubMed Google Scholar). Genomic Southern analysis of F5.5 revealed a second JH-associated map and a Cϵ rearrangement (20Gilmore G.L. Bard J.A. Birshtein B.K. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 1754-1761PubMed Google Scholar). EL-4 cells are a T lymphoma; the IgH locus is in germline configuration (21Schlissel M.S. Corcoran L.M. Baltimore D. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The mouse erythroleukemia cell line is derived from DBA mice, and the IgH locus is in germline configuration. All cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modification of Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. All cells were grown at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Resting B cells were isolated from spleens of C57BL/6 mice. Total splenocytes were depleted of CD43+-activated B cells and non-B cells by incubation with anti-CD43 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec), washing with cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% fetal bovine serum, and passage through AutoMACS (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The purity of resting B cells, as detected by FACScan (BD Biosciences), was ∼95% B220+. Splenic T cells (∼95% CD3+) were isolated using a pan-T cell isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec). The protocol for these studies was approved by the Animal Institute Committee of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Isolation and Sequence Determination of the VDJ-3′ RR and Cϵ Rearrangement Breakpoints from F5.5—Genomic Southern analysis of F5.5 identified an 8.1-kb BglII fragment that hybridized to both JH and 3′ RR sequences (12Calvo C.-F. Giannini S.L. Martinez N. Birshtein B.K. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 1353-1360PubMed Google Scholar). This fragment was isolated from a Charon 40 phage library prepared from F5.5. A 1.4-kb BamHI/BglII fragment containing the inversion breakpoint was subjected to partial DNA sequence analysis. A 10.1-kb SpeI fragment containing the rearranged Cϵ gene (12Calvo C.-F. Giannini S.L. Martinez N. Birshtein B.K. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 1353-1360PubMed Google Scholar) was cloned into Charon 40 XbaI-digested arms. An 800-bp SacI/KpnI fragment containing the Cϵ rearrangement breakpoint (12Calvo C.-F. Giannini S.L. Martinez N. Birshtein B.K. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 1353-1360PubMed Google Scholar) provided the template for initial DNA sequence analysis. Preliminary sequences obtained from clones of the breakpoints located the DNA segments involved in these rearrangements. Primers designed to analyze genomic sequences at the inversion breakpoints were selected accordingly. The first set of primers (3′ RR/VDJ-forward (F), agactgtgagagtggtgcctt; 3′ RR/VDJ-reverse (R), tttcccctcttatttcccca) amplified a ∼500-bp segment from VDJ to 3′ RR. The second set (VDJ/Cϵm-F2, ctctagatggactaggtc; VDJ/Cϵm-R, tcagagccttcctagagagcc) amplified an ∼800-bp fragment from the VDJ to Cϵ region. The expressed VH gene of F5.5 was sequenced using the primers VDJ/Cϵm-F2 and 3′ RR/VDJ-F as above, found to be identical to that previously shown for MPC11 variants, 9.7.1 (GenBank™ accession number M17056), 9921 (GenBank™ accession number M17058), and 11.9.3 (GenBank™ accession number M17059) (22Gilmore G.L. Yang J.Q. Marcu K.B. Birshtein B.K. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 619-624PubMed Google Scholar) and provided the foundation for identification of the VDJ inversion breakpoints in F5.5. Overall, 10 pmol of each primer, 2 units of HiFi Taq polymerase, and 100 ng of purified F5.5 DNA were used in a standard 50-μl PCR reaction. The PCR reaction was performed using 1.5 min of extension time, 68 °C annealing temperature, and 30-35 cycles in a ThermoHybaid PCR machine. PCR products were examined on a 0.8% agarose gel and purified using the QIA-quick PCR purification kit. DNA was sequenced in the Albert Einstein College of Medicine sequencing facility using the primers used for PCR amplification. Sequences were analyzed via BLAST; Cϵ and 3′ RR sequences were compared with 129Sv germline sequences contained in two BAC clones, i.e. ϵ (GenBank™ accession number AJ851868) and 3′ RR (GenBank™ accession number AF450245), respectively. MPC11 and its variants, like F5.5, derive from BALB/c, which is more similar to 129Sv than to the C57Bl/6 strain selected for the mouse genome project. 3C Assay—Except for minor modifications, the procedure was performed according to the method of Splinter et al. (23Splinter E. Grosveld F. de Laat W. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 375: 493-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Briefly, 107 cells were subjected to formaldehyde cross-linking for 10 min at room temperature with tumbling, after which glycine was added to quench the formaldehyde. Nuclei were prepared, and non-cross-linked protein was removed from chromatin DNA by incubation with SDS. Triton X-100 was added to sequester the SDS, after which samples were digested with 2000 units of HindIII overnight at 37 °C with shaking. The digest was terminated with the addition of SDS and incubation at 65 °C. Digested nuclei (106 nuclei) were then diluted (∼1:15) with 1× T4 DNA ligase buffer to a concentration of ∼3ngof DNA/μl, and SDS was sequestered by Triton X-100. Ligation was promoted by T4 DNA ligase and terminated with the addition of proteinase K, and cross-links were reversed by incubation at 65 °C overnight. Samples were treated with RNaseA, and DNA was purified by phenol:chloroform extraction and isopropanol precipitation. The concentration of dsDNA was determined using picogreen (Molecular probes kit) by the FLUOstar OPTIMA fluorescence reader (BMG Lab Technologies). One hundred ng of ligated DNA samples were analyzed by 32 cycles of PCR (94 °C/30 s, 60 °C/20 s, and 72 °C/30 s) in a 25-μl reaction volume. Analysis of JH3 association with hs1,2 and hs5-7 was determined using 62 °C as the annealing temperature. Taq polymerase was obtained from New England Biolabs. PCR products were separated by 2% agarose gel. Gel pictures were captured by Gene Snap Software and then analyzed by Gene Tools Software (SYNGENE GENE genius BioImaging System). To exclude the biased restriction digestion of one site over another in different cell types, we checked the digestion efficiency of each designated HindIII cleavage site by PCR (27 cycles of 94 °C/30 s, 58 °C/20 s, and 72 °C/30 s) using primers flanking the cut sites (supplemental Table S1) and 100 ng of template DNA extracted from undigested and HindIII-digested nuclei. Restriction digestion efficiencies were calculated by comparing PCR signals from digested and undigested samples and ranged from 66 to 89%, comparable with other studies (16Liu Z. Garrard W.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3220-3231Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 24Majumder P. Gomez J.A. Boss J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18435-18443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The identity of PCR fragments was confirmed by sequence determination. To correct for differences in amplification efficiency between different primer sets, we generated an equimolar mixture of two BACs, namely BAC199M11 (AF450245, containing all the 3′ RR elements: HS3a, HS1,2, HS3b, HS4, and HS5,6,7) and RP109B20 (AC079180, extending from DH segments through to the first exon of γ2a), a plasmid (M11-myc 3′) containing the MPC11 myc translocation breakpoint with switch γ2a sequences (18Stanton L.W. Yang J.Q. Eckhardt L.A. Harris L.J. Birshtein B.K. Marcu K.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 829-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), two calreticulin fragments that contain the selected HindIII restriction sites (Ensembl: ENSMUST 00000003912), and a pGK-NeoR PCR fragment containing a HindIII cleavage site (7Lieberson R. Ong J. Shi X. Eckhardt L.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6229-6238Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The control template, containing all possible ligation products, was then subjected to HindIII digestion followed by random ligation with DNA ligase. Primers for 3C analysis were upstream (forward) of HindIII cleavage sites (supplemental Table S1). Variations in efficiency of cross-linking, restriction digestion, ligation, and amplification in different cell types were normalized via the cross-linking signal derived from two non-adjacent DNA fragments of the calreticulin housekeeping gene (fragments A and B, supplemental Table S1) as used by others (13Tolhuis B. Palstra R.J. Splinter E. Grosveld F. de Laat W. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1453-1465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). Reverse transcription-PCR analysis showed that calreticulin transcription levels were at similar levels in the cell lines we used and, independently, at comparable levels in primary B and T cells. 3C experiments were performed on three independent cell preparations of each source using multiple independent PCR reactions. Means and S.D. were calculated, and Student's t test was conducted to determine the statistical significance of the differences between two samples. Inversion/Deletion in F5.5 Is Indicative of VH-3′ RR Interaction—The results of genomic Southern analysis of F5.5, a murine myeloma cell line derived from MPC11, are consistent with an inversion between the expressed VH gene and the 3′ RR (12Calvo C.-F. Giannini S.L. Martinez N. Birshtein B.K. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 1353-1360PubMed Google Scholar, 20Gilmore G.L. Bard J.A. Birshtein B.K. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 1754-1761PubMed Google Scholar). A likely mechanism to account for this inversion is physical interaction between these distally located segments accompanied by DNA breaks and rejoining (Fig. 1A). Such an interaction would bring the expressed VH gene into contact with distally located 3′ RR sequences that have been predicted to influence its expression. To obtain additional evidence for this model by identifying the sequences at the breakpoints, we compared DNA rearrangements in F5.5 with wild-type genomic sequences of the 3′ RR (GenBank™ accession number AF450245 (25Zhou J. Ashouian N. Delepine M. Matsuda F. Chevillard C. Riblet R. Schildkraut C.L. Birshtein B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13693-13698Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar)). The VDJ-3′ RR inversion breakpoint in F5.5 cells was contained in an 8.1-kb BglII fragment, whereas the predicted reciprocal Cϵ breakpoint was analyzed from a 10.1-kb SpeI fragment. These fragments were initially isolated from phage libraries, confirmed by Southern analysis, subcloned, and then subjected to partial sequence analysis (data not shown). We completed the sequences of the inversion breakpoints on F5.5 genomic DNA using a PCR strategy (Fig. 1A and supplemental Figs. S1A and S1B). Consistent with an inversion model, VDJ sequences located on the 5′ to 3′ non-coding strand were associated with the 5′ to 3′ coding strand of the 3′ RR to generate the VDJ-3′ RR breakpoint (supplemental Fig. S1A). Sequence analysis of the Cϵ rearrangement showed that VDJ 5′ coding sequences were joined through a 50-bp junction of 3′ RR sequences to Cϵ membrane exon 1 sequences, both from the non-coding strand (supplemental Fig. S1A). This implied that in addition to the inversion, there was an internal ∼40-kb deletion that began in Cϵ membrane exon 1 and continued through Cα and enhancers hs3a and hs1,2 of the 3′ RR (Fig. 1B). The 3′ end point of this deletion, marked by a TGGG motif in 3′ RR sequences, was located ∼6 kb downstream of hs1,2. The DNA sequences of the inversion breakpoints provide direct evidence for the reciprocal recombination between expressed VDJ and 3′ RR sequences (Fig. 1C). The VDJ breakpoint occurred immediately after the codon for N14 (numbering from the N terminus of the mature MPC11 H chain, GenBank™ accession number AAA38329), whereas the 3′ RR breakpoint occurred ∼midway between hs1,2 and hs3b enhancers. Sequences at the breakpoints (VDJ: 5′ to 3′ coding strand depicted) match their respective 3′ RR and VH MPC11 counterparts except for a three-base pair insertion (AGA) in the 3′ RR segment immediately upstream of the crossover point. Upstream of the VDJ-3′ RR breakpoint, there is sequence identity (10/12 bases) between germline VH MPC11 and 3′ RR sequences, whereas downstream sequences show little homology. The crossover point itself is within a CCT triplet contained in both VH MPC11 and 3′ RR at the 3′ limit of the region of homology. The VH MPC11 breakpoint, including the CCT, is a palindrome (AGGCCT). The inversion breakpoint is located only 50 bp downstream of the 3′ RR deletion end point. These data imply that the inversion of DNA sequences extending from VH to 3′ RR in F5.5 has occurred through recombination after physical interaction between VH and 3′ RR sequences. 3C Assay—Dynamic interactions between the 3′ RR and its predicted VH target sequence might generate only a transient intervening loop without any detectable downstream DNA rearrangements. To detect these predicted VH-3′ RR interactions, we have implemented the 3C technique (Fig. 2). The MPC11 cell line and several of its variants provide unique resources for analysis of interactions between the 3′ RR elements and their predicted VH gene target sequences. MPC11 has only one JH region and a single intronic enhancer, both of which are located on the single expressed IgH locus (17Eckhardt L.A. Tilley S.A. Lang R.B. Marcu K.B. Birshtein B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3006-3010Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Hence, JH sequences used as a probe or primer source can exclusively track the single IgH expressed allele in MPC11 and its variants. As in other plasmacytomas, the second IgH locus in MPC11 has undergone reciprocal translocation with the myc gene (18Stanton L.W. Yang J.Q. Eckhardt L.A. Harris L.J. Birshtein B.K. Marcu K.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 829-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and the translocated IgH:myc allele has been amplified to three copies (26Yang Q. Riblet R. Schildkraut C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6021-6030Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In the 3C method, formaldehyde is added to live cells to fix DNA-protein interactions that may accompany long-range regulation involving linearly distant chromatin fragments. Restriction digestion of chromatin in fixed nuclei followed by ligation in dilute solution captures these interactions in a covalent form, which provides a template for PCR amplification. HindIII was chosen based on the position of its restriction sites with respect to IgH regulatory elements (Fig. 2A), its enzymatic activity in the presence of SDS, and its being subject to inactivation at 65 °C. Because chromatin limits the accessibility of restriction enzymes to their specific sites (Fig. 2B), we compared the relative efficiency of HindIII cleavage in the cell sources we analyzed. Individual sites were cleaved at comparable levels ranging from 66 to 89% in both EL-4 and MPC11 and in other cells we examined (data not shown) that were similar to levels reported in other studies (16Liu Z. Garrard W.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3220-3231Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Relative primer pair efficiency was measured (Fig. 2C, control template, first lane) using a mixture of naked DNA from BACs and plasmids in equimolar amounts as templates for all possible interactions between these otherwise linearly distant fragments. The mixture was subjected to restriction enzyme cleavage and random DNA ligation. Interactions between restriction fragments in MPC11 cells were not observed unless DNA ligase was added (Fig. 2C). Individual primer pairs showed differences in amplification efficiency that were normalized to the signal generated by interactions between two non-adjacent fragments affiliated with the calreticulin housekeeping gene. As shown by others (13Tolhuis B. Palstra R.J. Splinter E. Grosveld F. de Laat W. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1453-1465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar), we observed that calreticulin was expressed at similar levels in the various cell sources we have analyzed (data not shown). 3C analysis used DNA amounts in the linear range of the assay, as shown for CalR (Fig. 2D) and for VH-hs1,2, VH-hs3b-4,and VH-hs5-7 (supplemental Fig. S2, A-C). The 3C signal obtained from cells was normalized to the endogenous calreticulin signal (Fig. 2E). Interactions between Expressed VH and 3′ RR in MPC11—We specifically wanted to test whether 3′ RR regulators could interact with sequences at the 5′ end of the expression unit, namely the expressed VDJ gene and/or the intronic enhancer, Eμ. The expressed MPC11 VDJH2 gene (Fig. 2A) is located within a 3.7-kb HindIII restriction fragment, which begins upstream of the VH promoter and terminates downstream of JH3, whereas unrearranged germline JH2 and JH3 genes are contained in a 0.8-kb HindIII fragment. A primer for JH3 sequences tracks the expressed VH gene from MPC11 and corresponding JH2 and JH3 germline sequences in non-B cells, such as EL-4. Interactions between VDJ-associated fragments and 3′ RR regulators were substantially stronger in MPC11 than in EL-4 (Fig. 3, A and B). In MPC11, the fragment containing the expressed VDJ gene interacted with 3′ RR regulators, namely, hs3a, hs1,2, hs3b-hs4, and hs5-7, whereas the analogous unrearranged germline fragment from EL-4 T cells (or from mouse erythroleukemia cells, data not shown) showed only low levels of interactions with 3′ RR fragments (Fig. 3B). Other studies have also shown similar background bands in cell sources selected to be biological controls (16Liu Z. Garrard W.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3220-3231Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 27Dekker J. Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Under our experimental conditions, only background interactions were observed between the expressed VDJ gene and “hole” (transmembrane protein 121), the closest neighboring gene 3′ of the IgH locus, located ∼26 kb downstream of hs7 (28Sepulveda M.A. Garrett F.E. Price-Whelan A. Birshtein B.K. Mol. Immunol. 2005; 42: 605-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Hole is not expressed in mature B cells (28Sepulveda M.A. Garrett F.E. Price-Whelan A. Birshtein B.K. Mol. Immunol. 2005; 42: 605-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) or plasma cells. 6Z. Ju, unpublished observations. Furthermore, there were no interactions between JH3 and the CalR gene, which is locate"

TLR4 recognizes lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Gram-negative bacteria and induces a signaling cascade that, when exaggerated, has been associated with severe sepsis. We have generated a TLR4-specific monoclonal antibody, 15C1, which neutralizes LPS-induced TLR4 activation in a dose-dependent manner. 15C1 potently blocks the effects of LPS on a panel of primary cells and cell lines in vitro. The binding of 15C1 was mapped to an epitope in the second portion of the extracellular region of TLR4, which has been shown previously to be functionally important in the recognition of LPS. Furthermore, we demonstrate a novel mechanism of inhibition, as the effects of 15C1 are partially Fc-dependent, involving the regulatory Fcγ receptor IIA (CD32A). In addition to introducing 15C1 as a potent clinical candidate for use in the treatment of LPS-mediated indications, our work demonstrates a newly discovered pathway whose manipulation is pivotal in achieving optimal neutralizing benefit.

In mammals, the innate immune system has evolved to principally distinguish between self and non-self and to sense a large spectrum of invading microbes. Recognition of pathogenic microorganisms evokes a proinflammatory response that is essential for the survival of the host organism and does not necessarily require previous exposure to the pathogen in question. Induction of an effective innate immune response requires recognition of conserved microbial ligands such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), 3The abbreviations used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharide; Mal, MyD88 adaptor-like protein; TRIF, TIR-containing adaptor protein; TRAM, TRIF-related adaptor molecule; iDC, immature dendritic cell; DAP12, DNAX-activating protein 12; TREM, triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells; IL, interleukin; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; WT, wild type; mAb, monoclonal antibody; TLR, Toll-like receptor; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; PtdIns(4,5)P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; cfu, colony-forming units; h, human. lipoproteins, lipoteichoic acids, flagellin, and CpG DNA. These ligands are collectively referred to as pattern-associated molecular patterns (1Janeway Jr., C.A. Medzhitov R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 197-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (6247) Google Scholar). Several receptor types have been shown to participate in the recognition of microbial ligands and are collectively known as pattern recognition receptors. One family that has been the focus of intense research over the past 10 years is the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family, originally identified based on their homology to the Drosophila Toll protein (2Medzhitov R. Preston-Hurlburt P. Janeway Jr., C.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (4458) Google Scholar) and known to play a key role in the recognition of pathogens across a broad range of species. This family contains at least 10 mammalian homologs collectively recognizing a wide range of pattern-associated molecular patterns (3Beutler B. Nature. 2004; 430: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1270) Google Scholar). The TLRs have a common structure characterized by a leucine-rich repeat extracellular region and a cytoplasmic region essential for downstream signaling, which is homologous to the cytoplasmic domain of the human interleukin (IL)-1 receptor. This region is known as the Toll/IL-1R (TIR) domain and is the region sharing homology with Drosophila Toll (2Medzhitov R. Preston-Hurlburt P. Janeway Jr., C.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (4458) Google Scholar, 4Gay N.J. Keith F.J. Nature. 1991; 351: 355-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). TLR4 is arguably the best characterized receptor of the mammalian TLR family and has been shown to recognize the major structural component of the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria, LPS (5Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Van Huffel C. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Layton B. Beutler B.

Chem. 1999; 274: 10689-10692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1626) Google Scholar). Exposure of mammals to LPS as a result of bacterial infection leads to rapid cell activation via TLR4. The signaling pathways known to be involved to date exploit several adaptor proteins, including myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), MyD88 adaptor-like protein (Mal), TIR-containing adaptor protein (TRIF), and TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM) (8Kawai T. Akira S. Semin. Immunol. 2007; 19: 24-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1270) Google Scholar). It appears that the LPS response can be divided into an MyD88/Mal-dependent “early phase” NF-κB activation (characterized by the production of many proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6) and a TRIF/TRAM-dependent phase characterized by “late phase” NF-κB activation and the interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) activation (characterized by the production of interferon-β) (9Palsson-McDermott E.M. O'Neill L.A. Immunology. 2004; 113: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). In certain cases, overactivation of the innate immune system via pattern recognition receptors such as TLR4, resulting in the systemic release of high levels of proinflammatory cytokines, is thought to trigger the majority of symptoms associated with acute inflammatory disorders such as septic shock (10Annane D. Bellissant E. Cavaillon J.M. Lancet. 2005; 365: 63-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar, 11Cohen J.

In order for TLR4 to respond effectively to LPS and initiate signal transduction, contribution from the co-receptors myeloid differentiation protein 2 (MD-2) and CD14 is essential (13Nagai Y. Akashi S. Nagafuku M. Ogata M. Iwakura Y. Akira S. Kitamura T. Kosugi A. Kimoto M. Miyake K. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 667-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar, 14Wright S.D. Ramos R.A.

Med. 1999; 189: 1777-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). TLR4, MD-2, and CD14 are expressed on many immune cells, including monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. Innate immune recognition of LPS is initiated by its interaction with the serum protein LPS-binding protein (16Schumann R.R. Leong S.R. Flaggs G.W. Gray P.W. Wright S.D. Mathison J.C. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1990; 249: 1429-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar), followed by a rapid transfer to membrane-bound or -soluble CD14. This sequence of events is required for LPS recognition by the TLR4-MD-2 complex and signal transduction (17da Silva C.J. Soldau K. Christen U. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol.

MD-2 is a secreted glycoprotein that serves as an extracellular adaptor protein for TLR4 activation and itself is key for ligand recognition by TLR4. MD-2 must be bound to TLR4 on the cell surface for receptor activation to occur. LPS has been shown to directly bind MD-2, subsequently inducing an interaction with the leucine-rich repeats of TLR4 leading to TLR4 aggregation and downstream signal transduction (18Visintin A. Latz E. Monks B.G. Espevik T. Golenbock D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48313-48320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). LPS stimulation of TLR4-MD-2 has been described to induce a micro-domain on the cell surface containing an “activation cluster” comprising several cell surface molecules, including CD14, Fcγ receptors (CD16, CD32, CD64), CD55, CD11b/CD18, CD36, and CD81 (19Pfeiffer A.

In this study we describe the generation of a TLR4 mAb antagonist. The mAb is highly specific for human TLR4 in the presence or absence of MD-2 and potently blocks the effects of LPS stimulation on a variety of isolated cell types and cells in human whole blood. 15C1 was found to bind to a functionally important region of the extracellular region of TLR4 known to be important for LPS recognition and receptor activation. Furthermore, we show that the potency of this mAb is enhanced on cells bearing the regulatory Fcγ receptor CD32A, and we demonstrate a functional contribution of the Fc portion of the mAb. These results suggest a cross-talk between the TLR4 and CD32A signaling pathways. We propose 15C1 as a potent novel inhibitor of TLR4 with potential therapeutic applications in acute inflammatory disorders such as septic shock driven by Gram-negative bacterial infection, and we identify the importance of addressing the role of CD32A to obtain maximal clinical efficacy.

Anti-human TLR4 mAb 15C1 (mouse IgG1 κ) and the anti-human MD-2 mAb 18H10 (mouse IgG2b κ) were generated as described previously (22Pugin J. Stern-Voeffray S. Daubeuf B. Matthay M.A. Elson G. Dunn-Siegrist I. Blood. 2004; 104: 4071-4079Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Isotype controls were purchased from BD Biosciences; anti-human CD32 (AT10) was from Serotec, and anti-human CD32 (IV.3) was from StemCell. All mAbs were tested on human whole blood and found to have no effect on cell viability using TruCOUNT™ (BD Biosciences). Ultrapure Escherichia coli K12LCD25 LPS and Pam3CSK4 were purchased from InvivoGen. The E. coli (wild type) strain was isolated in a 70-year-old male patient who developed sepsis of urinary origin caused by these bacteria (a gift from Dr. P. Rohner, University Hospital of Geneva, Switzerland). This strain was sensitive to all antibiotics tested, except for first generation cephalosporins. Bacteria were heat-inactivated as described previously (23Elson G. Dunn-Siegrist I. Daubeuf B. Pugin J. Blood. 2007; 109: 1574-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were from Dr. F. Mach, University Medical Center, Geneva, Switzerland. The HEK 293, CHO, and Sp2/0 cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). PEAK™ cells were purchased from Edge Biosystems. A stably transfected cell line expressing human TLR4-MD-2 was generated as described previously (22Pugin J. Stern-Voeffray S. Daubeuf B. Matthay M.A. Elson G. Dunn-Siegrist I. Blood. 2004; 104: 4071-4079Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Generation of Immature Dendritic Cells (iDC)—Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated by Ficoll-Paque™ Plus (Amersham Biosciences) using a buffy coat. Monocytes were then passed on MACS Magnetic Microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) using a positive selection with anti-human CD14. Purity of the monocytes was confirmed (over 90%) using a FACSCalibur® flow cytometer on the basis of forward and side scatter. The cells were then cultivated in RPMI 1640 medium, 1 mm pyruvate, 1× nonessential amino acids, 0.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% fetal calf serum, 60 ng/ml granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, 200 ng/ml hIL-4 for 8 days, changing the medium every 2 days. Maturation was monitored by FACS using the CD80/CD86 co-stimulatory molecules as well as CD83 (mAbs purchased from Pharmingen) and anti-human CD14-(R)-phycoerythrin (DAKO). The CD32A phenotype for iDC used in this study was CD80/CD86/CD83hi (in comparison to the level on blood-derived monocytes prior to maturation) and CD14neg and heterozygous for the Arg/His polymorphism at amino acid position 131, as determined by PCR (described below). Generation of Mouse-Human Hybrid TLR4 Mutant—To generate MHHH (i.e. containing mouse (M) TLR4 residues at position 23–291), human (H) TLR4, cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCDNA3.1(–)hygro (Invitrogen), was modified by introducing a novel HpaI site and destroying an existing HpaI site by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange™ kit, Stratagene). The N-terminal region of mouse TLR4 was PCR-amplified and used to replace the corresponding human DNA fragment in the HpaI-mutated human TLR4 vector by cloning at the unique NotI and HpaI restriction sites. HHHM (i.e. containing mouse TLR4 residues at position 487–629) was generated by PCR-amplifying the C-terminal region of mouse TLR4, which was used to replace the corresponding human DNA fragment in the human TLR4 vector by cloning at the unique EcoRV and XhoI restriction sites. MMHH (i.e. containing mouse TLR4 residues at position 23–371) was generated by modifying the MHHH construct (site-directed mutagenesis) to introduce a unique AgeI restriction site into the TLR4 sequence. In parallel, an internal region of mouse TLR4 was PCR-amplified. This mouse DNA fragment replaced the corresponding human DNA fragment in the AgeI-mutated MHHH vector by cloning at the unique HpaI and AgeI restriction sites. Finally to generate MHMH (i.e. containing mouse residues at positions 23–291 and 371–487), an internal region of mouse TLR4 was PCR-amplified and used to replace the corresponding human DNA fragment in the AgeI-mutated MHHH vector by cloning at the unique AgeI and EcoRV restriction sites. To generate MMHHa and MMHHb, PCR fragments were generated where mouse sequences were introduced in the non-hybridizing region of extended oligonucleotides. These fragments were cloned between the unique HpaI/AgeI sites of MHHH. To generate site-specific TLR4 alanine mutants, site-directed mutagenesis with oligonucleotides was performed using the QuikChange™ kit following manufacturer's guidelines (Stratagene). Cloning and Expression of Recombinant Antibody 15C1—Total RNA extraction from the 15C1 hybridoma cell line and cDNA synthesis was performed using standard techniques. The heavy (H) and light (L) chain variable regions coding for 15C1 mAb were determined using the PCR-based method described previously (24Jones S.T. Bendig M.M. Bio/Technology. 1991; 9: 88-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The 15C1 L chain variable region was subcloned into the Lonza GS expression vectors containing the human or mouse κ constant region. The 15C1 H chain variable region was subcloned into the Lonza GS expression vectors containing the human γ-4, mouse γ-1, or mouse D265A γ-1 constant region. The genomic versions of the mouse γ-1 and κ constant regions were obtained directly from 15C1 hybridomas cells by nested PCR. The D265A mouse γ-1 mutant was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange mutagenesis PCR protocol from Stratagene. The full-length 15C1 human IgG4 κ, mouse IgG1 κ, or mouse D265A IgG1 κ antibody was produced by transient transfection of PEAK™ cells. Cells were co-transfected with 0.75 μg of combinations of expression vectors encoding the appropriate full-length L and H chains using FuGENE 6™ transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). Conditioned supernatants were collected 72 h post-transfection, and recombinant antibody was purified by protein G affinity column chromatography (GE Healthcare). Transient Transfection of TLR4 and MD-2 in PEAK™ Cells—Cells were transfected with human or human/mouse hybrid TLR4 and/or human MD-2. PEAK™ cells were co-transfected with 0.75 μg of combinations of expression vectors encoding human TLR4-myc (N-terminal c-Myc tag), mouse MD-2-FLAG™ (C-terminal FLAG tag) human MD-2-FLAG™ (C-terminal FLAG tag) and chimeras of human and mouse TLR4-myc (N-terminal c-Myc tag, generated in house) using the Fugene6™ transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). Cells were analyzed 48 h post-transfection. Flow Cytometry—For HUVEC and iDC, 5 × 105 cells/ml were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 10 μg/ml of the appropriate antibody. Cells were washed and incubated in the same buffer with allophycocyanin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:250 dilution; Molecular Probes). Cells were analyzed using a FACSCalibur® flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) in the FL-4 channel. For iDC, monoclonal mouse anti-human CD14-(R)-phycoerythrin (DAKO) was used, and cells were analyzed in the FL-2 channel. For circulating leukocytes, the appropriate antibodies (10 μg/ml) were added to human whole blood. Following two washes, cells were incubated with secondary antibody (allophycocyanin-conjugated anti-mouse IgG diluted 1:250) containing 100 μg/ml human IgG (Sigma) to prevent Fc-mediated interactions. Red blood cells were lysed, and the remaining cells were washed twice. Cells were analyzed as above. Different leukocyte populations were distinguished on the basis of forward and side light scatter. HEK 293, HUVEC, and iDC Assays—Cells were plated in 96-well plates at 6 × 104 cells/well. HUVEC cells were cultured on gelatin-coated plates (Sigma). The medium was removed on the day of the experiment, and 30 μl of medium containing 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (human serum for HUVEC) was added. mAbs were diluted in 30 μl of basal medium to the appropriate concentration and added to the cells for 1 h at 37 °C. LPS was diluted in 30 μl of medium, added to the cells, and left to incubate for 21 h at 37 °C. IL-6 (iDC) or IL-8 (HEK 293, HUVEC) secretion in the culture supernatant was monitored by ELISA (Endogen). LPS concentrations were as follows: 100 ng/ml for HUVEC, 30 ng/ml for HEK 293 cells, and 2 ng/ml for iDC. Whole Blood Assays—Fresh heparinized blood from healthy volunteers was obtained by venipuncture and diluted 1:2 with RPMI 1640 medium. Blood was plated at 60 μl/well in a 96-well plate and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C, and in some experiments anti-human CD32 (5 μg/ml final) was added in 60 μl of blood for 1 h. mAbs (15C1 or isotype control) were diluted in RPMI 1640 medium (30 μl final volume) and added to the blood. 1 h later, 30 μl of either E. coli K12 LPS (4 ng/ml final), Pam3CSK4 (100 ng/ml final), or heat-inactivated E. coli WT (107 cfu/ml final) was added to the blood and incubated for 6 h (24 h for heat-inactivated E. coli). These concentrations corresponded to the maximal response observed with these agonists. IL-6 levels were measured by ELISA. In some experiments, TNF-α, IL-8, and IP-10 were measured in parallel by ELISA (R & D Systems). All blood samples used in this study were obtained anonymously, and there is no reference to the donors within. Institutional review board approval for informed consent therefore was not required by our institution. Screening of Healthy Individuals for Their CD32A Genotype at the Histidine or Arginine Polymorphism CD32A (Amino Acid 131)—To genotype the FcγRIIa R131H polymorphism, the method was partly obtained from that described by Carlsson et al. (25Carlsson L.E. Santoso S. Baurichter G. Kroll H. Papenberg S. Eichler P. Westerdaal N.A. Kiefel V. van de Winkel J.G. Greinacher A. Blood. 1998; 92: 1526-1531Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, genomic DNA was isolated from sodium citrate-anticoagulated peripheral blood (Vacutainer Systems, BD Biosciences) using QIAamp DNA blood kit (Qiagen). The FcγRIIa-specific PCR amplification was carried out using the HotStar Taq DNA polymerase kit (Qiagen). One hundred and fifty nanograms of genomic DNA was added to 50-μl reaction mixes, containing 1× PCR buffer, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2.75 mm MgCl2, 0.25 mm of each dNTP, 0.4 mm each of P63 (5′-CAA GCC TCT GGT CAA GGT C) and P52 (5′-GAA GAG CTG CCC ATG CTG) primers, and 5 units of HotStar Taq (Qiagen). PCR conditions were as follows: 1 cycle at 95 °C for 15 min, 55 °C for 5 min, and 72 °C for 5 min. This was followed by 35 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min, ending with an extension step at 72 °C for 10 min. To analyze the polymorphic region, PCR products amplified by primers P63 and P52 were purified by GeneElute PCR Clean-Up kit (Sigma) and sequenced directly with a modified version of primer P13 (5′-AGG CTT CCA CCC CAC TCC TC). DNA sequencing was performed by Fasteris S.A. (Plan-lesOuates, Switzerland). All average results are presented as means ± S.D. Two-way analysis of variance computation combined with the Bonferroni test was used to analyze data using Prism version 5 (GraphPad). A probability level of 0.05 was considered significant. Generation of a Panel of Anti-TLR4-MD-2 mAbs—Sera from BALB/c mice immunized with transfected CHO cells overexpressing TLR4-MD-2 were screened by FACS for TLR4-MD-2-specific titers. Positive mice were “hyper-boosted” intravenously with a soluble TLR4-MD-2 fusion protein and isolated splenocytes subjected to PEG-mediated fusion with the SP2/0 myeloma cell line as described previously (22Pugin J. Stern-Voeffray S. Daubeuf B. Matthay M.A. Elson G. Dunn-Siegrist I. Blood. 2004; 104: 4071-4079Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Supernatants from resulting hybridoma clones were screened for TLR4-MD-2 specific mAb binding on mock-transfected or TLR4-MD-2-transfected CHO cells. The HTA125 anti-TLR4 mAb was used as a positive control to confirm specificity. Supernatants from clones showing specific activity were evaluated for their ability to neutralize LPS-mediated IL-8 production in TLR4-MD-2-transfected HEK 293 cells (data not shown). Twelve clones showing neutralizing activity were expanded, and antibody was purified from supernatants by protein G chromatography. Specificity for the TLR4-MD-2 complex was determined using TLR4-MD-2-transfected PEAK™ cells as described previously (22Pugin J. Stern-Voeffray S. Daubeuf B. Matthay M.A. Elson G. Dunn-Siegrist I. Blood. 2004; 104: 4071-4079Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Neutralizing activity of these 12 antibodies was further evaluated in LPS-stimulated human whole blood using IL-6 production as a readout. 7 of the 12 antibodies were found to inhibit LPS in this assay (data not shown). Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the TLR4-/MD-2 mAbs generated in this study.TABLE 1Mouse monoclonal antibodies generated to the human TLR4/MD-2 complexSpecificityNo. of hybridoma clones binding hTLR4-MD-2 CHONo. of hybridoma clones neutralizing hTLR4-MD-2 HEK 293aData are based on an inhibition of greater than 50% of LPS-induced IL-8 production.No. of hybridoma clones neutralizing whole bloodbData are based on an inhibition of greater than 50% of LPS-induced IL-6 production.TLR464MD-210641TLR4-MD-222a Data are based on an inhibition of greater than 50% of LPS-induced IL-8 production.b Data are based on an inhibition of greater than 50% of LPS-induced IL-6 production. Open table in a new tab 15C1 Binds TLR4 on Transfected and Primary Cells in Vitro—We chose to further characterize mAb 15C1 due to its highly potent inhibition of LPS in whole blood. 15C1 produces a mouse IgG1 κ immunoglobulin. 15C1 binds the TLR4-MD-2 complex on transfected CHO cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A) and binds neither the mouse nor rabbit TLR4-MD-2 complexes (data not shown). FACS analysis of transiently transfected PEAK™ cells revealed that like the commercially available TLR4 mAb HTA125, 15C1 binds to TLR4 either in the presence or absence of MD-2 (Fig. 1B). 15C1 also binds to monocytes, granulocytes, iDC, and HUVEC (Fig. 1C). The Epitope for 15C1 Lies in a Functionally Important Region of the TLR4 Extracellular Domain—Human-mouse hybrids were used to determine the region of 15C1 binding to TLR4. As 15C1 does not cross-react with mouse TLR4, expression constructs encoding human-mouse hybrid versions of TLR4 were generated to determine the precise region of human TLR4 containing the epitope recognized by 15C1. The extracellular region of TLR4 was nominally divided into four regions. We then constructed four human-mouse hybrids, MHHH, MMHH, MHMH, and MHHM (Fig. 2A). Each construct was co-transfected into PEAK™ cells along with human MD-2. 15C1 binding was not detected on cells expressing the MMHH construct (Fig. 2B). As cells expressing the MHHH construct were positive for 15C1 binding, we conclude that the epitope is at least partially contained within the 2nd region of human TLR4, corresponding to amino acids 289–375. MHMH was also negative for 15C1 binding. We were unable to draw conclusions from this observation, as MHMH was poorly expressed on the cell surface and was also negative for MD-2 binding, probably suggesting that the hybrid protein was misfolded or conformationally unrepresentative of TLR4. Investigation of the binding of other neutralizing and non-neutralizing mAbs generated in this study using the human-mouse TLR4 hybrids is summarized in Table 2. With one exception, all mAbs showing TLR4-neutralizing activity in human whole blood had epitopes at least partially located in the 2nd region of TLR4 (from the N to the C terminus). All four of a panel of non-neutralizing anti-TLR4 mAbs tested were located in the N-terminal region of TLR4.TABLE 2Epitope localization of anti-TLR4 mAbs on human TLR4 based on binding detected by flow cytometryNo. of hybridoma clones binding to hybrid TLR4 constructsMHHHMMHHMHMHMHHMNeutralizingaData are based on an inhibition of greater than 50% of LPS-induced IL-6 production in human whole blood.0510Non-neutralizing4000a Data are based on an inhibition of greater than 50% of LPS-induced IL-6 production in human whole blood. Open table in a new tab MMHHa and MMHHb were constructed to further define the epitope for 15C1 binding (Fig. 2A). 15C1 bound MMHHa but failed to bind MMHHb, suggesting that the epitope was located in the C-terminal region of the TLR4 fragment spanning amino acids 289–375. To determine amino acids involved in 15C1 binding to TLR4, alanine scanning of this region was performed. The human-mouse alignment for this region is shown in Fig. 2C. Twenty “blocks” of 2–4 amino acids were identified where differences were identified. Wherever complete amino acid mismatches occurred within these blocks, the human amino acid was converted to an alanine by site-directed mutagenesis (for example, block one sequence was converted from LDY to ADA). 15C1 binding to these mutants co-transfected with MD-2 in PEAK™ cells was analyzed by FACS (Fig. 2D). c-Myc binding was determined to assess the expression of these mutants on the cell surface (the TLR4 mutants expressed a c-Myc tag at the N terminus), and 18H10 binding was determined to assess MD-2 binding to the mutants. 15C1 binding is expressed as a ratio between the mean fluorescence intensity of 15C1 and that of c-Myc. 15C1 binding was significantly compromised with mutants 10 (amino acids 328–329), 15 (amino acids 349–351), and 20 (amino acids 369–371), confirming the observed lack of binding with human-mouse hybrid TLR4 mutant MMHHb and suggesting that amino acids located within these blocks are essential for the interaction between 15C1 and human TLR4. 15C1 Potently Inhibits LPS-dependent TLR4 Induction on a Panel of Human Cells—mAb 15C1 was tested at a range of concentrations for inhibition of LPS-induced IL-8 production in TLR4-MD-2 transfected HEK 293 cells along with an irrelevant control mAb and the commercially available anti-human TLR4 mAb HTA 125. In contrast to control mAb and HTA 125, 15C1 showed a dose-dependent inhibition of LPS activity (Fig. 3"

(1990) in Fibronectins, (Rich, A., ed) pp. 1–175, Springer-Verlag, BerlinGoogle Scholar). It is found both in the extracellular matrix and in soluble form in blood plasma. The structure and diverse binding properties of FN have been much studied (2Potts J.R. Campbell I.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 648-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 3Mao Y. Schwarzbauer J.E. Matrix Biol. 2005; 24: 389-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). We have previously described a novel truncated form of FN (70 kDa) that was able to act as a potent migration-stimulating factor (MSF) (4Schor S.L. Schor A.M. Grey A.M. Rushton G. J. Cell Sci. 1988; 90: 391-399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Schor S.L. Ellis I.R. Jones S.J. Baillie R. Seneviratne K. Clausen J. Motegi K. Vojtesek B. Kankova K. Furrie E. Sales M.J. Schor A.M. Kay R.A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 8827-8836PubMed Google Scholar). MSF was originally identified in fetal and cancer patient fibroblasts (4Schor S.L. Schor A.M. Grey A.M. Rushton G. J. Cell Sci. 1988; 90: 391-399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro, exposure of human dermal fibroblasts to MSF provokes a change in phenotype, causing cells to migrate into three-dimensional gels of native type I collagen (5Schor S.L. Ellis I.R. Jones S.J. Baillie R. Seneviratne K. Clausen J. Motegi K. Vojtesek B. Kankova K. Furrie E. Sales M.J. Schor A.M. Kay R.A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 8827-8836PubMed Google Scholar). Fulllength FN is, however, devoid of MSF-like activity, suggesting that cryptic sites are exposed in MSF (5Schor S.L. Ellis I.R. Jones S.J. Baillie R. Seneviratne K. Clausen J. Motegi K. Vojtesek B. Kankova K. Furrie E. Sales M.J. Schor A.M. Kay R.A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 8827-8836PubMed Google Scholar) as well as in certain N-terminal FN fragments (6Schor S.L. Ellis I. Dolman C. Banyard J. Humphries M.J. Mosher D.F. Grey A.M. Mould A.P. Sottile J. Schor A.M. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2581-2590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The N-terminal fragment of FN is composed of independently folded modules, the majority of which are classified as type I (Fn1), each consisting of ∼45 amino acids. Fn1 modules have five short β-strands that form two sheets and a small hydrophobic core; they are further stabilized by two disulfide bonds in a 1–3, 2–4 configuration (7Potts J.R. Campbell I.D. Matrix Biol. 1996; 15: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). These β-strands form two anti-parallel β-sheets that are linked together by a short loop of three amino acids. Four of the nine Fn1 modules contain a highly conserved Ile-Gly-Asp (IGD) sequence (see Fig. 1) within this loop. The motogenic activity of MSF on fibroblasts has been attributed to this loop since mutation of IGD to DGI in modules 7 and 9 abolishes MSF bioactivity (5Schor S.L. Ellis I.R. Jones S.J. Baillie R. Seneviratne K. Clausen J. Motegi K. Vojtesek B. Kankova K. Furrie E. Sales M.J. Schor A.M. Kay R.A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 8827-8836PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, soluble synthetic tri- and tetrapeptides containing the IGD amino acid motif can mimic MSF properties (8Schor S.L. Ellis I. Banyard J. Schor A.M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3879-3888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Like MSF, these peptides stimulate the migration of human dermal fibroblasts into three-dimensional type I collagen gels, although with much reduced potency; half maximal activity is observed with femtomolar and micromolar concentrations for MSF and IGD peptides, respectively (8Schor S.L. Ellis I. Banyard J. Schor A.M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3879-3888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The addition of Ser or Gln C-terminal to the IGD tripeptide was shown to enhance MSF-like activity by a factor of 10 (8Schor S.L. Ellis I. Banyard J. Schor A.M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3879-3888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The demonstration of bioactivity in a tripeptide is reminiscent of several other activation motifs. The Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) cell adhesion motif in the tenth Fn3 module was the first tripeptide to be isolated and has been shown to interact with integrin receptors (9Ruoslahti E. Pierschbacher M.D. Science. 1987; 238: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (3841) Google Scholar, 10Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Frech M. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2002; 296: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar). Synthetic peptides based on Leu-Asp-Val (LDV) and Arg-Glu-Asp-Val (REDV), found in the IIICS alternatively spliced site in FN, can mimic the activity of intact FN at least partially (11Mould A.P. Humphries M.J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4089-4095Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 12Humphries M.J. Akiyama S.K. Komoriya A. Olden K. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2637-2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Although the RGD sequence has been shown to bind integrins and promote cell adhesion and fibril formation, the exact binding partner for the IGD motif is unknown, but its ability to promote cell migration, which is abolished by antibody to αvβ3 (8Schor S.L. Ellis I. Banyard J. Schor A.M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3879-3888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggests a possible interaction with integrins.Full-length fibronectin can form fibrils, and although much is known about promotion of fibrillogenesis by cells, little is known about the precise mechanism. Most models implicate integrin binding via the RGD recognition sequence. A recent report surprisingly showed that the absence of a functional RGD motif in FN did not compromise the assembly of FN fibrils in mutant embryos or cells. A possible explanation suggested was that FN contains a novel integrin binding motif in its N-terminal region (13Takahashi S. Leiss M. Moser M. Ohashi T. Kitao T. Heckmann D. Pfeifer A. Kessler H. Takagi J. Erickson H.P. Fassler R. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The importance of the N-terminal 70-kDa fragment was also emphasized recently when it was shown to initiate FN fibril formation in fibronectin-null mouse fibroblasts (14Tomasini-Johansson B.R. Annis D.S. Mosher D.F. Matrix Biol. 2006; 25: 282-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These reports support the idea that fibrillogenesis might be initiated through integrin cell attachment at the N terminus via a binding site other than the RGD region.Here we set out to explore the structure-function relationships of the IGD sequence in the context of intact Fn1 domains. Of particular interest are the third and fourth IGD motifs in MSF, one in the seventh Fn1 (in this report these modules will be described using a superscript nomenclature: 7Fn1, etc.), and one in 9Fn1. Here we examine the role of the IGD motif by studying the properties of a series of fragments, namely the 8Fn1-9Fn1 and 7Fn1-8Fn1 module pairs, each containing one IGD motif, and the 7Fn1-8Fn1-9Fn1 fragment that contains two IGD motifs. The effects of site-specific mutations on migration and structure are examined using fibroblast migration assays and solution state NMR. Both IGD motifs are shown to have significant migration-stimulating activity while contained within fully folded fibronectin modules.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Production—The human fibronectin modules 8Fn1-9Fn1 (residues 485–577), 7Fn1-8Fn1 (residues 437–528), and 7Fn1-8Fn1-9Fn1 (residues 437–577) were cloned into the Pichia pastoris expression vector pPICZλ. This vector was produced by transplanting the 54-bp EcoRI-XbaI fragment from the multiple cloning site of LITMUS 28i (New England Biolabs) into the corresponding restriction sites of pPICZαA (Invitrogen). All constructs included the conservative mutation R503K in the 8Fn1 module, to avoid cleavage during secretion by the endogenous Pichia protease KEX2 (15Millard C.J. Campbell I.D. Pickford A.R. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 4529-4534Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This single point mutant will be referred to as 8Fn1*-9Fn1. A second conservative point mutation (N497Q) was introduced into the 8Fn1 module to aid purification of the protein fragments, referred to as 8Fn1**-9Fn1, 7Fn1-8Fn1**, and 7Fn1-8Fn1**-9Fn1 (R503K,N497Q). Further point mutations were then introduced in these constructs to disrupt the IGD motifs. The following single mutations were introduced into 8Fn1**-9Fn1 to disrupt the IGD motif in 9Fn1: I541R, I541V, I541A, D543E, D543A, and S544Q. A single mutation, I449R, was introduced in 7Fn1-8Fn1** to disrupt the IGD motif in 7Fn1. The 9Fn1 IGD motif in 7Fn1-8Fn1**-9Fn1 was disrupted with mutation I541R, and both IGD motifs were disrupted using the I449R,I541R double mutant. The nomenclature 8Fn1**-9Fn1 (His) indicates a construct that contained a C-terminal His6 tag. A C-terminal His6 tag was present on all the 7Fn1-8Fn1** and 7Fn1-8Fn1**-9Fn1 constructs.Transformation by electroporation was performed according to standard Pichia protocols (Invitrogen) and expression of unlabeled and uniformly 15N-labeled protein was performed in a 1-liter fermenter (Electrolab Ltd., Tewksbury, UK) in an analogous fashion to that described previously for the 4F1-5F1 module pair (16Bright J.R. Pickford A.R. Potts J.R. Campbell I.D. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 139: 59-69PubMed Google Scholar). The protein was initially passed through a SP-Sepharose cation-exchange chromatography column at pH 3.0 to partially purify and reduce the volume of the secreted protein. High mannose sugars were trimmed back to single N-linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues with Endo Hf at pH 5.5. High performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) on a C4 column with a gradient of 24–38% acetonitrile and 1% trifluoroacetic acid was used to achieve homogeneity. The purity of the protein at each stage was assessed with SDS-PAGE, and the identity and final purity were confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy (ESI-MS).Cells—Collagen gel migration experiments were performed with human skin fibroblasts FSF44. Stock cultures were maintained in Eagle's minimal essential medium (MEM) containing 15% donor calf serum, as previously described (17Schor S.L. J. Cell Sci. 1980; 41: 159-175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Migration Assays—The collagen gel assay was performed in 30-mm plastic culture dishes containing preformed 2 ml of type I collagen gel, as previously described (5Schor S.L. Ellis I.R. Jones S.J. Baillie R. Seneviratne K. Clausen J. Motegi K. Vojtesek B. Kankova K. Furrie E. Sales M.J. Schor A.M. Kay R.A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 8827-8836PubMed Google Scholar). 1 ml of serum-free MEM containing four times the desired final concentration of effector molecule and 1 ml of trypsinized fibroblasts (density 2 × 105 cells/ml) suspended in MEM containing 4% donor calf serum were plated in duplicate onto the collagen gel to give a final volume of 4 ml in 1% donor calf serum. After a 4-day incubation period at 37 °C, cell migration into the three-dimensional gel in response to the effector was determined as previously described (17Schor S.L. J. Cell Sci. 1980; 41: 159-175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In short, this involved using an inverted phase microscope to count the cells on the surface of the gel and then focusing down through the gel to count the cells within the gel. This operation was repeated with 15 randomly selected areas on the gel surface.NMR Spectroscopy—All NMR spectra were recorded at 25 °C using spectrometers built in-house, on samples of 1–2 mm protein in 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm sodium phosphate, 1 mm dioxane, 95% H2O, 5% D2O at pH 6.6. Backbone NH and Hα assignments have been deposited in the BioMagResBank under the accession number 15447 for 8Fn1*-9Fn1 (8Fn1*-9Fn1 (R503K)).RESULTSThe 8Fn1*-9Fn1 (R503K) Protein Is Heterogeneously Glycosylated—Our earlier study concluded that the wild type 8Fn1-9Fn1 was proteolytically cleaved by the P. pastoris endoprotease KEX2 between residues Arg-503 and His-504. The R503K mutation was therefore introduced to alleviate this proteolysis problem (15Millard C.J. Campbell I.D. Pickford A.R. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 4529-4534Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This 8Fn1*-9Fn1 module pair expressed in Pichia was found to be heterogeneously glycosylated at two sites; at least one of the sites was glycosylated and the different fractions could be separated by increasing the retention time on a C4 RP-HPLC column. We previously concluded that glycosylation of Asn-511 was critical for optimal binding to gelatin whereas glycosylation of Asn-497 had no significant effect on binding activity (15Millard C.J. Campbell I.D. Pickford A.R. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 4529-4534Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To increase the yield of homogeneous protein and to simplify the purification procedure, Asn-497 was mutated to remove the “non-essential” glycosylation site.The 7Fn1-8Fn1**, 8Fn1**-9Fn1 and 7Fn1-8Fn1**-9Fn1 Mutants (R503K,N497Q) Are Singly Glycosylated—The mutation N497Q was introduced into all constructs used in this study (with the exception of 8Fn1*-9Fn1, which was used as a control) as it was judged to be a suitable conservative mutation to remove the Asn-497 glycosylation site. Approximately 80 mg/liter of 8Fn1**-9Fn1 was expressed, as judged by SDS-PAGE of crude fermentation supernatant under non-reducing conditions (data not shown). This initial yield was comparable with that of the wild type and single point mutant (R503K) protein but the purification yield was greatly enhanced as the target protein was homogenously glycosylated. SDS-PAGE showed that the molecular mass was reduced from ∼16 to ∼11 kDa after treatment with Endo Hf, indicating the removal of a single high mannose sugar chain. N-terminal sequencing gave a single sequence DQCIVDDIY, and ESI-MS confirmed the expected molecular mass of 11,075 Da, indicating the presence of the complete module pair with a single GlcNAc sugar residue.The 8Fn1**-9Fn1 module pair was analyzed by NMR, both to compare the fold of this protein to that of the 8Fn1*-9Fn1 single point mutant and to study the sugar attachment site. The module pairs were isotopically labeled by replacing the sole nitrogen source in the fermenter vessel with (15NH4)2SO4. Both module pairs were expressed, purified, and characterized by ESI-MS, which gave an increased mass of 131 Da, corresponding to label incorporation of 98.5%. The cross-peaks of the 8Fn1**-9Fn1-GlcNAc511 and 8Fn1*-9Fn1-GlcNAc511 [1H-15N]-HSQC spectra (a single N-linked GlcNAc sugar residue on Asn-511) were shown to overlay as expected, with the exception of mutated residue Asn-497 (data not shown). Direct comparison of the 8Fn1**-9Fn1 spectrum and the 8Fn1*-9Fn1 spectrum allowed assignment of the 8Fn1**-9Fn1 cross-peaks. After this comparison, a C-terminal His tag was engineered onto the 8Fn1**-9Fn1 to aid identification of the module pair by Western blot. This addition did not significantly affect the NMR spectra other than by obvious addition of new peaks from mobile residues.The 8Fn1**-9Fn1 Module Pair Contains Typical Fn1 Folds and the IGD Motif Is Located in a Rigid Loop between Strand B and Strand C—The solution structures of several Fn1-type module pairs have already been calculated by NMR (18Potts J.R. Bright J.R. Bolton D. Pickford A.R. Campbell I.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8304-8312Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 19Rudino-Pinera E. Ravelli R.B. Sheldrick G.M. Nanao M.H. Korostelev V.V. Werner J.M. Schwarz-Linek U. Potts J.R. Garman E.F. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 368: 833-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The secondary structure of the 8Fn1**-9Fn1 was mapped here using inter-strand NOEs. Both modules were found to have a typical type I module fold (Fig. 2A), and the observed hydrogen bonding pattern agrees well with existing structures. The position of the IGD motif in the 9Fn1 can be mapped to a tight turn between the B strand and the C strand, and a model based on the structure of the 2Fn1-3Fn1 pair confirms that the loop is accessible to the solvent (Fig. 2B). The heteronuclear {1H-}15N NOE was used to map the internal motion of residues on a subnanosecond time scale, showing the module pair to be relatively rigid, especially in the short linker between modules and in the IGD loop of the 9Fn1 (Fig. 2C). Those values lower than 0.65 indicate regions with fast internal mobility, the majority falling within the loop regions of the protein.FIGURE 2NMR structural analysis. A, secondary structure of 8Fn1**-9Fn1 module pair. Each module adopts a typical Fn1-type fold, with a two-stranded antiparallel β-sheet folded over a three-stranded β-sheet. Interstrand NOEs between protons are indicated by bold lines within the β-sheets. The three-dimensional NOESY strips (inset) show the interstrand NH-Hα and NH-NH NOEs between four of the residues in the 8F1 module. The position of the IGD loop is highlighted, and the mutated residues N497Q and R503K are starred. B, a three-dimensional model of the 8Fn1**-9Fn1 module pair based on the secondary structure data in Fig. 1 and the x-ray structure of the 2Fn1-3Fn1 module pair (19Rudino-Pinera E. Ravelli R.B. Sheldrick G.M. Nanao M.H. Korostelev V.V. Werner J.M. Schwarz-Linek U. Potts J.R. Garman E.F. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 368: 833-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A short linker joins the two modules, and the IGD motif falls with a tightly constrained loop in the 9F1. The side chains of the tightly constrained IGD loop are highlighted (pyMOL). C, heteronuclear {1H-}15N NOE of 8Fn1*-9Fn1. The horizontal line indicates the module boundary, and the boxed area indicates the position of the IGD motif. The secondary structure is indicated in schematic form. The DE loop of the 9Fn1 remains unassigned due to intermediate exchange of the residues on the NMR time scale.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Expression, Purification, and Characterization of 8Fn1**-9Fn1 IGD Mutants—Conservative and non-conservative point mutations were introduced into 8Fn1**-9Fn1 to interrupt the IGD site in the 9Fn1 module. These constructs were labeled, expressed, and purified; their fold was examined by comparing each HSQC spectrum with that of the unmodified 8Fn1**-9Fn1 module pair. All seven mutants were equally soluble and were folded in the same way as shown by the limited 1HN and 15N chemical shift differences from the “wild-type” 8Fn1**-9Fn1 (supplemental Figs. S1 and S2). As expected, there were minor shifts of peaks from residues in the IGD and of residue Ser-544 which immediately follows. Other observed localized shifts were in the cross-strand residue Cys-530 (in strand A of 9F1) and Cys-558 (in strand D of 9F1); these side chains are predicted by structural homology models to point toward the IGD loop (data not shown). Apart from these minor local perturbations around the mutated residue, there was no evidence for a change in the overall fold.An Intact IGD Motif Is Required in 8Fn1**-9Fn1 for Stimulation of Fibroblast Migration—The effect of each module pair on the behavior of fibroblast cells was assessed in a collagen gel migration assay. Increasing concentrations of the module pairs were added to cells plated on the surface of three-dimensional gels of native type I collagen fibers. In a similar manner to that of MSF and IGD peptides (8Schor S.L. Ellis I. Banyard J. Schor A.M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3879-3888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 8Fn1**-9Fn1 with an intact IGD motif stimulated fibroblast migration into this matrix, in a bell-shaped dose-response fashion. Maximal bioactivity was expressed at concentrations of 100 pmol (Fig. 3A). As predicted from peptide studies (8Schor S.L. Ellis I. Banyard J. Schor A.M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3879-3888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the module pairs with a mutation at Ile-541 (VGD, AGD, RGD) did not affect cell migration (Fig. 3A). The DGI mutant was also unable to stimulate migration (Fig. 3B). In contrast, those module pairs carrying a mutation at Asp-543 (IGE and IGA) showed some bioactivity, but this was significantly reduced with respect to the intact IGD at the same protein concentrations (Fig. 3B). It has also been suggested that the fourth amino acid in the IGD loop could affect migration (8Schor S.L. Ellis I. Banyard J. Schor A.M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3879-3888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The amino acid immediately following the IGD was also mutated from Ser to Gln in 8Fn1**-9Fn1 but did not change the extent of cell migration (Fig. 3B).FIGURE 3The effects of 8Fn1**-9Fn1 module pairs on cell migration. Fibroblasts were plated on native collagen gels in the presence of intact IGD and mutant test proteins at the concentrations indicated. After a 4-day incubation period, the cells present on the surface and within the three-dimensional collagen matrix were counted. The percentage of cells that migrated into the gel is expressed relative to the control cultures. For clarity, the error bars are omitted for those results that fall within the error of the control, but are indicated by the shaded area.

The lower yield of the module triple is presumably due to some misfolding, and therefore degradation, of this larger recombinant fragment. The identity of the proteins was confirmed by N-terminal sequencing and ESI-MS (expected molecular masses of 12,061 and 18,393 Da). The recombinant material was isotopically labeled with 15N and examined by NMR. The dispersion of cross-peaks in [1H-15N]-HSQC spectra was indicative of a fully folded protein.Following the results from the 8Fn1**-9Fn1 mutations the relative roles of the IGD motifs in 7F1 and 9F1 were explored by replacing IGD with RGD in 7Fn1-8Fn1** and 7Fn1-8Fn1**-9Fn1. The proteins were successfully expressed, purified to homogeneity, and characterized by Western blotting and ESI-MS. The two IGD motifs in 7Fn1-8Fn1**-9Fn1 were mutated in turn by introducing single point mutations I449R and I541R before introducing both mutations to create a double mutant. The structure of the mutants, before and after the Ile to Arg mutation, was judged not to have changed significantly by comparing resolved up-field methyl peaks in one-dimensional NMR spectra (data not shown).The IGD Motifs in 7F1 and 9F1 Can Stimulate Fibroblast Migration Independently—The 7Fn1-8Fn1** with the intact IGD stimulated fibroblast migration at the same concentration as the 8Fn1**-9Fn1 (Fig. 4). The 7Fn1-8Fn1**-9Fn1 with both IGD motifs stimulated fibroblast migration with a factor of 100 higher potency with maximal activity at 1 pmol/IGD. Mutation of the 7Fn1 IGD motif in 7Fn1-8Fn1** caused significant loss of bioactivity. Independent mutation of the seventh and the ninth IGD motifs in 7Fn1-8Fn1**-9Fn1 reduced the maximal bioactivity to the level of the 7Fn1-8Fn1**, but the activity was absent in the double mutant (Fig. 3B).FIGURE 4Fibroblast migration into collagen gels. The response to different constructs is shown, 7Fn1-8Fn1** and 7Fn1-8Fn1**-9Fn1.

Ellis I. Banyard J. Schor A.M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3879-3888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to that of IGD motifs in the context of folded Fn1-type modules. Various Fn1 module fragments, including several IGD mutants, were produced in P. pastoris, and their ability to stimulate fibroblast migration was assessed in a collagen gel migration assay. All of the proteins produced had a similar fold, as judged by NMR. A 10,000-fold increase in potency was observed in moving from peptides to recombinant module pairs.The conservative I541V mutation was designed to mimic the VGD of the first Fn1-type module; it was unable to promote cell migration in the context of 8Fn1**-9Fn1. The I541R mutation was designed to introduce an RGD sequence, a motif that promotes cell adhesion when in other regions of fibronectin, e.g. 10Fn3 (9Ruoslahti E. Pierschbacher M.D. Science. 1987; 238: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (3841) Google Scholar). This mutation did not, however, promote cell migration here; neither did I541A. These results suggest that the isoleucine is critical for the observed bioactivity.The bioactivity of 7Fn1-8Fn1** is very similar to that of 8Fn1**-9Fn1 (Figs. 3A and 4). Substitution of I449R in the 7Fn1-8Fn1** module pair also resulted in a protein devoid of migration-stimulating activity.About half the bioactivity remained in the protein with the conservative D543E mutation. Some activity also remained for the D543A mutation but it was significantly lower than the wild type 8Fn1**-9Fn1. These results suggest that the aspartate residue in the IGD is required for optimal bioactivity but is less critical than the isoleucine. The “reverse” mutant DGI was also devoid of motogenic activity.It has been suggested that the IGDS of 9Fn1 is more active than the IGDQ in 7Fn1 (8Schor S.L. Ellis I. Banyard J. Schor A.M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3879-3888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the mutation S544Q did not change the bioactivity of the protein. This finding suggests that the fourth amino acid is less important in the context of the 8Fn1**-9Fn1 module pair than in the unconstrained peptide form.The increased potency of the protein in comparison to the peptide is remarkable. Constraining the ends of the IGD motif in the 9Fn1 module may favor the orientation of ligand binding that accounts for migration stimulation at much lower concentrations. A cyclic IGD peptide containing 20 amino acids from around the IGD site is also more potent than a similar length unconstrained IGD peptide (data not shown). Cyclic RGD peptides can inhibit cell attachment at a 20-fold lower concentration than linear peptides (20Kumagai H. Tajima M. Ueno"

https://openalex.org/W2043295759,"Some transactivator-promoter complexes are highly dynamic due to active disruption of the complex by proteolytic or nonproteolytic mechanisms, and this appears to be an important mechanism by which their activity is governed tightly and eventually terminated. However, the generality of these mechanisms is unclear. In this report, we address the dynamics of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) binding to the vascular endothelial growth factor promoter. HIF-1 is a heterodimeric transcription factor whose activity is triggered by an increase in HIF-1alpha levels in hypoxic cells. A competition ChIP assay is employed to demonstrate that HIF-1alpha forms a kinetically stable complex with the native vascular endothelial growth factor promoter that has a half-life in excess of 1 h. Thus, HIF-1 activity does not require rapid proteolytic turnover of the promoter-bound transactivator, nor is the activator-promoter complex constantly disassembled by chaperones. However, we do find that after cessation of the inducing signal, HIF-1 activity is slowly returned to basal levels by proteasome-mediated proteolysis of the promoter-bound HIF-1alpha protein."
https://openalex.org/W1983331441,"Human complement factor B is the crucial catalytic component of the C3 convertase enzyme that activates the alternative pathway of complement-mediated immunity. Although a serine protease in its own right, factor B circulates in human serum as an inactive zymogen and there is a crystal structure only for the inactive state of factor B and various fragments. To provide greater insight to the catalytic function and properties of factor B, we have used short para-nitroanilide derivatives of 4- to 15-residue peptides as substrates to profile the catalytic properties of factor B. Among factors found to influence catalytic activity of factor B was an unusual dependence on pH. Non-physiological alkaline conditions strongly promoted substrate cleavage by factor B, consistent with a pH-accessible conformation of the enzyme that may be critical for catalytic function. Small N-terminal extensions to conventional hexapeptide para-nitroanilide substrates significantly increased catalytic activity of factor B, which was more selective for its cleavage site than trypsin. The new chromogenic assay enabled optimization of catalysis conditions, the profiling of different substrate sequences, and the development of the first reversible and competitive substrate-based inhibitor of factor B. The inhibitor was also shown to prevent in vitro formation of C3a from C3 by factor B, by synthetic and by natural C3 convertase of the alternative complement activation pathway, and to block formation of membrane attack complex. The availability of a reversible substrate-based inhibitor that could stabilize the active conformation of factor B, in conjunction with a pH-promoted higher processing activity, may offer a new avenue to obtain crystal structures of factor B and C3 convertase in an active conformation.

Following binding to C3b, factor B is recognized and hydrolyzed between its CCP and vWFA domains by factor D, leading to formation of the heterodimer complex C3bBb, the C3 convertase of the complement alternative pathway. Recent crystal structures of the serine protease domain (3Jing H. Xu Y.Y. Carson M. Moore D. Macon K.J. Volanakis J.E. Narayana S.V.L.

Biol. 2007; 14: 224-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) have revealed that factor B adopts a chymotrypsin-like fold with several novel structural motifs. The catalytic triad residues Asp551, His501, and Ser674 were in a typical active conformation found in serine proteases; however, residues that normally define the oxyanion hole produced an unusual conformation because of the inward orientation of the carbonyl group of Arg671 hydrogen-bonded to the NH group of Ser674 to form a 310 helix. This abnormal conformation is believed to be responsible for the zymogen property of factor B under physiological conditions. The vWFA domain contains an integrin-like MIDAS (metal ion-dependent adhesion site) motif that may serve as a binding site for C3b, consistent with the requirement for Mg2+ to form C3bBb from C3 and factor B. In its native state, factor B has negligible proteolytic activity on its native substrate protein C3 at physiological pH. When factor B is bound to C3b and processed by factor D (Fig. 2), the resulting C3bBb is an efficient and specific serine protease that cleaves C3 (Km 5.9 μm, kcat 1.78 s–1) (7Pangburn M.K. Mullereberhard H.J. Biochem. J. 1986; 235: 723-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). However, upon irreversible dissociation, the catalytic domain Bb retains only diminished (1%) proteolytic activity (8Fishelson Z. Muller-Eberhard H.J. J. Immunol. 1984; 132: 1425-1429PubMed Google Scholar). Despite having an inactive zymogen-like oxyanion conformation, factor B still exhibits some esterolytic activity against thiobenzyl ester substrates, including dipeptide analogue Cbz-KR-SBzl, for which the highest catalytic efficiency has been reported (kcat/Km 1370 m–1 s–1) (9Kam C.M. McRae B.J. Harper J.W. Niemann M.A. Volanakis J.E. Powers J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3444-3451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under the same conditions, the isolated Bb domain displayed slightly improved catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km 2320 m–1s–1) due mainly to a lower Km (0.58 versus 1.19 mm). Neither a factor B-specific assay nor any other substrates have been reported to date. Recently, our understanding about the precise role of factor B in the alternative pathway has expanded through the availability of gene-depleted mice and monoclonal antibodies (10Mollnes T.E. Kirschfink M. Mol. Immunol. 2006; 43: 107-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 11Thurman J.M. Holers V.M. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 1305-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). There is now growing evidence for an essential role of factor B in activating the alternative complement pathway in models of numerous inflammatory diseases (10Mollnes T.E. Kirschfink M. Mol.

Studies using wild type, factor B-deficient, or C4-deficient mice in conjunction with specific anti-factor B monoclonal antibodies have demonstrated that factor B is critical for allergen-induced development of airway hyper-responsiveness and inflammation (11Thurman J.M.

As an indispensable component of the alternative pathway, factor B has also been implicated in inflammatory disorders of renal tissue injury (11Thurman J.M. Holers V.M. J.

A functionally intact alternative, but not classical, complement pathway was demonstrated to be crucial in renal ischemia-reperfusion injury, whereas both pathways are required for development of intestinal ischemia/reperfusion tissue damage (11Thurman J.M.

The alternative pathway also proved to be important in kidney inflammation such as lupus nephritis and type II membranoproliferative glomerulo-nephritis (11Thurman J.M. Holers V.M. J.

When factor B was neutralized with a specific monoclonal antibody, mice were significantly protected from complement activation and fetal loss stimulated by antiphospholipid antibody (11Thurman J.M.

Human complement receptor of the immunoglobulin superfamily (CRIg), a factor B-specific inhibitor, also reversed inflammation and bone loss in two mouse models of arthritis (27Katschke K.J.

Med. 2007; 204: 1319-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To date, no specific small molecule inhibitors of factor B have been described, and only a few moderately active and non-selective inhibitors of C3/C5 convertase are known, such as FUT175 (IC50, 4 μm) (28Inagi R. Miyata T. Maeda K. Sugiyama S. Miyama A. Nakashima I. Immunol. Lett. 1991; 27: 49-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and the allosteric inhibitor compstatin (IC50, 12 μm) (29Sahu A. Kay B.K. Lambris J.D. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 884-891PubMed Google Scholar). The former compound (nafamostat) is in clinical use in Japan to treat acute pancreatitis and glomerulo-nephritis, but it also inhibits a wide range of targets, including many human serine proteases (30Leung D. Abbenante G. Fairlie D.P. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 305-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar, 31Abbenante G. Fairlie D.P. Med. Chem. 2005; 1: 71-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). A major problem in developing inhibitors of C3 convertase has been the difficulty in readily measuring C3 convertase activity. Additionally, substrate-based analogues have so far failed to inhibit processing of C3 by C3 convertase (30Leung D. Abbenante G. Fairlie D.P. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 305-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar, 31Abbenante G. Fairlie D.P. Med. Chem. 2005; 1: 71-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 32Furlong S.T. Dutta A.S.

The availability of small molecule inhibitors of factor B and C3 convertase could be valuable for probing physiological and patho-physiological roles of factor B in vivo and for evaluating these enzymes as possible therapeutic targets for new complement-based drugs. Here we report the development of a valuable new rapid chromogenic assay for measuring factor B activity in vitro, the discovery of some important and unexpected molecular and catalytic properties of factor B for substrate processing, and the discovery of the first substrate-based inhibitor of factor B that also inhibits C3 convertase. These results provide a valuable beginning to better understanding the activity of factor B and C3 convertase, to a more robust method of screening potential inhibitors, and to the rational development of potent and selective inhibitors of C3 cleavage resulting from complement activation. Materials—Factor B, factor D, C3, and cobra venom factor were obtained from Calbiochem, or Quidel. Protein molecular weight markers for gels were purchased from Sigma. Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl)-protected amino acids were from Novabiochem. Gel ingredients, casting apparatus, and resolving chamber (Mini-PROTEAN Tetra Cell™) were from Bio-Rad. Proteins were visualized using colloidal Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining solution. All other chemical reagents were analytical grade from Sigma. Para-nitroanilide (pNA) Substrate Synthesis—pNA substrates were synthesized according to the general method of Abbenante et al. (33Abbenante G. Leung D. Bond T. Fairlie D.P. Lett. Pept. Sci. 2000; 7: 347-351Google Scholar) and characterized by analytical high performance liquid chromatography and mass and NMR spectroscopy (see supplemental material). Enzymatic Characterization and Substrate Analysis—Factor B was assayed against short peptide substrates corresponding to the relevant cleavage site in the endogenous substrate C3 but with a chromogenic pNA group in the P1′-position at the C terminus. Cleavage of pNA from the peptides by factor B produces a yellow color that enables continuous monitoring of absorbance changes at the wavelength 405 nm. The assay was conducted in a 96-well plate, with a final reaction volume of 150 μl containing factor B at concentrations of 25, 50, or 75 nm using semi-optimized conditions (100 mm glycine-HCl buffer, pH 9.5, 154 mm NaCl, 1% Me2SO). Eight different substrate concentrations, each in duplicate, were used for determining kinetic constants. After preincubation in separate wells (5 min, 37 °C), catalysis was initiated by mixing substrate with enzyme buffer solution with automatic shaking for 5 s. The optical density was measured at 405 nm every 30–60 s for 30 to 120 min (depending on activity) in a Fluostar Optima (BMG Labtech) reader, and the average change in millioptical density/min was calculated. Kinetic parameters were calculated from weighted nonlinear regression of the initial velocities as a function of the eight substrate concentrations using GraphPad Prism 4 □ software. The parameters kcat, Km, and kcat/Km were calculated assuming Michaelis-Menten equilibrium kinetics, v = Vmax[S]/ ([S] + Km). Duplicate measurements were taken for each data point, and means ± S.E. are reported. Factor B Cleaves C3 at Alkaline pH—Factor B circulates in serum intact and is known to be inactive against its native substrate C3 at pH 7.4. We now report that factor B alone does in fact cleave C3 fairly rapidly but only at higher pH (pH > 9) and with moderate efficiency. For example, Fig. 3 shows a mini-gel analysis indicating that incubating factor B with C3 in buffers of varying pH > 8 at 37 °C for 3 h results in formation of a protein corresponding to C3a (lane 3), verified by a commercial sample ([M+H]+ 9084 Da). A band for factor B at 97 kDa remains intact at all pH values examined (lanes 4–7), but in the presence of C3 another band at ∼100 kDa is also produced at pH 9.3 and 10.2 (lanes 5–7), corresponding to the cleavage product of the α chain of C3. These new protein bands are identical to those obtained (Fig. 3) from cleavage (pH 7.4, 37 °C) of C3 by C3 convertase (lane 8) generated by mixing cobra venom factor, factor B, and factor D (32Furlong S.T. Dutta A.S. Coath M.M. Gormley J.J. Hubbs S.J. Lloyd D. Mauger R.C. Strimpler A.M. Sylvester M.A. Scott C.W. Edwards P.D. Immunopharmacology. 2000; 48: 199-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The C3 samples used (>98%) (Calbiochem) have an apparent molecular mass of 180 kDa, appearing on SDS-PAGE gels as a single band or two bands under non-reducing or reducing conditions, respectively. The ability of factor B to process C3 at alkaline pH is independent of the concentrations of Na+, Mg2+, or the metal ion scavenger EDTA (supplemental Fig. S2, a and b). Because these results indicated that hydrolytic activity of factor B proportionally increased with pH, we also examined the ability of factor B alone to hydrolyze synthetic peptides of varying length, corresponding to the native cleavage sequence in C3, at pH 7.4 or 9.5. We found that factor B hydrolyzed the 15-residue synthetic peptide substrate AcQHARASHLGLAR↓SNL-NH2, corresponding to the native sequence at the cleavage site in C3, significantly faster at pH 9.5 than at pH 7.4. The enzyme only recognized the native cleavage site LAR↓SNL with no hydrolysis detected at the non-native Ac-QHAR↓AS site. By contrast, trypsin cleaved the same peptide at both sites (data not shown). Similar observations were made for the corresponding but shorter 10-residue peptide Ac-ARASHLGLAR-pNA (1), in which the prime side tripeptide component was replaced by the chromogenic para-nitroaniline (Fig. 4). At pH 9.5, factor B only catalyzed hydrolysis at the native cleavage site LAR↓pNA, with negligible hydrolysis detected even after 24 h at the non-native Ac-AR↓ASH site. Trypsin cleaved the same peptide at both sites at pH 8 (Fig. 4). Development of a Chromogenic Assay for Factor B—Toward the development of a rapid chromogenic assay for monitoring factor B activity in vitro, a library of systematically shortened pNA substrates was prepared to examine effects of peptide sequence and length. For comparison, we also included Cbz-KR-pNA, which has the non-prime site identical to that of the best reported thiobenzyl ester substrate (9Kam C.M. McRae B.J. Harper J.W. Niemann M.A. Volanakis J.E. Powers J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3444-3451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preliminary results indicated that octapeptide Ac-ASHLGLAR-pNA (3) was one of the best substrates, so we used it to optimize the conditions of the chromogenic assay described below. Effect of pH on Enzymatic Activity—The catalytic activity of factor B against octapeptide Ac-ASHLGLAR-pNA (3) was investigated over a wide pH range, using a variety of buffers (Tris-HCl, pH 7.5–8.50; glycine-HCl, pH 9.00–10.50; piperidine-HCl, pH 10.75–11.5). The optimal pH for most rapid processing of this substrate by factor B was ∼10.5 (Fig. 5). Auto-hydrolysis of this substrate was negligible at or below pH 11.5 in the absence of factor B, but the catalytic activity decreased abruptly above pH 10.5, presumably due to denaturation of factor B. The effect of pH on the catalytic activity of factor B was independent of Na+ (154 mm NaCl, Fig. 5; 0 mm NaCl, supplemental Fig. S3). Effect of Divalent Cations, Ion Strength, and Other Additives—Effects of diluents were probed at pH 9.5. Although the vWFA domain of factor B contains an integrin-like MIDAS (metal ion-dependent adhesion site) motif that could bind divalent cations, neither calcium (10 mm), magnesium (10 mm), nor the divalent cation-sequestering agent EDTA (10 mm) detectably influenced the activity of factor B in vitro. Similarly, neither variation of ionic strength (NaCl 0–250 mm) nor addition of bovine serum albumin (1%), polyethylene glycol (1%), or glycerol (10%) had any effect on the substrate-processing ability of factor B. Under the semi-optimal conditions (pH 9.5, 100 mm glycine-HCl buffer, 154 mm NaCl), we found that factor B exhibited classic Michaelis-Menten kinetics against the pNA substrate 3, with kcat 10.19 ± 0.19 s–1, Km 2.19 ± 0.08 mm, and kcat/Km 4666 ± 253 m–1s–1 (Fig. 6). Effects of Substrate Length—A number of pNA peptide substrates were synthesized, ranging from 4 to 10 amino acids corresponding to the native cleavage sequence of C3. Because Cbz-KR-SBzl has been reported to be the best thioester substrate for factor B (9Kam C.M. McRae B.J. Harper J.W. Niemann M.A. Volanakis J.E. Powers J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3444-3451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), its corresponding pNA analogue, Cbz-KR-pNA, was also prepared for comparison. Among eight putative substrates examined (Fig. 7), the 8- and 7-residue pNA peptides (3 and 4) proved to be the best substrates, with initial velocity of 0.17–0.19 μm □s–1 (50 nm factor B, pH 9.5, (substrate) = 1 mm). The Cbz-KR-pNA substrate displayed >10-fold lower initial velocity under identical conditions. Km and kcat values for selected substrates are recorded in Table 1. Heptapeptide substrate 4 (Km 8.4 mm, kcat 1 s–1, kcat/Km 8315) was processed most efficiently by factor B. When this substrate was examined using factor B obtained from a different supplier (Quidel), comparable catalytic efficiency was observed (Km 1.15 ± 0.21 mm, kcat 9.1 ± 0.6 s–1, kcat/Km 8258 ± 2070 m–1s–1).TABLE 1Kinetic parameters for pNA peptide substratesSubstratekcatKmkcat/Kms−1mmAc-ARASHLGLAR-pNA (1)12.6aValues estimated from a single experiment at substrate concentrations of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, 1.6, 2.0, 3.0 mm.12.4aValues estimated from a single experiment at substrate concentrations of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, 1.6, 2.0, 3.0 mm.1016aValues estimated from a single experiment at substrate concentrations of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, 1.6, 2.0, 3.0 mm.Ac-RASHLGLAR-pNA (2)12.8aValues estimated from a single experiment at substrate concentrations of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, 1.6, 2.0, 3.0 mm.15.8aValues estimated from a single experiment at substrate concentrations of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, 1.6, 2.0, 3.0 mm.810aValues estimated from a single experiment at substrate concentrations of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, 1.6, 2.0, 3.0 mm.Ac-ASHLGLAR-pNA (3)10.19 ± 0.192.19 ± 0.084666 ± 253Ac-SHLGLAR-pNA (4)8.38 ± 1.41.05 ± 0.148315 ± 2458Ac-AHLGLAR-pNA (5)8.20 ± 0.022.84 ± 0.052884 ± 54Ac-KHLGLAR-pNA (6)8.25 ± 0.222.79 ± 0.53045 ± 467a Values estimated from a single experiment at substrate concentrations of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, 1.6, 2.0, 3.0 mm. Open table in a new tab Effect of the 7th Residue in Substrates—The 7th residue serine in the heptapeptide substrate Ac-SHLGLAR-pNA (4) was varied to probe substrate requirements at this position. Large hydrophobic or negatively charged side chains at this position significantly decreased hydrolysis by factor B (Fig. 8). Of the small number of heptapeptide substrates investigated (Fig. 8), compound 4 with Ser at position 7 proved to be the best. A serine mimetic, isoxazole-5-carbonyl, was poorly tolerated, while small side chains (Ala) or positively charged moieties (Lys, Dapa (diaminopropionic acid)) caused small decreases in initial velocities (Fig. 8). Substrate-based Inhibitor of Factor B and C3 Convertase—To convert substrate 4 to a putative inhibitor, the pNA moiety was replaced by an aldehyde group to furnish compound 7 (AcSHLGLAR-H). This compound proved to be a moderately potent inhibitor of factor B (IC50 19 μm, Fig. 9), blocking the cleavage of C3 in a concentration-dependent manner under the same assay conditions (Fig. 11, supplemental Fig. S4, a and b). In this inhibitor, the aldehyde functional group is capable of forming a reversible covalent bond with the catalytic Ser side chain, resulting in a tetrahedral configuration that mimics the transition state.FIGURE 11Compound 7 inhibits cleavage of C3 by factor B in a concentration-dependent manner.

Cleavage of the native substrate C3 to C3a and C3b by factor B at pH 10.2 was also inhibited by aldehyde 7 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 11). Because factor B also provides the crucial catalytic unit within C3 convertase of the alternative pathway, compound 7 was also examined for inhibition of C3 convertase. Cleavage of C3 by C3 convertase generated either from a combination of cobra venom factor, factor B, and factor D (CVF.Bb; Fig. 12 and supplemental Fig. S5, a and b) or from human C3, factor B, and factor D (hC3bBb, supplemental Fig. 6, a and b) in the presence of Mg2+ was indeed inhibited by aldehyde 7 in a dose-dependent manner. Under the same conditions, general serine protease inhibitors leupeptin or phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 1-mm concentrations did not inhibit C3 cleavage (supplemental Fig. S6, a and b).FIGURE 12Compound 7 inhibits cleavage of C3 by C3 convertase (CVF.Bb) in a concentration-dependent manner. a, top region of 7% gel, loading of 2.5 μg of C3/well. b, bottom region of 12% gel, loading of 5.0 μg of C3/well.

Patterning the nervous system presents a problem of enormous complexity. In humans, the nervous system is composed of roughly ten billion neurons, each of which can potentially participate in thousands of connections. The formation of functional neural circuits is thought to depend on a limited repertoire of guidance cues and intercellular adhesion molecules with distinct specificities. How such limited repertoires of genes can encode sufficient information to direct such complex patterning is one of the most puzzling questions in developmental neuroscience. One explanation for this paradox of mismatched complexities may arise from diversification of neural guidance genes through alternative splicing, a mechanism by which some specialized single genes can produce large numbers of mature proteins of different sequence. Recent advances in understanding the Dscam cell-adhesion proteins of Drosophila now begin to shed light on both structural and functional aspects of their molecular diversification, revealing how alternatively spliced Dscams achieve astonishingly diverse recognition properties. Dscams are encoded by a single gene in Drosophila, which is diversified by alternative splicing (Figure 1A). Different Dscam isoforms have a common domain architecture, with ten Ig-like domains, six FNIII modules, a single transmembrane region, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic tail (Schmucker et al., 2000Schmucker D. Clemens J.C. Shu H. Worby C.A. Xiao J. Muda M. Dixon J.E. Zipursky S.L. Cell. 2000; 101: 671-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). Four variable regions are encoded by blocks of alternative exons, including portions of Ig-like domains Ig2 (12 alternative exons) and Ig3 (48 alternative exons), the whole Ig-like region for Ig7 (33 alternative exons), and two alternative transmembrane regions. Because splicing choice within each alternative exon block is thought to be largely independent of the others, this gives rise to 38,016 (12 × 48 × 33 × 2) different Dscam isoforms, 19,008 of which will have distinct extracellular regions. Early in vitro studies by Zipursky and colleagues showed that each of 11 Dscam isoforms exhibited homophilic binding specificity in adhesion studies in vitro; cells expressing a given Dscam isoform were capable of binding to beads coated with other identically spliced molecules but failed to bind to differently spliced Dscams (Wojtowicz et al., 2004Wojtowicz W.M. Flanagan J.J. Millard S.S. Zipursky S.L. Clemens J.C. Cell. 2004; 118: 619-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In vivo in the fruit fly, each photoreceptor neuron expresses a small and distinct, apparently random set of Dscam splice isoforms (Neves et al., 2004Neves G. Zucker J. Daly M. Chess A. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), and a subsequent study demonstrated that another cell type, mushroom body neurons, also express a small random set of Dscams (Zhan et al., 2004Zhan X.L.

Thus, each neuron may be differentially “tagged” by a distinctive set of Dscam isoforms, and dendrites of the same neuron will necessarily express an identical set of isoforms. Although the isoform-specific homophilic binding that Dscams exhibit in vitro might at first seem to suggest a mechanism for adhesion, it has now been established in numerous studies that Dscam homophilic interactions mediate avoidance between sister dendrites (Hughes et al., 2007Hughes M.E.

Neuron. 2004; 43: 663-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) in Drosophila. Homophilic engagement of Dscam extracellular domains between apposed neuronal surfaces expressing the same set of Dscam isoforms is thought to trigger cytoplasmic signaling events that lead to neurite repulsion. Consonant with this idea, deletion of the Dscam cytoplasmic domain results in adhesion rather than repulsion (Matthews et al., 2007Matthews B.J. Kim M.E. Flanagan J.J. Hattori D. Clemens J.C. Zipursky S.L. Grueber W.B. Cell. 2007; 129: 593-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Among the most striking biological roles for the repulsive activity of Dscams is in the patterning of sensory dendrites to achieve complete and nonoverlapping coverage of receptive fields. This “dendritic self avoidance,” which ensures that each location in a receptive field is innervated by an even density of dendrites from a given sensory neuron, appears to be driven by the action of Dscams. Numerous studies have now shown that single neurons lacking Dscam expression exhibit extensive self-crossing in their dendritic arbors. This phenotype can be rescued by expression of just a single Dscam isoform, suggesting that homophilic interaction between even a single isoform is sufficient to elicit the repulsive signal (Hughes et al., 2007Hughes M.E. Bortnick R. Tsubouchi A. Baumer P. Kondo M. Uemura T. Schmucker D. Neuron. 2007; 54: 417-427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, Matthews et al., 2007Matthews B.J.

Studies on limited numbers of Dscams, however, still leave open the question of whether the thousands of potential Dscam isoforms possess specific binding characteristics. In a recent paper published in Cell (Wojtowicz et al., 2007Wojtowicz W.M. Wu W. Andre I. Qian B. Baker D. Zipursky S.L. Cell. 2007; 130: 1134-1145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), Zipursky and colleagues developed a high-throughput ELISA-based binding assay to test the interaction specificity of a large number of Dscam alternative splice forms. These researchers systematically tested binding between pairs of Dscam ectodomains in three sets: (1) all 12 variable Ig2 domains with a constant Ig3 and Ig7; (2) 47 of 48 variable Ig3 domains in the context of constant Ig2 and Ig7 domains; and (3) all 33 Ig7 domains in the context of a constant Ig2 and Ig3. In all cases, these Dscam variants exhibited homophilic binding. Although some of these proteins did support heterophilic binding, such binding was largely observed between Dscams that differed in a single variable religion by a splice insertion closely related in sequence. The binding profile of each variable domain (i.e., the domains with which it exhibits heterophilic interactions and the domains with which it does not) is independent of the identity at the other two variable domains. This provides strong evidence for “modular” binding specificity, in which Ig2 domains bind a partner Ig2, Ig3 binds to Ig3, and Ig7 binds Ig7. Because each variable Ig domain module acts independently of the others, Dscam binding specificity can be combinatorially generated by alternative splice identity at each site. Thus, each variable Ig domain appears to have very weak homophilic self-binding, which is insufficient alone to elicit functional recognition. It is only when all three variable regions are identical between a Dscam pair that productive engagement can take place (Figure 1B). Differences in binding specificity between isoforms thus appear to require the avidity gained from interaction between each of the three variable regions, which must all include matching splice variants for productive binding. Interestingly, clustering of Dscam ectodomains was necessary to observe homophilic association in the binding assays performed by the Zipursky group. This raises the possibility that clustering mechanisms, perhaps via cis interactions between Dscams on the same membrane surface, may be required for Dscam function in vivo. The atomic-level basis of the extraordinary binding specificity of Dscam isoforms has heretofore been mysterious. In their recent paper published in Nature (Meijers et al., 2007Meijers R. Puettmann-Holgado R. Skiniotis G. Liu J.H. Walz T. Wang J.H. Schmucker D. Nature. 2007; (in press. Published online August 26, 2007)https://doi.org/10.1038/nature06147Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), Schmucker and Wang and their colleagues present crystal structures of two differently spliced Dscam ectodomain fragments corresponding to Ig domains 1–4. These proteins include the alternatively spliced regions from Ig2 and Ig3 but do not include Ig7. Cryoelectron microscopy results reported in the paper show that Dscams have a globular head, which corresponds to the four-domain fragments that were crystallized, followed by a tail that appears more randomly ordered. The Ig 1–4 “head” domain adopts the shape of a horseshoe (Figures 2A and 2B) and is similar to that observed in structures of the Ig superfamily adhesion molecules Axonin/Tag-1 (Freigang et al., 2000Freigang J. Proba K. Leder L. Diederichs K. Sonderegger P. Welte W. Cell. 2000; 101: 425-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and hemolin (Su et al., 1998Su X.D. Gastinel L.N. Vaughn D.E. Faye I. Poon P. Bjorkman P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 991-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), which may by analogy bind in a similar way as Dscams, albeit without their remarkable diversification. Each of the proteins studied crystallographically, Ig1-41.34 (which includes alternative sequence #1 of exon 4 in Ig2 and alternative sequence #34 of exon 6 in Ig3) and Ig1-49.9, forms a similar dimer in which intermolecular contacts are mediated by structural elements encoded by the alternatively spliced exons (Figure 2A). The region encoded by exon 4 runs from the beginning of Ig2 to the beginning of its D strand. Exon 6 encodes a region that runs from the Ig2-Ig3 linker region through the C strand of Ig3. Each of these variable regions spans the breadth of their Ig domains and present exposed residues on either face of the Ig1-4 horseshoe. Despite substantial sequence differences and crystallization in distinct lattices, each of the two splice isoforms form similar dimers. The horseshoe-shaped Ig1-4 molecules dimerize in an “antiparallel” orientation, revealing modular interactions between partner Ig2 domains and between partner Ig3 domains, which interact mainly through their variable sequences. Meijers et al. have defined variable elements on the Dscam homophilic binding face of the horseshoe as “epitope 1,” and those on the opposite face as “epitope 2” (Figure 2B). Site-directed mutagenesis experiments showed that only elements of epitope 1—those seen to form homophilic contacts in the crystal structures—are important for the homophilic interaction of Dscams in the context of the whole molecule. It seems possible that epitope 2, though not utilized for Dscam homophilic binding specificity, could be important for specificity in the immune recognition functions proposed for soluble Dscam isoforms in earlier work from the Schmucker lab (Watson et al., 2005Watson F.L. Puttmann-Holgado R. Thomas F. Lamar D.L. Hughes M. Kondo M. Rebel V.I. Schmucker D. Science. 2005; 309: 1874-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Interestingly, sequences of epitope 1 are more highly conserved among species than those of epitope 2, consistent with the idea that they may play a role in faster evolving host-pathogen interactions, which can differ considerably between species. In the homophilic dimer interfaces of both Dscam isoforms, equivalent peptide segments from the variable sequences of the unusually long A′ strand encoded by exon-4 and a unique A-A′ protrusion encoded by exon-6 form contacts in the Ig2/Ig2 and Ig3/Ig3 interfaces, respectively. This leads to the exciting notion that complementarity of identical peptide segments, interacting in an antiparallel orientation, appears to provide the fundamental basis for Dscam homophilic interaction (Figures 2C and 2D). Importantly, the most variable residues of epitope 1 constitute the core of the dimer interface, which is dominated by hydrophilic residues that interact to form a sequence-specific network of hydrogen bonds. The binding strength for each Ig domain dimer interface is therefore expected to be low, which would seem to be a necessity for Dscam specificity, which relies on combining three cognate interfaces at Ig2, Ig3, and Ig7 to mediate productive interaction. Extensive support for this binding model is provided by site-directed mutagenesis studies in both papers (Meijers et al., 2007Meijers R. Puettmann-Holgado R. Skiniotis G. Liu J.H. Walz T. Wang J.H. Schmucker D. Nature. 2007; (in press. Published online August 26, 2007)https://doi.org/10.1038/nature06147Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, Wojtowicz et al., 2007Wojtowicz W.M. Wu W. Andre I. Qian B. Baker D. Zipursky S.L. Cell. 2007; 130: 1134-1145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The Schmucker/Wang study demonstrated that swapping all of epitope 1 Ig2 sequences leads to the exchange of binding specificity between two Dscam isoforms, whereas swapping epitope 2 has no influence on homophilic binding (Meijers et al., 2007Meijers R. Puettmann-Holgado R. Skiniotis G. Liu J.H. Walz T. Wang J.H. Schmucker D. Nature. 2007; (in press. Published online August 26, 2007)https://doi.org/10.1038/nature06147Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The Zipursky group used functional experiments to narrow the specificity-determinants further to the single-residue level (Wojtowicz et al., 2007Wojtowicz W.M. Wu W. Andre I. Qian B. Baker D. Zipursky S.L. Cell. 2007; 130: 1134-1145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The logic here was to swap short segments corresponding to the binding interfaces defined for Ig2.1 and Ig3.34 between many different alternative Ig2 and Ig3 domains, respectively, and then to test their binding specificities to wild-type and other swapped isoforms. These studies demonstrated that short stretches of some ten amino acids or less are sufficient to promote self-recognition. Together, the two papers argue that it is variations within the framework of the palindromic β-strand interface contacts seen in the crystal structures that determine the molecular basis of the self-recognition for all Ig2 and Ig3 domains. Structures for Ig7 have not yet been determined, but modeling studies and amino acid swapping experiments between alternative Ig7 domains by Wojtowicz et al., 2007Wojtowicz W.M. Wu W. Andre I. Qian B. Baker D. Zipursky S.L. Cell. 2007; 130: 1134-1145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar suggest that like Ig2 and Ig3 it will bind through antiparallel interaction of variable structural elements on the same face of the Ig-like domain, but specificity determinants may involve a larger combination of residues from multiple β strands. It will be interesting to compare these models to crystals of Ig7 dimers, if and when they become available. The action of Dscams provides one of the most striking examples of highly specific intercellular recognition. The molecular mechanism underlying this extraordinary specificity underscores a key principle: binding specificity at the cellular level can be generated by small changes in weak molecular interfaces, which are amplified by the large number of molecules interacting between apposed cell surfaces (Chen et al., 2005Chen C.P. Posy S. Ben-Shaul A. Shapiro L. Honig B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 8531-8536Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the potential diversification of mammalian Dscams by alternative splicing is substantially less than that evident for the insect genes (Schmucker et al., 2000Schmucker D. Clemens J.C. Shu H. Worby C.A. Xiao J. Muda M. Dixon J.E. Zipursky S.L. Cell. 2000; 101: 671-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar), suggesting that vertebrate animals may employ different molecules to achieve the sister neurite repulsion function mediated by Dscams in insects. Nevertheless, a variety of protein families involved in neuronal guidance are also highly diversified by alternative splicing, including the gene-clustered protocadherins (Wu and Maniatis, 1999Wu Q. Maniatis T. Cell. 1999; 97: 779-790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar) and the neurexins (Ushkaryov et al., 1992Ushkaryov Y.A. Petrenko A.G. Geppert M. Sudhof T.C. Science. 1992; 257: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Whether these protein families make use of their alternative splicing-derived diversification in ways as astonishing as the Dscams remains to be determined. The author thanks Profs. W. Grueber and B.
