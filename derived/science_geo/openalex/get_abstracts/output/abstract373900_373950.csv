Drawing on techniques used by the fracture mechanics community, Rupert et al. (p. 1686 ) present experiments on freestanding aluminum films that show specific geometries cause either stress or strain concentrations on deformation. Confirming recent simulations, shear stresses were found to be a key driver of grain boundary motion."
https://openalex.org/W2117407223,"A huge research literature, across the behavioral and social sciences, uses information on individuals' subjective well-being. These are responses to questions--asked by survey interviewers or medical personnel--such as, ""How happy do you feel on a scale from 1 to 4?"" Yet there is little scientific evidence that such data are meaningful. This study examines a 2005-2008 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System random sample of 1.3 million U.S. citizens. Life satisfaction in each U.S. state is measured. Across America, people's answers trace out the same pattern of quality of life as previously estimated, from solely nonsubjective data, in one branch of economics (so-called ""compensating differentials"" neoclassical theory, originally from Adam Smith). There is a state-by-state match (r = 0.6, P < 0.001) between subjective and objective well-being. This result has some potential to help to unify disciplines."
https://openalex.org/W1993518198,"Background The World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS 2.0) measures disability due to health conditions including diseases, illnesses, injuries, mental or emotional problems, and problems with alcohol or drugs. Method The 12 Item WHODAS 2.0 was used in the second Australian Survey of Mental Health and Well-being. We report the overall factor structure and the distribution of scores and normative data (means and SDs) for people with any physical disorder, any mental disorder and for people with neither. Findings A single second order factor justifies the use of the scale as a measure of global disability. People with mental disorders had high scores (mean 6.3, SD 7.1), people with physical disorders had lower scores (mean 4.3, SD 6.1). People with no disorder covered by the survey had low scores (mean 1.4, SD 3.6). Interpretation The provision of normative data from a population sample of adults will facilitate use of the WHODAS 2.0 12 item scale in clinical and epidemiological research."
https://openalex.org/W2147516066,"Little is known about which components of the axonal cytoskeleton might break during rapid mechanical deformation, such as occurs in traumatic brain injury. Here, we micropatterned neuronal cell cultures on silicone membranes to induce dynamic stretch exclusively of axon fascicles. After stretch, undulating distortions formed along the axons that gradually relaxed back to a straight orientation, demonstrating a delayed elastic response. Subsequently, swellings developed, leading to degeneration of almost all axons by 24 h. Stabilizing the microtubules with taxol maintained the undulating geometry after injury but greatly reduced axon degeneration. Conversely, destabilizing microtubules with nocodazole prevented undulations but greatly increased the rate of axon loss. Ultrastructural analyses of axons postinjury revealed immediate breakage and buckling of microtubules in axon undulations and progressive loss of microtubules. Collectively, these data suggest that dynamic stretch of axons induces direct mechanical failure at specific points along microtubules. This microtubule disorganization impedes normal relaxation of the axons, resulting in undulations. However, this physical damage also triggers progressive disassembly of the microtubules around the breakage points. While the disintegration of microtubules allows delayed recovery of the ""normal"" straight axon morphology, it comes at a great cost by interrupting axonal transport, leading to axonal swelling and degeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2037244538,"Bio-Diodes Inward rectifier potassium channels conduct K + ions into the cell at internal negative membrane voltages, but at internal positive membrane voltages they are blocked by intracellular multivalent ions. These channels control the resting membrane voltage and are required for the healthy function of many electrically excitable cells. Mutations can result in transient paralysis causing, for example, heart problems. Tao et al. (p. 1668 ) now report a 3.1 angstrom resolution structure of the inward rectifier, Kir2.2 from chicken, which has a similar structure to the human equivalent. The combination of observations of conductive and inhibitory ion binding sites with electrophysiological data finally explains the mechanism of action of these long-studied channels and reveals how they maintain their low sensitivity to toxins, as well as provides a basis for the design of therapeutic drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2095682261,"Background Recent studies have shown that DNA methylation (DNAm) markers in peripheral blood may hold promise as diagnostic or early detection/risk markers for epithelial cancers. However, to date no study has evaluated the diagnostic and predictive potential of such markers in a large case control cohort and on a genome-wide basis. Principal Findings By performing genome-wide DNAm profiling of a large ovarian cancer case control cohort, we here demonstrate that active ovarian cancer has a significant impact on the DNAm pattern in peripheral blood. Specifically, by measuring the methylation levels of over 27,000 CpGs in blood cells from 148 healthy individuals and 113 age-matched pre-treatment ovarian cancer cases, we derive a DNAm signature that can predict the presence of active ovarian cancer in blind test sets with an AUC of 0.8 (95% CI (0.74–0.87)). We further validate our findings in another independent set of 122 post-treatment cases (AUC = 0.76 (0.72–0.81)). In addition, we provide evidence for a significant number of candidate risk or early detection markers for ovarian cancer. Furthermore, by comparing the pattern of methylation with gene expression data from major blood cell types, we here demonstrate that age and cancer elicit common changes in the composition of peripheral blood, with a myeloid skewing that increases with age and which is further aggravated in the presence of ovarian cancer. Finally, we show that most cancer and age associated methylation variability is found at CpGs located outside of CpG islands. Significance Our results underscore the potential of DNAm profiling in peripheral blood as a tool for detection or risk-prediction of epithelial cancers, and warrants further in-depth and higher CpG coverage studies to further elucidate this role."
https://openalex.org/W2163713616,"Degrees of Darkness Fruit flies in Africa have a tendency to be darker, the higher the altitude at which they live, because melanization offers a selective advantage. The dark pigmentation seen in some populations of Ugandan Drosophila melanogaster is owing to a lack of expression of the ebony gene, and expression results in yellow cuticle. Rebeiz et al. (p. 1663 ; see the News story by Pennisi ) show that mutations in cis regulatory elements, rather than in the coding region, are responsible for the dark color. A series of five mutations in a modular enhancer element influences the level of ebony expression: Three mutations already existed in fly populations with light cuticle color and a further two, more recently acquired dark-specific substitutions, together have created an allele of large effect, which has been swept to high frequency in this population of flies."
https://openalex.org/W2156333187,"The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is reported to cause apoptosis of infected cells and several of its proteins including the 3a accessory protein, are pro-apoptotic. Since the 3a protein localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi compartment, its role in causing ER stress was investigated in transiently transfected cells. Cells expressing the 3a proteins showed ER stress based on activation of genes for the ER chaperones GRP78 and GRP94. Since ER stress can cause differential modulation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), which includes the inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE-1), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) and PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) pathways, these were individually tested in 3a-expressing cells. Only the PERK pathway was found to be activated in 3a-expressing cells based on (1) increased phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α) and inhibitory effects of a dominant-negative form of eIF2α on GRP78 promoter activity, (2) increased translation of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) mRNA, and (3) ATF4-dependent activation of the C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) gene promoter. Activation of PERK affects innate immunity by suppression of type 1 interferon (IFN) signaling. The 3a protein was found to induce serine phosphorylation within the IFN alpha-receptor subunit 1 (IFNAR1) degradation motif and to increase IFNAR1 ubiquitination. Confocal microscopic analysis showed increased translocation of IFNAR1 into the lysosomal compartment and flow cytometry showed reduced levels of IFNAR1 in 3a-expressing cells. These results provide further mechanistic details of the pro-apoptotic effects of the SARS-CoV 3a protein, and suggest a potential role for it in attenuating interferon responses and innate immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2016799814,"Gut Check The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is particularly sensitive to damage by ionizing radiation. Despite decades of study, fundamental questions such as which cells and which molecular mechanisms mediate this GI damage remain a source of great controversy. Studying a series of genetically manipulated mice, Kirsch et al. (p. 593 , published online 17 December) conclude that GI epithelial cells, rather than endothelial cells, are the critical cellular targets of radiation damage and that apoptosis (a well-studied mechanism of cell death) is not a major contributor to the damage. Rather, an alternative cell-death pathway whose activity is inhibited by the tumor suppressor protein p53 appears to mediate GI damage. Further insights into this pathway may assist the development of medical counter-measures for preventing and treating radiation-induced tissue damage."
https://openalex.org/W2039017765,"Sirt1 is an evolutionarily conserved NAD+ dependent deacetylase involved in a wide range of processes including cellular differentiation, apoptosis, as well as metabolism, and aging. In this study, we investigated the role of hypothalamic Sirt1 in energy balance. Pharmacological inhibition or siRNA mediated knock down of hypothalamic Sirt1 showed to decrease food intake and body weight gain. Central administration of a specific melanocortin antagonist, SHU9119, reversed the anorectic effect of hypothalamic Sirt1 inhibition, suggesting that Sirt1 regulates food intake through the central melanocortin signaling. We also showed that fasting increases hypothalamic Sirt1 expression and decreases FoxO1 (Forkhead transcription factor) acetylation suggesting that Sirt1 regulates the central melanocortin system in a FoxO1 dependent manner. In addition, hypothalamic Sirt1 showed to regulate S6K signaling such that inhibition of the fasting induced Sirt1 activity results in up-regulation of the S6K pathway. Thus, this is the first study providing a novel role for the hypothalamic Sirt1 in the regulation of food intake and body weight. Given the role of Sirt1 in several peripheral tissues and hypothalamus, potential therapies centered on Sirt1 regulation might provide promising therapies in the treatment of metabolic diseases including obesity."
https://openalex.org/W1970104310,"Mounting evidence indicates that the function of members of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family extends beyond blood vessel formation. Here, we show that the prolonged intramyocardial expression of VEGF-A165 and VEGF-B167 on adeno-associated virus-mediated gene delivery determined a marked improvement in cardiac function after myocardial infarction in rats, by promoting cardiac contractility, preserving viable cardiac tissue, and preventing remodeling of the left ventricle (LV) over time. Consistent with this functional outcome, animals treated with both factors showed diminished fibrosis and increased contractile myocardium, which were more pronounced after expression of the selective VEGF receptor-1 (VEGFR-1) ligand VEGF-B, in the absence of significant induction of angiogenesis. We found that cardiomyocytes expressed VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and neuropilin-1 and that, in particular, VEGFR-1 was specifically up-regulated in hypoxia and on exposure to oxidative stress. VEGF-B exerted powerful antiapoptotic effect in both cultured cardiomyocytes and after myocardial infarction in vivo. Finally, VEGFR-1 activation by VEGF-B was found to elicit a peculiar gene expression profile proper of the compensatory, hypertrophic response, consisting in activation of αMHC and repression of βMHC and skeletal α-actin, and an increase in SERCA2a, RYR, PGC1α, and cardiac natriuretic peptide transcripts, both in cultured cardiomyocytes and in infarcted hearts. The finding that VEGFR-1 activation by VEGF-B prevents loss of cardiac mass and promotes maintenance of cardiac contractility over time has obvious therapeutic implications.—Zentilin, L., Puligadda, U., Lionetti, V., Zacchigna, S., Collesi, C., Pattarini, L., Ruozi, G., Camporesi, S., Sinagra, G., Pepe, M., Recchia, F.

https://openalex.org/W2062194766,"We report here crystallization at long range in networks of like-charge supramolecular peptide filaments mediated by repulsive forces. The crystallization is spontaneous beyond a given concentration of the molecules that form the filaments but can be triggered by x-rays at lower concentrations. The crystalline domains formed by x-ray irradiation, with interfilament separations of up to 320 angstroms, can be stable for hours after the beam is turned off, and ions that screen charges on the filaments suppress ordering. We hypothesize that the stability of crystalline domains emerges from a balance of repulsive tensions linked to native or x-ray-induced charges and the mechanical compressive entrapment of filaments within a network. Similar phenomena may occur naturally in the cytoskeleton of cells and, if induced externally in biological or artificial systems, lead to possible biomedical and lithographic functions."
https://openalex.org/W2034198983,"FGF19 and FGF21, unique members of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family, are hormones that regulate glucose, lipid, and energy homeostasis. Increased hepatocyte proliferation and liver tumor formation have also been observed in FGF19 transgenic mice. Here, we report that, in contrast to FGF19, FGF21 does not induce hepatocyte proliferation in vivo. To identify the mechanism for FGF19-induced hepatocyte proliferation, we explored similarities and differences in receptor specificity between FGF19 and FGF21. We find that although both are able to activate FGF receptors (FGFRs) 1c, 2c, and 3c, only FGF19 activates FGFR4, the predominant receptor in the liver. Using a C-terminal truncation mutant of FGF19 and a series of FGF19/FGF21 chimeric molecules, we determined that amino acids residues 38–42 of FGF19 are sufficient to confer both FGFR4 activation and increased hepatocyte proliferation in vivo to FGF21.

IntroductionFGF19, FGF21, and FGF23 form a unique subfamily of fibroblast growth factors (FGFs). 3The abbreviations used are: FGFfibroblast growth factorPBSphosphate-buffered salineBrdUbromodeoxyuridineFGFRFGF receptorERKextracellular signal-regulated kinase. Unlike other FGFs, all three have been shown to function as endocrine hormones in the regulation of various metabolic processes (1.Fukumoto S. Endocr.

Administration of recombinant FGF19 or FGF21 protein to diabetic mice resulted in the reduction of serum glucose and insulin levels, improved glucose tolerance, and reduced liver steatosis and body weight (7.Kharitonenkov A.

In addition, FGF21 improved glucose, insulin, and lipid profiles and reduced body weight in diabetic rhesus monkeys (9.Kharitonenkov A. Wroblewski V.J. Koester A. Chen Y.F. Clutinger C.K. Tigno X.T. Hansen B.C. Shanafelt A.B. Etgen G.J. Endocrinology. 2007; 148: 774-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest the potential utility of FGF19 and FGF21 for the treatment of diabetes and obesity (1.Fukumoto S. Endocr. J. 2008; 55: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).Because of the sequence and structural homology between FGF19 and FGF21 with the other FGFs, most of which have well established roles in cell proliferation and mitogenesis, whether FGF19 and FGF21 could induce cell proliferation have also been investigated. In the case of FGF19, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) formation was observed in transgenic mice overexpressing FGF19 in skeletal muscle (10.Nicholes K. Guillet S. Tomlinson E. Hillan K. Wright B. Frantz G.D. Pham T.A. Dillard-Telm L. Tsai S.P. Stephan J.P. Stinson J. Stewart T. French D.M. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 160: 2295-2307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In addition, increases in the proliferation of pericentral hepatocytes, as measured by enhanced BrdU labeling, was observed both in FGF19 transgenic animals and wild-type mice administered recombinant FGF19 (10.Nicholes K. Guillet S. Tomlinson E. Hillan K. Wright B. Frantz G.D. Pham T.A. Dillard-Telm L. Tsai S.P. Stephan J.P. Stinson J. Stewart T. French D.M. Am. J.

Because constitutive hepatocellular proliferation may be a prerequisite for transformation (11.Fausto N. Sem. Liver Dis. 1999; 19: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), it is interesting to note that cell lineage analysis of FGF19-induced tumors suggests that dysplastic and neoplastic hepatocytes originated adjacent to central veins, where increased proliferation was localized as determined by BrdU labeling (10.Nicholes K. Guillet S. Tomlinson E. Hillan K. Wright B. Frantz G.D. Pham T.A. Dillard-Telm L. Tsai S.P. Stephan J.P. Stinson J. Stewart T. French D.M. Am. J.

These results suggest that FGF19 induced hepatocyte proliferation may ultimately lead to HCC formation (10.Nicholes K. Guillet S. Tomlinson E. Hillan K. Wright B. Frantz G.D. Pham T.A.

FGFR4 has been proposed to play a role in the observed induction of hepatocyte proliferation and carcinogenesis by FGF19 (10.Nicholes K. Guillet S. Tomlinson E. Hillan K. Wright B. Frantz G.D. Pham T.A. Dillard-Telm L. Tsai S.P. Stephan J.P. Stinson J. Stewart T. French D.M. Am. J.

Yang C. Jin C. Luo Y. Wang F. McKeehan W.L. Mol. Carcinogenesis. 2009; 48: 553-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Therefore, the mechanism for FGF19 induced hepatocyte mitogenesis has not been elucidated, and the receptor responsible for this activity remains unclear.Receptor utilization for this subfamily has been elucidated recently. Both FGF19 and FGF21 utilize β-Klotho, a single transmembrane protein, as a co-receptor in addition to FGFRs for signaling (13.Kurosu H. Kuro-O M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2009; 299: 72-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Potential differences in FGFR utilization between FGF19 and FGF21 have been reported (14.Kurosu H. Choi M. Ogawa Y. Dickson A.S. Goetz R. Eliseenkova A.V. Mohammadi M. Rosenblatt K.P. Kliewer S.A. Kuro-o M. J. Biol.

However, whether FGF21 causes hepatocyte proliferation and whether the reported differences in receptor specificity between FGF19 and FGF21 contribute to mitogenicity are not clear.In this report, we show that, in contrast to FGF19, FGF21 does not increase hepatocyte proliferation in vivo. In addition, using a series of novel FGF19 and FGF21 truncation and chimeric molecules, we have identified a region on FGF19 that is responsible for FGFR4 activation and propose that FGFR4 activation is the mechanism whereby FGF19 can increase hepatocyte proliferation and induce hepatocellular carcinoma formation.DISCUSSIONBoth FGF19 and FGF21 are novel hormones that regulate glucose, lipid, and energy homeostasis (5.Tomlinson E.

Zhang Z. Ko H.J. Kim J.K. Véniant M.M. Diabetes. 2009; 58: 250-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). FGF19 is also able to induce hepatocyte proliferation and cause formation of liver tumors in mice; however, the mechanism has not been determined previously (10.Nicholes K. Guillet S. Tomlinson E. Hillan K. Wright B. Frantz G.D. Pham T.A. Dillard-Telm L. Tsai S.P. Stephan J.P. Stinson J. Stewart T. French D.M. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 160: 2295-2307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In this report, using BrdU labeling as a measure for in vivo mitotic activity, we show that, in contrast to FGF19, FGF21 does not induce hepatocyte proliferation when compared directly with FGF19. These experiments suggest functional differentiation between FGF19 and FGF21. Given that increased hepatocyte proliferation is believed to be a prerequisite for neoplastic transformation (11.Fausto N. Sem. Liver Dis. 1999; 19: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), these results may suggest that FGF21 would not cause HCC in rodents.To better understand the mechanism leading to the proliferative activity observed with FGF19, we initially focused our attention on the differences in receptor specificity observed between FGF19 and FGF21. Both FGF19 and FGF21 activate FGFR1c, 2c and 3c, however, only FGF19 activates FGFR4 in vitro as measured by ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 2). Because FGFR4 is the predominant FGF receptor expressed in the liver, we hypothesized that the unique specificity of FGF19 toward FGFR4 might be responsible for its involvement in liver tumorigenesis. The first direct evidence supporting this hypothesis was derived from experiments with FGF19dCTD, a C-terminally truncated variant of FGF19 protein. The inability of FGF19dCTD to bind β-Klotho explains its lack of activity at FGFRs 1c, 2c, and 3c (Fig. 3) (15.Wu X. Ge H. Lemon B. Weiszmann J. Gupte J. Hawkins N. Li X. Tang J. Lindberg R. Li Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 14379-14384Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, FGF19dCTD retained its ability to activate FGFR4 in a β-Klotho-independent manner. Therefore, this variant is an FGFR4 specific activator. When tested in vivo for its effect on hepatocyte proliferation, FGF19dCTD increased BrdU incorporation in pericentral hepatocytes similar to FGF19, suggesting activation of FGFR4 alone is sufficient to promote hepatocyte proliferation.To provide further evidence supporting this hypothesis and to identify region(s) in FGF19 responsible for FGFR4 activation, we generated chimeric proteins between FGF19 and FGF21 and tested their activity in signaling and proliferation assays (Fig. 4). These analyses showed an absolute correlation between the ability to activate FGFR4, measured by ERK phosphorylation in vitro, and increased pericentral hepatocyte proliferation measured by BrdU labeling in liver in vivo. This provides further evidence for the hypothesis that liver FGFR4 activation and hepatocyte proliferation are linked. In addition, this study identified a 5 amino acid region (residues 38–42) on FGF19 that is important and potentially sufficient for FGFR4 activation. This was further supported by experiments with FGF21/1938–42 in which only these 5 amino acids from FGF19 were substituted into FGF21. The substitution of these 5 amino acids was sufficient to confer a gain-of-function phenotype on FGF21 with respect to both FGFR4 activation and increased hepatocyte proliferation (Fig. 5).Taken together: 1) the lack of increased hepatocyte proliferation by FGF21 treatment in direct comparison with FGF19; 2) the ability of FGF19dCTD, an FGFR4 specific activator, to increase pericentral hepatocyte BrdU incorporation; 3) the absolute correlation among FGF19/FGF21 chimeric molecules in their ability to induce FGFR4 activation and to increase pericentral hepatocyte BrdU staining; and finally 4) the ability of just 5 residues from FGF19 to confer FGFR4 activation and increased BrdU labeling in pericentral hepatocytes, these observations provide compelling evidence that FGFR4 activation in hepatocytes leads to increased proliferation which may cause HCC. IntroductionFGF19, FGF21, and FGF23 form a unique subfamily of fibroblast growth factors (FGFs). 3The abbreviations used are: FGFfibroblast growth factorPBSphosphate-buffered salineBrdUbromodeoxyuridineFGFRFGF receptorERKextracellular signal-regulated kinase. Unlike other FGFs, all three have been shown to function as endocrine hormones in the regulation of various metabolic processes (1.Fukumoto S. Endocr. J. 2008; 55: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). FGF23 originates in bone and regulates phosphate homeostasis in kidney (2.Fukumoto S. Yamashita T. Bone. 2007; 40: 1190-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), FGF21 is expressed predominantly in liver and signals in adipose tissue (3.Ogawa Y. Kurosu H. Yamamoto M. Nandi A. Rosenblatt K.P. Goetz R. Eliseenkova A.V. Mohammadi M. Kuro-o M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 7432-7437Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar), and FGF19 is secreted from ileum and functions as an enterohepatic signal for the regulation of bile acid metabolism (4.Inagaki T.

Both FGF19 and FGF21 transgenic mice are resistant to diet-induced obesity, have decreased body fat mass and improved insulin sensitivity, glucose disposal, and plasma lipid parameters (5.Tomlinson E.

Administration of recombinant FGF19 or FGF21 protein to diabetic mice resulted in the reduction of serum glucose and insulin levels, improved glucose tolerance, and reduced liver steatosis and body weight (7.Kharitonenkov A. Shiyanova T.L. Koester A. Ford A.M. Micanovic R. Galbreath E.J. Sandusky G.E. Hammond L.J. Moyers J.S. Owens R.A. Gromada J. Brozinick J.T. Hawkins E.D. Wroblewski V.J. Li D.S. Mehrbod F.

In addition, FGF21 improved glucose, insulin, and lipid profiles and reduced body weight in diabetic rhesus monkeys (9.Kharitonenkov A. Wroblewski V.J. Koester A. Chen Y.F. Clutinger C.K. Tigno X.T. Hansen B.C. Shanafelt A.B. Etgen G.J. Endocrinology. 2007; 148: 774-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest the potential utility of FGF19 and FGF21 for the treatment of diabetes and obesity (1.Fukumoto S. Endocr. J. 2008; 55: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).Because of the sequence and structural homology between FGF19 and FGF21 with the other FGFs, most of which have well established roles in cell proliferation and mitogenesis, whether FGF19 and FGF21 could induce cell proliferation have also been investigated. In the case of FGF19, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) formation was observed in transgenic mice overexpressing FGF19 in skeletal muscle (10.Nicholes K. Guillet S. Tomlinson E. Hillan K. Wright B. Frantz G.D. Pham T.A. Dillard-Telm L. Tsai S.P. Stephan J.P. Stinson J. Stewart T. French D.M. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 160: 2295-2307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In addition, increases in the proliferation of pericentral hepatocytes, as measured by enhanced BrdU labeling, was observed both in FGF19 transgenic animals and wild-type mice administered recombinant FGF19 (10.Nicholes K. Guillet S. Tomlinson E. Hillan K. Wright B. Frantz G.D. Pham T.A. Dillard-Telm L. Tsai S.P. Stephan J.P. Stinson J. Stewart T. French D.M. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 160: 2295-2307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Because constitutive hepatocellular proliferation may be a prerequisite for transformation (11.Fausto N. Sem. Liver Dis. 1999; 19: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), it is interesting to note that cell lineage analysis of FGF19-induced tumors suggests that dysplastic and neoplastic hepatocytes originated adjacent to central veins, where increased proliferation was localized as determined by BrdU labeling (10.Nicholes K. Guillet S. Tomlinson E. Hillan K. Wright B. Frantz G.D. Pham T.A. Dillard-Telm L. Tsai S.P. Stephan J.P. Stinson J. Stewart T. French D.M. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 160: 2295-2307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). These results suggest that FGF19 induced hepatocyte proliferation may ultimately lead to HCC formation (10.Nicholes K. Guillet S. Tomlinson E. Hillan K. Wright B. Frantz G.D. Pham T.A.

FGFR4 has been proposed to play a role in the observed induction of hepatocyte proliferation and carcinogenesis by FGF19 (10.Nicholes K. Guillet S. Tomlinson E. Hillan K. Wright B. Frantz G.D. Pham T.A. Dillard-Telm L. Tsai S.P. Stephan J.P. Stinson J. Stewart T. French D.M. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 160: 2295-2307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar); however, contradicting evidence proposing a protective role for FGFR4 in suppressing hepatoma progression has also been proposed (12.Huang X. Yang C. Jin C. Luo Y. Wang F. McKeehan W.L. Mol. Carcinogenesis. 2009; 48: 553-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Therefore, the mechanism for FGF19 induced hepatocyte mitogenesis has not been elucidated, and the receptor responsible for this activity remains unclear.Receptor utilization for this subfamily has been elucidated recently. Both FGF19 and FGF21 utilize β-Klotho, a single transmembrane protein, as a co-receptor in addition to FGFRs for signaling (13.Kurosu H. Kuro-O M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2009; 299: 72-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Potential differences in FGFR utilization between FGF19 and FGF21 have been reported (14.Kurosu H. Choi M. Ogawa Y. Dickson A.S. Goetz R. Eliseenkova A.V. Mohammadi M. Rosenblatt K.P. Kliewer S.A. Kuro-o M. J. Biol.

However, whether FGF21 causes hepatocyte proliferation and whether the reported differences in receptor specificity between FGF19 and FGF21 contribute to mitogenicity are not clear.In this report, we show that, in contrast to FGF19, FGF21 does not increase hepatocyte proliferation in vivo. In addition, using a series of novel FGF19 and FGF21 truncation and chimeric molecules, we have identified a region on FGF19 that is responsible for FGFR4 activation and propose that FGFR4 activation is the mechanism whereby FGF19 can increase hepatocyte proliferation and induce hepatocellular carcinoma formation."

In our kinesin·AMPPPNP crystal structure, closure of the active site results in structural transformations appropriate for microtubule binding and organizes an orthosteric two-water cluster. We conclude that a proton is shared between the lytic water, positioned for γ-phosphate attack, and a second water that serves as a general base. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental detection of the catalytic base for any ATPase. Deprotonation of the second water by switch residues likely triggers subsequent large scale structural rearrangements. Therefore, the catalytic base is responsible for initiating nucleophilic attack of ATP and for relaying the positive charge over long distances to initiate mechanotransduction. Coordination of switch movements via sequential proton transfer along paired water clusters may be universal for nucleotide triphosphatases with conserved active sites, such as myosins and G-proteins.

Coordination of switch movements via sequential proton transfer along paired water clusters may be universal for nucleotide triphosphatases with conserved active sites, such as myosins and G-proteins. In a wide variety of protein machines, the binding and hydrolysis of ATP are chemically coupled to large scale conformational changes that occur within and distant from the nucleotide site, resulting in force generation and movement. Bimolecular motors, like kinesins (1.Endow S.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 2.Hirokawa N. Science. 1998; 279: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar), and proteins not conventionally considered motors, such as DNA-modifying enzymes, use this principle of mechanotransduction to perform their cellular roles. However, direct cause-and-effect linkage between the catalytic steps and powered structural changes in these proteins has not been established, principally as the deprotonation partner in the initial chemical step of protein-driven ATP hydrolysis is not known. Within kinesins, as well as myosins and G-proteins, common sequence motifs, such as switch I, switch II, and the P-loop, organize into an active site that can accelerate NTP hydrolysis. It is well accepted that the nucleophile for catalysis is a water molecule and that protonation and deprotonation events are at the core of this acid-base reaction. Upon substrate binding, the initial chemical step is that a catalytic base abstracts a proton from the lytic water. The resulting hydroxide ion attacks the substrate at the γ-phosphate and alters the partial charge distribution between the γ- and β-phosphate groups. The β-γ-phosphoanhydride bond is cleaved upon the shift in electron charge within the substrate, and the reaction products, a nucleotide diphosphate leaving group and an inorganic phosphate (Pi), are formed. Elusive for kinesins specifically and other ATPases in general is experimental identification of the catalytic base. The chemical nature of the base defines how catalysis in motor proteins can be accelerated, controlled, or reversed. The archetypal model of protein-mediated ATP hydrolysis predicts that the proton acceptor should be a conserved amino acid side chain and that the proton-donating and proton-accepting groups are in close proximity. However, protein crystallographic models (3.Fisher A.J. Smith C.A. Thoden J.B. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8960-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar) have not identified an obvious proton acceptor within 5 Å of the phosphate ester linkage of ATP. Thus, two alternate proposals have been put forth: substrate-assisted catalysis, in which a proton of the attacking water molecule is transferred to an oxygen of the γ-phosphate (4.Gulick A.M. Bauer C.B. Thoden J.B. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11619-11628Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), and a proton relay mechanism in which a water network spanning the distance between conserved residues and substrate provides a proton shuttle (5.Onishi H. Mochizuki N. Morales M.F. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3757-3763Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Implicit within the latter proposal is that the distance between the acid-base pair can be increased by water molecules. Discrimination between these proton transfer models is necessary for not only understanding the mechanism of ATP hydrolysis proper but also for describing how events at the active site are transmitted to distal parts of the protein. Here we have determined the crystal structure of the wild-type motor domain of human Eg5 kinesin in a prehydrolytic state, trapped by the non-hydrolyzable analogue AMPPNP. 2The abbreviations used are: AMPPNP5′-adenylylimidodiphosphateNTPasenucleotide triphosphataseMTmicrotubuleMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidPIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidcryo-EMcryo-electron microscopy. This study provides the first experimental observation of the catalytic base for any nucleotide triphosphatase (NTPase) and the first atomic details regarding the prehydrolysis state for any motor protein. Several observations in our data support these assignments. The electron density around the bound nucleotide (see Fig. 1a) cradles three phosphate groups in the active site, and the γ-phosphate is in a tetrahedral geometry. Second, both switch regions are in a closed conformation (see Fig. 1b) and linked by a salt bridge, revealing an ordered water network spanning the distance from an interswitch salt bridge to the nucleotide γ-phosphate. Lastly, structural elements required for microtubule (MT) binding have distinct conformational organizations and molecular interactions not previously observed. This initial set of structural and chemical isomerizations necessary to prime ATP hydrolysis and mechanotransduction in kinesins is likely conserved in myosin, another major superfamily of motor proteins. Our data also provide a mechanistic model for how transmission of a proton across a water network disrupts an interswitch salt bridge, thereby promoting a second major conformational transition. 5′-adenylylimidodiphosphate nucleotide triphosphatase microtubule 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid cryo-electron microscopy.

The search model was molecule A of the Eg5·ADP·monastrol complex (Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID 1X88) without associated waters, ADP, Mg2+, and monastrol. These coordinates are also missing switch II cluster residues 272–286. Using data in the range 8–3.5 Å and a sphere of 25 Å, the rotation function yielded two clear solutions. The translation function verified that the top two rotation function orientations were correct. Rigid-body fitting in AMoRe using data in the range 8–3.5 Å yielded an Rcryst of 48.2. At this point, 15 steps of CNS (8.Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar) rigid-body refinement using data from 25 to 2.42 Å yielded Rcryst = 49.5, Rfree = 48.8. Next, a 5,000 K slow cool-simulated annealing using torsion angle dynamics produced coordinates with Rcryst = 40.0, Rfree = 45.6 for 25–2.42 Å data. Inspection of initial 2Fo − Fc and Fo − Fc maps indicated significant differences primarily in the two switch regions. These portions of the model were removed, and data were extended to 2.19 Å. Successive rounds of manual model building with O (9.Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar) and automated refinement were performed. When the model (not including waters, nucleotide, or Mg2+) was essentially complete, the CCP4 (10.Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar) program ACT was used to guide the application of non-crystallographic symmetry restraints. Non-crystallographic symmetry was applied to 34 residues in each of the two molecules. At a very late stage in model building, the coordinates and topology/parameter files for AMPPNP were acquired from Hic-Up (11.Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 1119-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), and the nucleotide and Mg2+ were positioned into the active sites. The final model contains residues 17–366 for each molecule of the asymmetric unit, 281 waters, two AMPPNP molecules, two Mg2+ ions, and one inorganic phosphate (Table 1 and supplemental Table S1). To determine whether we had inappropriately applied non-crystallographic symmetry, a 5,000 K slow cool-simulated annealing refinement using torsion angle dynamics was performed on the final model without the use of non-crystallographic symmetry restraints. The root mean square difference between the two Eg5 molecules after this refinement was 0.64 Å for all Cα atoms and 0.10 and 0.28 Å between Cα atoms from regions that include switch I (residues 217–238) and switch II (264–281) of each Eg5 molecule.

Kinesins, in common with myosins, are thought to undergo an ATP-induced conformational transition in which the switch regions flanking the active site shift from “open” to “closed” states (14.Kikkawa M. Hirokawa N. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4187-4194Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 15.Kull F.J. Endow S.A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 15-23Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the open state resembling the ADP-bound conformation. Indeed, numerous NTPases employ a γ-phosphate-sensing mechanism that alters their molecular conformations dependent upon the presence or absence of the γ-phosphate. The closed state of NTPases, in which critical determinants have been correctly positioned, is competent for supporting nucleotide hydrolysis, whereas the open state is not. Accordingly, the conformations of switch regions in the closed state of kinesins should be structurally distinct from either ADP-bound protein or the initial ATP·kinesin collision complex. Although the overall architecture of the Eg5·AMPPNP complex is akin to that of other microtubule motors (Fig. 1b), there are differences among the loops and helices surrounding the core β-sheet; these include L5, L9 (containing the 229NAYSSR234 switch I sequence (16.Vale R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar)), α3, L11 (containing the 265DLAGSE270 switch II sequence (16.Vale R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar)), α4, L12, and α6 (Fig. 1b). These regions are dissimilar from ADP-bound Eg5, exhibit two novel structural features that distinguish them from the structures of other kinesins bound to ATP analogues or transition state mimics (supplemental Table S2), and are consistent with expectations of a closed, catalytically competent state. First, the switch I conformation in Eg5·AMPPNP (Fig. 2a) adopts a closed conformation, unique for kinesins but previously seen in myosins (17.Smith C.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5404-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). In the Eg5·ADP structure (18.Turner J. Anderson R. Guo J. Beraud C. Fletterick R. Sakowicz R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25496-25502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), switch I residues 231–234 adopt a helical conformation that is 4 Å removed from the location of the (absent) γ-phosphate (Fig. 2a). The C terminus of α3 (residues 221–226; Fig. 2a), immediately preceding switch I, is unwound in the Eg5·AMPPNP structure in comparison with the Eg5·ADP structure. Unwinding of the α3 C terminus increases the length of the switch I loop, fosters interactions of the NAYSSR motif observed at the active site, and rotates the α3 helix slightly (∼11°, Fig. 2a) relative to the core β-sheet. As the switch I region of a kinesin had never been observed in a conformation analogous to that of a closed myosin switch I, it has been hypothesized that kinesin switch I functions differently from that of myosin (15.Kull F.J. Endow S.A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 15-23Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, our data confirm that the switch I of kinesins and myosin operates via closely related mechanisms, with each adopting a similar switch I conformation (Fig. 2b) that is required to fully enclose the nucleotide-binding site. Second, the switch II region in the Eg5·AMPPNP complex assumes a completely closed conformation (Fig. 2c), and the switch II loop interacts with switch I and the nucleotide γ-phosphate. Comparison of the ADP-bound, ATP analogue-bound, and transition state mimic-bound forms of kinesins (supplemental Table S2) does not show large changes in the secondary structure of switch II, and no large secondary structure changes are noted in this region of the Eg5·AMPPNP complex. However, for the first time in any wild-type kinesin crystal structure, the Eg5·AMPPNP structure features a completely ordered switch II loop (L11). The ordered switch II loop (Fig. 2c, red), which includes a short helical element formed by residues 272–275, is extended toward the active site. Residues in the switch II loop participate in H-bonding interactions with residues of switch I, the P-loop, α6, active site water molecules, and the nucleotide proper (see below). Because the switch II loop in Eg5 ADP-bound structures is disordered (supplemental Table S2), it appears that interactions provided by the γ-phosphate of AMPPNP have a stabilizing effect on these residues. Interaction with microtubules is crucial to kinesin function, and the ATP-bound form of motor proteins is accepted as the conformational state in which microtubules are stably bound (19.Kikkawa M. Trends Cell Biol. 2008; 18: 128-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 20.Woehlke G. Ruby A.K. Hart C.L. Ly B. Hom-Booher N. Vale R.D. Cell. 1997; 90: 207-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) and in which forward motion is produced in dimeric forms of kinesin. Therefore, substrate binding to the active site should elicit distal structural changes at the MT-binding surface, and these microscopic changes have been probed using crystallography and cryo-EM techniques. The “ATP-like” or “helix-up” structural orientation of the switch II relay helix (α4) in kinesins (19.Kikkawa M. Trends Cell Biol. 2008; 18: 128-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), also observed in our Eg5·AMPPNP structure (Fig. 1c and supplemental Movie S1), has been correlated with the chemical state of the nucleotide bound to the motor domain. This ATP-like position differs from the “ADP-like” state as the N-terminal portion of α4 is rotated toward the nucleotide-binding site and the helix as a whole is shifted away from the central β-sheet. In the ATP-like position, α4 is shifted out of the plane of the α6 helix, allowing for neck linker docking against the core β-sheet. Cryo-EM studies revealed that the α4 relay helix is also lengthened in kinesin·microtubule complexes (14.Kikkawa M. Hirokawa N. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4187-4194Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 21.Bodey A.J. Kikkawa M. Moores C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 388: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 22.Sindelar C.V. Downing K.H. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This lengthening has not uniformly been observed in the kinesin crystal structures in a presumed ATP-like state, prompting the suggestion that MT interactions are necessary for stabilizing a longer α4 helix (22.Sindelar C.V. Downing K.H. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 23.Cochran J.C. Sindelar C.V. Mulko N.K. Collins K.A. Kong S.E. Hawley R.S. Kull F.J. Cell. 2009; 136: 110-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Challenging this idea, the α4 helix in our crystal structure, found at the MT-binding face, agrees well in both length and orientation with cryo-EM densities of Drosophila Kinesin-5·AMPPNP·MT complexes (21.Bodey A.J. Kikkawa M. Moores C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 388: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Comparison of and structural agreement between our data and this recent cryo-EM study (21.Bodey A.J. Kikkawa M. Moores C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 388: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) reveal that not only the orientation but also the length of the α4 helix is important for achieving a tight, AMPPNP-MT-bound state and is directly correlated with the stability of the switch II loop. In addition, the fully ordered switch II region, only observed in the AMPPNP-form of Eg5, appears to organize additional residues into the α4 helix and alter the orientation of the relay helix. Coincident with these conformational changes is the observation of a novel network of H-bonding among residues of the switch II helix, the P-loop, and the α6 helix. Asn342 of α6, Arg274 of the switch II loop, and Gln106 of the P-loop form an H-bonding triad (supplemental Fig. S1). This interaction appears to stabilize the closed conformation of the switch II loop and may also serve as a mode of communication from the active site to the MT-binding surface. The closing of the nucleotide-binding pocket produces changes critical for enzyme-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis. Three mechanistic outcomes result from the conformations adopted by switch regions and their adjacent secondary structures and drive toward a conclusion regarding the biochemical role of the switch elements. First, there is formation of an anticipated interswitch salt bridge (15.Kull F.J. Endow S.A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 15-23Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) between the side chains of switch I Arg234 and switch II Glu270 that closes the active site (Fig. 3a). This Eg5 salt bridge is equivalent to a salt bridge between analogous residues in myosin switches, shown to be essential for closing the active site and ATP hydrolysis (24.Furch M. Fujita-Becker S. Geeves M.A. Holmes K.C. Manstein D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 797-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 25.Onishi H. Kojima S. Katoh K. Fujiwara K. Martinez H.M. Morales M.F. Proc. Natl.

U.S.A. 2002; 99: 15339-15344Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The salt-bridge geometry seen in the myosin·ADP·vanadate (17.Smith C.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5404-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar) and our Eg5·AMPPNP substrate pockets has not been observed in other wild-type kinesin structures in which the salt bridge is not formed at all or which feature a salt bridge with different geometries and distances (23.Cochran J.C.

Cell. 2004; 116: 591-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). These kinesin structures may represent intermediate states that precede an ATP-induced, fully closed conformation. A second mechanistic outcome resulting from the closed conformations adopted by Eg5·AMPPNP switch elements is the observation of not one but two water molecules (Figs. 1a and 3, W1 and W2) in the active site, one of which (W1) is coordinated by conserved switch residues and lies close to the scissile phosphate of AMPPNP. These two waters are present in each of the two Eg5·AMPPNP complexes in the crystal asymmetric unit with nearly identical orientations and with W1–W2 separation distances in each complex of 2.41 and 2.43 Å. Furthermore, omit electron density maps show that the densities for all four of the water molecules are well formed and equal in size (data not shown), and the temperature factor values for these water molecules have been refined to below the average for waters within the structure. The first water, W1, is oriented 3.3 Å from the γ-phosphorus atom in a nearly perfect “in-line” position for a nucleophilic role in catalysis (Fig. 3). This is the first observation of a water molecule proximal to the γ-phosphate of the kinesin substrate, and thus the lytic water, in these motor proteins. W1 is coordinated by the amide carbonyl group of switch I Ser233, the backbone amide group of switch II Gly268, and a second water molecule, W2. Given the chemistry of the available moieties surrounding W1, we reach the unexpected conclusion that W2 serves as the proton acceptor for the nucleophilic W1 (see below). The second water is secured in the nucleotide pocket via the backbone oxygen of Gly268 and the side chain oxygen of switch II Glu270. Thus, this active site water pair is positioned by a tight network of hydrogen bonds and bridges the distance between the γ-phosphate and the interswitch salt bridge. The advantage of such a hydrogen-bond network has been calculated for myosins, G-proteins, and F1-ATPase (29.Dittrich M. Schulten K. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2005; 37: 441-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 30.Grigorenko B.L. Rogov A.V. Topol I.A. Burt S.K. Martinez H.M. Nemukhin A.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

A. 2009; 113: 12439-12446Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) but never experimentally observed. A third important feature of the closed active site is the extensive protein-mediated electrostatic stabilization and H-bonding of the bound nucleotide that are central features in enzyme-catalyzed nucleotide hydrolysis. These H-bonding interactions with the nucleotide, complex in nature and also large in number, can have two effects: polarization of the γ-phosphate P–O bonds and reduced Coulombic repulsion in preparation for an associative nucleophilic attack by the lytic water (below). Overall, there are also two active site residues that have three H-bond"

https://openalex.org/W2117551340,"Cancer cells metabolize glucose at elevated rates and have a higher sensitivity to glucose reduction. However, the precise molecular mechanisms leading to different responses to glucose restriction between normal and cancer cells are not fully understood. We analyzed normal WI-38 and immortalized WI-38/S fetal lung fibroblasts and found that glucose restriction resulted in growth inhibition and apoptosis in WI-38/S cells, whereas it induced lifespan extension in WI-38 cells. Moreover, in WI-38/S cells glucose restriction decreased expression of hTERT (human telomerase reverse transcriptase) and increased expression of p16INK4a. Opposite effects were found in the gene expression of hTERT and p16 in WI-38 cells in response to glucose restriction. The altered gene expression was partly due to glucose restriction-induced DNA methylation changes and chromatin remodeling of the hTERT and p16 promoters in normal and immortalized WI-38 cells. Furthermore, glucose restriction resulted in altered hTERT and p16 expression in response to epigenetic regulators in WI-38 rather than WI-38/S cells, suggesting that energy stress-induced differential epigenetic regulation may lead to different cellular fates in normal and precancerous cells.

https://openalex.org/W2158287015,"Central nervous system (CNS) invasion during acute-stage HIV-infection has been demonstrated in a small number of individuals, but there is no evidence of neurological impairment at this stage and virus infection in brain appears to be controlled until late-stage disease. Using our reproducible SIV macaque model to examine the earliest stages of infection in the CNS, we identified immune responses that differentially regulate inflammation and virus replication in the brain compared to the peripheral blood and lymphoid tissues. SIV replication in brain macrophages and in brain of SIV-infected macaques was detected at 4 days post-inoculation (p.i.). This was accompanied by upregulation of innate immune responses, including IFNbeta, IFNbeta-induced gene MxA mRNA, and TNFalpha. Additionally, IL-10, the chemokine CCL2, and activation markers in macrophages, endothelial cells, and astrocytes were all increased in the brain at four days p.i. We observed synchronous control of virus replication, cytokine mRNA levels and inflammatory markers (MHC Class II, CD68 and GFAP) by 14 days p.i.; however, control failure was followed by development of CNS lesions in the brain. SIV infection was accompanied by induction of the dominant-negative isoform of C/EBPbeta, which regulates SIV, CCL2, and IL6 transcription, as well as inflammatory responses in macrophages and astrocytes. This synchronous response in the CNS is in part due to the effect of the C/EBPbeta on virus replication and cytokine expression in macrophage-lineage cells in contrast to CD4+ lymphocytes in peripheral blood and lymphoid tissues. Thus, we have identified a crucial period in the brain when virus replication and inflammation are controlled. As in HIV-infected individuals, though, this control is not sustained in the brain. Our results suggest that intervention with antiretroviral drugs or anti-inflammatory therapeutics with CNS penetration would sustain early control. These studies further suggest that interventions should target HIV-infected individuals with increased CCL2 levels or HIV RNA in the CNS."

https://openalex.org/W2050841284,"Background The TLR9 agonist CpG is increasingly applied in preclinical and clinical studies as a therapeutic modality to enhance tumor immunity. The clinical application of CpG appears, however, less successful than would be predicted from animal studies. One reason might be the different administration routes applied in most mouse studies and clinical trials. We studied whether the efficacy of CpG as an adjuvant in cancer immunotherapy is dependent on the route of CpG administration, in particular when the tumor is destructed in situ. Methodology/Principal Findings In situ tumor destruction techniques are minimally invasive therapeutic alternatives for the treatment of (nonresectable) solid tumors. In contrast to surgical resection, tumor destruction leads to the induction of weak but tumor-specific immunity that can be enhanced by coapplication of CpG. As in situ tumor destruction by cryosurgery creates an instant local release of antigens, we applied this model to study the efficacy of CpG to enhance antitumor immunity when administrated via different routes: peritumoral, intravenous, and subcutaneous but distant from the tumor. We show that peritumoral administration is superior in the activation of dendritic cells, induction of tumor-specific CTL, and long-lasting tumor protection. Although the intravenous and subcutaneous (at distant site) exposures are commonly used in clinical trials, they only provided partial protection or even failed to enhance antitumor responses as induced by cryosurgery alone. Conclusions/Significance CpG administration greatly enhances the efficacy of in situ tumor destruction techniques, provided that CpG is administered in close proximity of the released antigens. Hence, this study helps to provide directions to fully benefit from CpG as immune stimulant in a clinical setting."
https://openalex.org/W1982371329,"Neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the adult hippocampus has been implicated in neural plasticity and memory, but the molecular mechanisms controlling the proliferation and differentiation of newborn neurons and their integration into the synaptic circuitry are still largely unknown. To investigate this issue, we have analyzed the adult hippocampal neurogenesis in a PC3/Tis21-null mouse model. PC3/Tis21 is a transcriptional co-factor endowed with antiproliferative and prodifferentiative properties; indeed, its upregulation in neural progenitors has been shown to induce exit from cell cycle and differentiation. We demonstrate here that the deletion of PC3/Tis21 causes an increased proliferation of progenitor cells in the adult dentate gyrus and an arrest of their terminal differentiation. In fact, in the PC3/Tis21-null hippocampus postmitotic undifferentiated neurons accumulated, while the number of terminally differentiated neurons decreased of 40%. As a result, PC3/Tis21-null mice displayed a deficit of contextual memory. Notably, we observed that PC3/Tis21 can associate to the promoter of Id3, an inhibitor of proneural gene activity, and negatively regulates its expression, indicating that PC3/Tis21 acts upstream of Id3. Our results identify PC3/Tis21 as a gene required in the control of proliferation and terminal differentiation of newborn neurons during adult hippocampal neurogenesis and suggest its involvement in the formation of contextual memories."

Thirty-four p53-regulated genes were assayed for their increased levels of mRNA using quantitative real-time PCR. The largest difference between p53-arginine and p53-proline was found with the PERP gene involved in cell-cell adhesion and apoptosis. The most common set of genes that are transcribed better by the p53-arginine protein than the p53-proline protein was found in the apoptotic function (DR-4, NOXA, PUMA, and PIG-3). LIF, a cytokine that is required for optimal reproductive function, was produced at 2× higher levels by the p53-arginine than the p53-proline allele. The genes that induced their mRNAs at the highest levels compared to the baseline tended to be synthesized better by the p53-arginine protein than the p53-proline protein.

The resulting data signals may appear to be relatively uninformative when interpreted using qualitative inclusion-based methods. However, these same data can yield greater identification information when interpreted by computer using quantitative data-modeling methods. This study applies both qualitative and quantitative interpretation methods to a well-characterized DNA mixture and dilution data set, and compares the inferred match information. The results show that qualitative interpretation loses identification power at low culprit DNA quantities (below 100 pg), but that quantitative methods produce useful information down into the 10 pg range. Thus there is a ten-fold information gap that separates the qualitative and quantitative DNA mixture interpretation approaches. With low quantities of culprit DNA (10 pg to 100 pg), computer-based quantitative interpretation provides greater match sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W2111958293,"Flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) and Dna2 endonuclease/helicase (Dna2) sequentially coordinate their nuclease activities for efficient resolution of flap structures that are created during the maturation of Okazaki fragments and repair of DNA damage. Acetylation of FEN1 by p300 inhibits its endonuclease activity, impairing flap cleavage, a seemingly undesirable effect. We now show that p300 also acetylates Dna2, stimulating its 5'-3' endonuclease, the 5'-3' helicase, and DNA-dependent ATPase activities. Furthermore, acetylated Dna2 binds its DNA substrates with higher affinity. Differential regulation of the activities of the two endonucleases by p300 indicates a mechanism in which the acetylase promotes formation of longer flaps in the cell at the same time as ensuring correct processing. Intentional formation of longer flaps mediated by p300 in an active chromatin environment would increase the resynthesis patch size, providing increased opportunity for incorrect nucleotide removal during DNA replication and damaged nucleotide removal during DNA repair. For example, altering the ratio between short and long flap Okazaki fragment processing would be a mechanism for better correction of the error-prone synthesis catalyzed by DNA polymerase alpha."
https://openalex.org/W2077795704,"Tobacco smoking is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, including during pregnancy. Although effective ways of promoting smoking cessation during pregnancy exist, the impact of these interventions has not been studied at a national level. We estimated the prevalence of smoking throughout pregnancy in the Netherlands and quantified associations of maternal smoking throughout pregnancy with socioeconomic, behavioural, and neonatal risk factors for infant health and development.Data of five national surveys, containing records of 14,553 Dutch mothers and their offspring were analyzed. From 2001 to 2007, the overall rate of smoking throughout pregnancy fell by 42% (from 13.2% to 7.6%) mainly as a result of a decrease among highly educated women. In the lowest-educated group, the overall rate of smoking throughout pregnancy was six times as high as in the highest-educated group (18.7% versus 3.2%). Prenatal tobacco smoke exposure was associated with increased risk of extremely preterm (<or=28 completed weeks) (OR 7.25; 95% CI 3.40 to 15.38) and small-for-gestational age (SGA) infants (OR 3.08; 95% CI 2.66 to 3.57). Smoking-attributable risk percent in the population (based on adjusted risk ratios) were estimated at 29% for extremely preterm births and at 17% for SGA outcomes. Infants of smokers were more likely to experience significant alcohol exposure in utero (OR 2.08; 95%CI 1.25 to 3.45) and formula feeding in early life (OR 1.91; 95% CI 1.69 to 2.16).The rates of maternal smoking throughout pregnancy decreased significantly in the Netherlands from 2001 to 2007. If pregnant women were to cease tobacco use completely, an estimated 29% of extremely preterm births and 17% of SGA infants may be avoided annually."
https://openalex.org/W2018152064,"In humans, mutations in electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) or electron transfer flavoprotein dehydrogenase (ETFDH) lead to MADD/glutaric aciduria type II, an autosomal recessively inherited disorder characterized by a broad spectrum of devastating neurological, systemic and metabolic symptoms. We show that a zebrafish mutant in ETFDH, xavier, and fibroblast cells from MADD patients demonstrate similar mitochondrial and metabolic abnormalities, including reduced oxidative phosphorylation, increased aerobic glycolysis, and upregulation of the PPARG-ERK pathway. This metabolic dysfunction is associated with aberrant neural proliferation in xav, in addition to other neural phenotypes and paralysis. Strikingly, a PPARG antagonist attenuates aberrant neural proliferation and alleviates paralysis in xav, while PPARG agonists increase neural proliferation in wild type embryos. These results show that mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to an increase in aerobic glycolysis, affects neurogenesis through the PPARG-ERK pathway, a potential target for therapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2089215682,"Abnormal patterns of DNA methylation are observed in several types of human cancer. While localized DNA methylation of CpG islands has been associated with gene silencing, the effect that genome-wide loss of methylation has on tumorigenesis is not completely known. To examine its effect on tumorigenesis, we induced DNA demethylation in a rat model of human chondrosarcoma using 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine. Rat specific pyrosequencing assays were utilized to assess the methylation levels in both LINEs and satellite DNA sequences following 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine treatment. Loss of DNA methylation was accompanied by an increase in invasiveness of the rat chondrosarcoma cells, in vitro, as well as by an increase in tumor growth in vivo. Subsequent microarray analysis provided insight into the gene expression changes that result from 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine induced DNA demethylation. In particular, two genes that may function in tumorigenesis, sox-2 and midkine, were expressed at low levels in control cells but upon 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine treatment these genes became overexpressed. Promoter region DNA analysis revealed that these genes were methylated in control cells but became demethylated following 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine treatment. Following withdrawal of 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine, the rat chondrosarcoma cells reestablished global DNA methylation levels that were comparable to that of control cells. Concurrently, invasiveness of the rat chondrosarcoma cells, in vitro, decreased to a level indistinguishable to that of control cells. Taken together these experiments demonstrate that global DNA hypomethylation induced by 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine may promote specific aspects of tumorigenesis in rat chondrosarcoma cells."
https://openalex.org/W2171607857,"Several multigene families have been described that together encode scores of structural cuticular proteins in Drosophila, although the functional significance of this diversity remains to be explored. Here I investigate the evolutionary histories of several multigene families (CPR, Tweedle, CPLCG, and CPF/CPFL) that vary in age, size, and sequence complexity, using sequenced Drosophila genomes and mosquito outgroups. My objective is to describe the rates and mechanisms of 'cuticle-ome' divergence, in order to identify conserved and rapidly evolving elements. I also investigate potential examples of interlocus gene conversion and concerted evolution within these families during Drosophila evolution. The absolute rate of change in gene number (per million years) is an order of magnitude lower for cuticular protein families within Drosophila than it is among Drosophila and the two mosquito taxa, implying that major transitions in the cuticle proteome have occurred at higher taxonomic levels. Several hotspots of intergenic conversion and/or gene turnover were identified, e.g. some gene pairs have independently undergone intergenic conversion within different lineages. Some gene conversion hotspots were characterized by conversion tracts initiating near nucleotide repeats within coding regions, and similar repeats were found within concertedly evolving cuticular protein genes in Anopheles gambiae. Rates of amino-acid substitution were generally severalfold higher along the branch connecting the Sophophora and Drosophila species groups, and 13 genes have Ka/Ks significantly greater than one along this branch, indicating adaptive divergence. Insect cuticular proteins appear to be a source of adaptive evolution within genera and, at higher taxonomic levels, subject to periods of gene-family expansion and contraction followed by quiescence. However, this relative stasis is belied by hotspots of molecular evolution, particularly concerted evolution, during the diversification of Drosophila. The prominent association between interlocus gene conversion and repeats within the coding sequence of interacting genes suggests that the latter promote strand exchange."
https://openalex.org/W2041188783,"Variola virus (VARV) caused smallpox, one of the most devastating human diseases and the first to be eradicated, but its deliberate release represents a dangerous threat. Virulent orthopoxviruses infecting humans, such as monkeypox virus (MPXV), could fill the niche left by smallpox eradication and the cessation of vaccination. However, immunomodulatory activities and virulence determinants of VARV and MPXV remain largely unexplored. We report the molecular characterization of the VARV- and MPXV-secreted type I interferon-binding proteins, which interact with the cell surface after secretion and prevent type I interferon responses. The proteins expressed in the baculovirus system have been purified, and their interferon-binding properties characterized by surface plasmon resonance. The ability of these proteins to inhibit a broad range of interferons was investigated to identify potential adaptation to the human immune system. Furthermore, we demonstrate by Western blot and activity assays the expression of the type I interferon inhibitor during VARV and MPXV infections. These findings are relevant for the design of new vaccines and therapeutics to smallpox and emergent virulent orthopoxviruses because the type I interferon-binding protein is a major virulence factor in animal models, vaccination with this protein induces protective immunity, and its neutralization prevents disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W1989450052,"Emerging infectious diseases in wildlife are major threats for both human health and biodiversity conservation. Infectious diseases can have serious consequences for the genetic diversity of populations, which could enhance the species' extinction probability. The Ebola epizootic in western and central Africa induced more than 90% mortality in Western lowland gorilla population. Although mortality rates are very high, the impacts of Ebola on genetic diversity of Western lowland gorilla have never been assessed.We carried out long term studies of three populations of Western lowland gorilla in the Republic of the Congo (Odzala-Kokoua National Park, Lossi gorilla sanctuary both affected by Ebola and Lossi's periphery not affected). Using 17 microsatellite loci, we compared genetic diversity and structure of the populations and estimate their effective size before and after Ebola outbreaks. Despite the effective size decline in both populations, we did not detect loss in genetic diversity after the epizootic. We revealed temporal changes in allele frequencies in the smallest population.Immigration and short time elapsed since outbreaks could explain the conservation of genetic diversity after the demographic crash. Temporal changes in allele frequencies could not be explained by genetic drift or random sampling. Immigration from genetically differentiated populations and a non random mortality induced by Ebola, i.e., selective pressure and cost of sociality, are alternative hypotheses. Understanding the influence of Ebola on gorilla genetic dynamics is of paramount importance for human health, primate evolution and conservation biology."
https://openalex.org/W2032162135,"Brachyspira pilosicoli is an anaerobic spirochete that has received relatively little study, partly due to its specialized culture requirements and slow growth. This bacterium colonizes the large intestine of various species, including humans; typically, a dense layer of spirochete cells may be found intimately attached by one cell end to the surface of colonic enterocytes. Colonized individuals may develop colitis, but the mechanisms involved are not understood. The current study aimed to develop an in vitro model to investigate this process.Four strains of B. pilosicoli were incubated at a high multiplicity of infection with monolayers of a human colonic adenocarcinoma cell line (Caco-2 cells). One strain isolated from a pig (95/1000) and one from a human (WesB) attached to the monolayers. Colonization increased with time, with the Caco-2 cell junctions being the initial targets of attachment. By electron microscopy, individual spirochete cells could be seen to have one cell end invaginated into the Caco-2 cell membranes, with the rest of the spirochete draped over the Caco-2 cell surface. After 6 h incubation, the monolayer was covered with a layer of spirochetes. Colonized monolayers demonstrated a time-dependent series of changes: staining with labelled phalloidin identified accumulation of actin at the cell junctions; ZO-1 staining revealed a loss of Caco-2 tight junction integrity; and Hoechst staining showed condensation and fragmentation of nuclear material consistent with apoptosis. Using quantitative reverse transcription PCR, the colonized monolayers demonstrated a significant up-regulation of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and IL-8 expression. B. pilosicoli sonicates caused significant up-regulation of IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-6, but culture supernatants and non-pathogenic Brachyspira innocens did not alter cytokine expression.The changes induced in the Caco-2 cells provide evidence that B. pilosicoli has pathogenic potential, and give insights into the likely in vivo pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2044615889,"Background and Aims Meningococcal disease remains one of the most important infectious causes of death in industrialized countries. The highly diverse clinical presentation and prognosis of Neisseria meningitidis infections are the result of complex host genetics and environmental interactions. We investigated whether mitochondrial genetic background contributes to meningococcal disease (MD) susceptibility. Methodology/Principal Findings Prospective controlled study was performed through a national research network on MD that includes 41 Spanish hospitals. Cases were 307 paediatric patients with confirmed MD, representing the largest series of MD patients analysed to date. Two independent sets of ethnicity-matched control samples (CG1 [N = 917]), and CG2 [N = 616]) were used for comparison. Cases and controls underwent mtDNA haplotyping of a selected set of 25 mtDNA SNPs (mtSNPs), some of them defining major European branches of the mtDNA phylogeny. In addition, 34 ancestry informative markers (AIMs) were genotyped in cases and CG2 in order to monitor potential hidden population stratification. Samples of known African, Native American and European ancestry (N = 711) were used as classification sets for the determination of ancestral membership of our MD patients. A total of 39 individuals were eliminated from the main statistical analyses (including fourteen gypsies) on the basis of either non-Spanish self-reported ancestry or the results of AIMs indicating a European membership lower than 95%. Association analysis of the remaining 268 cases against CG1 suggested an overrepresentation of the synonym mtSNP G11719A variant (Pearson's chi-square test; adjusted P-value = 0.0188; OR [95% CI] = 1.63 [1.22–2.18]). When cases were compared with CG2, the positive association could not be replicated. No positive association has been observed between haplogroup (hg) status of cases and CG1/CG2 and hg status of cases and several clinical variants. Conclusions We did not find evidence of association between mtSNPs and mtDNA hgs with MD after carefully monitoring the confounding effect of population sub-structure. MtDNA variability is particularly stratified in human populations owing to its low effective population size in comparison with autosomal markers and therefore, special care should be taken in the interpretation of seeming signals of positive associations in mtDNA case-control association studies."
https://openalex.org/W2063152977,"Background The down-regulation of the major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) from the surface of infected cells by the Nef proteins of primate immunodeficiency viruses likely contributes to pathogenesis by providing evasion of cell-mediated immunity. HIV-1 Nef-induced down-regulation involves endosomal trafficking and a cooperative interaction between the cytoplasmic domain (CD) of MHC-I, Nef, and the clathrin adaptor protein complex-1 (AP-1). The CD of MHC-I contains a key tyrosine within the sequence YSQA that is required for down-regulation by Nef, but this sequence does not conform to the canonical AP-binding tyrosine-based motif Yxxφ, which mediates binding to the medium (μ) subunits of AP complexes. We previously proposed that Nef allows the MHC-I CD to bind the μ subunit of AP-1 (μ1) as if it contained a Yxxφmotif. Methods and Findings Here, we show that a direct interaction between the MHC-I CD/Nef and μ1 plays a primary role in the down-regulation of MHC-I: GST pulldown assays using recombinant proteins indicated that most of the MHC-I CD and Nef residues that are required for the down-regulation in human cells contribute to direct interactions with a truncated version of μ1. Specifically, the tyrosine residue of the YSQA sequence in the MHC-I CD as well as Nef residues E62-65 and P78 each contributed to the interaction between MHC-I CD/Nef and μ1 in vitro, whereas Nef M20 had little to no role. Conversely, residues F172/D174 and V392/L395 of the binding pocket on μ1 for Yxxφ motifs were required for a robust interaction. Conclusions These data indicate that the MHC-I cytoplasmic domain, Nef, and the C-terminal two thirds of the μ subunit of AP-1 are sufficient to constitute a biologically relevant interaction. The data also reveal an unexpected role for a hydrophobic pocket in μ1 for interaction with MHC-I CD/Nef."
https://openalex.org/W2076952522,"Background Leprosy was eliminated as a public health problem (<1 case per 10,000) in India by December 2005. With this target in sight the need for a separate vertical programme was diminished. The second phase of the National Leprosy Eradication Programme was therefore initiated: decentralisation of the vertical programme, integration of leprosy services into the primary health care (PHC) system and development of a surveillance system to monitor programme performance. Methodology/Principal Findings To study the process of integration a qualitative analysis of issues and perceptions of patients and providers, and a review of leprosy records and registers to evaluate programme performance was carried out in the state of Orissa, India. Program performance indicators such as a low mean defaulter rate of 3.83% and a low-misdiagnosis rate of 4.45% demonstrated no detrimental effect of integration on program success. PHC staff were generally found to be highly knowledgeable of diagnosis and management of leprosy cases due to frequent training and a support network of leprosy experts. However in urban hospitals district-level leprosy experts had assumed leprosy activities. The aim was to aid busy PHC staff but it also compromised their leprosy knowledge and management capacity. Inadequate monitoring of a policy of ‘new case validation,’ in which MDT was not initiated until primary diagnosis had been verified by a leprosy expert, may have led to approximately 26% of suspect cases awaiting confirmation of diagnosis 1–8 months after their initial PHC visit. Conclusions/Significance This study highlights the need for effective monitoring and evaluation of the integration process. Inadequate monitoring could lead to a reduction in early diagnosis, a delay in initiation of MDT and an increase in disability rates. This in turn could reverse some of the programme's achievements. These findings may help Andhra Pradesh and other states in India to improve their integration process and may also have implications for other disease elimination programmes such as polio and guinea worm (dracunculiasis) as they move closer to their elimination goals."
https://openalex.org/W2037932660,"One therapeutic approach to Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) recently entering clinical trials aims to convert DMD phenotypes to that of a milder disease variant, Becker Muscular Dystrophy (BMD), by employing antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) targeting splice sites, to induce exon skipping and restore partial dystrophin function. In order to search for small molecule and genetic modulators of AON-dependent and independent exon skipping, we screened ∼10,000 known small molecule drugs, >17,000 cDNA clones, and >2,000 kinase- targeted siRNAs against a 5.6 kb luciferase minigene construct, encompassing exon 71 to exon 73 of human dystrophin. As a result, we identified several enhancers of exon skipping, acting on both the reporter construct as well as endogenous dystrophin in mdx cells. Multiple mechanisms of action were identified, including histone deacetylase inhibition, tubulin modulation and pre-mRNA processing. Among others, the nucleolar protein NOL8 and staufen RNA binding protein homolog 2 (Stau2) were found to induce endogenous exon skipping in mdx cells in an AON-dependent fashion. An unexpected but recurrent theme observed in our screening efforts was the apparent link between the inhibition of cell cycle progression and the induction of exon skipping."

The HDAC-6 LXXLL motif between amino acids 313 and 418 made direct contact with the GR AF-1 domain. Interestingly enough, although the level of GR decreased in CREB knockdown cells, it was elevated in HDAC-6 knockdown cells.

In response to stress, the neuroendocrine system releases CRH and arginine vasopressin to regulate adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) hormone secretion from the anterior pituitary and glucocorticoids from the adrenal cortex (1Vale W.

Neuroendocrinology. 1983; 36: 165-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1741) Google Scholar). Increasing levels of circulating glucocorticoids down-regulate the synthesis of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in various tissues (3Schlechte J.A. Ginsberg B.H. Sherman B.M. J. Steroid Biochem. 1982; 16: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) in an endocrine feedback loop and produce inhibitory effects on the secretion of CRH and ACTH (4Jones M.T. Hillhouse E.W.

Endocrinology. 1972; 91: 961-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) to bring back the system to its resting state. When this balance is perturbed, as in glucocorticoid resistance, the decrease in the negative feedback control of cortisol in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis leads to increased secretion of ACTH and cortisol and resistance to adrenal suppression by DEX (6Chrousos G.P.

The diverse pathway through which glucocorticoids regulate gene transcription is illustrated in reports where glucocorticoids directly affect expression of arginine vasopressin through a glucocorticoid-response element (GRE) (8Burke Z.D.

Glucocorticoids inhibit CRH secretion and in doing so inhibit pro-opiomelanocortin synthesis (13Eberwine J.H. Roberts J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2166-2170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the pro-opiomelanocortin nGRE suppresses pro-opiomelanocortin synthesis in a hormone-dependent manner (14Tremblay Y. Tretjakoff I. Peterson A. Antakly T. Zhang C.X. Drouin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1988; 85: 8890-8894Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Like the AVP gene, response to glucocorticoids by the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene involves a functional interaction between the glucocorticoid-response element and cAMP-response element (CRE), which binds the cAMP-response element-binding protein, CREB (15Imai E. Miner J.N. Mitchell J.A. Yamamoto K.R. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5353-5356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite this wealth of information, the precise mechanism of feedback regulation remains elusive.In our previous studies, we demonstrated the negative feedback regulation of the GR gene in Att-20 cells (16Govindan M.V. Pothier F. Leclerc S. Palaniswami R. Xie B. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 40: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In target tissues, biological actions of glucocorticoid hormones are transmitted by the GR. At the cellular level, GR·hormone complexes mediate cell-specific response by binding to specific DNA sequences to modulate the expression of target genes. The human GR gene promoter lacks the classical TATA element, and the authentic GR transcription start site was identified by S1 nuclease mapping (17Leclerc S. Xie B.X. Roy R. Govindan M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8711-8719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18LeClerc S. Palaniswami R. Xie B.X. Govindan M.V. J. Biol.

Govindan M.V. Barden N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 1016-1022PubMed Google Scholar). Using extensive biochemical, recombinant, and affinity chromatographic techniques, we have characterized several factors binding to the promoter region of the human GR gene (21Warriar N. Pagé N. Govindan M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18662-18671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We have previously reported the presence of the feedback regulatory (FBR) sequence motif within the −2846 bp (29,335 bp) upstream of the GR cap site (32,181 bp of the GR gene) using S1 nuclease mapping and primer extension (20Pepin M.C. Govindan M.V. Barden N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 1016-1022PubMed Google Scholar). There are several regulatory sequences within this region as follows: at least two nGRE motifs at −1796 and −1485 and potential cAMP motifs at −1460 and −1073.The GR is down-regulated by its ligand in a mechanism of negative feedback regulation of its mRNA. Upon translocation to the nucleus, the GR·hormone complex binds to specific DNA sequences (22Govindan M.V. Exp. Cell Res. 1980; 127: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In the nucleus, however, eukaryotic chromosomes are compacted together, and most DNA sequences are inaccessible to transcription factors. Alteration in chromatin structure modulates the accessibility of regulatory sites to DNA-binding proteins. The core of the nucleosome, the basic subunit of chromatin, consists of an octamer of two copies each of four core histones as follows: an H3-H4 tetramer and dimers of H2A-H2B around which 147 bp of DNA are wound (23Kornberg R.D. Science. 1974; 184: 868-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (1616) Google Scholar). This core is hydrophobic and conceals the C-terminal regions of the histones, whereas the N-terminal tails with highly conserved lysines protrude. Acetylation of these lysines is one of the first steps of actively transcribed chromatin (24Wu R.S. Panusz H.T. Hatch C.L. Bonner W.M. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 20: 201-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) followed by the removal of acetyl groups on the N-terminal tails by histone deacetylases (HDACs) returning chromatin to its condensed structure where accessibility to DNA is restricted (25Wolffe A.P. Pruss D. Cell. 1996; 84: 817-819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar).In this study, we have identified FBR sequences in the human GR gene promoter and examined the roles of GR, CREB, and HDAC-6 in the negative feedback regulation associated with promoter elements of the human GR gene. Because the overexpression of factors involved in regulatory pathways could lead to misinterpretation, we used HeLa-GR stable transfectants and T47D breast cancer cells expressing endogenous GR as the source for nucleosomal DNA in our core experiments. We demonstrate that the enhancer and suppression activities contained within the promoter elements of the GR gene occur through the interaction of GR and the active recruitment of HDAC-6 and phosphorylated CREB (CREB-P) by the ligand-bound GR. We demonstrate here a direct involvement between GR, CREB, and HDAC-6 in the feedback regulation.DISCUSSIONA typical promoter contains regulatory elements to which a number of factors bind. These factors not only regulate transcription and coordinate with the transcriptional machinery but also maintain positive and negative control of gene transcription (8Burke Z.D. Ho M.Y. Morgan H.

Numerous genes contain such elements recognized by receptor as well as nonreceptor factors. Glucocorticoids increase transcription of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene (38Lamers W.H.

Chem. 1993; 268: 5353-5356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Quinn P.G. Granner D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3357-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) to do so. Although acting as suppressor sequences, nGREs are involved in feedback mechanisms in several stress-response systems. GREs can be located as far upstream as 2.5 kb from the transcription start site (41Jantzen H.M. Strähle U. Gloss B. Stewart F. Schmid W. Boshart M. Miksicek R. Schütz G. Cell. 1987; 49: 29-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar) or as close as 395 bp and can span anywhere from 25 to 110 bp (42Imai E. Stromstedt P.E. Quinn P.G. Carlstedt-Duke J. Gustafsson J.A. Granner D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4712-4719Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The CRE in the CRH promoter is 18 bp long, and positive regulation and glucocorticoid repression are located between −232 and −215 bp (43Guardiola-Diaz H.M. Kolinske J.S. Gates L.H. Seasholtz A.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 317-329PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we examined a 3.2-kb region between −1806 and −971 from the Cap site containing two potential nGRE (−1795, −1485) and two potential CRE (−1460, −1073) sites and their role in the regulation of GR gene expression in the presence of glucocorticoids.Our goal was to define the minimal DNA sequence required for glucocorticoid inhibition of the human GR gene. We report here that the functional response of GR gene transcription regulation is located between −1523 and −971, involving both nGREs and CREs in a manner reminiscent of the AVP gene where multiple CREs (9Iwasaki Y. Oiso Y. Saito H. Majzoub J.A. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 5266-5274Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and glucocorticoids (12Kovács K.J. Földes A. Sawchenko P.E. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3843-3852Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) regulate expression in the presence of CREB. As reported in an earlier study, we showed the presence of the FBR element within the −2846 upstream of the GR Cap site of the GR gene promoter (18LeClerc S. Palaniswami R. Xie B.X. Govindan M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17333-17340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results show that this FBR motif is crucial to the negative regulation of the GR gene by glucocorticoids, and thus the separation of two independent responsive elements (44Roesler W.J. Vandenbark G.R. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9657-9664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for two classes of transcription factors allows interactions to take place without mutual hindrance.As gene transcriptional activation and inhibition implicates accessibility of DNA sequences and as eukaryotic chromosomes are compacted together in the form of nucleosomes, alteration of chromatin structure is an important step in gene activation. Acetylation of lysines in target histones, one of the signs of actively transcribed chromatin, and CREB-P recruitment of CBP histone acetyltransferase activity, which relaxes chromatin, indicate a link between GR, CREB, and HDAC-6. We used stable HeLa-GR cells and T47D cells that express endogenous GR to establish which of the GR gene promoter elements was targeted by the ligand-bound GR. Although CREB IgG precipitated CREB from all samples, DEX reduced CREB intensity. Both GR and CREB are DNA-binding proteins, and Western blot analyses with anti-CREB-P demonstrated that GR-DEX bound to the nGRE decreased level of CREB and inhibited cAMP-stimulated CREB-induced transcriptional activation. This is in contrast to the thyroid receptor where association with CREB is increased in the presence of triiodothyronine (45Méndez-Pertuz M. Sánchez-Pacheco A. Aranda A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3102-3112Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 46Sharma D. Fondell J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 7934-7939Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The GR is not only a phosphoprotein (47Bodwell J.E. Ortí E. Coull J.M. Pappin D.J. Smith L.I. Swift F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7549-7555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48Webster J.C.

This would indicate that CREB dephosphorylation is catalyzed by a nuclear protein phosphatase, a process that is dependent on DEX (49Black E.J. Street A.J. Gillespie D.A.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3337-3346Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Several candidate phosphatases, in particular PP2A, are targets of OKA, which leave the CREB-P bound to the CREs (31Wadzinski B.E. Wheat W.H. Jaspers S. Peruski Jr., L.F. Lickteig R.L. Johnson G.L.

Higher levels of cAMP as used in the experiments here abrogate the function of PP2A, allowing an indeterminate quantity of CREB-P bound to the FBR element and GR transcription intact even in the presence of recruited GR·DEX complexes. Among steroid hormone receptors, transcription is regulated through a multitude of pathways. Phosphorylation of the estrogen receptor itself affects its interaction with the CREB-binding protein, CBP, even in the absence of ligand (53Dutertre M. Smith C.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 1296-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and activates transcription through its histone acetyltransferase activity (54Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T.

The phosphorylated form of CREB interacts with CBP and is a co-activator of transcription of cAMP-responsive genes (56Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H.

Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1529-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The level of CREB-P and GR decreased with DEX and increased with either Br-cAMP or OKA alone or in combination. This explains the highest level of transactivation observed with FBR motifs. Data presented here show that the phosphorylation status of CREB defines its recruitment by the GR·DEX complex and that this is one of the major events regulating transcription and GR synthesis. In our study, interaction of CREB with GR was dependent on ligand, whereas binding of CREB to thyroid receptor was not (45Méndez-Pertuz M. Sánchez-Pacheco A. Aranda A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3102-3112Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The GR AF-1 region is involved in contacts with various factors that regulate transcription. Specifically, our data show that GR Ser-203, GR Ser-211, and GR Ser-226 are crucial for CREB and HDAC-6 interaction.Nuclear factor-1 inhibits cAMP-induced transcription from the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene by binding to block CREB access to CBP (61Verbeeck M.A. Adan R.A. Burbach J.P. FEBS Lett. 1990; 272: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The PCR-amplified GR gene promoter elements between −1523 and −971 we used in this study include the same nGRE−1485-cAMP−1461 regulatory motifs separated by 25 bp but exclude the putative nuclear factor-1−1530 recognition motif. Furthermore, we show ligand dependence in transfection assays with this region of the GR gene. We propose that the stimulation of GR gene transcription is due to the inhibition of HDAC-6 catalytic activity recruited by GR-DEX. As the nuclear factor-1 site at −1530 is not part of the region we investigated, it also rules out the direct involvement of nuclear factor-1 in the down-regulation of the GR gene.The mechanism of deacetylases in the transcriptional repression of target genes has only just moved into the spotlight, although it has been known for a while that glucocorticoids repress inflammatory genes such as cytokines (62Levine S.J. Benfield T. Shelhamer J.H. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 15: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and are effective therapy for asthma (63Barnes P.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 940-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Sequence homology and subcellular localization differentiates three classes of HDACs. Numerous reports document class I and class II HDACs and most focus on class I HDAC. Class I HDAC-1–3 and HDAC-8 are ubiquitously expressed and are strictly nuclear (64Kurtev V. Margueron R. Kroboth K. Ogris E. Cavailles V. Seiser C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24834-24843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Class II HDAC-4–7, HDAC-9, and HDAC-10 are tissue-specific, cytoplasmic, and nuclear (65Khochbin S. Verdel A. Lemercier C. Seigneurin B.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). GR inhibits granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor expression by recruiting HDAC-2, which inhibits acetylation of H4K12 by CBP-associated histone acetyltransferase activity (66Ito K. Barnes P.J. Adcock I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6891-6903Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). In interleukin-1β-induced gene expression, the activated GR complex inhibits histone acetylation and recruits HDAC-2 (66Ito K. Barnes P.J. Adcock I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6891-6903Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). Thyroid receptor recruits CBP to trigger histone acetylation (46Sharma D. Fondell J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 7934-7939Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). HDAC-3 forms a complex with SMRT·NCoR (67Guenther M.G. Lane W.S. Fischle W. Verdin E. Lazar M.A. Shiekhattar R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1048-1057PubMed Google Scholar, 68Guenther M.G. Lazar M.A. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 364: 246-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Not much is known about the functional role of HDAC-6. What is clear though is that HDAC-6 forms complexes with other proteins and catalyzes deacetylation of substrates that are involved in neurodegenerative disorders, cell migration associated with actin, and tumor suppression.We confirmed a direct interaction between HDAC-6 and GR with ligand-bound GR by co-immunoprecipitation assays. The inhibitory role of FBR −1523/+8-bound GR-DEX was relieved by TSA confirming that activated GR recruits HDAC-6. We examined the role of HDAC-1–6 in GR-mediated negative regulation and found that although knocking down HDAC-1, HDAC-3, HDAC-4, and HDAC-5 had no effect on transcriptional activation from wild type GR gene promoter, knocking down HDAC-2 or HDAC-6 abolished GR-DEX induction. By further expanding our investigation to include DEX, cAMP, and TSA, we found significant differences that confirmed that it was indeed HDAC-6 and not HDAC-2 that interacted with the GR·DEX complex. Of the HDACs examined, only HDAC-6 has the nuclear receptor signature motif LXXLL. Our deletion mutation analyses provide further confirmation that the LXXLL 313–418 motif in HDAC-6 made contact with the GR·DEX complex. We also provide clear evidence for its role in the regulation of the GR gene by glucocorticoids.As CREB protein decreased and HDAC-6 increased with glucocorticoid treatment, silencing HDAC-6 would disrupt feedback regulation of GR by glucocorticoids. This is further substantiated by the fact that acetylated H3 and H4 proteins are present in immunoblots in TSA-treated T47D cells but are absent in DEX-treated cells. Increased HDAC expression results in the removal of acetyl groups from histones causing compacting of DNA and thereby inhibiting expression of genes that include tumor suppressor genes. Therefore, knowledge of the HDAC-6 mechanism would provide a deeper understanding behind the molecular mechanisms of the evolution of cancer. Fig. 14 summarizes the cellular context of the negative regulation of the GR gene by GR·DEX complexes, where DEX decreases GR mRNA, protein, and CREB phosphorylation suggesting a direct mechanism dependent on the recruitment of a specific cellular phosphatase by the glucocorticoid receptor ligand complexes. IntroductionThe hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is regulated by corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH), 2The abbreviations used are: CRHcorticotrophin-releasing hormoneAF-1activation function 1ChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationCREcAMP-response elementCREBcAMP-response element-binding proteinDEXdexamethasoneBt2-cAMPdibutyryl cAMPGRhuman glucocorticoid receptorGREglucocorticoid-response elementnGREnegative glucocorticoid-response elementGSTglutathione S-transferaseHDAChistone deacetylaseTSAtrichostatinAVParginine vasopressinACTHadrenocorticotropinTKthymidine kinaseRTreverse transcriptionPMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluorideWTwild typeFBSfetal bovine serumDCCdextran charcoal-treated8-Br-cAMP8-bromo-cAMPFBRfeedback regulatoryCREB-Pphosphorylated CREBCBPCREB-binding proteinPIpreimmune IgGOKAokadaic acid. arginine vasopressin (AVP), and glucocorticoids. In response to stress, the neuroendocrine system releases CRH and arginine vasopressin to regulate adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) hormone secretion from the anterior pituitary and glucocorticoids from the adrenal cortex (1Vale W. Spiess J. Rivier C. Rivier J. Science. 1981; 213: 1394-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (3993) Google Scholar, 2Swanson L.W. Sawchenko P.E. Rivier J. Vale W.W. Neuroendocrinology. 1983; 36: 165-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1741) Google Scholar). Increasing levels of circulating glucocorticoids down-regulate the synthesis of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in various tissues (3Schlechte J.A. Ginsberg B.H. Sherman B.M. J. Steroid Biochem. 1982; 16: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) in an endocrine feedback loop and produce inhibitory effects on the secretion of CRH and ACTH (4Jones M.T. Hillhouse E.W. Burden J. J. Endocrinol. 1976; 69: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 5Dallman M.F. Jones M.T. Vernikos-Danellis J. Ganong W.F. Endocrinology. 1972; 91: 961-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) to bring back the system to its resting state. When this balance is perturbed, as in glucocorticoid resistance, the decrease in the negative feedback control of cortisol in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis leads to increased secretion of ACTH and cortisol and resistance to adrenal suppression by DEX (6Chrousos G.P. Vingerhoeds A. Brandon D. Eil C. Pugeat M. DeVroede M. Loriaux D.L. Lipsett M.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1982; 69: 1261-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 7Werner S. Brönnegård M. Steroids. 1996; 61: 216-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The diverse pathway through which glucocorticoids regulate gene transcription is illustrated in reports where glucocorticoids directly affect expression of arginine vasopressin through a glucocorticoid-response element (GRE) (8Burke Z.D. Ho M.Y. Morgan H. Smith M. Murphy D. Carter D. Neuroscience. 1997; 78: 1177-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and negative glucocorticoid-response elements (9Iwasaki Y. Oiso Y. Saito H. Majzoub J.A. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 5266-5274Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 10Schilling K. Schmale H. Oeding P. Pilgrim C. Neuroendocrinology. 1991; 53: 528-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and is a receptor-mediated interaction with nonreceptor factors (11Kuwahara S. Arima H. Banno R. Sato I. Kondo N. Oiso Y. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 10231-10237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Kovács K.J. Földes A. Sawchenko P.E. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3843-3852Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Glucocorticoids inhibit CRH secretion and in doing so inhibit pro-opiomelanocortin synthesis (13Eberwine J.H. Roberts J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2166-2170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the pro-opiomelanocortin nGRE suppresses pro-opiomelanocortin synthesis in a hormone-dependent manner (14Tremblay Y. Tretjakoff I. Peterson A. Antakly T. Zhang C.X. Drouin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1988; 85: 8890-8894Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Like the AVP gene, response to glucocorticoids by the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene involves a functional interaction between the glucocorticoid-response element and cAMP-response element (CRE), which binds the cAMP-response element-binding protein, CREB (15Imai E. Miner J.N. Mitchell J.A. Yamamoto K.R. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5353-5356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite this wealth of information, the precise mechanism of feedback regulation remains elusive.In our previous studies, we demonstrated the negative feedback regulation of the GR gene in Att-20 cells (16Govindan M.V. Pothier F. Leclerc S. Palaniswami R. Xie B. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 40: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In target tissues, biological actions of glucocorticoid hormones are transmitted by the GR. At the cellular level, GR·hormone complexes mediate cell-specific response by binding to specific DNA sequences to modulate the expression of target genes. The human GR gene promoter lacks the classical TATA element, and the authentic GR transcription start site was identified by S1 nuclease mapping (17Leclerc S. Xie B.X. Roy R. Govindan M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8711-8719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18LeClerc S. Palaniswami R. Xie B.X. Govindan M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17333-17340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Perry M. Chalkley R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7336-7347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Pepin M.C. Govindan M.V. Barden N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 1016-1022PubMed Google Scholar). Using extensive biochemical, recombinant, and affinity chromatographic techniques, we have characterized several factors binding to the promoter region of the human GR gene (21Warriar N. Pagé N. Govindan M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18662-18671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We have previously reported the presence of the feedback regulatory (FBR) sequence motif within the −2846 bp (29,335 bp) upstream of the GR cap site (32,181 bp of the GR gene) using S1 nuclease mapping and primer extension (20Pepin M.C. Govindan M.V. Barden N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 1016-1022PubMed Google Scholar). There are several regulatory sequences within this region as follows: at least two nGRE motifs at −1796 and −1485 and potential cAMP motifs at −1460 and −1073.The GR is down-regulated by its ligand in a mechanism of negative feedback regulation of its mRNA. Upon translocation to the nucleus, the GR·hormone complex binds to specific DNA sequences (22Govindan M.V. Exp. Cell Res. 1980; 127: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In the nucleus, however, eukaryotic chromosomes are compacted together, and most DNA sequences are inaccessible to transcription factors. Alteration in chromatin structure modulates the accessibility of regulatory sites to DNA-binding proteins. The core of the nucleosome, the basic subunit of chromatin, consists of an octamer of two copies each of four core histones as follows: an H3-H4 tetramer and dimers of H2A-H2B around which 147 bp of DNA are wound (23Kornberg R.D. Science. 1974; 184: 868-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (1616) Google Scholar). This core is hydrophobic and conceals the C-terminal regions of the histones, whereas the N-terminal tails with highly conserved lysines protrude. Acetylation of these lysines is one of the first steps of actively transcribed chromatin (24Wu R.S. Panusz H.T. Hatch C.L. Bonner W.M. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 20: 201-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) followed by the removal of acetyl groups on the N-terminal tails by histone deacetylases (HDACs) returning chromatin to its condensed structure where accessibility to DNA is restricted (25Wolffe A.P. Pruss D. Cell. 1996; 84: 817-819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar).In this study, we have identified FBR sequences in the human GR gene promoter and examined the roles of GR, CREB, and HDAC-6 in the negative feedback regulation associated with promoter elements of the human GR gene. Because the overexpression of factors involved in regulatory pathways could lead to misinterpretation, we used HeLa-GR stable transfectants and T47D breast cancer cells expressing endogenous GR as the source for nucleosomal DNA in our core experiments. We demonstrate that the enhancer and suppression activities contained within the promoter elements of the GR gene occur through the interaction of GR and the active recruitment of HDAC-6 and phosphorylated CREB (CREB-P) by the ligand-bound GR. We demonstrate here a direct involvement between GR, CREB, and HDAC-6 in the feedback regulation."

https://openalex.org/W2056813312,"Noc1p, Noc3p and Noc4p are eukaryotic proteins which play essential roles in yeast ribosome biogenesis and contain a homologous stretch of about 45 aminoacids (Noc-domain) of unknown function. Yeast Noc4p is a component of the small ribosomal subunit (SSU) processome, can be isolated as a stable Noc4p-Nop14p SSU-processome submodule from yeast cells, and is required for nuclear steps of small ribosomal subunit rRNA maturation. We expressed a series of mutated alleles of NOC4 in yeast cells and analysed whether the corresponding protein variants support vegetative growth, interact with Nop14p, and are incorporated into the SSU-processome. The data reveal that the essential C-terminus of Noc4p which contains 237 aminoacids including the Noc-domain represents a protein-protein interaction module. It is required and sufficient for its association with Nop14p and several nuclear precursors of the small ribosomal subunit. The N-terminal Noc4-part seems to be targeted to pre-ribosomes via the C-terminus of Noc4p and plays there an essential role in SSU-processome function. Replacement of the Noc4p-Noc-domain by its homologues Noc1p-counterpart results in a hybrid Noc4p variant which fails to associate with Nop14p and pre-ribosomes. On the other hand, exchange of 6 amino acids in the Noc1-Noc-domain of this hybrid Noc4p protein is sufficient to restore its essential in vivo functions. These data suggest that Noc-domains of Noc1p and Noc4p share a common structural backbone in which diverging amino acids play crucial roles in mediating specific regulated interactions. Our analysis allows us to distinguish between different functions of certain domains within Noc4p and contribute to the understanding of how incorporation of Noc4p into ribosomal precursors is coupled to rRNA processing and maturation of the small ribosomal subunit."

https://openalex.org/W2014924335,"During the previous century Norway had a high incidence of tuberculosis, but no molecular epidemiological studies could be performed and these previously epidemic strains have been disappearing during the last decades. Currently, tuberculosis among native Norwegians is in the elimination phase, and it is still not known what type of M. tuberculosis was so efficiently controlled during the second half of the 20th century. However, many elderly Norwegian-born people still develop TB that cannot be clustered to imported or recently transmitted strains of M. tuberculosis. Thus, the majority of these cases are results of reactivation of disease that was transmitted many decades ago.A total of 213 strains of M. tuberculosis isolated during 1998-2005, from patients born in Norway before 1950 were genotyped in the current study. The findings demonstrated a highly homogenous M. tuberculosis population among the patients. A total of 40% belonged to the T-family, were 35% were assigned to T1 sub- family (T2 = 0, 93%, T3 = 1, 4% and T4 = 2, 3%). As many as 35% of the isolates belonged to the Haarlem family, were 15% were assigned to Haarlem1 and 19% to Haarlem3. The remaining 25% belonged to 15 different other families. The RFLP-patterns indicated that the isolates were not a result of recent transmission, but rather represented well established strains that apparently dominated in Norway many decades ago.The T 1, Haarlem 1, and Haarlem 3 families of M. tuberculosis were abundant among patients born in Norway before 1950. The M. tuberculosis cases represented reactivated disease that had been acquired before 1994 and were likely to have been latent for several decades. Thus, the current study indicated that the T 1, Haarlem 1, and Haarlem 3 families may have been common in Norway, when tuberculosis represented a serious public health threat during the first half of the 20th century."
https://openalex.org/W2131372661,"Background Attrition of students from aviation training is a serious financial and operational concern for the U.S. Navy. Each late stage navy aviator training failure costs the taxpayer over $1,000,000 and ultimately results in decreased operational readiness of the fleet. Currently, potential aviators are selected based on the Aviation Selection Test Battery (ASTB), which is a series of multiple-choice tests that evaluate basic and aviation-related knowledge and ability. However, the ASTB does not evaluate a person's response to stress. This is important because operating sophisticated aircraft demands exceptional performance and causes high psychological stress. Some people are more resistant to this type of stress, and consequently better able to cope with the demands of naval aviation, than others. Methodology/Principal Findings Although many psychological studies have examined psychological stress resistance none have taken advantage of the human genome sequence. Here we use high-throughput -omic biology methods and a novel statistical data normalization method to identify plasma proteins associated with human performance under psychological stress. We identified proteins involved in four basic physiological processes: innate immunity, cardiac function, coagulation and plasma lipid physiology. Conclusions/Significance The proteins identified here further elucidate the physiological response to psychological stress and suggest a hypothesis that stress-susceptible pilots may be more prone to shock. This work also provides potential biomarkers for screening humans for capability of superior performance under stress."
https://openalex.org/W2084113265,"Background Motion-defined form can seem to persist briefly after motion ceases, before seeming to gradually disappear into the background. Here we investigate if this subjective persistence reflects a signal capable of improving objective measures of sensitivity to static form. Methodology/Principal Findings We presented a sinusoidal modulation of luminance, masked by a background noise pattern. The sinusoidal luminance modulation was usually subjectively invisible when static, but visible when moving. We found that drifting then stopping the waveform resulted in a transient subjective persistence of the waveform in the static display. Observers' objective sensitivity to the position of the static waveform was also improved after viewing moving waveforms, compared to viewing static waveforms for a matched duration. This facilitation did not occur simply because movement provided more perspectives of the waveform, since performance following pre-exposure to scrambled animations did not match that following pre-exposure to smooth motion. Observers did not simply remember waveform positions at motion offset, since removing the waveform before testing reduced performance. Conclusions/Significance Motion processing therefore interacts with subsequent static visual inputs in a way that can improve performance in objective sensitivity measures. We suggest that the brief subjective persistence of motion-defined forms that can occur after motion offsets is a consequence of the decay of a static form signal that has been transiently enhanced by motion processing."
https://openalex.org/W2039315274,"The Ste20/PAK family is involved in many cellular processes, including the regulation of actin-based cytoskeletal dynamics and the activation of MAPK signaling pathways. Despite its numerous roles, few of its substrates have been identified. To better characterize the roles of the yeast Ste20p kinase, we developed an in vitro biochemical genomics screen to identify its substrates. When applied to 539 purified yeast proteins, the screen reported 14 targets of Ste20p phosphorylation. We used the data resulting from our screen to build an in silico predictor to identify Ste20p substrates on a proteome-wide basis. Since kinase-substrate specificity is often mediated by additional binding events at sites distal to the phosphorylation site, the predictor uses the presence/absence of multiple sequence motifs to evaluate potential substrates. Statistical validation estimates a threefold improvement in substrate recovery over random predictions, despite the lack of a single dominant motif that can characterize Ste20p phosphorylation. The set of predicted substrates significantly overrepresents elements of the genetic and physical interaction networks surrounding Ste20p, suggesting that some of the predicted substrates are in vivo targets. We validated this combined experimental and computational approach for identifying kinase substrates by confirming the in vitro phosphorylation of polarisome components Bni1p and Bud6p, thus suggesting a mechanism by which Ste20p effects polarized growth."
