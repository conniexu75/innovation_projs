https://openalex.org/W2996481730,"Dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) regulate reward association and motivation. It remains unclear whether there are distinct dopamine populations to mediate these functions. Using mouse genetics, we isolated two populations of dopamine-producing VTA neurons with divergent projections to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core and shell. Inhibition of VTA-core-projecting neurons disrupted Pavlovian reward learning, and activation of these cells promoted the acquisition of an instrumental response. VTA-shell-projecting neurons did not regulate Pavlovian reward learning and could not facilitate acquisition of an instrumental response, but their activation could drive robust responding in a previously learned instrumental task. Both populations are activated simultaneously by cues, actions, and rewards, and this co-activation is required for robust reinforcement of behavior. Thus, there are functionally distinct dopamine populations in the VTA for promoting motivation and reward association, which operate on the same timescale to optimize behavioral reinforcement."
https://openalex.org/W2997500980,"Introduction Pharmacists are uniquely placed in the community to be of assistance to disaster-affected patients. However, the roles undertaken by pharmacists in disasters are identified based on their own experiences and networks. There is currently no definition or acknowledgment of pharmacists’ roles in disasters. Objective To acquire consensus from an expert panel of key opinion leaders within the field of disaster health on pharmacists’ roles in disasters throughout the four disaster phases—prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery. Methods A Delphi study consisting of three rounds of online surveys was utilised. Twenty-four key opinion leaders were contacted, with 15 completing all three rounds. The 15 expert panellists were presented with 46 roles identified in the literature and asked to rank their opinions on a 5-point Likert scale. This study used an international, all-hazard, and multijurisdictional approach. Consensus was benchmarked at 80% and any role which did not reach consensus was re-queried in the subsequent round. The third round provided the results of the Delphi study and sought commentary on the acceptance or rejection of the roles. Results Of the 46 roles provided to the expert panel, 43 roles were accepted as roles pharmacists are capable of undertaking in a disaster. There were five roles for the prevention phase, nine for the preparedness phase, 21 for the response phase, and eight for the recovery phase. The experts were asked to prioritise the top five roles for each of the disaster phases. The three roles which did not make consensus were deemed to be specialised roles for disaster pharmacists and not generalisable to the broader pharmacy profession. Conclusion This study identifies pharmacists’ roles in disasters which have been accepted by the international disaster health community. The international key opinion leaders recommended that pharmacists could be undertaking 43 roles in a disaster, however, this is dependent on individual jurisdiction considerations. Pharmacy professional associations need to advocate to policymakers for legislative support and to ensure pharmacists are equipped with the training and education required to undertake these roles within specific jurisdictions."
https://openalex.org/W2998618511,"Among women, breast cancer is a leading cause of death. Breast cancer risk predictions can inform screening and preventative actions. Previous works found that adding inputs to the widely-used Gail model improved its ability to predict breast cancer risk. However, these models used simple statistical architectures and the additional inputs were derived from costly and / or invasive procedures. By contrast, we developed machine learning models that used highly accessible personal health data to predict five-year breast cancer risk. We created machine learning models using only the Gail model inputs and models using both Gail model inputs and additional personal health data relevant to breast cancer risk. For both sets of inputs, six machine learning models were trained and evaluated on the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial data set. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve metric quantified each model’s performance. Since this data set has a small percentage of positive breast cancer cases, we also reported sensitivity, specificity, and precision. We used Delong tests (p < 0.05) to compare the testing data set performance of each machine learning model to that of the Breast Cancer Risk Prediction Tool (BCRAT), an implementation of the Gail model. None of the machine learning models with only BCRAT inputs were significantly stronger than the BCRAT. However, the logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, and neural network models with the broader set of inputs were all significantly stronger than the BCRAT. These results suggest that relative to the BCRAT, additional easy-to-obtain personal health inputs can improve five-year breast cancer risk prediction. Our models could be used as non-invasive and cost-effective risk stratification tools to increase early breast cancer detection and prevention, motivating both immediate actions like screening and long-term preventative measures such as hormone replacement therapy and chemoprevention."
https://openalex.org/W2997458830,"Background and objective Most previous studies adopted single traditional time series models to predict incidences of malaria. A single model cannot effectively capture all the properties of the data structure. However, a stacking architecture can solve this problem by combining distinct algorithms and models. This study compares the performance of traditional time series models and deep learning algorithms in malaria case prediction and explores the application value of stacking methods in the field of infectious disease prediction. Methods The ARIMA, STL+ARIMA, BP-ANN and LSTM network models were separately applied in simulations using malaria data and meteorological data in Yunnan Province from 2011 to 2017. We compared the predictive performance of each model through evaluation measures: RMSE, MASE, MAD. In addition, gradient-boosting regression trees (GBRTs) were used to combine the above four models. We also determined whether stacking structure improved the model prediction performance. Results The root mean square errors (RMSEs) of the four sub-models were 13.176, 14.543, 9.571 and 7.208; the mean absolute scaled errors (MASEs) were 0.469, 0.472, 0.296 and 0.266 and the mean absolute deviation (MAD) were 6.403, 7.658, 5.871 and 5.691. After using the stacking architecture combined with the above four models, the RMSE, MASE and MAD values of the ensemble model decreased to 6.810, 0.224 and 4.625, respectively. Conclusions A novel ensemble model based on the robustness of structured prediction and model combination through stacking was developed. The findings suggest that the predictive performance of the final model is superior to that of the other four sub-models, indicating that stacking architecture may have significant implications in infectious disease prediction."
https://openalex.org/W2997147765,"Posterior root-muscle (PRM) reflexes are short-latency spinal reflexes evoked by epidural or transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (SCS) in clinical and physiological studies. PRM reflexes share key physiological characteristics with the H reflex elicited by electrical stimulation of large-diameter muscle spindle afferents in the tibial nerve. Here, we compared the H reflex and the PRM reflex of soleus in response to transcutaneous stimulation by studying their recovery cycles in ten neurologically intact volunteers and ten individuals with traumatic, chronic spinal cord injury (SCI). The recovery cycles of the reflexes, i.e., the time course of their excitability changes, were assessed by paired pulses with conditioning-test intervals of 20–5000 ms. Between the subject groups, no statistical difference was found for the recovery cycles of the H reflexes, yet those of the PRM reflexes differed significantly, with a striking suppression in the intact group. When comparing the reflex types, they did not differ in the SCI group, while the PRM reflexes were more strongly depressed in the intact group for durations characteristic for presynaptic inhibition. These differences may arise from the concomitant stimulation of several posterior roots containing afferent fibers of various lower extremity nerves by transcutaneous SCS, producing multi-source heteronymous presynaptic inhibition, and the collective dysfunction of inhibitory mechanisms after SCI contributing to spasticity. PRM-reflex recovery cycles additionally obtained for bilateral rectus femoris, biceps femoris, tibialis anterior, and soleus all demonstrated a stronger suppression in the intact group. Within both subject groups, the thigh muscles showed a stronger recovery than the lower leg muscles, which may reflect a characteristic difference in motor control of diverse muscles. Based on the substantial difference between intact and SCI individuals, PRM-reflex depression tested with paired pulses could become a sensitive measure for spasticity and motor recovery."
https://openalex.org/W2998532630,"Dengue and dengue hemorrhagic pose significant burdens in many tropical countries. Dengue incidences have perpetually increased, leading to an annual (uncertain) peak. Dengue cases cause an enormous public health problem in Thailand because there is no anti-viral drug against the dengue virus. Searching for means to reduce the dengue incidences is a challenging and appropriate strategy for primary prevention in a dengue outbreak. This study constructs the best predictive model from past statistical dengue incidences at the provincial level and studies the relationships among dengue incidences and weather variables. We conducted experiments for 65 provinces (out of 77 provinces) in Thailand since there is no dengue information for the remaining provinces. Predictive models were constructed using weekly data during 2001-2014. The training set are data during 2001-2013, and the test set is the data from 2014. Collected data were separated into two parts: current dengue cases as the dependent variable, and weather variables and previous dengue cases as the independent variables. Eight weather variables are used in our models: average pressure, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, average humidity, precipitation, vaporization, wind direction, wind power. Each weather variable includes the current week and one to three weeks of lag time. A total of 32 independent weather variables are used for each province. The previous one to three weeks of dengue cases are also used as independent variables. There is a total of 35 independent variables. Predictive models were constructed using five methods: Poisson regression, negative binomial regression, quasi-likelihood regression, ARIMA(3,1,4) and SARIMA(2,0,1)(0,2,0). The best model is determined by combinations of 1–12 variables, which are 232,989,800 models for each province. We construct a total of 15,144,337,000 models. The best model is selected by the average from high to low of the coefficient of determination (R2) and the lowest root mean square error (RMSE). From our results, the one-week lag previous case variable is the most frequent in 55 provinces out of a total of 65 provinces (coefficient of determinations with a minimum of 0.257 and a maximum of 0.954, average of 0.6383, 95% CI: 0.57313 to 0.70355). The most influential weather variable is precipitation, which is used in most of the provinces, followed by wind direction, wind power, and barometric pressure. The results confirm the common knowledge that dengue incidences occur most often during the rainy season. It also shows that wind direction, wind power, and barometric pressure also have influences on the number of dengue cases. These three weather variables may help adult mosquitos to survive longer and spread dengue. In conclusion, The most influential factor for further cases is the number of dengue cases. However, weather variables are also needed to obtain better results. Predictions of the number of dengue cases should be done locally, not at the national level. The best models of different provinces use different sets of weather variables. Our model has an accuracy that is sufficient for the real prediction of future dengue incidences, to prepare for and protect against severe dengue outbreaks."
https://openalex.org/W2997058777,"Study objectives Normal timing and duration of sleep is vital for all physical and mental health. However, many sleep-related studies depend on self-reported sleep measurements, which have limitations. This study aims to investigate the association of physical activity and sociodemographic characteristics including age, gender, coffee intake and social status with objective sleep measurements. Methods A cross-sectional analysis was carried out on 82995 participants within the UK Biobank cohort. Sociodemographic and lifestyle information were collected through touch-screen questionnaires in 2007–2010. Sleep and physical activity parameters were later measured objectively using wrist-worn accelerometers in 2013–2015 (participants were aged 43–79 years and wore watches for 7 days). Participants were divided into 5 groups based on their objective sleep duration per night (<5 hours, 5–6 hours, 6–7 hours, 7–8 hours and >8 hours). Binary logistic models were adjusted for age, gender and Townsend Deprivation Index. Results Participants who slept 6–7 hours/night were the most frequent (33.5%). Females had longer objective sleep duration than males. Short objective sleep duration (<6 hours) correlated with older age, social deprivation and high coffee intake. Finally, those who slept 6–7 hours/night were most physically active. Conclusions Objectively determined short sleep duration was associated with male gender, older age, low social status and high coffee intake. An inverse ‘U-shaped’ relationship between sleep duration and physical activity was also established. Optimal sleep duration for health in those over 60 may therefore be shorter than younger groups."
https://openalex.org/W2996986337,"Background Although walking speed is associated with important clinical outcomes and designated as the sixth vital sign of the elderly, few walking-speed estimation algorithms using an inertial measurement unit (IMU) have been derived and tested in the older adults, especially in the elderly with slow speed. We aimed to develop a walking-speed estimation algorithm for older adults based on an IMU. Methods We used data from 659 of 785 elderly enrolled from the cohort study. We measured gait using an IMU attached on the lower back while participants walked around a 28 m long round walkway thrice at comfortable paces. Best-fit linear regression models were developed using selected demographic, anthropometric, and IMU features to estimate the walking speed. The accuracy of the algorithm was verified using mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) in an independent validation set. Additionally, we verified concurrent validity with GAITRite using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Results The proposed algorithm incorporates the age, sex, foot length, vertical displacement, cadence, and step-time variability obtained from an IMU sensor. It exhibited high estimation accuracy for the walking speed of the elderly and remarkable concurrent validity compared to the GAITRite (MAE = 4.70%, RMSE = 6.81 𝑐𝑚/𝑠, concurrent validity (ICC (3,1)) = 0.937). Moreover, it achieved high estimation accuracy even for slow walking by applying a slow-speed-specific regression model sequentially after estimation by a general regression model. The accuracy was higher than those obtained with models based on the human gait model with or without calibration to fit the population. Conclusions The developed inertial-sensor-based walking-speed estimation algorithm can accurately estimate the walking speed of older adults."
https://openalex.org/W2997863849,"The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by cisplatin is one of the major mechanisms of cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity. We examined the preventive effect of α-lipoic acid (LA) on cisplatin-induced toxicity via its antioxidant effects on in vitro and ex vivo culture systems. To elucidate the mechanism of the antioxidant activity of LA, NRF2 was inhibited using NRF2 siRNA, and the change in antioxidant activity of LA was characterized. MTT assays showed that LA was safe at concentrations up to 0.5 mM in HEI-OC1 cells and had a protective effect against cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity. Intracellular ROS production in HEI-OC1 cells was rapidly increased by cisplatin for up to 48 h. However, treatment with LA significantly reduced the production of ROS and increased the expression of the antioxidant proteins HO-1 and SOD1. Ex vivo, the organs of Corti of the group pretreated with LA exhibited better preservation than the group that received cisplatin alone. We also confirmed the nuclear translocation of NRF2 after LA administration, and that NRF2 inhibition decreased the antioxidant activity of LA. Together, these results indicate that the antioxidant activity of LA was through the activation of the NRF2/HO-1 antioxidant pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2998087232,"Wastewater treatment plant effluents are important point sources of micropollutants. To assess how the discharge of treated wastewater affects the ecotoxicity of small to medium-sized streams we collected water samples up- and downstream of 24 wastewater treatment plants across the Swiss Plateau and the Jura regions of Switzerland. We investigated estrogenicity, inhibition of algal photosynthetic activity (photosystem II, PSII) and growth, and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition. At four sites, we measured feeding activity of amphipods (Gammarus fossarum) in situ as well as water flea (Ceriodaphnia dubia) reproduction in water samples. Ecotoxicological endpoints were compared with results from analyses of general water quality parameters as well as a target screening of a wide range of organic micropollutants with a focus on pesticides and pharmaceuticals using liquid chromatography high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry. Measured ecotoxicological effects in stream water varied substantially among sites: 17β-estradiol equivalent concentrations (EEQbio, indicating the degree of estrogenicity) were relatively low and ranged from 0.04 to 0.85 ng/L, never exceeding a proposed effect-based trigger (EBT) value of 0.88 ng/L. Diuron equivalent (DEQbio) concentrations (indicating the degree of photosystem II inhibition in algae) ranged from 2.4 to 1576 ng/L and exceeded the EBT value (70 ng/L) in one third of the rivers studied, sometimes even upstream of the WWTP. Parathion equivalent (PtEQbio) concentrations (indicating the degree of AChE inhibition) reached relatively high values (37 to 1278 ng/L) mostly exceeding the corresponding EBT (196 ng/L PtEQbio). Decreased feeding activity by amphipods or decreased water flea reproduction downstream compared to the upstream site was observed at one of four investigated sites only. Results of the combined algae assay (PSII inhibition) correlated best with results of chemical analysis for PSII inhibiting herbicides. Estrogenicity was partly and AChE inhibition strongly underestimated based on measured steroidal estrogens respectively organophosphate and carbamate insecticides. An impact of dissolved organic carbon on results of the AChE inhibition assay was obvious. For this assay more work is required to further explore the missing correlation of bioassay data with chemical analytical data. Overall, the discharge of WWTP effluent led to increased estrogenicity, PSII and AChE inhibition downstream, irrespective of upstream land use."
https://openalex.org/W2996762376,"Glioma is recognized to be a highly heterogeneous CNS malignancy, whose diverse cellular composition and cellular interactions have not been well characterized. To gain new clinical- and biological-insights into the genetically-bifurcated IDH1 mutant (mt) vs wildtype (wt) forms of glioma, we integrated data from protein, genomic and MR imaging from 20 treatment-naïve glioma cases and 16 recurrent GBM cases. Multiplexed immunofluorescence (MxIF) was used to generate single cell data for 43 protein markers representing all cancer hallmarks, Genomic sequencing (exome and RNA (normal and tumor) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) quantitative features (protocols were T1-post, FLAIR and ADC) from whole tumor, peritumoral edema and enhancing core vs equivalent normal region were also collected from patients. Based on MxIF analysis, 85,767 cells (glioma cases) and 56,304 cells (GBM cases) were used to generate cell-level data for 24 biomarkers. K-means clustering was used to generate 7 distinct groups of cells with divergent biomarker profiles and deconvolution was used to assign RNA data into three classes. Spatial and molecular heterogeneity metrics were generated for the cell data. All features were compared between IDH mt and IDHwt patients and were finally combined to provide a holistic/integrated comparison. Protein expression by hallmark was generally lower in the IDHmt vs wt patients. Molecular and spatial heterogeneity scores for angiogenesis and cell invasion also differed between IDHmt and wt gliomas irrespective of prior treatment and tumor grade; these differences also persisted in the MR imaging features of peritumoral edema and contrast enhancement volumes. A coherent picture of enhanced angiogenesis in IDHwt tumors was derived from multiple platforms (genomic, proteomic and imaging) and scales from individual proteins to cell clusters and heterogeneity, as well as bulk tumor RNA and imaging features. Longer overall survival for IDH1mt glioma patients may reflect mutation-driven alterations in cellular, molecular, and spatial heterogeneity which manifest in discernable radiological manifestations."
https://openalex.org/W2996984325,"Carcinoma cells often modulate coagulation and fibrinolysis among cancer patients. Plasma dimerized plasmin fragment D (D-dimer) has been reported as a prognostic marker of various types of malignancies, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the associations between the plasma D-dimer level and peripheral small NSCLC remain unclear.Three hundred and sixty-two patients with NSCLC who underwent radical surgery were retrospectively reviewed. Patients who received anticoagulation therapy before surgery or who lacked preoperative D-dimer data were excluded. The other 235 patients were divided into a high D-dimer (over 1.0 μg/mL) group (HDD group, n = 47) and a normal D-dimer group (NDD group, n = 188) and investigated for their clinical characteristics, computed tomography (CT) findings, pathological findings, and clinical outcomes.The mean D-dimer levels was 2.49±2.58 μg/ml in the HDD group and 0.42±0.23 μg/ml in the NDD group. The HDD group was characterized by a predominance of male gender, older age, pure solid appearance on chest CT, vascular invasion in pathology, and a large solid part of the tumor. The HDD group showed a worse overall survival, disease-free survival, and disease-specific survival than the NDD group (p<0.001, <0.001, <0.001, respectively). These survival features were also observed in p-Stage IA disease. There was no marked survival difference when tumors showed ground-glass opacity on CT.In NSCLC patients with a solid tumor appearance on CT, high D-dimer levels predict a poor survival and early recurrence."
https://openalex.org/W2998091202,"Amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques aggregation is considered as the “start” of the degenerative process that manifests years before the clinical symptoms appear in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). The aim of this study is to use back propagation neural networks (BPNNs) in 18F-florbetapir PET data for automated classification of four patient groups including AD, late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI), early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI), and significant memory concern (SMC), versus normal control (NC) for early AD detection. Five hundred images for AD, LMCI, EMCI, SMC, and NC, i.e., 100 images for each group, were used from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. The results showed that the automated classification of NC/AD produced a high accuracy of 87.9%, while the results for the prodromal stages of the disease were 66.4%, 60.0%, and 52.9% for NC/LCMI, NC/EMCI and NC/SMC, respectively. The proposed method together with the image preparation steps can be used for early AD detection and classification with high accuracy using Aβ PET dataset."
https://openalex.org/W2990349082,"This study examines the relationship between experiencing intimate partner violence (IPV), exposure to prior childhood adversity, lifetime adverse experiences, drug-related relationship dependencies with intimate partners and overdose, hospitalization for drug use, friends and family members who overdosed and witnessing overdose.This paper included a sample of 201 women who use drugs in heterosexual relationships with criminal justice-involved men in New York City. We included measures of experiencing overdose, hospitalization for drug use, witnessing overdose, and having friends and family who overdosed. Intimate partner violence consisted of either 1) none/verbal only, 2) moderate and 3) severe abuse. Dichotomous indicators of drug-related relationship dependencies included financial support, drug procurement, splitting and pooling drugs. A scale measured cumulative exposure to childhood adversity and lifetime exposures to adverse events. This paper hypothesized that experiencing moderate and severe IPV, drug-related dependencies and exposure to prior childhood and lifetime adversity would be associated with a greater risk of experiencing overdose, hospitalization for drug use, witnessing overdose and having friends and family members who overdosed. Generalized linear modeling with robust variance estimated relative risk ratios that accounted for potential bias in confidence intervals and adjusted for race, ethnicity, education and marital status.We found experiencing moderate or severe IPV was associated with ever being hospitalized for drug use and having a family member who experienced overdose. Experiencing moderate IPV was associated with increased risk of witnessing overdose, Partner drug dependencies were associated with overdose, ever being hospitalized for drug use, witnessing overdose, and having a family member or friend who experienced overdose. Childhood and lifetime adversity exposures were significantly associated with increased risk of overdose, ever being hospitalized for drug use, ever witnessing overdose and having a friend and family member who overdosed.Findings underscore the intersection of experiencing IPV and drug-related relationship dependencies, childhood adversity and lifetime adversity in shaping experiences of and witnessing overdose among women who use drugs. They highlight the urgent need to address IPV, adversity experiences and drug-related relationship dependencies in overdose prevention for women who use drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2997278433,"For psoriatic patients receiving biologics, the concern of tuberculosis (TB) infection exists. Although the TB risk of anti-interleukin (IL)-17A agents is generally considered very low, more real-world data are needed to support the safety.This study aims to provide the real-world experience of using serial QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT) test among patients treated with secukinumab or ixekizumab in Taiwan, an intermediate TB burden country, for the detection of latent TB infection (LTBI) reactivation or newly acquired TB infection.This retrospective review evaluated 100 consecutive patients with psoriasis receiving anti-IL-17A therapies who were checked with at least twice QFT-GIT between 2016 and 2019 in National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei and Hsin-Chu, Taiwan.Among the 100 patients, the baseline QFT-GIT results were negative in 81.0% (81/100), positive in 18.0% (18/100), and indeterminate in 1.0% (1/100) of patients. The overall outcomes in patients receiving at least 6 months of cumulative exposure to anti-IL-17A agents were persistently seronegative in 80 patients (80.0%), persistently seropositive in 14 patients (14.0%), seroconversion in 1 patient (1.0%), seroreversion in 3 patients (3.0%), and others in 2 patients (2.0%). In patients with at least 11 months of cumulative exposure, the seroconversion rate was 1.3% (1/79). The only case with seroconversion had a positive QFT-GIT result previously. No case of TB reactivation or newly acquired TB infection was identified during the follow-up.In patients treated with anti-IL-17A monoclonal antibodies for psoriasis, routine serial repeat QFT-GIT testing was associated with lower seroconversion rate compared to real-world data of tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors and anti-IL-12/23 antibody in Taiwan and in pivotal studies. Because clinical TB symptoms and signs are often preceded by QFT-GIF seroconversion, this result further supports the safety of anti-IL-17A agents in patients with psoriasis for LTBI."
https://openalex.org/W2998177710,"External structures of insects contribute to the ability of herbivores to select and feed on their host plants. The invasive spotted lanternfly, Lycorma delicatula (Hemiptera: Fulgoridae) is an economically important and polyphagous insect pest in the eastern US. The lanternfly causes substantial damage to many woody plants by sucking phloem sap, reducing photosynthesis, causing weeping wounds, and creating conditions for sooty mold. Lanternfly nymphs switch host plants during their development. However, little is known about relationship between the lanternfly and its plant hosts, and particularly about morphological adaptations of the lanternfly to host plant usage at each developmental stage of the pest. In this study, we focused on assessing changes in morphology of (a) the lanternfly mouthparts (stylets and labium), and (b) the lanternfly tarsal tips (arolia and tarsal claws) at each developmental stage. Our study revealed several developmental patterns among which the presence of the indentations on mandibular stylets in late instars and adults, as well as the exponential growth of the labium and stylet length, and the tarsal claw dispersal during the lanternfly development. Our findings are critical for investigating and predicting the lanternfly host range, and the lanternfly dispersal to new host trees at each developmental stage."
https://openalex.org/W2998722192,"Since the mid-20th century, crop breeding has driven unprecedented yield gains. Breeders generally select for broadly- and reliably-performing varieties that display little genotype-by-environment interaction (GxE). In contrast, ecological theory predicts that across environments that vary spatially or temporally, the most productive population will be a mixture of narrowly adapted specialists. We quantified patterns of broad and narrow adaptation in modern, commercial maize (Zea mays L.) hybrids planted across 216 site-years, from 1999-2018, for the University of Illinois yield trials. We found that location was the dominant source of yield variation (44.5%), and yearly weather was the smallest (1.7%), which suggested a benefit for reliable performance in narrow biophysical environments. Varieties displayed a large ""home field advantage"" when growing in the location of best performance relative to other varieties. Home field advantage accounted for 19% of GxE and provided a yield increase of 1.01 ± 0.04 Mg ∙ ha-1 (7.6% relative to mean yield), yet was both smaller than predicted by a null model and unchanged across time. This counterfactual suggests that commercial breeding programs have missed an opportunity to further increase yields by leveraging local adaptation. Public breeding programs may pursue this opportunity by releasing specialist varieties that perform reliably in narrow environments. As seed sources are increasingly privatized and consolidated, this alternate strategy may compliment private breeding to support global food security."
https://openalex.org/W2997111176,"The forest floor of boreal forest stores large amounts of organic C that may react to a warming climate and increased N deposition. It is therefore crucial to assess the impact of these factors on the temperature sensitivity of this C pool to help predict future soil CO2 emissions from boreal forest soils to the atmosphere. In this study, soil warming (+2-4°C) and canopy N addition (CNA; +0.30-0.35 kg·N·ha-1·yr-1) were replicated along a topographic gradient (upper, back and lower slope) in a boreal forest in Quebec, Canada. After nine years of treatment, the forest floor was collected in each plot, and its organic C composition was characterized through solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Forest floor samples were incubated at four temperatures (16, 24, 32 and 40°C) and respiration rates (RR) measured to assess the temperature sensitivity of forest floor RR (Q10 = e10k) and basal RR (B). Both soil warming and CNA had no significant effect on forest floor chemistry (e.g., C, N, Ca and Mg content, amount of soil organic matter, pH, chemical functional groups). The NMR analyses did not show evidence of significant changes in the forest floor organic C quality. Nonetheless, a significant effect of soil warming on both the Q10 of RR and B was observed. On average, B was 72% lower and Q10 45% higher in the warmed, versus the control plots. This result implies that forest floor respiration will more strongly react to changes in soil temperature in a future warmer climate. CNA had no significant effect on the measured soil and respiration parameters, and no interaction effects with warming. In contrast, slope position had a significant effect on forest floor organic C quality. Upper slope plots had higher soil alkyl C:O-alkyl C ratios and lower B values than those in the lower slope, across all different treatments. This result likely resulted from a relative decrease in the labile C fraction in the upper slope, characterized by lower moisture levels. Our results point towards higher temperature sensitivity of RR under warmer conditions, accompanied by an overall down-regulation of RR at low temperatures (lower B). Since soil C quantity and quality were unaffected by the nine years of warming, the observed patterns could result from microbial adaptations to warming."
https://openalex.org/W2997729345,"Background In Ethiopia, visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is caused by Leishmania donovani. The estimated country-wide incidence of VL in Ethiopia is 3700–7400 cases/year. The balance between anthroponotic and zoonotic transmission is still unknown even though most authors believe that visceral leishmaniasis in East Africa is anthroponotic. Asymptomatic leishmania infections occur more frequently than clinically apparent visceral leishmaniasis cases. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of asymptomatic VL infection and assess the degree of exposure among residents in Raya Azebo Woreda villages where cases of VL were recently reported. Methods A community based cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2013 between 1st of May and 25th of July. A total of 1099 individuals living in 314 households were included in the study. Socio-demographic and clinical data were collected from each of the participants and venous blood was also collected for the detection of antibodies to visceral leishmaniasis using Direct Agglutination Test. Leishmanin skin test was performed to detect the exposure to the parasite. Data was entered into excel and exported to SPSS version 17 for statistical analysis. Chi-square and the corresponding p-values were used to determine the statistical significance of the proportions/ratios obtained from the cross tabulated data. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Result A total of 1099 study subjects comprising 401 males and 698 females were included in the study. The overall positive leishmanian skin test and sero-prevalence rates respectively were 9.08% and 0.87%. The difference in LST positivity by age group and sero-prevalence by sex were statistically significant (P <0.01 and P<0.05 respectively). Out of the 9 sero-positive individuals, 7 had no history of travel to visceral leishmaniasis endemic areas out of Raya Azebo. Conclusion In general our results suggest occurrence of VL in the study area is, very low. Our survey also indicates that due to the low incidence of the disease, and lack of awareness, some patients remain under diagnosed."
https://openalex.org/W2998093351,"Introduction Europe has been dealing with an increasing number of refugees during the past 5 years. The timing of screening and vaccination of refugees is debated by many professionals, however refugees’ perspectives on health issues are infrequently taken into account. In this study, we aimed to investigate asylum seekers’ perspectives on infectious diseases screening and vaccination policies. Materials and methods Interviews were conducted in Greece and the Netherlands. Asylum seekers and recently arrived refugees were approached and informed with the help of interpreters; consent forms were acquired. The survey focused on demographic data, vaccination status, screening policies and prevention of infectious diseases. Results A total of 61 (43 male, 70.5%) refugees (30 Afghanis, 16 Syrian, 7 Erithrean) were interviewed. Mean age was 35.2 years (SD 13.5) and 50% had received primary or secondary education, while 24.6% received none. Median time after arrival in Greece and the Netherlands was 24 months (IQR 8.5–28). 44 out of 61 (72.1) participants were willing to be vaccinated after arrival in Europe, 26 preferred vaccination and screening to be performed at the point of entry. The need for screening and vaccination was perceived higher amongst participants in Greece (100% vs 43.3%) due to living conditions leading to increased risk of outbreaks. Conclusion Participants were willing to communicate their perspectives and concerns. Screening and vaccination programs could be more effective when implemented shortly after arrival and by involving asylum seekers and refugees when developing screening and vaccination interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2998097154,"Background Computer modeling of endovascular coiling intervention for intracranial aneurysm could enable a priori patient-specific treatment evaluation. To that end, we previously developed a finite element method (FEM) coiling technique, which incorporated simplified assumptions. To improve accuracy in capturing real-life coiling, we aimed to enhance the modeling strategies and experimentally test whether improvements lead to more accurate coiling simulations. Methods We previously modeled coils using a pre-shape based on mathematical curves and mechanical properties based on those of platinum wires. In the improved version, to better represent the physical properties of coils, we model coil pre-shapes based on how they are manufactured, and their mechanical properties based on their spring-like geometric structures. To enhance the deployment mechanics, we include coil advancement to the aneurysm in FEM simulations. To test if these new strategies produce more accurate coil deployments, we fabricated silicone phantoms of 2 patient-specific aneurysms in duplicate, deployed coils in each, and quantified coil distributions from intra-aneurysmal cross-sections using coil density (CD) and lacunarity (L). These deployments were simulated 9 times each using the original and improved techniques, and CD and L were calculated for cross-sections matching those in the experiments. To compare the 2 simulation techniques, Euclidean distances (dMin, dMax, and dAvg) between experimental and simulation points in standardized CD-L space were evaluated. Univariate tests were performed to determine if these distances were significantly different between the 2 simulations. Results Coil deployments using the improved technique agreed better with experiments than the original technique. All dMin, dMax, and dAvg values were smaller for the improved technique, and the average values across all simulations for the improved technique were significantly smaller than those from the original technique (dMin: p = 0.014, dMax: p = 0.013, dAvg: p = 0.045). Conclusion Incorporating coil-specific physical properties and mechanics improves accuracy of FEM simulations of endovascular intracranial aneurysm coiling."

In addition, sonotubometry with postural change (Ohta's method), sitting CT and a newly devised PHI-10 score were also examined.Voice autophony, aural fullness, and breathing autophony were observed in 93.6%, 87.2%, 78.2%, respectively. In 91% of the ears, PET symptoms improved by postural change from sitting to the lying / forward-bending position. Synchronous movement of the TM upon respiration was observed in 69.1% of the ears. Positive findings of TTAG were observed in 75.6% of ears. Positive findings of sonotubometry were found in 55.1% of ears. Sonotubometry with postural change (Ohta's method), when the cut-off value of over 10dB was used, was positive in 45.2% of ears. Newly devised PHI-10 score representing severity of subjective symptoms classifying patients into no handicap, mild handicap, moderate handicap and severe handicap were observed in 12.2%, 10.8%, 18.9% and 58.1% of ears, respectively. The evaluation of the extent of patency of the ET by sitting CT indicated completely open, closed-short, and closed-long, in 68.6%, 11.4% and 21.4% of ears, respectively. Compared to the closed group, the completely open group had a significantly higher frequency of positive breathing autophony, positive sonotubometry, and positive Ohta's method.The characteristics of main symptoms and the efficiency of various tests in PET diagnosis were analyzed based on data obtained from ""Definite PET"" patients diagnosed by the JOS Diagnostic Criteria. The greater the availability of tests to evaluate PET, the greater the opportunities to diagnose ""Definite PET"". In particular, tests measuring pressure transmission between the nasopharynx and middle ear, such as TM observation and TTAG, are more sensitive than sonotubometry measuring sound transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2997607356,"Pharmaceuticals play an important role in clinical care. However, in community-based research, medication data are commonly collected as unstructured free-text, which is prohibitively expensive to code for large-scale studies. The ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) study developed a two-pronged framework to collect structured medication data for 19,114 individuals. ASPREE provides an opportunity to determine whether medication data can be cost-effectively collected and coded, en masse from the community using this framework.The ASPREE framework of type-to-search box with automated coding and linked free text entry was compared to traditional method of free-text only collection and post hoc coding. Reported medications were classified according to their method of collection and analysed by Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) group. Relative cost of collecting medications was determined by calculating the time required for database set up and medication coding.Overall, 122,910 participant structured medication reports were entered using the type-to-search box and 5,983 were entered as free-text. Free-text data contributed 211 unique medications not present in the type-to-search box. Spelling errors and unnecessary provision of additional information were among the top reasons why medications were reported as free-text. The cost per medication using the ASPREE method was approximately USD $0.03 compared with USD $0.20 per medication for the traditional method.Implementation of this two-pronged framework is a cost-effective alternative to free-text only data collection in community-based research. Higher initial set-up costs of this combined method are justified by long term cost effectiveness and the scientific potential for analysis and discovery gained through collection of detailed, structured medication data."
https://openalex.org/W2998035624,"Ginkgo biloba leaves extract (GBE) was subjected to neuroprotective-guided fractionation to produce eleven fractions with different polarities and constituents. The intermediate polar fraction was shown to be terpene trilactones-enriched fraction (TEGBE). Out of this fraction, pure ginkgolide B (G-B) was further purified and identified based on its spectral data. The effects of GBE and TEGBE were evaluated in comparison to that of G-B in the crush sciatic nerve injury rat model. To evaluate the neuroprotective effects, sixty Wistar male rats were randomly allocated into 6 groups: naive, sham, crush + normal saline, and three treatment groups; crush + GBE, crush + TEGBE, and crush + G-B. Treatments were given one hour following injury, and once daily for 14 days. Neurobehavioral tests, histomorphological examinations, and immunohistochemical analysis of the sciatic nerve and the spinal cord were performed at weeks 3 and 6 post-injury. GBE, TEGBE and G-B were shown to enhance the functional and sensory behavioral parameters and to protect the histological and the ultrastructural elements in the sciatic nerve. Additionally, all treatments prevented spinal cord neurons from further deterioration. It was shown that G-B has the most significant potential effects among all treatments with values that were nearly comparable to those of sham and naive groups."
https://openalex.org/W2998223043,"Homa Bay, Siaya, and Kisumu counties in western Kenya have the highest estimated HIV prevalence (16.3-21.0%) in the country, and struggle to meet program targets for HIV testing services (HTS). The Kenya Ministry of Health (MOH) recommends annual HIV testing for the general population. We assessed the degree to which reducing the interval for retesting to less than 12 months increased diagnosis of HIV in outpatient departments (OPD) in western Kenya. We conducted a retrospective analysis of routinely collected program data from seven high-volume (>800 monthlyOPD visits) health facilities in March-December, 2017. Data from persons ≥15 years of age seeking medical care (patients) in the OPD and non-care-seekers (non-patients) accompanying patients to the OPD were included. Outcomes were meeting MOH (routine) criteria versus criteria for a reduced retesting interval (RRI) of <12 months, and HIV test result. STATA version 14.2 was used to calculate frequencies and proportions, and to test for differences using bivariate analysis. During the 9-month period, 119,950 clients were screened for HIV testing eligibility, of whom 79% (94,766) were eligible and 97% (92,153) received a test. Among 92,153 clients tested, the median age was 28 years, 57% were female and 40% (36,728) were non-patients. Overall, 20% (18,120) of clients tested met routine eligibility criteria: 4% (3,972) had never been tested, 10% (9,316) reported a negative HIV test in the past >12 months, and 5% (4,832) met other criteria. The remaining 80% (74,033) met criteria for a RRI of < 12 months. In total 1.3% (1,185) of clients had a positive test. Although the percent yield was over 2-fold higher among those meeting routine criteria (2.4% vs. 1.0%; p<0.001), 63% (750) of all HIV infections were found among clients tested less than 12 months ago, the majority (81%) of whom reported having a negative test in the past 3-12 months. Non-patients accounted for 45% (539) of all HIV-positive persons identified. Percent yield was higher among non-patients as compared to patients (1.5% vs. 1.2%; p-value = <0.001) overall and across eligibility criteria and age categories. The majority of HIV diagnoses in the OPD occurred among clients reporting a negative HIV test in the past 12 months, clients ineligible for testing under the current MOH guidelines. Nearly half of all HIV-positive individuals identified in the OPD were non-patients. Our findings suggest that in the setting of a generalized HIV epidemic, retesting persons reporting an HIV-negative test in the past 3-12 months, and routine testing of non-patients accessing the OPD are key strategies for timely diagnosis of persons living with HIV."
https://openalex.org/W2998681827,"The Ministry of Health in Brazil included ethambutol in the intensive phase of sensible tuberculosis (TB) treatment in March 2010, due to the increasing drug resistance, and implemented the fixed dose combination in the TB treatment guidelines.A retrospective cohort study was performed to determine the impact of change from three to four drugs schemes on the TB cure and frequency of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in TB patients. To answer this question, we used data from 730 randomly selected patients who received anti-TB treatment between January 2007 and December 2014 in a reference center from Salvador, Brazil.TB patients who received the RHEZ regimen (n = 365) developed ADRs more frequently than those treated with the RHZ (n = 365) (86 [23.6%] vs. 55 [15.1%]; p = 0.01). This difference in ADR incidence was even higher in patients above 30 years-old (64 [74.4%] vs. 36 [65.5%]; p = 0.01). The overall number of ADR episodes was greater in patients from the RHEZ group than in the group that received RHZ (170 [61.4%] vs. 107 [38.6%]; p = 0.03). Multivariable logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, alcohol use and diabetes demonstrated that patients receiving the RHEZ regimen had increased odds of developing ADRs than those undertaking the RHZ scheme (odds ratio [OR]: 1.61, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.10-2.35; p = 0.015). The overall cure rate was similar between the distinct treatment groups.The patients treated with the four-drug regimen exhibited increased risk of ADRs compared to those who received the three-drug regimen, and especially in patients older than 30 years of age."
https://openalex.org/W2997713771,"Based on notified cases of human rabies exposure and human deaths by rabies to Colombia public health surveillance system between 2007 and 2016, we conducted a spatiotemporal analysis to identify epidemiological scenarios of high human rabies exposure due to dogs, cats, bats, or farm animals (n = 666,411 cases). The incidence rate of human rabies exposures was analyzed by using geographical information system (spatiotemporal distribution and Cluster and Outlier Analysis (Anselin Local Moran's I)) data for all Colombian cities. The incidence rate of human rabies exposures due to dogs and cats showed an increasing trend, while aggression due bats and farm animals fluctuated throughout the analyzed period. Human deaths by rabies transmitted by cat and bat occurred in the Andean and Orinoquia regions, which had urban and rural scenarios. The urban scenario showed the highest exposure to human rabies due to cats and dogs in cities characterized with high human population density and greater economic development. In contrary, the highest human rabies exposure in the rural scenario was observed due to contact of mucosa or injured skin with the infected saliva of farm animals with the rabies virus, principally among workers in the agroforestry area. The inequality scenario showed some outlier cities with high human rabies exposure due to farm animals principally in the Pacific region (characterized by the highest poverty rates in Colombia), being Afro-descendant and indigenous population the most exposed. The highest exposure due to bats bite was observed among indigenous people residing in cities of the Amazon region as a dispersed population (Amazonian scenario). None of the high exposure scenarios were related to human deaths by rabies due to dogs aggression. The identified scenarios can help develop better surveillance systems with a differential approach to the vulnerable population and strengthening them in areas with rabies viral circulation."
https://openalex.org/W2997516560,"Bone diseases represent an increasing health burden worldwide, and basic research remains necessary to better understand the complexity of these pathologies and to improve and expand existing prevention and treatment approaches. In the present study, 216 bone samples from the caput femoris and collum femoris of 108 patients with degenerative or dysplastic coxarthrosis, hip fracture, or osteonecrosis were evaluated for the proportion of trabecular bone (TB) and expression of parathyroid hormone (PTH) type 1 receptor (PTH1R), osteoprotegerin (OPG), and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL). Serum levels of PTH, OPG, soluble RANKL (sRANKL), alkaline phosphatase (AP), osteocalcin, total procollagen type-1 intact N-terminal propeptide (TP1NP), tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase type 5b (TRAP5b), sclerostin, and C-telopeptide of type-1 collagen (ICTP) were also determined. Age was positively correlated with serum levels of PTH, OPG, and sclerostin but negatively associated with TB and sRANKL. Women exhibited less TB, lower sclerostin and ICTP, and higher TRAP5b. Impaired kidney function was associated with shorter bone decalcification time, less TB, lower sRANKL, and higher serum PTH, OPG, and sclerostin. Furthermore, correlations were observed between bone PTH1R and OPG expression and between serum PTH, OPG, and AP. There were also positive correlations between serum OPG and TP1NP; serum OPG and sclerostin; serum AP, osteocalcin, and TRAP5b; and serum sclerostin and ICTP. Serum OPG was negatively associated with sRANKL. In summary, clear relationships between specific bone metabolism markers were observed, and distinct influences of age, sex, and kidney function, thus underscoring their suitability as diagnostic or prognostic markers."
https://openalex.org/W2997527007,"Recurrent and chronic otitis media (OM) are often refractory to antibiotics due to bacterial persistence in biofilm within the middle ear. In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that antimicrobial proteins and peptides (AMPs) are bactericidal against otopathogens, indicating potential therapeutic value for recalcitrant OM. We measured concentrations of 6 AMPs and 14 cytokines in middle ear effusion (MEE) from 67 children undergoing ventilation tube insertion for recurrent acute OM. Sixty one percent of children had bacterial otopathogens detected in their MEE, 39% by PCR and 22% by PCR and culture. Groups were defined as: PCR-negative/culture-negative (absence of bacterial otopathogen), n = 26; PCR-positive/culture-negative (presence of nonculturable bacterial otopathogen), n = 26; PCR-positive/culture-positive (presence of culturable bacterial otopathogen), n = 15. Age, antibiotic usage, day-care attendance, presence of respiratory viruses in MEE and number of AOM episodes were similar between groups. AMP and cytokine concentrations were higher in children with bacterial otopathogens in their MEE compared to those with no bacterial otopathogens. Median concentrations of AMPs (except HBD2) were 3 to 56-fold higher in MEE from children with bacterial otopathogens detected in their MEE (P ≤ 0.01). Similarly, median cytokine concentrations (except TGFβ) were >16-fold higher in MEE with bacterial otopathogens detected (P ≤ 0.001). This is the first study to measure AMPs in MEE and together with the cytokine data, results suggest that elevated AMPs and cytokines in MEE are a marker of inflammation and bacterial persistence. AMPs may play an important role in OM pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2997573493,"Background A constitutively active RAS protein in the absence of stimulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is the result of mutations in KRAS and NRAS genes. Mutations in the KRAS exon 2 and outside exon 2 have been found to predict the resistance to anti-EGFR monoclonal therapy. A substantial proportion of metastatic colorectal cancer cases (mCRC) exhibit RAS mutations outside KRAS exon 2, particularly in KRAS exon 3 and 4 and NRAS exons 2 and 3. No data about RAS mutations outside KRAS exon 2 are available for Jordanian patients with mCRC. We aim to study the molecular spectrum, frequency, and distribution pattern of KRAS and NRAS mutations in Jordanian patients with mCRC. Methods A cohort of 190 Jordanian metastatic colorectal cancer patients were enrolled in the trial. We detected mutations in exon 2 of the KRAS and NRAS gene as well as mutations outside of exon 2 using the StripAssay technique. The KRAS StripAssay covered 29 mutations and 22 NRAS mutations. Results Mutations were observed in 92 (48.42%) cases, and KRAS exon 2 mutations accounted for 76 cases (83.69%). KRAS G12D was the most common mutation, occurring in 18 cases, followed by KRAS G12A in 16 cases, and G12T in 13 cases. Mutations outside of KRAS exon 2 represented 16.3% of the mutated cases. Among those, 6 cases (6.48%) carried mutations in NRAS exon 2 and 3, and 10 cases (10.87%) in KRAS exon 3 and 4. Conclusion The frequency of NRAS and KRAS mutations outside of exon 2 appears to be higher in Jordanian patients in comparison with patients from western countries. KRAS mutations outside of exon 2 should be tested routinely to identify patients who should not be treated with anti-EGFR antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W2998056932,"Crop plants always encounter multiple stresses in the natural environment. Here, the effects of the fungicide zinc thiazole (ZT) on propagation of Ralstonia solanacearum, a bacterial pathogen, were investigated in peanut seedlings under salt stress. Compared with water control, salt stress markedly reduced pathogen resistance in peanut seedlings. However, impaired pathogen resistance was alleviated by treatment with dimethylthiourea, a specific ROS scavenger, or ZT. Subsequently, salt stress or combined salt and pathogen treatment resulted in inhibition of photosynthesis, loss of chlorophyll and accumulation of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, which could be reversed by ZT. In addition, ZT treatment suppressed the salt stress up-regulated Na+ content and Na+/K+ ratios in peanut roots. Furthermore, salt stress or combined salt and pathogen treatment impaired the activities of antioxidant (e.g. superoxide dismutase/SOD and catalase/CAT), and defense-related (e.g. phenylalanine ammonia lyase /PAL and polyphenol oxidase/PPO) enzymes, which could be rescued by addition of ZT. In contrast, only slight changes of SOD and CAT activities were observed in pathogen-infected seedlings. Similarly, activities of PAL and PPO were slightly modified by salt stress in peanut seedlings. These results suggest that the ZT-enhanced pathogen resistance can be partly attributed to the improvement of photosynthetic capacity and defense enzyme activities, and also the inhibition of Na+/K+ ratios, in this salt-stressed crop plant."
https://openalex.org/W2997719399,"Effective landscape-scale management of source-sink deer populations will be strengthened by understanding whether local variation in habitat quality drives heterogeneity in productivity. We related female roe deer Capreolus capreolus fecundity and body mass to habitat composition and landscape context, separately for adults and yearlings, using multi-model inference (MMI) applied to a large sample of individuals (yearlings: fecundity = 202, body mass = 395; adults: fecundity = 908, body mass = 1669) culled during 2002-2015 from an extensive (195 km2) heterogeneous forest landscape. Adults were heavier (inter-quartile, IQ, effect size = +0.5kg) when culled in buffers comprising more arable lands while contrary to our prediction no effects on body mass of grassland, young forest or access to vegetation on calcareous soil were found. Heavier adults were more fertile (IQ effect size, +12% probability of having two embryos instead of one or zero). Counter-intuitively, adults with greater access to arable lands were less fecund (IQ effect of arable: -7% probability of having two embryos, instead of one or zero), and even accounting for greater body mass of adults with access to arable, their modelled fecundity was similar to or lower than that of adults in the forest interior. In contrast, effects of grassland, young forest and calcareous soil did not receive support. Yearling body mass had an effect on fecundity twice that found in adults (+23% probability of having one additional embryo), but yearling body mass and fecundity were not affected by any candidate habitat or landscape variables. Effect of arable lands on body mass and fecundity were small, with little variance explained (Coefficient of Variation of predicted fecundity across forest sub-regions = 0.03 for adults). More variance in fecundity was attributed to other differences between forest management sub-regions (modelled as random effects), suggesting other factors might be important. When analysing source-sink population dynamics to support management, an average value of fecundity can be appropriate across a heterogeneous forest landscape."
https://openalex.org/W2998148457,"In order to map attitudes, knowledge and skills related to evidence-based medicine (EBM) in students of medical and health sciences faculties, we performed an online survey during the spring semester 2019 in all medical and health sciences faculties in Hungary. In total, 1080 students of medicine and 911 students of health sciences completed the online questionnaire. The attitude towards EBM was generally positive; however, only a small minority of students rated their EBM-related skills as advanced. There were large differences in the understanding of different EBM-related terms, with 'sample size' as the term with the highest (65%) and 'intention-to-treat analysis' with the lowest (7%) proportion of medical students being able to properly explain the meaning of the expression. Medical students who already participated in some EBM training rated their skills in searching and evaluating medical literature and their knowledge of EBM-related terms significantly better and had a more positive attitude towards using EBM in the practice than students without previous EBM training. EBM trained medical students were more likely to choose online journals (17.5% compared to 23.9%, p<0.05) and professional guidelines (15.4% compared to 6.1%, p<0.001) instead of printed books (33.6% compared to 52.6, p<0.001) as the main source of healthcare information retrieval and used Pubmed/Medline, Medscape and the Cochrane Library to a significant higher rate than students without any previous EBM training. Healthcare work experience (OR = 1.59; 95% CI = 1.01–2.52), conducting student research (OR = 2.02; 95% CI = 1.45–2.82) and upper year university students (OR = 1.65; 95% CI = 1.37–1.98) were other factors significantly influencing EBM-related knowledge. We conclude that the majority of students of medical and health sciences faculties are keen to acquire EBM-related knowledge and skills during their university studies. Significantly higher EBM-related knowledge and skills among EBM trained students underline the importance of targeted EBM education, while parallel increase of knowledge and skills with increasing number of education years highlight the importance of integrating EBM terminology and concepts also into the thematic of other courses."
https://openalex.org/W2998323690,"Inorganic N fertilizers are commonly used in commercial blueberry fields; however, this form of N can favor increased weed species’ growth, which can ultimately reduce the benefits of fertilization. We hypothesized that chipped ramial wood (CRW) compost is an effective alternative organic fertilizer for blueberry plants when weeds are present, as ericaceous shrub species are generally more efficient in utilizing organic N than herbaceous weed species. In this study, we measured the growth, fruit yield, and foliar N response of lowbush blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium Aiton) to an application of 45 kg N ha-1 in the form of organic (CRW) or inorganic N (ammonium sulfate) in two areas of a commercial field colonized by either poverty oat grass (Danthonia spicata (L.) Beauv.) or sweet fern (Comptonia peregrina (L.) Coult.). We also assessed the impact of the fertilization treatments on litter decomposition rates. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found no significant increase in blueberry fruit yield or growth using CRW. By contrast, inorganic N-fertilization increased fruit yield by 70%. The effect was higher in the area colonized by D. spicata (+83%) than by C. peregrina (+45%). Blueberry fruit yield was on average twice higher in the area of the field having D. spicata than C. peregrina, suggesting a stronger competition with the latter. However, the increase in D. spicata density from 0–1 to >25 plants m-2 reduced fruit production by three-fold and strongly impacted vegetative growth in both fertilized and unfertilized plots. The impact of increased C. peregrina density was comparatively much lower, especially on vegetative growth, which was much higher in the area having C. peregrina. These patterns are likely due to a lower competition for N uptake with C. peregrina as this species can derive N from the atmosphere. Interestingly, the higher fruit yield in the area colonized by D. spicata occurred even in plots where the weeds were nearly absent (density of 0–1 plant m-2), revealing the influence of unidentified variables on blueberry fruit yield. We hypothesized that this difference resulted from over-optimal foliar N concentrations in the area colonized by C. peregrina as suggested by the significantly higher foliar N concentrations and by the negative correlation between foliar N concentrations and fruit yields in this area. The possibility of an influence of C. peregrina on flowering and pollination success, as well as of unidentified local site conditions is discussed. The tested N-fertilization treatments did not affect foliar N concentrations or litter decomposition rates. Overall, our results show that ammonium sulfate is very effective at increasing fruit yields but that both fruit yields and the efficiency of the N-fertilization treatment are decreased by increased D. spicata density, especially above 25 plants m-2. Although CRW did not significantly enhance fruit yields in the short term, this fertilizer may have a long-term beneficial effect."
https://openalex.org/W2998453520,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with widespread effects on distant organs, including the lungs. Surfactant protein (SP)-A and SP-D are members of the C-type lectin family, which plays a critical role in host defense and regulation of inflammation in a variety of infections. Serum levels of SP-A and SP-D are markers to reflect lung injury in acute respiratory distress syndrome, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and sarcoidosis. We investigated the change of lung-specific markers, including SP-A and SP-D in an AKI mice model. We studied C57BL/6J mice 4 and 24 hours after an episode of ischemic AKI (23 min of renal pedicle clamping and then reperfusion); numerous derangements were present, including SP-A, SP-D, and lung tight-junction protein. Neutrophil infiltration and apoptosis in the lungs increased in ischemic AKI. Receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) in the lungs, a marker of pneumocyte I, was not changed. Lung tight-junction proteins, particularly claudin-4, claudin-18, and anti-junctional adhesion molecule 1 (JAMA-1), were reduced in 24 hours after AKI. Serum SP-A and SP-D significantly increased in ischemic AKI. SP-A and SP-D in the lungs did not increase in ischemic AKI. The immunohistochemistry showed that the expression of SP-A and SP-D was intact in ischemic AKI. SP-A and SP-D in the kidneys were significantly higher in AKI than in the sham. These patterns of SP-A and SP-D in the kidneys were similar to those of serum. AKI induces apoptosis and inflammation in the lungs. Serum SP-A and SP-D increased in ischemic AKI, but these could have originated from the kidneys. So serum SP-A and SP-D could not reflect lung injury in AKI. Further study is needed to reveal how a change in lung tight-junction protein could influence the prognosis in patients with AKI."
https://openalex.org/W2998331697,"Background Galanin, an inhibitory neuropeptide and cotransmitter has long been known to co-localize with noradrenaline and serotonin in the central nervous system. Several human studies demonstrated altered galanin expression levels in major depressive disorder and anxiety. Pharmacological modulation of galanin signaling and transgenic strategies provide further proof for the involvement of the galanin system in the pathophysiology of mood disorders. Little is known, however, on the dynamic regulation of galanin expression at the transcriptional level. The aim of the present study was to seek genetic association of non-coding single nucleotide variations in the galanin gene with anxiety and depression. Methods Six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) occurring either in the regulatory 5’ or 3’ flanking regions or within intronic sequences of the galanin gene have been genotyped with a high-throughput TaqMan OpenArray qPCR system in 526 healthy students (40% males). Depression and anxiety scores were obtained by filling in the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire. Data were analyzed by ANCOVA and Bonferroni correction was applied for multiple testing. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis was used to map two haploblocks in the analyzed region. Results and conclusions A single-locus and a haplotype genetic association proved to be statistically significant. In single-marker analysis, the T allele of the rs1042577 SNP within the 3’ untranslated region of the galanin gene associated with greater levels of anxiety (HADS scores were 7.05±4.0 vs 6.15±.15; p = 0.000407). Haplotype analysis revealed an association of the rs948854 C_rs4432027_C allele combination with anxiety [F(1,1046) = 4.140, p = 0.042141, η2 = 0.004, power = 0.529]. Neither of these associations turned out to be gender-specific. These promoter polymorphisms are supposed to participate in epigenetic regulation of galanin expression by creating potentially methylatable CpG dinucleotides. The functional importance of the rs1042577_T allele remains to be elucidated."
https://openalex.org/W2998504394,"Allergic asthma, characterized by chronic airway Th2-dominated inflammation, is associated with an increased risk of infection; however, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Forkhead box protein A2 (Foxa2) plays a critical role in Th2 inflammation and is associated with pulmonary defenses. To determining the role of Foxa2 in Th2-dominated lung inflammation against the invading bacteria, we established a mouse OVA-sensitized model, an Escherichia coli lung invasion model, and mice with conditional deletion of Foxa2 in respiratory epithelial cells. The number of bacteria in the lung tissue was counted to assess clearance ability of lung. Lung inflammation and histopathology was evaluated using HE and PAS staining. It was found that OVA-sensitized mice had decreased E. coli clearance, reduced Foxa2 expression, and decreased DEFB1 secretion. Conditional deletion of Foxa2 in respiratory epithelial cells led to decreased clearance of E. coli and impaired secretion of DEFB1, similar to the OVA-induced allergic condition. The impaired secretion of DEFB1 may be responsible for the increased risk of infection in the Th2-dominated airway inflammation. Dual luciferase assay demonstrated that Foxa2 regulates DEFB1 expression by affecting its promoter activity in HBE cells. Our study indicated that Foxa2 plays an important role in Th2-dominated airway inflammation against invading bacteria. Conditional deletion of Foxa2 in respiratory epithelial cells can reduce pulmonary’s defense against bacterial invasion by inhibiting DEFB1expression."
https://openalex.org/W2996829337,"Vegetation in urban areas provides many essential ecosystem services. These services may be indirect, such as carbon sequestration and biological diversity, or direct, including microclimate regulation and cultural values. As the global population is becoming ever more urbanized these services will be increasingly vital to the quality of life in urban areas. Due to the combined effects of shading and evapotranspiration, trees have the potential to cool urban microclimates and mitigate urban heat, reduce thermal discomfort and help to create comfortable outdoor spaces for people. Understory vegetation in the form of shrubs and grass layers are also increasingly recognized for the positive role they play in human aesthetics and supporting biodiversity. However, in fire-prone urban landscapes there are risks associated with having denser and more complex vegetation in public open spaces. We investigated the effects of plant selection and planting arrangement on fire risk and human thermal comfort using the Forest Flammability Model and Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET), to identify how planting arrangement can help balance the trade-offs between these risks and benefits. Our research demonstrated the importance of vertical separation of height strata and suggests that Clumped and Continuous planting arrangements are the most effective way of keeping complex vegetation in public open space to deliver the greatest human thermal comfort benefit while minimizing potential fire behaviour. This study provides an example of how existing research tools in multiple ecological fields can be combined to inform positive outcomes for people and nature in urban landscapes."
https://openalex.org/W2997086719,"One identified dihydroflavonol 4-reductases (DFR) encoding gene (named as CsDFRa herein) and five putative DFRs (named as CsDFRb1, CsDFRb2, CsDFRb3, CsDFRc and CsDFRd) in tea (Camellia sinensis) have been widely discussed in recent papers concerning multi-omics data. However, except for CsDFRa, their function and biochemical characteristics are not clear. This study aims to compare all putative CsDFRs and preliminarily evaluate their function. We investigated the sequences of genes (coding and promoter regions) and predicted structures of proteins encoded, and determined the activities of heterologously expressed CsDFRs under various conditions. The results showed that the sequences of five putative CsDFRs were quite different from CsDFRa, and had lower expression levels as well. The five putative CsDFRs could not catalyze three dihydroflavonol substrates. The functional CsDFRa had the strongest affinity with dihydroquercetin, and performed best at pH around 7 and 35°C but was not stable at lower pHs or higher temperatures. Single amino acid mutation at position 141 modified the preference of CsDFRa for dihydroquercetin and dihydromyricetin, and also weakened its stability. These data suggest that only CsDFRa works in the pathway for generating anthocyanidins and catechins. This study provides new insights into the function of CsDFRs and may assist to develop new strategies to manipulate the composition of tea flavonoids in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2997834454,"The aim of this study was to establish the value of the renal resistive index (RI) of intrarenal arteries in healthy warmblood non-racing horses of different ages to assess the influence of physiologic factors and repeatability of measurement. The kidney ultrasonography examination was performed in three age groups: 15 foals, 15 adults and 15 elderly horses. The procedure was performed in unsedated standing animals. RI values were measured using pulsed-wave Doppler at the medial part of each kidney in the intrarenal arteries. To evaluate repeatability, all measurements were repeated two hours after the first examination. Statistical analysis of the relationship between groups was carried out using Fisher’s test. The relationship between the RI value and the physiological parameters was evaluated using linear regression. Repeatability of measurements was determined based on the Bland-Altman plot. The mean RI value in the studied horses was 0.48 ± 0.05 in the left kidney and 0.49 ± 0.05 in the right kidney. There were no statistically significant differences between the RI values in foals and adult horses. The elderly horses had a significantly higher RI value. Pulse pressure was the only physiological parameter affecting the RI value. The repeatability coefficient was 0.089 for the right kidney and 0.09 for the left kidney. The presented result suggest that elderly healthy horses have higher RI values than younger animals, which should be taken into account in clinical practice. The arterial pulse pressure should also be considered when interpreting RI values. The measurements have high repeatability, but in the authors’ opinion, this procedure is time consuming and requires experience."
https://openalex.org/W2998117658,"Francisella tularensis, a category-A bioterrorism agent causes tularemia. F. tularensis suppresses the immune response of host cells and intracellularly proliferates. However, the detailed mechanisms of immune suppression and intracellular growth are largely unknown. Here we developed a transposon mutant library to identify novel pathogenic factors of F. tularensis. Among 750 transposon mutants of F. tularensis subsp. novicida (F. novicida), 11 were isolated as less cytotoxic strains, and the genes responsible for cytotoxicity were identified. Among them, the function of slt, which encodes soluble lytic transglycosylase (SLT) was investigated in detail. An slt deletion mutant (Δslt) was less toxic to the human monocyte cell line THP-1 vs the wild-type strain. Although the wild-type strain proliferated in THP-1 cells, the number of intracellular Δslt mutant decreased in comparison. The Δslt mutant escaped from phagosomes during the early stages of infection, but the mutant was detected within the autophagosome, followed by degradation in lysosomes. Moreover, the Δslt mutant induced host cells to produce high levels of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-1β, compared with the wild-type strain. These results suggest that the SLT of F. novicida is required for immune suppression and escape from autophagy to allow its survival in host cells."
https://openalex.org/W2997023494,"Tuberculosis is a global public health problem. Bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis (BC-PTB) patients require three sputum smear monitoring (SSM) tests to establish cure or treatment success, but few studies have assessed the relationship. We evaluated the effect of completing SSM on treatment success rate (TSR) among adult BC-PTB patients in rural eastern Uganda.We conducted a propensity score-matched (PSM) analysis of a retrospective observational cohort data. Participants who completed SSM were matched to those who had not, through nearest neighbor 1:1 caliper matching. Balance of baseline characteristics between the groups was compared before and after PSM using standardized mean differences. Logistic regression analysis was performed in matched and unmatched samples, reported as odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Robustness of the results to hidden bias was checked through sensitivity analysis. The primary outcome was TSR (treatment completion or cure), while the secondary was cure rate, measured as an individual outcome.Before PSM, 591 (72.3%) of the 817 participants had incomplete SSM, with statistically significant differences in baseline covariates between completers and non-completers. After PSM, there were 185 participants in either group, balanced on baseline covariates. Before PSM, SSM completion was not associated with TSR, with unadjusted (OR, 0.92; 95%CI, 0.32-2.63) and adjusted analysis (Adjusted OR, 1.32; 95%CI, 0.41-4.22). For cure rate, there was a statistically significant effect before (OR, 93.34; 95%CI, 29.53-295.99) and after adjusted analysis (Adjusted OR, 86.24; 95%CI, 27.05-274.94), although imprecise. In PSM analysis, SSM completion was associated with increased odds of cure (OR, 87.00; 95%CI, 12.12-624.59) but not TSR (OR, 1.67; 95%CI, 0.40-6.97).Completing SSM increases cure but has no effect on TSR among adult BC-PTB patients in eastern Uganda. Implementation of SSM should be encouraged to ensure improvement in cure rates among tuberculosis patients in rural areas."
https://openalex.org/W2998155427,"Purpose Vestibular Myogenic Evoked Potential (VEMP) evaluates vestibulo-ocular and vestibulo-collic reflexes involved in the function of the otolithic organs and their afferent pathways. We compared the results of cervical and ocular VEMP in HTLV-1 associated myelopathy (HAM) and HTLV-1-asymptomatic infection. Participants and methods This cross-sectional study included 52 HTLV-1-infected individuals (26 HAM and 26 asymptomatic carriers) and 26 seronegative controls. The groups were similar regarding age and gender. Participants underwent simultaneous ocular and cervical VEMP. The stimulus to generate VEMP was a low-frequency tone burst sound tone burst, with an intensity of 120 decibels normalized hearing level, bandpass filter from 10 to 1,500 Hertz (Hz), with 100 stimuli at 500 Hz and 50 milliseconds recording time. The latencies of the electrophysiological waves P13 and N23 for cervical VEMP and N10 and P15 waves for ocular VEMP were compared among the groups. The absence or delay of the electrophysiological waves were considered abnormal results. Results Ocular VEMP was similar among the groups for N10 (p = 0.375) and different for P15 (p≤0.001). Cervical VEMP was different for P13 (p = 0.001) and N23 (p = 0.003). About ocular VEMP, in the HTLV-1-asymptomatic group, normal waves were found in 23(88.5%) individuals; in HAM group, normal waves were found in 7(26.9%). About cervical VEMP, 18(69.2%) asymptomatic carriers presented normal waves and only 3(11.5%) patients with HAM presented normal waves. Abnormalities in both VEMPs were found in 1(3.8%) asymptomatic carrier and in 16(61.5%) patients with HAM. Conclusion Neurological impairment in HAM was not restricted to the spinal cord. The mesencephalic connections, tested by ocular VEMP, have been also altered. Damage of the oculomotor system, responsible for eye stabilization during head and body movements, may explain why dizziness is such a frequent complaint in HAM."
https://openalex.org/W2998484241,"Cataracts are focal to diffuse opacities of the eye lens causing impaired vision or complete blindness. For bilateral congenital cataracts in Red Holsteins a perfectly cosegregating mutation within the CPAMD8 gene (CPAMD8:g.5995966C>T) has been reported. We genotyped the CPAMD8:g.5995966C>T variant in Holstein calves affected by congenital bilateral congenital cataracts, their unaffected relatives and randomly selected herd mates. Ophthalmological examinations were performed in all affected individuals to confirm a congenital cataract. Whole genome sequencing was employed to screen variants in candidate genes for the Morgagnian cataract phenotype. In the present study, 3/35 cases were confirmed as homozygous mutated and 6/14 obligate carriers. Further 7/46 unaffected animals related with these cases were heterozygous mutated for the CPAMD8:g.5995966C>T variant. However 32 cases with a congenital cataract showed the wild type for the CPAMD8 variant. We did not identify variants in the candidate genes CPAMD8 and NID1 or in their close neighborhood as strongly associated with the congenital cataract phenotype in Holstein calves with the CPAMD8 wild type. In conclusion, the CPAMD8:g.5995966C>T variant is insufficient to explain the majority of Morgagnian congenital cataract phenotypes in Holsteins. It is very likely that congenital bilateral cataracts may be genetically heterogeneous and not yet known variants in genes other than CPAMD8 and NID1 are involved."
https://openalex.org/W2996835012,"After training, visual perceptual learning improvements are mostly constrained to the trained stimulus feature and retinal location. The aim of this study is to construct an integrated paradigm where the visual learning happens in a more natural context and in parallel for multiple stimulus types, and to test the generalization of learning-related improvements towards untrained features, locations, and more general cognitive domains. Half the subjects were trained with a gamified perceptual learning paradigm for ten hours, which consisted of an orientation discrimination task and a novel object categorization task embedded in a three-dimensional maze. A second group of subjects, an active control group, played ten hours of Candy Crush Saga. Before and after training, all subjects completed a 'near transfer' orientation discrimination and novel object categorization task, as well as a set of 'far transfer' general cognitive and attentional tasks. During the perceptual learning tasks, two different stimulus features and two retinal location pairs were assessed in each task. For the experimental group, one stimulus feature and retinal location pair was trained, whilst the other one remained untrained. Both features and location pairs were untrained in the control group. Far transfer did occur in some domains across all subjects irrespective of the training regimen (i.e. executive functioning, mental rotation performance, and multitask performance and speed). Near transfer was present in both groups, however only more pronounced for one particular task in the experimental group, namely novel object categorization. To conclude, all but one near transfer task did not generalize more than the control group."
https://openalex.org/W2997022307,"E. coli associated Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (epidemic hemolytic uremic syndrome, eHUS) caused by Shiga toxin-producing bacteria is characterized by thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and acute kidney injury that cause acute renal failure in up to 65% of affected patients. We hypothesized that the mannose-binding lectin (MBL) pathway of complement activation plays an important role in human eHUS, as we previously demonstrated that injection of Shiga Toxin-2 (Stx-2) led to fibrin deposition in mouse glomeruli that was blocked by co-injection of the anti-MBL-2 antibody 3F8. However, the markers of platelet thrombosis in affected mouse glomeruli were not delineated. To investigate the effect of 3F8 on markers of platelet thrombosis, we used kidney sections from our mouse model (MBL-2+/+ Mbl-A/C-/-; MBL2 KI mouse). Mice in the control group received PBS, while mice in a second group received Stx-2, and those in a third group received 3F8 and Stx-2. Using double immunofluorescence (IF) followed by digital image analysis, kidney sections were stained for fibrin(ogen) and CD41 (marker for platelets), von-Willebrand factor (marker for endothelial cells and platelets), and podocin (marker for podocytes). Electron microscopy (EM) was performed on ultrathin sections from mice and human with HUS. Injection of Stx-2 resulted in an increase of both fibrin and platelets in glomeruli, while administration of 3F8 with Stx-2 reduced both platelet and fibrin to control levels. EM studies confirmed that CD41-positive objects observed by IF were platelets. The increases in platelet number and fibrin levels by injection of Stx-2 are consistent with the generation of platelet-fibrin thrombi that were prevented by 3F8."
https://openalex.org/W2998151893,"Hematological values are of primary importance when investigating the health and physiological status of populations as they reflect the biological equilibrium of aquatic ecosystems. The objectives of this study are to produce baseline values for hematological parameters of the Amazon River dolphin (Inia geoffrensis), as well as to investigate significant variations according to sex, age, reproductive status and stress level. One-hundred-and-ten dolphins from Mamirauá Sustainable Development Reserve (3°3’S, 64°51’W), Central Amazon, Brazil, were live captured and sampled in November 2004 and 2005. Further, the means, standard deviations, minimum and maximum values and reference values (90% CI) were calculated. Correlations were performed to assess the relationships among blood values and cardiac rate (CR), respiratory frequency (RF), handling time and level of stress. No significant differences were found between sexes. Also, no differences occurred among pregnant and non-pregnant females, pregnant females and adult males or non-pregnant females and adult males. Calves had a higher white blood cell (WBC) count, and the neutrophil and lymphocyte absolute counts were significantly higher in calves than adults. The level of stress determined by empirical observation positively correlated with the WBC, neutrophil, lymphocyte and monocyte absolute counts and CR and RF. It was found that less stressed animals tend to present lower platelet counts and lower CR. The handling time of the dolphins was positively correlated with hematocrit (Hct), red blood cells (RBC) and Hb level. The hematological and physiological parameters varied according to time of handling and proved to be a good bioindicator of acute stress in Amazon River dolphins. The data provided here can complement long-term monitoring and identify the early warning indicators of health problems at the population level."
https://openalex.org/W2997605479,"Humans constantly decide among multiple action plans. Carrying out one action usually implies that other plans are suppressed. Here we make use of inter-trial effects to determine whether suppression of non-chosen action plans is due to proactively preparing for upcoming decisions or due to retroactive influences from previous decisions. Participants received rewards for timely and accurate saccades to targets appearing left or right from fixation. Each block interleaved trials with one (single-trial) or two targets (choice-trial). Whereas single-trial rewards were always identical, rewards for the two targets in choice-trials could either be identical (unbiased) or differ (biased) within one block. We analyzed single-trial latencies as a function of idiosyncratic choice-consistency or reward-bias, the previous trial type and whether the same or the other target was selected in the preceding trial. After choice-trials, single-trial responses to the previously non-chosen target were delayed. For biased choices, inter-trial effects were strongest when choices were followed by a single-trial to the non-chosen target. In the unbiased condition, inter-trial effects increased with increasing individual consistency of choice behavior. These findings suggest that the suppression of alternative action plans is not coupled to target selection and motor execution but instead depends on top-down signals like the overall preference of one target over another."
https://openalex.org/W2997407289,"Large scale biological responses are inherently uncertain, in part as a consequence of noisy systems that do not respond deterministically to perturbations and measurement errors inherent to technological limitations. As a result, they are computationally difficult to model and current approaches are notoriously slow and computationally intensive (multiscale stochastic models), fail to capture the effects of noise across a system (chemical kinetic models), or fail to provide sufficient biological fidelity because of broad simplifying assumptions (stochastic differential equations). We use a new approach to modeling multiscale stationary biological processes that embraces the noise found in experimental data to provide estimates of the parameter uncertainties and the potential mis-specification of models. Our approach models the mean stationary response at each biological level given a particular expected response relationship, capturing variation around this mean using conditional Monte Carlo sampling that is statistically consistent with training data. A conditional probability distribution associated with a biological response can be reconstructed using this method for a subset of input values, which overcomes the parameter identification problem. Our approach could be applied in addition to dynamical modeling methods (see above) to predict uncertain biological responses over experimental time scales. To illustrate this point, we apply the approach to a test case in which we model the variation associated with measurements at multiple scales of organization across a reproduction-related Adverse Outcome Pathway described for teleosts."
https://openalex.org/W2998619971,"Purpose Bias has been described as one important obstacle in scientific research. The aim of this study was to explore “awareness of treatment” as a possible source of bias in subjective grading of ocular complications. Methods Thirty subjects with similar, basic experience with grading scales participated in the study. The Efron grading scales were used to grade 24 images of three different ocular conditions (eight images each of bulbar hyperaemia, limbal vascularization and corneal staining). Three consecutive, two weeks apart, grading sessions were scheduled, in which the same images were graded, although in the third session images were deceptively labelled as either “treated” or “untreated”. Grading results from the first and second sessions were compared to determine grading reliability and discrepancies with the third session informed of grading bias originating from “awareness of treatment”. Results Moderate to good test-retest reliability was found for all conditions, with median intraclass correlation values of 0.80 (0.62–0.84) for bulbar hyperaemia, 0.68 (0.65–0.77) for limbal vascularization and 0.68 (0.66–0.74) for corneal staining. Grading values from the first and third sessions evidenced negative and positive systematic errors (bias) for “treated” and “untreated” conditions, respectively. Statistically significant differences were found between the average grading discrepancies of session 1 and session 2 and those of session 1 and session 3 (all p<0.001). Conclusions “Awareness of treatment” may be considered a source of bias of subjective grading of ocular complications, although the actual effect of bias is unlikely to be of clinical significance."
