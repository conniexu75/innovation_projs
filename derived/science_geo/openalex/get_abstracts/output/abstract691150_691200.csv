https://openalex.org/W4220725712,"Owing to extraordinary healing power, Terminalia species have been used in traditional medicine systems to treat various diseases. Many folklore uses of Terminalia neotaliala (Madagascar's almond) included treating arterial hypertension, diabetes, diarrhea, dysentery, colic, oral and digestive candidiasis, intestinal parasitic infections, inflammatory skin conditions, postpartum care, and mycotic infections but nevertheless scientifically explored for its medicinal and pharmacological importance. Therefore, the current study intended to prepare methanolic extract and its fractionation with hexane, chloroform, and butanol followed by evaluation of their polyphenolic content, biological activities, and LCMS analysis. The biological study included antioxidant activity and enzyme inhibition assay i.e., α-glucosidase and urease. The insight study of biologically active secondary metabolites of butanol fraction (BUAE) was performed through LCMS.The total phenolic content (TPC) and total flavonoid content (TFC) of hydroalcoholic and its fractions were estimated using the Folin-Ciocalteu and aluminum chloride method. The total tannin content (TTC) was determined using the Folin-Denis spectrophotometric method. Similarly, the antioxidant potential of HAAE, HEAE, CFAE, and BUAE was determined using four methods as DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl), 2,2-azinobis(3-ethylbenothiazoline)-6-sulfonic acid, cupric reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC), and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP). The sample extracts were also evaluated against two clinically important enzymes i.e., α-glucosidase and urease.The BUAE (butanol aerial fraction) showed the highest TPC (234.79 ± 0.12 mg.GAE.g-1 DE), TFC (320.75 ± 12.50 mg.QE.g-1 DE), and TTC (143.36 ± 4.32 mg.TA.Eq.g-1 DE). The BUAE also showed the highest scavenging potential determined by DPPH (642.65 ± 1.11 mg.TEq.g-1 DE) and ABTS (543.17 ± 1.11 mg.TEq.g-1 DE), and the metal-reducing capacity determined by CUPRAC (1510.41 ± 4.45 mg.TEq.g-1 DE) and FRAP (739.81 ± 19.32 mg.TEq.g-1 DE). The LCMS of BUAE identified 18 different biologically active phytoconstituents validating a rich source of hydrolyzable tannins including ellagitannins and gallitannins.The present study concluded that T. neotaliala is a rich source of polyphenols capable of neutralizing the damage caused by free radical accumulation in the cells and tissues. The significant antioxidant results and identification of high molecular weight hydrolyzable tannins enlightened the medicinal importance of T. neotaliala."
https://openalex.org/W4221006456,"With the growing number of open access (OA) mandates, the accurate measurement of OA publishing is an important policy issue. Existing studies have provided estimates of the prevalence of OA publications ranging from 27.9% to 53.7%, depending on the data source and period of investigation. This paper aims at providing a comparison of the proportion of OA publishing as represented in two major bibliometric databases, Web of Science (WoS) and Dimensions, and assesses how the choice of database affects the measurement of OA across different countries. Results show that a higher proportion of publications indexed in Dimensions are OA than those indexed by WoS, and that this is particularly true for publications originating from outside North America and Europe. The paper concludes with a discussion of the cause and consequences of these differences, motivating the use of more inclusive databases when examining OA, especially for publications originating beyond North America and Europe."
https://openalex.org/W4220746807,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a persistent and difficult-to-treat pathogen in many patients, especially those with Cystic Fibrosis (CF). Herein, we describe a longitudinal analysis of a series of multidrug resistant (MDR) P. aeruginosa isolates recovered in a 17-month period, from a young female CF patient who underwent double lung transplantation. Our goal was to understand the genetic basis of the observed resistance phenotypes, establish the genomic population diversity, and define the nature of sequence evolution over time.Twenty-two sequential P. aeruginosa isolates were obtained within a 17-month period, before and after a double-lung transplant. At the end of the study period, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, whole genome sequencing (WGS), phylogenetic analyses and RNAseq were performed in order to understand the genetic basis of the observed resistance phenotypes, establish the genomic population diversity, and define the nature of sequence changes over time.The majority of isolates were resistant to almost all tested antibiotics. A phylogenetic reconstruction revealed 3 major clades representing a genotypically and phenotypically heterogeneous population. The pattern of mutation accumulation and variation of gene expression suggested that a group of closely related strains was present in the patient prior to transplantation and continued to change throughout the course of treatment. A trend toward accumulation of mutations over time was observed. Different mutations in the DNA mismatch repair gene mutL consistent with a hypermutator phenotype were observed in two clades. RNAseq performed on 12 representative isolates revealed substantial differences in the expression of genes associated with antibiotic resistance and virulence traits.The overwhelming current practice in the clinical laboratories setting relies on obtaining a pure culture and reporting the antibiogram from a few isolated colonies to inform therapy decisions. Our analyses revealed significant underlying genomic heterogeneity and unpredictable evolutionary patterns that were independent of prior antibiotic treatment, highlighting the need for comprehensive sampling and population-level analysis when gathering microbiological data in the context of CF P. aeruginosa chronic infection. Our findings challenge the applicability of antimicrobial stewardship programs based on single-isolate resistance profiles for the selection of antibiotic regimens in chronic infections such as CF."

However, molecular mechanisms towards salt tolerance and adaptation are largely rare. In this study, we carried out RNA-sequence and transcriptome analysis of T. ramosissima in response to NaCl stress, screened differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and further verified by qRT-PCR. Results showed that 105702 unigenes were spliced from the raw data of transcriptome sequencing, where 54238 unigenes were retrieved from KEGG, KOG, NR, and SwissProt. After 48 hours of NaCl treatment, the expression levels of 6374 genes were increased, and 5380 genes were decreased in leaves. After 168 hours, the expression levels of 3837 genes were up-regulated and 7808 genes were down-regulated. In particular, 8 transcription factors annotated to the KEGG Pathway were obtained, involving the WRKY and bZIP transcription family. In addition, KEGG pathway annotation showed that expression of 39 genes involved in ROS scavenging mechanisms were significantly changed, in which 21 genes were up-regulated and 18 genes were down-regulated after 48 hours as well as 15 genes were up-regulated and 24 genes were down-regulated after 168h. Simultaneously, the enzyme activities of SOD and POD were significantly enhanced under NaCl treatment, but the enzyme activity of CAT was not significantly enhanced. Moreover, WRKY, MYB and bZIP may participate in the process of salt resistance in T. ramosissima. This study provides gene resources and a theoretical basis for further molecular mechanisms of salt tolerance in T. ramosissima."

Understanding the impact of climate change on the potential geographic distribution of species, which is of great significance to the exploitation, utilization, and protection of resources, as well as ecologically sustainable development. Betula platyphylla Suk. is one of the most widely distributed temperate deciduous tree species in East Asia and has important economic and ecological value. Based on 231 species distribution data points of Betula platyphylla Suk. in China and 37 bioclimatic, soil, and topography variables (with correlation coefficients < 0.75), the potential geographical distribution pattern of Betula platyphylla Suk. under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) climate change scenarios at present and in the 2050s and 2070s was predicted using the MaxEnt model. We analyzed the main environmental variables affecting the distribution and change of suitable areas and compared the scope and change of suitable areas under different climate scenarios. This study found: (1) At present, the main suitable area for Betula platyphylla Suk. extends from northeastern to southwestern China, with the periphery area showing fragmented distribution. (2) Annual precipitation, precipitation of the warmest quarter, mean temperature of the warmest quarter, annual mean temperature, and precipitation of the driest month are the dominant environmental variables that affect the potential geographical distribution of Betula platyphylla Suk. (3) The suitable area for Betula platyphylla Suk. is expected to expand under global warming scenarios. In recent years, due to the impact of diseases and insect infestation, and environmental damage, the natural Betula platyphylla Suk. forest in China has gradually narrowed. This study accurately predicted the potential geographical distribution of Betula platyphylla Suk. under current and future climate change scenarios, which can provide the scientific basis for the cultivation, management, and sustainable utilization of Betula platyphylla Suk. resources."
https://openalex.org/W4220812713,"Anthropogenic fire use is widespread across Madagascar and threatens the island's unprecedented endemic biodiversity. The vast majority (96%) of lemur species are already threatened with extinction, and Madagascar has already lost more than 44% of its forests. Previous conservation assessments have noted the role of fire in the rampant deforestation and habitat degradation across Madagascar, but published, quantified data on fire use across the island are incredibly limited. Here, we present the first quantification of spatiotemporal patterns in fire occurrence across Madagascar using VIIRS satellite fire detection data. We assess which regions of Madagascar have the most prevalent fire use, how fire use is changing over time, and what this means for Madagascar's remaining forest ecosystems. An average of 356,189 fires were detected every year in Madagascar from 2012-2019, averaging 0.604 fires/km2. Fire use was near-ubiquitous across the island, but was most prevalent in the western dry deciduous forests and succulent woodlands ecoregions. Fire frequency in the eastern lowlands was highest around the remaining humid rainforest, and fire frequency was increasing over time around much of the remaining humid and dry forest. We found that 18.6% of all remaining forest was within 500 m of a fire within a single year, and 39.3% was within 1 km. More than half of remaining forest was within 1 km of a fire in a single year in the dry deciduous forests, succulent woodlands, and mangroves ecoregions. However, fire frequency within national park protected areas was, on average, 65% lower than their surroundings. Only 7.1% of national park forest was within 500 m of a fire within one year, and 17.1% was within 1 km, suggesting that national parks are effective at reducing fire frequency in Madagascar's tropical forests."
https://openalex.org/W4221022884,"Automatic detection of some pulmonary abnormalities using chest X-rays may be impacted adversely due to obscuring by bony structures like the ribs and the clavicles. Automated bone suppression methods would increase soft tissue visibility and enhance automated disease detection. We evaluate this hypothesis using a custom ensemble of convolutional neural network models, which we call DeBoNet, that suppresses bones in frontal CXRs. First, we train and evaluate variants of U-Nets, Feature Pyramid Networks, and other proposed custom models using a private collection of CXR images and their bone-suppressed counterparts. The DeBoNet, constructed using the top-3 performing models, outperformed the individual models in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) (36.7977±1.6207), multi-scale structural similarity index measure (MS-SSIM) (0.9848±0.0073), and other metrics. Next, the best-performing bone-suppression model is applied to CXR images that are pooled from several sources, showing no abnormality and other findings consistent with COVID-19. The impact of bone suppression is demonstrated by evaluating the gain in performance in detecting pulmonary abnormality consistent with COVID-19 disease. We observe that the model trained on bone-suppressed CXRs (MCC: 0.9645, 95% confidence interval (0.9510, 0.9780)) significantly outperformed (p < 0.05) the model trained on non-bone-suppressed images (MCC: 0.7961, 95% confidence interval (0.7667, 0.8255)) in detecting findings consistent with COVID-19 indicating benefits derived from automatic bone suppression on disease classification.

https://openalex.org/W4221120887,"The present study examined the association between risk perception and travel satisfaction related to the use of public transport (PT) during COVID-19 pandemic in Turin, Italy. A total of 448 PT users took part in an online survey conducted from January to March 2021. It investigated safety and risk perception related to the use of PT, and the users’ subjective experience, measured through the Satisfaction with Travel Scale (STS). These perceptions were compared for three time scenarios: before the pandemic, during the pandemic, and in the future at the end of the pandemic emergency. Results showed that COVID-19 influenced respondents risk perception both during the pandemic and in their projections about the future, especially for females. The risk of contagion from COVID-19 is perceived as higher inside a PT vehicle than in the adjacent/waiting spaces. Regarding travel satisfaction, the overall scores of the STS indicated that the pandemic has impacted reported well-being while travelling, both now and in the future. The dimension of activation shifted towards the negative pole and did not indicate a return to risk perception before the pandemic levels at the end of the crisis (especially for females). Respondents reported a significant decrease in their level of pleasure and satisfaction during the pandemic, but expect that in the future these levels will go back to the levels previously experienced. Regarding travel satisfaction, PT users aged 36 to 50 years reported the highest level of satisfaction, while younger users (18 to 35 years) reported the lowest degree of satisfaction in all three time scenarios. Overall, the results clearly pinpoint that health-related perceived risk is becoming a key determinant for PT use. Within this context, different dimensions of travel satisfaction proved to be impacted differently by the pandemic, for both current and future scenarios."
https://openalex.org/W4225615389,"During the seed aging process, reactive oxygen species (ROS) can induce the carbonylation of proteins, which changes their functional properties and affects seed vigor. However, the impact and regulatory mechanisms of protein carbonylation on wheat seed vigor are still unclear. In this study, we investigated the changes in wheat seed vigor, carbonyl protein content, ROS content and embryo cell structure during an artificial aging process, and we analyzed the correlation between protein carbonylation and seed vigor. During the artificial wheat-seed aging process, the activity levels of antioxidant enzymes and the contents of non-enzyme antioxidants decreased, leading to the accumulation of ROS and an increase in the carbonyl protein content, which ultimately led to a decrease in seed vigor, and there was a significant negative correlation between seed vigor and carbonyl protein content. Moreover, transmission electron microscopy showed that the contents of protein bodies in the embryo cells decreased remarkably. We postulate that during the wheat seed aging process, an imbalance in ROS production and elimination in embryo cells leads to the carbonylation of proteins, which plays a negative role in wheat seed vigor."
https://openalex.org/W4221130137,"Pregnancy induces changes in the transcriptome of the bovine endometrium from 15 days after insemination. However, pregnancy is less likely to occur if cows had a postpartum bacterial infection of the uterus, even after the resolution of disease. We hypothesized that uterine bacterial infection alters the endometrial transcriptomic signature of pregnancy after the resolution of disease. To examine the endometrial transcriptomic signature of pregnancy, cows were inseminated 130 days after intrauterine infusion of pathogenic Escherichia coli and Trueperella pyogenes, subsequently endometrium was collected 16 days after insemination for RNA sequencing. We found 171 pregnancy regulated genes in cows 146 days after bacterial infection. When comparing our findings with previous studies that described the endometrial transcriptomic signature of pregnancy in healthy cows, 24 genes were consistently differentially expressed in pregnancy, including MX1, MX2 and STAT1. However, 12 pregnancy regulated genes were found only in the endometrium of healthy cows, including ISG15 and TRANK1. Furthermore, 28 pregnancy regulated genes were found only in the endometrium of cows following bacterial infection and these were associated with altered iNOS, TLR, and IL-7 signaling pathways. Although 94 predicted upstream regulators were conserved amongst the studies, 14 were found only in the endometrium of pregnant healthy cows, and 5 were found only in cows following bacterial infection, including AIRE, NFKBIA, and DUSP1. In conclusion, there were both consistent and discordant features of the endometrial transcriptomic signature of pregnancy 146 days after intrauterine bacterial infusion. These findings imply that there is an essential transcriptomic signature of pregnancy, but that infection induces long-term changes in the endometrium that affect the transcriptomic response to pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W4220745695,"We investigated daily COVID-19 cases and deaths in the 337 lower tier local authority regions in England and Wales to better understand how the disease propagated over a 15-month period. Population density scaling models revealed residual variance and skewness to be sensitive indicators of the dynamics of propagation. Lockdowns and schools reopening coincided with increased variance indicative of conditions with local impact and country scale heterogeneity. University reopening and December holidays reduced variance indicative of country scale homogenisation which reached a minimum in mid-January 2021. Homogeneous propagation was associated with better correspondence with normally distributed residuals while heterogeneous propagation was more consistent with skewed models. Skewness varied from strongly negative to strongly positive revealing an unappreciated feature of community propagation. Hot spots and super-spreading events are well understood descriptors of regional disease dynamics that would be expected to be associated with positively skewed distributions. Positively skewed behaviour was observed; however, negative skewness indicative of ""cold-spots"" and ""super-isolation"" dominated for approximately 8 months during the period of study. In contrast, death metrics showed near constant behaviour in scaling, variance, and skewness metrics over the full period with rural regions preferentially affected, an observation consistent with regional age demographics in England and Wales. Regional positions relative to density scaling laws were remarkably persistent after the first 5-9 days of the available data set. The determinants of this persistent behaviour probably precede the pandemic and remain unchanged."
https://openalex.org/W4220757716,"An emotional categorisation task allows us to study how emotionality is understood and how emotional factors influence decisions. As emotionality is not only the valence but is also composed of activation (arousal and subjective significance) and the type of process needed to produce emotion (origin), we wanted to test the influence of these emotional factors on with a group of stimuli not differing in valence. We predicted that increasing activation levels should lead to increased classification of stimuli as emotional, with a focus on the late processing stages, when explicit word processing occurs, which on the electrophysiological level corresponds to P300, N450 and LPC components. The behavioural results showed that the emotionality of words increased with increasing levels of arousal and subjective significance. Automatically originated words were assessed as more emotional than reflective ones. The amplitude of the N450 component revealed dissociation for subjective significance and origin effects, showing that these two dimensions ascribe distinct properties of emotionality. Finally, the LPC component was susceptible to all affective dimensions used in manipulation. Our study showed that arousal, subjective significance and origin are dimensions of affect that shape the processing of words' emotionality, when the values of valence were aligned among the stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W4220901426,"Sentences can be enriched by considering what the speaker does not say but could have done, the alternative. We conducted two experiments to test whether the salience of the alternative contributes to how people derive implicatures. Participants responded true or false to underinformative categorical sentences that involved quantifiers. Target sentences were sometimes preceded by the alternative and sometimes by a control sentence. When the target was preceded by the alternative, response times to implicature responses were faster than when preceded by the control sentence. This suggests that (1) alternative salience influences higher-level reasoning (2) the cost of deriving implicatures in sentence verification paradigms is due in part to low alternative salience."
https://openalex.org/W4220828719,"Exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) during the first 6 months of life is widely promoted as a key strategy to enhance child health, growth, and development. Even though a high proportion of children in Kenya are currently breastfed exclusively, there is little evidence regarding the developmental benefits during the first year of life. This paper aims to fill this gap by establishing an association between EBF and early childhood developmental outcomes among children below the age of 6 months in Kenya.We used data collected as part of a cluster-randomized controlled trial conducted in Bondo sub-county in the western part of Kenya to assess the associations between EBF and development in the first year of life. The primary exposure variable was EBF, and the outcome variable was child development as measured by the Ages and Stages Questionnaire-Third Edition (ASQ-3).We analyzed data from 570 children aged below 6 months at the time of the interview. Breastfeeding children exclusively between 3 and 6 months was associated with 0.61 standard deviation (SD) higher ASQ-3 scores in the adjusted model. When specific domains were considered, in the adjusted models, EBF in the 3-6 months period was associated with 0.44 SD, 0.34 SD and 0.36 SD higher ASQ-3 scores in communication, gross motor, and problem solving domains, respectively. There were weak associations in the fine motor and social-emotional domains.EBF in the 3- to 6-month age range has significant positive associations with child development, especially for communication, gross motor, and problem-solving. Programs encouraging mothers to continue EBF in this period may have substantial benefits for children."
https://openalex.org/W4221058469,"In many Gram-negative bacteria, the stress sigma factor of RNA polymerase, σS/RpoS, remodels global gene expression to reshape the physiology of quiescent cells and ensure their survival under non-optimal growth conditions. In the foodborne pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, σS is also required for biofilm formation and virulence. We have previously identified sRNAs genes positively controlled by σS in Salmonella, including the two paralogous sRNA genes, ryhB1 and ryhB2/isrE. Expression of ryhB1 and ryhB2 is repressed by the ferric uptake regulator Fur when iron is available. In this study, we show that σS alleviates Fur-mediated repression of the ryhB genes and of additional Fur target genes. Moreover, σS induces transcription of the manganese transporter genes mntH and sitABCD and prevents their repression, not only by Fur, but also by the manganese-responsive regulator MntR. These findings prompted us to evaluate the impact of a ΔrpoS mutation on the Salmonella ionome. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry analyses revealed a significant effect of the ΔrpoS mutation on the cellular concentration of manganese, magnesium, cobalt and potassium. In addition, transcriptional fusions in several genes involved in the transport of these ions were regulated by σS. This study suggests that σS controls fluxes of ions that might be important for the fitness of quiescent cells. Consistent with this hypothesis, the ΔrpoS mutation extended the lag phase of Salmonella grown in rich medium supplemented with the metal ion chelator EDTA, and this effect was abolished when magnesium, but not manganese or iron, was added back. These findings unravel the importance of σS and magnesium in the regrowth potential of quiescent cells."
https://openalex.org/W4220748483,"Background Serostudies are important resources when following pandemics and predicting their further spread, as well as determining the length of protection against reinfection and vaccine development. The aim of this study was to update data on the prevalence of seropositive individuals in Canton Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina (B&amp;H) from September 2020 to May 2021. Methods Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were quantified using an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. Results Compared to the period April–July 2020, when anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected in 3.77% of samples, one year later (May 2021) the estimated percentage within the same population of the urban Canton Sarajevo was 29.9% (5,406/18,066). Of all anti-SARS-CoV-2 Ig-positive individuals, 53.27% were men, and 69.00% were of 50 years of age or younger. Also, the current update found the individuals 50 years of age or younger to be more frequently anti-SARS-CoV-2 Ig positive compared to older individuals. On the other hand, higher median anti-SARS-CoV-2 Ig levels were found in individuals &gt; 50 years old than in younger individuals, as well as in men compared to women. Seropositivity gradually increased from September 2020 to May 2021, with the lowest frequency of positive cases (3.5%) observed in September 2020, and the highest frequency (77.7%) in January 2021. Conclusion Our results provided important seroprevalence data that could help in planning restrictive local public health measures to protect the population of Sarajevo Canton, especially considering that at the time of the study the vaccines were virtually inaccessible to the general population not belonging to any of the high-priority groups for vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W4220865273,"The purpose of this research was to establish the optimal recovery duration following a pre-load stimulus on performance measures related to handball players. Seventeen senior male University handball players (mean ± SD: age 23.6 ± 2.3 yrs., height 1.79 ± 0.06 m and body mass 72.5 ± 10.7 kg) performed three experimental sessions. All sessions consisted of a standardised warm-up followed by a pre-load stimulus (HSR) back squats followed by a passive rest for either 4-min (PAP4), 8-min (PAP8), or 12-min (PAP12). Following the completion of the passive recovery, players then performed a countermovement jump (CMJ), a 20-m linear sprint and a modified agility t-test. The significance level was set at P < 0.05. There was a significant main effect of passive rest duration after the pre-load stimulus. The PAP12 condition improved CMJ scores (2.3-2.6%; effect size = small), 20-m linear sprint times (3.3-3.7%; effect size = small to moderate) and agility times (1.6-1.9%; effect size = trivial) compared to PAP4 and PAP8 conditions (P < 0.0005). Values of heart rate and rating of perceived exertion were also significantly lower during the PAP12 condition compared to the PAP4 and PAP8 conditions (P < 0.0005). A positive Pearson correlation was established between agility and CMJ for all conditions (P < 0.001). The findings provide novel data observing that a pre-load stimulus, followed by 12-min of recovery, results in greater maximal jump, sprint and agility measures when compared with a 4-min or 8-min recovery in male handball players."
https://openalex.org/W4220896127,"Methylmalonic aciduria (MMA), a rare inherited disorder, is the most common organic aciduria in China, and prenatal diagnosis has contributed to its prevention. However, the prenatal diagnosis of MMA using cultured amniocytes or chorionic villi to detect gene mutations is exclusively applicable to families with a definite genetic diagnosis. To evaluate the reliability of mass spectrometry assays for the prenatal diagnosis of MMA, we conducted a retrospective study of our 10 years' experience.This retrospective compare study reviewed the medical records for maternal and fetuses data for 287 mothers with a family history of MMA from June 2010 to December 2020. Methylmalonate and propionylcarnitine in cell-free amniotic fluid were measured using a stable isotope dilution method (GC/MS) and MS/MS-based method (LC/MS/MS). Total homocysteine (tHcy) was measured by fluorescence polarization immunoassay. Depending on the presence of disease-causing gene mutations in probands, gene studies on amniocytes from 222 pregnant women were performed.For 222 fetuses of the families with definite genetic diagnosis, gene analyses were performed using cultured amniocytes. 52 fetuses were affected by MMA, whereas 170 were ""unaffected"". For GC/MS and LC/MS/MS, the specificity was 96.5% and 95.9%, sensitivity was 71.2% and 84.6%, respectively. The positive and negative predictive values were 86.0% and 91.6% and 86.3% and 95.3%, respectively. Propionylcarnitine/butyrylcarnitine ratio showed the highest accuracy and could thus serve as a sensitive indicator to identify those at a risk for MMA. When GC/MS and LC/MS/MS were performed in parallel, the specificity was 92.5% and sensitivity was 95.6%. When evaluating tHcy, the positive and negative predictive values were 95.0% and 96.1%, respectively. In 65 fetuses without family genetic diagnosis, 11 were finally confirmed to have MMA and 54 were ""unaffected"" by amniotic fluid biochemical assays. The 54 children showed normal urine organic acids and healthy development after birth.Amniotic fluid biochemical assays using GC/MS and LC/MS/MS in parallel increased the accuracy of prenatal diagnosis of MMA. Propionylcarnitine is a more reliable marker than methylmalonic acid in amniotic fluid. Further, tHcy is recommended for the prenatal diagnosis of combined MMA and homocysteinemia."

A high volume of pretravel consultation, prior training, middle age group, and medical degree from non-Arab countries were significant predictors of higher ‎knowledge. Continuing ‎education and training provided by recognised international institutions for all PCPs is highly ‎recommended to narrow the gap in travel medicine knowledge."
https://openalex.org/W4220985853,"Since the early 2000s, unconventional natural gas development (UNGD) has rapidly grown throughout Pennsylvania. UNGD extracts natural gas using a relatively new method known as hydraulic fracturing (HF). Here we addressed the association of HF with asthma Hospitalization Admission Rates (HAR) using publicly available data. Using public county-level data from the Pennsylvania Department of Health (PA-DOH) and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection for the years 2001-2014, we constructed regression models to study the previously observed association between asthma exacerbation and HF. After considering multicollinearity, county-level demographics and area-level covariables were included to account for known asthma risk factors. We found a significant positive association between the asthma HAR and annual well density for all the counties in the state (3% increase in HAR attributable to HF, p<0.001). For a sensitivity analysis, we excluded urban counties (urban counties have higher asthma exacerbations) and focused on rural counties for the years 2005-2014 and found a significant association (3.31% increase in HAR attributable to HF in rural counties, p<0.001). An even stronger association was found between asthma hospitalization admission rates (HAR) and PM2.5 levels (7.52% increase in HAR attributable to PM2.5, p<0.001). As expected, asthma HAR was significantly higher in urban compared to rural counties and showed a significant racial disparity. We conclude that publicly available data at the county-level supports an association between an increase in asthma HAR and UNGD in rural counties in Pennsylvania."

Our goals were to validate these ""hemodynamic profiles"" in an external cohort and assess their association with clinical outcomes.AHF patients (n = 257) from five EDs were prospectively enrolled in the validation cohort (VC). Cardiac index and SVRI were measured with a ClearSight finger-cuff monitor (formerly NexFin, Edwards Lifesciences) as in a previous study (derivation cohort, DC, n = 127). A control cohort (CC, n = 127) of ED patients with sepsis was drawn from the same study as the DC. K-means cluster analysis previously derived two-dimensional (cardiac index and SVRI) hemodynamic profiles in the DC and CC (k = 3 profiles each). The VC was subgrouped de novo into three analogous profiles by unsupervised K-means consensus clustering. PERMANOVA tested whether VC profiles 1-3 differed from profiles 1-3 in the DC and CC, by multivariate group composition of cardiac index and vascular tone. Profiles in the VC were compared by a primary outcome of 90-day mortality and a 30-day ranked composite secondary outcome (death, mechanical cardiac support, intubation, new/emergent dialysis, coronary intervention/surgery) as time-to-event (survival analysis) and binary events (odds ratio, OR). Descriptive statistics were used to compare profiles by two validated risk scores for the primary outcome, and one validated score for the secondary outcome.The VC had median age 60 years (interquartile range {49-67}), and was 45% (n = 116) female. Multivariate profile composition by cardiac index and vascular tone differed significantly between VC profiles 1-3 and CC profiles 1-3 (p = 0.001, R2 = 0.159). A difference was not detected between profiles in the VC vs. the DC (p = 0.59, R2 = 0.016). VC profile 3 had worse 90-day survival than profiles 1 or 2 (HR = 4.8, 95%CI 1.4-17.1). The ranked secondary outcome was more likely in profile 1 (OR = 10.0, 1.2-81.2) and profile 3 (12.8, 1.7-97.9) compared to profile 2. Diabetes prevalence and blood urea nitrogen were lower in the high-risk profile 3 (p<0.05). No significant differences between profiles were observed for other clinical variables or the 3 clinical risk scores.Hemodynamic profiles in ED patients with AHF, by non-invasive finger-cuff monitoring of cardiac index and vascular tone, were replicated de novo in an external cohort. Profiles showed significantly different risks of clinically-important adverse patient outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4220709259,"Empirical evidence on the responsiveness and sensitivities of food consumption to its drivers is vital for conducting economic studies. Despite recent attempts to provide such estimates, much empirical work remains to be done considering the prevailing shifts in consumption trends in the Philippines. Price and expenditure elasticities are estimated for seven food categories for rural and urban Filipino households, using Stone–Lewbel (SL) price indices and the quadratic almost-ideal demand system (QUAIDS) model. We used multiple years (2006, 2009, 2012, 2015, and 2018) of the Philippines Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES) to estimate the food demand system. The results show that rice is a normal good for most households, particularly for rural consumers. However, it is an inferior good for the top 30% of rural Filipinos and the top 40% of urban Filipinos. As income increases, such wealthy households tend to replace their rice-dominated diet with nutrient-dense food products. Female-headed households, younger households, and households with educated members consume significantly more animal proteins such as meat and dairy products."
https://openalex.org/W4220715509,"With this work we introduce a novel memristor in a lateral geometry whose resistive switching behaviour unifies the capabilities of bipolar switching with decelerated diffusive switching showing a biologically plausible short-term memory. A new fabrication route is presented for achieving lateral nano-scaled distances by depositing a sparse network of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) via spin-coating of a custom-made CNT dispersion. Electrochemical metallization-type (ECM) resistive switching is obtained by implanting AgAu nanoparticles with a Haberland-type gas aggregation cluster source into the nanogaps between the CNTs and shows a hybrid behaviour of both diffusive and bipolar switching. The resistance state resets to a high resistive state (HRS) either if the voltage is removed with a retention time in the second- to sub-minute scale (diffusive) or by applying a reverse voltage (bipolar). Furthermore, the retention time is positively correlated to the duration of the Set voltage pulse. The potential for low-voltage operation makes this approach a promising candidate for short-term memory applications in neuromorphic circuits. In addition, the lateral fabrication approach opens the pathway towards integrating sensor-functionality and offers a general starting point for the scalable fabrication of nanoscaled devices."
https://openalex.org/W4220745937,"Despite the increasing popularity of faculty-undergraduate research, a dearth of research has investigated factors that predict the professional outcomes of these collaborations. We sought to address this gap by examining a wide range of institutional (e.g., institution type, selectivity, course load) and faculty variables (e.g., rank, years of experience, enjoyment of mentoring) potentially related to coauthored undergraduate publication and conference presentation in psychology. Negative binomial regressions were used to analyze online survey data from 244 faculty members from both graduate-serving institutions (i.e., doctoral, master’s) and primarily undergraduate institutions. The results showed that, after controlling for overall research productivity, faculty at primarily undergraduate institutions were more likely to publish journal articles with undergraduates, whereas faculty at graduate-serving institutions were more likely to coauthor conference presentations with undergraduates. Institutions with higher selectivity, more support for faculty-undergraduate research, and lower course loads produced higher numbers of undergraduate publications. Faculty characteristics were even more strongly related to undergraduate research outcomes. Specifically, publication was most likely with faculty who are of higher rank, have more years of experience, spend more time on research, foster close collaborative relationships with undergraduates, and/or perceive their students as high quality and well trained. By contrast, conference presentation was most likely with faculty who work with more undergraduate students on more projects per year and/or who enjoying mentoring undergraduates. Our findings suggest ways that institutions can facilitate undergraduate publication, which we argue is an increasingly common and achievable outcome."
https://openalex.org/W4220752470,"Fishing fleets and targeted stocks are the basis for the design of multiannual management plans at European or Mediterranean levels. Management Strategy Evaluation and bioeconomic modeling need data at a specific level of resolution in terms of time, area and type of fishing activity for analyzing measures for management procedures using simulations. Within the Data Collection Framework, data are to be aggregated at different levels, e.g.: fleet segment and métier, the former linked to the predominant gear and the size of the vessel and the latter to the activity itself. Fishing costs are collected by fleet segment, effort and landings by fleet segment and métier. Bioeconomic modeling for management purposes requires data at the same resolution. The aim of this paper is to describe a methodology, implemented in SECFISH R package, to disaggregate variable cost data from the fleet segment to the métier level. The presented tool allows to determine the correlation between the variable costs of a vessel and its activities to estimate costs at the activity level (e.g. métiers). The tool is applied to selected Italian fleet segments characterized by a variety of métiers and high dynamicity."
https://openalex.org/W4220753240,"Under the background of ""the Belt and Road"" and ""the economic corridor of China, Mongolia and Russia"" initiatives, it is of great significance to study the temporal and spatial economic pattern in the Russian Federation. Based on the economic development difference index, regional economic grade index, global trend analysis tool and spatial autocorrelation model, this paper analyzes the temporal and spatial pattern evolution characteristics of Russian economic differences from 2002 to 2020. The results are as following. First, although the economic imbalance among various federal subjects has been decreasing, the economic polarization has been still severe between the prosperous developed regions and the stagnant backward regions during 2002-2020. Russia's economy shows a trend of changing from significant positive correlation in strong agglomeration space to positive correlation in weak agglomeration space, and then to random distribution. Second, there has been great differences of the economic development among various federal subjects. The economic grade of the Russian federal subjects presents a significant spatial differentiation pattern. The Russian Federation's economic resources are concentrated in the first-class federal subject (Moscow City), second-class federal subjects (Tumen Region, Moscow Region and Saint-Petersburg city) and a few third-class federal subjects (Yamalo-Nenetsky Autonomous Area, Khanty-Mansiysky Autonomous Area, Republic of Tatarstan, Krasnodar Territory, Sverdlovsk Region, etc). Third, the Russian Federation's economy presents ""High Core, Low Periphery"", ""High West, Low East"" and ""High south, Low north"" spatial differentiation pattern. The economic hot regions coincide with the high-class economic regions, which are mainly distributed in the contiguous areas of Ural Federal District and Volga Federal District, as well as the Moscow City, Moscow Region, Saint-Petersburg city, Krasnodar Territory and Rostov Region. The economic cold regions coincide with the low-class economic regions, which are mainly located in the Far East Federal District, the east of Siberian Federal District, the north of North West Federal District and the south of North-Caucasian Federal District. Finally, we suggest the recommendation for policy makers in Russia. And we propose the future research ideas."
https://openalex.org/W4220762861,"Ritodrine hydrochloride is used for pregnancy prolongation and intrauterine fetal resuscitation. However, its clinical significance in intraamniotic inflammation during preterm labor and intrauterine fetal distress is unclear. We investigated the effects of maternal ritodrine hydrochloride administration (MRA; 200 μg/min for 2 h, followed by 800 μg/min for 2 h after 24 h) on fetal physiological parameters. For this purpose, we used chronically instrumented pregnant sheep at 113-119 d (term = 145 d) of gestation without (Group 1, n = 5) and with (Group 2, n = 5) intraamniotic inflammation induced by lipopolysaccharide injection into the amniotic cavity. The changes in fetal heart rate (FHR) and short-term variability (STV) and long-term variability (LTV) in FHR, fetal blood pressure, and fetal arterial blood gas (FABG) values were measured before and at 1 and 2 h after initiating MRA. Before MRA, all parameters were similar between Groups 1 and 2; however, there was significantly higher STV in Group 2 than in Group 1 before MRA at 800 μg/min, significantly higher partial arterial pressure of carbon dioxide in FABG in Group 2 than in Group 1 before MRA at 200 μg/min, and significantly lower blood glucose (BG) in Group 2 than in Group 1 before MRA at 800 μg/min. One hour after MRA, the FHR, STV, and LTV were significantly higher at 800 μg/min than those at the baseline in Group 1, as determined by the Friedman test; however, no significant difference was observed in Group 2. Additionally, the FABG pH significantly decreased 1 h after MRA at 800 μg/min in Group 2, whereas FABG lactate and BG significantly increased 2 h after MRA at 800 μg/min in Groups 1 and 2. Thus, short-term MRA at 800 μg/min increased the FHR, STV, and LTV significantly; these values were further modified under intraamniotic inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W4220818501,"One of the methods to improve the structural design of concrete is by updating the factors given in standard codes, especially when non-conventional materials are used in concrete beams. Accordingly, this study focuses on the colorations between the compressive strength and shear strength of high-strength concrete beams with and without steel fibers. For that purpose, different models are proposed to predict shear strength of high-strength concrete beams, by taking different combinations of the main variables: beam cross-section dimension (width and effective depth), reinforcement index, concrete compressive strength, shear span ratio, and steel fiber properties (volumetric content, fiber aspect ratio, and type of steel fibers). Multi-linear and non-linear regression analyses are used with large database experimental results found in the literature. The predicted results from the proposed equations are composed with different available models from codes, standards, and literatures. The calculated results showed better correlations and were close enough to the experimental data. Based on the data given in the standard codes, the shear strength is proportional to compressive strength ([Formula: see text]) of the power 0.5. However, this value may not be adequate for modern cement and concrete containing steel fibers. Therefore, the mentioned power value must be reduced 5 times to 0.1."
https://openalex.org/W4220853009,"Tuberculosis lymphadenitis (TBLN) diagnosis is often challenging in most resource poor settings. Often cytopathologic diagnosis of TBLN suspected patients is inconclusive impeding timely clinical management of TBLN suspected patients, further exposing suspected patients either for unnecessary use of antibiotics or empirical treatment. This may lead to inappropriate treatment outcome or more suffering of suspected patients from the disease. In this study, an integrated diagnostic approach has been evaluated to elucidate its utility in the identification of TBLN suspected patients.A cross-sectional study was conducted on 96 clinically diagnosed TBLN suspected patients, where fine needle aspirate (FNA) samples were collected at the time of diagnosis. FNA cytology, Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN), Auramine O (AO) staining, GeneXpert MTB/RIF and Real time PCR (RT-PCR) were performed on concentrated FNA samples. Considering culture as a gold standard, the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were calculated. Cohen's Kappa value was used to measure interrater variability and level of agreement and a P-value of <0.05 was considered as statistically significant.Out of the 96 FNA sample, 12 (12.5%) were identified to have Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) using ZN staining, 27 (28.1%) using AO staining, 51 (53.2%) using FNAC, 43 (44.7%) using GeneXpert MTB/RIF, 51 (53.1%) using Real time PCR (RT-PCR) and 36 (37.5%) using Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ) culture. Compared to LJ culture, the sensitivities of GeneXpert MTB/RIF, RT-PCR, and FNAC were 91.7%, 97.2%, and 97.2%, respectively and the specificities were 83.3%, 73.3%, and 68.3%, respectively. GeneXpert MTB/RIF and RT-PCR when combined with FNAC detected 61 (63.5%) cases as having Mtb, and the sensitivity and specificity was 100% and 58.3%, respectively.FNA cytology and RT-PCR detected more TBLN cases compared to other Mtb detection tools and the detection sensitivity even improved when FNA cytology was combined with GeneXpert MTB/RIF, performed on concentrated FNA sample, suggesting the combined tests as an alternative approach for improved diagnosis of TBLN."

https://openalex.org/W4220954938,"Aortic aneurysm/dissection (AAD) is now encountered more often because of the increasing prevalence of atherosclerosis and hypertension in the population. Despite many therapeutic improvements, in particular timely and successful surgery, in-hospital mortality rates are still higher. Timely identification of patients at high risk will help improve the overall prognosis of AAD. Since early clinical and radiological signs are nonspecific, there is an urgent need for accurate biomarkers. Smooth muscle 22α (SM22α) is a potential marker for AAD because of its abundant expression in vascular smooth muscle, which is involved in development of AAD.We prepared three different mouse models, including abdominal aortic aneurysm, neointimal hyperplasia and atherosclerosis. SM22α levels were assessed in serum and vascular tissue of the mice. Next, the relationships between serum SM22α level and vascular lesion were studied in mice. Finally, serum from 41 patients with AAD, 107 carotid artery stenosis (CAS) patients and 40 healthy volunteers were tested for SM22α. Serum levels of SM22α were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).Compared with the controls, serum SM22α levels were reduced in the models of aortic aneurysm, neointimal formation and atherosclerosis, and elevated in mice with ruptured aneurysm. Serum SM22α level was negatively correlated with apoptosis rate of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), ratio of intima/ media (I/M) area and plaque size. Patients with AAD had significantly higher serum SM22α levels than patients with only CAS, or normal controls.Serum SM22α could be a potential predictive marker for AAD, and regulation of VSMC is a possible mechanism for the effects of SM22α."
https://openalex.org/W4220964857,"In the processes that give rise to new species, changes first occur at the population level. But with the continuous nature of the divergence process, change in biological properties delimiting the shift from ""individuals of divergent populations"" towards ""individuals of distinct species"", as well as abiotic factors driving the change, remain largely ambivalent. Here we study diversification processes at the population level in a semi-aquatic frog, Mantidactylus (Brygoomantis) bellyi, across the diverse vegetation types of Montagne d'Ambre National Park (MANP), Madagascar. Genetic diversity was assessed with seven newly developed microsatellite markers as well as mitochondrial DNA sequences and concordance with patterns of ecological, morphological, and bioacoustic divergence evaluated. We found M. bellyi lacking mitochondrial differentiation within MANP, while microsatellite datasets partitioned them into three highly differentiated, geographically separated subpopulations (with indications for up to five subpopulations). The molecular grouping-primarily clustering individuals by geographic proximity-was coincident with differences in mean depth and width of waters, suggesting a possible role of fluvial characteristics in genetic exchange in this stream-breeding species. Genetic clustering not consistent with differences in call properties, except for dominant call frequencies under the two-subpopulations model. Morphological divergence was mostly consistent with the genetic clustering; subpopulations strongly differed by their snout-vent length, with individuals from high-elevation subpopulations smaller than those from populations below 1000 m above sea level. These results exemplify how mountains and environmental conditions might primarily shape genetic and morphological divergence in frog populations, without strongly affecting their calls."

The purpose of this retrospective study was to examine the role of regulatory T cell (Treg) activity in tumor immunity and investigate the tumor microenvironment as a new treatment focus in conjunctival SCC. Cancer progression gene array and immunohistochemical analyses of FOXP3 as a Treg marker, CD8 as a tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte marker, and CXCR4 expression on activated Tregs were conducted in a series of 31 conjunctival SCC cases. The objective was to investigate the immunoreactive response in tumor cells and stromal cells in the cancer microenvironment. The stroma ratio in tumor cells was investigated by monitoring α-smooth muscle actine (SMA) expression between carcinoma in situ (Tis) and advanced carcinoma (Tadv) (P<0.01). No significant change in PD-L1 expression was observed in this study (P = 0.15). Staining patterns of FOXP3, CD8, and CXCR4 were examined separately between tumor cells and stromal cells in SCC tumors. Differences in staining of FOXP3 in Tregs and CD8 in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in tumor stroma in the Tis group were observed compared with the Tadv group (each P<0.01). In addition, double immunostaining of CXCR4/FOXP3 was correlated with progression-free survival (P = 0.049). Double immunostaining of CXCR4/FOXP3 correlated with American Joint Committee on Cancer T-stage, independent of age or Ki67 index (P<0.01). Our results show that FOXP3 and the CXCR4/FOXP3 axis are important pathologic and prognostic factors of ocular surface neoplasia, including SCC. The tumor microenvironment of conjunctival SCC should be considered in the future development of treatment options."

Recent studies also indicate a strong correlation between ambient air pollution and COVID-19 cases, which have affected the lives of billions of people globally. Abatement technologies such as ionic and other high efficiency filtration systems are expensive and unaffordable in communities with limited resources. The goal of this study was to develop a mask with an optimized nanoparticle coating which has a dual capability of particulate matter and virus filtration, while being affordable and safe for human use. The nanoparticles were selected for their filtration and virucidal capabilities. Particle filtration efficiency, tested with a wind tunnel and PM2.5 from incense sticks measured by laser particle detectors, improved by ~60% with nanoparticle coatings on KN95 and surgical masks. Virus filtration efficiency, tested using nebulized NaCl particles as a virus surrogate, improved by 95% with coated masks. The nanoparticle retention efficacy, tested by simulating a normal 8-hour workday, was well within the permissible exposure limits. This technology has several applications such as in personal protective equipment for virus protection, and in air-conditioning and car cabin filters for pollution abatement. In conclusion, the chosen combination of nanoparticles provides an effective and safe solution for both particulate matter and viral particle filtration."

PCR based LOS locus type identification for C. jejuni clinical isolates from a UK hospital as well as in silico LOS locus analysis for C. jejuni and C. coli genome sequences from GenBank was carried out to determine the frequencies of various LOS genotypes in C. jejuni and C. coli. Analysis of LOS gene content in 60 clinical C. jejuni isolates and 703 C. jejuni genome sequences revealed that class B (Group 1) was the most abundant LOS class in C. jejuni. The hierarchy of C. jejuni LOS group prevalence (group 1 > group 2 > group 3 > group 4) as well as the hierarchy of the frequency of C. jejuni LOS classes present within the group 1 (B > C > A > R > M > V), group 2 (H/P > O > E > W), group 3 (F > K > S) and group 4 (G > L) was identified. In silico analysis of LOS gene content in 564 C. coli genome sequences showed class III as the most abundant LOS locus type in C. coli. In silico analysis of LOS gene content also identified three novel LOS types of C. jejuni and previously unknown LOS biosynthesis genes in C. coli LOS locus types I, II, III, V and VIII.

Estimating the age of initiation of cigarillo use among young adults may inform the timing of prevention interventions.Weighted interval-censored survival analyses of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) young adult (ages 18-24 at their first wave of adult participation) annual datasets were conducted (2013-2017). Young adult never cigarillo users (n = 7,101; represents N = 24,023,488) at their first wave of adult participation (2013-2016) were followed-up through 2014-2017 to estimate the age of initiation of ever, past 30-day and fairly regular cigarillo use outcomes. Differences by sex and by race/ethnicity, accounting for previous use of other tobacco products and marijuana and blunt use, were assessed using weighted interval-censored Cox proportional hazards models.Among PATH young adults, by age 21, 5.8% initiated ever cigarillo use, 4.1% initiated past 30-day cigarillo use, and 1.4% initiated fairly regular cigarillo use. By age 26, 15% initiated ever cigarillo use, and 10.4% initiated past 30-day cigarillo use.

https://openalex.org/W4221058606,"Praying for others in the wake of a disasters is a common interpersonal and public response to tragedy in the United States. But these gestures are controversial. In a survey experiment, we elicit how people value receiving a prayer from a Christian stranger in support of a recent hardship and examine factors that affect the value of the prayer. We find that people who positively value receiving the prayer do so primarily because they believe it provides emotional support and will be answered by God. Many also value the prayer because they believe it will improve their health and wealth, although empirical support of such effects is lacking. People who negatively value receiving the prayer do so primarily because they believe praying is a waste of time. The negative value is particularly large if people are offended by religion. Finally, the hardship experienced by the prayer recipient matters to the intensity by which recipients like or dislike the gesture, suggesting the benefit of prayers varies not only across people, but also across contexts."
https://openalex.org/W4225489350,"Administrative division adjustments, such as agglomerations, upgrading, and revocation, introduce a series of uncertain impacts on the social and economic development in administrative regions. Previous studies have focused more on the economic effects of administrative division adjustments, but in this paper, we also consider the environmental effects of such adjustments. In 2011, with the approval of the State Council, the prefecture-level Chaohu city was officially revoked, resulting in a county-level Chaohu city. One district and four counties under the jurisdiction of the original Chaohu city were placed under the jurisdiction of Hefei, Wuhu, and Ma'anshan. This adjustment made Chaohu Lake an inner lake of Hefei city. The administrative division adjustment of Chaohu Lake, China, is used as a quasi-natural experiment to explore the influence of such an adjustment on pollution control. The synthetic control method (SCM) is used in this study to evaluate the effect of the administrative division adjustment on the water quality indicators of Chaohu Lake. The following conclusions are drawn. First, after the administrative division adjustment, some water quality indicators, such as ammonia nitrogen, improved; however, other major pollution indicators, such as chemical oxygen demand (COD) and dissolved oxygen (DO), worsened to varying degrees. Second, the results reveal that improper development ideas, excessive industrial expansion, and the shift in economic growth and environmental goals were problems after the adjustment. Returning to the original intention of the administrative division adjustment, rationalizing the Chaohu Lake management system and designing a sound and feasible accountability mechanism are fundamental measures for reducing pollution."

Depression is a contributor to the global burden of disease and affects people in prisons in particular. There were limited studies on depression among prisoners. Therefore, the study aimed to assess the magnitude of depression and factors associated with it among prisoners in Wollega Zones Prisons, western Ethiopia. Methods Institutional based cross-sectional study was conducted on randomly selected 368 prisoners from June 1, 2019, up to August 1, 2019, in Wollega zones prisons. Data were collected by trained data collectors through interviewer-administered questionnaires. Data were entered into EpiData version 3.1 and analyzed using SPSS version 20. Bivariable and Multivariable logistic regression model was computed to identify factors associated with depressive symptoms. In the final model, the strength of the association between independent variables and depression was measured using the Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) with the corresponding 95% Confidence Interval (CI). Then, in the final model, variables having a p-value of less than 0.05 were considered factors significantly associated with depression. Results Of the total study respondents, 166/368 (45.1%) had symptoms of depression. Lack of job opportunity in prison (AOR = 6.64, 95%CI: 3.65, 12.06), not attending religious place at all (AOR = 3.51, 95%CI: 1.30,10.00), and Unsentenced for suspected crime (AOR = 7.36, 95%CI: 2.08, 26.04) were associated with depression. Conclusion and recommendation This finding showed that the magnitude of depression in prisons was high. Prisoners in the young age group, attending religious places, being married, prisoners who were sentenced for suspected crime on timely and prisoners performing work in prison were less likely to have depression. The prison institution needs to facilitate income-generating activities in prison, promoting prisoners to attend their religious places and promoting timely sentencing."
https://openalex.org/W4220707243,"Gibbons (Family Hylobatidae) are a suitable model for exploring hybridization in pair-living primates as several species form hybrid zones. In Khao Yai National Park, Thailand, white-handed gibbons (Hylobates lar) and pileated gibbons (Hylobates pileatus) are distributed parapatrically and hybridize in a narrow zone. Their phenotypic characteristics suggest limited inter-species gene flow, although this has never been assessed. To uncover the history and degree of gene flow between the two species, we studied the genetic structure of gibbons in the hybrid zone by analyzing fecal DNA samples, phenotypic characteristics, vocalizations and individuals' social status. We determined eight autosomal single nucleotide variant (SNV) loci, and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and Y-chromosomal haplotypes of 72 gibbons. We compared these markers with reference types of wild pureblood white-handed gibbons (n = 12) in Kaeng Krachan National Park and pureblood pileated gibbons (n = 4) in Khao Soi Dao Wildlife Sanctuary. Autosomal genotypic analyses confirmed the various levels of mixed ancestry for several adult gibbons with or without atypical phenotypic traits in Khao Yai National Park. In some other adult gibbons, the mixed ancestry was not detected in either autosomal SNVs or their phenotypic traits but the mtDNA. Both male and female adult hybrids formed reproductive units mainly with a phenotypic pureblood partner and many of them produced offspring. Taken together, our results suggest that once hybridization occurs, white-handed-pileated-gibbon hybrids can reproduce with either parental species and that the backcrossing and thus introgression may occur in successive generations, with no drastic changes in phenotypic appearance."

Research generated close to practice and in collaboration with end users is an approach that is recognised as an effective strategy to facilitate an improvement in the relevance and use of health research as well as building research capacity amongst end users. The Research Translation Projects (RTP) program funded by the Western Australian (WA) Department of Health facilitates clinical and academic collaboration through competitive funding of short-term research projects. Its aim is to improve healthcare practice while also finding efficiencies that can be delivered to the WA health system. A mixed methods approach was adopted to evaluate the research impact of the RTP program, at completion of the two-year funding period, across a range of impact domains through the adaptation and application of the Canadian Academy of Health Sciences' (CAHS) framework for research impact. In addition, further analysis was undertaken to address specific objectives of the RTP program more closely, in particular research capacity building and collaboration and health system Inefficiencies targeted by the program. Social network analysis was applied to assess the extent and growth of collaboration across WA health organisations over time. Results indicated that the 'bottom up' approach to research translation has triggered modest, yet positive outcomes across impact domains including advancing knowledge, collaboration and capacity building as well as contributing to changes in policy and practice. Additionally, the projects identified opportunities by which inefficiencies in the health system can be addressed. Further work is required to better understand the pathways by which short-term outcomes can be translated into more long-term impacts and the mechanisms that trigger this process."

https://openalex.org/W4220760680,"We designed a novel strategy to define codon usage bias (CUB) in 6 specific small cohorts of human genes. We calculated codon usage (CU) values in 29 non-disease-causing (NDC) and 31 disease-causing (DC) human genes which are highly expressed in 3 distinct tissues, kidney, muscle, and skin. We applied our strategy to the same selected genes annotated in 15 mammalian species. We obtained CUB hierarchical clusters for each gene cohort which showed tissue-specific and disease-specific CUB fingerprints. We showed that DC genes (especially those expressed in muscle) display a low CUB, well recognizable in codon hierarchical clustering. We defined the extremely biased codons as “zero codons” and found that their number is significantly higher in all DC genes, all tissues, and that this trend is conserved across mammals. Based on this calculation in different gene cohorts, we identified 5 codons which are more differentially used across genes and mammals, underlining that some genes have favorite synonymous codons in use. Since of the muscle genes clear clusters, and, among these, dystrophin gene surprisingly does not show any “zero codon” we adopted a novel approach to study CUB, we called “mapping-on-codons”. We positioned 2828 dystrophin missense and nonsense pathogenic variations on their respective codon, highlighting that its frequency and occurrence is not dependent on the CU values. We conclude our strategy consents to identify a hierarchical clustering of CU values in a gene cohort-specific fingerprints, with recognizable trend across mammals. In DC muscle genes also a disease-related fingerprint can be observed, allowing discrimination between DC and NDC genes. We propose that using our strategy which studies CU in specific gene cohorts, as rare disease genes, and tissue specific genes, may provide novel information about the CUB role in human and medical genetics, with implications on synonymous variations interpretation and codon optimization algorithms."

The diagonal systematic sampling scheme is a type of systematic sampling design which has gained the attention of researchers during the last two decades. In this paper, a modification to the conventional diagonal systematic sampling design is proposed for use in situations where population units follow a linear trend. It is found that the proposed strategy reduces the variance of the diagonal systematic sampling thus resulting in an efficient sampling design. The mathematical conditions under which the suggested modified diagonal systematic sampling design is more precise than some of the available sampling designs are derived. With the help of a numerical illustration using milk yield data, it is shown that the proposed sampling scheme is more efficient than some of the available sampling schemes."
https://openalex.org/W4220850314,"Background Syphilis among men who have sex with men (MSM) living with HIV is of public health concern, thus the objective of the study is to determine the correlates of prevalent syphilis infection in this population so that urgent interventions could be instituted. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted during the period September 2020-June 2021 among MSM who attended a large HIV Clinic in Trinidad. A questionnaire was administered to obtain socio-demographic data and correlates of prevalent syphilis and patients were screened for syphilis using the traditional algorithm. Descriptive and bivariate analyses were conducted and multivariable logistic regression factors was used to assess factors significantly associated with a syphilis diagnosis. Results Two hundred and sixty four MSM were enrolled; age range 18–64 years, median age 33 years and 89 (34.4%) were actively bisexual. The prevalence of syphilis was 28% (74/264) and 89.2% (66/74) of these infections were asymptomatic. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that those patients who participated in sex with anonymous partners (OR 2.09; 95% CI, 1.03–4.26), those with a previous diagnosis of syphilis (OR 5.16; 95% CI, 1.03–25.83) and those who used marijuana in the last 12 months (OR 2.13; 95% CI, 1.14–3.96) were more likely to be diagnosed with syphilis. Conclusion There is a high prevalence of asymptomatic syphilis among MSM living with HIV in Trinidad. Repeat episodes of syphilis and anonymous sex may play a role in the transmission dynamics of T pallidum infection in this population, thus urgent public health prevention interventions are warranted."

https://openalex.org/W4220934125,"In order to study the mechanism of bract peeling and crushing of a corn harvester, a bract stripping and crushing device was designed that mainly consists of a stripping device, a crushing device, and a frame. The kinematics and dynamics of the roller of bract stripping device were analyzed, and the conditions of bract stripping were obtained. Single factor tests of stripping roller speed and crushing roller speed were carried out. On the basis of single factor tests, orthogonal experiments were carried out to determine crushing roller speed, distance between crushing device axis and stripping device axis, stripping roller speed, and offset angle of stripping roller. The orthogonal experiments showed that the optimum parameters of the device were obtained: the speed of the crushing drum was 1,100 r/min, the axis distance between the stripping and crushing devices was 180 mm, the speed of the stripping roller was 400 r/min, and the offset angle of the stripping roller was 5 degrees. On the basis of orthogonal experiment, three, five, seven, nine and eleven corn feeding and high-speed photography experiments were carried out respectively. The results showed that when three ears of corn were fed at the same time, the effect of corn bract stripping and crushing was the best with the increase of corn number. The stripping roller only grasps most of the bracts of corn at 0.019 s, after stripping the bracts into the crushing device, the bracts were crushed after 0.077 s. The crushing time of bracts was approximately four times as long as that of the bracts."
https://openalex.org/W4221069739,"Fluorescent imaging with voltage- or calcium-sensitive dyes, known as optical mapping, is one of the indispensable modern techniques to study cardiac or neural electrophysiology, unsurpassed by temporal and spatial resolution. High-speed CMOS cameras capable of optical registration of action potential propagation are in general very costly. We present a complete solution priced below US$1,000 (including camera and lens) at the moment of publication with an open-source image acquisition and processing software. We demonstrate that the iDS UI-3130CP rev.2 camera we used in this study is capable of 200x200 977 frames per second (FPS) action potential recordings from rodent hearts, with the signal-to-noise-ratio of a conditioned signal of 16 ± 10. A comparison with a specialized MiCAM Ultimate-L camera has shown that signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) while lower is sufficient for accurate measurements of AP waveform, conduction velocity (± 0.04 m/s) and action potential duration (± 7ms) in mouse and rat hearts. We used 4-aminopyridine to prolong the action potential duration in mouse heart, thus demonstrating that the proposed system is adequate for pharmacological studies."
