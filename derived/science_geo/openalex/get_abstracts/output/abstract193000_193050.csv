https://openalex.org/W2006123941,"ALL the hypotheses relating to the discharging mechanism of the stinging capsules of Cœlenterates hitherto seem to postulate that an enhanced intracapsular pressure forces out the stinging thread. However, the elongated (about 50 µ) ellipsoid type of nematocysts (‘penicilli’ of Stephenson1), which can be isolated in quantity from the acontial filaments of Diadumene luciae in the form of a dense nematocyst suspension, have provided evidence that full hydrostatic pressure exists within the capsules in the resting state, so that only a releasing action from outside is necessary for the thread eversion to take place2. At any rate, Glaser and Sparrow's view3 of the Metridium nematocyst as a simple osmometer cannot hold for the present material. The nematocysts of Diadumene possess a capsular wall impermeable to water, and will remain undischarged in distilled water, with their discharging capacity retained for several hours."

https://openalex.org/W2046820844,"PREVIOUS electron microscopic studies of chick embryo chorioallantoic membranes infected with herpes simplex virus have revealed that the development of virus in susceptible (ectodermal) cells apparently begins in the nucleus and is completed in the cytoplasm1. In the nucleus, the smallest particles considered to be virus measured 40–60 mµ in diameter and the largest did not exceed 130 mµ in diameter. Larger particles, some having a maximum linear dimension of 250 mµ, were seen in the cytoplasm or in extracellular locations. These observations were made on thin sections of tissue from which the methyl methacrylate had been dissolved by amyl acetate."

https://openalex.org/W2008971234,"Henry and Housewright1 described a manometric method for the assay of penicillinase which was based on the formation of penicilloic acid from penicillin in the presence of this enzyme. It has been found that a convenient way of following this reaction without the use of a manometric apparatus is to estimate penicilloic acid iodometrically. The uptake of iodine by penicilloic acid is not stoichiometric, 6–9 equivalents of iodine being absorbed per mole of penicilloic acid according to conditions2. However, with a standardized procedure, reproducible results can be obtained."

https://openalex.org/W2095206096,"TO investigate whether certain amino-acid sequences, for example, cysteinylglycine1, occur with greater than chance frequency in different proteins2,3, a method has been devised for the isolation and identification of cysteine containing sequences, and for peptide sequences containing O-phosphoserine, a compound with which at least one of the two phosphorus residues in ovalbumin4 has now been identified. 2-gm. portions of four times crystallized, performic acid oxidized2 ovalbumin were precipitated and washed with trichloroacetic acid, hydrolysed with 40 ml. of 11 N hydrochloric acid for 3–7 days at 37°, and hydrochloric acid removed in vacuo below 25°. A strongly acid peptide fraction was separated from the hydrolysate by washing through a 4 cm. × 10 cm. ‘Dowex 50’ (H+ form) column with water, and the effluent was dried in vacuo, neutralized in small volume, and applied to a 1 cm. × 50 cm. ‘Dowex 2’ column (pH 3, Cl− form). Slow elution with 400 ml. hydrochloric acid rising continuously from 0.001 to 0.05 N provided fractions containing only one to three peptides, separable by one-dimensional paper chromatography. Composition and N-terminal amino-acid of each peptide were determined by paper chromatography of sealed-capillary hydrolysates (11 N hydrochloric acid, at 110°) of aliquots, with and without treatment with dinitrofluorobenzene5."
https://openalex.org/W1986845235,"CYTOCHROME a
2, which is found in certain bacteria, for example, Aerobacter aerogenes and Azotobacter, has particular interest as it may play the part of a cytochrome oxidase in these organisms. The main absorption band of this cytochrome in the visible part of the spectrum is in the red region : reduced, 630 mµ; oxidized, 645 mµ; carbon monoxide complex, 635 mµ. Spectroscopic similarities to some ferrophaeophorbides1 as well as to certain bile pigment iron complexes2 have been observed."

https://openalex.org/W1964826404,"The virulence of a pathogen depends upon numerous factors, including the availability of essential nutrilites from the host. If the host cannot supply all these nutrilites, either in quantity or in a form suitable for assimilation, the pathogen cannot proliferate and produce the characteristic reactions in the host. For example, purine-requiring mutants of Salmonella typhosa 1 and of Klebsiella pneumoniae 2 were avirulent for mice because the requirement for purine was apparently not satisfied by the host. Garber et al. 2 suggested that auxotrophic mutants of pathogens may be useful for purposes of bioassay. Preliminary data from experiments using a plant pathogen, Erwinia aroideae, and the potato tuber, var. Red Russet, suggest that this technique may be extended to plant material in certain instances."

https://openalex.org/W1973652038,"Kellaway and Williams1 reported that Australian snake and Indian cobra venoms would cause haemolysis of the red blood corpuscles of certain mammals, and that homologous serum mixed with the red blood corpuscles of these species inhibited haemolysis. Using the red blood corpuscles of certain other species, the serum was found to activate haemolysis. This led us to investigate the influence of the Egyptian scorpion and cobra venoms on mammalian erythrocytes in vitro."

https://openalex.org/W2004006616,"RUTIN (= quercetin-3-rutinoside) prevents the copulation of male and female gametes in Chlamydomonas eugametos 1. Its effect is very specific. Checking more than forty flavonols, it was found that only rutin induces sterility. The sugar at carbon atom 3 (rutinose) seems to be important, as quercitrin (= quercetin-3-rhamnoside) does not influence fertility."
https://openalex.org/W2039332342,"The problem of the resistance of plants to fungal or bacterial attack is of great practical importance. If the nature of resistance of a particular plant to a particular pathogen is understood, the plant breeder may be better able to combine the factors for resistance to disease with other desirable characters and so produce a resistant variety of higher quality. This, when it can be done, is usually the most satisfactory method of controlling disease."

https://openalex.org/W2000113662,"THE insecticidal properties of valone (2-isovaleryl 1,3-indandione) were being investigated some years ago1, when the material was apparently eclipsed by the discovery of DDT. Recent tests on insect pests of stored products have shown that, although not outstandingly insecticidal by modern standards, valone has an unusual combination of properties; namely, (1) if the dose is high enough to be lethal, it kills the insects rapidly, (2) in sub-lethal doses it produces a paralysis from which insects afterwards recover, and (3) the percentage mortality is unusually sensitive to changes in dose. (2) indicated that insects can detoxify valone. By analogy with the probable mode of action of synergists for pyrethrins2 and DDT3, that is, depression of the normal detoxification of the insecticide, it seemed possible that the insecticidal action of valone could be intensified by a suitable synergist. Furthermore, (3) suggested that the synergist need not be highly efficient in order to increase the mortality considerably."

https://openalex.org/W1993895472,IT has been reported earlier that stressor agents like epinephrine1 and adrenocorticotrophic hormone2 cause a loss of alkaline phosphatase activity from the adrenal cortex. Administration of serum gonadotrophin to epinephrine-treated pigeons partially prevents this enzymatic loss1. The present communication records an attempt to determine whether a comparable reduction in alkaline phosphatase activity occurs in the adrenal cortex in response to a bacterial infection stress.
