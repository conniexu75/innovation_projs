https://openalex.org/W2588757737,"Adipose tissue is a major site of energy storage and has a role in the regulation of metabolism through the release of adipokines. Here we show that mice with an adipose-tissue-specific knockout of the microRNA (miRNA)-processing enzyme Dicer (ADicerKO), as well as humans with lipodystrophy, exhibit a substantial decrease in levels of circulating exosomal miRNAs. Transplantation of both white and brown adipose tissue—brown especially—into ADicerKO mice restores the level of numerous circulating miRNAs that are associated with an improvement in glucose tolerance and a reduction in hepatic Fgf21 mRNA and circulating FGF21. This gene regulation can be mimicked by the administration of normal, but not ADicerKO, serum exosomes. Expression of a human-specific miRNA in the brown adipose tissue of one mouse in vivo can also regulate its 3′ UTR reporter in the liver of another mouse through serum exosomal transfer. Thus, adipose tissue constitutes an important source of circulating exosomal miRNAs, which can regulate gene expression in distant tissues and thereby serve as a previously undescribed form of adipokine. Adipose tissue is a major source of circulating exosomal miRNAs, which contribute to the regulation of gene expression in distant tissues and organs. Adipose tissue is best known as a site of energy storage, but it also has a role in the regulation of metabolism through the release of cell signalling molecules called adipokines. Here Ronald Kahn and colleagues show that adipose tissue constitutes a major source of circulating exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs), and that these miRNAs are able to regulate gene expression in distant tissues. The miRNAs can therefore be considered to be a form of adipokine."
https://openalex.org/W2589112207,"The diagnosis of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (PanNETs) is increasing owing to more sensitive detection methods, and this increase is creating challenges for clinical management. We performed whole-genome sequencing of 102 primary PanNETs and defined the genomic events that characterize their pathogenesis. Here we describe the mutational signatures they harbour, including a deficiency in G:C > T:A base excision repair due to inactivation of MUTYH, which encodes a DNA glycosylase. Clinically sporadic PanNETs contain a larger-than-expected proportion of germline mutations, including previously unreported mutations in the DNA repair genes MUTYH, CHEK2 and BRCA2. Together with mutations in MEN1 and VHL, these mutations occur in 17% of patients. Somatic mutations, including point mutations and gene fusions, were commonly found in genes involved in four main pathways: chromatin remodelling, DNA damage repair, activation of mTOR signalling (including previously undescribed EWSR1 gene fusions), and telomere maintenance. In addition, our gene expression analyses identified a subgroup of tumours associated with hypoxia and HIF signalling."
https://openalex.org/W2588123864,"The stretch-activated channel Piezo1 controls homeostatic epithelial cell numbers by activating cells to divide rapidly when under stretch strain from low density, and by activating cells to extrude and die when cells are under crowding strain. Epithelial cell layers serve as barriers for the organs they cover, yet they continuously undergo cell division and cell death. So how do these dynamic processes avoid compromising the barrier function of epithelia? Jody Rosenblatt and colleagues previously reported in Nature that when epithelial cells become too crowded they trigger the stretch-activated channel Piezo1 to effect extrusion of cells that later die. They now ask how epithelia deal with the opposite situation—cell death. It emerges that, following cell death, the low density of surrounding cells also activate Piezo1, driving cell division to rebalance the cell numbers. The authors provide insights into the molecular mechanism through which stretch triggers cell division, and propose that whether Piezo1 signals for cell division or cell extrusion depends on the type of mechanical forces that it experiences. Despite acting as a barrier for the organs they encase, epithelial cells turn over at some of the fastest rates in the body. However, epithelial cell division must be tightly linked to cell death to preserve barrier function and prevent tumour formation. How does the number of dying cells match those dividing to maintain constant numbers? When epithelial cells become too crowded, they activate the stretch-activated channel Piezo1 to trigger extrusion of cells that later die1. However, it is unclear how epithelial cell division is controlled to balance cell death at the steady state. Here we show that mammalian epithelial cell division occurs in regions of low cell density where cells are stretched. By experimentally stretching epithelia, we find that mechanical stretch itself rapidly stimulates cell division through activation of the Piezo1 channel. To stimulate cell division, stretch triggers cells that are paused in early G2 phase to activate calcium-dependent phosphorylation of ERK1/2, thereby activating the cyclin B transcription that is necessary to drive cells into mitosis. Although both epithelial cell division and cell extrusion require Piezo1 at the steady state, the type of mechanical force controls the outcome: stretch induces cell division, whereas crowding induces extrusion. How Piezo1-dependent calcium transients activate two opposing processes may depend on where and how Piezo1 is activated, as it accumulates in different subcellular sites with increasing cell density. In sparse epithelial regions in which cells divide, Piezo1 localizes to the plasma membrane and cytoplasm, whereas in dense regions in which cells extrude, it forms large cytoplasmic aggregates. Because Piezo1 senses both mechanical crowding and stretch, it may act as a homeostatic sensor to control epithelial cell numbers, triggering extrusion and apoptosis in crowded regions and cell division in sparse regions."

https://openalex.org/W2588791993,"The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is a central regulator of cell growth that responds to diverse environmental signals and is deregulated in many human diseases, including cancer and epilepsy. Amino acids are a key input to this system, and act through the Rag GTPases to promote the translocation of mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface, its site of activation. Multiple protein complexes regulate the Rag GTPases in response to amino acids, including GATOR1, a GTPase activating protein for RAGA, and GATOR2, a positive regulator of unknown molecular function. Here we identify a protein complex (KICSTOR) that is composed of four proteins, KPTN, ITFG2, C12orf66 and SZT2, and that is required for amino acid or glucose deprivation to inhibit mTORC1 in cultured human cells. In mice that lack SZT2, mTORC1 signalling is increased in several tissues, including in neurons in the brain. KICSTOR localizes to lysosomes; binds and recruits GATOR1, but not GATOR2, to the lysosomal surface; and is necessary for the interaction of GATOR1 with its substrates, the Rag GTPases, and with GATOR2. Notably, several KICSTOR components are mutated in neurological diseases associated with mutations that lead to hyperactive mTORC1 signalling. Thus, KICSTOR is a lysosome-associated negative regulator of mTORC1 signalling, which, like GATOR1, is mutated in human disease."
https://openalex.org/W2588592529,"There is very limited human renal sodium gradient-dependent glucose transporter protein (SGLT2) mRNA and protein expression data reported in the literature. The first aim of this study was to determine SGLT2 mRNA and protein levels in human and animal models of diabetic nephropathy. We have found that the expression of SGLT2 mRNA and protein is increased in renal biopsies from human subjects with diabetic nephropathy. This is in contrast to db-db mice that had no changes in renal SGLT2 protein expression. Furthermore, the effect of SGLT2 inhibition on renal lipid content and inflammation is not known. The second aim of this study was to determine the potential mechanisms of beneficial effects of SGLT2 inhibition in the progression of diabetic renal disease. We treated db/db mice with a selective SGLT2 inhibitor JNJ 39933673. We found that SGLT2 inhibition caused marked decreases in systolic blood pressure, kidney weight/body weight ratio, urinary albumin, and urinary thiobarbituric acid-reacting substances. SGLT2 inhibition prevented renal lipid accumulation via inhibition of carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein-β, pyruvate kinase L, SCD-1, and DGAT1, key transcriptional factors and enzymes that mediate fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis. SGLT2 inhibition also prevented inflammation via inhibition of CD68 macrophage accumulation and expression of p65, TLR4, MCP-1, and osteopontin. These effects were associated with reduced mesangial expansion, accumulation of the extracellular matrix proteins fibronectin and type IV collagen, and loss of podocyte markers WT1 and synaptopodin, as determined by immunofluorescence microscopy. In summary, our study showed that SGLT2 inhibition modulates renal lipid metabolism and inflammation and prevents the development of nephropathy in db/db mice."
https://openalex.org/W2588948554,"Mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) integrates nutrient signals to control cell growth and organismal homeostasis across eukaryotes. The evolutionarily conserved GATOR complex regulates mTORC1 signalling through Rag GTPases, and GATOR1 displays GTPase activating protein (GAP) activity for RAGA and RAGB (RAGA/B) and GATOR2 has been proposed to be an inhibitor of GATOR1. Furthermore, the metazoan-specific SESN proteins function as guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) for RAGA/B, and interact with GATOR2 with unknown effects. Here we show that SZT2 (seizure threshold 2), a metazoan-specific protein mutated in epilepsy, recruits a fraction of mammalian GATOR1 and GATOR2 to form a SZT2-orchestrated GATOR (SOG) complex with an essential role in GATOR- and SESN-dependent nutrient sensing and mTORC1 regulation. The interaction of SZT2 with GATOR1 and GATOR2 was synergistic, and an intact SOG complex was required for its localization at the lysosome. SZT2 deficiency resulted in constitutive mTORC1 signalling in cells under nutrient-deprived conditions and neonatal lethality in mice, which was associated with failure to inactivate mTORC1 during fasting. Hyperactivation of mTORC1 in SZT2-deficient cells could be partially corrected by overexpression of the GATOR1 component DEPDC5, and by the lysosome-targeted GATOR2 component WDR59 or lysosome-targeted SESN2. These findings demonstrate that SZT2 has a central role in dictating GATOR-dependent nutrient sensing by promoting lysosomal localization of SOG, and reveal an unexpected function of lysosome-located GATOR2 in suppressing mTORC1 signalling through SESN recruitment."
https://openalex.org/W2587217886,"Human disease phenotypes associated with haploinsufficient gene requirements are often not recapitulated well in animal models. Here, we have investigated the association between human GATA6 haploinsufficiency and a wide range of clinical phenotypes that include neonatal and adult-onset diabetes using CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat)/Cas9-mediated genome editing coupled with human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) directed differentiation. We found that loss of one GATA6 allele specifically affects the differentiation of human pancreatic progenitors from the early PDX1+ stage to the more mature PDX1+NKX6.1+ stage, leading to impaired formation of glucose-responsive β-like cells. In addition to this GATA6 haploinsufficiency, we also identified dosage-sensitive requirements for GATA6 and GATA4 in the formation of both definitive endoderm and pancreatic progenitor cells. Our work expands the application of hPSCs from studying the impact of individual gene loci to investigation of multigenic human traits, and it establishes an approach for identifying genetic modifiers of human disease."
https://openalex.org/W2587810027,"PI3Kδ controls the expression of the recombinogenic enzyme AID; excessive AID activity caused by PI3Kδ inhibition can induce genomic instability in leukaemia and lymphoma cells, as well as in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia treated with PI3Kδ inhibitors. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase δ (PI3Kδ) pathway is highly active in many types of cancer. Several PI3Kδ inhibitors have been approved for the treatment of B-cell cancers such as leukaemias and lymphomas. Besides its cancer-promoting effects, PI3Kδ also controls the activity of the activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) enzyme, which promotes DNA recombination. Excessive AID activity due to PI3Kδ inhibition induced genomic instability in leukaemia and lymphoma cell lines in culture, as well as in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia treated with PI3Kδ inhibitors. The authors recommend that these adverse genomic effects are taken into account in patients receiving long-term therapy with this class of drugs. Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is a B-cell-specific enzyme that targets immunoglobulin genes to initiate class switch recombination and somatic hypermutation1. In addition, through off-target activity, AID has a much broader effect on genomic instability by initiating oncogenic chromosomal translocations and mutations involved in the development and progression of lymphoma2. AID expression is tightly regulated in B cells and its overexpression leads to enhanced genomic instability and lymphoma formation3. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase δ (PI3Kδ) pathway regulates AID by suppressing its expression in B cells4. Drugs for leukaemia or lymphoma therapy such as idelalisib, duvelisib and ibrutinib block PI3Kδ activity directly or indirectly5,6,7,8, potentially affecting AID expression and, consequently, genomic stability in B cells. Here we show that treatment of primary mouse B cells with idelalisib or duvelisib, and to a lesser extent ibrutinib, enhanced the expression of AID and increased somatic hypermutation and chromosomal translocation frequency to the Igh locus and to several AID off-target sites. Both of these effects were completely abrogated in AID-deficient B cells. PI3Kδ inhibitors or ibrutinib increased the formation of AID-dependent tumours in pristane-treated mice. Consistently, PI3Kδ inhibitors enhanced AID expression and translocation frequency to IGH and AID off-target sites in human chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and mantle cell lymphoma cell lines, and patients treated with idelalisib, but not ibrutinib, showed increased somatic hypermutation in AID off-targets. In summary, we show that PI3Kδ or Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitors increase genomic instability in normal and neoplastic B cells by an AID-dependent mechanism. This effect should be carefully considered, as such inhibitors can be administered to patients for years."

These results uncover long-range regulation of HSC migration emerging from the brain. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are multipotent self-renewing units mediating the generation of all blood constituents after transplantation. HSCs can home to the bone marrow (BM) following intravenous injection through the coordinated actions of adhesion receptors and the chemokine CXCL12 expressed within in the BM microenvironment (Magnon and Frenette, 2008Magnon C. Frenette P.S. Hematopoietic stem cell trafficking.in: Girard L. StemBook. Harvard Stem Cell Institute, Cambridge, MA2008http://www.stembook.org/node/452.htmlGoogle Scholar). Mobilized, HSC-enriched, mononuclear cells have emerged as the most common means to obtain HSCs for transplantation, but the procedure remains ineffective in a subset of patients (Levesque and Winkler, 2008Levesque J.P.

Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), the hematopoietic cytokine most commonly used to mobilize progenitors, can elicit circulating HSCs in the bloodstream over a period of ∼5 days (Bensinger et al., 1993Bensinger W.

The delayed response suggests that the mechanisms likely involve the orchestration of a complex cascade of events, which culminates, at least in part, in the reduced expression of CXCL12 that retains HSCs in the BM (Petit et al., 2002Petit I. Szyper-Kravitz M. Nagler A. Lahav M. Peled A. Habler L. Ponomaryov T. Taichman R.S. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Fujii N. et al.G-CSF induces stem cell mobilization by decreasing bone marrow SDF-1 and up-regulating CXCR4.Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 687-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar). At the top of the cascade is the G-CSF receptor (Csf3r) whose expression by a transplantable hematopoietic cell, distinct from HSCs, is required (Liu et al., 2000Liu F. Poursine-Laurent J. Link D.C. Expression of the G-CSF receptor on hematopoietic progenitor cells is not required for their mobilization by G-CSF.Blood. 2000; 95: 3025-3031PubMed Google Scholar). Further studies indicate that selective expression of Csf3r in mononuclear phagocytes can rescue the defective mobilization of Csf3r−∕− mice (Christopher et al., 2011Christopher M.J. Rao M. Liu F. Woloszynek J.R. Link D.C. Expression of the G-CSF receptor in monocytic cells is sufficient to mediate hematopoietic progenitor mobilization by G-CSF in mice.J. Exp. Med. 2011; 208: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), implicating these cells as important intermediary cells. Among mononuclear phagocytes, macrophages have been found to promote HSC retention (Chow et al., 2011Chow A. Lucas D. Hidalgo A. Méndez-Ferrer S. Hashimoto D. Scheiermann C. Battista M. Leboeuf M. Prophete C. van Rooijen N. et al.Bone marrow CD169+ macrophages promote the retention of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in the mesenchymal stem cell niche.J. Exp. Med. 2011; 208: 261-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). However, robust G-CSF-elicited HSC mobilization occurs upon macrophage depletion (Chow et al., 2011Chow A. Lucas D. Hidalgo A. Méndez-Ferrer S. Hashimoto D. Scheiermann C. Battista M. Leboeuf M. Prophete C. van Rooijen N. et al.Bone marrow CD169+ macrophages promote the retention of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in the mesenchymal stem cell niche.J. Exp. Med. 2011; 208: 261-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar), suggesting the participation of other pathways. Neural signals from the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) have also been shown to promote G-CSF-induced HSC egress through β-adrenoreceptor-mediated regulation of CXCL12 (Katayama et al., 2006Katayama Y. Battista M. Kao W.M. Hidalgo A. Peired A.J. Thomas S.A. Frenette P.S. Signals from the sympathetic nervous system regulate hematopoietic stem cell egress from bone marrow.Cell. 2006; 124: 407-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). Since intracerebral administration of G-CSF did not elicit HSC mobilization from the BM (Katayama et al., 2006Katayama Y. Battista M. Kao W.M. Hidalgo A. Peired A.J. Thomas S.A. Frenette P.S. Signals from the sympathetic nervous system regulate hematopoietic stem cell egress from bone marrow.Cell. 2006; 124: 407-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar), its effects on the SNS tone are thought to be mediated via the peripheral nervous system. Indeed, norepinephrine reuptake in superior cervical sympathetic ganglion neurons is modulated by G-CSF exposure (Lucas et al., 2012Lucas D. Bruns I. Battista M. Mendez-Ferrer S. Magnon C. Kunisaki Y. Frenette P.S. Norepinephrine reuptake inhibition promotes mobilization in mice: potential impact to rescue low stem cell yields.Blood. 2012; 119: 3962-3965Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In addition, neurotoxic chemotherapy or selective sympathectomy impairs HSC mobilization, suggesting that lesioned peripheral nerves may contribute to the poor stem cell yield of cancer patients previously treated with cytotoxic therapies (Lucas et al., 2013Lucas D. Scheiermann C. Chow A. Kunisaki Y. Bruns I. Barrick C. Tessarollo L. Frenette P.S. Chemotherapy-induced bone marrow nerve injury impairs hematopoietic regeneration.Nat. Med. 2013; 19: 695-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Under steady state, physiological release of HSCs follows circadian oscillations of CXCL12 expression mediated by adrenergic innervation of Nestin+ mesenchymal stem cell niche (Méndez-Ferrer et al., 2008Méndez-Ferrer S. Lucas D. Battista M. Frenette P.S. Haematopoietic stem cell release is regulated by circadian oscillations.Nature. 2008; 452: 442-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar, Méndez-Ferrer et al., 2010Méndez-Ferrer S.

Mesenchymal and haematopoietic stem cells form a unique bone marrow niche.Nature. 2010; 466: 829-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (2468) Google Scholar). Homing of HSCs and progenitors to the BM and the expression of endothelial adhesion molecules are also under similar, albeit inverted, SNS-mediated circadian influence (Scheiermann et al., 2012Scheiermann C. Kunisaki Y. Lucas D. Chow A. Jang J.E. Zhang D. Hashimoto D. Merad M. Frenette P.S. Adrenergic nerves govern circadian leukocyte recruitment to tissues.Immunity. 2012; 37: 290-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Additional studies have suggested that the circadian oscillation of glucocorticoids (GCs) may regulate CXCL12 circadian expression and hematopoietic Nestin+ progenitor expansion via Notch1 signaling (Kollet et al., 2013Kollet O. Vagima Y. D’Uva G. Golan K. Canaani J. Itkin T. Gur-Cohen S. Kalinkovich A. Caglio G. Medaglia C. et al.Physiologic corticosterone oscillations regulate murine hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell proliferation and CXCL12 expression by bone marrow stromal progenitors.Leukemia. 2013; 27: 2006-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, whether the CNS can influence HSC migration in the BM via a humoral circuit has not been demonstrated. Understanding how cancer stem cells migrate may provide insight into the mechanisms that regulate HSC mobilization. In this regard, we previously have tested the idea that nerves contributed to the cancer microenvironment by promoting cancer cell migration, and we found that prostate cancer was infiltrated by adrenergic and cholinergic fibers, which enhanced cancer progression in distinct ways (Magnon et al., 2013Magnon C. Hall S.J. Lin J. Xue X. Gerber L. Freedland S.J. Frenette P.S. Autonomic nerve development contributes to prostate cancer progression.Science. 2013; 341: 1236361Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Adrenergic fibers played a prominent role in cancer initiation via stromal β2- and β3-adrenergic receptors, whereas cholinergic fibers, acting on muscarinic receptor type-1 (Chrm1) of the stroma, promoted cancer cell migration, lymph node invasion, and metastasis (Magnon et al., 2013Magnon C. Hall S.J. Lin J. Xue X. Gerber L. Freedland S.J. Frenette P.S. Autonomic nerve development contributes to prostate cancer progression.Science. 2013; 341: 1236361Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we investigated the possibility that Chrm1 signaling in the BM microenvironment also might influence the G-CSF-induced HSC migration. Here we report that Chrm1 is required for efficient HSC mobilization; but, unexpectedly, it acts on the CNS, rather than peripheral cholinergic nerves, to modulate HSC mobilization from the BM via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which primes HSC migration through the GC receptor Nr3c1. To evaluate the role of muscarinic receptors in HSC mobilization, we treated mice with the pan-muscarinic receptor antagonist Scopolamine hydrobromide. Wild-type mice subjected to Scopolamine treatment exhibited significant reductions in G-CSF-induced phenotypic HSC mobilization, compared to vehicle-treated mice (Figure 1A). We next induced HSC mobilization with G-CSF in mice deficient in Chrm1 (Chrm1−∕−; Figure 1B), which also revealed a significant and reproducible reduction of mobilized phenotypic HSCs (Figure 1C) and colony-forming progenitors (Figure 1D), compared to wild-type controls. However, we found no hematopoietic deficits in circulating blood counts (Figure S1A) or progenitor numbers in the BM (Figure S1B; Figure 1E) at steady state. In addition, we evaluated HSC relationships with arterioles by tridimensional BM imaging (Kunisaki et al., 2013Kunisaki Y. Bruns I. Scheiermann C. Ahmed J. Pinho S. Zhang D. Mizoguchi T. Wei Q. Lucas D. Ito K. et al.Arteriolar niches maintain haematopoietic stem cell quiescence.Nature. 2013; 502: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar), and we found no alteration in HSC distribution in the BM (Figure S1C). Thus, these results suggest that HSC numbers and distribution in the BM are not altered, indicating the possibility of a specific defect of HSC migration in Chrm1−∕− mice. To assess whether the mobilization defect involved functional HSCs, we transplanted blood from mobilized wild-type or Chrm1−∕− (CD45.2+) mice along with wild-type CD45.1+ competitor BM cells into lethally irradiated recipients. Mice reconstituted with Chrm1−∕−-mobilized blood consistently exhibited lower than wild-type CD45.2+ donor trilineage (B cell, T cell, and myeloid) reconstitution in the blood 16 weeks after transplantation, confirming reduced numbers of mobilized HSCs in Chrm1−∕− blood (Figures 1F and 1G). By contrast, no difference in engraftment was observed compared to wild-type controls when steady-state Chrm1−∕− BM was competitively transplanted into irradiated recipients, indicating that BM HSC numbers and function in Chrm1−∕− mice were unaltered (Figures S1D and S1E). Thus, Chrm1 signals are not required for healthy steady-state maintenance of HSCs within the BM niche, but they contribute specifically to the mobilization of these cells from their niche to peripheral blood. To investigate whether Chrm1 expression was required on the HSC or the stroma, we used chimeric mice generated by reciprocal BM transplantation in which donor HSC or recipient microenvironment was deficient or sufficient in Chrm1. We found that mobilization by G-CSF was rescued when stably engrafted (>16 weeks after engraftment) chimeric recipients were wild-type. By contrast, chimeras in which wild-type donor HSCs engrafted Chrm1−∕− recipients exhibited the same reduction in mobilization efficiency, suggesting a non-hematopoietic origin of the defect (Figure 2A). We surveyed the expression levels of Chrm1 among fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-purified hematopoietic and stromal cells. In contrast to brain tissue extracts where robust Chrm1 expression was detected, no expression was detectable in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells or in various purified components of the stroma (Figure 2B). These unexpected results indicated that the inhibition of HSC mobilization was most likely mediated by an effector cell outside of the BM. Insights emerged from experiments using the selective Chrm1 antagonist pirenzipene (PZP). In our previous studies in prostate cancer, the administration of either Scopolamine or PZP inhibited cancer cell migration induced by a cholinergic agonist (Magnon et al., 2013Magnon C. Hall S.J. Lin J. Xue X. Gerber L. Freedland S.J. Frenette P.S. Autonomic nerve development contributes to prostate cancer progression.Science. 2013; 341: 1236361Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). However, in the hematopoietic system, we found that treatment of wild-type mice with PZP did not alter G-CSF-induced mobilization (Figure 2C), whereas Scopolamine treatment significantly reduced HSC egress (Figure 1A). Since Scopolamine, but not PZP, readily crosses the blood-brain barrier (Jaup and Blomstrand, 1980Jaup B.H. Blomstrand C. Cerebro-spinal fluid concentrations of pirenzepine after therapeutic dosage.Scand. J. Gastroenterol. Suppl. 1980; 66: 35-37PubMed Google Scholar), we explored the possibility that the muscarinic receptors in the CNS might be controlling mobilization efficiency in the BM. To evaluate directly that Chrm1 acts centrally, we administered PZP or vehicle control via third ventricle cannulation in wild-type animals, followed by G-CSF administration. Interestingly, mice treated centrally with PZP exhibited significantly reduced mobilization compared to controls in response to G-CSF (Figure 2D; Figure S2A), very similar to that seen in Chrm1−∕− mice challenged with G-CSF (Figure 1C). These data definitively identify a role for CNS signals in G-CSF-elicited mobilization of HSCs. To determine how signals from the CNS were relayed to the BM, we generated parabiotic mice, as depicted in Figure 3A, in which mice of the same and different genotypes (Chrm1−∕− and wild-type) were surgically joined. In this experimental strategy, if signals to the BM were directly transduced via a neural circuit, we would not expect any rescue from heterotypic parabionts. By contrast, if the relay was mediated by a blood-borne factor, we would expect that wild-type blood circulation might rescue the mobilization deficit in Chrm1−∕− animals. Pairs were allowed to recover and blood chimerism was analyzed to confirm the exchange of circulating leukocytes between partners (Figure S2B). We found that Chrm1−∕−: Chrm1−∕− pairs retained the G-CSF-induced mobilization deficit compared to the wild-type homotypic pairs (Figure 3B). In addition, the pairing of Chrm1−∕− animals with wild-type mice rescued the mobilization defect in the knockout partner (Figure 3B), suggesting that a blood-borne soluble factor was linking the brain to the BM. We next examined the norepinephrine levels, by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in the plasma of mice centrally treated with PZP, to investigate whether Chrm1 blockade could alter the SNS outflow. We found no significant alteration in norepinephrine levels (Figure S2C), suggesting that the mechanism was distinct from a modulation of the SNS tone. In addition, we found that CXCL12 levels after G-CSF were comparable between Chrm1−∕− and wild-type mice (Figure S2D), arguing further that the mechanism was separate from SNS-mediated CXCL12 modulation. Since we determined that a blood-borne factor links central Chrm1 signals to HSCs for robust mobilization, we hypothesized that a neuroendocrine factor controlled by the CNS may be at play. Since the primary source of neuroendocrine factors is the pituitary gland, we measured pituitary hormone levels in the plasma of wild-type and Chrm1−∕− animals. Whereas the levels of vasopressin, oxytocin, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and growth hormone (GH) were not significantly changed between wild-type and Chrm1−∕− mice (Figures S3A–S3D), levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) were reduced significantly after G-CSF-induced mobilization (Figures S3E and S3F). To investigate whether the supplementation of either pituitary hormone would alter HSC migration, we administered them individually using subcutaneous osmotic pumps. We found that the administration of LH did not significantly alter HSC mobilization, and, by contrast, ACTH dramatically reduced the number of mobilized cells in both WT and Chrm1−∕− mice (Figures S3G and S3H). We then measured the levels of corticosterone in plasma, and we found it to be significantly reduced in Chrm1−∕− mice compared to controls (Figure 3C). Strikingly, corticosterone levels in BM extracellular fluids were significantly lower compared to the levels in plasma, and they were dramatically reduced in Chrm1−∕− animals (Figure 3D). Consistent with adrenal insufficiency in Chrm1−∕− animals, a state clinically associated with serious morbidity and mortality after traumatic stress (Udelsman et al., 1986Udelsman R. Ramp J. Gallucci W.T. Gordon A. Lipford E. Norton J.A. Loriaux D.L. Chrousos G.P. Adaptation during surgical stress. A reevaluation of the role of glucocorticoids.J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 1377-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), we observed that Chrm1−∕− mice were susceptible to death after surgical procedures. For example, a large proportion (∼55%) of Chrm1−∕− mice did not recover the surgery for parabiosis (data not shown). In addition, we observed a significant perioperative mortality of adrenalectomized Chrm1−∕−, but not wild-type, mice (Figure S3I). To investigate the role of circulating GCs in HSC mobilization, we treated wild-type mice with metyrapone, an inhibitor of 11β-hydroxylase, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of precursor sterols into functional corticosterone (Hays et al., 1984Hays S.J. Tobes M.C. Gildersleeve D.L. Wieland D.M. Beierwaltes W.H. Structure-activity relationship study of the inhibition of adrenal cortical 11 beta-hydroxylase by new metyrapone analogues.J. Med. Chem. 1984; 27: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Animals treated with metyrapone phenocopied Chrm1−∕− animals and exhibited significant reductions in mobilized HSCs, while the baseline numbers of HSCs in BM were not altered (Figure 3E; Figure S3J). Importantly, the administration of a physiological amount of corticosterone to Chrm1−∕− mice rescued the HSC mobilization defect to wild-type levels (Figure 3F). Taken together, these data strongly suggest that adrenal insufficiency is responsible for the mobilization deficit of Chrm1−∕− mice and that GCs may play an important role in HSC egress. Corticosterone typically binds to its receptor, Nr3c1, in the cytoplasm, and, upon binding its ligand, Nr3c1 translocates into the nucleus (de Kloet et al., 2009de Kloet E.R. Fitzsimons C.P. Datson N.A. Meijer O.C. Vreugdenhil E. Glucocorticoid signaling and stress-related limbic susceptibility pathway: about receptors, transcription machinery and microRNA.Brain Res. 2009; 1293: 129-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Thus, the activation state of the receptor can be determined by tracking the subcellular location of the receptor. Nr3c1 is expressed throughout the BM including on HSCs (Figure S3K). To assess the activity of the GC receptor in HSCs, we sorted HSCs from wild-type or Chrm1−∕− steady-state BM, and we imaged Nr3c1 using immunofluorescence analysis. Whereas the vast majority of Nr3c1 was located in the nucleus of wild-type HSCs, nuclear Nr3c1 was significantly reduced in HSCs isolated from Chrm1−∕− animals (Figures 3G and 3H). Upon administration of corticosterone in Chrm1−∕− mice at a dose allowing the rescue of mobilization, Nr3c1 nuclear translocation was also normalized (Figure 3H). Similar results were observed in whole-blood hematopoietic cells (Figures S3L and S3M). These data are consistent with the marked reduction of corticosterone availability in the BM and plasma, supporting the conclusion that GCs play an important role in regulating HSC mobilization. Since the hypothalamus is known to orchestrate the HPA axis, we investigated the expression and function of Chrm1 in this region of the brain. In situ hybridization analyses revealed that Chrm1 was expressed in both the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the hypothalamus (Figure 4A; Figure S4A), which is consistent with results from the Gene Expression Nervous System Atlas Project (Gireesh et al., 2008Gireesh G. Kaimal S.B. Kumar T.P. Paulose C.S. Decreased muscarinic M1 receptor gene expression in the hypothalamus, brainstem, and pancreatic islets of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.J. Neurosci. Res. 2008; 86: 947-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, Heintz, 2004Heintz N. Gene expression nervous system atlas (GENSAT).Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 483Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Additionally, dissected hypothalamic regions from wild-type brains showed robust Chrm1 mRNA by RT-PCR analyses compared to Chrm1−∕− hypothalamic tissue (Figure 4B). Previous studies have suggested that cholinergic signals transduced via muscarinic receptors can activate the HPA axis (Hillhouse and Milton, 1989Hillhouse E.W. Milton N.G. Effect of acetylcholine and 5-hydroxytryptamine on the secretion of corticotrophin-releasing factor-41 and arginine vasopressin from the rat hypothalamus in vitro.J. Endocrinol. 1989; 122: 713-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, Ohmori et al., 1995Ohmori N. Itoi K. Tozawa F. Sakai Y. Sakai K. Horiba N. Demura H. Suda T. Effect of acetylcholine on corticotropin-releasing factor gene expression in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus of conscious rats.Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4858-4863Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) through the production of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) that can then trigger the release of ACTH in the pituitary. To test specifically if hypothalamic Chrm1 signaling regulates Crh expression, we stimulated cholinergic receptors in the hypothalamic regions using an ex vivo culture system (Figure 4C; Figure S4B). To this end, wild-type hypothalamic regions of brains were extracted, divided at the midline, and incubated in artificial cerebrospinal fluid containing acetylcholine (Figure 4C). We found that, in this system, the Chrm1 antagonist PZP significantly reduced Crh mRNA (Figure 4C; Figure S4C). Thus, Chrm1+ cells in the hypothalamus region can activate the HPA axis by producing CRH. To further evaluate the functional requirement of hypothalamic neurons in HSC mobilization, we neonatally treated wild-type animals with monosodium glutamate (MSG), which induces irreversible lesions in the mediobasal hypothalamus, mostly in the ARC region (Miquel et al., 2003Miquel M. Font L. Sanchis-Segura C. Aragon C.M. Neonatal administration of monosodium glutamate prevents the development of ethanol- but not psychostimulant-induced sensitization: a putative role of the arcuate nucleus.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 17: 2163-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Mice were then aged to adulthood (6–8 weeks) and mobilized with G-CSF. MSG-treated mice exhibited significant reductions in HSC mobilization similar to those observed in Chrm1−∕− mice, suggesting that hypothalamic neurons participate in the regulation of enforced HSC migration in the BM (Figure 4D). To study how the deficit in GC signaling through Nr3c1 affects HSC migration capacity, we analyzed the genome-wide changes in gene expression of purified HSCs from wild-type and Chrm1−∕− mice. Hierarchical clustering of differentially expressed genes and subsequent gene set enrichment analyses revealed differential expression of motility set genes (Figures 5A and 5B ). In particular, kinesin, microtubule motor activity, and Ras GTPase activator activity gene sets were significantly downregulated. These results were confirmed by RT-PCR analyses of steady-state HSCs (Figure 5C). Using a transwell assay, we evaluated the effect of corticosterone on the migration of lineage-depleted hematopoietic progenitors toward the chemoattractant CXCL12. We found that, after incubation with physiological concentrations of GCs, the migration of colony-forming progenitors was significantly enhanced (Figures 5D–5F). In addition, the effect of corticosterone on progenitor migration in vitro was reversed when the cells were treated with RU486, an inhibitor of the GC receptor (Figure 5F). To investigate further the effect of the GC receptor in a genetic model, we intercrossed Nr3c1fl/fl mice with Mx1-cre transgenic animals to conditionally delete the GC receptor. We investigated the effect of Nr3c1 deletion on actin-organizing pathways in hematopoietic cells harvested from the blood of Nr3c1fl/fl; Mx1-cre+ and Nr3c1fl/fl control mice transplanted into wild-type recipients after poly (I:C) treatment, by staining blood leukocytes for phalloidin, which binds to polymerized actin. We found a marked reduction of polymerized actin in hematopoietic cells deficient in Nr3c1 compared to control cells (Figure 6A). We then evaluated actin polymerization by phalloidin staining in Chrm1−∕− hematopoietic cells and observed a similar reduction, which was rescued by the administration of a physiological dose of corticosterone (Figure 6B). We then subjected Nr3c1fl/fl; Mx1-Cre+ BM lineage-depleted cells to the transwell migration assay (Figure 5D), and we found no effect of corticosterone in Nr3c1fl/fl; Mx1Cre+ progenitor migration, confirming that GCs were acting through Nr3c1 to elicit migration (Figure S5A). We also assayed Chrm1−∕− progenitor cells for transwell migration, and we observed a slight effect of GCs on these progenitors (Figure S5A), which is consistent with the baseline impairment in the migration machinery in these cells. These data thus indicate that signaling through the GC receptor is critical to regulate hematopoietic cell motility. To evaluate whether the deficiency of Nr3c1 in hematopoietic cells was sufficient to alter HSC mobilization, we transplanted the BM from Nr3c1fl/fl; Mx1-cre+ and Nr3c1fl/fl control animals into irradiated CD45.1 wild-type recipients. Then 4 weeks after transplantation, mice were treated with poly (I:C), followed by a 10-day recovery to delete Nr3c1 in donor-derived c"

SVR is typically accompanied by normalization of liver enzymes, however, hepatic inflammation, i.e. persistently elevated aminotransferase levels may persist despite HCV eradication. Aim: To investigate prevalence and risk factors for ongoing hepatic inflammation after SVR in two large patient cohorts. Methods This post-hoc analysis was based on prospectively collected demographic and clinical data from 834 patients with SVR after HCV treatment with either PegIFN- or DAA-based treatment regimens from the PRAMA trial (n = 341) or patients treated at our outpatient clinic (n = 493). Results We observed an unexpected high prevalence of post-SVR inflammation, including patients who received novel IFN-free DAA-based therapies. Up to 10% of patients had ongoing elevation of aminotransferase levels and another 25% showed aminotransferase activity above the so-called healthy range. Several baseline factors were independently associated with post-SVR aminotransferase elevation. Among those, particularly male gender, advanced liver disease and markers for liver steatosis were strongly predictive for persistent ALT elevation. The use of IFN-based antiviral treatment was independently correlated with post-SVR inflammation, further supporting the overall benefit of IFN-free combination regimens. Conclusion This is the first comprehensive study on a large patient cohort investigating the prevalence and risk factors for ongoing liver inflammation after eradication of HCV. Our data show a high proportion of patients with ongoing hepatic inflammation despite HCV eradication with potential implications for the management of approximately one third of all patients upon SVR."
https://openalex.org/W2589118911,"Ovarian cancer (OVC) patients who receive chemotherapy often acquire drug resistance within one year. This can lead to tumor reoccurrence and metastasis, the major causes of mortality. We report a transient increase of a small distinctive CXCR4High/CD24Low cancer stem cell population (CXCR4High) in A2780 and SKOV-3 OVC cell lines in response to cisplatin, doxorubicin, and paclitaxel, treatments. The withdrawal of the drug challenges reversed this cell-state transition. CXCR4High exhibits dormancy in drug resistance and mesenchymal-like invasion, migration, colonization, and tumor formation properties. The removal of this cell population from a doxorubicin-resistant A2780 lineage (A2780/ADR) recovered the sensitivity to drug treatments. A cytotoxic peptide (CXCR4-KLA) that can selectively target cell-surface CXCR4 receptor was further synthesized to investigate the therapeutic merits of targeting CXCR4High. This peptide was more potent than the conventional CXCR4 antagonists (AMD3100 and CTCE-9908) in eradicating the cancer stem cells. When used together with cytotoxic agents such as doxorubicin and cisplatin, the combined drug-peptide regimens exhibited a synergistic cell-killing effect on A2780, A2780/ADR, and SKOV-3. Our data suggested that chemotherapy could establish drug-resistant and tumor-initiating properties of OVC via reversible CXCR4 cell state transition. Therapeutic strategies designed to eradicate rather than antagonize CXCR4High might offer a far-reaching potential as supportive chemotherapy."

Methods Increasing concentrations of PLEO (0.01–0.1% v/v, 80–800 μg/ml) were administered to a wide variety of cultured cancer cells from breast, cervix, colon, liver, lung, prostate, and thyroid carcinomas. Fibroblasts were also included as healthy control cells. Cell viability was monitored by WST-8 assay up to 72 hours after PLEO administration. The intracellular formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the induction of apoptosis, and the enhancement of chemotherapeutic drug cytotoxicity by PLEO were further investigated in the most responsive cancer cell line. Results A dose-dependent reduction of tumor cell viability was observed upon PLEO exposure; while no cytotoxic effect was revealed in healthy fibroblasts. FTC-133 thyroid cancer cells were found to be the most sensitive cells to PLEO treatment; accordingly, an intracellular accumulation of ROS and an activation of both the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways were evidenced in FTC-133 cells after PLEO administration. Furthermore, the cytotoxic effect of the antineoplastic drugs cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil and etoposide was enhanced in PLEO-exposed FTC-133 cells. Conclusion Taking into account its mode of action, PLEO might be considered as a promising source of natural antitumor agents which might have therapeutic potential in integrated oncology."
https://openalex.org/W2589002082,"Synaptic activity drives changes in gene expression to promote long lasting adaptations of neuronal structure and function. One example of such an adaptive response is the buildup of acquired neuroprotection, a synaptic activity- and gene transcription-mediated increase in the resistance of neurons against harmful conditions. A hallmark of acquired neuroprotection is the stabilization of mitochondrial structure and function. We therefore re-examined previously identified sets of synaptic activity-regulated genes to identify genes that are directly linked to mitochondrial function. In mouse and rat primary hippocampal cultures, synaptic activity caused an up-regulation of glycolytic genes and a concomitant down-regulation of genes required for oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial biogenesis, and maintenance.

The specific and coordinate pattern of gene expression changes suggested that synaptic activity promotes a shift of neuronal energy metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation toward aerobic glycolysis, also known as the Warburg effect. The ability of neurons to up-regulate glycolysis has, however, been debated. We therefore used FACS sorting to show that, in mixed neuron glia co-cultures, activity-dependent regulation of metabolic gene expression occurred in neurons.

Examples of such gene transcription-dependent adaptive responses are the formation of long term memories, activity-dependent dendritic remodeling, and the buildup of acquired neuroprotection.

In the present study, we re-examined the synaptic activity-regulated gene pool to search for additional genes that are more directly linked to mitochondrial function. We found activity-dependent changes in the expression of several genes that encode for mitochondrial maintenance factors, metabolic regulatory enzymes, and nutrient transporters. This prompted us to test the long term effect of synaptic activity-mediated gene transcription on energy metabolism. In general, cells use two major pathways to generate ATP from glucose. Under conditions of sufficient oxygen supply, cells use glycolysis to break down glucose to pyruvate, which is then oxidized to CO2 in mitochondria via the TCA cycle. Reducing equivalents that are generated in the TCA cycle feed electrons into the mitochondrial electron transfer chain to generate a proton gradient that drives ATP generation via ATP synthase (oxidative phosphorylation). Under conditions of insufficient oxygen supply, the cells can switch to fermentation. In this case, pyruvate that is generated through glycolysis cannot be oxidized in mitochondria and is therefore converted to l-lactate, which is finally exported from cells. Generation of l-lactate serves to recover NAD+, which is required for a continuous flux of glucose through glycolysis. Under certain conditions, some cells generate ATP via lactic acid fermentation in the presence of non-limiting oxygen availability. This phenomenon is a well known feature of cancer cells and has been termed aerobic glycolysis or the Warburg effect (8.Warburg O. On the origin of cancer cells.Science. 1956; 123: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (9550) Google Scholar, 9.Warburg O. Wind F. Negelein E. The metabolism of tumors in the body.J. Gen. Physiol. 1927; 8: 519-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (2508) Google Scholar). In this study we analyzed oxygen consumption and l-lactate production in primary hippocampal cultures and found that synaptic activity shifts the mode of neuronal ATP generation from oxidative phosphorylation toward aerobic glycolysis. This mode of neuronal energy metabolism presumably reduces mitochondrial activity and the generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. Thus, as has been proposed before (2.Bading H. Nuclear calcium signalling in the regulation of brain function.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2013; 14: 593-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), these findings identify a novel component of the mechanisms underlying acquired neuroprotection.

We then asked, which, if any, of these genes encode for mitochondrial proteins.

The list of down-regulated genes included, among others, mitochondrial transcription factors, mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, and an assembly factor of the mitochondrial ATP synthase complex. Examples of up-regulated genes are the solute carriers Slc25a3 and Slc16a1 (monocarboxylate transporter, Mct1), and the key metabolic regulatory enzyme, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 3 (Pdk3). Activity-dependent regulation of all genes listed in Table 1 (except Sod1 and Rps15a) was confirmed by RNA-Seq data obtained in an independent set of experiments (supplemental Table S1). Complete RNA-Seq data including raw data and detailed methods have been deposited in the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus and are accessible through series accession number GSE92275. Whole transcriptome data for activity-dependent gene expression changes are listed in supplemental Table S2. When we analyzed the newly identified list of activity-regulated mitochondrial genes, we noticed that several of them affect energy metabolism. Indeed, the concomitant up- and down-regulation of several functionally related genes suggested that AP bursting induces a change in neuronal energy metabolism. To further investigate this idea, we screened the gene chip and RNA-Seq data sets to identify additional activity-regulated genes with a role in energy metabolism. These analyses revealed five additional candidate genes, the plasma membrane localized glucose transporters Glut1 (Slc2a1) and Glut3 (Slc2a3), the monocarboxylate transporter Mct4 (Slc16a3), the glycolysis regulating enzyme Pfkfb3, and the mitochondrial uncoupling protein Ucp1 (Table 1). We next validated the gene expression changes identified in the transcriptome data sets. We subjected primary mouse hippocampal cultures to 4 h of AP bursting and then analyzed changes in the expression of 13 genes from Table 1 by qRT-PCR (Fig. 1, A and B). To test whether activity-dependent changes in gene expression are mediated by nuclear calcium, an important signal in excitation-transcription coupling (2.Bading H. Nuclear calcium signalling in the regulation of brain function.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2013; 14: 593-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), we infected the cultures with a recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) that expresses mCherry-tagged CaMBP4, a nuclear-localized peptide that inhibits calcium/calmodulin signaling (5.Zhang S.J.

Our qRT-PCR analyses confirmed the previously observed up- or down-regulation of all tested genes except Sod1. Furthermore, we found that the changes in expression of several genes (8 of 12) were sensitive to inhibition of nuclear calcium/calmodulin signaling. The expression of many glycolytic genes can be controlled by the transcription factor, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), the activity of which is controlled via constitutive degradation versus stimulus-induced stabilization of its subunit HIF-1α. We used immunoblotting to analyze HIF-1α levels in control cultures and in cultures that were subjected to AP bursting for 4 h (Fig. 2). HIF-1α expression levels were very low under basal conditions and decreased even further after stimulation, indicating that AP bursting-induced changes in metabolic gene expression are not mediated by HIF signaling.FIGURE 2Synaptic activity does not cause an increase in HIF-1α protein. A, representative immunoblot that shows HIF-1α levels in primary mouse hippocampal cultures that were left untreated (ctrl), stimulated for 4 h with 50 μm bicuculline (AP bursting), or deprived of oxygen supply for 4 h (oxygen depr.). AP bursting-mediated gene expression was verified by detection of c-FOS protein. The positions of molecular mass markers (kDa) are indicated. B, quantification of HIF-1α levels in control and stimulated cultures. The HIF-1α signal of positive control samples was usually saturated at exposure times that were appropriate for quantification of control and stimulated samples. The positive control was therefore not quantified. The graph shows mean, individual values, and 95% CI (n = 3 independent experiments).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test whether changes in the expression of nuclear encoded mitochondrial genes were accompanied by changes in mitochondrial abundance, we measured mitochondrial DNA (Fig. 1C) and TOM20 protein (Fig. 1D) throughout 16 h of AP bursting. Mitochondrial DNA levels did not change, whereas TOM20 protein levels were significantly reduced after prolonged AP bursting, which is in line with the decreased expression of mitochondrial transcription and maintenance factors. The expression of Mct1, Glut3, Ucp1, and Pdk3 was specifically changed by survival promoting synaptic activity (AP bursting) but not by bath application of glutamate, which activates extrasynaptic NMDA receptors and promotes cell death (3.Hardingham G.E. Fukunaga Y. Bading H. Extrasynaptic NMDARs oppose synaptic NMDARs by triggering CREB shut-off and cell death pathways.Nat.

Synaptic versus extrasynaptic NMDA receptor signalling: implications for neurodegenerative disorders.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2010; 11: 682-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1E). We next analyzed activity-dependent regulation of metabolic genes in vivo. We used qRT-PCR to measure expression of 15 genes listed in Table 1 in the hippocampus of control mice and mice that had been treated for 4 h with kainic acid, which is commonly used to induce epileptic seizures involving strong global synaptic activation in the hippocampus and cortex. The results established the up-regulation of all 6 genes tested (Fig. 1F) and the down-regulation of 4 of 9 genes tested (Fig. 1G). We also analyzed the expression of two key metabolic genes, Pdk3 and Glut3, in the hippocampus of kainic acid-treated rats, the results of which confirmed their activity-dependent regulation in vivo (Fig. 1H). Together, this coordinate pattern of gene expression changes suggests a form of neuronal metabolic plasticity, in which synaptic activity activates a genomic program that shifts metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation toward aerobic glycolysis (see Fig. 7A). Central to this neuronal Warburg effect are increased levels of Pdk3, which attenuate the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase and thus divert pyruvate metabolism away from the TCA cycle. Concomitantly, up-regulation of the mitochondrial uncoupling protein Ucp1 and down-regulation of genes required for oxidative phosphorylation (Atpaf1) and mitochondrial maintenance (Tfam, Tfb2m, Dguok, Mrpl19, and Mrpl44) serve to attenuate mitochondrial activity. Finally, up-regulation of the glucose transporters Glut1 and Glut3 serve to meet the increased glucose demand of aerobic glycolysis, whereas increased Mct1 and Mct4 expression ensures efficient export of l-lactate that is produced during this process. The primary mouse and rat hippocampal cultures used in this study consist of ∼25% astrocytes and 75% neurons (see Fig. 6C). For the interpretation of our results, it is important to consider the glial cell content of the cultures, because the ability of neurons to up-regulate glycolysis has been highly controversial (13.Dienel G.A. Brain lactate metabolism: the discoveries and the controversies.J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2012; 32: 1107-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 14.Bouzier-Sore A.K. Pellerin L. Unraveling the complex metabolic nature of astrocytes.Front. Cell. Neurosci. 2013; 7: 179Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Moreover, some authors claim that MCT1, which we found robustly induced upon stimulation of synaptic activity (Fig. 1, A and F), is an astrocyte-specific protein that serves to shuttle l-lactate from astrocytes to neurons (15.Pellerin L. Bergersen L.H. Halestrap A.P. Pierre K. Cellular and subcellular distribution of monocarboxylate transporters in cultured brain cells and in the adult brain.J. Neurosci. Res. 2005; 79: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 16.Suzuki A. Stern S.A. Bozdagi O. Huntley G.W. Walker R.H. Magistretti P.J. Alberini C.M.

Learning-induced gene expression in the hippocampus reveals a role of neuron-astrocyte metabolic coupling in long term memory.PLoS One. 2015; 10: e0141568Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Thus, we had to consider the possibility that the increased expression of glycolysis-related genes in our mixed cultures is due to their up-regulation in astrocytes. To restrict our gene expression analysis to neurons, we infected rat hippocampal cultures with a rAAV that expresses EGFP from a neuron-specific CaMKII promoter and used FACS to isolate EGFP-positive cells. We used qRT-PCR to compare gene expression between mixed cultures and sorted neurons obtained from sister cultures. Analysis of Gfap and Aqp4 mRNA expression confirmed that FACS-sorted cells were highly depleted of astrocytes (Fig. 3B). Based on the 0.04-fold average expression of glial markers in sorted cells and the presence of 25% glia cells in mixed cultures, we calculated that the FACS-sorted population contained less than 1% glia cells. We found that Mct1 was expressed 0.94 ± 0.14-fold (mean ± S.D.) in purified neurons compared with mixed cultures. This is consistent with a recent in vivo transcriptome analysis that revealed similar Mct1 expression levels in astrocytes and neurons versus a several hundred-fold higher expression level in brain endothelial cells (18.Zhang Y. Chen K. Sloan S.A. Bennett M.L. Scholze A.R. O'Keeffe S. Phatnani H.P. Guarnieri P. Caneda C. Ruderisch N. Deng S. Liddelow S.A. Zhang C. Daneman R.

Neurosci. 2014; 34: 11929-11947Crossref PubMed Scopus (2921) Google Scholar). We also observed that AP bursting-mediated changes in the expression levels of metabolic genes in mixed cultures were similar to the changes observed in the neuron-only population (Fig. 3C). Indeed, up-regulation of Mct1, as well as down-regulation of Atpaf1 and Tfb2m, were even more pronounced when analyzed in purified neurons compared with mixed cultures, indicating that within the mixed cultures activity-dependent gene regulation occurs predominantly in neurons.FIGURE 3Synaptic activity-mediated changes in the expression of metabolism-related genes can be detected in purified neurons.

All graphs show mean, individual values, and 95% CI.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further corroborate these findings, we analyzed activity regulated expression of metabolic genes in “glia-free” primary mouse cortical cultures that contain less than 0.2% astrocytes (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). We again found robust up- and down-regulation of gene expression after 4 h of AP bursting (Fig. 3, D and E). Notably, using this pure neuronal preparation, we detected an activity-mediated decrease in the expression of Mct2, a monocarboxylate transporter that is considered to be required for uptake of l-lactate by neurons. Thus, AP bursting promotes an increased expression of l-lactate exporters Mct1 and Mct4 with a concomitant decrease in expression of the l-lactate importer Mct2. This reciprocal regulation is consistent with the above proposed metabolic shift toward aerobic glycolysis. Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) is a key enzyme that links glycolysis to mitochondrial respiration by converting pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, which is subsequently oxidized in the TCA cycle. The activity of PDH is mainly controlled by its phosphorylation status. In excitable cells, calcium influx stimulates the calcium-dependent pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase, which activates PDH via its dephosphorylation. This mechanism serves to activate mitochondrial respiration under conditions of acute energy demand (19.Glancy B. Balaban R.S. Role of mitochondrial Ca2+ in the regulation of cellular energetics.Biochemistry. 2012; 51: 2959-2973Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). In contrast, PDK-mediated phosphorylation serves to attenuate PDH activity and thus diverts pyruvate away from oxidative phosphorylation. Based on the activity-dependent changes in Pdk3 expression, we examined the short and long term effects of AP bursting on PDH phosphorylation. As expected, when we analyzed PDH phosphorylation at Ser-293 shortly after the induction of AP bursting in primary rat hippocampal cultures, we found pronounced PDH dephosphorylation (Fig. 4, A and B). In contrast, when we kept the neurons bursting for 8 h, i.e. for a sufficient time to express the Warburg gene program, we observed a recovery of PDH phosphorylation despite ongoing calcium-dependent pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase activation (Fig. 4, A and B). This indicates that sustained AP bursting has a biphasic effect on PDH activity, i.e. a rapid calcium-dependent activation that is followed by a slow and gene transcription-dependent inactivation. We note that we cannot rule out the possibility that PDH rephosphorylation is mediated by another kinase than Pdk3. However, given that Pdk4 is expressed at very low levels in our cultures and expression of Pdk1 and Pdk2 are not affected by AP bursting (supplemental Table S2), Pdk3 is by far the most likely candidate. Our findings suggested that synaptic activity drives a gene program that shifts the mechanism of neuronal ATP generation from oxidative phosphorylation toward aerobic glycolysis, which is characterized by increa"
https://openalex.org/W2588015628,"The Ebola virus (EBOV) trimeric envelope glycoprotein (GP) precursors are cleaved into the receptor-binding GP1 and the fusion-mediating GP2 subunits and incorporated into virions to initiate infection. GP1 and GP2 form heterodimers that have 15 or two N-glycosylation sites (NGSs), respectively. Here we investigated the mechanism of how N-glycosylation contributes to GP expression, maturation, and function. As reported before, we found that, although GP1 NGSs are not critical, the two GP2 NGSs, Asn563 and Asn618, are essential for GP function. Further analysis uncovered that Asn563 and Asn618 regulate GP processing, demannosylation, oligomerization, and conformation. Consequently, these two NGSs are required for GP incorporation into EBOV-like particles and HIV type 1 (HIV-1) pseudovirions and determine viral transduction efficiency. Using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we knocked out the two classical endoplasmic reticulum chaperones calnexin (CNX) and/or calreticulin (CRT) and found that both CNX and CRT increase GP expression. Nevertheless, NGSs are not required for the GP interaction with CNX or CRT. Together, we conclude that, although Asn563 and Asn618 are not required for EBOV GP expression, they synergistically regulate its maturation, which determines its functionality."
https://openalex.org/W2588058075,"Because underlying mechanisms of diabetic nephropathy/tubulopathy remained poorly understood, we aimed to define a key protein involving in hyperglycemia-induced renal tubular dysfunction. All altered renal proteins identified from previous large-scale proteome studies were subjected to global protein network analysis, which revealed heat shock protein 60 (HSP60, also known as HSPD1) as the central node of protein-protein interactions. Functional validation was performed using small interfering RNA (siRNA) to knock down HSP60 (siHSP60). At 48 h after exposure to high glucose (HG) (25 mM), Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) renal tubular cells transfected with controlled siRNA (siControl) had significantly increased level of HSP60 compared to normal glucose (NG) (5.5 mM), whereas siHSP60-transfected cells showed a dramatically decreased HSP60 level. siHSP60 modestly increased intracellular protein aggregates in both NG and HG conditions. Luciferin-luciferase assay showed that HG modestly increased intracellular ATP, and siHSP60 further enhanced such an increase. OxyBlot assay showed significantly increased level of oxidized proteins in HG-treated siControl-transfected cells, whereas siHSP60 caused marked increase of oxidized proteins under the NG condition. However, the siHSP60-induced accumulation of oxidized proteins was abolished by HG. In summary, our data demonstrated that HSP60 plays roles in regulation of intracellular protein aggregation, ATP production, and oxidative stress in renal tubular cells. Its involvement in HG-induced tubular cell dysfunction was most likely via regulation of intracellular ATP production.-Aluksanasuwan, S., Sueksakit, K., Fong-ngern, K., Thongboonkerd, V.

https://openalex.org/W2588714631,"Nα-Acetyltransferase 60 (Naa60 or NatF) was recently identified as an unconventional N-terminal acetyltransferase (NAT) because it localizes to organelles, in particular the Golgi apparatus, and has a preference for acetylating N termini of the transmembrane proteins. This knowledge challenged the prevailing view of N-terminal acetylation as a co-translational ribosome-associated process and suggested a new mechanistic functioning for the enzymes responsible for this increasingly recognized protein modification. Crystallography studies on Naa60 were unable to resolve the C-terminal tail of Naa60, which is responsible for the organellar localization. Here, we combined modeling, in vitro assays, and cellular localization studies to investigate the secondary structure and membrane interacting capacity of Naa60. The results show that Naa60 is a peripheral membrane protein. Two amphipathic helices within the Naa60 C terminus bind the membrane directly in a parallel position relative to the lipid bilayer via hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. A peptide corresponding to the C terminus was unstructured in solution and only folded into an α-helical conformation in the presence of liposomes. Computational modeling and cellular mutational analysis revealed the hydrophobic face of two α-helices to be critical for membranous localization. Furthermore, we found a strong and specific binding preference of Naa60 toward membranes containing the phosphatidylinositol PI(4)P, thus possibly explaining the primary residency of Naa60 at the PI(4)P-rich Golgi. In conclusion, we have defined the mode of cytosolic Naa60 anchoring to the Golgi apparatus, most likely occurring post-translationally and specifically facilitating post-translational N-terminal acetylation of many transmembrane proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2588691895,"Uniparental disomy in fission yeast is triggered by aberrant expression of gametogenic genes in vegetative cells, and is associated with the activation of meiotic cohesin Rec8 in cells with defects in the RNA interference machinery. Uniparental disomy (UPD) is a common chromosomal abnormality in which a pair of homologous chromosomes originates from only one parent. It is linked to congenital disorders and cancer, but what triggers UPD has remained unknown. Here, Shiv Grewal and colleagues use fission yeast as a model system to identify the underlying mechanisms behind UPD. They show that defects in the RNA interference machinery lead to high levels of UPD in vegetative cells, with a phenotype distinct from the chromosome segregation defects seen after the loss of centromeric cohesin. In vegetative cells, UPD is associated with the untimely expression of gametogenic genes and can be triggered by the meiotic cohesin Rec8. The authors speculate that inappropriate activation of meiotic gene expression might induce UPD and subsequent tumorigenesis in the somatic cells of higher eukaryotes. Uniparental disomy (UPD), in which an individual contains a pair of homologous chromosomes originating from only one parent, is a frequent phenomenon that is linked to congenital disorders and various cancers1,2. UPD is thought to result mostly from pre- or post-zygotic chromosome missegregation2. However, the factors that drive UPD remain unknown. Here we use the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe as a model to investigate UPD, and show that defects in the RNA interference (RNAi) machinery or in the YTH domain-containing RNA elimination factor Mmi1 cause high levels of UPD in vegetative diploid cells. This phenomenon is not due to defects in heterochromatin assembly at centromeres. Notably, in cells lacking RNAi components or Mmi1, UPD is associated with the untimely expression of gametogenic genes. Deletion of the upregulated gene encoding the meiotic cohesin Rec8 or the cyclin Crs1 suppresses UPD in both RNAi and mmi1 mutants. Moreover, overexpression of Rec8 is sufficient to trigger UPD in wild-type cells. Rec8 expressed in vegetative cells localizes to chromosomal arms and to the centromere core, where it is required for localization of the cohesin subunit Psc3. The centromeric localization of Rec8 and Psc3 promotes UPD by uniquely affecting chromosome segregation, causing a reductional segregation of one homologue. Together, these findings establish the untimely vegetative expression of gametogenic genes as a causative factor of UPD, and provide a solid foundation for understanding this phenomenon, which is linked to diverse human diseases."

JAM-C is a type I transmembrane protein with two conserved immunoglobulin-like domains in the extracellular amino (N)-terminal region (Fig. 1A). At its intracellular carboxyl (C)-terminal region, JAM-C contains a PDZ-binding domain motif, which allows JAM-C to interact with other PDZ motif-containing proteins at the TJ, including ZO-1 and PAR-3 (1.Ebnet K.

JAM-C has been found to regulate leukocyte adhesion and transmigration across endothelial cells through a heterophilic interaction between endothelial JAM-C and leukocyte integrin MAC-1 (αMβ2) (4.Weber C. Fraemohs L. Dejana E. The role of junctional adhesion molecules in vascular inflammation.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 467-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). JAM-C is essential for polarized round spermatids, and JAM-C-deficient mice have defective spermatid differentiation (5.Gliki G. Ebnet K. Aurrand-Lions M. Imhof B.A. Adams R.H.

JAM-C deletion in mice leads to neuropathy, and some Jam-C mutations affect the integrity of the vascular system and brain (6.Guo J. Wang L. Zhang Y. Wu J. Arpag S. Hu B. Imhof B.A. Tian X.

In melanoma cells, the homophilic JAM-C/JAM-C trans-interaction between melanoma cells and endothelial cells promotes metastasis (12.Langer H.F. Orlova V.V. Xie C. Kaul S. Schneider D. Lonsdorf A.S.

Additionally, the JAM-C expression level in fibrosarcoma and lung cancer cells is reported to be positively correlated to metastasis. Knocking down JAM-C in highly metastatic lung cancer cells leads to a decrease in cell migration (8.Hao S. Yang Y. Liu Y. Yang S. Wang G. Xiao J. Liu H.

Cys palmitoylation (S-palmitoylation), a reversible lipid post-translational modification, is the addition of a 16-carbon palmitoyl group onto cysteine residues of proteins via a labile thioester bond. S-Palmitoylation plays a crucial role in cell signaling, localization, and protein-protein interactions (14.Smotrys J.E. Linder M.E. Palmitoylation of intracellular signaling proteins: regulation and function.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 559-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 15.Resh M.D. Fatty acylation of proteins: new insights into membrane targeting of myristoylated and palmitoylated proteins.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). Palmitoyltransferases (DHHCs) catalyze S-palmitoylation. To date, 23 mammalian DHHCs have been identified (16.Fukata M. Fukata Y. Adesnik H. Nicoll R.A. Bredt D.S. Identification of PSD-95 palmitoylating enzymes.Neuron. 2004; 44: 987-996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 17.Linder M.E. Jennings B.C. Mechanism and function of DHHC S-acyltransferases.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2013; 41: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Here we showed that JAM-C undergoes S-palmitoylation on two membrane-proximal cysteine residues (Cys-264 and Cys-265), and this modification can be catalyzed by DHHC7. We found that S-palmitoylation of JAM-C promotes its localization to the cell-cell contact region and regulates cell migration. In addition to a PDZ-binding domain, the JAM-C intracellular C terminus contains two transmembrane proximal cysteine residues (Fig. 1A). These two cysteine residues are conserved across multiple mammalian species, suggesting these residues may have an important role (Fig. 1B). Moreover, JAM-C has been identified in palmitoyl-protein proteomics studies as a protein that potentially has Cys palmitoylation, but it was not validated (18.Kang R. Wan J. Arstikaitis P. Takahashi H. Huang K. Bailey A.O. Thompson J.X. Roth A.F. Drisdel R.C. Mastro R. Green W.N. Yates 3rd, J.R. Davis N.G. El-Husseini A. Neural palmitoyl-proteomics reveals dynamic synaptic palmitoylation.Nature. 2008; 456: 904-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). To test whether S-palmitoylation occurs on JAM-C, we used a metabolic labeling strategy using an alkyne-tagged palmitic acid analogue (Alk14) (19.Yount J.S. Zhang M.M. Hang H.C. Visualization and identification of fatty acylated proteins using chemical reporters.Curr. Protoc. Chem. Biol. 2011; 3: 65-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Wilson J.P. Raghavan A.S. Yang Y.Y. Charron G. Hang H.C. Proteomic analysis of fatty-acylated proteins in mammalian cells with chemical reporters reveals S-acylation of histone H3 variants.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2011; 10 (M110.001198)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Jurkat cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells were cultured in the presence of Alk14, and endogenous JAM-C was immunoprecipitated and conjugated to BODIPY-azide via click chemistry (Fig. 2A). JAM-C had fluorescent labeling, suggesting that it contains fatty acylation (Fig. 2B). Similar results were obtained from ectopically expressed FLAG-tagged JAM-C in human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK-293T) cells (Fig. 2C and supplemental Fig. S1). To further confirm that this modification occurs on cysteine residues, we mutated Cys-264 and Cys-265 to serine. We observed a significant decrease in the fluorescence signal of the single cysteine mutants C264S and C265S. However, the C264S mutation had a more profound effect on the fluorescence signal. Furthermore, we observed no fluorescence signal for the double cysteine mutant C264S/C265S (CCSS for short). These results indicated that S-palmitoylation on JAM-C depends on both Cys-264 and Cys-265 (Fig. 2, D and E). After the samples were treated with 0.5 m hydroxylamine (pH 10.0), most of the fluorescence signal on FLAG-JAM-C was removed (Fig. 2F), further confirming that JAM-C has cysteine palmitoylation. However, there was some hydroxylamine-resistant signal, similar to what was observed with TNF-α, a protein with lysine myristoylation (21.Jiang H. Khan S. Wang Y. Charron G. He B. Sebastian C. Du J. Kim R. Ge E. Mostoslavsky R. Hang H.C. Hao Q. Lin H. SIRT6 regulates TNF-α secretion through hydrolysis of long-chain fatty acyl lysine.Nature. 2013; 496: 110-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). To ensure that the hydroxylamine treatment was sufficient, we compared the labeling of FLAG-JAM-C before and after hydroxylamine treatment with the labeling of the FLAG-TNFα mutant (K19R/K20R), a protein that has only cysteine palmitoylation (21.Jiang H. Khan S. Wang Y. Charron G. He B. Sebastian C. Du J. Kim R. Ge E. Mostoslavsky R. Hang H.C. Hao Q. Lin H. SIRT6 regulates TNF-α secretion through hydrolysis of long-chain fatty acyl lysine.Nature. 2013; 496: 110-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar), as well as other membrane proteins reported to have S-palmitoylation such as transferrin receptor 1 (22.Jing S.Q. Trowbridge I.S. Identification of the intermolecular disulfide bonds of the human transferrin receptor and its lipid-attachment site.EMBO J. 1987; 6: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and Syntaxin6 (18.Kang R. Wan J. Arstikaitis P. Takahashi H. Huang K. Bailey A.O. Thompson J.X. Roth A.F. Drisdel R.C. Mastro R. Green W.N. Yates 3rd, J.R. Davis N.G. El-Husseini A. Neural palmitoyl-proteomics reveals dynamic synaptic palmitoylation.Nature. 2008; 456: 904-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). After hydroxylamine treatment, the majority, if not all, of the labeling on the other proteins was removed. However, some FLAG-JAM-C fluorescence signal remained (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B). However, there was a noticeable decrease in fluorescence signal after hydroxylamine treatment, supporting that JAM-C has cysteine palmitoylation. To determine whether JAM-C has lysine fatty acylation, we mutated all the cytosolic lysine residues to arginine (K276R/K283R/K287R (3KR) and K276R/K283R/K287R/K305R (4KR)) and examined the fatty acylation signal. There was no significant change in the fluorescence signal with the 3KR and 4KR mutants compared with WT JAM-C, suggesting that the fatty acylation we detected for JAM-C does not come from lysine fatty acylation (Fig. 2F). We next wanted to identify palmitoyltransferases that can control JAM-C S-palmitoylation. In mammals, there are 23 DHHC enzymes known to act as palmitoyltransferases. We co-overexpressed HA-tagged DHHC1–23 with FLAG-tagged JAM-C in HEK-293T cells and examined the fatty acylation level using the Alk14 metabolic labeling approach. From the initial DHHC screening and subsequent comparison of JAM-C palmitoylation levels with DHHC7 and DHHC15 overexpressed (Fig. 3, A and B, and supplemental Fig. S3), we decided to further validate DHHC7 as a palmitoyltransferase of JAM-C. However, because the screening result might be complicated by DHHC and JAM-C expression levels, we could not rule out that other DHHCs may also palmitoylate JAM-C. To confirm that DHHC7 can directly catalyze the palmitoylation of JAM-C, we examined the S-palmitoylation of JAM-C with co-expression of wild type DHHC7 and a catalytic dead mutant, DHHS7, in which the conserved catalytic cysteine residue is mutated to serine. As expected, only overexpression of DHHC7, but not DHHS7, augmented the JAM-C fatty acylation level in HEK-293T cells (Fig. 4A). Similar results were also obtained in U87 cells (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that the catalytic activity of DHHC7 is required for the S-palmitoylation of JAM-C. Additionally, we investigated whether DHHC7 could interact with JAM-C. HA-tagged DHHC7 was co-overexpressed with FLAG-tagged JAM-C in HEK-293T cells. We carried out HA and FLAG pulldown experiments. Indeed, HA-tagged DHHC7 was able to pull down FLAG-tagged JAM-C and vice versa, suggesting that JAM-C physically interacts with DHHC7 (Fig. 4C). In contrast, FLAG-JAM-C and HA-DHHC15 did not exhibit a strong interaction as the signal is only slightly above the background on the Western blots (Fig. 4C). Ectopic expression of the DHHCs might affect the selectivity of the enzyme and possibly lead to an increase in S-palmitoylation of nonspecific targets (23.Dietrich L.E. Ungermann C. On the mechanism of protein palmitoylation.EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 1053-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To verify that JAM-C is a palmitoylation target of endogenous DHHC7, we generated DHHC7, DHHC12, and DHHC15 stable knockdown HEK-293T cells using shRNAs targeting DHHC7, DHHC12, and DHHC15 mRNA, respectively. We then examined the JAM-C palmitoylation level (Fig. 5, A–C). Knockdown of DHHC7 led to a decrease in the JAM-C palmitoylation level compared with the control with scrambled shRNA, whereas no significant difference in JAM-C palmitoylation was observed in DHHC12 and DHHC15 knockdown cells. These results demonstrate that JAM-C is a palmitoylation target of endogenous DHHC7. Based on the BioGPS gene database, the DHHC7 gene expression level in the lung is relatively high compared with other tissues. Thus, we also looked at JAM-C palmitoylation in A549 lung cancer cells. DHHC7 stable knockdown in A549 cells decreased JAM-C palmitoylation (Fig. 5, D and E). To further understand the physiological function of JAM-C S-palmitoylation, we investigated whether this modification is required for the TJ localization of JAM-C. FLAG-tagged JAM-C WT and the palmitoylation-deficient CCSS mutant were ectopically expressed in A549 lung cancer cells. The cells were stained with anti-FLAG and anti-ZO-1 antibodies to visualize JAM-C and the TJ, respectively. Images were viewed and analyzed using ZEN 2012 imaging software (Zeiss). Both WT and the CCSS mutant were localized on plasma membrane or intracellular organelles. However, JAM-C WT was more concentrated at the TJ (white arrow) as indicated by the co-localization with ZO-1, whereas the CCSS mutant had very little co-localization with ZO-1 (Fig. 6). The co-localization between JAM-C and ZO-1 was quantified using the Coloc2 plug-in in Fiji software and is presented as the mean of Manders' coefficient (M1 and M2) ±S.D. Thus, S-palmitoylation of JAM-C facilitates its localization to the TJ. Because JAM-C S-palmitoylation affects its localization to the cell-cell contact TJ regions, we wondered whether it would also affect cell-cell adhesion. We therefore decided to check whether JAM-C S-palmitoylation could affect cell migration, which is influenced by cell-cell adhesion. A549 cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged JAM-C WT or the CCSS mutant for 24 h. We used a transwell migration assay, which was performed in a 24-well Transwell plate with 8-μm polycarbonate sterile membranes. Overexpression of JAM-C WT dramatically decreased cell migration compared with control cells that were transfected with an empty vector. In contrast, overexpression of the non-palmitoylatable CCSS mutant only slightly decreased the cell migration compared with control cells that were transfected with an empty vector (Fig. 7, A and B). The difference in cell migration was not due to the variation of cell proliferation as there was no significant difference in cell proliferation when JAM-C WT and the CCSS mutant were overexpressed (data not shown). Thus, S-palmitoylation of JAM-C affects cell migration. Protein lipidation has become a more widely identified class of protein post-translational modifications and has been found to be involved in numerous biological pathways (15.Resh M.D. Fatty acylation of proteins: new insights into membrane targeting of myristoylated and palmitoylated proteins.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar, 24.Resh M.D. Targeting protein lipidation in disease.Trends Mol. Med. 2012; 18: 206-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Here, using a bio-orthogonal palmitic acid probe (19.Yount J.S. Zhang M.M. Hang H.C. Visualization and identification of fatty acylated proteins using chemical reporters.Curr. Protoc. Chem. Biol. 2011; 3: 65-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Wilson J.P. Raghavan A.S. Yang Y.Y. Charron G. Hang H.C. Proteomic analysis of fatty-acylated proteins in mammalian cells with chemical reporters reveals S-acylation of histone H3 variants.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2011; 10 (M110.001198)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (100) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that both endogenous and ectopically expressed JAM-C contain S-palmitoylation. S-Palmitoylation occurs on Cys-264 and Cys-265 of JAM-C. The S-palmitoylation on JAM-C is relatively resistant to hydroxylamine treatment for which the reason remains unclear. Because the hydroxylamine cleavage depends on the environment (25.Iwamoto M. Sudo Y. Shimono K. Kamo N. Selective reaction of hydroxylamine with chromophore during the photocycle of pharaonis phoborhodopsin.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1514: 152-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), one plausible explanation is the S-palmitoylation in the membrane-proximal region of JAM-C may be shielded from hydroxylamine attack. However, the decrease in labeling after hydroxylamine treatment supports that JAM-C has S-palmitoylation, which is further supported by mutagenesis studies. The palmitoylacyltransferase family members share a conserved Asp-His-His-Cys (DHHC)-cysteine-rich domain as a catalytic domain of the enzyme (26.Roth A.F. Feng Y. Chen L. Davis N.G. The yeast DHHC cysteine-rich domain protein Akr1p is a palmitoyl transferase.J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 27.Lobo S. Greentree W.K. Linder M.E.

DHHCs have broad substrate specificity, and how substrate specificity is determined remains unclear. By screening the 23 DHHCs, we have found that overexpression of DHHC7 can substantially increase the JAM-C palmitoylation level. Moreover, we showed that knockdown of DHHC7 decreased the S-palmitoyl level of JAM-C, supporting that JAM-C is a direct palmitoylation target of endogenous DHHC7. Nevertheless, other DHHCs may also be able to regulate JAM-C palmitoylation as some DHHCs have redundant functions and act on the same targets (28.Tian L. McClafferty H. Jeffries O. Shipston M.J. Multiple palmitoyltransferases are required for palmitoylation-dependent regulation of large conductance calcium- and voltage-activated potassium channels.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 23954-23962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). JAM-C has previously been shown to be phosphorylated at Ser-281, and JAM-C localization at the cell-cell contact region is negatively regulated by Ser-281 phosphorylation (29.Mandicourt G. Iden S. Ebnet K. Aurrand-Lions M. Imhof B.A. JAM-C regulates tight junctions and integrin-mediated cell adhesion and migration.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1830-1837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 30.Ebnet K. Aurrand-Lions M. Kuhn A. Kiefer F. Butz S. Zander K. Meyer zu Brickwedde M.K. Suzuki A. Imhof B.A. Vestweber D. The junctional adhesion molecule (JAM) family members JAM-2 and JAM-3 associate with the cell polarity protein PAR-3: a possible role for JAMs in endothelial cell polarity.J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3879-3891Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The JAM-C S281A mutant led to mislocalization and diffusion from the cell-cell contact region. In our case, we observed that JAM-C WT was concentrated at the cell-cell contact region, whereas the CCSS mutant was distributed more evenly on the cell membrane and in the cytosol, which is similar to the effect of S281A. It is therefore possible that there is cross-talk between the phosphorylation and S-palmitoylation of JAM-C. However, we found that the non-phosphorylable JAM-C mutant (S281A) and the phosphomimetic JAM-C mutants (S281D and S281E) had no significant effect on the S-palmitoylation of JAM-C (supplemental Fig. S4). We could not determine whether the CCSS JAM-C mutant can affect the phosphorylation on JAM-C due to the lack of proper antibodies to detect Ser-281 phosphorylation. JAM-C has been reported to have homophilic interactions with JAM-C and heterophilic interactions with other PDZ domain-containing proteins such as ZO-1 and PAR3 at the cell tight junction. A possible explanation for the effect of palmitoylation on JAM-C localization is that S-palmitoylation facilitates the interaction of JAM-C with its interacting partners, leading to the enrichment of JAM-C at the cell-cell contact regions. We demonstrated for the first time that JAM-C palmitoylation can affect cell migration. Overexpression of WT JAM-C decreased migration of A549 cells, but overexpression of the non-palmitoylatable JAM-C mutant did not affect the migration much. S-Palmitoylation of CD44, an adhesion protein, has previously been found to decrease the migration of breast cancer cells, and the invasiveness of cancer is negatively correlated with palmitoylation status of CD44 (31.Babina I.S. McSherry E.A. Donatello S. Hill A.D. Hopkins A.M. A novel mechanism of regulating breast cancer cell migration via palmitoylation-dependent alterations in the lipid raft affiliation of CD44.Breast Cancer Res. 2014; 16: R19Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This is similar to our finding that WT JAM-C decreases the cell migration of A549 cells, but the non-palmitoylatable mutant did not. The effect of JAM-C palmitoylation on cell migration is likely connected to its effect on the cell-cell contact localization of JAM-C and cell tight junction integrity. However, exactly how JAM-C palmitoylation regulates cell migration remains elusive. Currently, only a few substrate proteins for DHHC7 are known, including Fas (32.Rossin A. Durivault J. Chakhtoura-Feghali T. Lounnas N. Gagnoux-Palacios L. Hueber A.O. Fas palmitoylation by the palmitoyl acyltransferase DHHC7 regulates Fas stability.Cell Death Differ. 2015; 22: 643-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), sex steroid receptors (33.Pedram A.

ZDHHC7-mediated S-palmitoylation of Scribble regulates cell polarity.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2016; 12: 686-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Our findings expand the substrate scope of DHHC7, which eventually will help to understand the substrate specificity and function of different DHHCs. Interestingly, a decrease in DHHC7 levels has been related to tumorigenesis (37.Gaspar C. Cardoso J. Franken P. Molenaar L. Morreau H. Möslein G. Sampson J. Boer J.M. de Menezes R.X. Fodde R. Cross-species comparison of human and mouse intestinal polyps reveals conserved mechanisms in adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)-driven tumorigenesis.Am. J. Pathol. 2008; 172: 1363-1380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), suggesting that DHHC7 may play a role in preventing tumorigenesis. Our findings that JAM-C palmitoylation affects cancer cell migration and that DHHC7 directly controls the palmitoylation level of JAM-C suggest that pharmacologically controlling DHHC7 could be a useful strategy to control cancer cell migration and possibly cancer metastasis. However, to fully take advantage of this, a more detailed understanding of the function of DHHC7 is needed. Human JAM-C cDNA was purchased from Transomic (clone ID BC012147). The full-length cDNA was PCR-amplified by Platinum® Pfx DNA polymerase (ThermoFisher) and subcloned into the pCMV-tag 4a vector using the BamHI and EcoRV restriction sites using the following primers: sense, 5′-AGTCAGGGATCCATGGCGCTGAGGCGGCCA-3′; antisense, 5′-AGTCAGGATATCGATCACAAACGATGACTTGTGTCT-3′.

Protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay (PierceTM Coomassie Protein Assay kit). Protein samples were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad) for 90 min. The membrane was blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in TBST (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) and incubated with the primary antibody for 3 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. After washing five times with TBST, the membrane was incubated with the secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was washed five more times with TBST before it was developed in ECL-Plus Western blotting detection reagent (GE Healthcare). The signal was visualized using a Typhoon 9400 variable mode imager (GE Healthcare) with 457-nm excitation and 526-nm detection filters using a photomultiplier tube setting of 600 V (normal sensitivity). The signal was analyzed by ImageQuant TL v2005 and Quantity One (Bio-Rad). Cells were transfected with FLAG-JAM-C in pCMV4a vector. After 24 h, the cells were incubated with 50 μm Alk14 in medium supplemented with 10% FBS for 6 h. Cells were collected and washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) three times. The cell pellets were lysed with 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. The protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay (Pierce Coomassie Protein Assay kit). The expression level of FLAG-JAM-C was confirmed by Western blotting. For FLAG-JAM-C immunoprecipitation, 25 μl of anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel was added into 600 μg of total cell lysate with a final volume of 1 ml in an Eppendorf tube. The samples were gently agitated at 4 °C for 2 h. The samples were then centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C to remove the supernatant. The beads were washed three times with 0.1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. After the last wash, all the buffer was removed. The beads were resuspended in 15 μl of 0.1% Nonidet P-40 buffer. To perform the click reaction, 5.6 μl of the reaction master mixture was added to each sample. The click reaction master mixture contains the following: 3 μl of 1 mm BODIPY-azide in N,N-dimethylformamide, 1 μl of 50 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (Calbiochem) in water, 0.6 μl of 10 mm tris[(1-benzyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)methyl] amine (Sigma) in N,N-dimethylformamide, and 1 μl of 50 mm CuSO4 in water.

The supernatants were transferred into new Eppendorf tubes and loaded for 12% SDS-PAGE. The fluorescence signal was visualized with a Typhoon 9400 variable mode imager using 488-nm excitation and 520-nm detection filters and a photomultiplier tube setting of 550 V (normal sensitivity). The signal was analyzed by ImageQuant TL v2005 and quantified by Quantity One within a linear range of exposure. Different DHHC shRNA lentiviral plasmids in pLKO.1-puro vector were purchased from Sigma (catalogue numbers DHHC7-SHCLNG-NM_017740, shRNA1-TRCN0000143647, shRNA2-TRCN0000275633; DHHC12-SHCLNG-NM_025428; and DHHC15-SHCLNG-NM_144969). To generate the lentiviruses, low passage number HEK-293T cells in a 10-cm3 plates were transfected with 6 μg of each DHHC shRNA, 4 μg of pCMV-dR8.2, and 2 μg of pM2D.G mixed with 36 μl of FuGENE 6 (Promega). The cell media containing the lentiviruses were collected after 48 h by centrifugation and filtered through 0.45-μm syringe filter to remove cell debris. The day before infection, 3 × 105 cells of low passage number HEK-293T cells were split into each well of a 6-well plate and grown overnight in 2 ml of DMEM with 10% FBS. The media were then removed and replaced with a mixture of 1.5 ml of the lentivirus medium collected above, 0.5 ml of fresh DMEM with 10% FBS, and 6 μg/μl Polybrene (Sigma). After 6 h, 3 ml of DMEM with 10% FBS was added to each well, and after 48 h, 1.5 μg/μl puromycin dihydrochloride (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to the cells to select for stable DHHC knockdown cells. A549 cells were transfected with FLAG-JAM-C WT in pCMV4a, the FLAG-tagged CCSS mutant in pCMV4a, or the empty pCMV4a vector (control) for 24 h and then cultured in RPMI 1640 serum-free medium for an additional 14 h. The cell migration assay was performed in a 24-well Transwell plate with 8-μm polycarbonate sterile membrane (Corning Inc.). A total of 3.5 × 104 cells in 200 μl of RPMI 1640 serum-free medium were plated in each upper chamber and then placed in wells containing 600 μl of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS. After 24 h, the cells on the upper surface were detached with a cotton swab, and the upper chambers were fixed. The cells in the lower filter were stained with 0.1% crystal violet for 15 min and then counted. The quantified results represent three random fields of migrated cells. A total of 2 × 105 A549 cells were split into each glass bottom culture dish (MatTek) and cultured overnight. The cells were then transfected with either the FLAG-JAM-C WT in pCMV4a vector or the CCSS mutant. After 24 h, cells were washed twice with 2 ml of 1× PBS (ThermoFisher), fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS on ice for 15 min, and then kept at room temperature for 5 min. Then cells were subsequently washed three times with 2 ml of 1× PBS and incubated with 0.1% saponin (TCI America) with 3% BSA in 1× PBS at room temperature. After 1 h, the blocking solution was removed, and the anti-FLAG antibody (rabbit monoclonal IgG1; 1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology) and the anti-ZO1 antibody (mouse monoclonal IgG1; 1:800; BD Biosciences) in a saponin-BSA solution were added to the cells and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The cells were washed with 1 ml of saponin-BSA solution five times and then incubated with the secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (goat anti-rabbit IgG polyclonal antibody; ThermoFisher; 1:1,000) or Texas Red® (goat anti-mouse IgG polyclonal antibody; ThermoFisher; 1:1,000) in the saponin-BSA solution at room temperature for 1 h. The cells were washed with 1 ml of saponin-BSA solution five times, then mounted with 200 μl of DAPI Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech), and covered with a cover glass. After 24 h, the cells were visualized with a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope with a 63×/1.4 oil immersion objective. Images were viewed and analyzed using ZEN 2012 imaging software.

https://openalex.org/W2588610196,"The mammalian gut microbiota influences various metabolic and physiological processes. Substantial metabolic changes occur during a healthy pregnancy that may be related to microbiota composition dynamics. However, the effect of diet on intestinal microbiota composition and diversity during pregnancy remains unclear. We examined the ileal contents of Huanjiang mini-pigs at two pregnancy stages to determine the effects of dietary nutrient levels on such microbial communities. Animals received either a higher-nutrient (HN) diet formulated to meet US National Research Council requirements or a lower-nutrient (LN) diet that met the Chinese National Feeding Standard recommendations. On day 45 or 75 of pregnancy, sows were euthanized and their ileal contents sampled. Experimental diet and pregnancy stage did not affect ileal bacterial richness or diversity, as determined by Chao1 and ACE species richness measures and Shannon and Simpson indices, respectively. The phyla Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, accounting for 69.99-85.44% and 5.82-15.17% of the total reads, respectively, predominated regardless of diet. At the genus level, diet significantly affected the abundance of Lactobacillus species, which was greater in pigs given HN feed (P < 0.05), but had little impact on that of Megasphaera species (P = 0.096). Pregnancy stage had a minimal effect on Proteobacteria numbers (P = 0.053). The number of bacteria of the phylum Firmicutes and genus Lactobacillus decreased, while that of the phylum Proteobacteria, family Enterobacteriaceae, and genus Bacteroides increased between days 45 and 75 of pregnancy. Of the short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) measured, only propionate levels changed significantly, with higher concentrations observed on day 45 than on day 75. Our findings indicate that Firmicutes and Proteobacteria dominate pregnant sow ileal bacterial profiles. Excepting a tendency for the number of Proteobacteria to increase as pregnancy progressed, pregnancy stage and diet had little effect on ileal microbiotic composition and diversity and luminal SCFA concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W2587841645,"The objective of this study was to determine whether kinematic data collected by the Microsoft Kinect 2 (MK2) could be used to quantify postural stability in healthy subjects. Twelve subjects were recruited for the project, and were instructed to perform a sequence of simple postural stability tasks. The movement sequence was performed as subjects were seated on top of a force platform, and the MK2 was positioned in front of them. This sequence of tasks was performed by each subject under three different postural conditions: “both feet on the ground” (1), “One foot off the ground” (2), and “both feet off the ground” (3). We compared force platform and MK2 data to quantify the degree to which the MK2 was returning reliable data across subjects. We then applied a novel machine-learning paradigm to the MK2 data in order to determine the extent to which data from the MK2 could be used to reliably classify different postural conditions. Our initial comparison of force plate and MK2 data showed a strong agreement between the two devices, with strong Pearson correlations between the trunk centroids “Spine_Mid” (0.85 ± 0.06), “Neck” (0.86 ± 0.07) and “Head” (0.87 ± 0.07), and the center of pressure centroid inferred by the force platform. Mean accuracy for the machine learning classifier from MK2 was 97.0%, with a specific classification accuracy breakdown of 90.9%, 100%, and 100% for conditions 1 through 3, respectively. Mean accuracy for the machine learning classifier derived from the force platform data was lower at 84.4%. We conclude that data from the MK2 has sufficient information content to allow us to classify sequences of tasks being performed under different levels of postural stability. Future studies will focus on validating this protocol on large populations of individuals with actual balance impairments in order to create a toolkit that is clinically validated and available to the medical community."
https://openalex.org/W2588907760,"The plasma membrane of mammalian cells undergoes constitutive endocytosis, endocytic sorting, and recycling, which delivers nutrients to the lysosomes. The receptors, along with membrane lipids, are normally returned to the plasma membrane to sustain this action. It is not known, however, whether this process is influenced by metabolic conditions. Here we report that endocytic recycling requires active mechanistic target of rapamycin (aka mammalian target of rapamycin) (mTORC1), a master metabolic sensor. Upon mTORC1 inactivation, either by starvation or by inhibitor, recycling receptors and plasma membrane lipids, such as transferrin receptors and sphingomyelin, are delivered to the lysosomes. This lysosomal targeting is independent of canonical autophagy: both WT and Atg5−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts responded similarly. Furthermore, we identify hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (Hrs), an endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCORT-0) component, as a downstream target of mTORC1. Hrs requires mTORC1 activity to maintain its protein expression level. Silencing Hrs without decreasing mTORC1 activity is sufficient to target transferrin and sphingomyelin to the lysosomes. It is thus evident that the canonical recycling pathway is under the regulation of mTORC1 and likely most predominant in proliferating cells where mTORC1 is highly active.

https://openalex.org/W2589023257,"Moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI) in children often happen when there’s a sudden blow to the frontal bone, end with long unconscious which can last for hours and progressive cognitive deficits. However, with regard to the influences of moderate TBI during children adulthood, injury-induced alterations of locomotive ability, long-term memory performance, and hippocampal electrophysiological firing changes have not yet been fully identified. In this study, lateral fluid percussion (LFP) method was used to fabricate moderate TBI in motor and somatosensory cortex of the 6-weeks-old mice. The motor function, learning and memory function, extracellular CA1 neural spikes were assessed during acute and subacute phase. Moreover, histopathology was performed on day post injury (DPI) 16 to evaluate the effect of TBI on tissue and cell morphological changes in cortical and hippocampal CA1 subregions. After moderate LFP injury, the 6-weeks-old mice showed severe motor deficits at the early stage in acute phase but gradually recovered later during adulthood. At the time points in acute and subacute phase after TBI, novel object recognition (NOR) ability and spatial memory functions were consistently impaired in TBI mice; hippocampal firing frequency and burst probability were hampered. Analysis of the altered burst firing shows a clear hippocampal theta rhythm drop. These electrophysiological impacts were associated with substantially lowered NOR preference as compared to the sham group during adulthood. These results suggest that moderate TBI introduced at motorsenory cortex in 6-weeks-old mice causes obvious motor and cognitive deficits during their adulthood. While the locomotive ability progressively recovers, the cognitive deficits persisted while the mice mature as adult mice. The cognitive deficits may be attributed to the general suppressing of whole neural network, which could be labeled by marked reduction of excitability in hippocampal CA1 subregion."
https://openalex.org/W2588764869,"The first step in glutamine catabolism is catalysis by the mitochondrial enzyme glutaminase, with a specific isoform, glutaminase C (GAC), being highly expressed in cancer cells. GAC activation requires the formation of homotetramers, promoted by anionic allosteric activators such as inorganic phosphate. This leads to the proper orientation of a flexible loop proximal to the dimer-dimer interface that is essential for catalysis (i.e. the “activation loop”). A major class of allosteric inhibitors of GAC, with the prototype being bis-2-(5-phenylacetamido-1,2,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)ethyl sulfide (BPTES) and the related molecule CB-839, binds to the activation loop and induces the formation of an inactive tetramer (two inhibitors bound per active tetramer). Here we describe a direct readout for monitoring the dynamics of the activation loop of GAC in response to these allosteric inhibitors, as well as allosteric activators, through the substitution of phenylalanine at position 327 with tryptophan (F327W). The tryptophan fluorescence of the GAC(F327W) mutant undergoes a marked quenching upon the binding of BPTES or CB-839, yielding titration profiles that make it possible to measure the binding affinities of these inhibitors for the enzyme. Allosteric activators like phosphate induce the opposite effect (i.e. fluorescence enhancement).

Na+/Ca2+ exchanger(s) Na+, Li+/Ca2+ exchanger heparan sulfate constitutively active N-methyl-d-glucamine 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate. Calcium has well defined roles in secretion of hormones and neurotransmitters, and recently NCLX was implicated in secretion of insulin (9.Nita I.I. Hershfinkel M. Fishman D. Ozeri E. Rutter G.A.

The mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger upregulates glucose dependent Ca2+ signalling linked to insulin secretion.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e46649Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, not much is known about secretion of axon guidance cues and whether calcium plays a role in the establishment of stereotyped gradients of axon guidance cues in vivo. The focus of our research described here is on the NCLX-type exchanger, NCX-9, in Caenorhabditis elegans, for which we identify a role in the development of D-type motor neurons that form a GABAergic commissural motor neuron circuit. NCX-9 is expressed in hypodermal seam cells that secrete UNC-129/BMP, which is a commissural guidance cue for the GABAergic motor neuron circuit. The DD and VD neurons that comprise this GABAergic circuit are spatially positioned along the ventral nerve cord of the animal (10.White J.G. Southgate E. Thomson J.N. Brenner S. The structure of the nervous system of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1986; 314: 1-340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During development, each D-type neuron first extends an anterior process, which then makes a left or right directional choice for dorsal circumferential guidance. Once the commissure reaches its dorsal target, it bifurcates and innervates dorsal muscles (10.White J.G. Southgate E. Thomson J.N. Brenner S. The structure of the nervous system of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1986; 314: 1-340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There are 6 DD neurons and 13 VD neurons, of which only commissures for DD1 and VD2 fasciculate and extend circumferentially along the left side of the worm, whereas the rest migrate circumferentially along the right side. The mechanism by which the commissures in this circuit make the left/right guidance choices is not well understood, but some evidence suggests that interactions between growth cones and extracellular guidance signals may regulate this process (11.Huang X. Huang P. Robinson M.K. Stern M.J. Jin Y.

Wacker I. Schmid C. Hedgecock E.M. Novel genes controlling ventral cord asymmetry and navigation of pioneer axons in C. elegans.Dev. Biol. 2005; 284: 260-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Here we describe novel roles for the C. elegans NCLX-type protein NCX-9 in patterning of the GABAergic VD/DD circuit. NCX-9 functions in the hypodermal seam cells that secrete the axon guidance cue UNC-129/BMP and ncx-9−/− mutants exhibit defects in the stereotyped patterning scheme of the DD/VD circuit. Through genetic approaches, we place NCX-9 into a signaling framework with the UNC-6/netrin RAC-dependent pathway and a LON-2/heparan sulfate (HS) pathway. Finally, we provide in vitro evidence supporting the role for NCX-9 in handling calcium exchange at the mitochondrion. These data provide the first description of Na+/Ca2+ exchange in circuit development in C. elegans and a robust signaling framework for left/right patterning of VD/DD commissures. To examine the expression pattern of ncx-9, we generated a reporter GFP fusion by fusing the ncx-9 promoter sequence to a GFP gene (Fig. 1A). Stable transgenic lines expressing this reporter were examined microscopically to identify the cells in which ncx-9 was expressed. We detected ncx-9 expression in the seam cells of the organism. Seam cells are neuroectodermal cells that are laterally positioned and embedded within the major hypodermis, hyp7, and run longitudinally across both sides of the animal's body (Fig. 1, B and C). Expression of ncx-9 is visible in the seam cells across all larval stages, and expression persists into the adult stage of the organism (Fig. 1B). We analyzed two mutant strains with lesions in the ncx-9 gene; the lesion in the first allele, gk234237, is defined by a premature stop codon, and the second allele, gk773708, results in a glycine to glutamic acid residue change (Fig. 2A). Both lesions occur in close proximity to the α1-repeat domain that facilitates ion exchange (Fig. 2B). The GABAergic commissural circuit in C. elegans is composed of two classes of neurons: the DDs and the VDs. There are a total of 19 DD/VD neurons; 13 of these are of the VD class, and 6 are of the DD class. Within this circuit, there exists a left/right patterning scheme where 17 commissures extend along the right side of the worm, and only two (DD1 and VD2) fasciculate and extend along the left side of the animal's body (Fig. 2C; shown is a simplified schematic of the circuit because the DD and VD commissures first extend an anterior process that subsequently bifurcates and migrates circumferentially). The left/right asymmetric VD/DD commissural pattern is highly stereotyped in wild type organisms. A comprehensive molecular mechanism for asymmetrical patterning within the VD/DD circuit has not been fully established, although a role for various different effectors has been described: the pioneering AVG interneuron, which expresses UNC-6/netrin (12.Hutter H. Wacker I. Schmid C. Hedgecock E.M. Novel genes controlling ventral cord asymmetry and navigation of pioneer axons in C. elegans.Dev. Biol. 2005; 284: 260-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) protein UNC-71 (11.Huang X. Huang P. Robinson M.K. Stern M.J. Jin Y. UNC-71, a disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM) protein, regulates motor axon guidance and sex myoblast migration in C. elegans.Development. 2003; 130: 3147-3161Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and the cadherin HMR-1 (13.Broadbent I.D. Pettitt J. The C. elegans hmr-1 gene can encode a neuronal classic cadherin involved in the regulation of axon fasciculation.Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 59-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We tested whether NCX-9, a hypodermal protein, might have a role in patterning the VD/DD circuit during development. We found that each ncx-9−/− mutant line displayed a significant increase in the ectopic left-sided commissures of the GABAergic VD/DD motor neurons on day 1 of adulthood (Fig. 2, D–F). A representative image of the ectopic left-sided commissural defect is shown in Fig. 2D, which shows multiple ectopic left-sided VD/DD commissures at the posterior of the animal. We found that in ncx-9(gk234237) and ncx-9(gk773708) mutant animals, there is a 3-fold increase in the frequency of left-sided commissures (excluding DD1/VD2) per animal, in comparison with wild type animals that robustly retain the canonical asymmetrical patterning scheme of this circuit (Fig. 2F; p < 0.005 for wild type versus ncx-9(gk234237) mutants; p < 0.005 for wild type versus ncx-9(gk773708) mutants; n = 100 for all strains examined). This phenotype is highly penetrant at 55 and 53% in ncx-9(gk234237) and ncx-9(gk773708), respectively, in comparison with 20% penetrance in wild type animals (Fig. 2G; n = 100 for all strains examined). Furthermore, we generated a trans-heterozygous animal carrying both ncx-9(gk773708) and ncx-9(gk234237) lesions and observed ectopic left-sided commissures in 47% of the animals and a nearly 3-fold increase in the frequency of ectopic left-sided commissures per animal (Fig. 2, F and G; p < 0.005 for wild type versus ncx-9(gk234237)/ncx-9(gk773708) mutants). To confirm that the patterning defect observed in ncx-9 mutants is developmental, we examined patterning of VD/DD commissures in late L2 stage animals and found significant enhancement of defect in ncx-9(gk234237) mutants in comparison with wild type (Fig. 2H; p < 0.05 for wild type versus ncx-9(gk234237) mutants; n = 50 for all strains examined). We next chose to examine whether NCX-9 functions in the hypodermal seam cells to regulate left/right patterning of VD/DD commissures. To examine the functional site of activity of NCX-9 for its role in VD/DD circuit patterning, we used RNAi to knockdown expression of NCX-9 in the strain DMH106 that has RNAi restricted to the hypodermis only. We observed significant enhancement of defect for DMH106 animals injected with dsRNA targeting ncx-9 when compared with DMH106 animals that were not given dsRNA injections targeting ncx-9, showing that ncx-9 is required in the hypodermis to regulate left/right patterning of VD/DD commissures through a cell non-autonomous mechanism (Fig. 2I; n = 100 for each experimental condition). We also used RNAi to knockdown NCX-9 in the strain XE1375, in which RNAi knockdown is restricted to GABAergic neurons (14.Firnhaber C. Hammarlund M. Neuron-specific feeding RNAi in C. elegans and its use in a screen for essential genes required for GABA neuron function.PLoS Genet. 2013; 9: e1003921Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We observed no significant defects in XE1375 animals in which RNAi was used to knock down NCX-9 when compared with control, suggesting that NCX-9 does not function within the GABAergic motor neurons to regulate VD/DD circuit patterning (p = 0.20 versus control). NCX-9 is a homolog of the mammalian mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger NCLX, and we chose to examine whether pharmacological inhibition of mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger using the NCLX-selective antagonist CGP37157 would disrupt mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchange. Wild type animals were fed Escherichia coli strain OP50 mixed with the drug CGP37157 or with DMSO. Animals fed OP50 mixed with the drug showed significant enhancement of defect when compared with animals fed OP50 + DMSO or OP50 alone, suggesting that mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchange plays a significant role in VD/DD left/right patterning (Fig. 2J; n = 100 for each experimental condition). To further investigate the mechanism for left/right patterning within the VD/DD motor neuron circuit, we examined mutants of the UNC-6/netrin signaling pathway. We chose members of the UNC-6/netrin signaling pathway because they have been shown to function during development for circumferential guidance of DD/VD commissures. The signaling pathway downstream of the UNC-6/netrin receptors UNC-40/DCC and UNC-5 bifurcates into two parallel pathways: RAC-dependent signaling and RAC-independent signaling. We examined left/right patterning within the DD/VD circuit in mutants of each pathway. These mutants included ced-10(n1993) (CED-10 is RAC-type GTPase), pak-1(ok488) (PAK-1 is a p21-activated kinase), mig-2(mu28) and mig-2(gm103) (MIG-2 is a RHO-type GTPase), max-2(cy2) (MAX-2 is a p21-activated kinase), unc-40(n324) (UNC-40/DCC is a netrin receptor), and unc-129(ev557) (UNC-129 is a BMP-like member of the TGF-β superfamily). MAX-2 has been implicated in both RAC-dependent and RAC-independent branches of the UNC-6/netrin signaling pathway (15.Lucanic M. Kiley M. Ashcroft N. L'etoile N. Cheng H.J. The Caenorhabditis elegans P21-activated kinases are differentially required for UNC-6/netrin-mediated commissural motor axon guidance.Development. 2006; 133: 4549-4559Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We observed significant defects in left/right patterning for each mutant examined within the UNC-6/netrin signaling pathway as compared with wild type animals (Fig. 3A; *, p < 0.005 for all bars versus wild type; n = 100 for all strains examined), revealing for the first time a role for RAC-dependent and RAC-independent signaling members in left/right patterning within the VD/DD circuit. Next, we investigated whether NCX-9 functions in the RAC-dependent or RAC-independent signaling pathways by testing for enhancement in double mutant animals of each arm of the pathway. We found significant enhancement of left/right patterning defects in max-2(cy2);ncx-9(gk234237) double mutants compared with ncx-9(gk234237) and max-2(cy2) single mutants and failed to observe any significant enhancement in the ncx-9(gk234237);unc-129(ev557), ncx-9(gk234237);ced-10(n1993), ncx-9(gk234237);pak-1(ok488), ncx-9(gk234237);mig-2(mu28), or ncx-9(gk234237);unc-40(n324) double mutants as compared with the single mutant in each case (Fig. 3A; p < 0.005 for max-2(cy2) versus max-2(cy2);ncx-9(gk234237); p = .44 for unc-129(ev557) versus ncx-9(gk234237);unc-129(ev557); p = 0.06 for mig-2(mu28) versus mig-2(mu28);ncx-9(gk234237); p = 0.13 for pak-1(ok448) versus pak-1(ok448);ncx-9(gk234237); p = 0.7 for ced-10(n1993) versus ced-10(n1993);ncx-9(gk234237); p = 0.57 for unc-40(n324) versus unc-40(n324);ncx-9(gk234237); n = 100 for all strains examined). We also examined mig-2(gm103) mutants that carry a MIG-2 gain of function allele and observed significant defects compared with wild type (Fig. 3A; p < 0.005 versus wild type; n = 100). To confirm the enhancement of defects observed in VD/DD left/right patterning in ncx-9(gk234237);max-2(cy2) when compared with max-2(cy2) alone, we examined a second max-2 allele max-2(nv162) and the double mutant ncx-9(gk234237);max-2(nv162). We see enhancement of VD/DD left/right patterning in ncx-9(gk234237);max-2(nv162) in comparison with max-2(nv162), confirming our observation that NCX-9 functions parallel to MAX-2 and netrin RAC-independent signaling (Fig. 3A; p < 0.005 for max-2(nv162) versus ncx-9(gk234237);max-2(nv162); n = 100 for all strains examined). We examined mig-2(gm103) in an ncx-9(gk234237) background and observed no difference in defect when compared with mig-2(gm103) alone (Fig. 3A; p = 0.09 for mig-2(gm103) versus ncx-9(gk234237);mig-2(gm103); n = 100). We also examined the strain LE2336, which carries a constitutively active variant of the netrin receptor UNC-40/DCC (UNC-40(c.a.)) and also generated a strain carrying the constitutively active netrin receptor UNC-40/DCC in an ncx-9(gk234237) background. We do not see VD/DD left/right patterning defects in UNC-40(c.a.) when compared with wild type (Fig. 3A; n = 100 for all strains examined). Interestingly, this strain shows a high degree of circumferential axon guidance defects in VD/DD neurons, suggesting that constitutively active UNC-40/DCC disrupts circumferential axon guidance but does not disrupt left/right-stereotyped patterning. The strain carrying constitutively active UNC-40/DCC in an ncx-9(gk234237) background shows enhancement of defect when compared with wild type and UNC-40(c.a.) (Fig. 3A; p < 0.005 for UNC-40(c.a.) versus UNC-40(c.a.);ncx-9(gk234237); n = 100 for all strains examined). The left/right commissural patterning defect is penetrant in >50% of the population in single mutants of all examined genes within the RAC-dependent and RAC-independent arms of the UNC-6/netrin signaling pathway (Fig. 3B; n = 100 for all strains examined). These mutants also exhibit an increase in the frequency of worms with more severe patterning defects where as many as six commissures are ectopically routed along the left side in some animals examined (Fig. 3B). We observed a major increase in the penetrance of commissural patterning defect in only ncx-9(gk234237);max-2(cy2) double mutants when compared with max-2(cy2) and ncx-9(gk234237) single mutants (Fig. 3B; max-2(cy2) animals exhibit 52% penetrance, whereas ncx-9(gk234237);max-2(cy2) double mutants exhibit 70% penetrance). We also observed several additional defects in ncx-9(gk234237);max-2(cy2) double mutants. Approximately 95% of the progeny for ncx-9(gk234237);max-2(cy2) double mutant animals were embryonically lethal as compared with ∼2% for wild type, ∼2% for ncx-9(gk234237), and ∼4% for max-2(cy2), which further validates a parallel role for NCX-9 and MAX-2 during development (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, ncx-9(gk234237);max-2(cy2) double mutants show a mild but significant enhancement in the average number of VD/DD commissures per animal that fail to reach the dorsal nerve cord when compared with wild type or the single mutants of ncx-9(gk234237) and max-2(cy2) (Fig. 3D; *, p < 0.005 versus wild type; n = 50 for all strains examined). This indicates that NCX-9 may have a role in commissural guidance of VD/DD motor neurons. Together, these data show that NCX-9 functions in the same pathway as RAC-dependent effectors of the UNC-6/netrin signaling pathway to set left/right patterning of the VD/DD GABAergic circuit. We next chose to examine whether disruption of left/right patterning in wild type and mutants is biased across the anterior/posterior axis of the animal. To quantify whether there is a positional anterior or posterior bias toward misrouted VD/DD commissures along the left side of the animal, we used the vulva as a centering reference to divide the anterior/posterior of the worm. Commissures for DD1–4 and VD1–8 generally lie anterior of the vulva, whereas commissures for DD5–6 and VD9–13 lie posterior of the vulva. In wild type and mutants of ncx-9(gk234237), max-2(cy2), and ced-10(n1993), left/right patterning defects are biased toward more posterior VD/DD commissures (Fig. 3E; n = 50 for all strains examined). Interestingly, misexpression of HST-6 in hypodermal cells has been shown to predominantly disrupt the patterning scheme of posterior DB motor neurons (16.Bülow H.E. Tjoe N. Townley R.A. Didiano D. van Kuppevelt T.H. Hobert O. Extracellular sugar modifications provide instructive and cell-specific information for axon-guidance choices.Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 1978-1985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Collectively, this indicates that projection schemes within circuits may be regulated in a spatially restrictive manner. The DA/DB motor neuron circuit in C. elegans also develops a highly stereotyped left/right commissural patterning scheme. A molecular mechanism for left/right-handedness within the cholinergic DA/DB motor neuron circuit of C. elegans has been described (16.Bülow H.E. Tjoe N. Townley R.A. Didiano D. van Kuppevelt T.H. Hobert O. Extracellular sugar modifications provide instructive and cell-specific information for axon-guidance choices.Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 1978-1985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Patterning of the DA/DB motor neurons is established by interactions between axon guidance cues, receptors present on the neuronal growth cone membrane and the extracellular matrix in the surrounding hypodermal cells. We chose to investigate whether ncx-9 and unc-129 regulate commissural patterning schemes beyond the VD/DD circuit and examined stereotyped patterning of the DA/DB commissures inncx-9(gk234237) and unc-129(ev557) mutants. We found that ncx-9(gk234237) mutants maintain stereotyped left/right patterning of DA/DB commissures, suggesting that ncx-9 does not globally regulate patterning in various classes of motor neurons (Fig. 4A, n = 50 for all strains examined). However, we observed a mild but significant defect in DA/DB commissural patterning in unc-129 mutants, suggesting that unc-129 may regulate patterning in the DA/DB motor neuron circuit as well (Fig. 4A). Heparan sulfate modifiers have been shown to play a role in asymmetric patterning of DA/DB motor neurons in C. elegans, and we chose to examine whether the HS pathway regulates commissural patterning in motor neuron circuits other than DA/DB and examined the VD/DD patterning scheme in mutants of HS pathway components (16.Bülow H.E. Tjoe N. Townley R.A. Didiano D. van Kuppevelt T.H. Hobert O. Extracellular sugar modifications provide instructive and cell-specific information for axon-guidance choices.Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 1978-1985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These mutants included lon-2(e678) (LON-2 is a hypodermally expressed heparan sulfate core protein), sdn-1(zh20) (SDN-1 is a neuronally expressed heparan sulfate core protein), hst-2(ok595) (HST-2 is a 2-O-sulfotransferase), and hst-6(ok273) (HST-6 is a 6-O-sulfotransferase). In each case, we observed significant defects in left/right patterning for each mutant as compared with wild type animals (Fig. 4B; *, p < 0.005 versus wild type; n = 100 for all strains examined), revealing that HS core proteins and their modifiers regulate patterning of VD/VD motor neuron commissures. Mutants of hst-2(ok595) are 100% penetrant for defective left/right VD/DD commissural patterning and exhibit the most severe defects, with several mutants exhibiting as many as eight ectopic left-sided VD/DD commissures (Fig. 4C; n = 100 for all strains examined). Next, we investigated whether NCX-9 functions with the HS pathway for left/right VD/DD patterning by testing for enhancement in double mutants. We failed to observe any significant enhancement in the ncx-9(gk234237);lon-2(e678), ncx-9(gk234237);hst-2(ok595), and ncx-9(gk234237);hst-6(ok273) double mutants as compared with the single mutant in each case (Fig. 4B; p = 0.16 forlon-2(e678) versus ncx-9(gk234237);lon-2(e678); p = 0.21 for hst-2(ok595) versus ncx-9(gk234237);hst-2(ok595); p = 0.49 for hst-6(ok273) versus ncx-9(gk234237);hst-6(ok273)). However, we observed significant enhancement of defect in ncx-9(gk234237);sdn-1(zh20) double mutants as compared with the single mutant, suggesting that ncx-9 functions in a pathway parallel to sdn-1 (Fig. 4B; p = 0.02 for sdn-1(zh20) versus ncx-9(gk234237);sdn-1(zh20)). We also examined VD/DD commissural guidance in hst-2 and hst-6 mutant animals and only observed significant defects in commissural guidance for hst-2(ok595) mutant animals as compared with wild type animals (Fig. 4D; *, p < 0.005; n = 50 for all strains examined). Finally, we examined the genetic relationship between HS modifier HST-6 and the UNC-6/netrin receptor UNC-40/DCC for left/right patterning and commissural guidance of VD/DD motor neurons. We observed significant enhancement of left/right patterning in hst-6(ok273);unc-40(n324) double mutants when compared with wild type or single mutants of hst-6(ok273) and unc-40(n324) (Fig. 4E; *, p < 0.005 versus wild type; n = 100 for all strains examined). We also observed significant enhancement of commissural guidance defects in hst-6(ok273);unc-40(n324) double mutants when compared with wi"
https://openalex.org/W2588398905,"Purpose To propose a T2-prepared 3D turbo spin echo (T2prep 3D TSE) sequence for B1-insensitive skeletal muscle T2 mapping and compare its performance with 2D and 3D multi-echo spin echo (MESE) for T2 mapping in thigh muscles of healthy subjects. Methods The performance of 2D MESE, 3D MESE and the proposed T2prep 3D TSE in the presence of transmit B1 and B0 inhomogeneities was first simulated. The thigh muscles of ten young and healthy subjects were then scanned on a 3 T system and T2 mapping was performed using the three sequences. Transmit B1-maps and proton density fat fraction (PDFF) maps were also acquired. The subjects were scanned three times to assess reproducibility. T2 values were compared among sequences and their sensitivity to B1 inhomogeneities was compared to simulation results. Correlations were also determined between T2 values, PDFF and B1. Results The left rectus femoris muscle showed the largest B1 deviations from the nominal value (from 54.2% to 92.9%). Significant negative correlations between T2 values and B1 values were found in the left rectus femoris muscle for 3D MESE (r = -0.72, p<0.001) and 2D MESE (r = -0.71, p<0.001), but not for T2prep 3D TSE (r = -0.32, p = 0.09). Reproducibility of T2 expressed by root mean square coefficients of variation (RMSCVs) were equal to 3.5% in T2prep 3D TSE, 2.6% in 3D MESE and 2.4% in 2D MESE. Significant differences between T2 values of 3D sequences (T2prep 3D TSE and 3D MESE) and 2D MESE were found in all muscles with the highest values for 2D MESE (p<0.05). No significant correlations were found between PDFF and T2 values. Conclusion A strong influence of an inhomogeneous B1 field on the T2 values of 3D MESE and 2D MESE was shown, whereas the proposed T2prep 3D TSE gives B1-insensitive and reproducible thigh muscle T2 mapping."
https://openalex.org/W2587934611,"To overcome the limitations of neoclassical economics, researchers have leveraged tools of statistical physics to build novel theories. The idea was to elucidate the macroscopic features of financial markets from the interaction of its microscopic constituents, the investors. In this framework, the model of the financial agents has been kept separate from that of their interaction. Here, instead, we explore the possibility of letting the interaction topology emerge from the model of the agents’ behavior. Then, we investigate how the emerging cobweb of relationship affects the overall market dynamics. To this aim, we leverage tools from complex systems analysis and nonlinear dynamics, and model the network of mutual influence as the output of a dynamical system describing the edge evolution. In this work, the driver of the link evolution is the relative reputation between possibly coupled agents. The reputation is built differently depending on the extent of rationality of the investors. The continuous edge activation or deactivation induces the emergence of leaders and of peculiar network structures, typical of real influence networks. The subsequent impact on the market dynamics is investigated through extensive numerical simulations in selected scenarios populated by partially rational investors."
https://openalex.org/W2588439884,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an important cause of death and disability worldwide. The relationship between TBI and kidney diseases is largely unknown.We aimed to determine whether TBI is associated with long-term adverse renal outcomes. We performed a nationwide, population-based, propensity score-matched cohort study of 32,152 TBI patients and 128,608 propensity score-matched controls. Data were collected by the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan from 2000 to 2012. Our clinical outcomes were chronic kidney disease (CKD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and the composite endpoint of ESRD or all-cause mortality.The incidence rate of CKD was higher in the TBI than in the control cohort (8.99 vs. 7.4 per 1000 person-years). The TBI patients also showed higher risks of CKD (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08-1.20; P < 0.001) and composite endpoints (aHR 1.08, 95% CI 1.01-1.15; P = 0.022) than the control groups, but the ESRD was not significantly different between the groups. In subgroup analyses, the risks of incident CKD and composite endpoints were significantly raised in TBI patients aged < 65 years and/or without comorbidities. However, the risks of both CKD and composite outcome were little affected by the severity of TBI.TBI has a modest but significant effect on incident CKD and composite endpoint, but not on ESRD alone. TBI patients under 65 are at greater risk of CKD and composite outcome than their older counterparts."

However, yscI null mutants that were trans-complemented with YscI mutants that bind YscF still assembled the needle and secreted Yops, demonstrating that a direct interaction between YscF and YscI is critical for these processes. Consistently, YscI mutants that did not bind YscF resulted in greatly decreased HeLa cell cytotoxicity.

The export apparatus within the MS ring contains five transmembrane proteins: YscR, -S, -T, -U, and -V (14.Diepold A. Wiesand U. Cornelis G.R.

They demonstrated that the assembly process starts with the formation of the YscC secretin in the outer membrane and progresses inward to the MS ring in the inner membrane and then to the cytosolic components, ATPase, and C-ring. After the secretion apparatus is assembled, the needle subunit protein YscF is exported by the nascent injectisome, and it polymerizes into a hollow needle via a poorly characterized process. The T3SS needle has a helical structure, and the needle of Yersinia T3SS consists of a few hundred copies of YscF (17.Loquet A. Sgourakis N.G. Gupta R. Giller K. Riedel D. Goosmann C. Griesinger C.

Berube B.J. Schneewind O. YopR impacts type III needle polymerization in Yersinia species.Mol. Microbiol. 2010; 75: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The inner rod protein YscI and its homologues, such as PscI in Pseudomonas, MxiI in Shigella, and PrgJ in Salmonella, constitute an inner rod protein family (26.Monlezun L. Liebl D. Fenel D. Grandjean T. Berry A. Schoehn G. Dessein R. Faudry E. Attree I. PscI is a type III secretion needle anchoring protein with in vitro polymerization capacities.Mol.

Assembly of the inner rod determines needle length in the type III secretion injectisome.Nature. 2006; 441: 637-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The PrgJ inner rod protein is required for injectisome assembly in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, and a prgJ mutant can only produce the basal body structure without the extended needle (12.Kimbrough T.G.

PscI in Pseudomonas aeruginosa anchors the PscF needle within the secretion apparatus but is not involved in substrate specificity switching (26.Monlezun L. Liebl D. Fenel D. Grandjean T. Berry A.

Taken together, previous studies have shown that the inner rod protein is required for needle assembly in different bacteria; however, the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that the Yersinia inner rod protein YscI directly interacts with YscF and that this interaction depends on the conserved C-terminal domain of YscI. Point mutants of YscI amino acid residues Trp-85 and Ile-86 completely disrupt the binding of YscI to YscF, leading to defective YscF polymerization and substrate export as well as greatly decreased cytotoxicity to HeLa cells. In a yeast two-hybrid screening that aimed to identify interactions among potential components of the T3SS, we found that YscI interacted with YscF. A GST pull-down assay using GST-tagged YscI truncants found that the C-terminal domain of YscI, which is highly conserved among different inner rod protein family members, was essential for binding YscF, whereas GST alone or the N-terminal domain of YscI could not bind to YscF (31.Yang H. Tan Y. Zhang T. Tang L. Wang J. Ke Y. Guo Z. Yang X. Yang R. Du Z. Identification of novel protein-protein interactions of Yersinia pestis type III secretion system by yeast two hybrid system.PLoS One. 2013; 8: e54121Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In the present study, we first wanted to clarify which regions of the YscI C terminus are essential for binding YscF. Four plasmids expressing various glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged YscI mutants with deletions of amino acids 73–82, 83–92, 93–102, or 103–115 were constructed, and the truncated YscI proteins were expressed in E. coli. Purified, GST-tagged YscI and its various mutants were immobilized onto Sepharose 4B beads and incubated overnight with purified, His-tagged YscF. The beads were washed intensively to remove unbound proteins, and bound proteins were detected by immunoblotting. Deletion of amino acid residues 83–92 or 93–102 almost abrogated the binding of YscI to YscF, whereas deletions of residues 73–82 or 103–115 dramatically decreased but did not eliminate binding (Fig. 1). These results demonstrate that amino acid residues 83–102 and 93–102 in the C-terminal domain of YscI are critical for the in vitro interaction between YscF and YscI, whereas the other tested regions had limited effects on binding. To determine whether YscI can bind YscF inside bacterial cells, a co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assay was performed using Y. pestis strains expressing different versions of YscI mutants that were fused to a FLAG tag. We first constructed a yscI null mutant, named ΔyscI, of Y. pestis strain 201. A series of plasmids, in which expression of the YscI deletion mutants was driven by the arabinose-inducible promoter in the pBAD plasmid, was constructed and electrotransformed into the ΔyscI strain to generate strains expressing YscIΔ73–82, YscIΔ83–92, YscIΔ93–102, or YscIΔ103–115 (Table 1). Different concentrations of arabinose were tested for their ability to induce YscI expression, and the level of FLAG-YscI that was induced by 0.2% arabinose was similar to that of the wild-type strain (Fig. 2A); therefore, 0.2% arabinose was used in the following experiments. Immunoblotting detection using an anti-YscI antibody confirmed that the yscI mutant strains that were trans-complemented with the pBAD-YscI plasmids could successfully express native YscI and the various YscI mutants (Fig. 2B). For the co-IP assay, the bacterial strains were grown to the exponential phase in TMH medium at 26 °C and then transferred to 37 °C to fully induce the expression of T3SS. The bacterial cells were lysed, and aliquots of an anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel were added to capture FLAG-tagged YscI and the YscI mutants; the presence of YscF in the immunoprecipitates was detected using a rabbit anti-YscF antibody. We found that YscF was successfully co-immunoprecipitated by FLAG-YscI as well as by the YscIΔ73–82 and YscIΔ103–115 mutants (Fig. 2C). However, no YscF band was detected when using Y. pestis strains expressing the YscIΔ83–92 or YscIΔ93–102 proteins to perform the co-IP assay (Fig. 2C). These results indicate that YscI can bind to YscF and that amino acid residues 83–92 and 93–103 of YscI are essential for binding YscF inside bacteria under physiologically relevant conditions. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that a non-identified third party inside the bacterial cell is involved in this interaction. Although YscIΔ73–82 and YscIΔ103–115 exhibited decreased binding to YscF in the GST pull-down assay, they bound almost as well as wild-type YscI inside bacteria.TABLE 1Strains and plasmids used in this studyStrains or plasmidsDescriptionsSourcesPlasmids pKD46Temperature-sensitive plasmid expressing λRed recombinase under the control of arabinose; AprRef. 36.Du Z.

Microbiol. 2005; 57: 1719-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), we did not observe bands of YscF monomers or multimers with the expected molecular weights. Nevertheless, we unambiguously observed a ladder of bands of polymerized YscF in the wild-type Y. pestis strain (Fig. 3A). YscF polymerization was basically normal in the ΔyscI-CΔ73–82 and ΔyscI-CΔ103–115 strains. In contrast, no ladders of polymerized YscF could be observed in BS3-treated ΔyscI-CΔ83–92 and ΔyscI-CΔ93–102 strains (Fig. 3A). These results imply that the interaction between YscI and YscF might be important for the assembly of the YscF needle, because the ΔyscI-CΔ83–92 and ΔyscI-CΔ93–102 strains, which did not co-immunoprecipitate YscF (Fig. 3), did not produce polymerized YscF (Fig. 3A). We hypothesized that the defect in needle assembly of the ΔyscI-CΔ83–92 and ΔyscI-CΔ93–102 strains were caused by the failure of YscF secretion. To test this hypothesis, proteins that were present in the culture medium of Y. pestis strains harboring various YscI mutations were analyzed by immunoblotting. YscI and YscF are the early substrates of the Yersinia T3SS (23.Edqvist P.J. Olsson J. Lavander M. Sundberg L. Forsberg A. Wolf-Watz H. Lloyd S.A.

Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 4259-4267Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). As expected, large amounts of YscI and YscF were detected in the culture medium of the wild-type strain (Fig. 3B). In contrast, deleting any region of YscI, not only amino acids 83–92 and 93–102, but also residues 73–82 and 103–115, prevented YscF secretion (Fig. 3B). Surprisingly, although the ΔyscI-CΔ73–82 and ΔyscI-CΔ103–115 strains seemed to assemble the YscF needle normally, no secreted YscF was detected in their culture supernatants. These results imply that needle assembly requires the participation of residues 83–102 but not 73–82 and 103–115 of YscI; however, export of YscF requires an intact YscI C-terminal domain that is highly conserved in the rod protein family to regulate the substrate specificity of the Yersinia T3SS (22.Agrain C. Sorg I. Paroz C. Cornelis G.R.

YscI secretion is totally blocked in the ΔyscF strain, and YscF secretion is also blocked in the ΔyscI strain, which is consistent with previous results showing that these proteins are essential for secretion by the T3SS (24.Wood S.E. Jin J. Lloyd S.A. YscP and YscU switch the substrate specificity of the Yersinia type III secretion system by regulating export of the inner rod protein YscI.J.

Together, these results suggest that YscI might assist YscF polymerization and that deleting any region of the C terminus of YscI completely blocks YscF secretion. Knowing that YscF needle assembly requires binding between YscI and YscF, we wondered how substrate secretion would be affected if the binding of YscI to YscF was disrupted. We detected the secretion of several T3SS substrates, including the needle tip protein LcrV that binds to the YopB/D translocon at the tip of the needle, the gatekeeper p"
https://openalex.org/W2588699041,"Bio-logging tags are an important tool for the study of cetaceans, but superficial tags inevitably increase hydrodynamic loading. Substantial forces can be generated by tags on fast-swimming animals, potentially affecting behavior and energetics or promoting early tag removal. Streamlined forms have been used to reduce loading, but these designs can accelerate flow over the top of the tag. This non-axisymmetric flow results in large lift forces (normal to the animal) that become the dominant force component at high speeds. In order to reduce lift and minimize total hydrodynamic loading this work presents a new tag design (Model A) that incorporates a hydrodynamic body, a channel to reduce fluid speed differences above and below the housing and wing to redirect flow to counter lift. Additionally, three derivatives of the Model A design were used to examine the contribution of individual flow control features to overall performance. Hydrodynamic loadings of four models were compared using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The Model A design eliminated all lift force and generated up to ~30 N of downward force in simulated 6 m/s aligned flow. The simulations were validated using particle image velocimetry (PIV) to experimentally characterize the flow around the tag design. The results of these experiments confirm the trends predicted by the simulations and demonstrate the potential benefit of flow control elements for the reduction of tag induced forces on the animal."

The aim of this study was to provide population-representative YLDs of noncommunicable diseases and injuries using a prevalence-based approach, with the disability weight measured in subjects with specific diseases or injuries. We included a total of 44969 adults, who completed the EQ-5D questionnaire as participation in the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2007–2014. We estimated the prevalence of each of 40 conditions identified from the noncommunicable diseases and injuries in the WHO list. Modified condition-specific disability-weight was determined from the adjusted mean difference of the EQ-5D index between the condition and reference groups. Condition-specific YLDs were calculated as the condition’s prevalence multiplied by the condition’s disability-weight. All-cause YLDs, estimated as “number of population × (1 − mean score of EQ-5D)” were 2165 thousands in 39044 thousand adults aged ≥20. The combined YLDs for all 40 conditions accounted for 67.6% of all-cause YLDs, and were 1604, 2126, 8749, and 12847 per 100000 young (age 20−59) males, young females, old (age ≥60) males, and old females, respectively. Back pain/osteoarthritis YLDs were exceptionally large (442/40, 864/146, 2037/836, and 4644/3039 per 100000 young males, young females, old males, and old females, respectively). Back pain, osteoarthritis, depression, diabetes, periodontitis, and stroke accounted for 22.3%, 9.1%, 4.6%, 3.3%, 3.2%, and 2.9% of all-cause YLDs, respectively. In conclusion, this estimation of YLDs using prevalence rates and disability-weights measured in a population-representative survey may form the basis for population-level strategies to prevent age-related worsening of disability."
https://openalex.org/W2588114715,"The expansion of shell disease is an emerging threat to the inshore lobster fisheries in the northeastern United States. The development of models to improve the efficiency and precision of existing monitoring programs is advocated as an important step in mitigating its harmful effects. The objective of this study is to construct a statistical model that could enhance the existing monitoring effort through (1) identification of potential disease-associated abiotic and biotic factors, and (2) estimation of spatial variation in disease prevalence in the lobster fishery. A delta-generalized additive modeling (GAM) approach was applied using bottom trawl survey data collected from 2001–2013 in Long Island Sound, a tidal estuary between New York and Connecticut states. Spatial distribution of shell disease prevalence was found to be strongly influenced by the interactive effects of latitude and longitude, possibly indicative of a geographic origin of shell disease. Bottom temperature, bottom salinity, and depth were also important factors affecting the spatial variability in shell disease prevalence. The delta-GAM projected high disease prevalence in non-surveyed locations. Additionally, a potential spatial discrepancy was found between modeled disease hotspots and survey-based gravity centers of disease prevalence. This study provides a modeling framework to enhance research, monitoring and management of emerging and continuing marine disease threats."
https://openalex.org/W2588350759,"Intrinsic or acquired drug resistance is a major impediment to the successful treatment of women with breast cancer using chemotherapy. We have observed that MCF-7 breast tumor cells selected for resistance to doxorubicin or epirubicin (MCF-7DOX2 and MCF-7EPI cells, respectively) exhibited increased expression of several members of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) gene family (in particular AKR1C3 and AKR1B10) relative to control MCF-7CC cells selected by propagation in the absence of drug. Normal cellular roles for the AKRs include the promotion of estrogen (E2) synthesis from estrone (E1) and the hydroxylation and detoxification of exogenous xenobiotics such as anthracycline chemotherapy drugs. While hydroxylation of anthracyclines strongly attenuates their cytotoxicity, it is unclear whether the enhanced AKR expression in the above anthracycline-resistant cells promotes E2 synthesis and/or alterations in E2 signalling pathways and whether such changes contribute to enhanced survival and anthracycline resistance. To determine the role of AKRs and E2 pathways in doxorubicin resistance, we examined changes in the expression of E2-related genes and proteins upon acquisition of doxorubicin resistance. We also assessed the effects of AKR overexpression or downregulation or the effects of activators or inhibitors of E2-dependent pathways on previously acquired resistance to doxorubicin. In this study we observed that the enhanced AKR expression upon acquisition of anthracycline resistance was, in fact, associated with enhanced E2 production. However, the expression of estrogen receptor α (ERα) was reduced by 2- to 5-fold at the gene transcript level and 2- to 20-fold at the protein level upon acquisition of anthracycline resistance. This was accompanied by an even stronger reduction in ERα phosphorylation and activity, including highly suppressed expression of two proteins under E2-dependent control (Bcl-2 and cyclin D1). The diminished Bcl-2 and cyclin D1 expression would be expected to reduce the growth rate of the cells, a hypothesis which was confirmed in subsequent cell proliferation experiments. AKR1C3 or AKR1B10 overexpression alone had no effect on doxorubicin sensitivity in MCF-7CC cells, while siRNA-mediated knockdown of AKR1C3 and/or AKR1B10 expression had no significant effect on sensitivity to doxorubicin in MCF-7DOX2 or MCF-7EPI cells. This suggested that enhanced or reduced AKR expression/activity is insufficient to confer anthracycline resistance or sensitivity to breast tumor cells, respectively. Rather, it would appear that AKR overexpression acts in concert with other proteins to confer anthracycline resistance, including reduced E2-dependent expression of both an important apoptosis inhibitor (Bcl-2) and a key protein associated with activation of cell cycle-dependent kinases (cyclin D1)."
https://openalex.org/W2588809784,"The Australian per capita consumption of ruminant meat such as beef and lamb has declined over the last two decades. Over the same period, however, per capita consumption of non-ruminant meat such as chicken and pork has continued to increase. Furthermore, it is now observed that the human consumption of kangaroo meat is on the rise. This study investigates the implications of these changes in meat consumption patterns on Green House Gases (GHGs) emission mitigation in Australia using a Vector Auto Regression (VAR) forecasting approach. Our results suggest that the increase will continue in non-ruminant meat consumption and this will not only offset the decline in ruminant meat consumption, but will also raise the overall per capita meat consumption by approximately 1% annually. The per capita GHGs emissions will likely decrease by approximately 2.3% per annum, due to the inclusion of non-ruminant meat in Australian diets. The GHGs emissions can further be reduced if the average Australian consumer partially replaces ruminant meat with kangaroo meat."
https://openalex.org/W2588861697,"Elucidating how life history traits vary geographically is important to understanding variation in population dynamics. Because many aspects of ectotherm life history are climate-dependent, geographic variation in climate is expected to have a large impact on population dynamics through effects on annual survival, body size, growth rate, age at first reproduction, size–fecundity relationship, and reproductive frequency. The Eastern Massasauga (Sistrurus catenatus) is a small, imperiled North American rattlesnake with a distribution centered on the Great Lakes region, where lake effects strongly influence local conditions. To address Eastern Massasauga life history data gaps, we compiled data from 47 study sites representing 38 counties across the range. We used multimodel inference and general linear models with geographic coordinates and annual climate normals as explanatory variables to clarify patterns of variation in life history traits. We found strong evidence for geographic variation in six of nine life history variables. Adult female snout-vent length and neonate mass increased with increasing mean annual precipitation. Litter size decreased with increasing mean temperature, and the size–fecundity relationship and growth prior to first hibernation both increased with increasing latitude. The proportion of gravid females also increased with increasing latitude, but this relationship may be the result of geographically varying detection bias. Our results provide insights into ectotherm life history variation and fill critical data gaps, which will inform Eastern Massasauga conservation efforts by improving biological realism for models of population viability and climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2588934670,"Adaptation of agents through learning or evolution is an important component of the resilience of Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS). Without adaptation, the flexibility of such systems to cope with outside pressures would be much lower. To study the capabilities of CAS to adapt, social simulations with agent-based models (ABMs) provide a helpful tool. However, the value of ABMs for studying adaptation depends on the availability of methodologies for sensitivity analysis that can quantify resilience and adaptation in ABMs. In this paper we propose a sensitivity analysis methodology that is based on comparing time-dependent probability density functions of output of ABMs with and without agent adaptation. The differences between the probability density functions are quantified by the so-called earth-mover's distance. We use this sensitivity analysis methodology to quantify the probability of occurrence of critical transitions and other long-term effects of agent adaptation. To test the potential of this new approach, it is used to analyse the resilience of an ABM of adaptive agents competing for a common-pool resource. Adaptation is shown to contribute positively to the resilience of this ABM. If adaptation proceeds sufficiently fast, it may delay or avert the collapse of this system."
https://openalex.org/W2588544191,"Using the distal molar of a minipig as a model, we studied changes in the microstructural characteristics of apatite crystallites during enamel maturation (16-23 months of postnatal age), and their effects upon the mechanical properties of the enamel coat. The slow rate of tooth development in a pig model enabled us to reveal essential heterochronies in particular components of the maturation process. The maturation changes began along the enamel-dentine junction (EDJ) of the trigonid, spreading subsequently to the outer layers of the enamel coat to appear at the surface zone with a 2-month delay. Correspondingly, at the distal part of the tooth the timing of maturation processes is delayed by 3-5 month compared to the mesial part of the tooth. The early stage of enamel maturation (16-20 months), when the enamel coat is composed almost exclusively of radial prismatic enamel, is characterized by a gradual increase in crystallite thickness (by a mean monthly increment of 3.8 nm); and an increase in the prism width and thickness of crystals composed of elementary crystallites. The late stage of maturation (the last two months prior to tooth eruption), marked with the rapid appearance of the interprismatic matrix (IPM) during which the crystals densely infill spaces between prisms, is characterized by an abrupt decrease in microstrain and abrupt changes in the micromechanical properties of the enamel: a rapid increase in its ability to resist long-term load and its considerable hardening. The results suggest that in terms of crystallization dynamics the processes characterizing the early and late stage of mammalian enamel maturation represent distinct entities. In regards to common features with enamel formation in the tribosphenic molar we argue that the separation of these processes could be a common apomorphy of mammalian amelogenetic dynamics in general."

Two-dimensional and three-dimensional reconstruction optical coherence tomography images of the epidural space were acquired in four stages.In stage 1, real-time two-dimensional and reconstructed three-dimensional optical coherence tomography of the lumbar and thoracic epidural space were successfully acquired. In stage 2, the epidural catheter in the epidural space was successfully traced in the 3D optical coherence tomography images. In stage 3, water injection and lumbar puncture were successfully monitored in all study animals. In stage 4, 10 mL of fresh blood was injected into the epidural space and two-dimensional and three-dimensional optical coherence tomography images were successfully acquired.These animal experiments suggest the potential capability of using an optical coherence tomography-based imaging needle in the directed two-dimensional and three-dimensional visualization of the epidural space. More investigations involving humans are required before optical coherence tomography can be recommended for routine use. However, three-dimensional optical coherence tomography may provide a novel, minimally invasive, and safe way to observe the spinal epidural space, epidural catheter, lumbar puncture hole, and blood patch."

Studies of the contributions of Rap1 to telomere length regulation and transcriptional repression have yielded significant mechanistic insights. However, the mechanism of Rap1 transcriptional activation remains poorly understood because Rap1 is encoded by a single copy essential gene and is involved in many disparate and essential cellular functions, preventing easy interpretation of attempts to directly dissect Rap1 structure-function relationships.

We used Rap1AS to map and characterize a 41-amino acid activation domain (AD) within the Rap1 C terminus. We found that this AD is required for transcription of both chimeric reporter genes and authentic chromosomal Rap1 enhancer-containing target genes. Finally, as predicted for a bona fide AD, mutation of this newly identified AD reduced the efficiency of Rap1 binding to a known transcriptional coactivator TFIID-binding target, Taf5.

Using composite structural information of Kgp and RgpB, we derived a plausible homology model and mechanism of Kgp-regulating zymogenicity. Accordingly, the pro-domain would laterally attach to the catalytic moiety in Kgp and block the active site through an exposed inhibitory loop. This loop features a lysine (Lys129) likely occupying the S1 specificity pocket and exerting latency. Lys129 mutation to glutamate or arginine led to misfolded protein that was degraded in vivo. Mutation to alanine gave milder effects but still strongly diminished proteolytic activity, without affecting the subcellular location of the enzyme. Accordingly, the interactions of Lys129 within the S1 pocket are also essential for correct folding. Uniquely for gingipains, the isolated Kgp pro-domain dimerized through an interface, which partially overlapped with that between the catalytic moiety and the pro-domain within the zymogen, i.e. both complexes are mutually exclusive.

https://openalex.org/W2588777204,"Renal tubular sodium (Na) handling plays a key role in blood pressure (BP) regulation. Several cross-sectional studies reported a positive association between higher proximal tubule fractional reabsorption of Na and BP, but no prospective investigation has been reported of this possible association. Hence, the purpose of this study was to estimate the predictive role of renal Na handling on the risk of incident hypertension and the changes in BP occurring in the 8-year follow-up observation of a sample of initially normotensive men (The Olivetti Heart Study). The study included 294 untreated normotensive non-diabetic men with normal renal function examined twice (1994-95 and 2002-04). Renal tubular Na handling was estimated by exogenous lithium clearance. Fractional reabsorption of Na in proximal and distal tubules was calculated and included in the analysis. At baseline, there was no association between BP and either proximal or distal fractional reabsorption of Na. At the end of the 8-year follow-up, direct associations were observed between baseline proximal (but not distal) Na fractional reabsorption and the changes occurred in systolic and diastolic BP over time (+2.79 and +1.53 mmHg, respectively, per 1SD difference in proximal Na-FR; p<0.01). Also multivariable analysis showed a direct association between baseline proximal Na fractional reabsorption and risk of incident hypertension, independently of potential confounders (OR: 1.34, 95%CI:1.06-1.70). The results of this prospective investigation strongly suggest a causal relationship between an enhanced rate of Na reabsorption in the proximal tubule and the risk of incident hypertension in initially normotensive men."
https://openalex.org/W2588080996,"Background Among various reconstruction methods after wide excision for osteosarcoma, pasteurized autograft is often preferred. While the whole area of the tumor can be assessed for chemotherapy-induced necrosis, one of the important prognostic factors, in other reconstructive techniques, only a portion removed from a wide-resection specimen is available when using pasteurized autograft method. The assessment, therefore, may be unreliable. We analyzed the prognostic significance of the chemotherapy-induced necrosis in osteosarcoma patients who underwent reconstruction with pasteurized autografts. Patients and methods We reviewed the records of osteosarcoma patients who underwent treatment in our institution from 1998 to 2013. Cases of reconstruction with pasteurized autografts were defined as the patient group, and the same number of patients who underwent other reconstruction methods served as controls. Chemotherapy-induced necrosis was evaluated for removed extra-osseous and curetted intramedullary tumor tissues. Results A total of 22 patients were identified; the median age was 15.5 years, and there were 12 males. The most common tumor location was the distal femur. The most common histological subtype was osteoblastic. Median size was 8.1 cm. Disease status was stage IIB in 13 patients and IIA in 9. Median follow-up was 76 months. No differences between the patient and control groups were observed in potential prognostic factors, overall survival, metastasis-free survival, or recurrence-free survival. Univariate analyses demonstrated that histological response was a significant prognostic factor for metastasis-free survival and also significant for recurrence-free survival. Conclusion Chemotherapy-induced necrosis grading, using only available tumor tissues, could be a prognostic factor for osteosarcoma patients receiving pasteurized autografts for reconstructive surgery."
https://openalex.org/W2588683337,"Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK) signaling plays a major role in tumorigenesis and normal development. Sprouty2 (Spry2) attenuates RTK signaling and inhibits processes such as angiogenesis, cell proliferation, migration and survival, which are all upregulated in tumors. Indeed in cancers of the liver, lung, prostate and breast, Spry2 protein levels are markedly decreased correlating with poor patient prognosis and shorter survival. Thus, it is important to understand how expression of Spry2 is regulated. While prior studies have focused on the post-translation regulation of Spry2, very few studies have focused on the transcriptional regulation of SPRY2 gene. Here, we demonstrate that in the human hepatoma cell line, Hep3B, the transcription of SPRY2 is inhibited by the transcription regulating hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs). HIFs are composed of an oxygen regulated alpha subunit (HIF1α or HIF2α) and a beta subunit (HIF1β). Intriguingly, silencing of HIF1α and HIF2α elevates SPRY2 mRNA and protein levels suggesting HIFs reduce the transcription of the SPRY2 promoter. In silico analysis identified ten hypoxia response elements (HREs) in the proximal promoter and first intron of SPRY2. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), we show that HIF1α/2α bind near the putative HREs in the proximal promoter and intron of SPRY2. Our studies demonstrated that not only is the SPRY2 promoter methylated, but silencing HIF1α/2α reduced the methylation. ChIP assays also showed DNA methyltransferase1 (DNMT1) binding to the proximal promoter and first intron of SPRY2 and silencing HIF1α/2α decreased this association. Additionally, silencing of DNMT1 mimicked the HIF1α/2α silencing-mediated increase in SPRY2 mRNA and protein. While simultaneous silencing of HIF1α/2α and DNMT1 increased SPRY2 mRNA a little more, the increase was not additive suggesting a common mechanism by which DNMT1 and HIF1α/2α regulate SPRY2 transcription. Together these data suggest that the transcription of SPRY2 is inhibited by HIFs, in part, via DNMT1- mediated methylation."

However, iron deficiency is associated with appetite loss. In addition, calorie restriction is reported to prevent the development of end-stage renal pathology in CKD rats. Thus, the beneficial effect of iron restriction on renal damage may depend on calorie restriction. Here, we investigate the effect of pair-feeding iron restriction on renal damage in a rat model of CKD.First, to determine the amount of food intake, Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly given an ad libitum normal diet or an iron-restricted diet, and the food intake was measured. Second, CKD was induced by a 5/6 nephrectomy in SD rats, and CKD rats were given either a pair-feeding normal or iron-restricted diet.Food intake was reduced in the iron-restricted diet group compared to the normal diet group of SD rats for 16 weeks (mean food intake; normal diet group and iron-restricted diet group: 25 and 20 g/day, respectively). Based on the initial experiments, CKD rats received either a pair-feeding normal or iron-restricted diet (20 g/day) for 16 weeks. Importantly, pair-feeding iron restriction prevented the development of proteinuria, glomerulosclerosis, and tubulointerstitial damage in CKD rats. Interestingly, pair-feeding iron restriction attenuated renal expression of nuclear mineralocorticoid receptor in CKD rats.Pair-feeding iron restriction affected renal damage in a rat model of CKD."
