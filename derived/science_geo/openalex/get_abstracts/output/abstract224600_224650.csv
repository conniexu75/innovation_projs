Theoretically, it is possible to scan the image or its photograph mechanically; but this has seldom been done in practice. The whole method of obtaining resolution by lenses involves so much loss of light, lack of control of contrast, and other difficulties, that it is difficult to provide a good display or method of scanning."

https://openalex.org/W2072577624,"IN an earlier communication1 reference was made to the possibility of using track radiography as a means of detecting and estimating the content of radioactive isotopes in biological specimens. Since that note was published, further work using a new ‘liquid-emulsion’ technique has brought us nearer the goal of successful quantitative estimations. The experimental technique employed was briefly as follows."

https://openalex.org/W2029561094,"THE greater part of Canada, particularly the northern forest and subarctic regions, is infested during the summer months by many species of Aedes mosquitoes. Following two years of laboratory investigation of the factors which attract mosquitoes to an animal body, an opportunity was given by the Defence Research Board and the Division of Entomology, Department of Agriculture, to study the responses of the female mosquitoes in the field, both in Ontario and in the interior of Labrador. For this purpose two stainless-steel tanks, each containing 100 lb. of water, were set up 6 ft. apart in a forest glade. They were electrically heated to a constant temperature of 98° F., clothed in a felt shirt and black crepe jerkin, and so shaped and mounted that they resembled dummy men; on occasion a head was added with an orifice for the exhalation of gases."

https://openalex.org/W2081817805,"THE hydrolysis of fats in a dilute sulphuric acid medium using a catalyst commonly known as Twitchell reagent has been believed for nearly half a century1 to take place at the interface of oil and water, the reagent fulfilling the function of an efficient emulsifier. Recently, however, Lascaray2 suggested that the reaction is essentially homogeneous and is carried out in the oil phase under the influence of water dissolved in this phase. Convincing as his arguments are, he did not consider the kinetic order of the reaction, the study of which proved valuable in elucidating the related fat hydrolysis by acidification3. This omission was probably due to the existence of an induction period in the Twitchell process which tends to obscure its kinetics."

https://openalex.org/W4241962354,"IT has been shown in a previous communication1 that the structure of adenylthiomethylpentose is 9′-(5-thiomethyl-ribofuranosyl)-adenine, based on periodate titration of adenylthiomethylpentose, thiosugar and thiopentitol, and from the result of the Boeseken test upon adenylthiomethylpentose. We have now obtained further evidence for this structural formula using synthetic methods."

This substance, apparently an albumin, when added to non-activated plasma (without addition of brain thromboplastin), acts as an inhibitor of plasma coagulation."

https://openalex.org/W2064832698,"IT is well known since the work by Pickles1, and Morton and Pickles2, that cholera filtrates and trypsin alter the Rh-positive cells with the result that they become agglutinable in saline by anti-Rh pure blocking antibodies. On the other hand, Race and Sanger3 have recently described a chromosome alteration in an individual lacking all antigens at the Cc and Ee loci, with an extraordinarily strong D antigen, as judged by its avidity for anti-D. This particular blood was found to be agglutinated by pure blocking anti-D diluted in saline."

https://openalex.org/W1999865514,"ALTHOUGH the presence of diastatic enzymes in the saliva of frogs was originally announced by R. Lepine in 18701 and confirmed by R. J. Junold in 19332, its presence seems so largely to have escaped notice that a fresh investigation using newer techniques is not uncalled for, especially since neither author took the precaution of excluding bacterial enzymes, or made any attempt to determine the precise nature of the reactions involved."

https://openalex.org/W1983672362,"ATTEMPTS have been made to determine whether pure tones of equal loudness but different pitch are also different in quality, and whether it is possible to find frequency differential thresholds for the quality differences. Following the usual practice, the terms ‘loudness’, ‘pitch’ and ‘quality’ are used to refer specifically to auditory sensations, while ‘intensity’ and ‘frequency’ refer to characteristics of the soundwave stimulus. In this preliminary work, the experimenter was the subject for the comparisons, which were made monaurally with an earphone."

We therefore wish to report in brief the results of our first investigations into the subject."

https://openalex.org/W2094604958,"IT is well known that certain binary mixtures of organic liquids show opalescence at suitable temperatures. It was first shown by Krishnan1 that the value of the factor of depolarization of the light scattered transversely by such a mixture with the incident light vector horizontal is different from unity, and this was ascribed by him to the formation of large clusters of molecules in the mixture. Although the opalescence is certainly produced by local fluctuations in density, the light-scattering data cannot furnish definite information regarding the actual composition of the particles producing the opalescence. It has, however, been shown recently by Sirkar and Sen2 and also by Sen3 that many ordinary organic liquids having polar molecules exhibit strong absorption in the ultra high-frequency region at suitable temperatures, and that the frequency in the region of absorption gives us an idea about the magnitude of viscous forces acting on the individual molecules, as pointed out by earlier workers. Since such viscous forces are produced by the surrounding molecules, any change in the intermolecular field produces a change in the frequency of the region of absorption of the ultra high-frequency radio waves, and this method is thus suitable for studying the nature of the intermolecular field acting on the individual polar molecule in opalescent binary liquid mixture. A programme for studying the absorption of ultra high-frequency radio waves in such opalescent mixtures has, therefore, been undertaken and the results obtained in the case of two such mixtures are discussed here."
