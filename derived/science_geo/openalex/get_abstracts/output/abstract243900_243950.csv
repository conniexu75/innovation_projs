https://openalex.org/W1984102626,"RECENT work by one of us (F. W. S.) has emphasized the possible cosmological significance of the study of the isotropic component of cosmic γ-radiation between 1 and 100 MeV energy1–3. Vette et al. (ref. 4 and unpublished) have presented evidence for a new component of isotropic γ-radiation above 1 MeV energy being distinct in nature and origin from that at lower energies. At present, these data are consistent only with the hypothesis previously discussed5,6 that these γ-rays are the redshifted remnant of cosmic-ray interactions producing pions at an earlier stage in the evolution of the universe corresponding to a redshift z≃100."

https://openalex.org/W2066247480,"No evidence of transverse grain boundaries has been found in high modulus graphite fibres by high resolution phase contrast microscopy. Instead, the graphite planes have been found to flow over long distances in the direction of the fibre axis coalescing to graphite “crystallite” regions. The latter have the size and shape already suggested by X-ray diffraction techniques. The planes literally “flow” around intruding material, and evidence for elongated voids is occasionally found."

Shaw1 succeeded in detecting it at concentrations between 0.06 and 0.28 p.p.m. in four of the eleven marine sediments that he examined. No figures seem to have been published yet for the occurrence of the element in seawater, although Baric and Branica2 have deduced from polarographic studies of saturated solutions of indium in seawater medium that its concentration should be 10−10 M. We have determined indium at four depths in the water column at Discovery Station 6917 (23° 00′ N, 18° 42′ W, depth 3,100 m). ‘Millipore’ filtration (0.45 µm) and preliminary concentration of the indium (by means of chelating ion exchange3) were carried out at sea immediately after the samples had been collected. The recovered indium was purified by anion exchange using ‘Dowex AG2–X8’ and then irradiated with thermal neutrons at a flux of 5 × 1012 neutrons cm−2 s−1 for four weeks. The irradiated sample was taken up in concentrated hydrochloric acid, equilibrated with 15 mg of inert indium as carrier and submitted to a twelve stage radio-chemical separation to free the 114In from other radioactive species. Indium was converted to its oxinate for determination of the chemical yield (∼ 60 per cent) and for β-counting. The identity of the separated 114In activity was confirmed by measurement of the half-life, plotting an aluminium absorption curve, and by γ-spectrometry. The concentrations of indium found at depths of 2, 500, 1,000 and 2,000 m were 0.31 ± 0.02, 0.12 ± 0.01, 0.10 ± 0.01 and 0.11 ± 0.01 ng/l. respectively. These concentrations are of the order of a hundred times less than those predicted by Baric and Branica2. Neutron activation analysis was also used to determine indium in three deep sea sediments. The concentration of indium found in the argillaceous sediment is identical with that found by Shaw1 in a red clay from the Equatorial Pacific. He was, however, unable to detect indium in a siliceous ooze or in a calcareous ooze."

https://openalex.org/W1963828817,"RECENT work in this laboratory has confirmed that the pores in the sieve plates of functioning phloem are normally occluded, fairly densely, with slime fibrils. Stems of Helianthus seedlings and thin stolons of Saxifraga sarmentosa were plunged into briskly boiling water for 3 min before conventional fixation in glutaraldehyde and osmium, embedding and sectioning for electron microscopy, In almost all cases, the pores in the sieve plates appeared plugged with densely-staining material (Fig. 1a and b); where this was not obvious the micrographs strongly suggested that the section had passed between the shrunken plug and the pore wall. We regard these observations as evidence against the views often put forward that the plugging is an artefact of preparation caused either by longitudinal turgor release or by local enzyme action1,2."
