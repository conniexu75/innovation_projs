https://openalex.org/W2161584310,"A cDNA clone for a new metabotropic glutamate receptor, mGluR5, was isolated through polymerase chain reaction-mediated DNA amplification by using primer sequences conserved among the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) family and by the subsequent screening of a rat brain cDNA library. The cloned receptor consists of 1171 amino acid residues and exhibits a structural architecture common to the mGluR family, possessing a large extracellular domain preceding the seven putative membrane-spanning segments. mGluR5 shows the highest sequence similarity to mGluR1 among the mGluR members and is coupled to the stimulation of phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis/Ca2+ signal transduction in Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with the cloned cDNA. This receptor also resembles mGluR1 in its agonist selectivity and antagonist responses; the potency rank order of agonists for mGluR5 was determined to be quisqualate greater than L-glutamate greater than or equal to ibotenate greater than trans-1-aminocyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylate. Blot and in situ hybridization analyses indicated that mGluR5 mRNA is widely distributed in neuronal cells of the central nervous system and is expressed differently from mGluR1 mRNA in many brain regions. This investigation thus demonstrates that there is an additional mGluR subtype which closely resembles mGluR1 in its signal transduction and pharmacological properties and is expressed in specialized neuronal cells in the central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2043745393,"Between 650 and 2000 different peptides are associated with the major histocompatibility complex class II molecule I-Ad. Sequences for nine of these were obtained by a combination of automated Edman degradation and tandem mass spectrometry. All of the peptides are derived from secretory or integral membrane proteins that are synthesized by the antigen-presenting cell itself. Peptides were 16 to 18 residues long, had ragged NH2-and COOH-termini, and contained a six-residue binding motif that was variably placed within the peptide chain. Binding data on truncated peptides suggest that the peptide binding groove on class II molecules can be open at both ends."

https://openalex.org/W1574816328,"The bacterial phosphotriesterase has been found to require a divalent cation for enzymatic activity. This enzyme catalyzes the detoxification of organophosphorus insecticides and nerve agents. In an Escherichia coli expression system significantly higher concentrations of active enzyme could be produced when 1.0 mM concentrations of Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, and Cd2+ were included in the growth medium. The isolated enzymes contained up to 2 equivalents of these metal ions as determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy. The catalytic activity of the various metal enzyme derivatives was lost upon incubation with EDTA, 1,10-phenanthroline, and 8-hydroxyquinoline-5-sulfonic acid. Protection against inactivation by metal chelation was afforded by the binding of competitive inhibitors, suggesting that at least one metal is at or near the active site. Apoenzyme was prepared by incubation of the phosphotriesterase with beta-mercaptoethanol and EDTA for 2 days. Full recovery of enzymatic activity could be obtained by incubation of the apoenzyme with 2 equivalents of Zn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cd2+, or Mn2+. The 113Cd NMR spectrum of enzyme containing 2 equivalents of 113Cd2+ showed two resonances at 120 and 215 ppm downfield from Cd(ClO4)2. The NMR data are consistent with nitrogen (histidine) and oxygen ligands to the metal centers."
https://openalex.org/W2169699681,"A 93 kd polypeptide associated with the mammalian inhibitory glycine receptor (GlyR) is localized at central synapses and binds with high affinity to polymerized tubulin. This protein, named gephyrin (from the Greek gamma epsilon phi upsilon rho alpha, bridge), is thought to anchor the GlyR to subsynaptic microtubules. Here we report its primary structure deduced from cDNA and show that corresponding transcripts are found in all rat tissues examined. In brain, at least five different gephyrin mRNAs are generated by alternative splicing. Expression of gephyrin cDNAs in 293 kidney cells yields polypeptides reactive with a gephyrin-specific antibody, which coprecipitate with polymerized tubulin. Thus, gephyrin may define a novel type of microtubule-associated protein involved in membrane protein-cytoskeleton interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1495307817,"The human platelet thrombin receptor is activated when thrombin cleaves its receptor's amino-terminal extension to reveal a new amino terminus that functions as a tethered peptide ligand. Exactly how this peptide remains cryptic within the uncleaved receptor and becomes functional after receptor cleavage is unknown. In this report we define the structural features of the thrombin receptor's agonist peptide domain important for receptor activation. Studies with mutant thrombin receptors have suggested that agonist peptide domain residues 2-6 contained determinants critical for receptor activation, and the synthetic peptide SFLLR-NH2 representing the 1st 5 amino-terminal residues of the agonist peptide domain was sufficient to specify agonist activity. Acetylating or removing the agonist peptide's amino-terminal ammonium group greatly attenuated agonist activity. Agonist peptide residue Phe2 was vital for agonist function; residues Leu4 and Arg5 individually played less important roles. These structure-function relationships held for both platelet activation and activation of the cloned receptor expressed in transfected mammalian cells. Our studies suggest that structures at the extreme amino terminus of the thrombin receptor's agonist peptide domain, in particular the free ammonium group of Ser1 and the phenyl ring of Phe2, are critical for receptor activation and that the agonist function of this domain is expressed when receptor proteolysis unmasks such determinants. In addition to revealing details of the thrombin receptor's proteolytic triggering mechanism, these studies open avenues to the development of drugs targeting the thrombin receptor and to further definition for the role of the thrombin receptor in cellular regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1778185206,"We sought to investigate effects of lipoprotein lipase (LpL) on cellular catabolism of lipoproteins rich in apolipoprotein B-100. LpL increased cellular degradation of lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) by 277% +/- 3.8% and 32.5% +/- 4.1%, respectively, and cell association by 509% +/- 8.7% and 83.9% +/- 4.0%. The enhanced degradation was entirely lysosomal. Enhanced degradation of Lp(a) had at least two components, one LDL receptor-dependent and unaffected by heparitinase digestion of the cells, and the other LDL receptor-independent and heparitinase-sensitive. The effect of LpL on LDL degradation was entirely LDL receptor-independent, heparitinase-sensitive, and essentially absent from mutant Chinese hamster ovary cells that lack cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Enhanced cell association of Lp(a) and LDL was largely LDL receptor-independent and heparitinase-sensitive. The ability of LpL to reduce net secretion of apolipoprotein B-100 by HepG2 cells by enhancing cellular reuptake of nascent lipoproteins was also LDL receptor-independent and heparitinase-sensitive. None of these effects on Lp(a), LDL, or nascent lipoproteins required LpL enzymatic activity. We conclude that LpL promotes binding of apolipoprotein B-100-rich lipoproteins to cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans. LpL also enhanced the otherwise weak binding of Lp(a) to LDL receptors. The heparan sulfate proteoglycan pathway represents a novel catabolic mechanism that may allow substantial cellular and interstitial accumulation of cholesteryl ester-rich lipoproteins, independent of feedback inhibition by cellular sterol content."
https://openalex.org/W1572331504,"To determine if singlet oxygen (O2(1 delta g)) is produced by neutrophils (PMNs) during the process of phagocytosis, glass beads were coated with a specific chemical trap for O2(1 delta g), 9,10-diphenylanthracene (DPA). Singlet oxygen, but not other reactive oxygen species, reacts rapidly with DPA at a rate of kr = 1.3 x 10(6) M-1 s-1 to form a stable product, DPA-endoperoxide (Corey, E. J., and Taylor, W. C. (1964) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 86, 3881-3882; Wasserman, H. H., Scheffer, J. R., and Cooper, J. L. (1972) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 94, 4991-4996; Turro, N. J., Chow, M.-F., and Rigaudy, J. (1981) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 103, 7218-7224). The production of DPA-endoperoxide was determined by ultraviolet spectroscopy as a decrease in DPA absorbance at 355 nm. The absorbance of DPA was normalized to the absorbance of perylene, which was included in the coating on the beads as a nonreactive, internal standard. In the present study, DPA- and perylene-coated beads were initially allowed to adhere to fibronectin-coated coverslips. PMNs were then added to the bead-coated coverslips and allowed to adhere and phagocytose the beads for 1 h at 37 degrees C. In some experiments, 4B-phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) (1 ng/2.5 x 10(7) cells/ml), a known activator of the PMN NADPH-oxidase, was added as a co-stimulant. The amount of O2(1 delta g) produced by phagocytically stimulated PMNs was calculated to be 11.3 +/- 4.9 nmol of O2(1 delta g)/1.25 x 10(6) cells. Low dose PMA co-stimulation increased the production of O2(1 delta g) to 14.1 +/- 4.1 nmol/1.25 x 10(6) cells. Averaged together these amounts represent approximately 19 +/- 5.0% of the total oxygen consumed by PMNs in response to DPA- and perylene-coated beads. The specificity of the DPA reaction with O2(1 delta g) was confirmed by warming to 120 degrees C, which releases O2(1 delta g) from the DPA-endoperoxide, regenerating the parent DPA compound (Wasserman et al., 1972; Turro et al., 1981) and the absorbance at 355 nm. In addition, beta-carotene, an avid quencher of O2(1 delta g), was included in the coating of some bead preparations; assays in which these beads were used showed no change in the absorbance at 355 nm. Singlet oxygen production by myeloperoxidase was also measured using the coated bead assay and the results suggest that this is a major pathway by which singlet oxygen is generated in phagocytically stimulated PMNs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

https://openalex.org/W1983396112,"Voltage-gated Na+ channels, which are responsible for the generation of action potentials in brain, are phosphorylated by CAMP-dependent protein kinase in vitro and in intact neurons. Phosphorylation by CAMP-dependent protein kinase reduces peak Na+ currents 40%–50% in membrane patches excised from rat brain neurons or from CHO cells expressing type IIA Na+ channels. Inhibition of basal cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity by transfection with a plasmid encoding a dominant negative mutant regulatory subunit increases Na+ channel number and activity, indicating that even the basal level of kinase activity is sufficient to reduce Na+ channel activity significantly. Na+currents in membrane patches from kinase-deficient cells were reduced up to 80% by phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase. These effects could be blocked by a specific peptide inhibitor of CAMP-dependent protein kinase and reversed by phosphoprotein phosphatases. Convergent modulation of brain Na+ channels by neurotransmitters acting through the CAMP and protein kinase C signaling pathways may result in associative regulation of electrical activity by different synaptic inputs."
https://openalex.org/W2129115464,"In CCL39 cells transfected with m1-muscarinic receptors, carbachol stimulates phosphoinositide turnover and early events associated with mitogenesis as efficiently as thrombin but, in contrast to thrombin, fails to induce cell proliferation (Seuwen, K., Kahan, C., Hartmann, T., and Pouyssegur, J. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 22292-22299). We show here that the action of the two agents can be dissociated at the level of S6 kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) activation. Mitogenic concentrations of thrombin and basic FGF were found to stimulate S6 kinase activity, measured in whole cell lysates, with a biphasic time course; an early peak of activity is induced 10 min following stimulation and a sustained phase of activity can be measured over several hours. A very similar profile emerged for p44 MAP kinase (p44mapk), assayed in immunoprecipitates. In this case, the activity first peaks at 6-8 min, preceding S6 kinase. In contrast to thrombin and FGF, carbachol stimulates S6 kinase and MAP kinase only transiently, corresponding to the first peak of activity, but the sustained phase is not observed. Similarly, phorbol dibutyrate induces an early phase of activity only. Pertussis toxin (PTX), which is known to block thrombin mitogenicity efficiently, inhibited the first peak of thrombin-induced S6 kinase and MAP kinase activity only partially, but totally blocked the sustained phase. The toxin had no effect on FGF-induced kinase activities. The cAMP elevating hormone PGE1 did not inhibit p44mapk or S6 kinase activation by thrombin or FGF, demonstrating that the PTX-sensitive signal generated by thrombin does not depend on a Gi-mediated sustained inhibition of adenylylcyclase. Surprisingly, PGE1 was found to stimulate sustained phase S6 kinase activity both alone and in synergy with FGF or thrombin. This result, as well as the biphasic activation of S6 kinase by thrombin, could be qualitatively reproduced in immunocomplex kinase assays using an antiserum immunoprecipitating p70 S6 kinase (p70S6k). Our data show that activation of phosphoinositide turnover and PKC does not quantitatively explain thrombin action, in particular the sustained phase of kinase activities, which critically depends on a PTX-sensitive signal different from adenylylcyclase inhibition. We postulate that this signal does not exclusively originate from the recently identified G protein-coupled thrombin receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1516407063,"The endothelial angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE; EC 3.4.15.1) has recently been shown to contain two large homologous domains (called here the N and C domains), each being a zinc-dependent dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase. To further characterize the two active sites of ACE, we have investigated their interaction with four competitive ACE inhibitors, which are all potent antihypertensive drugs. The binding of [3H] trandolaprilat to the two active sites was examined using the wild-type ACE and four ACE mutants each containing only one intact domain, the other domain being either deleted or inactivated by point mutation of the zinc-coordinating histidines. In contrast with all the previous studies, which suggested the presence of a single high affinity inhibitor binding site in ACE, the present study shows that both the N and C domains of ACE contain a high affinity inhibitor binding site (KD = 3 and 1 X 10(-10) M, respectively, at pH 7.5, 4 degrees C, and 100 mM NaCl). Chloride stabilizes the enzyme-inhibitor complex for each domain primarily by slowing its dissociation rate, as the k-1 values of the N and C domains are markedly decreased (about 30- and 1100-fold, respectively) by 300 mM NaCl. At high chloride concentrations, the chloride effect is much greater for the C domain than for the N domain resulting in a higher affinity of this inhibitor for the C domain. In addition, the inhibitory potency of captopril (C), enalaprilat (E), and lisinopril (L) for each domain was assayed by hydrolysis of Hip-His-Leu. Their Ki values for the two domains are all within the nanomolar range, indicating that they are all highly potent inhibitors for both domains. However, their relative potencies are different for the C domain (L greater than E greater than C) and the N domain (C greater than E greater than L). The different inhibitor binding properties of the two domains observed in the present study provide strong evidence for the presence of structural differences between the two active sites of ACE."
https://openalex.org/W1675449053,"Signal transduction by dioxin (2,3,7,8-tetrachloro-dibenzo-p-dioxin) is mediated by the intracellular dioxin receptor which, in its dioxin-activated state, regulates transcription of target genes encoding drug metabolizing enzymes such as cytochrome P-450IA1 and glutathione S-transferase Ya. Upon binding of dioxin the receptor translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in vivo and is converted from a latent non-DNA binding form to a species which binds to dioxin-responsive positive control elements in vitro. The latent receptor form is associated with an inhibitory protein (the 90-kDa heat shock protein, hsp90), the release of which is necessary to unmask the DNA binding activity of the receptor. Here we have established a protocol to disrupt the hsp90-receptor complex in the absence of ligand. We show that it was possible to covalently cross-link with dioxin only the hsp90-associated form of dioxin receptor. In contrast, the disrupted hsp90-free form of receptor did not form a stable complex with dioxin but bound DNA constitutively. Moreover, we could partially reconstitute the ligand binding activity of the salt-disrupted hsp90-free dioxin receptor by incubation with hsp90-containing reticulocyte lysate but not by incubation with wheat germ lysate which lacks immuno-detectable levels of hsp90. Thus, we demonstrate that the dioxin receptor loses its high affinity ligand binding activity following release of hsp90 and that it is possible to reverse this process. In conclusion, hsp90 appears to play dual roles in the modulation of functional activities of the dioxin receptor: (i) it represses the intrinsic DNA binding activity of the receptor and (ii) it appears to determine the ability of the receptor to assume and/or maintain a ligand binding conformation."
https://openalex.org/W2094689830,"Agrin is a component of the synaptic basal lamina that induces the clustering of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) on muscle fibers. A region near the carboxyl terminus of the protein exists in four forms that are generated by alternative RNA splicing. All four alternatively spliced forms of agrin are active in inducing AChR clusters on rat primary and C2-derived muscle fibers. In contrast, only two forms of the protein, each containing an 8 amino acid insert, are capable of inducing clusters on myotubes of S27 cells, a C2 variant that has defective proteoglycans. These two forms are also most active in inducing clusters on chick myotubes. This pattern of differential activity suggests that RNA splicing of agrin transcripts and interactions with proteoglycans or other components of basal lamina have important roles in regulating the localization of neurotransmitter receptors at synaptic sites."
https://openalex.org/W1513266031,"We examined the intracellular signal transduction of two endothelin receptor subtypes (ETA and ETB) by transfection and stable expression of individual receptor cDNAs in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Both receptors showed a rapid and marked stimulation of phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis and arachidonic acid release in response to agonist interaction. The two receptors, however, exhibited different responses in the cyclic AMP transduction cascades. ETA mediated the accumulation of cyclic AMP formation, whereas ETB displayed an inhibitory action on the forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation. In both receptors, the responses of phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis, arachidonic acid release, and cyclic AMP formation were induced in complete agreement with the endothelin-binding selectivity of each receptor subtype. Endothelin, added together with GTP, activated the adenylate cyclase activity in membrane preparations of ETA-expressing cells, indicating the direct linkage of ETA to the adenylate cyclase system. Pertussis toxin treatment of ETA-expressing cells resulted in partial inhibition of the endothelin-induced cyclic AMP accumulation, whereas the same treatment of ETB-expressing cells completely abolished the endothelin-induced inhibition of cyclic AMP formation. Thus, the two endothelin receptor subtypes are coupled to multiple but distinct signal transduction cascades through different G proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1516172894,"A series of Northern blot hybridization experiments using probes derived from the rat gastric H+,K(+)-ATPase cDNA and the human ATP1AL1 gene revealed the presence of a 4.3-kilobase mRNA in colon that seemed likely to encode the distal colon H+,K(+)-ATPase, the enzyme responsible for K+ absorption in mammalian colon. A rat colon library was then screened using a probe from the ATP1AL1 gene, and cDNAs containing the entire coding sequence of a new P-type ATPase were isolated and characterized. The deduced polypeptide is 1036 amino acids in length and has an Mr of 114,842. The protein exhibits 63% amino acid identity to the gastric H+,K(+)-ATPase alpha-subunit and 63% identity to the three Na+,K(+)-ATPase alpha-subunit isoforms, consistent with the possibility that it is a K(+)-transporting ATPase. Northern blot analyses show that the 4.3-kilobase mRNA is expressed at high levels in distal colon; at much lower levels in proximal colon, kidney, and uterus; and at trace levels in heart and forestomach. The high mRNA levels in distal colon and the similarity of the colon pump to both gastric H+,K(+)- and Na+,K(+)-ATPases suggest that it is the distal colon H+,K(+)-ATPase. Furthermore, expression of its mRNA in kidney raises the possibility that the enzyme also corresponds to the H+,K(+)-ATPase that seems to play a role in K+ absorption and H+ secretion in the distal nephron."
https://openalex.org/W1546293850,"Regulation of the level of ionized calcium, [Ca2+]i, is critical for its use as an important intracellular signal. In cardiac and skeletal muscle the control of fluctuations of [Ca2+]i depend on sarcolemmal and sarcoplasmic reticulum ion channels and transporters. We have investigated the sesquiterpine lactone, thapsigargin (TG), because of its reported action to alter cellular calcium regulation in diverse cell types, including striated muscle cells. We have combined biochemical and physiological methods at the cellular level to determine the site of action of this agent, its specificity, and its cellular effects. Using a patch-clamp method in whole cell configuration while measuring [Ca2+]i with Indo-1 salt, we find that TG (100 nM) largely blocks the contraction and the [Ca2+]i transient in rat ventricular myocytes. Analysis of these data indicate that no sarcolemmal current or transport system is directly altered by TG, although indirect [Ca2+]i-dependent processes are affected. In permeabilized myocytes, TG blocked oxalate-stimulated calcium uptake (half-maximal effect at 10 nM) into the SR. However, TG (100 microM) had no effect on Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+)-release in purified muscle (ryanodine-receptor enriched) vesicles while clearly blocking Ca(2+)-ATPase activity in purified (longitudinal SR) vesicles. We conclude that in striated muscle TG markedly alters calcium metabolism and thus alters contractile function only by its direct action on the Ca(2+)-ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1629605343,"The type I adenylylcyclase which was originally purified and cloned from bovine brain is stimulated by Ca2+ and calmodulin in vitro. Although it has been proposed that this enzyme may couple elevations in intracellular Ca2+ to increases in cAMP in whole cells, this has not been demonstrated in vivo. In this study, the type I adenylylcyclase was expressed in human 293 cells, and the influence of extracellular Ca2+ and Ca2+ ionophore on intracellular cAMP levels was examined. The cAMP levels of control cells were unaffected by Ca2+ and A23187. In contrast, intracellular cAMP in 293 cells expressing type I adenylylcyclase was markedly elevated by addition of A23187 and extracellular Ca2+. In the presence of forskolin, the muscarinic agonist carbachol also increased cAMP in 293 cells expressing the type I adenylylcyclase. These data indicate that the type I adenylylcyclase can be stimulated by Ca2+ in vivo, and that muscarinic agonists may indirectly stimulate the enzyme by increasing intracellular free Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W2029167404,"Bovine chromaffin cells have two components of whole-cell Ca2+ current: 'standard' Ca2+ currents that are activated by brief depolarizations, and 'facilitation' Ca2+ currents, which are normally quiescent but can be activated by large pre-depolarizations or by repetitive depolarizations to physiological potentials. The activation of protein kinase A can also stimulate Ca2+ current facilitation, indicating that phosphorylation can play a part in facilitation. Here we investigate the role of protein phosphorylation in the recruitment of facilitation Ca2+ currents by pre-pulses or repetitive depolarizations. We find that recruitment of facilitation by depolarization is a rapid first-order process which is suppressed by inhibitors of protein phosphorylation or by injection of phosphatase 2A into cells. Recruitment of facilitation Ca2+ current by voltage is normally reversible but phosphatase inhibitors render it irreversible. Our results indicate that recruitment of these Ca2+ currents by pre-pulses or repetitive depolarizations involves voltage-dependent phosphorylation of the facilitation Ca2+ channel or a closely associated regulatory protein. Voltage-dependent phosphorylation may therefore be a mechanism by which membrane potential can modulate ion channel activity."
https://openalex.org/W1568808038,"Stimulation of tracheal smooth muscle cells in culture with ionomycin resulted in a rapid increase in cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and an increase in both myosin light chain kinase and myosin light chain phosphorylation. These responses were markedly inhibited in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. Pretreatment of cells with 1-[N-O-bis(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-N- methyl-L-tyrosyl]-4-phenylpiperazine (KN-62), a specific inhibitor of the multifunctional calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II), did not affect the increase in [Ca2+]i but inhibited ionomycin-induced phosphorylation of myosin light chain kinase at the regulatory site near the calmodulin-binding domain. KN-62 inhibited CaM kinase II activity toward purified myosin light chain kinase. Phosphorylation of myosin light chain kinase decreased its sensitivity to activation by Ca2+ in cell lysates. Pretreatment of cells with KN-62 prevented this desensitization to Ca2+ and potentiated myosin light chain phosphorylation. We propose that the Ca(2+)-dependent phosphorylation of myosin light chain kinase by CaM kinase II decreases the Ca2+ sensitivity of myosin light chain phosphorylation in smooth muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1522249115,"Nucleoside diphosphate kinase of Drosophila, recently identified as the product of the awd gene, is essential for larval development. The conditional lethal mutation Killer of prune maps to the same gene. We purified the nucleoside diphosphate kinases from wild-type and mutant larvae by a simple procedure involving affinity chromatography on blue Sepharose. Both proteins are purified as hexamers in their native state. The mutant protein, which carries a serine instead of proline at position 97, has structural properties and catalytic efficiency that are very similar to the wild-type protein. However, the mutant protein has a much lower stability to denaturation by heat and urea. Following dilution of urea with buffer the urea-denaturated mutant nucleoside diphosphate kinase accumulates as folded monomers and cannot recover its quaternary structure and enzymatic activity. In contrast, the wild-type enzyme recovers hexameric structure and activity. This suggests that the mutation affects the folding/assembly pathway without affecting the function of the mature protein once folded and assembled into the mature hexameric structure."
https://openalex.org/W2109201263,"The quinolone CP-115,953 (6,8-difluoro-7-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1-cyclopropyl-4- quinolone-3-carboxylic acid) represents a novel mechanistic class of drugs with potent activity against eukaryotic topoisomerase II in vitro (Robinson, M. J., Martin, B. A., Gootz, T. D., McGuirk, P. R., Moynihan, M., Sutcliffe, J. A., and Osheroff, N. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 14585-14592). Although the quinolone is highly toxic to mammalian cells in culture, its mechanism of cytotoxic action is not known. Therefore, yeast was used as a model system to determine whether topoisomerase II is the primary target responsible for the in vivo effects of CP-115,953. The quinolone was equipotent to etoposide at enhancing DNA breakage mediated by the Saccharomyces cerevisiae type II enzyme. Moreover, at concentrations as low as 5 microM, CP-115,953 was cytotoxic to yeast cells that carried wild type topoisomerase II (TOP2+). By utilizing a yeast strain that expressed the top2-1 temperature-sensitive mutant, the effect of topoisomerase II activity on quinolone cytotoxicity was determined. At the permissive temperature of 25 degrees C, cells were highly sensitive to CP-115,953. However, at the semipermissive temperature of 30 degrees C (where in vivo enzyme activity is present but is greatly diminished), cells displayed only marginal sensitivity to the quinolone at concentrations as high as 50 microM. These results strongly suggest that topoisomerase II is the primary physiological target responsible for quinolone cytotoxicity and that CP-115,953 kills cells by converting the type II enzyme into a cellular poison."
https://openalex.org/W1568597946,"The role of specific tyrosine autophosphorylation sites in the human insulin receptor kinase domain (Tyr1158, Tyr1162, and Tyr1163) was analyzed using in vitro mutagenesis to replace tyrosine residues individually or in combination. Each of the three single-Phe, the three possible double-Phe a triple-Phe and a triple-Ser mutant receptors, stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, were compared with the wild-type receptor in their ability to mediate stimulation of receptor kinase activity, glycogen synthesis, and DNA synthesis by insulin or the human-specific anti-receptor monoclonal antibody 83-14. At a concentration of 0.1 nM insulin which produced approximately half-maximal responses with wild-type receptor, DNA synthesis and glycogen synthesis mediated by the three single-Phe mutants ranged from 52 to 88% and from 32 to 79% of the wild-type receptor, respectively. The corresponding figures for the double-Phe mutants averaged 15 and 6%, whereas the triple-mutants were unresponsive in both assays. The level of biological function approximately paralleled the insulin-stimulated tyrosine kinase activity in the intact cell as estimated by tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and its endogenous substrate pp 185/IRS-1. Interestingly, all mutants showed a marked decrease in insulin-stimulated receptor internalization. Anti-receptor antibody stimulated receptor kinase activity and mimicked insulin action in these cells. In general, the impairment of the metabolic response was greater and impairment of the growth response was less when antibody was the stimulus. These experiments show that the level and specific sites of autophosphorylation are critical determinants of receptor function. The data are consistent with a requirement for the receptor tyrosine kinase either as an obligatory step or a modulator, in both metabolic and growth responses, and demonstrate the important role of the level of insulin receptor kinase domain autophosphorylation in regulating insulin sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W1605909812,"We have studied the effects of cytochrome P450 inhibitors on the entry of Ca2∗ and Mn2∗, used here as a Ca2∗ surrogate for Ca2+ channels, in fura-2-loaded GH3 pituitary cells and bovine chromaffin cells depolarized with high-K∗ solutions. Imidazole antimycotics were potent inhibitors (econazole > miconazole > clotrimazole > ketoconazole). α-Naphtoflavone and isosafrole, but not metyrapone, also inhibited the entry of Ca2∗ and Mn2∗ induced by depolarization. This inhibitory profile most resembles that reported for IA-type cytochrome P450. However, carbon monoxide (CO), a well-known cytochrome P450 antagonist, had no effect on Ca2+ (Mn2+) entry. Given the high selectivity of the imidazole antimycotics for the heme moiety, our results suggest that a hemoprotein closely related to cytochrome P450 (but insensitive to CO) might be involved in the regulation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. The inhibitory pattern was also similar to that previously reported for agonist-induced Ca2+ (Mn2+) influx in neutrophils and platelets, although CO was an efficient inhibitor in this case. These results pose the question of whether similarities in the sensitivity to cytochrome P450 inhibitors exhibited by receptor-operated and voltage-gated channels reflect unknown similarities either in structural features or regulation mechanisms.— Villalobos, C.; Fonteriz, R.

https://openalex.org/W1582272319,"We have found that deletion of a 70-amino acid domain, spanning from position 141 to 210 in the N-terminal part of human topoisomerase I, has no effect on the catalytic activity of the enzyme in vitro but suppresses the lethal consequence of overexpressing human topoisomerase I in a rad52 top1 Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain. By immunostaining, the 70-amino acid domain is shown to be necessary for nuclear location of topoisomerase I. We demonstrate that the nuclear localization signal from the SV40 large T antigen can substitute for the 70-amino acid domain, restoring both the lethal effect of overexpression and the correct subcellular localization of topoisomerase I. Thus, we have identified a domain in the N-terminal part of human topoisomerase I, nonessential for catalytic activity in vitro but serving an in vivo function by directing the enzyme to the nucleus. Based on sequence comparisons, we suggest that this domain is a conserved element in the apparently non-homologous N-terminal parts of yeast and human topoisomerase I."
https://openalex.org/W1535467323,"Tissue degradation and invasion are hallmarks of the metastatic phenotype. While several extracellular matrix components can be digested by proteases, degradation of interstitial collagen is selectively initiated by collagenase. It is obvious that inhibitors of collagenase activity would be extremely useful in preventing tissue destruction and tumor cell invasion and thus prove invaluable therapeutic agents. We describe here the possible development of such inhibitors through the use of the principle of complementary hydropathy. A peptide was deduced from the nucleotide sequence complementary to that coding for the region in interstitial collagen surrounding the bond between Gly775 and Ile776 which is cleaved by the enzyme. Labeled collagen binds specifically and quantitatively to this peptide. A polyclonal mouse serum raised against this peptide recognized purified human collagenase, was able to immunoprecipitate collagenase from cultured human keratinocyte supernatants and was effective in inhibiting collagenolytic activity with a K(iapp) = 0.3 microM."
https://openalex.org/W1498129357,"We have previously shown, using truncated soluble recombinant receptors, that substituting the 62 N-terminal amino acids of the alpha subunit from the insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGFIR) with the corresponding 68 amino acids from the insulin receptor (IR) results in a chimeric receptor with an approximately 200-fold increase in affinity for insulin and only a 5-fold decrease in insulin-like growth factor I (IGFI) affinity (Kjeldsen, T., Andersen, A. S., Wiberg, F. C., Rasmussen, J. S., Schaffer, L., Balschmidt, P., Moller, K. B., and Moller, N. P. H. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 88, 4404-4408). We demonstrate that these 68 N-terminal amino acids of the IR also confer insulin affinity on the intact IGFI holoreceptor both in the membrane-bound state and when solubilized by Triton X-100. Furthermore, this domain can be subdivided into two regions (amino acids 1-27 and 28-68 of the IR alpha subunit) that, when replacing the corresponding IGFIR sequences, increases the insulin affinity of truncated soluble receptor chimeras 8- and 20-fold, respectively, with only minor effects on the IGFI affinity. Within the latter of these two regions, we found that amino acids 38-68 of the IR, representing 13 amino acid differences from IGFIR, confer the same 20-fold increase in insulin affinity on the IGFIR. Finally, the amino acids from position 42 to 50 are not responsible for this increase in insulin affinity. We thus propose that at least two determinants within the 68 N-terminal amino acids of the insulin receptor are involved in defining the ligand specificity of the insulin receptor, and that one or a combination of the remaining seven amino acid differences between position 38 and 68 are involved in conferring insulin affinity on the insulin receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1527257674,"Epidermal growth factor (EGF) or platelet-derived growth factor binding to their receptor on fibroblasts induces tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC gamma 1 and stable association of PLC gamma 1 with the receptor protein tyrosine kinase. Similarly in lymphocytes, cross-linking of antigen receptors induces the formation of molecular complexes incorporating PLC gamma 1; however, associated kinase activity is thought to be mediated through cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinase(s). In this report, we generated a fusion protein containing the SH2 domains of human PLC gamma 1 and human IgG1 heavy chain constant region to identify lymphocyte phosphoprotein-binding PLC gamma 1 SH2 domains following cellular activation. As in EGF- or platelet-derived growth factor-stimulated fibroblasts, PLC gamma 1 is coprecipitated in activated lymphocytes, complexed with associated tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. One of these, a 35/36-kDa protein found prominently in T cells and at lower levels in B cells, bound to the fusion protein in immunoprecipitation experiments. The fusion protein showed lineage restricted association with a 74-kDa phosphoprotein in T cells and a 93-kDa phosphoprotein in B cells. It bound to activated EGF receptor in fibroblasts as expected, and protein tyrosine kinase activity was precipitated from EGF-stimulated cells. However, PLC gamma 1-associated protein tyrosine kinase activity was not detected in activated lymphocytes. These data suggest that lymphocyte PLC gamma 1 SH2-binding proteins are cell lineage specific and may be transiently associated with activated PLC gamma 1."
https://openalex.org/W1544738532,"The immediate-early gene Egr-1 is strongly and rapidly induced in human and mouse Balb/c fibroblasts by okadaic acid and calyculin A, both specific inhibitors of protein serine/threonine phosphatases 1 and 2A. In contrast to the transient induction of the Egr-1 gene by serum or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, these phosphatase inhibitors stimulated a sustained induction of the Egr-1 gene. The induction is shown to occur transcriptionally and is sustained post-transcriptionally. Okadaic acid-induced Egr-1 mRNA is significantly more stable than serum-induced Egr-1 mRNA. The half-life of serum-induced Egr-1 mRNA is estimated to be 12 min, compared with a half life of 2 h for okadaic acid-induced Egr-1 mRNA. Okadaic acid also induced the expression of the related immediate-early genes Egr-2 and Egr-3 albeit to a lesser extent than Egr-1. Treatment of cells with okadaic acid and calyculin A also induced the synthesis of Egr-1 protein. The Egr-1 protein is weakly or not phosphorylated in quiescent cells, but multiple species of the phosphorylated forms of the Egr-1 protein are detected in cells treated with either of the phosphatase inhibitors. Simultaneous treatment of cells with TPA and okadaic acid synergistically induced Egr-1 gene expression, and H7 strongly inhibits this induction. Taken together, the results indicate that the induction of Egr-1 gene transcription and the phosphorylation of the induced Egr-1 protein are under the control of protein kinase(s) and protein phosphatase(s). The phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of Egr-1 protein may play a role in controlling cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W1571175107,"Abstract We have utilized S-farnesyl-Leu-Ala-Arg-Tyr-Lys-Cys as a methyl-accepting substrate to characterize a membrane-bound C-terminal protein methyltransferase from rat liver. We have localized the activity to the microsomal fraction and show that the bulk of the enzyme fractionates by density gradient centrifugation with glucose-6-phosphatase, a marker of the endoplasmic reticulum, and not with 5'-nucleotidase, a marker of the plasma membrane, or galactosyl:N-acetylglucosamine transferase, a marker of the Golgi apparatus. This methyltransferase appears to form an integral part of the membrane structure. Its activity is markedly affected by a variety of detergents used to solubilize membrane proteins in their native form. All activity is lost when membranes are treated with seven different detergents at a concentration of 1% (w/v). The activity is inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide, although it can be protected against inactivation with its substrate S-adenosyl-L-methionine, or its product S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine. Finally, we find that 5'-methylthioadenosine, a substrate analogue reported to be an inhibitor of this activity in other studies, is not an effective inhibitor in vitro."

The N-7 methylation of a set of consecutive dG residues in a single-stranded probe of the creatine kinase enhancer interfered with the formation of this nucleic acid structure and prevented protein binding. Recombinant MyoD also bound to a guanine tetrad formed with a telomeric DNA probe, and it had a higher affinity for the four-stranded structure than for the double-stranded E-box-binding site.

https://openalex.org/W1576708287,"In the present study the involvement of protein kinase C in the action of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) on osteoblast-like cells and in the stimulation of in vitro bone resorption by 1,25(OH)2D3 was examined. Incubation for 24 h with 1,25(OH)2D3 potently stimulated osteocalcin synthesis by ROS 17/2.8 cells. This stimulation was inhibited (30-70% inhibition) by 25 microM of the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors 1-O-hexadecyl-2-O-methyl-rac-glycerol (AMG) and sphingosine without affecting basal osteocalcin synthesis. 1,25(OH)2D3-stimulated osteocalcin secretion by nontransformed isolated fetal rat osteoblasts was also inhibited (30-55%) by AMG. Also, AMG inhibited 10(-9) M 1,25(OH)2D3-induced up-regulation of vitamin D receptor in ROS 17/2.8 cells. Activation of PKC with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) did not cause an increase in osteocalcin secretion, while only a small increase in cellular content of osteocalcin in ROS 17/2.8 cells was observed. Addition of PMA together with 1,25(OH)2D3 did not change the response to 1,25(OH)2D3. The PKC inhibitors were not toxic for the cells. 1,25(OH)2D3 did not stimulate diacylglycerol production in ROS 17/2.8 cells up to 5 min after administration. However, 4- and 24-h incubation with 10 nM 1,25(OH)2D3 increased phorbol ester binding in ROS 17/2.8 cells. 1,25(OH)2D3 potently stimulated bone resorption after 3 and 6 days of culture in fetal mouse long bones and calvaria. Both the PKC inhibitors AMG (25 microM) and staurosporine (50 nM) strongly inhibited (60-86% inhibition) 1,25(OH)2D3-stimulated bone resorption without affecting basal 45Ca release. These effects were not due to a cytotoxic effect of both PKC inhibitors. Nor is it likely that the effects of AMG and staurosporine are due to inhibition of cell proliferation as hydroxyurea did not affect 1,25(OH)2D3-stimulated bone resorption. The inhibition of 1,25(OH)2D3-stimulated bone resorption by PKC inhibitors suggests that besides osteocalcin synthesis PKC is also involved in other responses of 1,25(OH)2D3 in bone. 1,25(OH)2D3 does not directly activate PKC via an increase in diacylglycerol production but more likely via an increase in PKC. Together, the present study demonstrates a functional involvement of PKC in the action of 1,25(OH)2D3 in bone and bone cells which may have consequences for the development of 1,25(OH)2D3 analogs, e.g. with less hypercalcemic and relatively more antiproliferative activity."
https://openalex.org/W1482803833,"In the fibronectin gene promoter the cAMP response element (CRE) and the CCAAT box are separated by only 20 base pairs (bp), i.e. two turns of double helix. Binding of nuclear proteins to these elements, assessed by DNase I footprinting, differs in the different cell types. While in a variety of cells tested (HeLa, granulosa, brain, and adenocarcinoma) only CRE binding activity is observed, liver extracts show both CRE and CCAAT binding activities. Competitions with CRE oligonucleotides were able to prevent the binding of both liver factors, while competitions with CCAAT oligonucleotides only abolished the binding to the CCAAT box. Consistently, the occupation of the CCAAT box was reduced when the distance between the CRE and CCAAT elements was increased in a series of spacing mutants in which DNA fragments of 20, 28, or 44 bp were inserted, and in a construct where the CRE sequence was deleted. Furthermore, the mutants are less efficient than the wild type as templates for in vitro transcription elicited by liver nuclear extracts. Transcriptional activity decreases with the 20- and 28-bp insertions but is partially recovered with the 44-bp insertion. Partial purification of liver CRE- and CCAAT-binding proteins by high performance liquid chromatography on a Mono Q column and recombination of column fractions showed that a novel 73-kDa CRE-binding protein facilitates the association of the CCAAT-binding protein to the CCAAT site of the fibronectin gene."
https://openalex.org/W1554025750,"In addition to physical properties (DeRemer, M. F., Saeli, R. J., and Edelman, A. M. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 13460-13465), enzymatic and regulatory characteristics indicate that calmodulin (CaM) kinase Ia and CaM kinase Ib are distinct entities. The Km values for ATP and site 1 peptide were similar between the two kinases, however, CaM kinase Ib is approximately 20-fold more sensitive to CaM than is CaM kinase Ia. The kinases also displayed differential sensitivities to divalent metal ions. For both kinases, site 1 peptide, synapsin I, and syntide-2 were highly preferred substrates relative to others tested. A 72-kDa protein from a heat-treated extract of rat pancreas was phosphorylated by CaM kinase Ib but not by CaM kinase Ia. CaM kinase Ia activity displayed a pronounced lag in its time course suggesting enzyme activation over time. Preincubation of CaM kinase Ia in the combined presence of Ca(2+)-CaM and MgATP led to a time-dependent increase in its site 1 peptide kinase activity of up to 15-fold. The extent of activation of CaM kinase Ia correlated with the extent of autophosphorylation. The enzyme retained full Ca(2+)-CaM dependence in the activated state which was rapidly reversible by treatment with protein phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit. Thus, the activation of CaM kinase Ia is a result of its Ca(2+)-CaM-dependent autophosphorylation. CaM kinase Ib was not activated by preincubation under autophosphorylating conditions yet lost approximately 90% of its activity toward either an exogenous substrate (site 1 peptide) or itself (autophosphorylation) after incubation with protein phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit. The deactivated state was not reversed by subsequent incubations under autophosphorylating conditions. Thus, CaM kinase Ib activity is dependent upon phosphorylation by a regulating kinase(s) which is resolved from CaM kinase Ib during purification of the latter."
https://openalex.org/W1528762648,"Abstract Two Ca(2+)-calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinases were purified from rat brain using as substrate a synthetic peptide based on site 1 (site 1 peptide) of the synaptic vesicle-associated protein, synapsin I. One of the purified enzymes was an approximately 89% pure protein of M(r) = 43,000 which bound CaM in a Ca(2+)-dependent fashion. The other purified enzyme was an apparently homogenous protein of M(r) = 39,000 accompanied by a small amount of a M(r) = 37,000 form which may represent a proteolytic product of the 39-kDa enzyme. The 39-kDa protein bound CaM in a Ca(2+)-dependent fashion. Gel filtration analysis indicated that both enzymes are monomers. The 43- and 39-kDa enzymes are named Ca(2+)-CaM-dependent protein kinases Ia and Ib (CaM kinases Ia, Ib), respectively. The specific activities of CaM kinases Ia and Ib were similar (5-8 mumol/min/mg protein). CaM kinase Ia (but not CaM kinase Ib) activity was enhanced by addition of a CaM-Sepharose column wash (non-binding) fraction suggesting the existence of an activator of CaM kinase Ia. Both kinases phosphorylated exogenous substrates (site 1 peptide and synapsin I) in a Ca(2+)-CaM-dependent fashion and both kinases underwent autophosphorylation. CaM kinase Ia autophosphorylation was Ca(2+)-CaM-dependent and occurred exclusively on threonine while CaM kinase Ib autophosphorylation showed Ca(2+)-CaM independence and occurred on both serine and threonine. Proteolytic digestion of autophosphorylated CaM kinases Ia and Ib yielded phosphopeptides of differing M(r). These characteristics, as well as enzymatic and regulatory properties (DeRemer, M. F., Saeli, R. J. Brautigen, D. L., and Edelman, A. M. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 13466-13471), indicate that CaM kinases Ia and Ib are distinct and possibly previously unrecognized enzymes."

MAP kinase activator induces phosphorylation of MAP kinase on tyrosine and threonine residues, thereby activating MAP kinase. Here, experiments with the irreversible kinase inhibitor, 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine (FSBA), show that MAP kinase activator is in fact a MAP kinase-kinase. Treatment of MAP kinase activator with FSBA results in complete inactivation. This inactivation is prevented by a 10-fold excess of ATP. Inactivation of MAP kinase by FSBA does not affect the extent of threonine/tyrosine phosphorylation induced by MAP kinase-kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2160592202,"Human papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) has a relatively benign prognosis despite a high frequency of lymphatic metastasis. This suggests that local anticancer factors, generated in lymph nodes, control PTC progression. The cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), may be one such factor. We have previously shown that a human PTC cell line (NP-PTC) has high affinity TNF-alpha receptors. We now report on the action of TNF-alpha in these cells. TNF-alpha decreased [3H]thymidine incorporation as well as cellular DNA content and cell number in a dose-dependent manner. The abundance of phosphodiesterase and manganous superoxide dismutase mRNA species was increased in a time- and dose-dependent manner in the NP-PTC cells after TNF-alpha treatment. TNF-alpha activated NF-kappa B, a nuclear factor thought to mediate multiple actions of TNF-alpha, in these cells with a maximum effect observed after 30 min of treatment. Thus, TNF-alpha has an antiproliferative action on NP-PTC cells, despite its ability to induce the accumulation of mRNA that encodes an enzyme (manganous superoxide dismutase), thought to be cytoprotective. The net antiproliferative effect must therefore be explained by a balance of protective and tumoricidal or static effects that ultimately result in control of tumor spread. These antiproliferative effects may be in part mediated by NF-kappa B and PDE."

Genetic disruption of this region by in-frame deletion or insertion sensitizes the beta subunit in assembled RNA polymerase molecules to attack by trypsin. We demonstrate that RNA polymerase with the beta polypeptide cleaved in the dispensable region retains normal in vitro activity. Moreover, the RNA polymerase activity is completely restored after denaturation and reconstitution of the enzyme carrying cleaved beta subunit indicating that its carboxyl- and amino-terminal parts fold and assemble into RNA polymerase as separate entities."
https://openalex.org/W1546724618,"Abstract Signal transduction by tyrosine kinase growth factor receptors involves ligand-induced phosphorylation of substrates for the kinase, resulting in mediation of common or receptor-specific biological signals. We have compared signal transduction pathways for the fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR-1), the platelet-derived growth factor beta-receptor (PDGFR-beta), and a chimeric FGFR-1 molecule, FGFRchim, in which the FGFR-1 kinase insert was replaced with that of the PDGFR-beta. The different receptors were characterized and found to be functional as ligand-stimulatable kinases, after expression of the respective human cDNAs in porcine aortic endothelial cells. Substrates for the receptors were analyzed by ligand stimulation of [32P]orthophosphate-labeled cells and immunoprecipitation with phosphotyrosine antiserum. A number of phosphoproteins were induced in all the different types of cells, but components specifically induced after stimulation of FGFR-1 and PDGFR-beta expressing cells could also be detected. Examination of receptor-associated substrates by in vitro kinase assays revealed phosphoproteins of 65 and 85 kDa, which were associated with PDGFR-beta and FGFRchim, but not with FGFR-1. The 85-kDa phosphoprotein could correspond to the regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3' kinase (PI3-K), since phosphatidylinositol 3' kinase activity was detected after ligand stimulation of FGFRchim- and PDGFR-beta- but not FGFR-1-expressing cells. In addition, ligand stimulation of FGFRchim- and PDGFR-beta-expressing cells, but not FGFR-1-expressing cells, led to induction of actin reorganization in the form of circular membrane ruffling. Thus, replacement of a discrete segment of the intracellular domain of the FGFR-1 with the corresponding stretch from the PDGFR-beta resulted in transfer of PDGFR-beta-specific signaling properties to the chimeric molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1499280348,"Abstract We report the purification and characterization of a novel DNA helicase from calf thymus tissue. This enzyme partially copurifies with DNA polymerase epsilon* through many of the chromatographic procedures used to isolate it. The enzyme contains an intrinsic DNA-dependent ATPase activity. It can displace short oligonucleotides annealed to long single stranded substrates, in an ATP-dependent reaction. Use of this assay indicates that the DNA helicase translocates in a 3' to 5' direction with respect to the substrate strand to which it is bound. Maximal efficiency of displacement is accomplished by hydrolysis of (d)ATP as cofactor, however, (d)CTP can also be utilized resulting in a 5-fold decrease in the level of displacement. Displacement activity is enhanced by the presence of saturating amounts of Escherichia coli single stranded DNA-binding protein, not affected by the presence of phage T4 gene 32 protein, and inhibited by human replication factor A. The DNA helicase has a molecular mass of approximately 104 kDa as measured by denaturing gel electrophoresis, and an S value of 5.4 obtained from glycerol gradient sedimentation. Direct [alpha-32P]ATP cross-linking labels a protein of molecular mass approximately 105 kDa, providing further evidence that this polypeptide contains the helicase active site. In view of the differences in the properties of this helicase from four others recently identified in calf and designated A through D, we propose the name helicase E."
https://openalex.org/W2123975940,"The role of the type I and type II protein kinase A isozymes in the regulation of human T lymphocyte immune effector functions has not been ascertained. To approach this question, we first characterized the distribution and enzyme activities of the type I and type II protein kinase A (PKA) isozymes in normal, human T lymphocytes. T cells possess both type I and type II isozymes with an activity ratio of 5.0:1 +/- 0.71 (mean +/- SD). The type I isozyme associates predominately with the plasma membrane whereas the type II isozyme localizes primarily to the cytosol. Analyses of isozyme activities demonstrated that T cells from approximately one-third of 16 healthy donors exhibited significantly higher type II isozyme activities (higher type II, type IIH) than the remaining donors (lower type II, type IIL) (mean = 605 +/- 75 pmol.min-1.mg protein-1, P less than 0.001). Scatchard analyses of [3H]cAMP binding in the cytosolic fraction demonstrated similar Kd values (type IIH, 1.1 x 10(-7) M; type IIL, 9.0 x 10(-8) M); however, the Bmax (maximal binding) of the type IIH was 400 fmol/mg protein compared to the Bmax of the type IIL of 126 fmol/mg protein. Scatchard analysis of [3H]cAMP binding to the type I isozyme associated with membrane fragments had a Kd of 5.6 x 10(-8) M and a Bmax of 283 fmol/mg protein. Eadie-Hofstee plots of type IIH and type IIL gave a Km and Vmax of 2.3 mg/ml and 1.5 nmol.mg-1.min-1, and 2.1 mg/ml and 1.6 nmol.mg-1.min-1, respectively. The 3.2-fold higher maximal binding of the type II isozyme in one-third of healthy donors may reflect a greater amount of isozyme protein. The compartmentalization of type I PKA isozyme to the plasma membrane and type II PKA isozyme to the cytosol may serve to localize the isozymes to their respective substrates in T lymphocytes."

Irradiation of dark-inactivated enzyme with long-wavelength UV light produced cross-linked dimers and, to a lesser extent, trimers made up of alpha and beta subunits. Two major radioactive peptides were resolved by high-performance liquid chromatography from tryptic digests of MF1 which had been inactivated with 8-N3-FSB[3H]A at pH 8.0 in the dark. Sequence analysis revealed that one contained Tyr-beta 368 and the other contained His-beta 427 which were labeled in the ratio of 18:15. Sequence analysis of radioactive tryptic peptides isolated from digests of irradiated MF1 derivatized with 8-N3-FSB[3H]A showed that photolysis induced cross-linking of His-427 to Tyr-345 within the same beta subunit in high yield. When MF1 derivatized with 8-N3-FSB[3H]A was irradiated in the presence of beta-mercaptoethanol, alpha-beta cross-links were eliminated, whereas those between His-beta 427 and Tyr-beta 345 were unaffected. Analysis of radioactive peptides in tryptic digests of MF1 derivatized with 8-N3-FSB[3H]A and then irradiated in the presence or absence of beta-mercaptoethanol showed that the nitrene generated from reagent attached to Tyr-beta 368 participates in formation of alpha-beta cross-links in the absence of beta-mercaptoethanol. Therefore, the nitrene generated from reagent tethered to His-beta 427 is shielded from solvent and reacts with the side chain of Tyr-beta 345. In contrast, the nitrene generated from reagent attached to Tyr-beta 368 is exposed to solvent, but in the absence of scavengers reacts with side chains present in the alpha subunit. Irradiation of MF1, partially inactivated with 8-N3-FSBA, led to loss of residual ATPase activity without affecting residual ITPase activity. The amount of photoinactivation was greater when partial dark inactivation was performed at pH 6.9, where modification of His-beta 427 predominates, than when performed at pH 8.0, where modification of Tyr-beta 368 predominates. This suggests that cross-linking of His-beta 427 to Tyr-beta 345, and not cross-linking of alpha and beta subunits, is responsible for the augmented inactivation induced by irradiation."

In this study, we have tested the competence of presynthesized alpha- and beta-subunits to assemble into functional enzyme complexes. Antisense oligonucleotides complementary to alpha-mRNA were used to inhibit alpha-subunit synthesis in Xenopus oocytes leaving a presynthesized trypsin-sensitive alpha-subunit pool. beta-Subunits expressed in these oocytes from injected cRNA assembled with the preexisting alpha-subunits, rendered them trypsin-resistant, and permitted the expression of more ouabain binding sites at the plasma membrane. Similarly, presynthesized beta 1- or beta 3-subunits produced in Xenopus oocytes by injection of beta-cRNA and later of specific antisense oligonucleotides were stabilized and transported out of the endoplasmic reticulum when alpha-cRNA was injected into oocytes. These data indicate that alpha- and beta-subunits can insert into endoplasmic reticulum membranes independent of each other in an assembly-competent form and retain their ability for oligomerization after synthesis."

To explore this possibility, we employed fluorescence photobleaching recovery to investigate changes in the lateral mobility of native membrane constituents in human red blood cells (RBCs) during the course of Sendai virus-mediated fusion. The mobile fraction of RBC membrane proteins labeled with 5-(4,6-dichloro-5-triazin-2-yl)aminofluorescein increased significantly in the course of fusion, relaxing back to the original values upon completion of the fusion process. A different effect was observed on the lateral mobility of a fluorescent lipid probe, N-(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)phosphatidylethanolamine, incorporated initially into the external monolayer. In this case, the lateral diffusion coefficient (rather than the mobile fraction) increased during fusion; this increase was permanent in the absence of Mg-ATP and transient in its presence. An active viral fusion protein was required to mediate the effects on both protein and lipid mobility. These effects, which take place on the same time scale as that of the fusion process, suggest that the organization of the RBC membrane is perturbed during fusion and that the observed changes may be related to the fusion mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1528450993,"Cross-linking of beta-125I-endorphin to NG108-15 cell membranes labeled bands with molecular masses of 55, 35, and 25 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. We applied several criteria to evaluate the relevance of these cross-linked bands to delta-opioid receptors, including selectivity, stereospecificity, affinity, G-protein coupling, down-regulation, and correlation with opioid receptor level in different well-characterized cell lines. Only the 25 kDa protein adequately fulfilled all these criteria. Thus, cross-linking to the 25-kDa band was selectively inhibited by ligands with delta-opioid affinity, but not by mu-opioid, kappa-opioid, or optically inactive opioid ligands or by non-opioid ligands. Based on inhibition of cross-linking, we calculated an affinity of [D-Ala2,D-Leu5]enkephalin binding to the 25-kDa and (Kd = 6 nM) that is similar to that reported for [D-Ala2,D-Leu5]enkephalin binding to NG108-15 membranes; this affinity decreased approximately 10-fold in the presence of Na+/guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate. Chronic agonist treatment of NG108-15 cells reduced cross-linking to the 25-kDa band, but not to others, in a manner parallel to down-regulation of opioid receptors. Finally, the amount of the 25-kDa band was roughly proportional to the level of opioid receptors present in N18TG2, NS20Y, ST7-3, and ST8-4 cells. The 25-kDa band was absent in PC12h, NIH3T3, and C6BU1 cells as well as in liver, all of which had no detectable opioid binding."
https://openalex.org/W1492043934,"Branched-chain and aromatic neutral amino acids enter mammalian cells predominantly through a Na(+)-independent transport agency called System L. The sulfhydryl specific reagent p-chloromercuribenzene sulfonate (pCMBS) has been shown to be a potent inactivator of System L transport activity in Chinese hamster ovary cells, however, inactivation by pCMBS can be prevented by the presence of System L-specific substrate amino acids during the inactivation reaction. In addition, the presence of amino acids that are not substrates for System L have no effect on pCMBS inactivation of System L. Inactivation of System L activity by pCMBS was sensitive to pH and reversible by incubation with dithiothreitol. These findings suggest that there is a sulfhydryl group in, or very near, the amino acid-binding site of the System L transporter of CHO cells. Substrate protection, however, could be explained by conformational changes in the transporter associated with substrate binding. The presence of a substrate protectable sulfhydryl group on the System L transporter would aid in the attempt to identify this transporter using the technique of differential labeling."
