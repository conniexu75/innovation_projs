Fragments of fibronectin have been implicated in physiological and pathological processes, especially tissue remodeling associated with inflammation. Because EDA-containing fibronectin fragments produce cellular responses similar to those provoked by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), we examined the ability of recombinant EDA to activate Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), the signaling receptor stimulated by LPS. We found that recombinant EDA, but not other recombinant fibronectin domains, activates human TLR4 expressed in a cell type (HEK 293 cells) that normally lacks this Toll-like receptor. EDA stimulation of TLR4 was dependent upon co-expression of MD-2, a TLR4 accessory protein. Unlike LPS, the activity of EDA was heat-sensitive and persisted in the presence of the LPS-binding antibiotic polymyxin B and a potent LPS antagonist, E5564, which completely suppressed LPS activation of TLR4. These observations provided a mechanism by which EDA-containing fibronectin fragments promote expression of genes involved in the inflammatory response.

Because of the similarities between the effects of the EDA domain and LPS, we hypothesized that these molecules may be recognized by the same receptor.Constituents of pathogens, including LPS, are detected by a family of recently discovered receptors related to the Drosophila Toll protein, which is involved in dorsoventral polarization and the induction of antimicrobial factors in response to infection (9Medzhitov R.

Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 64: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) are required for maximal responses to LPS. The endogenous ligands/activators of the mammalian TLRs have not yet been identified, but it has been proposed that a proteolytic processing reaction generates the peptide ligands/activators in a manner analogous to theDrosophila Toll-spätzle system. Recent observations suggest that heat shock protein 60 (hsp 60) activates TLR4 (22Ohashi K. Burkart V. Flohe S. Kolb H. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 558-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar), but it is not yet known if processing of hsp 60 is required to achieve TLR4 activation. In the present study, we determined that the EDA domain of fibronectin is capable of activating TLR4, which would account for the ability of EDA or EDA-containing fibronectin fragments to induce LPS-like responses.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWe first characterized the activities of recombinant fibronectin type III repeat domains on cells that express TLR4, human THP-1 monocyte/macrophage cells, using production of MMP-9 as an index of the cellular response. Gelatin zymography performed on conditioned medium demonstrated that recombinant EDA (1 μm) strongly induced pro-MMP-9 expression (Fig.1 A). Recombinant EDB at similar concentrations caused only a modest increase in pro-MMP-9 release, whereas recombinant III11 domain, a 7-kDa recombinant protein representing the C terminus of repeat III1 (III1C), poly-l-histidine, and human fibroblast cellular fibronectin had no major effect on pro-MMP-9 release (Fig. 1 A). MMP-2 was detected in the medium in some experiments, but recombinant EDA did not have a significant effect on its expression (Fig. 1 A). Note that the stronger MMP-2 activities and weak MMP-9 band appearing in the conditioned medium of cells cultured with cellular fibronectin represent contaminants in the cellular fibronectin preparation as they were present on zymographic analysis of medium containing cellular fibronectin that never was exposed to THP-1 cells (data not shown). At a concentration of 1 μm, EDA stimulated a progressive accumulation of pro-MMP-9 over a 72 h incubation period with a marked increase in pro-MMP-9 detectable within 24 h (Fig.2). A shorter time course revealed induction of pro-MMP-9 within 6 h of EDA treatment (data not shown). Concentrations of recombinant EDA as low as 300 nmstimulated pro-MMP-9 production, and the response of the THP-1 cells was dose-dependent to concentrations of EDA up to 10 μm (Fig. 2). Quantitation of MMP-9 released by THP-1 cells by ELISA confirmed the stimulatory effect of EDA and the failure of other recombinant fibronectin domains to markedly induce MMP-9 expression (Fig. 1 B). The recombinant fibronectin domains contained <1 ng of LPS/nmol of protein, and there was no detectable hsp 60 in the preparations. The LPS antagonist, E5531, substantially reduced production of MMP-9 by LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells but had no appreciable impact on secretion of MMP-9 by EDA-treated cells (Fig.3). None of the treatments promoted significant differentiation/attachment of the cells, which mostly remained in suspension; no more than 5β of cells in any of the treatments became adherent and spread.Figure 2Time course (A) and dose-response (B) of MMP-9 expression by THP-1 cells treated with EDA. A, THP-1 cells were incubated with poly-l-histidine (1 μm) or EDA (1 μm) for the indicated times. Zymography was performed on conditioned medium. B, a dose-response study was conducted with the indicated concentrations of poly-l-histidine and EDA. Cells were incubated for 48 h and zymography was performed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3The LPS antagonist, E5531, inhibits LPS-stimulated MMP-9 production but does not block the action of EDA. THP-1 cells (5 × 105 cells/well) were cultured for 24 h in the presence of LPS (200 ng/ml), 256 nm E5531, EDA (300 nm), or a combination of LPS + E5531 or EDA + E5531 as indicated.

Seiki M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 395-405PubMed Google Scholar), and NF-κB is activated in response to LPS stimulation of TLR4. We found that components of NF-κB were increased in the nuclei of THP-1 cells as early as 15 min after addition of EDA, reaching peak levels at 1 h that were maintained up to 3 h (Fig. 4).Figure 4Nuclear accumulation of NF-κB in THP-1 cells treated with EDA. THP-1 cells (10 × 106 cells/well) were incubated with 1 μm EDA for 0, 15, 30, 60, or 180 min.

LPS in the presence of sCD14, which binds LPS and presumably presents it to TLR4, produced the expected strong reporter response in cells transfected with TLR4 and MD-2 (14Chow J.C. Young D.W.

Recombinant EDA, but not III11 or EDB, produced a response of the reporter construct in TLR4/MD-2 transfectants that was ∼40–45β of the LPS response. Like LPS, cotransfection with TLR4 and MD-2 was required for a vigorous response of the reporter construct to EDA (Fig.6).Figure 5EDA stimulates NF-κB activation via TLR4. HEK 293 cells were plated at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well in 48-well plates and transfected with TLR4 cDNA (striped bars) or empty vector (filled bars) and MD-2 cDNA plus pELAM-1-luc. The following day, the medium was replaced with DMEM plus 0.5β FBS, and the cells were either left untreated (basal) or incubated with 1 μm of the indicated recombinant fibronectin domain or 100 ng/ml LPS plus 10 nm sCD14 for 18 h.

LPS (100 ng/ml) and EDA (1 μm) stimulated IL-10 production by C3H/HeN splenocytes, whereas recombinant EDB and III11 had minimal stimulatory effects (TableI). The relative activity of EDA (1 μm) compared with 100 ng/ml LPS in stimulating IL-10 release by C3H/HeN splenocytes was somewhat lower than the relative response that we observed in activation of TLR4 in the HEK 293 cells. This may be because of differences in ligand specificity between the human and murine TLR4s (e.g. taxol activates murine Tlr4 but not human TLR4) or to the presence of a higher concentration of serum (10β FBS) in the splenocyte assay compared with 0.5β FBS in the HEK 293 studies (and serum-free conditions with THP-1 cells). We have found that serum blunts the response to recombinant EDA but not to LPS. The mechanism underlying the serum effect on EDA action is not known but could reflect the presence of an EDA-binding protein or antagonist. Importantly, the actions of LPS and recombinant EDA on IL-10 production were significantly blunted in C3H/HeJ splenocytes, consistent with an action of LPS and EDA via Tlr4.Table IRelative stimulation of IL-10 secretion by mouse splenocytesMouse donorEDAEDBIII11LPSC3H/HeNExp.19.82.60.749.5Exp.22.3ND1.615.8Exp.34.91.20.716.2C3H/HeJExp.11.40.50.70.9Exp.21.2ND0.21.7Exp.32.10.60.51.8Spleen cells were stimulated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The relative stimulation of IL-10 is calculated by dividing the pg/ml of IL-10 released in an experimental well by the amount released in medium alone.

Open table in a new tab Using stable TLR4/MD-2 HEK 293 transfectants, we found as expected that LPS in the absence of sCD14 had a minimal effect on TLR4-mediated reporter gene activation (Fig. 7), but there was a dramatic increase in the response to LPS when sCD14 was added. In the absence of sCD14, polymyxin B and the LPS antagonist, E5564, had no major impact on EDA activation of TLR4. However, the same concentrations of polymyxin B and E5564 completely blocked the stimulatory effects of LPS in the presence of sCD14. sCD14 (10 ng/ml) also increased the response to recombinant EDA (Fig. 7). This sCD14 augmentation of EDA activation of TLR4 was inhibited by polymyxin B and E5564, raising the possibility that the increased activity of EDA in the presence of sCD14 could be due, in part, to LPS contamination. Heat treatment ablated the TLR4-stimulating activity of recombinant EDA but had no effect on LPS. Collectively, these experiments demonstrate that EDA activation of TLR4 cannot be accounted for by LPS contamination in the recombinant protein preparations.Figure 7Effects of heat treatment, polymyxin B, and the LPS antagonist, E5564, on EDA activation of TLR4. HEK-TLR4/MD2/ELAM-1-luc cells were seeded in 96-well plates and maintained as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells were incubated with EDA (1 μm) or LPS (10 ng/ml) in the absence or presence of 10 nm sCD14 with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 10 μg/ml polymyxin B (Polymix), or 1 μm E5564 as indicated for 18 h. Heat indicates that EDA and LPS were heated (95 °C for 60 min) before addition to the cells. Following the incubation period, cell lysates were immediately analyzed for luciferase activity.

Our observations suggest an alternative signaling pathway for fibronectin molecules containing the EDA domain.The known TLR4 activators require accessory proteins to turn on TLR4 signaling. Like LPS, EDA activation of TLR4 requires MD-2, suggesting shared features of the mechanism of TLR4 activation. LPS requires CD14 for efficient activation of TLR4. Although we found that sCD14 enhanced the EDA activation of TLR4, we cannot rule out the possibility that sCD14 exposed the activity of minor LPS contaminants. It is of interest that Asea et al. (28Asea A. Kraeft S.K. Kurt-Jones E.A. Stevenson M.A. Chen L.B. Finberg R.W. Koo G.C. Calderwood S.K. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar) recently found that hsp 70 acts as a cytokine employing a CD14-dependent pathway, suggesting that CD14, a known lipid-binding protein, can also augment the action of proteins. We have been unable to demonstrate binding of EDA to sCD14. 2Y. Okamura and J. F. Strauss, unpublished data. Therefore, if CD14 does increase the action of EDA, it must do so through a mechanism that does not involve high affinity interactions between these molecules. Importantly, polymyxin B and LPS antagonists did not have a major impact on EDA-stimulated THP-1 cell MMP-9 production and EDA activation of TLR4. The activity of EDA was destroyed by heat whereas LPS activity was unaffected. Thus, the effects of the EDA domain can be clearly distinguished from those of LPS.Saito et al. (4Saito S. Yamaji N.

Likewise, we found that intact cellular fibronectin did not have a major impact on MMP-9 expression in THP-1 cells. Saito et al. (4Saito S. Yamaji N. Yasunaga K. Saito T. Matsumoto S.-i. Katoh M.

This fibronectin fragment displayed activities similar to that of the recombinant EDA domains. Their observations lend credence to the notion that endogenously generated EDA-containing fibronectin fragments serve as signaling molecules and indicate that domains in the fibronectin protein distal to the EDA domain may suppress the ability of fibronectin to activate signaling. Further investigation is needed to elucidate 1) the mechanism by which EDA stimulates TLR4 activity and 2) the structure of endogenous EDA-containing fibronectin fragments.

Because of the similarities between the effects of the EDA domain and LPS, we hypothesized that these molecules may be recognized by the same receptor. Constituents of pathogens, including LPS, are detected by a family of recently discovered receptors related to the Drosophila Toll protein, which is involved in dorsoventral polarization and the induction of antimicrobial factors in response to infection (9Medzhitov R.

https://openalex.org/W2148950534,"We examined the biosynthesis and post-translational processing of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor precursor (pro-BDNF) in cells infected with a pro-BDNF-encoding vaccinia virus. Metabolic labeling, immunoprecipitation, and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis reveal that pro-BDNF is generated as a 32-kDa precursor that is N-glycosylated and glycosulfated on a site, within the pro-domain. Some pro-BDNF is released extracellularly and is biologically active as demonstrated by its ability to mediate TrkB phosphorylation. The precursor undergoes N-terminal cleavage within the trans-Golgi network and/or immature secretory vesicles to generate mature BDNF (14 kDa). Small amounts of a 28-kDa protein that is immunoprecipitated with BDNF antibodies is also evident. This protein is generated in the endoplasmic reticulum through N-terminal cleavage of pro-BDNF at the Arg-Gly-Leu-Thr57-↓-Ser-Leu site. Cleavage is abolished when Arg54 is changed to Ala (R54A) by in vitromutagenesis. Blocking generation of 28-kDa BDNF has no effect on the level of mature BDNF and blocking generation of mature BDNF with α1-PDX, an inhibitor of furin-like enzymes, does not lead to accumulation of the 28-kDa form.

They exist in solution as noncovalently bound dimers. Six cysteine residues conserved in the same relative positions give rise to three intra-chain disulfide bonds (2Maisonpierre P.C. Belluscio L.

The neurotrophins interact with two cell surface receptors, the low affinity P75 receptor (4Barker P.A. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and the Trk family of high affinity tyrosine kinase receptors (5Kaplan D.R. Hemstead B.L. Martin-Zanca D. Chao M.V. Parada L.F. Science. 1991; 252: 545-558Crossref Scopus (1132) Google Scholar). NGF preferentially binds TrkA, BDNF and NT4/5 bind TrkB, and NT-3 binds TrkC (and TrkA to a lesser extent). Sequence data predict that mature neurotrophins are generated through the proteolytic processing of higher molecular weight precursors (31–35 kDa), a process that has been extensively studied with respect to the production of NGF (6Edwards R.H.

Almost nothing is known, however, about the biosynthesis and post-translational processing of the other members of the neurotrophin family. Recent data from our laboratory show that cells with a regulated secretory pathway, including central nervous system neurons, release mature (i.e. fully processed) NGF (8Mowla S.J. Pareek S.

Pareek S. Farhadi H.F. Petrecca K. Fawcett J.P. Seidah N.G. Morris S.J. Sossin W.S. Murphy R.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 2069-2080Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, BDNF is contained in a microvesicular fraction of lysed brain synaptosomes consistent with its anterograde transport in large dense core vesicles (10Fawcett J.P. Aloyz R. McClean J.H.

Differences in the intracellular sorting of neurotrophins may arise, at least in part, from differences in the chemistry and processing of their precursors. Therefore, defining how neurotrophins are generated within a cell will be key to understanding how neurotrophins are released and function within the nervous system. In this study, we monitored the biosynthesis and post-translational processing of the precursor to BDNF (pro-BDNF) using a vaccinia virus (vv) expression system together with metabolic labeling, immunoprecipitation, and SDS-PAGE. Data show that pro-BDNF is produced as a 32-kDa precursor that undergoes N-glycosylation and glycosulfation on residues located within the pro-domain of the precursor. N-terminal cleavage of the precursor generates mature BDNF as well as a minor truncated form of the precursor (28 kDa) that arises by a different processing mechanism than mature BDNF. Site-directed mutagenesis data suggest that 28-kDa BDNF is not an obligatory intermediate in the formation of the mature form. Data also demonstrate that pro-BDNF could be biologically active, as determined by its ability to promote TrkB autophosphorylation. Hippocampal neurons were prepared according to the method of Brewer et al. (29Brewer G.J. Torricelli J.R. Evege E.K. Price P.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 35: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1883) Google Scholar). Briefly, the hippocampus was dissected from day 18 (E18) mice (Charles River Breeding Laboratories, Montreal, Canada), exposed to trypsin, dissociated mechanically, and grown in 60-mm collagen/poly-l-lysine-coated dishes. Cultures were maintained in serum-free Neurobasal medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 0.5 mm glutamine and 1× supplemented B27 (Life Technologies, Inc.). AtT-20, COS-7, and LoVo cells were cultured as reported previously (7Seidah N.G. Benjannet S. Pareek S. Savaria D. Hamlin J. Goulet B. Laliberte J. Lazure C. Chretien M. Murphy R.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). A human glioma (U373) cell line and a variant (U373/PDX) that stably expresses α1-PDX, an inhibitor of furin-like enzymes (11Anderson E.D. Thomas L. Hayflick J.S. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24887-24891Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was generously provided by Dr. Gary Thomas (Vollum Institute, Portland OR). Purified recombinant vv containing the full-length coding region of human pro-BDNF was prepared and used to infect cells as described previously (12Seidah N.G. Benjannet S. Pareek S. Chretien M. Murphy R.A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 379: 248-250Crossref Scopus (279) Google Scholar). U373 and U373/PDX glial cells and AtT-20 cells were grown in 60-mm dishes and exposed to virus for 30 min or 2 h, respectively. The cells were incubated in medium without virus overnight and either pulsed or pulse-chase labeled at 37 °C for specified time intervals. For pulse-chase experiments, infected cells were incubated in cysteine/methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum for 1 h, and then received 1.5 ml of the same medium containing 0.2 mCi/ml [35S]Cys/Met (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 30 min. For the chase, cells were bathed for specified intervals in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum plus excess (2 times) cysteine and methionine. In experiments assessing sulfation, AtT-20 cells were labeled for 3 h with [Na235SO4 ] (0.5 mCi) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in methionine/cysteine/SO4-free RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). Sodium chlorate (1 mm) was added to the medium in some experiments to inhibit sulfation, and in others, tunicamycin (5 μg/ml) was added to inhibit N-linked glycosylation. In both cases, the drugs were present in the medium during the 60-min preincubation period and throughout the pulse-chase period. Radiolabeled BDNF was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and conditioned medium as described previously (8Mowla S.J. Pareek S. Farhadi H.F. Petrecca K. Fawcett J.P. Seidah N.G. Morris S.J. Sossin W.S. Murphy R.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 2069-2080Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We used an affinity-purified antibody to BDNF (13, kindly supplied by Amgen) at a concentration of 0.5 μg/ml. Samples were analyzed by 13–22% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Gels were fixed for 1 h in 40% methanol and 10% acetic acid, treated with ENHANCE (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 1 h, washed in 10% glycerol for 1 h, and dried for 4 h at 60 °C. Micro-sequencing was carried out on samples from conditioned medium that were [3H]Leu-labeled and eluted from SDS-containing gels following electrophoresis. Micro-sequencing was performed using an Applied Biosystem gas-phase sequenator model 470A, as described previously (14Benjannet S. Reudelhuber T. Mercure C. Rondeau N. Chretien M. Seidah N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11417-11423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). vv:BDNF-infected AtT-20 cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]Cys-Met; conditioned medium was collected and treated with antibody to BDNF, and the precipitates were dissolved in 100 μl of reaction buffer with or without endo H (10 units; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or N-glycanase (1.5 units; Oxford GlycoSystems). Samples were incubated overnight at 37 °C. Endo H digestions were carried out in 100 mmsodium citrate buffer, pH 5.5, and N-glycanase digestions in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 50 mm EDTA. By using the LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), we transfected 60–70% confluent COS-7 cells with pcDNA3 recombinants of either the wild-type or R54A mutant form of pro-BDNF. After a 5-h incubation in serum- and antibiotic-free DMEM, the cells were incubated for another 48 h in DMEM plus 10% fetal calf serum. Two days after transfection, cells were metabolically labeled for 6 h, and cell lysates and conditioned media were collected, immunoprecipitated, and resolved by 13–22% gradient SDS-PAGE. For these studies, we obtained relatively pure preparations of the BDNF precursor by coinfecting LoVo cells, an epithelial cell line that is deficient in endogenous furin-like enzymes (15Takahashi S. Kasal K. Hatsuzawa K. Kitamura N. Misumi Y. Ikehara Y. Murakami K. Nakayama K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 1019-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), with vv:BDNF and vv:α1-PDX (11Anderson E.D. Thomas L. Hayflick J.S. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24887-24891Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were incubated in virus-free medium for 10 h, followed by a 4-h incubation in serum-free medium, which was subsequently collected for testing. To isolate fully processed BDNF generated under similar conditions, we coinfected LoVo cells with vv:BDNF and vv:furin, to ensure that the precursor was cleaved, and we collected conditioned medium 6 h later. Media collected from uninfected and wild-type vaccinia virus-infected (vv:wild type) LoVo cells were used as controls. To test for biological activity, we used NIH 3T3 cells that overexpress TrkB, prepared and generously provided by Dr. David Kaplan (Montreal Neurological Institute). The cells were bathed in conditioned medium for 5 min, following which cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with panTrk-203 antibody (16Hempstead B.L. Rabin S.J. Kaplan L. Reid S. Parada L.F. Kaplan D.R. Neuron. 1992; 9: 883-896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The pellets were dissolved in sample buffer, fractionated by SDS-PAGE using an 8% gel, and transferred onto a 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membrane for Western blotting. The replicas were probed overnight at 4 °C with a monoclonal phosphotyrosine antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) diluted 1:10,000 in Tris-buffered saline supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20, and for an additional 1 h with a goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5000). Immunoreactivity was observed using enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). To characterize the specificity of the BDNF antibody and to monitor its effectiveness in immunoprecipitations, we overexpressed BDNF in AtT-20 cells using a vv encoding the full-length precursor to hBDNF. Samples of cell lysate and conditioned medium were divided equally and immunoprecipitated with nonimmune serum, antibody to BDNF, or BDNF antibody with excess rhBDNF (5 ng/μl). As seen in Fig. 1, in both cell lysate and conditioned media, the antibody to BDNF specifically immunoprecipitated three proteins migrating at ∼32, 28, and 14 kDa. None of these proteins reacted with nonimmune serum, and none were immunoprecipitated in the presence of excess rhBDNF. We therefore conclude that the 32-kDa protein is unprocessed pro-BDNF, the 28-kDa protein a truncated form of pro-BDNF, and the 14-kDa protein fully processed mature BDNF. To understand the relationship of the different forms of the BDNF precursor to mature BDNF, we carried out pulse-chase studies using AtT-20 cells infected with recombinant vv:BDNF, a system we have used previously (8Mowla S.J. Pareek S. Farhadi H.F. Petrecca K. Fawcett J.P. Seidah N.G. Morris S.J. Sossin W.S. Murphy R.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 2069-2080Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Farhadi H.F. Mowla S.J. Petrecca K. Morris S.J. Seidah N.G. Murphy R.A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4059-4068Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2 Ashows that 32-kDa BDNF precursor is apparent in cell lysates as early as 10 min after the cells were radiolabeled and increased in intensity through 30 min of pulse incubation. In cells labeled for 20 min, a slightly higher molecular weight band is apparent that resolves into a doublet in cells chased for 4 h. This material likely represents differentially glycosylated and sulfated forms of the BDNF precursor (see below). Over the 8-h chase period, the 32-kDa and, to a lesser extent, the minor higher molecular weight bands decreased in intensity, whereas levels of the 14-kDa mature BDNF band increased, suggesting a precursor-product relationship. The 28-kDa band appeared as early as 10 min pulse, and its level increased by 1 h of chase. The intensity of the band decreased significantly thereafter. Fig. 2 Breveals that significant amounts of the 32-kDa BDNF precursor, the 28-kDa form, and mature BDNF are released into conditioned medium during the 8-h chase period. N-Glycanase treatment of the 32-kDa BDNF precursor and the truncated 28-kDa form of the precursor reduces their apparent size to around 27 and 24 kDa, respectively, indicating that these proteins containN-linked complex carbohydrates (Fig.3). N-Glycanase treatment has no effect on the apparent molecular size of mature BDNF (14 kDa). Treatment with endo H, which removes high mannose sugar moieties, only partially digests the 32- and 28-kDa BDNF (Fig. 3), suggesting that the precursor released into the conditioned medium contains a heterogeneous mixture of complex and high mannose sugars. Note that both pro-BDNF and 28-kDa BDNF appear as doublets with the lower band being endo H-sensitive, whereas the higher band is endo H-resistant. To define the importance of glycosylation in the generation of BDNF from its precursor, we infected AtT-20 cells with vv:BDNF and metabolically labeled the cells in the presence or absence of 5 μg/ml of tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-glycosylation. Cells were metabolically labeled for 30 min followed by a 2-h chase period, in the presence or absence of tunicamycin. Fig.4 shows that tunicamycin greatly reduced the signal intensity of the BDNF precursors as well as mature BDNF (compare the level of labeling in the left and right panels of Fig. 4). In addition, the apparent molecular site of the BDNF precursor in cell lysate and in conditioned medium was reduced from 32 to ∼27 kDa. The result suggests that glycosylation may play an important role in stabilizing the BDNF precursor during its processing and subcellular trafficking. Tunicamycin did not alter the molecular size of mature BDNF (14 kDa), as expected since this form of the protein is not N-glycosylated. Metabolic labeling of vv:BDNF-infected AtT-20 cells with [35SO4]Na2 (Fig.5 A) reveals that pro-BDNF as well as the truncated 28-kDa form of the precursor are sulfated. Mature BDNF, in contrast, is not sulfated. Furthermore, treatment of the sulfated species with N-glycanase (Fig. 5 B) completely removes the radioactive signal, demonstrating that sulfation occurs on carbohydrate groups. To determine whether sulfation is essential for the processing and/or secretion of pro-BDNF, we labeled AtT-20 cells expressing pro-BDNF with [35S]Cys-Met for 30 min and then chased the cells for 2 h in the presence or absence of sodium chlorate (1 mm) (17Baeuerle P.A. Huttner W.B. Biochem. Biophys Res. Commun. 1986; 141: 870-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). This treatment reduced by 97% the levels of35SO4 that were incorporated into protein immunoprecipitates measured in conditioned medium at the end of the chase period (data not shown). The result showed that exposure to sodium chlorate had no detectable effect on processing of pro-BDNF or on secretion of mature BDNF (data not shown). To determine where in the cell the 28-kDa form of BDNF is generated, we metabolically labeled vv:pro-BDNF infected cells with [35S]Cys-Met for 3 h in the presence or absence of brefeldin A (BFA, 5 μg/ml), a molecule that inhibits anterograde vesicular transport from the ER (18Fernandez C.J. Haugwitz M. Baton B. Moore H.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2171-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The cells were analyzed immediately or after a further 2-h chase period without BFA. Fig. 6 shows that BFA had no effect on the generation of the 28-kDa form of pro-BDNF, but it did inhibit the generation of the 14-kDa form of mature BDNF. This effect was reversed when the cells were chased 2 h in the absence of BFA. These results suggest that the 28-kDa form of BDNF can be generated in the ER, whereas the mature form of BDNF, as already shown (8Mowla S.J. Pareek S. Farhadi H.F. Petrecca K. Fawcett J.P. Seidah N.G. Morris S.J. Sossin W.S. Murphy R.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 2069-2080Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is generated in the trans-Golgi network or a post-Golgi compartment. The data presented above show that cell lysates and conditioned media of AtT-20 cells infected with vv:pro-BDNF generate a truncated form of BDNF with an apparent molecular mass of 28 kDa. We also detected this molecule in several other cell lines as well as in primary cultures of mouse hippocampal neurons infected with the same vv construct (Fig.7). In a separate study, we showed that a novel enzyme (SKI-1, subtilisin-kexin-isozyme-1) is able to increase the level of 28-kDa BDNF when coexpressed with pro-BDNF in COS-7 cells (19Seidah N.G. Mowla S.J. Hamelin J. Mamarbachi A.M. Benjannet S. Toure B.B. Basak A. Munzer J.S. Marcinkiewicz J. Zhong M. Barale J.C. Lazure C. Murphy R.A. Chretien M. Marcinkiewicz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1321-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). N-terminal micro-sequencing of [3H]Leu-labeled 28-kDa BDNF revealed a unique cleavage site atArg54-Gly-Leu-Thr57-↓-Ser-Leu (shown in Fig. 8 A). To determine whether endogenous 28-kDa BDNF is also cleaved at the same site, we mutagenized Arg 54 (which lies at the P4 position) to Ala. This residue potentially could serve as a recognition signal for this kind of subtilase (28Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Brain Res. 1999; 848: 45-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Processing of the R54A pro-BDNF mutant results in unchanged levels of mature 14-kDa BDNF with no significant generation of the 28-kDa protein (Fig. 8 B). This result demonstrates that the endogenous protein is indeed cleaved at the same site, and that, as seen for other PC substrates, Arg at the P4 is critical for efficient cleavage (Fig. 8 B).Figure 8Identification of the cleavage site within pro-BDNF that generates 28-kDa BDNF. A, N-terminal microsequence analysis of [3H]Leu-labeled 28-kDa BDNF. The N-terminal sequence of the 28-kDa product in COS-7 cells infected with vv:BDNF and vv:SKI-1 revealed a [3H]Leu at positions 2, 13, and 14. This result demonstrates that 28-kDa BDNF is generated by a unique cleavage at Thr57 (arrow) in the sequenceArg54gly-Leu-Thr57-↓-Ser-LeuAla-Asp-Thr-Phe-Glu-His-Val-Ile-Glu-Glu-Leu-Leu-Asp (top panel).

Two days after transfection, cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]Cys-Met for 6 h, and cell lysates (CL) and conditioned media (CM) were collected, immunoprecipitated with a BDNF-specific antiserum, and resolved by SDS-PAGE.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In this study, we introduced a vv encoding pro-BDNF into a cell line (U373 glial cells) that stably expresses the furin inhibitor α1-PDX (10Fawcett J.P.

Fig.9 shows that inhibiting furin-like enzymes abolishes the formation of mature BDNF but has no effect on the generation of the 28-kDa protein. Also, as shown in Fig. 8 B, transient expression of the Arg54 → Ala mutant in COS-7 cells abolishes the generation of 28-kDa BDNF without affecting the level of mature BDNF. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that the 28-kDa species does not constitute an obligatory intermediate in the normal processing of the BDNF precursor in the constitutive secretory pathway. Significant amounts of unprocessed pro-BDNF are secreted into conditioned media under our experimental conditions, a result that led us to question whether the precursor, if released in vivo, could be biologically active. To test this idea, we set out to generate unprocessed pro-BDNF by coinfecting LoVo cells, which are already deficient in furin activity (15Takahashi S. Kasal K. Hatsuzawa K. Kitamura N. Misumi Y. Ikehara Y. Murakami K. Nakayama K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 1019-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), with vv:BDNF along with vv:α1-PDX. By blocking the activity of all furin-like enzymes in the cell, we were able to obtain conditioned medium containing pro-BDNF and the 28-kDa BDNF without detectable amounts of mature BDNF (Fig.10 A). As a control for this study, we collected medium from LoVo cells coinfected with vv:BDNF and vv encoding furin (vv:furin) (7Seidah N.G. Benjannet S. Pareek S. Savaria D. Hamlin J. Goulet B. Laliberte J. Lazure C. Chretien M. Murphy R.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), conditions that favor the processing of pro-BDNF to mature BDNF (Fig. 10 B). Conditioned medium from these cells contained small amounts of unprocessed pro-BDNF. Fig. 10 C shows that medium collected from both cell types induces robust TrkB autophosphorylation in NIH 3T3 cells that overexpress the TrkB receptor. Medium conditioned by cells infected with wild-type vv had no effect. We conclude from these data that once released from a cell, the intact BDNF precursor containing small amounts of the 28-kDa form of BDNF has the potential to be biologically active. We do not know the precise contribution of the 28-kDa form of pro-BDNF to this activity since we were unable to obtain sufficient amounts of the protein for testing in the absence of pro-BDNF or mature BDNF. Because biosynthesis of neurotrophins normally occurs at low levels in neurons and non-neuronal cells, it is impossible to analyze endogenous neurotrophin processing with currently available techniques. Therefore, in this study, we used a vaccinia virus expression system to overexpress pro-BDNF and to study its processing in a variety of cell lines as well as in primary cultures of mouse hippocampal neurons. We have used similar methods previously to monitor the biosynthesis and post-translational processing of pro-NGF (7Seidah N.G. Benjannet S. Pareek S. Savaria D. Hamlin J. Goulet B. Laliberte J. Lazure C. Chretien M. Murphy R.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). By using the BDNF antibody provided by Amgen, as well as a commercially available antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (data not shown), we detected three BDNF-related products in vv:BDNF-infected AtT 20 cells and hippocampal neurons, namely 32-, 28-, and 14-kDa forms of the protein (Fig. 1). Results indicate that pro-BDNF is synthesized as a 32-kDa precursor that is processed within 1 h to give rise to mature BDNF (14 kDa). We also observed a significant amount of unprocessed pro-BDNF being released into conditioned medium by AtT-20 cells and hippocampal neurons (8Mowla S.J. Pareek S. Farhadi H.F. Petrecca K. Fawcett J.P. Seidah N.G. Morris S.J. Sossin W.S. Murphy R.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 2069-2080Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), cells that can release proteins both by the regulated and constitutive secretory pathways. In parallel studies, we did not observe precursor release when similar methods were used to monitor processing and release of the precursors of NGF (8Mowla S.J. Pareek S. Farhadi H.F. Petrecca K. Fawcett J.P. Seidah N.G. Morris S.J. Sossin W.S. Murphy R.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 2069-2080Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or NT-3 (9Farhadi H.F. Mowla S.J. Petrecca K. Morris S.J. Seidah N.G. Murphy R.A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4059-4068Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, previous work by others (18Fernandez C.J. Haugwitz M. Baton B. Moore H.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2171-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 27Brechler V. Chu W.N. Baxter J.D. Thibault G. Reudelhuber T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20636-20640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) has shown that large amounts of the precursors of proteins released by the regulated secretory pathway, such as pro-opiomelanocorticotrophin and pro-renin, are also constitutively released from AtT-20 cells. Although these differences could simply reflect overexpression of pro-BDNF saturating the sorting machinery in the trans-Golgi network (8Mowla S.J. Pareek S. Farhadi H.F. Petrecca K. Fawcett J.P. Seidah N.G. Morris S.J. Sossin W.S. Murphy R.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 2069-2080Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), constitutive release of the precursor could also be of biological significance. In that regard, BDNF mRNA is present in the dendrites of hippocampal neurons in culture (20Crino P.B. Eberwine J. Neuron. 1996; 17: 1173-1187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 21Tongiori E. Righi M. Catteneo A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 9492-9505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and as yet, we know nothing about the chemistry or fate of the BDNF protein synthesized within dendrites. It is possible that pro-BDNF could be produced in dendrites and released, in part, in an unprocessed form, for as yet unknown purposes. In this study, we have shown that medium containing pro-BDNF interacts with the TrkB receptor and activates its autophosphorylation (Fig. 10). To eliminate the possibility of pro-BDNF being further processed by cell surface-associated furin, the TrkB-expressing 3T3 cells were concomitantly exposed to a medium containing a large excess of α1-PDX. This ensures the blockade of furin activity at the cell surface and has recently been shown to be effective for the cytomegalovirus (17Baeuerle P.A. Huttner W.B. Biochem. Biophys Res. Commun. 1986; 141: 870-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Previous work (22Kolbeck R. Jungbluth S. Barde Y.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) has shown that a BDNF mutant containing an extension of 19 amino acids upstream of the cleavage site of mature BDNF (25-kDa BDNF) is biologically active. Also, Edwards and colleagues (23Edwards R.H. Selby M.J. Garcia P.D. Rutter W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6810-6815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that pro-NGF is biologically active but at a level 10–20-fold below that of mature NGF. Taken together, these findings suggest that complete processing of pro-neurotophins may not be an absolute requirement for biological activity. During transit through the secretory pathway, the BDNF precursor is glycosylated (Fig. 3), presumably at the single putative consensus sequence for N-linked glycosylation (NX(T/S)) six residues upstream of the cleavage site that generates mature BDNF. This glycosylation site is conserved in the same position in all neurotrophins, suggesting a critical role for N-linked glycosylation in neurotrophin maturation and/or trafficking. Pro-BDNF is released into conditioned medium as a mixture of endo H-sensitive (untrimmed) and endo H-resistant (trimmed) sugars. Both the 32- and 28-kDa forms of BDNF appear as doublets, the upper band being endo H-resistant and the lower band is endo H-sensitive (Fig. 3). The importance of carbohydrates in the folding of proteins has been well documented (24Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 5543-5551Crossref Scopus (3748) Google Scholar). In the case of NGF, blockingN-glycosylation with tunicamycin prevents the entry of pro-NGF into the Golgi apparatus and its subsequent secretion (7Seidah N.G. Benjannet S. Pareek S. Savaria D. Hamlin J. Goulet B. Laliberte J. Lazure C. Chretien M. Murphy R.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In this study, blocking N-glycosylation of pro-BDNF significantly reduced the level of radiolabeling of both pro-BDNF and mature BDNF, which may be due to incorrect folding diminishing the half-life of newly synthesized protein. Our results also demonstrate that oligosaccharide chains attached to the pro-domain of the BDNF precursor are sulfated (Fig. 5), as has been previously reported for pro-NGF (7Seidah N.G. Benjannet S. Pareek S. Savaria D. Hamlin J. Goulet B. Laliberte J. Lazure C. Chretien M. Murphy R.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Blocking sulfation with sodium chlorate (17Baeuerle P.A. Huttner W.B. Biochem. Biophys Res. Commun. 1986; 141: 870-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) did not affect processing and release of pro-BDNF. This result is consistent with the recent finding of Van Kuppereld and colleagues (25Van Kupperfeld F.J. Van Horssen A.M. Martens G.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1997; 136: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) that protein sulfation is not required for the transport, sorting, or proteolytic processing of proteins directed to the regulated secretory pathway. We have also identified a 28-kDa protein that is a cleavage product of the BDNF precursor in addition to 14-kDa mature BDNF but that is generated through a distinct processing pathway. Furthermore, its processing in U373 glial cells (Fig. 9) is not affected by α1-PDX, an inhibitor of the furin-like enzymes that likely generate mature BDNF from pro-BDNF in cells that contain a constitutive but not regulated secretory pathway. These results strongly suggest that the 28-kDa molecule is not processed by the known prohormone convertases but rather by some other processing system within the cell. Recent studies from our laboratories (19Seidah N.G. Mowla S.J. Hamelin J. Mamarbachi A.M. Benjannet S. Toure B.B. Basak A. Munzer J.S. Marcinkiewicz J. Zhong M. Barale J.C. Lazure C. Murphy R.A. Chretien M. Marcinkiewicz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1321-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 26Mowla S.J. Zhong M. Mamarbachi A.M. Seidah N.G. Murphy R.A. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1999; 709: 6Google Scholar) revealed that the 32-kDa BDNF precursor is a substrate for a newly identified subtilisin/kexin-like enzyme, called SKI-1. Coexpression of pro-BDNF and SKI-1 produced sufficient 28-kDa BDNF for N-terminal microsequencing, which revealed that cleavage occurs at theArg54-Gly-Leu-Thr57-↓-Ser-Leu site (Fig. 8 A). To determine whether the 28-kDa BDNF we detected is generated at the same cleavage site, we mutagenized Arg54, which lies at the P4 position relative to the cleavage site and is potentially important for recognition by this kind of enzyme (28Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Brain Res. 1999; 848: 45-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Processing of the R54A pro-BDNF mutant did not yield significant amounts of 28-kDa BDNF, suggesting that the 28-kDa precursor is cleaved at the same site (Fig. 8 B). Thus, although the 28-kDa form of pro-BDNF is clearly evident in our samples including hippocampal neurons, we do not know whether the protein is biologically important. Two lines of evidence suggest that the generation of mature BDNF in the constitutive pathway does not require initial processing of pro-BDNF to the 28-kDa form. First, in the U373-PDX cell line (a constitutive secreting cell line expressing α1-PDX), generation of 14-kDa BDNF is abolished, but there is no accumulation of 28-kDa BDNF, as would be expected if the latter were an intermediate product (Fig.9). Second, Ala substitution of the P4 Arg (Arg54 → Ala) abolished the generation of the 28-kDa form without affecting the production of mature BDNF (Fig. 8 B). Much is yet to be learned about the BDNF precursor. For example, we do not know whether the intact precursor (32 kDa) and the 28-kDa form of the precursor, both of which can be released constitutively from cells, could have biological roles of their own distinct from mature BDNF. Furthermore, in cells with both the regulated and constitutive secretory pathways, pro-BDNF is preferentially processed and released from the regulated pathway, whereas pro-NGF (8Mowla S.J. Pareek S. Farhadi H.F. Petrecca K. Fawcett J.P. Seidah N.G. Morris S.J. Sossin W.S. Murphy R.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 2069-2080Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and pro-NT3 (9Farhadi H.F. Mowla S.J. Petrecca K. Morris S.J. Seidah N.G. Murphy R.A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4059-4068Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are in the constitutive secretory pathway. Differential targeting may well arise because of structural differences in the pro-domains of the neurotrophin precursors or because of differential processing. Studies currently underway are targeted toward solving these issues. We thank Amgen for providing the antibody against brain-derived neurotrophic factor. We thank Suzanne Benjannet and Claude Lazure for carrying out pro-BDNF microsequencing."

CTGF independently promotes fibroblast proliferation and matrix deposition, and in acute models of fibrosis promotes cell proliferation and collagen deposition acting synergistically with TGFβ. In contrast to normal fibroblasts, fibroblasts cultured from fibrotic tissues express high basal levels of CTGF, even in the absence of added TGFβ. Induction of transcription by TGFβ requires the action of SMAD proteins. In this report we have investigated the role of SMADs in the TGFβ-induction of CTGF in normal fibroblasts and in the elevated levels of CTGF expression found in dermal fibroblasts cultured from lesional areas of patients with scleroderma, a progressive fibrotic disorder that can affect all organs of the body. We have identified a functional SMAD binding site in theCTGF promoter. TGFβ-induction of CTGFis dependent on SMAD3 and SMAD4 but not SMAD2 and is p300-independent. However, mutation of the SMAD binding site does not reduce the high level of CTGF promoter activity observed in dermal fibroblasts cultured from lesional areas of scleroderma patients. Conversely, the previously termed TGFβRE in the CTGFpromoter is required for basal CTGF promoter activity in normal fibroblasts and for the elevated level of CTGFpromoter activity in scleroderma fibroblasts. Thus, the maintenance of the fibrotic phenotype in scleroderma fibroblasts, as visualized by excess CTGF expression, appears to be independent of SMAD-dependent TGFβ signaling. Furthermore, given CTGF's activities, the high level of CTGF expression observed in scleroderma lesions may contribute to the excessive scarring observed in this disorder.

If activation of collagen gene expression persists, uncontrolled connective tissue deposition results, leading to pathologic scarring and fibrosis (1Gruschwitz M. Muller P.U. Sepp N. Hofer E.

Denton C.P. Oxford Textbook of Rheumatology. Oxford University Press, New York1998: 771-789Google Scholar). Given the ability of TGFβ1 to promote fibroblast proliferation and matrix synthesis, attention has been devoted to its potential role in initiating and maintaining the fibrotic phenotype (for reviews, see Refs. 5McCartney-Francis N.L Frazier-Jessen M. Wahl S.M. Int. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 553-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar and 6Blobe G.C. Schiemann W.P. Lodish H.F. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 342: 1350-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (2187) Google Scholar), including scleroderma (7Smith E. Leroy E.C. J. Inv. Dermatol. 1990; 95s: 125s-127sAbstract Full Text PDF Scopus (73) Google Scholar). For example, there is a clear correlation between TGFβ action and the initiation of fibrosis; in acute drug- or surgery-induced animal models, anti-TGFβ strategies are effective at blockading the onset of fibrosis (for review, see Ref. 6Blobe G.C. Schiemann W.P. Lodish H.F. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 342: 1350-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (2187) Google Scholar). However, the fibrosis is clinically a chronic disorder; the involvement of TGFβ in the maintenance of fibrosis and the effectiveness of anti-TGFβ strategies in the reversion of fibrosis is unclear. In terms of scleroderma, the data supporting the role of TGFβ in the fibrotic phenotype is circumstantial, chiefly depending on the histological distribution of TGFβ mRNA and protein. Unfortunately, the data are often contradictory. For example, mononuclear cells taken from bronchial levage fluids of scleroderma patients have elevated TGFβ levels (8Deguchi Y. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1992; 51: 362-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, in the actual lesional areas of skin, TGFβ mRNA is only localized to the leading edge of the scleroderma lesion; i.e. to the region of enhanced inflammatory response that is presumably involved with the initiation of the fibrotic response (9Querfeld C. Eckes B. Huerkamp C. Kreig T. Sollberg S.J. J. Dermatol. Sci. 1999; 21: 13-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Furthermore, fibroblasts taken from scleroderma lesions show elevated levels of collagen relative to their normal counterparts, yet show little difference in their ability to produce TGFβ or in their ability to bind TGFβ, nor do they show enhanced sensitivity to TGFβ treatment (10Moreland L.W. Goldsmith K.T. Russell W.J. Young Jr., K.R. Garver Jr., R.I. Am. J. Med. 1992; 93: 628-636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 11Needleman B.W. Choi J. Burrows-Mezu A Fontana J.A. Arthritis Rheum. 1990; 33: 650-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Thus, although there seems to be circumstantial data to support the role of TGFβ in the onset of the scleroderma fibrotic phenotype, it is unclear as to its precise role in initiating or maintaining the scleroderma phenotype. In an initial attempt to molecularly characterize the scleroderma phenotype, we recently used differential display analysis to identify genes up-regulated in dermal fibroblasts cultured from patients with scleroderma (12Shi-wen X. Pennington D. Holmes A. Leask A. Bradham D. Beauchamp J.R. Fonseca C. du Bois R.M. Martin G.R. Black C.M Abraham D.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 259: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Perhaps the most interesting gene up-regulated in scleroderma fibroblasts was connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) (12Shi-wen X. Pennington D. Holmes A. Leask A. Bradham D. Beauchamp J.R. Fonseca C. du Bois R.M. Martin G.R. Black C.M Abraham D.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 259: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). CTGF is a heparin-binding 38-kDa cysteine-rich peptide that induces proliferation, collagen synthesis, and chemotaxis in mesenchymal cells (13Moussad E.E.A. Brigstock D.A. Mol. Genet.

Previously, CTGF mRNA and protein were shown to be constitutively expressed in numerous fibrotic disorders both in skin and in internal organs, such as atherosclerosis and pulmonary and renal fibrosis, and that this expression correlated with high collagen synthesis (12Shi-wen X.

Hence, in adult tissues, constitutive CTGF expression is considered a faithful, clinical, molecular marker of fibrosis. Furthermore, given its activity, CTGF is considered a mediator of the fibrotic phenotype (12–24). In contrast to the situation in fibrotic disorders, CTGF is not expressed in normal human dermal or mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts unless cells are treated with TGFβ (14Bradham D.M. Igarishi A.

Similarly, exogenous addition of TGFβ increases the amount of CTGF protein and promoter activity produced by fibroblasts cultured from scleroderma lesions (12Shi-wen X. Pennington D. Holmes A.

This induction by TGFβ is cell-type specific, as it occurs in connective tissue cells but not in epithelial cells or lymphocytes (14Bradham D.M. Igarishi A. Potter R.L. Grotendorst G. J.

Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). The regulation of CTGF expression by TGFβ appears to be controlled primarily at the level of transcription (20Abraham D.J. Shiwen X Black C.M. Sa S. Xu Y. Leask A. J. Biol.

Originally, the up-regulation of CTGF by TGFβ was thought to be solely dependent on a relatively small sequence present in the 5′ upstream region of the CTGF promoter (TGFβ response element; TGFβRE) (25Grotendorst G.R. Okochi H. Hayashi N. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 469-480PubMed Google Scholar). This sequence does not resemble the TGFβ response elements described in other genes, including the SMAD recognition sequence (25Grotendorst G.R. Okochi H. Hayashi N. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 469-480PubMed Google Scholar). However, recently we have shown that sequences immediately upstream of the previously identified TGFβRE are required for TGFβ to induce CTGF expression (20Abraham D.J. Shiwen X Black C.M. Sa S. Xu Y. Leask A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1522-1525Google Scholar). Similarly, the high level of CTGF protein observed in scleroderma appears to be due, at least in part, to gene transcription because the CTGFpromoter activity is substantially higher in scleroderma dermal fibroblasts relative to normal dermal fibroblasts (12Shi-wen X. Pennington D. Holmes A. Leask A. Bradham D. Beauchamp J.R. Fonseca C. du Bois R.M. Martin G.R. Black C.M Abraham D.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 259: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanism underlying the control of CTGF gene expression in normal and fibrotic fibroblasts remains unknown. Activation of TGFβ-dependent gene expression is commonly mediated through SMADs 2, 3, and 4 (for reviews, see Refs. 25Grotendorst G.R. Okochi H. Hayashi N. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 469-480PubMed Google Scholar and 26Kretzschmar M. Massague J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). SMADs 2 and 3 are normally present in the cytosol. Once activated by TGFβ, SMADs 2 and 3 interact transiently with type I TGF-β receptor kinase and become phosphorylated at their carboxyl terminus (27Liu X. Sun Y. Constantinescu S.N. Karam E.

Wrana J.L. Cell. 1996; 87: 1215-1224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). SMAD2 and SMAD3 then form a heteromeric complex with SMAD4 (29Lagna G. Hata A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J. Nature. 1996; 383: 832-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar, 30Nakao A. Imamura T. Souchelnytskyi S. Kawbata M. Ishasaki A. Oeda E. Tamaki K. Hanai J. Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5353-5362Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). These complexes then translocate to the nucleus and activate expression of target genes (25Grotendorst G.R. Okochi H. Hayashi N. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 469-480PubMed Google Scholar), in concert with other nuclear factors the identity of which can vary depending on the promoter and cell type (e.g. Refs. 31Hua X. Liu X.

Recent studies have recognized a consensus DNA motif, GTCTAGAC that provides the binding site for the SMAD3·SMAD4 complex (35Zawel L. Dai J.L Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 11-17Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Homologs of this element have been identified in the promoters of several TGFβ-responsive genes (e.g. Refs. 36Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Derynck R. Nature. 1998; 394: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar, 37Vindevoghel L. Kon A. Lechleider R.J. Uitto J. Roberts A.B. Mauviel A. J. Biol.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 505-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). More recently, studies in TGFβ-responsive systems have also identified other SMAD family members, such as SMADs 6 and 7, which represent a functionally distinct class of SMADs that antagonize SMAD-receptor interactions (40Roberts A.B. Microbes Infect. 1999; 1: 1265-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In this report, we assess the role of SMADs in CTGF gene expression in normal and scleroderma fibroblasts. Using a combination of Western blot, gel shift, and gene cotransfection/promoter assays, we show that a functional SMAD binding site in the CTGFpromoter is necessary for the induction of CTGF by TGFβ in fibroblasts. Conversely, the constitutive CTGF expression observed in scleroderma appears to be independent of SMAD action. Thus, the maintenance of the fibrotic phenotype in scleroderma, as visualized by constitutive CTGF expression, appears to be SMAD-independent. In addition, we show that the previously termed TGFβRE is required for basal CTGF expression in normal fibroblasts and elevated CTGF expression in scleroderma. NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (ATCC) were maintained in DMEM, 10% calf serum (Life Technologies). Fetal SMAD3-knockout mouse fibroblasts, and their wild-type counterparts, were a gift from Anita Roberts (National Institutes of Health). Primary dermal fibroblasts from lesional areas of scleroderma patients and normal individuals were taken from biopsies of patients with diffuse cutaneous scleroderma and age, sex, and anatomically site-matched healthy volunteers, respectively. All patients fulfilled the criteria of the American College of Rheumatology for the diagnosis of scleroderma. Informed consent and ethical approval were obtained for all procedures. Fibroblasts were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine (Life Technologies). All cells were used between passages 2 and 5, with reculture at a dilution of 1 in 3 passaged fibroblasts (41LeRoy E.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1974; 54: 880-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Transfections were performed in 6-well plates using LipofectAMINE plus, as described by the manufacturer (Life Technologies). For reporter assays, 1 μg of a reporter construct was cotransfected with 0.25 μg of CMVβ-galactosidase plasmid, which was used as an internal transfection control (CLONTECH). For assays in which the role of transacting proteins was to be tested, 0.5 μg of reporter, and 1 μg of empty vector or expression vector encoding the protein of interest were used. For transfections involving ski and snoN, amounts of DNA used were as described in the text. SEAP and β-galactosidase kits were used to perform reporter gene assays (Tropix). TGFβ2 was from R&D Systems or Celtrix and used at concentrations indicated in the text. The data are presented as mean ± S.E., or representative of experiments performed in at least triplicate in at least two separate experiments. Statistical analysis was performed by the Student's unpaired t test. p values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The full-length CTGFpromoter/SEAP reporter construct is described elsewhere (20Abraham D.J. Shiwen X Black C.M. Sa S. Xu Y. Leask A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1522-1525Google Scholar). Point mutations were introduced using a kit (Stratagene). The mutagenic primer (Sigma Genosys) for the SMAD mutant was 5′-GAGCTGGAGTGTGCCAGCTTTTGGATCCGGAGGAATGCTGAGTGTC-3′ and for the TGFβRE mutant was 5′-CAGACGGAGGAATGCTGGGGATCCCGAGGATCAATCC-3′. Constructs were fully sequenced in both directions to confirm mutagenesis before use. SMADs 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 expression vectors were generous gifts from Joan Massague (Sloan-Kettering), and ski and snoN expression vectors were generous gifts from Robert Weinberg (Whitehead Institute). Expression vectors encoding wild-type and dominant-negative p300 were from Upstate Biotechnology. The human plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1)/luciferase construct was a generous gift from Dan Rifkin (New York University). Human dermal fibroblasts were grown in DMEM and 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were grown to confluence and switched to DMEM supplemented with insulin/transferrin/selenium. Cells were grown for an additional 18 h, and then 10 ng/ml TGFβ2 (R&D Systems) was added. Media was removed 24 h later, and 25 μl was electrophoresed through a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Novex) and blotted to nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad). Filters were blocked overnight at 4 °C in 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20. CTGF protein was detected by a 1 h incubation of a 1:1000 dilution of rabbit anti-CTGF antibody in 1% milk, TBS, 0.1% Tween 20. For anti-SMADs 2, 3, and 7 Westerns, cells were lysed in 2% SDS, and protein concentration was determined (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of protein were electrophoresed as described above. For experiments involving SMADs, SMAD proteins were detected using a 1:1000 dilution of antibody. SMADs 3, 4, and 7 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. For experiments involving the detection of transfected FLAG-tagged SMADs 3 and 4, 1:5000 dilution of anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) was used. For detection of HA-tagged transfected ski and snoN, an anti-HA antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used. In all cases, proteins were detected by 1:5000 dilution of an appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch or Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Proteins were then detected by chemiluminescence (Pierce). Bands on Western blots were quantified using a computer program (AlphaEase, Alpha Innotech), and values were expressed in arbitrary densitometric units. Protein extracts were prepared from ∼1 × 106 NIH 3T3 control cells or cells treated with TGFβ2 (2 ng/ml) for 60 min following serum starvation for 24 h. Cells were then lysed, and protein nuclear extracts were prepared as previously described (42Leask A. Byrne C. Fuchs E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7948-7952Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Oligonucleotide probes as indicated were 32P-labeled, gel purified, and incubated with nuclear extracts for 30 min at 30°. Gel shift conditions consisted of 1–3 μl of nuclear extract (containing 2–5 μg protein) and 0.5 ng probe (1–5 × 104 cpm) in a final volume of 15 μl of 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 and 50 μg per ml poly(dI-dC) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For antibody treatment, nuclear extracts were incubated with 2 μg of the indicated antibodies prior to addition of probe. SMAD2 antibody was from Zymed Laboratories Inc.and SMAD3 and SMAD4 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. For competition experiments, 50- or 100-fold excess cold competitor (25 or 50 ng, respectively of unlabeled probe) was added to the reaction mixture before incubation when required. Complexes were resolved on 6% nondenaturing acrylamide gels using 0.5× Tris-Borate-EDTA. Gels were then dried, and complexes were visualized by autoradiography. NIH 3T3 cells were transfected as described above with 2 μg each of expression vector encoding SMAD3·FLAG, SMAD4·FLAG, ski·HA or snoN·HA per 100-mm dish. Forty-eight hours later, cells were lysed in 800 μl of ice-cold freshly prepared 50 mm Hepes, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium pervanadate, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.9. Cells were lysed on ice, scraped, sonicated, and spun. To 100 μl of lysate, 40 μl of agarose affinity gel conjugated with an anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) was added. Gel without antibody was used as a control. Gel and protein slurry was rotated on a shaker for 2 h at 4o. Beads were washed in lysis buffer (1 ml) three times. Protein was eluted with protein sample buffer (100 μl) and stored at −80o. Samples (25 μl) were then subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis through a 4–20% gel (Novex), and gels were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). After blocking membrane for 2 h at room temperature in phosphate-buffered saline, 5% nonfat dry milk, 0.1% Tween 20, blots were incubated overnight at 4 oC with a 1:2000 dilution of anti-HA antibody (Covance). After extensive washing, proteins were detected by a 1:5000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals or Jackson Immunoresearch). Antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer. A chemiluminescent detection kit was used to observe proteins (Pierce). Recently, we identified a segment of the CTGF promoter between nucleotides −244 and −166 that was required for the TGFβ-mediated induction of CTGF (20Abraham D.J. Shiwen X Black C.M. Sa S. Xu Y. Leask A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1522-1525Google Scholar). Sequence inspection of the region of the CTGF promoter between −244 and −166 resulted in the identification of a putative consensus SMAD site (35Zawel L. Dai J.L Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 11-17Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (890) Google Scholar, 36Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Derynck R.

Chem. 1998; 273: 21145-21152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) immediately upstream of −166 (Fig.1 A). Mutating this sequence to a BamHI site in an otherwise wild-type, full-lengthCTGF promoter/SEAP reporter construct resulted in complete abolition of TGFβ-induced gene expression when this construct was transfected into NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (Fig. 1 B). Thus, a consensus SMAD binding site seems necessary for TGFβ-induction of CTGF. Previously, a sequence immediately downstream of this element was identified as being necessary for maximal TGFβ induction of CTGF, and hence was called the TGFβRE (25Grotendorst G.R. Okochi H. Hayashi N. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 469-480PubMed Google Scholar). To compare the relative contribution of the SMAD site and the TGFβRE in terms of the TGFβ induction of CTGF, we mutated the TGFβRE to a BamHI site. In contrast to mutating the SMAD site, mutating the TGFβRE caused a marked decrease in basal CTGF expression, whereas still permitting a response to TGFβ (Fig. 1 C). Thus, the factor(s) binding to the TGFβRE are required for basal CTGF transcription and hence for the maximal response of the CTGF promoter to TGFβ (25Grotendorst G.R. Okochi H. Hayashi N. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 469-480PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether SMAD proteins could bind to the putative SMAD binding site, we performed a gel shift assay with NIH 3T3 fibroblast nuclear extract, made from cells that had been treated with TGFβ. A radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe containing the putative SMAD binding site was used as probe (see Fig. 1 for sequence). We found that protein complexes could bind the probe (Fig.2, arrow). This binding was specific as binding could be competed by adding excess unlabeled oligomer (Fig. 2). Binding of one of the complexes could be abolished by preincubating nuclear extract with an anti-SMAD3 or anti-SMAD4 antibody, but not with an anti-SMAD2 antibody (Fig. 2). Collectively, these data suggest that the putative SMAD site identified as being important for gene expression is a bona fide SMAD binding site. The components of the other complex are under further investigation. To determine whether SMADs could regulate CTGF gene expression, we cotransfected expression vectors encoding various SMADs with a full-length CTGF promoter/SEAP construct into NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. Cotransfection of SMAD3 and SMAD4 enhanced CTGF expression significantly (Fig. 3 A). However, cotransfection of SMAD2 and SMAD4 did not potentiate the TGFβ-mediated induction of CTGF (Fig. 3 A). Individually, only SMAD3 and SMAD4 mildly increased CTGF promoter activity in the absence of added TGFβ, with SMAD4-inducing activity to approximately the same level as SMAD2 and SMAD4 combined (not shown). Transfection of the inhibitory SMAD, SMAD7, markedly at"

Hydrogen Bonding: A Theoretical Perspective. Oxford University Press, New York1997: 52-290Google Scholar), the same cannot be said for the CH··O interaction, which is only now gaining wide acceptance as a genuine hydrogen bond (H-bond)1 (4Wahl M.C.

Although normally weaker than its conventional OH··O cousin, the CH··O interaction is thought to be crucial in a large number of molecular complexes and crystal structures (6Meadows E.S. De Wall S.L.

Indeed, the CH··O bond has been deemed so important as to foster the recommendation that the many crystal refinement programs that treat nonbonded C··O separations as repulsive ought to be revised (4Wahl M.C.

This being the case, it would be surprising indeed if the CH··O bond were any less important in biological systems. In fact, after some early proposals of CH··O contacts (13Sussman J.L. Seeman N.C., S.-H., K. Berman H.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 66: 403-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 14Rubin J. Brennan T. Sundaralingam M.

Soc. 1996; 118: 12309-12321Crossref Scopus (407) Google Scholar). There is an increasing body of evidence that CH··O contacts occur with some regularity in proteins as well. It was noted some time ago that the crystal structures of various amino acids contain these interactions (28Jeffrey G.A. Maluszynska H. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1982; 4: 173-185Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar), but their importance to larger protein segments such as α-glycine (29Berkovitch-Yellin Z. Leiserowitz L. Acta Crystallogr. B. 1984; 40: 159-165Crossref Scopus (295) Google Scholar) has been revealed as well. Other groups that appear to be involved in CH··O H-bonding include the aryl groups of aromatic residues like phenylalanine (30Thomas K.T. Smith G.M. Thomas T.B. Feldmann R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 4843-4847Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), the CδH of proline (31Chakrabarti P. Chakrabarti S. J. Mol.

Soc. 1993; 115: 4540-4547Crossref Scopus (284) Google Scholar). By far the most prevalent CH group in proteins involves the Cα of each amino acid residue, so its possible involvement in H-bonds is of profound consequence. Even if individually weak, the sheer number of such CαH··O H-bonds could exert an enormous influence upon the structure and function of a protein (4Wahl M.C. Sundaralingam M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 97-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 35Musah R.A. Jensen G.M. Rosenfeld R.J. McRee D.E. Goodin D.B. Bunte S.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 9083-9084Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Perhaps the earliest direct evidence that the CαH group might in fact participate in H-bonds derives from a neutron diffraction study of amino acid crystals (28Jeffrey G.A. Maluszynska H. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1982; 4: 173-185Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar), which found geometric indicators of as many as 16 different CαH··O H-bonds. This idea was later confirmed in a wide variety of proteins (36Derewenda Z.S. Lee L. Derewenda U. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 248-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar), including the collagen triple helix (37Bella J. Berman H.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 734-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), and in β-sheets (38Fabiola G.F. Krishnaswamy S. Nagarajan V. Pattabhi V. Acta Crystallogr. D. 1997; 53: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), where the CH··O bonds are thought to confer additional stability. Despite the finding of numerous CαH··O contacts in proteins, major questions remain about their importance. While providing a wealth of information about geometries, the numerous crystal structures on which most current knowledge about the CαH··O interaction is based are silent on the energetic aspects. In short, “nothing is known experimentally about the strength of these interactions” (35Musah R.A. Jensen G.M. Rosenfeld R.J. McRee D.E. Goodin D.B. Bunte S.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 9083-9084Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Yet it is the strength of this binding that is of most importance in understanding the possible role that the CαH··O H-bond may play in the folding and function of proteins. It is here that one can profitably turn to ab initio quantum calculations, a particular strength of which is the assessment of interaction energies between various entities. In the case of the general CH··O interaction, there have been a number of relevant calculations (see Ref. 39Scheiner, S., Advances in Molecular Structure Research, Hargittai, M., Hargittai, I., 6, 2000, 159, 207, JAI Press, Stamford, CT.Google Scholar for a summary). It has been learned for example that the interaction energy of a small prototype, the methane-water pair, is 0.5 ± 0.1 kcal/mol (40Novoa J.J. Tarron B. Whangbo M.-H. Williams J.M. J. Chem. Phys. 1991; 95: 5179-5186Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 41Szczesniak M.M. Chalasinski G. Cybulski S.M. Cieplak P. J. Chem.

Planas M. Rovira M.C. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1996; 251: 33-46Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This value is increased systematically by roughly 1 kcal/mol as each hydrogen atom of methane is replaced by electronegative atoms like fluorine or chlorine, which make the CH a progressively stronger proton donor (44Alkorta I. Maluendes S. J. Phys. Chem. 1995; 99: 6457-6460Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 45Novoa J.J. Mota F. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1997; 266: 23-30Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 46Hobza P. Spirko V.

This enhancement is not limited to simple atoms like fluorine or chlorine but occurs as well when the CH is adjacent to larger electronegative groups as in the context of a carboxylic acid or amide (49Turi L. Dannenberg J.J. J. Phys. Chem. 1993; 97: 12197-12204Crossref Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 50Neuheuser T. Hess B.A. Reutel C. Weber E. J. Phys.

Since the CαH group of each amino acid residue in a protein is directly adjacent to a pair of electronegative groups (the N and C ends of two amide groups), it is logical to presume that its ability to form an H-bond is comparable with that of a small molecule like CH2F2. Since recent calculations (54Gu Y. Kar T. Scheiner S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 9411-9422Crossref Scopus (920) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the latter molecule does form a true H-bond, which, under certain circumstances, can be of a strength similar to a conventional OH··O interaction, an explicit examination of the H-bonding abilities of the CαH group of real amino acid residues is warranted. Reported here for the first time are the binding strengths calculated for the CαH group of a number of representative amino acids, with a common oxygen acceptor. The results indicate the comparative H-bond energy of each. In addition, supplementary IR and NMR spectroscopic information are computed so as to aid in the identification of such bonds in an experimental setting. Ab initio calculations were carried out with the GAUSSIAN 98 program using the 6–31+G** basis set (55Frisch M.J. Trucks G.W. Schlegel H.B. Scuseria G.E. Robb M.A. Cheeseman J.R. Zakrzewski V.G.

Electron correlation was included by second-order Møller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2), which has been shown to compare favorably with more advanced schemes for related systems (53Sponer J. Hobza P. J. Phys. Chem. A. 2000; 104: 4592-4597Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 56Rivelino R. Canuto S. Chem. Phys. Lett. 2000; 322: 207-212Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 57Hartmann M. Radom L. J. Phys. Chem. A. 2000; 104: 968-973Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). NMR chemical shift tensors were evaluated by the gauge-independent atomic orbital (58Wolinski K. Hilton J.F. Pulay P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 8251Crossref Scopus (5967) Google Scholar) method. The binding energies are computed as the difference in total energy between the complex on one hand and the sum of the isolated, optimized monomers on the other; basis set superposition error is removed by the counterpoise procedure (59Boys S.F. Bernardi F. Mol. Phys. 1970; 19: 553-566Crossref Scopus (19446) Google Scholar). Gly, Ala, and Val are taken as representative of the nonpolar amino acids. Ser and Cys contain the polar OH and SH groups, respectively. As examples of charged residues, the Lys+ cation and the Asp− anion were considered. All amino acids were considered in their NH2CHRCOOH nonzwitterion state so as to better model their neutral condition within a protein. Water was taken as the proton acceptor in each complex. Geometries were fully optimized; the sole restriction was that a θ(CH··O) angle of 180° was maintained in the complex to prevent the formation of complicating secondary interactions. The interaction energies of each of the various amino acids with water as the proton acceptor are reported as ΔE in the first column of data in TableI, under the convention that a negative ΔE corresponds to a favorable binding energy. The first row illustrates data for the water dimer, as a classic paradigm of an OH··O hydrogen bond, for which the electronic contribution to the binding energy is 4.51 kcal/mol at this level of theory. (This value compares quite favorably with quantities predicted at higher levels (60Scheiner S. Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. 1994; 45: 23-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar).) Replacement of the OH of the water donor by a CH group is expected to weaken the H-bond considerably. This supposition is correct in that even after the addition of two electronegative fluorine atoms to enhance its acidity, proton donor F2HCH binds to the water acceptor by only 2.53 kcal/mol, about half the value for the water dimer (54Gu Y. Kar T. Scheiner S. J. Am. Chem.

Open table in a new tab All amino acids form a CαH–O interaction. The replacement of the two fluorine atoms by the COOH and NH2 groups, respectively, results in the NH2CH2COOH amino acid glycine. Since the two substituent groups are rather electronegative, much as the two fluorine atoms, one might anticipate only a minor perturbation upon the binding energy in the complex with water. In fact, inspection of Table Iconfirms this expectation in that glycine and F2HCH have nearly identical H-bond energies. The remainder of Table I focuses upon the changes conferred by replacement of glycine by each of several other amino acids. Substitution of one hydrogen atom by methyl yields the alanine residue and a reduction of the interaction energy by 0.4 kcal/mol. Enlargement of the methyl group of alanine to the isopropyl group of valine reduces the binding energy by another 0.1 kcal/mol. It is logical to presume that the slightly larger aliphatic side chains of Leu and Ile would be similar to the result for Val, and that the binding energies of this series of amino acids, containing simple alkyl side chains, lie in the range between 2.0 and 2.5 kcal/mol. The serine residue contains the polar hydroxyl group in its CH2OH side chain. Nonetheless, its calculated H-bond energy of 2.3 kcal/mol falls right within the range of the nonpolar residues. In a more highly refined way of looking at the data, the replacement of one hydrogen atom of the Ala methyl group by the more electronegative OH enhances the H-bond energy by some 0.2 kcal/mol. In contrast, the CH2SH sulfhydryl side chain of the Cys residue reduces the binding energy of Ala by 0.2 kcal/mol. In summary, the H-bond energies of the above amino acids, including aliphatic side chains, polar CH2OH, and less polar CH2SH, are all quite similar to one another, in the 1.9–2.5 kcal/mol range. Moving on to the charged residues, we first consider the cationic lysine residue with its (CH2)4NH3+ side chain. It is logical to expect the positive charge to make the CαH group a more powerful proton donor, enhancing its H-bond to water, as occurs with conventional H-bonds. This expectation is verified in the case of the Lys+ residue, with a binding energy of 4.9 kcal/mol, about double that of the neutral residues, although the -NH3+ group bearing the formal charge is several bonds removed from the site of H-bonding. In fact, this particular CH··O H-bond is slightly stronger than the conventional OH··O of the water dimer. Turning now to aspartate, the upper curve of Fig.1 illustrates the potential for the interaction between the aspartate residue (R=CH2COO−) and a water molecule. It may be first noted that this curve contains a minimum at a R(C··O) separation of about 3.33 Å. A stretch of this H-bond by as much as 2 or 3 Å acts against an attractive force pulling the two groups together. However, once the separation has reached 5 or 6 Å and the energy has risen to 2.5 kcal/mol above the minimum, the force changes from attractive to repulsive, acting to push the groups even further apart. This long range repulsion is understandable on the basis of the electrostatic repulsion between the aspartate anion and the negative end of the water molecule's dipole moment. In one respect, this interaction represents a H-bond of about 2.5 kcal/mol, since that is the energy required to overcome the barrier in the potential. (One must be cautious about the definition of the H-bond energy in such a case, since Table I reveals that the complex is higher in energy than the two separated monomers by 1.4 kcal/mol.) The situation is less complex in the cases of the other amino acids where the potentials have no maximum. The behavior of the complex between Ala and water, illustrated by the lower curve in Fig. 1, is a case in point, where the H-bond energy is defined simply as the energy of the minimum, relative to infinite separation. In conclusion, there appears to be an attractive interaction that prevents the separation of the aspartate residue from water, despite their long range repulsive interaction. It is intriguing, but undoubtedly coincidental, that the height of this barrier is very close in magnitude to the H-bond energies of the neutral amino acids. The second column of Table Ilists the equilibrium distances between the proton donor atom and the oxygen of the water acceptor, the intrinsically preferred H-bond length. This quantity is generally correlated with ΔE, with stronger H-bonds associated with a shorter length. It is therefore interesting to find that this H-bond distance is rather uniform in all CH··O H-bonds, covering a rather narrow range between 3.31 and 3.35 Å. This range agrees quite well with the H-bond length of 3.35 Å measured by neutron diffraction for the interaction between a CαH group and a water molecule (61Steiner T. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1995; II: 1315-1319Crossref Google Scholar), as well as the average Cα··O distance of 3.31 Å in parallel β-sheets (38Fabiola G.F. Krishnaswamy S. Nagarajan V. Pattabhi V. Acta Crystallogr. D. 1997; 53: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The H-bond length is nearly constant, about 3.34 Å, for F2HCH as well as for the three aliphatic amino acids Gly, Ala, and Val. It shortens slightly to 3.31 Å for the Ser and Cys residues. Despite the stronger binding of the Lys+ residue, its H-bond length of 3.32 Å is in the same range as the other complexes, as is the separation (3.33 Å) for the anionic Asp−. The effect of the formation of the CH··O H-bond upon the CH bond length is reported in the third column of Table I (in mÅ). The first row illustrates the 5-mÅ stretch in the water dimer, a stretch that is characteristic of conventional OH··O bonds. This elongation behavior contrasts markedly with the contractions that occur in the CH··O H-bonds of all amino acids as well as F2HCH. This seemingly opposite behavior, observed in a number of CH··O bonds (46Hobza P. Spirko V. Selzle H.L. Schlag E.W. J. Phys. Chem.

A. 1999; 103: 8672-8677Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar), has nevertheless been demonstrated to be consistent with the characterization of the CH··O interaction as a true H-bond (54Gu Y. Kar T. Scheiner S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 9411-9422Crossref Scopus (920) Google Scholar). There is no clear pattern concerning the magnitude of this contraction. For example, Gly and Val elicit very small contractions, while a much larger one occurs in the similar Ala. The positive charge of the Lys+ residue does not appear to unduly raise the magnitude of this bond shortening. The largest contraction of all is associated with the aspartate anion, although its complex with water might be considered the weakest of all those considered. At any rate, the consistency of the negative values in all cases supports the idea that the CαH bond is shortened, albeit by a small amount, in all amino acid H-bonds, as occurs in a variety of other CH··O interactions. Associated with the OH bond stretch of a conventional H-bond is a red shift of its vibrational frequency. As listed in the first row of TableI, this shift amounts to −31 cm−1 for the water dimer. The positive signs of the remaining entries in the fourth column of Table I indicate that the amino acid CH bonds all shift in the opposite direction, to the blue. These positive shifts correlate with the CH bond contractions and are in fact consistent with a number of experimental observations involving CH··O bonds over the years (68Pinchas S. Anal. Chem. 1955; 27: 2-6Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 69Pinchas S. J. Phys. Chem. 1963; 67: 1862-1865Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 70Sammes M.P. Harlow R.L. J. Chem. Soc.

Buchhold K. Reimann B. Barth H.-D. Brutschy B. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1999; 299: 180-186Crossref Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Also consonant with previous findings, the magnitudes of these shifts are variable and, like the contractions of the CH bond, do not fit a simple pattern, although there is a trend for larger blue shifts to be associated with a greater amount of bond contraction. The largest shift of 70 cm−1 is associated with the aspartate anion. As mentioned above, these opposing patterns in the OH and CH covalent bond behavior are not entirely unexpected, having been observed on a number of occasions. There is now some reason to believe that the CH bond contraction/blue shift commonly occurs when the C atom is bonded to four other atoms, i.e. sp3 hybridization, as in the amino acids, but that the sp hybridization of the alkyne CH is associated with the stretch and red shift typical of conventional H-bonds (39Scheiner, S., Advances in Molecular Structure Research, Hargittai, M., Hargittai, I., 6, 2000, 159, 207, JAI Press, Stamford, CT.Google Scholar). The magnitude of blue shifts calculated here is consistent with prior work dealing with CH··O bonds (67Karger N. Amorim da Costa A.M. Ribeiro-Claro J.A. J. Phys. Chem. A. 1999; 103: 8672-8677Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 75Bedell B.L. Goldfarb L. Mysak E.R. Samet C. Maynard A. J. Phys. Chem. A. 1999; 103: 4572-4579Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In any event, these blue shifts ought to serve as a marker of the presence of a CαH··O H-bond in proteins. The next column of Table I reports the effect of H-bond formation upon the calculated intensity of each CH bond stretching frequency. The water dimer undergoes a characteristic enhancement, with the band 1.9 times stronger in the complex than in the isolated water monomer. There is little obvious pattern within the CH··O complexes, in that some bands are intensified (value greater than 1) while others behave in the opposite fashion. Hence, while a blue shift in frequency can be taken as a clear indication of the formation of a CH··O bond, it might be misleading to use the intensity as an indicator. Nuclear magnetic resonance frequencies have been used to good effect to monitor the presence of hydrogen bonds (76Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 311-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar). The calculated values of the shifts of the bridging hydrogen are reported in the last two columns of Table I, relative to the isolated monomers. The isotropic shift is listed first, followed by the anisotropic value. Probably the most well recognized NMR diagn"

IP3-mediated release of Ca2+ from internal endoplasmic reticulum stores has been well characterized, since the availability of specific vital dyes that allow monitoring of [Ca2+]i in single living cells with high spatial and temporal resolution. These studies have demonstrated a variety of different response kinetics, including transient and sustained Ca2+ increases, oscillations and Ca2+ waves (1Thomas A.P. Bird G.S. Hajnoczky G. Robb-Gaspers L.D. Putney Jr., J.W. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1505-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). An important conclusion drawn from these studies is that kinetic differences in [Ca2+]iresponses can have marked effects on downstream regulatory targets with important physiological consequences (2Dupont G. Goldbeter A. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 607-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Although Ca2+ signals are believed to reflect IP3 increases and hence PLC activation, it was noted in several studies that various agonists generate grossly different amounts of inositol phosphates, only to achieve similar [Ca2+]i responses (3Chau L.Y. Lin T.A. Chang W.T. Chen C.H. Shue M.J. Hsu Y.S. Hu C.Y. Tsai W.H. Sun G.Y. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 454-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, due to the lack of suitable methods, activation and inactivation kinetics of PLC have not been characterized in single cells. An exciting recent development is the utilization of GFP-tagged protein domains for the in vivo visualization of inositide lipid dynamics. For example, the pleckstrin homology domain of PLCδ1 that binds to PI(4,5)P2 has been used to monitor changes in the cellular levels of this lipid (4Stauffer T.P. Ahn S. Meyer T. Curr.

Rother K.I. Balla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10983-10989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 7Gray A. Van Der K.J. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 929-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In these studies detection is based on imaging of the change in localization of GFP-PH by fluorescence microscopy. PLCδ1PH-GFP, for instance, is located at the membrane in resting cells, where it is bound to PI(4,5)P2 (5Varnai P. Balla T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar), and upon agonist-induced PI(4,5)P2 hydrolysis it translocates to the cytosol. Subsequently, when PI(4,5)P2 is resynthesized, fluorescence returns to the membrane. The transient translocation is usually detected in single cells by confocal imaging and quantified by post-acquisition image analysis (4Stauffer T.P. Ahn S. Meyer T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 343-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Varnai P. Rother K.I. Balla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10983-10989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). While this approach has a number of obvious advantages, including detection of changes in single living cells with time resolution in the second range, it also has several limitations. First, it is hard to obtain quantitative data from translocation studies using confocal microscopy. Even minor focal drift and changes in cell morphology, that often occur after stimulation, degrade signal-to-noise ratio, since these will render it difficult to reliably assign measurement regions (so-called regions of interest) that correspond to membrane and cytosol. Second, it is difficult to see translocation in very flat cells or in cellular subregions such as neurites and lamellipodia. Third, at fast imaging rates, confocal imaging requires high excitation intensities that can cause severe cell damage in a matter of minutes. Therefore, there is a trade-off between sampling speed and duration of the experiment. Moreover, single cell determinations are inherently variable, and the imaging approach is not easily extended to cell populations. To overcome these limitations, we have applied fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) as a way to improve the detection of PH domain translocation. FRET, the radiationless transfer of energy from a fluorescent donor to a suitable acceptor fluorophore, depends on fluorophore spectral overlap and dipole alignment, and is a very steep function of donor-acceptor distance (for review, see Refs. 8Lankiewicz L. Malicka J. Wiczk W. Acta Biochim. Pol. 1997; 44: 477-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar and 9Pollok B.A. Heim R. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 57-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). For the GFP mutants CFP and YFP, FRET can take place when the fluorophores are within ∼10 nm distance. Here we describe FRET between CFP- and YFP-tagged PH domains of PLCδ1 as a sensitive readout for membrane localization that offers a number of the advantages over confocal imaging. FRET detects agonist-induced translocation of the fluorescent proteins from the membrane to the cytosol essentially identical to what was reported in GFP-PH imaging studies, without the need for optical sectioning, providing with a more reliable quantitative measurement of membrane localization. In addition, this method is applicable for cell populations and single neurites, and allows analysis for extended periods of time with minimal cell damage. Comparison of FRET responses in several cell types with various agonists reveals significant differences between kinetics of PLC activation triggered via various GPCRs, despite similar [Ca2+]i responses. It is also shown that receptor activity and desensitization, rather than post-G protein mechanism(s) is a major determinant of the PLC activation pattern. 1-Oleoyl-LPA, histamine, bradykinin, phenylarsine oxide, and quercetin were from Sigma; neurokinin A, caged IP3 (catalog number 407135), and ionomycin were from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp. (La Jolla, CA);myo-[3H]inositol (60 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Fura red (K salt) and bodipy-FL were from Molecular Probes Inc. (Eugene, OR). All other chemicals were of analytical grade. The pleckstrin homology domain was obtained from the Superhiro PLCδ1PH construct (amino acids 1–174; a kind gift from Dr. Tobias Meyer) and cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pECFP-C1 (CLONTECH, CA). Two primers (PLCδPH1; 5′-CCTGCGGCCGCGGTACCGATATCAGATGTTGAGCTCCTTCAG-3′ and PLCδPH2; 5′-CCGAATTCCCGGGTCTCAGCCATGGACTCGGGCCGGGACTTC-3′) were designed to generate the PH domain in-frame behind the CFP followed by a stop codon. The polymerase chain reaction product was cloned into the pECFP plasmid with the restriction sites EcoRI andEcoRV on EcoRI and SmaI, leading topECFP-PH. YFP was obtained from yellow Cameleon 2.0 (a kind gift from A. Miyawaki and R. Tsien) and subcloned into cloning vector PGEM3z (Promega), viaSacI and EcoRI, and subsequently into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) via BamHI and EcoRI. Polymerase chain reaction on YFP-pcDNA-3 with primers T7 (Promega) and GFP3; 5′-GGCTGAGACCCGGGAATTCGGCTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATG-3′ was done to remove the stop codon. The polymerase chain reaction product, taken between primers PLCδPH1 and PLCδPH2, was cloned in-frame behind YFP withEcoRI and NotI, leading topcDNA3YFPPH. To obtainpcDNA3eGFPPH, YFP was swapped with enhanced GFP, using primers T7 and GFP3 on pcDNA3eGFP and restriction enzymes BamHI and EcoRI. For YFP-CAAX andGFP-CAAX , the membrane localization sequence of K-Ras (KMSKDGKKKKKKSKTKCVIM) was obtained by polymerase chain reaction amplification from Bp180-CAAX (GenBankTM accession numbers M54968 and M38506), using primers CAAX3 5′-CCGAATTCCCGGGTCAAGATGAGCAAAGATGGTAAAAAG-3′, containing anEcoRI site, and CAAX2; 5′-CCTGCGGCCGCGGTACCGAGATCTTTACATAATTACACACTT-3′, that contained a NotI site behind the stop codon. The final constructs were made by exchanging the PH domain from YFP-PH and GFP-PH for the CAAX domain using EcoRI and NotI. All clones were verified by sequence analysis. YFP-CAAXcontained a point mutation (Val instead of Gly in the CAAX domain), but this did not influence its membrane localization. The constitutively active mutants of Gαq and Gα12 cloned into pcDNA3 vectors were a kind gift from Dr. O. Kranenburg et al. (10Kranenburg O. Poland M. van Horck F.P. Drechsel D. Hall A. Moolenaar W.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1851-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells were seeded in 6-well plates at ∼25,000 cells per well on 25-mm glass coverslips, and cultured in 3 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Unless otherwise indicated, constructs were transfected for 6–12 h using calcium phosphate precipitate, at 0.8 μg of DNA/well. Following transfection, cells were incubated in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 12–48 h. For fluorescence detections, coverslips with cells were transferred to a culture chamber and mounted on an inverted microscope. All experiments were performed in bicarbonate-buffered saline (containing, in mm, 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 glucose, with 10 mm HEPES added), pH 7.2, kept under 5% CO2, at 37 °C. Preparation, culture, and labeling of bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells have been described elsewhere (11Balla T. Nakanishi S. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16101-16107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells labeled withmyo-[3H]inositol for 24–48 h were stimulated by angiotensin II (30 nm) for the indicated times in a medium containing either Sr2+ or Ca2+. Reactions were terminated with perchloric acid and inositol phosphates were separated by high performance liquid chromatography essentially as described previously (11Balla T. Nakanishi S. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16101-16107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For confocal imaging, a Leica DM-IRBE inverted microscope fitted with a TCS-SP scanhead was used. Excitation of enhanced GFP was with the 488-nm argon ion laserline, and emission was collected at 500–565 nm. For translocation studies, series of confocal images were taken at 2–10-s intervals and stored on disc. Determination of the ratio of membrane to cytosolic fluorescence by directly assigning regions of interest for membrane and cytosol was hampered by the shape changes of cells during experiments (see text). Using Qwin software (Leica) this ratio was therefore calculated by post-acquisition automated regions of interest assignment and analysis. In brief, a binary mask of the transfected cell was lined out using a thresholding step on a smoothed image. From this mask, the area corresponding to the membrane was eroded by a user-selectable amount to delineate the membrane. Further erosion was then applied to reliably separate membrane from cytosol area, and the remaining area was taken to represent cytosol. This mask was updated for each image in a series, and translocation was expressed as ratio of the fluorescence values for membrane and cytosol area, to correct for bleaching. This approach corrects fully for cell movements and shape changes, and was able to reliably detect very minor translocations (using e.g. diluted agonists) that went unnoticed for the eye. For FRET experiments, cells on coverslips were placed on an inverted Zeiss Axiovert 135 microscope equipped with a dry Achroplan ×63 (NA 0.75) objective. Excitation of CFP was at 425 ± 5 nm, and emission was collected with a 460-nm dichroic mirror. Emission of CFP and YFP was split using an additional 505-nm dichroic mirror and filtered with 475DF30 and 540DF40 band pass filters, respectively. Detection was with PTI model 612 analog photomultipliers, and for data acquisition, the FELIX software (PTI Inc.) was used. FRET was expressed as ratio of CFP to YFP signals, the value of which was set as 1.0 at the onset of the experiment. Changes are expressed as percent deviation from this initial value of 1.0. For detection of intracellular Ca2+, Yellow Cameleon 2.1 was used (12Miyawaki A. Llopis J. Heim R. McCaffery J.M. Adams J.A. Ikura M. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1997; 388: 882-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (2650) Google Scholar) at the same wavelengths. For sustained stimulation, agonists and inhibitors were added to the medium from concentrated stocks. Stimulation with short pulses of NKA was performed by placing a glass micropipette (tip Ø ∼2 μm) at about 25 μm from the cell using an Eppendorf microinjection system and applying pulses of pressure for 10 s. It was verified using Lucifer Yellow in the pipette that following termination of the pressure pulse the concentration at the cell rapidly dropped toward zero. Before electroporation, adherent cells grown on coverslips were washed twice in intracellular buffer (containing in mm: 70 KCl, 70 K glutamate, 2 MgCl2, 0 CaCl2, 5 phosphate buffer, pH 7.1) and then 70 μl of this intracellular buffer was added to the cells with 20 μmFura red tetrapotassium salt and 1, 10, or 100 μm caged IP3. Electroporation was achieved by a series of 15 high frequency square wave pulses, (1-s spaced, amplitude 150 V, frequency 80 kHz, lasting 0.5 ms each) using 2 platina electrodes of 8 × 3 mm with 2.5-mm spacing. The efficiency of this method was assessed by control permeabilizations that were performed on the stage of a confocal microscope. This protocol caused complete permeabilization (based on equilibration of intracellular calcein concentrations with the extracellular buffer) of the cells in the area between the electrodes. For photorelease of caged IP3, a single cell was illuminated with a short pulse of UV light (340–410 nm) from a 100 W HBO lamp using a shutter. The shutter open time was adjusted to give full release of caged IP3, that is no response being observed with a subsequent illumination. For partial photolysis, the flash intensity was adjusted by neutral density filters placed in the illumination pathway. For quantitation of expression levels of CFP-PH and YFP-PH, cellular fluorescence was compared with the fluorescence of a solution of known concentration of purified, bacterially expressed CFP-PH or YFP-PH, following the method of Miyawaki et al. (37Miyawaki A. Llopis J. Mizuno H. Jalink K. Tsien R. Calcium Signaling: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford2000: 3-16Google Scholar). In short, CFP-PH and YFP-PH were expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins, and purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads. Protein concentration (5.4 μm) was measured by the BCA Protein Assay (Pierce). Calibration of the fluorescent brightness of this protein preparation, using values for molar absorption and quantum yield of 36,500 and 0.63, respectively (13Patterson G.H. Knobel S.M. Sharif W.D. Kain S.R. Piston D.W. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 2782-2790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar), against commercial standards indicated that essentially 100% of proteins were fluorescent. The solution was then introduced in a linear wedge-shaped chamber (0–170 μm thickness) that was placed on the microscope (using NA 0.7 objective), and the position of the chamber was adjusted to give a fluorescence readout that matched that of a single, CFP or YFP expressing cell. The estimate of the fluorescent protein concentration in the cell was obtained by comparing the local thickness of the wedge to that of an average cell (17 μm). Relative amounts of CFP-PH and YFP-PH expression in cells were always determined under conditions of full cytosolic localization of the constructs. Comparison of voxel intensities within cells and the protein solution using a confocal microscope gave very similar results. At the onset of each experiment, photomultiplier gains (high voltage) were adjusted to give a standard 6 V output for the resting cell. Noting that over an extended range of light input, every 2-fold change in intensity corresponds to a 35 V change in cathode voltage, cell intensities were measured. By comparing these intensities to the values obtained with the GFP wedge, estimates of expression levels were obtained. For FRAP experiments, cells were imaged using a Leica TCS-SP confocal microscope equipped with ×63 (NA 1.3) oil immersion objective. The beam from a external ArKr laser (25 mW) was coupled into the backfocal plane of the objective via the epifluorescence excitation port, using a 30/70 beamsplitter, thus allowing simultaneous imaging and spot bleaching. Spots of ∼1.3 μm (full width half-maximum) were bleached (>95%) in the basal membrane using a single 30-ms pulse from the ArKr laser during data collection in linescan mode at 1000, 500, or 125 Hz. Data were corrected for slight (<7%) background bleaching and fitted with single exponents using Clampfit software (Axon Instruments). PH-CFP and PH-YFP chimera were transiently transfected into N1E-115 mouse neuroblastoma cells at a 1:1 molar ratio. After 1–2 days, cells were transferred to an inverted epifluorescence microscope and assayed for FRET by simultaneously monitoring the emission of CFP (475 ± 15 nm) and of YFP (530 ± 20 nm), while exciting CFP at 425 ± 5 nm. In resting cells, PH-CFP and PH-YFP reside at the plasma membrane bound to PI(4,5)P2, and the two fluorophores remain within resonance distance. Upon activation of PLC by the addition of BK, PI(4,5)P2 is rapidly hydrolyzed and consequently PH domains can no longer bind to the plasma membrane. The distance(s) between fluorophores increase significantly, and therefore FRET no longer occurs (Fig. 1). As a result, the donor (CFP) emission intensity increases, while the acceptor (YFP) emission decreases. By taking the ratio of CFP to YFP emission, the FRET signal becomes essentially independent on excitation intensity fluctuations and photobleaching. The kinetics of BK-induced PLC activation in N1E-115 cells as detected by FRET is characterized by a rapid onset, with translocation peaking at 20–30 s after addition of the agonist. The decaying phase is somewhat slower, usually returning to baseline within 1 to 4 min. This time course is very similar to that deduced from confocal detection of PLCδ1PH-GFP translocation recorded under identical conditions (Fig.1 C). In this latter case, the data were extracted from a time series using post-acquisition automated image analysis (see “Experimental Procedures”). Similar translocation responses can be obtained by FRET in other cell types, including A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells, HEK293 embryonal kidney cells, and COS monkey kidney cells stimulated with a variety of ligands to Gq-coupled receptors. The above described kinetics with a fast and rather complete translocation induced by BK, suggest that PI(4,5)P2depletion after stimulation is quite extensive. While most reports of agonist-induced PI(4,5)P2 hydrolysis, as detected biochemically from [3H]inositol-labeled cells, show slower and less pronounced decreases in phosphoinositide levels, considerable agonist- and cell type-dependent variations exist, e.g. Refs. 14Tilly B.C. van Paridon P.A.

Where early time points were also studied, rapid decreases in PI(4,5)P2 levels have been detected (17Wijelath E.S. Kardasz A.M. Drummond R. Watson J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 152: 392-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 18Divecha N. Banfic H. Irvine R.F. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3207-3214Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 19Stephens L. Jackson T.R. Hawkins P.T. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). For example, significant bradykinin-induced PI(4,5)P2 decreases were reported to occur within 10 s in bovine aortic endothelial cells (20Myers D.E. Larkins R.G. Cell Signal. 1989; 1: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and at 1 min in bombesin-stimulated 3T3 cells (18Divecha N. Banfic H. Irvine R.F. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3207-3214Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Rapid recovery toward basal levels has also been found. Wijelath et al. (17Wijelath E.S. Kardasz A.M. Drummond R. Watson J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 152: 392-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) reported as much as 85% hydrolysis of PI(4,5)P2 at 5 s after stimulation of macrophages with interleukin, while PI(4,5)P2 levels recovered to 50% at 60 s. Similar fast recovery was also seen in other cell types (18Divecha N. Banfic H. Irvine R.F. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3207-3214Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 19Stephens L. Jackson T.R. Hawkins P.T. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Since biochemical analyses have to rely upon measurements on cell populations, where not all cells give synchronized and identical responses (and many cells may not respond at all), it is not surprising to find differences between the results of measurements with these two alternative approaches. During agonist-induced translocation, several factors may affect the fluorescent properties of these PH domain chimeras as well as the transfer of fluorescent energy between them (21Tsien R.Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 509-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (4983) Google Scholar). For example, the move away from a compartment adjacent to the lipophilic membrane could alter fluorescent characteristics, and is also likely to alter FRET by increasing the degree of rotational freedom. While the relative influence of increased rotational freedom on the translocation-induced decrease in FRET is difficult to assess in this model sytem, we analyzed fluorescence changes in some further detail. Cells were transfected with only one of the PLCδ1PH-CFP or PLCδ1PH-YFP constructs. After stimulation, a small but consistent transient fluorescence decrease was observed with either the CFP or the YFP-tagged PH domains (Fig. 2). The original green construct (PLCδ1PH-GFP) displayed similar behavior (not shown). This transient decrease is likely caused by fluorophore displacement from the membrane, since it is not observed in cells that express a more stably membrane-anchored GFP-CAAX, nor is it seen in cells that express a mutated PLCδ1PH-GFP (R40L) (5Varnai P. Balla T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar) that cannot bind PI(4,5)P2 and, therefore, is cytosolic throughout the experiment. The precise mechanism that causes this decrease of emission upon cytosolic translocation is unknown; however, influence of the local microenvironment (e.g.hydrophobicity, charged groups, changing ion concentrations etc.) on the spectral properties of GFP seems to be the likely reason (21Tsien R.Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 509-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (4983) Google Scholar). When recording FRET, this downward “displacement” effect will be added to the translocation-induced decrease of the YFP signal, while it will lessen the simultaneous CFP increase, likely explaining why the translocation-induced decrease in YFP signal is somewhat larger than the increase in CFP fluorescence. However, expressing FRET as an emission ratio largely eliminates this effect. As expected, FRET could also be measured in cells that coexpress PLCδ1PH-CFP with YFP-CAAX (not shown); however, using this pair, ratioing does not cancel the above mentioned displacement effect. To assess the effects of construct concentrations on FRET, we compared cells expressing various levels of the chimeric proteins. Intracellular fluorescent protein concentrations were estimated by comparing the emission intensities of individual cells to those of a solution of bacterially expressed, purified protein of known concentration (37Miyawaki A. Llopis J. Mizuno H. Jalink K. Tsien R. Calcium Signaling: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford2000: 3-16Google Scholar) (see “Experimental Procedures”). Based on these estimates, resonance could be observed in cells with expression levels between about 0.8 and 80 μm, over a 100-fold concentration range. However, FRET was not observed in cells expressing less than ∼400 nm of each of the constructs. High expression levels, on the other hand, appeared to be detrimental to the cells (as judged from the appearance of membrane blebs, rounding and detachment of cells 2–3 days after transfection). For our analysis, we selected cells with estimated expression levels between 0.8 and 12 μm , which corresponds to the range that is used for confocal detection of translocation, the lower value being just 2 to 3 times the autofluorescence of the cells (13Patterson G.H. Knobel S.M. Sharif W.D. Kain S.R. Piston D.W. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 2782-2790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). These data also revealed that PLCδ1PH-CFP expression levels (detected in fully translocated cells) did not differ more than about 2-fold from those of PLCδ1PH-YFP in most cells. It is interesting to note that we could not see signs of saturation of the membrane-binding sites for the fluorescent PH domains, and could not establish a trend in which higher PH domain expression would be associated with altered translocation kinetics. Whether cells respond to the expression of these probes with compensatory increases in PI(4,5)P2 levels remains to be investigated. Nevertheless, possible interference of the expressed PH domains with cellular signals including PLC activation per se, needs to be kept in mind when using such analyses. Can such estimates of CFP and YFP concentrations be used to calculate lipid concentrations and molecular proximity in the cells studied? If we model a typi"

The finding that β-catenin and GSK3β interact with the cytoplasmic domain of the DF3/MUC1 mucin-like glycoprotein has supported the involvement of an additional pathway in β-catenin signaling (16Yamamoto M.

Hybridoma. 1984; 3: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). In addition, whereas MUC1 expression is restricted to the apical borders of normal secretory epithelial cells, MUC1 is aberrantly expressed by carcinoma cells at high levels throughout the cytoplasm and over the entire cell surface (18Kufe D. Inghirami G. Abe M. Hayes D. Justi-Wheeler H. Schlom J. Hybridoma. 1984; 3: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 19Friedman E.L. Hayes D.F. Kufe D.W.

The MUC1 protein consists of an N-terminal ectodomain with variable numbers of 20-amino acid tandem repeats that are subject to extensive O-glycosylation (21Gendler S. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Duhig T. Rothbard J. Burchell J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12820-12823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Siddiqui J. Abe M. Hayes D. Shani E. Yunis E. Kufe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2320-2323Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The C-terminal region includes a transmembrane domain and a 72-amino acid cytoplasmic tail. MUC1 is subject to proteolytic cleavage and the large ectodomain containing the tandem repeats can remain complexed to the 25-kDa C-terminal subunit or undergo release from the cell surface (23Ligtenberg M. Buijs F. Vos H. Hilkens J. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 223-232Google Scholar). β-catenin binds directly to MUC1 at a SAGNGGSSL motif in the cytoplasmic domain (16Yamamoto M. Bharti A. Li Y. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12492-12494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Similar SXXXXXSSL sites in E-cadherin and APC are responsible for β-catenin interactions (4Rubinfield B. Souza B. Albert I. Muller O. Chamberlain S. Masiarz S. Munemitsu S. Polakis P.

Science. 1993; 262: 1734-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar). GSK3β also binds directly to MUC1 and phosphorylates serine in a DRSPY site adjacent to that for the β-catenin interaction (17Li Y. Bharti A. Chen D. Gong J. Kufe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7216-7224Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation of MUC1 decreases the association of MUC1 and β-catenin (17Li Y. Bharti A. Chen D. Gong J. Kufe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7216-7224Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The present studies demonstrate that the c-Src tyrosine kinase interacts directly with MUC1. A YEKV motif in the MUC1 cytoplasmic domain (CD) has been identified as a site for c-Src phosphorylation. The results demonstrate that c-Src regulates the interactions of MUC1 with GSK3β and β-catenin. Human ZR-75-1 breast carcinoma cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 2 mml-glutamine. 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. Subconfluent cells were disrupted on ice in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mmNaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mmdithiothreitol) for 30 min. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 20 min. Equal amounts of protein from cell lysates were incubated with normal mouse IgG, MAb DF3 (anti-MUC1) (18Kufe D. Inghirami G. Abe M. Hayes D. Justi-Wheeler H. Schlom J. Hybridoma. 1984; 3: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), anti-c-Src (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), or the rabbit anti-DF3-E antibody prepared against a peptide derived from the MUC1 extracellular domain (HDVETQFNQYKTEAAS). After incubation for 2 h at 4 °C, the immune complexes were precipitated with protein G-agarose. The immunoprecipitates were washed with lysis buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The immunoblots were probed with 500 ng/ml anti-MUC1 or 1 μg/ml anti-c-Src. Reactivity was detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibodies and chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The MUC1/CD(Y46F) and MUC1(Y46F) mutants were generated using site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to change Tyr-46 to Phe. Kinase-inactive c-Src was similarly generated by mutation of Lys-295 to Arg (K295R) (24Kamps M.P. Sefton B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 751-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Purified wild-type and mutant MUC1/CD proteins were incubated with 1.5 units of purified c-Src (Oncogene Research Products, Cambridge, MA) in 20 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mmMgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol). The reaction was initiated by addition of 10 μCi [γ-32P]ATP. After incubation for 15 min at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by addition of sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. Phosphorylated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography. Purified wild-type and mutant MUC1/CD proteins were incubated with 1.5 units of c-Src in the presence or absence of 200 μm ATP for 30 min at 30 °C. GST, GST-Src-SH3, GST-Src-SH3De90/92 (Ref. 25Shiue L. Zoller M. Brugge J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10498-10502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, provided by Dr. J. Brugge, Harvard Medical School), GST-Src-SH2, or GST-β-catenin bound to glutathione beads was then added, and the reaction was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing, the proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis with the anti-MUC1/CD antibody that was generated against the cytoplasmic domain (17Li Y. Bharti A. Chen D. Gong J. Kufe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7216-7224Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In other studies, GST-MUC1/CD bound to glutathione beads was incubated with 1.5 units of c-Src in the presence and absence of 200 μm ATP for 30 min at 30 °C before adding 0.1 mg of purified GSK3β (New England BioLabs) for an additional 1 h. Precipitated proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-GSK3β. ZR-75-1 or 293 cells were transiently transfected with pCMV, pCMV-MUC1, pCMV-c-Src (provided by Dr. R. Rickles, ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cambridge, MA) or pCMV-c-Src(K295R) using electroporation methods. Efficiency of transient transfections ranged from 40–50% of ZR-75-1 cells and 70–80% of 293 cells. Cell lysates were prepared at 48 h after transfection. To determine whether DF3/MUC1 forms a complex with c-Src, anti-MUC1 immunoprecipitates from lysates of human ZR-75-1 cells were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-c-Src. The results demonstrate that c-Src coprecipitates with MUC1 (Fig.1 A, left). In the reciprocal experiment, analysis of anti-c-Src immunoprecipitates by immunoblotting with anti-MUC1 confirmed the association of MUC1 and c-Src (Fig. 1 A, right). Similar results have been obtained in human HeLa cells (data not shown). To assess whether the binding is direct, we incubated purified His-tagged MUC1 cytoplasmic domain (His-MUC1/CD) with a GST fusion protein that contains the c-Src SH3 domain. Analysis of the adsorbate to glutathione beads by immunoblotting with anti-MUC1/CD demonstrated binding of MUC1/CD to GST-Src SH3, and not GST or a GST-Src SH2 fusion protein (Fig.1 B). As an additional control, His-MUC1/CD was incubated with a GST fusion protein containing a mutated c-Src SH3 domain (GST-Src SH3De90/92) (26Weng Z. Rickles R. Feng S. Richard S. Shaw A. Schreiber S. Brugge J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5627-5634Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The finding that MUC1/CD binds to wild-type c-Src SH3 but not the mutant supported a direct interaction between MUC1 and c-Src (Fig. 1 C). To determine whether MUC1/CD is a substrate for c-Src, we incubated MUC1/CD with purified c-Src and [γ-32P]ATP. Analysis of the reaction products by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography demonstrated c-Src-mediated phosphorylation of MUC1/CD (Fig. 2 A). Previous studies have demonstrated that GSK3β phosphorylates MUC1/CD on Ser at a DRSPYEKV site (17Li Y. Bharti A. Chen D. Gong J. Kufe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7216-7224Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). As the adjacent YEKV sequence represents a consensus for c-Src phosphorylation, MUC1/CD was generated with a FEKV mutation (Fig. 2 B). Incubation of MUC1/CD(Y46F) with c-Src demonstrated a decrease in phosphorylation as compared with that found with wild-type MUC1/CD (Fig. 2 C). These findings indicate that c-Src phosphorylates MUC1/CD predominantly but not exclusively at the YEKV site. As the c-Src SH2 domain interacts with a preferred pYEEI sequence (27Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2391) Google Scholar), c-Src-mediated phosphorylation of YEKV in MUC1/CD provides a potential site for c-Src SH2 binding. To determine whether the c-Src SH2 domain binds to phosphorylated MUC1/CD, we incubated MUC1/CD with c-Src and ATP and then assessed binding to GST-Src SH2. The results demonstrate that GST-Src SH2 associates with phosphorylated but not unphosphorylated MUC1/CD (Fig. 2 D). Moreover, compared with MUC1/CD, there was substantially less binding of GST-Src SH2 to the MUC1/CD(Y46F) mutant that had been incubated with c-Src and ATP (Fig. 2 D). These results support c-Src-mediated phosphorylation of MUC1/CD and thereby a direct interaction of phosphorylated MUC1/CD with the c-Src SH2 domain. As the c-Src phosphorylation site on MUC1/CD resides next to the binding and phosphorylation site for GSK3β (17Li Y. Bharti A. Chen D. Gong J. Kufe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7216-7224Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), we asked if the interaction of MUC1/CD with c-Src affects that with GSK3β. GST-MUC1/CD was incubated with c-Src and ATP before addition of GSK3β. Analysis of proteins precipitated with glutathione beads demonstrated that c-Src-mediated phosphorylation of MUC1/CD is associated with a decrease in binding of MUC1/CD and GSK3β (Fig.3 A). To assess the effects of c-Src on the interaction of MUC1/CD and GSK3β in vivo, ZR-75-1 cells were transfected to express the empty vector or c-Src. Anti-MUC1 immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-GSK3β. The results demonstrate that c-Src also decreases the interaction of MUC1 and GSK3β in vivo (Fig.3 B). These findings indicate that GSK3β interacts with MUC1/CD by a c-Src-dependent mechanism. Phosphorylation of MUC1 by GSK3β decreases binding of MUC1 to β-catenin in vitro and in cells (17Li Y. Bharti A. Chen D. Gong J. Kufe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7216-7224Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). To determine whether c-Src-mediated phosphorylation of MUC1 affects the interaction of MUC1 with β-catenin, we incubated MUC1/CD with c-Src and ATP. Phosphorylated and unphosphorylated MUC1/CD were then incubated with GST or GST-β-catenin. Similar studies were performed with the MUC1/CD(Y46F) mutant. Analysis of proteins bound to glutathione beads by immunoblotting with anti-MUC1/CD demonstrated that c-Src-mediated phosphorylation of MUC1/CD increases binding of MUC1/CD to GST-β-catenin (Fig. 4 A). By contrast, there was no detectable binding of phosphorylated or unphosphorylated MUC1/CD to GST (Fig. 4 A). Studies performed with MUC1/CD(Y46F) demonstrated that c-Src-dependent phosphorylation of the YEKV site on MUC1/CD is necessary for the formation of MUC1/CD-β-catenin complexes (Fig. 4 A). To assess whether c-Src affects the interaction of MUC1 and β-cateninin vivo, MUC1-positive ZR-75-1 cells were transfected with pCMV or pCMV/c-Src. Anti-MUC1 immunoprecipitates prepared from the transfected cells were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-c-Src, anti-P-Tyr, and anti-β-catenin. The results demonstrate that c-Src associates with MUC1 in cells and induces tyrosine phosphorylation of MUC1 (Fig. 4 B, left panel). In addition, c-Src expression induced the interaction of MUC1 and β-catenin (Fig. 4 B, left panel). The finding that the MUC1 C-terminal subunit and not the large ectodomain is subject to tyrosine phosphorylation is consistent with an interaction between c-Src and MUC1/CD (Fig. 4 B, left panel). To confirm these findings, we performed immunoprecipitation studies with the anti-DF3-E antibody that was generated against the extracellular region of the C-terminal subunit. Immunoblot analysis of the precipitates demonstrated c-Src-mediated phosphorylation of the MUC1 C-terminal subunit and increased binding of MUC1/CD to β-catenin (Fig. 4 B, middle panel). By contrast, expression of a kinase-inactive c-Src(K295R) mutant resulted in less phosphorylation of MUC1 on tyrosine as compared with the control (Fig.4 B, middle panel). Moreover, expression of c-Src(K295R) was associated with a decreased interaction between MUC1/CD and β-catenin (Fig. 4 B, middle panel). To extend these findings, MUC1-negative 293 cells (17Li Y. Bharti A. Chen D. Gong J. Kufe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7216-7224Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) were transfected to express MUC1 or MUC1(Y46F) in which the CD YEKV site has been mutated to FEKV. There was a low but detectable level of MUC1 binding to endogenous c-Src (Fig. 4 C, left panel). Moreover, cotransfection of MUC1 and c-Src was associated with increased formation of MUC1-c-Src complexes (Fig. 4 C,middle panel). Cotransfection of MUC1 and c-Src was also associated with increased tyrosine phosphorylation of MUC1 and binding of MUC1 and c-Src (Fig. 4 C, middle panel). By contrast, cotransfection of MUC1(Y46F) and c-Src resulted in little binding of these proteins (Fig. 4 C, middle panel). Moreover, there was little if any tyrosine phosphorylation of MUC1(Y46F) (Fig. 4 C, middle panel). Importantly, cotransfection of MUC1 but not MUC1(Y46F) with c-Src induced the binding of MUC1 and β-catenin (Fig. 4 C,middle panel). These findings demonstrate that c-Src-mediated phosphorylation of the MUC1 YEKV site increases the interaction of MUC1 and β-catenin in cells. The present findings thus demonstrate that signaling of β-catenin and the MUC1 carcinoma-associated protein is regulated by the c-Src tyrosine kinase. Previous studies have shown that β-catenin interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of MUC1 and that GSK3β inhibits the formation of MUC1/CD-β-catenin complexes (17Li Y. Bharti A. Chen D. Gong J. Kufe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7216-7224Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). By contrast, the present work supports a model in which c-Src phosphorylates MUC1/CD and promotes the interaction of MUC1/CD and β-catenin. The c-Src kinase functions in signaling pathways activated by heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptors (28Malarkey K. Belham C. Paul A. Graham A. Mclees A. Scott P. Plevin R. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 361-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) and neuronal ion channels (29Holmes T. Fadool D. Levitan I. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 581-590Crossref Google Scholar, 30Yu S. Yeh C.

J. 1997; 326: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). c-Src also participates in the transduction of signals from the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGF-R) and other receptor tyrosine kinases (32Biscardi J. Tice D. Parsons S. Adv. Cancer Res. 1999; 76: 61-119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The available evidence indicates that c-Src phosphorylates the EGF-R and thereby contributes to mitogenesis and transformation (33Maa M. Leu T. McCarley D. Schatzman R. Parsons S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6981-6985Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Mitogenesis induced by PDGF is also positively regulated by c-Src-mediated phosphorylation of the PDGF-R (34Hansen K. Johnell M. Siegbahn A. Rorsman C. Engstrom U. Wernstedt C. Heldin C. Ronnstrand L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5299-5313Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Other substrates of c-Src that include focal adhesion kinase, p130Cas, and cortactin have functional associations with the actin cytoskeleton (32Biscardi J. Tice D. Parsons S. Adv. Cancer Res. 1999; 76: 61-119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings have collectively provided support for the involvement of c-Src in the integration of mitogenic, cell adhesion, and cytoskeletal responses. The present studies extend these findings by demonstrating that the MUC1 carcinoma-associated antigen is also a substrate for c-Src and that interaction of MUC1 with GSK3β and β-catenin are regulated by c-Src-dependent signals.

Here we show that the polymerization of these FtsZ filaments most closely resembles noncooperative (or “isodesmic”) assembly; the polymers are single-stranded and assemble with no evidence of a nucleation phase and without a critical concentration. We have developed a model for the isodesmic polymerization that includes GTP hydrolysis in the scheme. The model can account for the lengths of the FtsZ polymers and their maximum steady state nucleotide hydrolysis rates. It predicts that unlike microtubules, FtsZ protofilaments consist of GTP-bound FtsZ subunits that hydrolyze their nucleotide only slowly and are connected by high affinity longitudinal bonds with a nanomolarK D.

InEscherichia coli, FtsZ assembles into a ring at the center of the cell just inside the inner membrane. This Z ring assembles early in the cell cycle, after which other proteins necessary for cell division are recruited to it. During cytokinesis, the Z ring contracts and disassembles. If the structure, timing, or localization of Z ring assembly is disrupted, cell division can fail or become aberrant. It is not yet clear how Z ring assembly is controlled; some properties of ring formation may derive from the inherent self-assembly characteristics of FtsZ, whereas others may require regulation or modification by additional factors in the cell. FtsZ and tubulin are homologs that share identical folds (4Nogales E. Downing K.H. Amos L.A. Lowe J. Nat. Struct. Biol... 1998; 5: 451-458Google Scholar) and assemble into polymers with many of the same properties. Like tubulin, FtsZ polymerizes in the presence of GTP (5Mukherjee A. Lutkenhaus J. J.

The longitudinal bonds that connect the subunits in a tubulin protofilament are understood at atomic resolution, and the bonds between subunits in an FtsZ protofilament are likely to be very similar (9Nogales E. Wolf S.G. Downing K.H. Nature.. 1998; 391: 199-203Google Scholar). Residues on both sides of the longitudinal protein interface are conserved, and the GTP binds to one side of the interface and is necessary for formation of a protofilament. In return, hydrolysis of the GTP occurs only after formation of the longitudinal bond, when residues from the adjoining subunit contact the nucleotide (4Nogales E. Downing K.H. Amos L.A. Lowe J. Nat. Struct. Biol... 1998; 5: 451-458Google Scholar). GTP hydrolysis causes both FtsZ and tubulin filaments to adopt a curved conformation (7Erickson H.P. Taylor D.W. Taylor K.A. Bramhill D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1996; 93: 519-523Google Scholar, 10Lu C.L. Reedy M. Erickson H.P. J. Bacteriol... 2000; 182: 164-170Google Scholar) and become more labile (11Mukherjee A. Lutkenhaus J. EMBO J... 1998; 17: 462-469Google Scholar). Curved GDP-FtsZ filaments have been visualized when stabilized by various polycations and are half the diameter of GDP-tubulin rings, indicating that the angle of curvature between GDP-FtsZ subunits is the same as that between the αβ heterodimers in tubulin rings (12Erickson H.P. Stoffler D. J. Cell Biol... 1996; 135: 5-8Google Scholar). For both proteins, assembly with GDP requires magnesium and is relatively weak (K D = 20–50 μm (13Frigon R.P. Timasheff S.N. Biochemistry.. 1975; 14: 4559-4566Google Scholar, 14Rivas G. Lopez A. Mingorance J. Ferrandiz M.J. Zorrilla S. Minton A.P. Vicente M. Andreu J.M. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 11740-11749Google Scholar)). In contrast to the conserved longitudinal contacts within tubulin and FtsZ protofilaments, the lateral contacts between protofilaments in a microtubule wall involve protein surfaces that are not conserved in FtsZ (4Nogales E. Downing K.H. Amos L.A. Lowe J. Nat. Struct. Biol... 1998; 5: 451-458Google Scholar). Because FtsZ polymers have not yet been visualized with high resolution in vivo, it is not known how the protofilaments in the Z ring are associated. Under many conditions in vitro, GTP induces FtsZ to form individual 5-nm-wide polymers that are stable without additional lateral interactions (5Mukherjee A. Lutkenhaus J. J. Bacteriol... 1994; 176: 2754-2758Google Scholar, 10Lu C.L. Reedy M. Erickson H.P. J. Bacteriol... 2000; 182: 164-170Google Scholar, 11Mukherjee A. Lutkenhaus J.

Nonetheless, even these thin FtsZ polymers could consist of two protofilaments joined along the narrowest 3 nm axis of the protein, and there is a precedent for such a 6 nm double filament forming in the presence of Ca2+ (8Löwe J. Amos L.A. EMBO J... 1999; 18: 2364-2371Google Scholar). FtsZ can form several types of lateral bonds when exogenous cations are added, resulting in a variety of paired protofilaments, bundles, double layered sheets, and tubes (6Bramhill D. Thompson C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1994; 91: 5813-5817Google Scholar, 7Erickson H.P. Taylor D.W. Taylor K.A. Bramhill D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1996; 93: 519-523Google Scholar, 8Löwe J.

EMBO J... 1997; 16: 5455-5463Google Scholar). For tubulin, aberrant lateral bonds can result in the formation of zinc sheets (17Baker T.S. Amos L.A. J. Mol. Biol... 1978; 123: 89-106Google Scholar) and hooked and S-shaped polymers (18Himes R.H. Burton P.R. Gaito J.M. J. Biol. Chem... 1977; 252: 6222-6228Google Scholar). It is unclear for FtsZ whether any of the lateral contacts that formin vitro are relevant in vivo. Polymers that are multistranded assemble cooperatively (19Oosawa F. Kasai M. J. Mol. Biol... 1962; 4: 10-21Google Scholar). Cooperative assembly has three distinctive characteristics (see Fig.1 A) as follows: there is a critical concentration for assembly; there are kinetic lags in polymerization at low protein concentrations; and at equilibrium, subunits are distributed into two distinct populations, monomers and very long polymers. These properties derive from the two different phases of assembly, an unfavorable nucleation phase followed by a more favorable growth phase. Nucleation is unfavorable because individual bonds between monomers are weak, and therefore initiation of the polymer is difficult. However, once a stable nucleus has assembled, each new subunit can form multiple bonds to the growing polymer. Subunit addition becomes favorable and polymer growth rapid. The critical concentration is the minimum protein concentration at which any polymer forms; at all concentrations above this, subunits assemble until the concentration of monomer left in solution has fallen to the critical concentration. Most biological polymers are multistranded and assemble cooperatively with the properties described above. Cooperative polymers such as actin and microtubules may be common because they form filaments that are strong in the middle but can easily be remodeled by removing subunits from their ends (20Erickson H.P. J. Mol. Biol... 1989; 206: 465-474Google Scholar). In addition, a cell can use cooperative assembly to control its spatial organization by localizing polymer nucleation sites and assembling long filaments that can span the cytoplasm. In contrast to multistranded polymers, single-stranded polymers can be assembled with an identical bond at each step of polymerization (21Adams Jr., E.T. Lewis M.S. Biochemistry.. 1968; 7: 1044-1053Google Scholar,22Reisler E. Pouyet J. Eisenberg H. Biochemistry.. 1970; 9: 3095-3102Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1 B). For such isodesmic polymers, there is no separate nucleation and growth phase, and so there is no lag in the assembly kinetics. Instead, assembly is rapid because every monomer in solution can act as a start site for polymer growth. There is also no critical concentration for assembly, and as the total protein concentration rises, both polymer and monomer populations can increase simultaneously. Finally, fragmentation of a single-stranded polymer in the middle requires breaking only a single bond. Disassembly thus occurs not only at the ends of the polymers but also along their length, and isodesmic polymers remain relatively short. Single-stranded, isodesmic polymers are less common in biology than cooperative, multistranded polymers, and none so far has been shown to be the major form of a protein in vivo. Isodesmic assembly was first analyzed by studying β-lactoglobulin (21Adams Jr., E.T. Lewis M.S. Biochemistry.. 1968; 7: 1044-1053Google Scholar) and glutamate dehydrogenase (22Reisler E. Pouyet J. Eisenberg H. Biochemistry.. 1970; 9: 3095-3102Google Scholar), but both these proteins function in vivoas monomers. The Drosophila septins can assemble in vitro both isodesmically, forming short, single-stranded polymers (23Field C.M. Al-Awar O. Rosenblatt J. Wong M.L. Alberts B. Mitchison T.J. J. Cell Biol... 1996; 133: 605-616Google Scholar), and cooperatively, forming multistranded filaments, 1M. Glotzer, personal communication.1M. Glotzer, personal communication. depending on which subunits are combined. Relevant to the present study, tubulin-GDP can assemble isodesmically into single, curved protofilaments that eventually close to form tubulin rings (13Frigon R.P. Timasheff S.N. Biochemistry.. 1975; 14: 4559-4566Google Scholar). Similarly, GDP-FtsZ assembly is noncooperative and deviates only slightly from isodesmic polymerization (14Rivas G. Lopez A. Mingorance J. Ferrandiz M.J. Zorrilla S. Minton A.P. Vicente M. Andreu J.M. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 11740-11749Google Scholar). The two basic mechanisms of assembly described above are often complicated by nucleotide hydrolysis or conformational changes within a subunit. In actin and tubulin, these complications lead to phenomena such as treadmilling and dynamic instability (24Erickson H.P. O'Brien E.T. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Struct. Biol... 1992; 21: 145-166Google Scholar, 25Desai A. Mitchison T.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol... 1997; 13: 83-117Google Scholar). Prion fiber assembly also shows characteristics that do not fall neatly into either mechanism described above. Prion assembly shows lag phases that are concentration-independent, and monomer, small oligomer, and polymer coexist in assembly reactions (26Serio T.R. Cashikar A.G. Kowal A.S. Sawicki G.J. Moslehi J.J. Serpell L. Arnsdorf M.F. Lindquist S.L. Science.. 2000; 289: 1317-1321Google Scholar). A conformational change is thought to be necessary to activate the prion protein before it can assemble into multistranded fibers, and preformed fibers may accelerate the rate of this conformational change. For FtsZ, cycles of GTP hydrolysis and conformational changes in the subunit may also introduce complexities into its polymerization mechanism. The straight 5-nm-wide FtsZ polymers that form in GTP are probably the building blocks of any larger structure that forms in vivo. In the cell, controlled nucleation followed by favorable growth would be an economic explanation of the FtsZ's tight localization and its ability to span the 3-μm circumference of an E. coli cell. However, if FtsZ polymers have the structure of an isolated tubulin protofilament, they would be single-stranded and would be expected to show isodesmic assembly. Our goal was to determine whether the assembly of these protofilaments occurs via isodesmic or cooperative assembly. Therefore, we determined whether these filaments are in fact single-stranded, whether there is a concentration-dependent lag phase during assembly indicative of nucleation, and whether there is a critical concentration for assembly. We found that unlike microtubules, the assembly of these FtsZ-GTP protofilaments appears isodesmic. E. coli FtsZ was overexpressed from a pET11b vector (Novagen) and purified largely as in Lu et al. (27Lu C. Stricker J. Erickson H.P. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton.. 1998; 40: 71-86Google Scholar) with a few modifications. Cells were grown in 500 ml of LB at 37 °C to A 600 = 1, induced with 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and grown for an additional 2 h. Cells were sedimented and resuspended in 10 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride and frozen at −80 °C. Cells were thawed, and lysozyme was added to 0.1 mg/ml and incubated for 10 min, and magnesium acetate was added to 10 mm. Cells were sonicated, and DNase was added to 10 μg/ml, and the extract was incubated for 1 h. Lysate was spun for 30 min at 220,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant was mixed with 0.25 volume saturated (room temperature) ammonium sulfate, incubated on ice for 20 min and spun at 80,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed, and 1/12 volume ammonium sulfate was added. This was spun again at 80,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of polymerization buffer (50 mmNaMES,2 pH 6.5, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm EGTA) and spun again at 160,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The final supernatant was brought to 10% glycerol and 50 μm GDP, aliquoted, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Protein concentrations were measured using the BCA assay (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard, calibrated for the 0.75 color ratio of FtsZ/bovine serum albumin (27Lu C. Stricker J. Erickson H.P. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton.. 1998; 40: 71-86Google Scholar). All assembly reactions were carried out in the above polymerization buffer (50 mm NaMES, pH 6.5, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm EGTA). Reactions were supplemented with magnesium acetate so that the total magnesium concentration was 2 mmin excess of any nucleotide. Assembly reactions were performed at room temperature unless otherwise indicated. On the day the protein was to be assayed, the FtsZ was put through a cycle of calcium-aided assembly and disassembly (based on Ref. 16Yu X.C. Margolin W. EMBO J... 1997; 16: 5455-5463Google Scholar) to select for active, nonaggregated protein. Thawed protein was prespun in a TLA100 rotor for 15 min at 350,000 ×g at 4 °C. The protein was then diluted 5-fold in polymerization buffer to lower the glycerol concentration (final protein concentration ∼1 mg/ml) and brought to 10 mmCaCl2 and 2 mm GTP. After incubation for 3 min at room temperature, polymer was sedimented for 15 min at 350,000 × g at 20 °C. The pellet was resuspended well in polymerization buffer and incubated on ice for 30 min. A final spin (15 min, 350,000 × g, 4 °C) removed any remaining aggregated protein. Negative stain electron microscopy was used to visualize FtsZ filaments. Carbon-coated copper grids (400 mesh, Electron Microscopy Sciences) were glow discharged for 5 s before use. For some assays, before applying the FtsZ a drop of 0.2 mg/ml cytochrome c was pipetted onto the carbon, incubated for 30 s, and then blotted with filter paper. This procedure aided good staining at low FtsZ concentrations but did not visibly affect filament number or length. Cycled protein was diluted to the desired concentration in polymerization buffer and nucleotide was added, and the reaction was incubated for several minutes at room temperature. A drop of FtsZ solution was then applied to the carbon and incubated for 10 s before the excess was blotted. The grid was immediately rinsed with 3–4 drops 2% uranyl acetate, blotted, and air-dried. Filaments were visualized and photographed using a Phillips 301 electron microscope at × 50,000 magnification. For length determinations, 0.75–3.5 μm FtsZ was assembled with either 2 mm GTP or 0.5 mm GMPCPP and visualized by negative stain. Image quality improved significantly at the higher protein concentrations, although overlapping filaments made lengths more difficult to measure above 2 μm FtsZ. Three fields on a grid were photographed from 10 different reactions with each nucleotide. The negatives were scanned into a computer at 600 dpi. Filaments were traced using NIH image, and the length distributions for a given grid were pooled and plotted. The polymer length distributions were largely exponential. However, because the shortest polymers were more likely to be obscured in the noise of an image or overlooked during measurement, the frequency of observing these polymers was lower than expected for an exponential distribution. The peak polymer length correlated with image quality, with the best images showing exponential length distributions down to 8 subunits (32 nm). To avoid biasing the average filament length because of incomplete counting of short filaments, the average filament length for each grid was mathematically calculated from an exponential fitting to the data, and only data from filaments that were longer than 25 subunits were included in the fittings. Changing the cut-off from 25 to 50 subunits did not alter the best fit curve. Because the average length did not change significantly between the FtsZ concentrations tested, the data from all experiments were pooled to determine the final average length reported for each nucleotide. A malachite green-sodium molybdate assay was used to measure production of inorganic phosphate (28Geladopoulos T.P. Sotiroudis T.G. Evangelopoulos A.E. Anal. Biochem... 1991; 192: 112-116Google Scholar). Protein was diluted to the desired concentration in polymerization buffer at room temperature, and GTP was added to initiate the reaction. At four time intervals, reactions were stopped by addition of a 1× volume of cold 0.6 m perchloric acid. The samples were stored on ice until all time points were collected, at which time a 2× volume of filtered malachite green solution (0.15 g of malachite green, 1 g of sodium molybdate, 0.25 g of Triton X-100 in 0.7 m HCl) was added. The samples were then incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and the A 650 was measured. NaPO4buffer was used to create a standard curve, and the reaction was normalized by including a control without FtsZ. FtsZ was assembled in polymerization buffer plus either 2 mm GTP/5 mm EDTA or 0.5 mm GMPCPP. A 3-μl sample of the reaction mix was injected into a drop of buffer on a thin (2–3 nm) carbon film supported by a thick holey film over a titanium grid to which tobacco mosaic virus had previously been applied as an internal standard. The grid was washed first 5 times with injection buffer, then 10 times with 20 mm ammonium acetate, blotted to a thin layer, plunged into liquid nitrogen slush, and freeze-dried overnight under vacuum before being transferred to the microscope. The grids were visualized using a custom built microscope (STEM1) at the Brookhaven National Laboratory. The microscope was operated in a dark field mode in which annular detectors collect nearly all the scattered electrons. Because the FtsZ filaments were radiation-sensitive, it was necessary to keep the electron dose low to have meaningful measurements. With a high dose, the mass/length measurements could be lower by 50% (data not shown). However, at lower doses, results became reproducible. Areas with relatively clean backgrounds and an adequate number of filaments were chosen for analysis. A digital image was saved consisting of 512 × 512 pixels, each of which shows the number of scattered electrons, which is directly proportional to the mass thickness in that pixel. Relatively straight, short (usually ∼30 nm) segments were chosen along a filament for mass measurements. Because there were significant numbers of unpolymerized molecules in the background, it was necessary to mask these molecules before the background was computed and subtracted from the intensity summed over the filaments. The microscope calibration factor was checked against that of tobacco mosaic virus, and the summed intensities (minus the background) multiplied by the calibration factor gave the mass values for the specimen. Cycled FtsZ was diluted to the desired concentration in polymerization buffer and introduced into a quartz cuvette in a FluoroMax fluorimeter with a custom-made temperature-controlled cuvette holder. The cuvette was illuminated with 310 nm light, and the 90° light scattering was detected. The slit widths were set at 0.5 mm and the signal was integrated once a second. A base line of scattering for the unpolymerized protein was established and then polymerization was initiated by the addition of 1 mm GTP or GDP or 0.25 mm GMPCPP. The nucleotide was introduced into the solution on the end of a custom-made plunger that fit snugly into the cuvette with a 1-mm clearance around all sides. The plunger was inserted into the cuvette and rapidly withdrawn to mix the contents. Typical dead times were 2–3 s. The noise in the signal increased when using this plunger due to small bubbles coming out of solution as the plunger was rapidly withdrawn. Pre-cycled protein was diluted to the desired concentrations with polymerization buffer. GTP was added to a final concentration of 5–10 mm, GDP to 2 mm, or GMPCPP to 0.5 mm, along with additional magnesium acetate so that there was a 2 mm excess of magnesium over nucleotide. 75 μl of each reaction was added to a polycarbonate tube and centrifuged in the TLA100 rotor in a TL100 ultracentrifuge (Beckman) for 15 min at 350,000 × g at 20 °C. Removing the entire supernatant and assaying the supernatant and pellet gave poorly reproducible results, so we removed and assayed only the upper two-thirds of the supernatant, leaving the pellet undisturbed. The upper 50 μl of supernatant was immediately removed from the tube, and the concentration of protein in the original sample and the supernatant were measured. To limit GTP depletion and diffusion of the pellet from the tube walls after sedimentation, no more than seven reactions were sedimented simultaneously to reduce the handling time. Results were identical using 5 or 10 mm GTP, confirming that the nucleotide is not being significantly depleted during the 25 min required to complete an assay. Each protein concentration was tested 2–4 times per experiment, and 2–4 separate experiments were combined and averaged to obtain accurate data. To calibrate the assay, seven proteins with known S values between 4.5 and 30 were sedimented in the same manner. The resulting curve was linear up to 19 S, at which point 94% of the protein sedimented. The resulting standard curve indicated that the percent protein sedimented = 3.6 × 10−3 + 4.9 × 10−2·S (R = 0.97). FtsZ monomers are 3.4 S (14Rivas G. Lopez A. Mingorance J. Ferrandiz M.J. Zorrilla S. Minton A.P. Vicente M. Andreu J.M. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 11740-11749Google Scholar), and the expected S values of single-stranded FtsZ polymers of a given length were calculated from the theory of Kirkwood (29Kirkwood J.G. J. Polymer Sci... 1954; 12: 1-14Google Scholar). The above calculations predict that 85% of a 3.4 S FtsZ monomer should remain in the supernatant after centrifugation; 5-mers, which should be 8 S, would be 40% sedimented, and 40-subunit filaments, which should be 14.5 S, would be 70% sedimented. The theory of isodesmic polymer assembly at equilibrium can be used to predict an apparent association constant for assembly of FtsZ into protofilaments. Here we have extended this theory to include a step of GTP hydrolysis followed by rapid subunit dissociation. The modified theory fits the observed maximum hydrolysis rates and length distributions of FtsZ and allows the prediction of a true association constant for the addition of GTP subunits. The average length of an isodesmic filament is determined by the affinity constant for assembly and the total protein concentration. To use length measurements to estimate an apparent affinity constant for GTP- and GMPCPP-FtsZ polymerization, we derived the following Equations Equation 1, Equation 2, Equation 3, Equation 4, based on previous models for isodesmic assembly (19Oosawa F. Kasai M. J. Mol. Biol... 1962; 4: 10-21Google Scholar, 22Reisler E. Pouyet J. Eisenberg H. Biochemistry.. 1970; 9: 3095-3102Google Scholar, 30Thusius D. Dessen P. Jallon J.M. J. Mol.

These equations are the same as those found in Oosawa and Kasai (19Oosawa F. Kasai M. J. Mol. Biol... 1962; 4: 10-21Google Scholar), except that K A is multiplied by a factor of 2 because the i + 1 subunit can be added to either end of a growing polymer.C1=4KACt+1−(8KACt+1)1/28KA2CtEquation 3 Equation 3 is the quadratic solution of Equation 2,Ln=ΣiCiΣCi=4KACt−1+8KACf+1Equation 4 Equation 4 is the number average length of the polymers (L n). At total FtsZ concentrations of ∼2 μm, the average lengths of GTP and GMPCPP filaments were 23 and 38 subunits, respectively. According to Eq. 4, the apparent affinities needed to produce filaments of such lengths areK A, app = 1.25 × 108and 3.3 × 108m−1, corresponding to dissociation constants of 8 and 3 nm. These apparent affinity constants underestimate the actual affinity at a GTP-FtsZ interface because in addition to dissociation of GTP-bound FtsZ subunits, filaments fragment due to GTP hydrolysis, as described below. The following polymerization Model 1 accounts for the on-off reactions of subunits in both the GTP and GDP states, and the rate of GTP hydrolysis (see also Fig. 7, which will be addressed under “Discussion”): FT = FtsZ bound to GTP; FD = FtsZ bound to GDP; and F = another subunit of any nucleotide state. The rates are assumed to be identical whether monomers or the ends of long polymers are interacting. In reality, the entropy and diffusion of long polymers will be different from that of monomers, but these deviations from isodesmic assembly are likely to be less than 2-fold, as was found by Rivas et al. (14Rivas G. Lopez A. Mingorance J. Ferrandiz M.J. Zorrilla S. Minton A.P. Vicente M. Andreu J.M. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 11740-11749Google Scholar). The association of protein subunits was assumed to be diffusion-limited (k on ≈ 5 × 106m−1 s−1) (31Northrup S.H. Erickson H.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1992; 89: 3338-3342Google Scholar) for both GTP and GDP-FtsZ. Nucleotide exchange is likely to be very rapid (k nucleotide ≈ 35/s), based on the 7 μm K D of GDP for FtsZ monomer (32Mukherjee A. Dai K. Lutkenhaus J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1993; 90: 1053-1057Google Scholar) and a diffusion-limited on rate for nucleotide binding (≈5 × 106). Dissociation of GDP-FtsZ is also likely to be very rapid; with a diffusion-limited k on(GDP-FtsZ) and a K D = 20 μm (14Rivas G. Lopez A. Mingorance J. Ferrandiz M.J. Zorrilla S. Minton A.P. Vicente M. Andreu J.M. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 11740-11749Google Scholar),k off(GDP-FtsZ) would be 100/s. In contrast to the rapid dissociation at a GDP-FtsZ interface, the dissociation at a GTP-FtsZ interface would be slow, giving rise to the stability of the protofilaments. The 3 nm apparent affinity constant calculated for GMPCPP filaments can be used as a first approximation for the affinity at GTP-FtsZ interfaces. A diffusion-limited on rate then predictsk off(GTP-FtsZ) = 0.014/s. The GTP hydrolysis rate can be shown to be on the same order as this dissociation rate of GTP-FtsZ. The overall nucleotide turnover rates are known from experimental measurements (in the present study 1.5/min or 0.025/s for GTP, 0.23/min or 0.0038/s for GMPCPP). The model assumes that hydrolysis occurs only after subunit association, and that all subunits in the polymer hydrolyze GTP at a rate characterized by the first order rate constant k hydrolysis. At high protein concentrations, these overall turnover rates are valid estimates of k hydrolysis. This is because subunit association is no longer rate-limiting, and there is only a small fraction protein that is either monomer or at a polymer end and so not contributing to the turnover rate. We postulate that the subunits in the protofilaments are largely bound to GTP and that the K A, app estimated above is determined by three parameters.k on(GTP-FtsZ) gives the rate of addition of GTP subunits (or annealing of polymers with GTP at their ends).

Since peroxynitrite readily reacts with transition metal centers, we assessed the role of the manganese ion in the reaction between peroxynitrite and Mn-SOD. Peroxynitrite reacts with human recombinant and Escherichia coli Mn-SOD with a second order rate constant of 1.0 ± 0.2 × 105 and 1.4 ± 0.2 × 105m−1s−1 at pH 7.47 and 37 °C, respectively. TheE. coli apoenzyme, obtained by removing the manganese ion from the active site, presents a rate constant <104m−1 s−1for the reaction with peroxynitrite, whereas that of the manganese-reconstituted apoenzyme (apo/Mn) was comparable to that of the holoenzyme. Peroxynitrite-dependent nitration of 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid was increased 21% by Mn-SOD. The apo/Mn also promoted nitration, but the apo and the zinc-substituted apoenzyme (apo/Zn) enzymes did not. The extent of tyrosine nitration in the enzyme was also affected by the presence and nature (i.e.manganese or zinc) of the metal center in the active site. For comparative purposes, we also studied the reaction of peroxynitrite with low molecular weight complexes of manganese and zinc with tetrakis-(4-benzoic acid) porphyrin (tbap). Mn(tbap) reacts with peroxynitrite with a rate constant of 6.8 ± 0.1 × 104m−1s−1 and maximally increases nitration yields by 350%. Zn(tbap), on the other hand, affords protection against nitration. Our results indicate that the manganese ion in Mn-SOD plays an important role in the decomposition kinetics of peroxynitrite and in peroxynitrite-dependent nitration of self and remote tyrosine residues.

In the case of transition metal-containing compounds, such as metalloproteins and Mn-porphyrin SOD mimetics, higher nitration yields are obtained (29Beckman J.S. Ischiropoulos H.

These facts led us to consider that the manganese-ion should play an important role in the reaction of peroxynitrite with Mn-SOD. In addition, manganese may facilitate the formation of nitrating species at the active site, which could react with the critical tyrosine 34.In this work, we have studied the role of the manganese metal center in the decomposition kinetics of peroxynitrite and in peroxynitrite-dependent nitration of the enzyme and non-protein aromatic residues. These studies shed light on the nature of peroxynitrite reaction with Mn-SOD and provide further rationale to account for the toxic actions that peroxynitrite may promote in vivo.DISCUSSIONPeroxynitrite reacts with human recombinant and E. coliMn-SOD in a direct reaction with second order rate constants of 1.0 ± 0.2 × 105 and 1.4 ± 0.2 × 105m−1s−1 at pH 7.47 and 37 °C, respectively. The rate constant for the reaction with the E. coli apoenzyme was at least 1 order of magnitude smaller, whereas that of the apo/Mn was comparable with that of the holoenzyme, confirming that the reaction between Mn-SOD and peroxynitrite largely depends on the presence of the metal in the active site. The reactions of peroxynitrite with metalloproteins are typically fast; therefore, these are likely to be major targets in vivo. In this context, the reactivity of peroxynitrite with Mn-SOD is similar to that previously reported for mitochondrial aconitase (47Castro L. Rodriguez M. Radi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29409-29415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cytochromec 2+ (48Thomson L. Trujillo M. Telleri R. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), alcohol dehydrogenase (46Crow J.P. Beckman J.S. McCord J.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3544-3552Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), and peroxidases (49Floris R. Piersma S.R. Yang G. Jones P. Wever R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 767-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar).The surprisingly high rate constant determined for the reaction between peroxynitrite and the zinc-substituted apoenzyme suggested that the decomposition kinetics of peroxynitrite could also be affected by the nonredox metal zinc (53Christianson D.W. Cox J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 33-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Indeed, kinetic rate determinations for the reaction of peroxynitrite with Mn(tbap) and Zn(tbap), revealed that the zinc-substituted porphyrin reacts with peroxynitrite faster than its manganese counterpart. The decomposition of peroxynitrite in the presence of Mn-SOD and Mn(tbap) is attributed to a redox reaction which involves the oxidation of the metal ion (34Ferrer-Sueta G. Batinić-Haberle I. Spasojević I. Fridovich I. Radi R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1999; 12: 442-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 54Groves J.T. Sudhakar S.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 9578-9579Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar). However, in the presence of the zinc-substituted apoenzyme or Zn(tbap), peroxynitrite decomposition must proceed through a different pathway that may involve the utilization of the zinc ion as a Lewis acid.Peroxynitrite reaction with Mn-SOD leads to the formation of nitrating species, capable of modifying low molecular weight aromatic compounds in a manganese-dependent process (Fig. 5). In addition, and as reported for the human recombinant Mn-SOD (23MacMillan-Crow L.A. Crow J.P. Thompson J.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1613-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 24Yamakura F. Taka H. Fujimura T. Murayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14085-14089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), peroxynitrite promoted the inactivation of the E. coli enzyme mainly by the nitration of one tyrosine residue. While in the apoenzyme peroxynitrite-derived hydroxyl radical and nitrogen dioxide-mediated tyrosine nitration, the manganese ion played an important role in tyrosine nitration in the holoenzyme (Fig. 3). The nitrating species could be either a nitronium ion (NO2+) bound to the metal (29Beckman J.S. Ischiropoulos H. Zhu L. van der Woerd M. Smith C. Chen J. Harrison J. Martin J.C. Tsai M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 438-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar, 55Ischiropoulos H. Zhu L. Chen J. Tsai M. Martin J.C. Smith C.D. Beckman J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (1420) Google Scholar) or an oxo-manganese complex plus nitrogen dioxide (34Ferrer-Sueta G. Batinić-Haberle I. Spasojević I. Fridovich I. Radi R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1999; 12: 442-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 54Groves J.T. Sudhakar S.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 9578-9579Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the kinetic traces of peroxynitrite decomposition in the presence of Mn-SOD do not fit single exponential kinetics indicating that the enzyme is being consumed in the reaction with peroxynitrite, so even though it enhances nitration yields, it is not a true catalyst. In all, metal cofactors prone to undergo redox transitions, such as manganese, iron, or copper, are likely to promote site-specific nitration of protein aromatic residues; this idea is consistent with previous data on prostacyclin synthase and Cu,Zn-SOD as well (55Ischiropoulos H. Zhu L. Chen J. Tsai M. Martin J.C. Smith C.D. Beckman J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (1420) Google Scholar, 56Zou M.H. Ullrich V. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 57Zou M. Martin C. Ullrich V. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1997; 378: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar).E. coli Mn-SOD tyrosine residues have different degrees of solvent accessibility, as revealed by the analysis of the native structure using the Swiss PDB Viewer program. Tyrosine 34 is less accessible to the solvent than Tyr-2, Tyr-9, and Tyr-11 and equally accessible as Tyr-173, Tyr-174, and Tyr-184, but tyrosine 34 is the residue located closest to the active site, only at 5 Å from the manganese ion. The attraction of peroxynitrite to the active site, probably by the basic residues in the channel entrance, and its reaction with the manganese ion leading to the formation of nitrating species provide a reasonable explanation to the fact that tyrosine 34 is the tyrosine residue most susceptible to nitration by peroxynitrite (23MacMillan-Crow L.A. Crow J.P. Thompson J.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1613-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 24Yamakura F. Taka H. Fujimura T. Murayama K. J. Biol.

Quijano, and R. Radi, unpublished data. as well as the enzyme molecular mass (88 kDa) and mitochondrial volume (1.2 μl/mg), a concentration of Mn-SOD inside the mitochondria of 20 ± 10 μm (80 μm subunits) was estimated. In concentrations similar to those found in the mitochondria, GSH protected Mn-SOD from nitration and inactivation both in the absence and presence of carbon dioxide (Fig. 8). These data underscore the role of GSH as a mitochondrial antioxidant and raise the question on the mechanism of nitration and inactivation of the enzyme in vivo. In this sense, Mn-SOD reported to copurify with QH2:cytocrome c reductase (complex III) (60Marres C.A.M. Van Loon A.P.G.M. Oudshoorn P. Van Steeg H. Grivel L.A. Slater E.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 147: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) may be partially associated to the sites of mitochondrial superoxide production, hence of peroxynitrite formation, constituting a preferential target for the oxidant.Since Mn-SOD is a critical mitochondrial antioxidant, its nitration represents a severe hazard that will promote oxidative damage and may ultimately signal cell death. Strategies directed to attenuate nitration of Mn-SOD tyrosine 34 should result in a better mitochondrial and cellular outcome under conditions of excess peroxynitrite formation. Manganese-superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) is the SOD isoform1found in the mitochondrial matrix of eukaryotes and in a variety of prokaryotes (1Weisiger R.A. Fridovich I. J. Biol.

Whereas the human mitochondrial enzyme is a homotetramer (∼88 kDa) (4Matsuda Y. Higashiyama S. Kijma Y. Suzuki Y. Kawano K. Akiyama M. Kawata S. Tarui S. Deutsch H.F. Taniguchi N. Eur. J.

In the case of H+, peroxynitrous acid (ONOOH) undergoes homolysis to hydroxyl radical and nitrogen dioxide with yields up to 30% (28Radi R. Denicola A. Alvarez B. Ferrer-Sueta G. Rubbo H.

These facts led us to consider that the manganese-ion should play an important role in the reaction of peroxynitrite with Mn-SOD. In addition, manganese may facilitate the formation of nitrating species at the active site, which could react with the critical tyrosine 34. In this work, we have studied the role of the manganese metal center in the decomposition kinetics of peroxynitrite and in peroxynitrite-dependent nitration of the enzyme and non-protein aromatic residues. These studies shed light on the nature of peroxynitrite reaction with Mn-SOD and provide further rationale to account for the toxic actions that peroxynitrite may promote in vivo. DISCUSSIONPeroxynitrite reacts with human recombinant and E. coliMn-SOD in a direct reaction with second order rate constants of 1.0 ± 0.2 × 105 and 1.4 ± 0.2 × 105m−1s−1 at pH 7.47 and 37 °C, respectively. The rate constant for the reaction with the E. coli apoenzyme was at least 1 order of magnitude smaller, whereas that of the apo/Mn was comparable with that of the holoenzyme, confirming that the reaction between Mn-SOD and peroxynitrite largely depends on the presence of the metal in the active site. The reactions of peroxynitrite with metalloproteins are typically fast; therefore, these are likely to be major targets in vivo. In this context, the reactivity of peroxynitrite with Mn-SOD is similar to that previously reported for mitochondrial aconitase (47Castro L. Rodriguez M. Radi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29409-29415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cytochromec 2+ (48Thomson L. Trujillo M. Telleri R. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), alcohol dehydrogenase (46Crow J.P. Beckman J.S. McCord J.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3544-3552Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), and peroxidases (49Floris R. Piersma S.R. Yang G. Jones P. Wever R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 767-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar).The surprisingly high rate constant determined for the reaction between peroxynitrite and the zinc-substituted apoenzyme suggested that the decomposition kinetics of peroxynitrite could also be affected by the nonredox metal zinc (53Christianson D.W. Cox J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 33-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Indeed, kinetic rate determinations for the reaction of peroxynitrite with Mn(tbap) and Zn(tbap), revealed that the zinc-substituted porphyrin reacts with peroxynitrite faster than its manganese counterpart. The decomposition of peroxynitrite in the presence of Mn-SOD and Mn(tbap) is attributed to a redox reaction which involves the oxidation of the metal ion (34Ferrer-Sueta G. Batinić-Haberle I. Spasojević I. Fridovich I. Radi R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1999; 12: 442-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 54Groves J.T. Sudhakar S.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 9578-9579Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar). However, in the presence of the zinc-substituted apoenzyme or Zn(tbap), peroxynitrite decomposition must proceed through a different pathway that may involve the utilization of the zinc ion as a Lewis acid.Peroxynitrite reaction with Mn-SOD leads to the formation of nitrating species, capable of modifying low molecular weight aromatic compounds in a manganese-dependent process (Fig. 5). In addition, and as reported for the human recombinant Mn-SOD (23MacMillan-Crow L.A. Crow J.P. Thompson J.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1613-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 24Yamakura F. Taka H. Fujimura T. Murayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14085-14089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), peroxynitrite promoted the inactivation of the E. coli enzyme mainly by the nitration of one tyrosine residue. While in the apoenzyme peroxynitrite-derived hydroxyl radical and nitrogen dioxide-mediated tyrosine nitration, the manganese ion played an important role in tyrosine nitration in the holoenzyme (Fig. 3). The nitrating species could be either a nitronium ion (NO2+) bound to the metal (29Beckman J.S. Ischiropoulos H. Zhu L. van der Woerd M. Smith C. Chen J. Harrison J. Martin J.C. Tsai M. Arch.

Nevertheless, the kinetic traces of peroxynitrite decomposition in the presence of Mn-SOD do not fit single exponential kinetics indicating that the enzyme is being consumed in the reaction with peroxynitrite, so even though it enhances nitration yields, it is not a true catalyst. In all, metal cofactors prone to undergo redox transitions, such as manganese, iron, or copper, are likely to promote site-specific nitration of protein aromatic residues; this idea is consistent with previous data on prostacyclin synthase and Cu,Zn-SOD as well (55Ischiropoulos H.

Tyrosine 34 is less accessible to the solvent than Tyr-2, Tyr-9, and Tyr-11 and equally accessible as Tyr-173, Tyr-174, and Tyr-184, but tyrosine 34 is the residue located closest to the active site, only at 5 Å from the manganese ion. The attraction of peroxynitrite to the active site, probably by the basic residues in the channel entrance, and its reaction with the manganese ion leading to the formation of nitrating species provide a reasonable explanation to the fact that tyrosine 34 is the tyrosine residue most susceptible to nitration by peroxynitrite (23MacMillan-Crow L.A.

Quijano, and R. Radi, unpublished data. as well as the enzyme molecular mass (88 kDa) and mitochondrial volume (1.2 μl/mg), a concentration of Mn-SOD inside the mitochondria of 20 ± 10 μm (80 μm subunits) was estimated. In concentrations similar to those found in the mitochondria, GSH protected Mn-SOD from nitration and inactivation both in the absence and presence of carbon dioxide (Fig. 8). These data underscore the role of GSH as a mitochondrial antioxidant and raise the question on the mechanism of nitration and inactivation of the enzyme in vivo. In this sense, Mn-SOD reported to copurify with QH2:cytocrome c reductase (complex III) (60Marres C.A.M. Van Loon A.P.G.M. Oudshoorn P. Van Steeg H. Grivel L.A. Slater E.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 147: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) may be partially associated to the sites of mitochondrial superoxide production, hence of peroxynitrite formation, constituting a preferential target for the oxidant.Since Mn-SOD is a critical mitochondrial antioxidant, its nitration represents a severe hazard that will promote oxidative damage and may ultimately signal cell death. Strategies directed to attenuate nitration of Mn-SOD tyrosine 34 should result in a better mitochondrial and cellular outcome under conditions of excess peroxynitrite formation. Peroxynitrite reacts with human recombinant and E. coliMn-SOD in a direct reaction with second order rate constants of 1.0 ± 0.2 × 105 and 1.4 ± 0.2 × 105m−1s−1 at pH 7.47 and 37 °C, respectively.

Wild-type TRβ was mostly nuclear in both the absence and presence of triiodothyronine; however, triiodothyronine induced a nuclear reorganization of TRβ. By mutating defined regions of TRβ, we found that both nuclear corepressor and retinoid X receptor are involved in maintaining the unliganded receptor within the nucleus. A TRβ mutant defective in DNA binding had only a slightly altered nuclear/cytoplasmic distribution compared with wild-type TRβ; thus, site-specific DNA binding is not essential for maintaining TRβ within the nucleus. Both ATP depletion studies and heterokaryon analysis demonstrated that TRβ rapidly shuttles between the nuclear and the cytoplasmic compartments. Cotransfection of nuclear corepressor and retinoid X receptor markedly decreased the shuttling by maintaining unliganded TRβ within the nucleus. In summary, our findings demonstrate that TRβ rapidly shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm and that protein-protein interactions of TRβ with various cofactors, rather than specific DNA interactions, play the predominant role in determining the intracellular distribution of the receptor.

This complex includes other components, such as histone deacetylases, which, in turn, can alter the chromatin structure of target genes.

Science. 1973; 181: 1253-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 20Oppenheimer J.H. Schwartz H.L. Surks M.I. Endocr. Res. Commun. 1975; 2: 309-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 21Spindler B.J. MacLeod K.M. Ring J. Baxter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4113-4119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the receptor will bind specific DNA recognition sites in the presence and absence of ligand (22Dalman F.C. Koenig R.J. Perdew G.H. Massa E. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3615-3618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the prevailing model holds that the constitutive association with the nuclear compartment is due to DNA binding by TRβ. Conversely, an earlier study with a GFP chimera of TRβ identified a significant pool of unliganded receptor in the cytoplasm (23Zhu X. Hanover J.A. Hager G.L. Cheng S.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27058-27063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To examine the potential roles of various receptor functions on the intracellular distribution of TRβ, we have examined the intracellular distribution of wild-type TRβ and a battery of receptor mutants, which are defective in specific receptor functions, including ligand binding, DNA binding, homodimerization, and nuclear corepressor (N-CoR) interaction. These studies have been performed in living cells using GFP chimeras. Our findings suggest that heterodimerization with RXR and interaction with N-CoR both play important roles in the ligand-independent nuclear retention of TRβ. In particular, TRβ mutants that cannot bind N-CoR have markedly decreased nuclear localization in the absence of hormone. Furthermore, ablation of the DNA-binding capacity of TRβ does not prevent its nuclear accumulation. Whereas a significant fraction of wild-type TRβ is likely bound to DNA in the absence of hormone, we conclude that the formation of multifactor complexes with heterodimer partners and corepressors is primarily responsible for nuclear accumulation of the unliganded thyroid receptor.RESULTSTo study the intracellular distribution of TRβ in living cells, we generated a GFP fusion to the N terminus of wild-type TRβ (GFP-TRβ; Fig. 1 A). In addition, GFP fusions were made to a series of TRβ mutants (Fig.1 B). GFP-TRβ-AHT contains three point mutations in the hinge region (A223G, H224G, and T227G) that abrogate its interaction with the nuclear corepressor N-CoR (32Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Soderstrom M. Glass C.K. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1695) Google Scholar). GFP-TRβ-127 contains a mutation within the DNA-binding domain (C127A) that destroys the integrity of the first zinc finger and prevents the receptor from binding DNA in vitro (33Yen P.M. Wilcox E.C. Hayashi Y. Refetoff S. Chin W.W. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2845-2851Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). GFP-TRβ-429 (R429Q) and GFP-TRβ-345 (G345R) are natural mutants from patients with resistance to thyroid hormone and are deficient in homodimerization and ligand binding, respectively (33Yen P.M. Wilcox E.C. Hayashi Y. Refetoff S. Chin W.W. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2845-2851Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis indicated that all GFP fusion constructs generated proteins of the predicted size (data not shown). In addition, the transcriptional activity of each GFP fusion was assayed in transient cotransfection studies and was found to be similar to that reported previously for the unfused receptors (data not shown).Analysis of the intracellular distribution of GFP-TRβ in living cells demonstrated that the majority of TRβ localized within the nucleus in both the absence and presence of T3 (Fig.2, A and B). To quantitate the percentage of GFP-TRβ present within the nucleus, the area-corrected intensity of GFP-TRβ fluorescence in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm was calculated (see “Experimental Procedures”). From these analyses, we determined that 85–90% of GFP-TRβ was localized within the nucleus in both the absence and presence of T3 (Fig. 2, A and B, and TableI). In addition, GFP-TRβ was excluded from the nucleoli, as has been reported for other nuclear receptors (Fig. 2, A and B (8, 11, 13, 27)). The observed nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio was independent of the amount of DNA transfected, indicating that protein expression levels did not impact the observed intracellular distribution of GFP-TRβ (data not shown). We found a somewhat lower cytoplasmic concentration of TRβ in hormone-free cells than that reported by Zhu et al. (23Zhu X. Hanover J.A. Hager G.L. Cheng S.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27058-27063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) (nuclear/cytoplasmic = 1.5 or ∼60% nuclear); in the presence of ligand, our results are in complete accord. The quantitative difference in the amount of unliganded receptor in the cytoplasm may be due to differences in experimental conditions between our studies and that of Zhu et al. (23Zhu X. Hanover J.A. Hager G.L. Cheng S.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27058-27063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar).Figure 2Intracellular distribution of wild-type GFP-TRβ in HeLa cells.pEGFP-TRβ (100 ng) was transfected into HeLa cells, and the intracellular distribution of GFP-TRβ was determined by laser-scanning confocal microscopy.

Open table in a new tab In previous studies on the intranuclear distribution of other nuclear receptors, such as the estrogen receptor, addition of ligand led to an intranuclear rearrangement of the receptor (27Htun H. Holth L.T. Walker D. Davie J.R. Hager G.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 471-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 34Stenoien D. Mancini M. Patel K. Allegretto E.A. Smith C.L. Mancini M.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 518-534PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, upon T3 addition, an intranuclear rearrangement of GFP-TRβ occurred. In the absence of T3, GFP-TRβ was organized in a diffuse, reticular pattern (Fig. 2 A). Upon addition of T3, GFP-TRβ redistributed into a discrete punctate pattern (Fig. 2 B). To quantitate the intranuclear distribution of GFP-TRβ in the absence and presence of T3, we adopted the method of Htun et al. (27Htun H. Holth L.T. Walker D. Davie J.R. Hager G.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 471-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Briefly, the average intensity of GFP-TRβ along a random linear line was determined. Dividing the S.D. of the average intensity by the average intensity yielded the coefficient of variation, an intensity corrected value representing the range of GFP-TRβ intensities along a defined line. A low coefficient of variation, indicative of a more diffuse distribution, would be represented by a relatively smooth line profile, as shown in Fig. 2 C. A high coefficient of variation would indicate a more focal distribution and is represented by uneven line profile (Fig. 2 D). In the absence of ligand, the coefficient of variation for GFP-TRβ was 0.11 ± 0.01, whereas in the presence of T3, the coefficient of variation increased to 0.25 ± 0.07. Therefore, GFP-TRβ undergoes a quantitative intranuclear redistribution upon the addition of T3.We then examined the intracellular distribution of the TRβ mutants described above. GFP-TRβ-345, which binds ligand poorly, exhibited a similar intracellular distribution as GFP-TRβ in the absence and presence of T3 (Fig.3, A and B, and Table I) with no change in the intranuclear distribution of this receptor (Fig. 3, A and B, and data not shown). Next, the intracellular distribution of GFP-TRβ-127 was studied. This receptor contains a disrupted zinc finger within the DNA-binding domain and is unable to bind DNA. In both the absence and presence of T3, ∼80% of GFP-TRβ-127 was found within the nucleus (Fig. 3, C and D, and Table I). Even though both liganded and unliganded TRβ are believed to be associated with DNA, these results suggest that site-specific DNA binding plays only a minor role in maintaining the nuclear localization of wild-type TRβ.Figure 3Intracellular distribution of GFP-TRβ-345 and GFP-TRβ-127 in HeLa cells. pEGFP-TRβ-345 (A and B) or pEGFP-TRβ-127 (C andD) (100 ng each) was transfected into HeLa cells, and the intracellular distribution of the each GFP-TRβ mutant was determined by laser-scanning confocal microscopy.

Quantitative analyses of the intracellular distribution of this mutant demonstrated that less than 50% of the GFP-TRβ-AHT was localized to the nucleus (Tables I andII). However, after addition of T3, a substantial portion of GFP-TRβ-AHT translocated into the nucleus, resulting in ∼85% of the receptor localizing within the nucleus (Fig. 4 B and Tables I and II). These results suggest that, in the absence of T3, N-CoR interactions likely play an important role in maintaining the nuclear localization observed with wild-type TRβ. However, in the presence of ligand, N-CoR interactions are dispensable for maintaining TRβ within the nucleus.Figure 4Intracellular distribution of GFP-TRβ-AHT in HeLa cells. pEGFP-TRβ-AHT (100 ng) was transfected into HeLa cells, and the intracellular distribution of the receptor was followed by laser-scanning confocal microscopy.

Open table in a new tab To investigate if additional factors were required for retaining TRβ within the nucleus, the intracellular distribution of GFP-TRβ-429 was studied. GFP-TRβ-429 selectively forms heterodimers with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) and is defective in homodimerization. In the absence of ligand, GFP-TRβ-429 was ∼75% nuclear (Fig.5 A and Table I), similar to that seen with GFP-TRβ-127 (Fig. 3 C and Table I). However, in the presence of T3, GFP-TRβ-429 translocated to the nucleus and adopted an intracellular distribution that was indistinguishable from wild-type TRβ (Fig. 5 B). These results demonstrate that homodimerization has only a minor role in maintaining unliganded TRβ within the nucleus and is not required for the nuclear localization of liganded TRβ.Figure 5Intracellular distribution of GFP-TRβ-429 and GFP-RXR in HeLa cells.pEGFP-TRβ-429 (A and B) or pEGFP-RXR (C and D) (100 ng each) were transfected into HeLa cells, and the intracellular distribution of the each GFP fusion was determined by laser-scanning confocal microscopy.

Numbers at bottom of each image represents the average nuclear localization (as percent total) as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To investigate further whether heterodimerization played a role in the nuclear localization of the unliganded TRβ, we expressed unfused RXR in the presence of GFP-TRβ-AHT, which was mostly cytoplasmic in the absence of ligand. If RXR was involved in the nuclear retention of the receptor, we predicted that coexpression of RXR should increase the nuclear localization of the predominantly cytoplasmic GFP-TRβ-AHT. Fig. 4 C demonstrates that this was indeed the case as GFP-TRβ-AHT localized to the nucleus when cotransfected with RXR. In addition, as the amount of RXR expression vector transfected into the cell was increased, the amount of GFP-TRβ-AHT retained within the nucleus also increased (Table II). As expected, GFP-RXR was found almost completely in the nucleus in both the absence and presence of its ligand, 9-cis-retinoic acid (Fig. 5, C andD). Coexpression of N-CoR with GFP-TRβ-AHT had no effect on the intracellular distribution of this mutant (Fig. 4 Dand Table II) as would be predicted by the inability of GFP-TRβ-AHT to interact with N-CoR. In addition, coexpressing unfused TRβ had no effect on the intracellular distribution of GFP-TRβ-AHT (Fig.4 E and Table II), consistent with the results seen with the heterodimer-specific GFP-TRβ-429. Taken together, these findings further underscore the role of heterodimerization on nuclear localization of the unliganded TRβ.Previous studies by Milgrom and co-workers (29Guiochon-Mantel A. Lescop P. Christin-Maitre S. Loosfelt H. Perrot-Applanat M. Milgrom E. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3851-3859Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) have shown that both the estrogen and progesterone receptors are actively transported into the nucleus and return to the cytoplasm by passive diffusion. Our studies with GFP-TRβ-AHT and RXR suggest that at least a portion of the intracellular TRβ may also shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. To confirm this hypothesis, the intracellular distribution of GFP-TRβ was studied after treatment with sodium azide, which depletes intracellular stores of ATP and previously has been shown to block the ATP-dependent uptake of both the estrogen and progesterone receptors into the nucleus (29Guiochon-Mantel A. Lescop P. Christin-Maitre S. Loosfelt H. Perrot-Applanat M. Milgrom E. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3851-3859Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). After a 2-h treatment with sodium azide, ∼10% of the nuclear localized GFP-TRβ redistributed to the cytoplasm (Fig. 6,A and B, and TableIII), demonstrating that a subpopulation of GFP-TRβ shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm. In addition, treatment of cells with T3, either before or after the addition of sodium azide, had no effect on the intracellular redistribution of GFP-TRβ (Fig. 6, C and D, and Table III) demonstrating that the population of GFP-TRβ that shuttles was unaffected by ligand binding. This observation was confirmed by heterokaryon analysis (Fig. 6 G). Here, GFP-TRβ-expressing NIH3T3 cells were fused to nonexpressing HeLa cells, and GFP-TRβ was found to translocate from the NIH3T3 nuclei to the HeLa nuclei, again confirming that GFP-TRβ can rapidly shuttle between the nuclear and the cytoplasmic compartments.Figure 6Nuclear cytoplasmic shuttling of GFP-TRβ in HeLa cells.

Open table in a new tab These findings suggested that nuclear import of both the unliganded and liganded TRβ was an energy-dependent process. In further support of this point, the effect of sodium azide on GFP-TRβ-AHT was studied. In the presence of sodium azide, a significant redistribution of this receptor was observed, with ∼50% of the nuclear-localized GFP-TRβ-AHT redistributing to the cytoplasm (TableIII). As shown above, addition of ligand to GFP-TRβ-AHT led to a redistribution of the receptor from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (Fig.4, A and B, and Table II). However in the presence of sodium azide, this nuclear translocation was blocked (TableIII), again demonstrating that nuclear import of TRβ is an ATP-dependent process.As described above (Figs. 4 and 5 and Table II), both N-CoR and RXR interactions played important roles in maintaining the correct intracellular distribution of TRβ. To confirm these observations further, cells were cotransfected with GFP-TRβ and either RXR or N-CoR and then treated with sodium azide. Coexpression of either N-CoR (Fig. 6 E and Table III) or RXR (Fig. 6 F, TableIII) blocked the sodium azide-induced redistribution of GFP-TRβ and demonstrated again the importance of both RXR and N-CoR in maintaining TRβ within the nucleus.Previous experiments with the estrogen receptor found that the ligand-bound estrogen receptor is in a tighter association with the nucleus than the unliganded receptor (27Htun H. Holth L.T. Walker D. Davie J.R. Hager G.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 471-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 34Stenoien D. Mancini M. Patel K. Allegretto E.A. Smith C.L. Mancini M.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 518-534PubMed Google Scholar). We have found very similar results with TRβ. In both the absence (Fig.7 A) and presence (Fig.7 B) of ligand, high salt and detergent extractions of GFP-TRβ-expressing cells failed to remove all of the receptor from the nuclei, indicating that the receptor was tightly associated with one or more factors within the nucleus. However, after DNase and ammonium sulfate treatment to remove the chromatin, the unliganded GFP-TRβ was completely lost from the nucleus, whereas a portion of the liganded GFP-TRβ remained associated with an extraction-resistant component of the nucleus (Fig. 7B, bottom panel, data not shown). Therefore, ligand binding not only induces a change in the intranuclear distribution of TRβ but also increases the association of the receptor with nonchromatin components of the nucleus.Figure 7Ligand-bound GFP-TRβ but not unliganded GFP-TRβ can associate with an insoluble nuclear com ponent. HeLa cells were transfected with 100 ng of pEGFP-TRβ and sequentially extracted as described under “Experimental Procedures” both before (A) and after (B) treatment with 10−6m T3.

Accordingly, some of the best-documented effects of large clostridial cytotoxins are the toxin-induced redistribution of actin filaments, morphological changes, and rounding-up of cells. Structure-function analyses of large clostridial cytotoxins suggest a tripartite organization of the toxins similar to that known for diphtheria toxin. According to this model, the catalytic domain is located at the N terminus (9Hofmann F. Busch C. Prepens U. Just I. Aktories K. J. Biol.

In the middle of the molecule is a rather small hydrophobic region possibly involved in the translocation of the toxin into the cytoplasm. Because the substrates of the toxins are intracellularly located, translocation of the toxins across the cell membrane is a prerequisite for their actions on Rho GTPases. However, little is known about the site and mechanism of translocation of the toxins. Two major traffic pathways for bacterial exotoxins have been described.

Another group of toxins appears to enter the cytosol from the low pH compartment of endosomes. Prototypes of this group are diphtheria toxin (16Madshus I.H. Stenmark H. Sandvig K. Olsnes S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17446-17453Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), anthrax toxin (17Singh Y. Klimpel K.R. Goel S. Swain P.K. Leppla S.H. Infect.

It is believed that endosomal acidification leads to a conformational change of these toxins, thereby allowing insertion into the endosomal membrane and eventually allowing translocation across the endosomal membrane into the cytosol. Some previous reports suggested that toxin B also escapes from the endosome into the cytoplasm (19Qa'Dan M. Spyres L.M. Ballard J.D. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 2470-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Toxins that enter the cytosol from endosomes were shown to induce ion-permeable channels in artificial membranes and in cell membranes when exposed to acidic pH (20Schmid A. Benz R. Just I. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16706-16711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Milne J.C. Collier R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 647-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether acidification also triggers the formation of channels by large clostridial cytotoxins. Here we report that under acidic conditions, C. difficiletoxin B and Clostridium sordellii lethal toxin induce membrane permeabilization in eukaryotic cells as well as channel formation in artificial lipid bilayer membranes. Cell culture medium was from Biochrom (Berlin, Germany), and fetal calf serum was from PAN Systems (Aidenbach, Germany). Cell culture materials were obtained from Falcon (Heidelberg, Germany). Thrombin was from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany). Rubidium-86 (specific activity, 2 mCi/mg) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Boston, MA). Bafilomycin A1 was from Calbiochem (Bad Soden, Germany). Toxin B from C. difficile VPI 10463 and C. sordellii lethal toxin were purified as described elsewhere (22Just I. Selzer J. Hofmann F. Aktories K. Aktories K. Bacterial Toxins: Tools in Cell Biology and Pharmacology. Chapman & Hall, Weinheim, Germany1997: 159-168Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A polyclonal antibody against toxin B (anti-Tox B) was produced in a rabbit. The toxin B fragment CDB1–546 (catalytic domain ofC. diffcile toxin B (amino acids 1–546)) was cloned, expressed, and purified as described previously (22Just I. Selzer J. Hofmann F. Aktories K. Aktories K. Bacterial Toxins: Tools in Cell Biology and Pharmacology. Chapman & Hall, Weinheim, Germany1997: 159-168Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and a monoclonal antibody (anti-CDB1–546) was produced against this fragment. CDB547–2366 (enzymatic inactive fragment of C. diffcile toxin B (amino acids 547–2366)) was amplified from genomic DNA from C. difficile VPI 10463 by polymerase chain reaction with Taq polymerase (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) and the oligonucleotide primers CDB547-BamHI (5′-GGGGATCCGATAATCTTGATTTTTCTCAAAAT-3′) and CDB3N-EcoRI (5′-GAATTCCTATTCACTAATCACTAATTG-3′). Amplification was done by denaturing at 94 °C for 10 s, primer annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, and extension at 68 °C for 6 min and repeated for 25 cycles. The resulting polymerase chain reaction product (2 μl) was cloned into pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen, NV Leek, The Netherlands) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For expression of CDB547–2366, the gene was excised withBamHI/EcoRI (NEB Biolabs, Schwalbach, Germany) and cloned in BamHI/EcoRI-digested pGEX2T plasmid (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) containing a double glycine linker. Proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli-TG1 as recombinant glutathioneS-transferase-fusion proteins and purified by affinity chromatography with glutathione-Sepharose 4B according to the manufacturer's instructions. Glutathione S-transferase was cleaved off by thrombin, and proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis according to the method of Laemmli (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). CHO1-K1, HT-29, Caco-2, and Vero cells were cultivated in tissue culture flasks at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Ham's F-12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (1:1) containing 5% heat-inactivated (30 min, 56 °C) fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells were cultivated in Eagle's minimal essential medium plus Earle's salts containing 15% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 4 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. All cells were routinely trypsinized and reseeded twice a week. For the toxin B translocation assay, CHO cells were preincubated for 15 min at 37 °C with 100 nmbafilomycin A1 in serum-free medium (Ham's F-12/DMEM), toxin B (100 ng/ml) was subsequently added, and cells were incubated for an additional 2 h at 4 °C in serum-free medium. Cells were washed with cold medium and incubated for 5 min in serum-free medium (Ham's F-12/DMEM) at pH 7.5, pH 5.2, or pH 4.5, respectively. Subsequently, cells were incubated in complete medium, pH 7.5, at 37 °C in the presence of bafilomycin A1, and after 1.5 h, phase-contrast pictures were taken. For86Rb+ efflux experiments, cells were plated in complete medium (Ham's F-12/DMEM containing 5% fetal calf serum) at a density of ∼2 × 105 cells/well in 24-well culture plates. At 8 h after plating, fresh medium containing86Rb+ (1 μ Ci/ml) was added, and cells were incubated for an additional 14 h. Cells were chilled at 4 °C, and fresh medium (4 °C; Ham's F-12/DMEM without serum) containing toxin A or toxin B was added. Toxins were allowed to bind for 2 h at 4 °C and then washed two times with cold medium to remove unbound toxin. To initiate membrane insertion of the toxins, cells were treated with warm medium (37 °C; Ham's F-12/DMEM without serum, pH 4.0–7.5) for 5 min at 37 °C. Cells were further incubated at 4 °C, and after various incubation times, aliquots of the medium were removed, and 86Rb+ release was determined by liquid scintillation counting in a 1209 Rackbeta beta counter from LKB Wallac (Gräfeling, Germany). The methods used for black lipid bilayer experiments have been described previously in detail (24Benz R. Janko K. Boos W. Lauger P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 511: 305-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Membranes were formed from a 1% solution of asolectin or diphytanoyl phosphatidylcholine (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) in n-decane. Treatment of CHO cells with bafilomycin A1, which blocks the vacuolar H+-ATPase pump, prevented the cytotoxic effect of toxin B. To test the effect of pH on toxin uptake, toxin B was allowed to bind to cells at 4 °C. After 2 h, cells were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C with bafilomycin-containing medium of pH 7.5, pH 5.2, or pH 4.5, respectively. Thereafter, the acidified media were replaced by neutral medium containing bafilomycin, and cells were incubated for an additional 1.5 h at 37 °C. The cells were then analyzed for cytopathic effects induced by toxin B by phase-contrast microscopy. As shown in Fig.1, cells rounded up when the pH was shifted for 5 min to pH 5.2 or pH 4.5 but not at pH 7.5. The results indicate that at low pH, the toxin crosses the cell membrane directly even in the presence of bafilomycin. The data are in line with the recent report that toxin B escapes from an acidic endosomal compartment into the cytoplasm (19Qa'Dan M. Spyres L.M. Ballard J.D. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 2470-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The conditions allowing direct uptake of toxin B across the cytoplasmic membrane were used to test whether extracellular acidification leads to channel formation and membrane permeabilization by toxin B. To this end, the efflux of 86Rb+from preloaded cells was studied. At first,86Rb+-preloaded CHO cells were incubated without and with toxin B and heat-inactivated toxin B, respectively. An increase in 86Rb+ release was measured when toxin B-treated cells were incubated in an acidified medium of pH 5.2 (Fig. 2 A). The increased86Rb+ release depended not only on low pH but also required short-term (5 min) incubation at 37 °C. It is noteworthy that under these conditions, cells did not round up, indicating no intoxication by toxin B. Acidification of medium in the absence of toxin B and in the presence of heat-inactivated toxin or binding of toxin B to cells without subsequent acidification did not increase 86Rb+ release. This result indicates that toxin B was inserted into the membrane of eukaryotic cells and increased membrane permeability after exposure of cells to acidic pH. In Vero cells, toxin B caused a similar increase in efflux of86Rb+ at low pH (Fig. 2 B). This finding indicates that channel formation by toxin is not restricted to CHO cells. However, we were not able to detect an increase in86Rb+ release in HT-29 and Caco-2 cells. Additional studies on toxin B-induced 86Rb+release were performed with the CHO-K1 cell line. At first, the influence of pH on the kinetics of the 86Rb+ release from toxin B-treated CHO cells was studied. When the medium of toxin B-treated cells was shifted to pH 5.2 for 5 min at 37 °C and cells were subsequently incubated on ice at pH 5.2, the increase in86Rb+ release occurred mainly within 20–30 min. A low additional increase in 86Rb+ release occurred in a second phase within 90 min (Fig.3). A similar release of86Rb+ was observed when toxin B-treated cells were kept for 5 min in a medium of pH 5.2 and then incubated at 4 °C at pH 7.5. This finding suggests that membrane permeabilization by toxin B is achieved by a brief acidic pulse. Once formation of channels has occurred, the channels remained open to release86Rb+ even at physiological pH. To further characterize the formation of channels, we studied the pH dependence of the toxin effects in more detail.86Rb+-preloaded CHO cells were incubated with toxin B and shifted to pH 7.5, pH 5.6, pH 5.2, or pH 5.0, respectively. At the lowest pH (5.0), the largest increase in release of86Rb+ occurred. At pH 5.6,86Rb+ efflux was much less pronounced than that at pH 5.2 or pH 5.0, and at pH 7.5, no increased release was measured (Fig. 4 A). Next,86Rb+-preloaded CHO cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of toxin B (25, 100, and 500 ng/ml, respectively). Cells were then shifted to pH 5.2, and released86Rb+ was determined.86Rb+ efflux depended on the concentration of the toxin. Treatment of cells with 100 and 500 ng/ml toxin B, respectively, did not result in significant differences in86Rb+ release (Fig. 4 B), most likely indicating saturation of the toxin binding capacity of CHO cells. This finding suggests that the specific binding of toxin B to its cell membrane receptor is a prerequisite for subsequent channel formation. Moreover, the data indicate that channel formation is not caused by an unspecific integration of toxin B into cell membranes.Figure 4pH and concentration dependence of toxin B-mediated 86Rb+ efflux. 86Rb+-preloaded CHO cells were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with toxin B (100 ng/ml) or, for control, without toxin. Cells were washed to remove unbound toxin, and prewarmed medium (pH 7.5, ▪; pH 5.6, ●; pH 5.2, ▴; pH 5.0, ▾) was added. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min and then incubated at 4 °C. After 10, 20, 30, and 60 min, aliquots (100 μl) of the medium were removed, and released 86Rb+ was determined (A). 86Rb+-preloaded CHO cells were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with toxin B (25, 100, and 500 ng/ml, respectively) or, for control, without toxin B. Cells were washed, and prewarmed medium (pH 5.2) was added. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min and then incubated at 4 °C. After 10 (▪), 20 (●), 30 (▴), and 60 min (▾), aliquots (100 μl) of the medium were removed, and 86Rb+ was determined (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm that receptor binding of toxin B is necessary for subsequent membrane permeabilization, toxin B was incubated with an antibody directed toward the complete toxin, which recognizes mainly the receptor binding domain of toxin B (25Genth H. Selzer J. Busch C. Dumbach J. Hofmann F. Aktories K. Just I. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 1094-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), or with an antibody against its N-terminal catalytic domain, respectively. CHO cells were then incubated with the respective toxin/antibody mixture. The antibody against the holotoxin inhibited binding of toxin B to CHO cells and prevented the cytotoxic effects (Fig. 5 A). In contrast, the antibody against the catalytic domain did not inhibit toxin B-induced rounding of the cells (Fig. 5 A). Accordingly, the latter antibody did not affect toxin B-induced86Rb+ release from CHO cells (Fig.5 B). Incubation of toxin B with the antibody against the holotoxin prevented toxin-induced membrane permeabilization. However, this antibody was without effect when added to cells after binding of toxin B (Fig. 5 B). This observation suggests that only toxin B that was already bound to the cell membrane receptor formed channels at low pH. To determine the part of toxin B that mediates membrane permeabilization of cells after acidification, we cloned and expressed a toxin B fragment. CDB547–2366 consists of residues 547–2366, i.e.of the putative receptor binding and membrane insertion domains, and lacks the catalytic domain (Fig.6 A). The proteins were allowed to bind to 86Rb+-preloaded CHO cells, and cells were subsequently exposed to pH 7.5 or pH 4.5, respectively. The release of 86Rb+ was determined. Fig. 6 shows that the release of 86Rb+ from preloaded CHO cells was increased when cells were treated with CDB547–2366 and then exposed to acidic medium. It is noteworthy that the concentration of toxin B fragment CDB547–2366 (4 μg/ml) was higher than that of the full-length toxin B (200 ng/ml), which was applied in parallel. Lethal toxin ofC. sordellii was tested for an influence on86Rb+ release from cells after exposure to low pH medium. Therefore, the toxin was allowed to bind to preloaded CHO cells, and cells were subsequently shifted to pH 7.5 or pH 4.5, respectively, for 5 min at 37 °C and incubated for an additional 55 min at 4 °C. As shown in Fig. 7, treatment of cells with lethal toxin of C. sordellii and subsequent exposure to low pH medium increased the efflux of86Rb+ from cells. Similar results were obtained when RBL cells were used. The toxin B-mediated efflux of 86Rb+ from cells indicated that toxin B formed channels, which were at least permeable to ions. Therefore, we studied whether ion-permeable channels are also formed in lipid bilayer membranes. In a first set of experiments, we studied the effect of toxin B on membranes formed from different lipids such as phosphatidylcholine and asolectin at pH 6. Under these conditions, we observed only rare current fluctuations in single-channel recordings (see Fig.8 A). The fluctuations were very rapid as Fig. 8 A demonstrates and had only a short lifetime on the order of seconds. Their single-channel conductance was ∼0.2–1.5 nS in 1 m KCl. Enhanced single-channel activity was observed, however, when the pH was lowered to pH 5, and many more channels were recorded under the conditions of the lowered pH (see Fig.8 B). The current fluctuations were again very rapid, and it was difficult to provide a precise value for the single-channel conductance. Histograms of the fluctuations that could be resolved suggest that the pH did not influence the size of the channels as compared with pH 6. The low pH seemed to increase simply the channel-forming activity. Measurement with other salts such as LiCl suggested that a variety of ions were permeable through the toxin B channel, but it seemed to have generally a higher permeability for cations than for anions. Bacterial toxins that modify intracellular substrates must translocate across a lipid bilayer membrane to reach their targets (26Montecucco C. Papini E. Schiavo G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). After endocytosis, two pathways are described that are used by bacterial toxins to reach their cytosolic substrates. One possible route for toxin uptake (e.g. cholera toxin (13Majoul I. Sohn K. Wieland F.T. Pepperkok R. Pizza M. Hillemann J. Söling H.-D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 601-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar)) is the retrograde transport from endosomal compartments via the Golgi apparatus to the endoplasmic reticulum, from which the toxins translocate into the cytoplasm. Other toxins (e.g.diphtheria toxin (16Madshus I.H. Stenmark H. Sandvig K. Olsnes S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17446-17453Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or the binary anthrax toxin (17Singh Y. Klimpel K.R. Goel S. Swain P.K. Leppla S.H. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 1853-1859Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) translocate directly from the acidic endosomal compartment into the cytosol. Inhibition of the cytotoxic action of toxin B by bafilomycin, as reported recently and shown in this report, indicates that toxin B also requires an acidic endosome for cellular uptake (19Qa'Dan M. Spyres L.M. Ballard J.D. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 2470-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In line with this notion is the finding that the lowering of the extracellular pH allows uptake of the toxin even in the presence of bafilomycin. Thus far, our knowledge of the events that cause translocation of toxin B is very limited. In the present study, we report that toxin B is capable of inducing ion-permeable channels, a process that might reflect molecular mechanisms closely related to translocation of the toxin into the cytosol. For detection of channel formation, the release of86Rb+ from preloaded cells was measured, and conditions were chosen that mimic the endosomal compartment,e.g. cell-bound toxin B was exposed to an acidic buffer (pH < 5.6) for a short time (5 min) at 37 °C to induce channel formation by the toxin. Similarly, we observed a strong induction of channel formation in lipid bilayer membranes when the pH was lowered to pH 5 (see Fig. 8). At pH 6, only a very small channel-forming activity was observed. It is noteworthy that pH-dependent channel formation has been reported for several protein toxins that are taken up from endosomes (18Barth H. Blöcker D. Behlke J. Bergsma-Schutter W. Brisson A. Benz R. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18704-18711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 21Milne J.C. Collier R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 647-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). It is believed that the low pH present in endosomal compartments causes conformational changes of the toxin, which are accompanied by surface exposition of the otherwise intramolecularly located hydrophobic region of the toxins. The hydrophobic regions are inserted into the bilayer membrane to form channels and/or to allow protein translocation. Recently, Qa'Danet al. (19Qa'Dan M. Spyres L.M. Ballard J.D. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 2470-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) analyzed the pH-induced conformational changes occurring in toxin B. Using various fluorescence methods, it was shown that the hydrophobicity of toxin B was increased at pH ≤ 5.0 but not at pH ≥ 5.5 and concluded that toxin B undergoes pH-induced structural changes that finally allow membrane insertion and translocation of the toxin from the acidic endosome into the cytosol. Thus far, the structural basis of the pH-dependent channels is not clear. Our studies show that the N-terminal catalytic domain (toxin B fragment consisting of amino acids 1–546) is not necessary for channel formation. In contrast, a N-terminal truncated toxin B fragment that consisted of amino acid residues 547–2366 was capable of channel formation. However, because the C-terminal fragment was only active at concentrations higher than that of the holotoxin, it is suggested that the N terminus might also play a minor role in binding/insertion or stabilization of the holotoxin. Nevertheless, the results are in line with the view that the C terminus and the middle part of large clostridial toxins are involved in receptor binding and translocation. This hypothesis is supported by the findings that an antibody directed against the holotoxin, which recognizes mainly the receptor binding domain of toxin B (25Genth H. Selzer J. Busch C. Dumbach J. Hofmann F. Aktories K. Just I. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 1094-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), inhibited channel formation and intoxication, whereas an antibody against the N-terminal catalytic domain of toxin B was not able to prevent the increase in Rb efflux. In experiments with artificial black lipid bilayer membranes, membrane permeabilization by toxin B was detected at pH 6.0 and increased under more acidic conditions (pH 4.5). Here, the antibody against the holotoxin had no effect on toxin B-induced membrane permeabilization. This indicates that the antibody did not affect membrane insertion of toxin B but might inhibit the toxin binding to the cell surface. However, it remains to be clarified whether insertion into artificial membranes and insertion into cell membranes follow identical mechanisms. Moreover, the functional dissociation of channel formation and cytopathic effects induced by the toxin is corroborated by the finding that despite increased 86Rb+ efflux, the cells still showed the control morphology when experiments were performed at 4 °C and only the acidic shift was done at 37 °C. An increased 86Rb+ efflux was measured when CHO, Vero, or RBL cells were studied. These cell lines show high sensitivity toward toxin B and appear to have a sufficient amount of cell membrane receptor molecules. In contrast, we were not able to detect toxin B-induced channel formation in some other cell lines (HT-29 and Caco-2). In agreement with the possible destruction of the barrier function of the cytoplasmic membrane of CHO, Vero, or RBL cells, we were able to identify channel formation in artificial lipid bilayer membranes. Channels were formed with the two lipids tested. This result seems to represent a contradiction to the obvious receptor-mediated permeabilization of cells. However, it has to be kept in mind that other toxins, such as C2 toxin (20Schmid A. Benz R. Just I. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16706-16711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or the repeat in toxin toxins (27Ropele M. Menestrina G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 985: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 28Benz R. Hardie K.R. Hughes C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 29Maier E. Reinhard N. Benz R. Frey J. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 4415-4423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), form channels in lipid bilayer membranes without the need for receptors, whereas they all need a receptor for biological activity. An important role of the toxin receptor in events finally resulting in channel formation is supported by the concentration effect studies at high concentration of toxin, which show that limitation of channel formation is most likely due to reaching the binding capacity of cells. In contrast to toxin B, toxin A from C. difficile showed no detectable channel-forming activity in the 86Rb+ release assay with CHO cells. This might be due to the relative insensitivity of CHO cells to toxin A and to their low content of toxin A receptor molecules. Toxin A, which is also termed enterotoxin, is known to exhibit much less cytotoxic effect on many cultured cells than toxin B. Similar to toxin B, C. sordellii lethal toxin caused channel formation in CHO and RBL cells, which are especially sensitive to the lethal toxin, suggesting that channel formation is a general activity of large clostridial cytotoxins.

In the current study, we have shown that the level of IKLF mRNA was nearly undetectable in serum-deprived NIH3T3 fibroblasts but became acutely and significantly increased upon the addition of fetal bovine serum or the phorbol ester, PMA.

Constitutive expression of IKLF in transfected NIH3T3 cells significantly increased the rate of proliferation when compared with cells transfected with an empty vector. The growth ofIKLF-transfected cells was no longer inhibited by cell-cell contact or by low serum content. Moreover, these cells proliferated in an anchorage-independent fashion. We conclude thatIKLF encodes a delayed early response gene product that positively regulates cellular proliferation and may give rise to a transformed phenotype when overexpressed.

In addition, evidence suggests that KLFs collectively exert important regulatory functions in diverse biological processes such as growth, development, differentiation, and apoptosis. One tissue in which a number of KLFs appear to play an important regulatory role is the intestinal epithelium. This tissue is a dynamic system in which proliferation of stem cells located in the crypts is intimately coupled to their differentiation into mature daughter cells once they exit the crypts (8Stappenbeck T.S.

Dyn. 2000; 217: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), is particularly active in the intestinal epithelium. However, their patterns of expression appear to be complementary rather than redundant. Whereas GKLF is primarily expressed in the differentiated epithelial cells, away from the proliferating zone,IKLF is found mainly in the proliferating crypt cell population. The in vivo pattern of GKLFexpression is mirrored by its in vitro pattern; it is found mostly in cells that are growth-arrested (10Shields J.M. Christy R.J. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20009-20017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 14Shie J.L. Chen Z.Y. Fu M. Pestell R.G. Tseng C.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2969-2976Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, constitutive expression of GKLF leads to the inhibition of DNA synthesis (10Shields J.M. Christy R.J. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20009-20017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 15Shie J.L. Chen Z.Y. O'Brien M.J. Pestell R.G. Lee M.E. Tseng C.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G806-G814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the physiological function of IKLF is less clear, although it has been proposed to have an opposing effect to GKLF in regulating epithelial cell differentiation (12Conkright M.D. Wani M.A. Anderson K.P. Lingrel J.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1263-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The present study seeks to characterize the effect of IKLF on cellular proliferation. We demonstrate that expression ofIKLF in cultured cells responds transiently and acutely to growth stimuli. In addition, forced expression of IKLF in transfected cells results in an accelerated rate of proliferation and a transformed phenotype as evidenced by formation of foci, loss of contact inhibition, as well as acquisition of serum- and anchorage-independent growth. Our results indicate that IKLF has a proproliferative effect, which lends support to the previous hypothesis that it may counteract the function of GKLF. Cell culture media and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were purchased from Life Technologies (Gaithersburg, MD) and Hyclone Laboratories (Logan, UT), respectively. Radioisotopes were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and cycloheximide (CHX) were purchased from Sigma. The monoclonal antibody directed against the hemagglutinin A (HA) epitope (F-7, sc-7392) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Expression constructs containing full-length IKLF and HA-tagged IKLF (pBK-CMV-IKLF and pBK-CMV-IKLF·HA, respectively) were kindly provided by Dr. Jerry Lingrel (12Conkright M.D. Wani M.A. Anderson K.P. Lingrel J.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1263-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The expression construct containing activated Ha-Ras was a generous gift of Dr. Raul Urrutia (16Gebelein B. Fernandez-Zapico M. Imoto M. Urrutia R. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1911-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The expression construct containing full-length GKLF, PMT3-GKLF, was previously described (10Shields J.M. Christy R.J. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20009-20017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). NIH3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. For experiments involving mitogenic stimulation, cells were first rendered quiescent by removal of serum from the medium for 24 h. Cells were then stimulated with fresh medium containing 15% FBS or 100 ng/ml PMA for various duration. In experiments in which CHX was included, quiescent cells were pretreated with 10 μg/ml CHX for 1 h before the addition of FBS or PMA. Treatments were then continued for another 1 h with the respective mitogen and CHX. RNA was isolated using the Trizol method (Life Technologies) and resolved by denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis followed by transfer to nylon membranes. Complementary DNA probes encoding IKLF and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were labeled using [α-32P]dATP and the random-primed DNA labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Conditions of hybridization and washing were previously described (10Shields J.M. Christy R.J. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20009-20017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis was performed according to a previous protocol (10Shields J.M. Christy R.J. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20009-20017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar) using proteins extracted from stably transfected cells. The blots were probed with a monoclonal antibody directed against the HA epitope at a concentration of 200 ng/ml. Blots were then incubated with a peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a dilution of 1:2,000. Signals were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Focus formation assays were performed according to a previously published protocol (17Cox A.D. Der C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 238: 277-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μg of plasmid DNA containing the various effectors was transfected into NIH3T3 cells using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were then maintained in DMEM and 10% FBS for 2–3 weeks at which time they were stained with methylene blue to demonstrate the foci. The number of foci in each dish was then manually counted. NIH3T3 cells were transfected with pBK-CMV-IKLF·HA or the pBK-CMV empty vector using LipofectAMINE. Two mg/ml G418 was added to the medium beginning 24 h after transfection to select for resistant clones, which were isolated 2 weeks later and expanded. The presence of HA-tagged IKLF was detected by Western blot analysis using the anti-HA monoclonal antibody. Cell proliferation assays were performed by seeding theIKLF·HA- or empty vector-transfected cells at a density of 2 × 105 cells per well in 6-well plates. Cells were fed DMEM with 10% FBS every other day, and the number of cells in the wells were manually counted with a hemocytometer daily for up to 5 days following seeding. For the serum dependence assay, cells were seeded at a density 2 × 105 cells per well in 6-well plates and maintained in DMEM with 1% FBS. Cells were counted every other day up to 6 days after seeding. Anchorage dependence assay was performed according to a published protocol (17Cox A.D. Der C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 238: 277-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).Ha-ras-, IKLF·HA-, or empty vector-transfected cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 105 cells per 10-cm dish in a 0.33% top agar suspension, which was overlaid onto a 0.5% agar bottom layer. Cells were fed DMEM, 10% FBS, and 2 mg/ml G418 every other day. Colonies developed in the agar suspension were examined 3 weeks following seeding, and the number was tabulated under an inverted phase-contrast microscope. Photodocumentation was accomplished with a Nikon digital camera. To investigate the responsiveness of IKLFexpression to growth stimulation, we conducted Northern blot analyses in cultured fibroblasts. NIH3T3 cells were first rendered quiescent by removing the serum from the medium and then stimulated by 15% FBS or the phorbol ester, PMA. As seen in Fig.1, A and B, the level of IKLF transcripts was barely detectable in serum-starved, quiescent cells (time 0). Upon addition of FBS (Fig. 1 A) or PMA (Fig. 1 B), the levels ofIKLF transcripts increased acutely and transiently, reaching a maximum after 2–3 h of treatment before returning to baseline levels. The enhancing effect of both stimuli was prevented in cells pretreated with the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide (Fig.1 C, CHX). These results indicate that IKLF is an early response gene to growth stimulation although this responsiveness requires protein synthesis. IKLF would therefore fall into the category of delayed early response genes (18Winkles J.A. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 58: 41-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 19Lanahan A. Williams J.B. Sanders L.K. Nathans D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3919-3929Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). As a means to measure the effect of IKLF on cell proliferation, we conducted the focus formation assay previously developed for testing the transforming activity of oncogenes such as ras (17Cox A.D. Der C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 238: 277-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 20Clark G.J. Cox A.D. Graham S.M. Der C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 395-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). NIH3T3 fibroblasts were transfected with the various effector constructs and foci scored 2–3 weeks after transfection. As shown in Fig.2, an expression plasmid containing the HA-tagged IKLF produced ∼30% of the number of foci caused by activated Ha-Ras. A second construct containing IKLF without the HA-tag gave rise to similar results (not shown). In contrast, an expression plasmid containing GKLF failed to produce any foci, as were mock-transfected cells (Fig. 2). These results suggest that forced expression of IKLF causes focus formation in a manner similar to activated Ha-Ras, an activity that was not paralleled by GKLF. To further investigate the effect of IKLF on cell proliferation, we established several clonally derived NIH3T3 cell lines that had been transfected with pBK-CMV-IKLF·HA or the pBK-CMV empty vector and selected with the antibiotic, G418. Two independent clones from each construct were chosen and examined. Fig.3 A shows that the two pBK-CMV-IKLF·HA- but not the two pBK-CMV-transfected clones (lanes 1 and 2 versus lanes 3 and 4, respectively) produced a full-length HA-tagged IKLF as detected by Western blot using a monoclonal antibody against the HA epitope. When the growth characteristics of these cells were examined and compared over a course of 5 days following seeding at a low density, it became apparent that the IKLF·HA-expressing cells proliferated at a much faster rate compared with the control, empty vector-transfected cells (Fig. 3 B). Moreover, whereas the control cells ceased to proliferate after reaching confluency, theIKLF·HA-transfected cells continued to grow to several layers (Fig. 3 C). These findings suggest that the growth of IKLF·HA-transfected cells was no longer subject to contact inhibition, providing further evidence for a proproliferative effect of IKLF. The stably transfected NIH3T3 cells were subjected to additional and more stringent tests of cellular proliferation and transformation. In one, cells were seeded and maintained in medium containing only 1% FBS. Under these conditions, empty vector-transfected cells failed to proliferate. In fact, many perished because of the low-serum content. In contrast, IKLF·HA-transfected cells continued to proliferate at a relatively brisk rate albeit slightly slower than that when maintained in 10% FBS (compare Figs.4 A and 3 B). A second test involved growth in soft agar (17Cox A.D. Der C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 238: 277-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig.4 B, IKLF·HA-transfected cells formed colonies in an agar suspension as were Ha-ras-transfected cells at a ∼1:3 ratio. In contrast, empty vector-transfected cells remained as single cells in the agar suspension without ever forming any colonies (Fig. 4 C). The morphology and size of the colonies produced by IKLF·HA- andHa-ras-transfected cells were very similar to each other (Fig. 4 C). Complementary DNA clones encoding mouse IKLF were initially identified because of sequence homology to LKLF (12Conkright M.D. Wani M.A. Anderson K.P. Lingrel J.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1263-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). A human homolog was subsequently isolated based on its binding to a specificcis-sequence in the promoter of the lactoferrin gene promoter (21Shi H. Zhang Z. Wang X. Liu S. Teng C.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4807-4815Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In situ hybridization studies of both adult (12Conkright M.D. Wani M.A. Anderson K.P. Lingrel J.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1263-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and fetal intestinal tissues (13Ohnishi S. Laub F. Matsumoto N. Asaka M. Ramirez F. Yoshida T. Terada M. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 217: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) showed that expression ofIKLF is concentrated in the base of intestinal crypts. Thein vivo pattern of IKLF expression in the intestinal tract therefore correlates with a proliferative phenotype, although a direct effect of IKLF on cellular proliferation was not established by these studies. It should be noted that IKLF is identical to the previously isolated BTEB2 (22Sogawa K. Imataka H. Yamasaki Y. Kusume H. Abe H. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1527-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), which, because of a sequencing error, has a shorter open-reading frame than IKLF (13Ohnishi S. Laub F. Matsumoto N. Asaka M. Ramirez F. Yoshida T. Terada M. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 217: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In a rabbit model, expression of BTEB2/IKLF is induced in activated smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in the neointima of balloon-injured aorta (23Watanabe N. Kurabayashi M. Shimomura Y. Kawai-Kowase K. Hoshino Y. Manabe I. Watanabe M. Aikawa M. Kuro-o M. Suzuki T. Yazaki Y. Nagai R. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 182-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Similarly, increased BTEB2expression has been noted in proliferating SMCs at anastomotic vascular stricture (24Ogata T. Kurabayashi M. Hoshino Y.I. Sekiguchi K.I. Ishikawa S. Morishita Y. Nagai R. J. Thorac. Cardiovasc. Surg. 2000; 119: 983-989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and this increased expression is a positive predictive factor for vascular restenosis in pathological conditions (25Hoshino Y. Kurabayashi M. Kanda T. Hasegawa A. Sakamoto H. Okamoto E.i. Kowase K. Watanabe N. Manabe I. Suzuki T. Nakano A. Takase S.I. Wilcox J.N. Nagai R. Circulation. 2000; 102: 2528-2534Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies suggest that activation ofBTEB2/IKLF expression is correlated with a proliferative state. The results of the current study indicate that expression ofIKLF in cultured, quiescent NIH3T3 cells is acutely and transiently induced upon mitogenic stimulation by factors such as serum and phorbol ester. This induction is dependent on new protein synthesis as it is abolished in the presence of cycloheximide. A similar inductive response of BTEB2/IKLF was noted in cultured rabbit aorta-derived SMCs treated with PMA or basic fibroblast growth factor (26Kawai-Kowase K. Kurabayashi M. Hoshino Y. Ohyama Y. Nagai R. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 787-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The latter study also showed that expression of the immediate early response gene, Egr-1, is highly up-regulated by PMA and that Egr-1 binds to and activates the promoter of theBTEB2/IKLF gene (26Kawai-Kowase K. Kurabayashi M. Hoshino Y. Ohyama Y. Nagai R. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 787-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that Egr-1 is an immediate mediator of induction of IKLF during proliferative responses. Despite evidence from in vitro and in vivostudies demonstrating a correlation between IKLF expression and proliferation, it is not clear whether IKLF directly regulates cellular proliferation. The results of the current study are the first to show that constitutive expression of IKLF increases proliferation. We also show that IKLF alone is sufficient to cause a transformed phenotype as assessed by focus formation (Fig. 2), loss of contact inhibition (Fig. 3 C), and gain of serum- (Fig.4 A) and anchorage-independent growth (Fig. 4, Band C). These observations therefore suggest that IKLF is potentially a mediator of cellular proliferation in the variousin vivo and in vitro systems described above. Whether IKLF directly participates in regulating the cell cycle or whether expression of IKLF is increased in pathological conditions such as neoplasm remains to be investigated. Based on the opposing patterns of expression of GKLF andIKLF in the intestine, Lingrel and co-workers (12Conkright M.D. Wani M.A. Anderson K.P. Lingrel J.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1263-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) proposed that their gene products may have opposing effects in regulating proliferation and differentiation of the intestinal epithelium. Indeed, the antiproliferative effect of GKLF depicted by previous studies (10Shields J.M. Christy R.J. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20009-20017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar,14Shie J.L. Chen Z.Y. Fu M. Pestell R.G. Tseng C.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2969-2976Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the proproliferative effect of IKLF demonstrated by this study support their hypothesis. Biochemical evidence also suggests that the two proteins may have opposing functions. For example, the promoter of the SMC differentiation marker gene, SM22α, is repressed by GKLF but activated by IKLF (27Adam P.J. Regan C.P. Hautmann M.B. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37798-37806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Preliminary studies from our laboratory also indicate that GKLF and IKLF regulate theGKLF promoter in an opposing manner. 2C. Mahatan and V. W. Yang, unpublished observations. In view of the highly conserved sequence in the zinc finger region of the two proteins and the similar DNA sequences to which they bind (10Shields J.M. Christy R.J. Yang V.W. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4807-4815Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), it would not be surprising that the two KLFs may coordinately regulate the expression of a group of genes through similar if not identicalcis-elements. Further studies will demonstrate the biochemical mechanisms by which GKLF and IKLF antagonize each other in the context of regulating complex biological processes such as cellular proliferation and differentiation.

Incubation of HEK 293 cells expressing FLAG-tagged δ and μ receptors with agonists caused a time-dependent decrease in opioid receptor levels assayed by immunoblotting. Pulse-chase experiments using [35S]methionine metabolic labeling indicated that the turnover rate of δ receptors was accelerated 5-fold following agonist stimulation. Inactivation of functional Gi and Go proteins by pertussis toxin-attenuated down-regulation of the μ opioid receptor, while down-regulation of the δ opioid receptor was unaffected. Pretreatment of cells with inhibitors of lysosomal proteases, calpain, and caspases had little effect on μ and δ opioid receptor down-regulation. In marked contrast, pretreatment with proteasome inhibitors attenuated agonist-induced μ and δ receptor down-regulation. In addition, incubation of cells with proteasome inhibitors in the absence of agonists increased steady-state μ and δ opioid receptor levels. Immunoprecipitation of μ and δ opioid receptors followed by immunoblotting with ubiquitin antibodies suggested that preincubation with proteasome inhibitors promoted accumulation of polyubiquitinated receptors. These data provide evidence that the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway plays a role in agonist-induced down-regulation and basal turnover of opioid receptors.

The pharmacological effects of opioid drugs and the physiological effects of endogenous opioid peptides are initiated through the binding and activation of opioid receptors (1Chaturvedi K. Christoffers K.H. Singh K. Howells R.D. Biopolymers.. 2001; 55: 334-346Google Scholar), which are members of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)1 family (2Wess J. Pharmacol. Ther... 1998; 80: 231-264Google Scholar). GPCRs comprise a diverse superfamily of integral membrane proteins that mediate signal transduction across the plasma membrane. All GPCRs are postulated to have amino termini located on the extracellular side of the plasma membrane that are linked to seven-transmembrane helices connected by relatively short intracellular and extracellular loops, and contain carboxyl termini that face the interior of the cell. Ligands approach and engage GPCRs from the extracellular space, and receptor activation results in coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins on the intracellular face of membrane. The amino termini of nearly all G protein-coupled receptors contain consensus amino acid sequences for asparagine-linked glycosylation; two sites for N-linked glycosylation are present in δ and κ receptors, while five are found in the μ receptor (3Singh V.K.

Opioid receptors exhibit ∼60% identity in their amino acid sequences, however, marked differences in sequence conservation are evident within receptor subdomains. The amino acid sequences of putative transmembrane spanning segments and the three intracellular loops are highly conserved among opioid receptor types, whereas sequences in the extracellular amino termini, second and third extracellular loops, and the intracellular carboxyl termini are considerably more divergent (1Chaturvedi K. Christoffers K.H. Singh K. Howells R.D. Biopolymers.. 2001; 55: 334-346Google Scholar). Upon activation, opioid receptors interact with multiple G proteins to regulate adenylyl cyclase, the MAP kinase pathway, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Ca2+channels, and K+ channels (16Carter B.D.

Short-term exposure of opioid receptors to agonists, like most GPCRs, leads to receptor desensitization, while chronic exposure leads to receptor down-regulation (reviewed in Refs. 1Chaturvedi K. Christoffers K.H. Singh K. Howells R.D. Biopolymers.. 2001; 55: 334-346Google Scholar and 21Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 18677-18680Google Scholar). Homologous desensitization appears to involve phosphorylation of the agonist-activated GPCR by members of the G protein-coupled receptor kinase family, and subsequent binding of arrestin proteins, which effectively uncouple the interaction of activated GPCRs from heterotrimeric G proteins (21Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 18677-18680Google Scholar). In addition to preventing receptor/G protein interactions, arrestins initiate receptor endocytosis via clathrin-coated pits (22Ferguson S.S.G. Downey III, W.E. Colapietro A.-M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. Science.. 1996; 27: 365-1363Google Scholar, 23Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature.. 1996; 38: 450-3447Google Scholar). Endosome-associated receptors can be resensitized by protein phosphatases and recycled back to the plasma membrane, or be degraded intracellularly. The mechanism for GPCR proteolysis has been generally assumed to involve fusion of endosomes with lysosomes, based on studies of epidermal growth factor receptor down-regulation (24Kornilova E. Sorkina T. Bequinot L. Sorkin A. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 30340-30346Google Scholar). Acute agonist-induced desensitization of opioid receptors appears to involve similar mechanisms as described for the β2-adrenergic receptor. It has been shown that δ and μ opioid receptors are phosphorylated by G protein-coupled receptor kinases following agonist treatment (25Pei G. Kieffer B.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Freedman N.J. Mol.

Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 11130-11140Google Scholar), and following treatment of cells for several hours with agonist, δ opioid receptors are apparently associated with lysosomes (30Ko J.L. Arvidsson U. Williams F.G. Law P.Y. Elde R. Loh H.H. Mol. Brain Res... 1999; 69: 171-185Google Scholar). This study was designed to test the hypothesis that lysosomal proteases are responsible for opioid receptor down-regulation. Contrary to this hypothesis, these data implicate a prominent role for the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway in agonist-induced down-regulation and basal turnover of opioid receptors. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. HEK 293 cells were transfected using electroporation, as described previously (31Shahrestanifar M. Howells R.D. Neurochem. Res... 1996; 21: 1295-1299Google Scholar), with expression plasmids encoding murine μ or δ opioid receptors tagged at the amino termini with the FLAG epitope (kindly provided by Dr. M. Van Zastrow). Cells stably expressing epitope-tagged opioid receptors were selected in media containing 1 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD), as described (32Chaturvedi K. Shahrestanifar M. Howells R.D. Mol. Brain Res... 2000; 76: 64-72Google Scholar, 33Chaturvedi K. Jiang X. Christoffers K.H. Chinen N. Bandari P. Raveglia L.F. Ronzoni S. Dondio G. Howells R.D. Mol. Brain Res... 2000; 80: 166-176Google Scholar). HEK 293 cells expressing epitope-tagged μ or δ opioid receptors were grown to near confluence in 100-mm diameter dishes. For membrane preparations, the culture medium was aspirated and cells were harvested using a cell scraper in 5 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, per 100-mm dish. The cell suspension was homogenized with a Tekmar tissuemizer (Cincinnati, OH), then centrifuged at 35,000 × g for 20 min. The membrane pellet was washed 3 times in Tris buffer and then resuspended by homogenization in 1 ml of 0.32 m sucrose, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, per dish, and the crude membrane preparation was stored at −80 °C. Opioid receptor binding assays were conducted in duplicate on membrane preparations diluted 20–40-fold in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5. Radioligands that were used included (−)-[9-3H]bremazocine (specific activity 26.6 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), [tyrosyl-3,5-3H]DAMGO (specific activity 48.9 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), [3H]ethylketocyclazocine (specific activity 27 Ci/mmol, NIDA, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, MD), and [tyrosyl-3,5-3H][D-Ser2,Leu5]enkephalin-Thr (specific activity, 57 Ci/mmol, NIDA, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, MD). Binding assays were conducted at 22 °C in a volume of 0.25 ml (∼20–40 μg of protein/ml); 10 μmcyclazocine was used to define specific binding. Following a 1-h incubation, assays were terminated by filtration through Whatman GF/B filters. Filters were soaked in Ecoscint liquid scintillation mixture (National Diagnostics, Somerville, NJ) prior to determination of filter bound radioactivity using a Beckman LS 1701 scintillation counter. Receptor binding data was analyzed by nonlinear regression using Prism 2.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Protein concentrations were determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay (Hercules, CA), using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Cells were treated with 1 μm Tyr-d-Ala-Gly-Phe-d-Leu (DADL) in serum-free media for various time intervals to study the kinetics of down-regulation. For recovery experiments, cells cultured in serum-free medium were incubated for 18 h in the absence and presence of 1 μm DADL, medium was aspirated and cells were washed three times, and then replenished with serum-free medium lacking agonist. Cells were harvested at 0, 2, 4, 8, and 24 h following removal of DADL, and then assayed for receptor specific binding using 3 nm [3H]ethylketocyclazocine. To assess the effect of pertussis toxin (Ptx, Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD), cells were preincubated with 100 ng/ml Ptx for 3 h in serum-free media followed by overnight treatment with DADL (1 μm). To determine the effect of various membrane-permeable protease inhibitors on agonist-induced receptor down-regulation, cells were pretreated for 1 h with the inhibitors at a concentration of 25 μm. The following inhibitors were tested: proteasomal inhibitors, ZLLL (N-benzyloxycarbonyl-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-leucinal, Peptides International, Louisville, KY), ALLN (N-acetyl-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-norleucinal, Sigma), lactacystin (Peptides International), and PSI (N-benzyloxycarbonyl-l-isoleucyl-γ-t-butyl-l-glutamyl-l-alanyl-l-leucinal, Peptides International); the lysosomal protease and calpain inhibitor, E64d (2S,3S-t-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-3-methylbutane ethyl ester, Peptides International); the lysosomal protease, calpain and trypsin-like protease inhibitor, leupeptin (N-acetyl-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-arginal, Calbiochem); and the caspase inhibitor,N-acetyl-l-aspartyl-l-glutamyl-l-valyl-l-aspartyl-chloromethylketone (caspase-3 inhibitor III, Calbiochem). All protease inhibitors were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, and control cells lacking inhibitors were treated with dimethyl sulfoxide vehicle. For immunoblotting experiments, cells were grown to near confluence in 60-mm dishes. Cell extracts were prepared by incubating the cells in 0.2 ml of lysis buffer consisting of 150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol and protease inhibitor mixture (containing 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, pepstatin A, E-64, bestatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin, Sigma) for 1 h on ice. Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation and the supernatant was used for further analysis. Protein concentrations in supernatants were determined using the Bio-Rad assay with bovine serum albumin as standard. Cell extracts containing ∼20 μg of protein were mixed with an equal volume of gel loading buffer (Bio-Rad) and heated at 40 °C for 5 min. Proteins were resolved using 12 or 15% SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon PSQ PVDF membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were blocked for 1 h in 2.3% dried milk, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20, followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C with mouse anti-FLAG M1 monoclonal antibody (Sigma). Membranes were then washed and incubated with anti-mouse IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 1 h at room temperature and developed using CDP-Star Western blot chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described previously (32Chaturvedi K. Shahrestanifar M. Howells R.D. Mol. Brain Res... 2000; 76: 64-72Google Scholar). Kodak Biomax MR film was used to capture chemiluminescence. Receptor glycosylation was investigated by incubating cell lysates in 150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitor mixture with or without N-glycosidase F (40 units/mg of membrane protein, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) at 37 °C for 3 h. For immunoblotting, treated and untreated lysates were diluted with an equal volume of gel loading buffer, proteins were resolved using 10% SDS-PAGE, and assayed by immunoblotting as described above. For receptor immunoprecipitation, cell extracts were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 30 μl of lysis buffer containing a suspension of anti-FLAG M1 monoclonal antibody conjugated to agarose (Sigma). Following incubation, antibody gel beads were washed three times by centrifugation with lysis buffer and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 40 μl of elution buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, and 5 mm EDTA). Following brief centrifugation, supernatants containing immunopurified receptor protein were mixed with an equal volume of gel loading dye and heated at 40 °C for 5 min. Proteins were resolved using 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. Receptor proteins were detected using anti-FLAG M1 monoclonal antibodies, as described above. Ubiquitinated receptor proteins were visualized with rabbit anti-ubiquitin antibodies (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) followed by goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Santa Cruz). Blots were developed using CDP Star chemiluminescence reagent. For metabolic labeling studies, stably transfected HEK 293 cells expressing FLAG-tagged δ opioid receptors were incubated in serum- and methionine-free minimal essential media containing 90 μCi/ml [35S]methionine for 3 h at 37 °C, then chased with methionine-containing minimal essential media in the absence and presence of the peptide agonist, DADL (1 μm), for 2, 4, 6, 8, and 18 h. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody agarose beads, and resolved using SDS-PAGE. Gels were fixed and dried prior to autoradiography. δ Receptor bands were quantified by excising the receptor band from the gel followed by liquid scintillation counting, and by scanning densitometry of autoradiographic bands using NIH Image software, version 1.61; results were comparable. MAP kinase assays were conducted as described previously (33Chaturvedi K. Jiang X. Christoffers K.H. Chinen N. Bandari P. Raveglia L.F. Ronzoni S. Dondio G. Howells R.D. Mol. Brain Res... 2000; 80: 166-176Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK 293 cells expressing the FLAG-tagged δ receptor were incubated with or without 25 μm ZLLL for 18 h, and then treated with or without DADL (1 μm) for an additional 10 min. Cells were lysed in 150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mmNaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mmCaCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, containing mixtures of phosphatase inhibitors and protease inhibitors (Sigma). Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation and protein concentration in the supernatant was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Equal amounts of protein from each sample were resolved using 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon PSQ PVDF membranes. Membranes were blocked for 1 h in 2.3% dried milk, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20, followed by overnight incubation with mouse monoclonal anti-phospho-MAPK antibody or rabbit anti-MAP kinase antibody (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Membranes were then washed and incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase or goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were washed and developed using CDP Star Western blot chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and Kodak Biomax MR film. Blots were quantified using NIH Image software, version 1.61. [35S]Methionine-labeled opioid receptor proteins were expressed using a coupled in vitrotranscription and translation system (TNT rabbit reticulocyte extracts,Promega, Madison, WI). Plasmids encoding μ and δ opioid receptor cDNAs were transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase and translated with reticulocyte extracts in the presence of [35S]methionine according to conditions recommended by the manufacturer. Luciferase cDNA transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase served as a positive control reaction. Translated proteins were resolved using 15% SDS-PAGE. Gels were fixed, dried, and then exposed to Kodak Biomax MR film for autoradiography. As reported recently (32Chaturvedi K. Shahrestanifar M. Howells R.D. Mol. Brain Res... 2000; 76: 64-72Google Scholar, 33Chaturvedi K. Jiang X. Christoffers K.H. Chinen N. Bandari P. Raveglia L.F. Ronzoni S. Dondio G. Howells R.D. Mol. Brain Res... 2000; 80: 166-176Google Scholar), we have established stable HEK 293 cell lines that express μ and δ opioid receptors with a FLAG epitope at the amino termini. Using [3H]bremazocine as radioligand, theB max values for cell lines expressing epitope-tagged receptors used in the present experiments were ∼5 and 13 pmol/mg of protein for μ and δ opioid receptors, respectively, and apparent dissociation constants (K d) for bremazocine were 1.0 and 0.8 nm, respectively (see TableI).Table IEffect of pertussis toxin on agonist-induced down-regulation of δ and μ opioid receptorsTreatmentδ Receptorμ ReceptorK DB maxB maxratioK DB maxB maxrationmfmol/mg protein%nmfmol/mg protein%Control1.00 ± 0.313,417 ± 2,1070.81 ± 0.15,126 ± 460Agonist1.72 ± 0.41,155 ± 399.1 ± 1.8 1-aAgonist/control.0.68 ± 0.1975 ± 19519.3 ± 3.7 1-aAgonist/control.Ptx1.42 ± 0.234,451 ± 5,585274.0 ± 62 1-bPtx/control.1.02 ± 0.18,106 ± 752162.2 ± 20 1-bPtx/control.Ptx + agonist1.41 ± 0.53,782 ± 69111.0 ± 1.5 1-cPtx + agonist/Ptx.1.11 ± 0.15,654 ± 94169.3 ± 7.7 1-cPtx + agonist/Ptx.HEK 293 cells expressing FLAG-tagged δ or μ opioid receptors were preincubated at 37 °C for 3 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with or without 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin (Ptx), then incubated for 18 h in the absence and presence of 1 μm DAMGO (μ receptors) or DADL (δ receptors). Membrane fractions were prepared and saturation analysis was performed using [3H]bremazocine as radioligand.

Data represent mean ± S.E. of three to four experiments conducted in duplicate. SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis with the anti-FLAG M1 monoclonal antibody revealed that the δ opioid receptor was expressed as two major heterogeneous forms, with apparent molecular masses of ∼55–65 and 130–145 kilodaltons (kDa) in HEK 293 cells (Fig.1). As expected due to its larger mass, the μ opioid receptor migrated more slowly as two major diffuse bands with apparent molecular masses of ∼70–80 and 150–160 kDa. Evidence that δ and μ opioid receptors are glycoproteins was provided by digestion with N-glycosidase F, an amidase that hydrolyzes nearly all types of N-glycan chains from the asparagine inN-linked glycoproteins. N-Glycosidase F treatment of δ and μ opioid receptors increased the mobilities of both bands to species with apparent molecular masses of 34 and 93 kDa for the δ receptor, and 36 and 82 kDa for the μ receptor. The predicted molecular masses for the FLAG-tagged receptors are ∼41 and 45 kDa for the δ and μ opioid receptors, respectively. The reason for the aberrant electrophoretic mobilities of the receptors, even after deglycosylation, is not known at present. The immunoreactive bands with slower mobilities may represent opioid receptor dimers that have been described recently (34Cvejic S. Devi L.A. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 26959-26964Google Scholar, 35Jordan B.A. Devi L.A. Nature.. 1999; 399: 697-700Google Scholar). Prolonged agonist treatment of HEK 293 cells expressing either μ or δ opioid receptors resulted in decreased steady-state receptor levels, as measured by determination of B maxusing saturation binding analysis or by immunoblotting (see below). This agonist-induced decrease in receptor number is the process referred to in this report as receptor down-regulation. We have recently reported that the magnitude of δ receptor down-regulation was dependent on which agonist was employed (33Chaturvedi K. Jiang X. Christoffers K.H. Chinen N. Bandari P. Raveglia L.F. Ronzoni S. Dondio G. Howells R.D. Mol. Brain Res... 2000; 80: 166-176Google Scholar). In the present study, it was found that the extent of μ receptor down-regulation was also dependent on the agonist used (Fig. 2). Overnight treatment with DAMGO resulted in a >80% decrease in the μ receptor B max, while morphine induced only a 45% decrease. Neither ligand altered the apparent dissociation constant of [3H]bremazocine for the μ receptor (untreated K d = 1.1 ± 0.2 nm, DAMGO-treated K d = 1.2 ± 0.1 nm, morphine-treated K d = 0.9 ± 0.2 nm). Overnight treatment with etorphine, DADL, fentanyl, and methadone decreased the μ receptor B max by 70–80%, suggesting that these agonists had an intrinsic efficacy that was similar to that of DAMGO for inducing down-regulation of the μ receptor (data not shown). The kinetics of δ receptor down-regulation was investigated by pulse-chase analysis following metabolic labeling of cells with [35S]methionine. HEK 293 cells expressing FLAG-tagged δ receptors were preincubated at 37 °C with [35S]methionine in serum- and methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 3 h, and then chased with unlabeled methionine-containing medium in the absence and presence of 1 μm DADL. Cell lysates were prepared at various times following the unlabeled methionine chase, immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG M1 monoclonal antibody, and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (Fig. 3). In the absence of agonist, receptor degradation exhibited first-order exponential decay with a rate constant of 0.08 ± 0.02, corresponding to a half-life of 8.7 h. In the presence of DADL, the receptor degradation rate was accelerated significantly with a rate constant of 0.42 ± 0.07 and a half-life of 1.6 h. The kinetics of receptor down-regulation was also examined by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 4). Stable HEK 293 cells expressing epitope-tagged receptors were incubated in serum-free medium at 37 °C with 1 μm DADL for various time intervals ranging from 0.5 to 18 h, and cell lysates were then analyzed by immunoblot analysis using the M1 monoclonal antibody. The level of δ receptor protein remained steady until 2–4 h after DADL treatment. Levels then decreased progressively at 4, 6, and 18 h after agonist administration to 77, 38, and 4% of zero time controls, respectively. The time course of μ receptor down-regulation was similar, although a decrease in receptor protein was already apparent at the 2-h time point. The rate of recovery of δ receptor expression following agonist-induced down-regulation was measured by treating δ receptor-expressing HEK 293 cells with 1 μm DADL for 18 h, then assaying receptor binding at various time points following removal of the agonist from the media. As displayed in Fig.5, down-regulation was readily reversible upon removal of agonist. After an 18-h exposure of cells to DADL, receptor levels were reduced to 13% of untreated control cells. At 2, 4, 8, and 24 h following agonist removal, receptor levels were 31, 50, 69, and 95% of untreated control cells, respectively. To evaluate the role of Gi and Go heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins in the receptor down-regulation pathway, cells expressing FLAG-tagged μ or δ opioid receptors were pretreated with or without 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin in serum-free media for 3 h at 37 °C, followed by overnight incubation in the absence and presence of 1 μm DADL. Receptor levels in cell lysates were compared by immunoblot analysis and quantified using NIH Image software. Marked differences between μ and δ opioid receptors were observed regarding the"

This differential splicing has been shown to modulate interactions of neurofascin with axonal NrCAM, F11, axonin-1, and the extracellular matrix protein tenascin-R, and to influence neurite extension in vitro (10Volkmer H.

Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1059-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Specific isoforms of neurofascin are localized to initial axon segments of Purkinje cells and to the nodes of Ranvier of myelinated nerves, where they interact with the cytoskeleton adapter-protein ankyrin-G (12Davis J.Q.

In particular, an oligodendrocyte-specific form of neurofascin (termed NF155) was found to localize to the paranodal region, whereas a neuron-specific form (NF186) was confined to the nodal region (13Tait S.

Interaction with ankyrin requires a highly conserved sequence within the cytoplasmic tails of L1 subgroup members and is inhibited by its tyrosine phosphorylation as demonstrated for neurofascin (19Garver T.D.

Furthermore, palmitoylation of neurofascin at a highly conserved cysteine residue in its membrane-spanning segment might affect the targeting of neurofascin to specialized plasma membrane microdomains (22Ren Q. Bennett V. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1839-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). L1CAM-mediated cellular processes may also be regulated by changes in the expression levels of CAMs on the cell surface. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the endocytic motif YRSL, which represents a binding site of the AP-2 clathrin adaptor complex, regulates not only the internalization of the neuronal L1 form but probably also of NrCAM and neurofascin (23Kamiguchi H. Long K.E. Pendergast M. Schaefer A.W. Rapoport I. Kirchhausen T. Lemmon V. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 5311-5321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Kamiguchi H. Lemmon V. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3749-3756Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, cross-linking of L1 expressed in heterologous cells has been shown to trigger the activation of ERK2, a component of the MAPK signal cascade. ERK2 activation appears to be coupled with L1 internalization and phosphorylation of two cytoplasmic serines that are conserved in the L1 subgroup (25Schaefer A.W. Kamiguchi H. Wong E.V. Beach C.M. Landreth G. Lemmon V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37965-37973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar).Although the cytoplasmic tails are the most conserved segments of the L1-type molecules, there are also some differences, particularly at their COOH termini. These differences might provide the structural basis for individual intracellular interactions and therefore distinct functional features within the L1 subgroup. To identify proteins that might mediate signaling, spatial targeting, or trafficking of L1-type molecules by direct interaction with their cytoplasmic segments, we performed yeast two-hybrid screens of brain cDNA libraries. Here, we demonstrate that syntenin-1 is an intracellular binding partner of neurofascin but not of L1 or NrCAM. Syntenin-1 contains two PDZ domains. PDZ domains are multifunctional protein-binding modules, which were first identified in PSD-95, DlgA, andZO-1, and are now found in a growing number of other cytoplasmic proteins (26Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). The PDZ domains of syntenin-1 have been previously shown to interact with the COOH termini of syndecans, class B ephrins, EphA7, pro-TGF-α, neurexins, and the anion exchanger AE2 (27Grootjans J.J.

In this study, we identified the second PDZ domain of syntenin-1 as a binding site of the COOH terminus of neurofascin and of several other transmembrane proteins mentioned above. Neurofascin was found not to interact with syntenin-2α or -2β, two isoforms of a novel protein closely related to syntenin-1. Furthermore, we observed a homo- and heterodimerization of syntenin-1 and syntenin-2 that appears to involve larger portions of these molecules. This capacity for self-association might be crucial for homo- and heterotypic clustering of neurofascin and other syntenin-binding proteins.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we identified the PDZ domains containing molecule syntenin-1 as an intracellular neurofascin binding partner. The interaction of syntenin-1 with the cytoplasmic domain of neurofascin was observed in the yeast two-hybrid system and confirmed by overlay assay, by surface plasmon resonance measurements, and by the colocalization of both proteins in transfected cells. In addition to rat syntenin-1, we isolated a novel human syntenin-1-related molecule, syntenin-2, which can be expressed as a long isoform (syntenin-2α) that has the same domain organization as syntenin-1 and as a short isoform (syntenin-2β) that contains the PDZ-tandem but lacks mostly the NH2-terminal third. Syntenin-2α but not syntenin-2β was shown to interact with neurexins, but neither with neurofascin nor with several other transmembrane proteins. Syntenin-1 and syntenin-2 both were able to self-associate and to interact with each other in the two-hybrid system. The homodimerization of syntenin-1 was confirmed by coimmunoprecipiation experiments and gel filtration chromatography. Although the binding sites sufficient for the homodimerization of syntenin-1 are still unknown, we consider a homotypic binding mode, in which the PDZ tandem and at least a part of the NH2-terminal domain are essential. The binding of the syntenin-1 deletion mutant NΔ101 to wild-type syntenin-1 and its failure to interact with itself exclude the possibility that dimers are formed by association of the NH2 termini of two syntenin-1 molecules. More likely, binding of the NH2 terminus of syntenin-1 to an unknown site within the COOH-terminal two thirds of the molecule enables an antiparallel or “head to tail” association.We demonstrated that other vertebrate members of the L1 subgroup of cell adhesion molecules bind neither syntenin-1 nor syntenin-2. Interestingly, syntenin-1 was also able to interact in yeast with the nervous system-specific isoform of the cytoplasmic tail ofDrosophila L1-type protein neuroglian. This finding raises the question whether there is a syntenin-1-like molecule in flies. Because neuroglian has been considered as the sole L1-type molecule inDrosophila (3Hortsch M. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 15: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), it might be able to substitute for several functions that are conferred by diverse L1-type molecules (neurofascin, NrCAM, L1, CHL1) in vertebrates, including binding to a putativeDrosophila syntenin-1-related protein. Although we failed to identify a syntenin-1-like protein in the completeDrosophila genomic data base, another PDZ protein might interact with the long neuroglian isoform in the insect cells.Although the majority of known PDZ domains bind to specific COOH-terminal peptides of transmembrane molecules, several of them interact with internal sequences or with other PDZ domains. Here, using site-directed mutagenesis, we mapped the binding sites to the COOH terminus of neurofascin and to the PDZ2 domain of syntenin-1. Moreover, we found that PDZ2 is also responsible for the interaction with neuroglian-180 and several other transmembrane proteins that were previously reported to bind syntenin-1. One of them is pro-TGF-α, which, together with neurofascin and neuroglian-180, contains a threonine or a serine at the COOH-terminal position −2 and belongs therefore to the class I PDZ-binding proteins (38Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). Another group of syntenin-1-interacting proteins tested here consists of syndecans, neurexins I–III, class B ephrins, and EphA7, all of which belong to the class II PDZ-binding proteins that contain an aromatic or hydrophobic residue at position −2. On the basis of their sequences, the PDZ domains of syntenin-1 should interact with the class II-specific sequence motifs (28Grootjans J.J. Reekmans G. Ceulemans H. David G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19933-19941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Indeed, affinity of syntenin-1 to class II COOH termini appears to be higher than to class I COOH termini. Nevertheless, our data together with the observations of Fernandez-Larrea et al. (29Fernandez L.J. Merlos S.A. Urena J.M. Baselga J. Arribas J. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 423-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) on pro-TGF-α strongly support that the syntenin-1 PDZ2 domain also binds to specific class I COOH termini. Screens of oriented peptide libraries and yeast two-hybrid studies have demonstrated that PDZ binding may require side-chain interactions in addition to those at the COOH-terminal amino acid positions 0 and −2 (38Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar, 41Hock B. Bohme B. Karn T. Yamamoto T. Kaibuchi K. Holtrich U. Holland S. Pawson T. Rubsamen W.H. Strebhardt K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9779-9784Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Here, we showed that binding to syntenin-1 PDZ2 domain is also determined by the −3 residue of the ligand. NrCAM containing the COOH-terminal PDZ-binding motif SXV-COOH and an asparagine residue at position −3 failed to bind syntenin-1, whereas the single substitution Y(−3)N within the sequence of neurofascin abolished its interaction with syntenin-1 in yeast. Moreover, the reciprocal substitution N(−3)Y within the COOH-terminal sequence of the NrCAM enabled this mutant to bind. These findings, however, leave open the possibility for other critical positions in addition to 0, −1, and −3, as well as the question of the structural basis of the unusual ligand recognition by the syntenin-1 PDZ2 domain. In the future, the issue of the binding specificity of the syntenin-1 PDZ1 domain might be addressed by screening for proteins interacting with it.In accordance with other publications on syntenin-1, the two-hybrid construct composed only of the PDZ2 domain was found not to interact with neurofascin nor with other transmembrane proteins tested here. How might this inability of the isolated PDZ2 domain to bind be explained? The overall structural integrity of the syntenin-1 molecule might be required either directly, for its interactions with transmembrane proteins by means of multiple ligand binding sites, or indirectly, for the stabilization of the active conformation of the PDZ2 domain. In this context, Grootjans et al. (28Grootjans J.J. Reekmans G. Ceulemans H. David G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19933-19941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) proposed recently a cooperative binding mode of specific class II peptides with both PDZ domains of syntenin-1. In our experiments, mutation in the carboxylate-binding loop of PDZ1, in opposite to that of PDZ2, hardly impaired the interactions of syntenin-1 with any of the tested transmembrane proteins. In contrast, interactions of class I COOH termini with syntenin-1 lacking its NH2-terminal domain (NΔ101) were abolished, whereas the binding of class II COOH termini to this mutant was retained. As it was shown that this deletion construct does not self-associate, dimerization of syntenin-1 might be considered as a prerequisite for interactions with class I but not with class II COOH-terminal peptides. Although there is currently no direct evidence proving this binding model, future studies might reveal whether the homodimerization allosterically enhances the affinity of the PDZ2 to specific ligands of class II and even enables this domain for interactions with class I proteins such as neurofascin and pro-TGF-α.Because we are primarily concentrating here on the molecular aspects of syntenin interactions, the biological functions of these interactions, in particular between syntenin-1 and neurofascin in the developing nervous system, remain to be established. PDZ domains have been investigated in a number of so-called scaffolding proteins that are restricted to polarized subcellular sites where they cluster transmembrane and cytosolic components to multimolecular complexes (42Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 432-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). For example, in the nervous system, PDZ-containing proteins have been implicated in the targeting and clustering of pre- and postsynaptic proteins (43Garner C.C. Kindler S. Gundelfinger E.D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 44Garner C.C. Nash J. Huganir R.L. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 274-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). In particular, the self-association of syntenin-1 and its heterodimerization with syntenin-2 might suggest a function to cluster neurofascin and other transmembrane proteins to subdomains of the plasma membrane of neural cells. However, syntenin-1 was not found to co-cluster with neurofascin at nodes of Ranvier in the optic nerve of adult mouse, 3M. Koroll and F. G. Rathjen, unpublished observations. making a scaffolding function of syntenin-1 at least at this site less likely. On the other hand, homo- and heterodimerization of syntenin-1 may allow a large spectrum of transmembrane receptors belonging to different protein families to be assembled together with neurofascin.Neurofascin has been shown to be implicated in axonal growth and fasciculation (10Volkmer H. Zacharias U. Norenberg U. Rathjen F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1083-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 11Volkmer H. Leuschner R. Zacharias U. Rathjen F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1059-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 35Rathjen F.G. Wolff J.M. Chang S. Bonhoeffer F. Raper J.A. Cell. 1987; 51: 841-849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). These dynamic cellular processes require a mechanism to regulate the cell surface expression of neurofascin. One possible way to modulate the number of neurofascin molecules on the neural surface might be to internalize or to target it to specific cell surface domains. Insertion and removal of plasma membrane components are part of the growth cone machinery, and evidences have been accumulated in the past that vesicular transport and the subcellular targeting of proteins in neurons are involved in neurite extension (45Kamiguchi H. Lemmon V. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3676-3686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because syntenin-1 appears to be necessary for correct targeting of pro-TGF-α to the surface of Chinese hamster ovary cells (29Fernandez L.J. Merlos S.A. Urena J.M. Baselga J. Arribas J. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 423-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and is colocalized with internalized transferrin in early apical recycling endosomes in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (46Fialka I. Steinlein P. Ahorn H. Bock G. Burbelo P.D. Haberfellner M. Lottspeich F. Paiha K. Pasquali C. Huber L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26233-26239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), it might function by linking bound neurofascin or other transmembrane proteins to trafficking or recycling pathways also in neural cells. The identification of syntenin-1 as an intracellular binding partner of neurofascin may allow us to study the removal and insertion of neurofascin in the context of neurite extension during early neural development or its targeting to axonal initial segments and to the nodes of Ranvier in the differentiated nervous system. Further insights into the functions of syntenin-1 and -2 might also be obtained by identifying cytoplasmic proteins linking them to trafficking or signaling pathways. Neurofascin is a member of the L1 subgroup of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell adhesion molecules, which also includes L1 (NgCAM)1 itself, CHL1, NrCAM in vertebrates, neuroglian in insects, and tractin in leeches. These transmembrane glycoproteins share a well conserved overall domain organization with six immunoglobulin-like and four to five fibronectin type III (FNIII)-like domains. Their diverse homo- and heterophilic interactions mediate cell-cell contacts and can promote neuronal migration, axonal growth, and fasciculation in the developing nervous system (1Brummendorf T.

Here we show that, unlike IκBα, IκBβ and IκBε appear to sequester p65 or c-Rel in the cytoplasm by inhibiting nuclear import.

May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4550) Google Scholar). In most cell types these proteins are sequestered in the cell cytoplasm complexed to a family of inhibitory IκB proteins (2May M.J. Ghosh S. Semin.

Cellular activation results in IκB degradation, which leaves the DNA-binding protein free to translocate to the nucleus and activate gene expression. Because of the widespread effects of NF-κB activation, its localization in the cytoplasm must be strictly maintained. IκBα-deficient mice are a striking example of the importance of NF-κB sequestration in the cytoplasm; these mice die of a wasting disease that has been attributed to tumor necrosis factor-α production (4Klement J.F. Rice N.R. Car B.D. Abbondanzo S.J. Powers G.D. Bhatt P.H. Chen C.H. Rosen C.A. Stewart C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2341-2349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2736-2746Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Nuclear factor-κB has also been detected in several diseased tissues, where it has been proposed to contribute to the pathology in part by inhibiting apoptosis (6Foo S.Y. Nolan G.P. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 229-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar,7Rayet B. Gelinas C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6938-6947Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). The association of Rel with IκBα has been proposed to hide the NLS of Rel proteins (8Beg A.A. Ruben S.M. Scheinman R.I. Haskill S. Rosen C.A. Baldwin Jr., A.S.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), thereby precluding nuclear entry of the transcription factor. In addition to hiding the NLS, association with IκBα also inhibits DNA binding by NF-κB. Thus, association of NF-κB with IκB ensures that NF-κB-dependent gene transcription occurs only when cells are stimulated appropriately. Recently, IκBα has been shown to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Nuclear entry is mediated by a nonclassical NLS located in the second ankyrin repeat of IκBα (10Sachdev S. Bagchi S.

A second nuclear export sequence has been identified at the C terminus of IκBα, but its functional significance is unclear at present (16Ossareh-Nazari B. Bachelerie F. Dargemont C. Science. 1997; 278: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar, 17Prigent M. Barlat I. Langen H. Dargemont C. J. Biol.

The observation that cytoplasmic sequestration of p65·RelA also required nuclear export was unexpected and led to a reassessment of the existing sequestration model. We and others (13Johnson C.

Biol. 2000; 20: 2269-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) have proposed that the cytoplasmic location of Rel proteins by IκBα is a dynamic process that depends on the active export of Rel·IκBα complexes out of the nucleus. In our earlier studies we also showed that IκBβ and IκBε, unlike IκBα, do not shuttle via the CRM1 pathway. Specifically, the subcellular distribution of GFP-IκBβ or GFP-IκBε in yeast was not affected by a mutation in the CRM1 gene, and leptomycin B (LMB) treatment did not alter the location of these proteins in transiently transfected mammalian cells. In addition, we did not detect an association between CRM1 protein and either IκBβ or IκBε in a yeast two-hybrid assay (15Tam W.F. Lee L.H. Davis L. Sen R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2269-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In this paper we demonstrate that cytoplasmic retention of Rel proteins by IκBβ and IκBε involves sequestration rather than tilting the balance of nuclear import and export as is the case with IκBα. Furthermore, although newly synthesized IκBβ can enter the nucleus, it cannot restore nuclear Rel proteins to the cytoplasm. These observations suggest that IκBβ and IκBε function differently from IκBα. D5 h3 T hybridoma cells and A20 mature B cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and RPMI 1640 medium, respectively, with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 50 βm β-mercaptoethanol and antibiotics. COS cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% newborn calf serum and antibiotics. Yeast strain W303 and its transformants were generally grown in synthetic medium with the appropriate amino acid and nitrogen base supplement. pGFP-p65 and pCDNA3-HA-IκBα have been described previously (15Tam W.F.

Biol. 2000; 20: 2269-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). pGFP-cRel contains full-length murine cRel in frame after GFP. pCDNA3-Myc-IκBβ and pCDNA3-Myc-IκBε were made by inserting full-length murine IκBβ and IκBε cDNA, respectively, in frame behind a c-Myc tag (MEQKLISEEDL). Yeast galactose-inducible plasmid encoding GFP-p65 and copper-inducible HA-IκBα (pCuIκBα) have been described previously (15Tam W.F. Lee L.H. Davis L. Sen R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2269-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The copper-inducible HA-IκBβ was made by replacing the IκBα gene with a murine IκBβ full-length gene in the same vector. All plasmids used in this study were confirmed by sequencing, and expression of proteins was verified by immunoblotting. The procedures for immunostaining adherence cells were the same as described previously (15Tam W.F. Lee L.H. Davis L. Sen R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2269-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). For staining suspension cells (T and B cells), the procedures were also as described previously (18Feske S. Draeger R. Peter H.H. Eichmann K. Rao A. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The proteases Asp-N and Lys-C were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Proteases were used according to the manufacturers' specifications. The subcellular localization of GFP and the immunofluorescence signals were observed by fluorescence microscopy (Axiophot II, Zeiss) with a GFP generic filter, fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, and DAPI filter. The nuclear export property of IκBα is essential for cytoplasmic location of Rel proteins. However, IκBβ and IκBε, which are not nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling proteins, can also effectively localize Rel proteins to the cytoplasm. One possibility was that cytoplasmic retention by IκBβ/ε may be mediated by export determinants in the Rel proteins. To test this possibility, we coexpressed green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged Rel proteins with IκBβ or IκBε in COS cells and assayed the location of Rel proteins by GFP fluorescence. Both p65 and c-Rel (data not shown) were located in the cytoplasm in the presence of IκBβ (Fig.1 A, left panel). However, these complexes did not translocate to the nucleus when the cells were treated with LMB, an inhibitor of CRM1-mediated nuclear export (Fig. 1 A, right panel). Therefore, CRM1 was not involved in determining the subcellular location of these complexes. Similar results were obtained with IκBε. As expected, IκBα-associated p65, or c-Rel (data not shown), was predominantly nuclear in LMB-treated cells (Fig. 1 A, top row). Thus, cytoplasmic retention by IκBβ and IκBε may involve true sequestration rather than a balance between import and export as is the case with IκBα. These observations were confirmed in mammalian cells by investigating the shuttling dynamics of endogenous Rel·IκB complexes. Endogenous proteins in mature B (A20) and mature T (D5 h3) cell lines (data not shown) were visualized by staining fixed, permeabilized cells with anti-IκBα, or anti-IκBβ, antibodies in the presence or absence of LMB to block nuclear export. In untreated cells both IκBs were predominantly cytoplasmic (Fig. 1 B, left panel). A 1-h LMB treatment induced considerable nuclear translocation of IκBα but not IκBβ (Fig. 1 B, right panel). Because most of the cellular IκB is associated with Rel proteins, we concluded that Rel·IκBα complexes shuttled continuously, but Rel·IκBβ complexes did not. Lack of Rel·IκBβ shuttling is consistent with sequestration being the major mechanism of cytoplasmic retention by IκBβ. We found more direct evidence for differences in interaction between IκBα or IκBβ and p65 through partial proteolysis assays. p65 protein was expressed by transient transfection in BOSC 23 cells in the presence of HA-IκBα or Myc-IκBβ. The p65·IκB complex was immunoprecipitated from whole cell extract with anti-IκBα antibody or anti-IκBβ antibody and digested with different proteases. The p65 fragments were detected using antibodies directed against the N or C terminus of p65 to estimate the cut site from one or the other end of p65. Only two of seven proteases showed significant differences in the pattern of p65 fragments generated in the presence of IκBα or IκBβ. p65 alone generated one major fragment when treated with Asp-N of ∼28 kDa when assayed from the C terminus (Fig.2, lanes 5 and 6); this corresponds to a cut site located 293 amino acids from the N terminus (Fig. 2, top). In the p65·IκBα complex, two bands of approximately equal intensity were seen (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 2), whereas in the p65·IκBβ complex the faster mobility (23 kDa) band was enhanced. Therefore, cutting at residue 293 was reduced in the p65·IκBα complex compared with p65 alone, allowing the detection of the cut site at residue 360 (which was not evident with p65 alone). This is presumably because of the protection of the p65 NLS by IκBα, which lies close to residue 293 between residues 301 and 304. Cutting at 293 was further inhibited in the p65·IκBβ complex as shown by a relative increase in the intensity of the 23-kDa compared with the 28-kDa band. These observation suggest that the region around residue 293, including the NLS, is more protected in the p65·IκBβ complex. p65·IκBα and p65·IκBβ complexes were also probed using the protease Lys-C and p65 antibodies directed against the N terminus. Increased cutting at the residue 425 site was evident in the IκBβ complex compared with the IκBα complex (Fig. 2, lanes 8and 11). These observations also support the interpretation that IκBα and IκBβ interact differently with p65. We suggest that the p65 NLS is better hidden by IκBβ than by IκBα. The simplest interpretation of the experiments described above was that Rel·IκBβ complexes did not enter the nucleus because the nuclear localization sequences in both proteins were very effectively hidden in the complex. Therefore, the question of nuclear export did not arise. However, the question remained that if any Rel·IκBβ complexes formed in the nucleus, would IκBβ be able to bring the complex out to the cytoplasm? Such a situation may occur at the end of cell stimulation when Rel proteins are already nuclear and new IκBs are synthesized to terminate NF-κB-dependent gene expression. We addressed this question in a yeast model. We have previously shown that export-dependent cytoplasmic localization of p65 by IκBα can be recapitulated in yeast (15Tam W.F. Lee L.H. Davis L. Sen R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2269-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). To test the properties of IκBβ, we coexpressed IκBβ and GFP-p65 from galactose-inducible promoters in wild type or Crm1p-deficient (crm1-1) yeast strains. GFP-p65 was located in the cytoplasm under these conditions in both strains (data not shown), correlating closely with the observations in mammalian cells (Fig. 1). In contrast, when GFP-p65 and IκBα were coexpressed in crm1-1 cells, the complex remained in the nucleus (15Tam W.F. Lee L.H. Davis L. Sen R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2269-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). To compare the ability of IκBα and IκBβ to remove nuclear p65, we expressed GFP-p65 using a galactose-inducible promoter, followed by either IκBα, or IκBβ, from a copper-inducible promoter. A 3-h induction with galactose was followed by growth in glucose to suppress GFP-p65 transcription. In cells that did not contain IκB expression vectors, GFP fluorescence was strictly nuclear. Even when cells contained either IκBα or IκBβ expression plasmids, GFP fluorescence was largely restricted to the nucleus, although whole cell expression was observed in ∼15% of the cells (Fig. 3,middleand bottom rows, left panel). Cytoplasmic expression under these conditions was most likely due to basal IκBα, or IκBβ, expression from the copper-inducible promoter. Induction of IκBα with copper for 2 h resulted in a significant redistribution of GFP-p65 to the cytoplasm, indicating that the newly synthesized IκBα exported nuclear GFP-p65 to the cytoplasm (Fig. 3, middle row, right panel). This was mediated by Crm1p because it did not occur in thecrm1-1 strain that contains a mutated CRM1 gene (data not shown). In contrast, there was little redistribution of GFP-p65 after secondary induction of IκBβ (Fig. 3,bottom row, right panel). The small increase in whole cell GFP-p65 expression was probably because of residual GFP-p65 translation during IκBβ induction, which resulted in its cytoplasmic sequestration. These observations indicate that IκBβ cannot remove nuclear Rel proteins to the cytoplasm. We found that p65 or c-Rel associated with IκBβ or IκBε were retained in the cytoplasm, although these IκBs did not shuttle via the CRM1 pathway. We suggest that IκBs, unlike IκBα, sequester rather than shuttle Rel proteins, which implies that there is no available NLS in the Rel·IκBβ (or IκBε) complexes to induce nuclear entry. Conversely, Rel·IκBα complexes must have an available NLS to shuttle. We hypothesize that the Rel and not the IκB component provides the functional NLS of a Rel·IκB complex. Thus, IκBβ or IκBε must hide the Rel NLS more effectively than IκBα. Evidence in favor of this idea was obtained from partial proteolytic studies of p65·IκB complexes. The sequestration mechanism is based on the lack of an effect of leptomycin B or a mutated CRM1 gene in Rel protein localization by IκBβ. Alternatively, these results could indicate that Rel·IκBβ complexes shuttled by a CRM1-independent pathway. To test this theory, we generated nuclear Rel·IκBβ complexes and determined whether they could reach the cytoplasm by an unidentified pathway. As shown in Fig. 3, IκBβ-mediated GFP-p65 export was inefficient compared with IκBα. We conclude that IκBβ is not an export chaperone like IκBα. Consequently, IκBβ cannot efficiently down-regulate nuclear Rel proteins to restore the resting state of the cell. These results highlight the functional differences between IκBα and IκBβ. Cheng et al. (19Cheng J.D. Ryseck R.P. Attar R.M. Dambach D. Bravo R. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1055-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) showed that substituting IκBβ for the IκBα gene compensated for the most obvious defects in IκBα−/− mice. They concluded that IκBα and IκBβ were functionally similar and that regulation of expression accounted for most of the phenotype of IκBα-deficient mice. Our contrasting conclusion regarding the mechanism of IκBα and IκBβ function is not at odds with the biological results. Clearly, if sufficient IκBβ is synthesized in a cell, it can retain Rel proteins in the cytoplasm, albeit by a mechanism different from IκBα. The biological results show that retention of Rel proteins by either mechanism is good enough to rescue lethality. That IκBβ is a less efficient nuclear export chaperone than IκBα may be manifest under conditions that were not directly assayed, such as during an immune response or chronic inflammation. We suggest that control of such situations may require the active export-dependent reduction of NF-κB activity."

The WS gene encodes a protein with helicase and exonuclease activities. Our previous studies indicated that the Werner syndrome protein (WRN) interacts with Ku, a heterodimeric factor of 70- and 80-kDa subunits implicated in the repair of double strand DNA breaks. Moreover, we demonstrated that Ku70/80 strongly stimulates and alters WRN exonuclease activity. In this report, we investigate further the association between WRN and Ku70/80. First, using various WRN deletion mutants we show that 50 amino acids at the amino terminus are required and sufficient to interact with Ku70/80. In addition, our data indicate that the region of Ku80 between amino acids 215 and 276 is necessary for binding to WRN. Then, we show that the amino-terminal region of WRN from amino acid 1 to 388, which comprise the exonuclease domain, can be efficiently stimulated by Ku to degrade DNA substrates, indicating that the helicase domain and the carboxyl-terminal tail are not required for the stimulatory process. Finally, using gel shift assays, we demonstrate that Ku recruits WRN to DNA. Taken together, these results suggest that Ku-mediated activation of WRN exonuclease activity may play an important role in a cellular pathway that requires processing of DNA ends.

On the other hand, the amino-terminal region of WRN is quite unique among this family of helicases because it contains a sequence that resembles the exonuclease domain of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase I and RNase D (11Mushegian A.R.

These results indicated that in the presence of Ku, WRN degradation of 3′-recessed strand of a partial DNA duplex is strongly stimulated. In addition, Ku alters the specificity of WRN so that the blunt end DNA duplex and 3′-protruding DNA are also hydrolyzed by WRN exonuclease. Ku is a 70- and 80-kDa heterodimer that binds to the ends of double strand DNA and translocates along the DNA in an ATP-independent manner, allowing several Ku heterodimers to bind to a single DNA molecule (17Devries E.W.

Hardin J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 375-379Google Scholar, 21Karran P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 23Gottlieb T.M. Jackson S.P.

The subsequent steps in the end-joining process are then thought to require the recruitment of specific activities necessary for the processing and ligation of DNA ends (25Baumann P. West S.C. Proc.

Although factors such as XRCC4 and DNA ligase IV have been shown to be required for the ligation step, the processing of DNA ends is still poorly understood, and the identity of the nucleases involved in this process remains to be defined. Interestingly, the finding that Ku interacts with and stimulates the activity of the WRN exonuclease suggests that WRN may be one of the factors that function in the processing of broken DNA ends. In this study, to understand better the functional relevance of this finding, we have characterized the interaction of WRN with Ku and DNA ends. First, we show that Ku interacts with the extreme amino terminus of WRN, from amino acid 1 to 50, whereas the central region of Ku80, from amino acid 215 to 276, is necessary for binding to WRN. Then, we demonstrate that Ku can efficiently stimulate the exonuclease activity of an amino-terminal mutant WRN (WRNΔC388; amino acids 1–388), indicating that the helicase and carboxyl-terminal domains of WRN are dispensable for Ku-stimulated processing of DNA ends. Moreover, using electrophoretic mobility shift assays we show that WRN forms a strong complex with Ku on DNA. Recombinant FLAG-WRN and a series of FLAG-WRN deletion mutants were purified as described in Ref16Li B. Comai L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28349-28352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar. Baculoviruses expressing recombinant FLAG epitope-tagged WRN were used to infect Sf9 cells. Whole cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (10 mm Hepes pH 7.5, 100 mmNaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). FLAG-WRN was purified through a DEAE-cellulose column and by affinity chromatography on anti-FLAG resin. Histidine-tagged Ku70 and Ku80 were coexpressed in Sf9 cells, and the Ku70/80 heterodimer was purified by metal affinity resin (Talon, CLONTECHBiotech) and DNA cellulose chromatography. The plasmid containing the WRN cDNA with a substitution at amino acid 82 (Asp → Ala; WRN82A) was constructed using a polymerase chain reaction-based strategy. The open reading frame with amino acids 1–82A, and 82A-311 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the following DNA primers: 5′-CGGCCATATGAGTGAAAAAAAATTGGA-3′/5′-TGGCCACTCCATGGCAAATCCCACC-3′ and 5′-TGGTGGGATT TGCCATGGAGTGGC-3′/5′-AAAGGATCCATGGGCCTCAGTTCAGTCTCA-3′. The amplified fragments were digested with NdeI andNcoI and subcloned into pRSET-A vector. AnNdeI-EcoRV fragment containing a substitution at position 82 (Asp → Ala) was then cloned into pcDNA-FLAG-WRN. Full-length WRN cDNA containing the D82A substitution was subcloned into the NdeI-NotI sites of pVL1392-FLAG-WRN. Recombinant DNA was purified and transfected into Sf9 cells with linearized baculovirus DNA (BaculoGold, PharMingen) to generate the recombinant baculovirus expressing FLAG epitope-tagged WRN82A. EcoRI-digested full-length Ku80 cDNA fragments were subcloned in-frame into theEcoRI site of pCDNA3.1-HisC. This allows different subdomains of Ku80 to be expressed in vitro under the control of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter. These constructs were then subjected to in vitro transcription-translation in the presence of [35S]methionine (NEN Life Science Products) using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate translation system (Promega). 2 μg of FLAG-WRN was immobilized on FLAG beads and then incubated with 15 μl of in vitro translated Ku80 mutants and 135 μl of buffer containing 10 mm Hepes pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 0.2% Nonidet P-40. After extensive washes, resin-bound proteins were released by boiling in SDS-sample buffer and electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by autoradiography. Mutant WRNs were generated by insertion of the appropriate cDNA sequences into either pGEX-2T or pGEX-3X vectors and expressed as GST fusion proteins in E. coli [(GST-WRN(1–50), GST-WRN(50–749), and GST-WRN(150–749); numbers represent amino acid residues spanning the fusion protein)]. 4 μg of each purified GST fusion protein and FLAG-WRN were immobilized on the appropriate affinity beads (glutathione or FLAG resins) and then incubated with 500 μl of cell lysates prepared from Sf9 cells expressing Ku80 (the concentration of Ku80 in the extract was estimated at ∼3 ng/μl). After extensive washing, bound proteins were eluted from the beads using BCO buffer (1 m KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 1 mmdithiothreitol) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-Ku80 antibodies. In a similar assay, 4 μg of each WRN GST fusion protein and FLAG-WRN were immobilized on beads and then incubated with 500 μl of lysates from Sf9 cell coinfected with baculoviruses expressing Ku70 and Ku80. After extensive washes, the bound proteins were released from the beads using BCO buffer, and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. DNA exonuclease activity was measured as described in (16Li B. Comai L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28349-28352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar): 20-oligomer A1 (CGCTAGCAATATTCTGCAGC), 20-oligomer A2 (GCTGCAGAATATTGCTAGCG) complementary to A1, and 46-oligomer A3 (GCGCGGAAGCTTGGCTGCAGAATAT TGCTAGCGGGAAATCGGCGCG) partially complementary to A1. Oligonucleotides were labeled at the 5′-end with [32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The appropriate oligonucleotides were annealed by boiling followed by slow cooling to room temperature. Reaction mixtures contained 40 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 4 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 40 fmol of DNA substrate (100,000 cpm), and 100 fmol each of Ku70, Ku80, Ku70/80, WRNΔC388, WRN, and WRN82A in a final volume of 10 μl. The reaction mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 10 min, and each reaction was then terminated by the addition of 2 μl of a 95% formamide solution. After incubation at 95 °C for 3 min, the DNA products were resolved by either 12% or 16% polyacrylamide-urea gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. 40-mer (B1) (GATTTCCCGCTAGCAATATTCTGCAGCCAAGCTTCCGCGC) was labeled using [32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase and then annealed to a partially complementary 46-mer (A3). 32P-Labeled DNA (80 fmol, 200,000 cpm) was incubated with increasing amounts (100–300 fmol) of Ku and full-length WRN in 10 μl of buffer (10 mmTris-HCl pH 7.5, 80 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol) at 25 °C for 10 min. Then, the samples were resolved by electrophoresis through a 4% polyacrylamide gel at 10 V/cm in the cold room. The gels were dried on Whatman 3MM paper and subjected to autoradiography. For gel supershift assays, 200 fmol of Ku and 200 fmol of WRN were first preincubated with DNA substrates at 25 °C for 10 min under the conditions described above. Then, 200 ng of goat polyclonal Ku80 antibodies (Santa Cruz), goat polyclonal β-actin antibodies (Santa Cruz), or rabbit polyclonal WRN antibodies (Novus), was added to the appropriate reaction mixture. After a 10-min incubation at 25 °C, the samples were loaded on a polyacrylamide gel and processed as described above. We have shown previously that the amino-terminal region of WRN interacts with Ku80 (16Li B. Comai L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28349-28352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). To identify the minimal amino acid domain of WRN necessary for this protein-protein interaction, we performed pull-down assays using GST-WRN fusion proteins containing different segments of the amino-terminal region of WRN (GST-WRN(1−50), GST-WRN(50−749), and GST-WRN(150−749)) (Fig. 1 A). In addition, full-length FLAG-WRN was used in the assay as positive control. Each GST fusion protein and FLAG-WRN was immobilized on either glutathione or FLAG beads and used in pull-down assays with lysates from Sf9 cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus expressing Ku80. After extensive washes, the bound products were resolved on a SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies against Ku80. As expected, Ku80 interacted with FLAG-tagged WRN (Fig.1 B, lane 5). In addition, Ku80 was pulled down by the GST fusion protein containing the region of WRN from amino acid 1 to 50 (lane 2), whereas GST fusion proteins containing WRN amino acids 50–749 (lane 4), amino acids 150–749 (lane 3), or a control GST protein (lane 1) failed to interact with Ku80. These results indicate that the region of WRN between amino acids 1 and 50 is necessary and sufficient for binding to Ku80. To demonstrate further that this region of WRN interacted with an integral Ku70/80 heterodimer, each of the immobilized GST fusion proteins and FLAG-WRN was incubated with anSf9 lysate coinfected with two baculoviruses expressing Ku70 and Ku80. After extensive washes, the bound proteins were analyzed with SDS-PAGE and silver staining. The results of this experiment confirmed that the amino-terminal domain (amino acids 1–50) is sufficient for binding to the Ku70/80 heterodimer (Fig. 1 C, lane 3). Identical results were obtained when purified proteins were mixed in solution prior to pull down (not shown). To complement this analysis and identify the region of Ku80 necessary for the interaction with WRN, various deletion mutants of Ku80 were expressed in anin vitro reticulocyte lysate system in the presence of [35S]methionine (Fig.2 A, upper panel). The in vitro translated products were then incubated with either FLAG-tagged WRN (Fig. 2 A, lower panel) or a control FLAG-tagged hepatitis C virus polymerase (not shown) that were immobilized on FLAG beads. Bound proteins were resolved on a SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography (Fig. 2 B). This experiment revealed that deletion of the carboxyl-terminal region of Ku80, from amino acid 277 to 732, did not affect the binding to WRN (lanes 2–4); however, further deletion to amino acid 216 completely abolished the interaction (lane 1). Deletion of the amino terminus of Ku80, from amino acids 1 to 325, also abrogated the interaction with WRN (lane 5). The FLAG-tagged hepatitis C virus polymerase did not interact with any of the Ku80 mutants used in this assay (data not shown). Thus, these results indicate that the central region of Ku80, from amino acids 215 to 276, is important for mediating the interaction with WRN.Figure 2The region of Ku80 between amino acids 215 and 276 is necessary for the interaction with WRN.

A recent study also found that the amino-terminal domain of WRN, from amino acids 1 to 333, is sufficient for the degradation of DNA substrates with a 3′-overhang (13Huang S. Li B. Gray M. Oshima J. Mian I.S. Campisi J. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Because our results indicate that this region of WRN also binds to Ku80 (see Fig. 1), we were interested in testing whether WRNΔC388, a mutant form of WRN containing the first 388 amino acids and missing the helicase domain, is sufficient for Ku-dependent enhancement of DNA hydrolysis. FLAG epitope-tagged mutant WRN (WRNΔC388) was produced using a baculovirus expression system and then used in exonuclease assays with several DNA substrates in the presence or absence of Ku70, Ku80, or Ku70/80. WRNΔC388 weakly hydrolyzed the 3′-recessed strand of a partial DNA duplex and the 3′-ends of blunt end DNA (Fig. 3,A and B, lane 4). Importantly, in the presence of Ku70/80, the exonuclease activity of WRNΔC388 was strongly stimulated (lane 7). The dramatic increase in exonuclease activity depended on the presence of Ku70/80 because either Ku70 or Ku80 alone failed to stimulate WRNΔC388 (lanes 5 and 6). More significantly, in the presence of the Ku70/80 heterodimer, WRNΔC388 efficiently digested 3′-protruding ends and single strand DNA substrates (Fig. 3,C and D, lane 7). To confirm that the DNA degradation is catalyzed by WRN and not by a contaminating activity present in the Ku preparation, we performed the exonuclease assay in the presence of WRN82A, a point mutant of WRN lacking exonuclease activity (13Huang S. Li B. Gray M. Oshima J. Mian I.S. Campisi J. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.4, there was no detectable exonuclease activity in the presence of either WRN82A alone (lane 5), Ku70 (lane 2), Ku80 (lane 3), Ku70/80 (lane 4), or any combination of WRN82A, Ku70, and Ku80 (lanes 5–8), suggesting that the observed DNA degradation depends on the presence of a functional WRN exonuclease. In conclusion, Ku stimulates and alters the exonuclease activity of WRN lacking the helicase domain, suggesting that DNA unwinding is not required in this process. WRN contains amino acid regions possessing nucleic acid-dependent ATPase and helicase activities (7Yu C.E. Oshima J. Fu Y.H. Wijsman E. Hisama F. Alisch R. Matthews S. Nakura J. Miki T. Ouais S. Martin G. Mulligan J. Schellenberg G. Science. 1996; 272: 258-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1496) Google Scholar, 14Shen J.C. Gray M. Oshima J. Loeb L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2879-2885Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that the helicase activity of WRN is completely dependent on the hydrolysis of ATP, and ATP significantly stimulates the activity of the WRN exonuclease (29Kamath-Loeb A. Shen J.C. Loeb L. Fry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34145-34150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 30Gray M. Shen J.C. Kamath-Loeb A. Blank A. Sopher B. Martin G. Oshima J. Loeb L. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 100-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). To investigate further the mechanism of stimulation of the WRN exonuclease activity by Ku, we then asked whether ATP is required for this stimulatory process. As shown in Fig. 5, in the presence of Ku, the addition of ATP had no effect on the activity of either full-length WRN or WRNΔC388, indicating that Ku-mediated stimulation of WRN exonuclease activity does not require ATP hydrolysis. Ku has high specificity for DNA substrates, it binds tightly to the ends of double strand DNA, and has equal affinity for 5′-protruding, 3′-protruding, and blunt end DNA (18Mimori T. Hardin J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 375-379Google Scholar, 31Jin S. Weaver D.V. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6874-6885Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). On the other hand, WRN binds very weakly to double strand DNA (32Orren D.K. Brosh R.M. Nehlin J.O. Machwe A. Gray M.D. Bohr V.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3557-3566Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 33Shen J.-C. Loeb L.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3260-3268Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Therefore, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift analysis to determine whether Ku facilitates the recruitment of WRN to DNA through protein-protein interactions. Upon incubation of a 40/46-mer DNA duplex with purified Ku, we observed the formation of two distinct complexes (Fig. 6, lanes 4–6; complexes 1 and 2), most likely representing either one or two Ku70/80 heterodimers binding to one DNA molecule. In contrast, WRN failed to bind to DNA, as determined by the absence of any retarded complex on the gel (lanes 2 and 3). However, when both WRN and Ku were incubated with the DNA substrate, in addition to the complexes observed previously (complexes 1 and 2), a slower migrating band appeared in the gel (lanes 7–12; complex 3). This band, as well as the Ku·DNA complex 2, was supershifted by anti-Ku80 antibodies (lane 13). Moreover, the addition of WRN antibodies supershifted the putative WRN·Ku·DNA complex, whereas the Ku·DNA complexes were unaffected (lane 14). Antibodies against an unrelated protein (β-actin) had no effect on the relative mobility of any of the observed complexes (lane 15). Altogether, these results indicate that WNR can form a stable complex on DNA in the presence of Ku, further supporting the idea that Ku recruits WRN to DNA ends through specific protein-protein interaction. Previous studies demonstrated that WRN possesses an intrinsic 3′- to 5′-exonuclease activity that digests 3′-recessed DNA substrates (13Huang S. Li B. Gray M. Oshima J. Mian I.S. Campisi J. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar,15Shen J.C. Gray M. Oshima J. Kamath-Loeb A. Fry M. Loeb L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34139-34144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). More recently, our work has indicated that WRN interacts with Ku70/80 heterodimer, and Ku70/80 stimulates and alters the exonuclease activity of WRN, so that it can hydrolyze 3′-recessed, 5′-recessed, and blunt end DNA substrates efficiently (16Li B. Comai L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28349-28352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Because WRN does not bind to double strand DNA and has only a weak affinity for single strand DNA (32Orren D.K. Brosh R.M. Nehlin J.O. Machwe A. Gray M.D. Bohr V.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3557-3566Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), our finding raises the possibility that Ku may function as a bridging factor that brings WRN in close proximity to its DNA substrate. Ku-mediated recruitment of WRN may therefore represent a critical step in the targeting and subsequent activation of WRN exonuclease on specific DNA sites. In this study, to understand better the functional relationship between Ku and WRN, we have performed a detailed analysis of the interactions between these two factors. Our analysis shows that the interaction between WRN and Ku80 requires a stretch of 50 amino acids at the extreme amino terminus of WRN. These results are in apparent conflict with the data by Cooper et al. (34Cooper M.P. Machwe A., D.K., O. Brosh R.M. Ramsden D. Bohr V.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 907-912PubMed Google Scholar) showing that Ku interacts with the carboxyl-terminal region of WRN. Under our experimental conditions, we have never detected a direct interaction between the carboxyl-terminal domain of WRN and Ku. As we have suggested previously (16Li B. Comai L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28349-28352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), because the carboxyl terminus of WRN can dimerize with the full-length protein (34Cooper M.P. Machwe A., D.K., O. Brosh R.M. Ramsden D. Bohr V.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 907-912PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible that cellular WRN may have mediated the interaction observed in their affinity purification experiment. Our analysis of Ku80 mutants has also allowed the identification of a region between amino acids 215 and 276 as an important domain required for Ku80 binding to WRN. This region is distinct from the regions of Ku80 which have been found to be involved in interactions with Ku70 and a DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (35Wu X. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5186-5193Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 36Gell D. Jackson S.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3494-3502Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 37Singleton B.K. Torres-Arzayus M.I. Rottinghaus S.T. Taccioli G.E. Jeggo P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3267-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Because the region of WRN which binds to Ku80 is proximal to the WRN exonuclease domain, we reasoned that the amino-terminal region of WRN might be sufficient for Ku stimulation of the exonuclease activity. To address this point, we investigated the effect of Ku on the exonuclease activity of WRNΔC388, a form of WRN which is missing the helicase domain and the carboxyl-terminal region. Our results indicate that although WRNΔC388 poorly digests 3′-recessed ends and blunt end DNA duplexes, in the presence of Ku it efficiently digests 3′-recessed, 5′-recessed ends and blunt end DNA duplexes as well as single strand DNA. The observed activity is strictly dependent on the presence of a functional WRN because Ku70/80 does not stimulate WRN82A, a mutant protein lacking exonuclease activity. In addition, our results show that ATP is dispensable for this stimulatory process. Thus, Ku-stimulated WRN exonuclease activity is physically and functionally separable from the helicase domain and the carboxyl terminus of WRN and does not require ATP hydrolysis. To investigate how WRN can stably associate with its DNA substrate, we then performed gel shift assays. These experiments show that although WRN by itself has undetectable DNA binding affinity, in the presence of Ku it forms a strong complex with DNA. These results imply that protein interactions between WRN and Ku play a key role in the recruitment of WRN to DNA ends and suggest a potential function in the processing of DSBs. In eukaryotic cells, DSBs produced by external sources such as ionizing radiations or some chemical agents undermine the integrity of the genome, and if not repaired, they can lead to cell death (21Karran P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 27Critchlow S. Jackson S.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 394-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). In mammals, the Ku heterodimer, DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit, and the Ligase4·Xrcc4 complex are involved the repair of double strand DNA breaks by nonhomologous end joining (23Gottlieb T.M. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1993; 72: 131-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar, 24Hammarsten O. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Kulesza P. Wilson T.E. Mann M. Lieber M.R. Nature. 1997; 388: 492-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). In addition, because improper ligation can be potentially deleterious to the cell, several studies have suggested that nucleolytic activities are necessary in the repair process to trim the DNA before the ends are rejoined (40Karanjawala Z. Grawunder U. Hsieh C.L. Lieber M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1501-1504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 41Paull T.T. Gellert M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 969-979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). These nucleases must either recognize the broken DNA ends or be recruited to the site of DNA damage by specific protein-protein interactions. Mre11, a 3′- to 5′-exonuclease and endonuclease, has been implicated in one or more DNA repair pathways (21Karran P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 41Paull T.T. Gellert M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 969-979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Mre11, Rad50, and NBS1, an Xrs2p-like protein whose loss leads to Nijmegen breakage syndrome, bind cooperatively to DNA and form a distinct protein-DNA complex (42Paull T.T. Gellert M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1276-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). This complex displays several enzymatic activities, including partial unwinding of the DNA duplex and cleavage of the 3′-protruding end of double strand DNA. Recently, it has also been shown that Mre11 can facilitate the joining of mismatched ends, suggesting that Mre11 may direct DNA end joining at sites of microhomology (43Paull T.T. Gellert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6409-6414Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, whether Mre11 plays a role in nonhomologous end joining remains unclear. WRN does not bind directly to double strand DNA; however, it interacts with Ku and is recruited to DNA ends by specific protein-protein interactions. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that WRN, like Mre11, may participate in a specialized form of DNA repair which requires the proper processing of DNA ends before they are rejoined. Within the last few years it has become apparent that several distinct pathways of repairing DSBs operate in mammalian cells (21Karran P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 40Karanjawala Z. Grawunder U. Hsieh C.L. Lieber M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1501-1504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that some of these pathways, although sharing a subset of common components, may also utilize a number of unique and more specialized factors. WRN−/− fibroblasts are sensitive to 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide but are insensitive to other DNA-damaging agents such as ionizing radiation (44Fujiwara Y. Higashikawa T. Tatsumi M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1977; 92: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 45Stefanini M. Scappaticca S. Lagomarsini P. Borroni G. Berardesca E. Nuzzo F. Mutant Res. 1989; 219: 179-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), suggesting that if WRN is directly involved in the processing of damaged DNA, it may be required for the repair of a specific subset of DNA lesions. A later study on the ligation of linear plasmid DNA in lymphoblast cells from WS patients showed an increased rate of deletion at the ligation site but no reduction in end joining (46Runger T.M. Bauer C. Dekant B. Moller K. Sobotta P. Czerny C. Poot M. Martin G.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1994; 102: 45-48Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data may therefore indicate a subtle defect in the accuracy of the DSBs repair machinery. Further support for the idea that WRN and Ku may be part of a common pathway comes from studies of Ku80 mutant mice. WRN−/− fibroblasts and cells from Ku80 knockout mice display interesting similarities, such as a higher degree of chromosomal instability characterized by DNA breakage, translocation, and rearrangements (47Gebhart E. Bauer R. Raub U. Schinzel M. Ruprecht K.W. Jonas J.B. Human Genet. 1988; 80: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 48Vogel H. Lim D.S. Karsenty G. Finegold M. Hasty P. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Nature. 2000; 404: 510-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). In addition, Ku80 knockout mice show signs of premature aging, such as osteopenia, atrophic skin, and cancer (48Vogel H. Lim D.S. Karsenty G. Finegold M. Hasty P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10770-10775Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Thus, both Ku80 and WRN appear to influence the rate of senescence. Interestingly, WRN is localized in the nucleolus of human cells (50Marciniak R.A. Lombard D.B. Johnson F.B. Guarente L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6887-6892Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar,51Gray M.D. Wang L. Youssoufian H. Martin G.M. Oshima J. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that its function may be required for a specific nucleolar process. On the other hand, it is also possible that WRN is sequestered and kept inactive in the nucleolus, ready to be released when it is needed, as observed for some cell cycle regulatory factors (52Bachant J.B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 757-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Our goal is now to determine the specific process in which the WRN nucleolytic activity is required. The answer to this and other questions on the function of the WRN will provide important clues on the biological activities involved in the process of aging. We thank Dr. W. H. Reeves, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, for providing the Ku 80 cDNA clone. We are grateful to T. Bui for technical assistance and to the members of the Comai laboratory for helpful discussions and suggestions."

The initiation of differentiation of preadipocytic cell lines, such as 3T3-L1, into mature adipocytes is induced by continuous exposure to pharmacological doses of insulin or physiological doses of IGF-1.1 In addition, cAMP and glucocorticoids are generally considered necessary for the induction of differentiation. However, the mechanistic actions of insulin and other ligands on differentiation are not clearly defined (1Gregoire F.M. Smas C.M. Sul H.S. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 783-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1873) Google Scholar). The determination that the activation of the IGF-1 receptor is a potent inducer of the differentiation process implies that a tyrosine-kinase-mediated signaling pathway is involved in adipocyte differentiation. Furthermore, constitutive expression of Ras or Raf-1 (two components of receptor tyrosine kinase pathways) can induce preadipocyte differentiation in the absence of insulin or IGF-1 (2Benito M. Porras A. Nebreds A.R. Santos E. Science. 1991; 253: 565-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 3Porras A. Muszynski K. Rapp U.R. Santos E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12741-12748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, Raf-1 was able to induce only partial differentiation, indicating that Raf-independent pathways downstream of Ras may be involved in adipocyte differentiation. Moreover, the signals generated by Raf-1 did not activate MAPK or a 90-kDa S6 kinase, suggesting a functional dissociation between Raf-1 and MAPK/S6 kinase activation in Ras signaling pathways leading to 3T3-L1 differentiation (4Porras A. Santos E. Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. 1996; 20: S43-S51PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, it was demonstrated that MAPK activation is not required for, but rather antagonizes, the differentiation process (5Font de Mora J.A. Porras N. Ahn N. Santos E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6068-6075Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In sharp contrast, studies by Sale et al. (6Sale E.M. Atkinson P.G.P. Sale G.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 674-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) showed that MAPK is a key element in adipogenesis, with MAPK activation being required for signaling initiated by insulin and serum stimulation, for activation of DNA synthesis, and for the induction of differentiation in 3T3-L1 cells. MAPK is activated by phosphorylation at specific threonine and tyrosine residues on the MAPK molecule by the upstream kinase, MAPK kinase (MAPKK, or MEK (7Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar, 8Elion E.A. Science. 1998; 281: 1625-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 9Mansour S.J.

Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar)), and if this activation is sustained, MAPK translocates to the nucleus. However, if this activation is transient, MAPK is prevented from translocating (10Alessi D.R. Gomez N. Moorhead G. Lewis T. Keyse S.M. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 283-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). MAPK phosphorylation (activation) is a reversible process, in which protein phosphatases play a crucial role in controlling cellular activities. Because MEK is known to be transiently activated by phosphorylation, the regulation of prolonged or transient MAPK activation may be through phosphatases (10Alessi D.R. Gomez N. Moorhead G. Lewis T. Keyse S.M. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 283-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar,11Grammer T.C. Blenis J. Oncogene. 1997; 274: 1635-1645Crossref Scopus (177) Google Scholar). An emerging class of dual-specificity phosphatases that directly and specifically regulate MAPK family members has been characterized. Among them is the dual-specificity phosphatase PYST1 (also called MKP3 or rVH6) that is selective for inactivation of the extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) family MAPKs (ERK1 and ERK2) (12Groom L.A.

We have previously identified a novel transcriptional repressor (termed AEBP1) with carboxypeptidase (CP) activity (15Muise A.M. Ro H.-S. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) that regulates an adipocyte-specific gene (aP2); furthermore, we showed that its CP activity is vital for the transcriptional repression function (16He G.-P. Muise A.M. Wu-Li A. Ro H.-S. Nature. 1995; 378: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In this paper, we use coimmunoprecipitation experiments to demonstrate that AEBP1 complexes with ERK in vivo andin vitro. We also use ectopically expressed AEBP1, along with the MAPK-specific phosphatase PYST1/MKP3/rVH6, to demonstrate that AEBP1 attenuates MAPK inactivation, resulting in increased MAPK activity. Finally, we show evidence that the modulation of MAPK activation by AEBP1, which is independent of its transcriptional function, is a biologically relevant process in adipogenesis. This modulation of MAPK activation by the protective effect of AEBP1 illustrates a potential new mode of regulation in adipogenesis. The notion that a transcription factor can also function as a regulator of MAPK activation is unexpected and unprecedented. COS-7, 3T3-L1, and NIH-3T3 cells were cultured in 90-mm dishes and transfected at 80β confluence by the polybrene procedure as described previously (17He G.-P. Kim S.-W. Ro H.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14678-14684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Detailed descriptions of plasmid constructions and the generation of the overexpressing and the antisense cell lines are available from the authors on request. The HA-tagged expression plasmids pJ3H-AEBP1, pJ3H-AEBP1(−), pJ3H-AEBP1ΔDLD, pJ3H-AEBP1DLD, pJ3H-AEBP1ΔHic, and pJ3H-AEBP1ΔSty were derived from pJ3H (18Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Gene. 1995; 152: 187-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The retrovirus plasmids pAEBP1/Neo, pAEBP1ΔHic/Neo, pAEBP1ΔSty/Neo, and the antisense plasmid pAS/Neo were derived from pWZLNeo (19Freytag S.O. Paielli D.L. Gilbert J.D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1654-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The retrovirus plasmids pAEBP1DLD/Puro and pAEBP1DLD(−)/Puro were derived from pBabe-puro (20Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2306) Google Scholar). Cell extracts were prepared in cold radioimmune precipitation buffer containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg aprotinin/ml, 10 μg leupeptin/ml, 5 mm EDTA, and 5 mm EGTA. Cell extracts were incubated with protein A-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h, after which the beads were discarded and the supernatants were incubated with specific antibodies (2 μg/ml anti-HA, anti-ERK1, anti-MEK1, or anti-IGFR, or 2.5 μg/ml of either affinity-purified anti-AEBP1 antibodies or IgG from preimmune serum) for 1 h and then overnight with protein A-agarose. Samples were collected and washed four times with radioimmune precipitation buffer. The precipitated samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech's ECL blotting system with specific antibodies (200 ng/ml). For the immunocomplex kinase assay, MAPK was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with specific antibodies overnight. The pelleted agarose beads were washed three times with radioimmune precipitation buffer and equilibrated three times in kinase buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol), then 15 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and specific substrate (AEBP1 or the myelin basic protein (MBP)) were added and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by adding SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Samples were resolved by either 8.5β (AEBP1), or 15β (MBP) SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Bands were detected and quantitated by the Molecular Imager system (Bio-Rad Laboratories). For the in vivoassay, COS-7 cells transfected with plasmids expressing AEBP1, PYST1, and HA-ERK1 were starved for 2 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 0.1β calf serum, then stimulated for 15 min with 10 nm of EGF (Sigma). Cell lysates in cold radioimmune precipitation buffer were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody (2 μg/ml) for 1 h and incubated with protein A-agarose for 30 min. The assay for MAPK activity was performed with MBP as above. Alternatively, phosphorylated ERK was detected by immunoblotting with Phospho-p44/42 MAPK monoclonal antibody (New England BioLabs). For thein vitro assay, recombinant phospho-ERK2 protein (2.5 ng, New England BioLabs) was incubated with 100 ng of recombinant AEBP1 (or its mutant derivatives) protein for 1 h on ice. The mixture was treated with the recombinant MAPK phosphatase rVH6 (13Mourey R.J. Quinn C.V. Campbell J.S. Wenderoth M.P. Hauschka S.D. Krebs E.G. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3795-3802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) for 30 min at 30 °C. The treated kinases were analyzed by immunoblotting with Phospho-p44/42 MAPK monoclonal and p44/42 MAPK antibodies, respectively. Transfection of NIH-3T3 cells was performed with 5 μg of paP2(3AE-1/-120)CAT and 10 μg of the fusion HA-AEBP1 (or its mutant derivatives) expression plasmid pJ3H-AEBP1 (or the control plasmid pJ3H-AEBP1(−)) along with 1 μg of pHermes-lacZ, a plasmid that expresses the lacZ gene under the control of the CMV promoter. β-Galactosidase activity was assayed 48 h after transfection to normalize transfection efficiency, and CAT activity was assayed as described previously (16He G.-P. Muise A.M. Wu-Li A. Ro H.-S. Nature. 1995; 378: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Stable cell lines were maintained in DMEM containing 10β calf serum and 200 ng of G418/ml (Life Technologies, Inc.). At confluence, cells were treated with DMEM containing 10β cosmic calf serum (HyClone Laboratories), 0.5 μm dexamethasone, 5 μg insulin/ml, 0.5 mm1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine for 2 days then maintained in DMEM containing 10β cosmic calf serum and 5 μg insulin/ml for 6 days. Cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed by incubating in 4β paraformaldehyde for 10 min, and stained with a saturated oil Red O in 60β triethyl phosphate solution (BDH). AEBP1, besides being a novel carboxypeptidase with transcriptional repression function, has a serine, threonine, proline (STP)-rich region with a few possible MAPK proline-directed phosphorylation sites in the C terminus. Indeed, the recombinant AEBP1 protein can be phosphorylated by immunoprecipitated MAPK, and the phosphorylation site(s) may be located at the C terminus, because no phosphorylation was detected with a truncated mutant form of AEBP1 (AEBP1ΔSty (16He G.-P. Muise A.M. Wu-Li A. Ro H.-S. Nature. 1995; 378: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar)), which lacks the C-terminal domain (data not shown). However, it is possible that conformational changes caused by the truncation in this mutant may mask potential phosphorylation sites in other regions of AEBP1. Nevertheless, these results have suggested that one kinase responsible for AEBP1 phosphorylation is MAPK. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot experiments with antibodies toward AEBP1 and phosphorylated tyrosine have indicated that AEBP1 was not phosphorylated by a tyrosine kinase. Interestingly, two phosphoproteins with the approximate molecular weights of the MAPKs ERK1 and ERK2 were detected when AEBP1 immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (data not shown). These observations prompted us to examine the possibility that MAPK can be coprecipitated with AEBP1. To verify this intriguing possibility, we utilized cell extracts from different stages of adipocyte differentiation for coimmunoprecipitation, because AEBP1 expression is abolished in adipocytes (16He G.-P. Muise A.M. Wu-Li A. Ro H.-S. Nature. 1995; 378: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 A(top) shows the immunoprecipitation analysis of AEBP1 abundance during 7 days after exposure to differentiation conditions. Expression of AEBP1 was decreased on day 1 and persisted until 4 days after exposure to differentiation medium, then decreased on day 5 and was subsequently abolished at the terminal stage of adipocyte differentiation on days 6 and 7. Because AEBP1 is undetectable on days 6 and 7, we would not expect to observe any coprecipitation of MAPK on these days, and MAPK was not detected in the AEBP1 immunoprecipitates from days 6 and 7 (Fig. 1 A, middle). Immunoblotting of the cell lysates showed no significant change in the content of MAPK during adipocyte differentiation (Fig. 1 A,bottom). To further assess the interaction between AEBP1 and MAPK we carried out reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with either anti-AEBP1 or anti-ERK1 antibodies, and then the post-precipitated cell extracts were further immunoprecipitated with the opposite antibodies. The precipitated samples were then analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-AEBP1 and anti-ERK1 antibodies, respectively. Fig. 1 B shows that the amount of AEBP1 that remains unbound (top, lane 2) is approximately similar to the amount of AEBP1 associated with ERKs (top, lane 1). Conversely, the amount of MAPK that remains unbound (bottom, lane 4) is approximately similar to the amount of MAPK associated with AEBP1 (bottom, lane 3). These results indicate that about 50β of AEBP1 and MAPK molecules interact with each other in mammalian cells. In light of the above studies, it would be interesting to determine whether AEBP1 interacts with the phosphorylated, dephosphorylated, or both forms of MAPK to determine whether the AEBP1-MAPK interaction was further involved in regulation of MAPK. To determine the phosphorylation state of the MAPK molecules that complex with AEBP1, we used cell extracts from quiescent and from serum-stimulated 3T3-L1 cells. Activation (phosphorylation) of MAPK, which can be detected by the slower migration of the phosphorylated form in SDS-polyacrylamide gels, was induced by serum stimulation (Fig. 1 C,top). AEBP1 was then isolated from cell extracts by immunoprecipitation with anti-AEBP1 antibody and MAPK was detected by immunoblot analysis. Fig. 1 C (bottom) shows that ERKs are detected in the AEBP1 immunoprecipitates prepared from both quiescent (lane 3) and the serum-stimulated cells (lane 4). Thus, AEBP1 associates with both forms of MAPK. To further confirm that AEBP1 and MAPK interact in vivo, extracts from cells transfected with an expression plasmid (pJ3H-AEBP1) encoding an HA-tagged version of AEBP1 (HA-AEBP1) were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antisera, and the immunoprecipitates were probed with anti-ERK1 antisera. Fig.2 A (bottom) shows that ERK1 was detected in the HA immunoprecipitates from cells transfected with pJ3H-AEBP1 (lane 1) but not from cells transfected with the control plasmid (lane 4). Reciprocal immunoprecipitation with anti-ERK1 antisera and immunoblotting with anti-HA antisera (top) demonstrated that HA-AEBP1 is detected from pJ3H-AEBP1-transfected cells (lane 2) but not from cells transfected with the control plasmid (lane 5). Similar coimmunoprecipitation experiments with an upstream component of the MAPK signaling module showed that AEBP1 does not interact with MEK1 (data not shown). However, we cannot rule out the possibility that AEBP1 interacts with other upstream components of the MAPK pathway. To locate a domain(s) of AEBP1 responsible for MAPK interaction, we generated constructs encoding mutant derivatives of the HA-tagged AEBP1 protein (Fig. 2 B); these constructs were then transfected individually and analyzed for the ability of the encoded AEBP1 polypeptides to interact with MAPK by coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Fig. 2 C (bottom) shows that ERK1 was coprecipitated from cells transfected with the wild-type (lane 1) and most mutant derivatives (lanes 3–5) but not from cells transfected with either the mutant derivative pJ3H-AEBP1ΔDLD (lane 2), which expresses an HA-tagged AEBP1 that lacks the N-terminal 233 amino acids (Fig. 2 B) or the empty vector pJ3H (lane 6). Interaction with MAPK was abolished neither by deletion in the carboxypeptidase domain (pJ3H-AEBP1ΔHic, lane 4) nor by truncation at the C terminus (pJ3H-AEBP1ΔSty, lane 5). Significantly, ERK1 was coprecipitated from cells transfected with the mutant derivative pJ3H-AEBP1DLD (lane 3), which expresses only the N-terminal 204 amino acids (residues 32–235) of AEBP1 (Fig. 2 B). Therefore, these results indicate that the domain of AEBP1 responsible for MAPK interaction is located at the N terminus, which contains sequences that were previously termed discoidin-like domain (DLD (16He G.-P. Muise A.M. Wu-Li A. Ro H.-S. Nature. 1995; 378: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar)), and suggest that phosphorylation is not required for AEBP1 to interact with MAPK. We developed an in vitro coimmunoprecipitation system for assessing the interaction to determine whether AEBP1 interacts with MAPK directly or via intermediates. The wild-type and mutant derivatives of the His-tagged recombinant AEBP1 proteins (16He G.-P. Muise A.M. Wu-Li A. Ro H.-S. Nature. 1995; 378: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) were mixed individually with the recombinant ERK2 protein, then the mixture was immunoprecipitated with anti-ERK or anti-AEBP1 antisera. The precipitates were then analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-AEBP1 or anti-ERK antisera. As shown in Fig. 2 D, the wild-type (lane 3) and all the mutant derivatives of His-AEBP1 (lanes 5–7), except the mutant ΔDLD with amino-terminal deletion (lane 4), were detected in the immunoblot. Specifically, a mutant derivative, which consists of only the N-terminal 204 amino acids (DLD), was able to coprecipitate with the recombinant ERK2 protein (lane 5). The apparent inability of the N-terminal deletion mutant to interact with MAPK is due neither to its inability to be recognized by the anti-AEBP1 antisera nor to its prevention of immunoprecipitation by anti-ERK antisera (data not shown). Taken together these results suggest that MAPK directly interacts with AEBP1 at the N terminus. Examination of the sequences in the N-terminal domain of AEBP1 did not reveal any MAPK docking sites described previously (21Jacobs D. Glossip D. Xing H. Muslin A.J. Kornfeld K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 22Yang S.-H. Yates P.R. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 710-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 23Yang S.-H. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Sharrocks A.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1740-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). However, a putative MAPK-docking site, which is characterized by a cluster of positively charged amino acids (24Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar), is present in the N-terminal domain of AEBP1. Because AEBP1 associates specifically with MAPK, AEBP1 may participate in the MAPK signaling pathway by modulating MAPK activation. We asked whether MAPK activity could be modulated by altering the abundance of AEBP1 in 3T3-L1 cells. The pooled stable 3T3-L1 cell lines were generated with a retrovirus directing expression of either wild-type (AEBP1/Neo-P) or the mutant derivatives (AEBP1ΔHic/Neo-P and AEBP1ΔSty/Neo-P) of AEBP1. Fig. 3 A (second row) shows the amount of phosphorylated ERK in the stable cells. The AEBP1/Neo-P cells contained the highest level among the stable cell lines, whereas the AEBP1ΔSty/Neo-P cells contained the lowest, similar to the level in the control cell line (Neo-P) generated by the empty retroviral vector. Significantly, the amount of phosphorylated ERK in the AEBP1ΔHic/Neo-P cells was much higher than the level in the control cells, but lower than the level in the AEBP1/Neo-P cells. These results indicate that overexpression of AEBP1 increases MAPK activity and that the ability to interact with MAPK by the mutant derivative AEBP1ΔSty is not sufficient for the modulation of MAPK activation. To rule out the possibility that AEBP1 overexpression could be eliciting expression of a growth factor that is activating the MAPK pathway, the activity of MEK1 was determined, and we found no difference in the activity among these cell lines (data not shown). Furthermore, in vitro kinase assay showed that phosphorylation of the recombinant ERK2 protein by immunoprecipitated MEK1 was not stimulated by addition of recombinant AEBP1 protein (data not shown). These results suggest that the modulation of MAPK activation by AEBP1 overexpression may not be mediated by stimulation of MEK1 activity. The above results suggest that AEBP1 can modulate MAPK activation. However, because the conclusions are based on results obtained with AEBP1-overexpressing cell lines, it cannot be concluded whether AEBP1 operates similarly at physiological concentrations. It would thus be important to examine whether suppression of endogenous AEBP1 by antisense RNA expression can lead to decreased MAPK activity. Cells were transfected with an expression vector (pAS/Neo) that constitutively expresses an antisense RNA corresponding to the 5′ 700-bp region of the AEBP1 transcript. We established two stable cell lines (AS/Neo-7 and -11), which showed decreased levels of AEBP1 in comparison to the level in the control cell line (Neo-12) established with the empty vector. Of the two clones, AS/Neo-11 exhibited a lower level of AEBP1 expression (Fig. 3 B, top row). As predicted, AS/Neo-11 exhibited lowest MAPK activity (24β of the control level) (Fig. 3 B, second row), but MEK activity (detected by phospho-MEK1 antibody) was similar among these cell lines (Fig. 3 B, fourth row). These results suggest that AEBP1 specifically modulates MAPK activation, and the modulation may be physiologically relevant. A possible mechanism of MAPK modulation by AEBP1 is through protection of MAPK from its phosphatase. Because AEBP1 was observed at similar levels in the nuclear and post-nuclear soluble fractions (25Park J.-G. Muise A.M. He G.-P. Kim S.-W. Ro H.-S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4004-4012Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we predict that AEBP1 may protect MAPK from the cytosolic MAPK-specific phosphatase PYST1/MKP3/rVH6. To test this hypothesis we used ectopically expressed AEBP1, along with ERK1 and PYST1, to demonstrate that AEBP1 attenuates ERK1 inactivation. To establish a system that allows assessment of MAPK regulation by AEBP1, we expressed PYST1 and measured mitogen-stimulated ERK1 activity in transfected COS-7 cells. Fig.4 A (top) shows that PYST1 expressed in COS-7 cells blocked heterologously expressed ERK1 (pECE/HA-ERK1) activation following stimulation with epidermal growth factor (EGF), and this inhibition increased when cells were transfected with increasing amounts of PYST1 plasmid (pSG5/PYST1-Myc (12Groom L.A. Sneddon A.A. Alessi D.R. Dowd S. Keyse S.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3621-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar)). Next, we tested whether expressing AEBP1 restored the EGF-stimulated ERK1 activation under conditions where the PYST1-mediated inhibition would be maximal. Fig. 4 B (top) shows that EGF-stimulated ERK1 activation was recovered in a dose-dependent manner when COS-7 cells were transfected with the plasmid expressing AEBP1 (lanes 4–6) but not with the control plasmid (lanes 1–3). The PYST1 inhibition is unlikely mediated by AEBP1 binding to the phosphatase, because coimmunoprecipitation experiments did not reveal such interaction (data not shown). To rule out the possibility that the transcriptional repression activity of AEBP1 is involved in the modulation of MAPK activation, we repeated the protection experiments with mutant derivatives of AEBP1 defective in transcriptional repression activity but still able to interact with MAPK. We predicted that the mutants ΔHic and ΔSty are defective in transcriptional function, because ΔSty lacks the C-terminal DNA-binding domain whereas ΔHic lacks the CP activity that is required for transcriptional function (16He G.-P. Muise A.M. Wu-Li A. Ro H.-S. Nature. 1995; 378: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Indeed, both mutants were defective in transcriptional repression activity (Fig. 4 C). Importantly, the EGF-stimulated ERK1 activation (detected by phospho-ERK1 antibody), under conditions where inhibition by PYST1 is maximal, was recovered in a dose-dependent manner when COS-7 cells were transfected with the plasmid expressing the mutant derivative ΔHic (Fig. 4 D, top,lanes 4–6). These results are in agreement with the MAPK modulation activity retained by the mutant derivative ΔHic (Fig.3 A). In agreement with the results in Fig. 3 A, the protection by ΔHic was not as strong as that conferred by wild-type AEBP1 (Fig. 4 D, top, lanes 7–9), perhaps due to the large deletion in the ΔHic protein (Fig. 2 B). We did not observe any protection effect with the ΔSty mutant (Fig. 4 D, top, lanes 1–3), which suggests that the protection domain is located at the C terminus that is missing in the ΔSty protein (Fig. 2 B). These results are consistent with the data showing lack of MAPK modulation activity in cells overexpressing the ΔSty mutant (Fig.3 A). The EGF-stimulated MEK1 activation (detected by Phospho-MEK1/2 antibody) was not affected in any of the transfected cells (Fig. 4 D, second row). Also, the decreased protection activity of ΔHic and ΔSty are not due to defects in their expression, because the expression level of each mutant was similar to the wild-type level (Fig. 4 D,third row). These results indicate that AEBP1 can protect MAPK from a MAPK-specific phosphatase and suggest that the protection is most likely mediated by protective interaction not by transcriptional function. To further substantiate the conclusion that AEBP1 modulates MAPK activation by a protective interaction, we utilized another mutant derivative (DLD) that consists of only the interaction domain (Fig. 2) as a dominant-negative mutant. We would predict that this mutant competes away MAPK from the wild-type and attenuates the protective activity exhibited by the wild-type in a dominant-negative fashion. Indeed, DLD expressed in COS-7 cells attenuated the protective activity of AEBP1 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4 E,top). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that AEBP1 modulates MAPK activation through protective interaction. To test whether AEBP1 alone is sufficient for blocking dephosphorylation of activated MAPK by a MAPK phosphatase, an in vitro phosphatase assay was designed. Recombinant phospho-ERK2 protein was treated with the recombinant rVH6, a MAPK phosphatase,"

Since a rate-limiting step in the catalytic cycle of the enzyme is the reduction of the ferrous oxygenated heme protein, subsequent reaction intermediates do not normally accumulate. Using 60Co γ-irradiation, the primary reduced oxy-P450 species at 77 K has been identified as a superoxo- or hydroperoxo-Fe3+-heme complex (Davydov, R., Macdonald, I. D. G., Makris, T. M., Sligar, S. G., and Hoffman, B. M. (1999)J. Am. Chem. Soc. 121, 10654–10655). The electronic absorption spectroscopy is an essential tool to characterize cytochrome P450 intermediates and complements paramagnetic methods, which are blind to important diamagnetic or antiferromagnetically coupled states. We report a method of trapping unstable states of redox enzymes using phosphorus-32 as an internal source of electrons. We determine the UV-visible optical spectra of the reduced oxygenated state of CYP101 and show that the primary intermediate, a hydroperoxo-P450, is stable below 180 K and converts smoothly to the product complex at ∼195 K. In the course of the thermal annealing, no spectral changes indicating the presence of oxoferryl species (the so-called compound I type spectrum) was observed.

In the course of the thermal annealing, no spectral changes indicating the presence of oxoferryl species (the so-called compound I type spectrum) was observed. Detailed information about the intermediates in complex chemical and biochemical reactions is of vital importance in mechanistic studies. Typical relaxation methods can often monitor the progress of only one kinetically limiting step of the reaction if there is a dominance of a slow step in the catalytic cycle. It is much more difficult, however, to obtain information about the subsequent (fast) stages of the reaction and the properties of corresponding intermediate species, since they are not accumulated at ambient conditions in the course of the reaction, and their concentrations are nominally very small. Ideally, one would like to stop the reaction at each step to follow the reaction progress and collect information about each intermediate compound involved in the reaction path. Given a suitable set of activation barriers and enthalpies, cryogenic trapping of unstable intermediates allows such dissection of the reaction cycle, provided a method of preparation of initial nonequilibrium reactive complexes is available. The field of matrix isolation chemistry is based on this approach, where the active complexes are trapped in host matrix, usually solid inert gases at cryogenic temperatures (1Turner J.J. Pimentel G.C. Science. 1963; 140: 974-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Such methods help to create and study unstable reaction states that rapidly decompose at ambient conditions (2Khriachtchev L. Pettersson M. Runeberg N. Lundell J. Rasanen M. Nature. 2000; 406: 874-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Recently, the same approach was developed in field of structural and mechanistic enzymology of the redox active enzyme cytochrome P450 (3Davydov R. Macdonald I.D.G. Makris T.M. Sligar S.G.

The cytochromes P450 are heme-containing metalloproteins involved in numerous biochemical reactions including xenobiotic metabolism and steroid biosynthesis (7Ortiz de Montellano, P. R. (ed) (1995) Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry, 2nd Ed., Plenum Press, New YorkGoogle Scholar). The reaction cycle of these enzymes involves two one-electron reductions, interspersed by the binding of dioxygen. Cleavage of a putative peroxo or reduced oxydioxygen bond is thought to lead to the generation of a high valent “ferryl” intermediate analogous to the compound I state of the peroxidases. The proposed sequential steps of the P450 reaction cycle are depicted in Scheme I,Fe3+(P)+e−→Fe2+(P)Fe2+(P)+O2→Fe3+(P)−O2−Fe3+(P)−O2−+e−→Fe3+(P)−O22−Fe3+(P)−O22−+H+→Fe3+(P)−(OOH)−Fe3+(P)−(OOH)−+H+→Fe4+(P+*)=O+H2OSCHEMEIwhere (P) represents the porphyrin macrocycle, and (P+*) represents the porphyrin π-cation radical. The sequential one-electron reductions of the heme iron at the active site are provided by a protein redox partner. Alternatively, the same one-electron reduction can be reached by reaction with solvated electrons generated by pulsed radiolysis of water (8Kobayashi K. Amano M. Kanbara Y. Hayashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5445-5447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When radiolytic reduction is performed at low temperature (at 77 K), the system is effectively immobilized, and the reactive complexes can be accumulated and studied (3Davydov R. Macdonald I.D.G.

Soc. 1994; 1994: 11120-11128Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar), the cryogenic radiolytic reduction remains technically demanding. The high doses (2–6 megarads) that are necessary to obtain sufficient yield of reducing equivalents in frozen solution are usually introduced with powerful 60Co γ-sources or with synchrotron radiation. These radiation sources are not commonly available to biochemical laboratories. Radiolysis at low temperatures (77 K or even 4 K) creates more problems, particularly due to the difficulties in monitoring the progress of the cryoradiolytic reduction in the course of irradiation using these types of sources. In this paper, we describe how another source of ionizing radiation, phosphorus-32, can be a convenient means for generating unstable active compounds through one-electron radiolytic reduction of the reagents trapped in aqueous/organic glass at 77 K. We show that using commercially available 32P-enriched phosphate it is possible to generate sufficient concentrations of intermediates (radicals or active complexes) of different biological molecules in frozen aqueous/glycerol solutions at 77 K. Although quite unstable at ambient temperatures, many such reaction intermediates are effectively stabilized below the glass transition temperature of solvent and can be accumulated and stored for months (6Davydov R.

Using the technique of in situ radiolytic reduction at cryogenic temperature, we present the first determination of the optical spectra of a two electron reduced dioxygen intermediate, the iron-hydroperoxo state, in cytochrome P450cam (CYP101). 32P-enriched aqueous solution of orthophosphoric acid (activity 50 mCi/ml) was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Activity was measured by the manufacturer and tested using the Fricke dosimeter method (25Schuler R.H. Allen A.O. J. Chem. Phys. 1956; 24: 56-59Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Cytochrome P450 CYP101 fromPseudomonas putida was expressed and purified as described (26Unger B.P. Gunsalus I.C. Sligar S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1158-1163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and stored in concentrated frozen aqueous solutions at 200 K in the presence of camphor in the ferric form. All other chemicals were of spectrophotometric grade and used without additional purification. Sodium dithionite (Na2S2O4) from Sigma was stored and used in an anaerobic chamber. Cytochrome P450 CYP101 was reduced by adding several small crystals of dithionite in an anaerobic chamber to a concentrated solution of ferric protein. The products of reaction and the remaining dithionite were removed by passing the solution through a small G-25 column using deoxygenated 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm camphor. Solutions of reduced cytochrome P450 were then concentrated using microcentricons inside the anaerobic chamber and used within 1 h after preparation. Samples for incubation with radioactive phosphate were prepared on ice to minimize autoxidation. To prepare the sample, 0.75 ml of the glycerol/phosphate buffer solvent (final camphor concentration 1 mm) was mixed with 0.25 ml of 32P-enriched orthophosphoric acid, and 60 μl of catalase solution (∼1200 units final activity) was added to consume hydrogen peroxide produced due to water radiolysis in radioactive solution occurring during transportation and storage (concentration estimated to be about 1 mm based on radiolytic yield (27Spinks J.W.T. Woods R.J. An Introduction to Radiation Chemistry. Wiley and Sons, New York1990Google Scholar)). After incubation of the sample solution for 45 min to eliminate all H2O2, the anaerobic solution of reduced ferrous cytochrome P450 CYP101 (120 μl) was added and stirred for 90 s to ensure the homogeneous mixing with the viscous glycerol solution at 4 °C. The final concentration of the enzyme was ∼30 μm, and it was completely oxygenated in aerobic glycerol/ buffer solvent. The sample was transferred into a Dewar and cooled to 200 K within 3–4 min to form a clear transparent glass and then to 77 K within 25–30 min. Several spectra in the range 300–900 nm were taken during cooling to control the state of the sample and the absence of significant autoxidation. All samples were kept fully immersed in liquid nitrogen at 77 K when not in use. Cobalt-60 irradiation was used in control experiments. Samples for γ-irradiation were prepared similarly with the exception of addition of 32P-enriched phosphate. Oxygenation of the reduced ferrous cytochrome P450 CYP101 was accomplished either by simple mixing of the concentrated deoxygenated solution of the enzyme with aerobic aqueous/glycerol buffer or by bubbling the oxygen gas through the deoxygenated solution of the enzyme prepared in the final glycerol/water mixture at the anaerobic chamber. Both methods gave identical results. The final fraction of autoxidized P450 CYP101 was estimated as less than 5% from absorbance value at 646 nm. The samples were kept in liquid nitrogen and irradiated in a silvered Dewar flask containing liquid nitrogen. A typical γ-irradiation using 60Co was for 4 h (at the measured on site dose rate of 21 kilorads/min for a total dose of ∼5 megarads), and the irradiation Dewar flask was refilled after 2 h to maintain the samples at 77 K. The similar samples with ferric cytochrome P450, carbon monoxide complex of ferrous cytochrome P450, horseradish peroxidase, and riboflavin were also prepared and irradiated in identical conditions to check the radiolytic reduction yield and compare our results with earlier data (16Gasyna Z. FEBS Lett. 1979; 106: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 17Gasyna Z. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 577: 207-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 20Magonov S.N. Davydov R.M.

Optical spectra at low temperatures were obtained using a Cary 3 UV-visible spectrophotometer (Varian Instruments) and a homemade cryostat with liquid nitrogen used as a cooling agent. The samples were mixed directly in the disposable methacrylate cells (UV-enhanced semimicro cells from Fisher, total sample volume ∼1 ml, 4.3-mm path length, 15–30 μm final concentration of the protein) and mounted on the holder of the cryostat. To obtain the good optically transparent frozen solutions without significant turbidity, the 1:1 and 3:1 (v/v) glycerol/ buffer solutions were cooled without direct contact with liquid nitrogen to prevent cracking (glycerol and ethylene glycol do not change the catalytic mechanism of CYP 101, although the turnover rate is slowed (28Di Primo C. Sligar S.G. Hui Bon Hoa G. Douzou P. FEBS Lett. 1992; 312: 252-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar)). As was noted previously (29Shibata Y. Kurita A. Kushida T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1789-1801Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), the 3:1 glycerol/water mixture is stable at all studied temperatures, while 1:1 mixtures undergo phase separation and water crystallization when incubated for some time at 190–230 K, making further optical measurements in the visible region impossible. Below 190 K, both solvents could be used for optical spectroscopy at UV-visible range for prolonged measurements. The temperature was controlled by a calibrated thermocouple fixed in a thermal contact with a brass sample holder close to the light beam position. All spectra were measured in a single beam mode in the 300–900-nm range with 2.0-nm resolution; data points were taken every 1 nm with a scan speed of 60–100 nm/min. Background subtraction, differentiation, singular value decomposition analysis, and all other calculations were accomplished using MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA). In a typical annealing experiment, the sample was warmed stepwise, 4–8 K at a time, and then several spectra were taken while keeping the sample at the temperature of annealing or 3–5 K below to check the thermal equilibration and reproducibility of the measurements. It was observed that all changes in the spectra of (nonequilibrium) cryoreduced species were irreversible and that partially annealed samples could be cooled again to 77 K and were stable at this temperature for many weeks. Thus, it was possible to work with one sample for several days and to accumulate the products of cryoradiolysis, keeping the sample immersed in liquid nitrogen. The protein integrity after irradiation was tested by UV-visible spectroscopy at the end of the experiment at room temperature. We always obtained a pure CO-bound P450 spectrum with no sign of an inactive form of the protein, P420, being produced. The carbonmonoxy-bound ferrous cytochrome P450 was formed, because the large amount of reducing species and CO formed during radiolysis of aqueous/organic solvent can react with the enzyme when the sample is thawed, as has been observed in previous radiolytic studies (13Davydov R.M.

With an increase of the absorbed dose, we observed the appearance and increase of a strong and very broad absorption band with a maximum at about 560 nm, a clear indication of the accumulation of the trapped electrons in the frozen at 77 K aqueous/alcohol solvent (27Spinks J.W.T. Woods R.J. An Introduction to Radiation Chemistry. Wiley and Sons, New York1990Google Scholar,30Kolodziejski M. Abramczyk H. J. Mol. Struct. 1997; 436–437: 543-553Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The initial rate of absorption increase at maximum was ∼0.07/h with 10 mCi/ml 32P used. This rate is in good agreement with an estimated radiolytic yield of solvated electrons at a given dose rate (27Spinks J.W.T. Woods R.J. An Introduction to Radiation Chemistry. Wiley and Sons, New York1990Google Scholar) and typical values of molar absorption of electron solvated in water (17 mm−1cm−1 at 715 nm) and alcohols (13 mm−1 cm−1at 520 nm) (see Ref. 27Spinks J.W.T. Woods R.J. An Introduction to Radiation Chemistry. Wiley and Sons, New York1990Google Scholar and references therein). This absorption could be completely eliminated by the illumination of the sample with a regulated Oriel tungsten-halogen lamp with a typical illumination time of 12 min. The cut-off filter (λ > 450 nm) was used to prevent possible degradation of photosensitive intermediates. The sample was fully immersed in liquid nitrogen during illumination to prevent heating. In the separate experiment, it was shown that even with the filter with cut-off λ >600 nm it was possible to eliminate almost all absorption originating from the solvated (trapped) electrons, although in this case it took longer than 2 h. The possibility of photobleaching this broad background absorption band at the visible region using the light of different spectral composition also confirms its origin as a result of trapped electron accumulation (15Magonov S.N.

These electrons are photolyzed by the visible light and disappear through recombination via numerous chemical reactions with other products of radiolysis as well as with the original components of the solution. Radioactive 32P-enriched phosphate is very well suited for use as an internal radiation source in aqueous and organic solutions. Phosphate, as well as sulfate, the product of β-decay of phosphate, are natural components of many buffer systems and do not interfere with most of reactions. The commercially available orthophosphoric acid (as an aqueous or dilute HCl solutions) with32P activity up to 50 mCi/ml makes it possible to reach radiation doses of 30 megarads or more. Accumulation of side radiolysis products, however, usually limits the radiolytic dose to about 5 megarads (24Fessenden R.W. Schuler R.H. Burton M. Magee J.L. Advances in Radiation Chemistry. Wiley and Sons, 1970: 1-176Google Scholar). Since the half-life of 32P is 14.31 days, 2–3 megarads can be generated in a 2-week incubation. This makes easy the monitoring of the progress of radiolytic reduction and accumulation of the primary reaction intermediates, using spectroscopic or other noninvasive methods. A decided advantage of the low temperature, radiolytic trapping of reactive enzyme states is the ability to follow the reaction coordinate of the system by selectively annealing the sample at higher temperatures. To measure the dose rate generated by 32P-enriched phosphate, we used the reaction of aerobic radiolytic oxidation of ferrous sulfate in aqueous sulfuric acid known as the Fricke dosimeter (27Spinks J.W.T. Woods R.J. An Introduction to Radiation Chemistry. Wiley and Sons, New York1990Google Scholar). The time course of Fe2+ oxidation is monitored by absorption growth at 304 nm (Fig. 1) (25Schuler R.H. Allen A.O. J. Chem. Phys. 1956; 24: 56-59Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The agreement between the theoretical curve calculated using the mean energy of electrons generated in β decay of 32P (0.7 MeV) and reported activity of the commercial sample and the experimentally measured dose rate is excellent. These results show that32P can indeed be used as an easy and readily available source of ionizing radiation, successfully replacing 60Co γ-sources for the radiochemical generation of biological samplesin situ.

Here we compare the products of γ-irradiation at 77 K and of cryoradiolysis using 32P as an internal source and show that both methods give identical results, with each having its own technical advantages. The radiolytic reduction of cytochrome P450 CYP101 was followed at low temperatures (77 K) in glycerol/water (1:1 or 3:1 (v/v), molar fraction of glycerol x m = 0.2 or 0.43, respectively) frozen solutions containing 32P-enriched phosphate containing an activity of 10 mCi/ml, which corresponds to a total dose of ∼7 megarads, or 3.5 megarads during the first half-life of32P. Fig. 2 A shows the spectra of the oxy form of cytochrome P450 CYP101 immediately after preparation of a sample containing 32P (10 mCi/ml) at 77 K and after incubation at low temperature for different periods of time. The absorbance at 417 nm (maximum of the oxy-P450 spectrum at low temperatures) decreases, and the new peak at ∼440 nm appears with time following the increase in absorbed dose. These changes show the progress of one-electron reduction of oxy-P450 and formation of the reduced oxy-P450 complex. To our knowledge, this is a first report of UV-visible spectra of this unstable reaction intermediate of cytochrome P450. This result complements the recent EPR studies of the same system (3Davydov R. Macdonald I.D.G. Makris T.M. Sligar S.G. Hoffman B.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 10654-10655Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 5Davydov R. Makris T.M. Kofman V. Werst D.E. Sligar S.G. Hoffman B.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 1403-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). In the EPR measurement, the direct conversion of oxy-P450 to reduced oxy-P450 cannot be observed, since the oxy-P450 is EPR-silent, and only the products of radiolytic reduction can be detected. The spectra in Fig. 2 A were used to estimate the spectrum of the pure reduced oxy-P450 intermediate. Concentration of the remaining oxy-P450 was estimated from these spectra by means of comparing the second derivatives of these spectra. The derivative peaks corresponding to the maxima at 417 and 440 nm are better resolved (results not shown), and hence the area of the former peak was used to calculate the decay in the oxy-P450 fraction with increase in dose. The remainder was assigned to the reduced oxy-P450 intermediate, the spectrum of the latter was then calculated using the experimental spectra at Fig.2 A by subtracting corresponding fractions of the oxy-P450 spectrum. The calculated spectrum of the pure reduced oxy-P450 intermediate is shown in Fig. 2 B together with the spectrum of pure oxy-P450 shown for comparison. Similar spectra were obtained with the samples of oxy-P450 prepared in 50 and 75% glycerol/water solutions and irradiated with γ-rays from60Co source with a 4–5-megarad total dose in several independent experiments. This suggests that the radiolytic reduction in frozen solution with solvated electrons acting as reducing species does not depend on the source of the primary radiolytic electrons, γ-photons, or high energy electrons from 32P radioactive decay. The observed similarity is not surprising, since32P, 3H, 35S, and other β-active isotopes have been shown to produce the same products of radiolysis in the aqueous solution as do γ-rays (33Hardwick T.J. Can. J. Chem. 1952; 30: 39-46Crossref Google Scholar, 34Peisach M. Steyn J. Nature. 1960; 187: 58-59Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 35Yamamoto O. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1982; 42: 661-665Google Scholar, 36Berezin I.V. Martinek K. Russian J. Phys. Chem. ( Eng. Transl. ). 1964; 38: 1468-1469Google Scholar). These results give a solid foundation for generating stable one-electron reduced intermediates at cryogenic temperatures in frozen solutions containing easily obtained β-emitting isotopes. The spectrum of the reduced oxy-P450 shown in Fig. 2 B is in excellent agreement with that calculated by Harris et al.(37Harris D. Loew G. Waskell L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 4308-4318Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar) for the same system. The pronounced split Soret band and 30-nm red shift were the main features of their calculated spectrum. Our experimentally obtained red shift is 23 nm, and the split Soret shape of the spectrum is remarkably similar to the theoretical results. Optical changes have also been observed using pulse radiolysis of oxycomplex of the deuteroheme-substituted cytochrome P450 CYP101 (8Kobayashi K. Amano M. Kanbara Y. Hayashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5445-5447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which are nearly identical to our results on the native metalloprotein containing protoporphyrin IX as a prosthetic group. The irreversible evolution of the reduced oxy-P450 reaction intermediate with temperature increase was monitored by the spectra shown in Fig. 3. The gradual annealing of the samples reduced radiolytically at 77 K results in the sequence of conformational relaxations and chemical transformations. At the same time, the various organic radicals, which appear as the products of glycerol radiolysis, gradually recombine and decay. These latter processes result in continuous changes of the background absorbance in the optical spectra in the visible and near UV range. To subtract this background, the spectra of the 75% glycerol/buffer solution without added cytochrome P450 were obtained. The reference sample was irradiated in identical conditions (total dose 5 megarads) and carefully annealed from 77 up to 240 K. In these experiments, spectra were taken every 4 K at temperatures above 140 K, where significant optical changes begin to occur. The resulting spectral array was used for background subtraction in the analysis of the enzyme spectra at different temperatures with the actual base line at each temperature calculated using linear interpolation with respect to the temperature. The calculated spectra of pure reduced oxy-P450 with subtracted base line as described are shown in Fig. 3 A in a three-dimensional representation. The simple visual inspection of these spectra shows only one main process, the decay of the primary reaction intermediate with a Soret maximum at 443 nm and concomitant increase in absorbance at 392 nm, a characteristic of the high spin ferric cytochrome P450. More careful analysis reveals two minor temperature-dependent spectral processes. The presence of only four spectrally distinguishable components was confirmed by singular value decomposition analysis (data not shown). All spectral changes are observed in the temperature interval 192–205 K and are presented in the more convenient form in Fig. 3 B. The first process is the red shift of the maximum from 440 to 443 nm in the narrow temperature interval 192–194 K, which is not accompanied by notable optical changes in other regions of the spectrum. This small shift could be due to protonation of superoxide anion bound to iron of the heme (5Davydov R. Makris T.M. Kofman V. Werst D.E. Sligar S.G. Hoffman B.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 1403-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), to thermal relaxation of the heme-ligand reduced complex, or to other relatively minor perturbation of the chromophore. At the same temperature, the beginning of the product formation is observed with the active reduced oxy-P450 intermediate decay. The amplitude of the peak at 443 nm decreases, the new peak appears at 417 nm, and the absorbance at 392 nm begins to increase. The Soret peak at 417 nm is characteristic of the low spin ferric cytochrome P450, the state at which the heme iron is hexacoordinated with the weak sixth ligand. In the CYP101 system, the appearance of this maximum can be assigned to the formation of the product-bound ferric cytochrome P450, the oxygen of the hydroxyl group in 5-exo-hydroxycamphor being coordinated with heme iron as a sixth ligand. The formation of this complex as an intermediate step before the product release, obtained at the same temperature in aqueous/glycerol solution was also determined by EPR spectroscopy (5Davydov R. Makris T.M. Kofman V. Werst D.E. Sligar S.G. Hoffman B.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 1403-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), and our optical data confirm this observation. The longer annealing at slightly higher temperatures results in the disappearance of the signal from this low spin product complex and an increase of absorbance at 392 nm from high spin ferric cytochrome P450. The stabilization and detection of the main putative active intermediate in cytochrome P450, proposed to have the main features of the “compound I” state of peroxidases, the oxoferryl porphyrin π-cation radical (38Groves J.T. Han Y. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry. Plenum Press, New York1995: 3-48Crossref Google Scholar, 39Watanabe Y. Kadish K.M. Smith K.M. Guilard R. The Porphyrin Handbook. Academic Press, Inc., New York2000: 97-117Google Scholar), remains a subject of debate. In radiolytic reduction and annealing experiments, we did not obtain any spectral evidence for the existence of this state. The only new intermediate observed is the peroxo (hydroperoxo) complex. The known features of a compound I-type spectra, namely a broad Soret maximum between 370 and 410 nm with relatively low amplitude and an increase of absorbance at 650–700 nm (40Cunningham I.D. Danks T.N. O'Connel K.T.A. Scott P.W. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1999; 2: 2133-2139Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar), were not observed. This may indicate that even at 200 K the active intermediate has high activity and is not accumulated at sufficient concentrations. Alternatively, the lack of the aforementioned features in visible spectra can be the result of the different electronic structure of the active intermediate in cytochrome P450 compared with the known analogs in chloroperoxidase, horseradish peroxidase, and model systems. Such a difference may involve, but certainly not be limited to, the different distribution of unpaired electron density due to the presence of thiolate proximal ligand (39Watanabe Y. Kadish K.M. Smith K.M. Guilard R. The Porphyrin Handbook. Academic Press, Inc., New York2000: 97-117Google Scholar,41Champion P.M. J. Am. Chem.

Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 7939-7940Crossref Scopus (175) Google Scholar). An alternative explanation involving a different active hydroxylating compound has been proposed by Newcomb and Toy (44Newcomb M. Toy P.H. Acc. Chem. Res. 2000; 33: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Recently, much more direct mechanistic evidences in favor of oxoferryl hydrogen abstraction and the subsequent oxygen rebound mechanism were obtained by means of EPR and ENDOR analysis of H/D exchangeable protons in all reaction intermediates (5Davydov R. Makris T.M. Kofman V. Werst D.E. Sligar S.G. Hoffman B.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 1403-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), although the direct observation of compound I was not achieved. However, using x-ray cryocrystallography, Schlichting et al. (4Schlichting I. Berendzen J. Chu K. Stock A.M. Maves S.A. Benson D.E. Sweet R.M. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Sligar S.G. Science. 2000; 287: 1615-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar) observed evidence for the transient formation of a single oxygen-containing intermediate in CYP101. Such an observation may be due to further stabilization of highly reactive intermediates by the crystal lattice or subtle differences in radiation chemistry in the tracks. In summary, we describe here a new application of radiation chemistry at cryogenic temperatures, the use of radioactive 32P as an internal source for generation of unstable intermediates of the cytochrome P450 CYP101 enzymatic cycle. The one-electron reduced oxy-P450 is stable at low temperatures (77–190 K) and undergoes a series of irreversible transformations resulting in formation of ferric P450 and the product (5Davydov R. Makris T.M. Kofman V. Werst D.E. Sligar S.G. Hoffman B.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 1403-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). The optical spectra of the reduced oxy-P450cam are in a good agreement with theoretical calculations. Thermal annealing monitored by optical spectroscopy confirms the results obtained on the same system using EPR (5Davydov R. Makris T.M. Kofman V. Werst D.E. Sligar S.G. Hoffman B.M. J. Am. Chem.

Using cells derived from human bronchial epithelial cells, we demonstrate that NF-κB and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) reciprocally regulate arsenic trioxide (arsenite)-induced, p53-independent expression of GADD45 protein, a cell cycle checkpoint protein that arrests cells at the G2/M phase transition. Inhibition of NF-κB activation by stable expression of a kinase-mutated form of IκB kinase caused increased and prolonged induction of GADD45 by arsenite. In contrast, the induction of GADD45 by arsenite was transient and less potent in cells where the NF-κB activation pathway was normal. Analysis of the cell cycle profile by flow cytometry indicated that NF-κB inhibition potentiates arsenite-induced G2/M cell cycle arrest. Abrogation of JNK activation, on the other hand, decreased GADD45 expression induced by arsenite, suggesting a role for JNK activation in GADD45 induction. These results indicate a molecular mechanism by which NF-κB and JNK may differentially contribute to cell cycle regulation in response to arsenite.

Toxicology. 2000; 144: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 2Kayajanian G.M. Ecotoxicol. Environ. Saf. 2000; 45: 195-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, arsenic has also been used for centuries for medicinal purposes, as for the treatment of syphilis and leukemias (3Zhu X.H. Shen Y.L. Jing Y.K. Cai X. Jia P.M. Huang Y. Tang W. Shi G.Y. Sun Y.P. Dai J. Wang Z.Y. Chen S.J. Zhang T.D. Waxman S. Chen Z. Chen G.Q. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1999; 91: 772-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 4Akao Y. Yamada H. Nakagawa Y. Leuk.

Blood. 1999; 94: 2844-2853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanistic basis for the carcinogenic or therapeutic effects of arsenic is still poorly understood. Arsenic is usually considered a nongenotoxic agent and is assumed to act principally through an epigenetic effect by interfering with intracellular signaling molecules that lead to cell cycle progression, DNA repair, ubiquitination, tubulin polymerization, transcription factor activation, and oncogene expression (6Cavigelli M. Li W.W. Lin A. Su B. Yoshioka K. Karin M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6269-6279Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 7Hayes R.B. Cancer Causes Control. 1997; 8: 371-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Arsenic trioxide (arsenite), rather than arsenic pentoxide, has been credited with most of the intracellular effects, although these two forms can interconvert via an intracellular redox pathway (7Hayes R.B. Cancer Causes Control. 1997; 8: 371-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Studies by Cavigelli et al. (6Cavigelli M. Li W.W. Lin A. Su B. Yoshioka K. Karin M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6269-6279Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) indicated that arsenite is far more potent than arsenic pentoxide in stimulating AP-1 transcriptional activity, indicating that arsenite is a more important carcinogen. It has been speculated that the toxicity of arsenite is due to its affinity for thiol groups of proteins and possibly from its induction of oxidative bursts that cause a stress response in the cells.Both NF-κB and AP-1 are considered stress response transcription factors that govern the expression of a variety of proinflammatory and cytotoxic genes (8Karin M. Delhase M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9067-9069Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). NF-κB, a heterodimer composed of two subunits, p50 and p65, is regulated by specific inhibitors, the IκBs, which retain NF-κB in the cytoplasm of nonstimulated cells (9Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5542) Google Scholar, 10Chen F. Castranova V. Shi X. Demers L.M. Clin. Chem. 1999; 45: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). In response to stress signals, the IκBs undergo rapid phosphorylation of conserved N-terminal serine sites by IκB kinase (IKK)1 complexes. This phosphorylation is an essential step required for subsequent ubiquitination and degradation of IκBs by SCF-β-TrCP and proteasome, respectively (11Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4043) Google Scholar). IκB degradation allows NF-κB dimers to translocate into nuclei and activate the transcription of target genes. Unlike NF-κB, AP-1 heterodimers are constitutively localized within the nuclei. Transactivation of AP-1 is achieved largely through phosphorylation of its activation domains by c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) (8Karin M. Delhase M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9067-9069Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar).It has been well established that various types of stress including DNA damage, oxidation and hypoxia, induce cell cycle arrest, allowing time for DNA repair and thus protecting the organism from the deleterious consequences of mutation (12Chan T.A. Hermeking H. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1999; 401: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar, 13Piwnica-Worms H. Nature. 1999; 401: 535Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, the cell cycle arrest is often dependent upon the expression and functionality of cell cycle inhibitory proteins such as GADD45 (the growtharrest- and DNA damage-inducible protein 45), a protein responsible for the maintenance of the G2/M checkpoint that prevents improper mitosis (14Fornace Jr., A.J.

Extracellullar stress signals induce rapid expression of GADD45 in a manner that may be either p53-dependent or p53-independent (16Yu J. Zhang L. Hwang P.M. Rago C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc.

The objective of the present report is to investigate the roles of NF-κB and JNK in the expression of GADD45 induced by arsenite in cell lines derived from human bronchial epithelial cells. We provide evidence in this report that arsenite is capable of inducing activation of NF-κB and JNK and expression of GADD45. We demonstrate that interruption of NF-κB activation by blocking IKKβ kinase activity enhances JNK activation and p53-independent GADD45 expression induced by arsenite. In contrast, blockage of JNK activation results in decreased GADD45 induction.DISCUSSIONThe adverse or beneficial effects of arsenic on humans may depend upon the manner of exposure and type of cell or tissue exposed. It is known that inhalation of arsenic-containing particles from either environmental pollutants or occupational sources can lead to debilitating lung diseases such as cancer (28Lubin J.H. Pottern L.M. Stone B.J. Fraumeni Jr., J.F. Am. J. Epidemiol. 2000; 151: 554-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The bronchial epithelial cell is one of the first cell types to come in contact with inhaled matter. Therefore, we used a cell line derived from human bronchial epithelial cells, BEAS-2B, to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the adverse effects of arsenic. The present study demonstrates that NF-κB and JNK are reciprocal regulators for arsenite-induced, p53-independent expression of GADD45, a G2/M cell cycle checkpoint protein. Following inhibition of NF-κB by stable expression of IKKβ-KM, arsenite induced a prolonged increase in GADD45 expression (Fig. 3, A and B). On the other hand, in IKKβ-expressing cells where the NF-κB activation pathway is normal, arsenite induced a transient and less potent expression of GADD45 (Fig. 3, A and B). These results suggest that NF-κB activation may be unfavorable for the induction of cell cycle checkpoint proteins that maintain genomic integrity. GADD45 has been considered a p53 target gene whose transcription/expression is dependent on the activation of p53 (16Yu J. Zhang L. Hwang P.M. Rago C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14517-14522Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar,29Zhao R. Gish K. Murphy M. Yin Y. Notterman D. Hoffman W.H. Tom E. Mack D.H. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 981-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Several p53 binding sites have been identified in the regions of the promoter, intron 1, intron 2, and intron 3 of GADD45 genes (30Zhan Q. Carrier F. Fornace Jr., A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4242-4250Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). However, the cells used in the present report were previously shown to be functionally p53-deficient (26Lehman T.A. Modali R. Boukamp P. Stanek J. Bennett W.P. Welsh J.A. Metcalf R.A. Stampfer M.R. Fusenig N. Rogan E.M. et al.Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 31Gerwin B.I. Spillare E. Forrester K. Lehman T.A. Kispert J. Welsh J.A. Pfeifer A.M. Lechner J.F. Baker S.J. Vogelstein B. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2759-2763Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the fact that arsenite neither induced N-terminal phosphorylation of p53 protein as reported in the present studies nor induced p53-dependent reporter gene activity as demonstrated by Huang et al. (32Huang C. Ma W.Y. Li J. Dong Z. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3053-3058PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that the induction of GADD45 by arsenite is through a p53-independent pathway.Transcriptional regulation of genes by NF-κB has been described extensively (9Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5542) Google Scholar, 10Chen F. Castranova V. Shi X. Demers L.M. Clin. Chem. 1999; 45: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). However, only a few recent reports have demonstrated a nontranscriptional or repressive transcriptional regulation of NF-κB on cellular genes. In differentiating myocytes, Guttridge et al. (33Guttridge D.C. Mayo M.W. Madrid L.V. Wang C.Y. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 2000; 289: 2363-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar) demonstrated that NF-κB activated by tumor necrosis factor α down-regulated MyoD mRNA at a post-transcriptional level. In rat L6 muscle cells, studies by Duet al. (34Du J. Mitch W.E. Wang X. Price S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19661-19666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) indicated a negative transcriptional regulation by NF-κB on a gene encoding proteasome C3 subunit. It is unclear whether the negative regulation of NF-κB on GADD45 observed in the present studies is similar to that seen with MyoD or proteasome C3 subunit. Analysis of GADD45 gene revealed several consensus κB sites or κB-like sites in the promoter and intron regions. 2Chen et al., unpublished observations. We are currently investigating whether these NF-κB binding sites contribute to the down-regulation of GADD45 induced by arsenite by generating GADD45 gene reporter constructs with various deletion mutants.The relationship between GADD45 expression and JNK activation has not been clearly demonstrated. JNK is rapidly activated by exposure of cells to a variety of stress signals including UV light, γ-radiation, and toxic metals (35Dickens M. Rogers J.S. Cavanagh J. Raitano A. Xia Z. Halpern J.R. Greenberg M.E. Sawyers C.L. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 277: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 36Chen F. Demers L.M. Vallyathan V. Ding M. Lu Y. Castranova V. Shi X. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1998; 275: L551-L558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A yeast two-hybrid screen indicated that GADD45 interacts with MEKK4, an MAPK kinase kinase activating JNK and p38, suggesting a requirement of GADD45 for JNK activation (38Takekawa M. Saito H. Cell. 1998; 95: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). This notion, however, was not supported by two follow-up studies using embryonic fibroblasts derived from gadd45-null mice or cells in which the GADD45 expression was diminished (39Shaulian E. Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29595-29598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 40Wang X. Gorospe M. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29599-29602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Treatment of gadd45+/+ and gadd45−/− cells with ultraviolet C, hydrogen peroxide, and other stress inducers revealed no deficiency in JNK activation in gadd45−/− cells (39Shaulian E. Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29595-29598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In our studies, we noted that JNK activation by arsenite preceded arsenite-induced GADD45 expression. JNK activation was apparent as early as 1 h after arsenite stimulation, a time point where no appreciable induction of GADD45 was seen (Fig. 3 B). Similarly, dose-response studies suggest that a slightly higher dose of arsenite is required for GADD45 induction (Fig. 2 B) than that for JNK induction (Fig.3 A). Finally, inhibition of JNK activation partially reduced GADD45 expression induced by arsenite (Fig. 4 C). Therefore, it is likely that JNK activation is an upstream, rather than a downstream, event in GADD45 induction by arsenite.Several reports appeared describing the effects of arsenite on the activation of either NF-κB or JNK during the preparation of this manuscript. Using BEAS-2B cells, the same cell line used for stable transfection of IKKβ or IKKβ-KM described in the present studies, Roussel and Barchowsky (41Roussel R.R. Barchowsky A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 377: 204-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) reported that 500 μm arsenite inhibited tumor necrosis factor-induced NF-κB activation by directly blocking IKK activity. We found that lower concentrations of arsenite, from 5 to 20 μm, were capable of activating NF-κB in a dose-dependent manner, whereas higher concentrations of arsenite, more than 40 μm, inhibited NF-κB activation as indicated by the NF-κB-dependent reporter gene assay (Fig. 1 B). This inhibitory effect of arsenite on NF-κB at higher concentrations is largely because of its cytotoxic effects in our experimental system. 3Chen et al., manuscript in preparation. In HeLa cells and HEK293 cells, arsenite has been shown to be able to bind to cysteine 179 of IKKβ and inhibit IKK activity induced by tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin 1, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (42Kapahi P. Takahashi T. Natoli G. Adams S.R. Chen Y. Tsien R.Y. Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36062-36066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Therefore, the observed activation of NF-κB by arsenite in the present report may indicate an alternative mechanism of NF-κB activation that is possibly independent of IKK. In bladder epithelial cells, Simeonova et al. (43Simeonova P.P. Wang S. Toriuma W. Kommineni V. Matheson J. Unimye N. Kayama F. Harki D. Ding M. Vallyathan V. Luster M.I. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3445-3453PubMed Google Scholar) noted that 5 to 50 μm arsenite activated AP-1 DNA binding activity and GADD45 gene expression, indicating an involvement of JNK or other MAP kinases in the induction of GADD45 by arsenite. The upstream signaling molecules leading to activation of JNK and IKK in response to arsenite remain to be defined. It has been demonstrated that p21-activated kinase is required for arsenite-induced JNK activation (44Porter A.C. Fanger G.R. Vaillancourt R.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7794-7802Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). It would be interesting to determine whether p21-activated kinase is also involved in arsenite-induced IKK activation.The observations on the effects of NF-κB and JNK on arsenite-induced, p53-independent GADD45 expression not only provide mechanistic clues concerning the effects of arsenic but may also aid in developing new strategies for the therapeutic use of arsenic in certain types of leukemias. In most tissues or cells, where the activation pathway of NF-κB is normal, arsenite may be carcinogenic because of the activation of NF-κB that may prevent induction of cell cycle checkpoint proteins that maintain genomic stability. The therapeutic use of arsenite in certain diseases, such as leukemias, may require strategies for the simultaneous inhibition of NF-κB. Such a combination may potentiate the anticancer effects of arsenite by increasing the induction of checkpoint proteins that either arrest cell cycle progression or facilitate cell apoptosis. It has long been known that environmental and occupational exposure to arsenic causes a number of human diseases including skin lesions, peripheral vascular disorders, peripheral neuropathy, liver injury, and cancers in lung or other organs (1Gebel T. Toxicology. 2000; 144: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 2Kayajanian G.M. Ecotoxicol. Environ. Saf. 2000; 45: 195-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, arsenic has also been used for centuries for medicinal purposes, as for the treatment of syphilis and leukemias (3Zhu X.H. Shen Y.L. Jing Y.K. Cai X. Jia P.M. Huang Y. Tang W. Shi G.Y. Sun Y.P. Dai J. Wang Z.Y. Chen S.J. Zhang T.D. Waxman S. Chen Z. Chen G.Q. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1999; 91: 772-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 4Akao Y. Yamada H. Nakagawa Y. Leuk. Lymphoma. 2000; 37: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 5Estrov Z. Manna S.K. Harris D. Van Q. Estey E.H. Kantarjian H.M. Talpaz M. Aggarwal B.B. Blood. 1999; 94: 2844-2853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanistic basis for the carcinogenic or therapeutic effects of arsenic is still poorly understood. Arsenic is usually considered a nongenotoxic agent and is assumed to act principally through an epigenetic effect by interfering with intracellular signaling molecules that lead to cell cycle progression, DNA repair, ubiquitination, tubulin polymerization, transcription factor activation, and oncogene expression (6Cavigelli M. Li W.W. Lin A. Su B. Yoshioka K. Karin M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6269-6279Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 7Hayes R.B. Cancer Causes Control. 1997; 8: 371-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Arsenic trioxide (arsenite), rather than arsenic pentoxide, has been credited with most of the intracellular effects, although these two forms can interconvert via an intracellular redox pathway (7Hayes R.B. Cancer Causes Control. 1997; 8: 371-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Studies by Cavigelli et al. (6Cavigelli M. Li W.W. Lin A. Su B. Yoshioka K. Karin M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6269-6279Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) indicated that arsenite is far more potent than arsenic pentoxide in stimulating AP-1 transcriptional activity, indicating that arsenite is a more important carcinogen. It has been speculated that the toxicity of arsenite is due to its affinity for thiol groups of proteins and possibly from its induction of oxidative bursts that cause a stress response in the cells. Both NF-κB and AP-1 are considered stress response transcription factors that govern the expression of a variety of proinflammatory and cytotoxic genes (8Karin M. Delhase M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9067-9069Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). NF-κB, a heterodimer composed of two subunits, p50 and p65, is regulated by specific inhibitors, the IκBs, which retain NF-κB in the cytoplasm of nonstimulated cells (9Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5542) Google Scholar, 10Chen F. Castranova V. Shi X. Demers L.M. Clin. Chem. 1999; 45: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). In response to stress signals, the IκBs undergo rapid phosphorylation of conserved N-terminal serine sites by IκB kinase (IKK)1 complexes. This phosphorylation is an essential step required for subsequent ubiquitination and degradation of IκBs by SCF-β-TrCP and proteasome, respectively (11Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4043) Google Scholar). IκB degradation allows NF-κB dimers to translocate into nuclei and activate the transcription of target genes. Unlike NF-κB, AP-1 heterodimers are constitutively localized within the nuclei. Transactivation of AP-1 is achieved largely through phosphorylation of its activation domains by c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) (8Karin M. Delhase M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9067-9069Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). It has been well established that various types of stress including DNA damage, oxidation and hypoxia, induce cell cycle arrest, allowing time for DNA repair and thus protecting the organism from the deleterious consequences of mutation (12Chan T.A. Hermeking H. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1999; 401: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar, 13Piwnica-Worms H. Nature. 1999; 401: 535Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, the cell cycle arrest is often dependent upon the expression and functionality of cell cycle inhibitory proteins such as GADD45 (the growtharrest- and DNA damage-inducible protein 45), a protein responsible for the maintenance of the G2/M checkpoint that prevents improper mitosis (14Fornace Jr., A.J. Alamo Jr., I. Hollander M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8800-8804Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar,15Wang X.W. Zhan Q. Coursen J.D. Khan M.A. Kontny H.U., Yu, L.

Extracellullar stress signals induce rapid expression of GADD45 in a manner that may be either p53-dependent or p53-independent (16Yu J. Zhang L. Hwang P.M. Rago C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14517-14522Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 17O'Reilly M.A. Staversky R.J. Watkins R.H. Maniscalco W.M. Keng P.C. Am. J.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4050-4057Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Both NF-κB and JNK are well known stress sensors that can be rapidly activated in response to stress (19Manna S.K. Zhang H.J. Yan T. Oberley L.W. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13245-13254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 20Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar). NF-κB and JNK have also been implicated in cell cycle regulation under certain circumstances.

DISCUSSIONThe adverse or beneficial effects of arsenic on humans may depend upon the manner of exposure and type of cell or tissue exposed. It is known that inhalation of arsenic-containing particles from either environmental pollutants or occupational sources can lead to debilitating lung diseases such as cancer (28Lubin J.H. Pottern L.M. Stone B.J. Fraumeni Jr., J.F. Am. J. Epidemiol. 2000; 151: 554-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The bronchial epithelial cell is one of the first cell types to come in contact with inhaled matter. Therefore, we used a cell line derived from human bronchial epithelial cells, BEAS-2B, to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the adverse effects of arsenic. The present study demonstrates that NF-κB and JNK are reciprocal regulators for arsenite-induced, p53-independent expression of GADD45, a G2/M cell cycle checkpoint protein.

Furthermore, the fact that arsenite neither induced N-terminal phosphorylation of p53 protein as reported in the present studies nor induced p53-dependent reporter gene activity as demonstrated by Huang et al. (32Huang C. Ma W.Y. Li J. Dong Z.

Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3445-3453PubMed Google Scholar) noted that 5 to 50 μm arsenite activated AP-1 DNA binding activity and GADD45 gene expression, indicating an involvement of JNK or other MAP kinases in the induction of GADD45 by arsenite. The upstream signaling molecules leading to activation of JNK and IKK in response to arsenite remain to be defined. It has been demonstrated that p21-activated kinase is required for arsenite-induced JNK activation (44Porter A.C. Fanger G.R. Vaillancourt R.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7794-7802Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). It would be interesting to determine whether p21-activated kinase is also involved in arsenite-induced IKK activation.The observations on the effects of NF-κB and JNK on arsenite-induced, p53-independent GADD45 expression not only provide mechanistic clues concerning the effects of arsenic but may also aid in developing new strategies for the therapeutic use of arsenic in certain types of leukemias. In most tissues or cells, where the activation pathway of NF-κB is normal, arsenite may be carcinogenic because of the activation of NF-κB that may prevent induction of cell cycle checkpoint proteins that maintain genomic stability. The therapeutic use of arsenite in certain diseases, such as leukemias, may require strategies for the simultaneous inhibition of NF-κB. Such a combination may potentiate the anticancer effects of arsenite by increasing the induction of checkpoint proteins that either arrest cell cycle progression or facilitate cell apoptosis. The adverse or beneficial effects of arsenic on humans may depend upon the manner of exposure and type of cell or tissue exposed. It is known that inhalation of arsenic-containing particles from either environmental pollutants or occupational sources can lead to debilitating lung diseases such as cancer (28Lubin J.H. Pottern L.M. Stone B.J. Fraumeni Jr., J.F. Am. J. Epidemiol. 2000; 151: 554-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The bronchial epithelial cell is one of the first cell types to come in contact with inhaled matter. Therefore, we used a cell line derived from human bronchial epithelial cells, BEAS-2B, to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the adverse effects of arsenic. The present study demonstrates that NF-κB and JNK are reciprocal regulators for arsenite-induced, p53-independent expression of GADD45, a G2/M cell cycle checkpoint protein. Following inhibition of NF-κB by stable expression of IKKβ-KM, arsenite induced a prolonged increase in GADD45 expression (Fig. 3, A and B). On the other hand, in IKKβ-expressing cells where the NF-κB activation pathway is normal, arsenite induced a transient and less potent expression of GADD45 (Fig. 3, A and B). These results suggest that NF-κB activation may be unfavorable for the induction of cell cycle checkpoint proteins that maintain genomic integrity. GADD45 has been considered a p53 target gene whose transcription/expression is dependent on the activation of p53 (16Yu J. Zhang L. Hwang P.M. Rago C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14517-14522Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar,29Zhao R. Gish K. Murphy M. Yin Y. Notterman D. Hoffman W.H. Tom E. Mack D.H. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 981-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Several p53 binding sites have been identified in the regions of the promoter, intron 1, intron 2, and intron 3 of GADD45 genes (30Zhan Q. Carrier F. Fornace Jr., A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4242-4250Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). However, the cells used in the present report were previously shown to be functionally p53-deficient (26Lehman T.A. Modali R. Boukamp P. Stanek J. Bennett W.P. Welsh J.A. Metcalf R.A. Stampfer M.R. Fusenig N. Rogan E.M. et al.Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 31Gerwin B.I.

A. 1992; 89: 2759-2763Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the fact that arsenite neither induced N-terminal phosphorylation of p53 protein as reported in the present studies nor induced p53-dependent reporter gene activity as demonstrated by Huang et al. (32Huang C. Ma W.Y. Li J. Dong Z. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3053-3058PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that the induction of GADD45 by arsenite is through a p53-independent pathway. Transcriptional regulation of genes by NF-κB has been described extensively (9Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5542) Google Scholar, 10Chen F. Castranova V. Shi X. Demers L.M. Clin. Chem. 1999; 45: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). However, only a few recent reports have demonstrated a nontranscriptional or repressive transcriptional regulation of NF-κB on cellular genes. In differentiating myocytes, Guttridge et al. (33Guttridge D.C. Mayo M.W. Madrid L.V. Wang C.Y. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 2000; 289: 2363-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar) demonstrated that NF-κB activated by tumor necrosis factor α down-regulated MyoD mRNA at a post-transcriptional level. In rat L6 muscle cells, studies by Duet al. (34Du J. Mitch W.E. Wang X. Price S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19661-19666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) indicated a negative transcriptional regulation by NF-κB on a gene encoding proteasome C3 subunit. It is unclear whether the negative regulation of NF-κB on GADD45 observed in the present studies is similar to that seen with MyoD or proteasome C3 subunit. Analysis of GADD45 gene revealed several consensus κB sites or κB-like sites in the promoter and intron regions. 2Chen et al., unpublished observations. We are currently investigating whether these NF-κB binding sites contribute to the down-regulation of GADD45 induced by arsenite by generating GADD45 gene reporter constructs with various deletion mutants. The relationship between GADD45 expression and JNK activation has not been clearly demonstrated. JNK is rapidly activated by exposure of cells to a variety of stress signals including UV light, γ-radiation, and toxic metals (35Dickens M. Rogers J.S. Cavanagh J. Raitano A. Xia Z. Halpern J.R. Greenberg M.E. Sawyers C.L. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 277: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 36Chen F. Demers L.M. Vallyathan V. Ding M. Lu Y. Castranova V. Shi X. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1998; 275: L551-L558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A yeast two-hybrid screen indicated that GADD45 interacts with MEKK4, an MAPK kinase kinase activating JNK and p38, suggesting a requirement of GADD45 for JNK activation (38Takekawa M. Saito H. Cell. 1998; 95: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). This notion, however, was not supported by two follow-up studies using embryonic fibroblasts derived from gadd45-null mice or cells in which the GADD45 expression was diminished (39Shaulian E. Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29595-29598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 40Wang X. Gorospe M. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29599-29602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Treatment of gadd45+/+ and gadd45−/− cells with ultraviolet C, hydrogen peroxide, and other stress inducers revealed no deficiency in JNK activation in gadd45−/− cells (39Shaulian E. Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29595-29598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In our studies, we noted that JNK activation by arsenite preceded arsenite-induced GADD45 expression. JNK activation was apparent as early as 1 h after arsenite stimulation, a time point where no appreciable induction of GADD45 was seen (Fig. 3 B). Similarly, dose-response studies suggest that a slightly higher dose of arsenite is required for GADD45 induction (Fig. 2 B) than that for JNK induction (Fig.3 A). Finally, inhibition of JNK activation partially reduced GADD45 expression induced by arsenite (Fig. 4 C). Therefore, it is likely that JNK activation is an upstream, rather than a downstream, event in GADD45 induction by arsenite. Several reports appeared describing the effects of arsenite on the activation of either NF-κB or JNK during the preparation of this manuscript. Using BEAS-2B cells, the same cell line used for stable transfection of IKKβ or IKKβ-KM described in the present studies, Roussel and Barchowsky (41Roussel R.R. Barchowsky A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 377: 204-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) reported that 500 μm arsenite inhibited tumor necrosis factor-induced NF-κB activation by directly blocking IKK activity. We found that lower concentrations of arsenite, from 5 to 20 μm, were capable of activating NF-κB in a dose-dependent manner, whereas higher concentrations of arsenite, more than 40 μm, inhibited NF-κB activation as indicated by the NF-κB-dependent reporter gene assay (Fig. 1 B). This inhibitory effect of arsenite on NF-κB at higher concentrations is largely because of its cytotoxic effects in our experimental system. 3Chen et al., manuscript in preparation. In HeLa cells and HEK293 cells, arsenite has been shown to be able to bind to cysteine 179 of IKKβ and inhibit IKK activity induced by tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin 1, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (42Kapahi P.

Therefore, the observed activation of NF-κB by arsenite in the present report may indicate an alternative mechanism of NF-κB activation that is possibly independent of IKK.

Here we report the molecular cloning and characterization of one of these genes, designatedTMX, that encodes a novel protein of 280 amino acid residues. The TMX protein possesses an N-terminal signal peptide followed by one thioredoxin (Trx)-like domain with a unique active site sequence, Cys-Pro-Ala-Cys, and a potential transmembrane domain. There are putative TMX homologs with identical active site sequences in theCaenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila genomes. Using recombinant proteins expressed in Escherichia coli, we demonstrated the activity of the Trx domain of TMX to cleave the interchain disulfide bridges in insulin in vitro. TheTMX transcript is widely expressed in normal human tissues, and subcellular fractionation and immunostaining for an epitope-tagged TMX protein suggest that TMX is predominantly localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). When TMX was expressed in HEK293 cells, it significantly suppressed the apoptosis induced by brefeldin A, an inhibitor of ER-Golgi transport.

J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13963-13966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Trx is characterized by two cysteine residues within the conserved active site sequence, CGPC, and many Trx-like proteins are members of the Trx superfamily (4Nakamura H. Yodoi J. Curr. Trends Immunol. 1998; 1: 133-140Google Scholar). Trx shows various functions via reversible oxidation and reduction of these two cysteine residues. Oxidized Trx (Trx-S2) in which the two cysteine residues form an intramolecular disulfide bond is reduced by thioredoxin reductase and NADPH (2Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reduced Trx (Trx-(SH)2) contains two thiol groups and can catalyze the reduction of disulfide bonds in multiple substrate proteins (2Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13963-13966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Trx is involved in many thiol-dependent cellular processes, including gene expression, signal transduction, and proliferation. Trx functions as a hydrogen donor for ribonucleotide reductase, an essential enzyme providing deoxyribonucleotides for DNA synthesis (2Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Trx also modulates the DNA binding activity of transcription factors such as AP-1, nuclear factor-κB, glucocorticoid receptor, and estrogen receptor (5Hirota K. Matsui M. Iwata S. Nishiyama A.

Trx has also been discovered as an adult T-cell leukemia-derived factor produced by human T-cell leukemia virus-I-transformed T-cells, or as interleukin-1-like factor produced by Epstein-Barr virus-transformed cells (9Tagaya Y.

In these cases, Trx was found to be involved in cell activation and growth promotion (11Wakasugi N. Tagaya Y. Wakasugi H. Mitsui A. Maeda M. Yodoi J. Tursz T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Miranda-Vizuete A. Gustafsson J-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2936-2941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), nucleoredoxin (15Kurooka H. Kato K. Minoguchi S. Takahashi Y. Ikeda J. Habu S. Osawa N. Buchberg A.M. Moriwaki K. Shisa H. Honjo T. Genomics. 1997; 39: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and TRP32 (16Lee K.-K. Murakawa M.

The active site sequences of Trx2 and TRP32 (CGPC) are identical to that of Trx. Trx2 and TRP32 are localized in the mitochondria and the cytoplasm, respectively. Nucleoredoxin is a nuclear protein with a modified active site sequence, CPPC. These proteins seem to be involved in the various redox regulations, but the precise biological functions are not well understood.The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is well characterized as an organelle in which secretory proteins are folded and processed before export from the cell (17Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3575) Google Scholar). The ER also functions as a mobilizable calcium store that sequesters excess cytosolic calcium and acts as a reservoir for calcium signaling (18Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. Volpe P. Meldolesi J. Physiol. Rev. 1994; 74: 595-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The ER undergoes stress responses when secretory proteins are misfolded or calcium balance is perturbed. Although severe stress in the ER can result in apoptosis through ER-specific caspase-12 (19Nakagawa T. Zhu H Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2926) Google Scholar), the ER stands against relatively mild stresses by the unfolded protein response (20Sidrauski C. Chapman R. Walter P. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 245-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), suppression of translation (21Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Ron D. Nature. 1999; 397: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (2478) Google Scholar), induction of Golgi-ER backward transport (22Hammond C. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), and activation of the accumulating protein transport to proteasome (23Kopito R.R. Cell. 1997; 88: 427-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar,24Zhou M. Schekman R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 925-934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). These quality control mechanisms in ER have been extensively studied, and many ER-associated proteins involved in such processes have been identified. Among them, protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), a member of the Trx superfamily, is well characterized as a foldase that assists disulfide bond formation (25Freedman R.B. Hirst T.R. Tuite M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 331-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 26Noiva R. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3553-3556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In this study, we have characterized a novel protein, TMX, encoded by a gene previously isolated as a transforming growth factor (TGF)-β-responsive gene (27Akiyama N. Matsuo Y. Sai H. Noda M. Kizaka-Kondoh S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3266-3273Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). TMX possesses one Trx-like domain with a unique potential active site sequence, CPAC, and bacterially expressed TMX indeed show Trx-like reducing activity in vitro. The sequence analysis also suggested that TMX has an N-terminal signal sequence and a transmembrane domain. A tagged TMX was predominantly localized in the ER and overexpression of TMX significantly reduced the ER stress induced by brefeldin A (BFA), an inhibitor of ER-Golgi transport. These data suggest that TMX is a novel member of the Trx family and may function to help relieve ER stresses.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have characterized a novel Trx-related protein encoded by a gene identified as one of the TGF-β-responsive genes isolated by a retrovirus-mediated gene trap screening (27Akiyama N. Matsuo Y. Sai H. Noda M. Kizaka-Kondoh S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3266-3273Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This gene is widely expressed in normal human tissues (Fig. 3). Because the product of this gene contains one redox active site, a signal sequence, and a transmembrane domain, we named it transmembrane Trx-related protein (TMX). When TMX was tagged with FLAG epitope at its N terminus, the product was rarely detectable with anti-FLAG antibody (data not shown), supporting the prediction that the N terminus may serve as a signal peptide.The TMX cDNA was found to largely overlap with the human hypothetical cDNA clone DKFZp564E1962 whose sequence was previously deposited in the databases (GenBankTM/EBI accession no.AL080080). The 5′ region of this cDNA clone extends up to the 23rd nucleotide upstream of the translation initiation codon, and this segment lacks an inframe stop codon, which we found at 81 bases upstream of the initiation codon (Fig. 1). When homology protein searches were performed against databases of other species, two conceptual translation products in C. elegans andDrosophila were found with high identity scores. They share an identical active site sequence and structural similarity with TMX even outside of the Trx-like domain (Fig. 2 B). The strong sequence conservation in these distantly related species suggests the possibility that they compose a novel Trx family.Although the potential active site sequence of TMX, CPAC, has not been found in any other mammalian proteins with a Trx-domain, the sequence has Trx-like reducing activity when detected by the insulin disulfide reducing assay (Fig. 5), a classical spectrophotometric assay detecting the reduction of the two interchain disulfide bonds of insulin (31Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9627-9632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Replacement of two cysteine residues in the redox active site to serines resulted in a complete loss of the reductase activity of TMX protein. These results suggest the potential function of TMX as an oxidoreductase with the novel active site sequence.The TMX amino acid sequence predicts that TMX may be a type I membrane protein; the Trx-like domain in the N-terminal half protrudes on the luminal side of the ER. Sequence analysis of TMX revealed no known motifs for subcellular localization. Analysis with the Myc-tagged protein revealed that TMX is probably localized primarily in the ER (Fig. 4 B), where another protein family with Trx-like domains, PDI, also exists. PDI contains two Trx-like domains and catalyzes the disulfide bond formation (25Freedman R.B. Hirst T.R. Tuite M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 331-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 26Noiva R. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3553-3556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The retention of some proteins in the ER is known to depend on the presence of the C-terminal sorting signals such as KDEL (39Munro S. Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1987; 48: 899-907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar) and the double lysine motif (KKXX or KXKXX) (40Jackson M.R. Nilsson T. Peterson P.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3153-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). There is a KDEL motif at the C terminus of PDI, and it resides in the lumen of the ER (26Noiva R. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3553-3556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is no such ER-retention motif at the C terminus of TMX, and the localization pattern of overexpressed protein did not change when the Myc epitope was inserted immediate to the C-terminal site of the predicted signal sequence (SS) cleavage site (SS-Myc·TMX, data not shown), suggesting that the ER retention mechanism for TMX is independent of the C-terminal sequence.The cell fractionation experiments suggest that a low level of TMX·Myc was expressed on the plasma membrane (Fig. 4 A). However, when the staining patterns of TMX·Myc or SS-Myc·TMX was compared with that of GPI-anchored EGFP, overlapped staining on the plasma membrane was not obvious (Fig. 4 B and data not shown). Therefore it has remained unclear whether some TMX protein can be localized on the plasma membrane. Because we could not exclude the possibility that the tagging of the Myc epitope might lead to the mislocalization of the protein, the localization of endogenous protein should be elucidated by using specific antibodies against TMX itself.The accumulation of unfolded or abnormal proteins and the disruption of ER calcium homeostasis give rise to ER stress, and excess or prolonged stress results in apoptosis (41Welihinda A.A. Tirasophon W. Kaufman R.J. Gene Expr. 1999; 7: 293-300PubMed Google Scholar). BFA is an effective ER stress inducer and was shown to induce apoptotic cell death in several human tumor cell lines (42Shao R-G. Shimizu T. Pommier Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 227: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 43Guo H. Tittle T.V. Allen H. Maziarz R.T. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 245: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). BFA, a small fungal metabolite, has been shown to alter the function of the Golgi and trans-Golgi network, disrupt the traffic between endosomes and lysosomes, and inhibit protein secretion and synthesis because of impairment of vesicular transport (44Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1537) Google Scholar, 45Chardin P. McCormick F. Cell. 1999; 97: 153-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). In this study, we showed that the overexpression of TMX could relieve the ER stress induced by BFA (Fig. 6 A). The apoptosis suppression by TMX was rather specific to BFA; no resistance was observed in the TMX-expressing HEK293 cells to other ER stress inducers such as thapsigargin and calcium ionophore A23187. BFA disrupts protein trafficking and Golgi morphology by inhibiting Golgi-associated guanine nucleotide exchange factors that activate ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs) (45Chardin P. McCormick F. Cell. 1999; 97: 153-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). At the moment, it is unclear whether TMX interferes with the action of BFA or during later events leading to cell death. In the former case, TMX may bind and/or inactivate BFA itself or may by an unknown mechanism reactivate ARFs. In the latter case, an interesting possibility, among others, would be that TMX, like Ire1 (46Tirasophon W. Welihinda A.A. Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1812-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar, 47Wang X.-Z. Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Jolicoeur E.M. Kuroda M. Ron D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5708-5717Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar) and ATF6 (48Yoshida H. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33741-33749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar, 49Haze K. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3787-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar), functions as a stress sensor residing on the ER membrane, detecting the accumulation of unfolded proteins and activating downstream anti-stress response. Alternatively, TMX may modify certain proteins with its oxidoreductase activity thereby suppressing ER stress-induced cell death.Our previous results indicated that the level of TMXmRNA was increased by about 2-fold after TGF-β treatment (27Akiyama N. Matsuo Y. Sai H. Noda M. Kizaka-Kondoh S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3266-3273Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The functional relationship between TGF-β and TMX is presently unclear. RNA blot analysis revealed that BFA treatment (0.2 μg/ml) for 24 h did not increase the level of TMX mRNA (data not shown), indicating that ER stress itself does not influenceTMX expression. No alteration was observed in the interaction between Smad3 and Smad4 or in the expression of these proteins in the HEK293 cells coexpressing TMX and Smad3 and/or Smad4 (data not shown), suggesting that TMX may not have direct effects on the TGF-β signal transduction pathway. Further study is needed to test the interesting possibility that TMX serves as an essential target for TGF-β signaling and mediator for some of its biological effects. Thioredoxin (Trx)1 is a small and ubiquitously expressed protein originally identified inEscherichia coli and is evolutionarily conserved from prokaryotes to higher eukaryotes (1Laurent T.C. Moore E.C. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 3436-3444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13963-13966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Trx is characterized by two cysteine residues within the conserved active site sequence, CGPC, and many Trx-like proteins are members of the Trx superfamily (4Nakamura H. Yodoi J. Curr. Trends Immunol. 1998; 1: 133-140Google Scholar). Trx shows various functions via reversible oxidation and reduction of these two cysteine residues. Oxidized Trx (Trx-S2) in which the two cysteine residues form an intramolecular disulfide bond is reduced by thioredoxin reductase and NADPH (2Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reduced Trx (Trx-(SH)2) contains two thiol groups and can catalyze the reduction of disulfide bonds in multiple substrate proteins (2Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13963-13966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Trx is involved in many thiol-dependent cellular processes, including gene expression, signal transduction, and proliferation. Trx functions as a hydrogen donor for ribonucleotide reductase, an essential enzyme providing deoxyribonucleotides for DNA synthesis (2Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Trx also modulates the DNA binding activity of transcription factors such as AP-1, nuclear factor-κB, glucocorticoid receptor, and estrogen receptor (5Hirota K. Matsui M. Iwata S. Nishiyama A.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4035-4040Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Trx has also been discovered as an adult T-cell leukemia-derived factor produced by human T-cell leukemia virus-I-transformed T-cells, or as interleukin-1-like factor produced by Epstein-Barr virus-transformed cells (9Tagaya Y. Maeda Y. Mitsui A. Kondo N. Matsui H. Hamuro J. Brown N. Arai K. Yokota T. Wakasugi H. Yodoi J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 757-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 10Wollman E.E. d'Auriol L.

In these cases, Trx was found to be involved in cell activation and growth promotion (11Wakasugi N. Tagaya Y. Wakasugi H. Mitsui A. Maeda M. Yodoi J. Tursz T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8282-8286Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 12Oblong J.E. Berggren M. Gasdaska P.Y. Powis G. J. Biol.

Recently, several mammalian proteins of the Trx superfamily have been reported, which include Trx2 (14Spyrou G. Enmark E. Miranda-Vizuete A. Gustafsson J-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2936-2941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), nucleoredoxin (15Kurooka H. Kato K. Minoguchi S. Takahashi Y. Ikeda J. Habu S. Osawa N. Buchberg A.M. Moriwaki K. Shisa H. Honjo T. Genomics. 1997; 39: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and TRP32 (16Lee K.-K. Murakawa M. Takahashi S. Tsubuki S. Kawashima S. Sakamaki K. Yonehara S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19160-19166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The active site sequences of Trx2 and TRP32 (CGPC) are identical to that of Trx. Trx2 and TRP32 are localized in the mitochondria and the cytoplasm, respectively. Nucleoredoxin is a nuclear protein with a modified active site sequence, CPPC. These proteins seem to be involved in the various redox regulations, but the precise biological functions are not well understood. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is well characterized as an organelle in which secretory proteins are folded and processed before export from the cell (17Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3575) Google Scholar). The ER also functions as a mobilizable calcium store that sequesters excess cytosolic calcium and acts as a reservoir for calcium signaling (18Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. Volpe P. Meldolesi J. Physiol. Rev. 1994; 74: 595-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The ER undergoes stress responses when secretory proteins are misfolded or calcium balance is perturbed. Although severe stress in the ER can result in apoptosis through ER-specific caspase-12 (19Nakagawa T. Zhu H Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2926) Google Scholar), the ER stands against relatively mild stresses by the unfolded protein response (20Sidrauski C. Chapman R. Walter P. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 245-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), suppression of translation (21Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Ron D. Nature. 1999; 397: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (2478) Google Scholar), induction of Golgi-ER backward transport (22Hammond C. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), and activation of the accumulating protein transport to proteasome (23Kopito R.R. Cell. 1997; 88: 427-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar,24Zhou M. Schekman R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 925-934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). These quality control mechanisms in ER have been extensively studied, and many ER-associated proteins involved in such processes have been identified. Among them, protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), a member of the Trx superfamily, is well characterized as a foldase that assists disulfide bond formation (25Freedman R.B. Hirst T.R. Tuite M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 331-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 26Noiva R. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3553-3556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we have characterized a novel protein, TMX, encoded by a gene previously isolated as a transforming growth factor (TGF)-β-responsive gene (27Akiyama N. Matsuo Y. Sai H. Noda M. Kizaka-Kondoh S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3266-3273Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). TMX possesses one Trx-like domain with a unique potential active site sequence, CPAC, and bacterially expressed TMX indeed show Trx-like reducing activity in vitro. The sequence analysis also suggested that TMX has an N-terminal signal sequence and a transmembrane domain. A tagged TMX was predominantly localized in the ER and overexpression of TMX significantly reduced the ER stress induced by brefeldin A (BFA), an inhibitor of ER-Golgi transport. These data suggest that TMX is a novel member of the Trx family and may function to help relieve ER stresses. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have characterized a novel Trx-related protein encoded by a gene identified as one of the TGF-β-responsive genes isolated by a retrovirus-mediated gene trap screening (27Akiyama N. Matsuo Y. Sai H. Noda M. Kizaka-Kondoh S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3266-3273Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This gene is widely expressed in normal human tissues (Fig. 3). Because the product of this gene contains one redox active site, a signal sequence, and a transmembrane domain, we named it transmembrane Trx-related protein (TMX). When TMX was tagged with FLAG epitope at its N terminus, the product was rarely detectable with anti-FLAG antibody (data not shown), supporting the prediction that the N terminus may serve as a signal peptide.The TMX cDNA was found to largely overlap with the human hypothetical cDNA clone DKFZp564E1962 whose sequence was previously deposited in the databases (GenBankTM/EBI accession no.AL080080). The 5′ region of this cDNA clone extends up to the 23rd nucleotide upstream of the translation initiation codon, and this segment lacks an inframe stop codon, which we found at 81 bases upstream of the initiation codon (Fig. 1). When homology protein searches were performed against databases of other species, two conceptual translation products in C. elegans andDrosophila were found with high identity scores. They share an identical active site sequence and structural similarity with TMX even outside of the Trx-like domain (Fig. 2 B). The strong sequence conservation in these distantly related species suggests the possibility that they compose a novel Trx family.Although the potential active site sequence of TMX, CPAC, has not been found in any other mammalian proteins with a Trx-domain, the sequence has Trx-like reducing activity when detected by the insulin disulfide reducing assay (Fig. 5), a classical spectrophotometric assay detecting the reduction of the two interchain disulfide bonds of insulin (31Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9627-9632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Replacement of two cysteine residues in the redox active site to serines resulted in a complete loss of the reductase activity of TMX protein. These results suggest the potential function of TMX as an oxidoreductase with the novel active site sequence.The TMX amino acid sequence predicts that TMX may be a type I membrane protein; the Trx-like domain in the N-terminal half protrudes on the luminal side of the ER. Sequence analysis of TMX revealed no known motifs for subcellular localization. Analysis with the Myc-tagged protein revealed that TMX is probably localized primarily in the ER (Fig. 4 B), where another protein family with Trx-like domains, PDI, also exists. PDI contains two Trx-like domains and catalyzes the disulfide bond formation (25Freedman R.B. Hirst T.R. Tuite M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 331-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 26Noiva R. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3553-3556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The retention of some proteins in the ER is known to depend on the presence of the C-terminal sorting signals such as KDEL (39Munro S. Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1987; 48: 899-907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar) and the double lysine motif (KKXX or KXKXX) (40Jackson M.R. Nilsson T. Peterson P.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3153-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). There is a KDEL motif at the C terminus of PDI, and it resides in the lumen of the ER (26Noiva R. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3553-3556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is no such ER-retention motif at the C terminus of TMX, and the localization pattern of overexpressed protein did not change when the Myc epitope was inserted immediate to the C-terminal site of the predicted signal sequence (SS) cleavage site (SS-Myc·TMX, data not shown), suggesting that the ER retention mechanism for TMX is independent of the C-terminal sequence.The cell fractionation experiments suggest that a low level of TMX·Myc was expressed on the plasma membrane (Fig. 4 A). However, when the staining patterns of TMX·Myc or SS-Myc·TMX was compared with that of GPI-anchored EGFP, overlapped staining on the plasma membrane was not obvious (Fig. 4 B and data not shown). Therefore it has remained unclear whether some TMX protein can be localized on the plasma membrane. Because we could not exclude the possibility that the tagging of the Myc epitope might lead to the mislocalization of the protein, the localization of endogenous protein should be elucidated by using specific antibodies against TMX itself.The accumulation of unfolded or abnormal proteins and the disruption of ER calcium homeostasis give rise to ER stress, and excess or prolonged stress results in apoptosis (41Welihinda A.A. Tirasophon W. Kaufman R.J. Gene Expr. 1999; 7: 293-300PubMed Google Scholar). BFA is an effective ER stress inducer and was shown to induce apoptotic cell death in several human tumor cell lines (42Shao R-G. Shimizu T. Pommier Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 227: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 43Guo H. Tittle T.V. Allen H. Maziarz R.T. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 245: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). BFA, a small fungal metabolite, has been shown to alter the function of the Golgi and trans-Golgi network, disrupt the traffic between endosomes and lysosomes, and inhibit protein secretion and synthesis because of impairment of vesicular transport (44Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1537) Google Scholar, 45Chardin P. McCormick F. Cell. 1999; 97: 153-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar).

Alternatively, TMX may modify certain proteins with its oxidoreductase activity thereby suppressing ER stress-induced cell death.Our previous results indicated that the level of TMXmRNA was increased by about 2-fold after TGF-β treatment (27Akiyama N. Matsuo Y. Sai H. Noda M. Kizaka-Kondoh S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3266-3273Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The functional relationship between TGF-β and TMX is presently unclear. RNA blot analysis revealed that BFA treatment (0.2 μg/ml) for 24 h did not increase the level of TMX mRNA (data not shown), indicating that ER stress itself does not influenceTMX expression. No alteration was observed in the interaction between Smad3 and Smad4 or in the expression of these proteins in the HEK293 cells coexpressing TMX and Smad3 and/or Smad4 (data not shown), suggesting that TMX may not have direct effects on the TGF-β signal transduction pathway. Further study is needed to test the interesting possibility that TMX serves as an essential target for TGF-β signaling and mediator for some of its biological effects.

Alternatively, TMX may modify certain proteins with its oxidoreductase activity thereby suppressing ER stress-induced cell death. Our previous results indicated that the level of TMXmRNA was increased by about 2-fold after TGF-β treatment (27Akiyama N. Matsuo Y. Sai H. Noda M. Kizaka-Kondoh S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3266-3273Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The functional relationship between TGF-β and TMX is presently unclear. RNA blot analysis revealed that BFA treatment (0.2 μg/ml) for 24 h did not increase the level of TMX mRNA (data not shown), indicating that ER stress itself does not influenceTMX expression. No alteration was observed in the interaction between Smad3 and Smad4 or in the expression of these proteins in the HEK293 cells coexpressing TMX and Smad3 and/or Smad4 (data not shown), suggesting that TMX may not have direct effects on the TGF-β signal transduction pathway. Further study is needed to test the interesting possibility that TMX serves as an essential target for TGF-β signaling and mediator for some of its biological effects.

Neurofibrillary tangles are composed of paired helical filaments (PHF), a major component of which is the hyperphosphorylated tau. In this study we used NPC heterozygous and NPC homozygous mouse brains to investigate the molecular mechanism responsible for tauopathy in NPC. Immunoblot analysis using anti-tau antibodies (Tau-1, PHF-1, AT-180, and AT-100) revealed site-specific phosphorylation of tau at Ser-396 and Ser-404 in the brains of NPC homozygous mice. Mitogen-activated protein kinase, a potential serine kinase known to phosphorylate tau, was activated, whereas other serine kinases such as glycogen synthase kinase-3β and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 were inactive. Morphological examination demonstrated that a number of neurons, the perikarya of which strongly immunostained with PHF-1, exhibited polymorphorous cytoplasmic inclusion bodies and multi-concentric lamellar-like bodies. Importantly, the accumulation of intracellular cholesterol in NPC mouse brains was determined to be a function of age. From these results we conclude that abnormal cholesterol metabolism due to the genetic mutation in NPC1may be responsible for activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase-signaling pathway and site-specific phosphorylation of tauin vivo, leading to tauopathy in NPC.

The most prominent cellular feature of NPC is the accumulation of low density lipoprotein-derived cholesterol due to a defect in the sorting/trafficking of cholesterol from lysosomes and late endosomes (1Pentchev P.G. Vanier M.T. Suzuki K. Patterson M.C. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease.

Neuropathologic examination has revealed neuronal distension, swollen axons, and polymorphorous cytoplasmic bodies that react with the cholesterol binding reagent, filipin. Since low density lipoprotein-derived cholesterol is inaccessible to the brain and nervous system, the accumulation of cholesterol in neurons must be derived from an additional source. Recent studies using NPC fibroblasts have concluded that endogenously synthesized cholesterol can contribute to cholesterol accumulation as a result of the circulation of cholesterol between the plasma membrane and endosomal/lysosomal compartments (3Lange Y. Ye J. Rigney M. Steck T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17468-17475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The gene responsible for NPC, referred to as the Niemann-Pick C1 gene (NPC1), was mapped to a region of chromosome 18 in both human and mice and subsequently cloned (4Loftus S.K. Morris J.A. Carstea E.D. Gu J.Z. Cummings C. Brown A. Ellison J. Ohno K. Rosenfeld M.A. Tagle D.A. Pentchev P.G. Pavan W.J. Science. 1997; 277: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). Although the function of NPC1 remains undefined, studies demonstrate a crucial role for this protein in cholesterol metabolism (5Liscum L. Klansek J.J. Curr. Opin.

NPC mice share many of the pathophysiological abnormalities observed in patients with NPC (8Morris M.D. Bhuvaneswaran C. Shio H. Fower S. Am. J. Pathol. 1982; 108: 140-149PubMed Google Scholar), including the accumulation of cholesterol in tissues and neurodegeneration marked by decreased Purkinje cell numbers. Use of the murine model for NPC has provided important insights into the role of NPC1 in cholesterol metabolism (4Loftus S.K. Morris J.A. Carstea E.D. Gu J.Z. Cummings C. Brown A. Ellison J. Ohno K. Rosenfeld M.A. Tagle D.A. Pentchev P.G. Pavan W.J. Science. 1997; 277: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). In a previous study it was reported that NPC mice are asymptomatic at birth, with the earliest definitive symptoms of the disease apparent by 4–6 weeks of age and death ensuing by 10–15 weeks of age (8Morris M.D. Bhuvaneswaran C. Shio H. Fower S. Am. J. Pathol. 1982; 108: 140-149PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that the brains of NPC patients with neurodegeneration have neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) without amyloid deposits (9Auer I.A. Schmidt M.L. Lee V.M. Curry B. Suzuki K. Shin R.W.

Interestingly, the presence of NFTs, which are composed of paired helical filaments (PHF), is one of the diagnostic hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) (12Goedert M. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee M.-Y. Rosenberg R.N. Prusiner S.B. DiMauro S. BArchi R.L. The Molecular and Genetic Basis of Neurological Disease. 2nd Ed. Butterworth-Heinemann, Boston1996: 613-627Google Scholar). A major component of PHF is tau, which is a microtubule-associated protein (13Nukina N. Ihara Y. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1986; 99: 1541-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 14Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Quinlan M. Tung Y.C. Zaidi M.S. Wisniewski H.M. J. Biol.

Neuron. 1992; 8: 159-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). Although the phophorylation of tau in AD is the subject of intense investigation, the molecular mechanism responsible for this altered regulation remains to be defined. In this context, it is interesting to note that a perturbation in cholesterol metabolism and NFT formation without amyloid deposits coexist in the brains of NPC patients. This may indicate that a disturbance in cholesterol metabolism is responsible for tauopathy. We have recently demonstrated using cultured neurons that cholesterol deficiency results in axonal degeneration associated with microtubule depolymerization and hyperphosphorylation of tau (20Fan Q.W. Wei Y. Senda T. Yanagisawa K. Michikawa M. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is important to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying tau phosphorylation associated with perturbed cholesterol metabolism in NPC brains. Studies on the phosphorylation state of tau in the brains of NPC mice have not been performed. Evidence indicates that the defect in NPC1 function together with the perturbation of cholesterol metabolism may be an important tool for elucidating the pathways involved in the modulation of tau phosphorylation, NFT formation, and neurodegeneration. In this work, we have determined the phosphorylation state of tau in brains of BALB/c mice carrying the genetic mutation inNPC1. Our results demonstrate that tau is hyperphosphorylated at Ser-396 and Ser-404. The elevation of tau phosphorylation in NPC (−/−) mice was accompanied by activation of MAP kinase (MAPK). The activation of MAPK may result from decreased levels of cholesterol in cellular compartments due to defects in NPC1-mediated cholesterol trafficking. BALB/c mice carrying the genetic mutation for NPC1 were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, MA). These heterozygous mice were bred to acquire NPC (+/+), NPC (+/-), and NPC (−/−) mice used for the study. The genotypes of the mice were determined from genomic DNA isolated from tail-snip DNA using a polymerase chain reaction-based method and oligonucleotide primers described previously (4Loftus S.K. Morris J.A. Carstea E.D. Gu J.Z. Cummings C. Brown A. Ellison J. Ohno K. Rosenfeld M.A. Tagle D.A. Pentchev P.G. Pavan W.J. Science. 1997; 277: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). Mice used in this study ranged from 6 to 12 weeks of age. The monoclonal antibody Tau-1 was obtained from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). The monoclonal antibody PHF-1 was kindly provided by Dr. P. Davies (Albert Einstein College of Medicine). The monoclonal antibodies AT-100 and AT-180 were purchased from Innogenetics (Ghent, Belgium). The rabbit polyclonal anti-NPC1 antibody was generated by immunizing rabbits with a MAP-peptide conjugate and purified from serum using peptide-specific affinity chromatography as previously described (21Garver W.S. Heidenreich R.A. Erickson R.P. Thomas M.A. Wilson J.M. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-MAPK, rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-independent-MAPK, and monoclonal anti-phospho-GSK-3β antibody were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Rabbit anti-p35 antibody, which reacts with the p35 and p25 regulatory subunits of cyclin-dependent kinase 5, was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG were purchased from Vector (Burlingame, CA). Mouse tissues were homogenized in 10 volumes of Tris-saline (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl), containing protease inhibitors (Complete™) and phosphatase inhibitors (10 μm NaF and 1 mmorthovanadate) using a motor-driven Teflon homogenizer. The homogenates were centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were saved for biochemical analyses. Protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce). Aliquots of supernatant containing equal amounts of protein were subjected to sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for immunoblot analysis. Supernatants containing equal amounts of protein were heated to 95 °C for 10 min and clarified by centrifugation at 20,630 × g for 15 min. To each of these clarified heat-stable supernatants was added the same volume of saturated ammonium sulfate, and the mixtures were kept at 0 °C for 1 h. The 20,630 × g pellets were suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, and alkaline phosphatase treatment was performed essentially as described elsewhere (22Gu Y. Oyama F. Ihara Y. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 1235-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Proteins separated using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were electrophoretically transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Nonspecific binding was blocked with 5% fat-free milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20. The blots were then incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. For the detection of both monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were used in conjunction with SuperSignal chemiluminescence (Pierce) to obtain images saved on film. The concentration of cholesterol and phospholipid in samples were determined using enzymatic methods. Cholesterol was determined using a cholesterol determination kit, LTCII (Kyowa Medex, Tokyo), whereas phospholipid was determined using a phospholipid determination kit, PLB (Wako, Osaka, Japan). The brains isolated from NPC (+/+) and NPC (−/−) mice were fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin for histological analysis. The tissue sections were washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and stained with a filipin solution for 1 h at room temperature (RT) before washing and mounting for microscopy. The fixed cells were examined using a UV filter. For immunohistochemistry, the sections were washed in PBS, incubated with 5% normal goat serum in PBS for 1 h at RT, followed by incubation with primary antibody against PHF-1 (1:20 dilution) for 1 h at RT. The sections were then washed in PBS three times and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:5,000 dilution) or biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:200 dilution) for 1 h at RT. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled sections were washed in PBS and observed using a fluorescence microscope. Biotin labeled sections were washed in PBS five times and visualized with 3′,3′-diaminobenzidine chloride. The cerebellum of NPC (+/+) and NPC (−/−) mice were washed with PBS and fixed with 2.0% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.8% saccharose for 3 h. The cerebellum were washed in 0.1m cacodylate buffer containing 0.8% saccharose overnight at RT and then incubated with 1% osmium tetroxide in the same buffer for 3 h. After dehydration, the cells were embedded in epoxy resin. Ultrathin sections were doubly stained with 2% uranyl acetate for 10 min and with a lead-staining solution for 5 min and observed using a transmission electron microscope (JEOL JEM-1200EX). The expression of NPC1 in the cerebrums, cerebellums, and livers of NPC (+/+), NPC (+/−), and NPC (−/−) mice were determined using immunoblot analysis. Consistent with previous results (21Garver W.S. Heidenreich R.A. Erickson R.P. Thomas M.A. Wilson J.M. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), NPC1 was determined to be a 180-kDa protein in the livers of NPC (+/+) and NPC (+/−) mice (Fig. 1). NPC (+/−) livers expressed approximately half the amount of NPC1 that NPC (+/+) livers expressed, whereas NPC (−/−) livers expressed no detectable NPC1 due to a truncation mutation. The lower band seen in the livers was a nonspecific one, because it was also detected using preimmune serum (data not shown). In the cerebrums and cerebellums of NPC (+/+) and NPC (+/−) mice, NPC1 was determined to be a 165-kDa protein, whereas NPC1 was not present in samples from the NPC (−/−) mice (Fig. 1). As with the liver, NPC (+/−) cerebrums and cerebellums expressed approximately intermediate levels of NPC1. Immunoblot analysis of each sample using preimmune serum or anti-NPC1 in the presence of immunizing peptide resulted in the detection of no bands corresponding to the above molecular weights, indicating that these lower molecular weight bands represent NPC1. The amino acid sequence based on the cDNA of NPC1 predicts a molecular mass of 142 kDa. The difference in the apparent molecular mass, i.e. 165 kDa in the brain and 180 kDa in the liver, is likely due to altered glycosylation of NPC1 (23Higgins M.E. Davies J.P. Chen F.W. Ioannou Y.A. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1999; 68: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The concentrations of cholesterol in the cerebrum, cerebellum, and liver were not significantly different in 6-week-old NPC(+/+), NPC(+/−), and NPC(−/−) mice (Fig.2 a). However, by 10–12 weeks of age, NPC(−/−) mice had a significantly increased concentration of cholesterol in the cerebrum (2.5-fold) and cerebellum (2.8-fold) compared with NPC (+/+) mice. As reported previously, the liver of NPC (−/−) mice had an approximate 10-fold increase in the amount of cholesterol compared with NPC (+/+) mice (24Xie C. Turley S.D. Pentchev P.G. Dietschy J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E336-E344PubMed Google Scholar, 25Xie C. Turley S.D. Dietschy J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11992-11997Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 26Henderson L.P. Lin L. Prasad A. Paul C.A. Chang T.Y. Maue R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20179-20187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 b). Moreover, the concentration of phospholipids in the liver of 10–12 week old NPC (−/−) mice was 1.8-fold higher than those in NPC (+/−) and NPC (+/+) mice of the same age. The concentrations of phospholipids in the cerebrum and cerebellum were similar between the three genotypes. In direct support of the increased amount of cholesterol measured in 10–12-week-old NPC (−/−) mice, filipin staining demonstrated an accumulation of cholesterol in neurons, particularly in the Purkinje cells of a NPC (−/−) mouse (Fig.3 b, arrows), that was not observed in the neurons from a NPC (+/+) mouse (Fig.3 a, arrowheads). Moreover, an electron micrograph of cerebellum sections from a 12-week-old NPC (−/−) mouse shows polymorphorous cytoplasmic bodies, loosely packed multi-concentric lamellar-like structures in a Purkinje cell, and a smaller type of neuron (Fig. 3, c and d). These features are characteristic of the intracellular accumulations of cholesterol in the brains of patients with NPC (27Elfenbein I.B. Johns Hopkins Med. J. 1968; 123: 205-221PubMed Google Scholar). Several well characterized antibodies to tau were used to examine its presence in various tissues of mice from 10 to 12 weeks of age. The immunoblot analysis of tau using Tau-1 antibody, which recognizes dephosphorylated sites of tau at four closely located serine residues, Ser-195, Ser-198, Ser-199, and Ser-202 (28Szendrei G.I. Lee V.M. Otvos Jr., L. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 34: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), shows that tau in the cerebrum, cerebellum, and liver was found to have apparent molecular masses between 50 and 70 kDa (Fig.4 a). For samples derived from NPC (−/−) and NPC (+/−) mice, the main bands immunoreactive to Tau-1 appear to exhibit slower electrophoretic mobility than the bands for samples derived from NPC (+/+) mice. (Fig. 4, a andb). These bands of tau exhibiting slower mobility are known to be characteristic of phosphorylated tau. The increased level of tau phosphorylation in NPC (−/−) mice was marked in the cerebellum, which is the most commonly affected region in NPC brains. Thus, we focused on the cerebellum to examine the phosphorylation state of tau. The antibodies used were the site-specific phospho-dependent antibodies PHF1, AT-180, and AT-100, which recognize the phosphorylated tau epitopes Ser-396/Ser-404, Thr-231, and Ser-214/Thr-217, respectively. Only the upper migrating band representing tau was strongly reactive to PHF-1 when samples from the cerebellum of NPC (−/−) mice were analyzed. This was not observed when samples from the cerebella of NPC (+/−) and NPC (+/+) mice were analyzed (Fig.4 b), indicating that the Ser-396/Ser-404 sites were highly phosphorylated in NPC (−/−) mice. In contrast, the intensity of the band reactive to AT-100 and AT-180 was stronger for NPC (+/+) mice than for NPC (+/−) and NPC (−/−) mice. However, the mobility of the AT-100- and AT-180-reactive band for NPC (−/−) mice was reduced to that of the band for NPC (+/+) and NPC (+/−) mice (Fig.4 b). Alkaline phosphatase treatment, which induces protein dephosphorylation, revealed a detailed pattern of the tau isoforms with significant shifts in electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 4 c). After dephosphorylation, tau from the cerebellum was resolved into three major isoforms with apparent molecular masses of 62, 58, and 52 kDa (Fig. 4 c). These three isoforms were detected in samples derived from each genotype. Importantly, the heat-stable supernatant of samples from the cerebellum of NPC (−/−) and NPC (+/−) mice showed that the bands immunoreactive with Tau-1 exhibited a slower electrophoretic mobility than those from NPC (+/+) mice (Fig.4 c, open triangles). Immunohistochemical analysis using PHF-1 was performed to determine whether tau phosphorylation was also evident in brain slices. Some of the cerebellum granular neurons (Fig.5 a) and cerebrum cortical neurons (Fig. 5 c) in the brain slices of NPC (−/−) mice at 10 weeks of age were shown to be PHF-1 immunopositive, whereas those in the brain slice of NPC (+/+) mice were immunonegative (Fig.5 b), lending support to the results shown in Fig.4 b. We also performed electron microscopy to determine whether filaments with PHF exist in the neurons of the cerebrum and cerebellum. However, we could not detect PHF formation in these cells (data not shown). To determine the molecular basis for increased tau phosphorylation, the expression and the phosphorylation state of several well known tau-directed protein kinases, including MAPK, GSK-3β, and p25, were determined. Immunoblot analysis using the anti-phospho-MAPK antibody, which recognizes only an activated form of MAPK, revealed that brains from 12-week-old NPC (−/−) mice have an 11-fold increase in MAPK activity compared with the brains of 12-week-old NPC (+/−) and NPC (+/+) mice (Fig. 6 a). The overall level of MAPK was similar for each of the three genotypes (Fig.6 a). Immunoblot analysis using the anti-phospho-GSK-3β antibody showed no alteration in the amount of the active GSK-3β in the brains from the three genotypes (Fig. 6 a). Immunoblot analysis using the anti-p35 and p25 antibodies also showed no alteration in the conversion of p35 to p25 from the brains of the three genotypes (Fig. 6 a). Together, these results indicate that neither GSK-3β nor p25 are responsible for increased tau phosphorylation. In contrast, markedly increased levels of MAPK activity, in conjunction with increased phosphorylation of tau, suggest that the MAPK pathway may be responsible for tauopathy in NPC. Additionally, NPC(−/−) mice have increased MAPK activity in the cerebellum (3-fold) compared with NPC(+/+) and NPC(+/−) mice at 6 weeks of age (Fig. 6 b); however, cholesterol accumulation was not found (Fig. 2 a). The mechanism by which NPC1 deficiency, associated with altered cholesterol metabolism, contributes to tauopathy remains undefined. In the present study, we have shown for the first time that (i) the accumulation of intracellular cholesterol in NPC mouse brains was a function of age, (ii) the levels of tau phosphorylation at Ser-396/Ser-404 are markedly increased, (iii) the increase in tau phosphorylation is marked in the cerebellum, which is the most commonly affected region of the brain in NPC, and (iv) MAPK is activated in the brains of NPC (−/−) mice. Consistent with previous studies (1Pentchev P.G. Vanier M.T. Suzuki K. Patterson M.C. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease.

However, using both biochemical and morphological analysis of NPC(−/−) mice, we demonstrate that the concentration of cholesterol measured in the brains of NPC (−/−) mice 10–12 weeks of age were elevated, similar to other organs (24Xie C.

A. 1999; 96: 11992-11997Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). But a recent study suggests that NPC cells can accumulate cholesterol in the absence of low density lipoprotein, indicating that endogenously synthesized cholesterol and plasma membrane cholesterol can contribute to the accumulation of lysosomal cholesterol (3Lange Y. Ye J. Rigney M. Steck T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17468-17475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In any event, our results indicate that the accumulation of cholesterol is age-dependent. Cholesterol accumulation is detected in 10- to 12-week-old mice but not detected in 6-week-old (this study) or 7-week-old mice, as shown in other studies (24Xie C. Turley S.D. Pentchev P.G. Dietschy J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E336-E344PubMed Google Scholar). There are several possible mechanisms for the increased phosphorylation of tau at the PHF-1 epitope: (i) a decrease in the level of cholesterol at specific cellular compartments due to a defect in cholesterol trafficking, (ii) the accumulation of cholesterol and other lipids in the lysosomal/late endosomal compartment, or (iii) the direct result of a defect in NPC1 function. Based on the results of our study and those presented previously by other investigators, the evidence indicates that a decrease in the level of available cholesterol due to a defect in cholesterol trafficking is responsible for tau phosphorylation in the brains of NPC (−/−) mice. Previous studies show that, despite an accumulation of cellular cholesterol, the rate of cholesterol synthesis and the expression of low density lipoprotein receptors is not down-regulated (24Xie C. Turley S.D. Pentchev P.G. Dietschy J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E336-E344PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the esterification of excess cholesterol at the endoplasmic reticulum is delayed as a result of cholesterol not being able to gain access to pools responsible for maintaining intracellular cholesterol homeostasis (26Henderson L.P. Lin L. Prasad A. Paul C.A. Chang T.Y. Maue R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20179-20187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 29Pentchev P.G. Comly M.E. Kruth H.S. Vanier M.T. Wenger D.A. Patel S. Brady R.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8247-8251Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothsis, our results suggest that additional cellular compartments may be cholesterol-deficient and, therefore, directly responsible for inducing tau phosphorylation and microtubule depolymerization in the axons of cultured neurons (20Fan Q.W. Wei Y. Senda T. Yanagisawa K. Michikawa M. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Cholesterol depletion of plasma membrane caveolae have been shown to cause the activation of MAPK (30Furuchi T. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21099-21104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Consistent with these results, we have found that MAPK is activated in cholesterol-deficient neurons and that NPC fibroblasts have significantly decreased levels of caveolae cholesterol (data not shown). In the present study, we demonstrate that MAPK activity is elevated in the brains of NPC (−/−) mice not only at 10–12 weeks of age but also at 6 weeks of age, indicating that the activation of MAPK precedes the accumulation of cholesterol. Since tau is known to be a substrate for MAPK and that Ser-396/Ser-404, but not Ser-214, Thr-217, or Thr-231 sites, are phosphorylated by MAPK (31Goedert M. Cohen E.S. Jakes R. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1992; 312: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 32Morishima-Kawashima M. Hasegawa M. Takio K. Suzuki M. Yoshida H. Titani K. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 823-829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 33Billingsley M.L. Kincaid R.L. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 577-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), the assumption that MAPK is responsible for tau phosphorylation in NPC (−/−) brains would well explain our present results that tau was phosphorylated at Ser-396 and Ser-404 (demonstrated as PHF-1-immunopositive) and was not phosphorylated at Ser-214 and Thr-217 (demonstrated as AT-100-immunopositive) nor at Thr231 (demonstrated as AT-180-immunopositive). These results indicate that a decrease in the amount of cholesterol available at particular cellular compartments may be directly responsible for the stimulation of MAPK activity and the subsequent promotion of site-specific phosphorylation of tau in the brains of NPC (−/−) mice and NPC patients. The mechanisms underlying time discrepancy in the activation of MAPK and the elevation of tau phosphorylation, however, remain unclear. But there are several studies demonstrating the relationship between the kinetics of kinases and tau phosphorylation and/or NFT formation. It has been shown that activation of the MAPK cascade is most pronounced during early stages of AD (34Arendt T. Holzer M. Grossmann A. Zedlick D. Bruckner M.K. Neuroscience. 1995; 68: 5-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), suggesting that activation of MAPK may precede tauopathy found in AD. It has also been suggested that responsible kinases including MAPK work at different stages or varying durations in Alzheimer's disease (32Morishima-Kawashima M. Hasegawa M. Takio K. Suzuki M. Yoshida H. Titani K. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 823-829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). In addition, tau antigenicity and its behavior has been shown to be influenced by the sequential and convergent influences of multiple kinases (35Shea T.B. Cressman C.M. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1999; 19: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). These lines of evidence suggest that tau phosphorylation is modulated by a complex mechanism and only allows us to argue that activation of a given kinase may precede tau phosphorylation. However, direct evidence is indeed required to elucidate the precise kinetics by which responsible kinases, including MAPK and phosphatases, induce tau phosphorylation and contribute to NFT formation in vivo. The remaining question to be answered is why tau is site-specifically phosphorylated at Ser-396/Ser-404 sites in the brains of NPC (−/−) mice, whereas other sites, including Ser-214, Thr-217, and Thr-231 are relatively dephosphorylated compared with the brains of NPC (+/+) and NPC (+/−) mice. The molecular mechanism underlying this regulation remains unclear, and additional studies are necessary. Our finding suggests that MAPK, but neither GSK-3β nor cyclin-dependent kinase 5, modulates the phosphorylation of tau in a site-specific manner. Other proteins, including tau-directed kinases and phosphatases, may also be involved in the regulation of tau phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in the brains of NPC (−/−) mice. Consistent with alterations in the activity of specific kinases, our studies have shown that the expression of specific protein kinases and phosphorylated state of caveolin-1 and annexin II are increased in the livers of NPC (−/−) mice (36Garver W.S. Hossain G.S. Winscott M.M. Heidenreich R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1453: 193-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The association between cholesterol deficiency and the promotion of tau phosphorylation may provide clues to the pathogenesis of tauopathy in AD, because possession of the allele ε4 of apolipoprotein E, which is a key molecule regulating cholesterol metabolism in the central nervous system, has been found to be a strong risk factor for the development of AD (37Strittmatter W.J. Saunders A.M. Schmechel D. Pericak-Vance M. Enghild J. Salvesen G.S. Roses A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1977-1981Crossref PubMed Scopus (3709) Google Scholar, 38Saunders A.M.

Recently, we have demonstrated that oligomeric amyloid β-protein reduces the intracellular cholesterol content in neurons, 2J.-S. Gong, K. Yanagisawa, and M. Michikawa, unpublished results. which may result in tau phosphorylation (20Fan Q.W. Wei Y. Senda T. Yanagisawa K. Michikawa M. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings may suggest that cholesterol plays a critical role in the tauopathy of AD and NPC."
https://openalex.org/W1590825739,"Plant viruses encode movement proteins (MPs) to facilitate transport of their genomes from infected into neighboring healthy cells through plasmodesmata. Growing evidence suggests that specific phosphorylation events can regulate MP functions. The coat protein (CP) of potato virus A (PVA; genus Potyvirus) is a multifunctional protein involved both in virion assembly and virus movement. Labeling of PVA-infected tobacco leaves with [33P]orthophosphate demonstrated that PVA CP is phosphorylated in vivo. Competition assays established that PVA CP and the well characterized 30-kDa MP of tobacco mosaic virus (genus Tobamovirus) are phosphorylatedin vitro by the same Ser/Thr kinase activity from tobacco leaves. This activity exhibits a strong preference for Mn2+over Mg2+, can be inhibited by micromolar concentrations of Zn2+ and Cd2+, and is not Ca2+-dependent. Tryptic phosphopeptide mapping revealed that PVA CP was phosphorylated by this protein kinase activity on multiple sites. In contrast, PVA CP was not phosphorylated when packaged into virions, suggesting that the phosphorylation sites are located within the RNA binding domain and not exposed on the surface of the virion. Furthermore, two independent experimental approaches demonstrated that the RNA binding function of PVA CP is strongly inhibited by phosphorylation. From these findings, we suggest that protein phosphorylation represents a possible mechanism regulating formation and/or stability of viral ribonucleoproteins in planta.

From these findings, we suggest that protein phosphorylation represents a possible mechanism regulating formation and/or stability of viral ribonucleoproteins in planta. A delicate balance between protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation regulates the function of a vast variety of proteins in the cell. Recently, several lines of evidence have suggested that phosphorylation of plant virus-encoded movement proteins (MPs)1 by host plant protein kinases may be involved in the process of virus movement (1Kawakami S. Padgett H.S. Hosokawa D. Okada Y. Beachy R.N. Watanabe Y. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 6831-6840Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Karpova O.V. Rodionova N.P. Ivanov K.I. Kozlovsky S.V. Dorokhov Yu. L.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4875-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The functional role of MPs is to assist the spread of viral progeny from cell to cell and over long distances (reviewed in Refs. 4Carrington J.C. Kasschau K.D. Mahajan S.K. Schaad M.C. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1669-1681Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 5Lazarowitz S.G. Beachy R.N. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 535-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 6Santa Cruz S.

Planta. 2000; 210: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). There is evidence that the 30-kDa MP of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV; genusTobamovirus) is phosphorylated when expressed in insect cells from a baculovirus vector (8Atkins D. Roberts K. Hull R. Prehaud C. Bishop D.H.L. J. Gen. Virol. 1991; 72: 2831-2835Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), in TMV-infected protoplasts (9Watanabe Y. Ogawa T. Okada Y. FEBS Lett. 1992; 313: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar,10Haley A. Hunter T. Kilberstis P. Zimmern D. Plant J. 1995; 8: 715-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and in the cell wall-enriched fractions of transgenic plants expressing the wild-type MP and its mutants (3Waigmann E. Chen M.-H. Bachmaier R. Ghoshroy S. Citovsky V. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4875-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 11Citovsky V. McLean B.G. Zupan J. Zambryski P. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 904-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The 17-kDa MP of potato leafroll virus (genus Luteovirus) was shown to be phosphorylated in a reconstituted system containing bacterially expressed protein and membrane preparations from potato leaves (12Sokolova M. Prüfer D. Tacke E. Rohde W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In another report, phosphorylation of the 69-kDa MP of turnip yellow mosaic virus (genus Tymovirus) was demonstrated when the MP gene was expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus vector (13Seron K. Bernasconi L. Allet B. Haenni A.-L. Virology. 1996; 219: 274-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). It is not yet clear whether MP phosphorylation is essential for the general process of virus movement; however, there is growing evidence suggesting that phosphorylation can affect several MP functions. Originally, it was proposed that phosphorylation represents a mechanism for MP inactivation and sequestration in the cell walls of mature plants (11Citovsky V. McLean B.G. Zupan J. Zambryski P. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 904-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Proteolytic processing was found to be an alternative mechanism to phosphorylation for inactivation of TMV MP inArabidopsis thaliana (14Hughes R.K. Perbal M.-C. Maule A.J. Hull R. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1995; 8: 658-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Recently, new evidence has accumulated that suggests that phosphorylation of TMV MP may directly affect its function. Either phosphorylation or the presence of serine 37 in MP of tomato mosaic virus (genus Tobamovirus) was shown to be essential for the protein intracellular localization and stability and, therefore, required for the efficient spread of the virus (1Kawakami S. Padgett H.S. Hosokawa D. Okada Y. Beachy R.N. Watanabe Y. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 6831-6840Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results indicated that phosphorylation of MPs by cellular protein kinase(s) may represent an active process required by the plant viruses to execute their movement function. Second line of evidence in support of the possible involvement of MP phosphorylation in the cell-to-cell movement came from in vitro studies showing that the phosphorylation of TMV MP abolishes its ability to repress RNA translation (2Karpova O.V. Rodionova N.P. Ivanov K.I. Kozlovsky S.V. Dorokhov Yu. L. Atabekov J.G. Virology. 1999; 261: 20-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This finding suggested a possible mechanism for how MP phosphorylation may regulate the function of movement ribonucleoprotein intermediates in the course of their cell-to-cell translocation. According to this hypothesis, MP phosphorylation converts the translation-incompetent movement intermediates into the translation-ready state, thus allowing the virus to replicate in the newly infected cell. In another recent study (3Waigmann E. Chen M.-H. Bachmaier R. Ghoshroy S. Citovsky V. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4875-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), TMV MP mutant mimicking phosphorylation was reported to be deficient in plasmodesmal transport, suggesting that phosphorylation is involved in down-regulation of the MP activity. Although much is already known about the phosphorylation of MPs of tobamoviruses, data on the phosphorylation of potyvirus proteins involved in movement are completely missing. In contrast to tobamoviruses, potyviruses do not encode a particular dedicated movement protein, using instead several polyfunctional proteins to execute their movement function. These proteins, designated movement-related proteins (MRPs), include the coat protein (CP), the helper component protease (HC-Pro), the cylindrical inclusion protein (CIP), and the genome-linked protein (VPg) (reviewed in Ref. 15Revers F. Le Gall O. Candresse T. Maule A.J. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1999; 12: 367-376Crossref Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In this study, we report that two out of the four MRPs of potato virus A (PVA; genus Potyvirus), CP and VPg, are phosphorylated by protein kinases from Nicotiana tabacum. Our further results suggest that phosphorylation of both PVA CP and TMV MP involves the same Ser/Thr-specific plant protein kinase activity. Finally, we show that phosphorylation of PVA CP by this enzymatic activity affects its ability to bind RNA. This suggests a strategy for how the formation and/or stability of viral ribonucleoproteins is regulated in planta. PVA strain B11 was propagated in N. tabacum(cv. SR1) plants. To establish systemic infection, tobacco plants were mechanically inoculated by grinding PVA-infected leaves at 1 g per 4 ml of distilled water and rubbing the sap into the lower leaves using carborundum as an abrasive. PVA infection was monitored by immunoblotting with mouse anti-PVA antibody (Bioreba). The virus was purified using the method described in Ref. 16Hammond J. Lawson R.H. J. Virol. Methods. 1988; 20: 203-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, and the resulting virus preparations were dialyzed against 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. The coat protein was extracted from virus particles by guanidine HCl and LiCl methods as described in (17McDonald J.G. Bancroft J.B. J. Gen. Virol. 1977; 35: 251-263Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and dialyzed against the same HEPES buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl. Tobacco plants (N. tabacum cv. SR1) were grown under nonsterile conditions in controlled environmental chambers using soil mixed with vermiculite (1:2). All plants were cultivated under long day conditions with 16 h of light (at 23 °C) and 8 h of darkness (at 23 °C). Fully expanded leaves of 10 cm in length were harvested and used in standard phosphorylation assays. Leaf tissue was homogenized with pestle and mortar prechilled to 4 °C for 5 min in homogenization medium containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 0.25 msucrose. A protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added at concentrations recommended by the manufacturer to homogenization medium upon commencement of grinding. The ground extracts were filtered through one layer of Miracloth (Calbiochem) and used as a kinase source for in vitro assays. Generation of expression constructs was described in Refs. 18Merits A. Guo D. Saarma M. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 3123-3127Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar and 19Ivanov K.I. Ivanov P.A. Timofeeva E.K. Dorokhov Yu. L. Atabekov J.G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar. Briefly, the coding sequences of four PVA MRPs (CIP, CP, HC-Pro, and VPg) and TMV MP were isolated by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into pQE-30 or pQE-9 plasmid vectors (Qiagen), allowing isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible expression of N-terminal His6 fusion proteins. The purification scheme of bacterially expressed His6PVA MRPs and His6TMV MP was previously described (18Merits A. Guo D. Saarma M. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 3123-3127Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 19Ivanov K.I. Ivanov P.A. Timofeeva E.K. Dorokhov Yu. L. Atabekov J.G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In the current study, the same purification strategy was implemented with the following modifications. Bacterial cell pellets were resuspended in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.2 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% sucrose and then lysed in a French press cell (two cycles at 10,000 p.s.i.). Cell lysates were centrifuged (12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), and the pellets were solubilized in buffer A (6 m guanidine HCl, 0.1mNa2HPO4/NaH2PO4, 0.01m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). After incubation for 30 min at room temperature with agitation, the insoluble material was removed from the solution by centrifugation (12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C). The supernatant was applied to the column containing Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) and chromatographed. His-tagged proteins were eluted by step changes in pH. The obtained pure proteins were refolded by a rapid dialysis procedure, which was previously successfully applied to recover the RNA binding activity of PVA MRPs (18Merits A. Guo D. Saarma M. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 3123-3127Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and TMV MP (19Ivanov K.I. Ivanov P.A. Timofeeva E.K. Dorokhov Yu. L. Atabekov J.G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In vitro transcription reactions were performed as described in Ref. 18Merits A. Guo D. Saarma M. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 3123-3127Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar.32P-Labeled transcript corresponding to the 5′-untranslated region of PVA RNA (160 nucleotides in length, positive polarity) was generated using an in vitro transcription system (Riboprobe;Promega). Samples were solubilized at room temperature in 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (2% (w/v) SDS, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8), and loaded on 12.5% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The gel electrophoresis was performed as described in Ref. 20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar. Following electrophoresis, gels were stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, or polypeptides were electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P; Millipore Corp.). For Western analysis, membranes were blocked for 1 h in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA). Blots were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with affinity-purified rabbit anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) diluted 1:1000 in 1% (w/v) BSA. Alkaline phosphatase-coupled anti-rabbit IgG (diluted 1:5000) was used to reveal the presence of the primary antibodies. Prior to RNA binding or immunoblotting, amounts of protein were normalized by comparing band intensity on Amido Black- or Ponceau S-stained membranes. Radioactively labeled proteins or RNA-protein complexes were visualized by autoradiography with Eastman Kodak Co. BMR film or quantified by using a phosphor imager (Fuji) and Tina 2.09c software (Raytest). Source leaves of PVA-infected or mock-infected tobacco plants were cut in disks (1 cm in diameter) and incubated in 25 mm HEPES, pH 6.8, containing 1 mCi (0.5 mCi ml−1) of [33P]orthophosphate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; ≥3000 Ci/mmol) in the presence or absence of 1 μm staurosporine (Sigma). Vacuum was applied until the leaf discs darkened and the mixture was further incubated overnight at 22 °C. Following removal of the incubation solution, the leaf discs were thoroughly rinsed, dried on filter paper, and cut into smaller pieces. The resulting leaf fragments were homogenized in NET buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 1% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma), 0.02% NaN3, 100 units ml−1 of Trasylol (Bayer)) containing 1% SDS and immediately boiled for 15 min. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation and diluted (1:10) with NET buffer for immunoprecipitation. Presoaked protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added at 1% (w/v) to the diluted lysates and incubated for 1.5 h at 4 °C to remove Sepharose-binding proteins. Following centrifugation at 3200 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, sheep anti-PVA antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added to the supernatants and incubated overnight at 4 °C with agitation. The protein-antibody complexes were then allowed to interact with protein A-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C and centrifuged at 3200 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. After removal of supernatants, the pellets were washed five times with NET buffer, and the Sepharose-bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to Immobilon-P membranes. The membranes were probed with mouse anti-PVA IgG (Bioreba) as described above and autoradiographed. Phosphorylation was measured as the incorporation of radioactivity from [γ-33P]ATP into the purified substrate proteins. Redivue [γ-33P]ATP (≥2500 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Assays were performed at room temperature for 30 min with occasional swirling in a final volume of 15 μl containing 0.5 μm[γ-33P]ATP (∼10 μCi), 1 μg of substrate protein, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, in the presence or absence of divalent cations (Mg2+, Mn2+, Ca2+, Zn2+, and Cd2+ at the indicated concentrations). Unless stated, freshly prepared total plant protein extract (≤3 μg) was used as a kinase source. For Western analysis with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, the kinase assays were performed with 20 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP together with 50 μm unlabeled ATP. To study the effect of staurosporine on protein phosphorylation, the compound was added into the kinase assays at a final concentration of 1 μm. Reactions were terminated by adding 5 μl of 5× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, followed immediately by boiling for 5 min. The phosphorylated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described above. Protein dephosphorylation was analyzed as the loss of [33P]phosphate from labeled proteins following their separation by SDS-PAGE. Two types of enzymes were used in dephosphorylation assays: general shrimp alkaline phosphatase (SAP; 1 unit/μl; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and Ser/Thr-specific protein phosphatase-2A (PPTase-2A, 0.5 units/μl; Promega). Digestion of phosphoproteins with SAP was performed at 37 °C for 15 min in a final volume of 20 μl containing 1 μg of phosphorylated substrate protein, 3 units of SAP, 10 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Protein dephosphorylation with PPTase-2A was carried out by incubation of the 20-μl sample containing 1 μg of phosphorylated substrate protein, 0.5 units of PPTase-2A, 1 mm MnCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, for 20 min at 37 °C. Control reactions in the same buffer with 1 μmokadaic acid (Calbiochem) were performed. The dephosphorylation reactions were terminated by adding 5 μl of 5× SDS-PAGE sample buffer followed immediately by boiling for 5 min.

Virology. 1997; 237: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar with some modifications. Equal amounts (1 μg) of target protein were phosphorylated in vitro in the presence of 500 μm unlabeled ATP and 10 mm Mn2+as described above. The phosphoproteins were separated from unincorporated ATP by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes. The membranes were blocked for 1 h in RNA binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, 6 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 25 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 5% (w/v) nonfat milk powder. After three washes with RNA binding buffer, SDS was removed from the blotted proteins by guanidine HCl extraction. For this purpose, membranes were incubated for 10 min in RNA binding buffer with 6 m guanidine HCl. The proteins were further renatured by successive incubations of 10 min each in RNA binding buffer containing gradually decreasing concentrations of guanidine HCl (3, 1.5, 0.75, 0.38, 0.19, and 0 m). Protein refolding was completed by incubation of the membranes for 3 h or overnight in RNA binding buffer plus 0.1% Nonidet P-40. For RNA-protein complex formation, the membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 106 cpm/ml of 32P-labeled PVA 5′-untranslated region (+) transcript in the same buffer. The unbound RNA was removed from the membranes by several 10-min washes with RNA binding buffer containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and different concentrations of NaCl (100, 300, or 500 mm). The sufficient number of washes was determined by measuring the radioactivity of the discarded buffer. Finally, the membranes were dried, and the remaining radioactively labeled RNA-protein complexes were analyzed as described above. Prior to RNA-protein binding assays, in vitrophosphorylation of His6-tagged recombinant protein was carried out in the presence of 500 μm unlabeled ATP and 10 mm Mn2+ as described above. Phosphorylated protein was checked for degradation by SDS-PAGE, and control reactions were performed without the addition of plant protein extract. The 20-μl reaction mixtures containing 1 μg of phosphorylated or nonphosphorylated protein were incubated with Ni2+-NTA magnetic agarose beads (Qiagen) for 30 min at room temperature with occasional swirling. The particle-protein complexes were separated from unincorporated ATP and plant extract contaminants using a PickPen magnetic particle transfer device (Bio-Nobile, Turku, Finland). The beads were picked up from the solution, transferred to fresh tubes, and washed with 150 μl of RNA binding buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mmNaCl, 1 mg ml−1 BSA, 10% glycerol (v/v)). The procedure was repeated again, and the pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of RNA binding buffer. The beads were then incubated with 5 × 105 cpm of 32P-labeled PVA 5′-untranslated region (+) transcript for 20 min on ice with occasional gentle shaking. Two more washes with RNA binding buffer followed each time by particle transfer to fresh tubes were performed. This procedure removed the unbound RNA from the beads. Finally, the beads were resuspended in 50 μl of RNA binding buffer and the residual radiolabel was checked using a liquid scintillation counter. The total concentration of manganese ions required for 95% saturation of ATP in the assay (0.5 μm) was calculated using the Kd value taken from Ref.23Sun G. Budde R.J.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5659-5665Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar. The four MRPs of PVA (CIP, CP, HC-Pro, and VPg) and the MP of TMV were expressed inEscherichia coli as fusion proteins with N-terminal hexahistidine affinity tags and purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography. The Coomassie-stained gels presented in Fig.1 show that the purified protein preparations were free from any major contaminants. The purified PVA MRPs were further assayed for phosphorylation in a reconstituted system containing total plant protein extract and [γ-33P]ATP. The phosphorylation reaction mixtures were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and autoradiography. The 30-kDa MP of TMV was used as a positive control in all assays, since its phosphorylation by plant protein kinases is well characterized. Two negative controls were performed in each assay to verify that recombinant proteins do not themselves bind radiolabeled ATP and that bands on the autoradiogram do not correspond to cellular phosphoproteins. In these control experiments, either purified recombinant proteins or plant protein extracts were alone incubated in the presence of [γ-33P]ATP. As shown in Fig. 1, two MRPs of PVA, CP and VPg, were found to be phosphorylated by plant protein kinases in the reconstituted system, but the phosphorylation of two other proteins, CIP and HC-Pro, was not detected. Autoradiography did not reveal any labeled protein in the negative controls, confirming that bands identified in other lanes correspond to phosphorylated recombinant proteins. As expected, TMV MP was phosphorylated in all control reactions, showing that plant extracts used in the assays contained active protein kinases (Fig. 1, lanes 1). The VPg of PVA is covalently linked to the 5′-end of the viral genome, whereas the CP of PVA is involved in the noncovalent interactions with viral RNA in virions and putative movement intermediates. This apparent difference suggests distinct functions for these two proteins in the genome transport process, those of PVA CP more closely resembling the functions attributed to TMV MP. Therefore, the current study was aimed at comparison of the plant protein kinases involved in phosphorylation of PVA CP and TMV MP and evaluation of a possible effect exerted by phosphorylation on the RNA binding properties of PVA CP. A powerful approach to dissect the functional role of protein phosphorylation is to follow the change in the activity of the target protein after specific inhibition of its phosphorylation. Therefore, our next goal was to determine an effective strategy for interfering with the phosphorylation of viral MRPs. Staurosporine, which is a potent and broad spectrum inhibitor of protein kinases, was introduced at 1 μm concentration into kinase assays containing recombinant PVA CP and TMV MP, plant protein extracts, and [γ-33P]ATP. Fig.2A shows that staurosporine had an inhibitory effect on the phosphorylation of both studied proteins. This finding allowed us to use staurosporine in the subsequent experiments as an inhibitor of PVA CP phosphorylation. Our next goal was to verify that PVA CP is phosphorylated in PVA-infected tobacco leaves. For this purpose, a series of experiments in which pieces of PVA-infected leaves were incubated in [33P]orthophosphate were performed. After overnight incubation, virus-infected cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with goat anti-PVA antibodies. The resulting immunoprecipitates were analyzed on protein gel blots with mouse anti-PVA IgG, followed by autoradiography. To determine the phosphorylation status of in vivo synthesized PVA CP, the radioactively labeled spots were superimposed on the specific spots observed on protein gel blots. The 33P-labeled band with an electrophoretic mobility similar to that of PVA CP was observed only in immunoprecipitates of infected plants, demonstrating that it corresponds to a phosphorylated, virus-encoded protein (Fig.2B, lane 2). From these results, we concluded that PVA CP is phosphorylated in vivo. To further support this conclusion, we tested the effect of staurosporine on PVA CP phosphorylation in infected plants. In agreement with the results obtained in vitro, phosphorylation of PVA CP in vivo was also inhibited by 1 μm staurosporine (Fig.2B, lane 3). The substrate specificity of the plant protein kinases phosphorylating the viral MRPs was previously determined only for MPs of tobamoviruses. The phosphorylation sites within TMV MP and tomato mosaic virus MP were mapped to serine or threonine residues (1Kawakami S. Padgett H.S. Hosokawa D. Okada Y. Beachy R.N. Watanabe Y. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 6831-6840Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Haley A. Hunter T. Kilberstis P. Zimmern D. Plant J. 1995; 8: 715-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 11Citovsky V. McLean B.G. Zupan J. Zambryski P. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 904-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To identify the specificity of the enzyme(s) involved in phosphorylation of PVA CP, we employed a two-step approach. As a first step, we analyzed phosphorylated PVA CP (designated PVA pCP) by probing protein gel blots with polyclonal phosphotyrosine-specific antibodies. Phosphorylated TMV MP (TMV pMP), known to be modified at Ser/Thr, was used in these experiments as a negative control. To verify that the blotted proteins were indeed phosphorylated, we performed protein kinase assays with radiolabeled ATP. Thus, the bands identified by immunoblotting could be compared with the phosphorylation pattern. As shown in Fig. 3A(lanes 2 and 4), the phosphotyrosine-specific antibodies did not recognize any of the bands corresponding to phosphorylated PVA CP or TMV MP detected by autoradiography. At the same time, the antibodies specifically interacted with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins from the epidermal growth factor-stimulated A431 cell line lysate, which was used as a positive control (Fig. 3A, lane 5). Therefore, these data ruled out the possibility that the tyrosine residues of PVA CP are phosphorylated. To obtain further evidence that PVA CP is phosphorylated on Ser/Thr, we employed a second strategy based on enzymatic dephosphorylation of recombinant proteins. PVA CP was phosphorylated in vitro using radiolabeled ATP and then treated with nonspecific SAP or PPTase-2A. Nonspecific alkaline phosphatases are known to strip the bound phosphate from any phosphoester-containing compound including phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, or phosphotyrosine. On the other hand, PPTase-2A selectively hydrolyzes phosphoserine and phosphothreonine but does not remove phosphate from phosphotyrosine. By comparing the extent of radioactivity incorporated into PVA pCP before and after treatment with these two phosphatases, it was possible to estimate the phosphorylation state of target proteins. For this purpose, enzymatically dephosphorylated PVA CP was analyzed by gel electrophoresis, and incorporated label was visualized by autoradiography. One lane in each dephosphorylation assay contained phosphoprotein incubated with PPTase-2A in the presence of its potent inhibitor (1 μmokadaic acid). A separate assay was performed with TMV pMP, which"

In fact, the leptin-induced ablation of adipose tissues (5Chen G. Koyama K. Yuan X. Lee Y. Zhou Y.T. O'Doherty R. Newgard C.B. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14795-14799Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) suggests a process involving concomitant loss of adipose vasculature rather than enhanced angiogenesis. In the present study, we show that leptin induces Ang-2 in adipose tissue without a concomitant increase in VEGF or Ang-1. These findings suggest a specific and direct mechanism of leptin-induced loss of the adipose vasculature. Swiss 3T3-F442A murine pre-adipocytes (24Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1975; 5: 19-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar) were grown in DMEM with 10% calf serum. To induce differentiation into mature adipocytes, confluent cell cultures were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for 6 days. Recombinant mouse leptin was purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis). Polyclonal antibodies to human Ang-2 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). An in situ cell death detection kit, AP, was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Subcutaneous fat was removed from various strains of mice at the indicated times and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and paraffin sections were prepared. Apoptosis was determined in situ by a TUNEL assay on the paraffin sections using alkaline phosphatase and nuclei counted in five fields at ×200 (25Gavrieli Y. Sherman Y. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (9145) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained at low (0.5%) serum for 16 h and then treated with murine leptin (1 μg/ml) for different time periods. Total RNA was isolated either from adipose tissue or from cultured cells with the TRI reagent kit (Molecular Research Center Inc.). Aliquots (1.5 μg) were subjected to RNA blot analysis as described (26Novick D. Kim S.H. Fantuzzi G. Reznikov L.L. Dinarello C.A. Rubinstein M. Immunity. 1999; 10: 127-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Probes for RNA blot analysis were prepared by RT-PCR with total RNA and the following primers (GenBankTM accession numbers are in parentheses): muAng-2 mRNA (AF4326), nucleotides 637–657 and 1147–1167; muVEGF (M95200), nucleotides 385–406 and 962–980; muActin mRNA (J00691), nucleotides 1670–1691 and 2452–2431. Total RNA was isolated and reverse transcribed in 20-μl volumes using RNase H− reverse transcriptase (SuperScript II, Life Technologies, Inc.) with 1 μg (N)6 random primer (New England Biolabs). Aliquots (2 μl) of the reverse transcription products were used for quantitative PCR in the LightCyclerTM PCR and Detection System using the FastStart DNA Master SYBER Green I kit (both from Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described by the manufacturer. The following sense and antisense primers were used (GenBankTM accession numbers are in parentheses): muAng-2 (AF4326), nucleotides 484–502 and 1640–1620; huVEGF (M32977), nucleotides 358–379 and 962–980; mouse actin (M12866), nucleotides 244–263 and 973–954. To determine the effects of leptin on the expression of angiogenic and angiostatic factors in adult adipose tissue, we injected murine leptin (0.1–5 μg/g, intraperitoneal) at times 0 and 9 h into 8–10-week-old obese (C57Bl-ob/ob) female mice, lacking endogenous leptin production. A noticeable weight loss was observed after 48 h in mice receiving ≥2 × 1 μg/g leptin (average weight 62.7 ± 1.0 g versus 65.4 ± 0.5 g, n = 6). Total RNA was isolated from subcutaneous adipose tissues at 0, 24, and 48 h after the first leptin dose, and the levels of Ang-1, Ang-2, and VEGF mRNA were evaluated by RNA blotting. Ang-1 mRNA was below the limit of detection of this analysis both before and after leptin treatment (data not shown). A significant induction of Ang-2 was observed in the leptin-treated (5 μg/g) animals. In contrast, the level of VEGF mRNA was not increased after 24 h and was only slightly elevated at 48 h (Fig. 1 A). Tissue Ang-2 was analyzed by immunoblotting at 48 h post-leptin injection. No Ang-2 was detected by this method at time 0 or in tissues of mice injected with low dose (0.1 μg/g) leptin, whereas Ang-2 was induced in mice treated with 2–5 μg/g of leptin (Fig. 1 B). These results demonstrated that leptin treatment induced Ang-2 in adipose tissues of C57Bl-ob/ob mice in vivo. The lack of parallel induction of VEGF by leptin indicated that the overall effect of leptin treatment on the adipose vasculature was angiostatic and not angiogenic. It was previously reported that intracerebroventricular injection of leptin for 5 days induces significant apoptosis in rat adipose tissues (11Qian H. Azain M.J. Compton M.M. Hartzell D.L. Hausman G.J. Baile C.A. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 791-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). We found by TUNEL staining an extensive increase in the number of apoptotic nuclei as soon as 24 h after intraperitoneal injection of leptin with further increases at 48 h (Fig.2). Apoptotic nuclei were seen in particularly in endothelial cells, identified by their elongated shape and location around erythrocyte-containing microvessels (Fig.3).Figure 3Leptin induces apoptosis of endothelial cells. Higher magnification of adipose tissue from leptin-treated mice at 48 h (see Fig. 2 for details) revealed apoptotic nuclei of endothelial cells around blood microvessels (indicated by open arrowheads).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We then compared basal Ang-2 mRNA levels in wild-type mice,ob/ob mice, and C57Bl-db/db mice lacking the long-form leptin receptor (OB-Rb). Quantitative RT-PCR revealed that Ang-2 mRNA was expressed in the adipose tissue of all three mouse strains, indicating that leptin was not essential for Ang-2 expression (Fig. 4). However, basal Ang-2 mRNA was significantly lower in adipose tissues of ob/ob mice, suggesting that endogenous leptin plays an important role in inducing Ang-2 mRNA expression in adipose tissues. C57Bl-db/dbmice have a constitutively elevated level of endogenous leptin, and yet their adipose Ang-2 was significantly lower compared with that of wild-type mice. This result indicates that leptin induces Ang-2 by acting through OB-Rb (Fig. 4). Although OB-Rb is expressed abundantly in the hypothalamus, it is also expressed in some other cell types including adipocytes (4Lee G.H. Proenca R. Montez J.M. Carroll K.M. Darvishzadeh J.G. Lee J.I. Friedman J.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 632-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (2109) Google Scholar). Therefore, induction of Ang-2 by leptin may be regulated either centrally or locally. To test whether leptin can induce Ang-2 expression by acting directly on adipocytes, in vitro experiments were performed using 3T3-F442A cells. Upon transfer to medium containing fetal bovine serum, these cells differentiate into adipocytes (24Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1975; 5: 19-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar, 27Green H. Kehinde O. J. Cell. Physiol. 1979; 101: 169-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 28Mandrup S.

Leptin (1 μg/ml) induced Ang-2 mRNA expression in differentiated 3T3-F442A adipocytes but not in pre-adipocytes, as determined by RNA blot analysis (Fig. 5). This observation indicated that Ang-2 was induced by leptin in the adipose tissue in an autocrine manner. Several other cell lines were tested for Ang-2 induction by leptin. Although many of them expressed a low basal level of Ang-2, induction by leptin occurred only in adipocytes (data not shown). We then studied the effect of leptin on VEGF mRNA induction in cultured adipocytes. Basal levels of VEGF mRNA were detected in cultured pre-adipocytes, but expression was reduced following their differentiation into adipocytes. No induction of VEGF was observed in leptin-treated adipocytes in culture. In contrast, leptin induced VEGF mRNA expression in pre-adipocytes (Fig. 5). The kinetics and the precise levels of Ang-2 and VEGF mRNA induction in cultured adipocytes and pre-adipocytes were further measured by quantitative RT-PCR. Significant induction of Ang-2 mRNA was observed in adipocytes at 10 h, and expression was even higher at 24 h (Fig. 6). In contrast, no induction of VEGF mRNA was seen in leptin-treated adipocytes. The induction pattern was reversed in pre-adipocytes. Leptin-induced VEGF mRNA expression was significantly increased at 48 h, whereas no induction of Ang-2 was observed. The somewhat delayed kinetics of VEGF mRNA induction suggests an indirect effect of leptin on VEGF gene expression (Fig.7).Figure 7Quantitative RT-PCR of leptin-induced VEGF in cultured pre-adipocytes. Cultures of undifferentiated mouse 3T3-F442A cells were induced with leptin (1 μg/ml).

This role requires the concomitant adaptation of the adipose microvasculature. In this study, we investigated the possible role of leptin on adipose microvasculature. Adipose tissues consist of several cell types, including adipocytes and fibroblasts. Our studies with these isolated cell types showed that leptin is capable of inducing both Ang-2 and VEGF in vitro in a cell-specific manner (Figs. Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7). Indeed, induction of VEGF by leptin may account for its reported angiogenic activity in several model systems (22Sierra-Honigmann M.R. Nath A.K. Murakami C. Garcia-Cardena G. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Madge L.A. Schechner J.S. Schwabb M.B. Polverini P.J. Flores-Riveros J.R. Science. 1998; 281: 1683-1686Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar, 23Bouloumie A. Drexler H.C. Lafontan M. Busse R. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). However, in adipose tissues of ob/ob mice, leptin profoundly induced Ang-2 without a concomitant induction of VEGF, thereby providing a strong angiostatic rather than angiogenic signal in vivo(Fig. 1). Such a process may contribute to the ablation of all adipose tissues reported upon over-expression of leptin in rats (5Chen G. Koyama K. Yuan X. Lee Y. Zhou Y.T. O'Doherty R. Newgard C.B. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14795-14799Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Ablation of adipose tissue is mediated at least in part by leptin-induced apoptosis, as reported by Qian et al. (11Qian H. Azain M.J. Compton M.M. Hartzell D.L. Hausman G.J. Baile C.A. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 791-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Our data support this mechanism and further show that DNA nicking occurred mainly in the nuclei of endothelial cells (Fig. 3). Induction of Ang-2 by leptin in adipocytes and lack of VEGF may have triggered apoptosis in the endothelial cells. A similar role has been assigned to Ang-2 in the regression of ovarian follicles as well as tumor blood vessels (14Hanahan D. Science. 1997; 277: 48-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar, 20Goede V. Schmidt T. Kimmina S. Kozian D. Augustin H.G. Lab. Investig. 1998; 78: 1385-1394PubMed Google Scholar, 29Holash J.

The strong induction of Ang-2 by leptin in adipose tissues and in cultured adipocytes adds these cells to the rather limited number of normal adult cell types that express Ang-2. Leptin appears to be a very potent inducer of Ang-2 as compared with the previously reported agents, VEGF, bFGF, hypoxia, and tumor necrosis factor-α (19Mandriota S.J. Pepper M.S. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 852-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar,30Oh H. Takagi H. Suzuma K. Otani A. Matsumura M. Honda Y. J. Biol.

Surprisingly, Ang-2 induction was not observed by this method (32Soukas A. Cohen P. Socci N.D. Friedman J.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 963-980PubMed Google Scholar). Our results, obtained both in vivo and in vitro, were reproduced by three independent methods. It is therefore possible that induction of certain genes may escape detection by the current DNA array techniques. Although this is the first report of Ang-2 expression in adipocytes, high level expression of VEGF was found in omental adipocytes (33Zhang Q.X. Magovern C.J. Mack C.A. Budenbender K.T. Ko W. Rosengart T.K. J. Surg. Res. 1997; 67: 147-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), providing a rationale for its well established use in surgery to accelerate wound healing (34Silverman K.J. Lund D.P.

We measured rather low basal VEGF mRNA levels in subcutaneous adipose tissues, suggesting that adipose tissues may differ in their VEGF content. It is also possible, however, that reduced oxygenation induces the grafted omental fat to secrete elevated levels of VEGF. In addition to its central effects, several peripheral effects of leptin were reported, but their mechanisms have not all been elucidated (10Wang M.Y. Lee Y. Unger R.H. J. Biol.

Induction of Ang-2 by leptin in cultured adipocytes provides convincing evidence that leptin also acts directly on peripheral targets. Such autocrine induction provides a novel regulatory pathway, linking leptin to vascular homeostasis in adipose tissue. We thank S. Barak for excellent technical help."
https://openalex.org/W1974477141,"The p53 tumor suppressor is a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein that activates transcription in response to DNA damage to promote cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. The p53 protein functions in a tetrameric form in vivo and contains four domains including an N-terminal transcriptional activation domain, a C-terminal regulatory domain, a tetramerization domain, and a central core DNA-binding domain that is the site of the majority of tumor-derived mutations. Here we report the 2.7-Å crystal structure of the mouse p53 core domain. Like the human p53 core domain in complex with DNA, the mouse p53 core domain adopts an immunoglobulin-like β sandwich architecture with a series of loops and short helices at opposite ends of the β sandwich. Comparison of the DNA-bound and DNA-free p53 core domains reveals that while the central β sandwich architecture remains largely unchanged, a loop region important for DNA binding undergoes significant rearrangement. Although this loop region mediates major groove DNA contacts in the DNA-bound structure, it adopts a conformation that is incompatible with DNA binding in the DNA-free structure. Interestingly, crystals of the DNA-free core domain contain a noncrystallographic trimer with three nearly identical subunit-subunit (dimer) contacts. These dimer contacts align the p53 core domains in a way that is incompatible with simultaneous DNA binding by both protomers of the dimer. Surprisingly, similar dimer contacts are observed in crystals of the human p53 core domain with DNA in which only one of the three p53 protomers in the asymmetric unit cell is specifically bound to DNA.

We propose that the p53 core domain dimer that is seen in the crystals described here represents a physiologically relevant inactive form of p53 that must undergo structural rearrangement for sequence-specific DNA binding. The p53 tumor suppressor protein functions as a checkpoint during the G1/S cell cycle transition, responding to DNA damage by activating transcription of genes that encode proteins inducing cell cycle arrest or apoptosis (1Prives C. Hall P. J. Pathol. 1999; 187: 112-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar, 2Burns T.F. El-Deiry W.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 181: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Disruption of the G1/S cell cycle transition and mutation of the p53 protein in particular occur in a variety of cancer types and correlate with the majority of human cancers (3Levine A.J.

Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (2130) Google Scholar).The transcriptional activity of p53 is mediated by a tetrameric form of the protein that binds DNA in a sequence-specific fashion to activate the transcription of target genes (5El-Deiry W.S.

Each p53 subunit contains four functionally distinct domains: a loosely folded N-terminal transcriptional activation domain (residues 1–44), a central core (residues 102–292) containing a DNA-binding domain, a tetramerization region (residues 320–356), and a regulatory domain (residues 356–393) (4Cho Y. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (2130) Google Scholar, 9Pavletich N.P. Chambers K.A. Pabo C.O.

Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2575-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). There are over 100 naturally occurring p53 DNA target sequences, and the human genome has been estimated to contain about 200–300 of such sites (11Tokino T. Thiagalingam S. Eldeiry W.S. Waldman T. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 1537-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Although the sequences of these p53 DNA target sites show variability, they all contain two head to tail decamers each containing a pentameric inverted repeat. Most decamers contain the consensus sequence PuPuPuC(A/t)↓(T/a)GPyPyPy, where Pu and Py are purines and pyrimidines, respectively (12El-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1736) Google Scholar). Although the various domains of the p53 protein can function autonomously, in vivo activity requires the intact protein. In addition, various lines of evidence suggest that the intact protein exists in two conformational states, one that has low affinity for DNA (T state) and another that has a high affinity for DNA (R state) (6Halazonetis T.D. Kandil A.N. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5057-5064Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Waterman J.L.F. Shenk J.L. Halazonetis T.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 512-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar).Significant insights into the tetramerization and DNA binding properties of p53 are revealed by the structures of the isolated tetramerization domain (14Clore G.M.

Biol. 1994; 1: 877-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and of the human p53 core domain bound as a monomer to DNA (4Cho Y. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (2130) Google Scholar), respectively. The structure of the tetramerization domain reveals a dimer of dimers. The structure of the p53 core domain bound to DNA reveals the details of monomer binding to a pentameric DNA sequence. These findings were used to rationalize the functional consequence of the majority of tumor-derived p53 mutations by showing that they map to regions of the core domain that would either affect the stability of the core domain itself or destabilize protein-DNA contacts. Despite the insights that are gained from the structural analysis of p53, several questions underlying p53 structure/function still remain. Among these questions is the issue of the nature of the structural rearrangements that p53 undergoes upon DNA binding.We report here the crystal structure of the mouse p53 core domain in the absence of DNA. A comparison with the crystal structure of the human p53 core domain bound as a monomer to DNA reveals that the overall structure of the core domain remains largely unperturbed upon DNA binding except for a pronounced movement of a loop region. This loop region adopts a conformation that is incompatible with DNA binding in the DNA-free structure but adopts a conformation that facilitates major groove DNA contacts in the DNA-bound structure. Moreover, the crystals analyzed here, reveal a noncrystallographic trimer with three nearly identical subunit-subunit (dimer) contacts. These dimer contacts align the p53 core domains in a way that is incompatible with simultaneous DNA binding by both protomers of the dimer. Interestingly, similar dimer contacts are observed in crystals of the human p53 core domain with DNA in which only one of three p53 protomers in the asymmetric unit cell is specifically bound to DNA. We discuss the implications of these findings for DNA-induced structural rearrangements of the p53 core domain in the context of the intact p53 tetramer.MATERIALS AND METHODSPurification and Crystallization of the Mouse p53 Core DomainThe DNA sequence encoding the mouse p53 core domain (residues 92–292) was amplified from the plasmid p11-4 (obtained from A. Levine, Princeton University) by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into the pRSET (Invitrogen) bacterial expression vector. The plasmid was transformed into the Escherichia coliBL21/DE-3 strain. Cells were initially grown in LB medium at 37 °C. When cultures reached an absorbance at 595 nm of ∼0.4–0.6, cells were induced by the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (supplemented with 100 μm zinc acetate) and grown overnight at 15 °C. The cells were isolated by centrifugation and resuspended in low salt buffer A (20 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.1, 100 mm NaCl, 10 μm Zn2+, and 10 mm dithiothreitol). The cells were sonicated, and cellular debris was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant containing soluble mouse p53 core domain was loaded onto a SP-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) ion exchange column, which was washed with 20× column volumes of buffer A, and the protein was eluted with a 0.1–1.0 m NaCl gradient. Peak fractions containing p53 core domain were pooled and concentrated using a Centriprep-10 (Amicon) and further purified by gel filtration chromatography using a Superdex-75 column. Peak fractions were judged to be greater than 97% homogeneous by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis, concentrated to ∼40–55 mg/ml, and stored at −80 °C until further use.Crystallization attempts were initially directed at obtaining a complex of the p53 core domain bound as a tetramer to a 24-base-paired DNA duplex containing four pentameric DNA binding sites. To this end, 10 mg/ml protein was mixed with a 0.25 molar equivalent of DNA duplex and screened for crystallization against a crystallization screen for protein-DNA complexes using the hanging drop method. The best crystals were obtained against a reservoir containing 8% polyethylene glycol 4000, 200 mm KCl, 50 mmMgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and grew to a typical size of 0.2 × 0.4 × 0.4 mm. Subsequent washing of large well formed crystals followed by crystal dissolution and analysis on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver staining revealed that these crystals contained the p53 core domain but no DNA.Data Collection, Structure Determination, and RefinementCrystals of the mouse p53 core domain were flash-frozen in a cryoprotectant containing the reservoir solution supplemented with 25% polyethylene glycol 400, and diffraction data were collected at 120 K at the A1 station of Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source using a charged coupled device detector. Data were processed and scaled with MOLSFLM (17Leslie A.G.W. CCP4 and ESF-EACMB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. Darsbury Laboratory, Darsbury, U. K.1992Google Scholar). Crystals belong to the orthorhombic space group C2221 with three molecules in the asymmetric unit. The structure was solved by molecular replacement with the program AMoRe (18Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5027) Google Scholar) using diffraction data from 10 to 3.0 Å. The search model used in the calculation was molecule B of the human p53 core domain (accession number 1TSR). For the search model, residues that differed between the human and mouse p53 core domains were changed to alanine (except for residues 183 and prolines that were changed to glycines). Rotation and translation searches followed by rigid body refinement yielded an unambiguous solution for the three protomers in the asymmetric unit cell with anR-factor of 47.5% and a correlation value of 42.4%.The model was manually rebuilt against 2F o −F c, F o − F c, and F c − F o maps using the program O (19Jones T.A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1978; 11: 268-272Crossref Google Scholar). Rigid body refinement, least square minimization, and simulated annealing refinement with crystallography and NMR suite (20Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16930) Google Scholar) using noncrystallographic symmetry restraints between the three protomers in the asymmetric unit cell were carried out at a resolution range of 10–3.0 Å. When the data were extended to a 2.7-Å resolution, noncrystallographic symmetry restraints were gradually released, and several cycles of simulated annealing (21Brunger A.T. Krukowski A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1990; 46: 585-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar), torsion angle dynamic (22Rice L.M. Brunger A.T. Proteins. 1994; 19: 277-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), temperature factor refinement, and manual model building were carried out. During the final stages of refinement, a bulk solvent correction was applied to the data (23Jiang J.S. Brunger A.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 100-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), water molecules were included using the waterpick routine of crystallography and NMR suite, and three zinc ions were added. Some residues at the very N and C termini were not visible in the electron density map and were therefore not modeled. The final structure contained residues 99–284 of each protomer, had excellent stereochemistry, and had crystallographicR-factors of 23.9 and 29.9% for R-working andR-free, respectively, against data from 10 to 2.7 Å (see Table I and Fig. 1 B).Table IData collection and refinement statisticsSpace groupC2221Cell dimensions (Å)a = 73.68b = 119.99c = 184.24Resolution (Å)10–2.7No. of observations121009No. of unique reflections22733Completeness/last shell99.5/98.7%Multiplicity5.3I/ς(I)/last shell9.6/3.9R-merge1-aR-merge = ΣhΣl‖I h,i −I h‖/ΣhΣ I h,i whereI h is the mean intensity of symmetry-related reflections, I h,i./last shell0.051/0.189No. of reflections (F > 2ς(F)22252No. of protein atoms4381No. of zinc atoms3No. of water atoms108R-factor1-bR-factor = Σ∥F o‖ − ‖F c∥/Σ‖F o‖ whereF o and F c are the observed and calculated structure factor amplitudes, respectively.23.9R-free1-cR-free is calculated for the 10% of the data that was withheld from refinement.29.9Mean B value (Å)67.2r.m.s.d. bonds (Å)1-dr.m.s.d., root mean square deviation.0.007r.m.s.d. angles (°)1.32Dihedral angles (°)25.0Improper angles (°)0.891-a R-merge = ΣhΣl‖I h,i −I h‖/ΣhΣ I h,i whereI h is the mean intensity of symmetry-related reflections, I h,i.1-b R-factor = Σ∥F o‖ − ‖F c∥/Σ‖F o‖ whereF o and F c are the observed and calculated structure factor amplitudes, respectively.1-c R-free is calculated for the 10% of the data that was withheld from refinement.1-d r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. Open table in a new tab Sedimentation Equilibrium UltracentrifugationFor sedimentation equilibrium experiments, each cell was assembled with a double sector 12-mm centerpiece with sapphire windows. Blank scans with distilled water were taken before interference optics sedimentation equilibrium experiments at appropriate speeds to correct for window distortion of the fringe displacement data (24Yphantis D.A. Biochemistry. 1964; 3: 297-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (2018) Google Scholar). Cells were loaded with the mouse p53 core at two different starting concentrations (0.5 and 1.5 mg/ml) in a buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The experiment was performed at three separate centrifugation speeds of 22,900, 32,400, and 37,500 rpm. At each speed, fringe displacement scans were collected every 4 h until the protein samples reached equilibrium. Equilibrium was assessed by comparison of successive scans using the MATCH program, and data editing was performed using the REEDIT program (both programs were provided by National Analytical Ultracentrifugation Facility, Storrs, CT).After equilibrium was obtained, the NONLIN program (25Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar) was used to globally fit the final scans from the two different concentrations and all speeds (a total of six curves were analyzed simultaneously). NONLIN fits used an effective reduced molecular weight, ς = M(1 −v̄ρ)ω2/RT, in whichM is the molecular weight, v̄ is the partial specific volume, ρ is the solvent density, ω is the angular velocity (2π(rpm)/60), R is the gas constant, andT is the temperature in Kelvin. The partial specific volume of the mouse p53 core was calculated from the amino acid sequence, and the density of the solvent was calculated as described previously (26Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. The Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, U. K.1992: 90-125Google Scholar). For this model of weak self-association, ς was held at the correct value based on the known monomer molecular weight of the protein, and separate equilibrium constants for each scan were fitted as ln K. These values were converted to dissociation constants with the appropriate molar units. The fit quality for the model was determined by examination of residuals and by minimization of the fit variance. The root mean square deviation of the residuals for the multiple species model was 9.56 × 10−3.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONOverall Structure of the p53 Core DomainThe crystal structure presented here contains three molecules of the mouse p53 core domain in the asymmetric unit cell. The overall fold of the p53 core domain is very similar to that of the previously reported core domain in complex with DNA (4Cho Y. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (2130) Google Scholar) (Figs.1 A and 2 A). Briefly, the core domain forms a central region that adopts an immunoglobulin-like β sandwich architecture of two long twisted antiparallel β sheets of four (S1, S3, S8, and S5) and five (S10, S9, S4, S7, and S6) strands (Figs. 1 A and2 A). Located at opposite ends of the β sandwich are a series of loops. One of the two ends also contains two short helices (H1 and H2) and a tightly bound zinc atom that is tetrahedrally ligated by Cys-173 and His-176 from the L2 loop (between strands S4 and S5) and Cys-235 and Cys-239 from the L3 loop (between strands S8 and S9). The structure of the human p53 core domain bound to DNA shows that the H2 helix, the L3 loop, and the L1 loop (between strands S1 and S2) interact with DNA.Figure 2Overall structure of the mouse p53 core domain. A, schematic ribbon diagram of the p53 core domain. B, Cα superposition of the three p53 protomers in the asymmetric unit cell of the crystals.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A superposition of the three molecules in the asymmetric unit (Fig.2 B) gives root mean square deviation values of 0.40 Å (molecule A-molecule B), 0.57 Å (molecule C-molecule A), and 0.62 Å (molecule B-molecule C) for all main chain atoms. Structural deviations are largely restricted to the L1 loop (residues 115–121) along the DNA-binding side of the core domain and the loops between strands S3 and S4 (residues 220–223) and S7 and S8 (residues 149–151) opposite to the DNA-binding side of the molecule. Although the structural variability within the S3-S4 and S7-S8 loops appears to reflect inherent flexibility within this region of the core domain, as will be discussed below, the structural variability within the L1 loop appears to be due in part to the absence of bound DNA.Comparison with the Human p53 Core Domain in Complex with DNAThe core domains of human and mouse p53 are highly homologous in sequence with an overall identity of 89%. Therefore a comparison between the nascent mouse p53 core domain and the DNA-bound human p53 core domain can be used to examine the effect of core domain structure as a function of DNA binding. An overall comparison of the nascent (using monomer A) and the DNA-bound form of p53 shows a root mean square deviation between main chain atoms of 0.87 Å as compared with a value between 0.4 and 0.62 Å between noncrystallographically related subunits of the nascent structure (Fig.3 A). The larger structural differences that are observed when comparing the unbound and DNA-bound forms of p53 within two different crystal forms are consistent with a comparison between the p53 core domain in the absence of DNA with the DNA-free p53 subunit within the crystal lattice of the p53-DNA complex (Fig. 3 C). This comparison shows a root mean square deviation between main chain atoms of 0.57 Å. Taken together, DNA binding by the p53 core domain appears to illicit small yet significant structural changes.Figure 3Comparison of the DNA-free form of the mouse p53 core domain with the DNA-bound and DNA-free forms of the human p53 core domain. The DNA-free mouse p53 core domain is shown ingreen, and the human p53 core domain is shown inred. A, Cα superimposition of the DNA-free mouse p53 core domain with the DNA-bound form of the human p53 core domain. The DNA that is bound to the human p53 core domain is shown inblue. B, close-up view of the p53-DNA interface proximal to the L1 loop (A). The DNA-bound form of the human p53 core domain is shown in red, highlighting residues 116–119 of the L1 loop (mouse p53 numbering). The corresponding region of molecule A of the DNA-free mouse p53 core domain is shown ingray. The conformations of the Lys-117 side chain in the three mouse p53 core domains in the asymmetric unit cell are shown indark gray. C, Cα superimposition of the DNA-free mouse p53 core domain with the DNA-free form of the human p53 core domain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The structural changes between the DNA-bound and DNA-free core domains are primarily localized to four regions (Fig. 3 A). Near the DNA-binding surface structural differences are seen in the L1 loop and the C-terminal end of the H2 helix. Away from the DNA-binding surface structural differences are seen in the loop separating the S7 and S8 strands and the loop between the H1 helix and the S5 strand. Structural differences within the S7-S8 and H1-S5 loops appear to be a function of interactions between the p53 core domains in the crystals, as will be discussed below, whereas structural differences within the L1 loop appear to be a function of DNA binding.The L1 loop in the DNA-free form of the p53 core is further away from the H2 helix than it is in the DNA-bound form. In fact, a superposition of the DNA-free p53 core onto the core domain of the DNA complex suggests that the L1 loop would clash with the DNA and therefore suggests that the L1 loop would need to move closer to the H2 helix (as it is in the DNA-bound structure) to fit into the major groove of the DNA. Two interactions within the L1 loop appear to stabilize its DNA-bound form over the DNA-free form. Within the L1 loop, Lys-117 (Lys-120 in human p53) is disordered in all three core domains of the asymmetric unit cell (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, the DNA complex shows that Lys-120 makes contacts to the major groove of the DNA. The conformation of the L1 loop in the DNA bound form is also stabilized by a backbone H bond at the turn of the L1 loop between Ala-116 and Ser-118 (mouse p53 numbering), an interaction that is lost in the DNA-free form (Fig. 3 B). Taken together, the L1 loop region of the p53 core appears to undergo important structural rearrangement for DNA binding.Dimer Contacts between p53 Core Domains in the CrystalsThe most surprising finding from our crystal structure is that the mouse p53 core domain is packed in the crystals as a noncrystallographic trimer in which the subunits are held together by nearly identical dimer contacts. These dimer contacts are quite extensive and bury a total of ∼1458 Å2 at each interface, which amounts to ∼15% of the surface area of each protein subunit (Fig.4 A). These dimer contacts involve the H1-S5 loop of one subunit and the S4-H1 (L2) and S6-S7 loops of the other dimer subunit (Fig. 4 B). The interface is stabilized by both hydrogen bonds and Van der Waals interactions. Main chain hydrogen bonds are formed between residues 168 and 169 of the S4-H1 loop with residues 180 and 178 of the H1-S5 loop of the opposing subunit, respectively, and between residue 207 of the S6-S7 loop with residue 182 of the H1-S5 loop. Side chain hydrogen bonds are also formed in the dimer, and Arg-178 of the H1-S5 loop plays a particularly important role in this regard. The side chain of Arg-178 makes a direct hydrogen bond to the backbone OH of residue 172 of the S4-H1 loop of the opposing subunit and also makes water-mediated interactions to the side chains of Glu-168 and Tyr-160 of the same loop. Van der Waals interactions at the dimer interface involve interactions between Phe-209 of the S6-S7 loop with Ala-182 and Pro-188 of the H1-S5 loop and between Val-169 of the S4-H1 loop with the aliphatic regions of Arg-178 and Ser-180 of the H1-S5 loop.Figure 4Structure of the mouse p53 core domain dimer.

https://openalex.org/W1530146512,"We examined the role of glycosphingolipid- and cholesterol-enriched microdomains, or rafts, in the sorting of digestive enzymes into zymogen granules destined for apical secretion and in granule formation. Isolated membranes of zymogen granules from pancreatic acinar cells showed an enrichment in cholesterol and sphingomyelin and formed detergent-insoluble glycolipid-enriched complexes. These complexes floated to the lighter fractions of sucrose density gradients and contained the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored glycoprotein GP-2, the lectin ZG16p, and sulfated matrix proteoglycans. Morphological and pulse-chase studies with isolated pancreatic lobules revealed that after inhibition of GPI-anchor biosynthesis by mannosamine or the fungal metabolite YW 3548, granule formation was impaired leading to an accumulation of newly synthesized proteins in the Golgi apparatus and the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Furthermore, the membrane attachment of matrix proteoglycans was diminished. After cholesterol depletion or inhibition of glycosphingolipid synthesis by fumonisin B1, the formation of zymogen granules as well as the formation of detergent-insoluble complexes was reduced. In addition, cholesterol depletion led to constitutive secretion of newly synthesized proteins,e.g. amylase, indicating that zymogens were missorted. Together, these data provide first evidence that in polarized acinar cells of the exocrine pancreas GPI-anchored proteins, e.g.GP-2, and cholesterol-sphingolipid-enriched microdomains are required for granule formation as well as for regulated secretion of zymogens and may function as sorting platforms for secretory proteins destined for apical delivery.

In endocrine and exocrine cells secretory proteins are stored at high concentrations in secretory granules and are released in response to external stimuli. During the course of granule formation proteins destined for storage and regulated secretion are segregated from those constitutively secreted (1Tooze S.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 231-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 2Huttner W.B. Ohashi M. Kehlenbach R.H. Barr F.A. Bauerfeind R. Braunling O. Corbeil D. Hannah M. Pasolli H.A. Schmidt A.

Granule formation and apical sorting in pancreatic acinar cells involves the selective aggregation of a mixture of regulated secretory proteins and the association of these aggregates with specific membrane domains of the trans-Golgi network (TGN),1 which then pinch off as condensing vacuoles. While the selective aggregation of the pancreatic secretory proteins has been well documented (4Leblond F.A. Viau G. Laine J. Lebel D. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 5Freedman S.D. Scheele G.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 992-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 6Dartsch H. Kleene R. Kern H.F. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 75: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), how these aggregates become bound to the luminal side of the TGN membrane and are ultimately sorted into condensing vacuoles is poorly understood. The zymogen granule (ZG) glycoprotein GP-2, which is linked to the luminal surface via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor and represents up to 30% of the total membrane proteins within the ZG membrane, was the first candidate postulated to mediate this sorting event (7Scheele G.A. Fukuoka S. Freedman S.D. Pancreas. 1994; 9: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, two studies have demonstrated that during embryonic development and in partially differentiated acinar carcinoma cell lines, granule formation can occur in the complete absence of GP-2 (8Hansen L.J. Reddy M.K. Reddy J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4379-4383Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 9Dittie A. Kern H.F. Eur. J.

This argues against a role as specific sortase of GP-2, but does not exclude its involvement in granule formation and in apical sorting (7Scheele G.A. Fukuoka S. Freedman S.D. Pancreas. 1994; 9: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), at least in the adult exocrine pancreas. Scheele et al. (7Scheele G.A. Fukuoka S. Freedman S.D. Pancreas. 1994; 9: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) have put forward the hypothesis that GP-2, together with attached proteoglycans, forms a submembranous matrix at the luminal side of ZGM. We have recently identified and characterized proteoglycan and glycoprotein components of this matrix (11Schmidt K. Dartsch H. Linder D. Kern H. Kleene R. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2233-2242PubMed Google Scholar) and have evidence that it functions in the binding of aggregated enzyme proteins to membranes, a process that is considered as condensation-sorting (12Kleene R. Dartsch H. Kern H.F. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The acinar cells of the pancreas are highly polarized cells with regulated secretion directed to the apical domain surrounding the acinus lumen. From studies of polarized protein trafficking performed mainly with MDCK cells, it is known that protein sorting to the apical domain of the plasma membrane is controlled by N- and/orO-glycosylation of protein ectodomains (13Fiedler K. Simons K. Cell. 1995; 81: 309-312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 14Rodriguez-Boulan E. Gonzalez A. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 291-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), by apical sorting determinants present in the cytoplasmic tail of seven transmembrane proteins (15Chuang J.Z. Sung C.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 16Sun A.Q. Ananthanarayanan M. Soroka C.J. Thevananther S. Shneider B.L. Suchy F.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G1045-G1055PubMed Google Scholar), or by the incorporation of apically sorted proteins into lipid microdomains, called rafts, in the Golgi complex (17Harder T. Simons K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar, 18Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8050) Google Scholar). Inclusion into rafts and subsequent apical sorting has been shown for GPI-anchored proteins at the plasma membrane (17Harder T. Simons K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar) and for some transmembrane proteins (19Kundu A. Avalos R.T. Sanderson C.M. Nayak D.P. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6508-6515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Lin S. Naim H.Y. Rodriguez A.C. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Rafts are membrane microdomains enriched in glycosphingolipids, sphingomyelin, and cholesterol that are thought to be assembled within the exoplasmic leaflet of the Golgi membrane and that have been proposed to act as a sorting platform for the apical delivery of plasma membrane proteins (18Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8050) Google Scholar, 21Simons K. van Meer G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6197-6202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). Rafts are defined biochemically by their insolubility in non-ionic detergents such as Triton X-100 at 4 °C (22Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2604) Google Scholar). The detergent-insoluble glycosphingolipid complexes (DIGs) float to lighter fractions on sucrose density gradients and have been identified in TGN-derived apical transport vesicles (22Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2604) Google Scholar). Several apical cargo proteins, e.g. the influenza virus proteins hemagglutinin and neuraminidase (19Kundu A. Avalos R.T. Sanderson C.M. Nayak D.P. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6508-6515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Lin S. Naim H.Y. Rodriguez A.C. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), or GPI-anchored proteins (17Harder T. Simons K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar) are found in DIGs during their transport to the apical domain, while basolaterally delivered cargo proteins are excluded from DIGs (23Keller P. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1357-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Raft association of proteins is mediated either directly by the GPI moiety or by the transmembrane domains of proteins, e.g. the lectin VIP36, or indirectly by binding to other raft-associated proteins. It is not clear which of the above mechanisms exist in polarized acinar cells of the pancreas to sort the 15–20 different zymogens to the apical surface and what role the GPI-anchored GP-2 and lipid rafts play in this phenomenon. As lipid microdomains have been described in secretory granules of neuroendocrine cells (24Thiele C. Huttner W.B. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 9: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 25Dhanvantari S. Loh Y.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29887-29893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), we investigated whether they were also present in the membranes of zymogen granules of the exocrine pancreas. We obtained evidence that GP-2, the secretory lectin ZG16p, and sulfated proteoglycans were associated with cholesterol-glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomains isolated from membranes of zymogen granules. Furthermore, GP-2 and lipid microdomains were required for proper granule formation and regulated secretion of zymogens. Polyclonal antibodies to rat GP-2 and pig amylase were used as reported previously (9Dittie A. Kern H.F. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 58: 243-258PubMed Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibody ZG16 to recombinant rat ZG16p was described in Cronshagen et al. (26Cronshagen U. Voland P. Kern H.F. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 65: 366-377PubMed Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies to carboxyl ester lipase were raised in chicken. A polyclonal antibody to carboxypeptidase α was obtained from Rockland Immunochemicals (Gilbertsville, PA). Species-specific anti-IgG antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were obtained from Bio-Rad. ZG were isolated as described previously (6Dartsch H. Kleene R. Kern H.F. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 75: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, the pancreas was removed from fasted male Wistar rats (200–230 g; Charles River, Sulzfeld, Germany) and homogenized on ice in the following buffer: 0.25 m sucrose, 5 mmMES at pH 6.25, 0.1 mm MgSO4, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10 μm FOY-305 (Sanol Schwarz, Mannheim, Germany), 2.5 mm Trasylol (Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany), 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The homogenate was centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the resulting postnuclear supernatant was further centrifuged at 2000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to pellet the ZG. After removal of the brownish layer of mitochondria on top of the pellet, the ZG were lysed in 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, and stored at −20 °C. After thawing, the soluble zymogen granule content proteins were separated from the ZGM by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g for 30 min, 4 °C). ZGM were resuspended in 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, and stored at −20 °C. For bicarbonate treatment of ZGM, 500 μl of 300 mm NaHCO3, pH 11.5, were added to 500 μl of ZGM (corresponding to 200 μg of protein), and the mixture was incubated on ice for 2 h. For PI-PLC treatment of ZGM, 500 milliunits of PI-PLC (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) were added to ZGM (corresponding to 800 μg of protein), and the samples were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in a final volume of 500 μl. Treated membranes were reisolated by high-speed centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. For the preparation of Golgi- and rER-enriched fractions, the postnuclear supernatant was adjusted to 0.5 m sucrose, layered onto a step gradient of 1.4 and 0.9 m sucrose, and was overlaid with 0.25 m sucrose solution containing 10 mmHepes, pH 6.8, 5 mm MgCl2, and 3 mmCaCl2. After centrifugation for 1 h at 110,000 ×g, a Golgi-enriched faction was obtained at the 0.5/0.9m interphase together with a rER-enriched fraction at the 0.9 m/1.4 m interphase. The collected fractions were adjusted to 0.2 m sucrose with 50 mmHepes, pH 8.0, and stored at −20 °C. After thawing and centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, the supernatants containing the soluble Golgi or rER content proteins and the pellets containing Golgi (GM) or rER membranes (rERM) were stored at −20 °C in aliquots for further use. Isolated membranes corresponding to 400 μg of protein were resuspended in 100 μl of 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, and mixed with 200 μl of methanol/chloroform (1:1). After Bligh-Dyer two-phase extraction (27New R.R.C. Rickwood D. Hames B.D. Liposomes-A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1990Google Scholar) lipids were separated by thin layer chromatography (TLC) using a mixture of chloroform:methanol:H2O (65:25:4). To extract polar lipids (28Baldoni E. Bolognani L. Vitaioli L. Eur. J. Histochem. 1995; 39: 253-257PubMed Google Scholar) membranes corresponding to 2 mg of protein were resuspended in 20 μl of 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, and incubated with 500 μl of methanol and 1 ml of n-hexane. After centrifugation at 3000 × g for 5 min, 1 ml of chloroform was added to the methanol phase, and centrifugation was repeated. The resulting supernatant was submitted to TLC using a mixture of chloroform:methanol:0.25% KCl (50:54:10). Lipids were visualized by 20% (v/v) H2SO4 at 150 °C and quantitated. Cholesterol, glucosyl ceramide, lactosyl ceramide, sulfatides, phosphatidylcholine, and sphingomyelin were used as standards. 500 μg of membranes were incubated on ice for 30 min in 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and were centrifuged at 120,000 × g for 30 min. The Triton X-100-insoluble pellet fraction was resuspended in 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, and adjusted to 1.2 m sucrose. 500 μl of the pellet fraction were overlayed with 1 ml of 1.1 m and 0.5 ml of 0.15m sucrose. After centrifugation for 1 h at 120,000 × g in a swing out rotor (TLA 120.1, Beckman Instruments, Munich, Germany) fractions of 200 μl were collected from the top of the gradient. For flotation experiments with ZGM and GM, membranes were bicarbonate-treated prior to Triton X-100 extraction to partially remove membrane-associated matrix components which were found to inhibit flotation. Proteins were precipitated by methanol (29Wessel D. Flugge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3141) Google Scholar) and analyzed by gel electrophoresis. Lipids were extracted by Bligh-Dyer two-phase extraction (27New R.R.C. Rickwood D. Hames B.D. Liposomes-A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1990Google Scholar) and analyzed by TLC. Using an orogastric tube rats were fed with a single dose of 50 mg/kg of FOY-305 (Sanol-Schwarz, Mohnheim, Germany) dissolved in 1 ml of tap water and were sacrificed 6–9 h after feeding. FOY treatment for up to 6 h results in partial degranulation (40–60%) of the pancreas (30Rausch U. Adler G. Weidenbach H. Weidenbach F. Rudolff D. Koop I. Kern H.F. Cell Tissue Res. 1987; 247: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Pancreatic lobules were prepared as described previously (31Scheele G.A. Palade G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 2660-2670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lobules were incubated at 37 °C under agitation and were supplied with 100% O2 every 15 min. For cholesterol depletion the lobules were incubated for 2.5 h in 5 ml MEM (Sigma, Munich, Germany) containing 25 mm mevalonate acid-lactone (Sigma) and 0.4 mm lovastatin (Merck Sharp & Dohme, Haar, Germany) and thereafter treated with 10 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin (CD) for 30 min (Sigma). For inhibition of GPI-anchor biosynthesis lobules were incubated for 3 h either in 5 ml of glucose-deficient MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 50 mm d-mannosamine (Sigma) or were first incubated in 5 ml of MEM for 2.5 h and afterwards in MEM containing 5 μg/ml YW 3548 (Novartis, Basel, Switzerland) for an additional 30 min. Ceramide biosynthesis was inhibited by treatment with 28 μmfumonisin B1 for 3 h. Treated lobules and controls were either used for electron microscopy or for pulse-chase experiments. Drug-treated lobules and controls were washed twice with Met/Cys-deficient medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) and were pulse-labeled for 10 min at 37 °C in 5 ml of pulse medium containing 200 μCi/ml Tran35S-label (ICN, Eschwege, Germany) and the appropriate drugs (mevalonate/lovastatin, fumonisin B1, mannosamine, or YW 3548). After washing in MEM the lobules were incubated for different chase times in 5 ml of chase medium (MEM containing 10 × Met/Cys and the appropriate drugs). Exocytosis of zymogen granules was hormonally induced by the addition of 1 ng/ml caerulein, 25 μmcarbamoylcholine chloride, 130 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (Sigma), and 1 mm cyclic 8-bromo-adenosine-3′:5′-monophosphate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) to the chase medium. For determination of secreted amylase the proteins of 200–500 μl of chase medium were precipitated by trichloroacetic acid, resuspended in the same volume of Laemmli buffer, and separated by SDS-PAGE. Quantitation of radiolabeled amylase was performed on the gels using a Bio-imager FUJIX BAS 1500 and TINATM software, version 2.0 (Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany). Total amylase was quantitated after Coomassie staining or immunoblotting of the corresponding gels. Alternatively, amylase activity in the medium was assayed according to Ref. 32Rick W. Stegbauer H.P. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, Germany1974: 149-158Google Scholar.35S-Amylase secretion after different experimental conditions was determined in relation to total normalized amylase secretion. Similar results were obtained when total amylase was either determined by quantitation of gels or by enzyme activity. In Fig. 5data obtained after quantitation of gels are shown. Lactate dehydrogenase activity was assayed using commercially available test kits (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and expressed as percent of total lactate dehydrogenase activity in the medium and cell homogenate. Trypsin activity was measured according to Ref. 33Hummel B.C. Can. J. Biochem. 1959; 37: 1393-1399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. For determination of protein-bound radioactivity, samples were applied to 3MM filters (Whatman, Maidstone, United Kingdom). The filters were swirled in 10% trichloroacetic acid on ice for 30 min and washed with ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid and ethanol. After drying of the filters the radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting (Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany). Protein synthesis and incorporation of radioactivity was reduced after cholesterol depletion (70% of control levels) and after treatment with mannosamine (60% of control levels). However, the ratios of the total protein-bound radioactivity present in the ZG, rER, and Golgi subfractions to total radioactivity incorporated in the postnuclear supernatant were similar after all treatments, indicating that protein delivery to the secretory pathway was not disturbed. Therefore, the protein-bound radioactivity of the individual subfractions was expressed as percent of total protein-bound radioactivity of all subfractions (Σ cpm ZG, rER, Golgi) (Table I).Table IEffects of inhibition of GPI-anchor biosynthesis and cholesterol depletion on de novo granule formationInhibitionMock (control lobules)Cholesterol biosynthesis (extraction by CD) (lovastatin/mevalonate, CD)Ceramide biosynthesis (fumonisin B1)GPI-anchor biosynthesis (N-glycosylation) (mannosamine)GPI-anchor biosynthesis (YW 3548)cpm (% of total), mean ± S.D.ZG24.4 ± 7.15.4 ± 0.910 ± 2.81.2 ± 0.214.8 ± 0.8Golgi70.1 ± 8.595 ± 0.785.8 ± 3.285 ± 0.276.5 ± 2.7rER4.9 ± 1.34.2 ± 0.34.3 ± 0.414 ± 0.38.5 ± 2.6Pancreatic lobules were prepared from rats fed with a single dose of FOY-305 leading to hormonally stimulated release of zymogen granules.

Immunoblots were processed using either enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or diaminobenzidine reagent (0.05% diaminobenzidine, 0.04% CoCl3, 0.05% H2O2 in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). Silver staining of gels was performed according to Hempelmann (35Hempelmann E. Kaminsky R. Electrophoresis. 1986; 7: 481Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For quantitation immunoblots were scanned and processed using PC bas software. Sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) were detected using the Blyscan assay according to the manufacturer's protocol (Biocolor, Belfast, Ireland). Briefly, a precipitable complex was formed by binding of the Blyscan dye to free GAGs or those bound to proteoglycans. After dissociation of the precipitated complex the samples were photometrically quantified, or in the case of radiolabeled material, samples were analyzed by liquid scintillation counting. Pancreatic lobules were fixed in 0.1% cacodylate buffer, pH 7.3, containing 1% glutaraldehyde (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany), postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide, and embedded in Epon according to standard procedures. Thin sections (70 nm) were stained with uranyl acetate/lead citrate and examined using a Zeiss EM 9S electron microscope. For immunolabeling thin sections of Epon-embedded samples were etched with 10% H2O2 for 5 min, blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, and afterward incubated with an antibody to carboxypeptidase α and visualized using 10 nm protein A-gold. This antibody showed specific labeling of ZG and Golgi cisternae, but was not found to label other intracellular organelles. Quantitative analysis of the intactness of junctional complexes at the apical pole, the integrity of the apical and intracellular membranes (ER, mitochondria, granules), and of morphological alterations of the Golgi complex after different experimental treatments was performed on photographs at ×3000–12,000 (Table II). Sections were systematically scanned at the electron microscope, and each acinus encountered was photographed. A cell (acinus) was defined as intact (polarized) if the apico-lateral junctions and the plasma membrane showed no sign of disruption and if the ZG were still concentrated apically. Furthermore, the integrity of other internal organelles (see above) was comprised.Table IIQuantitative analysis of ultrastructural dataControlChol. dep.Fumonisin B1MannosamineYW 3548% of totalJunctional complexes + apical membrane intact92.9 ± 5.583.1 ± 693.3 ± 1.387.5 ± 7.790.1 ± 6.8n = 510n = 372n = 298n = 325n = 325Intracellular membranes intact95 ± 2.287 ± 3.694 ± 2.289.8 ± 7.392.8 ± 4.3n = 582n = 396n = 336n = 387n = 348Golgi cisternae altered31.3 ± 5.472.5 ± 8.775.3 ± 7.772.3 ± 3.679.2 ± 9.4n = 294n = 257n = 204n = 144n = 260Pancreatic lobules were prepared and incubated with the different inhibitors as described in Table I.

Complementary DNAs from five G protein β subunit genes (Gβ1–5) have been identified by molecular cloning. Whereas the Gβ1–4 isoforms are highly homologous (80–90%) and widely expressed (2Gautam N.

Instead, Gβ5 has been purified from retinal cytosol bound to regulator of G protein signaling (RGS)1 protein-7 (RGS7) (9Cabrera J.L. De Freitas F. Satpaev D.K. Slepak V.Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

These recent novel observations underscore the view of Gβ5 as a unique and highly specialized G protein subunit but leave open the question of its function within the brain. To this end this work was undertaken to examine the intracellular distribution of Gβ5. The results demonstrate that Gβ5, along with RGS7, is expressed prominently in the neuronal nucleus, as well as the cell membrane and cytosol. This distribution pattern suggests that Gβ5·RGS complexes may shuttle information between classical G protein-signaling elements at the plasma membrane and the cell nucleus. For maintenance, rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells were grown in 75-cm2 flasks grown at 37 °C and 5% CO2 containing DMEM supplemented with 10% horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, 4 mm l-glutamine, 1 × penicillin/streptomycin (Biofluids, Rockville, MD) (supplemented DMEM) without the addition of nerve growth factor (NGF). Cells were processed for immunofluorescent staining as described previously (17Barr V.A. Lane K. Taylor S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21416-21424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Briefly, PC12 cells were plated onto poly-d-lysine-precoated covered chamber slides (Lab-Tek II, Nalge) and grown in supplemented DMEM containing 50 ng/ml NGF at 37 °C for 16 h. The medium was discarded, and the cells were washed and then fixed in 2% (v/v) formalin in phosphate-buffered saline. The slides were then incubated with one or more primary antibodies in phosphate-buffered saline, 10% fetal calf serum (v/v), and 0.075% (w/v) saponin for 1.5 h, washed, and then incubated with appropriate labeled secondary antibody (fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG and rhodamine red-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs, West Grove, PA)) in the same buffer for 45 min. For imaging of nuclei, cells were treated with the DNA-binding cyanine dye YOYO (18Rye H.S. Yue S. Wemmer D.E. Quesada M.A. Haugland R.P. Mathies R.A. Glazer A.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2803-2812Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). After staining, 1–2 drops of Permount (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA) were added to the sample surface. For epifluorescent imaging, cells were viewed in a Zeiss Axiophot inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NY), and images were captured with a PentaMAX camera (Princeton Instruments Inc., Trenton, NJ) utilizing IP Labs software (Scanalytics Inc., Fairfax, VA). For confocal imaging, cells were viewed with a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning microscope. Final images were processed using Adobe Photoshope (Adobe Systems Inc., Mountain View, CA) software. CD1 mouse brain (1 g, wet weight) or a PC12 cell pellet (∼1 × 107 cells) were homogenized (30 strokes) with a Dounce homogenizer with a B-type pestle in 5 ml of Buffer A (50 mmtriethanolamine HCl, pH 7.5; 25 mm KCl; 5 mmMgCl2; 0.5 mm dithiothreitol; 17 μg/ml AEBSF; 2 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin; and 1 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor) containing 0.25 m sucrose on ice. For PC12 cells the homogenate was further passed five times through a 25-gauge needle to ensure that the majority of cells were broken. An aliquot of the homogenate was then stained with trypan blue, and the integrity of nuclei was verified under a light microscope. The nuclear, cytosolic, and membrane fractions were prepared as described by Schilling et al. (19Schilling G. Wood J.D. Duan K. Slunt H.H. Gonzales V. Yamada M. Cooper J.K. Margolis R.L. Jenkins N.A.

The homogenate was centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to remove tissue debris (first pellet). The first supernatant was then centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The second pellet was saved, and the second supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The third supernatant was taken as cytosol extract and the third pellet as membrane fraction that was extracted by resuspension in Buffer A containing 0.5% (w/v) Genapol C-100 and incubating on a rocker at 4 °C for 2 h. The second pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of Buffer A and mixed with 2 ml of Buffer B (Buffer A containing 2.3m sucrose). The mixture was carefully loaded on top of 1 ml of Buffer B, and the nuclei was pelleted by centrifugation at 12,400 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellet was washed once with Buffer A containing 0.25 m sucrose and labeled as nuclear extract. For independent experimental replication, the membrane, nuclear, and cytosol fractions of both mouse brain and PC12 cells were also obtained commercially (Geneka Biotechnology, Quebec, Canada). Proteins from different fractions were quantified by both the Bradford method (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) and Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels. PC12 nuclear extract prepared as above was dialyzed against 20 mmTris-HCl and 5 mm dithiothreitol overnight at 4 °C, then loaded onto a Mono Q anion exchange column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in the same buffer. The column was eluted in a gradient from 0 to 0.6 m NaCl, and the fractions containing a broad peak of Gβ5 C-terminal antibody SGS/1 (5Zhang S.Y. Coso O.A. Lee C.H. Gutkind J.S. Simonds W.F. J. Biol.

Samples of partially purified nuclear extract and parallel samples of mouse brain membrane extract were treated with endoproteinase Lys-C or Glu-C (V8 protease) (Calbiochem) at an enzyme:protein ratio of 1:50 (w/w) for 30 min at 30 °C and analyzed by SGS antibody immunoblotting as described (5Zhang S.Y.

Protein samples were separated on 4–20% gradient slab gels (Novex) by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and after primary and secondary antibody incubation, chemiluminescent signal was detected using the Lumi-Light Plus™ Western blot kit (Roche) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

A PC12 cell line stably transfected with pTet-On (CLONTECH) was then subsequently transfected with the pTRE-HAGβ5 plasmid or pTRE vector only as follows. About 5 × 106 of log phase PC12 cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 0.4 ml of DMEM without fetal bovine serum. The cell suspension was transferred to an electroporation cuvette and mixed with 15 μg of pTRE-HAGβ5 plasmid or pTRE vector and 1 μg of pTK-HG plasmid (encoding the hygromycin resistance gene). After the mixture was incubated in the hood for 10 min, the cells were electroporated at 220 V and 950 microfarads. Cells were immediately transferred to 10 ml of fresh DMEM containing 100 μg/ml G418 in a 100-mm dish (biocoated) and incubated at 37 °C. After a 24-h incubation, hygromycin was added to a final concentration of 200 μg/ml, and the culture was placed back in the incubator until individual colonies were visible. Individual colonies were expanded, and the level of HA-Gβ5 gene expression was determined by Western blot analysis. Peak protein expression upon doxycycline induction (2.5 μg/ml) occurred in 6–12 h. For construction of a GFP-Gβ5 fusion expression plasmid, wild-type Gβ5 cDNA was cloned in-frame downstream of a red-shifted GFP variant in the pEGFP-C2 vector (CLONTECH) using the Rapid Ligation Kit (Roche). The starting methionine of Gβ5 in this construct was eliminated by mutation into alanine using the QuickChange site-direct mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The resultant construct was named pEGFP-Gβ5. For construction of the pEGFP-Gβ5-L22P,L26P mutant, codons corresponding to leucine residues 22 and 26 of the wild-type Gβ5 sequence within the pEGFP-Gβ5 construct were altered to prolines using the QuickChange kit. For construction of the GFP-Gβ1 fusion protein, the Gβ1 cDNA was polymerase chain reaction amplified using a 5′-primer that converted the starting methionine to alanine, and the resulting polymerase chain reaction product was ligated in-frame into the pEGFP-C2 vector. The resultant construct was named pEGFP-Gβ1. For transient expression of RGS7, codons 2–469 (full-length except for the starting methionine) of bovine RGS7 (kindly provided by Dr. Vladlen Slepak) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction employing the Pwo polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim). Primers encoding 5′- and 3′-BamHI linkers were employed, and after digestion the resulting construct was ligated in-frame into the BamHI site of pcDNA4/HisMax-C vector (Invitrogen), which adds N-terminal His6 and Xpress epitope tags. The DNA sequence of all inserts was verified by dideoxy sequencing. 1 day prior to transient transfection of GFP fusion plasmids, PC12 cells at 90% confluence were harvested and plated in 2 ml of supplemented DMEM containing 50 ng/ml NGF into the chambers of poly-d-glycine-coated chamber slides as detailed above. The number of cells was adjusted to 70% of their density at harvest. After overnight incubation of the cells, 2 μg of plasmid DNA and 8 μl of LipofectAmine 2000 reagent (Life Technologies), diluted in 200 μl of Opti-MEMI medium, were mixed, incubated at room temperature for 20 min, and added directly to each chamber. After mixing gently, the culture was incubated for 24–48 h. The expression of each fusion construct was then verified by immunoblotting, and the fluorescence of the GFP fusion proteins was determined by fluorescence microscopy as detailed above.

Neurochem. 1998; 71: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) brain homogenates demonstrated previously Gβ5 association with both membrane and cytosolic fractions. To resolve and analyze the subcellular distribution of Gβ5 better, a homogeneous population of neuronal cells in continuous culture such as PC12 cells, which upon differentiation assume a neuron-like phenotype, offers many advantages over brain. The expression of Gβ5 mRNA and protein in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells as well as several other cell lines of neuroendocrine origin was recently documented by ribonuclease protection and immunoblotting, respectively (23Zhang J.H. Lai Z.N. Simonds W.F. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 393-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The levels of Gβ5 expression in PC12 cells was not altered significantly by NGF treatment and differentiation into sympathetic neuron-like cells (23Zhang J.H. Lai Z.N. Simonds W.F. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 393-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We therefore studied the intracellular distribution of Gβ5 in NGF-differentiated PC12 cells by immunocytochemical methods (Fig. 1,A and B). Unexpectedly, an epifluorescent signal over the nucleus, in addition to diffuse cytoplasmic staining, was evident with ATDG antibody directed against the N terminus of Gβ5 (11Zhang J.H. Simonds W.F. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1-5Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.1 A). Cells processed in parallel with preimmune antibodies produced a weaker background signal (Fig. 1 B). To confirm that the Gβ5 immunofluorescent signal over the nucleus seen by light microscopy was indeed associated with the nucleus, subcellular fractionation of PC12 cells and immunoblotting analysis with two different antibodies to Gβ5 were performed: N-terminally directed ATDG and the C-terminally directed SGS antibody (5Zhang S.Y. Coso O.A. Lee C.H. Gutkind J.S. Simonds W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33575-33579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, E and F). In the resulting immunoblots both antibodies demonstrated a ∼39-kDa immunoreactive band in the nuclear fraction of PC12 cells of identical mobility to the Gβ5 present in the membrane and cytosolic fractions (Fig.1 E, upper panel, and 1 F). In contrast, Gβ1 immunoreactivity was confined to the membrane fraction (Fig.1 E, middle panel). To verify the identity of the ∼39-kDa immunoreactive band in the PC12 cell nuclear fraction as Gβ5, immunoblots with antibody SGS directed against the C terminus of Gβ5(5) were performed on control and experimental samples subjected to limited proteolytic digestion (5Zhang S.Y. Coso O.A. Lee C.H. Gutkind J.S. Simonds W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33575-33579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 G). Partial digestion with endoproteinase Lys-C resulted in major C-terminal fragments of ∼22 kDa and 12 kDa, whereas treatment with V8 protease resulted in a major ∼35-kDa C-terminal immunoreactive fragment (Fig.1 G). The C-terminal fragments were identical in mobility to those generated in parallel from mouse brain membranes (Fig.1 G) and to those generated from recombinant Gβ5 as described previously (5Zhang S.Y. Coso O.A. Lee C.H. Gutkind J.S. Simonds W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33575-33579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To increase the signal to noise ratio for further immunofluorescence studies, PC12 cells were stably transfected with an N-terminally HA epitope-tagged Gβ5 cDNA under the control of an inducible promoter. When induced by doxycycline in NGF-differentiated PC12 cells, the pattern of Gβ5 immunoreactivity was the same as that seen by epifluorescence in the naı̈ve PC12 cells, with strong cytoplasmic and nuclear expression whether analyzed with ATDG antibody (Fig. 2,A and C) or anti-HA antibody (not shown). The nuclear localization was confirmed by confocal microscopy and dual immunofluorescence analysis with the DNA-binding cyanine dye YOYO (18Rye H.S. Yue S. Wemmer D.E. Quesada M.A. Haugland R.P. Mathies R.A. Glazer A.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2803-2812Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, D–F). Three groups have independently isolated tight native complexes of Gβ5 bound to RGS7 from rodent brain (10Witherow D.S. Wang Q. Levay K. Cabrera J.L. Chen J. Willars G.B. Slepak V.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24872-24880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 11Zhang J.H. Simonds W.F. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1-5Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Liang J.J. Chen H.H.D. Jones P.G. Khawaja X.Z. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 60: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the cells for evidence of nuclear expression of RGS7. Confocal microscopic analysis of cells probed with antibody to the C terminus of RGS7 revealed strong cytoplasmic and a weaker, patchy nuclear staining pattern(Fig. 2 B). A similar distribution of RGS7 was evident in naı̈ve PC12 cells analyzed with the same antibody (Fig. 1 C; compare with 1D). Dual immunofluorescence analysis with both Gβ5 and RGS7 antibodies revealed colocalization of proteins as evidenced by the faint orange coloration of nuclei staining with both antibodies (Fig. 2,B and C). Mouse brain was studied to probe the generality of the Gβ5 expression pattern determined in naı̈ve and transfected sympathetic neuron-like PC12 cells. Analysis of mouse brain subcellular fractions was performed by immunoblotting (Fig.3 A). This approach was preferable over immunocytochemical analysis insofar as a recent confocal dual immunofluorescence study with antibodies to Gβ5 and RGS7 documented their colocalization in many regions of rat brain but reached no conclusion about their subcellular distribution (24Liang J.J. Chen H.H.D. Jones P.G. Khawaja X.Z. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 60: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). As in PC12 cells, Gβ5 immunoreactivity at 39 kDa was evident in the membrane, cytosolic, and nuclear fractions of mouse brain, whereas the Gβ1 36-kDa immunoreactive band was confined to the membrane fraction (Fig. 3 A). Antibodies to Gγ2/γ3 reacted strongly only with a ∼6.5-kDa band in the membrane fraction (Fig. 3 A). Immunoblotting with two different antibodies to RGS7, C-19 and R-20, yielded bands in all three subcellular fractions. In the membrane and cytosolic fractions the immunoreactivity of the major band at ∼55 kDa, but not the reactivity of a faint upper band in the cytosol, could be blocked by preincubation with the cognate peptide (Fig. 3 A). In the nuclear fraction a doublet of immunoreactive bands migrating slightly slower than the ∼55kDa membrane and cytosolic bands disappeared with peptide preincubation (Fig. 3 A), confirming their identity as RGS7-related proteins. Interestingly, a recent analysis of the intracellular distribution of epitope-tagged RGS4 in transfected COS-7 cells also found preferential nuclear expression of a slower migrating species (25Chatterjee T.K. Fisher R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24013-24021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The nature and significance of the slower migrating forms of RGS7 in brain nuclei are unclear. Tight complexes between native Gβ5 and RGS6 and RGS7 present in brain membranes and cytosol have been demonstrated in previous studies (10Witherow D.S. Wang Q. Levay K. Cabrera J.L. Chen J. Willars G.B. Slepak V.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24872-24880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 11Zhang J.H. Simonds W.F. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1-5Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Liang J.J. Chen H.H.D. Jones P.G. Khawaja X.Z. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 60: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and the presence of both Gβ5 and RGS7 in the brain nuclear fraction raises the question of their possible interaction in that compartment. To check for possible complex formation between the RGS7 and Gβ5in the brain nuclear fraction, immunoprecipitation with C-terminally directed RGS7 antibody was performed (Fig. 3 B). Both an RGS7-immunoreactive band at 55 kDa and a Gβ5-immunoreactive band at 39 kDa were evident in anti-RGS7 immunoprecipitates but not in control immunoprecipitates employing normal goat IgG. These results are consistent with a tight association between Gβ5 and RGS7 in the mouse brain nuclear fraction. The colocalization of Gβ5 with RGS7 in the nuclei of PC12 cells (Fig. 2) taken together with the results above demonstrating coimmunoprecipitation of Gβ5with RGS7 from brain nuclear extract (Fig. 3 B) suggest that nuclear Gβ5 is present as a heterodimer with one or more GGL domain-containing RGS proteins. To check if such heterodimerization might be required for proper nuclear localization of Gβ5, three chimeric protein constructs containing GFP were prepared and studied in transiently transfected PC12 cells. These chimeras contained GFP fused in frame to (a) wild-type Gβ5 (GFP- Gβ5), (b) a double point mutant Gβ5 in which leucines at positions 22 and 26 were mutated to prolines (GFP-Gβ5-L22P,L26P), or (c) Gβ1 (GFP-Gβ1), the last serving as a negative control. The leucine residues mutated in GFP- Gβ5-L22P,L26P were chosen so as to disrupt the postulated N-terminal coiled-coil region of Gβ5 comprising the putative RGS dimerization interface (13Levay K. Cabrera J.L. Satpaev D.K. Slepak V.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2503-2507Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 14Snow B.E. Krumins A.M. Brothers G.M. Lee S.F. Wall M.A. Chung S.

All three GFP fusion proteins were expressed in transiently transfected PC12 cells and had the expected immunoreactivity according to their chimeric composition as evidenced by immunoblots (Fig. 4 C). Furthermore, the effect of the L22P,L26P mutations in Gβ5was to disrupt interaction with GGL domain-containing RGS proteins (13Levay K. Cabrera J.L. Satpaev D.K. Slepak V.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2503-2507Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar,14Snow B.E. Krumins A.M. Brothers G.M. Lee S.F. Wall M.A. Chung S. Mangion J. Arya S. Gilman A.G. Siderovski D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13307-13312Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), as evidenced by the greatly diminished ability of the GFP-Gβ5 mutant to coimmunoprecipitate with RGS7 in transfected PC12 cells under conditions permissive for the wild-type GFP-Gβ5 fusion (Fig. 4 D). Like Gβ5 in naı̈ve and stably transfected PC12 cells analyzed immunocytochemically, the fluorescence of GFP- Gβ5 was strong in the nuclei of the majority of transiently transfected PC12 cells (Fig. 4 B, left panel). In contrast the pattern of signal in GFP- Gβ5-L22P,L26P and GFP- Gβ1 transfected cells showed only faint fluorescence in the cell nuclei of most labeled cells (Fig. 4 B, right and middle panels). Such a faint background nuclear signal is often seen with GFP fusion proteins targeted predominantly to the cytosol and may be related to the ability of the GFP moiety to enter the nucleus passively (26Grebenok R.J. Pierson E. Lambert G.M. Gong F.C. Afonso C.L. Haldeman-Cahill R. Carrington J.C. Galbraith D.W. Plant. J. 1997; 11: 573-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The anomalous cytosolic expression of the GFP-Gβ1fusion compared with endogenous Gβ1 (compare Figs.1 E and 3 A) is likely caused by impaired Gγ binding and/or isoprenylation in the context of GFP- Gβ1·Gγ heterodimers. Cytosolic expression of GFP-Gβ fusion proteins has been noted previously by other laboratories (27Jin T. Zhang N. Long Y. Parent C.A. Devreotes P.N. Science. 2000; 287: 1034-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar,28Obrdlik P. Neuhaus G. Merkle T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 208-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The nuclear localization documented here illustrates another novel property of Gβ5 and provides the first example of a heterotrimeric Gβ subunit expressed in the neuronal cell nucleus. Gβ1 was found in the nucleus of growth factor-stimulated Swiss 3T3 cells as part of a heterotrimer with Giα, although it was absent from the nuclear fraction in quiescent cells (29Crouch M.F. Simson L. FASEB. J. 1997; 11: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In neurons several Gα isoforms have been found to undergo retrograde axonal transport and localize in the cell nucleus (for review, see Ref. 30Willard F.S. Crouch M.F. Immunol. Cell Biol. 2000; 78: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Whether any functional interactions might exist between Gβ5·RGS complexes or perhaps other RGS proteins (25Chatterjee T.K. Fisher R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24013-24021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 31Dulin N.O. Pratt P. Tiruppathi C. Niu J. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T. Dunn M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21317-21323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and Gα subunits within the neuronal nuclear compartment remains to be shown. The molecular basis for the nuclear targeting of Gβ5 in neurons and brain is unclear. The primary sequence of Gβ5lacks an obvious consensus nuclear localization signal (NLS) (32Jans D.A. Hubner S. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 651-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Furthermore, its sequence is wholly contained within the retinal splice variant Gβ5L, which is strongly membrane-anchored (4Watson A.J. Aragay A.M. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28154-28160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 12Makino E.R. Handy J.W. Li T.S. Arshavsky V.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1947-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) and is therefore unlikely to contain a functional NLS. The demonstration here that mutational perturbation of the N-terminal region of Gβ5, which blocks its ability to form tight complexes with the GGL domain-containing RGS7, also prevents nuclear expression of the GFP fusion protein suggests that RGS7 (or other Gβ5-binding RGS proteins (14Snow B.E. Krumins A.M. Brothers G.M. Lee S.F. Wall M.A. Chung S. Mangion J. Arya S. Gilman A.G. Siderovski D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13307-13312Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar)) may contain a NLS. Recent evidence that other RGS proteins including RGS2, RGS10 (25Chatterjee T.K. Fisher R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24013-24021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and a truncated version of RGS3 (RGS3T) (31Dulin N.O. Pratt P. Tiruppathi C. Niu J. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T. Dunn M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21317-21323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) exhibit nuclear localization and contain putative NLS sequences makes this possibility more likely. Neither RGS6 nor RGS7 contains the Arg-Lys-Arg-Lys and Arg-Arg-Arg NLS sequence postulated for RGS3T (31Dulin N.O. Pratt P. Tiruppathi C. Niu J. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T. Dunn M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21317-21323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) nor the Lys-Lys-Xaa-Lys/Arg putative NLS motif present in RGS2, RGS4, and RGS16 (25Chatterjee T.K. Fisher R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24013-24021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, RGS6 and RGS7 contain other sequence patterns suggestive of NLS (32Jans D.A. Hubner S. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 651-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) including Lys454-Lys-Lys-Pro and Lys370-Lys/Arg-Arg-Pro present in the long splice variant of RGS6 (15Snow B.E. Betts L. Mangion J. Sondek J. Siderovski D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6489-6494Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and RGS7 (33He W. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Neuron. 1998; 20: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), respectively. Whether these or other candidate sequences in RGS6 and RGS7 actually function as NLS remains to be tested experimentally, however. In PC12 cells the nuclear staining with RGS7 antibody was consistently fainter and less uniform than the Gβ5 nuclear staining. This result might be expected because RGS7 is only one of several Gβ5-binding RGS partners present in PC12 cells. Indeed, preliminary analysis of PC12 cells and mouse brain with anti-RGS6 antibody demonstrates nuclear expression similar to that of RGS7 (not shown). Other GGL domain-containing RGS proteins such as RGS9 and 11 expressed in brain may also be present with Gβ5 in the nucleus. Is the distribution of Gβ5 and RGS7 to the nuclear compartment regulated or constitutive? Recently a phosphorylation-dependent interaction of RGS7 with 14-3-3 proteins was demonstrated by Benzing et al. (34Benzing T. Yaffe M.B. Arnould T. Sellin L. Schermer B. Schilling B. Schreiber R. Kunzelmann K. Leparc G.G. Kim E. Walz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28167-28172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Interaction with 14-3-3 proteins is known to govern the nuclear localization of the Cdc25 phosphatase (35Lopez-Girona A. Furnari B. Mondesert O. Russell P. Nature. 1999; 397: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar) and certain transcription factors (36Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5333) Google Scholar) and might possibly regulate the nuclear targeting of Gβ5 and RGS7. Preliminary experiments testing the influence of various ligands for endogenous receptors in PC12 cells on the subcellular distribution of transfected GFP-Gβ5fusion protein in living cells revealed no evident alterations at the light microscopic level (not shown). Nevertheless the question of possible cell surface receptor regulation of Gβ5 and RGS7 nuclear targeting will require more thorough investigation. The function of Gβ5 and RGS7 in the nucleus remains unknown. It is conceivable that Gβ5 and/or RGS7 may directly or indirectly regulate nuclear transcription. If this were true, how would such a function relate to the well documented ability of domains within Gβ5·RGS complexes to interact with classical heterotrimeric G protein subunits and/or their effectors when tested in vitro? The distribution of Gβ5·RGS heterodimers (and likley other RGS proteins (25Chatterjee T.K. Fisher R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24013-24021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 31Dulin N.O. Pratt P. Tiruppathi C. Niu J. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T. Dunn M.J. J. Biol.

Thus as has been shown for RGS proteins such as p115 RhoGEF (37Kozasa T. Jiang X.J. Hart M.J. Sternweis P.M. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Bollag G. Sternweis P.C.

The TGF-β superfamily signals through phosphorylation and activation of R-Smad proteins, receptor-regulated Smads, by heteromeric complexes of ligand-specific type I and type II serine/threonine kinase receptors. R-Smads receive a signal from the activated receptor complex and transmit it to the nucleus.

Furthermore, SmSmad2 was shown to undergo phosphorylation by constitutively active forms of SmTβR-I in vitro. In addition, SmSmad2 localized in the nuclei of mink lung epithelial cells upon treatment with TGF-β1. These data indicate that the SmSmad2 responds to the TGF-β signals by interaction with receptor I, which phosphorylates it, whereupon it translocates into the nucleus presumably to regulate target gene transcription and consequently elicit a specific TGF-β effect.AF232025 Smad proteins are essential intracellular signal transducers of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily.

According to the World Health Organization records, about 300 million people in 76 countries are currently infected. More than 600 million people live in endemic areas and are at risk of contracting the disease (1Engers H.D. Bergquist R. Modabber F. Dev. Biol. Stand. 1996; 87: 73-84PubMed Google Scholar). The egg is the major cause of the pathology and complications of the disease such as portal hypertension, liver fibrosis hemorrhage, and death (2Boros D.L. Clin. Microbiol.

Furthermore, schistosomes reside in portal circulation surrounded by host molecules such as antibodies, hormones, cytokines, and growth factors.

Chem. 1998; 273: 11234-11240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 6Ramachandran H. Skelly P.J. Shoemaker C.B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 83: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 7Silva E.E. Clarke M.W. Podesta R.B. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 7057-7066PubMed Google Scholar). Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)1 serine/threonine kinase receptor I (TβRI) was recently identified in Schistosoma mansoni, SmTβR-I (5Davies S.J. Shoemaker C.B. Pearce E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11234-11240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The presence of SmTβRI on the surface of the parasite raises the possibility of the involvement of TGF-β or a TGF-β-like ligand in the host-parasite interactions or in the stimulation of female worm maturation by male schistosomes. TGF-β is a superfamily of secreted polypeptides including various forms of TGF-β, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), activins, inhibins, and many other structurally related factors (8Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3946) Google Scholar). Members of this family regulate cell migration, differentiation, adhesion, multiplication, and death throughout the life span of an organism (9Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These different effects result from the changes in the expression of key target genes, which depend on the cell type and developmental stage. Three classes of intracellular signal transducers are involved in the signaling cascade of the TGF-β family as follows: a family of plasma membrane serine/threonine kinase receptors (known as type I and type II receptors); a family of cytoplasmic proteins that either transmit the signal from the activated receptor complex to the nucleus or down-regulate the signaling pathway, known as Smad family; and gene-specific nuclear DNA-binding partners that associate with Smad proteins forming transcriptional complexes (8Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3946) Google Scholar, 10Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3301) Google Scholar). The signaling pathway is initiated by ligand binding to the extracellular domain of the type II receptor kinase. The cytoplasmic domain of type II receptor catalyzes the phosphorylation and concomitant activation of the specific type I receptor kinase. Once activated, the type I receptor binds to and phosphorylates a member of a subset of the Smad family, receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads). The phosphorylation of R-Smads destabilizes the complex with type I receptor releasing the activated R-Smad (11Macias-Silva M. Abdollah S. Hoodless P.A. Pirone R. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1996; 87: 1215-1224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar) allowing it to associate with a related protein Smad4, known as comediator Smad or co-Smad (12Lagna G. Hata A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J. Nature. 1996; 383: 832-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar,13Zhang Y. Musci T. Derynck R. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 270-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The heteromeric complex (R-Smad/co-Smad) then translocates into the nucleus (14Liu F. Pouponnot C. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3157-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) where it associates with specific DNA-binding partner(s) that direct it to the regulatory region of target gene(s) (9Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two structural motifs in the type I receptor and the corresponding R-Smad, the L45 loop and L3 loop, respectively, contain subtype-specific residues and determine the specificity of the interaction between these two members of the signaling cascade (15Feng X.H. Derynck R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3912-3923Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar,16Lo R.S. Chen Y.G. Shi Y. Pavletich N.P. Massague J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 996-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). R-Smads and co-Smads consist of conserved N- and C-terminal domains and MH1 and MH2 domains. The MH1 domain possesses a DNA binding activity (17Kim J. Johnson K. Chen H.J. Carroll S. Laughon A. Nature. 1997; 388: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 18Shi Y. Wang Y.F. Jayaraman L. Yang H. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1998; 94: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar), and the MH2 domain exerts a transcriptional activation function (19Baker J.C. Harland R.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1880-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 20Liu F. Hata A. Baker J.C. Doody J. Carcamo J. Harland R.M. Massague J. Nature. 1996; 381: 620-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). These conserved domains are linked by an intervening, nonconserved linker region that varies both in length and sequence (8Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3946) Google Scholar). In the basal state, the MH1 domain of R-Smads interacts with and inhibits the transcriptional (20Liu F. Hata A. Baker J.C. Doody J. Carcamo J. Harland R.M. Massague J. Nature. 1996; 381: 620-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar) and biological (19Baker J.C. Harland R.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1880-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) activities of the MH2 domain. Upon phosphorylation by type I receptor kinase, this auto-inhibitory MH1-MH2 interaction of R-Smad is relieved, allowing the association of the activated R-Smad with co-Smad. The MH2 domain of R-Smads contains receptor phosphorylation sites located at the very C-terminal end of the protein (SSXS) (11Macias-Silva M. Abdollah S. Hoodless P.A. Pirone R. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1996; 87: 1215-1224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 21Kretzschmar M. Liu F. Hata A. Doody J. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 984-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Co-Smads lack this phosphorylation signature motif and consequently do not serve as substrates for receptor I kinases (11Macias-Silva M. Abdollah S. Hoodless P.A. Pirone R. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1996; 87: 1215-1224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). The MH2 domain also mediates the interaction and association of R-Smads with type I receptors (11Macias-Silva M. Abdollah S. Hoodless P.A. Pirone R. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1996; 87: 1215-1224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). We report herein the identification of S. mansoni Smad2 homologue (SmSmad2). We define its expression level in different developmental stages and the localization of the protein and mRNA transcripts in adult worm sections. We also demonstrate that schistosome protein performs the biological activities exhibited by other Smad2 homologues, including its interaction with and phosphorylation by a schistosome homologue of TβR-I (SmTβRI) and nuclear translocation in response to human TGF-β. A fragment of about 1 kb spanning part of the MH1 domain and the linker region was coisolated during our previous work on SmRas cDNA (22Osman A. Niles E.G. LoVerde P.T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 100: 27-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). An oligonucleotide representing the 3′-end of the coding region of SmRas (5′-GACGTCGACTCATTGTATACAACATTTTGC-3′) amplified a 1-kb fragment. The PCR product was cloned into TOPO-TA vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced. Sequence analysis of this fragment showed that it is related to members of R-Smad subclass of the Smad family. The DNA fragment was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by Megaprime labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and used as a probe to screen S. mansoniadult worm pair cDNA library. Eight positive clones were identified, and the sequence information showed that two contain the entire coding region of S. mansoni homologue of Smad2 protein (SmSmad2). Smad2 cDNA representing the MH1 domain was amplified from the parent phagemid with specific 5′- primer (Smad2-cod-5′) containing KpnI (underlined) andSalI (italicized) sites (5′-GGTACC GTCGACCGGAATTCAAAATGAGTCTCTTTACAAGTCCAC-3′) and a reverse primer representing the complementary sequence of bp 533–558. The 430-bp PCR product was subcloned in TOPO-TA vector (Invitrogen), sequenced, and then digested with KpnI at the 5′-end and HpaI at the 3′-end, a unique site present at bp 542 of the cDNA sequence. The excised DNA fragment was then recloned into the parent phagemid digested with the same enzymes yielding a cDNA lacking the 5′-untranslated region. The recombinant phagemid was cleaved with SalI and NotI, and the full-length SmSmad2 insert was subcloned in pGEX-4T-1 linearized with the same enzymes. The recombinant pGEX-SmSmad2 plasmid was overexpressed in TOP10 cells (Invitrogen) using 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 20 °C for 5 h. The recombinant Sj26-SmSmad2 fusion protein (200 μg) was used to immunize a New Zealand rabbit with complete Freund's adjuvant for the primary injection and incomplete adjuvant for the following two booster doses with 3-week intervals between each dose. The immunized rabbit serum was then passed over protein A-Sepharose column, and the IgG fraction was eluted and used in Western blots and immunocytolocalization in adult worm pair cryosections. S. mansoni adult worm pairs were perfused from infected hamsters and homogenized in an extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, and mammalian protease inhibitor mixture; Sigma). The homogenate was sonicated for 1 min and centrifuged at 35,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C, and the soluble fraction was aliquoted and stored at −80 °C until used. Schistosome extract was treated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIAP; Life Technologies, Inc.) at concentrations of 0.2 and 1 unit/μg extract for 30–60 min at 37 °C. The untreated extract, with and without 10× CIAP buffer, along with CIAP-treated extract were separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE. SDS gels were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and the blots were probed with IgG fractions from preimmune rabbit and SmSmad2-GST-immunized rabbit sera (0.5 μg/ml). Biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (0.5 μg/ml;Zymed Laboratories Inc.) was used to probe the reacting primary antibodies, and this in turn was detected using Z-avidin horseradish peroxidase conjugate (0.5 μg/ml;Zymed Laboratories Inc.). The reactions were developed with tetramethyl benzidine reagent (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). The IgG fractions (5 μg/ml) were also used to detect SmSmad2 native protein in adult worm cryosections. Biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (5 μg/ml; Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and Z-avidin FITC conjugate (5 μg/ml; Zymed Laboratories Inc.) or streptavidin-Cy5 conjugate (10 μg/ml; Zymed Laboratories Inc.) were used to localize the primary rabbit IgG antibodies. Probed sections were evaluated using a Bio-Rad MRC100 confocal microscope equipped with a krypton laser. A 674-nm filter was used to visualize the Cy5-probed sections. SmSmad2 transcripts were detected using two approaches. RT-PCR was employed to determine the total transcription level of SmSmad2 in different developmental stages.In situ hybridization was used to detect where SmSmad2 transcripts are localized and in which tissues the protein is synthesized. In RT-PCR, total RNA was purified from different life stages of S. mansoni that are related to the definitive human host, starting with 3-h schistosomules and up to paired 45-day-old adult worms using RNA-stat 60 reagent (Tel-Test, Inc.). RNA was copied by reverse transcription (22Osman A. Niles E.G. LoVerde P.T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 100: 27-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and cDNA was used as templates for subsequent PCR amplification. A primer pair corresponding to bp 1614–1636 and the complementary sequence of bp 1902–1926 was used to amplify a fragment that spanned part of the MH2 domain. SmRXR1 (23Freebern W.J. Osman A. Niles E.G. Christen L. LoVerde P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4577-4585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), a clone previously identified in our laboratory and shown to be constitutively expressed in all human host-related stages of the parasite, was used as an internal control for the RT-PCRs. A primer pair representing part of the SmRXR1 AB-domain (23Freebern W.J. Osman A. Niles E.G. Christen L. LoVerde P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4577-4585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) was used to amplify a 460-bp DNA fragment. To remain in the linear range of amplification, 26 cycles of PCR were performed. The amplification products were size-separated in a 2.0% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and quantified using the Molecular Analyst gel documentation system (Bio-Rad). SmSmad2 PCR products were normalized to those of SmRXR to eliminate the differences in quality and/or quantity of the input RNA in the RT reaction. For the in situ hybridization, an antisense oligonucleotide corresponding to the complementary sequence of bp 695–744 was synthesized, labeled with biotin using Bright-Star biotin labeling kit (Ambion), and used to probe paraffin-embedded sections using mRNAlocator-hyb kit (Ambion) following the manufacturer's instructions. Two primers, one represents the sense sequence of SmSmad2 (5′-GGAAGAGGTTCATCTTTTGGTTCACATCATTCTCG-3′, bp 620–654) and the other represents the antisense sequence ofSmp14 gene (a female-specific gene that produces an eggshell protein) (24Bobek L. Rekosh D.M. van Keulen H. LoVerde P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5544-5548Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) (5′-GCCTCCACCATATCCACTATCGCCATAACCGCTATCACAATCGCTACC-3′), were similarly processed and used as a negative and positive controls, respectively. The probed sections were developed using streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (mRNAlocator-Biotin kit; Ambion), and the sections were lightly counterstained using nuclear fast red. The sections were examined and photographed using Nikon microphot digital microscope. To evaluate the interaction of SmSmad2 with SmTβR-I, DNA encoding wild type and mutant forms of SmSmad2 and SmTβR-I were cloned into the yeast GAL4 two-hybrid vectors (activation domain (AD) and DNA-binding domain (BD)). SmSmad2 cDNA (wild type, wt), in which the EcoRI site at position 1709 was mutated to GAGTTC to maintain the same encoded amino acid sequence was amplified. Amplification was performed using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) with Smad-5′-cod as a forward primer and a reverse primer in which NotI site (underlined) was inserted (NotI-Smad-3′; 5′-GCGGCCGCACTGACAGATGTGCAAGGATG-3′). The PCR product represents a SmSmad2 cDNA in which the stop codon was removed and DNA encoding 3 amino acids (VGG) was inserted downstream of the C-terminal motif (TSVS) of SmSmad2 (SmSmad2–3′). The PCR product was cloned in pCRII-Blunt-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). The wt SmSmad2 was digested with EcoRI/SalI and cloned in pBD-GAL4-cam and pAD-GAL4–2.1 vectors (Stratagene) downstream of GAL4 DNA-binding domain and GAL4 activation domain, respectively. SmSmad2–3′ was digested with EcoRI andSalI/XhoI and cloned in pBD-GAL4-cam linearized with EcoRI and pACT2.1 (CLONTECH) and linearized with XhoI to encode fusion proteins of GAL4-BD/SmSmad2–3′and GAL4-AD/SmSmad2–3′, respectively. SmTβR-I (wild type) (5Davies S.J. Shoemaker C.B. Pearce E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11234-11240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) was mutated in its GS domain (284TCSGSGSGKPLLVQRTVARQ303) to attempt to construct both constitutively active and kinase-inactive forms (25Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Massague J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2199-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Three mutants were constructed to form T299D, the expected putative kinase− derivative, Q303D, the constitutively active form, and the double mutant T299D/Q303D. DNA sequence analysis was performed for the mutant forms of SmTβR-I to confirm the mutations. SmTβR-I constructs were digested with EcoRI/SalI and cloned into pBD-GAL4-cam and pAD-GAL4–2.1 vectors linearized with the same enzymes, to generate fusion proteins with GAL4-BD and GAL4-AD, respectively. The two forms of SmSmad2 and the four constructs of SmTβR-I in both BD and AD vectors were transformed individually, into Y190 competent cells using Fast Track Yeast Transformation Kit (Geno Technology, Inc.) as controls to evaluate the ability of these genes to activate host cell reporter gene expression. Transformed cells were plated onto synthetic dextrose medium (SD) supplemented with amino acid dropout solutions lacking either Trp or Trp, His or Leu, or Leu, His for BD vectors and AD vectors, respectively. LacZ filter assay was performed according to Stratagene Two-hybrid instruction manual. To test for an interaction, an AD vector was cotransformed with binding domain vector, and the transformed cells were plated onto SD supplemented with amino acid dropout solutions lacking either Leu, Trp, or Leu, Trp, His. LacZ filter assay was also performed on this transformation series. 3-Amino-1,2,4-triazole, a metabolic inhibitor for histidine biosynthesis, was added to histidine-lacking medium to a final concentration of 25 mm to inhibit the leaky expression of his3 reporter gene. Control plasmids, pGAL4, p53, pLaminC, pSV40, and a combination of p53 + pSV40 and pLaminC + pSV40 (Stratagene) were transformed along with each transformation experiment to provide positive and negative controls. GST pull-down analysis was performed to attempt to confirm the results obtained from the two-hybrid interaction in yeast. In this experiment, the four constructs of SmTβR-I (wt and the three mutants, described above) were subcloned into pCITE-4a vector (Novagen) using appropriate restriction enzymes. Recombinant SmTβR-I-pCITE vectors were expressedin vitro in rabbit reticulocyte lysates with [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using STP-3 transcription/translation system (Novagen) following the supplier's instructions. The regions encoding the SmSmad2 linker and MH2 domain were PCR-amplified (primer pairs bp 488–512 and a complementary sequence of bp 1455–1480, and bp 1424–1448 and a complementary sequence of bp 2045–2068 with SalI site at the 5′-end, respectively). The PCR products were cloned into TOPO-TA vector (Invitrogen) and then subcloned into pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and pET42a (Novagen) prokaryotic expression vectors, respectively. DNA encoding SmSmad2–3′ was also subcloned in pET42a vector. Recombinant prokaryotic expression vectors were overexpressed in bacteria, and the GST fusion proteins were affixed to glutathione-Sepharose beads. Binding reactions, between SmSmad2 proteins (wild type and mutant form) and SmTβR-I in vitrotranslated proteins, were performed by adding 2 μl of the translation reactions to GST fusion protein-coupled beads equivalent to about 2 μg of the fusion protein. The final volume of the reactions was adjusted to 100 μl by adding binding buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.15% Nonidet P-40). The reactions were incubated at room temperature for 1 h and then continued overnight at 4 °C. Glutathione-Sepharose beads were added to facilitate the recovery of the reactive beads, and the samples were precipitated, washed four times, and boiled in 1× SDS loading buffer, and the bound proteins were size-separated in 12% SDS-PAGE. The gels were stained, destained, treated with Entensify (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), dried, and exposed to x-ray film. Developed x-ray films were scanned, and the specific reaction bands were quantified using Molecular Analyst Gel Documentation System (Bio-Rad). Parental pGEX-4T-1 was used to generate recombinant GST, which was affixed to glutathione beads and used to pre-treat the translation reactions to remove the nonspecific background. The equivalent of 2 μg of GST-coupled beads was used to pre-clear the amount of lysate used per reaction. GST beads were also included in the binding reactions to serve as a negative control in the pull-down experiment. To determine whether SmSmad2 can serve as a substrate for SmTβR-I, we examined the ability of SmTβR-I to phosphorylate SmSmad2. In principle, the phosphorylation reactions were performed as outlined above for the pull-down experiment with few differences. Briefly, wild type and mutant forms of SmTβRI were synthesized in vitrousing rabbit reticulocyte lysates and unlabeled methionine. The lysates were pre-cleared with GST-coupled beads as before and then aliquoted into four tubes (each equivalent to 4 μl of original lysate). To each was added GST or a GST fusion protein containing SmSmad2-linker, SmSmad2-MH2, or SmSmad2–3′ coupled to the glutathione-Sepharose beads. Phosphorylation was performed in a 100-μl volume in the presence of 10 μCi of [32P-γ]ATP, for 1 h at room temperature in a buffer similar to the binding buffer (above) except it lacks Nonidet P-40. The beads were collected, washed four times with the reaction buffer, boiled in 1× SDS-loading buffer, and loaded onto 12% SDS-PAGE. The gels were processed as before and subjected to autoradiography. To determine more precisely the phosphorylation sites in Smad2 C-terminal motif, we constructed several mutant forms of SmSmad2-MH2 domain in which the potential phosphorylation sites were mutated to alanine. Four mutant forms were constructed in which Ser649, Ser647, Ser647,649, and Thr646-Ser647,649 were mutated to alanine (TSVA, TAVS, TAVA, and AAVA, respectively). The mutant forms were generated by PCR amplification using oligonucleotides encoding the corresponding mutations. PCR products were cloned in TOPO-TA-pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen), sequenced to confirm the presence of the specific mutations, digested with EcoRI/XhoI, and cloned in pCITE-4a vector (Novagen). Smad2-MH2-wt and SmTβR-I-wt and the mutant forms of both proteins were synthesized in vitrousing unlabeled methionine. Kinase reactions were performed using 5 μl of each SmTβR-I translation reaction and 5 μl of each SmSmad2-MH2 translation reactions in a reaction buffer containing 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Reactions were allowed to proceed for 1 h at room temperature, and then 5 μg of IgG fraction of α-SmSmad2 rabbit antiserum was added to each reaction and incubated for 1 h at room temperature, and the antigen-antibody complexes were precipitated by adding 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunoprecipitates were washed 4 times with 1× phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20, boiled in 1× SDS-loading buffer, and loaded onto 12% SDS-PAGE. The gels were processed as before and subjected to autoradiography. To determine the responsiveness of the SmSmad2 protein to TGF-β1 signal, SmSmad2 cDNA was cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pCMV-GST (kindly provided by Dr. Randall Reed). The pGEX-SmSmad2 vector was digested with BamHI, and the 2.1-kb fragment was inserted in the pCMV-GST vector linearized with the same enzyme. The recombinant transformants were checked for the presence of the insert in the correct orientation by colony PCR using pGEX-fwd primer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as a forward primer and a reverse primer representing the complementary sequence of bp 533–558. DNA sequence of positive samples was determined to confirm the presence of the start ATG codon of SmSmad2 cDNA in frame with the GST sequence. Double CsCl-purified pCMV-GST-SmSmad2, as well as the parent vector pCMV-GST, were used to transfect mink lung epithelial cells (MV1Lu; ATCC CCL-64) employing Effectene transfection reagent ("

We report here that transient coexpression of MDM2 and several p53 hotspot mutants resulted in stabilization and increased expression of MDM2. Ectopic expression of the mutant p53175H allele by recombinant adenovirus infection or stable transfection also stabilized endogenous MDM2 inp53-null cells. A panel of human tumor cell lines expressing different endogenous mutant p53 alleles also contained stabilized nuclear MDM2 at elevated levels when compared withp53-null cells. MDM2 was present in complexes with mutant p53 in tumor cells, and stabilization of MDM2 required direct binding to mutant p53. These results reveal a novel property of mutant p53 and a unique feature of tumors with p53 missense mutations. Accumulation of stable MDM2 may contribute to tumorigenesis through its p53-independent transforming functions. MDM2 is a short-lived protein that regulates p53 degradation.

In normal cells, p53 is present at very low levels because of rapid degradation through the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome pathway. The MDM2 oncoprotein is an important regulator of p53 turnover. Expression of MDM2 is activated by p53 at the transcription level (2Wu X. Bayle J.H. Olson D. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1126-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1625) Google Scholar, 3Barak Y. Juven T.

Therefore, MDM2 functions as a major negative feedback regulator to maintain p53 at low levels and protect cells from growth arrest and apoptosis induced by p53.

Wyllie A.H. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2739-2743PubMed Google Scholar). Although a major consequence of p53 mutation is loss of its tumor suppressor function, maintenance of high level mutant p53 expression during tumor development suggests that it may also have positive effects on cell proliferation. Ectopic expression of several p53 mutants (175H, 248W, 273H,281G) in p53-null cell lines can increase tumorigenic potential and drug resistance (11Dittmer D. Pati S. Zambetti G. Chu S. Teresky A.K. Moore M. Finlay C. Levine A.J. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar, 12Blandino G. Levine A.J. Oren M.

Mutant p53 can also activate the c-myc promoter (281G) and overcome the mitotic spindle checkpoint in normal human fibroblasts (175H, 245D, Refs. 14Frazier M.W. He X. Wang J. Gu Z. Cleveland J.L.

A. 1998; 95: 5166-5171Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that mutant p53 has gain-of-function properties that enhance cell transformation independent of wild-type p53. Mutational analysis suggests that amino acids 22 and 23 of p53, which are essential for transcription activation and MDM2 binding, are also important for the gain-of-function phenotype of the 281G mutant (16Lin J. Teresky A.K. Levine A.J. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2387-2390PubMed Google Scholar). MDM2 is overexpressed in certain tumors with wild-type p53 (17Juven-Gershon T. Oren M. Mol. Med. 1999; 5: 71-83Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that it may contribute to tumor development by inactivation of p53. However, MDM2 also has p53-independent activities that may play a role in malignant transformation. Targeted overexpression of MDM2 in the breast epithelium of p53-null mice can induce abnormal cell proliferation and aneuploidy (18Lundgren K. Montes de Oca, Luna R. McNeill Y.B. Emerick E.P. Spencer B. Barfield C.R. Lozano G. Rosenberg M.P. Finlay CA. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 714-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Transgenic mice expressing 2–4-fold higher levels of MDM2 develop sarcomas at higher frequencies in p53-null backgrounds (19Jones S.N. Hancock A.R. Vogel H. Donehower L.A. Bradley A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15608-15612Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). MDM2 can interact with and inactivate the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor (pRb, Ref. 20Xiao Z. Chen J. Levine A.J. Modjtahedi N. Xing J. Sellers W.R. Livingston D.M. Nature. 1995; 375: 694-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). It can also modulate the activity, stability, and apoptotic function of E2F1/DP1 transcription factors (21Martin K. Trouche D. Hagemeier C. Sorensen T.S. La Thangue N.B. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1995; 375: 691-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 22Loughran O. La, Thangue N.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2186-2197Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 23Blattner C. Sparks A. Lane D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3704-3713Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Furthermore, MDM2 can abrogate the growth arrest function of TGF-β in a p53-independent fashion (24Sun P. Dong P. Dai K. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Science. 1998; 282: 2270-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Therefore, MDM2 can enhance cell transformation by p53-dependent and -independent mechanisms. MDM2 is a transcriptional target of p53 and is often overexpressed in tumors with wild-type p53 because of enhanced transcription and translation (2Wu X. Bayle J.H. Olson D. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1126-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1625) Google Scholar, 25Landers J.E. Haines D.S. Strauss J.F. George D.L. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2745-2750PubMed Google Scholar). MDM2 overexpression also occurs frequently through gene amplification (26Oliner J.D. Kinzler K.W. Meltzer P.S. George D.L. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1992; 358: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1792) Google Scholar, 27Cordon Cardo C. Latres E. Drobnjak M. Oliva M.R. Pollack D. Woodruff J.M. Marechal V. Chen J. Brennan M.F. Levine A.J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 794-799PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the status and function of MDM2 in tumors with mutant p53 is less well characterized. In cells overexpressing MDM2 because of gene amplification, MDM2 is degraded rapidly with a half-life of about 30 min (28Olson D.C. Marechal V. Momand J. Chen J. Romocki C. Levine A.J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2353-2360PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we present direct evidence that MDM2 in tumor cells with high levels of mutant p53 (175H, 241F,248W, 249S, 266E, 273H,273C, and 280K) is stabilized by interaction with p53. Several experimental approaches demonstrate that overexpression of mutant p53 can prevent MDM2 degradation, resulting in the accumulation of MDM2 in tumor cells to moderate levels. These results suggest a novel mechanism of MDM2 stabilization and accumulation. HT1080 (fibrosarcoma, wt p53), SJSA (osteosarcoma, wt p53, MDM2 amplification), C33A (HPV-negative cervical carcinoma, p53273R-C) and DLD-1 (colon carcinoma, p53241S-F) were obtained from the ATCC. H1299 (lung carcinoma, p53null), Saos2 (osteosarcoma, p53-null), MDA-MB-231 (breast carcinoma, p53280R-K), MDA-MB-435 (breast carcinoma, p53266G-E, and MDA468 (breast carcinoma, p53273R-H) were provided by Arnold J. Levine. Adenoviruses expressing wild-type and p53175Hwere provided by Drs. Jiayuh Lin and Bert Vogelstein. H1299 and Saos2 cells were transfected with the pCMV-neo-Bam vector expressing 175Hmutant p53 or human MDM2 cDNA using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. G418-resistant colonies were selected and pooled for further analysis. In transient transfections, each 10-cm dish of H1299 cells was cotransfected with 5 μg of CMV1-MDM2 expression plasmid and 5 μg of mutant CMV-p53 expression plasmid. Expression of MDM2 and p53 were analyzed 36 h after transfection. MG132 was added to 40 μm for 5 h where indicated. Recombinant adenovirus expressing wild-type or mutant p53 were amplified using 293 cells. H1299 and Saos2 cells were infected with diluted crude viral lysate at 200 plaque-forming units/cell. MDM2 protein levels were determined 24 h after addition of viruses. To determine the half-life of MDM2, 75 μg/ml of cyclohexamide was added to the cultures, and samples were collected at different time points for Western blot analysis. Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and 100–200 μg of protein were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. MDM2 and p53 were detected by monoclonal antibody 3G9 (29Chen J. Marechal V. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4107-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar) and DO-1. The filter was developed using ECL-plus reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For immunoprecipitation-Western blot analysis, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell lysate (300–600 μg of protein) was immunoprecipitated using anti-p53 monoclonal antibody Pab421 or anti-MDM2 monoclonal antibody 2A9 and was washed with lysis buffer. Cells cultured on chamber slides were fixed with acetone/methanol (1:1) for 3 min at room temperature, blocked with PBS, 10% normal goat serum (NGS) for 20 min, and incubated with anti-p53 Pab1801 hybridoma supernatant (1:10 dilution) or anti-MDM2 2A9 hybridoma supernatant (1:100 dilution) in PBS, 10% NGS for 2 h. The slides were washed with PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100; incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat-anti-mouse IgG in PBS, 10% NGS for 1 h; washed with PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100; and mounted. Transient cotransfection of wild-type or mutant p53 with MDM2 expression plasmids can result in degradation of p53 (4Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3676) Google Scholar, 5Kubbutat M.H.G. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2824) Google Scholar). In our assay system, a significant excess of MDM2 plasmid (>5-fold of p53) was required to achieve p53 degradation (data not shown). After cotransfection of equal amounts of mutant p53 and MDM2 plasmids intop53-null H1299 cells, p53 was not degraded. However, the levels of MDM2 expression in such transfections were significantly increased (Fig. 1 A, comparelane 3 with lanes 5, 7, 9,13). Among five p53 hotspot mutants tested, the175H mutant showed the strongest ability to increase MDM2 expression and the 273H mutant was the weakest. Quantitation by serial dilution showed that MDM2 expression was induced 8-fold by the 175H mutant and 3-fold by the 273H mutant (data not shown). Mutant p53 had no significant effect on the expression of cotransfected green fluorescent protein GFP (Fig.1 A), suggesting that the increase of MDM2 expression was not because of enhancement of transfection efficiency. To determine whether the increase of MDM2 level was because of stabilization, transfected cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132. The ability of MG132 to induce MDM2 accumulation provides an indication of its degradation rate before treatment. The results show that MG132 caused less dramatic accumulation of MDM2 that was coexpressed with mutant p53 (Fig. 1 A, compare lane 3 and lanes 4, 5, 6). Therefore, higher MDM2 levels observed in the cotransfection with mutant p53 may be caused by stabilization of MDM2. Mutant p53 in these experiments were also highly stable, indicating that they were not degraded by MDM2 at this expression ratio (Fig. 1 A). In MDM2 and wild-type p53 control cotransfection, interpretation of the result was complicated by the fact that wild-type p53 may repress MDM2 plasmid transcription but induce endogenous MDM2. However, MG132 treatment showed that both MDM2 and p53 were unstable, suggesting that the stabilizing effect is unique to mutant p53 (Fig. 1 A). MG132 treatment also caused reduction of GFP expression, possibly because of wild-type p53-mediated cell death. To directly test the stability of MDM2, the p53175H mutant was transiently cotransfected with MDM2 into H1299 cells. The transfected cells were treated with the protein synthesis inhibitor cyclohexamide, and MDM2 levels were accessed by Western blot analysis. In the absence of mutant p53, MDM2 was degraded to near completion 1.5 h after addition of cyclohexamide. In contrast, coexpression with the 175Hmutant brought about a stabilization of MDM2 (Fig. 1 B). However, coexpression of MDM2 with wild-type p53 did not lead to stabilization of MDM2 (Fig. 1 B). This result indicates that high level expression of mutant p53 can overcome the degradation function of MDM2 and stabilize MDM2. To directly test if stabilization of endogenous MDM2 can be induced by mutant p53, H1299 cells were stably transfected with CMV promoter-driven p53175H mutant. Pools of drug-resistant cells were stained using antibodies against p53 and MDM2. Nontransfected H1299 cells have very low levels of MDM2 expression (Fig. 2 A). However, stable transfectants expressing p53 mutant (H1299–175H) expressed increased levels of nuclear MDM2 (Fig. 2 A). The increase in MDM2 level was also confirmed by Western blot analysis (see Fig.4 C). Northern blot analysis was performed to compare the MDM2 mRNA levels in H1299 and H1299–175H cells. The result shows that both cell lines expressed similar levels of MDM2 mRNA (Fig.2 B). This suggests that a change in protein stability is responsible for increased MDM2 level in H1299–175H cells.Figure 4Mutant p53 stabilization of MDM2 requires complex formation. A, Saos2 cells stably transfected with full-length MDM2 or p53 binding-deficient MDM2Δ1–50 were infected with 175H adenovirus for 24 h. MDM2 degradation rates were determined after cyclohexamide (CHX) treatment. B, MDM2 binding-deficient p53 mutant does not stabilize MDM2. H1299 cells were transiently transfected with MDM2 and p5322Q/23S-281G triple mutant, MDM2 stability was determined after cyclohexamide treatment. C, MDM2-mutant p53 complex was detected by immunoprecipitation of 600 μg of protein using p53 antibody Pab421 followed by anti-MDM2 Western blot analysis. Total cell lysate (200 μg of protein) was loaded directly as a control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next, the effect of transiently expressed mutant p53 on endogenous MDM2 level was examined. To achieve uniform expression of mutant p53 in H1299 cells similar to tumor cells with p53 mutations, the cells were infected with a recombinant adenovirus expressing p53175H. This approach can achieve expression of p53 in nearly 100% of the cells, as verified by immunofluorescence staining (data not shown). The level of MDM2 was significantly increased 24 h after infection with the 175H virus but not with a lacZ control virus (Fig. 2 C). To further confirm that the increase in MDM2 level after stable transfection of 175H or infection with the 175Hvirus was due to an increase in stability, the half-life of MDM2 was determined. H1299 cells were infected with adenoviruses expressing wild-type p53 or the 175H mutant for 24 h. MDM2 degradation rate was determined by cyclohexamide treatment. In uninfected H1299 cells, endogenous MDM2 was rapidly degraded after cyclohexamide treatment. MDM2 induced by the wild-type p53 virus was also rapidly degraded with a half-life of ∼0.5 h, although its expression level was much higher because of transcription activation by wild-type p53 (data not shown). In contrast, MDM2 in cells infected with the 175H virus or stably transfected with175H was significantly stabilized, with an estimated half-life of over 2 h (Fig. 2 D). This result indicates that wild-type p53 induces MDM2 accumulation by stimulating transcription of MDM2, whereas mutant p53 induces MDM2 by increasing its stability. Because many human tumors accumulate high levels of mutant p53, it is possible that expression of endogenous mutant p53 is sufficient to cause stabilization and accumulation of MDM2. Immunofluorescence staining of tumor cell lines revealed that in cells with wild-type p53 (such as HT1080, Fig.3 A), the levels of MDM2 expression were often heterogeneous. A small number of cells in a population had stronger staining of p53 and MDM2, possibly because of their spontaneously entering a stressed state. This pattern of MDM2 expression was observed in a panel of over ten cell lines with wild-type p53 (data not shown). The p53-null H1299 cells uniformly express very low levels of MDM2, mainly localized in the nucleoli (Fig. 2 A and data not shown). In contrast, C33A (273C), MDA-MB-231 (280K) and DLD-1 (241F) cells showed uniform and moderate levels of nuclear MDM2 staining (Fig. 3 A and data not shown). This uniform staining pattern was similar to that of mutant p53, which showed high level expression in nearly 100% of the nuclei (Fig. 3 A). This similarity suggests that elevated nuclear MDM2 staining may be causally related to the accumulation of mutant p53 in these cells. It should be noted that although MDM2 staining in p53 mutant cell lines is stronger than in certain p53 wild-type or p53-null cells, it is significantly lower than the levels in cells with MDM2gene amplification, such as SJSA (data not shown). Because increased MDM2 expression can also be caused by factors other than wild-type p53 (such as bFGF and activated ras, Refs.30Shaulian E. Resnitzky D. Shifman O. Blandino G. Amsterdam A. Yayon A. Oren M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2717-2725Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 31Ries S. Biederer C. Woods D. Shifman O. Shirasawa S. Sasazuki T. McMahon M. Oren M. McCormick F. Cell. 2000; 103: 321-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), we directly tested whether MDM2 stabilization occurred in the mutant cell lines. Cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 for 5 h, and the MDM2 levels were detected by Western blot analysis. MG132 treatment of p53-null H1299 or cells with wild-type p53 resulted in a significant increase of MDM2 levels (Fig.3 B). This is consistent with rapid degradation of MDM2 in these cells by proteasomes. In contrast, MDM2 levels in tumor cells with mutant p53 were only weakly induced after MG132 treatment, suggesting that MDM2 was not rapidly degraded by proteasomes in these cells. Densitometry analysis of the films showed that the levels of MDM2 in p53-mutant cells were at least 4-fold higher than in the p53-null H1299 cells, which is consistent with the immunofluorescence staining results. The MDM2 mRNA levels of DLD1 and C33A cells were also similar to that of H1299 (Fig. 2 B), suggesting that mutant p53 induces MDM2 accumulation without stimulating transcription of the MDM2 gene. To further confirm the stabilization of MDM2 in mutant p53 cell lines, MDM2 degradation rates were examined after treatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor cyclohexamide. The half-life of MDM2 in thep53-mutant DLD-1 cells was significantly longer than that in SJSA and HT1080 cells, which express wild-type p53 (Fig.3 C). The half-life of MDM2 in SJSA is ∼0.5 h, whereas in DLD-1 cells it is over 2 h. Using this assay, we also observed stabilization of MDM2 in C33A, MDA468, MDA231, and T47D cells (data not shown). Therefore, MDM2 stabilization may be a common event in tumor cells with mutant p53. MDM2 interacts with the N-terminal domain of p53, and this interaction is not significantly affected by point mutations in the core (DNA binding) domain of p53 (29Chen J. Marechal V. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4107-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). To determine whether p53 core domain mutants induce MDM2 stabilization through complex formation, the effect of 175H virus on the stability of an MDM2 deletion mutant was investigated. In a previous experiment, stable Saos2 cell lines were established that express full-length MDM2 or the p53 binding-deficient Δ1–50 mutant (29Chen J. Marechal V. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4107-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). These cells were infected with 175H virus, and the stability of full-length and Δ1–50 MDM2 mutant were determined. The results show that in contrast to full-length MDM2, the Δ1–50 mutant was not stabilized by175H virus infection (Fig.4 A). In a transient transfection assay using H1299 cells, 175H also did not stabilize a Δ58–89 MDM2 mutant (also deficient for p53 binding, data not shown). In a reciprocal experiment, MDM2 binding-deficient p5322Q/23S-281G triple mutant (Fig.1 C) also failed to stabilize MDM2 in transient transfection of H1299 cells (Ref. 16Lin J. Teresky A.K. Levine A.J. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2387-2390PubMed Google Scholar, Fig. 4 B). These results demonstrate that MDM2 stabilization by mutant p53 requires complex formation. To confirm the presence of the MDM2 mutant p53 complex in cells, lysate from C33A and stable H1299–175H cells were analyzed by anti-p53 Pab421 immunoprecipitation followed by anti-MDM2 Western blotting. Significant amounts of MDM2 were coprecipitated with mutant p53 from the cell lysate (Fig. 4 C). MDM2 in the H1299 lysate was not precipitated by p53 antibody, demonstrating the specificity of the coprecipitation assay. Therefore, stabilized MDM2 is present in complexes with mutant p53. The results described above demonstrate that expression of p53 core domain mutants in tumor cells causes stabilization of MDM2. We found that all five p53 hotspot mutants (175H,248W, 249S, 273H, 281G) showed the ability to stabilize MDM2 in transfection assays using H1299 lung tumor cells (although with different efficiencies). Furthermore, solid tumor cell lines carrying 241F, 266E,273H, 273C, and 280K mutations also have stabilized MDM2. These mutations are located in the evolutionarily conserved regions of p53, which are targeted by most of the mutations found in human tumors (Fig. 1 C). Recently, MDM2 stabilization was also observed in a panel of leukemia cell lines with mutant p53 (32Pan Y. Haines D.S. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2064-2067PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that this is a rather general property of tumor cells with p53 core domain mutations. Our results suggest a mechanism of MDM2 stabilization in such cases. Mutant p53 is degraded by MDM2 if the latter is overexpressed, such as by transfection of exogenous MDM2 (4Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3676) Google Scholar, 5Kubbutat M.H.G. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2824) Google Scholar). However, it is apparent that at the ratio of MDM2 and mutant p53 naturally reached in tumor cell lines, mutant p53 is not efficiently degraded by the endogenous MDM2 but instead causes stabilization of MDM2. It should be emphasized that the ability of mutant p53 to cause MDM2 stabilization does not mean that tumors with p53 mutation will accumulate MDM2 to very high levels. Immunohistochemical staining of tumor samples has revealed cells that overexpress both MDM2 and mutant p53, but this is a relatively rare event (27Cordon Cardo C. Latres E. Drobnjak M. Oliva M.R. Pollack D. Woodruff J.M. Marechal V. Chen J. Brennan M.F. Levine A.J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 794-799PubMed Google Scholar, 33Endo K. Ueda T. Ohta T. Terada T. Liver. 2000; 20: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Our results show that expression of mutant p53 in H1299 cells can increase MDM2 level by several-fold. Such a moderate increase probably will not be defined as overexpression in conventional immunohistochemistry staining of clinical samples. MDM2 expression levels in tumors will also be limited by its transcription and translation rates (both are low in the absence of wild-type p53) and the still unknown threshold of the MDM2/mutant p53 ratio that will trigger p53 degradation. RING finger mutations of MDM2 showed that the ability of MDM2 to promote p53 degradation is tightly linked to its ability to promote self-ubiquitination and degradation (34Fang S. Jensen J.P. Ludwig R.L. Vousden K.H. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8945-8951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar). Therefore, MDM2 stabilization may be caused by loss of its ubiquitin ligase function and may be related to stabilization of mutant p53 in tumors. Because MDM2 stabilization requires direct binding to mutant p53, it is possible that mutant p53 inhibits MDM2 ubiquitination after forming a complex. Mutant p53 may have obtained this capability because of altered structure or interaction with other cellular factors, such as heat shock proteins (35Nagata Y. Anan T. Yoshida T. Mizukami T. Taya Y. Fujiwara T. Kato H. Saya H. Nakao M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6037-6049Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Such a mechanism would suggest that mutant p53 is stabilized in part because of its ability to inactivate low levels of MDM2. A model proposed by Midgley and Lane (36Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1179-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) suggests that mutant p53 is stable because of the loss of MDM2 induction. However, tumor cell lines express readily detectable amounts of MDM2 bound to mutant p53, which may be induced by other transcription mechanisms (31Ries S. Biederer C. Woods D. Shifman O. Shirasawa S. Sasazuki T. McMahon M. Oren M. McCormick F. Cell. 2000; 103: 321-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Therefore, reduction in MDM2 transcription after p53 mutation as well as the ability of mutant p53 to neutralize the function of remaining MDM2 may both contribute to p53 stabilization. Mutant p53 has been shown to exhibit gain-of-function properties in the absence of wild-type p53. Although the precise mechanism of this phenomenon is still not clear, transcription activation and the MDM2-binding domain have been implicated by an experiment using the 22/23–281 triple mutant (16Lin J. Teresky A.K. Levine A.J. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2387-2390PubMed Google Scholar). Our results show that the p5322Q/23S//281G mutant is also deficient in MDM2 stabilization. Therefore, it is possible that MDM2 stabilization also contributes to the tumorigenic activity of mutant p53. MDM2 transgenic mouse experiments have shown that a moderate increase (2–4-fold) of MDM2 expression can significantly increase the incidence of sarcomas in a p53-null background (19Jones S.N. Hancock A.R. Vogel H. Donehower L.A. Bradley A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15608-15612Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Therefore, moderate MDM2 accumulation caused by p53 mutation may have an effect on tumor proliferation. Further experiments will be needed to test this possibility. We would like to thank Thomas Guadagno for critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2062464623,"MRP1 is an ABC (or ATP binding cassette) membrane transport protein shown to confer resistance to structurally dissimilar drugs. Studies of MRP1 topology suggested the presence of a hydrophobic N-domain with five potential membrane-spanning domains linked to an MDR1-like core (MSD1-NBD1-L1-MSD2-NBD2) by an intracellular linker domain (L0). MRP1-mediated multidrug resistance is thought to be due to enhanced drug efflux. However, little is known about MRP1-drug interaction and its drug binding site(s). We previously developed several photoreactive probes to study MRP1-drug interactions. In this report, we have used eight MRP1-HA variants that were modified to have hemagglutinin A (HA) epitopes inserted at different sites in MRP1 sequence. Exhaustive in-gel digestion of all IAARh123 photoaffinity-labeled MRP1-HA variants revealed the same profile of photolabeled peptides as seen for wild type MRP1. Photolabeling of the different MRP1-HA variants followed by digestion with increasing concentrations of trypsin or Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease (1:800 to 1:5 w/w) and immunoprecipitation with anti-HA mAb identified two small photolabeled peptides (∼6–7 kDa) from MRP1-HA(574) and MRP1-HA(1222). Based on the location of the HA epitopes in the latter variants together with molecular masses of the two peptides, the photolabeled amino acid residues were localized to MRP1 sequences encoding transmembranes 10 and 11 of MSD1 (Ser542-Arg593) and transmembranes 16 and 17 of MSD2 (Cys1205-Glu1253). Interestingly, the same sequences in MRP1 were also photolabeled with a structurally different photoreactive drug, IACI, confirming the significance of transmembranes 10, 11, 16 and 17 in MRP1 drug binding. Taken together, the results in this study provide the first delineation of the drug binding site(s) of MRP1. Furthermore, our findings suggest the presence of common drug binding site(s) for structurally dissimilar drugs. MRP1 is an ABC (or ATP binding cassette) membrane transport protein shown to confer resistance to structurally dissimilar drugs. Studies of MRP1 topology suggested the presence of a hydrophobic N-domain with five potential membrane-spanning domains linked to an MDR1-like core (MSD1-NBD1-L1-MSD2-NBD2) by an intracellular linker domain (L0). MRP1-mediated multidrug resistance is thought to be due to enhanced drug efflux. However, little is known about MRP1-drug interaction and its drug binding site(s). We previously developed several photoreactive probes to study MRP1-drug interactions. In this report, we have used eight MRP1-HA variants that were modified to have hemagglutinin A (HA) epitopes inserted at different sites in MRP1 sequence. Exhaustive in-gel digestion of all IAARh123 photoaffinity-labeled MRP1-HA variants revealed the same profile of photolabeled peptides as seen for wild type MRP1. Photolabeling of the different MRP1-HA variants followed by digestion with increasing concentrations of trypsin or Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease (1:800 to 1:5 w/w) and immunoprecipitation with anti-HA mAb identified two small photolabeled peptides (∼6–7 kDa) from MRP1-HA(574) and MRP1-HA(1222). Based on the location of the HA epitopes in the latter variants together with molecular masses of the two peptides, the photolabeled amino acid residues were localized to MRP1 sequences encoding transmembranes 10 and 11 of MSD1 (Ser542-Arg593) and transmembranes 16 and 17 of MSD2 (Cys1205-Glu1253). Interestingly, the same sequences in MRP1 were also photolabeled with a structurally different photoreactive drug, IACI, confirming the significance of transmembranes 10, 11, 16 and 17 in MRP1 drug binding. Taken together, the results in this study provide the first delineation of the drug binding site(s) of MRP1. Furthermore, our findings suggest the presence of common drug binding site(s) for structurally dissimilar drugs. Increased expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp1)1 or the multidrug resistance protein (MRP1) has been associated with the rise of drug resistance in numerous tumor cell lines in vitro (1Bradley G. Ling V. Cancer Metastasis Rev... 1994; 13: 223-233Google Scholar, 2Cole S. Deeley R. Bioessays.. 1998; 20: 931-940Google Scholar). Gene transfer studies have also provided direct correlation between P-gp1 or MRP1 expression and resistance to dissimilar anti-cancer drugs; hence, the multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype. In addition, gene disruption studies (3Schinkel A.H. Smit J.J.M. van Tellingen O. Beijnen J.H. Wagenaar E. van Deemter L. Mol C.A.A.M. var der Valk M.A. Robanus-Maandag E.C. te Riele H.P.J.

Interestingly and despite the low level of sequence identity between MRP1 and P-gp1 (<20% (5Cole S.P.C. Bharswaj G. Gerlach J.H. Mackie J.E. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C. Stewart A.J. Kurz E.U. Duncan A.M.V. Deeley R.G. Science.. 1992; 258: 1650-1654Google Scholar)), the two proteins confer resistance to similar natural product anti-cancer drugs (6Zaman G.J.R. Borst P. Gupta S. Tsuruo T. Multidrug Resistance in Cancer Cells.John Wiley & Sons, Inc. 1996; : 95-107Google Scholar). However in contrast to P-gp1, a distinguishing feature of MRP1 endogenous and exogenous substrates is their derivatization by glutathione, glucuronate, or sulfate (7Evers R. Cnubben N.H. Wijnholds J. van Deemter L. van Bladeren P.J. Borst P. FEBS Lett... 1997; 419: 112-116Google Scholar, 8Jedlitschky G. Leier I. Buchholz U. Barnouin K. Kurz G. Keppler D.

Biochemistry.. 1996; 35: 5719-5726Google Scholar). Notably, the cysteinyl leukotriene LTC4 is the highest affinity substrate and an important modulator of inflammatory response (9Leier I. Jedlitschky G. Buchholz U. Cole S.P. Deeley R.G. Keppler D. J. Biol. Chem... 1994; 269: 27807-27810Google Scholar). Other endogenous substrates include glucuronate- and sulfate-conjugated bile salts, glutathione-conjugated prostaglandin A2, as well as oxidized glutathione (GSSG) (8Jedlitschky G. Leier I. Buchholz U. Barnouin K. Kurz G. Keppler D. Cancer Res... 1996; 56: 988-994Google Scholar, 12Ishikawa T. Trends Biochem. Sci... 1992; 17: 463-468Google Scholar, 13Leier I. Jedlitschky G. Buchholz U. Center M. Cole S. Deeley R. Keppler D. Biochem. J... 1996; 314: 433-437Google Scholar). P-gp1 and MRP1 are members of the ABC (or ATP binding cassette) family of membrane transport proteins (14Klein I. Sarkadi B. Varadi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1999; 1461: 237-262Google Scholar) that couple the hydrolysis of ATP to drug transport. Members of this family contain one or more blocks of six membrane-spanning domains (MSD) linked to a nucleotide binding domain (NBD) (14Klein I. Sarkadi B. Varadi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1999; 1461: 237-262Google Scholar). In contrast to P-gp1, MRP1 encodes for an additional hydrophobic N-domain with five potential transmembrane sequences (MSD0) and an extracytoplasmic N terminus (15Bakos E. Hegedus T. Hollo Z. Welker E. Tusnady G.E. Zaman G.J. Flens M.J. Varadi A. Sarkadi B. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 12322-12326Google Scholar, 16Hipfner D.R. Almquist K.C. Leslie E.M. Gerlach J.H. Grant C.E. Deeley R.G.

Biochemistry.. 1999; 38: 5124-5129Google Scholar). Consequently, the linear organization of MRP1 consists of MSD0 linked to an MDR1-like core (MSD1-NBD1-L1-MSD2-NBD2) through an intracytoplasmic linker domain (L0). Functional analyses of truncated MRP1 demonstrate that deletion of the L0 domain abolished MRP1-mediated LTC4 transport, whereas deletion of the MSD0 while maintaining L0 behaved as the full-length protein (19Bakos E. Evers R. Szakacs G. Tusnady G.E. Welker E. Szabo K. de Hass M. van Deemter L. Borst P. Varadi A. Sarkadi B. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 32167-32175Google Scholar, 20Gao M. Yamazaki M. Loe D. Westlake C. Grant C. Cole S. Deeley R. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 10733-10740Google Scholar). The mechanism of MRP1-mediated transport is not well understood and appears to differ from that of P-gp1. Drug transport studies using P-gp1-expressing plasma membranes clearly demonstrate an energy-dependent transport through direct binding to P-gp1 (21Shapiro A. Ling V. Acta Physiol. Scand. Suppl... 1998; 643: 227-234Google Scholar). Likewise, MRP1-mediated transport of LTC4 is energy-dependent and likely to occur by direct binding to MRP1 (22Rao U.S. Scarborough G.A. Mol. Pharmacol... 1994; 45: 773-776Google Scholar). However, transport of unmodified natural product drugs by MRP1 has been shown to occur in association with glutathione (23Loe D.W. Almquist K.C. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 9675-9682Google Scholar, 24Loe D. Deeley R. Cole S. Cancer Res... 1998; 58: 5130-5136Google Scholar, 25Rappa G. Lorico A. Flavell R.A.

Using several MRP1-specific photoreactive drugs, we have demonstrated direct binding between MRP1 and unmodified natural product drugs (27Daoud R. Desneves J. Deady L.W. Tilley L. Scheper R.J. Gros P. Georges E. Biochemistry.. 2000; 39: 6094-6102Google Scholar, 28Daoud R. Kast K. Gros P. Georges E. Biochemistry.. 2000; 39: 15344-15352Google Scholar, 29Vezmar M. Georges E. Biochem.

Pharmacol... 2000; 59: 1245-1252Google Scholar). Moreover, glutathione was not required for MRP1-drug interaction. In addition, proteolysis of IACI- or IAARh123-photolabeled MRP1 produced three small peptides (27Daoud R. Desneves J. Deady L.W. Tilley L. Scheper R.J. Gros P. Georges E. Biochemistry.. 2000; 39: 6094-6102Google Scholar, 28Daoud R. Kast K. Gros P. Georges E. Biochemistry.. 2000; 39: 15344-15352Google Scholar). In this report, we have mapped the drug binding site(s) of MRP1. To achieve this, we made use of eight MRP1 variants containing hemagglutinin A (HA) epitopes inserted at different positions in MRP1 (17Kast C. Gros P. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 26479-26487Google Scholar, 32Kast C. Gros P. Biochemistry.. 1998; 37: 2305-2313Google Scholar). Our results show for the first time the presence of two major drug binding domains, confined to ∼50 amino acids each and encoding TMs 10–11 and TMs 16–17. Iodine-125 (100.7 mCi/ml) and the Protein A-coupled Sepharose were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The monoclonal anti-hemagglutinin A antibody 16B12 (anti-HA) was from the Berkeley Antibody Co. (Richmond, California). All chemicals were of the highest commercial grade available. HeLa cells transfected with vector alone or MRP1-HA cDNA variants (17Kast C. Gros P. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 26479-26487Google Scholar, 32Kast C. Gros P. Biochemistry.. 1998; 37: 2305-2313Google Scholar) were used in this study. HeLa-MRP1-HA variants describe cells expressing MRP1 containing one or more copies of hemagglutinin A epitope (YPYDVPDYAS) inserted at amino acids 4, 163, 271, 574, 653, 938, 1001, or 1222 from the N terminus of MRP1 (see Fig. 1). Briefly, cells were grown in α-minimal essential medium (αMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). Cells were detached with trypsin-EDTA and then mixed immediately with cell culture media containing 20% horse serum followed by several washes in phosphate-buffered saline solution, pH 7.4. The cell pellets were resuspended in hypotonic Tris-Mg2+ buffer (1 mmMgCl2 and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0) containing protease inhibitors (2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A) and homogenized in a glass Dounce homogenizer. The resulting cell homogenate was spun for 10 min at 400 ×g, and the resulting supernatant was spun for an additional 60 min at 100,000 × g. Plasma membrane-enriched pellets were resuspended in 5 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, and washed once to remove residual protease inhibitors. The final membrane pellets were resuspended in Tris-sucrose buffer (5 mm Tris, 250 mm sucrose, pH 7.4) using a 27-gauge needle and separated into aliquots for storage at −70 °C. Proteins were quantified using the Lowry assay (33Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem... 1951; 193: 265-275Google Scholar). Plasma membranes from HeLa or HeLa-MRP1-HA variants were photoaffinity-labeled with IAARh123 or IACI photoreactive drugs as previously described (27Daoud R. Desneves J. Deady L.W. Tilley L. Scheper R.J. Gros P. Georges E. Biochemistry.. 2000; 39: 6094-6102Google Scholar,28Daoud R. Kast K. Gros P. Georges E. Biochemistry.. 2000; 39: 15344-15352Google Scholar). Photolabeled MRP1-HA variants were excised from SDS-PAGE and processed for in-gel digestion with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease (20 μg/gel slice) according to the method of Clevelandet al. (34Cleveland D.W. Fischer S.G. Kirschner M.W. Laemmli U.K. J. Biol. Chem... 1977; 252: 1102-1106Google Scholar). Alternatively, 100-μg aliquots of photolabeled plasma membranes were digested with increasing concentrations of trypsin (sequencing grade and TPKC (l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone)-treated from Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 37 °C for 40 min. After digestion, samples were transferred to ice, and the digestion was stopped by the addition of 80 μl of buffer A (1% SDS, 0.05m Tris, pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml leupeptin, pepstatin A, aprotinin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Samples were left on ice for 15 min and then diluted with 320 μl of buffer B (1.25% Triton X-100, 190 mm NaCl, 0.05 m Tris, pH 7.4). IAARh123- or IACI-photolabeled MRP1-HA was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA mAb as previously described (35Georges E. Zhang J.-T. Ling L. J. Cell. Physiol... 1991; 148: 479-484Google Scholar). Protein samples were resolved on SDS-PAGE using the Fairbanks gel system (36Fairbanks G. Steck T.L. Wallach D.F.H. Biochemistry.. 1971; 10: 2606-2617Google Scholar). Radiolabeled proteins were visualized on dried gels after exposure to Kodak X-AR film at −80 °C. For immuno-detection of recombinant MRP1-HA variants, 20-μg samples of enriched plasma membranes were resolved on SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane by using a wet electroblotting technique essentially as outlined by Towbin et al. (37Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A... 1979; 76: 4350-4354Google Scholar). Nitrocellulose membranes were blocked in 5% skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline solution (pH 7.4) and incubated with anti-HA mAb overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were washed and incubated with 1:3000 (v/v) of goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence using Pierce SuperSignal substrate. Tumor cells overexpressing MRP1 show reduced sensitivity to natural product toxins and certain anti-cancer drugs likely due to enhanced drug clearance (2Cole S. Deeley R. Bioessays.. 1998; 20: 931-940Google Scholar). However, little is known about MRP1-drug interaction and binding site(s). Using photoreactive drug analogues, we have recently demonstrated the photoaffinity labeling of MRP1 at multiple sites (27Daoud R. Desneves J. Deady L.W. Tilley L. Scheper R.J. Gros P. Georges E. Biochemistry.. 2000; 39: 6094-6102Google Scholar, 28Daoud R. Kast K. Gros P. Georges E. Biochemistry.. 2000; 39: 15344-15352Google Scholar). In this study, eight different MRP1-HA variants (see Fig. 1) were used to identify the sequences of MRP1 drug binding site(s). The expression and characterization of all eight MRP1-HA variants have been previously described (17Kast C. Gros P. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 26479-26487Google Scholar, 32Kast C. Gros P. Biochemistry.. 1998; 37: 2305-2313Google Scholar), and their function was determined to be similar to wild type or unmodified MRP1. Fig.2 A shows a Western blot analysis of membranes from untransfected and MRP1-HA-transfected HeLa cells probed with anti-HA mAb. With the exception of the MRP1-HA (574), all other MRP1-HA variants showed high levels of MRP1 (Fig.2 A). To determine whether IAARh123 could photolabel the MRP1-HA variants, plasma membranes were labeled with IAARh123, and proteins were either resolved on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 B) or used for immunoprecipitation with anti-HA mAb (Fig. 2 C). Fig.2 B shows an IAARh123-photolabeled ∼190-kDa polypeptide in all 8 membrane samples. Moreover, Fig. 2 C confirms the identity of the labeled protein as MRP1. The lower photoaffinity labeling signal associated with MRP1-HA (574) is consistent with the low level of expression seen in plasma membranes from cells expressing this variant (Fig. 2 A). To determine whether the insertion of HA epitopes at different positions in MRP1 has affected the binding domains relative to unmodified MRP1, immunopurified IAARh123-photolabeled MRP1-HA variants were excised from SDS-PAGE gels and digested with S. aureus V8 protease according to the method of Cleveland et al. (34Cleveland D.W. Fischer S.G. Kirschner M.W. Laemmli U.K. J. Biol. Chem... 1977; 252: 1102-1106Google Scholar). The results in Fig.2 D show the same digestion profile for the labeled MRP1-HA variants; hence, the insertion of HA epitopes in MRP1 at the specified positions (Fig. 1) did not affect its drug interaction. Moreover, the lack of effect of HA epitope insertion on photolabeling characteristics of MRP1 is in agreement with the lack of effect of HA epitope insertion on the drug resistance profile in transfectant HeLa cells (17Kast C. Gros P. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 26479-26487Google Scholar, 32Kast C. Gros P. Biochemistry.. 1998; 37: 2305-2313Google Scholar). In addition, similar results were also obtained using the quinoline-derived photoreactive drug, IACI (results not shown). We have recently shown that MRP1 is photoaffinity-labeled at multiple sites with two structurally dissimilar drugs (27Daoud R. Desneves J. Deady L.W. Tilley L. Scheper R.J. Gros P. Georges E. Biochemistry.. 2000; 39: 6094-6102Google Scholar, 28Daoud R. Kast K. Gros P. Georges E. Biochemistry.. 2000; 39: 15344-15352Google Scholar). Mild proteolytic cleavage of MRP1 with trypsin generated 111- and 85-kDa photoaffinity-labeled polypeptides that, respectively, produced two and one small photolabeled peptides upon further digestion (27Daoud R. Desneves J. Deady L.W. Tilley L. Scheper R.J. Gros P. Georges E. Biochemistry.. 2000; 39: 6094-6102Google Scholar, 28Daoud R. Kast K. Gros P. Georges E. Biochemistry.. 2000; 39: 15344-15352Google Scholar). To achieve a higher resolution map of MRP1 photoaffinity-labeled sites, plasma membranes from each of the eight MRP1-HA variants were photoaffinity-labeled, digested with increasing concentrations of trypsin (1:800–1:5 w/w), and then immunoprecipitated with anti-HA mAb. Only those polypeptides having an HA epitope and a cross-linked IAARh123 were utilized in the analyses of MRP1 binding domains. Fig.3 shows the results of three MRP1-HA variants in which HA epitopes are inserted at positions 4, 163, and 271 from the N terminus of MRP1. Resolution of anti-HA-immunoprecipitated tryptic digest showed one polypeptide with a molecular mass of 111 kDa from MRP1-HA(4), -HA(163), and -HA(271) (Figs. 3, A–C). Hence, only the 111-kDa fragment contained the IAARh123-labeled amino acid residue(s) and either one of the three HA epitopes. The schematic in Fig. 3 D shows the three HA epitopes relative to the trypsin sensitive site in the linker domain (L1). Further digestion of the 111-kDa polypeptide with trypsin led to the loss of the IAARh123-photolabeled residue(s) or the HA-epitopes. The 50-kDa photolabeled protein is nonspecifically immunoprecipitated and appears in all the lanes from HeLa and HeLa-HA variants (Fig. 3). Although identity of this 50-kDa photolabeled protein is not known, comparison of photolabeled MRP1 and 50-kDa proteins by Cleveland digestion (34Cleveland D.W. Fischer S.G. Kirschner M.W. Laemmli U.K. J. Biol. Chem... 1977; 252: 1102-1106Google Scholar) did not reveal similar photolabeled peptides or peptide maps (results not shown). Interestingly, however, the 50-kDa protein was much less apparent when the IAARh123-photolabeled membranes immunoprecipitated with hybridoma supernatant containing anti-HA mAb was isolated from cells grown in absence of 10% fetal bovine serum. Thus, the presence of serum proteins is likely to be responsible for the nonspecific immunoprecipitation of the 50-kDa protein (results not shown). Analysis of MRP1-HA variants that have HA epitopes inserted at positions 574 or 653 from the N terminus is shown in Fig.4. Proteolytic digestion of IAARh123-photolabeled membranes with increasing concentrations of trypsin generated five and three photoaffinity-labeled peptides with MRP1-HA (574) and -HA (653), respectively (Figs. 4, A andB). For MRP1-HA (574), five polypeptides with approximate molecular masses of 111, 44, 31, 23, and 6.5 kDa contained both IAARh123 photolabel and the HA epitope. Again, relative to the trypsin-sensitive site in L1 linker domain, the 111-kDa photolabeled polypeptide encodes sequences that include MSD0, L0, MSD1, and NBD1 as indicated on the schematic in Fig. 4 C. This polypeptide is rapidly degraded to four smaller peptides with apparent molecular masses of 44, 31, 23, and 6.5 kDa, representing sequences between the two trypsin-sensitive sites in L0 and L1 linker domains (Fig.4 C). The 44- and 31-kDa IAARh123-photolabeled peptides were immunoprecipitated from the digestion products of both MRP1-HA (574) and -HA (653) variants. Thus, a maximum region of ∼280 amino acid residues contains either HA (574) or HA (653) epitopes as well as the IAARh123-labeled site(s). Interestingly, further digestion of MRP1-HA (574) but not MRP1-HA (653), revealed the presence of two smaller photoaffinity-labeled peptides (23 and 6.5 kDa; Fig. 4 A). The immunoprecipitation of a ∼6.5-kDa photolabeled peptide from MRP1-HA (574), but not from MRP1-HA (653), positions the peptide between Lys541 (Ser542) and Arg593, before the HA epitope at amino acid 653. Consequently, the first IAARh123-photolabeled polypeptide encodes 51 amino acids of MRP1 (Ser542–Arg593) plus 10 amino acid residues from the HA-epitope at position 574 of MRP1 (see Fig. 1). Using three other MRP1-HA variants (938, 1001, and 1222) in which the HA epitopes are localized between the trypsin-sensitive site in L1 and the C terminus of MRP1, plasma membranes were photoaffinity-labeled with IAARh123, treated with trypsin, and immunoprecipitated with anti-HA mAb. The results in Fig. 5,A–C, show two IAARh123-labeled polypeptides immunoprecipitated from MRP1-HA (938), -HA (1001), and -HA (1222) tryptic digests migrating with apparent molecular masses of ∼130 and 85 kDa. The 85-kDa IAARh123-photolabeled polypeptide has been previously identified by using epitope-specific mAbs (QRCL-1 and MRPm6 (27Daoud R. Desneves J. Deady L.W. Tilley L. Scheper R.J. Gros P. Georges E. Biochemistry.. 2000; 39: 6094-6102Google Scholar, 28Daoud R. Kast K. Gros P. Georges E. Biochemistry.. 2000; 39: 15344-15352Google Scholar)) and encodes MRP1 sequences immediately after the trypsin-sensitive site in L1 (see schematic in Fig. 5 D). The 130-kDa polypeptide represents a cleavage of MRP1 at L0, the second trypsin-sensitive site (38Hipfner D. Almquist K. Stride B. Deeley R. Cole S. Cancer Res... 1996; 56: 3307-3314Google Scholar), and encodes the MDR1-like core (MSD1-NBD1-L1-MSD2-NBD2; see schematic in Fig. 5 D). It should be mentioned that the same 130-kDa IAARh123-photolabeled polypeptide is observed after immunoprecipitation of tryptic digests from MRP1-HA (574) and -HA (653) but not from MRP1-HA (4Wijnholds J. Evers R. van Leusden M.R. Mol C.A. Zaman G.J. Mayer U. Beijnen J.H. van der Valk M. Krimpenfort P. Borst P. Nat. Med... 1997; 3: 1275-1279Google Scholar), -HA (163), and -HA (271) variants (Figs. 3 and 4). In contrast to MRP1-HA (938) and -HA (1001), immunoprecipitation of MRP1-HA (1222) digest showed four IAARh123 photoaffinity-labeled peptides (Fig. 5): the 130- and 85-kDa polypeptides plus two additional peptides migrating with molecular masses of 41 and 7 kDa (Fig. 5 C). The 41-kDa photoaffinity-labeled polypeptide encoded MRP1 sequences beyond the 1001 epitope insertion site and is equivalent to ∼370 amino acids toward the C-terminal end of MRP1 (see schematic representation in Fig.5 D). The 7-kDa polypeptide represents the smallest photolabeled peptide that can be immunoprecipitated from the tryptic digest of IAARh123 photoaffinity-labeled MRP1-HA (1222) (Fig.5 C). Consequently, the second IAARh123-photolabeled polypeptide contains sequences between Leu1203 and Arg1249 of MRP1 (plus 20 amino acid residues of 2 HA-epitopes at position 1222). To ascertain the positions of the IAARh123-photolabeled peptides of MRP1-HA (574) and -HA (1222) more closely, photolabeled membrane samples were digested with higher concentrations of trypsin or S. aureus V8 protease (up to 1:5 w/w), and the total digest was subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA mAb. Fig.6 A shows a photolabeled peptide derived from the exhaustive digestion of MRP1-HA (574) with trypsin, migrating with an apparent molecular mass of a ∼6.5 kDa. Careful examination of MRP1 amino acid sequence for the smallest possible tryptic peptide that include the HA epitope at position 574 revealed the following peptide sequence542SAYLSAVGTFTWVCTPFLVALCTFAVYVTIDEN[HA]NILDAQTAFV SLALFNILR593, where the underlined sequences represent the predicted TM10 and TM11. The calculated molecular mass of the photoaffinity-labeled peptide, including the amino acid sequence of one HA epitopes, is 6.8 kDa. Exhaustive digestion of IAARh123-photolabeled MRP1-HA (574) variants with V8 protease followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-HA mAb did not show any other photolabeled small peptides (data not shown). Similarly, exhaustive digestion of IAARh123-photolabeled membranes of MRP1-HA (1222) with V8 protease revealed the presence of a ∼7-kDa photolabeled peptide (Fig. 6 B). Analysis of MRP1 sequence for all possible V8 peptides that include the HA epitope at position 1222, revealed the following amino acid sequence1205CVGNCIVLFAALFAVISR[HA-HA]HSLSAGLVGLSVSYSLQVTTYLNWLVRMSSE1253, where the underlined sequences represent the predicted TM16 and TM17. The calculated molecular mass of this peptide including the amino acid sequence of the two HA epitopes is ∼7.6 kDa. As indicated earlier, we have recently demonstrated that both IAARh123 and IACI, two structurally dissimilar photoreactive drugs, labeled similar tryptic peptides that migrate with apparent molecular masses of 4–6 kDa on SDS-PAGE (27Daoud R. Desneves J. Deady L.W. Tilley L. Scheper R.J. Gros P. Georges E. Biochemistry.. 2000; 39: 6094-6102Google Scholar, 28Daoud R. Kast K. Gros P. Georges E. Biochemistry.. 2000; 39: 15344-15352Google Scholar). Given the localization of IAARh23 drug binding sites in MRP1, it was of interest to determine the IACI-photolabeled sequences using the MRP1-HA variants. Fig.7 shows immunopurified peptides from IACI-labeled MRP1-HA (574) and -HA (1222) after digestion with trypsin and V8 protease, respectively. Interestingly, Fig. 7 A shows a ∼6.5-kDa IACI-photolabeled peptide immunoprecipitated from MRP1-HA (574) tryptic digest. Likewise, MRP1-HA (1222) showed an ∼7-kDa IACI-photolabeled peptide (Fig. 7 B). Digestion of IACI-photolabeled plasma membranes prepared from the other MRP1-HA variants led to identical photolabeled peptides as IAARh123 (data not shown). Taken together these results demonstrate the binding of two structurally dissimilar drugs to the same site(s) of MRP1. Similar to P-gp1, MRP1 is believed to cause resistance to anti-cancer drugs through an enhanced drug clearance mechanism (39Hipfner D.R. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1999; 1461: 359-376Google Scholar). Indeed, there is considerable overlap in substrate specificity to anti-cancer drugs between MRP1 and P-gp1 (39Hipfner D.R. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1999; 1461: 359-376Google Scholar). However, MRP1 also mediates the transport of other normal cell metabolites such as glutathione-, sulfate-, and glucuronate-modified ligands. Furthermore, given the structural differences between MRP1 and P-gp1 and the low sequence identity (<20% (5Cole S.P.C. Bharswaj G. Gerlach J.H. Mackie J.E. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C. Stewart A.J. Kurz E.U. Duncan A.M.V. Deeley R.G. Science.. 1992; 258: 1650-1654Google Scholar)), it has been difficult to speculate about the mechanism of MRP1 based on the current understanding of P-gp1-mediated drug transport. For example, unlike P-gp1, it has not been possible to demonstrate direct binding between MRP1 and unmodified natural product drugs, likely due to low binding affinities. Moreover, it remains unclear how reduced glutathione mediates MRP1 drug transport. Using a quinoline-based photoreactive drug, we have previously shown direct interaction between MRP1 and natural product drugs (29Vezmar M. Georges E. Biochem. Pharmacol... 1998; 56: 733-742Google Scholar, 30Vezmar M. Deady L.W. Tilley L. Georges E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun... 1997; 241: 104-111Google Scholar, 31Vezmar M. Georges E. Biochem. Pharmacol... 2000; 59: 1245-1252Google Scholar). Consistent with our findings, Leier et al. (9Leier I. Jedlitschky G. Buchholz U. Cole S.P. Deeley R.G. Keppler D. J. Biol. Chem... 1994; 269: 27807-27810Google Scholar) also show direct photolabeling of MRP1 by [3H]LTC4. Although it has not been possible to determine which domain(s) in MRP1 interacts directly with LTC4. Analyses of the first three MRP1-HA(4, 163, and 271) variants using IACI and IAARh123 revealed the presence of only one photolabeled polypeptide with an apparent molecular mass of 111 kDa. Further digestion of the 111-kDa fragment, which contained three HA epitopes at positions 4, 163, or 271 from the N terminus did not produce smaller photolabeled peptides. Therefore, the MRP1 sequence within the first 274 amino acid residues (relative to the position of the first lysine located right after the HA epitope insertion at position 271) are not photolabeled with IAARh123 or IACI. Alternatively, it is possible that the first 274 amino acid residues of MRP1 are photoaffinity-labeled; however, after the addition of higher trypsin concentrations, the photolabeled site was separated from the HA epitope. Although this latter possibility is conceivable with one HA epitope, it is unlikely to occur with all HA epitopes inserted at three different positions in MRP1 (at amino acids 4, 163, and 271 from the N terminus). Moreover, we and others previously demonstrated the presence of two trypsin hypersensitive sites, one in each of the linker domains (L1 and L0) of MRP1, with cleavage at L1 proceeding that at L0 (27Daoud R. Desneves J. Deady L.W. Tilley L. Scheper R.J. Gros P. Georges E. Biochemistry.. 2000; 39: 6094-6102Google Scholar, 28Daoud R. Kast K. Gros P. Georges E. Biochemistry.. 2000; 39: 15344-15352Google Scholar, 38Hipfner D. Almquist K. Stride B. Deeley R. Cole S. Cancer Res... 1996; 56: 3307-3314Google Scholar). Consequently, cleavage at L1 would generate the 111- and 85-kDa polypeptides followed by a cleavage of the 111-kDa at L0 producing two polypeptides with apparent molecular masses of 40–60 and 60 kDa (16Hipfner D.R. Almquist K.C. Leslie E.M. Gerlach J.H. Grant C.E. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 23623-23630Google Scholar). The 40–60-kDa fragment would include MSD0, whereas the 60-kDa fragment would include MSD1 (16Hipfner D.R. Almquist K.C. Leslie E.M. Gerlach J.H. Grant C.E. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 23623-23630Google Scholar). The absence of photolabeled 40–60-kDa polypeptides with either one of the three MRP1-HA (4Wijnholds J. Evers R. van Leusden M.R. Mol C.A. Zaman G.J. Mayer U. Beijnen J.H. van der Valk M. Krimpenfort P. Borst P. Nat. Med... 1997; 3: 1275-1279Google Scholar, 163, 271) variants is consistent with the lack of drug interactions within the first 274 N-terminal amino acids. These results are consistent with earlier findings whereby deletion of the first N-terminal 203 amino acids behaved like wild-type MRP1 in vesicle uptake of LTC4(19Bakos E. Evers R. Szakacs G. Tusnady G.E. Welker E. Szabo K. de Hass M. van Deemter L. Borst P. Varadi A. Sarkadi B. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 32167-32175Google Scholar). Having previously demonstrated that IACI and IAARh123 interacts with MRP1 at the same or an overlapping site(s) as that of LTC4, we speculate that MSD0 does not interact with either drug. Similar analyses of the other five MRP1-HA (574, 653, 938, 1001, 1222) variants revealed two photolabeled peptides with apparent molecular masses of 6.5 and 7 kDa, derived from MRP1-HA (574) and -HA (1222), respectively. Proteolytic cleavage at L0 of MRP1-HA (574, 653, 938, 1001, 1222) variants produced a common polypeptide with a molecular mass of 130 kDa, consisting of MSD1-NBD1-L1-MSD2-NBD2 (Fig. 1). Cleavage at L1 produced the 111- and 85-kDa fragments form MRP1-HA (574, 653) and MRP1-HA (938, 1001, 1222), respectively. In addition, further proteolytic digestion of MRP1-HA (653) produced two smaller photolabeled peptides (44 and 31 kDa), which encode for MSD1 and some parts of NBD1 (Fig. 4 B). In contrast to MRP1-HA (653), similar proteolytic cleavage of MRP1-HA (574) produced two additional photolabeled peptides (23 and 6.5 kDa) that encode TMs 8–11 and TM10–11, respectively. Digestion of MRP1-HA (574) with higher concentrations of trypsin did not result in further cleavage of the 6.5-kDa peptide. Analysis of MRP1 sequence for all potential trypsin cleavage sites near the HA epitope inserted at position 574 of MRP1 revealed the presence of Lys541 and Arg593. Thus cleavage at these positions would produce a 62-amino acid peptide, taking into consideration the 10 residues from the HA insertion (see schematic diagram in Fig. 5 C). Earlier in-gel digestion studies of IACI- or IAARh123-photolabeled 111-kDa fragments, which encodes MSD0-L0-MSD1-NBD1 and parts of L1, showed two photolabeled peptides with apparent molecular masses of ∼6 and ∼4 kDa (27Daoud R. Desneves J. Deady L.W. Tilley L. Scheper R.J. Gros P. Georges E. Biochemistry.. 2000; 39: 6094-6102Google Scholar, 28Daoud R. Kast K. Gros P. Georges E. Biochemistry.. 2000; 39: 15344-15352Google Scholar). Based on the observed results with MRP1-HA (4Wijnholds J. Evers R. van Leusden M.R. Mol C.A. Zaman G.J. Mayer U. Beijnen J.H. van der Valk M. Krimpenfort P. Borst P. Nat. Med... 1997; 3: 1275-1279Google Scholar, 163, 271, 574, 653), which yielded only one photolabeled peptide containing the HA epitope at position 574, the previously observed photolabeled peptides (4 and 6 kDa) may represent incomplete digestion of the photolabeled fragment (Leu536–Glu623) at internal V8 protease cuts at Asp572 or Asp578. Thus, V8 protease cuts at Asp572 or Asp578 would produce a fragment with an estimated molecular mass of ∼4 kDa (Leu536 to Asp572/Asp578 or Asp572/Asp578 to Glu623) in addition to an ∼6-kDa fragment representing Leu536–Glu623. Tryptic digestion of MRP1-HA (1222), by contrast to MRP1-HA(938 and 1001), produced two photolabeled peptides (41 and 7 kDa) in addition to the 85-kDa polypeptide (Fig. 5). The 41-kDa photolabeled peptide did not contain the first 1013 N-terminal amino acid residues of MRP1 (relative to the position of the first lysine located right after the HA epitope insertion at position 1001) and is likely to encode part of the MSD2 and NBD2. The second smallest photolabeled peptide produced from the total cleavage of the MRP1-HA (1001) is likely to encode the last two transmembrane domains of MSD2. Analysis of MRP1 amino acid sequence for potential trypsin cuts near the 1222 HA epitope showed three potential sites, Arg1202, Arg1222, and Arg1249. Cleavage at Arg1202 and Arg1249 would generate a 67-amino acid peptide, including the two 10-residue repeats for the HA epitope, with a calculated molecular mass of 7.6 kDa versus an apparent molecular mass of 7 kDa. Interestingly however, exhaustive trypsin digestion of MRP1-HA (1222) variant did not produce a smaller peptide that could represent cleavage at Arg1222. One possibility is that the Arg1222 site was not accessible to trypsin. Alternatively, cleavage at Arg1222 did occur, but the peptide generated from this cleavage was not photolabeled. Consequently, the photolabel is cross-linked to sequences between Arg1202 and Arg1222 or within TM16. The localization of the 7-kDa photolabeled peptide in MRP1-HA (1222) was further confirmed after exhaustive proteolytic digestion with V8 protease, which produced a 7-kDa peptide. Scanning MRP1 sequences for potential V8 sites revealed two glutamate residues (Glu1204 and Glu1253) near HA(1222). Hence the resulting polypeptide of 69 amino acid residues has a calculated molecular mass of 7.5 kDa versusan apparent mass of 7 kDa on SDS-PAGE. The localization of the 7-kDa IAARh123-photolabeled peptide to MRP1 sequences, which include TMs 16 and 17, is consistent with proteolytic cleavage of MRP1 with two different proteases. The latter findings are in agreement with an earlier study suggesting a possible role of the C-terminal domain (MSD2 and NBD2 or residues 959–1531) in determining MRP1 resistance to and transport of anthracyclines (40Stride B.D. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 22877-22883Google Scholar). The photolabeling of the same peptides of MRP1 by two structurally dissimilar photoreactive drugs (IAARh123 and IACI) suggests common binding domains. However, given the size of the photolabeled peptides with a combined sequence of 100 amino acid residues, it is conceivable that the photolabeled peptides can encode several binding sites for different groups of compounds. Alternatively, the photolabeled peptides in MRP1 represent domains that are distant from the drug transport site(s). Although the latter possibility is plausible, earlier mapping studies of P-gp1 drug binding site(s) using photoreactive drugs have shown that photoaffinity-labeled sequences represent functionally important drug binding sites, and mutations of amino acids in such domains modulate P-gp1 drug transport (41Kajiji S. Talbot F. Grizzuti K. Van Dyke-Phillips V. Agresti M. Safa A.R. Gros P. Biochemistry.. 1993; 32: 4185-4194Google Scholar, 42Greenberger L.M. J. Biol. Chem... 1993; 268: 11417-11425Google Scholar, 43Loo T. Clarke D. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 31945-31948Google Scholar). However, several questions relating to P-gp1 broad substrate specificity and the ability of P-gp1 to accommodate the binding of drugs remain unanswered. The photoaffinity-labeled domains of MRP1, which encode TMs 10–11 and TMs 16–17, are separated by ∼400 amino acid residues in its linear sequence (5Cole S.P.C. Bharswaj G. Gerlach J.H. Mackie J.E. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C. Stewart A.J. Kurz E.U. Duncan A.M.V. Deeley R.G. Science.. 1992; 258: 1650-1654Google Scholar). As such, photolabeling of MSD1 and MSD2 sequences in MRP1 suggest one of two possibilities; (a) the two photolabeled sequences from MSD1 and MSD2 are brought together by protein folding to form one large binding cavity that can accommodate interactions with many structurally dissimilar drugs or (b) the two photolabeled peptides represent two separate drug binding sites in MSD1 and MSD2 that are allosterically regulated. Although it is not possible to deter mine which model best fits the observed results in the current study, earlier reports with P-gp1 suggested two or more spatially separate sites linked allosterically through protein conformation (44Dey S.

Biochem... 1999; 259: 841-850Google Scholar). Secondary structure predictions of MRP1 have suggested the presence of a hydrophobic domain with five transmembrane domains (MSD0) and an extracytoplasmic N terminus linked to an MDR1-like core consisting of two MSDs and two NBDs in tandem (MSD1-NBD1-MSD2-NBD2). In contrast to MRP1, secondary structure predictions of P-gp1 have suggested two tandemly repeated MSD and NBD or an MDR1-like core. Alignment of the MRP1 and P-gp1 predicted secondary structures revealed TM 5–6 and TM 11–12 of P-gp1 to correspond to TM 10–11 and TM 16–17 of MRP1, respectively. Thus, the drug binding sites of both P-gp1 and MRP1 are localized to parallel domains in both proteins. This finding is unexpected in light of the low sequence identify between the two proteins (<20% (5Cole S.P.C. Bharswaj G. Gerlach J.H. Mackie J.E. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C. Stewart A.J. Kurz E.U. Duncan A.M.V. Deeley R.G. Science.. 1992; 258: 1650-1654Google Scholar)). Comparison of the amino acid sequences of the four major transmembrane domains in MRP1 and P-gp1 showed 14, 9, 4, and 14% sequence identity between TM 5, 6, 11, 12 of P-gp1 and TM 10, 11, 16, 17 of MRP1, respectively. In addition, helical wheel presentation of the transmembrane domains did not reveal any obvious similarities between MRP1 and P-gp1 transmembrane sequences. The findings that the photolabeled sequences of MRP1 encode transmembrane domains is interesting, since similar results have been obtained with P-gp1 whereby TMs 5–6 and 11–12 were also shown to mediate P-gp1-drug interactions (42Greenberger L.M. J. Biol. Chem... 1993; 268: 11417-11425Google Scholar, 43Loo T. Clarke D. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 31945-31948Google Scholar, 44Dey S. Ramachandra M. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Ambudkar S.V. Proc.

However, unlike P-gp1, which mediates the transport of hydrophobic drugs mainly from within the lipid bilayer, MRP1 appears to interact with and mediate the transport of drugs from the cytoplasm and the hydrophobic environment of the lipid bilayer (46Versantvoort C.H. Broxterman H.J. Bagrij T. Scheper R.J. Twentyman P.R. Br. J. Cancer.. 1995; 72: 82-89Google Scholar, 47Feller N. Kuiper C.M. Lankelma J. Ruhdal J.K. Scheper R.J. Pinedo H.M. Broxterman H.J. Br. J.

Consequently, the P-gp1-drug interaction model may be an oversimplified version of MRP1-drug interactions. In summary, the results of this study have identified two domains in MRP1 to a resolution of ∼50 amino acid residues that are photoaffinity-labeled with two structurally dissimilar drugs. Moreover, based on positions of the photolabeled peptides, the results of this study show that the drug binding domains are localized to TMs 10–11 of MSD1 and TMs 16–17 of MSD2. Efforts to identify the precise amino acid residues that are cross-linked to IAARh123 and IACI are ongoing. In addition, it will be of interest to know if the photolabeled sites identified in this study are the same or different from the binding site(s) of normal MRP1 substrates (e.g. LTC4 and other cell metabolites).

Compartmentalization of these enzymes is critical for spatial and temporal control of these phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events. We previously reported that a 220-kDa A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP220) coordinates the location of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and the type 1 protein phosphatase catalytic subunit (PP1c) (Schillace, R. V., and Scott, J. D. (1999) Curr. Biol. 9, 321–324). We now demonstrate that an AKAP220 fragment is a competitive inhibitor of PP1c activity (K i = 2.9 ± 0.7 μm). Mapping studies and activity measurements indicate that several protein-protein interactions act synergistically to inhibit PP1. A consensus targeting motif, between residues 1195 and 1198 (Lys-Val-Gln-Phe), binds but does not affect enzyme activity, whereas determinants between residues 1711 and 1901 inhibit the phosphatase. Analysis of truncated PP1c and chimeric PP1/2A catalytic subunits suggests that AKAP220 inhibits the phosphatase in a manner distinct from all known PP1 inhibitors and toxins. Intermolecular interactions within the AKAP220 signaling complex further contribute to PP1 inhibition as addition of the PKA regulatory subunit (RII) enhances phosphatase inhibition.

Extracellular signals conveyed by hormones and neurotransmitters are often relayed to precise intracellular sites through the generation of soluble second messengers such as calcium, phospholipid, or cAMP (1Chin D.

This sophisticated level of molecular organization ensures selectivity in cAMP-responsive events (20Edwards A.S. Scott J.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). PP1 location is controlled in a similar manner. The catalytic subunit of the phosphatase, PP1c, associates with numerous targeting subunits (21Hubbard M.J. Dent P. Smythe C. Cohen P. Eur. J.

Early examples are the GM and liver glycogen-targeting subunit proteins, which target PP1 to skeletal muscle and glycogen particles, respectively. However, additional targeting subunits have been identified such as NIPP-1, p53-binding protein-2, PP1 nuclear-targeting subunit, which direct PP1 to the nucleus, whereas spinophillin attaches the phosphatase to the actin cytoskeleton at postsynaptic sites in neurons (22Johnson D.F.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). A common characteristic of this diverse protein family is their modular design that includes the presence of a consensus phosphatase-targeting motif that recognizes PP1c (35Egloff M.P. Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Cohen P.T.W. Cohen P. Barford D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1876-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). The PP1c-targeting motif contains the sequence (Lys/Arg)-(Ile/Val)-Xaa-Phe (where Xaa is any amino acid) and has been shown to interact directly with a binding pocket on the surface of PP1c (35Egloff M.P. Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Cohen P.T.W. Cohen P. Barford D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1876-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). This “KVXF” motif is often considered a hallmark of PP1-targeting subunits, although several recent studies have suggested that there can be considerable degeneracy in the sequence (35Egloff M.P. Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Cohen P.T.W. Cohen P. Barford D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1876-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 36Westphal R.S. Tavalin S.J. Lin J.W. Alto N.M. Fraser I.D.

Biol. 1999; 9: 321-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This has led to the proposal that other binding surfaces on targeting subunits and phosphatase inhibitor proteins contact PP1c (38Park I.K. DePaoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28919-28928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Beullens M. Van Eynde A. Vulsteke V. Connor J. Shenolikar S. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol.

Several multivalent anchoring proteins have been identified that can simultaneously associate with kinases and phosphatases (41Faux M.C. Scott J.D. Cell. 1996; 70: 8-12Google Scholar). The first example was the neuronal anchoring protein AKAP79 which maintains a signaling scaffold of PKA, protein kinase C, and the calcium-calmodulin-dependent phosphatase PP-2B (41Faux M.C. Scott J.D. Cell. 1996; 70: 8-12Google Scholar, 42Coghlan V.M. Hausken Z.E. Scott J.D. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 591-596Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 43Klauck T.M. Faux M.C. Labudda K. Langeberg L.K. Jaken S. Scott J.D. Science. 1996; 271: 1589-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). However, certain PP1-targeting subunits serve this function also. For example, the protein targeted to glycogen maintains a signaling scaffold of PP1 and several enzymes involved in glycogen metabolism (44Printen J.A. Brady M.J. Saltiel A.R. Science. 1997; 275: 1475-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). AKAP149 recruits the PKA holoenzyme and PP1c to the lamina of nuclear membranes (45Steen R.L. Martins S.B. Tasken K. Collas P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1251-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Likewise, the NMDA receptor-associated protein Yotiao maintains an anchored PKA holoenzyme and constitutively active PP1c to regulate tightly the phosphorylation status and activity of the NMDA receptor ion channel (36Westphal R.S. Tavalin S.J. Lin J.W. Alto N.M. Fraser I.D. Langeberg L.K. Sheng M. Scott J.D. Science. 1999; 285: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). In both cases, these more sophisticated mechanisms of phosphatase tethering sequester the PP1c with physiologically relevant substrates (12Schillace R.V. Scott J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 761-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Another example is the vesicular anchoring protein AKAP220, which we recently showed was capable of anchoring PKA and tethering PP1c (37Schillace R.V. Scott J.D. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 321-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 46Lester L.B. Coghlan V.M. Nauert B. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 272: 9460-9465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In this report we present evidence to suggest that PP1 targeting by AKAP220 involves a consensus KVXF motif and additional binding determinants located in the C-terminal region of the anchoring protein. We demonstrate that AKAP220 is a competitive inhibitor of PP1 activity. Analysis of a truncated and a chimeric PP1 enzyme suggests that phosphatase inhibition occurs by a mechanism distinct from many known PP1 inhibitors. Most remarkably, the ability of AKAP220 to function as an inhibitor of PP1 was further enhanced by anchoring of the R subunit of PKA. These experiments provide evidence for an additional level of control whereby the RII-AKAP220 interaction augments the down-regulation of PP1 activity. Fragments of AKAP220 were constructed using restriction enzyme digest and PCR. Numbering of the AKAP220 fragments is based upon the amino acid sequence of the human ortholog (47Reinton N. Collas P. Haugen T.B. Skalhegg B.S. Hansson V. Jahnsen T. Tasken K. Dev. Biol. 2000; 223: 194-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Fragment 910–1901 was subcloned usingEcoRI restriction sites into Pet 30c (Novagen) for bacterial expression and purification. BamHI digest of the 910–1901 fragment was used to construct fragment 910–1228; SacI digest of the 910–1901 fragment was used to generate 1182–1901; andSacI/HindIII double digest of the 910–1901 fragment generated fragment 1182–1591. PCR using oligos 5′ CGAGCTCGAACCCAAGGTTAAAAACCCTTGC and 5′ CCGCTCGAGGAGCCATCTTGCCCCAAACCTTCTA facilitated generation of fragment 1228–1901 by adding SacI and XhoI sites. This fragment was then digested with HindIII to make fragment 1228–1591. PCR was again used to generate fragments 1591–1901 oligos 5′ CGAGCTCTACTGTGACCTTAAAGAACTCC and Pet 30 T7 terminator, 1591–1714 oligos 5′ CGAGCTCTACTGTGACCTTAAAGAACTCC and 5′ CCCAAGCTTGACAGACTCAGTTGACTGAAAGT, and 1711–1901 oligos 5′ CGAGCTCGAAGACTTTCAGTCAACTGAGTC and Pet30 T7 terminator.SacI/HindIII double digest was then used to clone the PCR fragments into Pet 30. Point mutations were generated by quick change PCR mutagenesis (Stratagene) using different oligos for the Phe → Ala, Val → Ala, and FV → AA mutations. The Phe → Ala oligos used were 5′ GCACTCAGGGAAGAAGGTTCAGGCTGCAGAAGC and 5′ GCTTCTGCAGCCTGAACCTTCTTCCCTGAGTGC. The Val → Ala oligos used were 5′ GCACTCAGGGAAGAAGGCTCAGTTTGCAGAAGC and 5′ GCTTCTGCAAACTGAGCCTTCTTCCCTGAGTGC. The FV → AA oligos used were 5′ GCACTCAGGGAAGAAGGCTCAGGCTGCAGAAGC and 5′ GCTTCTGCAGCCTGAGCCTTCTTCCCTGAGTGC. Each construct was sequenced in both directions to confirm the presence of the PCR-induced mutation. All fragments were expressed as N-terminal His6-tagged proteins in bacteria (BL21DE3) and purified via His tag purification using hi-trap chelating resin and FPLC (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Briefly, cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 5000 ×g for 10 min and then sonicated in buffer A at 4 °C (20 mm HEPES, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.9), and centrifuged at 35,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. Fragment 910–1901 was predominantly an insoluble protein; therefore, 6m urea was added to Buffer A and a second round of sonication and centrifugation was conducted. Supernatants were filtered (0.2 μm) and then applied to hi-trap chelating resin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using FPLC. Bound proteins were eluted with a stepwise gradient of imidazole (0–0.5 m) in buffer A. Fractions containing purified protein were identified by Coomassie staining of SDS-PAGE gels. Stepwise dialysis removed imidazole and urea from the protein preparations. Phosphorylase b was phosphorylated by phosphorylase kinase (in 100 mm Tris, 100 mm glycerophosphate, pH 8.2, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 2 mm CaCl) using [γ-32P]ATP during a 3-h incubation at 30 °C (phosphorylase b and phosphorylase kinase, Sigma). The reaction was stopped by adding 50 mm NaF, 20 mmEDTA (final concentrations) for an additional 15 min at 30 °C. Phosphorylase a was then precipitated by incubation with an equal volume of saturated ammonium sulfate solution on ice for 30 min followed by a 10-min 14,000 × g spin. The pellet was resuspended in phosphorylase a solubilization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 15 nm caffeine) and passed over a Pierce desalting column to remove remaining free ATP. Phosphorylasea eluted from the column with solubilization buffer in the first few fractions, whereas free nucleotide was retained on the column. Phosphatase assay was performed in a total volume of 30 μl at 30 °C. Recombinant PP1 (generously provided by Dr. Ernest Lee) or the native rabbit enzyme were diluted in phosphatase dilution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm DTT, 1 mmMnCl2). AKAP220 fragments were diluted in phosphatase assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% bovine serum albumin). PP1 and inhibitors were incubated for 5 min at 30 °C and then substrate was added. After 10 min at 30 °C, the reactions were stopped with 30% trichloroacetic acid. Following a 10-min incubation on ice and a 5-min, 14,000 × g spin, 100 μl of supernatant was removed, and the amount of 32P radioactivity released was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Competitive inhibition assays were conducted over a 0.02–0.8 μm range of phosphorylase a and 0.01–10 μm AKAP220. The PP1 overlay assay was performed essentially as described (37Schillace R.V. Scott J.D. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 321-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Briefly, fragments were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transfer to Immobilon. The membranes were incubated with 0.5 μg of recombinant PP1cα in TTBS (0.03% Tween, Tris-buffered saline) for 2 h at room temperature. PP1 bound to the membrane was detected by Western blot using a polyclonal anti-PP1α antibody and chemiluminescence detection (Pierce). We have previously shown that AKAP220 interacts with the PKA holoenzyme and PP1 in vitro and inside cells (37Schillace R.V. Scott J.D. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 321-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 46Lester L.B. Coghlan V.M. Nauert B. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 272: 9460-9465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To investigate further these events it was important to define the mechanism of AKAP220 interaction with the phosphatase. A recombinant fragment encompassing residues 910–1901 of human AKAP220 inhibited PP1 activity with an IC50 of 3.6 ± 0.7 μm (n= 4) when phosphorylase a was used as a substrate (Fig.1 A). Control experiments confirmed that this AKAP220 fragment inhibited recombinant PP1α or the purified rabbit enzyme to similar extent (Fig. 1 B). Double-reciprocal plots were used to calculate an inhibition constant (K i) of 2.9 ± 0.7 μm(n = 3) demonstrating that the AKAP220-(910–1901) fragment was a competitive inhibitor of PP1α activity (Fig.1 C). One implication of these findings is that binding determinants on the anchoring protein must influence the active site of the phosphatase. Within the AKAP220 peptide is a core sequence of Lys-Val-Gln-Phe which is a recognizable characteristic of many PP1-targeting subunits (35Egloff M.P. Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Cohen P.T.W. Cohen P. Barford D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1876-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that an AKAP220 peptide encompassing this sequence (residues 1185–1207) binds PP1α with nanomolar affinity (37Schillace R.V. Scott J.D. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 321-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This sequence is unlikely to bind at the active site of the enzyme as other investigators have demonstrated that related “KVXF” peptides do not inhibit phosphatase activity (22Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Caudwell F.B. Cohen P. Chen Y.H. Chen M.X. Cohen P.T.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar,26Allen P.B. Ouimet C.C. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9956-9961Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). More conclusive support for this view has been provided by crystallographic analysis of PP1c complexed with a peptide derived from the glycogen-targeting subunit GM. These elegant studies show that the KVXF sequence binds to a hydrophobic surface that is distal to the catalytic center of the phosphatase (35Egloff M.P. Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Cohen P.T.W. Cohen P. Barford D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1876-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). These protein-protein interactions must represent a principle targeting interaction as delivery of KVXF peptides into tissue culture cells and dissociated striatal neurons disrupts PP1 location (21Hubbard M.J. Dent P. Smythe C. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 189: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 22Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Caudwell F.B. Cohen P. Chen Y.H. Chen M.X. Cohen P.T.W. Eur. J.

Neuron. 1999; 23: 435-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). One relevant example is peptide-mediated disruption of PP1 from a phosphatase-kinase signaling complex maintained by Yotiao, a scaffolding protein that binds to the cytoplasmic tail of the NMDA-type glutamate receptor ion channel (36Westphal R.S. Tavalin S.J. Lin J.W. Alto N.M. Fraser I.D. Langeberg L.K. Sheng M. Scott J.D. Science. 1999; 285: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 51Lin J.W. Wyszynski M. Madhavan R. Sealock R. Kim J.U. Sheng M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2017-2027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interruption of the Yotiao/PP1 interaction uncouples phosphatase regulation of the ion channel and enhances cAMP-responsive currents (19Fraser I.D. Scott J.D. Neuron. 1999; 23: 423-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 36Westphal R.S. Tavalin S.J. Lin J.W. Alto N.M. Fraser I.D. Langeberg L.K. Sheng M. Scott J.D. Science. 1999; 285: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). In some respects Yotiao and AKAP220 have related roles. Both anchoring proteins maintain a PP1-PKA signaling complex and target the enzymes to precise locations within cells. However, one important distinction is that the 910–1901 fragment of AKAP220 is a reasonably potent competitive inhibitor of PP1 activity. Thus, there must be additional binding sites on AKAP220 that inhibit the phosphatase. Two recombinant fragments of human AKAP220 were further characterized to locate sites on the anchoring protein that inhibit the phosphatase (Fig. 2 A). A large C-terminal fragment, AKAP220-(910–1901), inhibits the phosphatase with an IC50 of 3.6 ± 0.7 μm (n= 4, Fig. 2 B). Solid-phase binding experiments using an overlay procedure confirmed that this AKAP220 fragment retained the ability to bind PP-1 (Fig. 2 D). Furthermore, mutation of the KVQF motif does not significantly impair the inhibitory potency of the AKAP220-(910–1901) fragment (Fig. 2 B). Substitution of Val-1196 → Ala, Phe-1198 → Ala, or replacement of both residues with alanine (Fig. 2 C) within the context of the AKAP220-(901–1901) fragment had no qualitative effect on PP1 interaction (Fig. 2 D). However, phosphatase binding was abolished when the same panel of mutants was screened for PP1 interaction within the context of a smaller fragment, AKAP220-(1112–1258) (Fig. 2, E and F). Control experiments confirmed that the wild-type AKAP220-(1112–1258) fragment bound PP1 in the overlay assay (Fig. 2 E) and activity measurements confirmed that this 146-residue fragment which spans the KVQF sequence does not inhibit the phosphatase (Fig. 2 B). Additional control experiments confirmed that equal amounts of each AKAP220 fragment were used in the overlay blots (data not shown). Collectively, these results allow us to conclude that inhibition of PP1 activity involves the C-terminal half of AKAP220 and does not require binding through the KVQF sequence. A family of AKAP220 fragments spanning selected regions of the anchoring protein were generated to identify further phosphatase-binding sites and PP1 inhibitory determinants (Fig.3 A). Each AKAP220 fragment was expressed in E. coli as a His6 fusion protein and affinity-purified using FPLC His tag technology. Approximately equal amounts of each purified protein fragment were used (Fig.3 B), and interaction with PP1 was assessed by the overlay assay (Fig. 3 C). All binding studies were performed at least three times. As expected all AKAP220 fragments including the KVQF sequence bound PP1 (Fig. 3 C, lanes 1–4), although weaker binding was observed with AKAP220-(910–1228), a fragment that contained the KVQF sequence at the extreme C terminus (Fig.3 C, lane 2). Most importantly, certain fragments such as AKAP220-(1228–1901) that lack the KVQF sequence also retained the ability to interact with PP1 as assessed by the overlay assay (Fig.3 C, lane 5). This led to the analysis of additional fragments spanning this region (Fig. 3 A) which permitted the mapping of supplementary PP1 binding determinants between residues 1711 and 1901 of AKAP220 (Fig. 3 C, lanes 6–9). Thus, at least two regions of AKAP220 interact with PP1 as follows: a conserved targeting motif between residues 1195 and 1198, and site(s) located between residues 1711 and 1901 of the anchoring protein (Fig.4 A).Figure 4Mapping the PP1 inhibitory site on AKAP220.

All data represent an average of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A logical next step was to ascertain if the C-terminal binding region of AKAP220 influenced PP1 activity. Inhibition profiles for a representative selection of AKAP220 fragments are presented in Fig. 4,B and C. Initial experiments showed that AKAP220-(1228–1901) inhibited PP1 activity with an IC50 of 3 ± 0.3 μm (n = 3) (Fig. 4 B, closed squares), whereas AKAP220-(910–1228), an upstream fragment that encompasses the targeting motif, had little effect on phosphatase activity (Fig. 4 B, open circles). Further analysis indicated that PP1 inhibitory determinants were located in the last 300 residues of the anchoring protein (Fig. 4 C). Interestingly, residues 1711–1901 inhibited PP1 α with an IC50 of 48.9 ± 4.6 μm (n = 3) (Fig. 4 C, closed squares), whereas a larger fragment that included the RII binding domain (AKAP220-(1591–1901)) inhibited the phosphatase to a 10-fold greater extent (IC50 of 4.1 ± 1.1 μm(n = 3); Fig. 4 C, closed triangles). Thus it would appear that multiple interactions including an inhibitory site located between residues 1711 and 1901 promote tight binding and inhibition of the phosphatase. This finding is consistent with structure-function analysis on several protein inhibitors of PP1 such as inhibitor-1 (I-1), inhibitor-2 (I-2), NIPP-1, and DARPP-32 (24Huang H.B. Horiuchi A.

To examine the mechanism of PP1 inhibition by AKAP220, we first analyzed a chimeric PP1α catalytic subunit containing C-terminal sequences from PP2A (55Connor J.H. Kleeman T. Barik S. Honkanen R.E. Shenolikar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22366-22372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This reengineered phosphatase, termed CRHM2, is sensitive to toxins, such as microcystin, tautomycin, and fostreicin, but is not inhibited by the phosphorylated inhibitor proteins including I-1, I-2, or NIPP-1 (39Beullens M.

When incubated with AKAP220, the PP1/2A chimera (Fig.5, open squares) is inhibited to a similar extent as the wild-type PP1 (Fig. 5, closed squares). In addition, we analyzed a truncated PP1α catalytic subunit lacking the variable N- and C-terminal sequences, termed PP1 core, that was previously shown to be insensitive to both protein and small molecule inhibitors. The PP1 core was also inhibited by AKAP220 in a manner similar to the wild-type phosphatase (Fig. 5, filled triangles). These results indicate that AKAP220 inhibits phosphatase activity by a mechanism distinct from known PP1 inhibitors. To emphasize this point, fostreicin, an anti-cancer drug that inhibits the PP1 catalytic core competed with AKAP220 for PP1 inhibition (data not shown). Thus, the data suggest that the β12–13 loop in the PP1 catalytic subunit is not essential for its inhibition by AKAP220. Furthermore, residues 1711–1901 of the anchoring protein bind the phosphatase in a manner distinct from many known PP1 inhibitors, proteins, and toxins. Although PKA and PP1 bind to distinct regions of AKAP220, it was of interest to establish if there was any cooperative effect of PKA anchoring on phosphatase activity. Earlier reports (56Jurgensen S.R. Chock P.B. Taylor S. Vandenheede J.R. Merlevede W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7565-7569Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 57Khatra B.S. Printz R. Cobb C.E. Corbin J.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 130: 567-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) had suggested that RII was a noncompetitive inhibitor of PP1 with phosphorylase aas a substrate. Since the C terminus of AKAP220 binds both RII and PP1, it was important to explore the potential influence of these protein interactions on inhibition of the phosphatase. Recombinant RII inhibited PP1 with an IC50 = 2.2 ± 0.7 μm (n = 3) (Fig.6 A, open circles), a similar inhibitory potency to the AKAP220-(910–1901) fragment (Fig. 6 A, closed triangles). However, PP1 inhibition was enhanced 4-fold (IC50 = 0.59 ± 0.2 μm(n = 3)) when RII was added to the enzyme reaction (Fig. 6 A, open triangles). Since the AKAP220-(910–1901) fragment contains determinants of PKA anchoring, we reasoned that RII could enhance PP1 inhibition in either an additive or a cooperative manner (Fig. 5 A, inset). Additive effects would require that both RII and AKAP220 inhibit PP1 by binding at different sites on the phosphatase. Cooperative effects could occur if the RII-AKAP220 complex constrained a preferred conformation or exposed additional determinants within the anchoring protein that enhanced PP1 inhibition. In an attempt to delineate between these two possible mechanisms, we used AKAP220-(1711–1901), a fragment which lacks the RII-binding site (Fig. 3 A). This fragment inhibited PP1 with an IC50 = 34.5 ± 5.9 μm (n= 3) in the absence of RII (Fig. 6 B, closed squares). However, PP1 inhibition was enhanced ∼28-fold in the presence of equimolar concentrations of RII (IC50 = 1.2 ± 0.2 μm (n = 3) Fig. 6 B, open squares). Control binding experiments confirmed that the AKAP220-(1711–1901) fragment does not bind RII in vitro(data not shown). These results suggest that AKAP220 and RII are more likely to work additively to inhibit PP1 by binding to separate sites on the phosphatase (Fig. 6 B, inset). The greater inhibitory potency of the larger AKAP220 fragment implies that RII association with the anchoring protein may orient the regulatory subunit to permit optimal inhibitory contact with the phosphatase (Fig.6 A, inset). The substrate specificity of the type I protein phosphatase catalytic subunit PP1c is thought to be influenced in large part through association with targeting subunits (58Zolnierowicz S. Bollen M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). This growing family of proteins not only controls the subcellular location of PP1 leading to selective dephosphorylation of certain substrates but also influences the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme (21Hubbard M.J.

To perform both functions it has been proposed that PP1-targeting subunits and inhibitor proteins interact with multiple sites on the phosphatase (38Park I.K. DePaoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol.

These residues include Thr-155, Ser-223, Arg-224, Arg-233 and Tyr-235. Systematic replacement of these amino acids was done to identify which of them are the main determinants of coenzyme specificity. Our data indicate that all of the residues interacting with the 2′-phosphate of NADP+/H in Anabaena FNR are not involved to the same extent in determining coenzyme specificity and affinity. Thus, it is found that Ser-223 and Tyr-235 are important for determining NADP+/H specificity and orientation with respect to the protein, whereas Arg-224 and Arg-233 provide only secondary interactions in Anabaena FNR. The analysis of the T155G FNR form also indicates that the determinants of coenzyme specificity are not only situated in the 2′-phosphate NADP+/H interacting region but that other regions of the protein must be involved. These regions, although not interacting directly with the coenzyme, must produce specific structural arrangements of the backbone chain that determine coenzyme specificity. The loop formed by residues 261–268 inAnabaena FNR must be one of these regions.

During the last decades, the understanding of protein function and, more specifically, the role of the individual amino acid residues involved in substrate binding and in the catalytic action have achieved considerable progress. Among the most relevant enzymes studied are those involved in electron transfer processes due to their practical importance. Now, the opportunity to design novel proteins is becoming more feasible, especially due to the increased detailed knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of many proteins. As a first step in this direction recent investigations have been aimed to redesign already existing proteins, so that they can produce a function different to that for which they were naturally synthesized (1Clarke A.R. Atkinson T. Holbrook J.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14 (, 145–148): 101-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 2Hedstrom L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 608-611Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Following this direction, a lot of effort is being made in the description of the determinants of coenzyme specificity for NAD(P)+/H-dependent redox enzymes (3Scrutton N.S. Berry A. Perham R.N. Nature. 1990; 343: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, 4Friesen J.A. Lawrence C.M. Stauffacher C.V. Rodwell V.W.

A. 1996; 93: 12171-12176Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In biological systems NAD+/H is almost exclusively used by enzymes that catalyze oxidative exergonic reactions, whereas reductive endergonic reactions are generally catalyzed by enzymes that utilize NADP+/H (6Zubay G.L. Biochemistry. Wm. C. Brown Publishers, Dubuque, IA1998Google Scholar). However, the only structural difference between them is the presence of a 2′-P group bound to the AMP moiety of the coenzyme in NADP+/H, and it is the presence or the absence of this phosphate group that permits the enzymes to make the distinction between these two coenzymes. Moreover, among the structurally related enzymes of the FNR family, members with preference either for NADP+/H or NAD+/H can be found. Crystallographic studies have demonstrated that discrimination between these coenzymes does not result from the presence of different structural domains in these enzymes (7Rossmann M. Moras D. Olsen K. Nature. 1974; 250: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar, 8Karplus P.A. Daniels M.J. Herriott J.R.

Biol. 1997; 268: 739-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We describe the introduction of point mutations in the coenzyme binding domain of ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase (FNR,1 EC 1.18.1.2) from the cyanobacterium Anabaena PCC7119 to probe the determinants of its coenzyme specificity and also as an initial attempt to alter the coenzyme specificity. This enzyme consists of a soluble single polypeptide chain that contains a noncovalently bound FAD group that is the cofactor involved in the redox reaction. Several points prompted us to choose FNR. During photosynthesis FNR accepts electrons from ferredoxin and uses them to convert NADP+ into NADPH (10Arakaki A.K. Ceccarelli E.A. Carrillo N. FASEB. J. 1997; 11: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). This process is highly specific for NADP+/Hversus NAD+/H (11Batie C.J. Kamin H. J. Biol.

Extensive biochemical characterization of FNR from different sources and, in particular, fromAnabaena has been carried out (11–23), and several three-dimensional structures of FNR forms are available (24Serre L. Vellieux F.M.D. Medina M. Gómez-Moreno C. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Frey M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 20-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 25Bruns C.M. Karplus P.A. J. Mol.

Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Moreover, the structural arrangement of FNR has been proposed to be the prototype of a family of flavin oxidoreductases that interact specifically with either NADP+/H or NAD+/H (8Karplus P.A. Daniels M.J. Herriott J.R. Science. 1991; 251: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar,25Bruns C.M. Karplus P.A. J. Mol.

Finally, considering the high economical value of the reduced form of NADP+/H, the development of an in vitrosystem using FNR to generate NADPH is of high interest. Work is already under progress in this direction, and we foresee this development occurring in the near future (28Madoz-Gúrpide J. Abad J.M. Fernández-Recio J. Vélez M. Vázquez L. Gómez-Moreno C. Fernández V.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 9808-9817Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). If we also achieve change of coenzyme specificity for FNR, generation of NADH could also be obtained with the same system. Moreover, due to the much cheaper value of NADHversus NADPH, the system could be used in the opposite direction, with NADH as reducing power, to produce reduced proteins (like ferredoxin, flavodoxin, hydrogenase, cytochrome P450 reductase, etc.). Different crystallographic approaches on a variety of FNR forms from different sources have provided a picture of how the NADP+substrate must bind to FNR (24Serre L. Vellieux F.M.D. Medina M. Gómez-Moreno C. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Frey M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 20-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 25Bruns C.M. Karplus P.A. J. Mol.

Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Thus, the studies of spinach andAnabaena FNR revealed the importance of the side chains of residues Arg-100, Ser-223, Arg-224, Arg-233, Tyr-235, and Gln-237 (Anabaena FNR numeration) in the stabilization of the complex with NADP+/H by making contacts to its adenine ring, its 2′-P, and its 5′-phosphoryl (24Serre L. Vellieux F.M.D. Medina M. Gómez-Moreno C. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Frey M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 20-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 25Bruns C.M. Karplus P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 125-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The negative charge of the 2′-P group is apparently stabilized by the lateral chains of two positive-charged arginine residues, Arg-224 and Arg-233 (Arg-235 and Lys-244 in the spinach enzyme). The 2′-P of NADP+/H might also form hydrogen bonds with Ser-223 and Tyr-235 (in this case a stacking interaction is also formed with the adenine moiety of NADP+/H) (Fig.1 A). The sequence and three-dimensional structure of FNR at the site of NADP+interaction have been compared with those of several NADP+and NAD+ reductases within the FNR family (TableI, Fig. 1). Conservation of residues interacting with the 2′-P group of NADP+/H was observed. Thus, Ser-223, Arg-224, Arg-233, and Tyr-235 are conserved or show conservative substitutions in all the NADP+/H-depending enzymes (Fig. 1 B, Table I). However, in the NAD+/H-dependent enzymes, these residues are not conserved, which interrupts the stabilization of 2′-P group and probably modifies the stacking interaction with the adenine moiety of NADP+/H by changing Tyr-235 by Phe (Fig.1 C). Sequence and structure analysis suggest that other regions of the protein might also account for FNR coenzyme specificity (Table I, Fig. 1, D–F). Thus, most of the members of the FNR family that bind NADP+/H show the sequence T(P)GTGXAP (residues 155–161 in Anabaena FNR; whereas in those interacting with NAD+/H, the corresponding sequence is GGXGXTP (Table I). These residues form the loop between β1 and α-helix A as well as the first residues of this α-helix, whose N-terminal end might stabilize an interaction with the negative pyrophosphate of the coenzyme (Fig. 1 D). A similar motif has also been shown to exist in the case of the flavoenzyme glutathione reductase, which is not a member of the FNR family and to be involved in coenzyme specificity (3Scrutton N.S. Berry A. Perham R.N. Nature. 1990; 343: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). To confirm the importance of the interactions with the 2′-P group of NADP+ and of the TGTGXAP FNR motive in Anabaena FNR coenzyme specificity, the T155G, S223G, S223D, R224Q, R233A, Y235F, and Y235A AnabaenaFNR mutants have been constructed and characterized by a variety of techniques. The choice of the introduced mutations has been made taking into account the residues that occupy the equivalent positions in the NAD+/H-dependent members of the FNR family and trying to simulate a potential change in cofactor specificity (TableI). The rest of the mutations have been analyzed as controls.

AnabaenaFNR mutants were prepared using a construct of the petH gene previously cloned into the expression vector pTrc99a as a template (30Gómez-Moreno C. Martı́nez-Júlvez M. Fillat M.F. Hurley J.K. Tollin G. Mathis P. Photosynthesis: from Light to Biosphere. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, Netherlands1995: 627-632Google Scholar). The FNR mutants T155G, S223D, S223G, R224Q, R233A, Y235F, and Y235A were produced using the Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit from CLONTECH in combination with suitable synthetic oligonucleotides. The pTrc99a vectors with the desired mutation were used to transform the Escherichia coli Pasteur collection strain 0225 (17Medina M. Martı́nez-Júlvez M. Hurley J.K. Tollin G. Gómez-Moreno C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2715-2728Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). FNR mutants were purified from isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced LB cultures as described previously (17Medina M. Martı́nez-Júlvez M. Hurley J.K. Tollin G. Gómez-Moreno C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2715-2728Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 30Gómez-Moreno C. Martı́nez-Júlvez M. Fillat M.F. Hurley J.K. Tollin G. Mathis P. Photosynthesis: from Light to Biosphere. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, Netherlands1995: 627-632Google Scholar). Some of the mutants were not retained by the Cibacron blue gel and were purified by fast protein liquid chromatography using a Mono-Q column. UV-visible spectra and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were used as purity criteria. Ultraviolet-visible spectral analyses were carried out either on a Hewlett-Packard diode array 8452 spectrophotometer, a Kontron Uvikon 860 spectrophotometer, or a Kontron Uvikon 942 spectrophotometer. Circular dichroism was carried out on a Jasco 710 spectropolarimeter at room temperature in a 1-cm path length cuvette. Protein concentrations were 0.7 μm for the far UV and 3 μm for the aromatic and visible regions of the spectrum. Photoreduction of different FNR forms was performed at room temperature in an anaerobic cuvette containing 32–65 μmFNR samples and 3 μm 5-deazariboflavin in 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8. The solutions were made anaerobic by repeated evacuation and flushing with O2-free Ar. The spectra were recorded in a HP8452 diode array spectrophotometer before and after irradiating the samples with a 300-W light source for different times. Dissociation constants of the complexes between oxidized FNR mutants and either NADP+ or NAD+were measured by differential spectroscopy using a double beam spectrophotometer at 25 °C as previously described (12Sancho J. Gómez-Moreno C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 288: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 17Medina M. Martı́nez-Júlvez M. Hurley J.K. Tollin G. Gómez-Moreno C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2715-2728Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Diaphorase activity, assayed with DCPIP as artificial electron acceptor was determined for all the FNR mutants as described previously (17Medina M. Martı́nez-Júlvez M. Hurley J.K. Tollin G. Gómez-Moreno C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2715-2728Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Both NADPH and NADH were assayed as coenzyme electron donors to each of the different FNR mutants. Unless otherwise stated, all the measurements were carried out in 50 mmTris/HCl, pH 8.0. In all measurements, direct reduction of DCPIP by the coenzyme was subtracted from that of the enzyme-coenzyme mixture. The kinetic results obtained from the diaphorase activity were interpreted using the Michaelis-Menten kinetic model. In the case of the diaphorase reactions studied using NADH, high enzyme concentrations (0.5–9 μm) were required to detect and follow their activity. Therefore, in some of these cases the coenzyme concentration used was only 100 times higher than that of the corresponding enzyme. This was also the case for the S223D FNR form with NADPH, where the enzyme concentration in the cuvette was 1 μm. When assaying the reaction of the other FNR enzymes with NADPH, enzyme concentrations ranging from 3 to 25 nm were used. Fast electron transfer processes between NADPH or NADH and the different FNRoxmutants were studied by stopped-flow methodology under anaerobic conditions using an Applied Photophysics SX17.MV spectrophotometer interfaced with an Acorn 5000 computer using the SX.17MV software ofApplied Photophysics as previously described (17Medina M. Martı́nez-Júlvez M. Hurley J.K. Tollin G. Gómez-Moreno C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2715-2728Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The observed rate constants (k obs) were calculated by fitting the data to a mono- or bi-exponential equation. Samples were made anaerobic (in specially designed tonometers that fit the stopped-flow apparatus) by successive evacuation and flushing with O2-free Ar in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0. Final FNR concentrations were kept between 6 and 11 μm, whereas, unless otherwise stated, NADPH final concentrations were in the range of 160–200 μm, and NADH was used at final concentrations in the range of 250–300 μm or at 2.5 mm. The same methodology was also applied to the study of the reduction of NADP+ by T155G FNRrd. The time course of the reactions was followed at 460 nm, although other wavelengths were also analyzed (340 and 600 nm). Crystals of the T155G FNR mutant were grown by the hanging drop method. The 5-μl droplets consisted of 2 μl of 25.9 mg of protein/ml of solution buffered with 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 1 μl of unbuffered β-octylglucoside at 5% (w/v), and 2 μl of reservoir solution containing 18% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 6000, 20 mm ammonium sulfate, and 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.0. The droplet was equilibrated against 1 ml of reservoir solution at 20 °C. Under these conditions crystals grew within 1–7 days up to a maximum size of (0.8 × 0.4 × 0.4 mm) in the presence of a phase separation caused by the detergent. These crystals were mounted in glass capillaries and screened on a Mar Research (Germany) image plate area detector for intensity, resolution, and mosaic spread using graphite-monochromated CuKα radiation generated by an Enraf-Nonius rotating anode generator. X-ray data for the T155G FNR were collected at 20 °C to a maximum resolution of 2.4 Å. Crystals belong to the P65 hexagonal space group with the following unit cell dimensions: a= b = 88.13 Å and c = 97.25 Å. TheV M is 3.0 Å3/Da with one FNR molecule in the asymmetric unit and 60% solvent content. The x-ray data set was processed with MOSFLM (31Leslie A.G.W. Helliwell J.R. Machin P.A. Papiz M.Z. Proceedings of the CCP4 Study Weekend. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, United Kingdom1987: 39-50Google Scholar) and scaled and reduced with SCALA from the CCP4 package (32Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19667) Google Scholar). The T155G structure was solved by molecular replacement using the program AmoRe (33Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5026) Google Scholar) on the basis of the 1.8-Å resolution native FNR model (24Serre L. Vellieux F.M.D. Medina M. Gómez-Moreno C. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Frey M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 20-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) without the FAD cofactor. An unambiguous single solution for the rotation and translation functions was obtained. This solution was refined by the fast rigid-body refinement program FITING (34Castellano E. Oliva G. Navaza J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1992; 25: 281-284Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The model was subjected to alternate cycles of conjugate gradient refinement with the program X-PLOR (35Brünger A.T. X-PLOR: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1993Google Scholar) and manual model building with the software package O (36Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar). The crystallographic R andR free (37Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (3839) Google Scholar) values converged to values of 0.16 and 0.24, respectively for reflections between 9.0- and 2.4-Å resolution (Table II). The final model contains 2335 nonhydrogen protein atoms and 1 FAD, 1 SO42−, and 267 solvent molecules. The atomic coordinates of the T155G FNR mutant have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (code 1bqe).Table IIData collection and refinement statisticsData collectionTemperature (K)291SourceRotating anodeSpace groupP65Cell a, b,c (Å)88.13, 88.13, 97.25Resolution range (Å)40.1–2.4No. of unique reflections15,728Completeness of data (%)All data99.5Outer shell97.2R sym2-aRsym = ΣhklΣi‖Ii − 〈I〉‖/ΣhklΣi〈I〉.0.10Refinement statisticsSigma cutoffResolution range (Å)9.0–2.4No. of protein atoms2335No. of heterogen atoms58No. of solvent atoms267R-factor2-bR-factor=∥F o‖−‖F c∥/‖F o‖.0.16Free R-factor0.24r.m.s. deviationBond lengths (Å)0.014Bond angles (degree)1.4r.m.s., root mean square.2-a Rsym = ΣhklΣi‖Ii − 〈I〉‖/ΣhklΣi〈I〉.2-b R-factor=∥F o‖−‖F c∥/‖F o‖.

All the mutants were obtained in homogeneous form and in amounts suitable to perform the demanding characterization studies described herein. Mutants at the position of Ser-223 interacted weakly with the Cibacron blue column, which binds specifically those proteins with a NAD(P)+/H interaction site, requiring the use of a fast protein liquid chromatography Mono-Q column for purification. No major differences were detected in the UV-visible absorption and CD spectra of any of the FNR forms (Fig.2). Therefore, no major structural perturbations appear to have been introduced by the mutations, and the extinction coefficient of Anabaena WT FNR (9.4 mm−1 cm−1at 458 nm) (38Pueyo J.J. Gómez-Moreno C. Prep. Biochem. 1991; 21: 191-204PubMed Google Scholar) has been assumed herein for all the FNR mutants. Illumination of the FNR forms in the presence of 5-deazariboflavin caused the reduction of the protein to the neutral FNR semiquinone form with maxima in the range of 520 and 588–595 nm for all the FNR mutants (Fig. 2 B). As for the WT enzyme, isosbestic points are also detected around 364 and 507 nm for the oxidized-semiquinone transition for all the mutants. Under the assayed conditions WT FNR stabilizes only 22% semiquinone. However, although a similar amount of semiquinone form is stabilized by most of the mutants, S223G and S223D showed an unexpected increment in the proportion of the radical stabilization (34 and 43%, respectively). The steady-state kinetic parameters of the different FNR mutants were analyzed for the DCPIP-diaphorase reaction using either NADPH or NADH as electron donor (Table III). T155G, R224Q, and Y235F yielded similar values for k catin the NADPH-dependent reaction to the WT enzyme. This parameter decreased by a factor of 4, 2, and 4 for S223G, R233A, and Y235A, respectively, and was up to 200 times smaller in the case of the S223D FNR form. With regard to the K m value for NADPH, T155G, R224Q, and Y235F showed moderated increments with regard to the WT enzyme value (about 4-, 13-, and 7-fold), whereas S223G, R233A, and Y235A yielded much higher K m values for NADPH (about 50-, 36-, and 67-fold, respectively), with S233D being the mutant with the highest K m value"
https://openalex.org/W2160880843,"Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitory proteins (CKIs) are negative regulators of the cell cycle. Of all CKIs, only p57Kip2 plays an essential role(s) that other CKIs cannot compensate for in embryonic development. Recently, we found that p57Kip2 is degraded through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in osteoblastic cells stimulated to proliferation by transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 (Urano, T., Yashiroda, H., Muraoka, M., Tanaka, K., Hosoi, T., Inoue, S., Ouchi, Y., and Toyoshima, H. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 12197–12200). We report here that TGF-β1-induced p57Kip2proteolysis is mediated through transcription by the Smad pathway. When the constitutively active form of the TGF-β type I receptor ALK-5(TD) was ectopically expressed in osteoblastic cells, p57Kip2that had been accumulated by serum starvation causing the cell-cycle arrest was rapidly degraded in a manner analogous to TGF-β1 stimulation. Moreover, Smad2 or Smad3 with Smad4 enhanced the proteolytic pathway of p57Kip2. The degradation of p57Kip2 evoked by TGF-β1 was blocked by forced expression of an inhibitory Smad called Smad7 or by the addition of actinomycin D or α-amanitin. These results indicate that accelerated degradation of p57Kip2 by TGF-β1/Smad signaling is mediated through a newly synthesized factor(s) that modifies p57Kip2 or the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.

Without these requirements, cells may progress from the G1 phase toward quiescence or terminal differentiation. In these regulatory processes, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs)1 positively drive the progression of the cell cycle, whereas CDK inhibitory proteins (CKIs) act as negative regulators by binding to cyclin-CDK complexes (reviewed in Refs. 1Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5144) Google Scholar and 2Vidal A. Koff A. Gene ( Amst .). 2000; 247: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). CKIs have been classified into two families in mammals, i.e. the INK4 (inhibitor of CDKs) family and the Cip/Kip (CDK interacting protein/kinase inhibitory protein) family. The INK4 family (p16Ink4a, p15Ink4b, p18Ink4c, and p19Ink4d) inhibits only CDK4 and CDK6, whereas the Cip/Kip family (p21Cip1, p27Kip1, and p57Kip2) inhibits all CDKs functioning during the progression of the G1/S phase. There are convincing lines of evidence addressing the importance of the Cip/Kip family proteins in the proliferation and/or differentiation of cells. Compared with the tremendous progress in the p21Cip1and p27Kip1 studies, much less is known about the role of p57Kip2 in the cell cycle. Interestingly, only p57Kip2 is shown to be essential for mouse embryogenesis (3Zhang P. Liegeois N.J. Wong C. Finegold M. Hou H. Thompson J.C. Silverman A. Harper J.W. DePinho R.A. Elledge S.J.

Gene ( Amst .). 2000; 247: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Thus, it is of interest to explore the relationship between p57Kip2 expression and cell proliferation under physiological circumstances. However, p57Kip2 is hard to study due to its low expression level in many cells. We recently found that p57Kip2 accumulates in rat osteoblastic cells when arrested by serum starvation. Furthermore, TGF-β1 that stimulates proliferation of osteoblastic cells induces rapid degradation of p57Kip2 through the proteasome-dependent pathway (5Urano T. Yashiroda H. Muraoka M. Tanaka K.

TGF-β exerts its effect via two types of serine/threonine kinase receptors: TGF-β binds first to the type II receptor, which consequently activates the type I receptor by direct association. Signals from the activated type I receptor are known to be transmitted into the nucleus through various mediator molecules. Among these, the best characterized molecules are a family of proteins termed Smad (reviewed in Refs. 9Derynck R. Zhang Y. Feng X.H.

To date, eight different Smads have been identified in mammals, and these are classified into three subgroups, i.e. the receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads), the common-partner Smads (Co-Smads), and the inhibitory Smads (I-Smads). R-Smads are directly phosphorylated by type I receptors, then complexed with Co-Smads, and ultimately translocate into the nucleus. The R-Smad/Co-Smad heterooligomers are capable of binding to DNA directly or indirectly via other DNA-binding proteins and thus regulate positively or negatively the transcription of a multitude of target genes. In contrast, I-Smads inhibit the phosphorylation of R-Smads by activated type I receptors by interfering with their association, leading to prevention of the assembly of R-Smads with Co-Smads. In the TGF-β signaling pathway, Smad2 and Smad3 function as R-Smads, Smad4 as a Co-Smad, and Smad7 as an I-Smad (9Derynck R. Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Cell. 1998; 95: 737-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar, 10Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.-H. Adv.

In the present study, we examined whether or not the Smad pathway is responsible for the accelerated degradation of p57Kip2 in mouse osteoblastic cells treated with TGF-β1. To this end, we used adenovirus-based vectors able to obtain high efficiencies of transfection in primary cell culture for expressions of various mediator proteins which are known to locate downstream of TGF-β1 signaling. We report here that proteasomal degradation of p57Kip2 in osteoblastic cells derived from the calvariae of newborn mice treated by TGF-β1 is mediated by Smad proteins and that the TGF-β1-induced p57Kip2 proteolysis is regulated at the transcriptional level. Sources of materials were as follows: recombinant human TGF-β1 (R & D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN); MG132 (Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-aldehyde; Peptide Institute, Inc., Osaka, Japan); actinomycin D and α-amanitin (Sigma); α-minimal essential medium (α-MEM; Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY); fetal calf serum (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS); antibiotics-antimycotic (Life Technologies, Inc.; 100 units/ml of penicillin G, 100 units/ml of streptomycin, 0.1 μg/ml of amphotericin B); mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Berkeley Antibody Co., Richmond, CA); mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma). Polyclonal antibodies against mouse p27Kip1 and p57Kip2 were raised in rabbits using synthetic peptides corresponding to the C-terminal amino acids of each protein (5Urano T. Yashiroda H. Muraoka M. Tanaka K. Hosoi T. Inoue S. Ouchi Y. Toyoshima H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12197-12200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Primary mouse osteoblastic cells were isolated from calvariae of 1-day-old mice, strain ddY, by sequential enzymatic digestion as described previously (12Wong G.L. Cohn D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 3167-3171Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 13Ishizuya T. Yokose S. Hori M. Noda T. Suda T. Yoshiki S. Yamaguchi A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2961-2970Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The cells prepared from calvariae by enzymatic digestion are composed of heterogeneous cell populations, but they express various osteoblastic phenotypes including the ability to form bone nodulesin vitro, and are useful for examining sequential changes of phenotypes occurring during osteoblast differentiation, as reported before (13Ishizuya T. Yokose S. Hori M. Noda T. Suda T. Yoshiki S. Yamaguchi A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2961-2970Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The cells were cultured in α-MEM containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and antibiotics-antimycotic. Cells at the second passage were frozen to stock for each experiment. After thawing the cells, 5 × 104 cells in 6-well plastic plate or 2 × 104 cells in 12-well plate were cultured with α-MEM containing 10% FCS for 16 h. The culture medium was then changed into α-MEM containing 0.5% FCS, and the cells were cultured under serum starvation for 48–72 h before TGF-β1 treatment or viral infection. To obtain a high transfection efficiency in primary osteoblastic cell cultures, we used a recombinant adenovirus system. Recombinant adenoviral vectors carrying hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged human TGF-β type I receptor (ALK-5), FLAG-tagged Smads, and β-galactosidase (LacZ) cDNAs were constructed as described previously (14Fujii M. Takeda K. Imamura T. Aoki H. Sampath T.K. Enomoto S. Kawabata M. Kato M. Ichijo H. Miyazono K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3801-3813Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Infection of the recombinant adenoviruses was performed at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 50–100 plaque forming units/cell. More than 80% of the cells were infected as determined by staining of the cells for β-galactosidase. The expression of recombinant proteins with these adenoviruses was obtained at the peak about 3 days after infection, so we cultured osteoblastic cells for 3 or 4 days after viral infection prior to use. Osteoblastic cells were treated with MG132 (Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-aldehyde) at a final concentration of 2.5 μm for 12 h prior to harvesting of cells to avoid cell toxicity. Cells were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed directly in SDS sample buffer. The lysates were sonicated briefly and clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. For immunoblot analysis, the samples were separated on 12.5% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were then electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P; Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), immunoblotted with respective antibodies, and visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Renaissance; PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA). Serum starved osteoblastic cells in 35-mm dishes were labeled for 16 h with 70 μCi/ml [35S]Met and [35S]Cys (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) in α-MEM without methionine/cystein (Sigma) containing 0.5% FCS, then chased with α-MEM containing 0.5% FCS with 0.4 mg/ml methionine for the time periods indicated in the presence or absence of TGF-β1 (1 ng/ml). Cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer as described previously (5Urano T. Yashiroda H. Muraoka M. Tanaka K. Hosoi T. Inoue S. Ouchi Y. Toyoshima H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12197-12200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and the soluble extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with polyclonal anti-p57Kip2 antibody. The resulting immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography, and the p57Kip2 band was quantified with an image analyzer (Fujix BAS 2000). Total cellular RNAs from cultured cells were extracted using TRIZOL reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). These RNAs were electrophoresed on 1.2% agarose formaldehyde gels and transferred onto nylon membrane filters (Nytran 0.45; Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, NH). Hybridization and washing the filters were carried out as described previously (15Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7267) Google Scholar). The cDNA probe for a 377-base pair SmaI-HindIII fragment from mouse p57Kip2 was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the multiprime labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Previously, we reported that p57Kip2 was degraded by TGF-β1 stimulation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway using rat osteoblastic cells (5Urano T. Yashiroda H. Muraoka M. Tanaka K. Hosoi T. Inoue S. Ouchi Y. Toyoshima H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12197-12200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To further explore the mechanism of TGF-β1 signaling for p57Kip2 proteolysis, we used various adenovirus vectors carrying Smad cDNAs and osteoblastic cells isolated from the calvariae of newborn mice (14Fujii M. Takeda K. Imamura T. Aoki H. Sampath T.K. Enomoto S. Kawabata M. Kato M. Ichijo H. Miyazono K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3801-3813Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). At first, we tested whether or not TGF-β1 induces p57Kip2 degradation in the mouse osteoblastic cells as in rat cells. As shown in Fig.1, p57Kip2 accumulated in serum-starved mouse osteoblastic cells. Treatment with TGF-β1 resulted in almost complete loss in the cellular level of p57Kip2 during 16–24 h. On the other hand, p27Kip1 remained unchanged irrespective of TGF-β1 stimulation, although its cellular level slightly increased due to serum deprivation. Furthermore, addition of a proteasome inhibitor MG132 blocked the reduction of p57Kip2 caused by TGF-β1 without affecting the p57Kip2 level in the absence of TGF-β1 (Fig.2), suggesting that TGF-β1 induces the instability of p57Kip2. To confirm directly this assumption, we conducted pulse-chase analysis. As shown in Fig.3, endogenous [35S]p57Kip2 metabolically labeled with [35S]Met and [35S]Cys under serum-starved conditions was rapidly disappeared with an apparent half-life of 8–10 h when cells were cultured in the presence of TGF-β1, whereas [35S]p57Kip2 was fairly stable without treatment with TGF-β1, indicating that TGF-β1 certainly promotes the degradation of p57Kip2. MG132 treatment of these cells also appreciably increased the p27Kip1 level (Fig. 2), which is consistent with previous reports that the degradation of p27Kip1 is processed in a proteasome-dependent manner in a variety of cells (16Carrano A. Eytan E. Hershko A. Pagano M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar).Figure 3Pulse-chase analysis of endogenous p57Kip2 in osteoblastic cells. Cells were cultured in serum-starved media containing [35S]Met and [35S]Cys for 16 h, then chased in the presence or absence of TGF-β1 (1 ng/ml) as a function of time. The immunoprecipitated [35S]p57Kip2 was subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (upper panel). Relative intensities of p57Kip2 bands determined with an image analyzer are shown (lower panel). The data show typical results of three independent experiments which were essentially the same.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test whether TGF-β1 affects the synthesis of p57Kip2, we measured the mRNA level of p57Kip2 after TGF-β1 stimulation by Northern blot analysis. As shown in Fig.4, the amount of p57Kip2mRNA slightly decreased after 24 h and thus TGF-β1 may decrease the p57Kip2 synthesis, affecting partly the level of p57Kip2 in osteoblastic cells. In addition, the possibility that TGF-β1 also regulates p57Kip2 at the translational level cannot be completely ruled out. Nevertheless, considering almost complete loss of cellular p57Kip2 level upon TGF-β1 stimulation, it is clear that TGF-β1 predominantly regulates p57Kip2 proteolysis by the proteasome pathway. It is conceivable that TGF-β1 binds first to the type II receptor, which consequently activates the type I receptor (6Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3346) Google Scholar, 7Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3986) Google Scholar, 8Massague J. Chen Y.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 627-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of seven different type I receptors of the TGF-β superfamily (originally termed activin receptor-like kinase (ALK)-1 to ALK-7), ALK-5 is the type I receptor for TGF-β (17Franozen P. ten Dijke P. Ichijo H. Yamashita H. Schulz P. Heldin C.-H. Miyasono K. Cell. 1993; 75: 681-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar, 18ten Dijke P. Yamashita H. Ichijo H. Franzen P. Laiho M. Miyazono K. Heldin C.-H. Science. 1994; 264: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next examined whether a constitutively active form of ALK-5 operates the down-regulation of p57Kip2 in osteoblastic cells. Replacement of Thr at position 204 in ALK-5 by acidic amino acids such as Asp (termed ALK-5(TD)) leads to constitutive activation of the type I receptor without ligands or type II receptor (19Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Massague J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2199-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Thus, we expressed HA-tagged ALK-5(TD) using an adenoviral vector in serum-starved osteoblastic cells. As shown in Fig. 5 (upper panel), p57Kip2 was decreased, depending on the increment of the ALK-5(TD) protein (lower panel), and disappeared after 72 h viral infection. However, no obvious change in the p57Kip2 level was found in the osteoblastic cells infected with control vector that carries a β-galactosidase (LacZ) cDNA or nothing. The level of p27Kip1 remained unchanged, irrespective of the expression of the ALK-5(TD) protein (Fig. 5, middle panel). Thus, it was concluded that p57Kip2 is surely degraded through the downstream signaling pathway of the TGF-β type I receptor. To date, it becomes clear that the Smad family proteins are involved in the signaling pathway evoked by the TGF-β type I receptor (9Derynck R. Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Cell. 1998; 95: 737-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar, 10Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.-H. Adv. Immunol. 2000; 75: 115-157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Wrana J.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 189-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether Smad-mediated transcription accelerates the instability of p57Kip2. The activated TGF-β type I receptor, ALK-5 phosphorylates R-Smads, such as Smad2 and Smad3, whereas an I-Smad, such as a Smad7, interferes with the phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 by preventing their interaction with ALK-5. If the Smad pathway is involved in the down-regulation of p57Kip2, I-Smad would suppress the reduction of p57Kip2 induced by TGF-β1. When mouse osteoblastic cells were infected with the adenoviruses carrying the Smad7 cDNA prior to TGF-β1 treatment, the signal-dependent breakdown of p57Kip2 was considerably inhibited (Fig.6 A). In addition, the similar expression of Smad7 also prevented the decrease in p57Kip2induced by ALK-5(TD) (Fig. 6 B). However, the p27Kip1 level showed no significant change in these conditions. As mentioned before, Smad7 competes with Smad2 and Smad3 for its binding to activated ALK-5; thus the inhibitory effect of Smad7 suggests the involvement of Smad2 and/or Smad3 in the destabilization of p57Kip2. Therefore, we examined the effects of Smad2 or Smad3 with Smad4 (Co-Smad), a partner molecule collaborating with R-Smad in the presence or absence of Smad7 on the instability of p57Kip2. In this experiment, a low concentration of TGF-β1 incapable of promoting p57Kip2 proteolysis (Fig.7, left lane) was added for 24 h after viral infection, which might be required for phosphorylation of expressed Smad2 and Smad3. When Smad2 or Smad3 was coexpressed with Smad4, p57Kip2 disappeared in the osteoblastic cells infected with adenoviruses carrying these Smads (Fig. 7). The forced expression of Smad7 prevented the decrease in the p57Kip2 level induced by coexpressions of Smad2 or Smad3 with Smad4. No significant change in the p57Kip2level was observed in the control expressing LacZ. These results strongly indicate that the degradation of p57Kip2 by TGF-β1 is mediated through the Smad2/4 or Smad3/4 pathway. In contrast, the p27Kip1 level remained unchanged, irrespective of coexpression in any given combinations of Smads (Fig.7). To further test whether Smad-mediated transcription is regulated for p57Kip2 degradation, we tested the effect of several transcription inhibitors. When osteoblastic cells were treated with actinomycin D for 24 h in the absence of TGF-β1, the p57Kip2 level was not affected, however, the TGF-β1-induced degradation of p57Kip2 was blocked (Fig.8 A), implying that a protein(s) newly synthesized by TGF-β1 stimulation is involved in the proteolytic elimination of p57Kip2. The similar suppressive effect for the TGF-β1-induced decrease of p57Kip2 was observed by treatment with another transcription inhibitor, α-amanitin (Fig. 8 B). Considering the fact that the p57Kip2 level remained unchanged for 24 h during exposure to actinomycin D or α-amatinin (Fig. 8), p57Kip2is found to be apparently stable without TGF-β1 stimulation (see “Discussion”). This also indicates that the disappearance of p57Kip2 by TGF-β1 treatment is not attributed to the down-regulation of the p57Kip2 production. Taken together, these results suggest that Smad-mediated transcription is involved in the induction of p57Kip2 proteolysis, which may play an essential role in the growth control of osteoblastic cells in vivo. On the other hand, actinomycin D or α-amatinin caused disappearance of p27Kip1, irrespective of TGF-β1 stimulation (Fig. 8). These results indicate that p27Kip1, unlike p57Kip2, are rapidly turned over. Previously, we reported that TGF-β1 causes rapid degradation of p57Kip2 in osteoblastic cells isolated from the calvariae of rat fetuses that had been serum-starved to induce the cellular p57Kip2 level (5Urano T. Yashiroda H. Muraoka M. Tanaka K. Hosoi T. Inoue S. Ouchi Y. Toyoshima H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12197-12200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The process was inhibited by various proteasome inhibitors, such as lactacystin and MG132, and a polyubiquitylation of p57Kip2 was detected in an in vitro assay using TGF-β1-treated cell extracts, strongly indicating that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway operates in the degradation of p57Kip2. In the present work, first, we observed the proteasomal degradation of p57Kip2 in mouse osteoblastic cells induced to proliferate by TGF-β1 (Figs. 1 and 2). Thus, the TGF-β1-dependent selective degradation of p57Kip2 in mouse osteoblastic cells was essentially the same as rat cells, except that the degradation of p57Kip2in the latter cells was considerably faster compared with that in former cells for unknown reasons. Second, we found that this effect of TGF-β1 is mediated by the TGF-β type I receptor, because forced expression of the constitutively active form of the TGF-β type I receptor ALK-5(TD) resulted in the accelerated degradation of p57Kip2analogous to TGF-β1 stimulation (Fig. 5), and because one member of the I-Smads, Smad7, blocked its degradation induced by TGF-β1 or ALK-5(TD) (Fig. 6). Third, we observed a stimulatory effect on the down-regulation of p57Kip2 when Smad2 or Smad3 was expressed simultaneously with Smad4 under the low concentration of TGF-β1 (Fig. 7). We also observed that Smad7 greatly suppressed the down-regulation of p57Kip2 induced by coexpressions of Smad2 or Smad3 with Smad4. These findings strongly indicate that the Smad pathway mediates the degradation of p57Kip2 in osteoblastic cells stimulated to proliferate by TGF-β1. However, the possibility that the TGF-β type I receptor also activates Smad-independent pathways, i.e. extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase/serum-activated protein kinase, and p38 MAP kinase pathways (20Hartsough M.T. Mulder K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7117-7124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 21Atfi A. Djelloul S. Chastre E. Davis R. Gespach C. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1345-1356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to cause p57Kip2 degradation cannot be completely excluded, because we have not yet examined the effect of the compounds capable of inhibiting these pathways. Nonetheless we favor the idea that the Smad pathway plays a central role in the destabilization of p57Kip2, because coexpression of R-Smad2/3 and Co-Smad4 mimicked the effect of TGF-β1 treatment causing loss of p57Kip2 and because loss of p57Kip2 induced by these R- and Co-Smads, like TGF-β1 stimulation, was suppressed by I-Smad, Smad7. In the present experimental conditions, we have added a low concentration of TGF-β1 (0.03 ng/ml) that was insufficient to induce p57Kip2proteolysis for activation of Smad2 and Smad3. Thus, Smad7 blocks competitively for the binding of Smad2 or Smad3 to the activated TGF-β type I receptor, although the possibility that Smad7 directly suppresses the binding of Smad2 or Smad3 to Smad4 cannot be completely ruled out. Whatever Smad7 acts, it is clear that the Smad pathway is involved in p57Kip2 proteolysis induced by TGF-β1. Finally, we found that the TGF-β1-induced degradation of p57Kip2 was abrogated by actinomycin D (Fig. 8 A) or α-amanitin (Fig. 8 B), which had no effect on the p57Kip2 level per se. The effect of these transcriptional inhibitors is quite interesting in considering the mechanistic insights of how TGF-β1 accelerates the degradation of p57Kip2. It is well known that the TGF-β/Smad signaling system acts as transcriptional factors capable of activating a diverse spectrum of target genes (9Derynck R. Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Cell. 1998; 95: 737-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar, 10Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.-H. Adv. Immunol. 2000; 75: 115-157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Wrana J.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 189-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). According to this scenario, a newly synthesized protein(s) may affect the stability of p57Kip2. For this, two possible mechanisms can be considered. One possibility is that the presumptive new protein may modify the p57Kip2protein, which directs p57Kip2 to the ubiquitin-proteasome machinery. To date, various signals are known to act as a degradation signal for a multitude of cellular proteins (reviewed in Ref. 25Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6902) Google Scholar). Indeed there is accumulating evidence addressing the importance of phosphorylation of most target molecules involved in the cell-cycle progression or signal transduction, such as p27Kip1, cyclin E, IκB, and β-catenin, as a prerequisite for their ubiquilation and subsequent proteasomal degradation (reviewed in Refs. 26Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E5-E7Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 27Deshaies R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 435-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar, 28Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that p57Kip2 is also phosphorylated prior to its ubiquilation, although phosphorylation of p57Kip2 has not yet been reported so far. Moreover, to our knowledge, there is no available information that p57Kip2is modified post-translationally in other ways, such as acetylation or oxidation. Further study is required to clarify whether p57Kip2 is actually modified in response to TGF-β1 stimulation. The other possibility is that the degradation machinery itself may be activated by Smad-mediated transcription. In the ubiquilation pathway, ubiquitin-protein ligase, E3, plays an important role in the selection of proteins for degradation, because it specifically binds to the protein substrate (25Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6902) Google Scholar, 26Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E5-E7Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 27Deshaies R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 435-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar, 28Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that the newly induced protein by TGF-β1 might belong to E3, which selectively targets p57Kip2 for ubiquilation. Consistent with this notion, recently it was reported that an F-box protein acting as a substrate recognition module of a large multisubunit ubiquitin-ligase called SCF (skp1-cdc53 or a cullins-F-box protein complex) is extremely unstable and regulated at transcriptional level (29Zhou P. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 571-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 30Galan J.M. Peter M. Proc. Natl. Acad. SCI. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9124-9128Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 31Wirbelauer C. Sutterlüty H. Blondel M. Gstaiger M. Peter M. Reymond F. Krek W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5362-5375Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In other cases, for example, the anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome E3·ligase complex is known to be controlled by phosphorylation during the M-phase traverse of the cell cycle (32Zachariae W. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2039-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Therefore, TGF-β1 may affect the activity of a specific E3 capable of ubiquilating p57Kip2. To determine the mechanism underlying this hypothesis, it is essential to search for the E3-ligase responsible for ubiquilation of p57Kip2, which is in progress. It is noteworthy that the level of p57Kip2 is very low in proliferating osteoblastic cells, but serum deprivation caused its dramatic accumulation (Ref. 5Urano T. Yashiroda H. Muraoka M. Tanaka K. Hosoi T. Inoue S. Ouchi Y. Toyoshima H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12197-12200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar and this study). The exposure of TGF-β1 to such nongrowing cells induces down-regulation of p57Kip2, strongly indicating the importance of p57Kip2 proteolysis in regulating proliferation and possible differentiation of osteoblastic cells. This notion is also supported by the findings that MG132 prevented the TGF-β1-induced loss of p57Kip2 (Fig. 2) and TGF-β1 had a little effect on the level of the p57Kip2 mRNA (Fig. 4), indicating that TGF-β1 affects primarily the degradative process of p57Kip2. Moreover, actinomycin D or α-amanitin showed no appreciable alteration of the level of p57Kip2 without TGF-β1 stimulation, suggesting that p57Kip2 is fairly stable under nondividing conditions (Fig. 8). This assumption was ascertained by pulse-chase analysis of metabolically labeled [35S]p57Kip2. p57Kip2 did not disappear appreciably in the absence of TGF-β1, while it was rapidly degraded with an apparent half-life of 8–10 h under the presence of TGF-β1 in osteoblastic cells (Fig. 3). On the other hand, the level of p27Kip1 was unaffected in TGF-β1 stimulation and was reduced by treatment with actinomycin D or α-amanitin irrespective of treatment with TGF-β1, indicating that turnover of p27Kip1 is rapid in osteoblastic cells (Fig.8). Our results also indicate that regulatory mechanisms for these two CKIs, p27Kip1 and p57Kip2, considerably differ in osteoblastic cells. However, serum starvation also caused accumulation of p27Kip1 to a lesser extent (Fig. 1), indicating that it may somehow be involved in the growth control of osteoblastic cells. TGF-β provides a variety of signals for numerous cells and interestingly often exerts apparently contradictory effects, depending on the type of cells (6Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3346) Google Scholar, 7Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3986) Google Scholar, 8Massague J. Chen Y.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 627-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For instance, it mainly suppresses the growth in many epithelial cells, but promotes it in certain cells, such as osteoblastic cells. The mechanism of these diverse effects remains unknown, but it could be due to how the regulatory factors that positively (e.g. CDKs) and negatively (e.g. CKIs) drive the cell-cycle progression are induced by the TGF-β signaling. However, the details are still unknown at present. Notably, TGF-β, which is locally produced by osteoblasts and accumulated abundantly in bone matrix, is thought to have important roles in bone remodeling (33Robey P.G. Young M.F. Flanders K.C. Roche N.S. Kondaiah P. Reddi A.H. Termine J.D. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 457-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). It is worth noting that, among the gene knockout studies of the Cip/Kip family proteins, only p57Kip2-deficient mice showed developmental abnormalities (3Zhang P. Liegeois N.J. Wong C. Finegold M. Hou H. Thompson J.C. Silverman A. Harper J.W. DePinho R.A. Elledge S.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 4Yan Y. Frisen J. Lee M.H. Massague J. Barbacid M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 973-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Abnormalities shown in these mice include short limbs, a defect attributable to abnormal endochondral ossification, which may be caused by delayed cell-cycle exit during chondrocyte differentiation. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that p57Kip2 can be involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation of cells of a certain cell lineage, including osteoblasts and chondrocytes. In considering these in vivo roles of p57Kip2, the new regulatory system of p57Kip2 by TGF-β signaling linked to proteolysis sheds new light on the mechanisms underlying the development and/or differentiation of osteoblasts and perhaps certain other cells in vivo. We are grateful to all members of the Tanaka laboratory for helpful advice and discussion."

Chem. 1973; 248: 3940-3945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) intermediates in Pol-P synthesis, inhibiting both chain elongation and dephosphorylation reactions. Evolutionarily, there appear to be two independent families of isoprenyl diphosphate synthases, based on the type of stereochemistry (E or Z) introduced at the products' new double bond. E-Isoprenyl diphosphate synthases are capable of catalyzing the chain elongation of a range of substrates, the smallest one being dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP, C5) with IPP to form ω,E-geranyl diphosphate (ω,E-GPP, C10). Other short-chain isoprenyl diphosphates (ω,E,E-farnesyl diphosphate (ω,E,E-FPP, C15) andω,E,E,E-geranylgeranyl diphosphate (ω,E,E,E-GGPP, C20)) are generated by a similar mechanism with additional molecules of IPP. Medium-chain E-isoprenyl diphosphate synthases use the short-chain products as allylic substrates to produce compounds that are C30 to C50 in length. Medium-chain E-isoprenyl diphosphate synthases are homologous to the short-chain E-isoprenyl diphosphate synthases, because both types contain two signature aspartate motifs (DD(XX)1–2D). Thus far, only seven protein sequences have been biochemically correlated with Z-isoprenyl diphosphate synthase activity, including undecaprenyl diphosphate synthases from Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli, Hemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, the dolichol synthase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and the decaprenyl diphosphate and farnesyl diphosphate synthases from M. tuberculosis. Prior to the identification of theZ-farnesyl diphosphate (Z-FPP) synthase fromM. tuberculosis (9Schulbach M.C. Brennan P.J. Crick D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22876-22881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), all known Z-isoprenyl diphosphate synthases utilizedω,E,E-FPP orω,E,E,E-GGPP as the allylic substrate, added multiple units of IPP, and released long-chain (C45 and greater) isoprenyl diphosphate molecules with mixed stereochemistry (2Kellogg B.A. Poulter C.D.

However, little is known about Z-isoprenyl diphosphate synthases. We have purified and enzymatically characterized the short-chain Z-isoprenyl diphosphate synthase fromM. tuberculosis, which catalyzes the first committed step in the synthesis of decaprenyl diphosphate, a molecule whose role in cell wall synthesis is likely essential. All oxygen- and water-sensitive reactions (SchemeFS1) were performed under dry argon atmosphere. 1H NMR spectra of all compounds were obtained with a Varian Gemini 200 operating at 200 MHz in approximately 2% solution of CDCl3 or D2O, using Me4Si or Me3Si(CH2)3SO3Na as the internal standard. Column chromatographies were performed using 230- to 400-mesh silica gel (Merck) or reverse phase silica gel (Macherey-Nagel Polygosil 60-4063 C18). Mass spectra were recorded on a VG 70-25S mass spectrometer or an HP-5988 A spectrometer. Reagents and solvents were purchased from Aldrich or Fluka. ω,E-Geraniol 5 (2.0 g, 13 mmol) was added to a solution of N-hydroxyphthalimide (2.12 g, 13 mmol), triphenylphosphine (3.42 g, 13 mmol), and diethyl azodicarboxylate (2.25 ml, 14.3 mmol) in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (50 ml). After stirring for 18 h at room temperature, the solvent was evaporated and the residue was purified on silica gel, eluting with CH2Cl2-hexane (6:4). The appropriate fractions were combined and evaporated to give the intermediate 6(3.19 g, 82%) as a white solid.

Hydrazine monohydrate (0.69 ml, 14.22 mmol) was added to a solution of 6 (2.13 g, 7.11 mmol) in ethanol (200 ml), and the resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for 18 h. After filtration of the white solid formed, the solution was evaporated and the resulting crude residue was extracted with diethyl ether (3 × 100 ml). The diethyl ether was removed by evaporation to give 7 (1.09 g, 91%) as an oil, which was used for the next reactions without further purification. 1H NMR (CDCl3): δ 1.60 (s, 3H, CH3), 1.68 (s, 6H, 2 × CH3), 1.96–2.18 (m, 4H, 2 × CH2), 4.17 (d, 2H, J = 6.4 Hz, CH2), 5.05 (m, 1H, CH), 5.31 (t, 1H, J = 6.4 Hz, CH); MS m/e 170 (M+H)+.

The solvents were removed under reduced pressure and the solid residue was triturated with diethyl ether (3 × 130 ml), which was discarded. The residue was dissolved in water (30 ml) and acidified to pH 1 with HCl 6 m. The solution was then saturated with solid NaCl and extracted with CH2Cl2 (3 × 25 ml).

Open reading frame Rv1086 (26Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D. Gordon S.V. Eiglmeier K. Gas S. Barry III, C.E. Tekaia F. Badcock K. Basham D. Brown D. Chillingworth T.

Nature. 1998; 393: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (6402) Google Scholar) was initially cloned into a commercially available protein expression vector pTBY2 (New England BioLabs). However, due to the apparent toxic effects of the Rv1086 fusion protein to the E. coli cells harboring the plasmid, the coding sequence that encoded the complete insert/fusion was moved into a mycobacterial expression vector for expression in M. smegmatis. The following primers were designed to amplify open reading frame Rv1086 from M. tuberculosis H37Rv genomic DNA: 5′-GGTACATATGGAGATCATCCCCCCGCG-3′ and 5′-GTCCTGCGCTAGGGCCCCCTGCCGTAGCTG-3′. NdeI andSmaI restriction endonuclease sites were engineered into the above primer sequences respectively (underlined). The native stop codon was removed from the C-terminal primer to allow for an in-frame fusion with the intein/chitin binding domain coded in the vector pTBY2. PCR was performed on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences GeneAmp 2400 PCR system using Vent DNA Polymerase (New England BioLabs). The PCR products were digested with the restriction endonucleasesNdeI and SmaI, then ligated into pTBY2, which had been previously digested with the same enzymes. The ligation mixture was electroporated into E. coli-competent cells (XL-1 Blue, Stratagene). Cells containing plasmid were selected on LB agar (EM Science) containing ampicillin at a concentration of 100 µg/ml. Purified plasmid was subjected to restriction and sequence analysis. The resulting construct, pTBY2-Rv1086, was digested with the restriction endonucleases, NdeI and PstI (Life Technologies). The ∼2200-bp fragment contained the entire coding sequence for the fusion/insert. This was ligated into pVV16 (a gift from Dr. Varalakshmi Vissa, Colorado State University) and the resulting construct, named pIMP-Rv1086, was electroporated into competent M. smegmatis at 2.5 V, 800 ohms, 25 microfarads. Cells were allowed to recover in LB broth for 90 min and were plated on LB agar with kanamycin (20 µg/ml). A single colony was chosen to start a liquid culture in LB broth with kanamycin (20 µg/ml). The recombinant M. smegmatis strain containing vector pIMP-Rv1086 was grown to mid-log phase in LB broth with 20 µg/ml kanamycin. This genetic construct expressed the M. tuberculosis open reading frame Rv1086 with a C-terminal fusion to a chitin binding domain. Approximately 6 g (wet weight) of cells was harvested by centrifugation, washed with a 0.9% saline solution, and centrifuged again. The resulting pellet was resuspended in cell lysis and column buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100. The cells were disrupted by probe sonication on ice with a Sanyo Soniprep 150 sonicator (10 cycles of 60 s on and 90 s off), and the suspension was centrifuged at 20,000 × gfor 20 min. The pellet was discarded, and the supernatant was loaded onto a 0.8-ml column of chitin beads (New England BioLabs) that had been equilibrated with the same buffer. The expressed protein was eluted from the column essentially as described by the manufacturer, except that the cleavage buffer contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1% Triton, 150 mm NaCl, 30 mmdithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol. The eluted fractions were assayed for Z-FPP synthase activity, and the protein concentration was estimated using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). In vitro Z-FPP synthase assays, the enzymatic treatment of reaction products, and the analysis of products were done as described previously (9Schulbach M.C. Brennan P.J. Crick D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22876-22881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 27Fujii H. Koyama T. Ogura K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 712: 716-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Assays were conducted under conditions that were linear for time and protein concentration. In the metal ion dependence studies, the majority of the endogenous divalent cations were removed by incubating the enzyme preparation with Bio-Rex 70 200–400 mesh (sodium form, Bio-Rad) on ice for 20 min. The enzymatic activity was reduced to a basal level, but it was not completely abolished, indicating that residual divalent cations were present. To determine which divalent cations supported activity, CaCl2,MgCl2, MnCl2, or ZnCl2 were added to the assay mixtures at the indicated concentrations. In a separate experiment, 10 mm EDTA was added. To study the pH dependence of Z-FPP synthase activity, a broad-range buffer comprising 250 mm Tris-HCl, 125 mm MES, and 125 mm acetic acid was used. The pH was adjusted with tetraethylammonium hydroxide. Pig brain cytosol was prepared by homogenizing pig gray matter in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and 0.25 m sucrose using 18 passes of a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenates were centrifuged at 9000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was decanted and centrifuged at 142,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was decanted, divided into 1-ml aliquots, stored at −70 °C, and used as an enzyme source for theω,E,E-FPP synthase assays. The protein concentration was estimated with a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). The sources of all materials have been described previously (9Schulbach M.C. Brennan P.J. Crick D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22876-22881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) with some exceptions. Citronellyl diphosphate,ω,E,E-farnesyl diphosphate, andω,E-geranyl diphosphate were synthesized as described by Davisson et al. (28Davisson V.J. Woodside A.B. Poulter C.D. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 110: 130-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Authentic prenols and prenyl phosphates of various chain lengths were purchased from the Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences (Warsaw, Poland). ω,Z-Neryl diphosphate was a gift from Drs. J. S. Rush and C. J. Waechter (University of Kentucky). Z-FPP synthase was expressed in M. smegmatis as a fusion protein with a C-terminal chitin binding domain. Affinity chromatography on a chitin column permitted a simple one-step protein purification (New England BioLabs). After the cells were harvested and disrupted, the 20,000 × g supernatant was applied to the chitin column and washed. Subsequent elution with a dithiothreitol-containing buffer cleaved the Z-FPP synthase from the chitin binding domain via an internal intein site. The column eluate was collected and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis (Fig.1). The eluate was also assayed for [14C]IPP incorporation into butanol-extractable material with five different allylic primers, DMAPP (C5),ω,E-GPP (C10),ω,Z-neryl diphosphate (ω,Z-NPP; C10),ω,E,E-FPP (C15), andω,E,E,E-GGPP (C20). ω,E-GPP andω,Z-NPP were the only functional substrates (data not shown). Assays with the other allylic primers did not produce any detectable radioactive product. [14C]IPP incorporation into butanol-extractable material in assays primed withω,E-GPP or ω,Z-NPP was linear for at least 40 min (data not shown). The product of theω,E-GPP assay was analyzed for chain length and stereochemistry by TLC (Fig. 2), confirming that the protein fraction shown in Fig. 1 (lane 4) synthesized ω,E,Z-FPP. The product of the ω,Z-NPP assay was also analyzed by TLC, demonstrating the enzyme's ability to synthesize a C15 molecule, presumablyω,Z,Z-FPP (data not shown).Figure 2Chain-length and stereochemical analysis of [14C]IPP-radiolabeled product synthesized byZ-FPP synthase primed withω,E-GPP. The structures ofω,E,E-FPP,ω,Z,Z-FPP, andω,E,Z-FPP are shown in A. The latter two structures represent the possible products of Z-FPP synthase depending on which substrate (ω,E-geranyl diphosphate orω,Z-neryl diphosphate) is available to the enzyme. Isoprenyl diphosphate synthase activity was assayed in mixtures containing 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.9), 10 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.05 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3% Triton, X-100, 100 µm geranyl diphosphate, 30 µm[14C]isopentenyl diphosphate, and 60 µg of protein in a final volume of 50 µl. Reactions were incubated for 10 min, stopped by the addition of water saturated with NaCl, and extracted withn-butanol saturated with water. The extracted isoprenyl diphosphates were dephosphorylated with potato acid phosphatase and spotted on reverse phase TLC plates to determine chain length. The plates were developed in methanol:acetone (8:2, v/v). Products labeled with [14C]IPP were visualized by a Bioscan System 200 Imaging Scanner (Bioscan Inc.). Standard polyprenols were located with anisaldehyde spray reagent. Migration of the nonradioactive standard (F, ω,E,E-farnesol) is indicated by an arrow at the top of B. The material corresponding to farnesol was scraped from the reverse phase TLC plate and extracted as described previously (9Schulbach M.C. Brennan P.J. Crick D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22876-22881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The recovered farnesol was spotted onto a silica gel TLC plate and developed in toluene:ethyl acetate (7:3, v/v). Mixed isomers of farnesol (ω,E,E-farnesol andω,E,Z-farnesol) along with the product of the Rv1086 assay primed with geranyl diphosphate were loaded onto a Silica Gel 60 TLC plate (C, lane A). InC, lane B shows an autoradiogram of lane A (exposure 24 h).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Z-FPP synthase was absolutely dependent on the presence of divalent cation for activity, and addition of 10 mm EDTA abolished the enzymatic activity (Table I).Z-FPP synthase activity was supported by the addition of MgCl2 or MnCl2. The optimal concentration of MgCl2 and MnCl2 fell between 0.01 and 1.0 mm. Higher concentrations of MgCl2 (between 1.0 and 5.0 mm) reduced ("

Following proteolysis, PrPSc is trimmed to a fragment designated PrP 27–30. Both PrPSc and PrP 27–30 molecules tend to aggregate and precipitate as amyloid rods when membranes from prion-infected brain are extracted with detergents. Although prion rods were also shown to contain lipids and sugar polymers, no physiological role has yet been attributed to these molecules. In this work, we show that prion infectivity can be reconstituted by combining Me2SO-solubilized PrP 27–30, which at best contained low prion infectivity, with nonprotein components of prion rods (heavy fraction after deproteination, originating from a scrapie-infected hamster brain), which did not present any infectivity. Whereas heparanase digestion of the heavy fraction after deproteination (originating from a scrapie-infected hamster brain), before its combination with solubilized PrP 27–30, considerably reduced the reconstitution of infectivity, preliminary results suggest that infectivity can be greatly increased by combining nonaggregated protease-resistant PrP with heparan sulfate, a known component of amyloid plaques in the brain. We submit that whereas PrP 27–30 is probably the obligatory template for the conversion of PrPCto PrPSc, sulfated sugar polymers may play an important role in the pathogenesis of prion diseases.

We submit that whereas PrP 27–30 is probably the obligatory template for the conversion of PrPCto PrPSc, sulfated sugar polymers may play an important role in the pathogenesis of prion diseases. PrPSc, the abnormal isoform of PrPC, is the only known component of the prion, an agent causing fatal neurodegenerative disorders such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (1Prusiner S.B. Brain Pathol. 1998; 8: 499-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that prion diseases propagate by the conversion of PrPC molecules into protease-resistant and insoluble PrPSc molecules by a mechanism in which PrPScserves as a template (2Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 793-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Whereas some PrPSc may be insoluble in vivo (3Jeffrey M. Goodsir C.M. Bruce M.E. McBride P.A. Scott J.R. Halliday W.G. Neurosci. Lett. 1992; 147: 106-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), it is well documented that most PrPSc, as well as its protease-resistant core denominated PrP 27–30, precipitate into insoluble aggregates (also known as prion rods) when membranes from scrapie-infected brains are extracted with detergents such as sarkosyl (4Meyer R.K. McKinley M.P. Bowman K.A. Braunfeld M.B. Barry R.A. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2310-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). In addition to PrPSc, prion aggregates were shown to contain nonprotein components, which include sphingolipids as well as polysaccharides (5Stahl N. Baldwin M.A. Teplow D.B. Hood L. Gibson B.W. Burlingame A.L. Prusiner S.B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1991-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 6Appel T.R. Dumpitak C. Matthiesen U. Riesner D. Biol.

The traces of nucleic acids present in prion rods are believed to be too small to function as coding tools (8Kellings K. Meyer N. Mirenda C. Prusiner S.B. Riesner D. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 1025-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). No physiological role has ever been attributed to any nonprotein components of prion rods. Disruption of prion rods into detergent protein lipid complexes resulted in the retention of their protease resistance property concomitantly with an increase in their prion infectivity, suggesting that solubilized PrPSc is more infectious than the aggregated prion protein (9Gabizon R. McKinley M.P. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4017-4021Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Contrarily, disruption of prion rods by sonication and SDS resulted in a protease-sensitive PrP with complete loss of infectivity (10Riesner D. Kellings K. Post K. Wille H. Serban H. Groth D. Baldwin M.A. Prusiner S.B. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1714-1722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As opposed to methods to disrupt prion aggregates, we have recently introduced a new experimental procedure that results in the production of nonaggregated PrPSc or PrP 27–30 molecules by inhibition of the primary detergent-induced aggregation used for rod formation (11Shaked G.M. Fridlander G. Meiner Z. Taraboulos A. Gabizon R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17981-17986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). When membranes from brains of hamsters terminally ill with scrapie were incubated in the presence of Me2SO in addition to sarkosyl and subsequently applied to a sucrose density gradient, the protease-resistant PrP molecules (PrP 27–30) were divided between the light fractions, containing soluble or poorly aggregated PrP 27–30 molecules, and the heaviest fractions, containing insoluble and heavily aggregated PrP 27–30 molecules (11Shaked G.M. Fridlander G. Meiner Z. Taraboulos A. Gabizon R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17981-17986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Interestingly, when light and heavy fractions of such gradients, containing similar concentrations of protease-resistant PrP, were inoculated into hamsters, the infectivity of the light fractions was lower by more than 2 logs than the infectivity of the heavy fractions. Light fractions produced in parallel in the absence of Me2SO, which did not contain any detectable PrP, presented the same low infectivity as the Me2SO light fractions, suggesting that this residual infectivity was not due to the presence of Me2SO-solubilized PrP 27–30 molecules. We attribute the low infectivity present in both light fractions to the fact that the brain extracts were applied to the sucrose gradient from the top, and therefore some small prion aggregates, containing undetectable PrP 27–30, may not have sedimented. In this work, we investigated whether molecules other than protease-resistant PrP might have a physiological role in prion infectivity. To this effect, we combined the low infectious protease-resistant Me2SO-solubilized PrP described above with nonprotein components that remain in prion aggregates subsequent to denaturation and harsh protease digestion (NPHSc).1 In some experiments we substituted the NPHSc fraction for heparan sulfate, a known component of prion rods. Our results show that the addition of the deproteinized sedimented fraction (NPHSc) to low infectious solubilized protease-resistant PrP restores the prion infectivity to its original values. We therefore propose that in addition to PrPSc, prion infectivity may depend upon, or at least be largely facilitated by, the presence of other components of prion rods. Three hundred μl of 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 60% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline were loaded into centrifuge tubes adapted for the TLS-55 rotor of the TL 100 ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments) to form a zonal gradient. Normal or scrapie brain membranes (25 μl containing 15 μg/ml protein) were diluted with STE buffer (100 mm NaCl, 10 mmTris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA) containing 2% sarkosyl to a final volume of 240 μl. When appropriate, Me2SO (10%) was added to the brain extract and incubated for 16 h at 4 °C before the extract was loaded on top of the gradient and centrifuged in a TLS-55 tube ultracentrifuge (Beckman) at 55,000 rpm (gav = 100,000) for 1 h at 20 °C. Before immunoblotting with anti-PrP monoclonal antibody 3F4 (12Kascsak R.J. Rubenstein R. Merz P.A. Tonna DeMasi M. Fersko R. Carp R.I. Wisniewski H.M. Diringer H. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 3688-3693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), gradient samples of equal volume were collected and digested with proteinase K (PK, 40 μg/ml) for 60 min at 37 °C. The three top fractions of each gradient were pooled and denominated fraction L (light). The three pooled bottom fractions (H, heavy) were tested either directly or after a deproteination treatment that included the following: 1) denaturation with 4.5 m guanidium thiocyanate (GndSCN) (final concentration) for 15 min, 2) precipitation with methanol to wash out the GndSCN, 3) resuspension in 2% sarkosyl STE buffer before digestion with PK (100 μg/ml for 60 min at 37 °C) to form NPH (non protein heavy) fractions. To form the combined fractions, original samples (L, NPH, or HS (heparan sulfate)) were mixed at equal volumes and incubated for 16 h at 4 °C. Original samples as well as combinations (detailed in Fig. 2) were assayed for the presence of PrP and infectivity. All volumes of original samples were adjusted before inoculation to contain the same concentration of L or NPH samples present in the mixtures. 400 μl of the L ScMe2SO sample were incubated with bovine kidney heparan sulfate (Sigma) for 16 h (4 mg/ml) at 25 °C. The resulting fraction was denominated HS/L ScMe2SO. 400 μl of the NPHScsample were precipitated in methanol and resuspended in STE buffer before the addition of 25 units/ml of heparinase III (Sigma) for 16 h at 37 °C. The resulting sample was denominated NPH*. Five male Syrian hamsters, 4 weeks old, were inoculated intracerebrally with 50 μl of each of the samples to be tested for prion infectivity. Animals were tested daily. Prion titers were measured by monitoring the incubation period until the appearance of symptoms (13Prusiner S.B. Groth D.F. Cochran S.P. Masiarz F.R. McKinley M.P. Martinez H.M. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 4883-4891Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Before inoculation into hamsters, samples containing only L or H fractions were supplemented with 2% sarkosyl to retain similar concentrations of the components in the infectivity assay. 10% (w/v) of brain tissue from scrapie-infected hamsters (frozen at −80°c following flash freezing in liquid nitrogen) was homogenized in cold sucrose buffer (10 mm Tris, 0.3 m sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline). 2% sarkosyl was added to 50-μl samples before digestion with 40 μg/ml PK for 60 min at 37 °C. To compare the study groups, Anova and the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test were applied. In addition, multiple pairwise comparisons were performed using the Dunnett and Scheffe methods. The tests were performed using the SPSS for Windows computer program. Brain membranes from scrapie-infected and uninfected hamsters were extracted with sarkosyl in the presence and absence of Me2SO and, following an overnight incubation, applied to a 10–60% sucrose gradient as described (11Shaked G.M. Fridlander G. Meiner Z. Taraboulos A. Gabizon R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17981-17986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Gradient fractions were digested with PK and immunoblotted with αPrP monoclonal antibody 3F4 (Fig. 1 a). As can be seen in the figure, the light fraction prepared in the presence of Me2SO contained a considerable fraction of the total PrP 27–30. To assure that the concentration of PrP 27–30 present in the light fractions obtained with Me2SO was significantly higher than that present in the light fraction without Me2SO, we immunoblotted with an anti-PrP antibody several 10-fold dilutions of the Me2SO scrapie light fraction. As can be seen in Fig. 1 b, the concentration of PrP 27–30 in the Me2SO light fractions was at least 1000 times larger than its concentration in the light fraction produced without Me2SO. Fig. 2 presents the organization of the reconstitution experiments and the samples used for infectivity assays. The three first fractions (of 12), as well as the three last fractions of each sucrose gradient, were pooled and denominated L and H fractions, respectively. All gradient fractions were digested with 40 μg/ml PK at 37 °C for 60 min. Part of each H fraction was totally denatured with 4.5 m GndSCN and, after methanol precipitation, digested again with PK to produce the NPH fraction. Subsequently, L and NPH fractions from different sources (normal and scrapie-infected with and without Me2SO) were used to create the combined samples specified in Fig. 2. All samples to be evaluated for infectivity were precipitated by methanol (to remove traces of Me2SO) and resuspended into inoculation buffer (1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline) to contain PrP 27–30 at comparable concentrations (Fig.3 a). No protease-resistant PrP was detected in the NPHSc samples following the denaturation/protease digestion treatment (Fig. 3 a,lane 2). PrP 27–30 was also absent from the light samples produced in the absence of Me2SO, as well as in the NPHSc/LSc sample (Fig. 3 a,lanes 4 and 8). When the bioassays were completed, we also tested the brains of the animals inoculated with each sample for the concentration and electrophoretic pattern of PrP after PK digestion (Fig. 3 b). Although incubation times for the different samples varied widely (see TableI), the concentration of PrP 27–30, as well as the banding pattern of the protein, was the same regardless of the inocula administered to the hamsters. Histoblot analysis of all brains were also identical (data not shown). This suggests that the manipulations performed in this work did not produce a new prion strain. Although it was repeatedly shown that different strains of prions can be characterized by these parameters (14Kascsak R.J. Rubenstein R. Merz P.A. Carp R.I. Wisniewski H.M. Diringer H. J. Gen.

Althoughp < 0.05 (*) is considered significant enough in this kind of test, we also noted the extremely significant comparisons wherep was smaller than 0.001 (**). p values of 1 or close to 1 suggest similarity between samples. The disease incubation times for animals inoculated with similarly prepared samples in the different experiments were pooled in the general calculations because no statistically significant difference was found between them. We also calculated the titers (log ID50) from the median of disease incubation time as described (13Prusiner S.B. Groth D.F. Cochran S.P. Masiarz F.R. McKinley M.P. Martinez H.M.

However, because the accuracy of titers calculated from disease incubation times (in days) is a debatable issue, we based all the statistical analyses directly on the disease incubation times.

Whereas very high infectivity was present in the HScfraction, no infectivity whatsoever was observed when this fraction was first denatured with 4.5 m GndSCN and then digested with PK, resulting in the NPHSc fraction. These results indicate that the NPHSc fraction cannot convert in vivoPrPC into PrPSc, because even after a long incubation time (more than 300 days), no animals inoculated with these samples present any disease symptoms. Moreover, no traces of PrP 27–30 were observed in their brains even after 300 days (Fig. 3 a), suggesting that no subclinical infection was established in these animals. Preliminary experiments (data not shown) also suggest that NPHSc cannot convert PrPC to PrPSc in vitro, because the brain inoculation of combined fractions containing NPHSc and light fractions from normal hamsters without PK digestion (containing large quantities of PrPC) did not result in any disease symptoms or PrPSc accumulation after more than 300 days. As shown here and in our previous work (11Shaked G.M. Fridlander G. Meiner Z. Taraboulos A. Gabizon R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17981-17986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), whereas samples HSc and L ScMe2SO contained similar concentrations of PrP 27–30 (Fig. 3 a), only the aggregated fraction, HSc, presented high prion infectivity. This can be seen by comparing the titer, incubation time, and p values for both samples (Tables I and II). However, when the noninfectious NPHSc was incubated with the L ScMe2SO fraction to form the NPHSc/L ScMe2SO, infectivity was restored to the levels observed in the HScsamples. This was not the case for the NPHSc/LSc combination, suggesting that the presence of nonaggregated PrP 27–30 in the L ScMe2SO was essential for the restoration of prion infectivity. No increase in infectivity was detected when L ScMe2SO was combined with NPHN. This may imply that a putative second prion component is not present in normal brain. Although it may be so, it is more probable that such a second component needs to combine with protease-resistant PrP in a specific fashion to sediment into the heavy fractions of the sucrose gradient in significant quantities. One of the candidate molecules for a prion second component is HS. This sugar polymer was found in brain amyloid deposits of Alzheimer's disease as well as of prion diseases (19Snow A.D. Mar H. Nochlin D. Kimata K. Kato M. Suzuki S. Hassell J. Wight T.N. Am. J. Pathol. 1988; 133: 456-463PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, sulfated sugars seem to have an important role in the metabolism of PrPSc(20Shyng S.L. Lehmann S. Moulder K.L. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30221-30229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Molecules such as pentosan sulfate and low molecular weight heparin have been shown repeatedly to inhibit the production of PrPSc in scrapie-infected neuroblastoma cells (ScN2a cells). HS itself has been shown to either increase or reduce PrPSc accumulation in these cells, depending on the experimental setup (21Caughey B. Raymond G.J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 643-650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Gabizon R. Meiner Z. Halimi M. Ben Sasson S.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 157: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 23Caughey B. Brown K. Raymond G.J. Katzenstein G.E. Thresher W. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2135-2141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These molecules have also been shown to inhibit prion disease pathogenesis in vivo (24Ehlers B. Diringer H. J. Gen. Virol. 1984; 65: 1325-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 25Farquhar C.F. Dickinson A.G. J. Gen. Virol. 1986; 67: 463-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 26Ladogana A. Casaccia P. Ingrosso L. Cibati M. Salvatore M. Xi Y.G. Masullo C. Pocchiari M. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This suggests that sulfated sugars of specific size and properties may either help form prions or disrupt prion formation, probably depending on some kind of competition mechanism. To test whether one of the NPHSc components is an HS-like molecule, we digested the NPHSc fraction with heparanase in two of the reconstitution experiments, prior to its combination with the L ScMe2SO fraction. In the third experiment, we substituted HS for NPHSc. As can be seen in Fig. 4, the combined results of these three experiments suggest a role for HS in prion infectivity. Whereas the infectivity of the reconstituted sample containing heparanase-digested NPHSc(NPH Sc* / L ScMe2SO ) was higher than that of the light fractions presenting low infectivity, such as LSc or L ScMe2SO, it was significantly lower than the infectivity of both the HScand the NPHSc/L ScMe2SO fractions that present high infectivity (see Table II for pvalues). In addition, the HS/L ScMe2SO combined sample showed a considerably higher infectivity than the L ScMe2SO sample alone. In addition, the clinical features of the disease as well as the neuropathology of the animals infected with HS/L ScMe2SO were identical to those of the classical 263 strain in Syrian hamsters (data not shown and Ref. 27Kimberlin R.H. Walker C.A. J. Gen. Virol. 1986; 67: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), suggesting that the HS/L ScMe2SO sample did not contain a new prion strain. Extensive experiments are required to establish whether the effect of HS is unique or whether other sugar polymers, sulfated or not, may serve as the backbone of prion rods. The results presented here indicate that production of prion infectivity requires the presence both of protease-resistant PrP and of nonprotein components of prion rods and suggest that these components may well be sulfated sugar polymers. It remains to be established whether sulfated sugar polymers are indeed a fundamental component of prions or whether their function, although not essential, greatly facilitates prion propagation and the establishment of prion infection. Unsuccessful attempts to dissociate and reconstitute prion infectivity were performed years ago, even before PrPSc was identified as a necessary components for infectivity (28Michel B. Tamalet J. Bongrand P. Gambarelli D. Gastaut J.L. Rev. Neurol. ( Paris ). 1987; 143: 526-531PubMed Google Scholar). Prion infectivity could not yet be associated with protease-resistant PrP molecules produced by an array of in vitro conversion protocols (29Kocisko D.A. Come J.H. Priola S.A. Chesebro B.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11160-11164Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and has even been suggested to exist in the absence of detectable protease-resistant PrP in the inocula (32Lasmezas C.I. Deslys J.P. Robain O. Jaegly A. Beringue V. Peyrin J.M. Fournier J.G. Hauw J.J. Rossier J. Dormont D. Science. 1997; 275: 402-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). In view of our results presented here, which suggest both prion components are required, we suggest that prion infectivity can be transmitted by a few (and therefore undetected) molecules of PrPSc, if associated with the appropriate nonprotein components. Our results also open the way to a new line of in vitro conversion experiments, which may hopefully result in full in vitro production of prion infectivity. Whereas the function of PrPSc as a template in the PrPC to PrPSc conversion stands on solid grounds (33Pan K.M. Baldwin M. Nguyen J. Gasset M. Serban A. Groth D. Mehlhorn I. Huang Z. Fletterick R.J. Cohen F.E. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10962-10966Crossref PubMed Scopus (2046) Google Scholar), the pathological role of a putative second component is unclear. A possible role for any functional molecule present in the NPHSc fractions may be to anchor the PrPScmolecules associated with it to the appropriate target in the host. Without a polymer such as HS, most PrPSc molecules may be cleared from the brain before the PrPC to PrPScconversion reaction has been established in enough cells to establish a process of infection (34Safar J. Wille H. Itri V. Groth D. Serban H. Torchia M. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1157-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). The kind of sugar polymer used as rod backbone and anchor may play a role in modifying parameters of prion infectivity. The fact that sulfated sugar polymers such as HS may have a crucial function in prion structure and propagation suggests several plausible explanations of the fact that small sulfated sugar polymers such as pentosan sulfate were shown to inhibit the production of PrPSc in cells (21Caughey B. Raymond G.J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 643-650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Gabizon R. Meiner Z. Halimi M. Ben Sasson S.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 157: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). These molecules may compete with the sugar polymer functioning as prion component for the right cell targets to which the template PrPSc molecules should be docked. Otherwise, these molecules may compete with the prion sugar component for the binding of newly formed PrPSc molecules. Interestingly, polyamines were shown recently to inhibit PrPSc accumulation from ScN2a cells (35Supattapone S. Nguyen H.O. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Scott M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14529-14534Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). We suggest that these highly positively charged polymers may bind to the highly negatively charged sulfated sugars and thereby facilitate the clearance of newly formed and still nonaggregated protease-resistant PrP. The results presented here therefore provide an explanation of the fact that such disparate molecules as small sulfated sugar polymers and positively charged polymers may both prove effective in the treatment of prion diseases.

In parasites, GPIs also occur abundantly as free lipids (not anchored to proteins). GPIs exhibit a wide array of functions (8Ralton J.E. Milne K.G. Gunther M.L.S. Field R.A. Ferguson M.A.J. J. Biol.

GPIs from different species differ in the type of acyl/alkyl substituents and the presence of additional sugar moieties on third and/or first mannose and ethanolamine phosphate residues on the carbohydrate moiety, leading to a broad structural diversity that may relate to their diverse biological activity (3Ferguson M.A.J.

GPIs of P. falciparum have been shown to induce secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α and up-regulation of cell adhesion molecules (10Schofield L. Novakovic S. Gerold P. Schwarz R.T. McConville M.J. Tachado S.D. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1886-1896PubMed Google Scholar, 11Tachado S.D. Gerold P. McConville M.J. Baldwin T. Quilici D. Schwarz R.T. Schofield L. J.

Because P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes sequester in the microvascular capillaries of vital organs, the above process is expected to synergistically promote adherence of parasite-infected erythrocytes; this in turn potentiate proinflammatory immune responses in deep endothelium because of local high concentration of GPIs and other factors released by accumulated parasites, leading to organ dysfunction and life threatening pathological conditions. Thus, GPIs of P. falciparum have been identified as “pathogenicity factors” (13Schofield L. Hackett F. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). P. falciparum GPIs activate PTK and PKC pathways, which collaboratively regulate the NF-κB/reltranscription factors with the downstream expression of proinflammatory immune responses (10Schofield L.

The conserved glycan core of GPIs, Manα1–2Manα1–6Manα1–4GlcNα1–6myo-inositol, was reported to be the minimum structure involved in PTK activation, whereas the diacylglycerol moiety has been postulated to be an independent second messenger for the PKC activation (12Tachado S.D.

Although it has been predicted that a transmembrane receptor with a lectin-like property might be involved in GPI-mediated cell signaling (12Tachado S.D. Gerold P. Schwarz R. Novakovic S.

A. 1997; 94: 4022-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), the nature of the receptor and the sugar(s) involved in the receptor recognition has not been elucidated. The suggested involvement of membrane-bound GPI-phospholipase D in hydrolyzing GPI and thus allowing the DAG moiety to enter cells or GPI translocation across cell membrane by the action of a “flippase” to activate PKC remains speculative (12Tachado S.D.

Here, we studied the specific structural elements and nature of interaction involved and the mechanism of cell signaling in GPI-induced TNF-α secretion. The data show that a novel interaction mediates cell signaling and that the terminal fourth mannose and 1-acylglycerol residues are critical for GPI activity. Cell signaling is mediated by a previously unrecognized mode of outside-in signal transduction without inserting into cell membranes or internalization of GPIs.

The J774A.1 murine macrophage cell line (ATCC) was cultured as monolayers in DMEM with 10% FBS. For subculturing and cytokine induction, cells were detached by scraping. Freshly detached macrophages suspended in DMEM, 10% FBS were seeded in 96-well microtiter plates (2.5 × 106cells/well) and incubated at 37 °C. After 2 h, the nonadhered cells were removed, and cells were incubated with 200 μl of DMEM containing 10% FBS and varying amounts of GPIs, and other compounds added from stock solution in 80% ethanol, water, or Me2SO. Cells treated with organic solvents (0.1% final concentration) only were used as controls. For inhibition studies, the compounds were added 1 h prior to the addition of GPIs. The amount of TNF-α secreted was measured using a sandwich ELISA kit (R & D Systems). Macrophages in microtiter plates (2.5 × 106cells/well) were incubated with [3H]GlcN- or [3H]myristic acid-labeled GPIs (100,000 cpm each) in DMEM, 10% FBS for 6, 24, or 48 h. The culture supernatants were collected, and aliquots were counted for radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting. The cells were detached by trypsinization, centrifuged, and washed with DMEM. The combined washings and cells solubilized in 1% Triton X-100, 1% SDS were measured separately for radioactivity. Many parasitic protozoa, including P. falciparum, synthesize GPIs severalfold in excess of the amount required to anchor proteins to cell surfaces. These GPIs are likely to play major roles in membrane properties and the modulation of host immune responses. P. falciparum GPIs have been shown to elicit inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α (10Schofield L. Novakovic S. Gerold P. Schwarz R.T. McConville M.J. Tachado S.D. J.

To determine the structural feature(s) of parasite GPIs necessary for the induction of TNF-α and to identify the receptor on the host cells, GPIs were subjected to specific enzymatic and chemical degradations, and the products were purified and tested. The HPLC-purified GPIs (EtN-P-Man4-GlcN-acyl-IP-DAG, designated as Man4-GPI; retention time, 92 min) were treated with jack bean α-mannosidase and bee venom phospholipase A2 to obtain GPIs lacking the distal fourth mannose residue (EtN-P-Man3-GlcN-acyl-IP-DAG, Man3-GPI; HPLC retention time 92 min) and sn-2 fatty acid (EtN-P-Man4-GlcN-acyl-IP-MAG,sn-2 lyso-GPI; HPLC retention time 70 min), respectively (Fig. 1). Both enzymes converted >95% GPIs into their respective products (Fig. 1). The acylated-inositol carbohydrate moiety with and without the phosphate group on inositol (Man4-GlcN-acyl-IP and Man4-GlcN-acyl-Ino) and the carbohydrate moiety (OCH-CH2-P-Man4-AHM) that lacked the PI residue of GPIs were prepared by HF cleavage and nitrous acid deamination, respectively (Fig. 1). HPTLC indicated that these were >95% pure (Fig. 2 and not shown). The compound that lacked all three acyl substituents (EtN-P-Man4-GlcN-IP-G) was prepared by hydrolysis with ammonia in aqueous methanol. The identity of the above products was established by determining mannose content, by identifying the glycan core by specific degradative cleavage, and by analysis of products by HPTLC and mass spectrometry (16Naik R.S.

Gerold P. Schwarz R. Novakovic S. McConville M. Schofield L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4022-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Although it has been predicted previously that a lectin-type receptor is involved in the PTK activation by GPIs, the nature of the sugar residue and the receptor were not identified, and the mechanism of GPI interaction with macrophages was not established. In this study, we tested purified GPIs and various cleavage products of GPIs for the induction of TNF-α using murine macrophages. As reported previously (12Tachado S.D. Gerold P. Schwarz R. Novakovic S. McConville M. Schofield L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4022-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 16Naik R.S. Branch O.H. Woods A.S. Vijaykumar M. Perkins D.J.

Med. 2000; 192: 1563-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), Man4-GPI was able to elicit TNF-α secretion by macrophages (Fig. 3 A). However, in contrast to the previous report (12Tachado S.D. Gerold P. Schwarz R. Novakovic S. McConville M. Schofield L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4022-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), Man3-GPI was completely inactive, suggesting that the recognition of the terminal mannose residue by the macrophage is crucial for the biologic activity of GPIs (Fig. 3 A). In agreement with this observation, α-methyl mannoside, α-(1–2)-linked mannobiose, and soluble yeast mannan inhibited the ability of P. falciparumGPIs to induce TNF-α secretion by >95%, whereas α-methyl glucoside and α-methyl galactoside were not inhibitory (Fig.3 B). To determine whether the carbohydrate moiety of the parasite GPIs alone is sufficient for the production of TNF-α, macrophages were treated with HF-released carbohydrate moieties, Man4-GlcN-acyl-IP and Man4-GlcN-acyl-Ino, and with deacylated GPI, EtN-P-Man4-GlcN-IP-G. All three products failed to elicit TNF-α secretion (Fig. 3 A). In addition, they effectively inhibited the activity of GPIs (Fig.3 B). The parasite GPI precursor lipids extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), bovine liver and soybean PIs, dipalmitoylglycerol, and dioleoylglycerophosphate were also unable to elicit TNF-α secretion (Fig. 3 B and not shown). Together, these results suggested the critical involvement of the distal fourth mannose and the requirement of intact GPIs for the activity (12Tachado S.D. Gerold P. Schwarz R. Novakovic S. McConville M. Schofield L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4022-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in agreement with the previously reported involvement of PTK and PKC activation by P. falciparum GPIs in eliciting TNF-α secretion, genistein and GF 109203X, the inhibitors of the respective kinases (10Schofield L. Novakovic S. Gerold P. Schwarz R.T. McConville M.J. Tachado S.D. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1886-1896PubMed Google Scholar, 11Tachado S.D. Gerold P. McConville M.J. Baldwin T. Quilici D. Schwarz R.T. Schofield L. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1897-1907PubMed Google Scholar, 12Tachado S.D. Gerold P. Schwarz R. Novakovic S. McConville M. Schofield L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4022-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), blocked >90% of GPI activity (Fig. 3 B). Because the lipid moiety of GPIs is also critically required for GPI activity (see above), we examined whether the HNO2-released PI moiety, the parasite lipids extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1), bovine liver and soybean PIs, and diacylglycerols could block the activity of GPIs. Interestingly, none of these compounds could inhibit the GPI activity (Fig. 3 B). Furthermore, prior incubation of macrophages with Man3-GPI had no effect on the ability of Man4-GPI to elicit TNF-α production (Fig.3 B). These data suggest that initial recognition of the distal fourth mannose residue is critical for the interaction of the lipid moiety to activate the PKC pathway for productive cell signaling. Thus, the lipid moiety-induced activation of PKC (12Tachado S.D. Gerold P. Schwarz R. Novakovic S. McConville M. Schofield L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4022-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) must be tightly regulated and coupled to PTK activation by the recognition of the distal fourth mannose. In a previous study, sn-2 lyso-GPIs have been reported to be inactive (12Tachado S.D. Gerold P. Schwarz R. Novakovic S. McConville M. Schofield L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4022-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). However, in this study, structurally characterized sn-2 lyso-GPIs obtained by phospholipase A2-treated Man4-GPI were able to induce TNF-α secretion in a dose-dependent manner to levels similar to those of Man4-GPI (Fig.3 A). Thus, our data demonstrate that the sn-2 fatty acyl residue is not required and 1-monoacylglycerol moiety ofP. falciparum GPIs is sufficient for TNF-α induction. To determine whether recognition of P. falciparum GPIs by macrophages involves a mannose-specific receptor binding and/or uptake of GPIs, macrophages were incubated with radiolabeled GPIs, HF-released carbohydrate moiety, or deacylated GPIs. The distribution of these compounds between culture medium and cells was analyzed. About 98% of the radioactivity in intact GPIs was in the culture supernatants, and about 1–2% was associated with the cells. This could be due to nonspecific spontaneous insertion of GPIs into cell membranes, a known phenomenon (25Zhang F. Schmidt W.G. Hou Y. Williams A.F. Jacobson K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5231-5235Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 26Ilangumaran S. Robinson P.J. Hoessli D.C. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 163-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The HF-released carbohydrate moieties and deacylated GPIs remained exclusively in the culture medium. These results suggest that although the distal fourth mannose residue is critical for the activity, GPI is not bound or internalized by macrophages. In contrast, the macrophage mannose receptor binds and internalizes compounds containing terminal mannose residues (27Stahl P.D. Ezekowitz R.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 50-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 28Drickamer K. Fukuda M. Hindsgaul O. Molecular Glycobiology. Oxford University Press, New York1994: 51-87Google Scholar). These data taken together suggest that TNF-α production by P. falciparum GPIs is by unique interactions involving initial recognition of the distal fourth mannose residue by a mannose-specific component presumably localized in plasma membrane in association with PTK. In this study, highly purified GPIs from intraerythrocytic stageP. falciparum and structurally characterized components of GPIs were assessed for TNF-α induction in macrophages to define the active elements and the nature of receptor recognition. The data presented here show that both the carbohydrate and lipid moieties of GPIs are required for the activity. This is in agreement with previous findings that the induction of proinflammatory cytokine responses byP. falciparum and T. cruzi trypomastigote GPIs involve a dual requirement for the glycan and diacylglycerol moieties; the GPI glycan moieties alone could not elicit TNF-α secretion (12Tachado S.D. Gerold P. Schwarz R. Novakovic S. McConville M. Schofield L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4022-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar,15Almeida I.C. Camargo M.M. Procopio D.O. Silva L.S. Mehlert A. Travassos L.R. Gazzinelli R.T. Ferguson M.A.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1476-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Our study also identifies the critical requirement of the distal fourth mannose residue for GPI activity. Furthermore, contrary to the previous report (12Tachado S.D. Gerold P. Schwarz R. Novakovic S. McConville M. Schofield L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4022-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), the results described here show thatsn-2 lyso-GPIs obtained by phospholipase A2 treatment of the parasite GPIs are able to induce TNF-α production to a level comparable with that induced by intact GPIs. The distal fourth mannose is a necessary component of P. falciparum GPIs for signaling TNF-α production. The following data support this conclusion. 1) The removal of the distal fourth mannose residue completely abrogates the ability of the parasite GPIs to induce TNF-α secretion in macrophages. 2) α-Methyl mannoside, α-(1–2)-linked mannobiose, mannan, the carbohydrate moiety released from GPIs by HF, and deacylated GPIs all could effectively inhibit the ability of P. falciparum GPIs to elicit TNF-α secretion. 3) α-Methyl glucoside and α-methyl galactoside were completely noninhibitory. Together, these data establish that induction of TNF-α secretion by P. falciparum GPIs occurs by the recognition of the distal fourth mannose. This finding is in contrast to a previous report that P. falciparum Man3-GPI was also bioactive (12Tachado S.D. Gerold P. Schwarz R. Novakovic S. McConville M. Schofield L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4022-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The reason for the discrepancy is not clear. However, it is possible that the reported activity of Man3-GPI could be due to the presence of a significant amount of Man4-GPI association in Man3-GPI fraction. The requirement of the distal fourth mannose residue for theP. falciparum GPIs to induce TNF-α secretion agrees with the previously reported cytokine-inducing activity of T. cruzi trypomastigote mucin GPIs, which also contain unsubstituted fourth mannose (14Camargo M.M. Almeida I.C. Pereira M.E.S. Ferguson M.A. Travassos L.R. Gazzinelli R.T. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 5890-5901PubMed Google Scholar). The GPIs of T. cruzi trypomastigote mucin have been shown to be severalfold more active than the GPIs ofP. falciparum (15Almeida I.C. Camargo M.M. Procopio D.O. Silva L.S. Mehlert A. Travassos L.R. Gazzinelli R.T. Ferguson M.A.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1476-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). A comparison of the structures shows that, unlike P. falciparum GPIs, the GPIs of T. cruzi trypomastigote mucin contain distal fourth α-mannose as well as α-galactose residues linked to the first mannose. Therefore, it appears that the presence of α-galactose residues further potentiates interaction of T. cruzi GPIs for effective cell signaling. Leishmania mexicana glycoinositolphospholipids containing a 1-alkyl-2-acylglycerol moiety and the conserved glycan core with α-(1–3)mannose linked to the first mannose residue but lacking ethanolamine phosphate on the third mannose could not induce TNF-α production; however, these compounds could activate PTK (12Tachado S.D. Gerold P. Schwarz R. Novakovic S. McConville M. Schofield L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4022-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). By comparing these results with those from the GPIs of P. falciparum and T. brucei variant surface protein, it has been suggested that GPIs containing diacylglycerol but not those with 1-alkyl-2-acylglycerol can elicit cytokine production (12Tachado S.D. Gerold P. Schwarz R. Novakovic S. McConville M. Schofield L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4022-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). However, because GPIs from T. cruzi trypomastigote mucin with a 1-alky-2-acylglycerol residue can efficiently induce TNF-α production (15Almeida I.C. Camargo M.M. Procopio D.O. Silva L.S. Mehlert A. Travassos L.R. Gazzinelli R.T. Ferguson M.A.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1476-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), the presence of 1,2-diacylglycerol as opposed to 1-alkyl-2-acylglycerol moiety is not a crucial requirement for GPI activity. Not all GPIs containing terminal fourth mannose residue and 1,2-diacylglycerol or 1-alkyl-2-acylglycerol moiety can elicit TNF-α secretion in macrophages. As shown previously by Almeida et al. (15Almeida I.C. Camargo M.M. Procopio D.O. Silva L.S. Mehlert A. Travassos L.R. Gazzinelli R.T. Ferguson M.A.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1476-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), the GPI fraction of T. cruzi epimastigote mucin that contains unsubstituted fourth mannose, as in the case of active GPI fraction of trypomastigote mucin and P. falciparum GPIs, is completely inactive. Whereas P. falciparum GPIs and the active GPI fraction of T. cruzitrypomastigote both contain unsaturated acyl substituent at thesn-2 position (15Almeida I.C. Camargo M.M. Procopio D.O. Silva L.S.

Med. 2000; 192: 1563-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), the inactive GPI fraction of theT. cruzi trypomastigote mucin contains a saturated acyl substituent at sn-2; the inactive GPIs of epimastigote mucin have a ceramide moiety. Therefore, as in the case of the active trypomastigote mucin GPIs (15Almeida I.C. Camargo M.M. Procopio D.O. Silva L.S. Mehlert A. Travassos L.R. Gazzinelli R.T. Ferguson M.A.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1476-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), the unsaturated acyl group at thesn-2 position seems to be required for the activity of intact P. falciparum GPIs; however, P. falciparumGPIs lacking sn-2 acyl substituent are also fully active (see below). It has been reported previously that sn-2lyso-GPIs, obtained by the treatment of P. falciparum GPIs with phospholipase A2, were unable to induce cytokine secretion (12Tachado S.D. Gerold P. Schwarz R. Novakovic S. McConville M. Schofield L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4022-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). However, in our study, the HPLC-purified structurally characterized sn-2lyso-GPIs obtained from different GPI preparations were able to reproducibly elicit TNF-α at levels similar to those elicited by intact GPIs. The reason for this discrepancy is not known. However, our data suggest that P. falciparum GPIs lackingsn-2 acyl residue provide the necessary structural requirements for cell surface interactions. The mechanism of GPI-cell interaction in signaling is poorly understood. Previous studies have predicted a receptor-mediated GPI binding and insertion or internalization (12Tachado S.D. Gerold P.

Interestingly, in the present study, the P. falciparum GPIs were neither bound to plasma membranes nor internalized by macrophages. However, our data clearly indicate the critical participation of the terminal mannose residue. Although the signal transduction by the well known macrophage mannose receptor to elicit cytokine responses involves phagocytic or endocytic mechanism (29Herbert E. Biosci. Rep. 2000; 20: 213-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 30Murai M. Aramaki Y. Tsuchiya S. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1995; 57: 687-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 31Murai M. Aramaki Y.

Med. 1999; 189: 1961-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), our data suggest that neither of these processes was involved in the case of P. falciparum GPIs. Furthermore, because neither the PI moiety released by HNO2 nor Man3-GPI is able to inhibit the activity of Man4-GPI, the interaction of the acylglycerol moiety for PKC activation requires prior recognition of the terminal mannose residue of GPIs. Moreover, because GPIs were not inserted to cell membrane or internalized, the interaction of the GPI acyl moiety in cell signaling represents a novel mechanism that is likely to be tightly coupled to PTK activation. Further understanding of the details of these interactions might offer specific targets for malaria therapy."

We have applied a yeast expression system for human GALT to test the hypothesis that genotype will correlate with GALT activity measured in vitro and with metabolite levels and galactose sensitivity measured in vivo. In particular, we have determined the relative degree of functional impairment associated with each of 16 patient-derived hGALT alleles; activities ranged from null to essentially normal. Next, we utilized strains expressing these alleles to demonstrate a clear inverse relationship between GALT activity and galactose sensitivity. Finally, we monitored accumulation of galactose-1-P, UDP-gal, and UDP-glc in yeast expressing a subset of these alleles. As reported for humans, yeast deficient in GALT, but not their wild type counterparts, demonstrated elevated levels of galactose 1-phosphate and diminished UDP-gal upon exposure to galactose. These results present the first clear evidence in a genetically and biochemically amenable model system of a relationship between GALT genotype, enzyme activity, sensitivity to galactose, and aberrant metabolite accumulation. As such, these data lay a foundation for future studies into the underlying mechanism(s) of galactose sensitivity in yeast and perhaps other eukaryotes, including humans.

Impairment of human GALT (hGALT) results in the potentially lethal disorder classic galactosemia (2Holton, J. B., Walter, J. H., Tyfield, L. A.

Currently, most infants with classic galactosemia born in industrialized nations are detected in the neonatal period by mandated newborn screening procedures. Dietary restriction of galactose initiated early and maintained throughout life for these patients prevents the potentially lethal sequelae of the disorder. Unfortunately, despite treatment, the long term outcome for these patients is mixed; 85% of girls with galactosemia experience primary ovarian failure, and 30–50% of patients of both genders demonstrate learning disabilities and speech and/or motor dysfunction, among other complications (4Waggoner D.D. Buist N.R.M. Donnell G.N. J. Inherited Metab. Dis. 1990; 13: 802-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Although aberrant accumulation or depletion of key galactose metabolites, including gal-1-P, UDP-gal, galactitol, and others are hypothesized as underlying the observed complications (reviewed in Refs. 2Holton, J. B., Walter, J. H., Tyfield, L. A. (2000) inMetabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease (Scriver, C. R., Beaudet, A. L., Sly, S. W., Valle, D., Eds., A., Childs, B., Kinzler, K.

The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York1995: 967-1000Google Scholar), the biochemical mechanism of pathophysiology in galactosemia remains unknown. One of the fundamental questions with regard to classic galactosemia concerns the identification of predictive factors that might be used to distinguish those patients who will thrive long term from those who will experience complications. Waggoner et al. (4Waggoner D.D. Buist N.R.M. Donnell G.N. J. Inherited Metab. Dis. 1990; 13: 802-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar) addressed this issue a decade ago with an international retrospective questionnaire study and found no clear correlation between long term outcome and three of the most obvious candidate extrinsic factors: age at diagnosis, presence of neonatal complications before treatment, or strict dietary compliance. These data suggested that some intrinsic factor(s) might serve a predominant role in defining outcome. With regard to intrinsic factors, perhaps the most obvious is GALT genotype. The number of candidate mutations identified in patient alleles now exceeds 150, the majority of which are missense point mutations (5Tyfield L. Reichardt J. Fridovich-Keil J. Croke D.T. Elsas L.J. Strobl W. Kozak L. Coskun T. Novelli G. Okano Y. Zekanowski C. Shion Y. Boleda M.D. Hum. Mutat. 1999; 13: 417-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Indeed many if not most galactosemia patients studied are compound heterozygotes, further complicating the picture. Although most naturally occurring mutant alleles of hGALT have not been well characterized with regard to function, high sensitivity biochemical studies of large groups of ungenotyped patients have demonstrated clear biochemical heterogeneity in the patient population (6Ng W.G. Xu Y.-K Kaufman F.R. Lee J.E.S. Donnell G.N. Neonatal Screening in the Nineties.in: Wilcken B.

Donnell G.N. Ng W.G. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1995; 235: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Furthermore, differences in the prevalence of specific hGALT genotypes also have been observed in populations of patients withversus without detectable GALT activity (8Wang B.B.T. Xu Y.-K Ng W.G. Wong L.-J.C. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1998; 63: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These data support the hypothesis that genotype may correlate with activity, which in turn may influence metabolite levels and phenotypic outcome. Indeed, ungenotyped patients with detectable GALT activity have been reported to accumulate lower levels of gal-1-P and to experience a milder clinical course and than do their counterparts without detectable GALT activity (6Ng W.G. Xu Y.-K Kaufman F.R. Lee J.E.S. Donnell G.N. Neonatal Screening in the Nineties.in: Wilcken B.

Similarly, a number of studies report decreased levels of UDP-gal and altered ratios of UDP-glc/UDP-gal in samples from galactosemic patients compared with controls (2Holton, J. B., Walter, J. H., Tyfield, L. A. (2000) inMetabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease (Scriver, C. R., Beaudet, A. L., Sly, S. W., Valle, D., Eds., A., Childs, B., Kinzler, K. W., and Vogelstein, B., Assoc. eds) McGraw-Hill Inc., New York, pp. 1553–1587.Google Scholar). Nonetheless, there has been no direct test of the relationship of these parameters. Furthermore, although some retrospective outcome studies of patients with galactosemia have reported a statistically significant relationship between genotype and outcome, others have not (9Elsas L.J.

We report here the first quantitative and allele-specific test of the hypothesis that there is a relationship between hGALT genotype, activity, metabolite levels, and sensitivity to galactose in a eukaryotic system. In particular, we have used yeast, extending from initial observations by Douglas and Hawthorne (13Douglas H.C. Hawthorne D.C. Genetics. 1964; 49: 837-844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), who reported that GALT-deficient yeast, but not their wild-type counterparts, were growth-arrested by the addition of small amounts of galactose to the medium despite the presence of other metabolizable carbon sources. We applied a previously described null-background yeast expression system (14Fridovich-Keil J.L. Jinks-Robertson S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) to study 16 naturally occurring patient alleles of human GALT (R67C, S135L, L139P, V151A, F171S, P183T, Q188R, R201H, R231H, R259W, K285N, E291K, N314D, R333W, Y323D, and T350A). In particular, we characterized each allele in terms of both abundance and activity of the encoded human GALT protein. Three main groups of alleles were identified: those with <1% wild-type activity, those with 1–5% wild-type activity, and those with ≥∼10% wild-type activity. Monitoring the impact of galactose exposure on strains of yeast expressing each mutant allele, we observed that, with few exceptions, yeast expressing the lowest activity hGALT proteins demonstrated the most significant sensitivity to galactose and the most prolonged accumulation of gal-1-P, an indicator of galactose metabolic imbalance. Strains expressing the intermediate activity alleles of hGALT demonstrated intermediate galactose sensitivity and transient gal-1-P accumulation. Finally, those strains expressing the highest activity alleles of hGALT demonstrated no sensitivity to galactose and no detectable accumulation of gal-1-P. Furthermore, studies of UDP-gal and UDP-glc accumulation in samples prepared from yeast expressing wild-type human GALT versus no GALT showed a specific and significant loss of UDP-gal, but not UDP-glc, only in the GALT-deficient cells in response to the addition of galactose. These results present the first clear evidence in a biochemically and genetically amenable model system of a relationship between hGALT genotype, encoded enzyme activity measured in vitro, aberrant metabolite accumulation, and sensitivity to galactose measuredin vivo. As such, these data lay a foundation for future studies into the underlying mechanism(s) of galactose toxicity in yeast and perhaps other eukaryotes, including humans. All hGALT mutations were recreated by site-directed mutagenesis of the otherwise wild-type sequence, as described previously (15McClary J.A. Witney F. Geisselsoder J. Biotechniques. 1989; 7: 282-289PubMed Google Scholar). The primers used to generate alleles R67C, L139P, P183T, R201H, R231H, R259W, K285N, E291K, Y323D, and T350A were hGR67CF (5′-GAAGACAGTGCCCTGCCATGACCCTCTC-3′), hGL139PF (5′-GGATGTAACGCCGCCACTCATGTCG-3′), hGP183TF (5′-GCTGTTCTAACACCCACCCCCACT-3′), hGR201HF (5′-GATATTGCCCAGCATGAGGAGCGA-3′), hGR231H (5′-TCAGGAAGGAACATCTGGTCCTAAC-3′), hGR259WF (5′-GCTGCCCCGTTGGCATGTGCGGCGG-3′), hGK285NF (5′-GCTCTTGACCAATTATGACAACCTC-3′), hGE291KF (5′-GACAACCTCTTTAAGACGTCCTTTCC-3′), hGY323DF (5′-CACGCTCATTACGACCCTCCGCTC-3′), hGT350AF (5′-GAGGGACCTCGCCCCTGAGCAGGCT-3′), respectively. All resultant mutant alleles were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. Recreations of the mutations S135L, V151A, F171S, Q188R, N314D, and R333W have been described previously (14Fridovich-Keil J.L.

Wells L. Fridovich-Keil J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30088-30091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). For expression at high copy number, alleles were subcloned into the 2-μm yeast vector pYEP-GAP (a generous gift of Dr. Warren Kruger, Fox Chase Cancer Center). Both plasmids facilitate expression of the introduced open reading frame from the constitutive yeast GAP promoter. All yeast manipulations were carried out according to standard techniques as described previously (21Guthrie C. Fink G. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194 (; 373–389): 281-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). All YEP-GAP and MM22 plasmids were transformed into yJFK1, a previously described haploid strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae deficient in GAL7, the endogenous yeast GALT (14Fridovich-Keil J.L. Jinks-Robertson S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected and maintained on the basis of tryptophan prototrophy, conferred by the plasmid. Except where otherwise noted, cells were cultured in media containing dextrose as the sole carbon source to prevent any selective pressure for GALT activity. Soluble cell lysates were prepared from 30-ml cultures grown at 30 °C to A600 = 1.5, essentially as described previously (14Fridovich-Keil J.L. Jinks-Robertson S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Briefly, cell pellets were resuspended in 500 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.3 mmaprotinin, 1 mm pepstatin A, 2 mm antipain, 1 mm phosphoramidon, 0.2 μg/ml chymostatin, 8 mm E64, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and transferred to 2-ml tubes. 100 μl of acid-washed glass beads (0.5-mm diameter) were added to each tube, and the cells were disrupted with 6 cycles of agitation (45 s on high followed by 45 s on ice) using a multihead Vortex at 4 °C. Each disrupted cell suspension was then transferred to a 1.5-ml tube and centrifuged in a microcentrifuge on high speed for 10 min at 4 °C to pellet insoluble material. Finally, each clarified supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and assessed for protein concentration using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent, as recommended by manufacturer, with bovine serum albumin as a standard. GALT activity was determined in soluble yeast lysates as described previously (14Fridovich-Keil J.L. Jinks-Robertson S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For lysates prepared from yeast expressing low copy number plasmids (MM22 derivatives), between 1 and 20 μg of total protein, adjusted to maintain linearity of the assay, was included in each reaction. 1 μg of protein was used for assays of wild-type hGALT under these conditions. For lysates prepared from yeast expressing high copy number plasmids (YEP-GAP derivatives), between 0.3 and 180 μg of total protein, adjusted to maintain linearity of the assay, was included in each reaction. 0.3–0.5 μg of protein was used for assays of wild-type hGALT under these conditions.

Med. 1995; 56: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels to be blotted were loaded with 5 μg/lane of protein representing yeast expressing low copy number plasmids (MM22 derivatives) and either 1 μg (wild-type) or 5 μg (mutants) of protein/lane representing yeast expressing high copy number plasmids (YEP-GAP derivatives). Both wild type and mutant forms of human GALT were detected using a rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against hexahistidine-tagged hGALT at a dilution of 1:100,000. As a control for loading, blots also were probed with an antiserum against the endogenous yeast protein cyclophilin (at a dilution of 1:30,000) (23Zydowsky L.D. Ho S.I. Baker C.H. McIntyre K. Walsh C.T. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 961-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Signals were visualized using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antiserum against rabbit Ig (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 1:5000 dilution) followed by reaction with the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, as recommended by the manufacturer. Cultures inoculated from colonies were grown initially in synthetic medium containing 2% dextrose overnight to an A600 between 1 and 2. Cells were then diluted into 6 ml of fresh medium containing 2% glycerol, 2% ethanol in place of dextrose at anA600 = 0.1. These cultures were allowed to grow to an A600 of about 1, at which point they were again diluted in duplicate into 6 ml of fresh synthetic medium containing 2% glycerol, 2% ethanol at an A600= 0.1 to begin growth curves. Time points were taken at 0, 7, 22, and 31 h, at which point the A600 of each culture was close to 0.4. At that point, galactose was added to a final concentration of 0.05% to one culture from each pair, and all tubes were returned to the rotator at 30 °C. Finally, measurements ofA600 were followed for each culture periodically over the next 2–4 days, as indicated (Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4).Figure 2Galactose sensitivity of gal7yeast expressing patient alleles of human GALT. Yeast expressing each of the indicated alleles of hGALT were cultured in synthetic medium containing glycerol/ethanol, with galactose added to 0.05% final concentration at 31 h (arrows).

As in Fig. 3, yeast expressing either no GALT or wild-type hGALT were cultured in synthetic medium containing glycerol/ethanol, with galactose added to half of the cultures at 0.05% final concentration at 40 h (arrows). In addition to monitoringA600 at the indicated times (panels Aand B), samples of each culture also were harvested and analyzed for intracellular levels of gal-1-P (panels C andD), UDP-gal (panels E and F), and UDP-glc (panels G and H). In allpanels, samples representing cultures with galactose are represented by open circles, and samples representing cultures without galactose are represented by filled circles. All values plotted represent average ± S.D. (n = 3). In panel C, samples representing yeast cultured in both the presence and absence of galactose are plotted, although only one set is visible because the values at each time point were coincident (all zero). Similarly, gal-1-P measurements at the 40-h time point (panel D) representing yeast cultured in both the presence and absence of galactose were both zero, so only one is visible in the figure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Samples were prepared from duplicate 30-ml cultures of cells grown as described above (before the addition of galactose). At 31 h after inoculation, a 6-ml sample was removed from each culture (zero time point), and galactose was added to the remaining volume of one culture from each pair to a final concentration of 0.05%. At 7, 15, and 63 h after the addition of galactose, 6-ml samples from each culture were harvested, pelleted, and frozen. Finally, cell pellets were lysed as described above, except that protease inhibitors were not included in the lysis buffer. Protein concentrations were measured, as described above, using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent as recommended by manufacturer, with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Next, each lysate was cleared of proteins by vigorous extraction with methanol (500 μl of methanol/200 μl of aqueous sample) followed by centrifugation to pellet the protein precipitate. Finally, each clarified supernatant was transferred to a fresh 1.5-ml tube and dried under vacuum. Pellets were resuspended in sterile, deionized water for further analysis. Gal-1-P levels were quantitated using a coupled spectrophotometric assay described previously (17Elsevier J.P. Wells L. Quimby B.B. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In particular, the assay buffer contained 100 mmglycylglycine, pH 8.7, 6 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μm glucose-1,6-diphosphate, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.8 mm NADP, 0.1 μg of phosphoglucomutase, and 0.06 μg of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in a total reaction volume of 400 μl. All assays were carried out using 300 ng of purified His6-tagged hGALT isolated from a yeast expression system. A standard curve was generated using UDP-glucose at a concentration of 0.6 mm with varying concentrations of galactose 1-phosphate (0.075–1.2 mm). To determine the levels of galactose 1-phosphate present in each test sample, 50 μl of deproteinated extract (representing 20–416 μg of original lysate protein) were used in place of a known quantity of galactose 1-phosphate so that the amount of gal-1-P present in that sample could be determined by interpolation from the standard curve. Final values presented (Figs. 3 and 4) were normalized according to total protein in each original extract. To ensure that our measurements of gal-1-P were comparable with those of other groups using the method of Bergmeyer (24Bergmeyer, H. (ed) (1974)Methods of Enzymatic Analysis, pp. 1291-1295,Academic Press, Inc., New YorkGoogle Scholar), which utilizes alkaline phosphatase and galactose dehydrogenase, we assayed a set of test samples, some with high gal-1-P and others with low gal-1-P, by both methods. In all cases comparable values were obtained from both assays (data not shown). Samples were prepared from cultures of yeast expressing either no GALT or wild-type human GALT grown in the presence versus absence of galactose, harvested, lysed, and cleared of proteins, as described above. UDP-gal was measured against a standard curve established using a coupled reaction with purified UDP-gal-4 epimerase (a kind gift of Drs. Jim Thoden and Hazel Holden, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI) and UDP-glc dehydrogenase (Sigma), as described previously (25Wohlers T.M. Fridovich-Keil J.L. J. Inherited Metab. Dis. 2000; 23: 713-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). UDP-glc was measured directly in each sample in the absence of epimerase using UDP-glc dehydrogenase (Sigma) and also quantitated by comparison with a standard curve. Final values presented (Fig. 4) were normalized according to total protein in each original extract. We have used site-directed mutagenesis of the wild-type human GALT sequence to recreate each of 16 naturally occurring mutations: R67C, S135L, L139P, V151A, F171S, P183T, Q188R, R201H, R231H, R259W, K285N, E291K, N314D, Y323D, R333W, T350A. After confirmation, each allele was introduced into both low copy number (CEN, MM22) and high copy number (2 μm, YEP-GAP) yeast expression plasmids containing the constitutive GAP promoter and transformed into the previously described null background strain ofS. cerevisiae, yJFK1 (14Fridovich-Keil J.L. Jinks-Robertson S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding the wild-type hGALT sequence and empty plasmids alone were also included in all experiments as positive and negative controls, respectively. Unless otherwise noted, all cultures were maintained in dextrose-containing medium to prevent selective pressure based on encoded hGALT activity. To confirm expression and to determine the relative abundance of each substituted hGALT protein in yeast, soluble lysates prepared from cells expressing each hGALT allele from a centromeric plasmid were subjected to Western blot analysis with the rabbit polyclonal anti-hGALT antiserum, EU70. As a control for loading of lanes, each filter was also probed with a polyclonal antiserum that recognizes yeast cyclophilin (23Zydowsky L.D. Ho S.I. Baker C.H. McIntyre K. Walsh C.T.

https://openalex.org/W2002668036,"Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), encoded by zwf, is essential for nitrogen fixation and dark heterotrophic growth of the cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme ATCC 29133. In N. punctiforme,zwf is part of a four-gene operon transcribed in the orderfbp-tal-zwf-opcA. Genetic analyses indicated thatopcA is required for G6PD activity. To define the role ofopcA, the synthesis, aggregation state, and activity of G6PD in N. punctiforme strains expressing different amounts of G6PD and/or OpcA were examined. A single tetrameric form of G6PD was consistently observed for all strains, as well as for recombinantN. punctiforme His-G6PD purified from Escherichia coli, regardless of the quantity of OpcA present. However, His-G6PD and the G6PD of strain UCD 351, which lacks OpcA, had low affinities for glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) substrate (Km(app) = 65 and 85 mm, respectively) relative to wild-type N. punctiforme G6PD (Km(app) = 0.5 mm). Near wild-type affinities for G6P were observed for these enzymes when saturating amounts of His-OpcA- or OpcA-containing extract were added. Kinetic studies were consistent with OpcA acting as an allosteric activator of G6PD. A role in redox modulation of G6PD activity was also indicated, because thioredoxin-mediated inactivation and reactivation of His-G6PD occurred only when His-OpcA was present.

Cyanobacteria are members of a phylogenetically cohesive group of prokaryotes that perform oxygenic photosynthesis and assimilate CO2 via the reductive pentose phosphate (Calvin) cycle. Excess photosynthate produced in the light is stored as glycogen, which is catabolized to provide maintenance energy during periods of darkness. Although most cyanobacteria are restricted to this photoautotrophic mode of growth, some, such as the filamentous heterocyst-forming isolate Nostoc punctiforme ATCC 29133, exhibit greater nutritional versatility. When provided with exogenous sugars such as fructose or glucose, N. punctiforme is capable of both photoheterotrophic growth in the light and heterotrophic growth in the dark.

Regulation of the activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD; E.C. 1.1.1.49), the enzyme controlling the entry of carbon into the cycle, is complex and poorly understood. Metabolites such as NADPH, ATP, glucose 6-phosphate (G6P), glutamine, and ribulose bisphosphate have been implicated in its regulation (4Schaeffer F. Stanier R.Y. Arch. Microbiol. 1978; 116: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 5Cossar J.D. Rowell P. Stewart W.D.P. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1984; 130: 991-998Google Scholar) as has thioredoxin, which may reductively inactivate and oxidatively reactivate the enzyme in the light and dark, respectively, to prevent futile cycling, which would occur if the Calvin and OPP cycles operated simultaneously (5Cossar J.D. Rowell P. Stewart W.D.P. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1984; 130: 991-998Google Scholar, 6Buchanan B.B. Annu. Rev. Plant. Physiol. 1980; 31: 341-374Crossref Google Scholar, 7Udvardy J. Borbely G. Juhasz A.

G6PD has been purified from the filamentous, heterocyst-forming cyanobacteria Anabaena variabilis (5Cossar J.D. Rowell P. Stewart W.D.P. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1984; 130: 991-998Google Scholar) andAnabaena sp. strain PCC 7120 (Anabaena 7120) (4Schaeffer F. Stanier R.Y. Arch.

Although the A. variabilis enzyme is a 250-kDa tetramer (5Cossar J.D. Rowell P. Stewart W.D.P. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1984; 130: 991-998Google Scholar), the Anabaena 7120 enzyme is found in multiple aggregation states. Three forms (M1, M2, and M3; 120, 240, and 345 kDa, respectively) with different catalytic activities were initially reported for Anabaena7120 G6PD (4Schaeffer F. Stanier R.Y. Arch. Microbiol. 1978; 116: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar); the 240-kDa M2 form was by far the most prevalent, but the larger M3 form appeared to be more active. More recently, the Anabaena 7120 enzyme was reported to exist in two aggregation states (250 and 750 kDa) (8Gleason F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 334: 277-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The equilibrium between the different forms of the Anabaena 7120 enzyme depends upon pH, the concentration of the enzyme in solution, and the presence or absence of substrates or other effectors. Multiple reactive bands have also been observed in extracts fromAnabaena 7120 and some other cyanobacterial strains after native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and staining of the gels for G6PD activity (9Sundaram S. Karakaya H. Scanlan D.J. Mann N.H. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 1549-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The sizes, numbers, and intensities of the bands vary with the strain and with growth conditions. oxidative pentose phosphate glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase glucose 6-phosphate Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120 polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7942 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid ampicillin neomycin chlorophyll a polymerase chain reaction histidine fusion tag maltose binding protein fusion tag dithiothreitol sodium tetrathionate A genetic analysis of the physiological role of G6PD and the OPP cycle in N. punctiforme was recently performed (10Summers M.L. Wallis J.G. Campbell E.L. Meeks J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6184-6194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In N. punctiforme, zwf, the gene encoding G6PD, is part of a four-gene operon (fbp-tal-zwf-opcA) 2The nucleotide sequence of the N. punctiforme opc operon was previously deposited in the GenBank data base under GenBank™ accession number L32796.with multiple transcriptional start points and complex transcriptional regulation (11Summers M.L. Meeks J.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 473-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Insertional inactivation of zwf resulted in essentially complete loss of G6PD activity and rendered thezwf mutant incapable of nitrogen fixation or dark heterotrophic growth, indicating that G6PD is required for both of these processes (10Summers M.L. Wallis J.G. Campbell E.L. Meeks J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6184-6194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inactivation of opcA gave rise to a mutant with the same phenotype. The opcA mutant was fully complemented by opcA supplied in trans on a multicopy plasmid, whereas complementation of the zwf mutant withzwf on the same multicopy plasmid abolished the growth defects but restored G6PD activity to only 25% of wild-type levels. If both zwf and opcA were present on the multicopy plasmid, however, the G6PD activity of the complemented zwfmutant was increased 20-fold over wild-type levels. These results imply that the downstream gene opcA is required for the synthesis or activation of fully functional G6PD. The opcA gene has since been identified in all other cyanobacteria examined. Outside of the division Cyanobacteria, a derived amino acid sequence with significant similarity across the entire length of the polypeptide has not been observed. A limited similarity to restricted regions of the polypeptide can be detected in derived sequences from other microorganisms by BLAST analysis (available from the National Center for Biotechnology Information on the Web) (12Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59933) Google Scholar). In Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 (Synechococcus 7942) (13Newman J. Karakaya H. Scanlan D.J. Mann N.H. FEMS Lett. 1995; 133: 187-193Crossref Google Scholar) and Anabaena 7120 (available from Kazusa DNA Research Institute on the Web),opcA is located directly downstream from zwf, whereas the two genes are unlinked in Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 (also available from the National Center for Biotechnology Information on the Web). Insertional inactivation ofopcA in Synechococcus 7942 resulted in a mutant that had lost G6PD activity and was no longer viable in the dark (9Sundaram S. Karakaya H. Scanlan D.J. Mann N.H. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 1549-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), a phenotype consistent with that observed for N. punctiforme(10Summers M.L. Wallis J.G. Campbell E.L. Meeks J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6184-6194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the basis of G6PD activity staining of mutant and wild-type cell extracts on native PAGE gels, it has been proposed that OpcA catalyzes the formation of active G6PD oligomers inSynechococcus 7942 (9Sundaram S. Karakaya H. Scanlan D.J. Mann N.H. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 1549-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We report here the results of further experiments undertaken with N. punctiforme that are consistent with OpcA acting as an allosteric activator of G6PD and not as a chaperone for the assembly of G6PD oligomers. Plasmids and bacterial strains used in this study are shown in TableI. N. punctiforme 29133 andAnabaena 7120 were cultured in modified Allen and Arnon medium (14Cohen M.F. Wallis J.G. Campbell E.L. Meeks J.C. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 3233-3240Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) at 25 °C in an illuminated (9 watts/m2) New Brunswick incubator with shaking at 150 rpm. The medium was supplemented with 2.5 mm NH4Cl and 5 mm MOPS, pH 7.8, with 50 mm fructose or glucose, or with ampicillin (Ap) or neomycin (Nm) at 10 μg/ml when appropriate. When darkness was required, culture flasks were wrapped in multiple layers of aluminum foil to exclude light. Cells were typically harvested after 7–10 days when culture densities reached 2–3 μg of chlorophyll a (Chl a)/ml.Table IPlasmids and bacterial strainsPlasmid or strainRelevant characteristics1-aAbbreviations for antibiotic resistance markers are Apr, ampicillin; Kmr, kanamycin; Emr, erythromycin; Cmr, chloramphenicol; Nmr, neomycin.Source or referencePlasmidspBluescript II KS(+)pUC19-derived cloning vector; AprStratagenepMAL-c2Expression vector for generation of maltose binding protein fusion proteins; AprNew England BioLabspET-28a(+)Expression vector for generation of His-tagged fusion proteins; KmrNovagenpRL271Conjugatable nonreplicating cyanobacterial vector containing sacB; Emr, Cmr(28Black T.A.

Open table in a new tab Extracts used for SDS and native PAGE and enzyme assays were prepared from cells grown as described above and harvested by centrifugation at 6000 × g, 4 °C. Cell pellets were washed once in 50 mm Tris maleate buffer (pH 6.5) containing 10 mm MgCl2, resuspended in the same buffer, and broken with several passages through a chilled French pressure cell at 15,000 p.s.i. Extracts were clarified by centrifugation for 5 min at 16,000 × g, 4 °C prior to use. Protein assays and determinations of the Chl a content of cyanobacterial strains were performed as described previously (15Campbell E.L. Meeks J.C. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 473-480Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Routine DNA manipulations in Escherichia coli strain DH5α-MCR were performed according to standard procedures (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA-modifying enzymes were purchased from New England BioLabs and Life Technologies, Inc. and were used according to the manufacturers' instructions. Large scale plasmid preparations were obtained using a commercial kit (Qiagen).N. punctiforme strain UCD 466 (zwf::PpsbAnptII) was constructed by digesting pSCR115 with PmlI to remove a 0.7-kb fragment from the zwf gene. This fragment was replaced with a 1.1-kb-blunted XbaI fragment from pRL448 containing PpsbAnptII (encoding Nm resistance) to generate pSCR346, which was digested with DraI andXbaI. The 6.7-kb fragment containing thenptII-interrupted zwf gene was ligated to thesacB-containing conjugatable vector pRL271, which had been digested with Ecl136II and XbaI. In the resulting plasmid, pSCR347, PpsbAnptII is in the same orientation as zwf and transcription of opcAoccurs. Introduction of pSCR347 into wild-type N. punctiforme by conjugation, selection for Nm- and sucrose-resistant exconjugants, and confirmation of the insertional inactivation by Southern blotting was performed as described previously (10Summers M.L. Wallis J.G. Campbell E.L. Meeks J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6184-6194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Cohen M.F. Wallis J.G. Campbell E.L. Meeks J.C. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 3233-3240Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Strain UCD 482 was constructed by introducing pSCR121 into wild-type N. punctiforme via electroporation as described (10Summers M.L. Wallis J.G. Campbell E.L. Meeks J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6184-6194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The construction of strains UCD 341, 348, 351, and 364 is described elsewhere (10Summers M.L. Wallis J.G. Campbell E.L. Meeks J.C. J.

Affinity-tagged G6PD and OpcA proteins were prepared using the pET system of Novagen or the pMAL protein fusion and purification system of New England BioLabs. DNA fragments containing the N. punctiforme zwf or opcA genes were obtained using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with pSCR115 as a template and the following primers: 5′-ATGGTTAGTCTGCTAGAAAATCCCTTGC-3′ (His-G6PD forward) and 5′-GCTCTAGAGTCTGCGCCAGCGACGGCCATCC-3′ (His-G6PD reverse), or 5′-ATGACAAAATCCAAAATCTCAAATCCAAAACTTCC-3′ (MBP-OpcA and His-OpcA forward) and 5′-GCTCTAGACGGTGTATACACAAGTCGTTAAAACCCG-3′ (MBP-OpcA reverse) or 5′-CGCGCTCGAGGTTAGGTCTAAGTTAATTCG-3′ (His-OpcA reverse). PCR amplifications were performed in a PerkinElmer Cetus thermal cycler with AmpliTaq polymerase. The 1.5-kb PCR product containingzwf was initially cloned into the EcoRV site of pBluescript II KS(+). Digestion with BamHI andHindIII released a 1.5-kb fragment containingzwf, which was inserted into the BamHI andHindIII sites of the expression vector pET-28a(+) to generate pSCR197. pSCR195, used to generate MBP-OpcA for antibody production, was constructed by cloning a 1.6-kb PCR fragment containingopcA into the EcoRV site of pBluescript II KS(+). This fragment was removed from pBluescript II KS(+) by digestion withSalI and PstI and was then ligated into theSalI and PstI sites of pMAL-c2. A 1.4-kb PCR fragment containing opcA was digested with XhoI and inserted into the Ecl136II and XhoI sites of pET-28a(+) to generate pSCR352, which was used to produce His-OpcA. MBP-OpcA was soluble when expressed in E. coli DH5α-MCR, whereas a portion of each of the His-tagged proteins was present in inclusion bodies when expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3). In each case, the soluble protein was purified by affinity chromatography according to the kit manufacturers' instructions, with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm) added to all buffers used during purification. Purified proteins were stored at 4 °C at concentrations of 0.5–1.5 mg of protein/ml. The His-tagged proteins tended to precipitate out of solution; precipitation occurred more readily when protein concentrations were higher. His-G6PD retained activity for 2–3 weeks when stored at 4 °C in elution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mimidazole, pH 7.8). His-OpcA rapidly lost its ability to activate G6PD when it was stored in elution buffer; consequently, it was dialyzed in several changes of 50 mm Tris maleate buffer (pH 6.5) containing 10 mm MgCl2 prior to storage at 4 °C for 2–3 weeks. Neither protein was stable at −20 °C when stored in buffers containing 0–50% glycerol nor under any condition if diluted to less than 0.5 mg/ml. Losses of activity during purification and storage have been reported previously for G6PD (4Schaeffer F. Stanier R.Y. Arch.

SDS and native PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining were performed according to standard protocols (20Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, NY1994Google Scholar) using either the Bio-Rad Mini-Protean II system or the larger Bio-Rad Protean system. Rabbit polyclonal antisera were raised against purified His-G6PD or MBP-OpcA by standard techniques (21Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar) and were used at a dilution of 1:400. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (22Hanson T.E. Forchhammer K. Tandeau de Marsac N. Meeks J.C. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 1537-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Bound primary antibody was detected either with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat α-rabbit secondary antibody and ap-iodophenol/Luminol chemiluminescent protocol (22Hanson T.E. Forchhammer K. Tandeau de Marsac N. Meeks J.C. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 1537-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) or with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat α-rabbit secondary antibody (1:50,000 dilution) and Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ECF substrate. When the latter detection method was used, detection and quantitation of chemifluorescent bands was performed using a Storm PhosphorImager with ImageQuaNT software (Molecular Dynamics). Immunoprecipitations were performed according to standard methods (21Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar) with 100 μl of N. punctiforme extract (10–20 mg of protein/ml) and 5 μl of α-G6PD or α-OpcA antiserum or preimmune serum. After 1 h on ice, 100 μl of 10% (v/v) protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads was added, and the mixture was incubated 1 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking. The beads were washed four times with ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40). Electrophoresis of the immune complexes was performed using 10% polyacrylamide SDS-PAGE gels with β-mercaptoethanol omitted from the sample buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were detected by Western blotting. The molecular masses of His-G6PD and G6PDs in cyanobacterial extracts were determined by Ferguson analysis using 5, 6, and 7% acrylamide native PAGE gels. Standards used for native PAGE were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. and included the following: bovine serum albumin (66 and 132 kDa), β-amylase (200 kDa), apoferritin (450 kDa), urease (545 kDa), and thyroglobulin (669 kDa). The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue or G6PD activity stain (4Schaeffer F. Stanier R.Y. Arch. Microbiol. 1978; 116: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) to identify standards and unknowns, respectively. Average RF values for each protein at each gel concentration were determined by measuring the distances from the center of the bands to the dye front on duplicate gels. G6PD activity was assayed by a modification of the method of Schaeffer and Stanier (4Schaeffer F. Stanier R.Y. Arch. Microbiol. 1978; 116: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), in which the standard assay NADP concentration was increased from 0.5 to 2.0 mm. The standard assay mixture also contained 50 mm Tris maleate, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, and 5 mm G6P (dipotassium salt). Where indicated, the G6P and NADP concentrations were varied for the determination of kinetic parameters. The reaction was initiated by the addition of cell extract or purified protein, and the reduction of NADP at room temperature was followed by monitoring the increase in absorbance at 340 nm, typically for 1 min. To ensure that initial velocities were measured, all assays were determined to be in the linear range with respect to protein concentration, time, and substrate utilization. With crude cell extracts, in which the enzyme concentration varied, at least three total protein concentrations were surveyed for linearity before extended assays were done at the selected protein concentration. For purified His-G6PD, activity in standard assays was linear between at least 0.2 and 2.0 μg of protein and 0.5 μg was typically used. The quantity of G6P and NADP substrate consumed was calculated at all substrate, protein, and effector concentrations used. For determinations of Km(app) for NADP, less than 5% of the initial concentrations of NADP or G6P were consumed and for determinations of Km(app) for G6P, the amounts of G6P and NADP consumed were always less than 2% of the initial concentrations. In all experiments, at all concentrations of protein, substrates, and effector, changes inA340 were linear with time, implying that any potential end product inhibition by NADPH or 6-phosphogluconolactone was inconsequential. Kinetic data were analyzed using KaleidaGraph v. 3.08. Spirulina thioredoxin and the chemical oxidants and reductants used in redox modulation experiments were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. To determine whether growth conditions affected the activity or aggregation state of N. punctiforme G6PD, cells were cultured with ammonium in the light (photoautotrophic conditions), without ammonium in the light (photoautotrophic, nitrogen-fixing conditions), or in the dark in the absence of ammonium and presence of 50 mm fructose (heterotrophic, nitrogen-fixing conditions). Cell extracts prepared from each culture were first assayed for G6PD activity and were then separated by electrophoresis on 10% acrylamide native PAGE gels, blotted to nitrocellulose membrane, and incubated with α-G6PD or α-OpcA antibodies. The G6PD activity clearly varied with growth conditions. In the experiment shown in Fig.1, the activity of cells grown with ammonium in the light was 0.035 μmol·min−1·mg of protein−1. G6PD activity increased by 1.6-fold in nitrogen-fixing cells grown in the light (0.055 μmol·min−1·mg of protein−1) and by 7.6-fold (0.265 μmol·min−1·mg of protein−1) in nitrogen-fixing cells grown heterotrophically in the dark with fructose. The increases in G6PD activity were accompanied by increased synthesis of G6PD and OpcA, but the aggregation states of G6PD and OpcA were unchanged (Fig. 1). N. punctiforme G6PD consistently migrated as a single band with a molecular mass that appeared to be between 200 and 545 kDa based on the positions of native PAGE standards, whereas OpcA migrated as a single band near the 66-kDa marker (Fig. 1).

The aim of the present study was to determine which receptor subtype is involved in the biological responses generated by LPA in preadipocytes. Growing 3T3F442A preadipocytes express EDG-2 and EDG-4mRNAs, with no expression of EDG-7 or PSP24mRNAs. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction revealed that EDG-2 transcripts were 10-fold more abundant than that of EDG-4. To determine the involvement of the EDG-2 receptor in the responses of growing preadipocytes to LPA, stable transfection of antisenseEDG-2 cDNA was performed in growing 3T3F442A preadipocytes. This procedure, led to a significant and specific reduction in EDG-2 mRNA and protein. This was associated with a significant alteration in the effect of LPA on both cell proliferation and cell spreading. Finally, the differentiation of growing preadipocytes into quiescent adipocytes led to a strong reduction in the level of EDG-2 transcripts. Results demonstrate the significant contribution of the EDG-2 receptor in the biological responses generated by LPA in 3T3F442A preadipocytes.

LPA controls a wide variety of cellular responses (mitogenesis, cytoskeletal rearrangements, cell adhesion, ion transport, apoptosis) through the activation of specific G-protein-coupled receptors (3Goetzl E.

A first potential LPA gene receptor, called vzg-1 (5Hecht J. Weiner J. Post S. Chun J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1071-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar), was cloned in mouse and found homologous to the endothelial differentiation gene-1 (EDG-1) (6Hla T. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9308-9313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a high affinity receptor for another bioactive phospholipid: sphingosine 1-phosphate (7Lee M. Brocklyn J.V. Thangada S. Liu C. Hand A. Menzeleev R. Spiegel S. Hla T. Science. 1998; 279: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). A human gene exhibiting 97% homology with vzg-1 was then identified and calledEDG-2 (8An S. Dickens A. Bleu T. Hallmark O. Goetzl E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 619-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Two other human genes, called EDG-4and EDG-7, have also been cloned and proposed to be LPA receptors (9An S. Bleu T.

At the beginning of the present work the cDNA sequences of EDG-4 and EDG-7 mouse orthologues were not yet available. Since then, the EDG-4 mouse orthologue was cloned and sequenced (11Contos J. Chun J. Genomics. 2000; 64: 155-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). A fourth gene receptor, called PSP24, was cloned in Xenopus (12Guo Z. Liliom K. Fischer D.J. Bathurst I.C. Tomei L.D. Kiefer M.C. Tigyi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14367-14372Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and mouse (13Kawasawa Y. Kume K. Nakade S. Haga H. Izumi T. Shimizu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 276: 952-956Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and initially proposed to be a LPA-responsive receptor. However, the PSP24 receptor gene exhibits poor homology with the EDG receptor gene family and is actually related to theplatelet-activating factor receptor gene.Most evidence that EDG-2, EDG-4, EDG-7, and PSP24 are LPA receptors is deduced from their ability to increase or restore LPA activity following their overexpression in cells (5Hecht J. Weiner J. Post S. Chun J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1071-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 9An S. Bleu T. Hallmark O. Goetzl E. J. Biol.

However, the relative contribution of endogenously expressed LPA receptors in the biological activities of LPA remains poorly defined. Because pharmacological tools to study LPA receptors are very limited (no available antagonists, difficulties in performing receptor binding studies), one way to address the question is to alter LPA receptor expression by using antisense strategies or gene invalidation methods.We recently observed that conditioned medium prepared from adipocytes exposed to an α2-adrenergic stimulation increased proliferation and spreading (reflecting a reorganization of actin cytoskeleton) on an α2-adrenergic-insensitive murine preadipose cell line: 3T3F442A. Analysis based on the use of a lysophospholipid-specific phospholipase (phospholipase B) and32P-phospholipid labeling, revealed the involvement of LPA in the trophic activities of adipocyte conditioned medium (14Valet P. Pagès C. Jeanneton O. Daviaud D. Barbe P. Record M. Saulnier-Blache J. Lafontan M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1431-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Because of the intimate coexistence of adipocytes and preadipocytes within adipose tissue, LPA released by adipocytes could play an important role in paracrine/autocrine control of preadipocyte growth, a key event involved in adipose tissue development. Therefore, a better understanding of the cellular mechanisms of LPA action in preadipocytes could help to develop pharmacological and/or genetic strategies to control adipogenesis.The trophic action of LPA in growing 3T3F442A preadipocytes can be specifically desensitized by chronic exposure to a high concentration of LPA (14Valet P. Pagès C. Jeanneton O. Daviaud D. Barbe P. Record M. Saulnier-Blache J. Lafontan M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1431-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Exposure of growing 3T3F442A preadipocytes to LPA leads to rapid and pertussis toxin-sensitive activation of the mitogen-activated kinases ERK1 and ERK2 (15Pagès C. Girard A. Jeanneton O. Barbe P. Wolf C. Lafontan M. Valet P. Saulnier-Blache J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 905: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Whereas those observations suggest the involvement of a G-protein-coupled receptor(s) in the action of LPA in 3T3F442A preadipocytes, the identity of the discrete LPA receptor(s) responsible for these biological effects remains to be determined.In the present work, we studied the expression of EDG-2,EDG-4, EDG-7, and PSP24 receptor genes and attempted to determine their relative contribution in the biological responses of 3T3F442A preadipocytes to LPA (proliferation and spreading). Based upon quantification of gene expression, and antisense cDNA transfection, the EDG-2 receptor was found to be predominantly involved in LPA-dependent control of 3T3F442A preadipocyte proliferation and spreading.MATERIALS AND METHODSCells3T3F442A preadipocytes were grown in 10% donor calf serum-supplemented DMEM as reported previously (16Bouloumié A. Planat V. Devedjian J.-C. Valet P. Saulnier-Blache J.-S. Record M. Lafontan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30254-30259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The medium was changed every 2 days. Conversion of 3T3F442A preadipocytes into adipocytes was obtained by cultivating confluent cells in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum plus 50 nm insulin as described previously (14Valet P.

Invest. 1998; 101: 1431-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar).Nonquantitative RT-PCR AnalysisTotal RNAs were extracted using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). One microgram of total RNA was treated with 1 unit of RNase-free DNase I (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 15 min at room temperature followed by further inactivation with 1 μl of EDTA (25 mm) for 10 min at 65 °C. Then, RNA was reverse-transcribed for 60 min at 37 °C using SuperScript II (Life Technologies, Inc.) RNase H− RT and subjected to amplification. A minus RT reaction was performed in parallel to ensure the absence of genomic DNA contamination. PCR was carried out in a final volume of 50 μl containing 3 μl of cDNA, 1 μl of dNTP (10 mm), 5 μl of 10× PCR buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9, 50 mm KCl and 0.1% Triton X-100), 3 μl of MgCl2 (25 mm), 1.5 μl of sense- and antisense-specific oligonucleotide primers (10 μm), and 1.25 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega). Conditions for the PCR reaction were: initial denaturation step at 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles consisting in 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 54 °C (EDG-2), 57 °C (EDG-4), 49 °C (EDG-7), 57 °C (PSP24), or 58 °C (EDG-1), 72 °C for 90 s. After a final extension at 72 °C for 6 min, PCR products were separated on 1.5% agarose gel, and amplification products were visualized with ethidium bromide. In some experiments we analyzed the influence of the number of PCR cycles on the intensity of the amplification products.Oligonucleotide Primers for Nonquantitative RT-PCRDetection of Sense mRNAsEDG-2 primers were designed from mouse EDG-2 cDNA (vzg-1) (5Hecht J. Weiner J. Post S. Chun J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1071-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar): sense, 5′-ATCTTTGGCTATGTTCGCCA-3′ and antisense, 5′-TTGCTGTGAACTCCAGCCA-3′. Those primers are 100% identical between mouse and human (8An S. Dickens A. Bleu T. Hallmark O. Goetzl E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 619-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar).EDG-4 primers were designed from the 570-bp fragment of mouse EDG-4 cDNA cloned in the present study (see below): sense, 5′-TGGCCTACCTCTTCCTCATGTTCCA-3′ and antisense, 5′-GGGTCCAGCACACCACAAATGCC-3′. Those primers are specific to mouse.EDG-7 primers were designed from a GenBankTMmouse expressed sequence tag (Clone ID 2192692, GenBankTMaccession number AW107032), which exhibits 82% identity on nucleotide level and that we assumed to correspond to mouseEDG-7. This was confirmed later on after the identification of the mouse EDG-7 (GenBankTM accession number NM_012152): sense, 5′-AGTGTCACTATGACAAGC-3′ and antisense, 5′-GAGATGTTGCAGAGGC-3′. These primers are 100% identical between mouse and human.PSP24 primers were designed such as these are homologous toXenopus (12Guo Z. Liliom K. Fischer D.J. Bathurst I.C. Tomei L.D. Kiefer M.C.

Hla T. Genomics. 1997; 43: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar): sense, 5′-GTCCGGCATTACAACTACAC-3′ and antisense, 5′-TATAGTGCTTGTGGTAGAGC-3′. Those primers are 100% identical between mouse and human (6Hla T. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9308-9313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Detection of Antisense mRNAsDetection ofEDG-2 antisense mRNAs was performed with an antisense primer designed from the sequence of stabilization of mRNA in pcDNA3.1 vector (5′-CAACAGATGGCTGGCAACTA-3′) and a specific sense primer designed from human EDG-2(5′-CTGTGAAATTACAGGGATGGA-3′).Quantitative RT-PCR AnalysiscDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of total RNA in 20 μl using random hexamers and murine Moloney leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). A minus RT reaction was performed in parallel to ensure the absence of genomic DNA contamination. Design of primers was done using the Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems). Real-time quantitative RT-PCR analyses were performed starting with 50 ng of reverse-transcribed total RNA with 200 nm concentration of both sense and antisense primers in a final volume of 25 μl using the sybr green PCR core reagents in a ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System instrument (Applied Biosystems). Standard curves were determined after amplification of 5 × 102 to 5 × 106copies of purified amplicons generated from 3T3-F442A cDNA by non quantitative RT-PCR. Quantification of EDG-2 andEDG-4 mRNA steady state copy numbers were performed using internal primers located within the amplicons' sequence. Internal sense and antisense primers and size of products, respectively, were for EDG-2 and EDG-4: 5′-CTGTGGTCATTGTGCTTGGTG-3′, 5′-CATTAGGGTTCTCGTTGCGC-3′, and 231 bp and 5′-GGCTGCACTGGGTCTGGG-3′, 5′-GCTGACGTGCTCCGCCAT-3′, and 214 bp.Northern Blot Analysis32P-Labeled probes were obtained by nick-translation of cDNA fragments purified from the coding region of mouseEDG-2 (1.1 kbp), mouse EDG-4 (0.57 kbp), mouseEDG-1 (1.3 kbp), and mouse aP2 (0.6 kbp) genes. Twenty μg of total RNAs were separated by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gel containing 2.2 m formaldehyde, transferred onto a nylon membrane (Schleicher and Schuell, Dassell, Germany), and UV cross-linked. The blot was incubated overnight at 68 °C in hybridization buffer containing 0.5 mNa2HPO4-12H2O, 1 mmEDTA, 7% SDS, 1% bovine serum albumin, 32P-labeled cDNA probes, pH 7. The blot was finally washed at a final stringency of 0.5× SSC, 0,1% SDS and autoradiographed.Cloning of a Mouse EDG-4 cDNA FragmentMouse cDNAs were synthesized from total RNAs isolated from NIH3T3 cells with random primers and reverse transcriptase. PCR was done with degenerate primers 5′-CTiGCCiATCGCCGTiGAGCGiCA-3′ and 5′-ACiACCTGiCCiGGiGTCCAGCA-3′ corresponding to the third and the sixth transmembrane domains of the human EDG-4 receptor, respectively (9An S. Bleu T. Hallmark O. Goetzl E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7906-7910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). The PCR conditions were 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min. A product of ∼570 bp was obtained and cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). The sequence of this mouse cDNA fragment was 85 and 93% identical to human EDG-4at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively. Therefore, this cDNA fragment was assumed to correspond to the mouseEDG-4 gene. During the time of the present study, a full-length cDNA encoding mouse EDG-4 cDNA was cloned (11Contos J. Chun J. Genomics. 2000; 64: 155-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) (GenBankTM accession number AF218844). Our sequence was 100% homologous with this cDNA.Stable Transfection with Antisense VectorThe coding region of human EDG-2 cDNAs (8An S. Dickens A. Bleu T. Hallmark O. Goetzl E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 619-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) was subcloned in the antisense direction in pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen). Construct was verified by restriction mapping and sequencing. Antisense EDG-2 cDNA vector or empty pcDNA3.1 vectors were transfected in exponentially growing 3T3F442A preadipocytes by calcium phosphate precipitation followed by G418 (neomycin) selection as described previously (16Bouloumié A.

Gene expression and functional analysis were performed on individual G418-resistant cell clones.Western Blot AnalysisPreadipocyte proteins were solubilized in radioimmune precipitation buffer, and 50 μg of protein were separated on 11% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred on nitrocellulose as described previously (18Bétuing S. Daviaud D. Valet P. Bouloumié A. Lafontan M. Saulnier-Blache J. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5220-5229Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The blot was preincubated for 2 h at room temperature in TBST buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20) containing 5% dry milk (TBST-DM) and then overnight at 4 °C in TBST-DM containing 1/5000 anti-Vzg-1 receptor antibody (5Hecht J. Weiner J. Post S. Chun J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1071-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). After extensive washing with TBST-DM, the blot was incubated with peroxidase conjugate secondary anti-rabbit antibody 1/5000e(Sigma) for 1 h and washed again. Immunostained proteins were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).Cell Proliferation and SpreadingCell proliferation was determined as described previously (14Valet P.

After 48-h culture in 10% donor calf serum-supplemented DMEM, cells were serum-deprived and exposed for an additional 48 h to various growth factors such as fetal calf serum, 1-oleoyl-LPA. Cell number was determined using Coulter counter. In some experiments LPA present in fetal calf serum was suppressed by overnight treatment at 37 °C with 0.1 unit/ml phospholipase B (EC 3.1.1.5; Sigma).Cell spreading was used as an index of actin cytoskeleton reorganization and was quantified as described previously (19Pagès C. Rey A. Lafontan M. Valet P. Saulnier-Blache J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 572-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Briefly, preconfluent cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and placed in serum-free DMEM for 30–60 min to induce cell retraction characterized by a reduced cell area. Cell spreading was measured by the increase in the cell area generated after 20-min exposure to 1-oleoyl-LPA or sphingosine 1-phosphate. Cell area was measured under a microscope connected to a video camera and image analysis program (Visiolab).RESULTSExpression of EDG Receptor mRNA in Growing 3T3F442A PreadipocytesThe presence of EDG-2, EDG-4,EDG-7, and PSP24 mRNAs in total RNA prepared from 3T3F442A preadipocytes was first tested by nonquantitative RT-PCR. Total RNA prepared from different tissues was used in parallel as positive control: brain (for EDG-2 and EDG-1 (5Hecht J. Weiner J. Post S. Chun J. J.

As shown in Fig. 1,EDG-2 and EDG-4 mRNAs, but notEDG-7 nor PSP24 mRNAs, were detected in 3T3F442A preadipocytes. In parallel, transcripts for the sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor EDG-1 were also detected in 3T3F442A preadipocytes.The relative proportion of EDG-2 versus EDG-4 mRNAs was quantified using real time RT-PCR. As shown in Table I, EDG-2mRNAs were found to be 10-fold more abundant than EDG-4mRNAs (Table I). By using Northern blot analysis on total RNA,EDG-2 (as well as EDG-1) mRNAs were easily detectable after 24-h autoradiography (Fig.2), whereas EDG-4 mRNAs remained undetectable after 7 days exposure (not shown). Results showed that although EDG-2 and EDG-4 transcripts could be detected in growing 3T3F442A preadipocytes, EDG-2transcripts were predominantly expressed.Table IExpression of EDG-2 and EDG-4 transcripts in growing 3T3F442A preadipocytesReceptorTranscript levelEDG-215,500 ± 1944EDG-41550 ± 597EDG-2 and EDG-4 mRNAs were quantified from growing 3T3F442A preadipocytes using real time RT-PCR (see “Materials and Methods”).

Twenty μg of total RNA extracted from growing 3T3F442A preadipocytes or mouse brain were analyzed by Northern blot using specific 32P-labeled probes directed againstEDG-2 (A) and EDG-1 mRNAs (B). An 18 S ribosomal RNA probe was used to ensure equal well loading.

Thirteen G418-resistant cell clones were isolated, and the presence of antisense mRNAs was determined by RT-PCR. For that, specific primers designed for antisenseEDG-2 mRNA detection (see “Material and Methods”) were used. Six cell clones were found to express antisenseEDG-2 mRNA (Fig.3 A). Based upon Northern blot analysis, the six clones exhibited a lower expression of endogenousEDG-2 mRNAs as compared with 3T3F442A preadipocytes transfected with the empty vector (Fig. 3 B). Clone 7 and clone 24 were those expressing the lowest amount of endogenousEDG-2 mRNA (Fig. 3 B). It was then tested whether down-regulation of endogenous EDG-2 mRNAs observed in clone 7 and clone 24 was accompanied by a reduction in EDG-2 protein level. Thus, Western blot analysis was performed with a polyclonal antibody raised against mouse-EDG-2 receptor (Vzg-1) (5Hecht J. Weiner J. Post S. Chun J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1071-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). As described previously (5Hecht J. Weiner J. Post S. Chun J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1071-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar), the receptor was detected as a protein with a molecular mass between 31 and 45 kDa (Fig.3 C). In clone 7 and clone 24, the amount of this protein was lower when compared with 3T3F442A preadipocytes transfected with the empty vector (Fig. 3 C). No detectable reduction in the amount of EDG-2 receptor protein was observed in clones 9, 12, and 22 (not shown). Results showed that stable transfection withEDG-2 antisense cDNA allowed us to isolate 3T3F442A preadipocyte clones with decreased expression of endogenous EDG-2 receptor.Figure 3Expression of EDG-2antisense and sense mRNAs in G418-resistant cell clones transfected with EDG-2 antisense cDNA. A, the presence of antisense EDG-2 mRNAs was examined by RT-PCR analysis (see “Material and Methods”) in G418-resistant cell clones (clones 7 to 31) transfected with antisenseEDG-2 cDNA and in empty pcDNA3.1 transfected cells.B, EDG-2 mRNA level in G418-resistant cell clones analyzed by Northern blot as described in the legend to Fig. 2.C, EDG-2 receptor protein level analyzed by Western blot (see “Material and Methods”) in clone 7, clone 24, and in empty pcDNA3.1 transfected cells: representative of two separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In parallel, we tested whether stable expression of EDG-2antisense cDNA would affect EDG-4 receptor expression.EDG-4 transcripts were thus quantified in the six clones depicted in Fig. 3 B. Because EDG-4 mRNAs could not be detected by Northern blot, real time RT-PCR was used for their quantification. When compared with 3T3F442A preadipocytes transfected with the empty vector, the EDG-4 mRNA level was found to be increased in clone 7, clone 19, and clone 22 and significantly decreased in clone 12 (TableII). Therefore, down-regulation ofEDG-2 transcripts was not systematically accompanied by a compensatory up-regulation of EDG-4 transcripts.Table IIExpression of EDG-4 transcripts in 3T3F442A preadipocytes transfected with EDG-2 cDNA antisenseCell clonesTranscript level, EDG-4copies/50 ng total RNApcDNA 3.12441Clone 726344Clone 12915Clone 1917038Clone 2214953Clone 243609Clone 305129EDG-4 mRNAs were quantified in antisenseEDG-2 cDNA transfected 3T3F442A preadipocytes using real time RT-PCR (see “Materials and Methods”). Results corresponded to one experiment performed in triplicate. Open table in a new tab Influence of EDG-2 Antisense cDNA Transfection on LPA-dependent ProliferationWe previously demonstrated that 1-oleoyl-LPA, the most active LPA species, increases proliferation in growing 3T3F442A preadipocytes (14Valet P.

In 3T3F442A preadipocytes transfected with empty vector, 1 μm1-oleoyl-LPA by itself induced a significant increase (150% of the control) in cell number (Fig. 4). Among the six G418-resistant cell clones used in Fig. 3 B, only clone 7 and clone 24 exhibited a significant reduction in the proliferative response induced by 1 μm 1-oleoyl-LPA (Fig.4). Clone 7 and clone 24 were those harboring detectable alteration of EDG-2 receptor protein expression (see Fig. 3 C). It was also noticeable that clone 7 exhibited an alteration of preadipocyte responsiveness to LPA despite the existence of the high level of expression of EDG-4 transcripts (Table II). Clone 12, which exhibited no alteration of EDG-2 transcripts but a significant reduction of EDG-4 transcripts (Table II), revealed no significant alteration in the proliferative response to LPA. Results showed that reduction of EDG-2 receptor expression was accompanied by an alteration in the proliferative response of 3T3F442A preadipocytes to LPA. In parallel, a poor contribution of EDG-4 receptor in this response was suggested.Figure 4Influence of LPA on the proliferation of G418-resistant cell clones transfected with EDG-2antisense cDNA. Each cell clone was seeded and grown in 10% donor calf serum-supplemented DMEM. After 48 h, serum was removed, and each cell clone was grown for an additional 48 h in the presence or absence of 1 μm 1-oleoyl-LPA. Cell number obtained in each clone was determined as described under “Material and Methods” and compared with that obtained with empty pcDNA3.1 transfected cells. Each column represents the mean ± S.E. of three to five independent experiments, depending on cell clone. Statistical analysis was performed using the Student's ttest: *, p < 0.05 when comparing LPA activity in each clone to that measured in empty pcDNA3.1 transfected cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)LPA is abundant (0.5–2.5 μm) in serum (20Saulnier-Blache J.S.

https://openalex.org/W2002446300,"In Escherichia coli, interaction of a periplasmic maltose-binding protein with a membrane-associated ATP-binding cassette transporter stimulates ATP hydrolysis, resulting in translocation of maltose into the cell. The maltose transporter contains two transmembrane subunits, MalF and MalG, and two copies of a nucleotide-hydrolyzing subunit, MalK. Mutant transport complexes that function in the absence of binding protein are thought to be stabilized in an ATPase-active conformation. To probe the conformation of the nucleotide-binding site and to gain an understanding of the nature of the conformational changes that lead to activation, cysteine 40 within the Walker A motif of the MalK subunit was modified by the fluorophore 2-(4′-maleimidoanilino)naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid. Fluorescence differences indicated that residues involved in nucleotide binding were less accessible to aqueous solvent in the binding protein independent transporter than in the wild-type transporter. Similar differences in fluorescence were seen when a vanadate-trapped transition state conformation was compared with the ground state in the wild-type transporter. Our results and recent crystal structures are consistent with a model in which activation of ATPase activity is associated with conformational changes that bring the two MalK subunits closer together, completing the nucleotide-binding sites and burying ATP in the interface.

The periplasmic binding protein-dependent maltose transport system of Escherichia coli is a member of the ATP-binding cassette or ABC1superfamily of proteins. Members of this protein family are responsible for the transport of a variety of substrates across membranes in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms (1Higgins C. Res. Microbiol... 1990; 141: 353-360Google Scholar, 2Holland I.B. Blight M.A. J. Mol. Biol... 1999; 293: 381-399Google Scholar). Medically important members of the superfamily include the multidrug-resistant P-glycoprotein and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (3Chen C.-J. Chin J.E. Ueda K. Clark D.P. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Roninson I.G. Cell.. 1986; 47: 381-389Google Scholar, 4Riordan J.R. Rommens J.M. Kerem B.-S. Alon N. Rozmahel R. Grzelczak Z. Zielenski J. Lok S. Plavsic N. Chou J.-L. Drumm M.L. Iannuzzi M.C. Collins F.S. Tsui L.C. Science.. 1989; 245: 1066-1073Google Scholar). A soluble maltose-binding protein (MBP) and a membrane-spanning transport complex consisting of one MalF, one MalG, and two MalK (MalFGK2) protein subunits mediate maltose transport across the cytoplasmic membrane. The hydrophobic MalF and MalG proteins are predicted to form a transmembrane channel for substrate, and ATP hydrolysis by the associated MalK subunits is coupled to the translocation event (5Davidson A.L. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem... 1990; 265: 4254-4260Google Scholar, 6Davidson A.L. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem... 1991; 266: 8946-8951Google Scholar). Periplasmic binding proteins bind their substrates tightly and are responsible for the high affinity of this class of prokaryotic transporters (7Treptow N.A. Shuman H.A. J. Bacteriol... 1985; 163: 654-660Google Scholar). In the presence of ligand, the binding proteins undergo a conformational change (8Spurlino J.C. Lu G.Y. Quiocho F.A. J. Biol. Chem... 1991; 266: 5202-5219Google Scholar, 9Sharff A.J. Rodseth L.E. Spurlino J.E. Quiocho F.A. Biochemistry.. 1992; 31: 10657-10663Google Scholar) and initiate translocation by stimulating the ATPase activity of the membrane-bound transporters (10Davidson A.L. Shuman H.A. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1992; 89: 2360-2364Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that MBP activates the ATPase activity of MalFGK2 by stabilizing the transition state for ATP hydrolysis, and as a consequence becomes tightly bound to the transport complex in the presence of the transition state analogue vanadate (11Chen J. Sharma S. Quiocho F.A. Davidson A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; Google Scholar). Vanadate traps ADP in one of the two nucleotide-binding sites, locking the transport complex in the transition state conformation (11Chen J. Sharma S. Quiocho F.A. Davidson A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; Google Scholar, 12Sharma S. Davidson A.L. J. Bacteriol... 2000; 182: 6570-6576Google Scholar). Maltose is likely passed from MBP to MalFGK2 in the transition state, thereby coupling transport to ATP hydrolysis. Mutations have been isolated in MalF and MalG that permit maltose transport in the absence of MBP, albeit with lowered affinity (7Treptow N.A. Shuman H.A. J. Bacteriol... 1985; 163: 654-660Google Scholar). These binding protein-independent (BPI) transport complexes have gained the ability to hydrolyze ATP in the absence of MBP (14Davidson A.L. Shuman H.A. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1992; 89: 2360-2364Google Scholar). We propose that the BPI mutants function by stabilizing the transport complex in a conformation that is associated with the activation of the ATPase activity of the WT. If the WT and BPI complexes represent the ground state and an active state of the transport complex, respectively, detection of conformational differences between the two complex types could provide information about the transport mechanism. The fluorescence of the sulfhydryl-specific reagent MIANS is sensitive to the polarity of its environment (15Gupte S.S. Lane L.K. J. Biol. Chem... 1979; 254: 10362-10369Google Scholar, 16Haugland R.P. Steiner R.F. Excited States of Biopolymers.Plenum Publishing Corp. 1983; : 41-42Google Scholar) and has been used to detect conformational changes in the Na+,K+-ATPase (15Gupte S.S. Lane L.K. J. Biol. Chem... 1979; 254: 10362-10369Google Scholar), the myosin ATPase (17Hiratsuka T. J. Biol. Chem... 1992; 267: 14941-14948Google Scholar), the P-glycoprotein (18Liu R. Sharom F.J. Biochemistry.. 1996; 35: 11865-11873Google Scholar, 19Liu R. Sharom F.J. Biochemistry.. 1997; 36: 2836-2843Google Scholar), and the lactose permease (20Wu J. Kaback H.R.

In this study, we used MIANS to detect conformational differences in the nucleotide-binding sites of WT and BPI complexes in the ground state and in the transition state to gain further insight into the mechanism of activation of MalFGK2ATPase activity. We found that the conformation of the nucleotide-binding sites in the BPI complex more closely resembles the transition state than the ground state of the WT complex. Furthermore, the conformational change associated with activation of the ATPase activity relocates residues involved in nucleotide binding to a less surface-exposed environment. Strain HN741 (Escherichia coli K-12 argH his rpsL1 malT(Con) malBΔ13 ΔatpBC ilv::Tn10/F′ lacI q Tn5) (14Davidson A.L. Shuman H.A. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genetics.. 1988; 120: 319-327Google Scholar) and two additional plasmids, harboring the malF, malG (pFG23), and malKht(pSS733) genes under control of Ptrc. The malKhtgene is a variant of malK encoding six histidines at the 5′ end that are used for purification of the transport complex (23Davidson A.L. Sharma S. J.

In some experiments, the pSS733 plasmid carrying themalKht allele was replaced with pSSGly, carrying a cysteine to glycine substitution at a position corresponding to position 40 of the native MalK protein. Plasmid pSSGly was constructed by cloning theRsrII-MluI fragment of pGly, containing themalK C40G mutation ((24) kindly provided by H. Shuman), into pSS751 (malKht K42N) (23Davidson A.L. Sharma S. J.

A... 1992; 89: 2360-2364Google Scholar) and stored at −70 °C until use. Histidine-tagged transport complexes were purified by affinity chromatography as published previously (23Davidson A.L. Sharma S. J. Bacteriol... 1997; 179: 5458-5464Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, thawed membrane vesicles were washed by dilution in 20 mm HEPES (pH 8), 1 mm EDTA and collected by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. Vesicles were resuspended at a protein concentration of ∼3 mg/ml in 50 mm NaPi (pH 8), 10% glycerol, and membrane proteins were solubilized by the addition of n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside to a final concentration of 1%. Solubilized proteins were bound to a Talon metal affinity column (CLONTECH) equilibrated with “buffer A” at pH 8 (containing 50 mm NaPi, 300 mmNaCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.01% dodecyl maltoside). The column was washed with buffer A at pH 8 and then with buffer A at pH 7. The transport complexes were eluted from the resin with 100 mmhistidine in buffer A at pH 7. Purified complexes were extensively dialyzed against “buffer B” (containing 20 mmNaPi (pH 8), 10% glycerol, 5 mmMgCl2, and 0.01% dodecyl maltoside) supplemented with 1 mm EDTA. 2-(4′-Maleimidylanilino)naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid (MIANS) was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). For MIANS modification studies, transport complexes were labeled in detergent solution (buffer B) by incubation at 25 °C with either 5 or 20 μm MIANS added from a 0.2 mm stock solution in methanol. Complexes that had been reconstituted into proteoliposome vesicles by dilution (6Davidson A.L. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem... 1991; 266: 8946-8951Google Scholar) were labeled in buffer containing 20 mm NaPi (pH 8) and 10 mm MgCl2 at 37 °C (26Liu C.E. Liu P.Q. Ames G.F.L. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 21883-21891Google Scholar). In control incubations methanol was added to complexes to the same percent volume as the MIANS stock solution. For ATP protection experiments, complexes were briefly preincubated with ATP as specified in the figure legends before the MIANS was added. Following incubation for 15 min at the specified temperature, reactions were terminated with 1 mmDTT, and complexes were assayed for ATPase activity. ATP hydrolysis activity of detergent-soluble and reconstituted transport complexes was measured using [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (12Sharma S. Davidson A.L. J. Bacteriol... 2000; 182: 6570-6576Google Scholar, 27Davidson A.L. Laghaeian S.S. Mannering D.E. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 4858-4863Google Scholar). ATP hydrolysis activity of complexes in proteoliposome vesicles was measured at 37 °C in 50 mmHEPES (pH 7) with 2 mm ATP, 10 mmMgCl2, 5 μm MBP, and 0.1 mmmaltose using a modification of the technique of Liu et al.(26Liu C.E. Liu P.Q. Ames G.F.L. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 21883-21891Google Scholar). For fluorescence studies, transport complexes were incubated with MIANS for 15 min at 4 °C. Excess MIANS was removed from the protein sample using a HiTrap desalting column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Fluorescence measurements were made using an ISS PC1 Photon Counting Spectrofluorometer (Champaign, IL). Fluorescence spectra for MIANS reacted with β-mercaptoethanol (MIANS-β-ME), and MIANS-labeled proteins in buffer B were recorded using an excitation wavelength of 340 nm and an emission range of 360–600 nm. Solvent accessibility was judged by the ability of acrylamide orp-xylene-bispyridinium bromide (DPX, Molecular Probes, Inc.) to quench the fluorescence of MIANS. For fluorescence quenching titrations, additions were made from 1 and 5 m acrylamide stock solutions or from a 0.5 m DPX stock solution. Quenching was monitored at a constant excitation wavelength of 340 nm and an emission wavelength corresponding to the emission maximum of the sample. Fluorescence values were corrected for dilution by performing control titrations with H2O instead of quencher, and the inner filter effect for acrylamide and DPX at the wavelengths used was negligible. The titration data were used to construct Stern-Volmer plots and K SV values calculated according to Lakowicz (28Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy.Plenum Publishing Corp. 1983; : 260-275Google Scholar). The Stern-Volmer Equation (1Higgins C. Res. Microbiol... 1990; 141: 353-360Google Scholar) is as follows, F0/F=1+kqτ0[Q]=1+KSV[Q]Equation 1 where F 0 is the fluorescence intensity in the absence of quencher; F is the fluorescence intensity in the presence of quencher; k q is the bimolecular quenching constant; [Q] is the concentration of the quencher; τ0 is the lifetime of the fluorophore in the absence of quencher; and K SV is the Stern-Volmer quenching constant. A plot of F 0/F versus [Q], the extent of quenching as a function of acrylamide or DPX concentration, yields a line with slopeK SV, a measurement of the accessibility of the fluorophore to solvent. WT and BPI complexes were treated with vanadate in detergent solution as described previously (11Chen J. Sharma S. Quiocho F.A. Davidson A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, reactions contained either 2.5 μmWT or BPI transport complex in buffer B containing 4 mmATP; 5 μm MBP and 0.01 mm maltose were also included in the WT reactions as specified in the figure legends. Vanadate was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm where indicated, and the reactions were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. The samples were then desalted using a Hitrap column and labeled with MIANS as described above. Stable association of MBP with the trapped WT complexes was confirmed using ion-exchange chromatography and SDS-PAGE (11Chen J. Sharma S. Quiocho F.A. Davidson A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed with 11% polyacrylamide gels using the procedure described by Laemmli (29Laemmli U.K. Nature.. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar).

In an effort to detect conformational changes associated with activation of the ATPase activity of MalFGK2, we wished to modify specifically a cysteine residue in the MalK subunit(s) with a fluorescent reporter group. The MalFGK2 complex contains a total of 10 cysteine residues (three in each MalK, three in MalF, and one in MalG (31Dassa E. Hofnung M. EMBO J... 1985; 4: 2287-2293Google Scholar, 32Froshauer S.

This residue is located at position 40 (Cys-40) within the Walker A consensus nucleotide-binding motif (also known as the phosphate binding loop, or P-loop) of MalK (34Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J... 1982; 1: 945-951Google Scholar). Modification of this residue by the sulfhydryl-specific reagentN-ethylmaleimide (NEM) inhibits the ATPase activity of the maltose transport complex (35Morbach S. Tebbe S. Schneider E. J. Biol. Chem... 1993; 268: 18617-18621Google Scholar, 36Hunke S. Dose S. Schneider E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun... 1995; 216: 589-594Google Scholar); ATP protects against inhibition (35Morbach S. Tebbe S. Schneider E. J. Biol. Chem... 1993; 268: 18617-18621Google Scholar), and replacement of this cysteine with serine eliminates inhibition without affecting normal activity (37Hunke S. Schneider E. FEBS Lett... 1999; 448: 131-134Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we predicted that it would be possible to label covalently Cys-40 with MIANS, a fluorescent maleimide probe that could be used to monitor conformational changes in the MalK subunit. Like NEM, MIANS also inhibited the ATPase activity of both WT and BPI transport systems (Table I). MIANS did not inhibit the ATPase activity of complexes containing a nondeleterious substitution of cysteine with glycine at position 40 in MalK (C40G) (24Panagiotidis C.H. Reyes M. Sievertsen A. Boos W. Shuman H.A. J. Biol. Chem... 1993; 268: 23685-23696Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that MIANS reacts with Cys-40 and that modification at this site is responsible for the inhibition of ATPase activity.Table IInhibition of MalFGK2 ATPase activity by MIANSProteinPercent remaining ATPase activityMethanol 1-aATPase activity of complexes incubated with methanol has been set at 100% for each preparation, and the other values were scaled accordingly.

Values are the mean ± S.D. of triplicate determinations. To interpret possible conformational differences detected by MIANS as being associated with Cys-40 in the nucleotide-binding site(s), we assessed the extent of labeling of the other cysteines in the transport complex both by SDS-PAGE and by comparison of the intensity of the fluorescence emission spectra of complexes containing either Cys-40 or a C40G substitution. As seen in SDS-PAGE analysis of MIANS-labeled complexes, very little fluorescence is associated with the MalF and MalG proteins, and substitution of a glycine for the cysteine at position 40 greatly reduces the fluorescence associated with MalK (Fig.1). The fluorescence emission spectra of the MIANS-labeled WT and BPI complexes revealed that the fluorescence of MIANS associated with C40G complexes was only 10–35% that seen for Cys-40 complexes (Fig. 2). Thus, although residues other than Cys-40 may be modified to some extent, the bulk of the fluorescence is associated with MIANS bound at Cys-40. Variation of buffer, pH, MIANS concentration, and length of incubation did not improve the specificity of the modification reaction (data not shown). Quantitation of MIANS incorporation into MalFGK2 through absorbance measurements at 322 nm (38Ksenzenko M.Y. Kessel D.H. Rosen B.P. Biochemistry.. 1993; 32: 13362-13368Google Scholar) failed to address the question of whether residue Cys-40 was modified in one or both MalK subunits (data not shown), in part because of the variability in the background (non-Cys-40) labeling by MIANS. However, based on other observations (see “Discussion”), we hypothesize that only one of the two MalK subunits is modified.Figure 2Fluorescence spectra of MIANS-labeled complexes. Transport complexes were labeled with MIANS in detergent solution as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fluorescence spectra were recorded using an excitation wavelength of 340 nm and an emission range of 360–600 nm. Fluorescence emission spectra maxima were as follows: a, 0.1 μmMIANS-β-ME, 443 nm; b, C40G BPI-MIANS, 420 nm;c, C40G WT-MIANS, 421 nm; d, Cys-40 BPI-MIANS, 421 nm; e, Cys-40 WT-MIANS, 431 nm. The small peak at 385 nm is the Raman scatter (28Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy.Plenum Publishing Corp. 1983; : 260-275Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were 0.1 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The fluorescence characteristics of MIANS are sensitive to the hydrophobicity of its environment; specifically, emission maxima are blue-shifted to shorter wavelengths, and the quantum yield increased as the solvent polarity decreases (16Haugland R.P. Steiner R.F. Excited States of Biopolymers.Plenum Publishing Corp. 1983; : 41-42Google Scholar, 17Hiratsuka T. J. Biol. Chem... 1992; 267: 14941-14948Google Scholar). The emission spectra in Fig. 2were therefore used to compare the local environment of MIANS at Cys-40 in the WT and BPI complexes. For both complexes, MIANS exhibited a greater fluorescence quantum yield when bound to protein than when reacted with β-mercaptoethanol in solution. The emission maximum of MIANS attached to the WT complex was blue-shifted 12 nm from that of free MIANS-β-ME, whereas the emission maximum of the BPI complex was blue-shifted 22 nm. These results suggest that the probe is in a more hydrophobic environment when bound to either protein, and the larger blue-shift associated with the BPI complex may indicate that the environment surrounding residue Cys-40 in the nucleotide-binding site is more hydrophobic in the BPI than in the WT. To probe further the nature of the conformational difference suggested by the blue shift in the fluorescence emission of the BPI transport complex, collisional quenching experiments were performed to assess the solvent accessibility of MIANS. Specifically, the ability of water-soluble reagents to collide with MIANS and quench its fluorescence was measured as a function of quencher concentration to compare the relative exposure of MIANS in WT and BPI complexes to the aqueous environment. The solvent accessibility of MIANS complexes was assessed using either acrylamide (Fig. 3,A and B) or DPX (Fig. 3, C andD) as a quenching agent. As anticipated, MIANS bound to the complexes was less accessible to the quenching reagents than MIANS free in solution (K SV = 3.18m−1 for free MIANS-β-ME in the acrylamide experiments), as judged by the decreased slopes of the lines in the Stern-Volmer plot. In acrylamide quenching experiments, MIANS bound to the WT complex is significantly more exposed to solvent than in the BPI complex, with K SV values of 1.94 and 1.41 m−1, respectively (Fig.3 A). Removal of Cys-40 from both complexes negates this difference, confirming that the assay is reporting on conformational changes located at the nucleotide-binding site. MIANS bound to these C40G complexes was even less exposed to solvent than MIANS at Cys-40 in the BPI transport complex (Fig. 3 A). In experiments using DPX, a larger quenching reagent than acrylamide, MIANS bound to the WT complex was also significantly more exposed to solvent than in the BPI complex, with K SV values of 41.5 and 27.3m−1, respectively. In this case, the exposure of MIANS on the BPI complex to DPX was the same as that seen for the complexes containing the C40G substitution (Fig.3 C). These data provide further evidence of a conformational difference between the WT and BPI complexes which appears to affect the exposure of residues in the nucleotide-binding pocket to the aqueous milieu. In experiments similar to those presented here, the fluorescence of MIANS positioned in the P-loop of P-glycoprotein was quenched by ATP in a concentration-dependent manner (18Liu R. Sharom F.J. Biochemistry.. 1996; 35: 11865-11873Google Scholar). We therefore added ATP to the labeled MalFGK2 complexes to determine whether nucleotide binding could be detected as a change in the fluorescence properties of MIANS at Cys-40. The presence of 1 mm ATP had no effect on the fluorescence emission spectrum of either transport complex (data not shown) and did not significantly alter solvent accessibility (Fig. 3, B and D) other than a small effect on exposure of the WT to acrylamide. Because ATP protects against modification of residue Cys-40 (35Morbach S. Tebbe S. Schneider E. J. Biol. Chem... 1993; 268: 18617-18621Google Scholar), MIANS might prevent nucleotide binding in the MalFGK2 system via a steric effect. If MIANS modifies only one nucleotide-binding site, it is also possible that ATP binds to one site without significantly altering the fluorescence characteristics of MIANS at the second site. We recently showed that vanadate inhibits MalFGK2 by trapping the complex in its transition state conformation with ADP tightly bound in one of the two nucleotide-binding sites (11Chen J. Sharma S. Quiocho F.A. Davidson A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; Google Scholar, 12Sharma S. Davidson A.L. J. Bacteriol... 2000; 182: 6570-6576Google Scholar). Vanadate-induced nucleotide trapping requires MBP in the WT but not in a BPI mutant (12Sharma S. Davidson A.L. J. Bacteriol... 2000; 182: 6570-6576Google Scholar). The ability to trap the transition state provides a second model system that can be used to study conformational changes associated with activation of ATPase activity. Because vanadate trapping of the transition state conformation requires ATP hydrolysis (12Sharma S. Davidson A.L. J. Bacteriol... 2000; 182: 6570-6576Google Scholar), complexes were first treated with vanadate and then labeled with MIANS. The fluorescence intensity of either the WT or the BPI complex labeled after vanadate treatment was very similar to the intensity of control preparations labeled without the treatment; however, in the WT complex, vanadate treatment resulted in a 3-nm blue shift in fluorescence emission relative to the untreated complex (data not shown). The solvent accessibility of MIANS was then assessed using acrylamide quenching. The accessibility of MIANS in the BPI complex was unchanged by vanadate treatment (Fig.4). In the WT complexes, addition of MBP in the absence of vanadate did not alter the solvent accessibility of MIANS (Fig. 4). However, the solvent accessibility of MIANS was different when WT complexes were vanadate-trapped in the presence of MBP. The accessibility was reduced to a level resembling that of MIANS bound to BPI complexes, suggesting that the conformation of the BPI may resemble the transition state of the WT transporter. Another feature of the WT complex trapped in the transition state species is that it binds tightly to MBP (11Chen J. Sharma S. Quiocho F.A. Davidson A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; Google Scholar), whereas in the ground state it displays a relatively low affinity for MBP (39Manson M.D. Boos W. Bassford Jr., P.J. Rasmussen B.A. J. Biol. Chem... 1985; 260: 9727-9733Google Scholar, 40Dean D.A. Hor L.I. Shuman H.A. Nikaido H. Mol. Microbiol... 1992; 6: 2033-2040Google Scholar). If the conformation of the BPI transporter resembles the transition state, it might display a high affinity for MBP even in the absence of vanadate, as shown indirectly for another BPI mutant, MalFG511K2(40Dean D.A. Hor L.I. Shuman H.A. Nikaido H. Mol. Microbiol... 1992; 6: 2033-2040Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, MBP is tightly associated with the MalF500GK2 BPI complex, both in the presence and absence of treatment with vanadate, whereas"

HARP is clearly expressed in brain during the perinatal stage of rapid axon growth and synapse formation (3Rauvala H. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2933-2941Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) and plays a role in bone formation (7Imai S. Kaksonen M. Raulo E. Kinnunen T. Fages C. Meng X.J. Lakso M. Rauvala H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1113-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Even if HARP is generally down-regulated after birth, it is also expressed during adulthood and is important in cell growth and differentiation (reviewed in Ref. 8Courty J. Milhiet P.E. Delbé J.

HARP could also play a central role in normal spermatogenesis, because knock out of the gene in mice may lead to sterility in males (12Zhang N. Yeh H.J. Zhong R. Li Y.S. Deuel T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Originally isolated as a neurite outgrowth-promoting protein (13Rauvala H. Pihlaskari R. J. Biol.

In agreement with its role in angiogenesis, HARP can induce migration of aortic bovine endothelial cells in collagen (16Laaroubi K. Delbe J. Vacherot F. Desgranges P. Tardieu M. Jaye M. Barritault D. Courty J. Growth Factors. 1994; 10: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and enhances plasminogen activator activity of the same cells (17Kojima S. Inui T. Kimura T. Sakakibara S.

Until now, except for the neurite outgrowth activity (18Maeda N. Noda M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 203-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 19Raulo E. Chernousov M.A. Carey D.J. Nolo R. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12999-13004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the cell surface molecules involved in these biological activities are still poorly documented. However, it seems that low and high affinity binding sites could be involved in its mitogenic activity. The existence of high affinity receptors is suggested by the phosphorylation of a 200-kDa protein in NIH-3T3 and NB41A3 cells treated with HARP (20Li Y.S. Deuel T.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 1089-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and is strongly supported by the ability of HARP to transduce a mitogenic signal through MAPK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathways in BEL cells (21Souttou B. Ahmad S. Riegel A.T. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19588-19593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).HARP is a 18-kDa protein that contains 24% of basic residues (18% of lysines), mainly arranged in two clusters at the N- and C-terminal regions, and five intrachain disulfide bonds, clearly demonstrated using NMR experiments by the Rauvala group (22Kilpelainen I.

The molecule is organized in two β-sheet domains linked by a flexible linker, and each of these two domains includes one heparin-binding site. At least one heparin-binding site is involved in the dimerization of this growth factor (23Bernard-Pierrot I. Heroult M. Lemaitre G. Barritault D. Courty J. Milhiet P.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and is important for HARP mitogenic activity, because this activity on BEL cells is modulated by exogenous addition of glycosaminoglycans (24Vacherot F. Delbe J. Heroult M. Barritault D. Fernig D.G. Courty J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7741-7747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Furthermore, treatment of BEL cells with heparinase III abolished HARP mitogenic activity, which could be restored by the addition of soluble heparin.Post- or cotranslational maturations of HARP have been considered as a possible mechanism involved in HARP mitogenic activity. The cleavage site of the signal peptide of HARP has been more particularly subject to controversies between several groups. The N-terminal sequence of the originally purified mature peptide from uterus or from conditioned media of epithelial cells was GKKEKP corresponding to a 136-amino acid protein (HARP136) (14Fang W. Hartmann N. Chow D.T. Riegel A.T. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25889-25897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Milner P.G. Li Y.S. Hoffman R.M. Kodner C.M. Siegel N.R. Deuel T.F.

However, we have identified a second cleavage site of the signal peptide leading to a 3-amino acid extension AEA (HARP139), which seemed to be associated to its mitogenic activity (16Laaroubi K.

Barritault D. Courty J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 164: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Similarly, discrepancies between results of previous studies were observed for the putative C-terminal maturation of HARP (21Souttou B. Ahmad S. Riegel A.T. Wellstein A. J. Biol.

For transfection, 3 × 105 CHO-K1 cells per 60-mm dishes were seeded in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% FCS and transfected 24 h later with 4 μg of pCDNA3 or pCDNA3-HARP plasmids using the liposomal system Fugene6 according to the manufacturer's protocol. 48 h after transfection, cells were selected for G418 resistance (800 μg/ml). Medium was changed every 2 days until colonies formed. Each G418-resistant clonal population was scrapped with a tip, resuspended, and cultured in the selective medium. The clones secreting the largest amount of HARP were selected. Several clones transfected with pCDNA3 were also selected for control experiments (Mock cells).Purification of HARP from Conditioned MediaTagged, mutated, or wild type HARP proteins were purified as previously described (16Laaroubi K. Delbe J. Vacherot F. Desgranges P. Tardieu M. Jaye M. Barritault D. Courty J. Growth Factors. 1994; 10: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, 8 × 106 NIH-3T3 or CHO-K1 cells were plated in 600-cm2 dishes and cultured for 72 h in complete medium. For CHO-K1 cells, the culture medium was supplemented 24 h after seeding with 5 mm sodium butyrate, which increased by 100-fold the expression level of recombinant protein (29Palermo D.P. DeGraaf M.E. Marotti K.R. Rehberg E. Post L.E. J. Biotechnol. 1991; 19: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Conditioned medium containing secreted HARP proteins was buffered to pH 7.4 with 20 mm Hepes, ionic strength adjusted to 0.5 m NaCl and then loaded onto a 10-ml heparin-Sepharose column. Bound proteins were eluted with 20 mm Hepes, 2 m NaCl, pH 7.4, and further purified using a cation-exchange Mono-S column. The purification was carried out in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and proteins were eluted using a 0.4 to 2 m NaCl gradient. Determination of the N-terminal sequence was performed using the Protein Microsequencing Service at the Pasteur Institute (Paris, France). The amount of HARP proteins in each peak was evaluated using an immunometric assay described in Soulié et al. 2P. Soulié, M. Héroult, I. Bernard-Pierrot, M. E. Kerros, P. E. Milhiet, J. Delbé, D. Barritault, D. Caruelle, and J. Courty, manuscript submitted.Thymidine Incorporation Assay3 × 104NIH-3T3 wild type cells per well were seeded in 48-well plates for 24 h in DMEM supplemented by 10% FCS. Cells were then serum-starved for 24 h, and samples were added. Cells were then incubated at 37 °C and 7% CO2 for 18 h and incubated further for 6 h with 0.5 μCi of [methyl-3H]thymidine. Cells were then fixed with 10% trichloroacetic acid, washed with water, and lysed with 0.1n NaOH. Total incorporated radioactivity was counted using a micro-beta scintillation counter (LKB, PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Courtaboeuf, France). Similar protocol was used with BEL cells as previously described (27Delbe J. Vacherot F. Laaroubi K. Barritault D. Courty J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 164: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).Western Blotting ProcedurePurified proteins were run on SDS-15% polyacrylamide gel and electrotransferred to Immobilon-P membrane in 10 mm CAPS (3-[cyclohexylamino]-1-propanesulfonic acid), pH 11, containing 10% methanol. Nonspecific binding was prevented by incubating the membrane for 20 min in the Superblocker solution at room temperature. The membrane was then incubated overnight at 4 °C with goat anti-human HARP antibodies (250 ng/ml) diluted in PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20 (PBS-T) and 3% Superblocker. After three washes with PBS-T, the membrane was incubated 30 min at room temperature with the peroxidase-conjugated anti-immunoglobulin goat antibodies diluted in PBS-T, and the enzyme was detected using the BM chemiluminescence reagent.Phosphorylation of MAPK2.5 × 105 NIH-3T3 cells were seeded in 35-mm culture dishes for 24 h, serum-starved for 24 h, and stimulated for 5 min at 37 °C with samples. Cells were lysed with electrophoresis sample buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 0.02% bromphenol blue, 2% SDS, and 5% β-mercaptoethanol), and the presence of phospho-p42/p44 MAPK was detected by Western blot using the procedure described above except that proteins were run on SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel, electrotransferred in 25 mm Tris, pH 8.3, containing 200 mm glycine, and 10% ethanol, and Immobilon-P membrane incubated in PBS-T supplemented with 2% (w/v) powdered milk. The monoclonal anti-phospho-p42/p44 antibodies was diluted to obtain a 1 μg/ml concentration.Neurite Outgrowth AssaysCells from cerebral hemispheres of 18-day-old rat embryo were prepared as described previously (3Rauvala H. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2933-2941Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Brain was dispersed into individual cells in DMEM containing 10% FCS, 6 mg/ml glucose, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin using a 10-ml sterile syringe and centrifuged at 100 ×g for 10 min. The pellet was suspended in the same medium without FCS and containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. 2.5 × 104 cells were seeded in a 96-well EIA plate (Costar, Brumath, France) precoated with 0.8, 1.6, or 3.2 μg/ml wild-type (wt) HARP or mutant proteins. After 48 h, cells were stained with May-Grünwald's solution and Giemsa stain. The number of neurites per well was evaluated using phase contrast microscopy. Each experiment was carried out in duplicate and representative results are shown.Tumor Formation in Nude MiceTumor formation in 5-week-old female athymic nude mice (Nu/Nu, IFFA CREDO Laboratories) was tested by subcutaneous injection of 106 cells suspended in 100 μl of Ham's F-12 at a unique site. Tumor size was measured twice a week, starting from the second week following injection. Mice were sacrificed 6 weeks after injection.RESULTSContradictory results have been reported concerning the mitogenic activity of HARP. Although only neurite outgrowth activity was originally reported by Rauvala (13Rauvala H. Pihlaskari R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16625-16635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), further studies have suggested that the mitogenic activity of HARP was dependent either on the presence of three amino acids at the N terminus (16Laaroubi K. Delbe J. Vacherot F. Desgranges P. Tardieu M. Jaye M. Barritault D. Courty J. Growth Factors. 1994; 10: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) or related to a C-terminally truncated form (21Souttou B. Ahmad S. Riegel A.T. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19588-19593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To clarify this point, recombinant C-terminal-tagged molecules with the c-Myc/6His peptide, which is useful to detect C-terminal processing, were produced from NIH-3T3 cells (23Bernard-Pierrot I. Heroult M. Lemaitre G. Barritault D. Courty J. Milhiet P.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The recombinant proteins were purified, characterized, and tested for their mitogenic activity.N-terminal Processing of HARP and Mitogenic ActivityPurification of HARP from NIH-3T3 CellsTwo liters of conditioned medium were collected after a 72-h culture, and proteins were purified using sequential heparin-Sepharose/Mono-S chromatographies, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Using a 0.4 to 2 m NaCl gradient for the elution of the Mono-S column, five major fractions were collected (data not shown) and analyzed using SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fig.1 A, lanes 1–5) and Western blot experiments (Fig. 1 B). In fractions 2 and 4, two proteins with an apparent molecular mass of 21 kDa were mainly purified, in good agreement with the size of the C-terminal tag extension. Both polypeptides were immunodetected by the anti-HARP (Fig.1 B, lanes 2 and 4) and anti-c-Myc (data not shown) antibodies. The fraction eluted with 0.61m NaCl from the Mono-S column with an apparent molecular weight of 21,000 (lane 2) corresponded to the tagged-HARP139 molecule, whereas the fraction eluted with 0.67 m NaCl (lane 4) was determined to be tagged-HARP136. Those two tagged-HARP molecules, therefore, revealed N-terminal processing identical to what we previously described (16Laaroubi K. Delbe J. Vacherot F. Desgranges P. Tardieu M. Jaye M. Barritault D. Courty J. Growth Factors. 1994; 10: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In fraction 4, two additional bands of 18 and 15 kDa were slightly silver-stained, immunodetected with anti-HARP antibody (Fig. 1 B, lane 4), and could correspond to C-terminal proteolytic cleavage, because they were not recognized by the anti-c-Myc antibody (data not shown). Two 18-kDa proteins eluted with 0.65 m NaCl (Fig. 1 A, lane 3) and 0.69 m NaCl (Fig. 1 A, lane 5) were also purified and immunodetected with the anti-HARP antibody but not using anti-c-Myc antibody (data not shown). They might correspond, respectively, to HARP139 and HARP136 produced endogenously by NIH-3T3 cells, but we cannot exclude a cleavage of the c-Myc/6His epitope, even if the purification was carried out in the presence of protease inhibitors. During this experiment, two proteins with apparent molecular masses of 65 and 30 kDa were isolated in fraction 1 (arrows in Fig. 1 A, lane 1). N-terminal sequencing and Western blot experiments with an anti-HGFα antibody (inset of Fig. 1 B) identified them to be the α and β chains of the hepatocyte growth factor. We can also note that bovine serum albumin was identified in fraction 2 (Fig. 1 A, lane 2).The mitogenic activity of the recombinant HARP isolated as described above was then assayed on serum-starved NIH-3T3 cells (Fig.2 A). Aliquots of each fractions, as mentioned in the figure legend, were added to the cells, and mitogenic activity was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 2 A, the fractions containing the HARP139 (fraction 2, tagged-HARP139; fraction 4, HARP139) as well as HARP136 form (fraction 3, tagged-HARP136; fraction 5, HARP136) induced cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. A 4-fold increase of tritiated thymidine incorporation in NIH-3T3 cells as compared with the control was observed for the highest concentration of each fraction and was similar to what was obtained with 10% FCS (Fig. 2 A). Specific activities were calculated by estimating the concentration of HARP in the different fractions using an immunometric assay that we have developped.2 The ED50 level for HARP139 was higher than for HARP136,i.e. 2 and 6 nm, respectively. Similar results were obtained using BEL cells (data not shown). However, although HGF was only immunodetected in the first eluted fraction from Mono-S chromatography, it was important to rule out the possibility of a cross-contamination by HGF in other eluted fractions containing HARP. In this respect, NIH-3T3 cells were stimulated with a saturating dose of HGF in the presence or not of the different HARP fractions described above. As shown in Fig. 2 B, addition of an aliquot of each purified HARP fraction induced a higher stimulation than those achieved by HGF alone. The same overstimulation of DNA synthesis was observed for FGF-2 used in this experiment as positive control. These results clearly indicated that the effects of HGF and HARP on DNA synthesis were independent and suggested that the stimulation observed in fractions 2–5 was not due to HGF contaminations. However, considering the overstimulation obtained with fraction 2, which was weaker than expected, a slight contamination of this fraction by HGF cannot be completely ruled out.Figure 2Mitogenic activity of recombinant HARP produced from NIH-3T3 cells. A, stimulation of [3H]thymidine incorporation of serum-starved NIH-3T3 cells during 18 h by 0.1-, 1-, and 10-μl aliquots of HARP fractions obtained from the Mono-S chromatography described in Fig. 1. FGF-2 and FCS are used as positive controls. B, overstimulation experiments. Serum-starved NIH-3T3 cells were stimulated by a combination of a saturating dose of HGF (10 μl of fraction 1) and 1 μl of each mono-S HARP fraction (described in Fig.1). Purified recombinant FGF-2 (10 ng/ml) was used as a positive control of overstimulation. The results are the means of three separate experiments carried out in triplicate and the standard errors are indicated. For more details concerning the thymidine incorporation, see “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Production of Recombinant HARP from CHO-K1 CellsThe N-terminal maturation of HARP was also studied using a CHO-K1 cell expression system. After transfection with the cDNA encoding HARP protein, CHO-K1 clonal populations overexpressing HARP were selected using G418, and HARP was purified from the conditioned medium as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Under these conditions, only HARP136 was isolated. Neither HARP139 nor HGF proteins have been identified. HARP136 isolated from CHO-K1 cells displayed mitogenic activity for NIH-3T3 cells (see below) and BEL cells (not shown). However, HARP136 produced by CHO-K1 cells was about three times less active than HARP136produced in NIH-3T3 cells (ED50 of 20 nm versus 6 nm). As control, purification steps were carried out from the conditioned medium of CHO-K1 cells transfected with vector alone, and no mitogenic activity was yielded in the collected fractions from the Mono-S chromatography (not shown).Involvement of C-terminal Determinants for the Mitogenic Activity of HARPAs mentioned in the introduction, truncated forms of HARP at the C-terminal region have been identified in SW13 transfected with HARP cDNA and in Swiss 3T3 cells (21Souttou B.

Yoshizato K. Exp. Cell. Res. 1999; 246: 152-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Involvement of this C-terminal maturation in HARP mitogenic activity has not been clearly established, and, to further investigate this point, C-terminal truncated HARP proteins were produced in CHO-K1 cells.Two different C-terminal truncated mutants were constructed by adding a stop codon (Fig. 3 A): (i) HΔ129–136 in which the last 8 amino acids of HARP were suppressed but the C-terminal cluster of lysines was conserved and (ii) HΔ111–136 in which the consensus sequence, possibly involved in angiogenic activity (30Delbe J. Katsoris P. Milhiet P.E. Barritault D. Caruelle D. Courty J. Pathol. Biol. (Paris). 1999; 47: 352-357PubMed Google Scholar) and containing the cluster of lysines, was deleted. However, all the cysteines involved in disulfide bridges were conserved. As described above, expression plasmids coding for the mutant proteins were transfected in CHO-K1 cells, selected using G418 and the HARP expression levels of each stably transfected cell line were determined by HARP immunometric assay2 (data not shown). HARP proteins were purified from 0.4 liter of transfected CHO-K1 conditioned media according to the procedure described above, and isolated proteins were analyzed by Western blotting experiment with an anti-HARP antibody (Fig. 3 B). For each mutant proteins, the molecular weight observed was in agreement with the size of the deletion (17,200 and 14,500 for HΔ129–136 and HΔ111–136, respectively).Figure 3Mitogenic activity of wild type and mutant HARP produced from CHO-K1 cells. A, the full-length cDNA encoding HARP includes a signal peptide (hatched box) and two lysine-rich clusters (black box). HΔ129–136, a TAG stop codon, was introduced at position 129 (K, AAG); HΔ111–136, a TAA stop codon was introduced at position 111 (K, AAA). Wt HARP cDNA and the mutant forms were transfected in CHO-K1 cells. G418-resistant clones were selected as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, wt HARP or mutant proteins were purified from conditioned medium of each clone as described in Fig. 1, run on a 15% SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred to Immobilon-P membrane, and immunoblotted with an anti-HARP antibody (wt HARP,lane 1; HΔ111–136, lane 2; HΔ129–136,lane 3).

Previously, we showed that the proteasome mediates the clathrin-mediated endocytosis of the GHR.

Cytokines regulate different aspects of cellular growth, differentiation, and activation and play a critical role in immune and inflammatory responses. In response to GH, two GHR polypeptides dimerize, turning on a cascade of events leading to signal transduction by activating gene transcription in the cell nucleus and, at the same time, down-regulation and degradation of the receptor (2Argetsinger L.S. Carter-Su C. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1089-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 3Mellado M. Rodriguez-Frade J.M. Kremer L. von Kobbe C. de Ana A.M. Merida I. Martinez A., C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9189-9196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). One major characteristic of the cytokine receptor family is the absence of an intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. Upon dimerization, the GHR recruits and activates JAK2, a member of the Janus family of cytosolic kinases (4Frank S.J. Gilliland G. Kraft A.S. Arnold C.S. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2228-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 5VanderKuur J.A. Wang X. Zhang L. Cambell G.S. Allevato G. Billestrup N. Norstedt G. Carter-Su C. J. Biol.

Once bound, the two JAK2 molecules are in opposition and can transphosphorylate each other. Subsequently, the receptor chains become tyrosine phosphorylated allowing them to interact with other intracellular signaling components (6Carter-Su C. Smit L.S. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1998; 53: 61-83PubMed Google Scholar). JAK2 acts via special signal transducers and activators of transcription proteins (STATs), which dimerize and translocate to the nucleus to convey the appropriate signal to specific regulatory DNA-response elements (7Smit L.S. Meyer D.J. Billestrup N. Norstedt G. Schwartz J. Carter-Su C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 519-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 8Wang Y.D. Wood W.I. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 303-311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, JAK2 activation by GH facilitates initiation of various pathways including the Ras, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway (9Vanderkuur J.A. Butch E.R. Waters S.B. Pessin J.E. Guan K.L. Carter-Su C. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4301-4307Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 10Thirone A.C. Carvalho C.R.O. Saad M.J.A. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). GH-induced activation of the JAK-STAT signal transduction pathway is both rapid and transient. The molecular mechanism of JAK deactivation is still poorly understood. Part of the dephosphorylation of the GHR has been previously attributed to the activation of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 (11Hackett R.H. Wang Y.D. Sweitzer S. Feldman G. Wood W.I. Larner A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11128.0-11132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This enzyme was found to interact with JAK2, and GH stimulates the catalytic activity of SHP-1 (11Hackett R.H. Wang Y.D. Sweitzer S. Feldman G. Wood W.I. Larner A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11128.0-11132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Another candidate could be SHP-2 because it associates with the GHR and binding to JAK2 has also been reported. However, no dephosphorylation of JAK2 by SHP-2 could be demonstrated (12Yin T. Shen R. Feng G.S. Yang Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1032-1037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Recently, another negative regulatory pathway of the GH receptor signaling involving the SOCS (suppressor of cytokine signaling) proteins has been identified (13Ram P.A. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25561-35553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 14Adams T.E. Hansen J.A. Starr R. Nicola N.A. Hilton D.J. Billestrup N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1285-1287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The SOCS proteins appear to form part of a negative feedback loop that regulates cytokine signal transduction. Their expression is rapidly induced by activation of the JAK/STAT pathway (15Starr R. Willson T.A. Viney E.M. Murray L.J.L. Rayner J.R. Jenkins B.J. Gonda T.J. Alexander W.S. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. Hilton D.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (1816) Google Scholar). Another important system which down-regulates the GHR is the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This system regulates the degradation of nuclear and cytosolic proteins via the proteasome (16Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 761-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (1210) Google Scholar). The target proteins are first tagged with ubiquitin molecules to form a polyubiquitin chain, which is specifically recognized by the multisubunit proteasome complex, leading to their degradation. Proteasomes were found to be involved in regulating JAK/STAT pathways upon interleukin-2, -3, and erythropoietin stimulation (17Yu C.L. Burakoff S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14017-14020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 18Callus B.A. Mathey-Prevot B. Blood. 1998; 91: 3182-3192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Verdier F.

In the presence of specific proteasomal inhibitors, activation of both JAK and STAT molecules was sustained, although neither STAT nor JAK appeared to be ubiquitinated. These data indicate that proteasomes are involved in the down-regulation of the activation signals of specific cytokine receptors. An important factor in GHR down-regulation is its endocytosis. In the presence of ligand, GHR endocytoses rapidly via clathrin-coated pits (20Roupas P. Herington A.C. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1988; 57: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and its degradation occurs at least partially within the lysosome (21Murphy L.J. Lazarus L. Endocrinology. 1984; 115: 1625-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The ubiquitin system is required for ligand-induced GHR internalization (23Strous G.J. van Kerkhof P. Govers R. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3806-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). In particular, the UbE motif within the GHR cytosolic tail is involved in both GHR ubiquitination and ligand-induced endocytosis (22Govers R. ten Broeke T. van Kerkhof P. Schwartz A.L. Strous G.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In a Chinese hamster cell line carrying a temperature-sensitive E1 enzyme (ts20 cells), inactivation of E1 results in accumulation of nonubiquitinated GHRs at the plasma membrane, whereas internalization of the transferrin receptor is unaffected (23Strous G.J. van Kerkhof P. Govers R. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3806-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Recently, we showed that the proteasome is also involved in GHR down-regulation (24van Kerkhof P. Govers G. Alves dos Santos C.M. Strous G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1575-1580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). GHR internalization requires proteasomal action in addition to an active ubiquitin conjugation system. Specific proteasomal inhibitors block GH uptake of the full-length GHR, whereas a truncated receptor can endocytose undisturbed. In this report, we address the role of proteasome-mediated protein degradation in modulating GHR/JAK2 activity following GH stimulation. We show that the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 prolongs the GH-induced activity of both GHR and JAK2, presumably through stabilization of GHR and JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation. Furthermore, we observe that JAK2 is not only bound to the GHR at the cell-surface but also intracellularly, suggesting that the receptor and other signal transducing molecules are still active in endosomes. Chinese hamster ts20 cells were stably transfected as described previously (23Strous G.J. van Kerkhof P. Govers R. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3806-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Truncated receptors were constructed by introducing stop codons at various positions within the rabbit cDNA (25Govers R. van Kerkhof P. Schwartz A.L. Strous G.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4851-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These truncated GHR cDNAs were cloned in pcDNA3 (In Vitrogene Inc.) and transfected into ts20 cells, resulting in cell lines stably expressing receptors truncated at amino acid residues 399 and 369. The internalization-deficient mutant GHR F327A was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis, cloned and transfected into ts20 cells as described before (25Govers R. van Kerkhof P. Schwartz A.L. Strous G.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4851-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Stable, geneticin-resistant transfectants were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium (MEM-α) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin and streptomycin, 4.5 g/liter glucose, and 0.45 mg/ml geneticin. For experiments, cells were grown in the absence of geneticin at ∼70% confluence. Antibody to GHR was raised against amino acids 271–381 of the cytoplasmic tail (anti-GHR(T)) as previously described (23Strous G.J. van Kerkhof P. Govers R. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3806-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Antibody (Mab5) recognizing the luminal part of the GHR was from AGEN Inc., Parsippany, NJ. Antiserum against JAK2 was raised in rabbits against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the hinge region (amino acids 758–777) between domains 1 and 2 of murine JAK2. Polyclonal antibody against JAK2 and phosphotyrosine (4G10, anti-PY) were obtained from Upstate Biotechnologies Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Antiserum against human GH was raised in rabbits. Commercial anti-GH was from DAKOPATTS. hGH was a gift of Lilly Research Labs, Indianapolis, IN. Culture medium, fetal calf serum and geneticin were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. MG132 was from CalBiochem. Cells, grown in 10-cm dishes, were first incubated for 2 h at 30 °C in fetal calf serum-free MEM-α in the presence or absence of 20 μm MG132. After hGH (8 nm) incubation, cells were lysed on ice in 0.6 ml of lysis mix containing 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmNa3VO4, and 50 mm NaF in PBS. The immunoprecipitations were performed in 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% SDS, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmNa3VO4, and 50 mm NaF in PBS. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation and incubated with GHR antiserum or JAK2 antiserum for 2 h on ice. Protein A-agarose beads (Repligen Co., Cambridge, MA) were used to isolate the immune complexes. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with the same buffer and twice with 10-fold diluted PBS. Immune complexes were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS together with total cellular lysate and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride paper. The blots were immunostained using either Mab 4G10 (anti-PY), anti-GHR, or commercial JAK2 antibody. After incubating the blots with rabbit anti-mouse IgG (RAMPO) or protein A conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, antigens were visualized using the ECL system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells, grown on 10-cm dishes, were incubated 1 h on ice in MEM-α and supplemented with 20 mm Hepes and 8 nm hGH. The cells were then washed once to remove unbound GH and incubated at 30 °C for different periods of time. Cells were put on ice after which the cell surface-labeled GH was removed by two times 30 s with acidic solution of 50 mm glycine, 150 mmNaCl, pH 2.5. The cells were washed with PBS and lysed in 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 50 mm NaF in PBS. Immunoprecipitations were performed in the same buffer with GH antiserum for 2 h on ice. The immune complexes were treated as above. The blots were immunostained using Mab 4G10 or JAK2 antibody. To control for GH rebinding during and after cell lysis, lysis of cells expressing the (full-length) wtGHR was performed in the presence of increasing amounts of cell extracts from unstimulated (truncated) GHR 1–369 cells. Detection was performed with anti-GHR Mab5. To determine whether the proteasome is involved in modulating GHR activity, we examined the effects of the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 on GH-induced GHR phosphorylation. Using ts20 cells stably transfected with wtGHR, the time course of tyrosine phosphorylation of the GHR was determined following GH stimulation in the presence and absence of MG132 (Fig.1). In the absence of GH, no phosphorylated GHR was visible (Fig. 1 A). Upon GH stimulation, a broad 130-kDa band appeared, indicating the GHR tyrosine phosphorylation. The activity was maximal within 15 min and decreased thereafter. If MG132 was present, virtually no decrease of the GHR phosphorylation signal was observed even after 2 h. Reblotting with an anti-GHR antibody showed equivalent amounts of total immunoreactive protein in all samples, indicating that MG132 had little effect on the steady-state level of the GHR (Fig. 1 B). Because GH stimulation was continuous, it was not possible to discriminate the population of down-regulated receptors from newly synthesized receptors as done previously by a metabolically labeled pulse-chase experiment (24van Kerkhof P. Govers G. Alves dos Santos C.M. Strous G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1575-1580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Thus, prolonged phosphorylation of the receptor caused by the presence of MG132 could account for the sustained presence of the receptor at the cell surface. Our previous results have shown that MG132 prevents internalization of the GHR (24van Kerkhof P. Govers G. Alves dos Santos C.M. Strous G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1575-1580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). It is anticipated that a prolonged stay at the cell surface might result in a prolonged phosphorylated state of the GHR and of JAK2. To test this, we used the GHR F327A-transfected cells, which express receptors defective in internalization (25Govers R. van Kerkhof P. Schwartz A.L. Strous G.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4851-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 26Allevato G. Billestrup N. Goujon L. Galsgaard E.D. Norstedt G. Postel-Vinay M.C. Kelly P.A. Nielsen J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17210-17214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The kinetics of tyrosine phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of the GHR F327A were similar to the wtGHR (Fig. 1 C), reaching a maximum after 15 min and decreasing to basal levels after 2 h of GH treatment. However, in the presence of MG132, the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of the GHR F327A remained the same. Thus, down-regulation of the GHR phosphorylation depends on proteasomal action and is not related to the GH-induced endocytosis. Proteasomal inhibitors prolong signaling of the interferon-γ receptors after ligand stimulation, showing sustained tyrosine phosphorylation of both the receptors and JAK1/JAK3 (17Yu C.L. Burakoff S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14017-14020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To determine whether the effect of MG132 on GHR phosphorylation is caused by sustained activation of JAK2 kinase, anti-JAK2 immunoprecipitates were prepared from cell lysates and analyzed by immunoblotting with an antibody to phosphotyrosine. As shown in Fig.2 A, GH induced a transient phosphorylation of JAK2 with a maximum at 15 min in the absence of proteasomal inhibitor, declining to nearly basal levels after 2 h. However, treatment of the cells with MG132 prevented the dephosphorylation of JAK2, correlating well with the sustained GHR activity (compare lanes 4 and 8). Reblotting with an anti-JAK2 antibody showed similar amounts of immunoreactive protein in all samples indicating that MG132 had little effect on the stability of the protein (Fig. 2 B). Shorter preincubation periods with MG132 were as effective in stabilizing the tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2, suggesting that its mechanism of action is specific and not caused by general cell toxic effects. The same was observed for the GHR F327A mutant (Fig. 2, C and D). JAK2 activation was transient in this mutant, but as for the wtGHR, MG132 treatment prolonged JAK2 phosphorylation in a similar way. Taken together, these results demonstrate that MG132 prolongs the GH-induced activity of both GHR and JAK2, presumably through stabilization of GHR and JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation. Thus, the proteasome plays a role in decreasing GHR signal transduction. Previous reports have implicated JAK proteins in dephosphorylation by interaction with specific phosphatases (12Yin T. Shen R. Feng G.S. Yang Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1032-1037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar,27You M., Yu, D.H. Feng G.S. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1997; 272: 11128.0-11132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (68) Google Scholar) using FDP-C1 cells, demonstrated that the region in the GHR cytosolic tail between 521 and 540 is required for inactivation of the JAK/STAT signaling cascade, possibly via the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 that acts as a negative regulator. However, SHP-1 does not seem to associate with the GHR. Also the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2, another member of the protein-tyrosine phosphatase family that, unlike SHP-1, is ubiquitously expressed in vertebrate cells, was shown to form a complex with both the tyrosine phosphorylated receptor (GHR cytoplasmic domain residues 485–620) and JAK2 protein (30Kim S.-O. Jiang J. Yi W. Feng G.S. Frank S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2344-2354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We determined whether MG132 would also induce prolonged JAK2 phosphorylation upon GH treatment in a C-terminally truncated GHR. JAK2 was immunoprecipitated from GHR-(1–399)- and GHR-(1–369)-expressing cells and immunoblotted with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies for various times of GH treatment (Fig.3, A and C). In both cell lines, JAK2 showed tyrosine phosphorylation with no change over time. In accordance with the above mentioned studies, delayed dephosphorylation of the kinase was observed both in the presence and absence of MG132. Reprobing the blots with JAK2 antibody confirmed the presence of equal amounts of JAK2 protein in each sample (Fig. 3,B and D). These results suggest that the activation of a negative regulator (SHP-1 or SHP-2) through distal GHR tail domains and further association with JAK2 might be the important factor responsible for down-regulating the GHR/JAK2 phosphorylation in a proteasome-dependent way. Thus, inhibition of the proteasome by MG132 inhibits the dephosphorylation of JAK2, resulting in prolonged activity of both JAK2 and GHR. However, MG132 had no effect on SHP-2 phosphorylation upon GH induction, or on SHP-2 binding to both GHR and JAK2 (results not shown). As shown previously, proteasomal inhibitors do not affect internalization of GH via the GHR-(1–369) but effectively blocked endocytosis of GHR-(1–399, Ref. 24van Kerkhof P. Govers G. Alves dos Santos C.M. Strous G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1575-1580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). As JAK2 phosphorylation is similar in both cell lines, the data implicate that signaling might continue after endocytosis. Signaling via the GHR begins at the cell-surface. As demonstrated above using the endocytosis-defective GHR F327A cell line, the activation/deactivation (tyrosine phosphorylation/dephosphorylation) cycle can be initiated and completed at the cell-surface. The next question is whether signal transduction can continue after endocytosis. To address this, the activity of GHR had to be established after endocytosis. To accomplish this, we isolated GH·GHR complexes using anti-GH immunoprecipitation after acid treatment (Fig. 4). Dissociation of GH·GHR complexes does not occur at (endosomal) pH 5.5 (20Roupas P. Herington A.C. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1988; 57: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), indicating that GH remains complexed to its receptor, independent of its intracellular routing, unless it is localized to the lysosome. In that case, the ligand as well as the receptor is rapidly degraded (21Murphy L.J. Lazarus L. Endocrinology. 1984; 115: 1625-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Treating living cells with buffers of pH higher than 2.5 showed that GH was not removed from GHR at the cell surface, and only upon treatment with a buffer of pH 2.5 did GH detach from the receptor without interfering with the already internalized GH·GHR (results not shown). If no acidic treatment was performed, the total amount of wtGHR bound to GH coimmunoprecipitated during the different periods of time (Fig. 4 A, lanes 1–4). The same was observed for the truncated GHR-(1–369) (Fig. 4 B, lanes 9–12) and GHR F327A (Fig. 4 D, lanes 26–29). If the cells were kept on ice, acid treatment removed virtually all the GH from the cell surface and hardly any GHR was detectable (Fig. 4,lanes 5, 13, 21, and 30). Upon incubation at 30 °C, GH became acid-resistant indicating that GH·GHR complexes had entered the cells. Within 15 min, both wtGHR and GHR-(1–369) were detectable inside the cells. Longer periods of GH treatment resulted in a decrease of GH-bound internalized receptors in the endosomes (lanes 8 and 16). The GHR F327A was not observed inside the cells because internalization of this receptor was inhibited (lanes 30–33). In addition to the 130-kDa band of the GHR, a smear of bands (60–80 kDa) appeared, which only reacted with Mab5 (Fig. 4 A) and anti-GHR(T) (not shown) and not with anti-GHR C-terminal tail antibody (Fig. 4 C). No degradation products were visible if GHR-(1–369) was analyzed (not shown). These observations show that the partial degradation of the wtGHR starts from the C terminus very soon after GH binding. To exclude the possibility that during or after lysis GH is free to rebind endocytosed or cell-surface receptor, the same experiment for wtGHR was performed but excess of unstimulated GHR-(1–369) lysate was added during lysis (Fig. 5). If free GH is available to react with wtGHR at the cell surface or in endosomes, then an excess of GHR-(1–369) will compete for binding to free GH. If this would be the case, then GH immunoprecipitates blotted with anti-GHR (Mab5) should present GH complexes with both wtGHR and GHR-(1–369). As these receptors have different sizes but the same GH binding affinity, they can easily be distinguished by immunoblot. As observed on Fig. 5 A, wtGHR cells were treated with GH for 15 min and acid-treated. Addition of nonstimulated GHR-(1–369) lysate in different concentrations, did not result in GH complexes containing the truncated receptor. Addition of excess of lysate of untransfected ts20 cells to the wtGHR-expressing cells was also tested, with the same result. Fig. 5 B shows total cell lysates blotted with anti-GHR (Mab5), indicating the amount of the truncated GHR-(1–369) in the incubations. Performing the same experiment by lysing GH-treated GHR-(1–369) cells in the presence of unstimulated wtGHR lysate, no GH·wtGHR complexes were detected (results not shown). We then addressed the question of whether internalized GHR is able to bind JAK2. The same time course experiment was performed as in Fig. 4and analyzed for JAK2 molecules (Fig.6 A). To measure the total amount of JAK2 bound to the GH·GHR complex, no acidification was performed (lanes 1–3). In wtGHR-transfected cells upon acid wash, JAK2 coimmunoprecipitated with GH·GHR complexes after internalization (lanes 5 and 6). The same was observed in the GHR-(1–369) mutant (lanes 7–9). A faster migrating background band reacted with anti-JAK2 after cell acidification, presumably caused by proteolysis. As expected, the GHR F327A mutant did not show JAK2 binding after acidification. JAK2 was neither detectable in the anti-GH immunoprecipitates from untransfected ts20 cells (lane 13) nor unstimulated cells expressing the wtGHR, the GHR-(1–369), and the GHR F327A (lanes 1, 4, 7,and 10), indicating the efficiency of the acid-wash procedure. Similar amounts of JAK2 were found for the different cell lines as seen in Fig. 6 B. These results show that JAK2 is bound to the GHR inside the cell, suggesting that the receptor is capable of signaling in endosomes. To determine whether other proteins attached to the GH·GHR in endosomes are phosphorylated, cells expressing wtGHR and GHR-(1–369) were treated as described above and analyzed for phosphotyrosine-positive proteins. As seen in Fig. 7 A, GH induced the phosphorylation of a set of medium and high molecular weight proteins. Upon GH removal from the cell surface, the major phosphorylated protein (with apparent Mr above 187,000) was also present in the internalized GH·GHR complex, both in the wtGHR and GHR-(1–369). Untransfected ts20 cells only resulted in a background pattern (not shown). In the higher molecular weight range both wtGHR and JAK2 proteins are possible candidates, consistent with the results presented above. Surprisingly, internalized wild-type as well as truncated receptors presented roughly similar patterns of phosphorylated proteins. This can be explained by the fact that signaling proteins mainly interact with the membrane proximal region of the cytosolic tail of the GHR via JAK2. For the wtGHR (Fig.7 A, left panel) interpretation of the pattern is difficult, because of the large signal of tyrosine phosphorylation by the receptor itself. This is not the case for the truncated receptor, as it"

ATPases Associated with diverse cellular Activities family base pair(s) polymerase chain reaction 5-Fluoro-orotic acid polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis nucleotide excision repair In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, expression of genes required for the metabolism of galactose is controlled by the positive regulator Gal4 and the negative regulator Gal80. Gal4 is a transcriptional activator with an N-terminal DNA binding domain and a C-terminal activation domain. Partial deletion of the activation domain of Gal4 in the gal4D allele leads to a dramatic loss in the ability to activate transcription of GAL genes. Using a reporter gene assay, the gal4D protein was found to activate transcription from the GAL1/10 promoter to ∼4% of the level driven by wild-type Gal4 (1Swaffield J.C. Bromberg J.F. Johnston S.A. Nature. 1992; 357: 698-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar).

Consistent with this possibility, high level overexpression of gal4D from a multicopy vector rescues the ability to activate a reporter gene to ∼60%. 2J. C. Swaffield and S. A. Johnston, unpublished data. If suppression of gal4D is dependent on stabilization of an unstable protein, then levels of gal4D protein in the cell should correlate with suppression. To address this question, we made a set of congenic yeast strains carrying wild-type and mutant SUG1and SUG2 alleles. We used these strains to compare levels of gal4D protein in strains that suppressed the transcriptional phenotype of gal4D and those that did not. In addition to comparingsug1-1 and sug2-1 to their respective wild-types, we also wished to evaluate other alleles of SUG1 andSUG2. Alleles of SUG1 have been identified independently by Xu et al. (15Xu Q. Singer R.A. Johnston G.C. Mol. Cell.

We chose one of these alleles, sug1-20, to compare with sug1-1. We also wanted to compare sug2-1 to an allele isolated in a different manner. However, until recently, no SUG2 allele besides sug2-1 was known. In 1988 McCusker and Haber (16McCusker J.H. Haber J.E. Genetics. 1988; 119: 303-315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) isolated mutants exhibiting both cycloheximide resistance and temperature-sensitive lethality (crl). These strains have hypersensitivity to amino acid analogs and fail to arrest in G1 under some starvation conditions (17McCusker J.H. Haber J.E. Genetics. 1988; 119: 317-327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AfterSUG2 was cloned (3Russell S.J. Sathyanarayana U.G. Johnston S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32810-32817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) it became clear from mapping data thatcrl13 was an allele of SUG2(16McCusker J.H. Haber J.E. Genetics. 1988; 119: 303-315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 3J. E. Haber, personal communication. We have determined the mutation in the crl13 allele of SUG2, which we have designated sug2-13, and have compared its phenotype to that of sug2-1. In this work, we have produced a set of congenic strains carrying wild-type and mutant alleles of both SUG1 andSUG2. Using these strains we have shown that there is allele specificity to suppression of gal4D. Mutations in alleles ofSUG1 and SUG2 not selected for their ability to suppress gal4D do not do so. This has allowed us to explicitly test the hypothesis that the sug1-1 andsug2-1 mutations lead to alterations in the level of gal4D protein and that this accounts for rescue of the gal4Dphenotype. We find that the levels of gal4D protein are higher in strains carrying sug1 and sug2 mutations that do not suppress gal4D than in strains carrying thesug1-1 and sug2-1 mutations. Therefore, changes in the proteolysis of gal4D by the proteasome cannot account for the transcriptional effects of the sug1-1 and sug2-1mutations. James Haber and John McCusker supplied us with Y55-297 (crl13) and its congenic wild-type Y55 (CRL13). The SUG2 gene from 85 bp before the start codon to 200 bp after the stop codon was amplified by PCR from both strains and cloned using the TA cloning kit to produce pSJR187 (crl13) and pSJR188 (CRL13). The sequence of the entire gene was then determined by fluorescence-automated sequencing. There were several silent polymorphisms as compared with the data base sequence present in the SUG2 alleles amplified from both thecrl13 and wild-type strains. However, only one mutation in the crl13 strain resulted in an amino acid change. The codon for amino acid 231 was changed from CTA to CGA to create an L231R substitution. We designated this mutation sug2-13. The SUG2 locus from 208 bp before the start codon to 54 bp after the stop codon was amplified with oligos containing the ClaI site and blunt cloned into pUC118 to produce pSJR79. The sug2-1 mutation was inserted into this plasmid by site-directed mutagenesis to create pUC118-sug2-1. This plasmid was sequenced to confirm that only the desired mutation was present. A fragment containing the gene was liberated from the plasmid by digestion with ClaI. The plasmid containing the PCR-amplified and TA-cloned SUG2 gene containing the sug2-13 mutation (pSJR187) was digested withAge1 and SnaB1 to liberate a fragment from 42 bp before the start codon to 191 bp after the stop codon. These fragments were purified and transformed into Sc530 (SUG2::URA3 pMTL-SUG2), which is congenic to W303 (3Russell S.J. Sathyanarayana U.G. Johnston S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32810-32817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 18Thomas B.J. Rothstein R. Cell. 1989; 56: 619-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar). The transformants were plated to glucose medium. The plasmid pMTL-SUG2 expresses SUG2under control of the GAL1/10 promoter. BecauseSUG2 is an essential gene, this strain can only survive on galactose medium, which induces the GAL1/10 promoter. If a gene replacement event occurs that reintroduces SUG2 into its native location, the strain recovers its ability to grow on glucose. Transformants able to grow on glucose were patched and replica-plated to medium lacking uracil. Clones that could grow on glucose medium and were uracil auxotrophs were candidates for gene replacement events, because the deletion marker had been lost. TheSUG2 gene was amplified from these strains by PCR and was completely sequenced. Sequencing in both directions confirmed that the L231R mutation was present in the sug2-13 strain Sc677 and that the E300K mutation was present in the sug2-1 strain Sc671. GAL4 was deleted from these strains, and from the congenic wild-type W303, by transforming them with aGAL4::HIS3 fragment liberated from plasmid pJCS112 with BamHI. His+ colonies were patched and replica-plated to glucose and galactose media to confirm that they had lost the ability to use galactose as the sole carbon source. The loss of Gal4 was confirmed by Western blot of extracts of these strains after growth on raffinose, which does not repress synthesis of Gal4. The final set of congenic strains was Sc736 (sug2-1 GAL4::HIS3), Sc738 (sug2-13 GAL4::HIS3), and Sc748 (SUG2 GAL4::HIS3). The starting material for the production of these strains was pJS159, which contains the SUG1 locus as aXhoI/BamHI fragment. The sug1-1 andsug1-20 mutations were inserted into this plasmid by site-directed mutagenesis to produce pSJR171 and pSJR173, respectively. Fragments containing the wild-type and mutant genes were liberated from the plasmid with EcoRI/KpnI digestion and transformed into Sc500 (SUG1::URA3pMTL-SUG1), which is congenic to W303. Gene replacement events were selected as described above. The SUG1 gene was amplified from these strains by PCR and completely sequenced. Sequencing of the genes confirmed that the desired mutations had been introduced and that no other mutations were present. Sc654 contained the sug1-1 mutation, Sc658 contained the sug1-20mutation, and Sc507 was the congenic wild-type strain. GAL4was deleted from these strains as described above to give Sc729 (sug1-1 GAL4::HIS3), Sc733 (sug1-20 GAL4::HIS3), and Sc727 (SUG1 GAL4::HIS3), respectively. To test the interaction ofSUG1 alleles and the cdc68-1 mutation, strains Sc729 (sug1-1), Sc733 (sug1-20), and Sc727 (SUG1) were transformed with YepDE68-1 (a multicopy plasmid carrying the URA3 marker and expressing cdc68-1). These strains were then transformed with the BamHI fragment of pBM10 (LEU2) to disrupt the chromosomal CDC68gene. Transformants were selected on medium lacking leucine to select for integration events. To ensure that the chromosomal CDC68gene was disrupted, transformants were tested for their ability to grow on medium containing 5-FOA. Because CDC68 is an essential gene, yeast that carry CDC68 only on the URA3plasmid should not survive on 5-FOA. Accordingly, 5-FOA+ clones were discarded. The remaining strains were deduced to have the chromosomalCDC68 locus deleted and to carry cdc68-1 on the multicopy plasmid. The congenic set of strains produced was Sc761 (SUG1 CDC68::LEU2 YEp352-cdc68-1), Sc766 (sug1-1 CDC68::LEU2YEp352-cdc68-1), and Sc769 (sug1-20 CDC68::LEU2 YEp352-cdc68-1). Strains WCG4-11/22a (pre1-1 pre2-2) and yH129/14 (pre1-1 pre4-1) (19Heinemeyer W. Gruhler A. Mohrle V. Mahe Y. Wolf D. J. Biol.

GAL4 was deleted from these strains as described above to produce.Sc774 (pre1-1 pre2-2 GAL4::HIS3), Sc779 (pre1-1 pre4-1 GAL4::HIS3), and Sc782 (PRE1 PRE2 PRE4 GAL4::HIS3). Strains were grown in Yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (21Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Abelson J.N. Simon M.I. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. Methods in Enzymology.in: Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1991: 194Google Scholar) to stationary phase. TheA600 values of the cultures were normalized to 0.1 by dilution in water. Serial 10-fold dilutions were performed, and 10 μl of each dilution was spotted onto plates. Cycloheximide plates were prepared as described previously (16McCusker J.H. Haber J.E. Genetics. 1988; 119: 303-315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Temperature sensitivity assays were done on YEPD plates. Cycloheximide plates and control plates were grown for 3 days at 30 °C. Plates for the temperature sensitivity experiment were grown at either 30 °C or 37 °C for 3 days. Yeast strains were transformed with single-copy plasmids (derived from pSB32) expressing either gal4D (pSJR261) or wild-type Gal4 (pSJR263), or with a multicopy plasmid (derived from Yep351) expressing gal4D (pSJR268). In each case the encoded proteins were tagged at their N termini with three tandem copies of the T7 epitope tag (Novagen), and the GAL4 gene was expressed from its own promoter. The transformed strains were grown to stationary phase in complete medium lacking leucine (21Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Abelson J.N. Simon M.I. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. Methods in Enzymology.in: Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1991: 194Google Scholar), to select for the plasmid, with raffinose as the carbon source. The use of raffinose ensured that there was no selection for suppressors ofgal4D. Glucose was not used, because it represses the synthesis of Gal4. The cell suspensions were diluted as above and spotted to complete-leucine plates with glucose or galactose as the carbon source. Transformed strains were grown to stationary phase as above, then diluted into a larger volume of complete-leucine medium with raffinose as the carbon source. They were grown to an A600 of 0.8 (mid- to late-log for these strains), and 15 ml was harvested by centrifugation. The cells were washed once in ice-cold water, then suspended in 100 μl of 2× SDS loading buffer and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. At the same time the cells were harvested, another aliquot of the culture was diluted 1:10 with water containing 0.02% sodium azide. TheA600 of these samples was used to calculate a volume of 2× SDS loading buffer to add to the frozen samples so that they had equal concentrations of cells. After the appropriate dilution, the cells suspended in SDS loading buffer were boiled for 10 min. They were spun briefly to remove cell debris, then equal amounts of the supernatant were loaded onto an SDS-PAGE gel. A three-stage polyacrylamide gel (stacking 4%, top separating 10%, bottom separating 12.5%) was run in a Bio-Rad Protean apparatus overnight at 70 V with cooling by circulating water at 16 °C. The high percentage bottom stage of the gel was used to retard the low molecular mass cyclophilin (used as a loading control) during the long run required to separate Gal4 protein from a cross-reacting band with a similar electrophoretic mobility. Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore) in a Genie blotting apparatus (Idea Scientific) for 50 min at 24 V. The membranes were blotted with anti-T7 monoclonal antibody (Novagen) to detect Gal4 and with rabbit anti-cyclophilin antibody (a gift of K. Sykes). Membranes were developed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and the Renaissance chemiluminescence reagent. Despite the fact that mutations in SUG1 have been isolated in multiple different screens (1Swaffield J.C. Bromberg J.F. Johnston S.A. Nature. 1992; 357: 698-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 15Xu Q. Singer R.A. Johnston G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6025-6035Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 22Ghislain M. Udvardy A. Mann C. Nature. 1993; 366: 358-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), until recently no mutant alleles ofSUG2 besides sug2-1 were known. We wanted to investigate the allele specificity of gal4D suppression by alleles of SUG2. Therefore, we decided to identify the mutation in the crl13 allele of SUG2. TheSUG2 open reading frames were amplified from thecrl13 strain and its parental wild-type strain and were completely sequenced. Both of these strains were kindly provided by J. E Haber and J. H. McCusker. Two nucleotide changes were found in the SUG2 gene from the crl13 strain. Only one of these resulted in an amino acid change, substituting an arginine for a leucine at position 231. We will refer to this novel sug2allele as sug2-13. The mutation in sug2-1 results in a substitution of glycine 300 by a lysine (3Russell S.J. Sathyanarayana U.G. Johnston S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32810-32817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Unlike the G300K substitution encoded in sug2-1, the L231R substitution encoded in sug2-13 is within the Walker A nucleotide-binding motif of Sug2 (6Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 934-951Crossref Scopus (4269) Google Scholar, 23Beyer A. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2043-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). We produced a set of congenic strains carrying either thesug2-1, sug2-13, or wild-type SUG2alleles. These strains were produced by a two-step gene replacement strategy so that the mutant sug2 alleles were integrated at their native chromosomal loci (see “Experimental Procedures”). We verified that Sug2 protein was expressed at identical levels in each of these strains, demonstrating that neither of the mutant sug2alleles destabilized the Sug2 protein (data not shown). We also tested the sub-cellular localization of Sug2 and found that it was primarily nuclear in each strain as it is in wild-type yeast (data not shown) (24Russell S.J. Steger K.A. Johnston S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21943-21952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). So that the interaction of the sug2 alleles with different GAL4 variants could be tested, we deleted theGAL4 gene from each of these strains (see “Experimental Procedures”). The crl mutants were selected for temperature sensitivity and cycloheximide resistance. Therefore, the set of congenic strains we produced were tested for temperature sensitivity at 37 °C. These results, presented in Fig.1 A, are consistent with earlier reports. The sug2-13 strain is extremely temperature-sensitive just as reported for the crl13 strain (16McCusker J.H. Haber J.E. Genetics. 1988; 119: 303-315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, sug2-1 does not cause temperature sensitivity, consistent with previous results (3Russell S.J. Sathyanarayana U.G. Johnston S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32810-32817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The other reported phenotype of the crl13 strain was resistance to cycloheximide. Therefore, we tested the panel of congenic strains for this phenotype, but found no evidence for cycloheximide resistance in either sug2 strain (Fig. 1 A). Indeed, bothsug2 strains may be more sensitive to cycloheximide than the congenic wild-type strain. This was not surprising, as McCusker and Haber previously found that cycloheximide resistance did not segregate 2:2 when the crl13 strain was crossed into a different genetic background, the commonly used S288c strain (16McCusker J.H. Haber J.E. Genetics. 1988; 119: 303-315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, only a very small proportion of segregants from this cross displayed cycloheximide resistance. The authors concluded that there must be at least two suppressors of cycloheximide resistance in S288c, perhaps due to differences in permeability of the drug (16McCusker J.H. Haber J.E. Genetics. 1988; 119: 303-315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It seems likely that the W303 background of our congenic strains also contains such suppressors. In contrast, temperature sensitivity segregated 2:2 when the crl13 was crossed into the S288c background (16McCusker J.H. Haber J.E. Genetics. 1988; 119: 303-315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), consistent with our finding of temperature sensitivity in the W303 background. To test the suppression of gal4D by sug2 alleles we transformed each strain with a single-copy, centromeric vector carrying thegal4D gene. As controls, each strain was also transformed with a multicopy, 2 μm plasmid that overexpresses gal4D and a centromeric plasmid expressing wild-type GAL4. In each case the expressed Gal4 protein was epitope-tagged with three tandem copies of the T7 epitope tag at its N terminus to facilitate immunologic detection. Because the chromosomal copy of GAL4had been deleted in each of these strains, the epitope-tagged proteins expressed from the plasmids were the only source of Gal4 activity in these strains. Cultures were grown to stationary phase in selective medium with raffinose as the carbon source. After the densities of the cultures were normalized, serial dilutions were performed and the diluted cells were spotted to selective plates with either glucose or galactose as the carbon source. Fig. 2 Ashows that each of the strains grew well on glucose medium regardless of which plasmid they contained. This is expected, because Gal4 is dispensable for growth on glucose. As expected, each of the strains could grow on galactose medium when transformed with the wild-typeGAL4 plasmid or the plasmid overexpressing gal4D. However, only the sug2-1 strain could grow when transformed withgal4D on a single-copy plasmid. The finding thatsug2-13 does not suppress gal4D demonstrates allele specificity in suppression of gal4D bySUG2 alleles. To directly test the hypothesis that defective protein degradation by proteasomes allows gal4D protein accumulation and that this is responsible for suppression of gal4D by sug2-1, we determined the levels of the gal4D and Gal4 proteins in each strain. Strains were grown to mid- to late-log phase and harvested quickly. Equal numbers of cells were boiled directly in 2× SDS loading buffer. The samples were centrifuged briefly to remove cell debris and then separated by SDS-PAGE. Western blots were performed with anti-T7 epitope antibodies for detection of gal4D and Gal4 proteins and with anti-cyclophilin antibodies as an internal loading control. The levels of both the Gal4 and gal4D proteins were slightly increased compared with wild-type in thesug2-1 strain as shown in Fig. 2 B. Surprisingly, the levels of Gal4 and gal4D were more dramatically increased in thesug2-13 strain. Similar results were obtained in three separate experiments. These data show that suppression ofgal4D does not positively correlate with the levels of gal4D protein in the sug2 mutant strains. Of note, the dramatically increased levels of gal4D seen in the sug2-13strain are still much lower (∼20-fold) than those seen in strains carrying the plasmid overexpressing gal4D (Fig. 2 B). As previously shown, overexpression of gal4D on a multicopy plasmid (∼50-fold overexpression) conditions 60% of wild-type activation as assayed by β-galactosidase assays (8Swaffield J.C. Melcher K. Johnston S.A. Nature. 1996; 379: 658Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The threshold for growth on plates is ∼20% of wild-type activity. Therefore, assuming a linear response of activation to activator levels, the lack of complementation in the sug2-13 strain is not surprising. We conclude that stabilization of gal4D protein due to a defect in proteasomal proteolysis cannot explain suppression of gal4D bysug2-1. The sug1-1 and sug1-20 alleles ofSUG1 have been previously characterized. As summarized in the introduction, sug1-1 suppresses the mutant phenotype ofgal4D (1Swaffield J.C. Bromberg J.F. Johnston S.A. Nature. 1992; 357: 698-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The sug1-20 allele, in contrast, was identified as a suppressor of the transcription factorcdc68-1 (15Xu Q. Singer R.A. Johnston G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6025-6035Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Both alleles have been found to confer temperature sensitivity at 37 °C. Consistent with this, we found that both the sug1-1 and sug1-20 alleles conferred temperature sensitivity in the W303 background (Fig.3 A). To test suppression ofcdc68-1 by these sug1 alleles in the W303 background, a plasmid expressing cdc68-1 was transformed into each strain of the congenic set. The chromosomal CDC68gene was then deleted, and the strains were characterized as described under “Experimental Procedures.” These strains"

By studying a variety of Jak2 deletion proteins, we now show that the Jak2 protein motif231YRFRR is required for the co-association of this kinase with the AT1 receptor. We also used a full-length Jak2 protein containing a 231FAAAA amino acid substitution. Although this protein still autophosphorylated in response to angiotensin II, it did not co-associate with the AT1receptor. This uncoupling indicates that AT1/Jak2 co-association is not necessary for angiotensin II-induced Jak2 autophosphorylation and that Jak2 autophosphorylation per se is insufficient for AT1 receptor co-association. In response to angiotensin II, the Jak2-231FAAAA mutant will tyrosine phosphorylate Stat1. However, in the absence of AT1/Jak2 co-association, Stat1 did not translocate into the cell nucleus and failed to mediate gene transcription. This notable result indicates that Stat1 tyrosine phosphorylation alone is insufficient for Stat1 nuclear translocation. In summary, we now show that, although Jak2-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 is independent of receptor co-association, Jak2-mediated recruitment of Stat1 to the AT1 receptor is critical for Stat1 nuclear translocation and subsequent gene transcription.

It is vital for maintaining a wide variety of physiological responses, including salt and water balance, blood pressure, and vascular tone. These effects are transduced through a seven-transmembrane surface receptor called AT1 (1Sayeski P.P. Ali M.S. Semeniuk D.J. Doan T.N. Bernstein K.E. Regul. Pept. 1998; 78: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In addition to promoting the hydrolysis of heterotrimeric G proteins, activation of the AT1 receptor by angiotensin II also results in the activation of several non-receptor tyrosine kinases, including Jak2 (2Marrero M.B.

Jak2 is a member of the Janus family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases that also includes Jak1, Jak3, and Tyk2. These proteins are ∼130 kDa in mass and contain seven conserved Jak homology domains. Typically, Jak activation by a cytokine receptor leads to STAT1 activation and thus transmission of a signal from the extracellular surface of the cell into the nucleus (6Briscoe J. Kohlhuber F.

Recently, our laboratory examined proximal signaling events that mediate Jak/STAT activation by the AT1 receptor. Specifically, we demonstrated that the physical co-association of the AT1 receptor with Jak2 is dependent on the AT1receptor motif 319YIPP found within the carboxyl terminus of the receptor protein (10Ali M.S. Sayeski P.P. Dirksen L.B. Hayzer D.J. Marrero M.B. Bernstein K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23382-23388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Subsequently, we found that Jak2 must be catalytically active to associate with the AT1 receptor, as inhibition of Jak2 kinase activity either by pharmacological means or by a dominant-negative Jak2 protein greatly reduces AT1/Jak2 co-association (11Ali M.S. Sayeski P.P. Safavi A. Lyles M. Bernstein K.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 672-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The studies in this report examined whether, in addition to a functional kinase domain, there are any other requirements for Jak2 co-association with the AT1 receptor. Here we demonstrate that the Jak2 protein motif 231YRFRR, located in the amino-terminal portion of the molecule, is also required for co-association with the AT1 receptor. Conversion of the Jak2 protein motif from 231YRFRR to 231FAAAA functionally uncouples Jak2 autophosphorylation from AT1receptor binding, demonstrating that Jak2 autophosphorylation occurs independently of receptor co-association. When Jak2 fails to co-associate with the AT1 receptor, a functional consequence is that Stat1 fails to translocate into the nucleus and mediate gene transcription.

Construction of the pRC-WT, pRC-ATD, pRC-PKD, pRC-CTD, and pRC-AFL Jak2 expression vectors has been described (13Sayeski P.P. Ali M.S. Hawks K. Frank S.J. Bernstein K.E. Circ.

The following Jak2 deletion constructs were generated by polymerase chain reaction using Pfu DNA polymerase and cloned into pRC-AFL at the NotI/AflII restriction sites. The top strand oligonucleotides were as follows: pRC-68, 5′-CATGATAATGCGGCCGCAATGGTGGCTGCTTCTAAAGCTTG-3′; pRC-120, 5′-CATGATAATGCGGCCGCAATGCCTCATTGGTACTGTAGTGG-3′; pRC-168, 5′-CATGATAATGCGGCCGCAATGCCTGTGACTCATGAAACTCAG-3′; pRC-186, 5′-CATGATAATGCGGCCGCAATGAGAATAGCTAAGGAG-3′; pRC-211, 5′-CATGATAATGCGGCCGCAATGAAGTGCGTTCGAGCGAAG-3′; pRC-221, 5′-CATGATAATGCGGCCGCAATGCACATTTTAACCCGGAAG-3′; pRC-225, 5′-CATGATAATGCGGCCGCAATGCGGAAGCGAATCAGGTACAG-3′; pRC-230, 5′-CATGATAATGCGGCCGCAATGTACAGATTTCGCAGATTC-3′; and pRC-235, 5′-CATGATAATGCGGCCGCAATGTTCATTCAGCAATTCAGTC-3′ (the initiation methionine for each oligonucleotide is underlined). The bottom strand oligonucleotide for all constructs was 5′-GATACTGTCTGAGCGCACAGTTTC-3′ and utilized an internalAflII site. The pRC-240 plasmid was made by cutting pRC-ATD with AflII and closing with ligase. The pRC-FLAG-225, pRC-FLAG-235, and pRC-FLAG-240 constructs were made by placing the FLAG peptide sequence (DYKDDDDK) between the initiation methionine and the respective Jak2 sequence. Other than pRC-CTD, which lacks the Jak2 kinase domain, all deletion constructs were found to have readily detectable levels of tyrosine phosphorylation as measured by anti-phosphotyrosine Western blotting. The Jak2-Y231F and Jak2-231FAAAA mutants were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis system (Stratagene). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. AT1/Jak2 co-association in BSC-40 cells was done using the vaccinia virus transfection/infection protocol (17Fuerst T.R. Moss B. J. Mol.

Cells were seeded in 100-mm dishes and transfected at near-confluency with 10 μg of pHA-AT1 and 10 μg of Jak2 expression vector in 20 μl of Lipofectin. 4 h later, vaccinia virus clone vTF7-3 was added at a multiplicity of infection of 1.0 and incubated for 1 h. The medium was aspirated, and cells were incubated overnight in serum-containing medium and lysed 18–20 h after infection. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected exactly as described (10Ali M.S.

To prepare lysates, cells were washed with 2 volumes of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm Na3VO4 and lysed in 1.0 ml of ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing protease inhibitors (18Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997: 20.5.1-20.5.9Google Scholar). The samples were sonicated and incubated on ice for 1 h. Samples were spun at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were normalized using the Dcprotein assay (Bio-Rad). Normalized lysates (∼400 μg/ml) were immunoprecipitated for 2–16 h at 4 °C with 2 μg of antibody and 20 μl of Protein A/G Plus-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After centrifugation, protein complexes were washed three to five times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and resuspended in sample buffer. Bound proteins were boiled, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The immunoprecipitating anti-Jak2 pAb (HR758) and anti-HA mAb (12CA5) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and Roche Molecular Biochemicals, respectively. The anti-Tyr(P) mAb (PY20) and anti-Stat1 mAb (S21120) were from Transduction Laboratories. Proteins were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence exactly as described (19Sayeski P.P. Ali M.S. Harp J.B. Bernstein K.E. Circ. Res. 1998; 81: 1279-1288Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Blotting antibodies were anti-Jak2 pAb (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-Tyr(P) mAb (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-HA mAb (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), anti-Stat1 mAb (Transduction Laboratories), anti-FLAG mAb (Sigma), anti-Eps15 pAb (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-phospho-Stat1 pAb (Oncogene Research Products), and anti-SV40 large T antigen mAb (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After treatment with angiotensin II, nuclear extracts were prepared using the high salt method of extraction (20Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar, 21Shin T.H. Kudlow J.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 704-712PubMed Google Scholar, 22Sayeski P.P. Wang D. Su K. Han I.O. Kudlow J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1458-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Nuclear proteins were then dialyzed for 2 h at 4 °C against a 500× volume of solution containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9 at 4 °C), 20% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors. Nuclear proteins were quantitated, and equal amounts were separated by SDS-PAGE. The samples were Western-blotted as indicated. 100-mm dishes of 70% confluent COS-7 cell lines were transfected with the indicated DNA in 20 μl of Lipofectin for 5 h. The cells were then trypsinized and seeded into 6-well plates at 4.5 × 105 cells/well and allowed to attach overnight in serum-containing medium. The following afternoon, the cells were washed and placed into serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. The following morning, the cells were stimulated with angiotensin II, and luciferase activity was measured from detergent extracts in the presence of ATP and luciferin using the reporter lysis buffer system (Promega) and a luminometer (Turner Designs Model 20/20). Luciferase values are reported as relative light units. To determine regions of Jak2 that are required for co-association with the AT1 receptor, we utilized an in vivo vaccinia virus-based expression system that exploits two aspects of Jak2 protein expression. First, we previously demonstrated that overexpression of wild-type Jak2 in COS-7 cells results in AT1/Jak2 co-association independent of angiotensin II treatment (11Ali M.S. Sayeski P.P. Safavi A. Lyles M. Bernstein K.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 672-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The expressed Jak2 is activated not by angiotensin II, but rather by oligomerization and autophosphorylation of the highly expressed protein. Although the COS-7 expression system worked well for wild-type Jak2, we (12Sayeski P.P. Ali M.S. Safavi A. Lyles M. Kim S.O. Frank S.J. Bernstein K.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 12350-12358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) observed that some Jak2 deletion proteins are poorly expressed. To overcome this, BSC-40 cells (a vaccinia virus permissive cell line) are transfected with an expression vector containing the Jak2 cDNA under the control of the T7 promoter. The cells are then infected with a vaccinia virus that produces T7 polymerase. This system greatly enhances Jak2 protein expression and has been used to examine various aspects of Jak2 signal transduction (12Sayeski P.P. Ali M.S. Safavi A. Lyles M. Kim S.O. Frank S.J. Bernstein K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33131-33142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 13Sayeski P.P. Ali M.S. Hawks K. Frank S.J. Bernstein K.E. Circ.

This system was used to overexpress various Jak2 deletion constructs along with an HA-tagged AT1 receptor cDNA (pHA-AT1). As with the COS-7 cell system, Jak2 is activated by oligomerization/autophosphorylation of the highly expressed protein, which in turn binds the AT1 receptor. In vivoAT1/Jak2 co-association is measured by immunoprecipitating with anti-HA mAb and blotting with anti-Jak2 pAb. Prior to assessing co-immunoprecipitation of Jak2 with the AT1 receptor, several controls were performed. First, we demonstrated that overexpression of Jak2 required the presence of both the transfected cDNA and infection of the recombinant vaccinia virus, as omission of either one resulted in the loss of overexpression (data not shown). Second, we confirmed that the vaccinia-derived Jak2 protein was post-translationally modified by tyrosine phosphorylation and was catalytically active (data not shown). To demonstrate specificity of the co-immunoprecipitation system, BSC-40 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding wild-type Jak2 (pRC-WT) and the HA-tagged AT1 receptor under the control of the T7 promoter. The cells were then infected with vaccinia virus clone vTF7-3, which produces T7 polymerase. Lysates were prepared 18–20 h after infection. The lysates were then immunoprecipitated with anti-HA mAb and blotted with anti-Jak2 pAb (Fig.1 A). AT1/Jak2 co-association was seen only when the Jak2 plasmid was present (lane 3 versus lanes 1 and 2). Furthermore, omission of either the HA-tagged AT1 receptor plasmid (lane 4) or the immunoprecipitating anti-HA mAb (lane 5) resulted in specific loss of Jak2 co-association, indicating that neither was Jak2 immunoprecipitated nonspecifically by anti-HA mAb nor was Jak2 binding the Protein A/G-agarose nonspecifically. Using this system, we then coexpressed the HA-tagged AT1receptor with several Jak2 deletion constructs. A schematic representation of these constructs is shown as Fig. 1 B. Initially, expression vectors encoding wild-type Jak2, an amino-terminal deletion (ATD), an internal deletion (PKD), or a C-terminal deletion (CTD) were utilized. As shown in Fig.2 A (upper panel), both wild-type Jak2 and the pseudo-kinase deletion (PKD; Δ523–746) co-associated with the receptor. However, the amino-terminal deletion (ATD; Δ1–240) and the C-terminal deletion (CTD; Δ1000–1129) did not. We confirmed that all Jak2 proteins were expressed by immunoprecipitating and Western blotting aliquots from these same samples with anti-Jak2 pAb (Fig. 2 A, lower panel). We believe the inability of the CTD mutant to bind the receptor is due to the loss of the kinase domain since previous work demonstrated that inhibition of Jak2 kinase activity either by pharmacological means or by rendering the kinase domain inactive by a dominant-negative mutation prevents AT1/Jak2 co-association (11Ali M.S. Sayeski P.P. Safavi A. Lyles M. Bernstein K.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 672-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To further analyze the amino terminus of Jak2 as being important for binding the AT1 receptor, we tested the hypothesis that the initial 240 amino acids of Jak2 are required for efficient co-association with the AT1 receptor. For these experiments, we used the AflII deletion construct (AFL; Δ251–473). As shown in Fig. 2 B (upper panel), the AFL mutant was able to co-associate with the HA-tagged AT1 receptor in vivo. In Fig. 2 B(lower panel), we confirmed expression of the individually transfected Jak2 proteins. Although these data indicate that amino acids 251–473 are not required for binding the AT1receptor, they lead to the hypothesis that amino acids 1–240 of Jak2 are specifically required for binding the AT1 receptorin vivo. To test this hypothesis, progressive amino-terminal deletions of the AFL mutant were made at amino acids 68, 120, 168, and 240. Using the same system, BSC-40 cells were cotransfected with pHA-AT1and the indicated Jak2 deletion expression vectors and then infected with vaccinia virus. AT1/Jak2 co-association was measured by immunoprecipitating the cell lysates with anti-HA mAb and Western blotting with anti-Jak2 pAb (Fig. 2 C, upper panel). We observed that the AFL, 68, 120, and 168 deletion proteins all bound the receptor. However, the 240 deletion did not. We confirmed expression of all the Jak2 deletion proteins by immunoprecipitating and blotting equal aliquots from these same samples with anti-Jak2 pAb (Fig. 2 C, lower panel). These results indicate that the AT1 receptor-binding region is located between amino acids 168 and 240. Jak2 deletion molecules were then generated at amino acids 186, 211, 221, and 240. Another round of co-association was performed using the same vaccinia virus-based in vivo assay. We found that Jak2 deletions 168, 186, 211, and 221 all co-associated with the HA-tagged AT1 receptor, whereas the 240 mutant did not (Fig.2 D, upper panel). As before, we confirmed expression of all Jak2 deletions by immunoprecipitating and Western blotting equal aliquots from these same samples with anti-Jak2 pAb (Fig. 2 D, lower panel). These data indicate that an important AT1-binding region of Jak2 is located between amino acids 221 and 240. Deletion mutants were then made at amino acids 225, 230, and 235, and AT1 co-association was assessed as described above (Fig. 2 E, upper panel). This revealed that deletion proteins 221, 225, and 230 co-associated with the AT1 receptor, whereas Jak2 deletion proteins 235 and 240 did not. Expression of all Jak2 proteins was confirmed by immunoprecipitating and Western blotting equal aliquots of these samples with anti-Jak2 pAb (Fig. 2 E, lower panel). These data suggest that one region of Jak2 that facilitates co-immunoprecipitation with the AT1 receptor is located between amino acids 231 and 235. One issue that concerned us, however, was the appearance of a lower band of ∼68 kDa that was observed with many of the Jak2 deletion constructs. The protein appeared to be Jak2-related, as it was immunoreactive against anti-Jak2 pAb and was never seen when cells were transfected with the empty vector control. To better understand the nature of this protein, we generated three additional Jak2 deletion constructs: pRC-FLAG-225, pRC-FLAG-235, and pRC-FLAG-240. These molecules were modified by placing the FLAG peptide sequence (DYKDDDDK) between the initiator methionine and the respective Jak2 sequence. This allowed us to Western blot these proteins with either anti-Jak2 pAb or anti-FLAG mAb. These studies demonstrated that the lower bands were a truncated form of Jak2 that lacked the amino-terminal portion of the molecule; loss of the amino-terminal FLAG peptide sequence resulted in a shorter protein that was no longer immunoreactive with the anti-FLAG antibody, but was reactive with the anti-Jak2 antibody (data not shown). Consistent with our previous results, coexpression of these three constructs with the HA-tagged AT1 receptor demonstrated that pRC-FLAG-225 was able to coprecipitate with the HA-tagged AT1 receptor, whereas pRC-FLAG-235 and pRC-FLAG-240 were not (data not shown). In summary, these data confirm our previously published work (11Ali M.S. Sayeski P.P. Safavi A. Lyles M. Bernstein K.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 672-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) demonstrating that Jak2 must possess a functional kinase domain to bind the AT1 receptor; deletion of the kinase domain abrogates AT1/Jak2 co-association. In addition, the data demonstrate for the first time that Jak2 must possess amino acids 231–235, encoding the 231YRFRR protein motif, to coprecipitate with the AT1 receptor in vivo; constructs lacking 231YRFRR fail to bind the AT1 receptor. The vaccinia virus deletion analysis studies presented in Figs. 1 and 2 were performed without angiotensin II treatment. To examine the role of the Jak2 231YRFRR motif in ligand-mediated binding to the AT1 receptor, we generated two additional Jak2 molecules. The first was a full-length Jak2 in which the 231YRFRR motif was converted to 231FAAAA (Jak2-231FAAAA). The second was a full-length Jak2 containing a single Y231F point mutation (Jak2-Y231F). To evaluate the Jak2-231FAAAA construct, COS-7 cells were transiently cotransfected with pHA-AT1 and this plasmid. The cells were then treated with angiotensin II, and ligand-dependent AT1/Jak2 co-association was measured. We found that the Jak2-231FAAAA mutant did not co-associate with the AT1 receptor in response to angiotensin II (Fig.3 A, upper panel). We confirmed equal expression of both wild-type and Jak2-231FAAAA mutant proteins by immunoprecipitating and Western blotting equal aliquots from these samples with anti-Jak2 pAb (Fig. 3 A, lower panel). In contrast to this result, the Y231F mutant bound the AT1 receptor in a manner that was virtually identical to wild-type Jak2, indicating that in the context of the 231YRFRR motif, tyrosine 231 appears to provide a structural contribution rather than a phosphotyrosine binding residue (data not shown). To determine whether the Jak2-231FAAAA mutant autophosphorylates in response to angiotensin II, COS-7 cells were transfected as described for Fig. 3 A, but the lysates were then immunoprecipitated with anti-Jak2 pAb. The samples were first blotted with anti-Tyr(P) mAb to measure the angiotensin II-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 (Fig.3 B, upper panel). These data clearly show that both the wild-type and 231FAAAA mutant proteins were tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to angiotensin II. They also show that, although Jak2-231FAAAA was unable to bind the receptor in response to ligand, it was certainly capable of tyrosine autophosphorylation. We confirmed equal precipitation of Jak2 protein by blotting these same samples with anti-Jak2 pAb (Fig. 3 B,lower panel). When COS-7 cells were transfected with an empty vector control in place of Jak2-231FAAAA, we observed virtually no tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 in response to angiotensin II (data not shown). This is because non-transfected COS-7 cells have very little endogenous Jak2. Thus, the response seen in cells transfected with Jak2-231FAAAA is not due to endogenous (wild-type) Jak2, but is due to the transfected construct. The experiments in Fig. 3 indicate that, although Jak2-231FAAAA was capable of tyrosine autophosphorylation, it was unable to bind the AT1 receptor in response to angiotensin II. We then measured the angiotensin II-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1. This protein is a substrate of Jak2 and is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to angiotensin II (2Marrero M.B. Schieffer B. Paxton W.G. Heerdt L. Berk B.C. Delafontaine P. Bernstein K.E. Nature. 1995; 375: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 6Briscoe J. Kohlhuber F. Muller M. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 336-340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding the AT1receptor and an empty vector control, wild-type Jak2, or Jak2-231FAAAA. 2 days later, the cells were treated with angiotensin II, and the resulting lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Tyr(P) mAb and blotted with anti-Stat1 mAb (Fig.4 A). In the absence of transfected Jak2 expression vector, no Stat1 phosphorylation was observed in this system. In contrast, addition of wild-type Jak2 plasmid resulted in the angiotensin II-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1. When the Jak2-231FAAAA mutant protein was transfected into cells, we found that it phosphorylated Stat1 in a manner that was identical to that of wild-type Jak2. To better establish a time course for angiotensin II-mediated Stat1 tyrosine phosphorylation and to measure Stat1 tyrosine phosphorylation by an alternate protocol, transfected COS-7 cells were treated with angiotensin II for periods of 0–30 min. A reciprocal protocol was then performed whereby the lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Stat1 mAb and Western-blotted with anti-phospho-Stat1 pAb (Fig.4 B, upper panel). This blotting antibody is specific for phosphorylated Stat1 protein at tyrosine 701, a site of phosphorylation that correlates with Stat1 activation (24Schindler C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar, 25Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3401) Google Scholar). These data showed that Jak2-231FAAAA phosphorylated Stat1 over a time course that was nearly identical to that of wild-type Jak2, with peak Stat1 tyrosine phosphorylation occurring between 3 and 6 min after angiotensin II treatment for both groups. Furthermore, the alternate protocol produced a result that was similar to that in Fig.4 A. Collectively, these results indicate that Jak2-231FAAAA is not only capable of autophosphorylation, but is also able to phosphorylate a substrate in response to angiotensin II. Given that Jak2-231FAAAA is able to mediate Stat1 tyrosine phosphorylation, we next investigated whether it could mediate Stat1 nuclear translocation. COS-7 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding the AT1 receptor and either wild-type Jak2 or Jak2-231FAAAA. After angiotensin II treatment, nuclear proteins were isolated and then separated via SDS-PAGE. After transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes, Stat1 nuclear translocation was measured by Western blotting the samples with anti-Stat1 mAb (Fig.5 A). In response to angiotensin II, Stat1 was found only in the nucleus of cells transfected with wild-type Jak2 plasmid, but not in that of cells transfected with Jak2-231FAAAA. To establish a better time course of Stat1 nuclear translocation and to determine the efficiency and specificity of the nuclear extraction procedure, COS-7 cells were transfected exactly as described for Fig. 5 A, but were then treated with 10−7m angiotensin II for 0, 10, 20, 30, 45, and 60 min. First, the samples were Western-blotted with anti-Stat1 mAb to assess the time course of Stat1 nuclear translocation (Fig. 5 B, upper panel). This result reconfirmed that Stat1 translocated into the nucleus of cells that received wild-type Jak2 plasmid and angiotensin II, but not into that of cells that received Jak2-231FAAAA, regardless of angiotensin II treatment. Analysis of three independent experiments indicated that the accumulation of Stat1 in the nucleus of cells transfected with wild-type Jak2 peaked ∼20–30 min after angiotensin II addition, whereas cells that received Jak2-231FAAAA failed to mediate ligand-dependent Stat1 nuclear translocation. To determine the efficiency and specificity of the nuclear extraction procedure, the membrane was stripped and Western-blotted with an antibody directed against the SV40 large T antigen (Fig. 5 B, middle panel). The large T protein is highly abundant in COS-7 cells and is found only in the nucleus of these cells (26Lane D.P. Crawford L.V. Nature. 1979; 278: 261-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1772) Google Scholar, 27DeCaprio J.A. Ludlow J.W. Figge J. Shew J.Y. Huang C.M. Lee W.H. Marsillo E. Paucha E. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1988; 54: 275-283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar). The results indicated that the samples were of nuclear origin as determined by the amount of large T protein found in each sample relative to a COS-7 whole cell lysate sample. To demonstrate that the nuclear preparations were devoid of cytoplasmic contamination, the membrane was blotted with an antibody directed against the cytoplasmic protein marker Eps15 (Fig.5 B, bottom panel) (28Fazioli F. Minichiello L. Matoskova B. Wong W.T. Di Fiore P.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5814-5828Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 29Yu C.L. Jin Y.J. Burakoff S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 599-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The lack of Eps15 in the nuclear extracts indicated that the Stat1 was of nuclear origin and not from cytoplasmic contamination. Collectively, these data show that, although Jak2-231FAAAA is capable of autophosphorylation and tyrosine phosphorylating Stat1, its failure to co-associate with the AT1 receptor results in the failure of Stat1 to translocate into the nucleus. This result is reminiscent of the growth hormone-mediated activation of Stat3; recruitment of Stat3 to the growth hormone receptor is critically dependent on Jak2 kinase (30Yi W. Kim S.O. Jiang J. Park S.H. Kraft A.S. Waxman D.J. Frank S.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1425-1443PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the functional impact of the Jak2-231FAAAA mutation, we chose to investigate angiotensin II-dependent, Stat1-mediated gene transcription. For this assay, COS-7 cells were transfected as described for Fig. 5, but we also included a luciferase reporter plasmid containing a Stat1-binding,sis-inducible element. This plasmid contains a tandem repeat of a minimal DNA enhancer element, the thymidine kinase TATA-containing promoter, and the firefly luciferase cDNA (31Chen W.S. Lazar C.S. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. Gill G.N. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1987; 328: 820-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Each copy of the DNA enhancer contains a sis-inducible element, a serum response element, and an AP-1-binding site. We have previously demonstrated that this plasmid is a good indicator of Jak/STAT-mediated gene transcription (12Sayeski P.P. Ali M.S. Safavi A. Lyles M. Kim S.O. Frank S.J. Bernstein K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33131-33142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 16Frank S.J. Yi W. Zhao Y. Goldsmith J.F. Gilliland G. Jiang J. Sakai I. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14766-14785Google Scholar). The transfected cells were then treated with angiotensin II for varying times, and luciferase activity was measured (Fig. 6). Transfection of the Jak2-231FAAAA mutant resulted in substantially reduced angiotensin II-mediated luciferase activity with respect to wild-type Jak2 controls. The greatest difference in luciferase values between the two groups occurred 24 h after angiotensin II addition (p < 0.00001; n = 6 for each point). These data indicate that the failure of Jak2-231FAAAA to facilitate Stat1 nuclear translocation also impairs Stat1-dependent transcriptional activation. This work is significant for three fundamental reasons. First, we have identified a minimal region of Jak2 (231YRFRR) that is required for Jak2 co-association with a cell-surface receptor. Second, the generation of the Jak2-231FAAAA mutant functionally uncoupled ligand-mediated Jak2 autophosphorylation from AT1receptor co-association. Third, the work suggests that when Jak2 fails to bind the AT1 receptor, one functional consequence is that Stat1 does not translocate into the nucleus and therefore fails to mediate gene transcription. In regard to 231YRFRR-mediated receptor co-association, exactly how 231YRFRR mediates the binding of Jak2 with the AT1 receptor is not fully understood. Our data suggest that it is probably a structural motif rather than a simple phosphotyrosine interaction in that the Jak2-Y231F mutant bound the AT1receptor, whereas the Jak2-231FAAAA mutant did not. Consistent with our observation is a report describing a naturally occurring Jak3 mutation from a patient with autosomal severe combined immunodeficiency; a single Y100C amino acid substitution prevents co-association of Jak3 with the common γ-chain of the interleukin-2 receptor (32Cacalano N.A. Migone T.S. Bazan F. Hanson E.P. Chen M. Candotti F. O'Shea J.J. Johnston J.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1549-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Similar to our results, the authors of this report concluded that Tyr100 does not mediate a phosphotyrosine-dependent interaction, but rather contributes to a larger structural motif, as the Y100C mutation disrupts receptor co-association, whereas a Y100F mutation does not. The amino acid sequence immediately downstream of Tyr100 is100YRLRF, and this bears some homology to the231YRFRR motif described in this report. With respect to the second point, when COS-7 cells are transfected with Jak2-231FAAAA and then treated with angiotensin II, Jak2-231FAAAA autophosphorylates, but does not co-associate with the AT1 receptor. This observation suggests that ligand-mediated Jak2 autophosphorylation has therefore been uncoupled from AT1 receptor co-association. Since the Jak2-231FAAAA mutant can be activated independently of receptor co-association, one interpretation is that Jak2 autophosphorylation temporally precedes receptor co-association. The current findings are important in that they strongly suggest that AT1/Jak2 co-association is not necessary for angiotensin II-induced Jak2 activation and that Jak2 activation, although necessary, is not sufficient for its interaction with the AT1 receptor (11Ali M.S. Sayeski P.P. Safavi A. Lyles M. Bernstein K.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 672-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Perhaps most significant is the observation that when Jak2 fails to bind the AT1 receptor, Stat1 does not translocate into the nucleus and therefore fails to mediate gene transcription. The data in Fig. 4 demonstrate that Stat1 tyrosine phosphorylation alone is insufficient for Stat1 nuclear translocation, and the data in Fig. 5indicate that failure of Jak2 to bind the AT1 receptor correlates with markedly decreased Stat1 nuclear translocation. Our finding that Stat1 tyrosine phosphorylation alone is insufficient for Stat1 nuclear localization has precedent in other published studies. Herrington et al. (33Herrington J. Rui L. Luo G., Yu- Lee L.Y. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5138-5145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) reported that a Stat5b protein with a small mutation in the DNA-binding region was defective in nuclear location despite its ability to be tyrosine-phosphorylated and to dimerize in response to ligand. Similarly, Strehlow and Schindler (34Strehlow I. Schindler C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28049-28056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) reported a modified Stat1 protein that was phosphorylated on tyrosine and that dimerized, but was unable to be transported to the nucleus. Although these reports described a phenotype similar to what we observed with Jak2-231FAAAA, in both studies, the phenotype was a direct result of a STAT structural mutation. Nonetheless, these studies support our observation by providing other examples of STAT proteins that are phosphorylated on tyrosine and that dimerize, but are unable to transport to the nucleus. We recently reported that, in response to angiotensin II, Jak2 not only serves as a Stat1 kinase, but also acts as a molecular bridge in recruiting Stat1 to the AT1 receptor (35Ali M.S. Sayeski P.P. Bernstein K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15586-15593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). One interpretation of the Jak2-231FAAAA data presented here is that recruitment of Stat1 to the AT1 receptor by wild-type Jak2 further modifies Stat1 in a manner that promotes its nuclear translocation. The exact modification(s) that occur at the AT1 receptor and whether this phenomenon is applicable to other STAT family members is under intense investigation. The concept that Jak2 acts as a molecular bridge in recruiting STAT proteins to a cell-surface receptor is not without precedent. In the case of growth hormone, Jak2 acts as a scaffold in recruiting Stat3 to the growth hormone receptor (30Yi W. Kim S.O. Jiang J. Park S.H. Kraft A.S. Waxman D.J. Frank S.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1425-1443PubMed Google Scholar). The present data are significant in that they extend this observation by demonstrating that when Jak2 fails to act as a scaffold in recruiting Stat1 to the AT1 receptor, one consequence is that Stat1-mediated gene transcription is severely compromised. In summary, this work provides novel insight into the mechanism of Jak2 activation and receptor co-association. Specifically, it defines a region of Jak2 that is required for receptor co-association and advances our understanding of the temporal sequences that occur when the Jak/STAT signaling pathway is activated. Most importantly, this work establishes a correlation between the loss of a Jak2 signaling complex at the level of a cell-surface receptor with the loss of transcriptional regulation within the nucleus.

https://openalex.org/W2042779793,"Heat shock protein 90 (hsp90) is a chaperone required for the proper folding and trafficking of many proteins involved in signal transduction. We tested whether hsp90 plays a role as a chaperone for GC-A, the membrane guanylate cyclase that acts as a receptor for atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). When cultured cells expressing recombinant GC-A were treated with geldanamycin, an inhibitor of hsp90 function, the ANP-stimulated production of cyclic GMP was inhibited. This suggested that hsp90 was required for GC-A processing and/or stability. A physical association between hsp90 and GC-A was demonstrated in coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Treatment with geldanamycin disrupted this association and led to the accumulation of complexes containing GC-A and heat shock protein 70 (hsp70). Protein folding pathways involving hsp70 and hsp90 include several pathway-specific co-chaperones. Complexes between GC-A and hsp90 contained the co-chaperone p50cdc37, typically found associated with protein kinase·hsp90 heterocomplexes. GC-A immunoprecipitates did not contain detectable amounts of Hop, FKBP51, FKBP52, PP5, or p23, all co-chaperones found in hsp90 complexes with other signaling proteins. The association of hsp90 and p50cdc37 with GC-A was dependent on the kinase homology domain of this receptor but not on its ANP-binding, transmembrane, or guanylate cyclase domains.

Pitari G.M. Kazerounian S. Ruiz-Steward I. Park J. Schulz S. Chepenik K.P. Waldman S.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 375-413PubMed Google Scholar). This receptor is important in cardiovascular homeostasis; mice lacking the ANP receptor are hypertensive (1Lucas K.A. Pitari G.M. Kazerounian S. Ruiz-Steward I. Park J. Schulz S. Chepenik K.P. Waldman S.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 375-413PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of ANP to the extracellular domain of GC-A results in the activation of the intracellular guanylate cyclase catalytic domain and production of the second messenger, cyclic GMP (1Lucas K.A. Pitari G.M. Kazerounian S. Ruiz-Steward I. Park J. Schulz S. Chepenik K.P. Waldman S.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 375-413PubMed Google Scholar). The intracellular portion of the ANP receptor contains, in addition to a cyclase domain, a protein kinase-like domain (1Lucas K.A. Pitari G.M. Kazerounian S. Ruiz-Steward I. Park J. Schulz S. Chepenik K.P. Waldman S.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 375-413PubMed Google Scholar). This domain lacks protein kinase activity, and its function is incompletely understood. It has an autoinhibitory role, however, repressing cyclase activity in the absence of bound hormone (2Chinkers M. Garbers D.L. Science. 1989; 245: 1392-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 3Koller K.J. DeSauvage F.J. Lowe D.G. Goeddel D.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2581-2590Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In the course of our studies of the ANP receptor, which is regulated by phosphorylation, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify a protein-serine/threonine phosphatase that binds specifically to the kinase-like domain of the receptor (4Chinkers M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11075-11079Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). This phosphatase, designated PP5, may mediate ANP receptor desensitization. Heat shock protein 90 (hsp90) and heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) are molecular chaperones required for the proper folding and trafficking of many proteins involved in signal transduction (5Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1543) Google Scholar, 6Buchner J. Trends. Biochem.

Biol. 2000; 10: 46-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In general, this process involves the sequential formation of complexes between newly synthesized proteins and hsp70 and then with hsp90. A variety of co-chaperones is also present in the complexes with heat shock proteins; which co-chaperones are present depends on the protein being folded. Mature steroid receptor complexes with hsp90, for example, typically contain a large immunophilin and the small acidic protein p23 as co-chaperones. Protein kinase complexes with hsp90, on the other hand, typically contain the co-chaperone designated p50cdc37(5Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1543) Google Scholar, 6Buchner J. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 136-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 7Pearl L.H. Prodromou C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 46-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The co-chaperones present in the final hsp90 heterocomplex can be critical to the function of the hsp90 client protein. For example, which large immunophilin is present in glucocorticoid receptor·hsp90 complexes determines receptor binding affinity (8Reynolds P.D. Ruan Y. Smith D.F. Scammell J.G. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 84: 663-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 9Denny W.B. Valentine D.L. Reynolds P.D. Smith D.F. Scammell J.G. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4107-4113Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and p50cdc37 is required for proper folding of some protein kinases (10Hunter T. Poon R.Y.C. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 157-161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Although the hsp90 folding pathway has been best characterized in studies of the maturation of newly synthesized steroid receptors and protein kinases, a number of other signaling proteins that make use of this pathway have been identified recently (7Pearl L.H. Prodromou C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 46-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Such discoveries have in large part been made possible by the availability of the drug geldanamycin, which interferes with hsp90 function by blocking its binding site for ATP (11Neckers L. Mimnaugh E. Schulte T.W. Drug Resistance Updates. 1999; 2: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that PP5 binds to hsp90 and that it is a major component of glucocorticoid receptor·hsp90 heterocomplexes (12Chen M.-S. Silverstein A.M. Pratt W.B. Chinkers M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32315-32320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar,13Silverstein A.M. Galigniana M.D. Chen M.-S. Owens-Grillo J.K Chinkers M. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16224-16230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). This raised the question of whether the association of PP5 with the kinase-like domain of the ANP receptor in the yeast two-hybrid system was direct or whether it might be mediated by the binding of hsp90 to both the ANP receptor and PP5. We set out, therefore, to test whether the ANP receptor was associated with the hsp90 complexes. We report here that the ANP receptor is associated with hsp90 and the co-chaperone p50cdc37 via its kinase-like domain and that this association is important for its function. Geldanamycin was obtained from the Drug Synthesis and Chemistry Branch of the National Cancer Institute. Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to cdc37 (14Grammatikakis N. Lin J.-H. Grammatikakis A.

Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32315-32320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) have been described previously. Monoclonal antibodies to Hop (F5) and rabbit antisera to FKBP51 and FKBP52 were obtained from Dr. D. Smith (Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, AZ). The JJ3 monoclonal antibody to p23 was obtained from Dr. D. Toft (Mayo Clinic). A monoclonal antibody to hsc70/hsp70 (SPA-820) was from Stressgen. Antibodies directed against hsp90 (AC-16) and the FLAG epitope (M2) were obtained from Sigma. 125I-Labeled cyclic GMP was obtained from Biochemical Technologies. 293 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 μg/ml gentamicin. The previously described FLAG-tagged rat GC-A construct in pSP72 (2Chinkers M. Garbers D.L. Science. 1989; 245: 1392-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) was excised as a SalI/SmaI fragment and subcloned into the SalI/EcoRV sites of pcDNA1/Neo (Invitrogen). The resulting construct, pcDNA1/Neo-FLAG-GC-A, was transfected into the 293 cells using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.), and stable transfectants were selected by growth in the presence of G418 (750 μg/ml). After isolation with cloning cylinders, individual clones were expanded and screened by metabolic labeling with [35S]methionine/cysteine and immunoprecipitation with the M2 antibody, followed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography as described previously (15Chinkers M. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18589-18597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several clones were analyzed further by measuring125I-ANP binding and ANP-stimulated production of cyclic GMP in intact cells, using previously described methods (2Chinkers M. Garbers D.L. Science. 1989; 245: 1392-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 15Chinkers M. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18589-18597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The clone having the highest levels of FLAG-tagged GC-A, as determined by all three methods, was used in these studies after subcloning by limiting dilution. Based on 125I-ANP binding studies, these cells contain ∼50,000 receptors/cell. Cells were maintained as described above for the control 293 cells except that the medium was supplemented with 400 μg/ml G418. Cells in 24-well plates were treated in triplicate for ∼16 h with the indicated concentrations of geldanamycin or with a vehicle (Me2SO). Treatment with 1 μm ANP for 10 min at 27 °C was performed, and radioimmunoassay of cell extracts was then performed as described previously (15Chinkers M. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18589-18597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cultures in 10-cm plates were treated for ∼16 h with the indicated concentrations of geldanamycin or with a vehicle (Me2SO). Cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mmNa2MoO4, 0.09% Nonidet P-40, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin. After the clarification of lysates by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, the immunoprecipitation of FLAG-tagged proteins was performed using either M2 beads (Sigma) or M2 antibody prebound to anti-mouse IgG-agarose beads as described previously (12Chen M.-S. Silverstein A.M. Pratt W.B. Chinkers M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32315-32320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). After washing five times with the lysis buffer, the beads were heated in SDS sample buffer. In one experiment (Fig. 4, lower panel), the immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted from M2 beads using 200 μg/ml FLAG peptide (DYKDDDDK) in phosphate-buffered saline to reduce background staining of the IgG heavy chain. Aliquots of the immunoprecipitates were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies as described previously (12Chen M.-S. Silverstein A.M. Pratt W.B. Chinkers M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32315-32320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells in 10-cm plates were transfected with the indicated plasmids using the Superfect reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The GC-A constructs lacking the kinase-like domain (FLAG-ΔKIN), the guanylate cyclase domain (FLAG-ΔCYC), and the intracellular domain (FLAG-ΔKC) and the construct consisting of the soluble intracellular domain (FLAG-IN) have been described previously (15Chinkers M. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18589-18597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two days after transfection, cells were processed for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting as described above. To test whether hsp90 was involved in the processing of the ANP receptor, GC-A, we treated 293 cells overexpressing FLAG-tagged GC-A with geldanamycin, an inhibitor of hsp90 function. We have previously shown that FLAG-tagged GC-A is functionally indistinguishable from the untagged receptor (15Chinkers M. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18589-18597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were treated overnight with the indicated concentrations of geldanamycin, and GC-A function was assessed by measuring ANP-stimulated cyclic GMP production in intact cells. As shown in Fig. 1, a brief treatment with ANP led to a robust cyclic GMP response. Treatment with geldanamycin led to a concentration-dependent reduction in ANP-stimulated accumulation of cyclic GMP. Approximately 50% reductions in the ANP response were observed in several experiments following treatment with 10 μm geldanamycin. These results suggested that hsp90 is important for GC-A function. Although the inhibition of ANP-stimulated cyclic GMP production by geldanamycin indicated a role for hsp90 in GC-A function, it did not demonstrate a direct role. It would be possible for geldanamycin to inhibit GC-A function indirectly. For example, hsp90 could be required for the processing of another protein that in turn regulated GC-A activity. To test whether GC-A was physically associated with hsp90, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Detergent lysates of the control 293 cells or of 293 cells expressing FLAG-tagged GC-A were subjected to immunoprecipitation with the M2 antibody to the FLAG epitope. Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by Western blotting with different antibodies. In control blots with M2 antibody, the expected GC-A doublet of 130 and 110 kDa was seen in immunoprecipitates from the FLAG-GC-A cell line but not in immunoprecipitates from the control 293 cells (Fig.2). hsp90 was coimmunoprecipitated with the FLAG-tagged GC-A in the absence of geldanamycin, but the complex between GC-A and hsp90 was disrupted following treatment with geldanamycin (Fig. 2). These data indicated that GC-A was present in a geldanamycin-sensitive complex with hsp90. The folding pathway for proteins chaperoned by hsp90 normally begins with an association between newly synthesized proteins and hsp70. When the transfer of these proteins to an hsp90 complex is blocked by geldanamycin, complexes with hsp70 accumulate (6Buchner J. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 136-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). We tested whether this pathway was involved in the folding of GC-A by using the coimmunoprecipitation approach described above. FLAG-tagged GC-A was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with the M2 antibody, and immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting with an antibody to hsp70. As shown in Fig.3, hsp70 was not immunoprecipitated with the M2 antibody from untreated cells or from control cells lacking FLAG-tagged GC-A. After treatment with 10 μmgeldanamycin, however, we observed coimmunoprecipitation of hsp70 with GC-A. The accumulation of hsp70·GC-A complexes in the presence of geldanamycin suggested a folding pathway much like that observed for other proteins in which first hsp70 and then hsp90 act as chaperones. At least 10 different co-chaperones associated with hsp90 complexes have been identified (7Pearl L.H. Prodromou C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 46-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Which co-chaperones are associated with hsp90 is dependent upon which hsp90 client protein is present in the heterocomplex. In the steroid receptor pathway, Hop is thought to recruit hsp90 to complexes between newly synthesized receptors and hsp70. Mature receptors are found in complexes with hsp90 containing one of the large immunophilins (CyP-40, FKBP51, or FKBP52) or PP5 and the acidic protein p23 (5Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1543) Google Scholar). Mature hsp90 complexes with protein kinases, on the other hand, contain p50cdc37 rather than a large immunophilin or PP5 (6Buchner J. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 136-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 7Pearl L.H. Prodromou C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 46-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). We tested which of these co-chaperones was associated with GC-A by using coimmunoprecipitation and Western blotting (Figs. 3 and 4). As shown in Fig. 4, FKBP51, FKBP52, Hop, PP5, and p23 were undetectable in FLAG-GC-A immunoprecipitates in the absence or presence of geldanamycin, although the proteins were readily detected in cell lysates. p50cdc37, however, specifically coimmunoprecipitated with GC-A (Fig. 3). The association between p50cdc37 and GC-A was disrupted following geldanamycin treatment, much like that between hsp90 and GC-A (Fig. 3). In that they contained p50cdc37 and none of the other co-chaperones tested, the hsp90 complexes with GC-A were similar to those associated with protein kinases. GC-A and other membrane guanylate cyclases contain an intracellular protein kinase-like domain that, although it lacks protein kinase activity, contains most of the conserved residues found in authentic protein kinases (1Lucas K.A. Pitari G.M. Kazerounian S. Ruiz-Steward I. Park J. Schulz S. Chepenik K.P. Waldman S.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 375-413PubMed Google Scholar). Because p50cdc37 generally functions as a co-chaperone for protein kinases, we hypothesized that the interaction of p50cdc37 with hsp90 complexes containing GC-A might be mediated by the kinase-like domain. We tested this hypothesis by examining the coimmunoprecipitation of p50cdc37with full-length GC-A and with several GC-A deletion mutants. The FLAG-tagged proteins were expressed in COS-7 cells and immunoprecipitated from detergent lysates with the M2 antibody to the FLAG epitope. Immunoprecipitates were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. As shown in Fig.5 A, p50cdc37coimmunoprecipitated with full-length GC-A, with GC-A lacking its guanylate cyclase catalytic domain, or with the soluble intracellular domain of GC-A. Immunoprecipitates of deletion mutants lacking the kinase-like domain or lacking the entire intracellular domain did not contain p50cdc37 (Fig. 5 A). Thus, the kinase-like domain appears to be required for the binding of GC-A to p50cdc37. The extracellular, transmembrane, and guanylate cyclase domains of GC-A were not required for p50cdc37 binding. The expression of the wild-type GC-A and each of the deletion mutants was confirmed by immunoblotting with M2 (Fig. 5 A). Because of a background band of ∼90 kDa in Western blots in COS cells, we examined the association of hsp90 with the various GC-A mutants by metabolic labeling with [35S]methionine and immunoprecipitation. As for p50cdc37, coimmunoprecipitation of hsp90 with GC-A was dependent on the presence of the protein kinase-like domain (Fig. 5 B). Based on these results, we conclude that the binding of GC-A to both hsp90 and p50cdc37 is mediated by the protein kinase-like domain of GC-A. The function of the protein kinase-like domain found in membrane guanylate cyclases has been elusive since its initial description more than a decade ago (16Singh S. Lowe D.G. Thorpe D.S.

The activation of GC-A by the deletion of this domain suggests that it served an autoinhibitory function, and it has been widely assumed, based on its homology to protein kinases, that this domain contains the allosteric ATP binding site required for the activation of the wild-type GC-A (1Lucas K.A. Pitari G.M. Kazerounian S. Ruiz-Steward I. Park J. Schulz S. Chepenik K.P. Waldman S.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 375-413PubMed Google Scholar). It is still unclear, however, exactly how the protein kinase-like domain regulates receptor activity. More recent evidence has suggested that the protein kinase-like domains of membrane guanylate cyclases may function as anchoring sites for regulatory proteins. The protein kinase-like domain of GC-A interacts with the TPR domain of PP5 in the yeast two-hybrid system (4Chinkers M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11075-11079Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Although we did not detect the coimmunoprecipitation of PP5 and GC-A from detergent lysates, this does not preclude their association in vivo; interactions between the TPR proteins and their targets can be detergent-sensitive. The protein kinase-like domains of the retinal membrane guanylate cyclases have been suggested to be important for the binding of GCAPs, which regulate their guanylate cyclase activity in a Ca2+-dependent manner (17Laura R.P. Hurley J.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11264-11271Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We now report that the protein kinase-like domain of GC-A contains a binding site for p50cdc37·hsp90 complexes. It seems likely that the association between GC-A and hsp90 is mediated by p50cdc37 because this protein has been shown to bind directly to protein kinases (14Grammatikakis N. Lin J.-H. Grammatikakis A. Tsichlis P.N. Cochran B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1661-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). We propose that p50cdc37 binds to GC-A because the structure of the kinase-like domain of GC-A is similar to that of authentic protein kinases. The coimmunoprecipitation data presented here are consistent with most models for the folding of client proteins by hsp70, hsp90, and their co-chaperones. Similar to other proteins, GC-A appears to form complexes with hsp70 and then, in a geldanamycin-sensitive manner, to form a complex with hsp90. As has been shown for other hsp90 client proteins, the disruption of this complex by geldanamycin treatment leads to a disruption of GC-A function. We were initially surprised that we did not detect p23, Hop, or large immunophilins in the GC-A·hsp90 complexes and that the only hsp90 co-chaperone we detected was p50cdc37. Because p50cdc37 is thought to be a kinase-specific hsp90 co-chaperone, its association with a membrane guanylate cyclase receptor was unexpected. This association, however, was explained by mapping experiments localizing the site of p50cdc37 and hsp90 binding to the kinase-like domain of GC-A. Although the literature tends to draw a clear line between protein kinases forming complexes with hsp90 and p50cdc37 and other proteins forming complexes with hsp90 and other co-chaperones, the reality is probably more complex. A recent report describes the association of two different protein kinases with hsp90 complexes containing not only p50cdc37 but also the large immunophilin FKBP52 (18Hartson S.D. Irwin A.D. Shao J. Scroggins B.T. Volk L. Huang W. Matts R.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7631-7644Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The precise pathway leading to the final kinase·p50cdc37·hsp90 complex is not fully understood. Our data do not establish that these other co-chaperones are not involved in the processing of GC-A; we can only conclude that under the conditions described here, we do not detect these proteins in GC-A immunoprecipitates. Although the processing of proteins via the hsp90 pathway has been best studied using steroid receptors and protein kinases, in recent years it has become clear that a variety of other hsp90 client proteins exists. These include telomerase (19Holt S.E. Aisner D.L. Baur J. Tesmer V.M. Dy M. Ouellette M. Trager J.B. Morin G.B. Toft D.O. Shay J.W. Wright W.E. White M.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar), nitric-oxide synthase (20Garcia-Cardena G. Fan R. Shah V. Sorrentino R. Cirino G. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1998; 392: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar), G protein subunits (21Busconi L. Guan J. Denker B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1565-1569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (22Loo M.A. Jensen T.J. Cui L. Hou Y. Chang X.-B. Riordan J.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6879-6887Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), and now GC-A. To our knowledge, GC-A is the first protein that is not a protein kinase that is associated with p50cdc37 in the hsp90 folding pathway. The role of hsp90 and p50cdc37 in GC-A processing and the biochemical mechanisms by which these proteins affect GC-A activity remain to be determined. It is not clear whether they are involved in the subcellular trafficking of GC-A, in maintaining GC-A in a hormone-activable conformation, as previously shown for steroid receptors, or in some other function. In the case of one Src family protein kinase, it has been shown that hsp90 is required for the folding of the protein kinase domain but not for the folding of the SH2 domain (23Hartson S.D. Ottinger E.A. Huang W. Barany G. Burn P. Matts R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8475-8482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It is possible that the same is true of GC-A, i.e. that hsp90 may be required only for the folding of the kinase-like domain. We believe that hsp90 and p50cdc37will be found to play a general role in processing membrane guanylate cyclases. A genetic connection between hsp90 and an olfactory guanylate cyclase in Caenorhabditis elegans was described recently (24Birnby D.A. Link E.M. Vowels J.J. Tian H. Colacurcio P.L. Thomas J.H. Genetics. 2000; 155: 85-104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It will be interesting to determine whether hsp90 and p50cdc37 are associated with other mammalian membrane guanylate cyclases and to see whether mutations in p50cdc37 in other model organisms (25Cutforth T. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1994; 77: 1027-1036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) affect guanylate cyclase function. We thank Drs.

https://openalex.org/W2071247635,"The activity of the retinoblastoma protein pRB is regulated by phosphorylation that is mediated by G1cyclin-associated cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). Since the pRB-related pocket proteins p107 and p130 share general structures and biological functions with pRB, their activity is also considered to be regulated by phosphorylation. In this work, we generated phosphorylation-resistant p107 and p130 molecules by replacing potential cyclin-CDK phosphorylation sites with non-phosphorylatable alanine residues. These phosphorylation-resistant mutants retained the ability to bind E2F and cyclin. Upon introduction into p16INK4a-deficient U2-OS osteosarcoma cells, in which cyclin D-CDK4/6 is dysregulated, the phosphorylation-resistant mutants, but not wild-type p107 or p130, were capable of inhibiting cell proliferation. Furthermore, when ectopically expressed in pRB-deficient SAOS-2 osteosarcoma cells, the wild-type as well as the phosphorylation-resistant pRB family proteins were capable of inducing large flat cells. The flat cell-inducing activity of the wild-type proteins, but not that of the phosphorylation-resistant mutants, was abolished by coexpressing cyclin E. Our results indicate that the elevated cyclin D- or cyclin E-associated kinase leads to systemic inactivation of the pRB family proteins and suggest that dysregulation of the pRB kinase provokes an aberrant cell cycle in a broader range of cell types than those induced by genetic inactivation of theRB gene.

It inhibits cell proliferation when ectopically expressed and is thought to play an important role in the growth decision-making in the late G1 phase of the cell cycle (1Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4986) Google Scholar, 2Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4326) Google Scholar). pRB is considered to inhibit cell proliferation by physically interacting with cellular proteins, most notably with the E2F family of transcription factors (3Chellappan S.P.

Upon complex formation with E2F, pRB inhibits transcriptional activation of those E2F-dependent genes whose products are essentially required for G1-to-S phase cell cycle transition. Furthermore, the pRB-E2F complex is capable of acting as a repressor against promoters containing E2F-binding sites, thereby actively repressing transcription in an E2F-dependent manner (4Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1981) Google Scholar, 5Nevins J.R. Science. 1992; 258: 424-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar, 6Weintraub S.J. Chow K.N. Luo R.X.

Sequential phosphorylation of pRB during G1by cyclin D-associated cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)1-4/6 and cyclin E-CDK2 abolishes the ability of pRB to form physical complexes with cellular proteins, including E2F, and leads to G1-to-S phase cell cycle progression and subsequent cell division. The “p16INK4a-pRB” pathway is perturbed in most, if not all, cancer cells (7Delmer A. Tang R. Senamaud-Beaufort C. Paterlini P. Brechot C. Zittoun R. Leukemia ( Baltimore ). 1995; 9: 1240-1245PubMed Google Scholar, 8Ruas M. Brookes S. McDonald N.Q. Peters G. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5423-5434Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 9Ruas M.

Nature. 1993; 366: 704-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (3392) Google Scholar). The changes include mutational inactivation of p16INK4a, cyclin D overexpression, and production of CDK4 mutants that cannot interact with p16INK4a. All of these changes lead to biochemical inactivation of pRB through phosphorylation, indicating that pRB plays a central role in preventing cellular transformation. On the other hand, genetic inactivation of a single copy of the RB gene predisposes only a limited set of malignancies such as retinoblastoma and osteosarcoma. This raises an intriguing possibility that dysregulation of the p16INK4a-pRB pathway gives rise to transformation in a broader range of cell types than those induced by RB gene inactivation. There are two proteins, p107 and p130, that share the so-called “pocket domain” with pRB (13Ewen M.E. Xing Y.G. Lawrence J.B. Livingston D.M.

Among the members of the pRB pocket protein family, p107 and p130 are more homologous to each other than to pRB and share unique properties allowing interaction with cyclins and CDKs (14Hannon G.J.

In addition, p107 and p130 selectively bind E2F-4 and E2F-5, whereas pRB preferentially binds E2F-1, E2F-2, and E2F-3 (25Beijersbergen R.L. Kerkhoven R.M. Zhu L. Carlee L. Voorhoeve P.M. Bernards R.

Hence, each member of the pRB family is likely to perform shared as well as unique cell cycle regulatory roles in a single cell. Furthermore, we (33Hoshikawa Y. Mori A. Amimoto K. Iwabe K.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5239-5245Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) have recently shown that a different member of the pRB pocket protein family may become a key regulator of the cell cycle in different cell types. p107 and p130 are phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Like pRB, p107 can be a substrate for cyclin D-CDK4, and p107-induced cell cycle arrest was reportedly released by cyclin D-CDK4, but not by cyclin E-CDK2 (19Zhu L. Heuvel S.V.D. Helin K. Fattaey A.

A. 1996; 93: 4633-4637Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In the case of p130, however, both D-type cyclins and cyclin E are capable of reversing the growth suppression mediated by p130. These observations raise the idea that the function of the entire pRB family of proteins is collectively regulated by phosphorylation, most likely through G1cyclin-CDK. Although this idea has long been suspected, there is little published information as to the functional regulation of p107 and p130 by phosphorylation. In this work, we generated p107 and p130 mutants that are resistant to cyclin-CDK-mediated phosphorylation. By expressing these phosphorylation-resistant molecules, we demonstrate that the growth-inhibitory activity as well as the cell differentiation/senescence-promoting activity of pRB, p107, and p130 are inactivated by phosphorylation. Our results indicate that elevation of the levels of pRB kinases through either p16INK4a loss or cyclin E overexpression abolishes the total activities of the pRB family proteins and, as a result, predisposes a broad spectrum of cells to a dysregulated cell cycle. The human osteosarcoma line SAOS-2 was provided by Dr. Phil Hinds (Harvard Medical School, Boston). The human osteosarcoma line U2-OS was obtained from American Type Culture Collection. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% (for U2-OS) or 15% (for SAOS-2) fetal bovine serum. The phosphorylation-resistant pRB mutant, pRBΔS/T-P, was described previously (33Hoshikawa Y. Mori A. Amimoto K. Iwabe K. Hatakeyama M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Some of the constructs were tagged with a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope at either the amino or carboxyl terminus. cDNAs encoding the wild-type and mutant pRB family proteins were inserted into mammalian expression vector pSP65-SRα (41Takebe Y.

The pRc/CMV vector was used to express human cyclin E cDNA, and the pSV vector for adenovirus E1A (12 S and E1A-928 mutant). Either 20 μg of the indicated pocket protein expression plasmids or 10 μg of the pocket protein expression plasmids and 10 μg of E1A (either 12 S or E1A-928 mutant) expression plasmids were transfected into 1 × 106 U2-OS cells in a 100-mm plate by the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described previously (42Hinds P.W. Mittnacht S. Dulic V. Arnold A. Reed S.I. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1992; 70: 993-1006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). After 2 days of culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, the transfected cells were harvested and lysed in E1A lysis buffer (42Hinds P.W. Mittnacht S. Dulic V.

Cell lysates were first treated with anti-HA monoclonal antibody (12CA5) for 1 h, and the immune complexes were collected on protein A-Sepharose beads. After washing the beads, immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride filters (Millipore Corp.), and immunoblotted with appropriate antibodies. Proteins were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (ECL, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The antibodies used were anti-cyclin A (H-432, sc-75, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-E2F-4 (C-108, sc-512, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-adenovirus E1A (14161A, Pharmingen). 20 μg of the expression plasmid was transfected into U2-OS cells together with 2 μg of the puromycin resistance gene (pBabe-puro) (43Morgenstern L.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1903) Google Scholar) by the calcium phosphate precipitation method. At 16 h after the transfection, the cells were split into four 100-mm plates. The transfected cells were then selected in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum in the presence of 2 μg/ml puromycin for 2 weeks. During the selection, the medium was changed twice a week. After the drug selection, the cells were stained by the May-Giemsa method, and the number of puromycin-resistant colonies was counted. The expression plasmid (20 μg) was transfected together with 2 μg of pBabe-puro into SAOS-2 cells by the calcium phosphate precipitation method. At 16 h after the transfection, the cells were split into four 100-mm plates, and the transfected cells were selected in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 15% fetal bovine serum in the presence of 0.5 μg/ml puromycin for 2 weeks. After the drug selection, the cells were stained with May-Giemsa solution and crystal violet. For cyclin E coexpression, 10 μg of the pRB family expression plasmid and 2 μg of pBabe-puro were transfected together with 10 μg of pCMV or pCMV-cyclin E. U2-OS cells were transfected with 20 μg of the pRB family expression plasmid together with 2 μg of the CD20 expression plasmid (pCMV-CD20) (40Zhu L. Enders G. Lees J.A. Beijersbergen R.L. Bernards R.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1904-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) as a marker. 40 h after the transfection, cells were harvested and treated with an anti-CD20 antibody (fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled CD20, Becton Dickinson) for 20 min on ice, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and fixed in 70% ethanol on ice. The cells were washed again and resuspended in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 25 μg/ml RNase A for 20 min. Prior to flow cytometry, 700 μl of propidium iodide solution (100 μg/ml propidium iodide and 0.1% sodium citrate) was added to the cell suspension, and cells were incubated for another 15 min on ice. The intensity of propidium iodide staining was measured by a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson) on cell populations that were positive for CD20 expression to determine the DNA content. Cell cycle profiles of the CD20-positive cells were analyzed using CELL Quest and ModFit cell cycle analysis software (Becton Dickinson). To address the role of cyclin-associated CDK-dependent phosphorylation in the function of p107 and p130, we generated phosphorylation-resistant mutants as described previously in a study on the function of pRB (33Hoshikawa Y. Mori A. Amimoto K. Iwabe K. Hatakeyama M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8574-8579Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Human p107 possesses 18 Ser-Pro or Thr-Pro ((Ser/Thr)-Pro) motifs that are potential phosphorylation targets for cyclin-CDK. The serine and threonine residues making up all of the (Ser/Thr)-Pro motifs were replaced by alanine to generate p107ΔS/T-P. Similarly, all of the 27 (Ser/Thr)-Pro motifs in human p130 were mutated to generate p130ΔS/T-P. In the case of p130, p130ΔCDK was also made by mutating 12 serine/threonine residues constituting the canonical CDK consensus motif ((S/T)PX(L/R)) to alanine residues. All of the pocket protein mutants used in this work are summarized in Fig. 1. Since the phosphorylation-resistant mutants possess multiple point mutations, we first investigated whether or not these proteins retain sufficient structural integrity to interact with cyclins and E2F proteins in the manner of their respective wild-type proteins. To do so, cDNA encoding the wild-type or the phosphorylation-resistant mutant protein was transfected into U2-OS cells. As demonstrated in Fig. 2(A, upper panel, lanes 2,4, and 6; and C, upper panel, lanes 2, 4, 6,10, 12, and 14), the wild-type pocket proteins were detected as broad bands, indicating that they were variably phosphorylated. In contrast, the phosphorylation-resistant mutants were all detected as fast migrating bands (Fig. 2,A, upper panel, lanes 3, 5,7, and 8; and C, upper panel, lanes 3, 5, 7,8, 11, 13, 15, and16), indicating that they were resistant to phosphorylation in cells. In sequential immunoprecipitation-immunoblotting analyses, endogenous E2F-4 proteins were co-immunoprecipitated with all wild-type and mutant pocket proteins, with the exception of p130ΔS/T-P (Fig. 2,A, middle panel; and B). In each case, E2F-4 molecules coprecipitated with the mutant pocket proteins were detected in amounts similar to those coprecipitated with their respective wild-type counterparts, although the expression levels of the mutant proteins were significantly less than those of the wild-type proteins. This indicates at least that the affinities of the mutant pocket proteins for binding E2F-4 are not reduced despite introduction of multiple mutations. Notably, the E2F-4-binding affinity of pRB or pRBΔS/T-P was significantly less than that of p107 or p107ΔS/T-P (Fig. 2, A and B) as reported previously (18Grana X. Garriga J. Mayol X. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3365-3383Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 44Ginsberg D. Vairo G. Chittenden T. Xiao Z. Xu G. Wydner K.L. DeCaprio K.L. Lawrence J.B. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2665-2679Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Furthermore, wild-type p107, wild-type p130, p107ΔS/T-P, and p130ΔCDK, but not p130ΔS/T-P, physically interacted with endogenous cyclin A (Fig. 2 A, lower panel). Again, in each case, coprecipitated cyclin A levels were found to be similar to the levels coprecipitated with their respective wild-type counterparts. In contrast, wild-type pRB and pRBΔS/T-P did not associate with cyclin A because they do not possess cyclin A-binding spacer sequences. These observations indicate that p107ΔS/T-P, p130ΔCDK, and pRBΔS/T-P are capable of interacting with cellular targets with affinities comparable to those of their respective wild-type molecules. Conformation of the phosphorylation-resistant mutant as the “pocket protein” was further examined with the use of the adenovirus E1A 12 S product, which specifically binds the pocket domains and inactivates the pRB family proteins (45Mayol X. Garriga J. Grana X. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 237-246PubMed Google Scholar, 46Whyte P. Williamson N.M. Harlow E. Cell. 1989; 56: 67-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 47Hu Q. Dyson N. Harlow E. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1147-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Upon transient coexpression in U2-OS cells, the mutant pRB family molecules, except p130ΔS/T-P, formed stable complexes with E1A to levels comparable to those associated with their respective wild-type counterparts (Fig. 2 C). Moreover, an E1A point mutant, E1A-928, which does not bind to wild-type pRB, did not bind pRBΔS/T-P as well (Fig. 2 C, middle panel, lanes 10 and 11). The E1A mutant is also known to bind p107 and p130 less effectively. Consistently, p107ΔS/T-P and p130ΔCDK exhibited reduced affinities for E1A-928, as is the case with wild-type p107 and p130 (Fig. 2 C,middle panel, compare lanes 4–7 with lanes 12–15) (48Moran E. Zerler B. Harrison T.M. Mathews M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3470-3480Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 49Wang H.H. Rikitake Y. Carter M.C. Yaciuk P. Abraham S.E. Zerler B. Moran E. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 476-488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 50Parreno M. Garriga J. Limon A. Mayol X. Beck Jr., G.R. Moran E. Grana X. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3166-3176Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). These observations provide further evidence that the structural conformations of the phosphorylation-resistant pocket protein mutants pRBΔS/T-P, p107ΔS/T-P, and p130ΔCDK are indistinguishable from those of their respective wild-type molecules, pointing to the notion that these mutants function through normal biological pathways that involve their wild-type counterparts when expressed in cells. On the other hand, p130ΔS/T-P, which has 27 point mutations, lost its structural integrity as a pocket protein because of the introduced mutations. It has been shown that U2-OS cells are highly resistant to pRB overexpression (19Zhu L. Heuvel S.V.D. Helin K. Fattaey A. Ewen M. Livingston D. Dyson N. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1111-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Since the U2-OS cells do not express functional p16INK4a (51Suzuki T.I. Higashi H. Yoshida E. Nishimura S. Kitagawa M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 386-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), a specific inhibitor of cyclin D-CDK4/6, the cells exhibit dysregulated pRB kinase activity (52Hofmann F. Martelli F. Livingston D.M. Wang Z. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2949-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). It is therefore considered that, in U2-OS cells, the dysregulated pRB kinase instantly inactivates ectopically expressed wild-type pRB proteins. If this is the case, then the growth of U2-OS cells must be inhibited by phosphorylation-resistant pRB. To address this, a cDNA expression vector for wild-type pRB or the phosphorylation-resistant pRB mutant, pRBΔS/T-P, was cotransfected with the CD20 expression vector, and the cell cycle distribution of the CD20-positive cells at 40 h after the transfection was examined with the use of a flow cytometer. As previously reported (19Zhu L. Heuvel S.V.D. Helin K. Fattaey A. Ewen M. Livingston D. Dyson N. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1111-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), ectopic expression of pRB had very little effect on the cell cycle distribution profile of U2-OS cells (Fig. 3). On the other hand, pRBΔS/T-P caused severe G1 cell cycle arrest in U2-OS cells (Fig. 3). This indicates that, in these cells, the growth-suppressive activity of pRB is neutralized by phosphorylation, most likely through the dysregulated cyclin D-CDK kinase because of the lack of p16INK4a. The U2-OS cells allowed us to examine whether the growth-suppressive activity of p107 or p130 is also under the control of cyclin-CDK-mediated phosphorylation. To this end, we transiently introduced wild-type p107 or p107ΔS/T-P together with CD20 into U2-OS cells (Fig. 3). Whereas the expression of wild-type p107 did not affect the cell cycle distribution significantly, phosphorylation-resistant p107 provoked strong accumulation of cells in G1 phase, indicating that the mutant molecules caused G1 cell cycle arrest in U2-OS cells. This indicates that p107 is capable of inhibiting cell cycle progression and that the activity is under phosphorylation control in U2-OS cells (Fig. 3). The wild-type and two forms of phosphorylation-resistant p130 molecules, p130ΔS/T-P and p130ΔCDK, were next examined for their growth regulatory activity in U2-OS cells. In contrast to pRB and p107, p130, even in its phosphorylation-resistant forms, did not significantly affect the cell cycle profile of U2-OS cells in this transient expression assay (Fig. 3). Given the observation that p130ΔS/T-P cannot bind E2F or cyclin A (Fig. 2), this finding is consistent with the conclusion that the mutant is functionally inactive. In contrast, since p130ΔCDK can still bind with the target molecules, the growth-inhibitory activity of p130, if it exists, may be significantly weaker than that of pRB or p107 in U2-OS cells. We next investigated the long-term effects of the pRB family proteins on the growth of U2-OS cells. To do so, we transfected cDNA expression vectors for the pRB family proteins together with the puromycin resistance gene. After selection of the transfected cells with puromycin, the number of puromycin-resistant colonies was counted. As shown in Fig. 4, expression of wild-type pocket proteins in U2-OS cells resulted in a weak reduction of puromycin-resistant colonies, indicating that these proteins are growth-inhibitory. As expected from the transient assay, the phosphorylation-resistant pRB and p107 molecules reduced puromycin-resistant colonies quite strongly (Fig. 4). Furthermore, in this colony formation assay, the phosphorylation-resistant p130 mutant p130ΔCDK suppressed U2-OS colony formation more effectively than wild-type p130. This indicates that p130 is also capable of inhibiting cell proliferation and that this growth-inhibitory activity is under phosphorylation control. In contrast, p130ΔS/T-P, which lacks all 27 (Ser/Thr)-Pro motifs, was not growth-suppressive in the colony assay (Fig. 4). Accordingly, as suggested from its inability to bind E2F-4 or cyclin A, the introduction of mutations into one or several (Ser/Thr)-Pro sites present in p130ΔCDK but absent in p130ΔS/T-P appears to provoke structural inactivation of p130. Alternatively, since p130 receives multiple phosphorylation and its function is reportedly modified depending on phosphorylation status (53Mayol X. Garriga J. Grana X. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 801-808PubMed Google Scholar), a certain degree of basal phosphorylation might be required for the activation of p130 as a growth suppressor. If this is the case, then p130ΔS/T-P may be functionally inactive because it cannot receive activating phosphorylation by the proline-directed kinases that target the (Ser/Thr)-Pro motifs. In any case, the failure of p130ΔS/T-P to inhibit cell growth argues against the idea that cell cycle-inhibitory effects of the phosphorylation-resistant mutants are due to the overexpression and accumulation of functionally inactive pocket proteins. Expression of pRB in pRB-defective SAOS-2 human osteosarcoma cells causes strong G1 cell cycle arrest that is associated with a large flat cell formation (42Hinds P.W. Mittnacht S. Dulic V. Arnold A.

This enzyme, named polysomal ribonuclease 1, or PMR-1, is a novel member of the peroxidase gene family. A characteristic feature of PMR-1 is its ability to generate in vitro degradation intermediates by cleaving within overlapping APyrUGA elements in the 5′-coding region of albumin mRNA. The current study sought to determine whether the in vivo destabilization of albumin mRNA following estrogen administration involves the generation of decay intermediates that could be identified as products of PMR-1 cleavage. A sensitive ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction technique was developed to identify labile decay intermediates, and its validity in identifying PMR-1-generated decay intermediates of albumin mRNA was confirmed by primer extension experiments performed with liver RNA that was isolated from estrogen-treated frogs or digestedin vitro with the purified endonuclease. Ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction was also used to identify decay intermediates from the 3′-end of albumin mRNA, and as a final proof of principle it was employed to identify in vivo decay intermediates of the c-myc coding region instability determinant corresponding to sites of in vitro cleavage by a polysome-associated endonuclease.

The process of mRNA decay is closely linked to translation (1Jacobson A. Peltz S.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem... 1996; 65: 693-739Google Scholar), and a growing body of data links the binding of proteins to the mRNA 3′-end with the efficiency of cap-dependent translation initiation (2Gingras A.C.

EMBO J... 1998; 17: 7480-7489Google Scholar). mRNA decay in vertebrates can be generally divided into four basic pathways: deadenylation with the possible link to decapping and 5′-3′ degradation of the mRNA body, deadenylation followed by 3′-5′ decay of the mRNA body, nonsense-mediated decay, which may or may not involve decapping, and endonuclease-mediated decay (4Ross J.

Morris D.R. mRNA Metabolism and Post-transcriptional Gene Regulation.Wiley, New York. 1997; : 181-200Google Scholar). All of these effectively serve to disrupt the link between the 5′- and 3′-ends of the mRNA. It has yet to be proven whether the general pathway of mRNA decay in vertebrates will recapitulate processes that have been characterized in yeast, but there is suggestive evidence to support this. A significant number of mRNAs are also degraded through endonuclease-mediated pathways (5Schoenberg D.R. Chernokalskaya E. Harford J. Morris D.R. mRNA Metabolism and Post-transcriptional Gene Regulation.Wiley, New York. 1997; : 217-240Google Scholar). Examples include mRNAs for apo-very low density lipoprotein II (7Binder R.

Kiledjian M. EMBO J... 2000; 19: 295-305Google Scholar). Estrogen induces a global change in the profile of proteins expressed in Xenopus liver resulting from the coordinate destabilization of the serum protein mRNAs (12Pastori R.L. Moskaitis J.E. Buzek S.W. Schoenberg D.R. Mol.

Biochemistry.. 1991; 30: 10490-10498Google Scholar), a novel endonuclease related to the peroxidase gene family (15Chernokalskaya E. DuBell A.N. Cunningham K.S. Hanson M.N. Dompenciel R.E. Schoenberg D.R. RNA ( N. Y. ).. 1998; 4: 1537-1548Google Scholar). PMR-1 is a component of a large mRNP complex bearing its substrate mRNAs, and mRNA decay is initiated by a 22-fold increase in the unit activity of the polysome-bound enzyme following estrogen stimulation. 2Cunningham, K. S., Hanson, M. N., and Schoenberg, D. R. (2001) Nucleic Acids Res. 29,1156–1162.2Cunningham, K. S., Hanson, M. N., and Schoenberg, D. R. (2001) Nucleic Acids Res. 29,1156–1162. This global change in mRNA decay occurs in the absence of major changes in the amount of cellular PMR-1. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether this increase in unit activity is matched by the appearance of albumin mRNA decay intermediates characteristic of endonuclease cleavage by PMR-1. With the exception of insulin-like growth factor II mRNA, whose unique structure results in a remarkably stable in vivoendonuclease degradation product (10van Dijk E.L. Sussenbach J.S. Holthuizen P.E. RNA ( N. Y. ).. 1998; 4: 1632-1635Google Scholar, 16van Dijk E.L. Sussenbach J.S. Holthuizen P.E. J. Mol. Biol... 2000; 300: 449-467Google Scholar), most mRNAs are degraded without significant accumulation of decay intermediates. However, decay intermediates have been observed using crude in vitro decay systems. The most likely explanation for this is that in vivo these intermediates are subject to rapid exonucleolytic clearance in a manner similar to that which occurs in prokaryotes, where polynucleotide phosphorylase or RNase II rapidly degrade intermediates generated by RNase E (5Schoenberg D.R. Chernokalskaya E. Harford J. Morris D.R. mRNA Metabolism and Post-transcriptional Gene Regulation.Wiley, New York. 1997; : 217-240Google Scholar). For mRNAs that do not show obvious degradation intermediates only a few, highly abundant mRNAs have been examined, in general using primer extension or S1 nuclease protection assays (17Schoenberg D.R. Cunningham K.S. Methods.. 1999; 17: 60-73Google Scholar). Although these techniques do work, they require long exposure times to visualize metastable products and are not readily applicable to low copy mRNAs. We describe here a new approach using ligation-mediated (LM) RT-PCR to identify the 3′-ends of degradation intermediates generated in vivo as a result of either endonuclease cleavage or pausing of a 3′- to 5′-exonuclease. The rationale behind this was our finding that PMR-1 generates degradation intermediates with 3′-hydroxyls, which are good substrates for further degradation by 3′- to 5′-exonucleases, whereas decay intermediates with 3′-phosphate termini are poor substrates for such enzymes. Using this assay we show that the estrogen-induced increase in unit activity of polysome-bound PMR-1 is accompanied by the appearance of albumin mRNA degradation intermediates corresponding to those generated by in vitrocleavage with the purified endonuclease. As a proof of principle this approach was used to demonstrate in vivo cleavage of c-myc mRNA in the coding region determinant that has been identified from in vitro studies as a potential regulatory element by Ross and coworkers (8Lee C.H. Leeds P. Ross J. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 25261-25271Google Scholar, 18Doyle G.A.R. Betz N.A. Leeds P.F. Fleisig A.J. Prokipcak R.D. Ross J.

Male Xenopus were obtained from Xenopus One (Ann Arbor, MI), fed a synthetic diet, and maintained in plastic aquaria with a 12-h light-dark cycle. One milligram of estradiol-17β was injected in 0.1 ml of a solution of 10% Me2SO/90% propylene glycol into the dorsal lymph sac. Animals were anesthetized with 0.1% tricaine methanesulfonate prior to removing the liver. Livers were removed and perfused with ice-cold 1× SSC to remove as much blood as possible. They were chopped into 1-mm cubes followed by the addition of 10 ml/g of tissue of 5 m guanidine isothiocyanate, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and the mixture was homogenized at 4 °C for 2 min at 4000 rpm using a Teflon glass homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove any insoluble material. One-tenth volume of 20% (w/v) N-lauroylsarcosine was added, and the mixture was heated at 65 °C for 2 min to denature protein. 0.1 g of CsCl/ml liver extract was added, and the extract was layered over 9 ml of 5.7m CsCl in a siliconized polyallomer tube and centrifuged overnight at 113,000 × g at 22 °C in a Sorvall TH-641 swinging-bucket rotor. The supernatant was carefully removed, and the RNA pellet was dissolved in 3 ml of 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% (w/v) N-lauroylsarcosine, 5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol at 4 °C for 24 h. RNA was extracted once with one volume of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and once with one volume of chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1). Sodium acetate, pH 5.2, was added to 0.3 m and RNA was precipitated by addition of 2.5 volumes of ice-cold ethanol. The recovered RNA pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and dissolved in DEPC-treated water prior to use. Murine erythroleukemia cells (MEL cells) were obtained from Dr. Lynne Maquat. They were cultured in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Total cellular RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the manufacturer's protocol. Between 2 and 10 μg of total RNA was added to a 15-μl reaction containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm ATP, 2 mm DTT, 10 μg/ml BSA, 1 mm hexamine cobalt chloride, 25% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 30 units of placental ribonuclease inhibitor, and 2 μg of ligation primer MH11NH3P. The ligation primer MH11NH3P (P-CCAGGTGGATAGTGCTCAATCTCTAGATCG-NH3) was prepared by Operon and has 5′-phosphate and 3′-amino termini. Ligations were performed at 4 °C for 16 h with 15 units of T4 RNA ligase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The reaction mixture was extracted once with one volume of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and once with one volume of chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1). The aqueous layer was adjusted to 0.3 m sodium acetate, pH 5.5, and RNA with the ligated primer was precipitated by addition of 2.5 volumes of ice-cold ethanol. The entire mixture of RNA ligated to the MH11NH3P primer was resuspended in 11 μl of DEPC-treated water, followed by addition of 250 ng of the primer MH12 (5′-CGAGCTAGAGATTGAGCAC), which is complementary to the first 19 nt of MH11NH3P. The solution was heated to 100 °C for 3 min and quickly cooled on ice. To this was added 4 μl of 5× buffer (250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 375 mm KCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT), 0.5 mm dNTPs, and H2O to a total volume of 20 μl. The mixture was heated at 42 °C for 2 min followed by the addition of 200 units of Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and incubated for an additional 50 min. The reaction was terminated by heating at 70 °C for 15 min. Three μl of the above reaction mixture was mixed with 2.5 μl of 10× buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.9, 1 m KCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 500 μg/ml BSA, 0.5% Tween 20 (v/v)). To this was added MgCl2 and dNTPs to a final concentration each of 3 mm. The wax bead of the Hot Start tube (Life Technologies, Inc.) was melted by heating the tube to 75 °C for about 30 s, and the mixture was cooled quickly on ice. 11 μl of DEPC water, 2 μl of 5′-32P-labeled gene-specific primer, and 0.5 μl of tTh polymerase from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Indianapolis, IN) were then added to a final volume of 25 μl. The mixture was heated at 95 °C for 2 min, and PCR amplification was performed for 25 cycles at 95 °C for 2 min, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min, followed by extension for 3 min at 72 °C using primers synthesized by Operon Technologies (Alameda, CA). The gene-specific primers used were, Set A1 (5′-CGCGGTACCTGGATCACCCTGATTTGTC, beginning at position 40 of albumin mRNA), Set G1 (5′-TCCTTGTGAAGCTGATTA, beginning at position 1690 of albumin mRNA), and MH28 (5′-AAGAGGCGAACACACAACG, beginning at position 1669 of c-myc mRNA). The reaction mixtures were then extracted as above with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol, and amplified products were recovered by ethanol precipitation. The recovered pellet was dissolved in 3 μl of DEPC H2O, and an equal volume of formamide loading dye (80% formamide, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 0.1% xylene cyanol). This was heated for 5 min at 95 °C and loaded into a single lane of a denaturing 6% polyacrylamide/urea gel. Products from the above reaction were identified by autoradiography of the dried polyacrylamide gel. The bands of interest were extracted from the dried gel following a modified protocol from Jo et. al. (19Jo H. Zhang H. Zhang R. Liang P. Methods.. 1998; 16: 365-372Google Scholar). The film was aligned with the gel, and an 18-gauge needle was used to punch holes at the four corners of each band. A fresh razor blade was then used to cut out each desired band, and the excised gel fragments were soaked in 200 μl of distilled H2O for 10 min. The tube was then boiled for 15 min with Parafilm to hold the lid closed. This was then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 2 min, and the supernatant was removed. DNA was recovered by addition of one-tenth volume of 3 m sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 50 μg of glycogen, and 900 μl of 100% ethanol, followed by chilling at −80 °C for 30 min. The DNA pellet was recovered by centrifugation at 14,000 × g, 4 °C for 15 min, washed with cold 85% ethanol, and dissolved in 12 μl of distilled H2O. Four microliters of the extracted DNA was added to a 40-μl reaction containing 4 μl of a 10× buffer consisting of 100 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.9, 1 m KCl, 15 mmMgCl2, 500 μg/ml BSA, 0.5% Tween 20 (v/v). The reaction mixture was adjusted to 1.5 mm MgCl2, followed by the addition of 0.4 mm dNTPs, 1 ng of primer MH12, 1 ng of the gene-specific primer, and 2.5 units of tTh polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Inc.). PCR amplification was performed as described above, following which 8 μl was treated with 10 units of exonuclease I and 2 units of shrimp alkaline phosphatase for 20 min at 37 °C to remove unincorporated primers. This reaction was terminated by heating for 15 min at 80 °C, followed by addition of 20 ng of the original gene-specific primer. This was annealed to the template, by heating at 100 °C for 3 min and then cooling on ice for 5 min, and sequenced using T7 DNA polymerase (USB T7 Sequenase Kit). The products were denatured and electrophoresed on a 6% polyacrylamide/urea gel as described above. A 5′-32P-labeled transcript corresponding to region G in Fig.2 (spanning 1690–2002 of albumin mRNA) was prepared as described previously (17Schoenberg D.R. Cunningham K.S. Methods.. 1999; 17: 60-73Google Scholar). This was incubated with 10 μg of polysome extract from estrogen-treated frogs (Fig. 5 A) or 20 units of PMR-1 purified as described previously (20Dompenciel R.E. Garnepudi V.R. Schoenberg D.R. J.

One unit of PMR-1 is the amount needed to completely cleave 7 fmol of albumin substrate transcript in 30 min at 23 °C. The reactions were stopped by adding one volume of stop solution (98% formamide (v/v), 0.1% (v/v) bromphenol blue, and 0.1% xylene cyanole) and heating at 95 °C for 3 min. The samples were then electrophoresed on a 6% polyacrylamide-urea gel, and cleavage products were visualized by autoradiography.Figure 5LM-PCR identification of decay intermediates in the 3′-end of albumin mRNA.

This was heated for 5 min at 50 °C and cooled slowly to room temperature. To this was added 150 μl of RNase digestion buffer III containing 5 units of RNase T1. Samples were incubated for 5–25 min at 37 °C, and the reaction was stopped by addition of 225 μl of RNase inactivation/precipitation III solution. Digested RNA was recovered by addition of 150 μl of ethanol, and 10 μg of yeast tRNA, followed by precipitation at −20 °C. The pellet was dissolved in 6 μl of gel loading buffer II, and products were separated on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide/urea gel and visualized by autoradiography. The positions of single-stranded G residues identified by RNase T1 digestion were used to model the secondary structure of this portion of albumin mRNA using the MFOLD server (22Mathews D.H. Sabina J. Zuker M. Turner D.H. J. Mol. Biol... 1999; 288: 911-940Google Scholar). Primer extension analysis of albumin mRNA was performed as described previously (17Schoenberg D.R. Cunningham K.S. Methods.. 1999; 17: 60-73Google Scholar). 10-μg samples of total liver RNA isolated 12 h after injection of estradiol were either kept on ice or digested as described above with 20 or 40 units of purified PMR-1. The mixtures were heated to inactivate PMR-1, and ethanol was precipitated with 1–2 × 105 dpm of 5′-32P-labeled primer DAN25 (5′-CACTCAGGAGTTTTGTCATTAA), which is complementary to nucleotides 280–301 of albumin mRNA. The precipitated RNA and primer were dissolved in 10 μl of annealing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.7, 0.54 m KCl, 1 mm EDTA), heated at 65 °C for 10 min, and slowly cooled to 25 °C. To each tube was added a mixture of 0.9 mmdATP, dCTP, dGTP, TTP/50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3/13 mm MgCl2/7 mm dithiothreitol and 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase to a total volume of 40 μl. The reaction mixture was incubated for 1.5 h at 42 °C and stopped by the addition of 260 μl of stop solution (0.3 m sodium acetate, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA). Products were recovered by precipitation with 600 μl of cold ethanol. The final pellets were dissolved in 6 μl of formamide loading buffer and electrophoresed on a 6% acrylamide/urea gel. The position of primer extension stops and nuclease cleavage sites was determined relative to a sequencing ladder prepared from the cloned cDNA and the same primer. Earlier work found that degradation intermediates generated by in vitro PMR-1 cleavage of albumin mRNA contained free 3′-hydroxyls, making them susceptible to degradation by 3′- to 5′-exonucleases (23Chernokalskaya E. Dompenciel R.E. Schoenberg D.R. Nucleic Acids Res... 1997; 25: 735-742Google Scholar). We took advantage of this observation to develop a generally applicable approach to the identification ofin vivo mRNA degradation intermediates. The method diagrammed in Fig. 1 involves ligation of a common primer to the 3′-ends of all RNA molecules followed by reverse transcription primed with a nested complementary primer to generate a population of cDNAs corresponding to all of the primer-tagged RNA fragments in the population. The cDNA is PCR-amplified using a 5′-32P-labeled sense-strand primer specific to the mRNA of interest and the nested primer used for reverse transcription, and the resulting products are separated on a denaturing polyacrylamide/urea gel. Bands identified by autoradiography are excised, re-amplified, and sequenced to identify the 3′-end of the mRNA degradation intermediate at the junction between the ligated primer and the target mRNA. Key to this process is the use of a ligation primer that has been modified by addition of a 5′-phosphate for the ligation to the 3′-hydroxyl termini, and a 3′-amino group to prevent further multimerization of the primer during ligation. This technique does not distinguish between decay intermediates generated by endonuclease cleavage versus those produced by pausing of a 3′- to 5′-exonuclease, but as noted under “Discussion,” the latter have not been detected in mRNAs bearing poly(G) tracts. PMR-1 was identified and purified based on its ability to generate a unique product by cleaving within overlapping APyrUGA elements in the 5′-coding region of the molecule (14Pastori R.L. Moskaitis J.E. Schoenberg D.R. Biochemistry.. 1991; 30: 10490-10498Google Scholar, 20Dompenciel R.E. Garnepudi V.R. Schoenberg D.R. J. Biol. Chem... 1995; 270: 6108-6118Google Scholar). Although PMR-1 cleaves preferentially within APyrUGA elements, it is not a restriction endonuclease and also cleaves at numerous “nonconsensus” elements (15Chernokalskaya E. DuBell A.N. Cunningham K.S. Hanson M.N. Dompenciel R.E. Schoenberg D.R. RNA ( N. Y. ).. 1998; 4: 1537-1548Google Scholar, 23Chernokalskaya E. Dompenciel R.E. Schoenberg D.R. Nucleic Acids Res... 1997; 25: 735-742Google Scholar). Fig.2 shows a schematic representation of albumin mRNA with the positions of the 14 APyrUGA elements indicated in relation to the coding (gray) and noncoding (black) regions. All of these elements fall within the coding region, and there are three pairs of overlapping elements (identified with brackets). Because the in vitrocleavage properties of PMR-1 were characterized with the portion of the 5′-coding region, identified as A in Fig. 2, this sequence was evaluated for the appearance of in vivo degradation intermediates following estrogen administration. MaleXenopus were injected with 1 mg of estradiol, and total liver RNA isolated 12 or 24 h later was analyzed by LM-PCR using the A1 primer (indicated with a filled horizontal arrow in Fig. 2) beginning at position 40 of albumin mRNA. Lung RNA isolated at time 0 was used as a control. Fig.3 A shows the gel separation of RT-PCR products generated by amplification with 32P-labeled A1 primer. The bands numbered on the right side of the autoradiogram correspond to the cleavage sites mapped in Fig. 3 C onto structure of the corresponding region of albumin mRNA. A nonspecific product distinct from albumin mRNA was seen to varying degrees in all samples (filled circle). Two major amplification products from time 0 liver RNA were seen in thelower third of the gel, one of which corresponded to position A14, and the other of which was too close to the sequencing primer to be identified (open circle). Of note was the time-dependent appearance of new products 12 and 24 h after estrogen administration (lanes 3 and4). Each of the indicated bands was excised from the gel, amplified, and sequenced to identify the junction between the ligated primer and albumin mRNA degradation products. An example of this is shown in Fig. 3 B for band A11. The sequence 5′-AUU-primer-3′, corresponded to cleavage 5′-AUU/GAACUGA-3′ within the first APyrUGA element in the stem-loop of this portion of albumin mRNA. The positions of the in vivo cleavage sites identified in region A are indicated in Fig. 3 C withnumbered arrows corresponding to the LM-PCR products in Fig.3 A. The filled arrows on this figure identifyin vivo sites that correspond to the main sites of in vitro cleavage by purified PMR-1. Previous work characterized PMR-1 as cleaving between the two pyrimidines in the APyrUGA consensus element (23Chernokalskaya E. Dompenciel R.E. Schoenberg D.R. Nucleic Acids Res... 1997; 25: 735-742Google Scholar). The absolute identification of cleavage sites afforded by the sequencing of LM-PCR products indicated that this was misplaced by a single nucleotide, a result that likely came from the use of DNA markers and sequencing ladders to size RNA degradation intermediates. The actual cleavage lies between the U and G residues, a result that is consistent with inactivation of cleavage upon mutating APyrUGA to APyrAGA (23Chernokalskaya E. Dompenciel R.E. Schoenberg D.R. Nucleic Acids Res... 1997; 25: 735-742Google Scholar). The corrected cleavage sites are indicated in all the figures presented here. In the experiments in Fig.4 primer extension was used to both validate the LM-PCR identification of in vivo decay intermediates and to show that these resulted from cleavage by PMR-1. In the experiment in Fig. 4 A total liver RNA was isolated from control frogs or frogs injected with estradiol 12 h prior to death, and primer extension was performed using a primer for region A indicated by the open arrow above the schematic for albumin mRNA in Fig. 2. The positions of the cleavage site were determined relative to a DNA sequencing ladder prepared from albumin cDNA using the same primer. Although the 12-h post-estrogen liver RNA had little intact full-length albumin mRNA, both this and control RNA display equal signal intensities for products that extend from the primer to the cap site. Because the primer extension will detect all mRNA decay intermediates upstream from the 5′-end of the primer at position 301, these results indicate that there is a substantial population of 5′ decay intermediates that are not detected as discrete products by Northern blot. In agreement with the results in Fig. 3, there was little evidence for decay intermediates within the 5′ 300 nt of albumin mRNA extracted from control animals, and RNA from 12-h estrogen-treated frogs displayed the same in vivo decay intermediates by primer extension (numbered on the side) as those identified in Fig. 3 by LM-PCR. To determine whether these products resulted from in vivocleavage by PMR-1 we subjected the 12-h post-estrogen liver RNA toin vitro digestion with purified PMR-1. Because this preparation retained a significant amount of the first 300 nt of albumin mRNA, we reasoned that further in vitrodigestion with purified PMR-1 should amplify the signal intensity of products generated by PMR-1 cleavage in vivo. Alternatively, if these decay intermediates were not generated by PMR-1, furtherin vitro digestion with the purified enzyme would generate a different set of primer extension products. The results of digestion with 40 units of purified PMR-1 are shown in lanes 1 and2 of Fig. 4 B. In vitro cleavage of RNA that was partially “precleaved” in vivo resulted in increased signal intensity for all of the products identified by both LM-PCR and primer extension. Because previous work showed that these decay products are unique to PMR-1 (23Chernokalskaya E. Dompenciel R.E. Schoenberg D.R. Nucleic Acids Res... 1997; 25: 735-742Google Scholar) these results indicate that the identified decay intermediates resulted from in vivocleavage by PMR-1. Unlike region A in the 5′-coding portion of albumin mRNA, metastable degradation intermediates were never observed in the course of in vitro decay experiments using transcripts from the 3′-end of albumin mRNA (14Pastori R.L. Moskaitis J.E. Schoenberg D.R. Biochemistry.. 1991; 30: 10490-10498Google Scholar). Region G (Fig. 2), spanning position 1690 to 2002 of albumin mRNA, contains 173 nt of the coding region and the 139-nt 3′-UTR, and has four APyrUGA elements. In vivo cleavage within this sequence was analyzed by LM-PCR in Fig. 5 using the RNA from 24-h estrogen-treated frogs evaluated in Fig. 3. It should be noted that the 6% polyacrylamide gels used here and in Fig.6 are only capable of resolving cleavage at three of the four APyrUGA sites. Eight LM-PCR products were identified in the gel in Fig. 5 A, and their positions in the sequence of region G are indicated in Fig. 5 B. Site G1 corresponds to the 3′-end of albumin mRNA, and sequencing of this confirmed the presence of the <17-nt"
https://openalex.org/W2068252901,"A comparative study of the oxidative refolding for nine selected potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor (PCI) mutants was carried out using the disulfide quenching approach. The mutations were performed at the N- and C-terminal tails of PCI outside its disulfide stabilized central core. The differences between the refolding of wild type and mutant proteins were observed in the second phase of the refolding process, the reshuffling of disulfide bridges, although the first phase, nonspecific packing, was not greatly affected by the mutations. Point mutations at the C-tail or deletion of up to three C-terminal residues of PCI resulted in a lower efficiency of the reshuffling process. In the case of the mutants lacking five N-terminal or four or five C-terminal residues, no ”native-like“ form was observed after the refolding process. On the other hand, the double mutant G35P/P36G did not attain a native-like form either, although one slightly more stable species was observed after being submitted to refolding. The disulfide pairing of this species is different from that of the wtPCI native form. The differences between the refolding process of wild type and mutant forms are interpreted in the light of the new view of protein folding. The results of the present study support the hypothesis that the refolding of this small disulfide-rich protein, and others, is driven by noncovalent interactions at the reshuffling stage. It is also shown that the interactions established between the N- and C-tail residues and the core of PCI are important for the proper refolding of the protein.

Small proteins that are rich in disulfide bridges are good models for studying the folding process using the disulfide quenching method, where the folding intermediates that form during their oxidative refolding are trapped at low pH, separated on HPLC, 1The abbreviations used are:HPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyBPTIbovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitorCPAcarboxypeptidase AEGFepidermal growth factorGdnClguanidinium chlorideMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flightPCIpotato carboxypeptidase inhibitorwtPCIwild type PCI and analyzed (1Creighton T.E. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 83-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 2Creighton, T. E. (ed) (1992) Protein Folding, pp. 301-351, EMBL, HeidelbergGoogle Scholar). Among the first and more thoroughly studied proteins using this technique was bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI). Initially, mixed intermediates with native and non-native disulfide bridges were detected along the folding process (3Creighton T.E. Goldenberg D.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 179: 497-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). In later studies of BPTI folding (4Weissman J.S. Kim P.S. Science. 1991; 253: 1386-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar), all of the well populated intermediates were found to contain only native disulfide bonds. Such results would support the idea of a single pathway for BPTI folding. Recently, it has been shown that BPTI also unfolds through a unique mechanism (5Chang J.Y. Li L. Bulychev A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8287-8299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). high performance liquid chromatography bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor carboxypeptidase A epidermal growth factor guanidinium chloride matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor wild type PCI In contrast, the studies of hirudin (6Chatrenet B.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11702-11709Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) showed a high heterogeneity of folding intermediates containing both native and non-native disulfide bonds. In these proteins, the folding of the fully reduced protein to the native form occurs in a first phase as a flow of equilibrated 1-disulfide intermediates through equilibrated 2-disulfide intermediates to reach the equilibrated 3-disulfide scrambled species. In the second phase, the rate-limiting step, the scrambled species are reshuffled to finally form the native species. Moreover, the folding process seems to follow multiple parallel pathways. This mechanism would be consistent with the new view of protein folding processes describing folding funnels and energy landscapes (10Baldwin R.L. Nature. 1994; 369: 183-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 11Dill K.A. Chan H.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 10-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (2014) Google Scholar), i.e. parallel folding events, rather than the classical model of sequential folding via unique routes. Further studies to characterize in depth the folding/unfolding process of the above mentioned or other disulfide rich proteins, based on such disulfide-quenching method, could help to clarify why and how multiple pathways take place not only in those particular proteins but also in other protein types, allowing comparisons with those lacking disulfides. With this purpose in mind, we have concentrated our attention on PCI. PCI is a 39-residue globular protein that competitively inhibits several metallocarboxypeptidases with a K i in the nanomolar range (12Hass G.M. Ryan C.A. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 778-791Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Its three-dimensional structure is known in aqueous solution (13Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Nilges M. Ryan C.A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8012-8023Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) and in crystal state in complex with carboxypeptidase A (CPA) (14Rees D.C. Lipscomb W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 160: 475-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The 27-residue core, reinforced by three disulfide bridges, forms a T-knot scaffold, also found in other proteins with different functions such as serine protease inhibitors from the squash family, the ω-conotoxins from snake venoms, or the EGF superfamily of growth factors (15Lin S.L. Nussinov R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 835-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). PCI has 7 amino acid residues at the N-tail of the hydrophobic central core and a 5-residue C-tail, which is the primary binding site of PCI to carboxypeptidase A. The energetic contribution of each residue of the C-tail in the PCI·CPA complex has been evaluated by site-directed mutagenesis studies (16Molina M.A. Marino-Buslje C. Oliva B. Aviles F.X. Querol E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21467-21472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Marino-Buslje C. Venhudová G. Molina M.A. Oliva B. Jorba X. Canals F. Aviles F.X. Querol E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1502-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The biological function of PCI is probably the inhibition of insect digestive metallocarboxypeptidases as part of the defense system of the potato plant against insect attack (12Hass G.M. Ryan C.A. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 778-791Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that PCI possesses interesting anti-tumoral properties that are related to its structural similarity to EGF and other related growth factors (18Blanco-Aparicio C. Molina M.A. Fernández-Salas E. Frazier M.L. Mas J.M. Querol E. Aviles F.X. de Llorens R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12370-12377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), all of them having the so-called T-knot topology (19Mas J.M. Aloy P. Martı́-Renom M.A. Oliva B. Blanco-Aparicio C. Molina M.A. de Llorens R. Querol E. Aviles F.X. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Previous studies on the effect of denaturants on the folding pathway of PCI (7Chang J.Y. Canals F. Schindler P. Querol E. Aviles F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22087-22094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that specific noncovalent interactions mainly direct the reshuffling stage of the process. From the results of oxidative folding and reductive unfolding of hirudin, the intertwining dependence of the disulfide bonds and noncovalent forces was also concluded (20Chang J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 69-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Thus, in the proposed model for the folding of these small disulfide-rich proteins (6Chatrenet B. Chang J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20988-20996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Chang J.Y. Canals F. Schindler P. Querol E. Aviles F.X. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11702-11709Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), until the scrambled species are formed the noncovalent interactions would not direct the folding, whereas the reshuffling step would be driven by noncovalent forces. We have also recently characterized the unfolding pathway of PCI (21Chang J.Y. Li L. Canals F. Aviles F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14205-14211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), showing that the bead-form scrambled isomer (presumably the most extended) is a significant intermediate in the process and that, under physiological conditions, scrambled isomers of PCI exist in equilibrium with the native form. In the course of preparing recombinant PCI mutants constructed for functional studies, we found that some of the mutants were obtained in very low yield when expressed in Escherichia coli, even when the sequence changes did not affect the globular core of the protein. These observations prompted us to perform a comparative study of the oxidative refolding of selected mutants. The results of the study presented here show that the residues in the N- and C-tails of PCI are important for its folding, by affecting the reshuffling stage of the process to a different extent. The knowledge on the involvement of the noncovalent interactions between PCI tails and central core in its folding can be of importance in the future redesign of this small protein for pharmaceutical or other biotechnological purposes. The Y37G, P36G, G35P/P36G, ΔVal38–Gly39, ΔTyr37–Gly39, ΔPro36–Gly39, and ΔGly35–Gly39 PCI mutant genes were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis of wild type PCI synthetic gene (22Molina M.A. Aviles F.X. Querol E. Gene. 1992; 116: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) cloned in PINIII-OmpA3 vector (23Ghrayeb J. Kimura H. Takahara M. Hsiung H. Masui Y. Inouye M. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2437-2442Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified from the culture medium by ion exchange fast protein liquid chromatography and reverse-phase HPLC. Details regarding the construction of the mutant vectors and purification of the expressed proteins have been published elsewhere (17Marino-Buslje C. Venhudová G. Molina M.A. Oliva B. Jorba X. Canals F. Aviles F.X. Querol E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1502-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). ΔGIy39PCI was obtained by the incubation of wtPCI with CPA at 1:1 molar ratio for 4 h followed by purification on a Vydac C-4 HPLC column. CPA is known to cleave the Gly39 residue of PCI rapidly after the enzyme-inhibitor complex is formed (24Hass G.M. Ryan C.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 97: 1481-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). ΔGlu1–Asp5 PCI was obtained by acid hydrolysis of wtPCI as described previously (25Hass G.M. Ako H. Grahn D.T. Neurath H. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The trimmed form was separated from the intact wtPCI on a Vydac C-4 HPLC column, and its N-terminal sequence was checked on a Beckman LF3000 automatic sequencer. All of the purified mutant proteins were characterized by analytical reverse-phase HPLC and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. 100-μg aliquots of lyophilized of proteins were used in each folding experiment. The protein was dissolved in 0.5 ml Tris-HCl (0.5 m, pH 8.5) containing 5m GdnCl and 30 mm dithiothreitol. After 2 h at 25 °C the reduced and denatured protein was passed through a PD-10 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) gel filtration column equilibrated with Tris-HCl buffer (0.1 m, pH 8.5). The protein was eluted in 1.2 ml of the same buffer and split in two parts that were diluted to a final concentration of 60 μg/ml with 0.1 mTris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5, and the same buffer containing 1 mm cysteine, respectively. Samples from both solutions containing 5 μg of protein were collected in a time course manner for up to 3 days, and were acid-trapped by mixing with an equal volume of 1‥ trifluoroacetic acid. They were analyzed by HPLC on a Nova-Pak C-18 column (Waters), 3.9 × 150 mm, 4 μm, under the following conditions: solvent A was water containing 0.1‥ trifluoroacetic acid, solvent B was acetonitrile containing 0.1‥ trifluoroacetic acid, and the gradient was linear, 20–40‥ solvent B in 30 min. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was performed on a Bruker-Biflex spectrometer. Ionization was accomplished with a 337 nm pulsed nitrogen laser. Spectra were acquired in linear or reflectron positive ion mode, using a 19 kV acceleration voltage. Samples were prepared by mixing equal volumes of a 1–10 μm solution of the protein and a saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, used as a matrix, in aqueous 30‥ acetonitrile with 0.1‥ trifluoroacetic acid. 1 μl of this mixture was spotted on the sample slide and allowed to evaporate to dryness Samples for CD spectroscopy were prepared by dissolving the lyophilized aliquots to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml in 0.1‥ trifluoroacetic acid or buffer (1 mm sodium citrate, 1 mm sodium borate, 1 mm sodium phosphate, 25 mm NaCl, pH 2, 7, or 11) for the pH dependence spectra. The far-UV circular dichroism spectra were collected on a Jasco spectrometer at 25 °C using a cell of 2 mm path length. The disulfide bond pairing of the most stable species of the G35P/P36G PCI mutant was assigned by the partial reduction method (26Wu J. Watson J.T. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). 50 μg of lyophilized protein was denatured in 10 μl of 0.1 m citrate buffer, pH 3, containing 6 m GdnCl for 30 min at 25 °C. Then the protein was partially reduced by 90 nmtris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine for 15 min at 25 °C and cyanylated by 4.8 μm 1-cyano-4-dimethylamino-pyridinium tetrafluoroborate for 15 min. The reaction mixture was subjected to reverse-phase HPLC and the three cyanylated isomers resulting from reduction of a single disulfide bond, as identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, were isolated. They were subjected to cleavage of the peptide bonds on the N-terminal side of the cyanylated cysteines for one h at 37 °C in a solution of 1 m ammonium hydroxide containing 6 m GdnCl, and finally the remaining disulfide bonds were reduced by 0.1 m tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine for 30 min at 37 °C. The resulting mixtures of peptides were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, and the disulfide bonds were deduced from the obtained mass maps. Selected PCI scrambled species, scrambled A form of wtPCI (defined in Ref. 7Chang J.Y. Canals F. Schindler P. Querol E. Aviles F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22087-22094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the G35P/P36G PCI most stable form, or scrambled species of mutants ΔPro36–Gly39 and ΔGly35–Gly39) were isolated by HPLC on a Vydac C-18 column from the corresponding mixture of refolding intermediates, obtained as detailed under ”Refolding Experiments.“ 1 μg of the purified scrambled species, or the native wtPCI form as a control, were incubated for 1 h with 1 μg of elastase in 0.1m Tris-Cl, pH 8.8, buffer or with 0.05 μg of thermolysin in 50 mm N-ethylmorpholine, pH 6.5, buffer. The resulting digests were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The inhibitory activities of the different mutant PCI forms were assayed according to Hass and Ryan (12Hass G.M. Ryan C.A. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 778-791Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Benzoyl-glycyl-l-phenylalanine was used as a substrate at 0.1 m concentration, and the enzyme (bovine carboxypeptidase A) was at 42.5 nm. The assays were performed at pH 7.5. The oxidative refolding in vitro of different N- and C-tail mutant forms of PCI was studied by reverse-phase HPLC analysis of the acid-trapped disulfide intermediates present in samples collected at different times during the refolding processes, these processes being followed either in the absence or presence of an external thiol added (cysteine) (see ”Experimental Procedures“). The assays were always performed in parallel to a control refolding experiment of wtPCI under the same conditions. The refolding conditions used in this study (i.e. protein concentration, buffer conditions, the type of thiol reagent, and its concentration) were selected so that the qualitative or quantitative differences in the refolding process between the wild type and mutant PCI forms could be distinguished (number and type of folding intermediates, kinetics of the process) within a few hours' time span, being slightly different from those of a previous paper (7Chang J.Y. Canals F. Schindler P. Querol E. Aviles F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22087-22094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The typical results observed for the refolding of wtPCI under the selected conditions are shown in Fig. 1. The protein was initially reduced and denatured in the presence of excess dithiothreitol and 5 m GdnCl and then quickly brought to the refolding buffer by gel filtration on a small PD-10 column. The HPLC profile of a sample collected immediately after the gel filtration (t = 0, Fig. 1) mainly contained a mixture of 3-disulfide paired scrambled species, as identified according to their chromatographic behavior, well characterized in previous studies on the disulfide refolding of PCI (7Chang J.Y. Canals F. Schindler P. Querol E. Aviles F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22087-22094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under the above conditions, it was observed (Fig. 1) that the first stage of nonspecific packing of wtPCI to reach 3-disulfide paired species was very quick and that the second stage of disulfide reshuffling of scrambled intermediates was rate-limiting. The evolution of these intermediates thereafter was very slow in the buffer without added cysteine (Fig. 1, left), probably being catalyzed only by the small amount of protein free thiols still present and leading to a final trapped mixture with less than 10‥ of the native species. In contrast, when 1 mm cysteine was added, a much faster reshuffling of the scrambled species led to a mixture in which more than 80‥ of the protein had the native disulfide pairing (Fig. 1,right). When the study was performed on the N- and C-tail mutant forms of PCI, all of the mutants analyzed showed a first stage of refolding as fast as wtPCI under the same conditions. In the chromatograms obtained immediately after passing the samples through the PD-10 column, the main peaks corresponded to 3-disulfide scrambled species (results not shown), the subsequent evolution being very small when free cysteine was lacking in the buffer (see Figs. 2,3, and 4 for the patterns observed after 3 h).Figure 3Folding behavior of PCI mutants unable to form a native-like structure (Group II). Refolding experiments on wild type (wt) and mutant PCI forms were performed as in Fig. 1. The chromatograms corresponding to the 3-h refolding mixtures in the absence (−Cys) or presence (+Cys) of 1 mm cysteine are shown for each protein.

Top panel, chromatograms corresponding to 3-h refolding mixtures of the wtPCI and G35P/P36G mutant without (−Cys) and with (+Cys) 1 mm cysteine added. The refolding experiments were performed as described in Fig. 1. The peaks are marked as follows:N, the native wtPCI form; A, the scrambled A wtPCI species; and S, the more stable G35P/P36G mutant species. The elution position of the fully reduced species for the double mutant is indicated by R. Bottom panel, disulfide bond pairing of the Sspecies of the G35P/P36G mutant compared with that of the native species of wtPCI. The disulfide bond pairing was determined by using a partial reduction method and mass spectrometry as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The boxes mark the residues changed by the mutation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) However, significant differences between mutants were observed in the second step of the refolding process, i.e. in the reshuffling step, when 1 mm cysteine was present. According to the evolution of their chromatographic pattern, the mutants were classified in three groups. Mutants of a first group (Group I) resembled wtPCI in their behavior (Fig. 2.). These included point mutations in the C-terminal tail (P36G and Y37G) and consecutive deletions of up to three residues of the C-tail. It seems clear that the isomers marked ”N“ are what could be called native-like forms of each mutant, i.e. they possess the same disulfide bridging as wtPCI native form and presumably have a compact stable structure, as supported by the following findings: they all maintained CPA inhibitory activity, their retention time in the HPLC column was almost identical to that of the wtPCI form, and their relative amounts in the refolded mixtures increased in the course of refolding, so they seemed to be the most stable forms. As in the case of wtPCI, there was a remarkable difference between the mixtures with and without cysteine added. Little or no native-like form could be observed in the samples refolded in the buffer alone, whereas a significant amount of this form was seen in the mixtures with cysteine. The percentages of native-like forms in ΔGly39, ΔVal38–Gly39, and Y37G mutants are close to wtPCI (more than 55‥), whereas the trapped mixtures of P36G and ΔTyr37–Gly39mutants after 3 h contained only about 30‥ of such form. The percentages of native-like forms obtained for each protein under these conditions indicate a different kinetic efficiency for their reshuffling process. If a higher concentration of reducing agent is present in the refolding buffer, more than 90‥ of native-like species is formed for each of the mutants from this Group I (data not shown). A second group was represented by mutants with a very different refolding behavior and which are not able to reach a native-like conformation (Group II). Their chromatograms after 3 h of refolding are shown in Fig. 3. Their mutations represent the largest changes made in the sequence of PCI tails (although they do not affect the amino acid residues of the core stabilized by the disulfide bonds), being the result of the deletion of four or five residues in the C-terminal tail or the deletion of five residues in the N-terminal tail of PCI. In this Group II no differences in the chromatographic profile could be observed between the 3-h trapped mixtures with and without cysteine. In none of these mixtures was a significant peak that could be considered a native-like form seen. It is worth mentioning that the ΔGlu1–Asp5mutant was initially prepared by direct mild acid hydrolysis from native wtPCI, leading to a protein that maintained the disulfide pairing and CPA inhibitory activity. Therefore, the HPLC elution time of such an N-terminal truncated form can be considered that which corresponds to the actual native-like species. However, when this truncated protein was reduced and allowed to refold, none of the resulting ”refolded“ chromatographic forms showed either a peak at the former elution time (Fig. 3) or any inhibitory activity. Thus, this protein variant lacking the N-terminal tail, once reduced, is not able to refold to its original native-like conformation. It is not obvious whether some of the disulfide isomers of the mutants lacking four or five amino acids in the C-tail of PCI have the same disulfide pairing as the native PCI. As these mutants do not contain the residues that constitute the primary binding site to CPA, the activity assay does not give information about the conformation of the proteins. Besides, the HPLC retention times of the ”correctly folded“ forms of these mutants are not known. However, as we observe no evolution of the ”scrambled“ forms to one HPLC peak during refolding in the presence of cysteine, it seems likely that these mutations cause the inability of PCI to form a native-like stable conformation. The species present in the final refolding mixtures of these two mutants were isolated by HPLC and assayed for susceptibility to protease digestion. All of the species were found to be extensively degraded by elastase or thermolysin under conditions in which the native form of wtPCI is resistant to digestion. This behavior is also consistent with these species not having a native-like compact conformation. For all three mutants of Group II attempts to obtain the correctly folded proteins in the presence of higher concentrations of reducing agent were carried out. The formation of a native-like form was not detected even in the presence of 4 mm cysteine, conditions under which wtPCI forms more than 90‥ of native species in less than 1 h (data not shown). The refolding process and characteristics of the G35P/P36G double mutant are different, and therefore it was included in a third group (Group III). The chromatograms of its 3-h trapped refolding mixtures are shown in Fig. 4. A clear difference is observed between the chromatograms of the trapped mixtures in the absence or presence of added cysteine in a way similar to that observed for wtPCI or the mutants of Group I. In this case, the relative amount of one species (peak labeled S in Fig. 4) also increased when cysteine was added to the refolding buffer. Although the overall amino acid content of this double mutant is the same as that of wtPCI, the chromatographic behavior on the reverse-phase HPLC of this species (S) is very different from that of the wtPCI native form and resembles that of the scrambled species A of wtPCI (7Chang J.Y. Canals F. Schindler P. Querol E. Aviles F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22087-22094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that such a species S can have a disulfide bond pairing different from the native form of wtPCI. To confirm this possibility, the disulfide bond pairing of such a most stable form of G35P/P36G (peak S) was determined by a partial reduction-mass spectrometry method (see ”Experimental Procedures“). Disulfide bridges between cysteines I–V, II–III, and IV–VI (see Fig. 4) were found, confirming a different pairing from that of the native wtPCI. Interestingly, the same disulfide pairing has also been determined for the scrambled species A of wtPCI. 2S. Pavia, unpublished observations. Unlike results observed for the mutants of Group I, when refolding was attempted under more favorable conditions (higher cysteine concentrations) or longer times, no further evolution of the mixture of intermediates was observed for the G35P/P36G mutant. This seems to indicate that the species S, which increases in the refolding mixture with cysteine, is not actually native-like, in the sense that its thermodynamic stability is not much higher than that of the other coexisting 3-disulfide species.

Treatment of human cancer cell lines with DDP induced a decrease in the hCHK1 protein levels starting 6 h after treatment, with a further decline at 24 and 48 h. A similar decrease in the levels of hCHK1 was found at the mRNA level by using Northern blot analysis. By using isogenic cell systems in which p53 was disrupted either by transfection with HPV-E6 or by targeted homologous recombination, we found that the DNA damage-induced down-regulation of hCHK1 was only observable in wild type p53-expressing cells, with only a minor decline in the hCHK1 levels observable 48 h after treatment in cells with disrupted p53. Similarly, treatment of mutant p53-expressing human cancer cell lines with DDP did not result in changes in the levels of hCHK1. The p53-dependent down-regulation of hCHK1 is likely to be at transcriptional levels, as suggested by the lack of down-regulation of the hCHK1 when transfected under the control of a heterologous viral promoter. In addition, p53 is able to down-regulate the luciferase activity under the control of the 5′ flanking region of the hCHK1 gene. The data suggest a strict link between p53 and hCHK1 governing the activation and repression of the G2 checkpoint in which both proteins participate.

The G1 checkpoint is in part dependent on the p53-regulated transcription of p21, a potent inhibitor of the cyclin-cdk complexes required for the G1-S transition (1el Deiry W.S. Tokino T.

Cells lacking a functional p53 are defective in the G1 checkpoint in response to DNA damage, still retaining checkpoint mechanisms by which cells are arrested in G2phase (3Fan S. Smith M.L.

This is thought to be determined by phosphorylation and inactivation of cdc25 phosphatase, which in the phosphorylated form binds the proteins of the 14–3-3 family and is prevented from activating the cdc2 complex (7Lopez-Girona A.

Moreover, a growing body of data is accumulating on a possible cross-connection between p53 and hCHK1 and hCHK2; in particular, there is evidence that hCHK1 and hCHK2 are able to phosphorylate and activate p53 in response to DNA damage (15Shieh S.Y.

In the present study we investigated the consequences of the cellular response to the DNA-damaging agent cis-dichlorodiammine platinum(II) on hCHK1 and in particular on its regulation by p53. The human colocarcinoma cell line HCT-116 was maintained in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The human endometrial HEC1A cells, the human ovarian cancer cell line SKOV3, and the human leukemic cell line Jurkat were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The human osteosarcoma cells U2OS, transfected with HA-hCHK1, were kindly supplied by Dr. C. Mercurio (IEO, Milan, Italy) and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 400 μg/ml G418. HCT-116/E6 cells were obtained and maintained as previously described (18Vikhanskaya F. Colella G. Valenti M. Parodi S. D'Incalci M. Broggini M. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 937-941PubMed Google Scholar). HCT-116 cells with p53 gene disrupted by targeted homologous recombination (clone 392.7, p53−/−) and their relative controls (clone 40–16, p53+/+) were kindly provided by Dr. B. Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD). Cis-dichlorodiammine platinum(II) (DDP1; Sigma) was dissolved in medium just before use. For each cell line, DDP treatment was performed for 24 h at the concentration approximately inhibiting the growth by 50% (IC50). Nocodazole was purchased from Sigma. Cell extracts, obtained at the end of treatment and at 6, 24, or 48 h after recovery in drug-free medium, were prepared by lysing cells in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mmEDTA, 50 mm NaF in the presence of aprotinin, leupeptin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride as protease inhibitors, for 30 min on ice. Insoluble material was pelleted at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the protein concentration was determined using a Bio-Rad assay kit (Bio-Rad). Forty μg of total cellular proteins were separated via SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose. Immunoblotting was carried out with polyclonal anti-hCHK1 antibody (8Sanchez Y. Wong C. Thoma R.S. Richman R. Wu Z. Piwnica-Worms H. Elledge S.J. Science. 1997; 277: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar), p53 monoclonal antibody (DO-1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany), anti-actin polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Antibody binding was revealed by peroxidase secondary antibodies and visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Total RNA was isolated from cells growing in culture by the guanidine-thiocyanate method according to standard procedures (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), fractionated by electrophoresis on a formaldehyde-agarose gel, and transferred to nylon membranes. Filters were hybridized with cDNAs 32P-labeled using a Rediprime kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hybridizations were done in 50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 1% SDS, 1 mNaCl at 42 °C for 16 h, followed by two 10-min washes at room temperature with 2× SSC (150 mm NaCl, 15 mmsodium citrate) and one 30-min wash at 65 °C in 2× SSC, 1% SDS. Cells (2 × 106) were removed 24 h following treatment with DDP, washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 2 ml of a solution containing 2.5 μg/ml propidium iodide and 25 μg/ml RNase, and stained overnight at 4 °C in the dark. Cell cycle analysis was done on at least 10,000 cells for each sample using the FACSORT system (Becton Dickinson). The percentage of cell cycle phase distribution was calculated as previously described (20Broggini M. Erba E. Ponti M. Ballinari D. Geroni C. Spreafico F. D'Incalci M. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 199-204PubMed Google Scholar). SKOV3 cells were cotransfected with 4 μg of pGL2-derived plasmids (Promega) containing the 5′ flanking region of the hCHK1 gene isolated from a human P1artificial chromosome clone 2G. Damia, L. Carrassa, and M. Broggini, manuscript in preparation. or with 4 μg of p21-Luc construct (kindly provided by Dr. C. Prives, Columbia University, New York, NY) and with 4 μg of a plasmid encoding for human p53. 0.05 μg of untreated pRL-SV40 were used for internal normalization. Reporter gene activities were evaluated after 24 h using the Dual-Luciferase system (Promega). Results are expressed as the percentage of the control luciferase reported activity normalized by the renilla activity value. The mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments is shown. Treatment of human HCT-116 cells with 25 μM DDP resulted in a decrease in the levels of hCHK1 starting 6 h after treatment, with a further strong decrease observable at 24 and 48 h (Fig.1 A), whereas no modification of the mobility of the protein could be observed. Treatment of the isogenic cell line (HCT-116/E6) in which p53 was inactivated (through HPV16/E6 transfection) with the same concentration of DDP (25 μM) did not result in such a decrease, although at 48 h after treatment a slight decrease in the hCHK1 levels could be found. The densitometric analysis of the results of three independent experiments (each performed in duplicate) is reported in Fig. 1 B, where it is shown that after an initial decline of ∼25% at 6 h, by 48 h the levels of hCHK1 in the HCT-116 cell line treated with DDP are less than 5% of the controls. At the same time point, in the HCT-116/E6 cell line treated with DDP the levels of hCHK1 are ∼65% of the controls. To test whether the difference in hCHK1 levels was related to a different DDP-induced cell cycle perturbation, a time course of cell cycle distribution induced by 25 μM DDP in HCT-116 and HCT-116/E6 cells was performed (Fig. 2 A). As expected, a G1 arrest was present only in HCT-116 wt cells at the end of treatment and at 6 h after drug washout, whereas in both cell lines DDP induced a G2M block measurable at 24 and 48 h after treatment. At 48 h after drug washout the ratio between the percentage of cells in G2M and G1 phases was not so different between the two cell lines (3.1 and 2.7 for HCT-116 and HCT-116/E6 cells, respectively). Treatment of both HCT-116 and HCT-116/E6 cells with 0.4 μg/ml nocodazole, causing in both cell lines an accumulation of cells in the G2 phase of cell cycle (Fig. 2 B), did not result in any change in the levels of hCHK1 (Fig. 2 C). To check whether the DDP-induced decrease in the levels of hCHK1 was observable also at mRNA levels, a Northern blot analysis using the same experimental conditions reported for the Western blotting analysis was performed (Fig. 3 A). A decrease in the levels of both hCHK1 transcripts was clearly observable in HCT-116 cells but not in HCT-116/E6 cells. Densitometric scanning of three independent blots (performed on the lower transcript) (Fig.3 B), in fact, resulted in an ∼20% decrease at 6 h, an 80% decrease at 24 h, and a 90% decrease at 48 h after treatment in HCT-116 cells, whereas no appreciable changes in HCT-116/E6 cells were found up to 24 h, with a marginal decrease in hCHK1 mRNA levels observable at 48 h after DDP treatment. To further evaluate the p53-dependent down-regulation of hCHK1, we used a clone derived from HCT-116 cells in which the p53 gene was disrupted by gene targeting (21Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S. Brown J.P. Sedivy J.M. Kinzler K. Vogelstein B. Science. 1998; 282: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2538) Google Scholar). As reported in Fig.4, 12.5 μM DDP induced hCHK1 decrease in HCT-116 p53+/+ cells, with minor changes induced only at 48 h in HCT-116 p53−/− cells treated with the same DDP concentrations, in agreement with the results obtained with HCT-116 cells with HPV16-E6-inactivated p53. Similarly, when human cancer cell lines expressing mutated p53 (HEC1A, Fig. 5; and Jurkat, data not shown) were treated with cytotoxic concentrations of DDP (30 μM), no decrease in hCHK1 levels was observed, again strongly supporting the p53 dependence of hCHK1 decrease observed after DDP treatment.Figure 5Western blot analysis in p53 mutant-expressing HEC1A cells treated with 30 μM DDP. Treatment conditions and blot hybridizations were as described in the legend to Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Trying to define whether the p53-induced down-regulation of hCHK1 was due to a specific transcriptional repression of the hCHK1 gene, we used the p53 wild type U2OS cells transfected with the HA-CHK1 gene under the control of a CMV promoter. Treatment of these cells with 12.5 μM DDP induced down-regulation of endogenous hCHK1 (Fig.6), whereas no effect (if not an increase) was found against the exogenous, HA-tagged hCHK1. The same filter was reprobed with an anti-HA antibody, and a lack of CMV-driven, HA-tagged hCHK1 down-regulation is clearly observed. Importantly, the ratio between endogenous and HA-tagged hCHK1 dramatically changed after DDP treatment. In fact, by densitometric analysis the levels of endogenous hCHK1 were 2–3-fold higher than exogenous hCHK1 before DDP treatment, whereas at 24 and 48 h after treatment, the ratio between endogenous and exogenous hCHK1 was 0.2. Finally, we analyzed luciferase constructs containing in both orientations the 5′ flanking region of the hCHK1 gene. Transfection of an 867-base pair fragment in sense, but not in antisense, orientation induced luciferase activity (Fig. 7) in p53 null SKOV3 cells. Cotransfection with a human p53 expression vector reduced this activity by ∼50%. Similar results were obtained when other constructs (containing 1200 and 1600 base pairs of the 5′ flanking region of the hCHK1 gene) were used (data not shown). The same p53-expressing vector was able to induce in the same experimental conditions the transcription of the p53-responsive promoter p21. The product of the tumor suppressor gene p53 plays a central role in both G1 and G2 checkpoints (1el Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E.

In different cellular systems, after DNA damage the cells respond by inducing an increase in the levels of p53 and consequently a transcriptional activation of genes regulated by p53 (22Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 56: 2649-2654Google Scholar, 23Oren M. Prives C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1288: R13-R19PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, p53 not only activates transcription but also induces repression (through a mechanism not yet established) of different genes (23Oren M. Prives C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1288: R13-R19PubMed Google Scholar). Posttranslational modifications of p53, such as phosphorylation and acetylation, are thought to play a key role in the mechanisms of activation of p53 (24Meek D.W. Cell Signalling. 1998; 10: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 25Giaccia A.J. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2973-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar). In particular, phosphorylation at the N terminus of p53 can relieve the inhibitory effect of mdm2, resulting in an increase in the levels of p53 (26Prives C.

Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1754) Google Scholar). The kinases possibly involved in these phosphorylations are DNA-PK, ATM, ATR, hCHK1, and hCHK2, all shown to be able, at least in vitro, to phosphorylate p53 (15Shieh S.Y. Ahn J. Tamai K. Taya Y. Prives C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 289-300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Chehab N.H. Malikzay A. Appel M. Halazonetis T.D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 278-288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Hirao A.

Cell Signalling. 1998; 10: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). hCHK1 is the human homologue of the yeast chk1, a protein important for the G2 DNA damage checkpoint that prevents mitosis when DNA is being repaired (8Sanchez Y. Wong C. Thoma R.S. Richman R. Wu Z. Piwnica-Worms H. Elledge S.J. Science. 1997; 277: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). Chk1 is phosphorylated after damage by a mechanism that required checkpoint Rad proteins, including Rad 3 and the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mec1/Tel1 (28Walworth N.C. Bernards R. Science. 1996; 271: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 29al-Khodairy F. Fotou E. Sheldrick K.S. Griffiths D.J. Lehmann A.R. Carr A.M. Mol. Biol.

It has been proposed that chk1 might regulate the activity of cdc2 by phosphorylating the tyrosine kinase Wee 1, which inactivates cdc2, or the protein phosphatase cdc25, which activates cdc2. Recently it has also been shown that in S. cerevisiae chk1 is required for the function of the DNA damage checkpoint maintaining the abundance of Psd1, an anaphase inhibitor (31Sanchez Y. Bachant J. Wang H. Hu F. Liu D. Tetzlaff M. Elledge S.J. Science. 1999; 286: 1166-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). It seems likely that hCHK1 also operates downstream from ATM and, once activated, phosphorylates cdc25C, creating a consensus site for the binding to 14–3-3 family members and preventing the entry of cells in mitosis (5Weinert T. Science. 1997; 277: 1450-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 8Sanchez Y. Wong C. Thoma R.S. Richman R. Wu Z. Piwnica-Worms H. Elledge S.J.

Science. 1997; 277: 1501-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar). As already reported by others (32Kaneko Y.S. Watanabe N. Morisaki H. Akita H. Fujimoto A. Tominaga K. Terasawa M. Tachibana A. Ikeda K. Nakanishi M. Kaneko Y.S. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3673-3681Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), we did not observe in our experimental condition the reduction in the electrophoretic mobility of hCHK1 described in HeLa cells after UV treatment (8Sanchez Y. Wong C. Thoma R.S. Richman R. Wu Z. Piwnica-Worms H. Elledge S.J. Science. 1997; 277: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar) and possibly related to an activation of hCHK1 through phosphorylation. These apparently contrasting results might be due to the different cellular systems used and do not exclude the possibility that other forms of hCHK1 activation do indeed occur. On the contrary, a clear-cut decrease in hChK1 protein level was observed, and this event was found to be p53-dependent. Here we show that p53, which has recently been shown to be phosphorylated and activatedin vitro and in vivo by hCHK1 (15Shieh S.Y. Ahn J. Tamai K. Taya Y. Prives C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 289-300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is then able to induce a down-regulation of hCHK1. The evidence reported here, obtained in isogenic cell systems (in which p53 was inactivated by either viral transfection or targeted homologous disruption), suggests a possible regulatory loop between p53 and hCHK1 in which, after DNA damage, both p53 and hCHK1 are activated; once activated, p53 represses the transcription of the hCHK1 gene, resulting in the inactivation of this checkpoint protein at later times. This regulatory loop between hCHK1 and p53 is reminiscent of other regulatory strategies that have been described either in procaryotes or in eucaryotic systems and that underlie the fact that a specific DNA damage response (i.e. the maintenance of a sustained G2M block) might be deleterious and need to be quickly down-regulated once the cells have repaired the DNA damage (33Huang M. Zhou Z. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1998; 94: 595-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 34Jang Y.K. Wang L. Sancar G.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7630-7638Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Another negative feedback loop exists for p53 that, once activated, transcriptionally up-regulates mdm2, which is in turn a negative regulator of its transcriptional activity and stability (35Oren M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36031-36034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). As for the molecular mechanisms responsible for the p53-dependent hCHK1 down-regulation, the experiments performed in cells transfected with HA-tagged hCHK1 clearly show that the hCHK1 gene under the control of a viral promoter is not a target of p53-induced repression, and the initial analysis of the 5′ flanking region of the hCHK1 gene strongly suggests that the action of p53 occurs, at least partially, at the level of the hCHK1 promoter. Furthermore, the use of proteosome inhibitors did not modify the DDP-induced hCHK1 down-regulation in HCT-116 cells (data not shown). The difference in cell cycle perturbations induced by the DNA damaging agent DDP in cells expressing a wt p53 compared with cells with inactivated p53 is not the reason for the drug-induced difference in the levels of hCHK1 between these cell types. In fact, in both cell systems DDP induces an accumulation of cells in G2M phases. At early times the G1 block was present, as expected, only in cells with a wt p53. Furthermore, nocodazole treatment induces a superimposable G2M arrest in both wt p53 and p53-inactivated cells without inducing changes in the levels of hCHK1 in both cell lines. The strong p53-dependent decrease of hCHK1 protein levels at late time points after drug treatment, together with the recent observation that cell lines with a wt p53 express lower levels of hCHK2 compared with mutant p53-expressing cells (36Tominaga K. Morisaki H. Kaneko Y. Fujimoto A. Tanaka T. Ohtsubo M. Hirai M. Okayama H. Ikeda K. Nakanishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31463-31467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), might be the way that cells tend to resume the G2 block. This phenomenon could also partially describe the stronger and persistent G2 block induced by anticancer drug treatment in cancer cells not expressing p53 and the effect of caffeine and other inhibitors that was reported to occur mainly in cells without p53 (37Suganuma M.

https://openalex.org/W2106849965,"B-cell-specific CD22 is a member of a group of cell adhesion molecules within the immunoglobulin superfamily that display binding to glycans with terminal sialic acid residues. Binding of endogenous ligands to CD22 triggers B-cell activation and proliferation. It is therefore conceivable that high affinity ligands for CD22 may be of value as inhibitors of B-cell activation in allergy and chronic inflammation. In this study, we aimed to delineate the structural requirements for ligand binding to CD22. A library of 20 mono-, di-, and trisaccharide analogs of the basic binding motif Neu5Ac(α2,6)Lac was synthesized and screened for affinity for CD22β. In general, CD22 ligand recognition appeared to be rather tolerant with respect to structural modifications of the anomeric sugar on a mono-, di-, and trisaccharide level, although affinity was increased by the presence of a nitro aromatic group at C-2. The most potent monovalent ligand, Neu5Ac-4-nitrobenzoyl-Glc, was selected to generate multivalent ligands based on either a glutamate or Tris cluster core. All multivalent ligands displayed at least a 10-fold increased affinity for CD22 compared with the corresponding monovalent glycoside. Interestingly, a maximal gain in affinity was already obtained for bivalent ligands, regardless of the terminal glycoside. A trivalent Tris-based cluster of Neu5Ac-4-nitrobenzoyl-Glc displayed a 300-fold higher affinity compared with the basic binding motif, which makes it, to our knowledge, the most potent antagonist for CD22 yet synthesized. As our in vitro fluorescence-activated cell sorting studies demonstrated efficient cellular uptake of a CD22 substrate, the most potent ligand in this study may hold promise as a homing device for immunomodulatory compounds and cytostatics."

This is degraded and the precursor sequence of aminopeptidase 1 is removed.

Most vacuolar hydrolases are transported to the vacuole through the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus.

A genetic screen based on the detection of accumulated Ape1p precursor peptide by Western blot lead to the isolation of Cvt mutants, defective in cytoplasm tovacuole transport of pApe1p (4Harding T.M.

These mutants accumulate pApe1p in small double-membrane vesicles, Cvt vesicles, similar to autophagocytic vesicles. Other genetic screens for cytoplasm to vacuole protein transport are designed to study the degradative protein transport pathways essential for yeast growth under nutrient starvation conditions. Mutants unable to survive nutrient starvation were analyzed for defects in autophagocytosis and accumulation of double-membrane vesicles (apg mutants) (5Tsukada M. Ohsumi Y.

The HSC70 proteins Ssa1p and Ssa2p are required for pApe1p transport, however, they do not control dodecamerization of pApe1p but are required for vacuolar transport of pApe1p by Cvt vesicles (18Satyanarayana C.

We developed a new genetic screen for analyzing the biogenesis pathway of aminopeptidase 1 based on the enzymatic activity of the dodecameric complex. We isolated two new mutants deficient in aminopeptidase 1 transport. Both display phenotypes, which have not been described for Cvt or Apg and Aut mutants. The mutants were termed via for vacuolar import and autophagocytosis. Mutants are defective in dodecamer formation and pApe1p accumulates in Cvt vesicles, indicating that complex assembly and transport vesicle formation are linked processes. Dodecameric pApe1p is already proteolytically active, and, therefore, packaging of pApe1p into Cvt vesicles is a pathway by which the cell can control the potentially harmful proteolytic activity by controlled assembly and compartmentalization.

Cell growth was determined by determining the optical density at 600 nm and the glucose concentration. The APE1 genomic locus, including the promotor region, was isolated from a genomic DNA library (gift of H. D.

The locus was subcloned as a 5-kbSalI fragment into the pRS centromere plasmids 313, 314, and 316. Mutations of the PEP4 gene were done with the pTS15 construct (19Ammerer G. Hunter C.P. Rothman J.H.

Cells were resuspended in 0.1 m NaPi, pH 7.4, 100 μl EMS (Merck) was added to 3-ml cells, and suspension was incubated over 30 min at 30 °C. Cells were washed three times with water, plated onto YPD plates, and incubated for 3 days at 30 °C.

For colony activity assays clones were lysed in chloroform, air dried, and covered with 0.7% agarose, 50 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.5, 3 mm EDTA, 10 mm leucine-β-naphthylamide. Activity was tested at 365 nm after incubation over 10 and 30 min at 25 °C. Fluorescence was recorded by a CCD chemiluminescence camera system (Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany), and CPY and CPS microtiter assays of mutant clones were done as described previously (20Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 77-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Clones deficient in Ape1p activity were transformed with a APE1-His plasmid after loss of the APE1-Trp plasmid present during the mutagenesis and tested again for Ape1p activity. Mutants or spores were mated with C6C or C6A for tetrad analysis. Ape1p activity assays were done as described using leucine-β-naphthylamide (overlay assay) and leucine-p-nitroaniline (spectrofluorometric assay) (Bachem) as substrates (21Trumbly R.J. Bradley G.J. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 156: 36-48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein extracts were prepared after spheroplasting the cells: cells were incubated over 20 min at room temperature in 0.1 m Tris/SO4, pH 9.4, 10 mm dithiothreitol to 1 ml/10A 600. Cells were harvested, resuspended in 1.2 m sorbitol, 50 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA to 2 ml/10 A 600. Lyticase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added to 0.125 μg/1A 600 and incubated at 30 °C over 30 min. Spheroplasts were harvested, resuspended in the appropriate buffer, and broken by vortexing the cells with 200-μl glass beads three times for 2 min with intermittent cooling on ice or lysed by osmotic lysis using deionized water (1:1) or DEAE-dextran (90 μg/100A 600) (Sigma). In all experiments a protease inhibitor mix was used: 100 μm E-64, 20 μm leupeptin, 20 μm pepstatin, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (BIOMOL). Protein concentration was estimated using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. Cell fractionation was essentially done as described by Scott et al. (13Scott S.V. Baba M. Ohsumi Y. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The equivalent of 300 A 600 of cells were used per gradient. The spheroplasting was done with Zymolyase 20T (Seikagaku Corp., Japan) at a concentration of 0.2 mg/50 A 600 of cells. The spheroplasts were lysed with DEAE-dextran at a final concentration of 60 mg/100 A 600 of cells and were pelleted at 500 × g for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in 4 ml of 10% Ficoll. Unlysed spheroplasts were pelleted at 500 ×g for 3 min, and the supernatant was transferred to a Beckmann SW-40 centrifuge tube. The resuspension was overlaid with 5 ml of 4% Ficoll and 2 ml of 200 mm sorbitol, 10 mm potassium PIPES, pH 6.8. The gradient was centrifuged at 30,000 rpm for 1 h and 30 min at 4 °C in the Beckman SW-40 rotor. The 0% Ficoll fraction, the 0/4% Ficoll interphase, and the pellet fraction were collected, trichloroacetic acid-precipitated, resuspended in Laemmli buffer, and separated by a 10% SDS-PAGE. A rabbit anti-Ape1p antisera was generated against amino acids 191–210 of Ape1p after coupling the peptide to hemocyanin. The pro-GFP expression construct was a gift of I. Sandoval and M. Martinez, and pro-GFP was detected with a mouse monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). CPY and Hex antisera were a gift of H. D. Schmidt. Protein antibody complexes were made visible by decoration with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (Dianova) and chemiluminescence (Pierce Super-Signal). Exposed x-ray films were scanned and quantified using Wincam software. Spheroplasts were prepared and lysed with DEAE-dextran as described above, but no protease inhibitors were included. The lysed material was centrifuged at 5000 × g over 5 min and lysis was analyzed by Western blot analysis of pellet and supernatant for CPY (vacuolar) and hexokinase. The lysed material was incubated at 4 °C over 30 min without adding protease, in the presence of trypsin or proteinase K (each 50 μg/ml) and in the presence of either proteinase and 0.2% Triton X-100. Incubation was terminated by adding 1 volume of 20% trichloroacetic acid/80% acetone. Processing of pApe1p was analyzed after SDS-PAGE by Western blotting. Glycerol gradients were done as described previously (10Kim J. Scott S.V. Oda M.N. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 609-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). A step-gradient was formed by equal volumes of 50, 40, 30, and 20% glycerol in 20 mm potassium PIPES, pH 6.8. 1.5 mg/400 μl of crude cell extract proteins were loaded and centrifuged in a TLS-55 rotor at 55,000 rpm over 4 h at 15 °C in a Beckman table-top ultracentrifuge. Gradient was collected in 10 fractions, and proteins were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated and separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot analysis. Ovalbumin (45 kDa), bovine serum albumin (65 kDa), and thyroglobulin (669 kDa) were used to follow separation on the gradient. Vacuoles of cells were stained of mid-log cultures in YPD. Cells were harvested and resuspended in 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 4, 1 μl of 10 mmCL2CFDA (Molecular Probes) in Me2SO was added, and the cells were incubated at 30 °C over 10 min. Cells were harvested and resuspended in 0.1 m NaPi, pH 7.5, 2% glucose and visualized using a Zeiss Axiovert 100 microscope equipped with a Plan-Neofluar 63x/1,25 and differential interference contrast. Ape1p is synthesized as a cytosolic precursor protein, pApe1p, which assembles into a homododecamer and is proteolytically matured after it reaches the vacuolar lumen. Only this dodecameric complex is enzymatically active (17Metz G. Marx R. Röhm K. Z. Naturforsch. 1977; 32c: 929-937Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We designed a screen for mutants deficient in the biogenesis pathway of Ape1p based on the enzymatic activity. The sensitivity of the detection method allowed to screen under conditions where autophagy is down-regulated. Cells were grown on filter paper soaked with rich medium (YPD), lysed with chloroform, and filters were covered with buffered 0.7% agarose containing the Ape1p substrate leucine-β-naphthylamide. Enzymatic activity was detected by the β-naphthylamide fluorescence. Yeast contains four leucineaminopeptidases (APE1–APE4). To assay Ape1p activity, a plasmid carrying the APE1 gene under the control of its endogenous promoter was transformed in a yeast strain lacking these four leucineaminopeptidase activities (21Trumbly R.J. Bradley G.J. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 156: 36-48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When this strain was transformed with one or two single-copy APE1plasmids, the difference in the copy numbers was clearly detectable by the fluorescence in the overlay assay for enzymatic activity. The overlay assay allowed us to visually detect differences of 20% of wt Ape1p activity (Fig. 1 B). This observation was verified by determination of specific Ape1p enzymatic activities in cell extracts. Isogenic strains of opposite mating types deficient in the four leucineaminopeptidases were generated by mating II-17 with SEY6211. Spores were tested for leucineaminopeptidase activities using the overlay assay and recorded with a CCD chemiluminescence camera system. Leucineaminopeptidase-deficient strains do not show any phenotype related to vacuolar function as for example growth under nitrogen limitation and sporulation. The strain C6C carrying the APE1 gene on a single-copy plasmid with tryptophan as auxotrophic marker was mutagenized by EMS treatment (Fig. 1 A). Cells were grown on rich media (YPD) plates for 2–4 days at 30 °C. Replicas were made on synthetic media (MV-D) containing all supplements except tryptophan to select for the ectopic APE1 gene. From these plates replicas were made on chromatography papers, which were placed on rich media plates (YPD) to avoid up-regulation of nonspecific autophagocytosis. After incubation of the filters overnight at 30 °C, colonies were tested for Ape1p activity. Clones showing no and severely reduced Ape1p activities were tested for the activities of the vacuolar carboxypeptidases Y and S, which reach the vacuole by the secretory pathway and which are proteolytically matured by the same vacuolar endopeptidases as is pApe1p. This allowed us to identify and exclude mutants defective in vacuole biogenesis due to mutations in the secretory pathway. Clones were transformed with a APE1 gene on a single-copy plasmid using histidine as an auxotrophic marker after they had lost the tryptophan-plasmid to identify mutants of theAPE1 gene (Table I). We did not isolate multiple alleles of the mutated genes, indicating that the screen is not saturating and that mutations in this pathway are synergistically lethal with mutations in other genes. We obtained 14 mutants, which were named via mutants forvacuolar import andautophagocytosis mutants. Three rounds of tetrad analysis of the mutants were performed using the isogenic wt strains to isolate spores whose phenotype was caused by a single mutation. We describe the analysis of two complementation groups, via10 andvia14 (Fig. 1 B). Diploids of the via10and via14 have 80% of aminopeptidase 1 activity. This could be due to a gene dosage effect and indicates related functions of the gene products.Table IStatistics of via mutant selection Mutants were isolated based on the absence of Ape1p enzymatic activity. After tetrad analysis, via14 cells did not show enzymatic activity, whereas via10 cells had 20% of the wt activity. Crude cell extracts were prepared from the strains in the presence of protease inhibitors to analyze pApe1p processing. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, and Ape1p was detected using a rabbit anti-Ape1p antiserum (Fig.2). Cells were grown at 30 °C in nutrient-rich medium (YPD) where autophagy is not active during vegetative growth. wt yeast show 10–30% pApe1p and 70–90% mApe1p under logarithmic growth conditions between A 600= 0.8–1.2 (YPD), whereas only 2% pApe1p can be detected in stationary cultures with A 600 > 2. via10accumulates 60% of Ape1p as pApe1p, whereas via14accumulates 90% as pApe1p under logarithmic growth conditions in nutrient rich medium (YPD). Under stationary growth conditions in YPD medium, pApe1p levels are reduced in via10 and invia14 and mApe1p is detected even in via14, indicating that up-regulation of autophagy by glucose starvation invia10 and via14 cells restores pApe1p transport. Expression of pApe1p is induced by the starvation conditions, as is the case for all vacuolar enzymes and proteins related to vacuolar function (26Schu P. Suárez-Rendueles P. Wolf D.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), but vacuolar transport is not comparably induced, so that pApe1p accumulates. The ratio of pApe1p to mApe1p does change, and the majority of Ape1p is present as mApe1p in stationary cultures. Cells were grown in nitrogen starvation medium (MV-N) where autophagy is up-regulated, and we tested for pApe1p (Fig. 2). In nitrogen starvation medium pApe1p transport was enhanced in both via mutants, leading to mApe1p levels in via10 comparable to wild-type and in stationary via14 cells comparable to mApe1p in logarithmically growing wt cells. Note that we loaded 10 μg of wt cell extract and 20 μg of mutant cell extracts on the gels used for Fig. 2, as can be seen on the CPY loading control. This allowed the quantitative comparison of the Ape1p signal intensities despite the differences in expression levels between wt and via mutant cells. Figs. 2 and 4 demonstrate the reduced expression levels of Ape1p in thevia mutants. This could be caused by enhanced proteolytic turnover within the vacuole due to misfolding or disturbed complex assembly. Mutation of the vacuolar endopeptidase PrA (PEP4) prevents degradation of the vacuolar autophagic bodies leading to the accumulation of pApe1p within the vacuole (22Takeshige K. Baba M. Tsuboi S. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). We mutated the PrA genePEP4 and tested for steady-state concentrations of Ape1p in YPD. We found twice as much Ape1p in wt as well as mutant extracts, so the difference between wt and mutant cells remained (not shown). Therefore, vacuolar turnover did not contribute to the lowered Ape1p levels in the mutant cells and degradation by cytoplasmic proteolytic systems should account for the reduced expression levels (Fig.3). We also tested for APE1mRNA and could not detect differences between mutants and wt cells (Ref. 28Andrei-Selmer C. Isolation and characterization of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mutants for Vacuolar Import and Autophagocytosis. Ph. D thesis. Universität Göttingen, 1999Google Scholar and data not shown). In addition, expression of Ape1p is induced in the mutant cells by starvation conditions as the vacuolar CPY, indicating normal regulation of protein expression (Fig. 2). Induction of pApe1p transport by autophagy in nitrogen starvation medium protects pApe1p from degradation in the cytoplasm (Fig.2).Figure 3A, subfractionation of pApe1p and mApe1p by 5000 × g centrifugation in a pellet (P) and supernatant (S) fractions.

Logarithmically growing cells from rich medium (YPD) were converted into spheroplasts and lysed with DEAE-dextran. Lysis of spheroplasts was controlled by centrifugation of the lysate at 5000 × g and Western blot analysis of pellet and supernatant fractions for the vacuolar carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) and cytoplasmic hexokinase (HK). mApe1p and the majority of pApe1p was found in the pellet fraction of wt cells, which is in agreement with previous results (13Scott S.V. Baba M. Ohsumi Y. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The same distribution of Ape1p proteins was found in the via10 mutant. In the via14 mutant the entire pApe1p was found in the supernatant after cell lysis (Fig.3 A). The lysed cells were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C without proteinase added, with added trypsin or proteinase K and with trypsin or proteinase K in the presence of Triton X-100. In wt cells and in the two via mutants, the same amount of pApe1p was protease-protected in the absence of detergent (Fig. 3 A). Trypsin is not able to process pApe1p from wt cells in the presence of detergent. pApe1p accumulating in via10 and via14cells is readily processed by trypsin. pApe1p in wt cells was processed by proteinase K in the presence of detergent. This indicated that pApe1p accumulates in a non-native conformation in via10 andvia14 mutants. We also tested whether endogenous proteases are able to process pApe1p under the in vitro conditions of the protease protection assay by just adding detergent and no additional protease. Strains with a deleted PrA gene (Δpep4) served as control. pApe1p processing of the wt strain was not detectable (Fig.3 B). pApe1p accumulated in via10 andvia14 was processed; however, this was not dependent on PrA activity, as expected from the Ape1p levels detected in nitrogen starvation medium and in Δpep4 stains. This demonstrates that the degradation of Ape1p in the viamutants is caused by nonvacuolar proteases. pApe1p in via14 did not cofractionate with the vacuolar CPY and, therefore, accumulates in prevacuolar vesicles. To analyze whether pApe1p in the via10 mutant accumulates in prevacuolar vesicles, organelles were fractionated on a ficoll gradient and pApe1p and mApe1p fractionation was analyzed as previously described. In wt cells vacuoles and mApe1p are found at the 0–4% Ficoll interphase, whereas Cvt vesicles and pApe1p are found in the pellet fraction (13Scott S.V. Baba M. Ohsumi Y. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). pApe1p of via10 migrated into the pellet of the ficoll gradient while mApe1p migrated to the 0–4% Ficoll interphase as in wt cells (Fig. 4 A). In the via14 mutant pApe1p accumulates in prevacuolar vesicles as in wt cells and via10, but they have a lower density than wt Cvt vesicles and are found in a 5000 ×g supernatant fraction (Fig. 3 A). We tried to pellet the via14 vesicles at 100,000 × g, but pApe1p was not protease-protected anymore after the centrifugation, indicating that these vesicles are fragile (not shown). Therefore, we spun the vesicles onto a 10% Ficoll cushion at 100,000 ×g, 4 °C, and 30 min (Fig. 4 B). 80% of pApe1p was found at the 10% Ficoll fraction, 20% were in the supernatant, and no pApe1p was found in the pellet. pApe1p in the supernatant was not protease-protected, but pApe1p in the Ficoll fraction was vesicular, although 50% of the fraction was degraded in the absence of detergent (Fig. 4 C). via14 vesicles appear to be extremely fragile (compare Figs. 3 A and 4 B), indicating that they lack essential components or that their assembly is disturbed. Enhanced cytoplasmic degradation of pApe1p and vesicular accumulation of pApe1p could be caused by a deficiency in Cvt vesicle formation. We expressed the aminopeptidase 1 propeptide fused to GFP under the control of theAPE1 promoter from a single-copy plasmid in the cell lines. The aminopeptidase 1 propeptide sequence targets the fusion protein to the vacuole, but it is rapidly degraded in the cytoplasm and the vacuole unless it is protected by the Cvt vesicle membra"

Recent structural data have supported the relationship between the two enzyme groups by revealing considerable similarities in the architecture of their catalytic pockets. In this study we show that the Int-type recombinase Flp is inhibited by the two structurally unrelated topoisomerase I-directed anti-cancer drugs, camptothecin (CPT) and NSC-314622. The interaction of these drugs with topoisomerase I is very specific with several single amino acid substitutions conferring drug resistance to the enzyme. Thus, the observed interaction of CPT and NSC-314622 with Flp, which is comparable to their interaction with the cleavage complex formed by topoisomerase I, strongly supports a close mechanistic and evolutionary relationship between the two enzymes. The results suggest that Flp and other Int family recombinases may provide model systems for dissecting the molecular mechanisms of topoisomerase I-directed anti-cancer therapeutic agents.

Biol. 1995; 51: 53-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In the first step of recombination, an active site tyrosine nucleophile attacks the target phosphodiester bond in DNA to generate a 3′-phosphotyrosyl linkage and a free 5′-hydroxyl group. In the second step leading to strand rejoining, the 5′-hydroxyl group is the nucleophile, and the 3′-phosphotyrosyl bond is its target. The nucleophilic attack is directed across partner substrates so that strand ligation occurs in the recombinant configuration, which is opposed to the typical type IB topoisomerase reaction in which ligation restores the original phosphodiester bond (3Gupta M. Fujimori A. Pommier Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1262: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). However, the two ligation modes are not mutually exclusive, as evident from the fact that some Int recombinases can relax supercoiled DNA in vitro under certain conditions while some type IB topoisomerases can mediate recombination and resolution of Holliday junctions (4Kikuchi Y.

Recent structural data have further consolidated the relationship between the Int family recombinases and the type IB topoisomerases. Despite the lack of overall sequence homology between the two enzyme groups, the tertiary folds within the catalytic domains are strikingly similar between the Int-type recombinases, including Flp (9Chen Y.

Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). CPT and its derivatives are among the most promising anti-cancer drugs available today and have long been known specifically to target topo I in human cells. Although NSC-314622 is structurally unrelated to the camptothecins, its mode of action appears to be similar to that of CPT (17Kohlhagen G. Paull K.D. Cushman M. Nagafuji P. Pommier Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Both drugs inhibit the religation step of topo I catalysis, whereas they have no effect on the cleavage reaction (16Christiansen K. Westergaard O. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

This is the first report of an enzyme other than eukaryotic topo I being sensitive toward these drugs. The results demonstrate several similarities and subtle differences between Flp and topo I in the mode of inhibition by the two drugs and suggest that the simple members of the Int family such as Flp and Cre may be exploited to dissect the molecular action of the topo I-directed anti-cancer drugs. CPT was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (C9911), and NSC-314622 was a kind gift from Dr. Yves Pommier (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Both drugs were dissolved and stored in 100% Me2SO. Wild type Flp and Flp(Y343F) were purified as described by Prasad et al. (21Prasad P.V. Young L.J. Jayaram M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 23203-23211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides for the construction of the half-sites were synthesized in an Applied Biosystems model 380A DNA synthesizer using phosphoramidite chemistry (23Caruthers M.H. Beaucage S.L. Becker C. Efcavitch J.W. Fisher E.F. Galluppi G. Goldman R. deHaseth P. Matteucci M. McBride L. et al.Gene Amplif. Anal. 1983; 3: 1-26PubMed Google Scholar) and purified as described previously (24Christiansen K. Svejstrup A.B. Andersen A.H. Westergaard O. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9690-9701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence of the half-site DNA substrate was: 5′-aagcttgcgaagttcctatacttt/3′-acgcttcaaggatatgaaagatct with the Flp binding element written in bold letters. The sequence of the ligator strand was 5′-tttctagagaataggaacttcggg. The assembly of substrates containing a 5′-radiolabeled scissile strand and a 5′-cold phosphorylated uncleaved strand was performed as described by Knudsen et al. (25Knudsen B.R. Dahlstrom K. Westergaard O. Jayaram M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 93-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To investigate the effect of CPT or NSC-314622 on DNA cleavage mediated by wild type Flp, ∼0.5 pmol of enzyme was preincubated for 5 min at room temperature in a standard Flp reaction buffer (100 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10% polyethylene glycol, 80 mm NaCl, 10 mmmercaptoethanol, and 2 mm EDTA) with or without added drugs as stated in the figure legends. Me2SO was added to a final concentration of 10% to control reactions to make them comparable with the samples containing drugs (which were applied as 10× stock solutions dissolved in 100% Me2SO). Subsequent to preincubation, DNA cleavage was initiated by the addition of 0.02 pmol of the radiolabeled half-site, and incubation was continued for 15 min at 30 °C in a 20-μl reaction volume. To assay the effect of the drug on wild type Flp-mediated DNA ligation, active cleavage complexes were generated by incubating 0.5 pmol of the enzyme with 0.02 pmol of the half-site in 20 μl of the standard reaction buffer for 30 min at 30 °C. The active cleavage complexes were pretreated with indicated concentrations of drugs for 5 min as described above. Subsequently, ligation was initiated by the addition of 0.00625 pmol of ligator strand (unless otherwise stated), and incubation was continued in a 30-μl reaction volume for another 15 min at 30 °C. All reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS (0.1% final concentration) and were treated with proteinase K (100 μg/reaction for 1 h at 37 °C) prior to ethanol precipitation. The reaction products were fractionated by electrophoresis in 12% denaturing (5% bis-acrylamide) polyacrylamide gels, and the reaction products were visualized by phosphorimaging. Studies of the drug effects on Flp(Y343F)-mediated reactions were carried out as described above except that the wild type enzyme was replaced with 0.5 pmol of Flp(Y343F) plus 30 mm tyramine. The amount of Flp-mediated cleavage and ligation was quantified on a model SF Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager by integrating the area under the curve for each radioactive band using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). The cleavage activity was calculated asC/(C + S), and the ligation activity was calculated as L/(L + C), whereC is the amount of cleavage product, S is the amount of substrate, and L is the amount of ligation product. The sensitivity of Flp toward CPT and NSC-314622 in the cleavage and ligation steps of catalysis was investigated using a synthetic DNA “half-site” substrate containing a single Flp binding sequence (Fig. 1, B andD, right panels). This substrate supports cleavage, but the concomitant ligation is prevented because of 5′-phosphorylation of the noncleaved DNA strand and release of the short oligonucleotide containing the 5′-OH end. However, ligation of the cleavage product to free 5′-OH ends can be effected by adding excess ligator DNA strands that are able to form base pair with the noncleaved strand (25Knudsen B.R. Dahlstrom K. Westergaard O. Jayaram M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 93-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The cleavage assays were performed by incubating the enzyme with a radiolabeled half-site substrate in the presence of increasing concentrations of CPT or NSC-314622 and the products analyzed by electrophoresis in denaturing polyacrylamide gels followed by phosphorimaging (an example of a gel picture is shown in Fig.1 A, inset). The extent of cleavage was determined by densitometric scanning of the reaction products and plotted as a function of the drug concentration in the reaction mixture. Both drugs inhibited the cleavage reaction (Fig. 1 A), NSC-314622 (open circles) being the more competent inhibitor causing a 50% reduction of cleavage at a concentration of 0.05 mm. In comparison, 1 mm CPT (filled circles) was required to reduce Flp-mediated cleavage by 50%. For the ligation assay, cleavage complexes generated by preincubation of Flp with the half-site substrate were incubated with a molar excess of the ligator DNA strands and increasing concentrations of the respective drug. The dose-response curves for the ligation reaction (Fig. 1 B) demonstrated an inhibition pattern similar to the one observed for cleavage. An ∼50% reduction of activity was observed in the presence of 0.05 mm NSC-314622 (open circles) or 1 mm CPT (filled circles), respectively. In comparison, topo I-mediated ligation is reduced by 50% in the presence of 1 μm CPT (26Lisby M. Krogh B.O. Boege F. Westergaard O. Knudsen B.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10815-10827Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), whereas the inhibition efficiencies of NSC-31422 on topo I and Flp appear comparable (17Kohlhagen G. Paull K.D. Cushman M. Nagafuji P. Pommier Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The observed inhibition of Flp by CPT and NSC-31466 is, to the best of our knowledge, the first example of an enzyme, other than the cellular forms of eukaryotic topo I, being affected by these drugs. This result is in good accordance with a close mechanistic and structural relationship between the two enzymes. However, Flp differs from eukaryotic topo I in one respect. Whereas topo I is drug-resistant during cleavage (data not shown and Ref. 19Hertzberg R.P. Caranfa M.J. Hecht S.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4629-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar), Flp is readily inhibited in this reaction. The inhibition is not the result of an adverse effect on Flp-DNA interaction, because gel retardation experiments showed that noncovalent DNA binding by Flp was unaffected by the presence of 1 mm CPT or NSC-314622 in the reaction mixture (data not shown). Thus, camptothecin most likely affects a precleavage Flp step subsequent to DNA binding or the cleavage chemistry itself. In this connection it is interesting to note that the topo I is active as a monomer, whereas it takes a dimer of Flp to be cleavage competent (27Chen J.W. Evans B.R. Yang S.H. Araki H. Oshima Y. Jayaram M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3757-3765Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). One Flp monomer (bound adjacent to the cleavage site) provides the RHRW tetrad to activate the scissile phosphodiester bond, and the other monomer (bound distally) donates the tyrosine nucleophile for cleavage (28Chen J.W. Lee J. Jayaram M. Cell. 1992; 69: 647-658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 29Lee J. Jayaram M. Grainge I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 784-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The sole function of the second monomer is to provide the nucleophile in the functional orientation. This monomer can be replaced by exogenously added tyramine in a Flp(Y343F)-mediated reaction (30Lee J. Jayaram M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17564-17570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cleavage by tyramine generates a 3′-phosphotyramine linkage, which serves as a substrate for DNA ligation mediated by a single Flp(Y343F) monomer. Consequently, Flp(Y343F) acts as a true monomer during both cleavage and ligation, resembling the monomeric action of eukaryotic topo I, which is highlighted by the ability of Flp(Y343F) to catalyze the relaxation of DNA supercoils in the presence of tyramine (8Xu C.J. Grainge I. Lee J. Harshey R.M. Jayaram M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 729-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To elucidate drug interaction with a single Flp monomer, we investigated the effect of CPT and NSC-314622 on the Flp(Y343F)-mediated reactions assisted by tyramine (schematically represented in Fig. 1 D, right panel). Cleavage was assayed by incubating Flp(Y343F) with the half-site substrate and 30 mm of tyramine in the presence of increasing concentrations of the drugs (Fig. 1 C). The effect of NSC-314622 (open circles) on Flp(Y343F)-mediated cleavage was comparable with the effect on the wild type Flp reaction (compare Fig. 1, panels C and A). On the other hand, CPT (filled circles) was approximately 2-fold more efficient at inhibiting Flp(Y343F) than wild type Flp (0.5 mm CPT causing a 50% reduction of tyramine-assisted cleavage). Similar inhibition patterns were observed for the Flp(Y343F)-mediated ligation reaction (Fig. 1 D). The drug concentrations for 50% reduction in activity were 0.05 and 0.5 mm for NSC-314622 and CPT, respectively. The inhibition by the drugs of Flp(Y343F)-mediated reactions argues against their action being directed to the dimeric interface between Flp monomers. More likely, CPT and NSC-314622 interfere with Flp catalysis by interacting with the pro-active site (the active site that has to acquire the tyrosine nucleophile in trans to become cleavage competent) harbored by the Flp monomer. This mode of action would agree with what has previously been established for eukaryotic topo I (31Straub T. Boesenberg C. Gekeler V. Boege F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10777-10783Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The difference between the two enzymes in drug sensitivity during cleavage may be explained by the catalytic pocket of Flp having a more open conformation than that of topo I. Such a conformation would be required to permit the entrance of the tyrosine nucleophile in trans from a second Flp monomer and could facilitate interaction with the active portion of the drug molecules. This notion is supported by the crystal structure of Flp showing that within a single monomer the active site tyrosine points away from the RHRW tetrad, leaving the catalytic pocket in an open conformation (9Chen Y. Narendra U. Iype L.E. Cox M.M. Rice P.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 885-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In an attempt to verify the suspected drug interaction with the catalytic pocket of Flp, we tested whether inhibition by CPT and NSC-314622 was competitive with the cleavage and ligation nucleophiles. For this purpose, DNA cleavage and ligation were assayed in the presence of varying concentrations of substrates (the nucleophile for transesterification) and drugs relative to each other. To vary the concentration of the cleavage nucleophile without changing enzyme concentration, we utilized tyramine-assisted cleavage mediated by Flp(Y343F) of a half-site substrate. A range of tyramine concentrations (from 5 to 70 mm) was employed in the presence of different concentrations of either CPT (from 0 to 1 mm) or NSC-314622 (from 0 to 0.1 mm). The results are depicted as Lineweaver-Burk plots in Fig.2, A and B. The mode of inhibition of ligation was investigated in a similar manner using the strand joining reaction in a cleaved half-site substrate as described above. Because the natural nucleophile during ligation is a 5′-OH end of DNA, it was possible to assay this step using the wild type enzyme. The concentrations of the ligator strand ranged from 0.005 to 1 pmol in the presence of 0–1 mm CPT or 0–0.1 mm NSC-314622. The Lineweaver-Burk plots of the data are shown in Fig. 2, C and D. The intercepts on the ordinates of the plots for both cleavage (Fig. 2, A andB) and ligation (Fig. 2, C and D) were nearly the same regardless of the concentrations of either CPT or NSC-314622. Thus, the inhibitions of cleavage and ligation were competitive in nature and could be overcome by a sufficiently high concentration of either tyramine or the ligator strand, respectively. We therefore believe that the sites of occupancy of the drugs and the incoming nucleophile (tyramine or the 5′-OH DNA end) are the same, partially overlapping or at least in close enough proximity to elicit mutual competition. Such a drug interaction mode with Flp is consistent with previously published results demonstrating that CPT inhibits topo I-mediated ligation in a competitive manner (31Straub T. Boesenberg C. Gekeler V. Boege F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10777-10783Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Moreover, the similarity in the inhibition of Flp-mediated cleavage and ligation suggests that the two reactions are catalyzed by similar active site conformations. In both instances, the pro-active site of the Flp monomer orients the phosphodiester (the DNA phosphodiester or the phosphotyrosine bond formed by strand cleavage) so that it can be targeted by the attacking nucleophile supplied in trans (the active site tyrosine or the 5′-OH from the cleaved strand). It is well documented that CPT interaction with topo I is transient and that the effect of high drug concentrations can be reversed by dilution (19Hertzberg R.P. Caranfa M.J. Hecht S.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4629-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). To further compare Flp and topo I with respect to drug interaction, we investigated whether inhibition of the Flp recombinase is also reversible upon drug dilution. Active cleavage complexes (obtained as described earlier) were split into three samples of 60 μl each and incubated for 5 min without added drug or in the presence of 2.0 mm CPT or 0.25 mm NSC-314622. At these drug concentrations DNA ligation was abolished (see Fig. 1). Each sample was then split into halves. To the first half of each sample, the ligator strand was added directly to a final concentration of 200 nm, and incubation was continued for 60 min. The other halves were diluted to a final volume of 1200 μl (drug concentrations diluted to 0.05 mm CPT or 0.006 mm NSC-314622) and then incubated with 200 nmligator strand. The ligation results are depicted by a bar chart (Fig.3). The almost complete inhibition by the drugs in the undiluted samples (Undiluted, comparewhite and gray bars withblack bar) is in contrast with the nearly complete recovery of ligation activities upon drug dilution (Diluted, compare white and gray bars with black bar). In the present study we have demonstrated that CPT and NSC-314622 inhibit Flp recombinase by blocking the active site from the incoming nucleophile for strand cleavage or ligation. The fact that two structurally distinct topo I-directed drugs also inhibit Flp recombinase argues that their interaction with Flp is unlikely to be mere coincidence. Rather, the active site of Flp may share sufficient structural similarities to that of eukaryotic topo I to be able to bind the two drugs specifically, although Flp differs from topo I regarding drug affinity. Flp is less sensitive than topo I toward CPT (26Lisby M. Krogh B.O. Boege F. Westergaard O. Knudsen B.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10815-10827Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), but the effect of NSC-314622 on the two enzymes appears comparable (17Kohlhagen G. Paull K.D. Cushman M. Nagafuji P. Pommier Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Drug interaction with topo I is very specific as revealed by several single amino acid mutations conferring drug resistance to the enzyme (32Benedetti P. Fiorani P. Capuani L. Wang J.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4343-4348PubMed Google Scholar, 33Li X.G. Haluska Jr., P. Hsiang Y.H. Bharti A. Kufe D.W. Rubin E.H. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Golder M. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16401-16407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Gupta M. Zhu C.X. Tse-Dinh Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24177-24180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The extent of structural similarities and differences between Flp and human topo I seen in recently published crystal structures is comparable with those between Flp and other members of the λ-Int recombinase family (9Chen Y. Narendra U. Iype L.E. Cox M.M. Rice P.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 885-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Redinbo M.R. Stewart L. Kuhn P. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G.

Science. 1998; 279: 1534-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Our data are consistent with the notion that at least some recombinases of the Int family, including Flp, may have evolved in parallel with the type IB topoisomerases from a common, and possibly drug-sensitive, ancestral topoisomerase."
