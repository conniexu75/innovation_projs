https://openalex.org/W2027230597,"The PSD-95/SAP90 family of proteins has recently been implicated in the organization of synaptic structure. Here, we describe the isolation of a novel Ras-GTPase activating protein, SynGAP, that interacts with the PDZ domains of PSD-95 and SAP102 in vitro and in vivo. SynGAP is selectively expressed in brain and is highly enriched at excitatory synapses, where it is present in a large macromolecular complex with PSD-95 and the NMDA receptor. SynGAP stimulates the GTPase activity of Ras, suggesting that it negatively regulates Ras activity at excitatory synapses. Ras signaling at the postsynaptic membrane may be involved in the modulation of excitatory synaptic transmission by NMDA receptors and neurotrophins. These results indicate that SynGAP may play an important role in the modulation of synaptic plasticity."

https://openalex.org/W2058610280,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome encodes 15 full-size ATP binding cassette transporters (ABC), of which PDR5, SNQ2, and YOR1 are known to be regulated by the transcription factors Pdr1p and Pdr3p (pleiotropic drug resistance). We have identified two new ABC transporter-encoding genes, PDR10 and PDR15, which were up-regulated by the PDR1-3 mutation. These genes, as well as four other ABC transporter-encoding genes, were deleted in order to study the properties of Yor1p. The PDR1-3 gain-of-function mutant was then used to overproduce Yor1p up to 10% of the total plasma membrane proteins. Overexpressed Yor1p was photolabeled by [gamma-32P]2', 3'-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)-8-azido-ATP (K0.5 = 45 microM) and inhibited by ATP (KD = 0.3 mM) in plasma membranes. Solubilization and partial purification on sucrose gradient allowed to detect significant Yor1p ATP hydrolysis activity (approximately 100 nmol of Pi.min-1.mg-1). This activity was phospholipid-dependent and sensitive to low concentrations of vanadate (I50 = 0.3 microM) and oligomycin (I50 = 8.5 microg/ml). In vivo, we observed a correlation between the amount of Yor1p in the plasma membrane and the level of resistance to oligomycin. We also demonstrated that Yor1p drives an energy-dependent, proton uncoupler-insensitive, cellular extrusion of rhodamine B. Furthermore, cells lacking both Yor1p and Pdr5p (but not Snq2p) showed increased accumulation of the fluorescent derivative of 1-myristoyl-2-[6-(NBD)aminocaproyl]phosphatidylethanolamine. Despite their different topologies, both Yor1p and Pdr5p mediated the ATP-dependent translocation of similar drugs and phospholipids across the yeast cell membrane. Both ABC transporters exhibit ATP hydrolysis in vitro, but Pdr5p ATPase activity is about 15 times higher than that of Yor1p, which may indicate mechanistic or regulatory differences between the two enzymes."

(1996) Mol. Microbiol. 20, 1221–1233). msbA is an essentialE. coli gene with high sequence similarity to mammalian Mdr proteins and certain types of bacterial ABC transporters.htrB is required for growth above 32 °C and encodes the lauroyltransferase that acts after Kdo addition during lipid A biosynthesis (Clementz, T., Bednarski, J., and Raetz, C.

By using a quantitative new 32Pi labeling technique, we demonstrate that hexa-acylated species of lipid A predominate in the outer membranes of wild type E. coli labeled for several generations at 42 °C. In contrast, in htrB mutants shifted to 42 °C for 3 h, tetra-acylated lipid A species and glycerophospholipids accumulate in the inner membrane. Extra copies of the cloned msbA gene restore the ability ofhtrB mutants to grow at 42 °C, but they do not increase the extent of lipid A acylation. However, a significant fraction of the tetra-acylated lipid A species that accumulate in htrBmutants are transported to the outer membrane in the presence of extra copies of msbA. E. coli strains in which msbA synthesis is selectively shut off at 42 °C accumulate hexa-acylated lipid A and glycerophospholipids in their inner membranes. Our results support the view that MsbA plays a role in lipid A and possibly glycerophospholipid transport. The tetra-acylated lipid A precursors that accumulate in htrB mutants may not be transported as efficiently by MsbA as are penta- or hexa-acylated lipid A species.

In most clinical isolates, the distal end of the core is further derivatized with O-antigen, a large polysaccharide made up of 1–40 distinct oligosaccharide repeats (2Raetz C.R.H.

The core-lipid A domain is made in association with the inner surface of the inner membrane (2Raetz C.R.H. Neidhardt F.C. 2nd Ed. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1.

It must therefore be flipped across the inner membrane prior to O-antigen ligation. O-antigen attachment is not required for core-lipid A transit to the outer membrane, given that LPS consisting only of Kdo2-lipid A (Fig. 2) supports the growth of E. coli (2Raetz C.R.H.

Five enzymes are required for the synthesis of the intermediate designated DS-1-P, the physiological substrate for the 4′-kinase (2Raetz C.R.H. Neidhardt F.C. 2nd Ed. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1035-1063Google Scholar). Structural genes encoding each of the indicated enzymes are in italics. The gene for the 4′-kinase has recently been identified as orfE(the downstream gene co-transcribed with msbA) (26Garrett T.A. Kadrmas J.L. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21855-21864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).orfE is now designated lpxK. Following phosphorylation by the 4′-kinase, the Kdo transferase (encoded bykdtA) adds two Kdo residues to lipid IVA to form Kdo2-lipid IVA (41Brozek K.A. Hosaka K. Robertson A.D. Raetz C.R.H. J.

The Kdo-dependent acyltransferases, HtrB and MsbB, then add laurate and myristate, respectively, to form Kdo2-lipid A (16Clementz T. Bednarski J.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol.

However, overexpression of msbA can suppress the temperature-sensitive phenotype of strains lacking htrB (21Karow M. Georgopoulos C. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and allows growth with only four acyl chains on lipid A. At 30 °C, other acyltransferases, such as Ddg (37Carty S.M. Sreekumar K. Raetz C.R.H. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1423Google Scholar) (not shown), may substitute for HtrB.

John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1979: 15-34Google Scholar) remains one of the most intriguing, unsolved problems of LPS biochemistry (Fig. 1). A possible clue to the mechanism of core-lipid A transport within the inner membrane has emerged from the recent discovery that HtrB functions as the lauroyltransferase that acts immediately after Kdo addition during lipid A biosynthesis (Fig. 2) (15Clementz T.

Cegielska A. Ziegelhoffer T. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) during a search for new E. coli heat shock genes. Two multicopy suppressors of htrB mutations (designated msbA and msbB) were also reported (20Karow M. Georgopoulos C. J.

The msbB gene displays sequence homology tohtrB (20Karow M. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 702-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 22Karow M. Georgopoulos C. Mol.

The msbA gene shows no sequence relationship to htrB (21Karow M. Georgopoulos C. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Instead, msbAencodes an ABC family transporter with high amino acid sequence similarity to mammalian Mdr proteins (21Karow M. Georgopoulos C. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). msbA is an essential gene (21Karow M. Georgopoulos C. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), whereas msbB is not (20Karow M. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 702-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 23Somerville Jr., J.E. Cassiano L. Bainbridge B. Cunningham M.D. Darveau R.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). When introduced on low copy plasmids, msbA complements most of the htrB mutant phenotypes, such as the morphological alterations, the overproduction of phospholipids, and the inability to grow above 32 °C (21Karow M. Georgopoulos C. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Polissi and Georgopoulos (24Polissi A. Georgopoulos C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 1221-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) have recently shown that MsbA is an inner membrane, ATP-binding protein, as predicted from its sequence. WhenmsbA and an essential downstream gene, orfE, are both inactivated because of an insertional mutation in msbAin a strain with a temperature-sensitive replication plasmid expressing both MsbA and OrfE, LPS accumulates in the inner membrane at 42 °C (24Polissi A. Georgopoulos C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 1221-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Similar findings have recently been reported (25McDonald M.K. Cowley S.C. Nano F.E. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7638-7643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using themsbA(valA) and orfE(valB) genes of Francisella novicida. Moreover, LPS accumulates in the inner membranes of htrB-deficient mutants (24Polissi A. Georgopoulos C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 1221-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Introduction of msbA and orfE on low copy plasmids partially restores translocation of LPS to the outer membrane at 42 °C in htrB mutants (24Polissi A. Georgopoulos C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 1221-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings suggest that the HtrB-catalyzed transfer of laurate to lipid A (Fig. 2) may be necessary for efficient core-lipid A transport and that MsbA and/or OrfE may be components of the transport machinery. Garrett et al. (26Garrett T.A. Kadrmas J.L. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21855-21864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) have recently discovered thatorfE (now designated lpxK) encodes the 4′-kinase of the lipid A pathway (53Garrett T.A.

We have therefore re-evaluated the contribution of orfE/lpxK and msbA to the suppression of thehtrB phenotype. We now show that the rescue ofhtrB mutants by overexpression of msbA is not accompanied by an increase in the extent of lipid A acylation at 42 °C. By using a quantitative new 32Pilabeling assay, we demonstrate that htrB-deficient cells accumulate tetra-acylated lipid A molecular species and glycerophospholipids within their inner membranes at 42 °C, whereasmsbA-deficient strains accumulate hexa-acylated lipid A and glycerophospholipids in their inner membranes, even when extra copies of orfE/lpxK are provided in trans. Our data strengthen the view that MsbA is involved in the transport of newly synthesized core-lipid A molecules across the inner membrane (24Polissi A. Georgopoulos C. Mol.

Microbiol. 1996; 20: 1221-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and ligating the 1.9-kilobase pair fragment derived from pGAP14 with EcoRI andHindIII-digested pUC18 vector DNA. The ability of pEH2 to direct the overexpression (∼5-fold) of the lipid A 4′-kinase was confirmed by assaying extracts of cells (26Garrett T.A. Kadrmas J.L. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21855-21864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) containing pEH2 compared with vector controls. Genomic E. coli DNA was isolated from strain W3110 according to Ausubelet al. (28Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1989Google Scholar). After the chromosomal DNA was isolated, themsbA gene was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The primer sequences used were as follows: the forward primer, 5′ GCG CTC TAT CTC GCT CAA GGC TGG CGG ATT AGC AGC CTC AGG GAG C 3′ and the reverse primer, 5′ GCG CGC ATC GAT GGC CAT ACA ACC AGG AGA GTG GCA GCA ATA GCC GCC. The PCR reaction contained 100 ng of W3110 chromosomal DNA template, 0.2 μg of each primer, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.2, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 75 mm KCl, 200 μm each dNTP, and 1 unit of Taq polymerase (Stratagene). The mixture was subjected to 5 min of denaturation at 94 °C, then 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 2 min, and ended with a 7-min extension at 72 °C in a Perkin-Elmer GeneAmp PCR system 2400. The PCR product was then ligated into the TA cloning vector and transformed into the appropriate competent cells (Invitrogen Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmid bearing colonies were selected by growth on LB agar plates containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-D-galactopyranoside at 37 °C. Plasmid was isolated from positive (white) colonies, and the presence of the insert was confirmed by digestion withHindIII and EcoRV. Due to the reported sensitivity of the MLK53 cells to the presence of the msbAon high-copy vectors (21Karow M. Georgopoulos C. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), we chose to move the insert into the low-copy vector, pACYC184 (New England Biolabs, Inc.). The TA plasmid bearing the msbA gene (pKW1) was digested withHindIII and EcoRV. The reaction was subjected to gel electrophoresis, and the insert fragment was purified using the GeneClean system (Bio 101). Simultaneously, the plasmid pACYC184 was digested with HindIII and EcoRV, phosphatase- treated, and purified as described above for the insert. The digested pACYC184 and the insert were ligated. The ligation reactions were then transformed into SureCells (Stratagene), and plasmid containing cells were selected by growth on LB agar containing 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol. The plasmid was isolated from chloramphenicol-resistant cells, and the presence of the insert was confirmed by digestion with HindIII and EcoRV. The pACYC184 containing msbA was named pKW2. The DNA sequence of the insert was confirmed by automated fluorescent sequencing at the Duke University DNA Analysis Facility, Durham, NC. The sequencing of pKW2 revealed that the plasmid contained the predicted junctions between pACYC184 (HindIII andEcoRV) and the expected TA sequence. However, the first 17 nucleotides of the forward primer, 5′ GCG CTC TAT CTC GCT CAA GGC TGG CGG ATT AGC AGC CTC AGG GAG C 3′ (shown in bold) were not present. The absence of this portion of the primer sequence did not disrupt the coding sequence of msbA, since the primer was designed to a segment of DNA 92 nucleotides upstream of the start codon of msbA. The msbA coding sequence determined for pKW2 (data not shown) exactly matched the published msbAsequence (21Karow M. Georgopoulos C. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Finally, the htrB mutant MLK53 was transformed with pKW2 at 30 °C, selecting for tetracycline and chloramphenicol resistance. MLK53 is temperature-sensitive for growth at 44 °C. When competent MLK53 cells were transformed at 30 °C with pKW2, the temperature sensitivity was suppressed in all the transformants. In other experiments, MLK53 was transformed with pKW2 and subjected immediately to selection at 44 °C. The frequency of transformants was the same as observed at 30 °C. Cells were grown and labeled using the methods described previously (19Clementz T. Zhou Z. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10353-10360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 29Galloway S.M. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6394-6402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In general, labeling of the glycerophospholipids and lipid A was achieved by dilution of overnight cultures with 125 ml of pre-warmed fresh LB broth containing appropriate antibiotics to yieldA 550 = 0.05. After addition of 4 μCi/ml32Pi, non-temperature-sensitive and wild type cells were grown at 30 or 42 °C (as indicated) untilA 550 = 0.6. All temperature-sensitive mutants were labeled for 3 h after a shift to 42 °C. At the time of harvest, their A 550 was 0.4–0.6. Inner and outer membranes were separated by isopycnic sucrose gradient centrifugation following the procedure of Guy-Caffey et al. (30Guy-Caffey J.K. Rapoza M.P. Jolley K.A. Webster R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2460-2465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with several modifications. Disruption of the lysozyme- and EDTA-treated spheroplasts was performed using a Branson sonifier (model 250) equipped with a microtip (31Osborn M.J. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 642-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Sonic disruption was performed while the sample was immersed in an ice-water bath. One-minute intervals were allowed for cooling between each 30-s period of sonic oscillation (80 watts of power output). The whole particulate fraction was isolated on a sucrose cushion and washed once. Inner and outer membranes (recovered from 125 ml of cells and containing about 2 × 106 cpm of 32P) in 1.5 ml of 10 mm Tris acetate buffer, pH 7.8, with 0.5 mm EDTA were separated on a sucrose gradient prepared by layering 0.4 ml of 60% sucrose, 0.9 ml of 55% sucrose, 2.2 ml of 50% sucrose, 2.2 ml of 45% sucrose, 2.2 ml of 40% sucrose, 2.2 ml of 35% sucrose, and 0.4 ml of 30% sucrose (30Guy-Caffey J.K. Rapoza M.P. Jolley K.A. Webster R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2460-2465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The gradient was buffered with 10 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.8, containing 0.5 mm EDTA. The separated membranes were collected in ∼0.4-ml fractions by piercing the bottom of the centrifuge tube. Radioactivity in each fraction was measured with a scintillation counter. Phospholipase A activity (an outer membrane marker) was determined as described (32Nishijima M. Nakaike S. Tamori Y. Nojima S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 73: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The reaction mixture, prepared in a 0.6-ml plastic microcentrifuge tube, contained 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5.5 μm [1-14C]dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine (∼10,000 cpm/tube), and 2 μl of membrane sample in a final volume of 10 μl. After incubation at 37 °C for 60 min, the reaction mixture was converted to a two-phase Bligh and Dyer mixture by addition of 22 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v). The lower phase was spotted onto a Silica Gel 60 high performance thin layer chromatography plate. The plate was developed in the solvent chloroform/methanol/water (65:25:4, v/v). The plate was dried and exposed overnight to a PhosphorImager screen. One unit of phospholipase A activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that generates 1 nmol of free fatty acid per min at 37 °C. NADH oxidase activity (an inner membrane marker) was measured spectrophotometrically (33Osborn M.J. Gander J.E. Parisi E. Carson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1972"
https://openalex.org/W2074330066,"We have investigated the regulation of the permeability transition pore (PTP), a cyclosporin A-sensitive channel, in rat skeletal muscle mitochondria. As is the case with mitochondria isolated from a variety of sources, skeletal muscle mitochondria can undergo a permeability transition following Ca2+uptake in the presence of Pi. We find that the PTP opening is dramatically affected by the substrates used for energization, in that much lower Ca2+ loads are required when electrons are provided to complex I rather than to complex II or IV. This increased sensitivity of PTP opening does not depend on differences in membrane potential, matrix pH, Ca2+ uptake, oxidation-reduction status of pyridine nucleotides, or production of H2O2, but is directly related to the rate of electron flow through complex I. Indeed, and with complex I substrates only, pore opening can be observed when depolarization is induced with uncoupler (increased electron flow) but not with cyanide (decreased electron flow). Consistent with pore regulation by electron flow, we find that PTP opening is inhibited by ubiquinone 0 at concentrations that partially inhibit respiration and do not depolarize the inner membrane. These data allow identification of a novel site of regulation of the PTP, suggest that complex I may be part of the pore complex, and open new perspectives for its pharmacological modulation in living cells.

The permeability transition is an in vitro increase of the inner mitochondrial membrane permeability to solutes, which is favored by Ca2+ uptake. This phenomenon is now interpreted as due to the opening of a proteinaceous but yet unidentified large conductance channel, the PTP. 1The abbreviations used are: PTP, permeability transition pore; CsA, cyclosporin A; Δψ, transmembrane electric potential difference; FCCP, carbonyl cyanidep-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone; PN, pyridine nucleotide(s); Ub0, ubiquinone 0; TMPD,N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-1,4-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride; TPMP+, triphenylmethylphosphonium; BCECF, 2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein; Mops, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid.1The abbreviations used are: PTP, permeability transition pore; CsA, cyclosporin A; Δψ, transmembrane electric potential difference; FCCP, carbonyl cyanidep-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone; PN, pyridine nucleotide(s); Ub0, ubiquinone 0; TMPD,N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-1,4-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride; TPMP+, triphenylmethylphosphonium; BCECF, 2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein; Mops, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. The PTP open-closed transitions are modulated by the transmembrane electrical potential, by matrix pH, by redox potential, by adenine nucleotides, and by Me2+. Finally, the permeability transition can be induced or inhibited by a variety of drugs (1Bernardi P. Broekemeier K.M. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Bioenerg.

Biomembr. 1996; 28: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the PTP may provide mitochondria with a fast Ca2+ release channel (4Bernardi P. Petronilli V. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1996; 28: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), and recent evidence indeed indicates that transient PTP opening in a low conductance mode (i.e. a state permeable to ions but not to larger molecules such as sucrose) may contribute to physiological Ca2+ signaling through amplification of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-dependent Ca2+release (5Ichas F. Jouaville L.S. Mazat J.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 1145-1153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). PTP opening in vitro leads to collapse of the proton-motive force, disruption of ionic homeostasis, mitochondrial swelling, and massive ATP hydrolysis by the F0F1 ATPase. This sequence of events has drawn considerable attention to the permeability transition as a potential player in the cellular pathways to cell death through at least four mechanisms, i.e. decreased levels of cellular ATP (6Imberti R.

With the long term goal of defining the role of mitochondria in the pathways to muscle cell death, we carried out a characterization of PTP regulation in isolated skeletal muscle mitochondria. Unexpectedly, we found that the Ca2+ sensitivity of the permeability transition was strongly affected by the respiratory substrate used for energization, in that PTP opening was much easier with electron donors at complex I than with electron donors at complex II or IV. This increased Ca2+ sensitivity of PTP opening did not depend on differences in proton electrochemical gradient, Ca2+ uptake rates, oxidation-reduction status of PN, or production of H2O2, but rather on the rate of electron flux through complex I. Consistently, we find that PTP opening is inhibited by Ub0. These findings suggest that complex I may be part of the PTP and open new perspectives for its pharmacological modulation in living cells. Rat skeletal muscle mitochondria were prepared according to Madsen et al. (13Madsen K. Ertbjerg P. Pedersen P.K. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Albino Wistars rats weighing 250–350 g were killed by decapitation, and the gastrocnemius muscles were rapidly excised and transferred into isolation medium (150 mm sucrose, 75 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mmKH2PO4, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.4). Muscles were minced with scissors and trimmed clean of visible fat and connective tissues. Muscle pieces were transferred to 30 ml of isolation medium supplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin and 0.2 mg·ml−1 Nagarse (Fluka, Buchs). After 1 min, muscles were homogenized using a motor-driven Plexiglas/Plexiglas potter, transferred to 120 ml of isolation medium supplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and centrifuged at 700 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was decanted and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The resulting pellet was resuspended in a medium containing 250 mmsucrose, 0.1 mm EGTA-Tris, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and centrifuged at 7,000 × g for 6 min. The final mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml of the same medium at a final protein concentration of about 20 mg·ml−1. All procedures were carried out at 0–4 °C. Rat liver mitochondria were prepared according to standard procedures. Mitochondrial oxygen consumption was measured polarographically at 25 °C using a Clark-type electrode. Measurements of membrane potential, extramitochondrial Ca2+, matrix pH, and PN oxidation-reduction status were carried out fluorimetrically with a Perkin-Elmer 650–40 spectrofluorimeter equipped with magnetic stirring and thermostatic control. Membrane potential was measured in the presence of 0.2 μm rhodamine 123 as described in Emauset al. (14Emaus R.K. Grunwald R. Lemasters J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 850: 436-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar) (excitation-emission, 503–525 nm). The resting potential was determined through parallel determinations with a TPMP+-selective electrode as described in Zoratti and Petronilli (15Zoratti M. Petronilli V. FEBS Lett. 1985; 193: 276-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The residual Donnan potential after full depolarization with FCCP was estimated to be −80 mV (in this Δψ range the electrode sensitivity is too low for a precise determination). Extramitochondrial Ca2+ concentration was measured in the presence of 1 μm Calcium Green-5N as described in Ichas et al. (5Ichas F. Jouaville L.S. Mazat J.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 1145-1153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar) (excitation-emission, 505–535 nm). Calibration of the signal was achieved by the addition of known amounts of Ca2+. Mitochondrial loading with BCECF and pH i determinations were carried out exactly as described in Bernardi et al. (16Bernardi P. Vassanelli S. Veronese P. Colonna R. Szabo I. Zoratti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2934-2939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PN oxidation-reduction status was evaluated based on endogenous NAD(P)H fluorescence (excitation-emission, 340–460 nm). Calibration of the signal was achieved by the addition of glutamate, pyruvate, and malate (levels taken as 100% reduction) or of 0.8 μm FCCP (level taken as 100% oxidation). All chemicals were of the highest purity commercially available, and cyclosporin A was a gift of Novartis (Basel, Switzerland). Since no specific characterization of the PTP in skeletal muscle mitochondria was available, the first aim of this work was to assess the basic features of the permeability transition in these mitochondria. In the experiments of Fig.1, we assessed the occurrence of PTP opening induced by Ca2+ addition as measured from the change of membrane potential of mitochondria incubated in an isotonic sucrose medium supplemented with 10 mmPi. 2Due to the low yield of mitochondria, this method was chosen for its higher sensitivity. Comparable results could be obtained in standard swelling assays based on permeabilization to sucrose, and from membrane potential measurements based on TPMP+ distribution. Addition of 100 nmol of Ca2+·mg protein−1 to mitochondria energized with glutamate, malate, and pyruvate induced a full depolarization (trace a). Identical results were obtained using different associations of complex I substrates such as glutamate plus malate, malate plus pyruvate, or 2-oxoglutarate (not shown). When the experiment was performed in the presence of 1 μm CsA, the same Ca2+ addition induced only a moderate and transient depolarization linked to Ca2+ uptake (trace b, see also Fig. 2), indicating that the full depolarization of trace a was dependent on PTP opening. Surprisingly, when mitochondria were energized with succinate in the presence of rotenone, the same amount of Ca2+ was not able to induce a permeability transition, and only the moderate and transient depolarization accompanying Ca2+ uptake could be observed (trace c, see also Fig. 2).Figure 2Ca2+ retention capacity of skeletal muscle mitochondria; effect of respiratory substrates and CsA. Experimental conditions were as in Fig. 1, except that the incubation medium was supplemented with 1 μm Calcium Green-5N while rhodamine 123 was omitted. Respiratory substrates were 5 mm glutamate-Tris, 5 mm pyruvate-Tris, and 2.5 mm malate-Tris (traces a and b), or 5 mm succinate-Tris plus 2 μm rotenone (traces c and d). In traces b andd the medium was supplemented with 1 μm CsA. Experiments were started by the addition of 0.3 mg of mitochondria (not shown). Where indicated, 10 μm Ca2+ pulses were added (arrows).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The experiments of Fig. 2 were performed in order to directly measure the Ca2+ retention capacity of skeletal muscle mitochondria with different energy sources. When energized with succinate plus rotenone (trace c), skeletal muscle mitochondria displayed a Ca2+ retention capacity which was 3–4-fold higher than that observed when they were energized with glutamate, malate, and pyruvate (trace a). It should be noted that the initial kinetics of Ca2+ accumulation was the same irrespective of the respiratory substrates used. As expected, addition of CsA increased the Ca2+ retention capacity with both complex I and II substrates (traces b and d). However, even in the presence of CsA, Ca2+ retention was higher when mitochondria were energized with succinate plus rotenone rather than with glutamate, malate, and pyruvate (compare traces b and d). These data represent a first indication that PTP opening can be induced in skeletal muscle mitochondria, and that the probability of pore opening is higher when substrates are provided to respiratory complex I rather than to respiratory complex II. To further characterize these effects, we measured the rate of oxygen consumption with different substrates. The experiments depicted in Fig.3, panel A, show that, in the presence of glutamate, malate, and pyruvate, Ca2+ addition induced a transient stimulation followed by a progressive inhibition of respiration (trace a). Respiration could not be stimulated by FCCP addition (not shown), but it could be restored by the addition of NADH, and remained fully sensitive to rotenone (trace a). When the same Ca2+ addition was made in the presence of CsA, stimulation of respiration was transient, mitochondria recovered the state 4 respiratory rate preceding Ca2+ addition, and respiration could not be stimulated by the addition of NADH, but was still inhibited by rotenone (trace b). When succinate was the substrate (panel B), the same initial Ca2+addition stimulated respiration only transiently, while higher concentrations of Ca2+ were required for uncoupling (trace d), which was largely prevented by CsA (trace e). These experiments indicate that Ca2+-induced PTP opening is accompanied by loss of matrix PN. This, in turn, causes respiratory inhibition with NAD+-dependent substrates, which can be bypassed by complex II electron donors. Note that the respiratory control ratio was about 30 with glutamate, malate, and pyruvate (trace c), and about 15 with succinate (trace f). Hence, the increased Ca2+ sensitivity with complex I substrates cannot be accounted for by a lower respiratory control. Matrix pH is an important regulator of pore opening (16Bernardi P. Vassanelli S. Veronese P. Colonna R. Szabo I. Zoratti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2934-2939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Nicolli A. Petronilli V. Bernardi P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4461-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Measurements of matrix pH using mitochondria loaded with BCECF did not reveal any difference between complex I and II substrates. Furthermore, due to the relatively high Pi concentration used in our experiments, no variations of matrix pH could be recorded during the phase of Ca2+ uptake (data not shown). To assess whether the effect of respiratory substrates depends on their oxidation, we added glutamate, malate, and succinate together. In this case all flux occurs through complex I, since succinate is not oxidized, due to the inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase of skeletal muscle mitochondria by oxaloacetate, produced here by malate oxidation (18Ernster L. Nordenbrand K. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 86-94Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, pore opening could be easily induced by the addition of 200 nmol of Ca2+·mg protein−1, indicating that the effects of complex I substrates are not inhibited by succinate as such (not shown). When rotenone is added, however, complex I is inhibited, oxaloacetate is no longer produced, and succinate oxidation can proceed. Under these conditions, the same 200 nmol·mg protein−1Ca2+ load was unable to induce pore opening despite the presence of glutamate and malate (not shown). These findings indicate that complex I substrates are not causing their inducing effects unless they are being oxidized. It has been shown that in liver mitochondria the PTP behaves like a voltage-dependent channel, in that the open probability increases at decreasing membrane potentials (19Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8834-8839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To study the voltage dependence of the PTP in skeletal muscle mitochondria, we compared the depolarization induced by increasing concentration of FCCP in the presence of CsA (i.e. with a closed PTP) to that obtained after uptake of a small Ca2+load, which was unable to open the pore per se. As shown in Fig. 4, panel A, when mitochondria were energized with malate, glutamate, and pyruvate, the FCCP-induced depolarization was much more pronounced after Ca2+ loading (open circles) than in the presence of CsA (closed squares), revealing a major contribution of the PTP to depolarization under this particular condition. Fig. 4,panel B, shows that under identical condition of Ca2+ loading, but with succinate (in the presence of rotenone) as the substrate, contribution of the pore to depolarization was much less pronounced. 3It must be stressed that PTP contribution to depolarization with succinate (plus rotenone) as the substrate became more apparent at higher Ca2+ loads, consistent with earlier reports on liver mitochondria. To determine whether the promoting effect of complex I substrates on FCCP-induced pore opening only depended on a change of the threshold voltage, or also on the rate of electron flux through complex I, we performed similar experiments where depolarization was rather achieved through inhibition of electron flow with cyanide. Fig. 4, panel C, shows that the major sensitization to PTP opening with complex I substrates disappeared in this protocol, the PTP contribution to depolarization becoming indistinguishable from that observed with succinate plus rotenone (panel D). These results underline the importance of electron flux through complex I as a major determinant of pore modulation, with an effect which can be clearly discriminated from a change in the threshold voltage for PTP opening. We next addressed the questions of whether the inducing effect of complex I substrates on pore opening could be accounted for by an overproduction of H2O2, or by differences in the oxidation-reduction levels of PN. Fig.5 shows that with complex I substrates PTP opening by Ca2+ was only slightly delayed in the presence of excess catalase (compare traces a andb), suggesting that overproduction of H2O2 is not essential for induction of PTP opening. The question of whether the effect of complex I substrates on the PTP can be accounted for by changes of the PN oxidation-reduction status was more difficult to assess. Indeed, the addition of Ca2+and/or FCCP can cause oxidation of PN only in the absence of rotenone,i.e. a condition where succinate oxidation is inhibited by oxaloacetate. We therefore chose to compare the effect of Ca2+ addition on the membrane potential and on the oxidation-reduction level of PN using complex I or IV substrates. As shown in Fig. 6, in the presence of glutamate, malate, and pyruvate, Ca2+ addition triggered pore opening (panel B, trace a) which was paralleled by the oxidation of PN (panel A, trace a), which invariably follows pore opening (20Costantini P. Chernyak B.V. Petronilli V. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6746-6751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Both depolarization and PN oxidation were indeed inhibited by CsA (panels A and B, traces b). When ascorbate and TMPD were used as the substrates, the same Ca2+ load did not open the pore despite the fact that both PN oxidation (panel A, trace c) and membrane depolarization (panel B, trace c) were deeper than those observed with complex I substrates in the presence of CsA,i.e. with a closed pore (compare traces b andc in both panels). Finally, PN oxidation and mitochondrial depolarization readily followed the addition of FCCP, irrespective of the substrate used (traces b and cin both panels). It must be stressed that with complex IV substrates flux through complex I is minimal, and rereduction of PN in trace c of Fig. 6 depends only on reverse electron flow. Indeed, in the absence of added substrates no membrane potential developed (not shown), indicating that no endogenous substrates are available for reduction of PN. Most conditions used to decrease electron flow at complex I (e.g. addition of rotenone) also lead to increased reduction of PN, and therefore do not allow discrimination between the effects of flux and of PN oxidation-reduction level on PTP opening. In an attempt to sort these events we tested the effects of the exogenous ubiquinone analogue, Ub0. Fig. 7 shows that addition of Ub0 induced a deep and sustained oxidation of PN (panel A, trace c) but did not affect the membrane potential (panel B, trace c). In the presence of Ub0 Ca2+ addition further oxidized PN (panel A, trace c) and caused a deep depolarization (panel B, trace c), but the initial levels of both PN reduction and membrane potential were regained within 5 min (panels A and B,traces c), indicating that PTP opening had been prevented. Indeed, an identical Ca2+ load in the absence of Ub0 caused full depolarization and oxidation of PN (panels A and B, traces a), which were fully sensitive to CsA (panels A and B,traces b). Note that the rate of repolarization was much slower in the presence of Ub0 than in the presence of CsA, suggesting that electron flux had been partially inhibited. The effects of Ub0 on mitochondrial oxygen consumption with complex I substrates are presented in Fig.8, which indeed shows that increasing Ub0 concentrations inhibited uncoupled but not state 4 respiration. Taken together, the experiments of Figs. 7 and 8demonstrate that Ub0 decreases electron flux through complex I and inhibits the PTP despite oxidation of PN. A major issue at this point was whether the effects of complex I substrates are specific for muscle mitochondria, or they rather underscore a general property of PTP regulation. Fig.9 shows that rat liver mitochondria incubated in the presence of 1 mm Pi easily underwent PTP opening upon the addition of 25 μmCa2+ irrespective of whether glutamate plus malate (panel A, trace a) or succinate (panel A, trace b) was the substrate. 4Note that rotenone was omitted in the experiments with succinate, so that the degree of PN oxidation was comparable irrespective of whether complex I or II substrates were being oxidized. To assess whether the Pi concentration was a factor, we increased it to 5 mm, and found PTP opening at negligible Ca2+loads. To circumvent this problem we added 2 mmMg2+ to our incubations. Under these conditions a clear effect of substrates could be detected, and the PTP opening readily followed the addition of 35 μm Ca2+ with glutamate plus malate (panel B, trace a) but not with succinate (panel B, trace b) as the substrate. Consistent with these results Ub0 inhibited PTP opening, decreased electron flux at complex I, and oxidized PN also in rat liver mitochondria (not shown, but results were identical to those depicted in Figs. 7 and 8). In this study we have shown that isolated rat skeletal muscle mitochondria can undergo a CsA-sensitive permeability transition as a result of Ca2+ accumulation. Of more general interest is the observation that the probability of PTP opening is modulated by electron flow through complex I of the respiratory chain, with an effect that can be dissociated from the oxidation-reduction state of the mitochondrial PN pool. A first question raised by our findings on the effects of complex I substrates and Ub0 in skeletal muscle mitochondria was whether these defined a tissue-specific modulation of the pore, or rather depended on specific incubation conditions. Most studies on the permeability transition have been performed in mitochondria isolated from liver, which are therefore the standard for the mechanistic aspects of modulation (see Refs. 1Bernardi P.

J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1996; 28: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar for reviews). Relative to the conditions commonly employed with liver mitochondria, in the present study we used higher Piconcentrations (10 mm) because this allowed attainment of the highest respiratory control ratios (i.e. the maximum efficiency of energy coupling), and minimized matrix pH changes following Ca2+ uptake. When the Piconcentration was 5 mm we could easily observe PTP regulation by electron flux within complex I in liver mitochondria as well, provided that Mg2+ was added (Fig. 9) in agreement with a previous report (21Vinogradov A. Scarpa A. Chance B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1972; 152: 646-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PTP inhibition by Ub0 was also detected in liver mitochondria even at lower Pi concentrations (not shown). On the other hand, we would like to stress that modulation of PTP opening by complex I substrates could still be observed in skeletal muscle at 1 mmPi (not shown), i.e. a condition where the effect was undetectable in liver mitochondria (Fig. 9). Taken together, these data suggest that (i) inhibition by Ub0 and regulation by electron transfer within complex I are general properties of the permeability transition and (ii) that quantitative differences exist reflecting the variable control strength exerted by this process on the overall probability of pore opening in different tissues and/or under different conditions. The role of the oxidation-reduction status of PN in regulation of the PTP has been recognized for many years (22Nicholls D.G. Brand M.D. Biochem. J. 1980; 188: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 23Prpic V. Bygrave F.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6193-6199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The novel contribution of the present work is the demonstration that electron transfer can independently modulate the probability of pore opening. Our results show that the relevant regulatory event(s) occur within complex I, that they are related to the rate of electron flow, and that they are independent of changes of the PN oxidation-reduction levels as such. Indeed, first, upon addition of Ca2+ (in the absence of rotenone) the PTP opens when complex I, but not complex IV substrates are being oxidized, yet PN undergo oxidation in both cases (Fig. 6). These observations demonstrate that the inducing effects of increased electron flow are site-specific and suggest regulation by a sensing element located within complex I. Second, PTP opening with complex I substrates is observed after the addition of FCCP but not of cyanide, despite identical levels of depolarization (Fig. 4). This regulatory effect is therefore distinct from that exerted by the transmembrane voltage since the latter can be observed irrespective of the respiratory substrate, of whether depolarization is induced with a H+ or a K+current, and of the presence of respiratory inhibitors (19Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8834-8839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Petronilli V. Cola C. Massari S. Colonna R. Bernardi P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 12295-12299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Thus, the PTP is directly modulated by both electron flux (the primary event of energy transduction, which leads to charge separation through H+ extrusion at the energy-conserving sites), and by the transmembrane proton electrochemical difference (the output force of substrate oxidation). Third, Ub0 inhibits Ca2+-dependent pore opening at concentrations that both cause oxidation of PNper se, and maximize Ca2+-dependent depolarization and PN oxidation during Ca2+ uptake (Fig.7). Ub0 oxidizes NADH via two different electron pathways within complex I (26Lawford H.G. Garland P.B. Biochem. J. 1972; 130: 1029-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 27Di Virgilio F. Azzone G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4106-4113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The first pathway goes from NADH to the physiological hydrophobic ubiquinone-binding site, and couples electron flux to proton extrusion in a rotenone-sensitive manner. The second pathway goes from NADH to a hydrophilic binding site (28Esposti M.D. Ngo A. Ghelli A. Benelli B. Carelli V. McLennan H. Linnane A.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 330: 395-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), is rotenone-insensitive, and is not coupled to proton translocation (26Lawford H.G. Garland P.B. Biochem. J. 1972; 130: 1029-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 27Di Virgilio F. Azzone G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4106-4113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Esposti M.D. Ngo A. Ghelli A. Benelli B. Carelli V. McLennan H. Linnane A.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 330: 395-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Thus, Ub0 may be able to oxidize NADH through the rotenone-insensitive site without increasing electron flux through the rotenone-sensitive pathway, consistent with the results of Fig. 7. The mechanism of inhibition of complex I by Ub0 remains unclear, but we note that a similar effect has been reported for Ub3 (29Landi L. Pasquali P. Cabrini L. Sechi A.M. Lenaz G. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1984; 16: 153-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Based on the triggering effect of electron flux through the rotenone-sensitive pathway, and on the inhibitory effect of Ub0 on PTP opening we suggest that endogenous ubiquinone may bind to a regulatory site (possibly the hydrophilic one) in complex I stabilizing the pore in the closed conformation. Increasing electron flux at complex I might displace ubiquinone from this binding site, increasing in turn the pore open probability. Conversely, addition of Ub0 might stabilize the pore in the closed conformation either through direct binding to this site, or through a decrease of electron flux through complex I. Irrespective of the detailed mechanism, the demonstration that the PTP can be inhibited by Ub0 is an original observation which may have far reaching implications for the pharmacological control of the pore. The idea that the oxidation-reduction status of ubiquinone indirectly modulates the PTP through changes in the rate of production of H2O2 has been put forward in several studies (30Castilho R.F. Kowaltowski A.J. Meinicke A.R. Vercesi A.E. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1995; 18: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 31Kowaltowski A.J. Castilho R.F. Vercesi A.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C141-C147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It must be stressed that this mechanism is unlikely to play a role under our experimental conditions since pore opening by complex I substrates was only marginally affected by the addition of catalase (Fig. 5). An early consequence of PTP opening in vitro is loss of PN (21Vinogradov A. Scarpa A. Chance B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1972; 152: 646-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 32Gazzotti P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1975; 67: 634-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar,33Takeyama N. Matsuo N. Tanaka T. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 719-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Although it is almost invariably assumed that PTP opening is accompanied by uncoupling, the most likely result of a permeability transition is in fact respiratory inhibition due to loss of PN. This is clearly shown in the experiments of Fig. 3, which document that uncoupling can be observed exclusively with electron donors of complex II like succinate, while the permeability transition results in a complete inhibition of respiration with complex I electron donors. The concentration of PN is significantly higher in mitochondria than in the cytosol, and the gradient of free PN between mitochondria and the cytosol in the liver of fed rats is above 14 (34Tischler M.E. Friedrichs D. Coll K. Williamson J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 184: 222-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). If a permeability transition ever occurs in vivo, we predict that it will result in respiratory inhibition because of mitochondrial PN and substrate depletion, blocking in turn the Krebs cycle and oxidative metabolism. It should be noted that respiratory inhibition following pore opening cannot be accounted for entirely by PN depletion. The maximal rate of respiration indeed remained about 50% inhibited even in the presence of millimolar concentrations of added NADH (Fig. 3). It should be mentioned that under these conditions the pore remained open, since addition of succinate plus rotenone did not repolarize mitochondria unless EGTA was also added to close the pore (not shown). This result suggests that PTP opening might also have direct consequences on electron transfer within complex I, since the inhibitory effect is not observed with succinate (Fig. 3). We cannot exclude, however, that under these particular conditions the rate-limiting step in respiration is represented by diffusion of NADH through the pore. Despite recent progress in our understanding of PTP modulation, its molecular nature has remained elusive. The findings of the present study offer a hitherto unrecognized possibility, i.e. that the pore may comprise, or be in close contact with, proteins of the mitochondrial complex I. It is striking that Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondria, which lack a classical Ca2+- and CsA-sensitive permeability transition (35Jung D.W. Bradshaw P.C. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21104-21112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) also lack complex I and possess two NADH dehydrogenases, which are insensitive to rotenone and, most importantly, do not pump protons (36de Vries S. Marres C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 895: 205-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Expression of mammalian complex I proteins in yeast may provide an answer to this unresolved question of mitochondrial pathophysiology.

https://openalex.org/W2078452348,"The synaptic protein PSD-95/SAP90 binds to and clusters a variety of membrane proteins via its two N-terminal PDZ domains. We report a novel protein, CRIPT, which is highly conserved from mammals to plants and binds selectively to the third PDZ domain (PDZ3) of PSD-95 via its C terminus. While conforming to the consensus PDZ-binding C-terminal sequence (X-S/T-X-V-COOH), residues at the -1 position and upstream of the last four amino acids of CRIPT determine its specificity for PDZ3. In heterologous cells, CRIPT causes a redistribution of PSD-95 to microtubules. In brain, CRIPT colocalizes with PSD-95 in the postsynaptic density and can be coimmunoprecipitated with PSD-95 and tubulin. These findings suggest that CRIPT may regulate PSD-95 interaction with a tubulin-based cytoskeleton in excitatory synapses."

The Clp family of ATP-dependent chaperone-linked proteases are high molecular weight complexes composed of a protease with limited peptidase and virtually no intrinsic proteolytic activity and an ATPase that activates proteolysis by binding and unfolding protein substrates (1Gottesman S.

Despite high degrees of amino acid sequence homology, Clp ATPases appear to fall into two groups, the ClpA/ClpX-like proteins that have intrinsic chaperone activity and also act as part of proteolytic complexes and the ClpB-like proteins that appear to function solely as molecular chaperones independent of proteolytic components (10Schirmer E.C.

Rev. 1992; 56: 592-621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Clp ATPases are widespread in eukaryotes and prokaryotes indicating that, at the least, the protein-remodeling activity of Clp ATPases is highly conserved (1Gottesman S. Wickner S. Jubete Y.

Cell. 1997; 91: 431-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). ClpP is representative of a family of serine proteases that is unique both in sequence and in the folding domains seen in the recently solved x-ray crystal structure (15Wang J. Hartling J.A. Flanagan J. Cell. 1997; 91: 447-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). The ClpP subfamily is highly conserved in prokaryotes and is found in plant chloroplasts as well as in mammalian cell mitochondria (16Maurizi M.R. Clark W.P. Kim S.-H. Gottesman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12546-12552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ClpQ is a member of the proteasome family (13Chuang S.-E. Burland III, V.G.P. Daniels D.L. Blattner F.R. Gene. 1993; 134: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 17Bochtler M. Ditzel L. Groll M. Huber R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6070-6074Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Proteasomes are multimeric proteases that not only form the proteolytic core of the major ATP-dependent protease in the eukaryotic cytosol but that are also found in eubacteria and in Archaea (18Lupas A. Flanagan J.M. Tamura T. Baumeister W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 399-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). ClpQ has an amino-terminal catalytically active threonine residue and a tertiary structure similar to that of the proteasomal β-subunits (17Bochtler M. Ditzel L. Groll M. Huber R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6070-6074Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, ClpQ subunits assemble into rings with only six subunits (8Kessel M. Wu W.-F. Gottesman S. Kocsis E.

Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), unlike the proteasome, which has seven subunits per ring. For both ClpP and ClpQ, the active sites are buried within an aqueous cavity formed by the joining of the two rings, and access to the active sites is limited to a narrow axial channel through the center of each ring. It has been proposed that binding of the chaperone component and cycles of ATP hydrolysis may alter the size and properties of the channel and increase substrate access (20Thompson M.W. Singh S.K. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18209-18215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Thompson M.W. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18201-18208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Clp ATPases not only carry out the energy-dependent steps in protein remodeling and degradation, but they also determine the selection of protein substrates for both activities. Proteins that bind to and are remodeled by ClpX are also degraded by the corresponding holoenzyme complexes with ClpP (5Gottesman S. Clark W.P. de Crecy-Lagard V. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22618-22626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Wojtkowiak D. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22609-22617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The same can be said for substrate selection in all three activities carried out by ClpA or ClpAP (22Wickner S. Gottesman S. Skowyra D. Hoskins J. McKenney K. Maurizi M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12218-12222Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 23Wawrzynow A. Wojtkowiak D. Marszalek J. Banecki B. Jonsen M. Graves B. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1867-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that protein binding and unfolding by Clp ATPases is an integral part of their ability to promote specific protein degradation by ClpP. The structure of the ClpAP complex as revealed by electron microscopy is consistent with protein binding and enzymatic properties of the enzyme. ClpA binds on the planar surface of each ring of ClpP, controlling access to the openings of the axial channels (24Kessel M. Maurizi M.R. Kim B. Trus B.L. Kocsis E. Singh S.K. Steven A.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Presumably, substrates must interact with ClpA and pass through or around the rings formed by the two domains of ClpA to gain access to the proteolytic active sites. We have proposed a model in which ATP-dependent protein unfolding is coupled to translocation of segments of the substrate to the interior of ClpP (11Gottesman S. Maurizi M.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 592-621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Gottesman S. Wickner S. Maurizi M.R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 815-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Because of the unequal number of subunits in the respective rings, the subunits in ClpA will not all be in the same register with those in ClpP. Progressive movement of different pairs of subunits into alignment during successive rounds of ATP hydrolysis may aid in translocation of protein substrates through the narrow channels.

Cells (6.5 g) were suspended in 26 ml of buffer D (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol and 10% (v/v) glycerol) and broken by a single pass through an ice-chilled French pressure cell (Aminco) at 20,000 psi. The crude extract was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Polyethyleneimine was added to the supernatant to a concentration of 0.1%. Precipitated material was removed by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant solution was brought to 0.1 m KCl and loaded on a 2.5 × 20-cm Q-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column equilibrated with buffer D plus 0.1 m KCl. Proteins were eluted by a 100-ml gradient from 0.1 to 0.4 m KCl, and the ClpX was detected by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. The ClpX-containing fractions, which eluted at about 0.3m KCl, were pooled, and ClpX was precipitated with 55% saturation of ammonium sulfate. The precipitated protein was collected by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and dissolved in buffer D plus 0.1 m KCl. The protein solution was clarified by centrifugation at 30,000 × gfor 10 min at 4 °C and loaded onto a size exclusion TSK 250 column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with buffer D plus 0.1 m KCl. The ClpX was further purified by chromatography on a 1 × 10 cm MonoQ (Amersham) column using a 40-ml gradient from 0.1 to 0.4 mKCl gradient in Buffer D. ClpX fractions were stored separately at 0–4 °C. ATPase activity was assayed by liberation of inorganic phosphate from ATP after incubating ClpX in 50 μl of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm ATP for 25 min at 37 °C. The inorganic phosphate was measured by the procedure described by Lanzetta et al. (26Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1810) Google Scholar), except that the Sterox was omitted from the malachite green/ammonium molybdate solution, and 16 μl of 10% Tween 20 was added to the solution after the addition of the color reagent. Assay conditions and methods for casein and the propeptide, FAPHMALVPV, degradation were published previously (27Maurizi M.R. Thompson M.W. Singh S.K. Kim S.H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 314-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Assays were performed with limiting ClpP (0.2–0.5 μg) and 2–5 μg of ClpX. For degradation of λO protein and other proteins, the substrates (5–10 μg) were incubated at 37 °C with 0.5 μg of ClpP and 4 μg of ClpX in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, with 10 mm MgCl2 and 4 mm ATP for 30–60 min. Reactions were quenched with 5% trichloroacetic acid, and the precipitated protein was dissolved in SDS-containing buffer and heated at 95 °C for 5 min before loading on 12% acrylamide, SDS gels. The protein remaining was estimated by inspection after staining with Coomassie Blue. ClpX and various complexes of ClpX were separated on a 0.3 × 20-cm Superdex 200 column in either 50 mm Tris/HCl or 50 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.5, with 0.2 m KCl and 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol with or without 10% (v/v) glycerol. Columns were run at room temperature and at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min. For stabilization of high molecular weight oligomers, samples of ClpX alone or ClpX and ClpP were mixed with 25 mmMgCl2 and 1–2 mmATPγS 2The abbreviation used is: ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). before running the column, and these ligands were included in the running buffer. A 4-μl drop of the sample at a concentration of 20 μg/ml was placed on a glow-discharged, carbon-stabilized, collodion-coated grid for 30 s. The sample droplet was blotted away, and the grid was negatively stained with several drops of 1% aqueous uranyl acetate. Specimens were viewed in a Zeiss 902 or a Phillips CM120 transmission electron microscope, and micrographs were recorded on Kodak SO-163 emulsion at a nominal magnification of 50,000. Magnification of the electron micrographs was calibrated using the 40.6-Å spacing of T4 bacteriophage tail striations (28Moody M.F. Makowski L. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 150: 217-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Selected images were digitized using a Zeiss-Phodis scanner (Carl Zeiss Inc., Colorado). Sampling corresponded to 0.42 nm/pixel. General image processing and display operations were carried out using the PIC Program (29Trus B. Kocsis E. Conway J.F. Steven A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) implemented on an Alpha Workstation (Digital Equipment Corp., Maynard MA). Particles were interactively selected from digitized fields displayed on the workstation monitor, translationally aligned, analyzed for rotational symmetry, and subjected to correlation averaging as described (30Kocsis E. Trus B.L. Cerritelli M. Cheng N. Steven A.C. Ultramicroscopy. 1995; 60: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). When ClpX was expressed under the strong T7 promoter, only 10–20% was found in the soluble portion of cell extracts, and the remainder was found in the low speed pellet. The soluble material was used for purification by the procedure outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” After the last purification step, anion exchange chromatography on MonoQ, several fractions contained ClpX that was ≥95% pure, estimated by inspection of Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels (Fig.1). These fractions were stored separately and used for the studies presented here. During purification the activity of ClpX was monitored by measuring the ATPase activity. The ATPase activity eluted from the MonoQ column coincided with the major protein band (Fig. 1), which also cross-reacted with anti-ClpX antibodies (data not shown). The ATPase activity of purified ClpX was ∼0.3 μmol/min/mg (turnover number 15 min−1), which is consistent with what was previously reported by Wawrzynow et al. (23Wawrzynow A. Wojtkowiak D. Marszalek J. Banecki B. Jonsen M. Graves B. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1867-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In the presence of MgATP and ClpP, the ClpX in our preparation promoted the degradation of purified λO protein (data not shown), which has been shown to be a specific substrate for ClpX and ClpP in vivo and in vitro (5Gottesman S. Clark W.P. de Crecy-Lagard V. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22618-22626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Wojtkowiak D. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22609-22617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but, as has been reported (6Wojtkowiak D. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22609-22617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), had virtually no activity against α-[3H]casein (see Fig. 4, below). Studies with ClpA and ClpP had shown that ClpAP could degrade a specific oligopeptide, FAPHMALVPV, at a very high rate (turnover number >10,000/oligomer) in the presence of nonhydrolyzable analogs of ATP (21Thompson M.W. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18201-18208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Degradation of this peptide required formation of the nucleotide-promoted complex of ClpA and ClpP. ClpX also activated degradation of FAPHMALVPV by ClpP (TableI). Under identical conditions with limiting ClpP, ClpX and ClpA activated cleavage of FAPHMALVPV at the same rate. Thus, ClpX induces a conformational change in ClpP comparable to that induced by ClpA, making the active sites more accessible to oligopeptides and increasing the catalytic efficiency of the proteolytic active sites. It is also interesting to note that both ClpXP and ClpAP cleaved FAPHMALVPV between the Met and the Ala, indicating that they do not influence the peptide bonds cleaved by ClpP, even though the Clp ATPases determine the proteins selected for degradation.Table IOligopeptide degradation by ClpXPAdditionActivityaActivity is expressed as peptide bonds cleaved/min/tetradecamer of ClpP.min −1ClpX<10ClpP<10ClpXP>10,000ClpAP>10,000a Activity is expressed as peptide bonds cleaved/min/tetradecamer of ClpP. Open table in a new tab In the absence of nucleotides, ClpX tended to run as a broad peak on gel filtration columns. The fastest migrating fraction had an apparent M r of ∼200,000, and smaller species were also evident (data not shown). Electron microscopy of this protein showed mostly heterogeneously sized particles with no obvious regularity (data not shown). The addition of ATPγS to ClpX produced a more uniform, higher molecular weight peak that eluted from a Superdex 200 column with an apparentM r of ∼300 ± 20 × 103(Fig. 2, dotted line). Electron micrographs of negatively stained ClpX after treatment with ATPγS showed what appeared to be ring-shaped particles in almost exclusively top or en face view (Fig.3 a). It was difficult to assess the symmetry of the molecules from direct observation of the individual images. A quantitative assessment of the symmetry was made using an algorithm developed by Kocsis et al. (30Kocsis E. Trus B.L. Cerritelli M. Cheng N. Steven A.C. Ultramicroscopy. 1995; 60: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) to detect rotational symmetries. In analyses of four independent data sets, 6-fold symmetry was very clearly detected at radii between 40 and 65 Å, and no significant scores were found for other (particularly 5- or 7-fold) symmetry (Table II). An average of 79 top views (Fig. 3 a, inset) clearly shows the 6-fold symmetric nature of ClpX. Very similar average images were obtained with three independent preparations of ClpX (e.g.Table I). A close examination of the shape of the subunits shows a symmetrical mass distribution at the outer edge of the hexamer and well toward its middle. Taken together, the molecular weight determined by gel filtration and the appearance of the protein in electron micrographs indicate that ClpX is a hexameric ring and thus resembles ClpA in its oligomeric structure.Table IIRotational analysis of ClpX particles showing 6-fold symmetryData setaScans of independent micrographs.Total number of particles analyzedSpectral ratio productbProduct, over all the particles in the data set, of the ratio of the amplitude of a given component of a particle's rotational power spectrum and the average of this component for background areas of the same micrograph (30).Number of particles selected by OMOcOMO scores images based on similarity of density distribution (37).12008.6 × 101017821004.7 × 10247631003.1 × 10218441006.2 × 10257751002.4 × 10237361005.7 × 103479a Scans of independent micrographs.b Product, over all the particles in the data set, of the ratio of the amplitude of a given component of a particle's rotational power spectrum and the average of this component for background areas of the same micrograph (30Kocsis E.

Open table in a new tab When a mixture of ClpP and ClpX was run over Superdex 200 in the presence of ATPγS, both proteins eluted together in a peak with an apparent molecular weight >600,000 (Fig. 2,solid line). In the experiment shown, the amount of ClpX protein in the complex was almost twice the amount of ClpP (estimated from the stained bands in Fig. 2) as would be expected if two hexamers of ClpX combined with a tetradecamer of ClpP. In other experiments with ClpP added in excess of ClpX, the new peak had slightly lower molecular weight and an obviously lower ratio of ClpX to ClpP (data not shown). When ClpXP complexes were examined by electron microscopy after negative staining, several different projections were observed. The most informative of these were projections composed of three or four strong parallel striations (Fig. 3 b). After selection, the respective projections were rotationally and translationally aligned and then averaged to result in the final reconstructed images (Fig.3 b, inset). The two shorter contiguous striations had the same lengths previously seen for ClpP in the ClpAP complex (24Kessel M. Maurizi M.R. Kim B. Trus B.L. Kocsis E. Singh S.K. Steven A.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The third striation, by analogy with previous images of ClpA and ClpAP, was interpreted as a side projection of a ClpX ring. The fourth striation, which flanked the central ClpP molecule, appeared to be a side projection of ClpX that had undergone some flattening or other disruption of structure. The 1:1 and 2:1 complexes with the rings of ClpX axially aligned with the ClpP rings are completely analogous to the 1:1 and 2:1 complexes of ClpA and ClpP observed in our earlier study (24Kessel M. Maurizi M.R. Kim B. Trus B.L. Kocsis E. Singh S.K. Steven A.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Similar to previous observations with ClpAP, the ring of ClpP not in contact with the ATPase (in this case ClpX) appeared to be less constrained and maintained a concave (inward) shape. The single striation of ClpX is in agreement with the presence of a single ATP binding domain and is analogous to that observed for ClpY (HslU) interacting with ClpQ (HslV) (8Kessel M. Wu W.-F. Gottesman S. Kocsis E. Steven A. Maurizi M.R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 398: 274-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 19Rohrwild M. Pfeifer G. Santarius U. Muller S.A. Huang H.C. Engel A. Baumeister W. Goldberg A.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Many of the projections observed in micrographs of ClpXP complexes were not side views but rather had ring shapes. For several reasons, we believe that a majority of these rings are top views of complexes standing on end. First, gel filtration studies have shown that when mixed in the proper proportions, very little free ClpX or ClpP remain in solution. Second, the uranyl acetate tended to form pools around the particles creating highly contrasted images and suggesting that the particles had greater height than ClpP or ClpX alone. Third, symmetry analysis of the ring-like projections gave very poor symmetry scores and do not show the 6- or 7-fold symmetry expected for separate oligomers of ClpX or ClpP, respectively. Cryoelectron micrographs made with ClpXP also showed predominantly end-on views and very few side views. The relative affinities of ClpX and ClpA for binding to ClpP were compared by a competition assay using casein degradation as a measure of ClpAP. The addition of ClpX in amounts sufficient to prevent ClpA binding to ClpP should inhibit casein degradation because ClpXP cannot degrade casein. Fig. 4 shows that the addition of increasing amounts of ClpX to assay mixtures with a fixed amount of ClpA resulted in a decrease in casein degradation by ClpP. A 3–5-fold excess of ClpX6 over ClpA6 was required to inhibit 50% of the activity measured in the absence of ClpX. The initial aliquots of ClpX produced no inhibition (or even a slight increase in casein degrading activity), suggesting that displacement of a single ClpA6 by ClpX6 was not sufficient to block casein degradation. In control experiments, when the ClpAP complex, which dissociates very slowly under assay conditions, was allowed to form before the addition of ClpX, a substantial lag in the kinetics of inhibition was observed. Thus, inhibition by ClpX was dependent on its ability to bind to ClpP and not on competition with the substrate, casein, or excessive hydrolysis of the ATP (data not shown). Thus, hexameric ClpX appears to bind ClpP with an affinity similar to that shown by hexameric ClpA. Efforts to observe the relative amounts of ClpX and ClpA bound to ClpP by electron microscopy were hampered by the tendency of complexes to stand on end on the grid. Nevertheless, these experiments did yield the novel observation of a mixed complex of ClpA and ClpX with ClpP. Fig.5 a shows a field of negatively stained particles in which projections having five striations are clearly distinguishable along with the expected ClpAP and ClpXP complexes. The particles with five striations were averaged to give the image shown in the Fig. 5 b. The dimensions of the subdomains strongly suggest that the particles are composed of a double ring of ClpP flanked on one side by the doubly striated ClpA and on the other by the single-striated ClpX. The average side views for ClpXP and ClpAP are shown in Figs. 5, c and d for comparison. These data are the first to demonstrate that a mixed ClpAPX complex can be formed and indicate that binding of ClpX or ClpA to one end of a ClpP tetradecamer does not preclude the other ATPase from binding at the other end. Whether such hybrid complexes form in vivo(for example, under circumstances in which the supply of ClpP is limiting) and their possible physiological significance remain to be determined. ATP-dependent proteases from a variety of sources and from different evolutionary families have complex, multimeric structures. Modular assemblies (as in ClpAP and ClpXP or the complex of the proteasome with either the ATP-dependent 19 S or ATP-independent 11 S activators) and alternative subunit compositions (as in the isoforms of eukaryotic proteasomes) are now among the well established features of these proteases (14Larsen C.N. Finley D. Cell. 1997; 91: 431-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 18Lupas A. Flanagan J.M. Tamura T. Baumeister W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 399-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 31Gottesman S. Maurizi M.R. Wickner S. Cell. 1997; 91: 435-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The variety of ways in which the different components can be combined allows the specificity, the activity, and the response to regulatory signals to be fine-tuned. One goal of our studies is to distinguish the structural features that underlie the activities common to all the proteases and those that reflect unique functions of particular proteases. We had shown previously that ClpA formed a complex with ClpP in which a hexameric ring of ClpA was bound to each of the two heptameric rings of ClpP (24Kessel M. Maurizi M.R. Kim B. Trus B.L. Kocsis E. Singh S.K. Steven A.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). One surprising aspect of the ClpAP complex was the symmetry mismatch between the six-membered and seven-membered rings of the two components. Although intriguing speculations regarding a function of the symmetry mismatch in allowing ratcheting or rotation of the ClpA and ClpP rings about each other during catalysis were attractive, it remained possible that this structural feature was peculiar to ClpAP. Such reservations were of heightened concern because much more was known from genetic and biochemical studies about the physiological activities of a putative complex between ClpX and ClpP, two proteins that are encoded in an operon and subject to co-regulation in vivo (5Gottesman S. Clark W.P. de Crecy-Lagard V. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22618-22626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was thus imperative to determine the oligomeric structure of ClpX and to establish the nature of the ClpX and ClpP interaction in forming the active proteolytic complex. Our results demonstrate that ClpX, like ClpA, is composed of six subunits arranged in a symmetrical ring. Like ClpA, ClpX binds tightly to ClpP only in the oligomeric state stabilized by nucleotide binding. ClpX can form 1:1 and 2:1 complexes with ClpP, and the ClpXP complexes, like ClpAP, have a symmetry mismatch between the ATPase and proteolytic components. The ability to generalize this structural feature of the ATP-dependent Clp proteases suggests that, although the details are still not understood, the symmetry mismatch must be a fundamental determinant of the mechanism of chaperone-mediated proteolysis by ClpAP and ClpXP. The competition assays (Fig. 4) indicate that the affinities of ClpA and ClpX for ClpP are within a factor of three of each other, and thus, ClpA and ClpX should compete for ClpP in vivo. Estimates of the intracellular concentrations of ClpA, ClpX, and ClpP indicate that, in exponentially growing cells on rich media, ClpA is in slight excess of ClpX, and ClpP is limiting compared with ClpA and ClpX combined.1 Thus, the distribution of ClpP between ClpA and ClpX could affect the selection of substrates under different physiological conditions. ClpA is degraded in cells with a half-life of 1 h, but the degradation appears to be autocatalytic (3Katayama Y. Gottesman S. Pumphrey J. Rudikoff S. Clark W.P. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15226-15236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is not dependent on ClpX. 3M. R. Maurizi, unpublished observations.Further studies are required to understand the relative amounts of ClpAP and ClpXP and their significance in vivo. A unique finding of this study is the formation of a mixed complex between ClpA, ClpX, and ClpP. Because so few side views were available, we were prevented from obtaining accurate quantitation of the relative numbers of the three complexes, ClpAP, ClpXP, and ClpAPX. Experiments are under way to determine the frequency with which the mixed complexes occur. It would appear, however, that there is no bias against such complexes, i.e. no negative cooperativity between ClpA and ClpX, and thus we think it highly probable that mixed complexes existin vivo as well. Activity measurements with ClpAP had suggested that 1:1 and 2:1 complexes of ClpAP had nearly the same specific activity for casein degradation, indicating that ClpA might not translocate substrates from both sides of ClpP simultaneously (32Maurizi M.R. Singh S.K. Thompson M.W. Kessel M. Ginsburg A. Biochemistry. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Whether ClpA and ClpX can activate degradation of different substrates simultaneously cannot be determined from our data. It is interesting, however, that the inhibition of ClpAP activity by ClpX appeared to be cooperative, suggesting that displacing a single ClpA failed to inhibit casein degrading activity and implying that ClpAPX has casein degrading activity comparable to that of the 1:1 and 2:1 ClpAP complexes. The 6-fold symmetry of ClpX has been observed in all micrographs of native ClpX that we have studied. In contrast, the homologous ATPase, ClpY (HslU), formed rings with 6- or 7-fold symmetry (8Kessel M. Wu W.-F. Gottesman S. Kocsis E. Steven A. Maurizi M.R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 398: 274-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 19Rohrwild M. Pfeifer G. Santarius U. Muller S.A. Huang H.C. Engel A. Baumeister W. Goldberg A.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Sequence homology apparently does not dictate that proteins will form rings with the same numbers of subunits. Another example of such structural deviation is the difference in symmetry between E. coli ClpQ (HslV) (6-fold) and the homologous β-subunits of proteasomes from Archaea and eukaryotic cells (7-fold) (14Larsen C.N. Finley D. Cell. 1997; 91: 431-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 18Lupas A. Flanagan J.M. Tamura T. Baumeister W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 399-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The circular alignment of active sites or binding sites produced by the ring-like structure appears to be the critical structural element rather than the exact number of such sites. In the case of ClpYQ, it is interesting to note that, if the predominant form of ClpY has seven subunits per ring (8Kessel M. Wu W.-F. Gottesman S. Kocsis E. Steven A. Maurizi M.R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 398: 274-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar,19Rohrwild M. Pfeifer G. Santarius U. Muller S.A. Huang H.C. Engel A. Baumeister W. Goldberg A.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), there would be an inside out (with respect to ClpAP or ClpXP) symmetry mismatch between the ATPase and the proteolytic component (ClpQ). It is not yet possible to generalize about the occurrence of symmetry mismatches in other ATP-dependent proteases. Symmetry mismatch cannot be essential, because homooligomeric proteases such as Lon and FtsH, which have the ATPase and proteolytic sites in the same polypeptide, are perforce symmetrical. The structure of the ATPases in the 26 S proteasome has not been defined, but in yeast there appears to be only six such ATPases (33Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1452) Google Scholar), which suggests at least a nonstoichiometric interaction between ATPase and proteasome subunits. A symmetry mismatch between the 11 S activator (PA28) and the 20 S proteasome may exist, although there is controversy regarding the number of subunits in the rings of PA28 (six or seven) (34Gray C.W. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 35Knowlton J.R. Johnston S.C. Whitby F.G. Realini C. Zhang Z. Rechsteiner M. Hill C.P. Nature. 1997; 390: 639-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). With the uncertainty regarding the numbers of subunits in ClpY and in the 11 S, it is reasonable to consider the possibility that some of these proteins may exist in both forms and that the degradative activities of the resulting complexes may vary. We would like to note that preliminary studies of ClpX structure using a His-tagged ClpX protein (kindly supplied by T. Baker, MIT) had shown rings with 7-fold symmetry.1 Structural or chemical perturbations may have significant effects on the assembly of Clp ATPases."

AMP activates AMPK via a number of independent mechanisms, including activation of an upstream kinase (AMPKK), which in turn phosphorylates and activates AMPK (4Hardie D.G. Carling D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar, 5Hawley S.A. Selbert M.A. Goldstein E.G. Edelman A.M. Carling D. Hardie D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27186-27191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). The effects of AMP are antagonized by high concentrations of ATP so that it appears that the kinase responds to the AMP/ATP ratio, rather than AMP itself (4Hardie D.G. Carling D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). Once activated, AMPK phosphorylates a number of enzymes involved in biosynthetic pathways causing their inactivation and preventing further ATP utilization. These findings have led to the hypothesis that the AMPK system has evolved to monitor the energy status, or fuel supply, within the cell (2Hardie D.G. Carling D. Halford N. Semin. Cell Biol. 1994; 5: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 3Hardie D.G. Cell. Signalling. 1994; 6: 813-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 4Hardie D.G. Carling D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). Molecular characterization of AMPK has revealed that it is composed of three distinct subunits: a catalytic subunit, α (molecular mass approximately 63 kDa); and two regulatory subunits, β (30 kDa) and γ (36 kDa) (6Carling D. Aguan K. Woods A. Verhoeven A.J.M. Beri R.K. Brennan C.H. Sidebottom C. Davison M.D. Scott J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11442-11448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Dyck J.R.B. Gao G.

Carling D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10282-10290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In vitro binding studies indicate that the α and β subunits and the β and γ subunits interact directly, whereas the α and γ subunits do not form a stable interaction (10Woods A. Cheung P.C.F. Smith F.C. Davison M.D. Scott J. Beri R.K. Carling D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10282-10290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The formation of the heterotrimeric complex may therefore be mediated, at least in part, by the β subunit. Proteins related to all three subunits have been identified in the SNF1 kinase complex in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is involved in the derepression of glucose-repressible genes (11Celenza J.L. Carlson M. Science. 1986; 233: 1175-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). AMPKα is 47% identical to Snf1p (we refer to the individual subunits as Snf1p, etc., and the complex as SNF1) (6Carling D. Aguan K. Woods A. Verhoeven A.J.M. Beri R.K. Brennan C.H. Sidebottom C. Davison M.D. Scott J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11442-11448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), AMPKγ is 35% identical to Snf4p (10Woods A. Cheung P.C.F. Smith F.C. Davison M.D. Scott J.

Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. J. Biol.

In addition to their primary sequence similarities, the AMPK and SNF1 complexes are functionally related since SNF1, like AMPK, phosphorylates and inactivates acetyl-CoA carboxylase (13Woods A. Munday M.R. Scott J. Yang X. Carlson M. Carling D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19509-19515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, the similarities between the two complexes extend even further as it has recently been shown that active SNF1, e.g. under glucose derepressing conditions, most likely exists as a heterotrimeric complex of Snf1p, Snf4p, and one of the Sip1p/Sip2p/Gal83p proteins (14Jiang R. Carlson M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3105-3115Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 15Jiang R. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2099-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Furthermore, analogous to AMPK, formation of the complex is mediated by one of the Sip1p/Sip2p/Gal83p family of proteins (14Jiang R. Carlson M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3105-3115Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar,15Jiang R. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2099-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). A second α isoform has been isolated recently, which was termed, somewhat unconventionally, α1 (the isoform that was first identified becoming α2) (16Stapleton D. Mitchelhill K.I. Gao G. Widmer J. Michell B.J. Teh T. House C.M. Fernandez C.S. Cox T. Witters L.A. Kemp B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 611-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). It was reported that the α1 isoform accounted for virtually all of the AMPK activity measurable in rat liver extracts and that α2 was virtually inactive (16Stapleton D. Mitchelhill K.I. Gao G. Widmer J. Michell B.J. Teh T. House C.M. Fernandez C.S. Cox T. Witters L.A. Kemp B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 611-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar), but a subsequent study has challenged this finding (17Woods A. Salt I. Scott J. Hardie D.G. Carling D. FEBS Lett. 1996; 397: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of specific isoforms from rat liver show that both α1 and α2 contribute equally to AMPK activity and expression of recombinant enzyme demonstrate that both isoforms have comparable specific activities (17Woods A. Salt I. Scott J. Hardie D.G. Carling D. FEBS Lett. 1996; 397: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The only difference that could be detected between the two isoforms was in their specificity for peptide substrates (17Woods A. Salt I. Scott J. Hardie D.G. Carling D. FEBS Lett. 1996; 397: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Although subtle, this does raise the possibility that there could be differences in the downstream targets in vivo leading to different physiological roles for α1 and α2. In an attempt to identify novel downstream targets of AMPK, we screened a two-hybrid library with AMPKα2 as bait. Here, we report the identification and characterization of a second isoform for AMPKβ, which is highly expressed in skeletal muscle. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of the two β isoforms with Sip2p and Gal83p reveal two highly conserved regions, which are predicted to interact with the α and γ subunits. The sequences of the β isoforms diverge at their N termini, suggesting that this region may play an important role in conferring isoform specificity, either by targeting to different substrates and/or intracellular locations or by responding to different stimuli. A human skeletal muscle library in pGAD10 was obtained from CLONTECH. pYTH9 used to make a fusion of AMPKα2 with the DNA-binding domain of Gal4 was a gift from Dr. Julia White, GlaxoWellcome Research Group. Yeast strain Y190 was used for the two-hybrid screening, and standard methods were used for manipulation and growth of yeast (18Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2543) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were obtained from Genosys. CCL13 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. In order to remove an internalXbaI site, AMPKα2 cDNA was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with the following oligonucleotides: AGATCGGACACTACGTG (forward primer) and CCTCATCATCGATGCTTTTAAAGTCCAGAAG (reverse primer). The amplified product was digested withClaI and BglII and ligated with AMPKα2 (ClaI/BglII). A second round of amplification was carried out on the modified AMPKα2 cDNA using the following primers: GAGCTCAGGTCGACGCCCATGGCTGAGAAGC and TCTGTCAGGAATTCAGAAAGACAGAGACCG. The product was digested with SalI and EcoRI (restriction sites shown underlined in the primers) and cloned into theSalI-EcoRI sites of plasmid pYTH9 to yield pYTH9α2. For mammalian cell expression, AMPK subunit cDNAs were cloned into pCDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen). Plasmid DNA was prepared using a QIAGEN maxiprep kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The vector pYTH9α2 was linearized with XbaI and integrated into the genome of yeast strain Y190. Competent cells were transformed with a human skeletal muscle library in pGAD10 and plated on selective medium lacking histidine, leucine, and tryptophan. After incubation for 10 days at 30 °C, filter lifts of the colonies were taken using Whatman No. 3MM paper and replicated onto fresh plates before being permeabilized by immersing twice in liquid nitrogen for 5 s. Filters were incubated with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl β-d-galactoside at room temperature for 1 h, and positive clones were identified by the appearance of blue colonies. The position of the positive colonies was marked on the replica plates, and these were incubated overnight at 30 °C. Positive clones were individually transferred to plates lacking leucine and tryptophan in order to isolate single colonies. Where appropriate, plasmid DNA was extracted from 1.5-ml yeast cultures and used to transform Escherichia coli. cDNA inserts in pGAD10 were amplified from yeast extracts by PCR using primers GADF1 (GATAAGATACCCCACCAAACCC) and GADR1 (CTTGCGGGGTTTTTCAGTATCTACG) flanking the cloning sites. Following an extended hot start of 10 min at 95 °C, 35 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 56 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min were used. Products were analyzed by electrophoresis either before or after digestion with either RsaI,Sau3A, and HaeIII. Clones were grouped according to their restriction digest pattern, and two separate clones from each group were isolated from the original yeast colonies and transformed into E. coli. The inserts were sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method (19Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52678) Google Scholar) using Sequenase (version 2.0 from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The nucleotide sequence of rat AMPKβ (10Woods A. Cheung P.C.F. Smith F.C. Davison M.D. Scott J. Beri R.K. Carling D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10282-10290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) was used to search the dbEST (Expressed Sequence Tag) data base using the BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) program. Two clones (accession numbers H06094 and R20494) were obtained from the IMAGE consortium. Plasmid DNA from the clones was prepared and the inserts sequenced. A human multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH) was probed with either random-primed human AMPKβ1 cDNA or AMPKβ2 cDNA. Following hybridization the blots were washed with 2 × SSC, 0.5% SDS at room temperature for 1 h, followed by 0.2 × SSC, 0.5% SDS at 60 °C for 2 × 1 h, and autoradiographed for 1–5 days at −70 °C. Peptides based on the amino acid sequence of rat AMPKβ1 (residues 20–33, PRRDSSGGTKDGDR) and human AMPKβ2 (residues 44–57, SVFSLPDSKLPGDK) were synthesized and coupled to keyhole-limpet hemocyanin via a cysteine residue added at the N terminus of the peptide. The conjugated peptides were used to immunize sheep (AMPKβ1-specific peptide) or rabbits (AMPKβ2-specific peptide). In some cases, antibodies were affinity-purified from serum using the appropriate peptide conjugated to thiol-Sepharose (20Duggan M.J. Stephenson A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3831-3835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Affinity-purified isoform-specific antibodies were bound to either protein A-Sepharose (rabbit antibodies) or protein G-Sepharose (sheep antibodies) and used to immunoprecipitate AMPK from rat tissue extracts. For comparison of AMPK in liver and skeletal muscle, AMPK was partially purified by chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose (21Carling D. Clarke P.R. Zammit V.A. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). A mouse monoclonal antibody (clone 9E10; Ref. 22Evans G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2167) Google Scholar) was bound to protein A-Sepharose and used to immunoprecipitate AMPK (in which both the α1 and α2 subunits have the myc peptide EQKLISEEDL added at the N terminus) from transiently transfected CCL13 cells. Extracts were precleared by incubation with rabbit preimmune serum bound to protein A-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C and then incubated with an excess of the appropriate antibody for 2–16 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected by centrifugation at 6000 ×g for 5 min, washed extensively with buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100), and then analyzed for AMPK activity and by Western blotting. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked by incubation in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5m NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20, 5% low fat milk powder overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was then incubated with primary antibody in the same buffer for 2–4 h at room temperature. After extensive washing with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20, the membrane was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with either protein A conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (for primary antibodies raised in rabbits) or protein G conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (for sheep antibodies). After further extensive washing, the membrane was developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (Boehringer Mannheim). cDNAs encoding AMPKβ isoforms were constructed in pCDNA3 (Invitrogen). RNA transcripts were synthesized using T7 polymerase and translated in reticulocyte lysates using a coupled transcription/translation system (TNT system, Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine. Total labeled products of translation were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. For mammalian expression all AMPK cDNAs were constructed in pCDNA3. cDNAs encoding α1 and α2 were constructed with a sequence encoding a 10-amino acid epitope tag derived from c-Myc (EQKLISEEDL; Ref. 22Evans G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2167) Google Scholar) immediately following the initiating methionine. CCL13 cells were transfected with plasmid (10 μg of each plasmid) by calcium phosphate precipitation (23Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4821) Google Scholar). The precipitate was incubated with the cells overnight, followed by a 2-min incubation with phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide. Cells were harvested 60 h after transfection and lysed in buffer A. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation and the supernatant analyzed by Western blotting or used for immunoprecipitation using anti-AMPK antibodies or an anti-Myc antibody (22Evans G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2167) Google Scholar). Activity was measured by phosphorylation of the SAMS peptide as described previously (24Davies S.P. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). In order to identify proteins interacting with the catalytic subunit of AMPK, we screened a human skeletal muscle two-hybrid library with AMPKα2 as bait. A total of 2.3 million clones were screened, and 136 positive clones were identified by blue/white selection from the lacZ reporter gene. Grouping of the clones by restriction digest mapping and partial sequencing of the cDNA inserts revealed that 50 clones, which we designate AMPKβ2, shared considerable sequence identity with the cDNA encoding the rat AMPKβ1 subunit. A representative clone was sequenced in its entirety, and the nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences are shown in Fig. 1 A. The nucleotide sequence of β2 is 66.7% identical to rat β1, whereas the predicted amino acid sequence is 70.6% identical to the rat sequence (10Woods A. Cheung P.C.F. Smith F.C. Davison M.D. Scott J. Beri R.K. Carling D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10282-10290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In order to determine whether the cDNA we had isolated was the human homologue of rat β1, we searched the human EST data base with the rat β1 and human β2 sequences. A number of clones were identified with sequences, which, although highly related to rat β1, did not match β2. Two of these clones (with accession numbers H06094 and R20494) encoded the sequence corresponding to the N-terminal region of rat β1 (including the initiating methionine) and were obtained from the IMAGE consortium through the UK Human Genome Mapping Resource Center, Cambridge. Sequence analysis of these clones revealed that they were identical, except that clone H06094 had a 343-base pair deletion compared with clone R20494 (see Fig.1 B). The nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequence of clone R20494, which we designate human β1, is shown in Fig.1 B. At the nucleotide level, human β1 is 89% identical to rat β1 (97% amino acid sequence identity) and 66% identical to human β2. These results indicate that clone R20494 is the human homologue of rat β1 and that β2, therefore, is a novel β subunit isoform. The predicted amino acid sequences of human β1 and β2 are 71% identical and are shown aligned in Fig.2 A. The two sequences are most divergent in the region spanning the N-terminal 75 amino acids (40% identity), although a predicted N-myristoylation signal is conserved in both isoforms (25Johnson R.D. Bhatnagar R.S. Knoll L.J. Gordon J.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 869-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), while the remaining C-terminal sequence is highly conserved. We have previously shown that rat β1 shares sequence identity with a family of yeast proteins that interact with Snf1p, the yeast homologue of AMPKα (10Woods A. Cheung P.C.F. Smith F.C. Davison M.D. Scott J. Beri R.K. Carling D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10282-10290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 Bshows the amino acid sequence alignment of the conserved regions of two members of this family (Sip2p and Gal83p) with human β1 and β2. Two regions that show a strong degree of sequence conservation between all four proteins can be identified, corresponding to amino acid residues 79–155 and 203–270 in β1. Poly(A)-rich RNA isolated from a number of human tissues was probed with cDNA encoding β1 or β2 and the results are shown in Fig.3. β1 mRNA is detected as a single band of approximately 3 kilobase pairs and is expressed in all tissues examined at approximately equal levels. A single band of approximately 7.5 kilobase pairs is detected with the β2 probe, although in this case there is clearly a difference in the pattern of expression. Relatively high levels of expression are detected in skeletal and cardiac muscle with low levels in the kidney and lung. Antibodies were raised against specific peptide sequences derived from either β1 or β2 and used to determine protein expression in a number of rat tissues. Preliminary experiments revealed that it was not possible to detect the subunits directly by Western blotting of tissue lysates (data not shown), and so tissue homogenates were first immunoprecipitated using the antibodies bound to protein A- or protein G-Sepharose and then the immune complexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting. Fig.4 A shows the expression pattern of the two β isoforms. The very prominent band migrating at approximately 56 kDa, detected in both blots, is due to a strong cross-reaction of the IgG heavy chains, present from the immunoprecipitation, with the protein A/G-conjugated horseradish peroxidase used for detection of the blotting antibody. In each case, however, an additional band specific for the β isoform, migrating ahead of the IgG band, can be detected. β1 expression is highest in the liver and brain with low level expression in kidney and skeletal muscle, whereas β2 is most highly expressed in skeletal muscle with low level expression in kidney, liver, and lung. At the present time, we cannot explain why β2 appears as a distinct doublet in lung. Although the predicted molecular mass of each isoform is 30 kDa, both β1 and β2 migrate anomalously on SDS-PAGE. β1, as we have reported previously, migrates with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 38 kDa (10Woods A. Cheung P.C.F. Smith F.C. Davison M.D. Scott J. Beri R.K. Carling D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10282-10290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), whereas β2 migrates with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 34 kDa (Fig. 4 A). In vitro translation of β1 and β2 in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system results in a similar discrepancy in the migration of the isoforms on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4 B). We have not been able to determine the reason for the anomalous migration of the β isoforms on SDS-PAGE. It is clear from the Western blots that there is a marked difference in the relative expression of β1 and β2 in the liver compared with skeletal muscle. In order to investigate this difference in more detail, AMPK was partially purified from either rat liver or skeletal muscle by ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose (21Carling D. Clarke P.R. Zammit V.A. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) and immunoprecipitated using β1- or β2-specific antibodies. AMPK activity in the immune complexes was determined and is shown in Fig.4 C. AMPK activity is present in the immune complex following immunoprecipitation of liver or skeletal muscle extracts with either β1- or β2-specific antibodies. In liver, however, much higher activity is recovered with the β1-specific antibody, and in order to obtain a linear rate of phosphorylation it was necessary to use a 50-fold lower amount of liver extract when immunoprecipitating with β1 compared with β2. Despite using a lower amount of starting material, AMPK activity in the β1 immune complex is still greater than in the β2 complex (Fig. 4 C), suggesting that nearly all the activity in liver is associated with the β1 isoform. In contrast, immunoprecipitation from a skeletal muscle extract with either β1 or β2 yields approximately equal activities. Following determination of AMPK activity, the immune complexes were analyzed by Western blotting using α1- or α2-specific antibodies. Both β isoforms form complexes with α1 and α2 in liver and skeletal muscle (Fig. 4 D). Although the blots are not quantitative, it is possible to draw some general conclusions from them regarding the relative amounts of the different AMPK complexes present in the two tissues. In liver the β1 complexes (both α1β1γ and α2β1γ) are more abundant than the β2 complexes (compare lanes 1and 3 in Fig. 4 D), consistent with the finding that most of the AMPK activity can be immunoprecipitated with β1-specific antibodies. In skeletal muscle the reverse is true, with the β2 complexes being more abundant than the β1 complexes (comparelanes 2 and 4). In this case, however, AMPK activity following immunoprecipitation with either β1 or β2 is approximately the same, although significantly lower than the corresponding activities from liver (Fig. 4 C). cDNAs encoding α1/β1/γ1, α1/β2/γ1, α2/β1/γ1, or α2/β2/γ1 were co-transfected into CCL13 cells. AMPK was immunoprecipitated from transfected cells with an anti-Myc antibody (a Myc epitope tag is present on both α1 and α2) and kinase activity in the immune complexes determined. No significant differences in AMPK activity between β1-containing complexes compared with β2-containing complexes were detected (Fig.5 A). As has been reported previously, complexes containing α1 were expressed at higher levels than those containing α2 and yield correspondingly higher activities (7Dyck J.R.B. Gao G. Widmer J. Stapleton D. Fernandez C.S. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17798-17803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The immune complexes were analyzed by Western blotting using an antibody that recognizes both β isoforms (10Woods A. Cheung P.C.F. Smith F.C. Davison M.D. Scott J. Beri R.K. Carling D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10282-10290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5 B). Transfections with β1 yield a single band migrating with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 38 kDa, whereas transfections with β2 reveal a single band migrating with an apparent molecular mass of 34 kDa. No products could be detected in untransfected cells. There is no significant difference in the Western blots from immunoprecipitates of α1- or α2-transfected cells, indicating that β1 and β2 can form complexes with either α1 or α2, consistent with the results from liver and skeletal muscle. As we have reported previously, co-transfection of α, β, and γ is required in order to detect expression of recombinant protein or activity in this system (10Woods A. Cheung P.C.F. Smith F.C.

We have purified rat kidney sphingosine kinase 6 × 105-fold to apparent homogeneity. The purification procedure involved ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by chromatography on an anion exchange column. Partially purified sphingosine kinase was found to be stabilized by the presence of high salt, and thus, a scheme was developed to purify sphingosine kinase using sequential dye-ligand chromatography steps (since the enzyme bound to these matrices even in the presence of salt) followed by EAH-Sepharose chromatography. This 385-fold purified sphingosine kinase bound tightly to calmodulin-Sepharose and could be eluted in high yield with EGTA in the presence of 1 m NaCl. After concentration, the calmodulin eluate was further purified by successive high pressure liquid chromatography separations on hydroxylapatite, Mono Q, and Superdex 75 gel filtration columns. Purified sphingosine kinase has an apparent molecular mass of ∼49 kDa under denaturing conditions on SDS-polyacrylamide gel, which is similar to the molecular mass determined by gel filtration, suggesting that the active form is a monomer. Sphingosine kinase shows substrate specificity ford-erythro-sphingosine and does not catalyze the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol, diacylglycerol, ceramide,dl-threo-dihydrosphingosine, orN,N-dimethylsphingosine. However, the latter two sphingolipids were potent competitive inhibitors. With sphingosine as substrate, the enzyme had a broad pH optimum of 6.6–7.5 and showed Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with K m values of 5 and 93 μm for sphingosine and ATP, respectively. This study provides the basis for molecular characterization of a key enzyme in sphingolipid signaling.

To test this hypothesis, we altered the GSSG:GSH ratio in retinal pigment epithelial cells with the thiol-specific oxidant, diamide, and assessed activities of the UPP. Treatment of cells with diamide resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the GSSG:GSH ratio resulting from loss of GSH and a coincident increase in GSSG. Increases in the GSSG:GSH ratio from 0.02 in untreated cells to ≥0.5 in diamide-treated cells were accompanied by dose-dependent reductions in the levels of endogenous Ub-protein conjugates, endogenous E1∼ubiquitin thiol esters, and de novo ubiquitin-conjugating activity. As determined by the ability to form E1-ubiquitin and E2s-ubiquitin thiol esters, E1 and E2s were both inhibited by elevated GSSG:GSH ratios. Inhibition of E1 was associated with the formation of E1-protein mixed disulfides. Activities of E1 and E2s gradually recovered to preoxidation levels, coincident with gradual recovery of the GSSG:GSH ratio. These data support S-thiolation/dethiolation as a mechanism regulating E1 and E2 activities in response to oxidant insult. Ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic capacity was regulated by the GSSG:GSH ratio in a manner consistent with altered ubiquitin-conjugating activity. However, ubiquitin-independent proteolysis was unaffected by changes in the GSSG:GSH ratio. Potential adaptive and pathological consequences of redox regulation of UPP activities are discussed."

Many of these hemoglobins are twodomain proteins that possess a flavin-containing reductase in their C terminus. Determination of a function for these flavohemoglobins has been elusive. ASalmonella typhimurium strain harboring a deletion in the flavohemoglobin gene shows no difference in growth under oxidative stress conditions but displays an increased sensitivity to acidified nitrite and S-nitrosothiols, both of which produce nitric oxide. The effect is seen aerobically or anaerobically, indicating that oxygen is not required for flavohemoglobin function. These results suggest a role for the bacterial flavohemoglobins that is independent of oxygen metabolism and provide evidence for a bacterial route of protection from nitric oxide that is distinct from oxidative stress responses.

Hemoglobins are a superfamily of ancient, oxygen-binding hemoproteins with remarkable three-dimensional similarity despite the drifting of primary amino acid sequence during evolution (1Arutyunyan E.G. Mol. Biol. 1981; 15: 27-44PubMed Google Scholar). Classic biochemical, structural, and genetic studies have established the intravascular hemoglobin tetramer and the intramuscular hemoglobin monomer (myoglobin) as the primary facilitators of mammalian oxygen delivery (2Dickerson R.E. Geis I. Hemoglobin: Structure, Function, Evolution, and Pathology. Benjamin/Cummings, Menlo Park, CA1983Google Scholar). Hemoglobins have also been isolated from a diverse array of invertebrate animals, plants, protozoa, fungi, and bacteria (3Hardison R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5675-5679Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 4Moens L. Vanfleteren J. Van de Peer Y. Peeters K. Kapp O. Czeluzniak J. Goodman M. Blaxter M. Vinogradov S. Mol. Biol.

The role of globins in nonmammalian organisms is largely speculative, often because of their intractability to genetic manipulation. The discovery of hemoglobins in microorganisms has broadened the experimental approaches available to include globin gene expression and deletion studies. Logically, the initial assessments of hemoglobins found in microorganisms have emphasized the diffusion and metabolism of oxygen. Transcription of the hemoglobin from the aerobic bacteriumVitreoscilla is elevated under oxygen-limiting conditions (6Dikshit K.L. Dikshit R.P. Webster D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4149-4155Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 7Khosla C. Bailey J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 5990-6004Crossref Google Scholar). Heterologous overexpression of the Vitreoscillaglobin allows growth to higher cell densities in Escherichia coli and nearly doubles the growth rate of transgenic tobacco, suggesting an ability to increase the availability of intracellular oxygen (8Khosla C. Bailey J.E. Nature. 1988; 331: 633-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 9Holmberg N. Lilius G. Bailey J.E. Bulow L. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 244-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Overexpression of the Vitreoscilla hemoglobin can also rescue E. coli terminal oxidase mutants, indicating that this protein can not only deliver molecular oxygen but also participate in productive electron transport (10Dikshit R.P. Dikshit K.L. Liu Y. Webster D.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 293: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Members of an emerging family of two-domain hemoglobins (flavohemoglobins) from other microorganisms share substantial sequence identity to the single-domainVitreoscilla globin in their N termini and exhibit homology to flavoprotein oxidoreductases in their C termini. Spectroscopic studies on the purified flavohemoglobin native to E. coli(designated hmp 1The abbreviations used are: hmp, flavohemoglobin; GSNO, S-nitrosylated glutathione; SNAC,S-nitrosylated N-acetylcysteine; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s); WT, wild type.1The abbreviations used are: hmp, flavohemoglobin; GSNO, S-nitrosylated glutathione; SNAC,S-nitrosylated N-acetylcysteine; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s); WT, wild type.) indicate that the redox state of the flavin moiety in the reductase domain is influenced by oxygen availability in the heme pocket. Therefore, hmp has been postulated to be a sensor, with oxygen-regulated modulation of reductase activity toward undefined substrate(s) in vivo(11Poole R.K. Ioannidis N. Orii Y. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1994; 255: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Gene expression of many flavohemoglobins is regulated by changes in oxygen concentration, being induced by microaerobic or anaerobic conditions in the bacteria Alcaligenes eutrophus andBacillus subtilis (12Probst I.

A sensitivity to certain oxidative stress conditions has been reported for a S. cerevisiae flavohemoglobin deletion strain lacking functional mitochondria (15Zhao X.-J. Raitt D. Burke P.V. Clewell A.S. Kwast K.E. Poyton R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25131-25138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The superoxide generator paraquat (methyl viologen) stimulates E. coli hmp promoter activity, but sensitivity of a flavohemoglobin deletion strain to superoxide was not reported (16Membrillo-Hernandez J. Kim S.O. Cook G.M. Poole R.K. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3164-3170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Clues to a role in the metabolism of nitrogen oxides have come from other flavohemoglobin genetic studies. A strain with a disrupted flavohemoglobin gene in the strictly respiring bacterium A. eutrophus does not accumulate nitrous oxide as a transient intermediate during denitrification. Surprisingly, growth under denitrification conditions is normal, and generation of the pathway end product, dinitrogen, is not diminished (17Cramm R. Siddiqui R.A. Friedrich B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7349-7354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of nitrogen oxides, both the B. subtilis and E. coliflavohemoglobin promoters fused to a lacZ reporter show induced β-galactosidase activity (13LaCelle M. Kumano M. Kurita K. Yamane K. Zuber P. Nakano M.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3803-3808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Poole R.K. Anjum M.F. Membrillo-Hernandez J. Kim S.O. Hughes M.N. Stewart V. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5487-5492Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Correlates exist between transcriptional activation by oxidative stresses and nitric oxide. The SoxRS and OxyR transcription factors, known to respond to superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, are also activated by NO in E. coli, with soxRS and oxyR mutants displaying an increased sensitivity to NO from macrophages and to the NO-donatingS-nitrosothiols, respectively (19Nunoshiba T.

DeAngelo J. Stamler J.S. Cell. 1996; 86: 719-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The microbiostatic action of NO and NO-producing derivatives may result from NO modification of protein thiols, analogous to the oxidation of thiols caused by oxygen-mediated damage (20Hausladen A. Privalle C.T. Keng T. DeAngelo J. Stamler J.S. Cell. 1996; 86: 719-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Factors involved in the nitrogen oxide induction of the hmp gene in E. coli are unknown but are independent of the SoxRS system (18Poole R.K. Anjum M.F. Membrillo-Hernandez J. Kim S.O. Hughes M.N. Stewart V. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5487-5492Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). We now report a role for the Salmonella hmp in specific protection from nitric oxide that is independent of oxygen and its metabolites. All PCR reactions used Klentaq/LA (W. Barnes, Washington University, St. Louis, MO). Using the RN1 primer (5′-GATCGAATTCATGCTTGACGCACAAACCAT-3′) from the published upstream S. typhimurium glyA sequence (21Steiert J.G. Urbanowski M.L. Stauffer L.T. Plamann M.D. Stauffer G.V. J. DNA Seq. Mapp. 1990; 1: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and a degenerate primer RN4 (5′-GATCGGATCCNAGNAC(C/T)TT(A/G)TGNGGNCC(A/G)AA(A/G)CA(C/T)TC(A/G)TA-3′) based on the C terminus of the E. coli hmp (22Vasudevan S.G. Armarego W.L.F. Shaw D.C. Lilley P.E. Dixon N.E. Poole R.K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 226: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), theS. typhimurium hmp gene was amplified by PCR from ATCCS. typhimurium strain 14028s genomic DNA. The product was cloned into the TA cloning vector (Invitrogen) and found to contain an open reading frame homologous to other hmp genes. For creation of an hmp insertion/deletion construct, PCR products were generated using SKO1/SKO2 primers for hmpupstream/5′ sequence and SKO3/SK04 primers to hmp 3′ sequence. The sequences of the knockout primers are as follows: SKO1, 5′-GATCGAATTCTTTTACGCAAACGATTACCTA-3′; SKO2, 5′-GATCCCGGGTAGAAGTGGGCGGTCAG-3′; SKO3, 5′-GATCGGATCCTTACAGGACCTTATGCGGACC-3′; SKO4, 5′-GATCCCGGGCGAAAGAACAGCATACCGC-3′. The two PCR primers internal to the gene (SKO2/SKO4) were created withSmaI sites to facilitate the ligation of the 1.4-kilobase pair kanamycin resistance cassette from pUC-KIXX (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), creating the final knockout construct (pSKO). This construct was transduced by φP22 into the genome of 14028s (23Sternberg N.L. Maurer R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 18-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), creating thehmp − strain. For Southern analysis, 10 μg ofSalI-digested genomic DNA was probed with an hmp [α-32]P-labeled PCR product (24Konat G.W. Laskiewicz I. Grubinska B. Wiggins R.C. Griffin H.G. Griffin A.W. PCR Technology: Current Innovations. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1994: 37-42Google Scholar). The blot was stripped and reprobed with the KanR cassette to confirm site-specific integration. To recover the DNA sequence downstream ofhmp, the 4.3-kilobase pair SalI fragment from thehmp − strain was cloned using KanRas selection and partially sequenced. A native hmp expression construct was created by PCR using SKO1 (213 bases upstream of the hmpstart codon) and SH4: (5′-GTAAAAGAAAGGCATAAAAAGCAGC-3′), an antisense oligo starting 48 bp downstream of a predicted 12-bp inverted repeat, which is centered 37 bp downstream of the hmp stop codon. The product was cloned into the XhoI/HindIII site of pUHE21–2lacI q (25Soncini F.C. Garcia-Vescovi E. Groisman E.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4364-4371Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), making pShmp. Thehmp nucleotide sequence was deduced from sequencing three separate clones of pShmp (26Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 74: 5463-5467Crossref Scopus (52505) Google Scholar), all of which were identical and deposited into GenBank. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma.S-Nitrosothiols were made as described previously (27Stamler J.S. Loscalzo J. Anal. Chem. 1992; 64: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Briefly, the S-nitroso-derivatives of glutathione (GSNO) orN-acetylated cysteine (SNAC) were prepared by making 1m solutions of the thiol in 1 n HCl and adding an equal volume of 1 m sodium nitrite. M9 minimal salts medium (pH 7.0): 7 g of Na2HPO4, 3 g of KH2PO4, 1 g of NH4Cl, 0.5 g of NaCl, 2 g of glucose, 120 mg of MgSO4, 15 mg of CaCl2, and 40 mg of thiamine/liter. For plates, agar was added to 1.5%. When needed, ampicillin (100 μg/ml) or kanamycin (50 μg/ml) was added to the medium. For nitrite growth curves, 1 × 104 cells of overnight cultures grown in LB-ampicillin were diluted into 250-ml culture flasks with 100 ml of fresh LB-ampicillin medium containing various concentrations of sodium nitrite. Cells were shaken at 225 rpm at 37 °C, and growth curves were measured by a Klett colorimeter with a red filter. Minimal inhibitory concentrations for oxidative stress compounds and NO derivatives were obtained by taking overnight cultures grown in LB and diluting in phosphate-buffered saline. 1 × 104 bacteria were then added to a test tube with 1 ml of M9 medium containing the inhibitory compound, which varied in concentration from tube to tube by 2-fold. The tubes were incubated with shaking at 37 °C. The minimal inhibitory concentration is the concentration of the compound where no visible growth occurred after 24 h. For plate cultures, 106 cells of overnight cultures grown in LB-ampicillin medium were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and streaked onto M9-ampicillin plates containing 10 mm GSNO. For liquid growth curves, 104 cells of overnight cultures grown in LB-ampicillin were diluted into 250-ml culture flasks with 100 ml of LB-ampicillin medium containing 500 μm GSNO. Cells were shaken at 225 rpm at 37 °C, and growth curves were measured. For anaerobic growth, 104 cells of LB-grown overnight cultures were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline and inoculated into 250-ml culture flasks containing 100 ml of LB-ampicillin medium. The flasks were then sealed with a two-holed stopper and ultrapure argon (Cee-Kay, St. Louis, MO) was vigorously bubbled into the medium for 30 min. The flasks were then incubated without shaking at 37 °C. Anaerobic indicator strips were used (Becton Dickinson Microbiology Systems) to confirm a proper seal. To determine if flavohemoglobins are involved in protection from oxidative and/or nitric oxide-mediated stress, we cloned and deleted the hmp gene of S. typhimurium. The coding region of the S. typhimurium hmp predicts a two-domain hemoglobin/reductase protein with 94% amino acid identity to theE. coli hmp (22Vasudevan S.G. Armarego W.L.F. Shaw D.C. Lilley P.E. Dixon N.E. Poole R.K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 226: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). As in E. coli, the gene upstream of the S. typhimurium hmp is the divergently transcribed glyA, encoding serine hydroxymethyltransferase (21Steiert J.G. Urbanowski M.L. Stauffer L.T. Plamann M.D. Stauffer G.V. J. DNA Seq. Mapp. 1990; 1: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Sequence similarity to the E. coli hmp locus, however, abruptly halts after the hmp stop codon. Instead ofglnB (22Vasudevan S.G. Armarego W.L.F. Shaw D.C. Lilley P.E. Dixon N.E. Poole R.K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 226: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), the cadC gene, a regulator of lysine decarboxylase in E. coli (28Watson N. Dunyak D.S. Rosey E.L. Slonczewski J.L. Olson E.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 530-540Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is directly downstream of theS. typhimurium hmp (Fig.1 A). The hmp gene does not appear to be part of an operon with cadC. The 189-bp intergenic region contains a 12-bp inverted repeat downstream of the hmp thought to terminate the hmp transcript and standard basal promoter elements immediately upstream ofcadC (not shown). For phenotypic characterization, we created a strain wherein most of the hmp coding region was replaced with a KanR cassette. This was confirmed by Southern blot analysis (Fig. 1 B). No detectable growth differences between the deletion (hmp −) and wild-type strains were observed under standard in vitro growth conditions in 100% oxygen, air, hypoxic, or anaerobic conditions (not shown). With 3 mm nitrite at pH 7, no significant difference in growth between strains was detected (Fig.2 A). Increasing the nitrite concentration to 30 mm, however, resulted in a substantial increase in the doubling time of the hmp −strain (Fig. 2 A). Nitrite will protonate to form HNO2, which quickly dismutates to produce several species of nitrogen oxides, including NO (29Bunton C.A. Llewellyn D.R. Stedman G. Nature. 1955; 175: 83-84Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 30Park J.-Y. Lee Y.-N. J. Phys. Chem. 1988; 92: 6294-6302Crossref Scopus (245) Google Scholar). When the pH of the solution was lowered to 6 to promote nitrite protonation, a delay in growth of the hmp − strain was seen with only 3 mm nitrite (Fig. 2 B). These results suggest that it is not nitrite but nitrogen oxides created by the protonation and subsequent dismutation of nitrite, that produce the difference in growth between the wild-type and hmp −strains. Given the association of both hemoglobin and nitric oxide-mediated stress responses to oxygen metabolites, we were interested in determining whether the flavohemoglobin protects against both O2 and NO-mediated insult. Cultures were assayed for the minimal inhibitory concentrations of oxidative and nitric oxide-producing stressors. Both the superoxide generator paraquat and hydrogen peroxide inhibited growth of the wild-type and mutant strains equally (Table I). Profound disparities between wild-type and hmp − strains were seen with the NO-donating S-nitrosothiols. These compounds possess a broad spectrum antimicrobial activity, presumably by donating nitrosonium (NO+) to critical intracellular thiol targets, disruption of iron-sulfur clusters, and by damage to DNA (31Arnelle D.R. Stamler J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, 32De Groote M.A. Granger D. Xu Y. Campbell G. Prince R. Fang F.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The NO derivatives of both GSNO and SNAC inhibited the growth of thehmp − strain by approximately an order of magnitude more than wild-type (Table I). We also wanted to ascertain whether the flavohemoglobin is involved in protection from peroxynitrite (OONO−), which is formed by the reaction of O2− with NO· and is a major effector in the NO-dependent bacteriocidal activity of macrophages (34Crow J.P. Beckman J.S. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 196: 57-73PubMed Google Scholar). The minimal inhibitory concentrations of the peroxynitrite generator 3-morpholinosydnonimine hydrochloride (35Freelisch M. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1989; 14: 13-22Crossref Scopus (396) Google Scholar) were identical between the two strains (Table I), indicating that hmp does not protect from peroxynitrite.Table IMinimal inhibitory concentrations of various stressors on 14028s (WT) and hmp − S. typhimurium measured as the mean ± S.E.StrainParaquatH2O2GSNOSNACSIN-1μmμmmmmmmmWT15.1 ± 4.025010 ± 4.95.5 ± 1.21.0hmp −15.1 ± 4.02500.70 ± 0.30.62 ± 0.71.0 Open table in a new tab To further characterize the involvement of hmp in the NO-meditated stress response, both wild-type and hmp −strains were cultured in medium containing GSNO. Whether on plates (Fig. 3 A) or in liquid culture (Fig. 3 B), the parental organism was able to grow, whereas the growth of the hmp− strain was greatly slowed. Growth of the hmp− strain could be restored by reintroduction of the hmp gene on a low copy number plasmid. A slight toxicity of the hmp rescue plasmid was seen in liquid culture, even in the wild-type strain (Fig. 3 B). A similar restoration from the nitrite-mediated growth inhibition was observed using thehmp-expressing plasmid (not shown). To determine if the flavohemoglobin requires oxygen to exert its protective effect against NO donors, liquid cultures were subjected to anaerobiosis. Thehmp − cultures grown anaerobically continued to be hypersensitive to GSNO (Fig. 3 C), suggesting that the flavohemoglobin is important in nitric oxide-mediated stress protection even in the absence of oxygen. The flavohemoglobin gene is hypothesized to have been present in organisms before the divergence of prokaryotes and eukaryotes (36Zhu H. Riggs A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5015-5019Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and, like cytochrome oxidase, may predate the existence of significant levels of atmospheric oxygen (37Castresana J. Lubben M. Saraste M. Higgins D.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2516-2525Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Interaction with NO may be a universal feature of hemoglobins throughout phylogeny. Even the vertebrate hemoglobins, well understood as facilitators of oxygen delivery, display physiologically important interactions with nitric oxide. Human hemoglobin binds NO tightly in the heme pocket and may assist in NO sequestration (38Lancaster J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8137-8141Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). S-Nitrosohemoglobin, formed by a NO bound to the thiol group of Cys-93 in the β-chain, may be a major intermediate in transduction of the NO vasodilating signal in humans (39Jia L. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1996; 380: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1460) Google Scholar, 40Stamler J.S. Jia L. McMahon T.J. Demchenko I.T. Bonaventura J. Gernert K. Piantadosi C.A. Science. 1997; 276: 2034-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). Formation of a physiologically relevantS-nitrosoflavohemoglobin in Salmonella or another microorganism is unlikely. No cysteine residues are conserved in the heme binding domain of these molecules, and indeed there are no cysteines at all in heme binding domain of the Salmonellahmp. Instead the NO moiety likely interacts with hmp inside the heme pocket. This type of interaction is supported by experimental evidence showing that E. coli hmp can form a nitrosylated complex with a reduced heme iron (41Ioannidis N. Cooper C.E. Poole R.K. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 649-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). NO production can occur endogenously inE. coli using nitrite as an electron acceptor. Ferrous iron, nitrate reductase, and low pH can compete with the preferred enzymatic reduction of nitrite to NH3 and instead create nitric oxide (42Smith M.S. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1983; 45: 1545-1547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Ji X.-B. Hollocher T.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 157: 106-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 44Kaldorf M. Linne von Berg K.H. Meler U. Servos U. Bothe H. Arch. Microbiol. 1993; 160: 432-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). NO compounds also threaten bacteria from other sources, including the S-nitrosothiols produced in the vertebrate host (45Gaston B. Reilly J. Drazen J.M. Fackler J. Ramdev P. Arnelle D. Mullins M.E. Sugarbaker D.J. Chee C. Singel D.J. Loscalzo J. Stamler J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10957-10961Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 46MacMicking J. Xie Q.-W. Nathan C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 323-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (3458) Google Scholar). The flavohemoglobin may function by simply sequestering NO in its heme pocket, allowing other enzymes to detoxify the moiety. The homocysteine molecule, which forms a more stable S-nitrosylated form than GSNO or SNAC, may also serve as a NO sink in Salmonella. Mutants deficient in homocysteine biosynthesis are 2–3-fold more sensitive to S-nitrosothiols by zone of inhibition assays (47De Groote M.A. Testerman T. Xu Y. Stauffer G. Fang F.C. Science. 1996; 272: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Alternatively, hmp may directly detoxify NO by an oxidoreductase reaction, leading to a less toxic nitrogen oxide product. It should be noted, however, that no NO reductase activity could be demonstrated using the A. eutrophus flavohemoglobin (17Cramm R. Siddiqui R.A. Friedrich B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7349-7354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another intriguing possibility is that hmp, upon binding NO in its heme domain, might be able to transduce a NO signal through its reductase domain, leading to the positive regulation of protective genes. A hemoprotein-containing, two-component system that senses oxygen levels exists in Rhizobium, where the FixL protein regulates its N-terminal kinase activity via oxygen bound to its C-terminal heme binding domain (48Gilles-Gonzales M.A. Ditta G.S. Helinski D.R. Nature. 1991; 360: 170-172Crossref Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Whichever mechanism applies, it is apparent that this bacterial hemoglobin can function independently of oxygen to protect the organism from stress effected by nitric oxide. We thank E. Groisman and F. Solomon for provision of S. typhimurium strains and for helpful suggestions and J. Gordon, M. Caparon, and V. Miller for critical reading of this manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2044583800,"Abl is an axonal tyrosine kinase that has yet to be clearly linked to a receptor; Notch is a receptor for which the signaling pathway remains incompletely understood. We show here that Notch and abl mutations interact synergistically to produce synthetic lethality and defects in axon extension. Surprisingly, we cannot account for these axonal aberrations on the basis of changes in cell identity. We show, moreover, that Notch is present in the growth cones of extending axons, and that the Abl accessory protein Disabled binds to a signaling domain of Notch in vitro. We therefore speculate that Disabled and Abl may play a role in Notch signaling in Drosophila axons, perhaps by binding to the Notch intracellular domain."
https://openalex.org/W1531318853,"There is an ongoing scientific debate concerning the potential threat of environmental estrogenic pollutants to animal and human health (1–5). Pollutants including the detergents 4-octylphenol and p-nonylphenol and chlorinated insecticides have recently been reported to modulate sexual differentiation by interacting with nuclear steroid receptors (6–8). So far, the focus has been on reproductive organs, but sex steroids have far more widespread actions. The lower incidence of cardiovascular disease in women has been attributed to estrogens (9–14), yet no information is available on the vascular actions of environmental estrogenic pollutants. In the present study we have investigated the effects of acute exposure to 17β-estradiol, the antiestrogen ICI 182,780, and estrogenic pollutants on coronary vascular tone as well as on intracellular Ca2+ levels ([Ca2+]i) and Ca2+ and K+ channel activity in vascular smooth muscle cells. We report here that 4-octylphenol, p-nonylphenol, o.p′-DDT, and the antiestrogen ICI 182,780 inhibit L-type Ca2+ channels in vascular smooth muscle cells and evoke a rapid and endothelium-independent relaxation of the coronary vasculature similar to that induced by 17β-estradiol. Thus, inhibition of Ca2+ influx via L-type Ca2+ channels in vascular smooth muscle cells may explain the acute, nongenomic vasodilator actions of environmental estrogenic pollutants."
https://openalex.org/W2119544587,"Anticancer therapy with doxorubicin (DOX) is limited by severe cardiotoxicity, presumably reflecting the intramyocardial formation of drug metabolites that alter cell constituents and functions. In a previous study, we showed that NADPH-supplemented cytosolic fractions from human myocardial samples can enzymatically reduce a carbonyl group in the side chain of DOX, yielding a secondary alcohol metabolite called doxorubicinol (DOXol). Here we demonstrate that DOXol delocalizes low molecular weight Fe(II) from the [4Fe-4S] cluster of cytoplasmic aconitase. Iron delocalization proceeds through the reoxidation of DOXol to DOX and liberates DOX-Fe(II) complexes as ultimate by-products. Under physiologic conditions, cluster disassembly abolishes aconitase activity and forms an apoprotein that binds to mRNAs, coordinately increasing the synthesis of transferrin receptor but decreasing that of ferritin. Aconitase is thus converted into an iron regulatory protein-1 (IRP-1) that causes iron uptake to prevail over sequestration, forming a pool of free iron that is used for metabolic functions. Conversely, cluster reassembly converts IRP-1 back to aconitase, providing a regulatory mechanism to decrease free iron when it exceeds metabolic requirements. In contrast to these physiologic mechanisms, DOXol-dependent iron release and cluster disassembly not only abolish aconitase activity, but also affect irreversibly the ability of the apoprotein to function as IRP-1 or to reincorporate iron within new Fe-S motifs. This damage is mediated by DOX-Fe(II) complexes and reflects oxidative modifications of ―SH residues having the dual role to coordinate cluster assembly and facilitate interactions of IRP-1 with mRNAs. Collectively, these findings describe a novel mechanism of cardiotoxicity, suggesting that intramyocardial formation of DOXol may perturb the homeostatic processes associated with cluster assembly or disassembly and the reversible switch between aconitase and IRP-1. These results may also provide a guideline to design new drugs that mitigate the cardiotoxicity of DOX."
https://openalex.org/W2015166318,"Chondroitin lyase products of aggrecan and small proteoglycans from normal and osteoarthritic cartilages were analyzed for chain internal Δdisaccharides and terminal mono- or disaccharides. Chondroitin and dermatan sulfate chains from arthritic cartilages were of essentially normal size and internal sulfation but had significantly altered sulfation of the terminal residues. Whereas in normal cartilage, ∼60% of terminal GalNAc4S was 4,6-disulfated, it was reduced to ∼30% in osteoarthritic cartilage. This is most likely due to a lower terminal GalNAc4,6S-disulfotransferase activity and reveals that metabolic changes in osteoarthritis can affect this distinct sulfation step during chondroitin and dermatan sulfate synthesis. GlcAβ1,3GalNAc6S-, the mimotope for antibody 3B3(−), was present on ∼8 and ∼10% of chains from normal and osteoarthritic cartilages, respectively. 3B3(−) assayed by immunodot blot was within the normal range for most osteoarthritic samples, with only 5 of 24 displaying elevated reactivity. This resulted not from a higher content of mimotope, but possibly from other structural changes in the proteoglycan that increase mimotope reactivity. In summary, chemical determination of sulfation isomers at the non-reducing termini of chondroitin and dermatan sulfate provides a reliable assay for monitoring proteoglycan metabolism not only during normal growth of cartilage but also during remodeling of cartilage in osteoarthritis.

The function of normal adult joint cartilage resides in its ability to provide resistance to compressive, tensile, and shear forces that occur during normal joint motion. The specialized extracellular matrix consists of a fibrillar collagen network (1Poole A.R. Koopman W.J. Arthritis and Allied Conditions. Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore1996: 279-333Google Scholar), highly organized and stabilized through inter- and intramolecular cross-links that restrain the swelling pressure exerted by the high concentration of negatively charged aggrecan aggregates (2Sandy J.D.

The metabolic activity of chondrocytes in adult cartilage is adapted to maintain the composition of a functional extracellular matrix. The collagen network is relatively metabolically inert (3Eyre D.R. McDevitt C.A. Muir H. Ann. Rheum.

This hypothesis has been particularly supported by published reports (18Carney S.L. Billingham M.E. Muir H. Sandy J.D. J. Orthop.

Changes included decreased keratan sulfate/CS ratio, increased 4-sulfation of CS, and alterations in hydrodynamic size of CS chains. In addition, the use of monoclonal antibodies to CS epitopes that were considered abundant on fetal, but not on normal mature adult aggrecan, indicated that aggrecan from OA cartilages displayed elevated immunoreactivity compared with normal adult cartilages (22Rizkalla G.

However, the use of the immunological data to describe CS fine structures remains problematic, because the structure of the carbohydrate epitopes recognized by the antibodies has not been established in many cases. Furthermore, immunoreactivity of CS epitopes is likely influenced by assay conditions that affect chain presentation and epitope concentration much as was seen in solid phase immunoassays with monoclonal antibody 3B3(−) (27Plaas A.H.K.

Despite the large number of reported changes in composition of CS in OA cartilages as well as of CS in synovial fluids (30Hazell P.K. Dent C. Fairclogh J.A. Bayliss M.T. Hardingham T.E.

Dis. 1997; 56: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), methods have not been available to determine if such disease-related alterations in structure are randomly distributed within the GAG chain or confined to specific domains. Because of this limitation it has not been possible to establish the importance of changes in the process of GAG biosynthesis as opposed to alterations in matrix catabolism to the observed changes in GAG composition of tissue and synovial fluid proteoglycans. Our previous work on the fine structure of the non-reducing terminal residues on aggrecan CS (33Plaas A.H.K. Hascall V.C. Midura R.J. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 37-45Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar) showed that such structures are specific and are a distinguishing feature of aggrecan from human cartilages before or after skeletal maturity. This was most readily seen for the GalNAc residues, which represent the terminal on ∼90% of CS chains on aggrecan from all ages. In growth cartilages, they were almost exclusively 4-monosulfated, whereas in mature cartilages about 50% were 4,6-disulfated (27Plaas A.H.K. Wong-Palms S. Roughley P.J. Midura R.J. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20603-20610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these changes in sulfation of the termini occurred later in life than the much described alteration in 4- and 6-monosulfation of the internal repeating disaccharides. This is clearly in support of separate enzymes for hexosamine sulfation in the chain interior or terminus. We have now extended such studies to determine the internal and non-reducing terminal sulfation isomers on CS and DS from high and low buoyant density PGs purified normal and OA knee cartilages, to delineate potential disease-related alterations in GAG sulfation. Chondroitinases ABC (Proteus vulgaris) and ACII (Arthrobacter aurescens) were from Seikagaku Corp. (Rockville, MD). Papain, pepstatin, and aminoethylbenzenesulfonyl fluoride were obtained from Sigma. Anti-ATEG antiserum to aggrecan G1 domain was kindly supplied by Dr. John Sandy (Shriners Hospital, Tampa Unit), and the anti-LEC 7 antiserum to aggrecan G3 domain was supplied by Dr. Kurt Doege (Shriners Hospital, Portland Unit). Monoclonal antibody 2B6 ascites fluid and rat anti-mouse IgM were from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA). Nitrocellulose membranes (0.2 μm) were from Bio-Rad. Nylon N+ membranes, ECL Western blotting reagent, and Hyperfilm were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All other chemicals were obtained as described (27Plaas A.H.K. Wong-Palms S.

Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 37-45Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Details of tissue donors and sampling are given in Fig. 1, A andB. Cartilage plugs (∼5 mm diameter, full depth) were obtained from the right knees of adult donors from 20 individual sites (Fig. 1 A) within 3–18 h postmortem, during bone tissue harvest. The classification “Normal” was based on the macroscopic appearance, with no evidence of surface fibrillation, cartilage erosion, or prior knee injuries. Furthermore, cartilage plugs from adjacent sites were assayed for collagen II cleavage by immunoassay described by Hollander et al. (47Hollander A.P. Heathfield T.F. Webber C. Iwata Y. Bourne R. Roraback C. Poole A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1722-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar), and no damage to the collagen network was detected in the normal group. 2F. Nelson and A. R. Poole, unpublished observations. Cartilages were also taken from right knees of patients with uni-compartmental late stage OA, within 12–18 h of a total knee arthroplasty. Tibial plateaus were obtained as an intact surface and femoral condyles separated into medial and lateral compartments (Fig.1 B, donor I). For donors III–V, cartilage plugs (∼5 mm diameter) were harvested from the same 20 individual locations as for normal knees. Donors I–II had insufficient cartilage at the select locations of the medial surfaces, as illustrated in Fig. 1. An approximately 1-mm2 full thickness slice was removed from the middle of each plug of normal cartilage and stored separately for total GAG preparation, and the remainder was pooled for PG preparation (see below). An additional set of plugs was taken from OA joints for total GAG preparation, and these were removed adjacent to the first 20 sites, with the exact location chosen to match closely the macroscopic appearance. All tissues were frozen at −70 °C until processed as described below. For the preparation of purified PGs, cartilages were pooled as follows: from normal donor V and OA donors I–III, plugs from the medial femoral condyle, plugs from the lateral femoral condyle, plugs from the medial tibial plateau, or plugs from the lateral tibial plateau were pooled separately; from normal donors I–IV, the plugs from both medial and lateral femoral condyles (FC) or from medial and lateral tibial plateaus were pooled. The tissues were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors (5 mm EDTA, 1 mmaminoethylbenzenesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 10 mmaminohexanoic acid), minced finely on ice, and then extracted for 48 h at 4 °C in 15 volumes of 4 m guanidine HCl, 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 7.0, 1% (w/v) CHAPS, and the protease inhibitor mixture described above. The extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min and assayed for total GAG by dimethylmethylene blue (34Farndale R.W. Buttle D.J. Barrett A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 883: 173-17735Crossref PubMed Scopus (2895) Google Scholar). About 84 and 89% of total GAG was solubilized from normal and OA cartilage samples, respectively. The extracts were adjusted to a final density of 1.48 g/ml with CsCl and subjected to centrifugation at 38,000 rpm for 48 h in a Beckman 50 Ti rotor. The tubes were divided into four four equal parts (D1–D4). For both normal and OA preparations, ∼87% of the total GAG was recovered in the D1 fraction, ∼6% in each of the D2 and D3 fractions, and ∼1% in the D4 fractions. Each fraction was dialyzed consecutively against water, 1 m NaCl, and water and then stored at final GAG concentrations of 2 mg/ml at −20 °C. 10-μg portions (GAG as dimethylmethylene blue reactivity) of the D1 and pooled D2/3 gradient fractions were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h with 0.2 milliunits protease-free chondroitinase ABC and an additional 2 h with 0.2 milliunits each of keratanase II and endo-β-galactosidase, in 20 μl of 50 mm sodium acetate, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.0, containing 7 mm each aminoethylbenzenesulfonyl fluoride andN-ethylmaleimide. The samples were electrophoresed on 4–12% polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions; separated core proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose (at 75 V for 1.5 h), and membranes were developed with anti-ATEG or anti-LEC peptide-antisera (1:5000) or 2B6 mouse monoclonal ascites fluid (1:1000) as described (26Cs-Szabo G. Roughley P.J. Plaas A.H.K. Glant T. Arthritis & Rheum. 1995; 38: 660-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Reactive core proteins were visualized by exposure to preflashed Hyperfilm for 15–30 s after incubation with ECL detection reagent. In the D1 fractions from both normal and OA cartilages, four G1-containing core protein species were seen, and these migrated with apparent molecular sizes of ∼350, 250, 180, and 115 kDa. Western blots of identical samples using the G3-specific anti-LEC antiserum showed that only the 350-kDa species was reactive representing the full-length core protein containing both the N-terminal G1 and the C-terminal G3 globular domains. The faster migrating, G3-negative, core proteins represented aggrecan species that had undergone proteolytic processing in the CS-1 or CS-2 domains (26Cs-Szabo G. Roughley P.J. Plaas A.H.K. Glant T. Arthritis & Rheum. 1995; 38: 660-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 36Vilim V. Fosang A.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 887-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The relative abundance of the core protein species from normal and OA cartilages, estimated by densitometric scanning, showed that in OA samples the 180-kDa species was markedly lower than in normals (reduced to 25–50%), with the 350-kDa species correspondingly increased (40–70%). There was little or no change in the 250- and 115-kDa species. There was no distinction in the degree of change between normal and OA D1 aggrecan for the different anatomical sites or between patients. PGs from both normal and OA cartilages, purified into the D2 and D3 fractions, were composed of a mixture of aggrecan and small proteoglycans (decorin and biglycan) based on determination of the core protein sizes by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and reactivity in Western blotting with anti-ATEG and 2B6 monoclonal antibody (40Couchman J.R. Caterson B. Christner J.E. Baker J.R. Matrices and Cell Differentiation. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1989: 31-46Google Scholar). Cartilage plugs from the individual sampling locations (see Fig. 1) were solubilized with 167 μg of papain in 250 μl of 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, containing 1 mmcysteine HCl, overnight at 60 °C. The digests were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Three volumes of 95% ethanol were added to the supernatants, and GAGs were precipitated at 4 °C for 18 h. Precipitates were washed once with 95% ethanol, 5 mm sodium acetate, resuspended in water, and assayed for total GAG with dimethylmethylene blue (34Farndale R.W. Buttle D.J. Barrett A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 883: 173-17735Crossref PubMed Scopus (2895) Google Scholar). The GAG content was between 0.10 and 0.15 mg per mg dry weight of tissue for normal specimens and between 0.06 and 0.13 mg per mg dry weight for OA specimens. 10-μg portions of GAG (as dimethylmethylene blue reactivity) of D1 and D2/3 PGs were dissolved in 100 μl of 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 7.3, digested for 18 h at 37 °C with 50 milliunits each chondroitinase ACII and ABC and reduced prior to analyses by capillary zone electrophoresis for the quantitation of ΔDi-0S and ΔDi-HA (33Plaas A.H.K. Hascall V.C. Midura R.J. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 37-45Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). ΔDi-0S was present only in digests from D1 PGs and accounted for no more than 3% of the total CS disaccharide products. ΔDi-HA was in digests from all D2/3 fractions and accounted for 10–35% of the Δdisaccharide products. 20-μg portions of GAG (as dimethylmethylene blue reactivity) of D1 and D2/3 PGs or ethanol-precipitated GAGs were dissolved in 100 μl of 100 mm ammonium acetate, pH 7.3, and digested for 18 h at 37 °C with 50 milliunits each chondroitinase ACII and ABC and derivatized by reductive amination with 2-aminopyridine and borane dimethylamine. Products were separated by fluorescence-based anion exchange HPLC and quantitated as described (27Plaas A.H.K. Wong-Palms S. Roughley P.J. Midura R.J. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20603-20610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 33Plaas A.H.K. Hascall V.C. Midura R.J. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 37-45Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Additional mercuric acetate treatment prior to HPLC analyses was essential to quantitate accurately the saturated disaccharides GlcAβ1,3GalNAc4S- and GlcAβ1,3GalNAc6S from the non-reducing termini. The efficiency of CS/DS digestion by the chondroitin lyases was checked in each sample. Digests were spun through MicroCon 3 filtration units, and both filtrate and retentate were assayed for uronic acid content (35Bitter T. Muir H. Anal. Biochem. 1962; 4: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (5192) Google Scholar). Thus, for all samples >92% of the uronic acid was recovered in the filtrate consistent with an effective digestion of the CS/DS chains under the conditions used. Immunoreactivity of D1 and D2/3 PGs was assessed essentially as described (27Plaas A.H.K. Wong-Palms S. Roughley P.J. Midura R.J. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20603-20610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Briefly, PGs were diluted in Tris-buffered saline to final concentrations of 0.78–100 μg/ml total GAG. Aliquots (25 μl) of each dilution were adsorbed to either nitrocellulose or nylon N+ membranes for 1 h at room temperature, using a 96-well dot blot apparatus (Bio-Rad), and unbound PGs and buffer were removed by vacuum filtration. Under these conditions, about 30% of the applied PG remained immobilized. It should be noted that D2/3 fractions contain other PGs, such as decorin, biglycan, and versican, which may compete for membrane binding with aggrecan during immobilization. Decorin, biglycan, or versican were not quantitated in this study, and published data on the abundance of decorin, biglycan, or versican relative to aggrecan (i.e.moles of core protein or GAG) in normal adult or OA cartilages are not available. Thus no attempt was made to assign the 3B3(−) reactivity to a single PG species in the D2/3 fraction. 3B3 immunoreactivity was visualized by chemiluminescence using the ECL detection reagent and quantitated with the NIH 1.57 Image Analyses software after scanning the exposed films with a Hewlett-Packard Scan Jet 3C/T as described (27Plaas A.H.K. Wong-Palms S. Roughley P.J. Midura R.J. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20603-20610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Reactivity was expressed as gray scale units of pixel density per dot. The linear response range of the film was between 10 to 150 units of integrated pixel densities. Sulfated Δdisaccharide composition of the D1 and D2/3 PGs was examined by fluorescence-based anion exchange HPLC (Fig. 2). In all D1 digests, ΔDi-6S was predominant accounting for ∼95% of the chain internal disaccharide in normal samples and ∼93% in OA samples (Fig.2, top panels). ΔDi-4S was low in all samples, and accounted for ∼1 in 20 disaccharides in the normal. This was also seen in most osteoarthritic samples, and only two were slightly higher with ∼1 in 15 disaccharides 4-sulfated. The disulfated disaccharides, ΔDiB and ΔDiD, were detected in all samples analyzed here (data not shown), but only as minor components (∼0.07 and ∼1.2%, respectively), and no significant difference was observed between the normal and OA samples. Interestingly, ΔDiE, previously shown to be present only in fetal but not postnatal human aggrecan CS (27Plaas A.H.K. Wong-Palms S. Roughley P.J. Midura R.J. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20603-20610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), was not detected in any of the normal or OA samples. Chondroitin lyase digestion products from D2/D3 PGs (Fig. 2,bottom panel) of all cartilages also contained ΔDi-6S as the predominant disaccharide. This isomer accounted for ∼72 ± 2% (n = 12) of digestion products from normal samples and ∼70 ± 6% (n = 12) of products from OA samples, and these were not significantly different from each other. ΔDi-4S was more abundant (∼30%) in the low buoyant density fractions and was only quantitatively obtained with chondroitinase ABC, but not chondroitinase ACII, and therefore is most likely derived from digests of DS of the decorin and biglycan present in these fractions. The chondroitin lyase products also contained non-reducing termini of the CS and DS chains, as these are quantitively liberated as mono- and saturated disaccharides during the digestion procedure used here. They were also separated and identified by fluorescence anion exchange HPLC (27Plaas A.H.K. Wong-Palms S. Roughley P.J. Midura R.J. Hascall V.C. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2165174899,"The transmembrane topology of the serotonin transporter (SERT) has been examined by measuring the reactivity of selected lysine and cysteine residues with extracellular reagents. An impermeant biotinylating reagent, sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(biotinamido)ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate (NHS-SS-biotin), was shown to label SERT transiently expressed in cultured cells. Replacement of four lysine residues that were predicted to lie in external hydrophilic loops (eK-less) largely prevented the biotinylation reaction. Likewise, the cysteine-specific biotinylation reagentN-biotinylaminoethylmethanethiosulfonate (MTSEA-biotin) labeled wild type SERT but not a mutant in which Cys-109, predicted to lie in the first external loop, was replaced with alanine. These two mutant transporters reacted with the biotinylating reagents in digitonin-permeabilized cells, demonstrating that the abundant lysine and cysteine residues predicted to lie in intracellular hydrophilic domains were reactive but not accessible in intact cells. Mutants containing a single external lysine at positions 111, 194, 243, 319, 399, 490, and 571 reacted more readily with NHS-SS-biotin than did the eK-less mutant. Similarly, mutants with a single cysteine at positions 109, 310, 406, 489, and 564 reacted more readily with MTSEA-biotin than did the C109A mutant. All of these mutants were active and therefore likely to be folded correctly.

The substrates for this transporter family include neurotransmitters such as serotonin (5-HT), norepinephrine, dopamine, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and glycine as well as other substances such as proline, creatine, betaine, and taurine (6Sneddon J.M.

The biogenic amine transporters, SERT, the dopamine transporter, and the norepinephrine transporter (NET) are important in vivo targets for antidepressant and psychostimulant drugs (17Pacholczyk T.

As a result of the high level of sequence conservation within the NaCl-dependent transporter family, hydropathy profiles of the various transporters are almost identical. These profiles have been interpreted as evidence for 12 transmembrane domains with the NH2- and COOH-terminal domains in the cytoplasm (17Pacholczyk T. Blakely R. Amara S. Nature. 1991; 350: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, 22Guastella J. Nelson N. Nelson H. Czyzyk L. Keynan S. Miedel M. Davidson N. Lester H. Kanner B.I. Science. 1990; 249: 1303-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Understanding the topological organization of these transporters is essential for any thorough analysis of their structure. Some features of the originally proposed topology have been confirmed experimentally, but others are in dispute. Each member of the family has one or more potential sites for glycosylation in the second predicted external hydrophilic loop (EL2). These glycosylation sites have been removed in SERT (23Tate C.G. Blakely R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26303-26310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), NET (24Melikian H.E. Ramamoorthy S. Tate C.G. Blakely R.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 266-276PubMed Google Scholar), the GABA transporter GAT-1 (25Bennett E.R. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1203-1210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and the glycine transporter GLYT-1 (26Olivares L. Aragon C. Gimenez C. Zafra F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9437-9442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In each case, the electrophoretic mobility of the transporter increased in a manner indicating that the glycosylation sites in EL2 are utilized and are therefore in the extracellular domain of the protein. Bennett and Kanner (25Bennett E.R. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1203-1210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and Olivares et al. (27Olivares L. Aragon C. Gimenez C. Zafra F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1211-1217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) carried this approach further by inserting new glycosylation sites into other internal and external loops. Two of the GAT-1 glycosylation mutants were both functional and glycosylated, indicating that the transporter structure was not severely disrupted and that the glycosylation site was in the extracellular domain. In these mutants, the new glycosylation sites were inserted in EL3 or EL6. Many other insertions into GLYT-1 and GAT-1 led to inactive or nonglycosylated transporters. Bruss et al. (28Bruss M. Hammermann R. Brimijoin S. Bonisch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9197-9201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) used antibodies raised against specific portions of NET to determine the accessibility of those regions. Antibodies directed against EL2 and EL4 reacted with fixed COS-7 cells expressing human NET as determined by immunofluorescence. In contrast, antibodies against the NH2- and COOH-terminal regions reacted only after the fixed cells had been permeabilized (28Bruss M. Hammermann R. Brimijoin S. Bonisch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9197-9201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 29Melikian H.E. McDonald J.K. Gu H. Rudnick G. Moore K.R. Blakely R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12290-12297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results confirm the originally predicted topology (17Pacholczyk T. Blakely R. Amara S. Nature. 1991; 350: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, 22Guastella J. Nelson N. Nelson H. Czyzyk L. Keynan S. Miedel M. Davidson N. Lester H. Kanner B.I. Science. 1990; 249: 1303-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Another approach to determining transporter topology has been to construct fusion proteins in which the NH2-terminal part of GAT-1 and GLYT-1 has been attached to a reporter protein (27Olivares L. Aragon C. Gimenez C. Zafra F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1211-1217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 30Clark J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14695-14704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The glycosylation of the fusion protein and its susceptibility to proteases when expressed in cells or in microsomal systems are indicators of the topology at the point where the two proteins are fused. It is difficult to draw firm conclusions from these studies because the fusion proteins are, by nature, inactive for transport, and their folding status may be different from that of the native transporters. Moreover, the studies using GAT-1 and GLYT-1 came to different conclusions about the topology of loops EL1 and IL1. The GAT-1 fusions in Xenopus oocyte microsomes supported the original topology (30Clark J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14695-14704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), but studies with GLYT-1 fusions in vitro supported an alternative model in which the first predicted transmembrane domain does not cross the membrane, the predicted EL1 is cytoplasmic, and the predicted IL1 is extracellular (27Olivares L. Aragon C. Gimenez C. Zafra F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1211-1217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Also supporting this alternative model are glycosylation insertion mutations of GLYT-1 and GAT-1 and chemical inactivation studies of GAT-1 (25Bennett E.R. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1203-1210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 27Olivares L. Aragon C. Gimenez C. Zafra F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1211-1217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). No glycosylation site insertions in EL1 of GAT-1 and GLYT-1 were utilized (25Bennett E.R. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1203-1210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 27Olivares L. Aragon C. Gimenez C. Zafra F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1211-1217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, insertion of a glycosylation site in IL1 of either GAT-1 or GLYT-1 led to an inactive, glycosylated protein (25Bennett E.R. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1203-1210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 27Olivares L. Aragon C. Gimenez C. Zafra F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1211-1217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Moreover, Cys-74 in EL1 of GAT-1 was susceptible to modification with the cysteine reagent MTSEA but not by its analog MTSET (25Bennett E.R. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1203-1210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In studies with artificial lipid vesicles, MTSEA had been found to be more permeant than MTSET (31Holmgren M. Liu Y. Xu Y. Yellen G. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 797-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). These results were interpreted as evidence favoring an alternative topology in which the predicted TM1 did not cross the membrane, EL1 was cytoplasmic, TM2 was the first true transmembrane domain, IL1 was external, and TM3 crossed the membrane twice. In contrast, we found that Cys-109 in EL1 of SERT (corresponding to Cys-74 in GAT-1) could react with extracellular MTSEA and MTSET in intact cells (32Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1479-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Although MTSET inactivated SERT more slowly than MTSEA, the ability of this impermeant reagent to inactivate SERT from the cell exterior indicated that EL1 of SERT was exposed to the external medium. Moreover, MTSET reactivity with cysteine residues inserted into TM3 of SERT suggests a helical secondary structure for this region (33Chen J.G. Sachpatzidis A. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28321-28327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). If TM3 is helical, it would be less likely to traverse the membrane twice. Despite the high conservation of sequence among the NaCl-dependent transporters and the assumption that all members of this family will have the same transmembrane topology, serious differences remain among laboratories in the topological assignment of EL1 and IL1. In an attempt to resolve these differences, we have investigated the transmembrane topology of SERT by studying the reactivity of endogenous and inserted lysine and cysteine residues in the predicted extracellular domain. The use of small impermeant reagents allows detection even of residues in small loops which might not be accessible to macromolecular reagents such as antibodies, proteases, or glycosylation machinery. An advantage of making only small changes in the amino acid sequence is that the mutants used in this study retain most or all of the transport activity of the wild type transporter. Our results argue in favor of the original topology (17Pacholczyk T. Blakely R. Amara S. Nature. 1991; 350: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, 22Guastella J. Nelson N. Nelson H. Czyzyk L. Keynan S. Miedel M. Davidson N. Lester H. Kanner B.I. Science. 1990; 249: 1303-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar) and against the revised topology (25Bennett E.R. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1203-1210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 27Olivares L. Aragon C. Gimenez C. Zafra F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1211-1217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Starting with pCGT137, which contained a FLAG epitope tag engineered at the COOH terminus of the rat SERT (23Tate C.G. Blakely R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26303-26310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we used the ChameleonTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to replace endogenous lysine residues with glutamine or arginine and to replace other residues with lysine. A total of four lysine residues is predicted in the external loops of SERT. Lys-243 and Lys-399 are in the second and the fourth external loops (EL2 and EL4), respectively, and both Lys-314 and Lys-319 are in the third loop, EL3. Three of these four lysine residues were eliminated to create a mutant with only one external lysine. Mutant K399 was created by sequential mutation of Lys-243 and Lys-314 to arginine and Lys-319 to glutamine. Mutant K319 was created by mutation of Lys-243 and Lys-314 to arginine and Lys-399 to glutamine. A mutant with no predicted external lysine residues (eK-less) was created by subcloning a fragment containing K399Q from the mutant K319 into the mutant K399. The mutated sequences were subcloned into wild type SERT, and the subcloned regions were sequenced to make sure that no unwanted mutations were introduced. Mutant K243 was obtained by subcloning a fragment containing K314R, K319Q, and K399Q from eK-less into the wild type transporter. Mutations and sites used for subcloning are summarized in Table I.Table IMutagenesis of lysine and cysteine residues in the predicted external loops of SERTMutantMutations in wild typeReactive external loopSublconing sitesSubcloned regionLysine mutants eK-lessK243R, K314R, K319Q, K399QNoneBsmI/BsmI714–1929 K243K314R, K319Q, K399Q2BbsI/AflII976–1858 K319K243R, K314R, K399Q3RsrII/AflII623–1858 K399K243R, K314R, K319Q4RsrII/NheI623–1090 Q111KQ111K + eK-less1EcoRV/RsrII1–623 R194KR194K + eK-less2EcoRV/BbsI1–976 T490KT490K + eK-less5AflII/BstEII1134–1858 H571KH571K + eK-less6EcoNI/AflII1563–1858Cysteine mutants Wild typeNone1 C109AC109ANoneEcoRV/NdeI1–495 V310CV310C, C109A3RsrII/BstEII623–1134 L406CL406C, C109A4BstEII/AflII1134–1858 V489CV489C, C109A5BstEII/AflII1134–1858 L564CL564C, C109A6BstEII/AflII1134–1858 Open table in a new tab Using this eK-less mutant, specific residues in external loops were replaced with lysine. Gln-111 in the first external loop (EL1) was a replaced with lysine. Likewise, Arg-194 in EL2, Thr-490 in EL5, and His-571 in EL6 were each replaced, one at a time, with lysine. All of these mutations were subcloned into the eK-less mutant, and the entire mutagenized region was sequenced (Table I). Only one free cysteine residue, Cys-109 in EL1, is predicted to lie on the extracellular surface of SERT. Previously we replaced this cysteine with alanine without any effect on transporter function (32Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1479-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Using SERT C109A as a template, specific leucine or valine residues in EL3 to EL6 were replaced with cysteine using the QuickChangeTMmutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Table I shows the individual mutations and subcloned regions. Each of the mutagenized regions was sequenced completely. Wild type and mutant transporters were expressed transiently in Intestine 407 cells (CCL-6, American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD). Confluent cells in 24-well plates were infected with recombinant vTF-7 vaccinia virus and transfected with plasmids bearing SERT cDNA under the control of the T7 promoter as described previously (34Blakely R.D. Clark J.A. Rudnick G. Amara S.G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were incubated for 16–20 h at 37 °C and then used for surface biotinylation and transport assays. Cell surface proteins were labeled with the membrane-impermeant biotinylation reagent, NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce Chemical Co.), as described previously (32Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1479-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated with NHS-SS-biotin in alkaline medium (pH 9.0), the excess reagent was quenched with glycine, and the cells were dissolved in Triton X-100 and SDS. Cell surface proteins were isolated from the cell extract with immobilized streptavidin, and the transporter was detected in the pool of surface proteins by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting using an anti-FLAG antibody (Kodak Scientific Imagine System, New Haven, CT). Western blot analysis (data not shown) indicated that none of the lysine substitution mutants was expressed at higher levels than eK-less, and one mutant, H571K, was expressed at lower levels (50% of eK-less). Consequently, an equal amount of protein from cells expressing each lysine mutant was loaded on the polyacrylamide gels. This corresponded to 65% of the cells grown in each well of a 24-well plate. Each confluent well contained approximately 0.24 mg of cell protein. To label exposed cysteine residues, cells were incubated with 1 mm MTSEA-biotin in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) for 10 min at room temperature. After washing with PBS, the labeled proteins were isolated, and biotinylated SERT was detected as for NHS-SS-biotin labeling (32Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1479-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In some experiments, the cell membrane was permeabilized by preincubation with 25 or 125 μg/ml digitonin in PBS for 4 min at room temperature. The cells were then washed with PBS before labeling. Western blot analysis (data not shown) indicated that each of the cysteine substitution mutants was expressed at a level similar to that of C109A. Consequently, an equal amount of protein from cells expressing each cysteine mutant (corresponding to 65% of the cells grown in each well of a 24-well plate) was loaded on the polyacrylamide gels. Transport of 5-HT was measured by adding 250 μl of PBS containing 20 nm 5-[3H]HT (3,500 cpm/pmol, NEN Life Science Products) to each well and incubating for 10 min at 22 °C, unless indicated otherwise. Reactions were terminated by aspiration and washing with ice-cold PBS. The cells were lysed, and the contents of each well were transferred to scintillation vials for counting as described previously (35Gu H.H. Wall S.C. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7124-7130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For studying the effect of MTSEA-biotin on transport, cells were preincubated with 1 mm MTSEA-biotin in PBS for 10 min before washing and measuring transport. Immunoblots were quantitated using an Alpha Innotech IS-1000. After background subtraction, the intensity of labeling was calculated for each mutant relative to eK-less or C109A in the same experiment. Data from three or four experiments were pooled together to give the results shown. Statistical analysis of transport was performed on data from single experiments. All transport experiments were repeated twice with essentially the same results. Four lysine residues in SERT (Fig.1, triangles) are predicted to lie in hydrophilic external loops. None of these four residues is conserved within the biogenic amine transporter family, and none is required for transport function. A mutant with these lysines replaced, designated eK-less, had normal transport activity (TableII). Although data are not shown, replacement of any one of these four residues individually also has no effect on 5-HT transport. Likewise, as reported previously, replacement of the cysteine residue at position 109 in EL1 with alanine has no effect on activity or surface expression (32Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1479-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Two other cysteine residues in EL2 behave as if they are disulfide-bonded (32Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1479-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar).Table IITransport activity of lysine mutantsMutantActivityMutantActivity% of wt% of eK-lessK399109.7 ± 8.4Q111K93.1 ± 7.9K31998.2 ± 10.2R194K86.1 ± 5.6K24393.4 ± 11.1T490K82.4 ± 0.8eK-less86.5 ± 0.5H571K89.7 ± 2.7 Open table in a new tab We tested the accessibility of residues to reagents in the extracellular medium using the biotinylating reagents MTSEA-biotin, which modifies cysteine residues (Fig. 1,squares), and NHS-SS-biotin, which modifies lysines. Cells were treated with one of these reagents to label surface cysteine or lysine residues. The cells were then solubilized in detergent, and biotinylated proteins were extracted using immobilized streptavidin. These biotinylated proteins were then analyzed by gel electrophoresis and Western blotting using an antibody directed against the FLAG epitope attached to the SERT COOH terminus. Fig.2 shows the results of such an analysis. In the first set of samples in Fig. 2, the entire cell lysate was applied to the gel, using cells expressing wild type SERT (first lane, far left) and the eK-less (second lane) and C109A (third lane) mutants. Both mutants were expressed at levels similar to that of wild type SERT. The second set of samples was from cells treated with MTSEA-biotin. In contrast to the pattern of total cell lysates, much more wild type SERT (seventh lane) than C109A (fourth lane) was extracted by streptavidin. This is apparent for both the mature form of the transporter at 97 kDa and for the immature forms at 60–66 kDa. Thus the single cysteine at position 109 is responsible for the reactivity of SERT to external MTSEA-biotin. Likewise, when NHS-SS-biotin was the labeling reagent, the wild type (far right lane) was extracted much better than eK-less (eighth lane), indicating that the four lysine residues replaced in eK-less are responsible for the reactivity toward NHS-SS-biotin. The transmembrane localization of MTSEA-biotin and NHS-SS-biotin reactivity with SERT was examined by labeling cells permeabilized with digitonin. In addition to the cysteine and lysine residues replaced in C109A and eK-less mutants, many cysteine and lysine residues remain in the COOH- and NH2-terminal regions and in hydrophilic loops predicted to face the cytoplasm (Fig. 1). Some or all of these cysteine residues in C109A react with MTSEA-biotin in cells permeabilized with 25 or 125 μg/ml digitonin (Fig. 2, fifth and sixth lanes). Similarly, internal lysines react with NHS-SS-biotin in digitonin-permeabilized cells expressing eK-less (ninth andtenth lanes). Although not shown in this experiment, digitonin did not cause labeling of these bands in untransfected cells. Thus, labeling of SERT in intact cells appears to occur predominantly on the external surface of the transporter. To take advantage of the external labeling by these reagents, we generated a series of mutant transporters containing a single predicted external lysine or cysteine. All of these mutants were functional for transport (Tables II and III), indicating that they were folded properly and expressed on the cell surface at similar levels. This was supported by preliminary measurements of surface labeling in the lysine mutants, all of which contained Cys-109, with MTSEA-biotin (data not shown) and of C109A with NHS-SS-biotin (32Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1479-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar).Table IIITransport activity of loop cysteine mutants before and after MTSEA-biotinMutantsActivityRemaining after MTSEA treatment% of C109A%V310C96.9 ± 0.595.1L406C111.1 ± 4.390.0V489C56.1 ± 4.176.1L564C93.6 ± 15.338.7 Open table in a new tab Of the four lysine residues in the predicted external loops, we generated three mutants, each with only one of the original lysine residues (Table II). Fig.3 A shows the results of an NHS-SS-biotin labeling experiment with wild type SERT, eK-less, and mutants with lysine at positions 243 (EL2), 319 (EL3), and 399 (EL4). The presence of a single lysine residue in any of these positions increased NHS-SS-biotin labeling over that of eK-less, suggesting that each of these positions was accessible from the cell exterior. Fig.3 B shows the combined results from three such experiments. Although the magnitude of the effect is not the same, each lysine insertion leads to a 2–3-fold increase in labeling relative to the eK-less mutant. These results support the placement of EL2, EL3, and EL4 on the external surface of the transporter. To examine the remaining predicted external loops, residues in EL1, EL2, EL5, and EL6 of eK-less were replaced with lysine (Table II). Glu-111 in EL1 corresponds to the position of a lysine in rat GABA and human norepinephrine transporters. Thr-490 in EL5 was selected because human SERT has a lysine at this position. His-571 in EL6 corresponds to a lysine residue in the GABA transporter. In addition, because the preexisting Lys-243 near the end of EL2 was accessible (Fig. 3), we tested Arg-194 near the beginning of EL2 by replacing it with lysine (see Fig. 1). All of the mutants with a lysine insertion at these sites retained transport activity similar to that of eK-less (Table II). Each new lysine insertion mutant was tested for reactivity to NHS-SS-biotin. The labeling intensity varied among mutants, but each of the new lysine residues caused the transporter to be labeled more heavily (Fig. 4 A). For Q111K and R194K, the average labeling in a series of three experiments was more than three times that of the eK-less mutant (Fig. 4 B), suggesting that EL1 and the initial part of EL2 are both accessible to e"
https://openalex.org/W2166747313,"Despite intensive interest in understanding the differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), no information is available about differential regulation of ion channels in these cells. Since expression of the L-type Ca2+ channel can be influenced by differentiation in other cell types, we tested the hypothesis that the L-type (C class) channel is a specific differentiation marker of VSMC and that expression of these channels depends on the state of cell differentiation. We used rat aortic (A7r5) VSMC, which express functional L-type Ca2+ channels, and induced dedifferentiation by cell culture in different media. Treatment with retinoic acid was used to redifferentiate the VSMC. We characterized the differentiated state of the cells by using immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis for smooth muscle (SM) alpha-actin and SM-myosin heavy chain (MHC). The number of functional Ca2+ channels was significantly decreased in dedifferentiated VSMC and increased upon differentiation with retinoic acid. Ca2+ channel function was assessed by whole-cell voltage clamp techniques. Using Western blot and dihydropyridine binding analysis, we found that the expression of the Ca2+ channel alpha1 subunit, and to a lesser extent the beta2 subunit, was directly correlated with the expression of SM alpha-actin and SM-MHC. We conclude that expression of L-type Ca2+ channel alpha1 subunits, and thus a functional Ca2+ channel, is highly coordinated with expression of the SM-specific proteins required for specialized smooth muscle cell functions. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that the L-type Ca2+ channel is a novel marker for differentiation of VSMC. The data suggest that regulation of ion channel expression during differentiation may have physiological importance for normal smooth muscle function and may influence VSMC behavior under pathophysiological conditions."

Flow cytometric analysis revealed that ET-1 did not inhibit the cell cycle progression after the release of the block but caused a significant increase of the hypodiploid cell population that is characteristic of apoptotic cell death. ET-1-induced apoptosis was confirmed by the appearance of chromatin condensation on nuclear staining and DNA fragmentation on gel electrophoresis. The increase in the hypodiploid cell peak was manifest within 16 h of exposure to 5 nm ET-1. Within the same time range, ET-1 caused actin reorganization and drastic morphological changes of the surviving cells from epithelioid to an elongated bipolar shape. These phenotypical changes were preceded by ET-1-induced increase and nuclear accumulation of the tumor suppressor protein p53. All of these effects of ET-1 were mediated by ETB via a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein. Flow cytometric analysis with fluorescent dye-labeled ET-1 revealed up-regulation of ETB expressed by the cells in G1/early S phases, and overexpression of the receptor protein by cDNA microinjection conferred the responsiveness (both apoptosis and morphological changes) to ET-1 irrespective of the position of the cell in the cell cycle. These results indicated the presence of ETB-mediated signaling pathways to apoptotic cell machinery and cytoskeletal organization. Furthermore, the densities of ETB expressed by individual A375 melanoma cells appeared to be regulated by a cell cycle-dependent mechanism, and the receptor density can be a limiting factor to control the apoptotic and cytoskeletal responses of the cells to ET-1.

Nature. 1990; 348: 732-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (2353) Google Scholar). Subsequent to the identification of ET-1 as a potent vasoconstrictive peptide (4Yanagisawa M. Kurihara H. Kimura S. Tomobe Y. Kobayashi M. Mitsui Y. Yazaki Y. Goto K. Masaki T. Nature. 1988; 332: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (10163) Google Scholar), numerous studies described their diverse biological effects on target cells (reviewed in Ref. 5Masaki T. Yanagisawa M. Goto K. Med. Res. Rev. 1992; 12: 391-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), and from these studies has emerged the recognition of ETs as one of the growth factors on definite cell lineages. ET-1 has been reported to stimulate DNA synthesis and proliferation of a variety of cells such as smooth muscle cells, glomerular mesangial cells, osteoblasts, fibroblasts, and mature melanocytes (reviewed in Ref. 6Rubanyi G.M. Polokoff M.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 325-415PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the predominant expression of ETA by these cell types and also because of the mitogenic signaling by ETA in transfected cells (7Sugawara F. Ninomiya H. Okamoto Y. Miwa S. Mazda O. Katsura Y. Masaki T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 447-457PubMed Google Scholar), it is generally accepted that ETA transmits a positive signal to the cell growth. In contrast, despite the diverse distribution of ETB both in tissues and cell lines, there are only a few reports in the literature that provided circumstantial evidence for the mitogenic signaling transmitted by ETB (8Takagi Y. Fukase M. Tanaka S. Yoshimi H. Tokunaga O. Fujita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 9Vigne P. Marsault R. Breittmayer J.P. Frelin C.

Jouneax C. Mavier P. Lotersztajn S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) revealed ETB-mediated growth suppression of hepatic Ito cells in their myofibroblastic phenotype, demonstrating the ability of ETB to transmit a signal to the cell growth that is completely opposite to that transmitted by ETA. Gene targeting revealed the critical role of ETB in embryonic development of melanocytes (11Hosoda K. Hammer R.E. Richardson J.A. Baynash A.G. Chenug J.C. Gialid A. Yanagisawa M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1267-1276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies on primary cultured melanocyte precursor cells revealed multiple roles of ETB in growth/differentiation of the cells that apparently differ between the differentiation stages of the cells (12Reid K. Turnley A.M. Maxwell G.D. Kurihara Y. Kurihara H. Barlett P.F. Murphy M. Development. 1996; 122: 3911-3919PubMed Google Scholar). In keeping with these findings, various human melanoma cell lines have been shown to express this receptor subtype (13Yohn J. Smith C. Stevens T. Hoffman T.A. Morelli J.G. Hurt D.L. Yanagisawa M.

Recently, two GPCRs for peptide ligands, namely angiotensin II receptor type 2 (ATII2) and somatostatin receptor 3 (SSTR3), have been shown to transmit growth inhibitory effects associated with programmed cell death or apoptosis of the target cells (15Yamada T.

Because of the critical involvement of apoptosis in the cellular differentiation (18Jacobson M.D. Weil M. Raff M.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 347-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2383) Google Scholar), given the multiple roles of ETB on growth/differentiation of melanocyte-precursor cells and the heterogeneity of melanoma cell lines, we postulated that ETB may cause a growth inhibitory effect on some of the melanoma cell lines. In the initial screening on the three human melanoma cell lines A375, MeWo and HM3KO, we found that ET-1 caused a growth inhibitory effect only on A375. Therefore, the current study was conducted to characterize the growth inhibitory effect of ET-1 on this cell line. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and fetal calf serum (FCS) were from Life Technologies Inc. (Tokyo, Japan); synthetic human ET-1 and ET-3, BQ123, and BQ788 were from the Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan); 125I-ET-1 (74 TBq/mmol), [γ-32P]ATP (220 TBq/mmol), FluoroLinkTM Cy2 Reactive Dye-Pack, and Cy2-avidin were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Buckinghamshire, UK); EASYTAGTM Express Protein labeling mix 35S (43.5 TBq/mmol) was from NEN Life Science Products (Tokyo, Japan); pertussis toxin (PTX) was from Funakoshi Co. (Tokyo, Japan); Texas Red-phalloidin was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR); mouse monoclonal anti-α-tubulin antibody was from MONOSAN (Uden, Netherlands); mouse monoclonal anti-p53 antibody (DO-1) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). All other chemicals were of reagent grade and were obtained commercially. A375 human melanoma cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). The cells were routinely maintained in DMEM, 10% FCS at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. They were passaged twice a week at the ratio of 1:5 to keep an exponentially growing state. The substratum was cell culture grade plasticware (Costar, Cambridge, MA) except for the use of poly-l-lysine-coated glass-bottom culture dishes (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA) for immunocytochemical experiments. Cell cycle synchronization was achieved by two sequential thymidine blocks according to the procedures described by Steinet al. (19Stein G.S. Stein J.L. Lian J.B. Last T.J. Owen T. McCabe L. Studzinski G.P. Cell Growth and Apoptosis. Oxford University Press, New York1995: 193-203Google Scholar). In brief, cells in the exponential growth phase were exposed to 2.5 mm thymidine in DMEM, 10% FCS for 16 h and then incubated in the fresh medium for 10 h. The cells were once again exposed to 2.5 mm thymidine for 16 h, and the block was released by replacing the medium to fresh DMEM, 1% FCS. Where indicated, the cells were exposed to 400 ng/ml PTX during the last 2 h of the second thymidine block. As an alternative method of cell synchronization, a plant amino acid mimosine was used according to the procedures described by Krek and DeCaprio (20Krek W. DeCaprio J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 114-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were exposed to 0.1 mm mimosine in DMEM, 10% FCS for 18 h, and the block was released by replacing the medium with fresh DMEM, 1% FCS. Binding assays on attached cells were done according to the procedures described (3Sakurai T. Yanagisawa M. Takuwa H. Miyazaki H. Kimura S. Goto K. Masaki T. Nature. 1990; 348: 732-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (2353) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. In brief, for saturation isotherms, cells at ∼50% confluence in 48-well plates were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then incubated at 4 °C for 60 min in 0.25 ml of PBS, 0.2% BSA containing increasing concentrations (5–300 pm) of 125I-ET-1. After washing the cells with PBS, the radioactivity associated with the cells was recovered in 0.1 n NaOH and counted in a γ-counter. Nonspecific binding was defined as the binding in the presence of 100 nm unlabeled ET-1 and was always less than 10% of the total binding capacity. For displacement experiments, the cells were incubated with 100 pm125I-ET-1 and increasing concentrations (100 pm to 1 μm) of an unlabeled peptide. Asynchronous or phase-synchronized cells at ∼50% confluence in 96-well plates were incubated for 24 h in DMEM, 1% FCS containing increasing concentrations of ET-1. The number of viable cells in each well was estimated by measurement of the rate of mitochondrial metabolism of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) using a cell proliferation assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For cell cycle analysis, cells were washed with PBS, harvested by trypsinization, fixed in 70% ethanol, and then labeled with propidium iodide (PI) by incubation for 30 min at room temperature in PBS containing 50 μg/ml PI and 1 mg/ml ribonuclease A. The DNA content per nucleus was analyzed by a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson Co., Mansfield, MA). For p53 immunostaining, the harvested cells were fixed first in 1% paraformaldehyde and then in 70% ethanol. The cells were labeled with anti-p53 antibody followed by staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG and then subjected to flow cytometry. For Cy2-ET-1 binding, cells were harvested by scraping and fixed in 100% methanol. After washing with PBS, 0.2% BSA, the cells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the same medium containing Cy2-ET-1 at the indicated concentrations. The cells were washed with PBS, 0.2% BSA, and the fluorescence associated with each cell was analyzed. Cy2-ET-1 was prepared by using FluoroLinkTM Cy2 ReactiveDye-Pack (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described (21Okamoto Y. Ninomiya H. Tanioka M. Sakamoto A. Miwa S. Masaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272 (21586): 21589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). For Texas Red phalloidin/anti-α-tubulin double staining, cells in poly-l-lysine-coated glass-bottom dishes were washed with PBS, fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde/PBS at room temperature for 10 min, and permeabilized in acetone at −20 °C for 10 min. The following procedures were done at room temperature. After blocking in PBS, 3% BSA, Texas Red-phalloidin and anti-α-tubulin antibody were simultaneously applied for 30 min in the same medium. The cells were further treated with biotinylated anti-mouse IgG followed by Cy2-avidin and then mounted in fluoromount G (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc., Birmingham, AL). Fluorescent images of the cells were obtained with a MRC1024 laser-scanning confocal microscope (Bio-Rad, Osaka, Japan). For p53 immunostaining, fixed and permeabilized cells were stained with anti-p53 antibody in PBS for 30 min and then processed in exactly the same way. DNA staining with PI of the fixed cells were done as described above for the flow cytometry. Isolation of DNA and analysis by agarose gel electrophoresis were done as described (22Ramachandra S. Studzinski G.P. Studzinski G.P. Cell Growth and Apoptosis. Oxford University Press, New York1995: 119-142Google Scholar). In brief, cells were lysed by incubation at 50 °C for 12 h in the lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 25 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, and 0.2 mg/ml proteinase K). DNA was extracted once with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol and twice with chloroform/isoamyl alcohol. After ethanol precipitation and resuspension, 10 μg of DNA samples were subjected to 1.2% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized under UV light. During the last 7 h of the second thymidine block, the cells in 60-mm dishes were washed with PBS and, after a preincubation in methionine/cysteine (Met/Cys)-free DMEM for 20 min, were pulse-labeled for 1.5 h with [35S]Met/Cys (50 μCi/ml) in the same medium supplemented with 10% FCS. The cells were then chased for 4.5 h in the same medium. All the medium used contained 2.5 mmthymidine to keep the cell cycle blocked. The cells were then incubated in DMEM, 1% FCS with or without ET-1. At the indicated time, the cells were washed in PBS and then harvested in 0.25 ml of the lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1% SDS). p53 in the cell lysate was recovered by immunoprecipitation with anti-p53 antibody and protein A-Sepharose 4B (Zymed, South San Francisco). The recovered proteins were dissolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the autoradiograph was developed by BAS2000 image analyzer. The entire coding sequence of human ETB (hETB) (23Sakamoto A. Yanagisawa M. Sakurai T. Takuwa Y. Yanagisawa H. Masaki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 656-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) was subcloned into a mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, San Diego) to give pEhETB. pEGFP-N1, an expression plasmid of green fluorescent protein (GFP), was obtained fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). The plasmid DNAs were prepared at 100 ng/μl in PBS and injected into the cell nucleus using a Zeiss microinjection system (Carl Zeiss, Tokyo, Japan). The relative ET-1 binding capacities of cDNA-injected cells were estimated by Cy5-ET-1 binding assay (21Okamoto Y. Ninomiya H. Tanioka M. Sakamoto A. Miwa S. Masaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272 (21586): 21589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) followed by a densitometric analysis of the fluorescent images. Cy5-ET-1 was used instead of Cy2-ET-1 to discriminate from the GFP fluorescence. In brief, 5 h after the injection, the cells were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h in the binding buffer (140 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mmNa2HPO4, 1 mm MgCl2, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 11.7 mm glucose, 0.1% BSA) containing 10 nm Cy5-ET-1. Unbound ligand was washed, and the fluorescent images (a series of 10 horizontal sections from the cell top to the bottom) were obtained with MRC1024. On each section, the region of interest was set to include individual cells, and the Cy5 fluorescent intensities (256 degrees in each pixel) associated with each cells were summed up to give a parameter that represented the Cy5-ET-1 binding capacities of individual cells. Where necessary, statistical analysis was done by analysis of variance. Melanoma cell lines are classified according to the differentiation stages assessed by morphology, expression of cell-surface marker antigens, and pigmentation (24Houghton A.N. Real F.X. Davis L.J. Cardo C.C. Old L.J. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 164: 812-829Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar), and A375 cell line belongs to a relatively undifferentiated class because of the epithelioid shape, expression of HLA-DR antigen, lack of gp100 antigen, and lack of pigmentation. 2M. Okazawa and H. Ninomiya, unpublished observations.Saturation isotherms with 125I-ET-1 revealed that, under the routine culture conditions, the cells express ET-1 binding sites with K d values of 31 ± 1 pm andB max values of 3.2 ± 0.1 × 103 per cell (means ± S.E., n = 3) (Fig. 1 a). The complete and partial displacements of the binding by BQ788 (an ETB-selective antagonist; Ref. 25Ishikawa K. Ihara M. Noguchi K. Mase N. Saeki T. Fukuroda T. Fukami T. Ozaki S. Nagase T. Nishikibe M. Yano M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4892-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar) and BQ123 (an ETA-selective antagonist; Ref. 26Ihara M. Noguchi K. Saeki T. Fukuroda T. Tsuchida S. Kimura S. Fukami T. Ishikawa K. Nishikibe M. Yano M. Life Sci. 1992; 50: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar), respectively, indicated the predominant expression of ETB (Fig. 1 b). From the biphasic displacement curve of ET-3 (whose affinity to ETA is lower than that of ET-1), the ratio of the densities of ETA and ETB was roughly estimated to be 1:4 (Fig. 1 b). Initial examination of the effect of ET-1 on A375 cell growth was done by measurement of the mitochondrial metabolism of the dye MTT which depends both on the number and viability of the cells. When applied to asynchronous cells in serum-free DMEM, ET-1 neither stimulates nor inhibits the cell growth within 24 h incubation (data not shown), but it caused a weak but significant inhibition of the FCS (1%)-dependent cell growth (Fig. 2 a). In light of the cell cycle dependence of growth inhibition by somatostatin (16Srikant C.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 400-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), we tested several synchronization procedures and found that the inhibitory effect of ET-1 was markedly enhanced when ET-1 was applied to the cells synchronized at G1/S boundary by double thymidine blocks (Fig. 2 a). The growth inhibitory effect of ET-1 (5 nm) was completely blocked by BQ788 (1 μm) but not by BQ123 (1 μm) (Fig.2 a). Flow cytometric analysis revealed that ET-1 (5 nm) did not inhibit the FCS (1%)-dependent cell cycle progression after the release of the block up to 24 h, but it caused a significant increase of the hypodiploid cell peak (Fig.2 b) that is a characteristic feature of cells undergoing apoptosis (27Darzynkiewicz Z. Bruno S. Bino G.D. Gorczyca W. Hotz M.A. Lassota P. Traganos F. Cytometry. 1992; 13: 795-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1897) Google Scholar). Time course analysis showed a 16-h time lag for ET-1 to cause a significant increase in the hypodiploid peak (Fig.2 c). ET-1-induced apoptosis was confirmed by the appearance of chromatin condensation on nuclear staining (Fig.3 a) and that of DNA fragmentation on gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3 b). All of these effects of ET-1 (5 nm) were blocked by BQ788 (1 μm) but not by BQ123 (1 μm) (Figs.2 d and 3 b). Treatment of the cells with PTX prior to the stimulation (400 ng/ml for 2 h) completely abolished the effect of ET-1 (Figs. 2 d and 3 b). In separate experiments using asynchronous cells, flow cytometric analysis failed to detect the hypodiploid peak regardless of the presence or absence of ET-1 (data not shown). Collectively, these results demonstrated that, when A375 cells were synchronized at G1/S boundary and then allowed to proceed the cell cycle, ET-1 inhibited the cell growth by inducing apoptosis and that the effect was transmitted by ETB via a PTX-sensitive G protein.Figure 3ET-1-induced chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation. a, nuclear staining with PI. Phase-synchronized cells in glass-bottom dishes were incubated for 16 h in DMEM, 1% FCS with or without 5 nm ET-1. The cells were fixed and stained with PI, and fluorescent images were obtained by confocal microscopy. Arrowheads indicate cells with condensed chromatin. b, DNA fragmentation. Phase-synchronized cells were incubated for 16 h in DMEM, 1% FCS. The medium contained no drug (lane 1), 5 nm ET-1 (lane 2), 5 nm ET-1 with 1 μmBQ123 (lane 3), or BQ788 (lane 4). In separate experiments, the cells were treated with PTX (400 ng/ml) during the last 2 h of the second thymidine block and then were incubated for 24 h in DMEM, 1% FCS with 5 nm ET-1 (lane 5). The cellular DNA was extracted and separated on 1.2% agarose gel as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Molecular sizes are given on the right (in kilobase pairs). Shown are the representative results from three independent determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Microscopic observation of the culture bed revealed that, when applied to the synchronized cells, ET-1 induced distinct morphological changes of the surviving cells. Within 12 h of stimulation with ET-1 (5 nm), more than 70% of the cells began to extend cytoplasmic processes that contained bundles of filamentous actin (stained with Texas Red-phalloidin) (Fig.4 b). After 24 h stimulation, the cells were apparently bipolar and elongated in shape and lost the bundles of filamentous actin (Fig. 4 c). In contrast, a mesh-like organization of microtubules radiating from the centrosome in control cells (stained with anti-αtubulin antibody) was apparently maintained in ET-1-stimulated cells (Fig. 4,d–f). These effects of ET-1 on the actin reorganization were blocked by BQ788 but not by BQ123 and were also blocked by pretreatment of the cells with PTX (data not shown). In separate experiments using asynchronous cells, less than 5% of the cells in the culture bed underwent the morphological changes in response to ET-1 (5 nm for 24 h) (not shown). Because of the well documented role of the tumor suppressor protein p53 in apoptotic cell death (28Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6673) Google Scholar) and the somatostatin-induced increase of p53 in SSTR3-expressing cells (17Sharma K. Patel Y.C. Srikant B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1688-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of ET-1 on the expression level and subcellular localization of this transcription factor in A375 cells. A375 cells have been reported to express only the wild-type p53 (29Kroumpouzos G. Eberle J. Garbe C. Orfanos C.E. Pigm. Cell Res. 1994; 7: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). When applied to the phase-synchronized cells, ET-1 caused a significant increase in p53 level as revealed by flow cytometry, and time course analysis showed that at least a 12-h exposure was required to cause the increase (Fig.5 a). The ET-1-induced increase was blocked by BQ788 and also by pretreatment of the cells with PTX (Fig. 5 b). Immunocytochemical analysis revealed ET-1-induced nuclear accumulation of p53 (Fig. 5 c) that was blocked by BQ788 and also by pretreatment of the cells with PTX (data not shown). Time course analysis showed that at least 6 h incubation was required for ET-1 to cause the translocation of p53 (data not shown). In an attempt to detect earlier changes in p53 metabolism, we conducted metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation of the p53 protein. In accordance with the results of flow cytometry, there was no detectable increase in p53 protein level in ET-1-stimulated samples within 3 h incubation (Fig. 5 d). After 2 h incubation, however, there appeared high molecular weight forms of the p53 most likely due to ubiquitination of the molecule (30Shkedy D. Gonen H. Bercovich B. Ciechanover A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 31Maki C.G. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2649-2654PubMed Google Scholar), and ET-1 caused apparent reduction of the high molecular weight forms (Fig. 5 d). Despite repeated trials, we failed to demonstrate an increased survival of 35S-labeled p53 after a long term treatment with ET-1 (16 and 24 h), most likely due to the ET-1-induced apoptosis and hence the decrease of the total number of the cells in a well (data not shown). In separate experiments using asynchronous cells, ET-1 failed to affect the expression level and subcellular localization of p53 regardless of the presence or absence of FCS (data not shown). All of the effects of ET-1 on A375 cells described above were rather specific for the cells that were synchronized at G1/S boundary by double thymidine blocks and then allowed to undergo the cell cycle. In an attempt to explore the cell cycle-dependent modulation of ETB signaling, we examined the differences in receptor densities between the phases of the cell cycle. For this purpose, the receptor densities on individual cells were assessed by the binding of Cy2-labeled ET-1 and flow cytometry. Cy2-ET-1 binding capacities were highest in cells arrested at the G1/S boundary and gradually decreased as the cells underwent the cycle after the release of the block (Fig. 6 a) to reach the level of those in asynchronous cells (not shown) at 24 h. The average Cy2 fluorescent intensities from the phase-synchronized cells were 5.2 ± 1.4-fold (mean ± S.E., n = 3) higher than those from asynchronous cells. This increase in Cy2-ET-1 binding capacities reflected an increase of ETB because the bind"

There has been considerable success in preventing the rejection of transplanted organs, and further improvements in the outcome of transplantation are in prospect. However, the main limitation on the fullest possible use of organ transplantation is the shortage of donated human organs. One solution to this problem would be xenotransplantation, the use of animals instead of humans as the source of organs and tissues for transplant. The immunological barriers to this procedure are now well defined and this review describes the various strategies that are being developed to try to overcome them."
https://openalex.org/W1588650347,"One of the functions of surface CD38 is the induction of phosphorylation of discrete cytoplasmic substrates and mobilization of cytoplasmic calcium (Ca2+). The present work addresses the issue of whether the signaling mediated via CD38 operates through an independent pathway or, alternatively, is linked to the TCR/CD3 signaling machinery. We studied the signals elicited through CD38 by the specific agonistic IB4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) by monitoring the levels of cytoplasmic Ca2+ and the induced phenotypic and functional variations in T cell growth. IB4 mAb presented the unique ability to increase cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels, which correlated with the phosphorylation of the PLC-γ1. These effects were blocked by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and were dependent on the presence of a functional TCR/CD3 surface complex, no effects being recorded on mutant Jurkat cells lacking part of the CD3 structures. CD38 signaling appeared to share with TCR/CD3 the ability to induce apoptotic cell death in Jurkat T cells, an event paralleled by specific up-regulation of the Fas molecule and inhibited by cyclosporin A. CD28, a costimulatory molecule, is synergized by increasing CD38-induced apoptotic cell death. The results indicate the existence of a strong functional interdependence between CD38 and TCR/CD3."
https://openalex.org/W2090061341,"We have analyzed the histone acetyltransferase enzymes obtained from a series of yeast hat1,hat2, and gcn5 single mutants andhat1,hat2 and hat1,gcn5 double mutants. Extracts prepared from both hat1 and hat2mutant strains specifically lack the following two histone acetyltransferase activities: the well known cytoplasmic type B enzyme and a free histone H4-specific histone acetyltransferase located in the nucleus. The catalytic subunits of both cytoplasmic and nuclear enzymes have identical molecular masses (42 kDa), the same as that of HAT1. However, the cytoplasmic complex has a molecular mass (150 kDa) greater than that of the nuclear complex (110 kDa). The possible functions of HAT1 and HAT2 in the yeast nucleus are discussed. In addition, we have detected a yeast histone acetyltransferase not previously described, designated HAT-A4. This enzyme is located in the nucleus and is able to acetylate free and nucleosome-bound histones H3 and H4. Finally, we show that the hat1,gcn5 double mutant is viable and does not exhibit a new phenotype, thus suggesting the existence of several histone acetyltransferases with overlapping functions."
https://openalex.org/W2002870564,"The tripeptide glutathione (GSH) is the predominant low molecular weight thiol reductant in mammalian cells. In this report, we show that at concentrations at which GSH is typically present in the intracellular milieu, GSH and the oxidized GSH derivatives GSH disulfide (GSSG) and glutathione sulfonate each irreversibly inactivate up to 100% of the activity of purified Ca2+- and phosphatidylserine (PS)-dependent protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes in a concentration-dependent manner by a novel nonredox mechanism that requires neither glutathiolation of PKC nor the reduction, formation, or isomerization of disulfide bridges within PKC. Our evidence for a nonredox mechanism of PKC inactivation can be summarized as follows. GSSG antagonized the Ca2+- and PS-dependent activity of purified rat brain PKC with the same efficacy (IC50 = 3 mm) whether or not the reductant dithiothreitol was present. Glutathione sulfonate, which is distinguished from GSSG and GSH by its inability to undergo disulfide/thiol exchange reactions, was as effective as GSSG in antagonizing Ca2+- and PS-dependent PKC catalysis. The irreversibility of the inactivation mechanism was indicated by the stability of the inactivated form of PKC to dilution and extensive dialysis. The inactivation mechanism did not involve the nonspecific phenomena of denaturation and aggregation of PKC because it obeyed pseudo-first order kinetics and because the hinge region of PKC-α remained a preferential target of tryptic attack following GSH inactivation. The selectivity of GSH in the inactivation of PKC was also indicated by the lack of effect of the tripeptides Tyr-Gly-Gly and Gly-Ala-Gly on the activity of PKC. Furthermore, GSH antagonism of the Ser/Thr kinase casein kinase 2 was by comparison weak (<25%). Inactivation of PKC-α was not accompanied by covalent modification of the isozyme by GSH or other irreversible binding interactions between PKC-α and the tripeptide, but it was associated with an increase in the susceptibility of PKC-α to trypsinolysis. Treatment of cultured rat fibroblast and human breast cancer cell lines withN-acetylcysteine resulted in a substantial loss of Ca2+- and PS- dependent PKC activity in the cells within 30 min. These results suggest that GSH exerts negative regulation over cellular PKC isozymes that may be lost when oxidative stress depletes the cellular GSH pool.

The PKC family consists of Ca2+-dependent, phorbol ester-activated isozymes (α, β1, β2, and γ), Ca2+-independent, phorbol ester-activated isozymes (δ, ε, η, Θ, and μ), and Ca2+- and phorbol ester-independent isozymes (ζ and λ). Phosphatidylserine (PS) dependence is universal among PKC isozymes (1Blobe G.C. Stribling S. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Cancer Surv. 1996; 27: 213-248PubMed Google Scholar, 5Newton A.C. Curr. Opin.

The susceptibility of PKC isozymes to inactivation by anS-thiolating peptide-substrate analog suggests that PKC activity might also be subject to redox regulation by the endogenous molecule glutathione (18Ward N.E.

The tripeptide glutathione (GSH),l-γ-glutamyl-l-cysteinyl-glycine, is the predominant low molecular weight thiol reductant in mammalian cells (19Meister A. Anderson M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 711-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (6000) Google Scholar). Protein S-glutathiolation, i.e. the formation of a disulfide-linked protein-GSH complex, is a selective protein modification that can be induced in cells by mild oxidative stress (20Thomas J.A. Poland B. Honzatko R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). GSH disulfide (GSSG) has been shown to oxidatively regulate the function of several purified enzymes, including carbonic anhydrase III, aldose reductase, and HIV-1 protease byS-glutathiolation, and in each case the effects of GSSG can be fully reversed by the reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT) (21Cabiscol E.

Mammalian cells typically contain millimolar concentrations of GSH,e.g. 0.5–10 mm, and oxidized GSH generally amounts to less than 1% of the total cellular GSH content (19Meister A. Anderson M.E.

In this report, we show that at GSH concentrations typically present in the intracellular milieu, GSH and oxidized GSH derivatives irreversibly inactivate purified PKC by a novel nonredox mechanism that does not involve glutathiolation of the enzyme.

Treatment of cultured cells withN-acetylcysteine induced a substantial decline in the level of cellular PKC activity, providing evidence that the PKC inactivation mechanism observed with N-acetylcysteine and GSH in the purified enzyme system may also be operative in mammalian cells. Rat brain PKC was purified to near-homogeneity according to silver-stained polyacrylamide gels by a previously described method (27O'Brian C.A. Ward N.E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4278-4282Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The histone kinase activity of the purified PKC preparation was stimulated 10–15-fold by 0.2 mm Ca2+ and 30 μg/ml PS but was unaffected by either Ca2+ or PS alone. The purified PKC preparation is a mixture of the isozymes α, β, γ, ε, and ζ (18Ward N.E. Gravitt K.R. O'Brian C.A. J. Biol.

A fully active catalytic domain fragment of PKC was generated from the purified PKC preparation by limited trypsinolysis with a yield of >50%, as described previously (17Ward N.E. Gravitt K.R.

The histone kinase activity of the catalytic domain fragment preparation was stimulated less than 1.5-fold by Ca2+ and PS. Purified, baculovirus-produced recombinant human PKC-α was purchased from Pan Vera Corp. (Madison, WI). Immunoblot analysis of PKC-α was done as described previously (29Gravitt K.R. Ward N.E. O'Brian C.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 47: 425-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) using an ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and monoclonal anti-PKC-α (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). Dialysis of PKC-α was done as described under “Results,” using a 0.5–3 ml Slide-A-Lyzer unit with a molecular mass cut-off of 10,000 Da. (Pierce). Electrospray ionization mass spectrometric analysis of PKC-α was done at the University of Texas-Houston Analytical Chemistry Center. Samples of purified recombinant control PKC-α and GSH-inactivated PKC-α (10 pmol/μl) were prepared for analysis by dialysis against 5% acetic acid under bubbling nitrogen for 48 h. Horse skeletal muscle apomyoglobin (16951.5 Da) and bovine serum albumin (66430.3 Da) served as standard proteins and were analyzed in parallel. The accuracy of molecular masses determined from the spectra was within ±20 Da.

[γ-32P]ATP and peroxidase-linked sheep anti-mouse Ig were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and [3H]glutathione was from NEN Life Science Products. Frozen rat brains were obtained from Harlan Sprague-Dawley (Indianapolis, IN). Protein assay solutions and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis reagents, including molecular mass markers, were obtained from Bio-Rad. Go6976 was purchased from Calbiochem. MCF7-MDR cells and R6-PKC3 fibroblasts were kindly provided by Dr. Kenneth Cowan (National Institutes of Health) and Dr. I. Bernard Weinstein (Columbia University, NY), respectively, and tissue culture reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. GSH, glutathione disulfide (GSSG), glutathione sulfonic acid (GSO3), histone IIIS, PS, ATP, DTT, l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, DEAE-Sepharose, and all other reagents were purchased from Sigma. The Ca2+- and PS-dependent histone kinase activity of purified PKC was measured as described previously (28Ward N.E. O'Brian C.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11903-11909Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The histone kinase reaction mixture (120 μl) contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 30 μg/ml PS (or none), 6 μm [γ-32P]ATP (5000–8000 cpm/pmol), 0.67 mg/ml histone III-S, and 5 ng of purified PKC. In indicated experiments, histone was replaced with the synthetic peptide substrate RKRTLRRL (20 μm) (28Ward N.E. O'Brian C.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11903-11909Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). A 10-min reaction period at 30 °C, which yields linear kinetics, was initiated by the addition of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was terminated on phosphocellulose paper, and histone (or peptide) phosphorylation was quantitated as described previously (28Ward N.E. O'Brian C.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11903-11909Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). GSX (GSH, GSSG, or GSO3) was added to PKC assay mixtures as described under “Results.” In some experiments, PKC or its catalytic domain fragment was preincubated with GSX alone for 5 min at 30 °C and then briefly kept on ice prior to its addition to assay mixtures. The preincubation mixtures were diluted 12–30-fold into assay mixtures as specified under “Results.” In other experiments, PKC and GSX were added directly to PKC assay mixtures as separate components. All assays were performed in triplicate and expressed as the mean value ± S.D. Purified casein kinase 2 and a casein kinase 2 assay kit were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Casein kinase 2 was assayed by monitoring the phosphorylation of the synthetic peptide substrate RRRDDDSDDD according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Each reaction mixture contained 20 ng of casein kinase 2. Human breast cancer MCF7-MDR cells and rat R6-PKC3 fibroblasts were chosen for analysis because they express levels of Ca2+- and PS-dependent PKC activity that can be measured accurately by assays of DEAE-extracted cell lysates. The abundance of Ca2+- and PS-dependent PKC activity is primarily due to enforced expression of PKC-β1 in the R6-PKC3 cells (30Housey G.M. Johnson M.D. Hsiao W.L. O'Brian C.A. Murphy J.P.

The culture media also contained nonessential amino acids, vitamins, sodium pyruvate, l-glutamine, and penicillin-streptomycin (30Housey G.M. Johnson M.D. Hsiao W.L. O'Brian C.A. Murphy J.P.

Near-confluent cells cultured in T150 flasks (approximately 5 × 107 R6-PKC3 cells and 4 × 107 MCF7-MDR cells) were treated with N-acetylcysteine at the indicated concentration in culture medium (without serum) buffered with 80 (R6-PKC3) or 100 (MCF7-MDR) mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, for 30 min at 37 °C. The treatment conditions employed were determined to have no effect on cell viability, as measured by trypan blue exclusion. At the end of the treatment period, PKC was extracted from the cells by a previously described procedure (33Gravitt K.R. Ward N.E. Fan D. Skibber J.M. Levin B. O'Brian C.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, harvested from the flasks in ice-cold Buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 20 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 100 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm chelators (EDTA and EGTA), and 15 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and stirred for 1 h at 4 °C. All subsequent procedures were done at 4 °C. Cell lysates were centrifuged for 15 min at 13,800 × g to remove debris and then loaded onto 0.5 ml DEAE-Sepharose columns equilibrated in Buffer A. After washing each column with 3 ml Buffer A, Ca2+- and PS-dependent PKC was eluted with 2 ml of Buffer A containing 0.2 m NaCl, and the protein concentration of the eluted sample was determined (33Gravitt K.R. Ward N.E. Fan D. Skibber J.M. Levin B. O'Brian C.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Part of the sample was mixed with 2× SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer for immunoblot analysis, and the remainder was reserved for PKC assays. The assay employed for the Ca+- and PS-dependent PKC activity of the eluted samples (10 μg of sample protein/assay) was modified from the assay used with purified PKC (see above, under “Protein Kinase Assays”) as follows. The pseudosubstrate-based synthetic peptide substrate 10 μm[Ser25]PKC-(19–31) (34House C. Kemp B.E. Science. 1987; 238: 1726-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar) was employed as the phosphoacceptor substrate, the cofactor Ca2+ was present at 1 mm, and the Ca2+- and PS-dependent PKC-selective inhibitor Go6976 (35Martiny-Baron G. Kazanietz M.G. Mischak H. Blumberg P.M. Kochs G. Hug H. Marme D. Schachtele C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9194-9197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was employed at 100 nm to distinguish Ca2+- and PS-dependent PKC activity from background kinase activity. Ca2+- and PS-dependent PKC activity was calculated by subtracting the cpm obtained from assay mixtures containing Ca2+, PS, and Go6976 from the cpm obtained from assay mixtures containing Ca2+ and PS. As an initial test of whether PKC is subject to regulation by glutathiolation, we preincubated a purified rat brain PKC preparation with GSSG at the concentrations shown in Fig.1, diluted each preincubation mixture 30-fold into a PKC assay mixture, and measured the Ca2+- and PS-dependent histone kinase activity of the enzyme. Preincubation with GSSG inhibited PKC in a concentration-dependent manner, achieving 50% inhibition at about 2.6 mm GSSG and complete inhibition at ≥5.0 mm GSSG (Fig. 1, closed circles). The loss of 100% of the activity indicated that each Ca2+- and PS-dependent isozymic component of the PKC preparation was subject to inhibition by GSSG. In a control experiment, the preincubation step was omitted, and GSSG was added directly to PKC assay mixtures at the 30-fold diluted final concentration corresponding to each preincubation mixture. Under these conditions, inhibition was negligible (Fig. 1, open circles). This indicates that the inhibition of PKC achieved by GSSG in Fig. 1 (closed circles) was a result of the preincubation step and was stable when the preincubation mixture was diluted. These results were consistent with an irreversible inactivation mechanism that could involve glutathiolation of PKC. Glutathiolation of proteins is readily reversed by reducing agents, such as DTT (21Cabiscol E. Levine R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4170-4174Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 23Davis D.A. Dorsey K. Wingfield P.T. Stahl S.J. Kaufman J. Fales H.M. Levine R.L.

Biophys. 1994; 310: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). To test whether GSSG-induced inactivation of Ca2+- and PS-dependent PKC (Fig. 1,closed circles) involved PKC glutathiolation, DTT was included in the PKC/GSSG preincubation mixtures. The efficacy of GSSG in inactivating Ca2+- and PS-dependent PKC was virtually unaffected by the presence of either 100 mm DTT (Fig. 1, open triangles) or 250 mm DTT (Fig. 1,open squares) in the preincubation mixtures. We also determined that removal of the β-mercaptoethanol (5 mm) in the PKC preparation by gel filtration (17Ward N.E. Gravitt K.R. O'Brian C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8056-8060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 18Ward N.E. Gravitt K.R. O'Brian C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24193-24200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) prior to preincubation of the enzyme with GSSG had no effect on the concentration dependence of GSSG inactivation of PKC (data not shown). These results ruled out glutathiolation as the mechanism of GSSG inactivation of Ca2+- and PS-dependent PKC. We next examined whether GSH and GSO3, a GSH analog that cannot participate in thiol/disulfide exchange reactions, could inactivate Ca2+- and PS-dependent PKC. When PKC was preincubated with GSH and then diluted 30-fold into reaction mixtures, GSH inactivated PKC with roughly half the potency of GSSG, achieving 50% inactivation at about 5.1 mm GSH (Fig.2, closed triangles). No inhibition was observed if the preincubation step was omitted, and GSH was added directly to reaction mixtures at the corresponding final (30-fold diluted) concentrations (Fig. 2, open triangles), providing evidence for an irreversible inactivation mechanism. The observed potency of GSH in the inactivation of Ca2+- and PS-dependent PKC was consistent with the equivalence of 2 GSH with DTT-reduced GSSG (Figs. 1 and 2). The capacity of GSH to inactivate PKC was not merely a nonspecific effect of the free sulfhydryl of the tripeptide, because the reducing agent DTT did not inactivate PKC at concentrations as high as 250 mm (Fig.1). Furthermore, the inactivation potency of GSH could not be attributed to trace amounts of GSSG, because it was unaffected by the presence of 100 mm DTT in PKC/GSH preincubation mixtures (data not shown). We also examined the ability of GSH to inactivate a purified preparation of the Ser/Thr kinase casein kinase 2 (37Tiganis T. House C.M. Kemp B.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 325: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In these experiments, casein kinase 2 was preincubated with GSH under the conditions employed in Fig. 2, and the preincubation mixture was diluted 12-fold into casein kinase assay mixtures. Preincubation with 5 and 10 mm GSH, which effected approximately 40 and 90% inactivation of P"

The two Glu residues can be replaced with neutral or with positively charged residues without signficantly affecting enzyme activity. However, replacement of either Asp residues with Asn eliminates all but a residual level of activity, and substitution with Glu abolishes all activity.These results indicate that 1) Section C, in particular Phe288, may be involved in the second step of catalysis, 2) Tyr171 of Section A is essential for catalysis, most likely for the first reaction, 3) the two Asp residues in Section B are essential for the activity and most likely bind the substrate via magnesium salt bridges.

In mammals, the first specific step in the pathway is the conversion oftrans-farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) 1The abbreviations used are: FPP, farnesyl diphosphate; RSS, rat squalene synthase; PSPP, presqualene diphosphate; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; GGPP, geranylgeranyl diphosphate; PPPP, prephytoene diphosphate. to squalene, a reaction catalyzed by squalene synthase (farnesyl-diphosphate:farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase (EC2.5.1.21) (Fig. 1). An active, truncated form of the rat hepatic enzyme was the first mammalian squalene synthase (RSS) to be purified (1Shechter I. Klinger E. Rucker M.L. Engstrom R.G. Spirito J.A. Islam M.A. Boettcher B.R. Weinstein D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8628-8635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is a membrane-bound enzyme localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (2Stamellos K.D. Shackelford J.E. Shechter I. Jiang G. Conrad D. Keller G. Krisans S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12825-12836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA for RSS, cloned from a cDNA library, was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli (3McKenzie T.L. Jiang G. Straubhaar J.R. Conrad D.G. Shechter I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21368-21374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The full-length native protein, determined from the cDNA sequence, contains 416 residues. Using similar methodology, the human hepatic squalene synthase was cloned, and its transcriptional regulation in HepG2 cells was studied (4Jiang G. McKenzie T.L. Conrad D.G. Shechter I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12818-12824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme was also cloned in yeast by complementation (5Summers C. Karst F. Charles A.D. Gene. 1993; 136: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Squalene synthase from yeast was the first to be purified to homogeneity (6Sasiak K. Rilling H.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 260: 622-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Using partial sequence information obtained from the purified protein, the cDNA, and complementation cloning procedures, other cDNAs were cloned from additional species, includingSaccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Arabidopsis thaliana, Nicotiana benthamiana, and mouse (7Jennings S.M.

Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 30: 1139-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The sequence identity between mammalian species is 90%, whereas the identity between rat and yeast is only 44.8%. Comparison of the rat and yeast proteins revealed that three regions, referred to as Sections A, B, and C, were highly conserved and therefore likely to be essential for catalysis (3McKenzie T.L. Jiang G. Straubhaar J.R. Conrad D.G. Shechter I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21368-21374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sequences of high homology to Section A are also present in phytoene synthase from various species (13Armstrong G.A. Alberti M. Hearst J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9975-9979Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 14Misawa N. Nakagawa M. Kobayashi K. Yamano S. Izawa Y. Nakamura K. Harashima K. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6704-6712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Section B was first identified as an aspartate-rich motif in a variety of enzymes that utilize prenyl diphosphates as substrates, including phytoene synthase. This motif was proposed to bind the diphosphate moiety of the allylic substrates via a magnesium salt bridge (15Poulter C.D. Rilling H.C. Spurgeon S.L. Porter J.W. Biosynthesis of Isoprenoid Compounds. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1981: 161-224Google Scholar, 16Marrero P.F. Poulter C.D. Edwards P.A. J. Biol.

Poulter C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3044-3048Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Unlike Sections A and B, Section C of RSS has not been identified in any other proteins, including those using FPP as a substrate. This section or one highly similar to it is present in all known squalene synthase enzymes from different species (Fig.2). The 19-residue sequence is fully hydrophobic and does not contain any charged residues. It was proposed to consist of a hydrophobic helix at its C terminus and a hydrophobic β-sheet at the N terminus. These two structures are separated at Pro292 in the mammalian enzymes (3McKenzie T.L. Jiang G. Straubhaar J.R. Conrad D.G. Shechter I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21368-21374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Much of the interest in squalene synthase has been stimulated by the unique chemistry of carbon-carbon bond formation. The formation of squalene from FPP takes place via two separate reactions that represent unique and important steps in the formation of lipophilic cholesterol intermediates (Fig. 1). In the first reaction, the condensation of two molecules of FPP forms a cyclopropyl-containing intermediate, presqualene diphosphate (PSPP), through a unique 1′-2–3 prenyl transferase reaction. PSPP is then rearranged and reduced by NADPH in the second step to form squalene (15Poulter C.D. Rilling H.C. Spurgeon S.L. Porter J.W. Biosynthesis of Isoprenoid Compounds. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1981: 161-224Google Scholar, 20Rilling H.C. Poulter C.D. Epstein W.W. Larsen B. J. Am. Chem.

Phytoene is a squalene-like intermediate in the biosynthesis of carotenoids, which are produced by plants and certain bacteria. Phytoene is also synthesized in two steps (5Summers C. Karst F. Charles A.D. Gene. 1993; 136: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 24Bartley G.E. Viitanen P.V. Bacot K.O. Scolnik P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5036-5039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). In the first reaction, two molecules of geranylgeranyl diphosphate (AAPP) are condensed head-to-head to form a cyclopropyl ring-containing intermediate, prephytoene diphosphate (PPPP). This reaction is similar to the first one of squalene biosynthesis. However, in the second reaction, prephytoene diphosphate is converted to phytoene by a nonreductive rearrangement in which the diphosphate is eliminated. Thus, unlike squalene synthase, this enzyme does not require NADPH for its activity and, therefore, is not expected to contain specific NADPH binding sequences. It was also reported that, as with squalene synthase, the two steps leading to the formation of phytoene from geranylgeranyl diphosphate are catalyzed by a single enzyme (25Dogbo O. Laferrière A. D'Harlingue A. Camara B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7054-7058Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we have used site-directed mutagenesis to assess the importance of various residues in the RSS-conserved sequences. We have also investigated the possible involvement of Section C, which is unique to RSS, in catalyzing the second step of the reaction. The expression plasmid pRSS1327, an E. coli expression vector for RSS, was originally constructed by McKenzie et. al. (3McKenzie T.L. Jiang G. Straubhaar J.R. Conrad D.G. Shechter I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21368-21374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was used in these studies. This construct was expressed in the DH5α strain of E. coli(Stratagene). A VCS-M13 interference resistant helper phage was also from Stratagene. For high expression of RSS, the pTrxFus vector was used together with its host cell E. coli strain GI698 (Invitrogene). Sculptor in vitro mutagenesis system and ΔTaq Cycle Sequencing kits were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; [1-3H]FPP (143 Ci/mmol) and nonlabeledtrans-FPP were from NEN Life Science Products; restriction enzymes and T4 ligase were from New England Biolab;125I-protein A (30 mCi/mg) was from Amersham; squalene was from ICN Biochemicals. Two RSS expression vectors were used, pRSS1327 and pTrxRSS. pRSS1327, a pBluescript based vector, expresses a 52-kDa chimeric protein consisting of β-galactosidase fused to the full-length RSS protein (4 kDa of β-galactosidase and 48 kDa of RSS) and was constructed as described previously (3McKenzie T.L. Jiang G. Straubhaar J.R. Conrad D.G. Shechter I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21368-21374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). pTrxRSS was formed by subcloning of the RSS cDNA sequence in pRSS1327 into pTrxFus, utilizing theKpnI at the 5′ end and the BamHI at the 3′ end as cloning sites. Thus, pTrxRSS expressed an active fusion protein with a molecular mass of 60 kDa (12 kDa portion of thioredoxin at the N terminus and 48 kDa of RSS sequence at the C terminus). Under the same conditions, pTrxRSS expresses a 6–9-fold higher enzymic activity than pRSS1327 (see Fig. 3) and, therefore, was used as the preferred expression vector. However, since single strand DNA can not be rescued from pTrxRSS, we have utilized pRSS1327 as a shuttle vector for site-directed mutagenesis. pRSS1327 was expressed in the E. coli strain DH5α as described previously (3McKenzie T.L. Jiang G. Straubhaar J.R. Conrad D.G. Shechter I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21368-21374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tryptophan (10 μg/ml) was used for the induction of the expression of pTrxRSS in the GI698 strain of E. coli. After 4 h induction, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C and washed once with TGED buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 5% glycerol, 10 mmMgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, pH 7.9). Cells were lysed with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 5 mm CHAPS, 1.5 mg/ml lysozyme, pH 7.9) at room temperature for 30 min. Cell lysates were then stored at −80 °C overnight. After 18 h, cell lysates were quickly thawed and sonicated at 4 °C. The 5,000 × g supernatant of this RSS preparation was immediately used for further analyses. The protein concentration of RSS preparations was determined by the Bradford method using BSA for calibration (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217450) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed by the method of Laemmli (49Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207509) Google Scholar) in a mini-gel system (Bio-Rad) at 100 volts. 10% acrylamide gel was used for the separation of proteins. Pre-stained protein standards (Bio-Rad) were used for molecular weight calibration. Western blots of RSS were performed as described by Shechter et al. (1Shechter I. Klinger E. Rucker M.L. Engstrom R.G. Spirito J.A. Islam M.A. Boettcher B.R. Weinstein D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8628-8635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. After separation by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (0.22 μm) at 4 °C for 1.5 h at 100 V. The membranes were then blocked with 5% dry milk in PBST buffer (2.03 g of NaH2PO4, 11.49 g of Na2HPO4, 85 g of NaCl, and 20 ml of Tween 20 in a total volume of 1000 ml) overnight at room temperature. The blocked membranes were rinsed with PBST buffer and incubated with rabbit anti-RSS antiserum diluted 1:1000 in PBST buffer with 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. The membranes were washed with PBST buffer three times for 5 min each rinse. Radiolabeling was performed by incubating the membranes for 1 h with125I-protein A (30 mCi/mg) diluted 1:1000 in PBST buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin. The membranes were then washed three times in PBST buffer and air-dried. Immunoblots were visualized by autoradiography. Enzyme assays were performed as described previously (1Shechter I. Klinger E. Rucker M.L. Engstrom R.G. Spirito J.A. Islam M.A. Boettcher B.R. Weinstein D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8628-8635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, RSS was assayed in 96-well micro well plates. Each reaction contained 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 5.0 mm MgCl2, 5.0 mm CHAPS, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 2.0 mm NADPH, 20 μm (0.04 μCi) [1-3H]FPP, and 20 μg of RSS protein in a total volume of 100 μl. Enzyme and substrate were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C, after which the reactions were stopped by the addition of 10 μl of 1.0 m EDTA, pH 9.2. After adding 10 μl of 0.5% squalene as a carrier, half of each reaction mixture (60 μl) was analyzed by TLC chromatography. Silica gel TLC plates were developed with 5% toluene in hexane, allowing the solvent front to migrate 11 cm. Squalene was visualized by exposure to iodine vapors, and the stained bands was scraped off and counted for radioactivity. Enzyme activities are expressed in pmol of squalene formed/min/mg of protein. The construct used for the generation of the mutations is the pBluescript phagemid pRSS1327, which contains the cDNA of the entire coding region of RSS (3McKenzie T.L. Jiang G. Straubhaar J.R. Conrad D.G. Shechter I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21368-21374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). First, single strand DNA was prepared from pRSS1327 using the Sculptorin vitro Mutagenesis kit (Amersham) with minor modifications. Briefly, TG1 host cells were transformed with pRSS1327 to obtain fresh transformants. On the following day, one colony was selected and grown in 2× yeast tryptone medium for 3 h. VCS-M13 helper phage (Stratagene) was then added to the culture, and the incubation was continued for 4 h. The cells were then lysed, and the resulting single strand DNA was purified by PEG 8000 precipitation followed by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was performed as described previously (27Guan G. Dai P-H. Osborne T.F. Kim J.B. Shechter I. J. Biol Chem. 1997; 272: 10295-10302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To overcome the high GC content in the mutation site, annealing and extension of mutation primers were performed at a relatively high temperature. Therefore, the following procedure was employed. Single strand DNA and mutation primer were denatured at 94 °C for 5 min and slowly cooled to 25 °C to allow annealing. The annealed primer was then extended in a buffer containing 2 mm dithiothreitol, 6 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm each of the dNTP mixtures containing dCTPαS instead of dCTP at room temperature for 10 min. 400 units of T4 DNA ligase were added, and the reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h to allow for extension of the mutated strand and ligation. The remaining single strand oligonucleotide was removed by T5 exonuclease. The non-mutated strand was cut by NciI and digested by exonuclease III. The resulting mutated pRSS1327 DNA was used to transform XL-1 Blue competent cells. Single colonies were selected, and mutations were confirmed by sequencing. The mutated RSS cDNA was then subcloned into pTrxFus to form the expression construct pTrxRSS. The presence of the correct mutations in the pTrxRSS vector was again confirmed by sequencing. The synthetic antisense oligonucleotides that were used in this procedure and the various single amino acid mutations that were generated are as follows: Q293N, 5′-CGTAGCAATGGCCATTAC G TT TGGAATGGC-3′; Q293E, 5′-CGTAGCAATGGCCATTACCT C TGGAATGGC-3′; F288Y, 5′-CACAG T AGTTAAACACACTTTGGTTCCGGA-3′; F288W, 5′-GGAATGGCACA CC AGTTAAACACACTTTGG-3′; F288L, 5′-GGAATGGCACA C AAGTTAAACACACTTTGG-3′; F288D, 5′-GGAATGGCACAG TC GTTAAACACACTTTGG-3′; F288R, 5′-GGAATGGCACAG CG GTTAAACACACTTTGG-3′; F286Y, 5′-GGCACAGAAGTTA T ACACACTTTGGTTCCG-3′; F286W, 5′-GGCACAGAAGTT CC ACACACTTTGGTTCCG-3′; F286L, 5′-GGCACAGAAGTT C AACACACTTTGGTTCCG-3′; F286D, 5′-GGCACAGAAGTTA TC CACACTTTGGTTCCG-3′; F286R, 5′-GGCACAGAAGTTA CG CACACTTTGGTTCCG-3′; Q283N, 5′-GAAGTTAAACACACT G T T GTTCCGGAGCC-3′; Q283E, 5′-GAAGTTAAACACACTTT C GTTCCGGAGCC-3′; D219N, 5′-CCAGATAAT T ACGAATGATATTTGTTTTCTG-3′; D219E, 5′-CCAGATA C TCACGAATGATATTTGTTTTCTG3′; D223N, 5′-CCTTCTTGTTGGT T TTCCAGATAATCACG3′; D223E, 5′-CCTTCTTGTTG T TCTTCCAGATAATCACG3′; D223K, 5′-CCTTCTTGTTG T T T TTCCAGATAATCACG3′ E226K, 5′-GCCAAAACTGTCTTCCTT T TTGTTGGTC3′; R185G, 5′-CCGGAAAGA C CGGATAAGAGACG-3′; Y174F, 5′-CCCTGTTCATGACAGTGA A ACAACGACCTGACC-3′; Y174S, 5′-CCCTGTTCATGACAGTGA G ACAACGACCTGACC-3′; Y174W, 5′-CCCTGTTCATGACAGTGA CC CAACGACCTGACC-3′; Y171F, 5′-CCCTGTTCA A GACAGTGATAC-3′; Y171S, 5′-CCCTGTTCA G GACAGTGATAC-3′; Y171W, 5′-CCCTGTTCA CC ACAGTGATAC-3′. Mutated positions are indicated in bold face. PSPP was biosynthesized and separated by the method described by Zhang and Poulter (28Zhang D. Poulter C.D. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 213: 356-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), except that the enzyme used here was generated by the expression of the vector pTrxRSS. Briefly, pTrxRSS, which contains the wild-type RSS cDNA, was expressed in the host E. colistrain GI698, and the enzymic extract was prepared as described above. A typical squalene synthase reaction was carried out, except that NADPH was omitted from the reaction. EDTA was added to a final concentration of 1 m to terminate the reaction, and the mixture was sedimented at 5000 × g for 5 min. The clear supernatant was subjected to separation by radio-HPLC on a C-18 reversed phase column (Hewlett Packard Liquid Chromatogram 1090 equipped with Packard Radiomatic Flo-one). For the separation, the column was pre-equilibrated with 25 mm(NH4)2CO3, and elution of products was accomplished by a 35-min linear concentration gradient to 100% acetonitrile, which was followed by a 5-min linear concentration gradient to 50% tetrahydrofuran. Both radioactivity and UV signals were monitored. A radioactive peak with a retention time reported for PSPP (28Zhang D. Poulter C.D. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 213: 356-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) was collected and was further analyzed and identified in a bioassay and by mass spectroscopy. Large scale preparation of [3H]PSPP was achieved by the scaling up of the reaction volume to 1 ml in the presence of 400 μm [1-3H]FPP and 400 μg of protein. After separated by radio-HPLC, the [3H]PSPP was concentrated under a stream of N2 and stored at −80 °C. In the bioassay, the collected sample of [3H]PSPP was used as a substrate for the reaction. The assay was done under the same conditions described for the RSS enzymic assay, except that [3H]FPP was replaced by 5 nCi of the isolated [3H]PSPP. The radioactive product was confirmed as squalene by a chromatographic comparison with an authentic sample of squalene using the radio-HPLC separation system described above. For electrospray mass spectrometric analysis, the sample was first lyophilized and then was reconstituted with acetonitrile, 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate (7:3) and infused at 2 μl/min flow to the mass spectrometer for analysis. All mass spectra were recorded on Sciex API III triple quadruple instrument equipped with an electrospray source at negative mode. For the molecular mass measurement, the mass spectrometer was scanned in 0.33-Da steps of 3 ms dwell time at unit resolution over the m/z range of 450–750. For structural elucidation, the collision-induced dissociation experiment was performed on the molecular ion of interest,m/z 585. Argon was used as the collision gas at a thickness of 1.8 × 1014 molecules /cm2. The fragmentation was achieved at a collision energy of 30 eV. The mass analyzing quadruple Q3 for the fragment ion spectrum was scanned fromm/z 30 to 600 in 0.33-Da steps of 2 ms dwell at unit resolution. The final spectra were the result of 50–100 scans. The activity of the first step reaction of RSS (Fig. 1) was assayed as described above, except NADPH was omitted. The product of the first reaction, [3H]PSPP, was quantitatively analyzed by radio-HPLC. Specific activities are expressed as the mean of triplicate reactions. The activity of the second step was assayed using PSPP and NADPH as substrates. Each reaction contained 5 nmol of [3H]PSPP prepared as described above. The product of the reaction, squalene, was quantitatively analyzed by radio-HPLC. Specific activities are expressed as the mean of triplicate reactions. Since several mutants were found to accumulate PSPP even in the presence of NADPH, additional reactions were performed under the conditions described above for the determination of RSS enzymic activity, except that instead of using TLC for the analysis, radioactivity of both PSPP and squalene were quantitatively assayed by radio-HPLC. The activity of the first reaction in these mutants is calculated as total conversion from FPP to both PSPP and squalene. In all calculations, the molar specific radioactivity of PSPP and squalene was assumed to be 1.5 times that of the [1-3H]FPP from which it was produced on the basis of the known loss of one proton from the C-1 position of one of the two reacting FPP molecules (29Rilling H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 3233-3246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previously we have reported the expression of RSS in E. coli using pRSS1327, a pBluescript-based vector (3McKenzie T.L. Jiang G. Straubhaar J.R. Conrad D.G. Shechter I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21368-21374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in the present study, where analysis of mutant RSS enzymes often required detection of low level activities, it was necessary to obtain higher levels of RSS expression than is possible with pRSS1327. For this purpose, we have used the pTrxFus vector to construct the E. coli pTrxRSS expression system. The pTrxRSS system yielded up to 9-fold higher enzymic expressions than pRSS1327, as shown in Fig. 3. Therefore, it was used for the mutant RSS enzyme activity analyses. However, a single strand DNA needed for the mutation procedure cannot be rescued from pTrxRSS, and therefore, the original pRSS1327 vector was utilized as a shuttle vector for the site-directed mutagenesis. The separation, purification, and analysis of the recombinant RSS reaction products was similar to the previously described procedure used for the yeast enzyme (28Zhang D. Poulter C.D. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 213: 356-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The radioactive product was identified as squalene based on its co-migration with an authentic standard of squalene on thin layer chromatograpy and HPLC systems as described previously (1Shechter I. Klinger E. Rucker M.L. Engstrom R.G. Spirito J.A. Islam M.A. Boettcher B.R. Weinstein D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8628-8635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3McKenzie T.L. Jiang G. Straubhaar J.R. Conrad D.G. Shechter I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21368-21374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Its chromatographic migration in comparison to an authentic standard of squalene in HPLC is shown in Figs. 4, A and B. Three lines of evidence show that the intermediate produced in the RSS enzymatic reaction lacking NADPH is PSPP. 1) It has elution properties in the HPLC system identical to the previously described yeast enzyme-derived PSPP (data for the preparation of the yeast-derived PSPP is not shown) (28Zhang D. Poulter C.D. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 213: 356-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). 2) Electrospray mass spectroscopy shows a typicalm/z 585 for C30H51O7P2 (M − H+)− and m/z 607 for C30H50O7P2Na (M + Na+ − H+)− as was reported for this structure (28Zhang D. Poulter C.D. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 213: 356-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). 3) The isolated RSS-derived [3H]PSPP (Fig. 4 C) could be converted quantitatively to squalene by the same enzyme in a reaction containing NADPH (Fig. 4 D). These three criteria together with the observation that PSPP is formed as the major product from FPP in a reaction lacking NADPH (Fig.4 C), unequivocally prove its structure to be that of PSPP. Of the three conserved protein sections of squalene synthase, Section C is unique to this enzyme. Therefore, this section was proposed earlier to be directly involved in the catalytic process (3McKenzie T.L. Jiang G. Straubhaar J.R. Conrad D.G. Shechter I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21368-21374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We report here the single residue modifications of the four amino acids in this section: Phe286, Phe288, Gln283, and G"
https://openalex.org/W1978922710,"A nonsense codon suppression technique was employed to incorporate ortho-nitrobenzyl tyrosine, “caged tyrosine,” in place of tyrosine at any of three positions (93, 127, or 198) in the α subunit of the muscle nicotinic ACh receptor (nAChR) expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The ortho-nitrobenzyl group was then removed by 1 ms flashes at 300–350 nm to yield tyrosine itself while macroscopic currents were recorded during steady ACh exposure. Responses to multiple flashes showed (1) that each flash decages up to 17% of the tyrosines and (2) that two tyrosines must be decaged per receptor for a response. The conductance relaxations showed multiple kinetic components; rate constants (<0.1 s−1 to 103 s−1) depended on pH and the site of incorporation, and relative amplitudes depended on the number of prior flashes. This method, which is potentially quite general, (1) provides a time-resolved assay for the behavior of a protein when a mutant sidechain is abruptly changed to the wild-type residue and (2) will also allow for selective decaging of sidechains that are candidates for covalent modification (such as phosphorylation) in specific proteins in intact cells."
https://openalex.org/W2119178105,"We have investigated the structural requirements of the β3 integrin subunit cytoplasmic domain necessary for tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and paxillin during αvβ3-mediated cell spreading. Using CHO cells transfected with various β3mutants, we demonstrate a close correlation between αvβ3-mediated cell spreading and tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and paxillin, and highlight a distinct involvement of the NPLY747 and NITY759 motifs in these signaling processes. Deletion of the NITY759motif alone was sufficient to completely prevent αvβ3-dependent focal contact formation, cell spreading, and FAK/paxillin phosphorylation. The single Y759A substitution induced a strong inhibitory phenotype, while the more conservative, but still phosphorylation-defective, Y759F mutation restored wild type receptor function. Alanine substitution of the highly conserved Tyr747 completely abolished αvβ3-dependent formation of focal adhesion plaques, cell spreading, and FAK/paxillin phosphorylation, whereas a Y747F substitution only partially restored these events. As none of these mutations affected receptor-ligand interaction, our results suggest that the structural integrity of the NITY759 motif, rather than the phosphorylation status of Tyr759 is important for β3-mediated cytoskeleton reorganization and tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and paxillin, while the presence of Tyr at residue 747 within the NPLY747 motif is required for optimal β3post-ligand binding events.

Anchorage of cells to the extracellular matrix is mediated in part by integrins, a large family of heterodimeric cell surface receptors, that regulate numerous aspects of cell behavior, such as cell motility, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (1Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar). Cell engagement with extracellular matrix ligands induces integrin translocation to subcellular structures known as focal adhesion plaques that form at regions of close contact between the cell and its underlying substratum (2Burridge K. Fath K. Kelly T. Nuckolls G. Turner C. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 487-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1684) Google Scholar). Integrin clustering at focal contact sites in turn triggers major intracellular events, including cytoskeleton reorganization, intracellular ion transport, phosphoinositide turnover, kinase activation, and tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular proteins (3Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2802) Google Scholar). A large number of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins have been identified within focal adhesion plaques. These include cytoskeletal proteins, kinases and adaptor proteins, growth factor receptors, and growth factor receptor-related signaling molecules, thus emphasizing the potential role of integrins as recruiting centers for molecules involved in various signaling pathways. Although the link of integrins with focal adhesions is well established, the precise mechanism by which integrins associate with cytoskeletal proteins, regulate focal adhesion plaque assembly, and participate in the activation of intracellular signaling cascades is still unclear. There is convincing evidence that integrin β subunits are likely to play a major role in these processes: (i) truncation of the β subunit cytoplasmic domain impairs integrin recruitment to focal contacts (4Solowska J.

Based on mutational analysis of the cytoplasmic domain of the β1 integrin, three motifs have been identified that are important for the recruitment of integrins to adhesion plaques; these motifs correspond to the highly conserved acidic membrane-proximal domain and to two C-terminal NPXY motifs (6Reszka A.A. Hayashi Y. Horwitz A.F. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1321-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 9Marcantonio E.E. Guan J.L. Trevithick J.E. Hynes R.O.

Nature. 1989; 338: 383-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar). Subsequent complementary studies (based on a combination of deletion analysis, single amino acid substitution, and the use of cytoplasmic domain synthetic peptides) have provided evidence that these highly conserved cytoplasmic motifs in the various integrin β subunits have similar functional properties (11Cone R.I.

J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1149-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The importance of tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins during focal contact formation is well established as tyrosine kinase inhibitors prevent the organization of focal adhesion plaques and stress fibers (21Burridge K. Turner C.E. Romer L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar), and treatment of cells with cytochalasin B or D, which block actin polymerization, inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and paxillin (22Lin T.H.

In contrast, the precise mechanisms by which integrin β subunits trigger tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins during integrin-dependent cell attachment and spreading are less well understood. In an attempt to identify amino acids of the β3 cytoplasmic domain involved in the phosphotyrosine signaling cascade induced by β3integrins, Tahiliani et al. (23Tahiliani P.D. Singh L. Auer K.L. LaFlamme S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7892-7898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) have expressed various mutant β3 cytoplasmic domains as separate tails connected to an extracellular reporter protein. Using this approach, they deliberately excluded the role of upstream events, such as integrin-dependent ligand binding, cell adhesion, and cell spreading, in triggering the FAK signaling cascade (23Tahiliani P.D. Singh L. Auer K.L. LaFlamme S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7892-7898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have used an alternative approach to investigate the structural requirements of the β3 subunit cytoplasmic domain necessary to stimulate intracellular tyrosine phosphorylation during cell spreading. By expressing various human β3integrin cytoplasmic domain mutants, which either promote or inhibit αvβ3-dependent CHO cell spreading, we demonstrate a close correlation between a structurally conserved β3 integrin cytoplasmic tail, cell spreading and FAK/paxillin phosphorylation, as all C-terminal truncation mutants unable to induce cell spreading, also failed to trigger tyrosine phosphorylation. Our data further highlight major differences in the involvement of the cytoplasmic domain tyrosine residues in β3-mediated post-ligand binding events. The presence of residue Tyr759 in the membrane-distal NITY759sequence is not necessary for β3-mediated focal contact formation, cell spreading, and β3-triggered tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK or paxillin, whereas residue Tyr747of the membrane-proximal NPLY747 motif is required for optimal αvβ3 receptor function. And finally, both the NPLY747 and NITY759 motifs contribute in defining the appropriate β3 cytoplasmic domain conformation necessary for post-ligand binding signaling events. The Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line CRL 9096, defective in the dihydrofolate reductase gene (CHO dhfr −), was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). The cells were grown in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (IMDM) (Life Technologies, Inc., Merelbeke, Belgium), supplemented with glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin, 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (complete IMDM), and, when required, hypoxanthine (100 μm) and thymidine (10 μm). The cells were routinely passaged with EDTA buffer, pH 7.4 (1 mm EDTA, 126 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 50 mmHepes). The following polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies were purchased: anti-αv from Life Technologies (24Freed E. Gailit J. van der Geer P. Ruoslahti E. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2955-2965Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), anti-phosphotyrosine (PY-20), anti-paxillin and anti-FAK from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), and the polyclonal anti-FAK antibody (C-903) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The monoclonal antibody 4D10G3 (anti-human β3) was a generous gift of Dr. D. R. Phillips (COR Therapeutics, South San Francisco, CA). Monoclonal antibodies 13C2 (anti-human αv) and 23C6 (anti-αvβ3) were kindly provided by Dr. M. Horton (Bone and Mineral Centre, The Middlesex Hospital, London, United Kingdom), monoclonal antibody P37 (anti-human β3) by Dr. J. Gonzalez-Rodriguez (Instituto de Quimica Fisica, Madrid, Spain), and the blocking monoclonal antibody MA-16N7C2 (anti-human β3) by Dr. M. Hoylaerts (Centre for Molecular and Vascular Biology, University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium). Purified human fibrinogen and bovine serum albumin (BSA, fraction V) were purchased from Sigma (Bornem, Belgium). The full-length cDNA encoding wild type β3 was inserted into the 5′-EcoRI/EcoRV-3′ site of the expression vector pBJ1 as described previously (25Kieffer N. Melchior C. Guinet J.M. Michels S. Gouon V. Bron N. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1996; 4: 25-39Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The β3Y747A and β3Y747F mutations were introduced in the full-length β3 cDNA by site-directed mutagenesis using the Altered Sites™ in vitromutagenesis kit (Promega, Lyon, France). Briefly, full-length cDNA encoding wild type β3 was cloned into the phagemid pALTER-1, and the mismatched primers 5′-GCCAACAACCCACTGGCTAAAGAGGCCACG-3′ (β3Y747A) and 5′-GCCAACAACCCACTGTTTAAAGAGGCCACGTCGACCTTC-3′ (β3Y747F) (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium) used for the generation of the mutant constructs. Primer β3Y747F allowed the generation of a new SalI restriction site (GTCGAC) in addition to the point mutation. Mutagenesis was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The full-length mutated β3 cDNA was finally excised from the pALTER phagemid with 5′XbaI/HindIII 3′ and inserted into theXbaI/HindIII site of the pBJ1 mammalian cell expression vector. The cDNAs encoding the mutant β3Y759A, β3Y759F, β3Y747A/Y759F, β3Δ754, β3Δ744, and β3Δ722 subunits were generated by excision of the 3′ end of the full-length β3coding sequence, starting at the BamHI site at nucleotide position 1501 of the published β3 cDNA sequence for mutant β3Δ722 and starting at the EcoRI site at nucleotide position 2274 for the other mutants. The excision was followed by an insertion of a BamHI-EcoRV or anEcoRI-EcoRV cassette, obtained by oligonucleotide-directed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) mutagenesis. The nucleotides used to generate the cassette were purchased either from Genset (Paris, France) or from Eurogentec. The upstream primer (sense) for the β3Y759A, β3Y759F, and β3Y747A/Y759F mutant constructs was a 23-mer corresponding to the β3 nucleotide sequence 2023–2045: 5′-GTGAAAGAGCTTAAGGACACTGG-3′. The upstream primer (sense) for the β3Δ754 and β3Δ744 mutant constructs was a 26-mer corresponding to the β3 nucleotide sequence 2264–2290: 5′-CGACCGAAAAGAATTCGCTAAATTTG-3′ comprising anEcoRI restriction site (GAATTC). The upstream primer (sense) for the β3Δ722 mutant construct was a 22-mer corresponding to the β3 nucleotide sequence 1497–1518: 5′-GCTGGGATCCCAGTGTGAGTGC-3′ comprising a BamHI restriction site (GGATCC). All downstream primers (antisense) contained a stop codon followed by an EcoRV restriction site (GATATC). The following downstream primers were used: 5′-CTTAAGCTTGATATCCTAGTTACTTAAGTGCCCCGGGCCGTGATATTGG-3′ (β3Y759A); 5′-CTTAAGCTTGATATCCTAGTTACTTAAGTGCCCCGGAACGTGATATTGG-3′ (β3Y759F and β3Y747A/Y759F); 5′-CTTAAGCTTGATATCCTAGTTACCTAGGTAGACGTGGCCTCTTTATAC-3′ (β3Δ754); 5′-CTTAAGCTTGATATCCTAGTTACCTAGTTGGCTGTGTCCCATTTTGC-3′ (β3Δ744); 5′- CTTAAGCTTGATATCCTAGTTACCTAGATGGTGATGAGGAGTTTCCAG -3′ (β3Δ722). For β3Y759A, β3Y759F, β3Δ754, β3Δ744, and β3Δ722 constructs, pBJ1 β3wt plasmid was used as a template for cDNA amplification, while the β3Y747A/Y759F mutant was generated using the plasmid pBJ1 β3Y747A. For the β3Δ722 mutant construct, the PCR-amplified fragment was purified, digested with BamHI and EcoRV, and inserted into the pBJ1 β3plasmid from which the wild type BamHI-EcoRV fragment had been removed. For all the other mutant constructs, the PCRamplified fragments were digested with EcoRI andEcoRV after purification and inserted into the pBJ1 β3 plasmid from which the wild typeEcoRI-EcoRV fragment had been removed. Each mutant β3 construct was verified by dideoxy sequencing using the 26-mer corresponding to the β3 nucleotide sequence 2264–2290 as a 5′ primer. Full-length β3 cDNA in pBJ1 vector (20 μg) and 1 μg of dihydrofolate reductase plasmid (pMDR901) were mixed with 40 μg of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a final volume of 200 μl of IMDM and added to CHO dhfr − cells grown to 60% confluence in 100-mm tissue culture plates. After 24 h, fetal calf serum was added to the culture medium and 48 h after transfection, the cells were grown in nucleoside-free α-minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) used as selective medium. Positive transfectants were analyzed for cell surface expression of the recombinant human integrin β3 subunit using the anti-β3 monoclonal antibody P37 and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Caltag Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Stably transfected cells were subcloned by limiting dilution and controlled for cell surface expression of the transfected β3 integrin subunit. Surface expression of the transfected human β3integrins was analyzed by flow cytometry using the monoclonal antibodies P37 (anti-human β3), 13C2 (anti-human αv), and 23C6 (anti-αvβ3). Selected transfectants were detached from culture plates with EDTA buffer, pH 7.4, and washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (136 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KOH, 8 mmNa2HPO4, 1.8 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.4). The cells (5 × 105) were then incubated for 30 min on ice with the primary antibody, washed with PBS, and further incubated for 30 min on ice with a FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody. Cells were washed and resuspended in PBS and then analyzed on an Epics Elite ESP flow cytometer (Coulter Corp., Hialeah, FL). Total RNA was isolated from 5 × 106transfected cells according to the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (26Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 152: 156-159Crossref Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). First strand cDNA synthesis from 2 μg of total RNA was performed with the Perkin-Elmer RNA-PCR kit using oligo(dT) as a primer. The coding sequence, corresponding to the cytoplasmic domain of the β3 integrin subunit was amplified using specific primers. The amplified products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and directly sequenced using the fmol™ DNA sequencing kit (Promega). For cell-bead attachment assay, 200 μl of polystyrene 3-μm beads (Sigma) were washed twice in distilled H2O, and resuspended in 1 ml of 0.1 m bicarbonate coating buffer, pH 9. Ligand coating was performed by adding fibrinogen or BSA to the beads at a final concentration of 100 μg/ml. The beads were rotated for 1 h at room temperature, washed once in PBS, and blocked with 0.1% BSA in IMDM for 2 h at room temperature. The beads were finally washed twice and resuspended in IMDM. For the cell-bead attachment assay, CHO cells were detached with EDTA buffer, washed twice, and resuspended in serum-free IMDM. After a preincubation of 45 min at room temperature in the presence or absence of either 500 nm echistatin or 1.5 μg of the monoclonal antibody MA-16N7C2, the cells (4 × 104) were added to individual wells of 96-well microtiter plates precoated overnight at 4 °C with poly-l-lysine (Sigma) at 100 μg/ml in IMDM, and allowed to settle for 1 h at 37 °C. The freshly prepared ligand-coated beads were then added to the wells at a 50:1 bead-to-cell ratio. After a further 45-min incubation at 37 °C with gentle shaking, the unbound beads were removed with six washes in IMDM. Microphotographs were then taken of the cells (magnification, ×300) using a Nikon invertoscope equipped with phase contrast. Adhesion assays were carried out as described previously with minor modifications (27Kieffer N. Fitzgerald L.A. Wolf D.L. Cheresh D.A. Phillips D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 451-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Briefly, cultured cells were detached with EDTA buffer, washed twice, and resuspended in serum-free IMDM. The cells (3 × 104) were then added to individual wells of 96 well-microtiter plates coated with fibrinogen at 20 μg/ml in serum-free IMDM overnight at 4 °C, and cell attachment was allowed to occur at 37 °C. For time-course experiments, the cells in the individual microtiter wells were microphotographed at different time points without prior washing of the plates or discharge of nonadherent cells. Quantitation of spread fibroblastoid cells versusnon-spread round cells was performed on the micrographs according to cell morphology. For each time point, approximately 200 cells were counted and the data reported as mean percent of three independent experiments performed in triplicate. Intracellular immunofluorescence staining of adherent cells was performed using eight-well glass chamber slides (Lab-Tek, Nunc International, Naperville, IL) precoated overnight at 4 °C with 20 μg/ml of fibrinogen in serum-free IMDM. The cultured cells were detached with EDTA buffer, washed twice with IMDM, and incubated overnight in individual compartments of the chamber slides. The cells were fixed for 15 min at 4 °C with 3% paraformaldehyde, 2% sucrose in PBS, pH 7.4, rinsed twice with PBS, and permeabilized with labeling buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% BSA in PBS, pH 7.4) for 15 min at room temperature. Immunofluorescent staining was performed by incubating the glass slides for 30 min with a primary mouse monoclonal antibody to human β3 (P37) or to the αvβ3 complex (23C6) diluted in labeling buffer. After three washing steps, the glass slides were incubated for another 30 min with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG in the presence or absence of 0.5 μg/ml phalloidin conjugated to tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Negative controls were stained in the absence of the primary antibody. The slides were finally washed three times in labeling buffer and mounted in Mowiol 40–88/DABCO (Sigma). The specimens were examined with a Leica-DMRB fluorescence microscope using a 63 × oil immersion objective. Microphotograhs were taken using Ilford HP5 Plus 400 films (Ilford, Mobberley, United Kingdom). Petri dishes (100 mm) were coated overnight at 4 °C with 100 μg/ml of purified human fibrinogen in serum-free IMDM. The dishes were then blocked with 5 mg/ml BSA in serum-free IMDM for 1 h at 37 °C and finally washed twice with serum-free IMDM. Cultured cells were detached with EDTA buffer, carefully washed twice with serum-free IMDM, resuspended in IMDM, and either kept in suspension or added to the coated dishes in the presence or absence of 5 μmcytochalasin B (Sigma). After a 2-h incubation at 37 °C, nonadherent cells were sedimented at 1000 rpm for 10 min and lysed with the following lysis buffer: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Adherent cells were lysed in situ with the same lysis buffer. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the protein content determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad, Nazareth, Belgium). Cultured cells were detached with EDTA buffer, washed twice in cold PBS buffer, and lysed for 30 min in 300 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the protein concentration was determined according to the method of Markwell (28Markwell M.A.K. Haas S.M. Lieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (5279) Google Scholar). For each cell clone, equal amounts of protein lysate (1–1.5 mg of protein) were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with either monoclonal antibody P37 (to human β3), or, for tyrosine phosphorylation assays, with polyclonal rabbit anti-FAK or monoclonal mouse anti-paxillin antibody. Immune complexes were precipitated by a 30-min incubation at 4 °C with protein A-Sepharose beads (75 μl of a 1:1 suspension in PBS). The beads were then washed three times with lysis buffer, and the precipitates recovered by boiling the beads in 30 μl of SDS sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4.6% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.5 mg/ml bromphenol blue) either in the presence or absence of 1.4m β-mercaptoethanol. Immunoprecipitates or total cell lysates (50 μg of protein) were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and transferred onto nitrocellulose using a semi-dry transblot apparatus (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Roosendaal, The Netherlands). The membranes were blocked for 1 h in blocking buffer (Tris-buffered saline (TBS) (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl) containing 0.1% Tween and either 1% BSA for tyrosine phosphorylation assays or 5% nonfat dry milk) and incubated overnight with the primary antibody diluted in blocking buffer. After several 5 to 10 min washes in TBS-Tween (TBS, pH 7.4, 0.1% Tween), the membranes were incubated for 1 h with sheep anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxydase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) in TBS-Tween containing 5% nonfat dry milk at pH 7.4. The membranes were then washed in TBS and bound antibody visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After exposure to autoradiography films, the membranes prepared for tyrosine phosphorylation assays were stripped by a 30-min incubation at 50 °C in 50 ml of stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.7, 2% SDS, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and then reprobed with a monoclonal antibody to either FAK or paxillin. For each experiment, the level of antibody binding was quantified by scanning densitometry and the results expressed as the ratio of phosphorylated FAKversus total immunoprecipitated FAK. The data for each cell clone were normalized to the ratio obtained for CHO β3wt cells adherent on fibrinogen (expressed as 100%). In order to determine how the β3 integrin cytoplasmic domain regulates integrin-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation during cell spreading, a series of β3integrin subunit mutants were generated that either promote or fail to promote β3 integrin-dependent cell spreading (Fig. 1). After stable transfection of wild type or mutant β3 cDNA into CHO cells, cell clones were analyzed by flow cytometry for surface expression of the chimeric αv(hamster)β3(human) receptor, using monoclonal antibodies specific to human αv (13C2), human β3 (P37), and the αvβ3complex (23C6). As shown in Fig. 2, all the cell clones selected for the present study revealed similar levels of cell surface expression of the chimeric αvβ3 receptor, except mutant β3Δ722, for which only weak labeling could be observed, despite several successive transfection attempts. Western blot analysis of the expressed recombinant β3 subunit in each cell clone essentially confirmed the immunofluorescence data (Figs.3 and4 A). Interestingly however, despite the weak surface expression of deletion mutant β3Δ722, a band even stronger in intensity to that observed for wild type β3 could be demonstrated in CHO β3Δ722 cells. The slightly increased electrophoretic mobility of deletion mutants β3Δ744 and β3Δ722 as compared with recombinant wild type β3 confirmed their smaller molecular size. Correct heterodimerization of endogenous αv with the human β3 subunit was demonstrated for each deletion mutant by immunoprecipitation experiments using the anti-human β3antibody P37. As shown in Fig. 4 B, two bands corresponding to αv and β3 were coprecipitated with similar intensities for all deletion mutants, including β3Δ722. Finally, to confirm that each selected cell clone expressed the human β3 integrin subunit with the expected cytoplasmic mutation, mRNA was isolated from the transfected cell clones and transcribed into cDNA. The cDNA segment encoding the cytoplasmic domain was amplified using β3 specific primers, and the amplified segment sequenced (results not shown). Taken together, these data demonstrate that the selected cell clones express on their cell surface the recombinant β3 subunit with the expected mutation, and that an almost complete deletion of the cytoplasmic domain of the integrin β3 subunit (β3Δ722) interferes with surface exposure of the preformed heterodimeric αvβ3Δ722 integrin complex.Figure 2Flow cytometry analysis of chimeric αvβ3 expression in"

There has been considerable success in preventing the rejection of transplanted organs, and further improvements in the outcome of transplantation are in prospect. However, the main limitation on the fullest possible use of organ transplantation is the shortage of donated human organs. One solution to this problem would be xenotransplantation, the use of animals instead of humans as the source of organs and tissues for transplant. The immunological barriers to this procedure are now well defined and this review describes the various strategies that are being developed to try to overcome them."
https://openalex.org/W1977850722,"Nervous system assembly requires the directed migrations of cells and axon growth cones along the dorsoventral and anteroposterior axes. Although guidance mechanisms for dorsoventral migrations are conserved from nematodes to mammals, mechanisms for anteroposterior migrations are unknown. In C. elegans, the gene vab-8, which specifically functions in posteriorly directed migrations, encodes two isoforms of a novel intracellular protein that act cell-autonomously in different migrations. VAB-8L, which contains a domain similar to kinesin-like motors, functions in all vab-8-dependent axon growth cone migrations. VAB-8S, which lacks this N-terminal domain, functions in a subset of vab-8-dependent cell migrations. Continuous expression of VAB-8L in the ALM mechanosensory neuron, which normally requires vab-8 early in its development for posteriorly directed cell migration, redirects its anteriorly projecting axon posteriorly. We propose that regulation of vab-8 activity is a mechanism for controlling the direction of cell and axon growth cone migrations."
https://openalex.org/W1964136878,"We identified a rapid and novel system to effectively metabolize a large amount of H2O2 in the suspension cells ofScutellaria baicalensis Georgi. In response to an elicitor, the cells immediately initiate the hydrolysis of baicalein 7-O-β-d-glucuronide by β-glucuronidase, and the released baicalein is then quickly oxidized to 6,7-dehydrobaicalein by peroxidases. Hydrogen peroxide is effectively consumed during the peroxidase reaction. The β-glucuronidase inhibitor, saccharic acid 1,4-lactone, significantly reduced the H2O2-metabolizing ability of theScutellaria cells, indicating that β-glucuronidase, which does not catalyze the H2O2 degradation, plays an important role in the H2O2 metabolism. As H2O2-metabolizing enzymes, we purified two peroxidases using ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by sequential chromatography on CM-cellulose and hydroxylapatite. Both peroxidases show high H2O2-metabolizing activity using baicalein, whereas other endogenous flavones are not substrates of the peroxidase reaction. Therefore, baicalein predominantly contributed to H2O2 metabolism. Because β-glucuronidase, cell wall peroxidases, and baicalein pre-exist inScutellaria cells, their constitutive presence enables the cells to rapidly induce the H2O2-metabolizing system.

Plants display a broad range of defense responses to protect themselves against mechanical damage or pathogen attack. One of the earliest responses is the production of large amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS), 1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; BA, baicalein; BAG, baicalein 7-O-β-d-glucuronide; DBA, 6,7-dehydrobaicalein; SAL, saccharic acid 1,4-lactone; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; BA, baicalein; BAG, baicalein 7-O-β-d-glucuronide; DBA, 6,7-dehydrobaicalein; SAL, saccharic acid 1,4-lactone; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. which is called the oxidative burst (1Doke N. Physiol. Plant Pathol. 1983; 23: 345-357Crossref Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 2Sutherland M.W. Physiol. Mol. Plant Pathol. 1991; 39: 79-93Crossref Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 3Mehdy M.C. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar, 4Baker C.J. Orlandi E.W. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 1995; 33: 299-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). The physiological roles of the oxidative burst have been well examined to date. For example, several studies demonstrated that ROS directly reduce pathogen viability (5Keppler L.D. Baker C.J. Phytopathology. 1989; 79: 555-562Crossref Google Scholar) and that micromolar concentrations of H2O2inhibit spore germination of a number of fungal pathogens (6Peng M. Kuc J. Phytopathology. 1992; 82: 696-699Crossref Google Scholar). In soybean and tomato, cell wall proteins such as hydroxyproline-rich proteins (extensin) are rapidly immobilized by the action of peroxidases as soon as H2O2 is produced, resulting in strengthening of the cell walls to pathogen attack (7Bradley D.J. Kjellbom P.P. Lamb C.J. Cell. 1992; 70: 21-30Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar, 8Brownleader M.D. Ahmed N. Trevan M. Chaplin M.F. Dey P.M. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 1115-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been reported that the oxidative burst can induce lipid peroxidation, leading to loss of membrane integrity and finally to the death of host plant cells, which is known as the hypersensitive response (5Keppler L.D. Baker C.J. Phytopathology. 1989; 79: 555-562Crossref Google Scholar, 9Adam A. Farkas T. Somlyai G. Hevesi M. Kiraaly Z. Physiol. Mol. Plant Pathol. 1989; 34: 13-26Crossref Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Thus, although the oxidative burst plays important roles in plant defense, the plant cells themselves are consequently exposed to serious oxidative stress. Most plant cells produce ROS as by-products of redox reactions under normal conditions, but they are maintained at a low level by ROS-metabolizing enzymes such as catalase and ascorbate peroxidase (10Asada K. Physiol. Plant. 1992; 85: 235-241Crossref Scopus (1230) Google Scholar, 11Wojtaszek P. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 681-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar). However, the detoxification mechanism of ROS produced by the oxidative burst has not been clearly understood. In this work, we establish that the suspension cells ofScutellaria baicalensis Georgi (skullcap plants) have a rapid and novel system to detoxify a large amount of H2O2. S. baicalensis contains numerous flavones, and their pharmacological properties have been extensively investigated. Among them, baicalein (BA) has attracted considerable attention, as it has a variety of interesting activities such as antibacterial (12Kubo M. Kimura Y. Odani T. Tani T. Namba K. Planta Med. 1981; 43: 194-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), antiviral (13Austin C.A. Patel S. Ono K. Nakane H. Fisher L.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 883-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), anticancer (14So F.V. Guthrie N. Chambers A.F. Carroll K.K. Cancer Lett. 1997; 112: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), and lipoxygenase-inhibitory effects (15Marshall W.S. Bryson S.E. Garg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5504-5508Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In addition, this plant has long been known to possess a β-glucuronidase, called baicalinase (16Levvy G.A. Biochem. J. 1954; 56: 462-469Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Previously, we purified β-glucuronidase from the callus culture and demonstrated that this enzyme displays high activity for baicalein 7-O-β-d-glucuronide (BAG), the main flavonoid of this plant (17Morimoto S. Harioka T. Shoyama Y. Planta. 1995; 195: 535-540Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To establish the physiological roles of β-glucuronidase and BAG, we attempted further studies. Consequently, we found that the suspension cells of S. baicalensiseffectively metabolize H2O2 by a sequential reaction, including the hydrolysis of BAG to BA by β-glucuronidase and then the oxidation of BA by cell wall peroxidases. In this paper, we describe the detoxification mechanism of H2O2 in Scutellaria cells. We also report on the purification of the peroxidases involved in H2O2 degradation and their kinetic properties. The calluses were induced from the shoot stem segments of S. baicalensis, as described previously (17Morimoto S. Harioka T. Shoyama Y. Planta. 1995; 195: 535-540Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The suspension cells were obtained by incubating the 4-week-old calluses in liquid Murashige-Skoog medium (18Murashige T. Skoog F. Physiol. Plant. 1962; 15: 473-497Crossref Scopus (53314) Google Scholar) containing 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (0.5 mg/liter) and N6-benzyladenine (0.5 mg/liter) at 25 ± 1 °C under 16-h light conditions. The suspension cells were subcultured every 4 weeks in liquid Murashige-Skoog medium under the same culture conditions. Apigenin and luteolin were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka). Oroxylin A was donated by Dr. Yamamoto (Hokuriku University, Japan). BAG, BA, and wogonin were isolated from the dried roots of S. baicalensis (Uchida Wakanyaku, Tokyo) as described previously (17Morimoto S. Harioka T. Shoyama Y. Planta. 1995; 195: 535-540Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Because the amount of the unknown compound produced from the elicited cells by oxidative burst was not enough to analyze its structure, we enzymatically synthesized this compound from BA using CM-52 eluate as a crude peroxidase preparation. The CM-52 eluate (50 ml), which was prepared from 4-week-old cells (300 g) as described below, was added to 50 mm citrate buffer (pH 4.0, 200 ml) containing 2 mm H2O2. BA (30 mg) dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (1 ml) was slowly added to the enzyme solution and stirred at room temperature for 5 min. We confirmed by HPLC analysis that the reaction product had the same retention time as the unknown compound produced by the oxidative burst. The reaction mixture was applied to the reversed-phase polystyrene gel, MCI-gel CHP 20P (Mitsubishi Chemical Co., Tokyo, 2.0 × 20.0 cm) previously equilibrated with distilled water. After the column was washed with 100 ml of distilled water, fractions containing the unknown compound alone were eluted with 100 ml of methanol. However, we did not concentrate this methanol solution because the unknown compound was unstable to concentration procedures, including evaporation and lyophilization. Therefore, NMR analysis could not be carried out, but the methanol solution showed an [M+H]+ ion peak at m/z 269 in the fast atom bombardment mass spectrum. Finally, the unknown compound could be isolated as a phenazine derivative. Aftero-phenylenediamine (150 mg) was dissolved in the above methanol solution containing the unknown compound, 1 ml of acetic acid was added. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 10 min, and the methanol was then removed by evaporation. The residue was loaded on an MCI-gel CHP 20P column (2.0 × 15.0 cm) pre-equilibrated with 50% (v/v) aqueous methanol. After washing the column with 100 ml of the same solvent, elution with 80% (v/v) aqueous methanol afforded a phenazine derivative (19 mg). This compound was characterized as the 6,7-phenazine derivative of BA by its NMR analysis. Because o-phenylenediamine reacts with compounds that have an ortho- or a 1,2-diketone structure to form phenazine derivatives (19Billman J.H. Rendall J.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1944; 66: 540-541Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar), the unknown compound was determined as 6,7-dehydrobaicalein (DBA). Structures of these compounds are shown as insets in Fig. 3. The 4-week-old suspension cells were harvested by filtration and washed with fresh growth medium. Aliquots (each 5 g) of the cells were subdivided into 100-ml flasks, and 20 ml of the growth medium was added to each flask. After 200 μl of 10% (w/v) yeast extract (Nacalei Tesque, Kyoto) dissolved in the growth medium was added (final concentration of yeast extract, 0.1%), each cell suspension was incubated at 25 °C for 0–180 min. The saccharic acid 1,4-lactone (SAL) treatment of the elicited cells was carried out as described above, except a yeast extract solution containing 100 mm SAL (final SAL concentration, 1 mm, Sigma) was used instead of the yeast extract solution alone. All experiments were repeated with three replicates in each samples. Elicited samples incubated for different times were homogenized with methanol (20 ml). After centrifugation of the homogenate at 20,000 × g for 5 min, the supernatant was used to determine the amounts of BAG, BA, and DBA. The quantification of these flavones was carried out with an HPLC system (Tosoh, Tokyo) composed of a CCPM pump and a UV-8000 absorbance detector equipped with a Cosmosil 5C18 AR column (0.46 × 15.0 cm, Nacalai Tesque). BAG, BA, and DBA were eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with 25, 35, and 15% (v/v) aqueous acetonitrile containing 50 mm phosphoric acid, respectively. The effluent was monitored by absorption at 254 nm, and the peak intensity was determined with a Chromatocorder 21 (Tosoh). The amount of BAG and BA was calculated from the standard curves obtained with authentic samples. As we could not isolate DBA in a free form, the following standard curve was used for the estimation of DBA levels. Various known amounts of BA were enzymatically oxidized to DBA, and each peak intensity of DBA was measured. The molar concentrations of DBA were considered to be equal to those of BA because we had confirmed that the oxidation of BA to DBA proceeds quantitatively under the conditions used. Therefore, the standard curve for DBA was constructed with the concentrations of BA and the peak intensities of DBA. After the elicited samples were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 5 min, the supernatant (1.0 ml) was passed over a Pasteur pipette column containing 0.1 g of Cosmosil 75C18 OPN (Nacalei Tesque) to remove phenolic compounds, which interfere with the precise quantification of H2O2. The column eluent was used to determine the amount of H2O2. We confirmed that H2O2 is quantitatively recovered by this chromatography method. The column eluent (100 μl) was incubated in a buffer (100 μl) containing purified peroxidase 1 (0.2 μg), 400 μm BA, 0.6% (w/v) Triton X-100, and 200 mmsodium citrate buffer (pH 4.0) at 30 °C for 10 min. Under these assay conditions, the amount of H2O2 was shown to be linear with respect to the DBA production. Therefore, the peak intensity of DBA in the reaction mixture was measured by HPLC as described above; the amount of H2O2 was calculated from the calibration curve, which was constructed with known amounts of H2O2 and the peak intensities of DBA produced by the enzymatic reaction. The assay consisted of 100 mm sodium citrate buffer (pH 5.5), 2 mm4-nitrophenol-α-d-mannoside, 1 mmmercaptoethanol, and the enzyme solution (500 μl) in a final volume of 1 ml. The samples were incubated at 30 °C for 60 min, and the reaction terminated with 100 μl of 0.5 n NaOH. The absorption of the sample was measured at 415 nm. The amount of 4-nitrophenol liberated was calculated from the standard curve. The assay for β-glucuronidase was conducted, as described previously (17Morimoto S. Harioka T. Shoyama Y. Planta. 1995; 195: 535-540Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The peroxidase activity was determined by incubating an assay mixture containing the enzyme solution, together with 200 μm BA, 200 μm H2O2, 0.3% (v/w) Triton X-100, and 100 mm sodium citrate buffer (pH 4.0) at 30 °C for 10 min in a final volume of 200 μl. The amount of H2O2 in the reaction mixture was measured as described above. The enzyme activity (katal) was defined as the amount (mole) of H2O2 consumed per second. The suspension cells (4.0 g) were soaked in 0.6 m mannitol (50 ml) containing 1.0% (w/v) Cellulase Onozuka R-10 (Yakult, Tokyo) and 0.1% (w/v) Macerozyme R-10 (Yakult). After incubation at 30 °C for 120 min, the reaction mixture was centrifuged at 100 × g for 10 min. The resulting protoplasts were washed twice with 0.6 m mannitol and centrifuged as described before. All procedures were carried out at 4 °C, unless otherwise indicated. Four-week-old suspension cells (300 g) were shaken in 1 m NaCl (1,000 ml) at 100 rpm for 60 min and then filtered with Nylon screen. After the filtrate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min, the supernatant was fractionated by addition of ammonium sulfate. Proteins precipitating between 10 and 75% saturation were collected by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min and then dialyzed overnight against three changes of 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0). The dialyzed sample was applied to a Whatman CM-cellulose column (2.5 × 25.0 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer. After the column was washed with the above buffer (200 ml), bound proteins were eluted with a 1,000-ml linear gradient of NaCl (0–0.4 m) at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The eluent was collected in 20-ml fractions. The most active fractions (fractions 23–25) were concentrated by ultrafiltration (Advantec, Tokyo) and dialyzed against 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). The dialysate was applied to a 1.0 × 20.0-cm column containing hydroxylapatite (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto) pre-equilibrated with 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). Fractions containing peroxidase 1 were eluted with 150 ml of the same buffer at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The most active fractions (fractions 5–7, each 20 ml) were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration. Peroxidase 2 was eluted from the same column with a 400-ml linear gradient of ionic strength sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0, 10–100 mm). The most active fractions (fractions 12–14) were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration, and dialyzed against 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer. Protein concentrations were measured according to Bradford (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214256) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. SDS-PAGE analysis was carried out with the system of Laemmli (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 224: 680-685Crossref Scopus (206514) Google Scholar) in a 12.5% acrylamide gel of 0.75-mm thickness (Bio-Rad). The subunit molecular mass of the enzyme was determined by comparison with low molecular mass protein standards (Sigma). Isoelectric focusing was conducted according to O'Farrell (22O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using 7.5-mm glass tubes (Atto, Tokyo). The pI of the purified enzyme was determined by comparison with marker proteins (Sigma). The native molecular masses of peroxidases 1 and 2 were estimated by gel filtration chromatography on a 1.5 × 75.0-cm column of Sephacryl S-200 HR (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. Fractions of 15 ml were collected. Molecular mass markers from 29 to 700 kDa were resolved under the same conditions prior to running the fractions containing peroxidase activity. S. baicalensis is known to contain flavonoid-specific β-glucuronidase, although its physiological importance is not understood (16Levvy G.A. Biochem. J. 1954; 56: 462-469Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To reveal the roles of this enzyme in S. baicalensis, we first investigated effects on the cells induced by inhibition of β-glucuronidase. In this study, SAL was used as the β-glucuronidase inhibitor. A significant effect of β-glucuronidase inhibition was observed in the elicited cells but not in the nonelicited cells. WhenScutellaria cells were treated with the elicitor yeast extract in the presence of SAL, numerous components that should exist within the cells were released to the medium (Fig.1 A). In addition, α-mannosidase (0.60 nanokatal/g fresh cells), which is reported to be present in the vacuoles and cytosol (23Anhalt S. Weissenböck G. Planta. 1992; 187: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), was also detected in the medium. Accordingly, the elicitation in the presence of SAL was thought to result in serious damage to the cells. In contrast to SAL treatment, elicitation in the absence of SAL resulted in much less damage; the elicited cells released only several components (Fig. 1 B) and a lower level of α-mannosidase (0.09 nanokatal/g fresh cells) to the medium. Similar experiments using H2O2instead of the elicitor also demonstrated that the elicited cells undergo more serious damage in the presence of SAL. These results indicated that Scutellaria cells have a rapid H2O2-detoxifying system that is inhibited by SAL. We measured the amount of H2O2 produced by the elicitation. As shown in Fig. 2, the SAL-treated cells immediately started to produce H2O2 after addition of the elicitor. The amount of H2O2 was maximum after 10 min of incubation and thereafter was slowly degraded. The SAL-untreated cells also produced the maximum level of H2O2 at 10 min after elicitation, although the amount was lower, as compared with SAL-treated cells. After 30 min of incubation, the H2O2 amount decreased to the same level as that before elicitation, showing that the SAL-untreated cells effectively metabolize H2O2. Based on these results, we concluded that the rapid degradation of H2O2depends largely on a hydrolytic reaction by β-glucuronidase. BecauseS. baicalensis possesses a large amount of BAG along with BAG-specific β-glucuronidase (17Morimoto S. Harioka T. Shoyama Y. Planta. 1995; 195: 535-540Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 24Yamamoto H. Bajaj Y.P.S. Biotechnology in Agriculture and Forestry: Medicinal and Aromatic Plants III. 15. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany1991: 398-418Google Scholar), it was suggested that the aglycone BA contributes to the H2O2metabolism. HPLC analysis showed that the elicited cells in the absence of SAL released an unknown compound (retention time, ∼8 min) to the medium (Fig.1 B). In contrast, this unknown peak was much smaller on the chromatogram of the SAL-treated cells (Fig. 1 A). As this compound was also assumed to be involved in the H2O2 metabolism, we attempted a structural elucidation. After several unsuccessful attempts, its structure was determined as DBA by the method as described under “Experimental Procedures.” DBA is the first flavone with anortho-diketone moiety. Judging from its structure, this flavone was considered to be derived from the oxidation of BA. We assessed changes in the amounts of BAG, BA, and DBA during elicitation. In the absence of SAL, the cells immediately initiated the hydrolysis of BAG after addition of the elicitor, and BAG continued to decrease until 30 min after incubation (Fig.3 A). The decrease of BAG correlated well with the H2O2 degradation such that H2O2 induced by the oxidative burst also decreased until 30 min after incubation, as shown in Fig. 2. On the other hand, BA increased rapidly with BAG hydrolysis, and the BA amount at 30 min was about two times higher than that before elicitation (Fig.3 B). Although at least ∼2.5 μmol of BAG should be hydrolyzed after elicitation, only a slight increase (∼0.06 μmol) in the BA amount was observed even at the maximum level, suggesting that most of the BA is immediately metabolized. SAL-untreated cells produced more DBA than BA, and its amount reached a maximum level after 60 min of incubation (Fig. 3 C). Thus, the production of DBA also occurred rapidly in response to the elicitor. In contrast, addition of SAL extensively inhibited the hydrolysis of BAG (Fig.3 A) and the production of DBA (Fig. 3 C), indicating that the hydrolysis of BAG is essential for the production of DBA. Therefore, we concluded that DBA is produced by the hydrolysis of BAG to BA, followed by the oxidation of BA. Hydrogen peroxide may be consumed during the conversion of BA to DBA because this step is an oxidative reaction. DBA was also assumed to undergo further metabolism, based on the facts that the decrease in the DBA amount was observed on incubation over 120 min and that only ∼15% of BAG hydrolyzed was recovered as DBA (0.38 μmol at the maximum level). However, the mechanism of DBA metabolism was not established in this study. We investigated whether the oxidation of BA to DBA required H2O2. Consequently, crude enzyme extract from Scutellaria cells was shown to catalyze the formation of DBA from BA by consuming H2O2, indicating that H2O2 is metabolized by peroxidase. Furthermore, we confirmed that BA metabolism by enzymes except for peroxidase is ineffective because the crude enzyme extract did not metabolize BA in the absence of H2O2. To extract this peroxidase effectively, extraction conditions were optimized. Crude enzyme extracts were prepared using various solvents, and then the peroxidase activity in each extract was measured by quantifying the amount of H2O2 consumed by the oxidation of BA. The higher activity was observed in the extract prepared with 1 m NaCl, which is often used for solubilization of proteins ionically bound to the cell walls. Moreover, the protoplasts prepared by digestion of the cell walls displayed much lower metabolizing activity for H2O2 (0.5 nanokatal/g cells) as compared with the intact Scutellariacells (11.5 nanokatal/g cells), and most of the activity was recovered in the digestion medium. These results apparently indicate that the H2O2-metabolizing enzymes exist in the cell walls. Because it was confirmed that β-glucuronidase and the cell wall peroxidase contribute to the detoxification of H2O2, we measured the activity of both enzymes after elicitation. As shown in Fig. 4, neither activity increased during the incubation period (180 min) tested, and the peroxidase activity decreased more than the β-glucuronidase activity. Hence, we concluded that the metabolism of H2O2 produced by the oxidative burst is catalyzed by these enzymes that are present consititutively inScutellaria cells. Previously, we purified β-glucuronidase from the Scutellaria calluses and characterized its properties (17Morimoto S. Harioka T. Shoyama Y. Planta. 1995; 195: 535-540Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). At present, there is no information on the cell wall peroxidases in this plant. Therefore, to characterize precisely the cell wall peroxidases, we attempted to purify them. The 4-week-old cells of S. baicalensis were shaken in 1m NaCl and then filtered. The filtrate was fractionated by ammonium sulfate saturation. More than 70% of the peroxidase activity was precipitated between 10 and 75% saturation of ammonium sulfate, resulting in a 3-fold purification. As a first chromatographic step, the solubilized ammonium sulfate fraction was applied to a CM-cellulose (CM-52) column, where a peroxidase was eluted with a linearly increasing gradient of NaCl (0–0.4 m). A lower level of peroxidase activity was recovered in the void volume, whereas most of the peroxidase activity eluted at ∼0.2 m NaCl. This step increased the specific activity in the latter fractions by a factor of 23-fold with a recovery of 43%. Because the total enzyme activity in the latter fractions was about 50 times higher than that in the former fraction, further purification of the former fractions was not carried out. As a final purification step, the latter CM-52 eluate was applied to a hydroxylapatite column. A peroxidase activity was eluted with 10 mm phosphate buffer, and SDS-PAGE showed that the peroxidase (termed peroxidase 1 in this paper) in these fractions was purified to homogeneity (Fig. 5). Further elution with an increasing gradient of the ionic strength of phosphate buffer (10–100 mm) gave another peroxidase, named peroxidase 2. The purification of peroxidase 2 to homogeneity was also confirmed by SDS-PAGE. Peroxidases 1 and 2 were purified 121- and 89-fold by the three-step procedure with a final recovery of 17 and 8% of the enzyme activity, respectively. Both peroxidases are the first flavone-metabolizing enzymes to be purified. SDS-PAGE of peroxidases 1 and 2 showed subunit molecular masses of 38 and 34 kDa, respectively (Fig. 5). The native molecular masses were estimated from the elution volume of both peroxidases on Sephacryl S-200 HR chromatography, where peroxidases 1 and 2 eluted as a single molecular species with a molecular mass of about 35 kDa in each case. These results suggested that each peroxidase exists as a monomeric enzyme. The pI values for peroxidases 1 and 2 were determined to be 8.7 and 8.9, respectively by comparison with marker proteins of known pI on isoelectric focusing gels. We determined the optimum pH of each peroxidase using BA. The activity of peroxidase 1 was maximum between pH 4.0 and 4.5, with half-maximal activities at pH values around 3.0 and 6.0. Peroxidase 2 also showed the maximum activity between pH 4.0 and 4.5, although its activity was slightly lower than that of peroxidase 1. Based on these results, standard assays were carried out with citrate buffer (pH 4.0). In S. baicalensis, wogonin and oroxylin A are also biosynthesized as minor flavones (24Yamamoto H. Bajaj Y.P.S. Biotechnology in Agriculture and Forestry: Medicinal and Aromatic Plants III. 15. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany1991: 398-418Google Scholar). To reveal whether these endogenous flavones are involved in the detoxification of H2O2, the substrate specificity was examined with them as well as BA. As shown in TableI, peroxidases 1 and 2 showed the high H2O2-metabolizing activity using BA with peroxidase 1 showing somewhat higher activity than peroxidase 2. In contrast, BAG does not undergo oxidation by either peroxidase.Scutellaria cells contain a much lower level of BA (∼0.06 μmol/g fresh cells) than BAG (∼9.5 μmol/g fresh cells), indicating that the cells have to hydrolyze BAG to effectively degrade H2O2. In addition, peroxidases 1 and 2 could not oxidize any of the endogenous flavones except for BA. In contrast to BA, these flavones possess a methoxyl or a glucuronyl group in their molecule; therefore, it is assumed that both enzymes can only oxidize flavones with hydroxyl groups. Moreover, we evaluated the peroxidase activity using apigenin (5,7,4′-trihydroxyflavone) and luteolin (5,7,3′,4′-tetrahydroxyflavone), which have not been identified inS. baicalensis. Both peroxidases showed a high activity with luteolin, whereas apigenin was not oxidized by either peroxidase. Like BA, luteolin has an ortho-dihydroxyl moiety in its molecule, thus suggesting that an ortho-dihydroxyl group is required for the peroxidase reaction.Table IEffects of various flavones on H 2 O 2 -metabolizing activityFlavoneSubstitutionaThe numbering of a flavone skeleton was described in Fig. 3 A.ActivityPeroxidase 1Peroxidase 2μkatal/mg proteinBA5,6,7-triOH1.38 ± 0.091.02 ± 0.15BAG5,6-diOH, 7-OGluAbGluA, β-d-glucuronyl.—c—, no activity was detected.—Oroxylin A5,7-diOH, 6-OMe——Wogonin5,7-diOH, 8-OMe——Apigenin5,7,4′-triOH——Luteolin5,7,3′,4′-tetraOH1.26 ± 0.211.14 ± 0.15a The numbering of a flavone skeleton was described in Fig. 3 A.b GluA, β-d-glucuronyl.c —, no activity was detected. Open table in a new tab ROS play important roles in plant defense such as the pathogen growth inhibition, cell strengthening, and the hypersensitive reaction. However, they are also thought to inflict serious damage on the host plant cells. In particular, huge amounts of ROS are quickly produced by the oxidative burst, although their detoxification mechanism is not fully understood. As results of our studies on flavonoid metabolism, we identified in Scutellaria cells a novel H2O2-metabolizing system that is closely linked with the metabolism of the flavone BAG. Such a H2O2-metabolizing system has not been hitherto reported. Like Scutellaria cells, rye leaves (23Anhalt S. Weissenböck G. Planta. 1992; 187: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar),Pueraria lobata cells (25Park H. Hakamatsuka T. Sankawa U. Ebizuka T. Phytochemistry. 1995; 38: 373-380Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 26Park H. Hakamatsuka T. Sankawa U. Ebizuka T. Z. Naturforsch. 1995; 50: 824-832Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar), apple leaves (27Podstolski A. Lewack S. Phytochemistry. 1970; 9: 289-296Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and garbanzo plants (28Hösel M. Barz W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 57: 607-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) also possess endogenous-flavonoid-specific glycosidase in addition to flavonoid glycosides. Interestingly, their aglycones are assumed to be oxidized by a peroxidase reaction or to have a potent antioxidant activity, suggesting that these plants may have ROS-detoxifying systems similar to that in Scutellariacells. The first step in the metabolic pathway of H2O2 is the hydrolysis of BAG by β-glucuronidase. Previously, we reported that β-glucuronidase inS. baicalensis shows a high activity for the endogenous flavone BAG, but its roles have remained unclear (17Morimoto S. Harioka T. Shoyama Y. Planta. 1995; 195: 535-540Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that β-glucuronidase catalyzes the production of an antioxidant flavone BA. Keppler and Novacky reported that exogenous addition of antioxidants reduces death of hypersensitively responding cells (29Keppler L.D. Novacky A. Physiol. Mol. Plant Pathol. 1987; 30: 233-245Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar), but surprisingly, Scutellaria cells can produce the antioxidant flavone BA in response to an elicitor or H2O2. To our knowledge, hydrolases involved in H2O2 metabolism have not been reported so far. Under normal conditions, BAG and β-glucuronidase are thought to exist in the different cellular compartments, because despite the presence of high β-glucuronidase activity, the amount of BA is much lower than that of BAG. We assumed that the oxidative burst inflicted serious damage on the compartmentation, resulting in the hydrolysis of BAG, based on the fact that after addition of an elicitor or H2O2, the cells released components that should exist within the cells into the extracellular medium. Flavonoid hydrolysis initiated by stress has also been reported for other plants. In P. lobata the hydrolysis of isoflavone glucosides is initiated by the elicitor treatment (25Park H. Hakamatsuka T. Sankawa U. Ebizuka T. Phytochemistry. 1995; 38: 373-380Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 26Park H. Hakamatsuka T. Sankawa U. Ebizuka T. Z. Naturforsch. 1995; 50: 824-832Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar), whereas the infection of pathogens to apple leaves causes hydrolysis of chalchone glucoside (27Podstolski A. Lewack S. Phytochemistry. 1970; 9: 289-296Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). As a second step, released BA was rapidly converted to DBA by cell wall peroxidases, and H2O2 was confirmed to be detoxified at this step. To characterize the properties of the enzymes in pure forms, we attempted to purify them from Scutellariacells. After a combination of ammonium-sulfate precipitation and two chromatographic steps, two ionic forms of peroxidases (peroxidases 1 and 2) were resolved. The structural properties of peroxidases 1 and 2 are similar to each other. The molecular mass (38 and 34 kDa) of each peroxidase resembles those of ascorbate peroxidase (34 kDa), guaiacol peroxidase (33 kDa), and extensin peroxidases (34–37 kDa) (10Asada K. Physiol. Plant. 1992; 85: 235-241Crossref Scopus (1230) Google Scholar). On the other hand, pI values (8.7 and 8.9) of peroxidases 1 and 2 indicated that they are cationic peroxidases. Among endogenous flavones tested, peroxidases 1 and 2 showed the highest H2O2-metabolizing activity with BA, and peroxidase 1 displayed somewhat higher activity than peroxidase 2. In contrast, both peroxidases could not oxidize other endogenous flavones including BAG. Scutellaria cells contain much more BAG than BA, indicating that H2O2 metabolism depends significantly on the hydrolysis of BAG. These findings provided a reasonable elucidation for the result that SAL treatment extensively reduced the ability of Scutellaria cells to metabolize H2O2. It is notable that H2O2 is effectively metabolized using luteolin as a proton donor. Neither luteolin nor its glycosides have been identified in S. baicalensis, but they do occur in numerous plants (30Wollenweber E. Jay M. Harborne J.B. The Flavonoid. Chapman and Hall, London1988: 233-302Google Scholar), thus suggesting that a similar detoxification of H2O2 may occur commonly in the plant kingdom. Anhalt and Weissenböck (23Anhalt S. Weissenböck G. Planta. 1992; 187: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) reported a metabolic pathway of luteolin glucuronide in rye leaves, where luteolin 7-O-di-glucuronyl-4′-O-glucuronide is hydrolyzed by endogenous β-glucuronidase, and the hydrolysate luteolin 7-O-diglucuronide is finally polymerized by a peroxidase reaction. Flavonoid polymerization by peroxidase is also reported for daidzein, the isoflavone of P. lobata. Park et al. (26Park H. Hakamatsuka T. Sankawa U. Ebizuka T. Z. Naturforsch. 1995; 50: 824-832Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar) demonstrated that in vitro peroxidase reaction with daidzein gives dimeric daidzein and unidentified polymers. We attempted similar reaction with BA and peroxidases, but such polymerization was not recognized, and only DBA was quantitatively produced. Therefore, we concluded that neither BA nor DBA is polymerized by peroxidases, contrary to the metabolism of luteolin 7-O-diglucuronide and daidzein, although the precise mechanism of DBA metabolism has remained still unclear. Concerning the roles of cell wall peroxidases in other plants, the insolubilization of extensin (7Bradley D.J. Kjellbom P.P. Lamb C.J. Cell. 1992; 70: 21-30Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar, 8Brownleader M.D. Ahmed N. Trevan M. Chaplin M.F. Dey P.M. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 1115-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and the biosynthesis of the cell wall including lignification (31Negrel J. Lherminier J. Planta. 1987; 172: 494-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) have been hitherto reported. Our study unequivocally demonstrated a novel function in which cell wall peroxidases rapidly metabolize a huge amount of H2O2 produced by the oxidative burst. These peroxidases and β-glucuronidase pre-exist in Scutellariacells, and neither activity was increased by the oxidative burst. The constitutive presence of these enzymes, in addition to a large amount of BAG, possibly enables cells to immediately induce the H2O2 degradation system. Ascorbate peroxidase and catalase are well known as H2O2-metabolizing enzymes. SAL is not an inhibitor for both enzymes, although the SAL treatment induces a serious damage in the elicited Scutellaria cells. Therefore, H2O2 detoxification by ascorbate peroxidase and catalase seems less effective as compared with the cell wall peroxidases. BA belongs to a quite different class of natural products from ascorbic acid, which is required for H2O2metabolism by ascorbate peroxidases, but it is interesting that both compounds act as a proton donor. The cell wall peroxidases of S. baicalensis and ascorbate peroxidase may metabolize H2O2 by a similar mechanism because both peroxidase reactions afforded a product (DBA and dehydroascorbic acid) with a diketone moiety. In conclusion, BAG and BA were shown to be involved in the protection of Scutellaria cells against oxidative stress, whereas other interesting roles were also suggested for BAG metabolism. It seems particularly important that BA is rapidly formed in response to the elicitor because BA has antibacterial (12Kubo M. Kimura Y. Odani T. Tani T. Namba K. Planta Med. 1981; 43: 194-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and antiviral (13Austin C.A. Patel S. Ono K. Nakane H. Fisher L.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 883-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) effects. We also confirmed that BA shows antibacterial activity forClavibactor michiganensis subsup. nebraskense andC. michiganensis subsup.michiganensis, 2N. Furuya, N. Matsuyama, S. Morimoto, and Y. Shoyama, unpublished data.suggesting that BA may contribute to a chemical defense against pathogens. Because more DBA was produced than BA during the oxidative burst, we are now examining the antimicrobial activity of DBA as well as BA using various pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W1638608431,"High endothelial venules (HEVs) are specialized postcapillary venules found in lymphoid organs and chronically inflamed tissues that support high levels of lymphocyte extravasation from the blood. Studies with chlorate, a metabolic inhibitor of sulfation, had previously revealed that production of PAPS (3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate), the high-energy donor of sulfate, is required for sulfation and high-affinity recognition of HEV sialomucins GlyCAM-1 and CD34 by the lymphocyte homing receptor L-selectin. Here, we report the molecular characterization of a novel 2.5 kb human cDNA from MECA-79+ HEV-derived endothelial cells that encodes the target of chlorate, PAPS synthetase, a multifunctional enzyme containing domains for both ATP sulfurylase and adenosine-5'-phosphosulfate kinase. Functional expression of the isolated cDNA in Chinese hamster ovary cells results in high levels of PAPS synthesis, which is abolished by treatment of the transfected cells with chlorate. Northern blot analysis reveals a wide tissue distribution of PAPS synthetase mRNA in the human body, suggesting that human PAPS synthetase may be important for sulfation not only of HEV sialomucins, but also of many other molecules, including mucins such as the P-selectin ligand PSGL-1, proteoglycans, hormones, neurotransmitters, drugs, and xenobiotics."

The lipid A 4′-kinase catalyzes the transfer of the γ-phosphate from ATP to the 4′-position of tetraacyldisaccharide 1-phosphate (DS-1-P) to form tetraacyldisaccharide 1,4′-bis-phosphate (lipid IVA) (Fig. 1) (9Ray B.L. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1122-1128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the 4′-OH group is necessary for the action of distal biosynthetic enzymes, such as the Kdo transferase (10Brozek K.A. Hosaka K. Robertson A.D. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol.

The lipid A 4′-kinase gene was recently identified as orfE(a previously reported open reading frame of unknown function) (12Karow M. Georgopoulos C. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and it is now referred to as lpxK (8Garrett T.A. Kadrmas J.L. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21855-21864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). lpxK forms an operon with an essential upstream gene, called msbA, which has homology to ABC transporters and mammalian Mdr proteins (12Karow M. Georgopoulos C. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar,13Polissi A. Georgopoulos C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 1221-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). msbA has been implicated in the transport of lipid A from its site of biosynthesis on the inner surface of the inner membrane to the outer membrane (12Karow M. Georgopoulos C. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 13Polissi A. Georgopoulos C. Mol.

Microbiol. 1996; 20: 1221-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) constructed a strain with an Ω-cam cassette inserted in the msbA gene. Because lpxK is co-transcribed with msbA (12Karow M. Georgopoulos C. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 13Polissi A. Georgopoulos C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 1221-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), this insertion stops expression of both msbA and lpxK. Complementation analysis showed that both msbA and lpxK were required for growth (12Karow M. Georgopoulos C. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). It has also been found that glucosamine-labeled LPS precursors accumulate in the inner membrane ofmsbA/lpxK knock-outs (13Polissi A. Georgopoulos C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 1221-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This phenomenon was attributed to the loss of the putative transport protein, MsbA. However, given the fact that lpxK plays an integral role in the biosynthesis of lipid A (8Garrett T.A. Kadrmas J.L. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21855-21864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), the apparent accumulation of LPS in the inner membrane might be due to the build up of lipid A precursor(s), which could accumulate when the 4′-kinase is inactivated. These precursors may not be efficiently transported to the outer membrane by the putative lipid A transport machinery and may even inhibit transport of lipid A. Direct evidence for the function of MsbA as a lipid A transporter in strains bearing extra copies oflpxK is presented in the accompanying manuscript (43Zhou Z. White K.A. Polissi A. Georgopoulos C. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12466-12475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In the present work, we have constructed a strain with an insertion mutation in only the lpxK gene. In strain TG1/pTAG1 the chromosomal copy of lpxK is inactivated by insertion of a kanamycin resistance cassette into the center of the lpxKgene. This insertion mutation is complemented by a plasmid carryinglpxK + and a temperature-sensitive origin of replication. Thus, the lpxK knock-out genotype can be induced by growth at 44 °C. At this temperature the hybrid plasmid carrying lpxK + is no longer maintained in the cells, and both the lpxK gene and its product are gradually lost. Under these conditions, the phenotype of cells with no lipid A 4′-kinase can be examined. We now show that the 4′-kinase (LpxK) is indeed required for growth, and upon its depletion, the expected precursor, DS-1-P, accumulates in cells. 32Pi was obtained from NEN Life Science Products; 0.25-mm glass-backed Silica Gel 60 thin layer chromatography plates and high performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) plates were from E.

Aldea M. Washburn B.K. Babitzke P. Kushner S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4617-4622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pJK2 (8Garrett T.A. Kadrmas J.L. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21855-21864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and pMAK705 were digested with XbaI andBamHI. The 1-kb lpxK gene from pJK2 and the 6-kb linearized pMAK705 were gel-purified from a 1% agarose gel. ThelpxK gene was ligated into pMAK705. A portion of the ligation mixture was transformed into competent E. coliXL1-Blue (Stratagene), and colonies resistant to chloramphenicol were selected. Plasmid DNA was isolated from chloramphenicol-resistant clones and digested with XbaI and BamHI to identify those constructs with the desired insert. This plasmid is called pTAG1. This plasmid was tested for its ability to promote LpxK expression. A plasmid analogous to pTAG1 was constructed with a kanamycin cassette inserted into the NsiI site of lpxK gene. pJK2 was digested with NsiI, and pUC-4K (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was digested with PstI. The 5.5-kb linearized pJK2 and the 1.2-kb kanamycin cassette from pUC-4K were gel-purified and ligated together. A portion of the ligation was transformed intoE. coli XL1-Blue, and colonies resistant to ampicillin were selected. Plasmids were isolated from ampicillin-resistant colonies and digested with NdeI and BamHI to verify the presence of the correct 2.2-kb insert. ThelpxK::kan construct described above was digested with XbaI and BamHI and cloned into pMAK705 exactly as for pTAG1, yielding pTAG2. pNGH1-amp was constructed from pNGH1 (16Odegaard T.J. Kaltashov I.A. Cotter R.J. Steeghs L. van der Ley P. Khan S. Maskell D.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19688-19696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). pNGH1 was digested withBamHI and SalI yielding 3.9- and 1.6-kb fragments. pACYC177 was digested with BamHI andXhoI yielding 2.5- and 1.4-kb fragments. The 2.5-kb pACYC177 fragment which contains the β-lactamase gene and 1.6-kb pNGH1 fragment which contains the trc promoter were ligated together to form pNGH1-amp. To construct pTAG6, pJK2 was digested with NdeI, and the 5′-overhang was filled in with Klenow DNA polymerase according to manufacturer's directions (New England Biolabs). The lpxKgene was excised by further digestion with BamHI, yielding a 985-base pair fragment with one blunt end and one BamHI sticky end. pNGH1-amp was digested with SmaI andBamHI. The lpxK fragment was ligated into the digested pNGH1-amp. A portion of the ligation was transformed into XL1-Blue competent cells, and colonies resistant to ampicillin were selected. Plasmid DNA was isolated from ampicillin-resistant clones and was digested with BamHI and SacI to verify the presence of the correct insert. One such plasmid was called pTAG6. pTAG8 is the Francisella novicida 4′-kinase gene,valB, cloned into pACYC177. pKEM14-5 (17Mdluli K.E. Anthony L.S. Baron G.S. McDonald M.K. Myltseva S.V. Nano F.E. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 3309-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) was digested withNdeI, and the 5′-overhang was filled in with Klenow DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs). A fragment containing valBand a portion of the downstream polA gene was excised by further digestion with HindIII, yielding a ∼1800-base pair fragment with one blunt end and one HindIII sticky end. pACYC177 was digested with SmaI and HindIII. ThevalB fragment was ligated into the digested pACYC177. A portion of the ligation was transformed into XL1-Blue competent cells, and colonies resistant to ampicillin were selected. Plasmid DNA was isolated from ampicillin-resistant clones and was digested withEcoRV and NdeI to verify the presence of the correct insert. One such plasmid was called pTAG8. TG1/pTAG1 was constructed following the method of Hamilton et al. (15Hamilton C.M. Aldea M. Washburn B.K. Babitzke P. Kushner S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4617-4622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.2). Competent MC1061 cells (18Crowell D.N. Anderson M.S. Raetz C.R.H. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 168: 152-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were transformed with pTAG2 and grown at 30 °C to anA 600 of 0.6. Next, 1 × 105cells were plated on prewarmed LB plates containing 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol and incubated at 44 °C. This selects for cells in which pTAG2 has integrated into the genome. A single colony was used to inoculate 1 ml of LB containing chloramphenicol and grown at 30 °C to stationary phase. A portion of the culture was diluted 1:1000 into fresh LB containing chloramphenicol and again grown at 30 °C to stationary phase. The above outgrowth was repeated once more. During this outgrowth, the integrated plasmid will occasionally excise carrying either the wild type lpxK or thelpxK::kan allele (Fig. 2) (15Hamilton C.M. Aldea M. Washburn B.K. Babitzke P. Kushner S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4617-4622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were plated on LB containing chloramphenicol at 30 °C. Cells in which the plasmid had excised were identified by their inability to grow at 44 °C in the presence of chloramphenicol. Plasmids were then isolated from 14 such temperature-sensitive strains and digested withXbaI and BamHI. Of the 14 colonies, 11 contained the pTAG2 insert. Three, however, had the pTAG1 insert, indicating that the lpxK::kan allele had replaced the wild typelpxK gene on the chromosome (15Hamilton C.M. Aldea M. Washburn B.K. Babitzke P. Kushner S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4617-4622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One of these strains was made recA − by P1 transduction using BLR(DE3)pLysS (Novagen) as the donor. The presence of the recA− phenotype was verified by the strain's sensitivity to UV light (19Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1989: 1.4.7Google Scholar). This strain is designated TG1/pTAG1. Strain TG1/pTAG6 was made by transforming TG1/pTAG1 with pTAG6 and selecting for transformants at 30 °C on LB plates containing ampicillin. Single colonies were then streaked to LB plates containing ampicillin to 44 °C. pTAG1 is then lost, and pTAG6 (which is not temperature-sensitive for replication) provides wild type lpxK. TG1/pTAG8 was constructed in a similar manner. Cell-free extracts for determination of 4′-kinase activity in cells grown at 44 °C were prepared as follows. Single colonies of TG1/pTAG1 and TG1/pTAG6 were inoculated into 5 ml of LB medium containing the appropriate antibiotics and grown at 30 °C overnight. Portions of the overnight cultures were diluted into 200 ml of LB broth (containing no antibiotics) to A 600of 0.01, and the growth temperature was shifted to 44 °C. When the cultures reached A 600 of 0.2–0.3, portions were diluted 10-fold into fresh pre-warmed medium, and the growth cycles were continued. The cells from the remaining cultures (about 180 ml) were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The cell pellets were washed with 200 ml of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4; the centrifugation was repeated, and the final cell pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of the same buffer. Meanwhile, the growth cycles of the diluted cultures were continued as above, diluting further as necessary to maintain logarithmic growth. The volumes of the cultures were adjusted to provide 180–200 ml of cell culture at A 600 of about 0.3 for preparation of cell-free extracts at the indicated times after the shift to 44 °C. To prepare cell-free extracts, cells were broken in a French pressure cell at 20,000 p.s.i., and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 3500 × g. The protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin as a standard. 4′-Kinase activity was assayed as described previously (8Garrett T.A. Kadrmas J.L. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21855-21864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Typically, 100 μm DS-1-32P (1000 cpm/nmol), 1 mg/ml cardiolipin, 50 mm Tris chloride, pH 8.5, 5 mm ATP, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 5 mmMgCl2 were mixed with 2 to 0.05 mg/ml protein fractions and incubated at 30 °C for various times. Reactions were stopped by spotting a portion onto a Silica Gel 60 thin layer chromatography plate. Plates were developed in chloroform/methanol/water/acetic acid (25:15:4:2, v:v), dried, and exposed to a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager screen. Conversion of DS-1-32P to 1-32P-lipid IVA was quantified using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). DS-1-32P and carrier DS-1-P were prepared as described previously (20Radika K. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14859-14867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Single colonies of TG1/pTAG1 and TG1/pTAG6 were inoculated into separate 3-ml cultures of LB medium containing the appropriate antibiotics and grown overnight at 30 °C. Each overnight culture was then diluted into two 25-ml portions of fresh LB medium (containing no antibiotics) to anA 600 of 0.01. One was grown at 30 °C and the other at 44 °C. The cells were labeled with32Pi for about two doubling times.32Pi (5 μCi/ml) was added to the cultures grown at 30 °C when the A 600 reached 0.15 and grown to an A 600 of 0.5. The cultures grown at 44 °C were diluted 10-fold into fresh prewarmed medium whenever theA 600 reached ∼0.2. When the cumulative growth yield was 13.4 for TG1/pTAG1 (the point at which the growth of TG1/pTAG1 begins to slow down) and 27.5 for TG1/pTAG6, both cultures were labeled with 5 μCi/ml 32Pi. TG1/pTAG1 was labeled for 3 h, and TG1/pTAG6 was labeled for 1.5 h. Each culture was split into three tubes (∼8 ml per tube). The cells were collected by centrifugation at 3000 × g, and the pellets were frozen at −20 °C for further analysis. Using one tube of each labeled culture, the lipid A to glycerophospholipid ratio was then determined as described previously (16Odegaard T.J. Kaltashov I.A. Cotter R.J. Steeghs L. van der Ley P.

Samples were analyzed by thin layer chromatography in a system containing chloroform/methanol/water/ammonia (40:25:4:2, v/v). HPTLC plates were used for rapid chromatography in this solvent system because the formation of an ammonia-catalyzed deacylation product was minimized. A large batch of TG1/pTAG1 that had been shifted to 44 °C was prepared as follows. Overnight cultures of TG1/pTAG1 and TG1/pTAG6 grown at 30 °C were used to inoculate LB medium to an A 600 of 0.01. Cultures were then grown at 44 °C and were diluted 10-fold as necessary to keep the optical density below 0.3 for 10.5 h. TG1/pTAG1 cultures were diluted into successively larger volumes to a final volume of 3 liters. A TG1/pTAG6 culture was maintained at 50 ml. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, washed once with PBS (1 liter for TG1/pTAG1 and 10 ml for TG1/pTAG6), and resuspended in PBS (30 ml for TG1/pTAG1 and 2 ml for TG/pTAG6). Lipid A precursor accumulation was examined in the non-labeled cells of TG1/pTAG1 and TG1/pTAG6 shifted to 44 °C for 10.5 h. TG1/pTAG1 cells (200 μl of the above 30-ml suspension) were brought to a volume of 2 ml by the addition of PBS. These TG1/pTAG1 cells and the entire 2-ml suspension of TG1/pTAG6 (as prepared above) were then extracted with a neutral single phase Bligh Dyer system (chloroform/methanol/PBS, 1:2:0.8) (22Bligh E.G.

https://openalex.org/W1994105720,"Transcription of the human squalene synthase (HSS) gene is regulated by variations in the level of cellular cholesterol. Three regulatory elements in the HSS promoter region are known to be involved in the regulation: 1) a modified sterol regulatory element (SRE) 1 (HSS-SRE-1), 2) an inverted SRE-3 (Inv-SRE-3), 3) an inverted Y box (Inv-Y-Box).We report here the regulatory role of distinct cis-elements in the HSS promoter by using mutants of an HSS-luciferase promoter reporter. The activity of a wild-type promoter reporter transiently transfected into HepG-2 cells is increased by sterol depletion of the cells or by coexpression of mature forms of the SRE-binding proteins (SREBP) 1a and SREBP-2. Differential activation by SREBP-1a and SREBP-2 of the reporter gene mutated at various regions of the promoter is observed. Mutation of either the HSS-SRE-1 or the Inv-SRE-3 sequence diminished the activation by SREBP-1a and by sterol depletion but did not affect the activation by SREBP-2. Simultaneous mutations of both of these sequences almost completely abolished activation of the promoter by SREBP-1a or by sterol depletion, but activation by SREBP-2 was retained at 70%. Mutation of the Inv-Y-Box sequence element decreased the activity of the promoter by 50% or more, and if mutated together with both SREs, the activation was almost completely abolished. Mutation of any single GC box of the two located at −40 to −57 did not affect activity, whereas simultaneous mutation of the two decreased activation by SREBP-2 by 60%, by lipid depletion by 20%, and had no effect on the activation by SREBP-1a. A Y box motif at −159 to −166 and an SRE-like sequence element (SRE-1(8/10)) at position −101 to −108 are also involved in the sterol regulation. These results indicate that the complex sterol-mediated transcriptional regulation of the HSS gene is due to the presence of multiple copies of diverse cis elements in the HSS promoter.

Squalene synthase (farnesyl-diphosphate:farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase, EC 2.5.1.21), which catalyzes the formation of squalene by condensation of two molecules of farnesyl diphosphate, is the first committed enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. Its expression, like that of several other key enzymes in the pathway such as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A synthase, and farnesyl diphosphate synthase, is highly regulated by cellular cholesterol homeostasis (1McKenzie T.L.

The precursor forms of the SREBPs are comprised of three segments: 1) an N-terminal region containing both a basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper DNA binding segment and an acidic transcription activation domain, 2) a middle domain that includes two membrane spanning regions, and 3) a C-terminal region (16Hua X. Sakai J. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29422-29427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Under sterol depletion conditions, the N-terminal segments are cleaved in two separate steps, thereby releasing the active forms of the SREBPs from the endoplasmic reticulum. They are then free to migrate to the nucleus and affect gene transcription (17Wang X. Sato R. Brown M.S. Hua X. Goldstein J.L.

Mutations transcribing shorter forms of the SREBP-2 protein, which include the N-terminal active domain, are not subject to this regulation and produce sterol-resistant phenotypes (20Yang J.

When liver cholesterol is depleted by dietary manipulations, expression and proteolytic activation of SREBP-1 is unaffected, whereas the transcription and activation of SREBP-2 is induced (21Sheng Z.

The promoters of the low density lipoprotein receptor, fatty acid synthase, and ACC contain GC box sequences, and the transcription factor Sp1 that binds to this motif can fulfill this function (10Sanchez H.B.

The binding of SREBP-1a to the promoter of farnesyl diphosphate synthase is enhanced by the general transcription factor NF-Y, which binds to CCAAT box sequences (8Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Lee B.C.

An NF-Y binding motif is also present in the promoter of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A synthase and is likely to participate in the sterol-mediated regulation of this gene (27Smith J.R. Osborne T.F. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Gil G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18480-18487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).We have previously demonstrated that the human squalene synthase (HSS) gene is transcriptionally regulated in the HepG-2 human hepatoma cell line (28Jiang G. McKenzie T.L. Conrad D.G. Shechter I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12818-12824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have also identified a 69-bp sequence in the HSS promoter, located 131 nucleotides 5′ to the transcription start site, that is necessary for the sterol-mediated regulation of an HSS-luciferase reporter gene (pHSS1kb-Luc) (29Guan G. Jiang G. Koch R.L. Shechter I J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21958-21965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of the 5′-flanking sequences of the HSS gene suggests that the sterol-mediated regulation of this gene is a complex mechanism. Four CCAAT boxes, three SRE-related motifs, and two GC boxes were identified there. Other sterol-regulated genes usually contain a single type of an SRE element and one of the two cis-elements that binds either NF-Y or Sp1. However, the presence of multiple copies of diverse elements in the HSS promoter strongly suggests that the regulation of this gene relies on multiple forms of interaction between the different transcription factors.We have shown that adipocyte determination- and differentiation dependent factor 1/SREBP-1c, the rat homologue of SREBP-1c (30Tontonoz P. Kim J.B. Graves R.A. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4753-4759Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar), binds to a sequence motif similar to the SRE-1 element in the low density lipoprotein receptor promoter, which we designated HSS-SRE-1. The regulatory effect of adipocyte determination- and differentiation-dependent factor 1/SREBP-1c on HSS promoter activity was verified by its activation of the pHSS1kb-Luc reporter in HepG-2 cells, indicating that the HSS-SRE-1 element in the HSS promoter may be functional (25Guan G.

Chem. 1995; 270: 21958-21965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). An SRE-3 element previously identified in the promoter of the farnesyl diphosphate synthase gene (8Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Lee B.C. Edwards P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 945-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) is present in an inverted orientation (Inv-SRE-3) 32 nucleotides 3′ to the HSS-SRE-1 sequence. In addition, an SRE motif with an 8-nucleotide sequence identity to the 10-bp SRE-1 element, designated SRE-1(8/10), is located 29 nucleotides 3′ to the Inv-SRE-3 element. These latter two SRE sequences were shown in electromobility shift assays to selectively bind SREBP-2 but not SREBP-1 (25Guan G. Dai P.-H. Osborne T.F. Kim J.B. Shechter I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10295-10302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).The CCAAT motif is known to bind the general transcription factor NF-Y. Two such sequences are found 17 and 49 nucleotides 5′ to the HSS-SRE-1 element. An additional inverted CCAAT sequence called the Y box is located between the HSS-SRE-1 and the Inv-SRE-3 elements (17 nucleotides 3′ to the HSS-SRE-1 sequence), and another form of CCAAT sequence that was previously shown to be essential in the transcription of the farnesyl diphosphate gene (8Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Lee B.C. Edwards P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 945-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) is present in an inverted orientation (Inv-Y-Box) between the Inv-SRE-3 and the SRE-1(8/10) elements (9 nucleotides 3′ to the Inv-SRE-3 element). The binding of NF-Y to the Inv-Y-Box was verified by gel mobility shift assays (25Guan G. Dai P.-H. Osborne T.F. Kim J.B. Shechter I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10295-10302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar,29Guan G. Jiang G. Koch R.L. Shechter I J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21958-21965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). It is of interest that the orientations of the SRE-3 and the Y box element in the HSS promoter are both inverted compared with those found in farnesyl diphosphate synthase. Their relative position in the promoter is reversed as well. In farnesyl diphosphate synthase, the Y box is 5′ to the SRE-3 sequence and they are separated by a 21-bp spacer. In HSS, the Inv-SRE-3 is 5′ to the Inv-Y-Box with a 9-bp separation. In both genes, the two elements are arranged sequentially to allow orientation in the same direction. This arrangement may be required for the interaction between an SREBP and NF-Y.The detailed regulation of the HSS gene and the relative importance of the multiple motifs is not known. Single transversal mutations of DNA regions covering most of the promoter failed to completely eliminate the sterol-mediated regulation of an HSS-luciferase reporter. However, significant loss of activation was observed when the HSS-SRE-1, Inv-SRE-3, or the Inv-Y-Box sequences were mutated. Multiple mutations showed that the contribution of these motifs in the activation of the promoter is additive (25Guan G. Dai P.-H. Osborne T.F. Kim J.B. Shechter I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10295-10302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).The purpose of the present study is to determine how the multiple motifs in the HSS promoter are involved in sterol regulation of the HSS gene. Using combinations of mutations in the HSS promoter, we have characterized elements involved in the regulation. Using these mutant promoters, we were able to identify sequences that differentially interact with SREBP-1a and SREBP-2 in the activation. These differences are, so far, unique to the HSS gene and may elucidate the specific physiological role of the SREBPs in sterol production.RESULTSThe functional relationship between previously identified cis-elements in the HSS promoter, a promoter that is involved in the sterol-mediated regulation, was investigated by mutational analysis. Fig. 1 shows the nucleotide sequence +1 to −200 of the HSS promoter and seven cis-elements that were previously identified as potentially important in the transcription of the HSS gene. This sequence was reported to be sufficient in conferring the sterol-mediated regulation of the promoter for the HSS gene (25Guan G. Dai P.-H. Osborne T.F. Kim J.B. Shechter I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10295-10302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Two GC boxes are present in position −40 to −57 gapped by six nucleotides. Two other sequences of interest that may potentially bind general transcription factors are Inv-Y-Box (−121 to −128) and a Y box (−159 to −161). We have also examined three other cis-elements with sequences of, or related to, SREs: an SRE-1(8/10) (−101 to −108), an Inv-SRE-3 (−138 to −147), and an HSS-SRE-1 sequence (−180 to −189) (25Guan G. Dai P.-H. Osborne T.F. Kim J.B. Shechter I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10295-10302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Since DNA gel retardation studies have indicated differences between the SREBPs in the binding to some of the above sequences (25Guan G. Dai P.-H. Osborne T.F. Kim J.B. Shechter I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10295-10302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), in the present study we have used mutational analysis to determine the functional significance of these elements in the activation of the HSS promoter by SREBP-1a and SREBP-2.We have constructed a series of reporter genes containing mutations in the DNA elements of interest. The sequences in pHSS1kb-Luc, which were modified by transversal replacement mutations, are indicated (m1 to m8) in Fig. 1. In addition, multiple combinations of these mutations in pHSS1kb-Luc were used for the study of the activation by the SREBPs. These studies were done in HepG-2 cells cotransfected with the mutated reporter constructs and an expression construct for one of the SREBPs. Transfected cells were grown in the presence of cholesterol and 25-hydroxycholesterol (suppression media). Promoter activation is given as -fold induction and was calculated from the ratio of luciferase activity in cell extracts transfected with one of the SREBPs to cells without it as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In each experiment, the activation of the mutated HSS promoter by the SREBPs was compared with its activation by lipid depletion in cells grown without sterols and in the presence of lovastatin (inducing media) and to the activation of the native pHSS1kb-Luc promoter in cells exposed to inducing media.The different mutants can be divided into three main groups. The first group consists of constructs having mutations of the HSS-SRE-1 and Inv-SRE-3 elements, which are the two sequences reported to be important in the sterol-mediated regulation of other genes, and the SRE-1(8/10) element. These studies were designed to evaluate the importance of these cis-acting elements in the activation of the promoter by the two SREBPs. The results of these studies are depicted in Fig. 2. As was reported earlier (25Guan G. Dai P.-H. Osborne T.F. Kim J.B. Shechter I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10295-10302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), SREBP-2 was somewhat more effective in the activation of the wild-type promoter in pHSS1kb-Luc (Fig. 2 a). Mutation of the HSS-SRE-1 sequence lowered the activation of the resulting promoter in pHSSm1-Luc by SREBP-1a or by inducing media but did not affect at all the activation by SREBP-2. At 1 μg of DNA/well, the activation by SREBP-1a was about 60% that of the activation obtained by SREBP-2 (Fig. 2 b). Similar results were obtained if instead, the Inv-SRE-3 sequence element was replaced (pHSSm2-Luc construct). Again, significantly lower activation of this promoter by SREBP-1a (about 45% that of SREBP-2 at 1 μg of DNA/well) or by inducing media was observed, but the activation by SREBP-2 was not affected in comparison to the wild-type promoter (Fig. 2 c). The most pronounced difference between the activation by SREBP-2 and SREBP-1a was observed using a promoter mutated in both the HSS-SRE-1 and the Inv-SRE-3 elements (pHSSm12-Luc). Although there is a small lowering (20% at 1 μg of DNA/well) in the activation by SREBP-2, the activation by SREBP-1a or by inducing media is almost completely diminished (Fig.2 d). In our earlier report a replacement mutation of the SRE-1(8/10) element by itself had a relatively small lowering effect in the activation of the HSS promoter (less than 30%) in transfected cells exposed to inducing medium (25Guan G. Dai P.-H. Osborne T.F. Kim J.B. Shechter I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10295-10302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, since the regulation of the HSS promoter may be an additive phenomenon contributed by the multiple regulatory sequences, it is necessary to study this sequence after eliminating other sequences that may possibly contribute to the regulation. Thus, we have decided to reexamine the regulatory contribution of this sequence in a construct in which both the HSS-SRE-1 and the Inv-SRE-3 elements were replaced. As expected, mutation of all the three SRE elements almost completely eliminated activation by lipid depletion or by SREBP-1a. However, unlike pHSSm12-Luc, this additional mutation (pHSSm124-Luc) almost completely abolished the activation by SREBP-2 as well (compare Fig. 2,d and e).The second group of experiments was designed to assess the importance of the Inv-Y-Box sequence in the activation of the HSS promoter by SREBPs or by sterol depletion. The actual sequence mutated is indicated as m3 in Fig. 1. The activation of a reporter gene containing this mutation (pHSSm3-Luc) is shown in Fig.3 a. There was a significantly lower activation by the SREBPs or by inducing media. Although SREBP-2 can activate the promoter to approximately 5-fold, the activation by SREBP-1a or by inducing media was only 3-fold. A similar effect was observed using a reporter construct containing, in addition, a mutation of the SRE-1 element (pHSSm13-Luc, Fig. 3 b) or the SRE-3 element (pHSSm23-Luc, Fig. 3 c). Although in each instance promoter activity is diminished, the activations most affected by these mutations were those induced by SREBP-1a or exposure of the cells to sterol depletion, whereas activation by SREBP-2 was approximately doubled. The most pronounced effect on activation was observed when all the three sequences above were mutated in the promoter (pHSSm123-Luc). The activity of this mutant HSS promoter was almost completely diminished regardless of the activation method (Fig.3 d).Figure 3Activation by SREBP-1a and SREBP-2 of HSS promoter with mutations at the Inv-Y-Box, the HSS-SRE-1, and the Inv-SRE-3 elements.

Shown are activations of the HSS promoter with mutation of the Inv-Y-Box element (pHSSm3-Luc) (a); double mutation of the HSS-SRE-1 and the Inv-Y-Box elements (pHSSm13-Luc) (b); double mutation of Inv-SRE-3 and the Inv-Y-Box elements (pHSSm23-Luc) (c); triple mutation of the HSS-SRE-1, Inv-SRE-3, and Inv-Y-Box elements (pHSSm123-Luc) (d).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The third group of mutations was studied to determine the involvement of the two GC box sequences in the HSS promoter. In earlier work we reported that mutation of sequences containing the most 5′ GC box element (−52 to −57) did not affect the sterol-mediated regulation of this promoter (25Guan G. Dai P.-H. Osborne T.F. Kim J.B. Shechter I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10295-10302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the regulatory relationship between the two GC boxes and the three SREs located 5′ to them. For this purpose we have first used a construct in which the two most 5′ SREs were mutated away (pHSSm12-Luc) and in it, sequentially replaced the m6 sequences containing the 3′ GC box element (pHSSm126-Luc), the m7 sequences containing the 5′ GC box element (pHSSm127-Luc), and the m5 region that includes the two GC boxes (pHSSm125-Luc). Mutation of a single element in a construct lacking these SREs had minimal or no effect on the activation by the two SREBPs or by sterols. In each mutant, the activation by SREBP-2 was mostly retained (about 7- and 10-fold at 1 μg of DNA/well), whereas activation by SREBP-1a or by sterol depletion was low (only 2–3-fold at 1 μg of DNA/well) (Figs. 4,a and b). However, if both GC boxes were replaced, the activation by SREBP-2 was substantially lowered as well (3-fold at 1 μg of DNA/well), although it was still twice as high as the activation by SREBP-1a. (Fig. 4 c). Interestingly, a mutant promoter in which only the two GC boxes were replaced (pHSSm5-Luc) retained its activation by SREBP-1a or by sterol depletion, but this time the activation by SREBP-2 was significantly lower (about 4.5-fold at 1 μg of DNA/well) (Fig. 4 d). Mutation of the two GC boxes together with the SRE-1(8/10) caused nondiscriminatory loss of 50% activation by the SREBPs and by lipid depletion (pHSSm45-Luc in Fig. 4 e), whereas mutation of the Y box in addition to the two GC box sequences (pHSSm58-Luc) had a pronounced lowering of activation by lipid depletion but little effect on the activation by the two SREBPs (compare Fig. 4, d andf). The mutation of the Y box by itself did not affect the activation by SREBP-1a. However, activation by lipid depletion was lowered by 31% and, although low concentrations of SREBP-2 were effective in the activation, further activation using amounts of SREBP-2 above 100 ng of DNA/well was not achieved (Fig. 4 g).Figure 4Activation by SREBP-1a and SREBP-2 of HSS promoter with mutations at the two GC boxes and the HSS-SRE-1, Inv-SRE-3, SRE-1(8/10), and Y box elements.

https://openalex.org/W2033554275,"Excitatory neurotransmitters such as glutamate are required for the normal functioning of the central nervous system but can trigger excitotoxic neuronal injury if allowed to accumulate to abnormally high levels. Their extracellular levels are controlled primarily by transmitter uptake into astrocytes. Here, we demonstrate that the amyloid protein precursor may participate in the regulation of this important process. The amyloid protein precursor has been well conserved through evolution, and a number of studies indicate that it may function as an endogenous excitoprotectant. However, the mechanisms underlying this neuroprotective capacity remain largely unknown. At moderate levels of expression, human amyloid protein precursors increased glutamate/aspartate uptake in brains of transgenic mice, with the 751-amino acid isoform showing greater potency than the 695-amino acid isoform. Cerebral glutamate/aspartate transporter protein levels were higher in transgenic mice than in non-transgenic controls, whereas transporter mRNA levels were unchanged. Amyloid protein precursor-dependent stimulation of aspartate uptake by cultured primary astrocytes was associated with increases in protein kinase A and C activity and could be blocked by inhibitors of these kinases. The stimulation of astroglial excitatory amino acid transport by amyloid protein precursors could protect the brain against excitotoxicity and may play an important role in neurotransmission.

The amyloid protein precursor has been well conserved through evolution, and a number of studies indicate that it may function as an endogenous excitoprotectant. However, the mechanisms underlying this neuroprotective capacity remain largely unknown. At moderate levels of expression, human amyloid protein precursors increased glutamate/aspartate uptake in brains of transgenic mice, with the 751-amino acid isoform showing greater potency than the 695-amino acid isoform. Cerebral glutamate/aspartate transporter protein levels were higher in transgenic mice than in non-transgenic controls, whereas transporter mRNA levels were unchanged. Amyloid protein precursor-dependent stimulation of aspartate uptake by cultured primary astrocytes was associated with increases in protein kinase A and C activity and could be blocked by inhibitors of these kinases. The stimulation of astroglial excitatory amino acid transport by amyloid protein precursors could protect the brain against excitotoxicity and may play an important role in neurotransmission. The amino acids l-glutamate andl-aspartate are the main excitatory neurotransmitters in the central nervous system (1Fagg G.E. Foster A.C. Neuroscience. 1983; 9: 701-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar) and, if allowed to accumulate to abnormally high levels, can derange the neuronal calcium homeostasis and trigger cell death, a process referred to as “excitotoxicity” (2Olney J.W. Can. Dis. Wkly. Rep. 1990; 16: 47-57PubMed Google Scholar). Excitotoxicity appears to play an important role in a number of neurodegenerative diseases (3Lipton S.A. Rosenberg P.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 330: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (2550) Google Scholar). In vitro and in vivo studies indicate that the amyloid β protein precursor (APP) 1The abbreviations used are: APP, amyloid β protein precursor; h, human; hAPP, human APP; EAAT, excitatory amino acid transporter; NSE, neuron-specific enolase; PKC, protein kinase C; PKA, protein kinase A; RPA, RNase protection assay; GFX, GF 109203X; s-hAPP, secreted N-terminal fragment of human APP (resulting from α-secretase cleavage); s-APP, secreted APP; THA,l(−)-threo-3-hydroxyaspartate; trans-PDC,l-trans-pyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylic acid; Aβ, amyloid β peptide; Tg, transgenic. may function as an important endogenous excitoprotectant (4Mattson M.P.

Mallory M. Veinberg I. Sheldon E. Mucke L. Neuroscience. 1997; 78: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). APP is expressed at relatively high levels in the central nervous system of diverse species (6Martin-Morris L.E. White K. Development. 1990; 110: 185-195PubMed Google Scholar, 7Torroja L. Luo L.Q. White K. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 4638-4650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Multiple APP isoforms are derived from a single gene by alternative splicing (see Ref. 8Rockenstein E.M. McConlogue L. Tan H. Gordon M. Power M. Masliah E. Mucke L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28257-28267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar for review). The most prevalent forms of APP are 695–770-amino acid glycoproteins with a large extracellular region, a hydrophobic membrane-spanning domain, and a short cytoplasmic segment (9Kang J. Lemaire H.-G. Unterbeck A. Salbaum J.M. Masters C.L. Grzeschik K.-H. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Müller Hill B. Nature. 1987; 325: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (3957) Google Scholar). Proteolytic processing of APP by a presumed “α-secretase” results in the secretion of a large N-terminal ectodomain (s-APP). An alternative APP processing pathway gives rise to the Aβ peptide, which appears to play a central role in Alzheimer's disease (10Lendon C.L. Ashall F. Goate A.M. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1997; 277: 825-831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell types differ with respect to the predominant APP isoform they produce and in how much of the APP they synthesize is secreted or retained within the cell. APP695 is produced primarily by neurons, whereas APP751, which contains a Kunitz-type protease inhibitor domain, is produced by many different cell types (11Neve R.L. Finch E.A. Dawes L.R. Neuron. 1988; 1: 669-677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Neurons are the primary source of APP in the brain and, in humans, express both hAPP695 and hAPP751 (11Neve R.L. Finch E.A. Dawes L.R. Neuron. 1988; 1: 669-677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). In vitro studies indicate that brain cells secrete roughly 10–40% of their APP (12LeBlanc A.C. Papadopoulos M. Bélair C. Chu W. Crosato M. Powell J. Goodyer C.G. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1183-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar,13LeBlanc A.C. Xue R. Gambetti P. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 2300-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Expressing full-length APPs in cultured cells or adding s-APP to their media promotes neurite outgrowth, enhances cell survival, and protects cells from a variety of cytotoxic agents (14Araki W.

A number of studies suggest that APP may play an important role in neuroplasticity. APP is localized preferentially at central and peripheral synaptic sites (16Schubert W. Prior R. Weidemann A.

Biol. 1994; 161: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). To elucidate the effects of hAPPs on the central nervous systemin vivo, we previously placed cDNAs encoding full-length hAPP695 or hAPP751 downstream of the neuron-specific enolase (NSE) promoter and used the resulting fusion genes to generate multiple lines of NSE-hAPP transgenic mice (22Mucke L. Masliah E. Johnson W.B. Ruppe M.D. Alford M. Rockenstein E.M. Forss-Petter S. Pietropaolo M. Mallory M. Abraham C.R. Brain Res. 1994; 666: 151-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The levels of neuronal hAPP expression directed by the NSE promoter resulted in only moderate elevations of total APP expression above levels found in nontransgenic controls and, hence, were substantially lower than those found in hAPP models that develop Alzheimer's disease-type neuropathology (8Rockenstein E.M.

NSE-driven neuronal overexpression of hAPP in transgenic mice or intracerebroventricular infusion of hAPP fragments in nontransgenic rodents increased the number of presynaptic terminals in the neocortex and protected neurons against ischemia and excitotoxins (5Masliah E.

Alford M. Masliah E. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1551-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), suggesting that APP may fulfill important neurotrophic and neuroprotective functions in vivo. In vitrostudies suggest that s-APP may prevent excitotoxicity by stabilizing intraneuronal calcium levels (4Mattson M.P. Cheng B. Culwell A.R. Esch F.S. Lieberburg I. Rydel R.E. Neuron. 1993; 10: 243-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms by which APP exerts excitoprotective effects in vivo have not yet been identified. Recent studies indicate that high affinity, Na+-dependent uptake of excitatory amino acid transmitters from the extracellular space of the brain is necessary for the prevention of excitotoxicity and neurodegeneration (28Rothstein J.D. Neurology. 1996; 47: S19-S25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Rothstein J.D. Dykes-Hoberg M. Pardo C.A. Bristol L.A. Jin L. Kuncl R.W. Kanai Y. Hediger M.A. Wang Y. Schielke J.P. Welty D.F. Neuron. 1996; 16: 675-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2153) Google Scholar). This uptake is mediated by a family of membrane proteins, the excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) (30Balcar V.J. Li Y. Life Sci. 1992; 51: 1467-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 31Kanai Y. Smith C.P.

Five EAATs have been cloned: EAAT1 (or GLAST), EAAT2 (or GLT-1), EAAT3 (or EAAC1), EAAT4, and EAAT5 (34Storck T. Schulte S. Hofman K. Stoffel W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 6-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). EAAT1 is localized in subsets of neurons and astrocytes, whereas other EAATs are expressed primarily in astrocytes (EAAT2) or neurons (EAAT3) (38Rothstein J.D. Martin L. Levey A.I. Dykes-Hoberg M. Jin L. Wu D. Nash N. Kuncl R.W. Neuron. 1994; 13: 713-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1473) Google Scholar). Here, we report that hAPP stimulates aspartate uptake in cultures of primary murine astrocytes and in brains of NSE-hAPP transgenic mice. We also provide evidence that hAPP increases the availability of EAATs and that this process involves the activity of protein kinase A and C. This newly identified APP function could play an important role in the prevention of excitotoxic neuronal injury and in neurotransmission. Transgenic Mice and Kainic Acid Injections—Male and female C57BL/6 × SJL mice, 9–10 months old, were used in this study. Transgenic mice were from previously described NSE-hAPP lines (22Mucke L. Masliah E. Johnson W.B. Ruppe M.D. Alford M. Rockenstein E.M. Forss-Petter S. Pietropaolo M. Mallory M. Abraham C.R. Brain Res. 1994; 666: 151-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar): NSE-hAPP751–28 (n = 4), NSE-hAPP751m-57 (n = 14), NSE-hAPP695–60 (n = 4), and NSE-hAPP695m-25 (n = 12). Nontransgenic littermates (n = 17) served as controls. The levels and distribution of hAPP expression in brains of mice from different NSE-hAPP lines have been described in detail elsewhere (5Masliah E. Westland C.E. Rockenstein E.M. Abraham C.R. Mallory M. Veinberg I. Sheldon E. Mucke L. Neuroscience. 1997; 78: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 8Rockenstein E.M. McConlogue L. Tan H. Gordon M. Power M. Masliah E. Mucke L. J.

Pietropaolo M. Mallory M. Abraham C.R. Brain Res. 1994; 666: 151-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). All transgenic mice included in this study were heterozygous with respect to the transgene. Some mice were challenged with the excitotoxin kainic acid essentially as described previously (5Masliah E. Westland C.E. Rockenstein E.M. Abraham C.R. Mallory M. Veinberg I. Sheldon E. Mucke L. Neuroscience. 1997; 78: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Kainic acid (Sigma) was diluted in 0.9% NaCl and injected intraperitoneally at a single dose of 25 mg/kg body weight. Mice were analyzed 4 days after the injection. Controls were either untreated or sham-injected with vehicle, as specified under “Results,” and analyzed in parallel. Mice were deeply anesthetized with chloral hydrate and perfused transcardially with cold 0.9% NaCl. Brains were divided sagittally, and individual hemibrains were snap frozen in isopentane cooled in a Histobath (Shandon Lipshaw, Pittsburgh, PA). Subsequently, frontal and parietal neocortices were isolated and processed for Western blot analysis or aspartate uptake assay as described further below. Total RNA was isolated from snap frozen hemibrains with TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH). Levels of EAAT1, EAAT2, and EAAT3 mRNAs were determined by RNase protection assay (RPA), essentially as described (8Rockenstein E.M. McConlogue L. Tan H. Gordon M. Power M. Masliah E. Mucke L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28257-28267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), using the following 32P-labeled antisense riboprobes (protected sequences in parentheses): EAAT1 probe (nucleotides 1586–1706 of murine EAAT1; GenBank accession no. L19565), EAAT2 probe (nucleotides 1686–1914 of murine EAAT2; GenBank accession no. U11763), EAAT3 probe (nucleotides 1488–1651 of murine EAAT3; GenBank accession no. D43797), actin probe (nucleotides 480–559 of murine β-actin cDNA; GenBank accession no. M18194). RNA (10 μg) hybridized to32P-labeled antisense riboprobes was digested with 43 units/ml RNase T1 (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 20 μg/ml RNase A (Sigma) in 100 μl of digestion buffer followed by protein digestion with 3.5 mg/ml proteinase K (Sigma) in 6.5% laurylsarcosine. Subsequently, RNA was isolated with 4 m guanidine thiocyanate and precipitated in isopropanol. Samples were separated on 5% acrylamide, 8 m urea Tris-borate-EDTA gels, and dried gels were exposed to Biomax® film (Eastman Kodak Corp.). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against different EAATs (0.25 μg/ml) were raised at Research Genetics Inc. (Huntsville, AL) with synthetic peptides corresponding to the C-terminal region of the EAAT1, EAAT2, and EAAT3 proteins, as described (38Rothstein J.D. Martin L. Levey A.I. Dykes-Hoberg M. Jin L. Wu D. Nash N. Kuncl R.W. Neuron. 1994; 13: 713-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1473) Google Scholar). The particulate fraction was isolated from neocortical homogenates and subjected to Western blot analysis essentially as described (22Mucke L. Masliah E. Johnson W.B. Ruppe M.D. Alford M.

Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 42: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To ensure equal loading, the protein content of all samples was determined by the Lowry method (40Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and adjusted with homogenization buffer to 1.25 mg/ml; 40 μg of brain protein were loaded per lane. Samples from the particulate fractions were electrophoretically separated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were incubated sequentially with blocking solution, primary antibody (diluted 1:1000, incubated at 4 °C overnight), and radioiodinated protein A (ICN, Irvine, CA) (0.1 μCi/ml, incubated at room temperature for 2 h). Signals were quantitated with a Phosphor-Imager SF (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) using ImageQuant software and expressed as integrated pixel intensities over defined volumes (22Mucke L. Masliah E. Johnson W.B. Ruppe M.D. Alford M. Rockenstein E.M. Forss-Petter S. Pietropaolo M. Mallory M. Abraham C.R. Brain Res. 1994; 666: 151-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). As controls, similar blots were incubated with preimmune sera or with the antibody preadsorbed with a 20-fold excess of the corresponding specific peptide. Primary astrocytes were obtained from whole brains of nontransgenic neonatal mice, essentially as described previously (41Wyss-Coray T. Masliah E. Toggas S.M. Rockenstein E.M. Brooker M.J. Lee H.S. Mucke L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 789-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, brains were disrupted in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 15% fetal bovine serum by passing gently through an 18-gauge needle. The cell suspension was transferred into T25 flasks coated with poly-l-lysine (Sigma) (one brain per flask). On day 2, the flasks were shaken at 100 rotations/min for 2 h at 37 °C to remove cell debris and nonastrocytic cells. Primary astrocytes (>95% pure by immunolabeling with antibodies to cell-specific markers) from different mice were then combined and maintained in culture for 21 days. Two days before the aspartate uptake assay (culture day 19), the medium was replaced with Neurobasal medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing N2 supplement (Life Technologies, Inc.). Recombinant s-hAPP695 and s-hAPP751 were produced and purified as described (42Barger S.W. Fiscus R.R. Ruth P. Hofmann F. Mattson M.P. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 2087-2096Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The integrity of these preparations was verified after HPLC purification by comparing immunoreactive bands obtained on Western blot analysis with antibodies directed against the N terminus or the C terminus of α-secreted hAPP. s-hAPP695 and s-hAPP751 were dissolved separately in 1 m NaCl and 20 mm Tris (pH 7.2). Astrocyte cultures were treated (without exchange of media) for 30 min with different concentrations of these s-hAPP isoforms (1 pm, 10 pm, 0.1 nm, and 1 nm) or with vehicle alone. Binding ofd-[3H]aspartate (NEN Life Science Products) to membrane preparations from neocortex was determined by a method modified from Cross et al. (43Cross A.J. Skan W.J. Slater P. Neurosci. Lett. 1986; 63: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and used to estimate neocortical glutamate/aspartate uptake, essentially as described previously (44Masliah E. Alford M. DeTeresa R. Mallory M. Hansen L. Ann. Neurol. 1996; 40: 759-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Before analysis, all samples were assigned codes, and the codes were broken only after all results had been downloaded into the data base. Frozen samples of neocortex (50–70 mg, wet weight) were sonicated in 1 ml of buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl/300 mm NaCl, pH 7.4); 9 ml of buffer were added, and the samples were centrifuged at 21,780 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was decanted and the pellet resuspended in 6 ml of buffer. Total protein was determined by the Lowry method (40Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were diluted to 0.4 mg/ml total protein. Triplicate tubes (1 ml total volume per tube) each containing 40 μg (100 μl) of washed membranes, d-[3H]aspartic acid (50 nm final concentration), and cold d-aspartic acid (4,000 nm final concentration) were incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Nonspecific binding was determined by adding cold aspartic acid at 10-fold excess to otherwise identical incubation tubes. Bound ligand was separated from free ligand by filtration through 0.45-μm glass fiber filters on a disposable filtration manifold (V&P Scientific, San Diego, CA). After addition of 5 ml of EcoLume scintillation mixture (ICN BioMedicals, Costa Mesa CA), filter disks were counted with a TM Analytic 6881 Mark III scintillation spectrophotometer. Results were expressed as picomoles ofd-aspartate bound/mg of total protein. To determine the kinetics of d-aspartate binding, neocortical membrane preparations (20 μg of total protein) were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with d-[3H]aspartic acid (0.05 μm) in the presence of increasing concentrations of cold d-aspartate (0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6, 3.2, 4.8, and 6.4 μm). For each mouse and dose of coldd-aspartate, d-[3H]aspartate binding was then determined in quadruplicate, essentially as described above. To confirm the specificity of d-[3H]aspartate binding to glutamate/aspartate transporters under the conditions used here, displacement curves were obtained with unlabeledl-glutamate orl-β-threo-3-hydroxyaspartate (THA) (both from Sigma). THA has been shown previously to specifically inhibit glutamate/aspartate uptake (45Rothstein J.D. Jin L. Dykes-Hoberg M. Kuncl R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6591-6595Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). 20 μg of neocortical membrane proteins (by Lowry assay), 20 nmd-[3H]aspartate, and displacers ranging in concentration from 1 nm to 30 μm were incubated in 1-ml incubation volumes in triplicate tubes for 30 min at room temperature, as described previously (44Masliah E. Alford M. DeTeresa R. Mallory M. Hansen L. Ann. Neurol. 1996; 40: 759-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding was defined as binding in the presence of 0.1 mm coldd-aspartate added to otherwise identical incubation tubes. Unbound ligand was separated by rapid filtration through 0.45-μm filter disks on disposable microfold filtration manifolds. Filter disks were washed twice with 200 μl of buffer and counted in a scintillation spectrophotometer. For aspartate uptake measurements in primary astrocyte cultures, cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 104 cells/well.d-[3H]Aspartic acid (NEN Life Science Products) was used at 0.6 μCi/well, and the final concentration was adjusted to 4,000 nm with cold d-aspartic acid. After an additional 30 min of incubation at 37 °C the cultures were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, followed by cell lysis in 2 n KOH, scintillation counting, and protein determination (Micro BCA protein assay reagent kit; Pierce). Exposure of cultures tol-trans-pyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylic acid (trans-PDC; 20 μm final concentration) (Research Biochemicals International, Natick, MA) was used to specifically inhibit glutamate/aspartate transporters (46Bridges R.J. Stanley M.S. Anderson M.W. Cotman C.W. Chamberlin A.R. J. Med. Chem. 1991; 34: 717-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Two independent batches of primary astrocytes were used to determine the kinetics of astroglial aspartate uptake. In each experiment, cells were incubated for 30 min with vehicle (control) or s-hAPPs (1 nm) in the presence ofd-[3H]aspartate (570 nm) and increasing concentrations of cold aspartate (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6, 3.2, 6.4, 12.8, 25.6, and 51.2 μm). Four wells were analyzed per treatment and dose of cold aspartate. Aspartate binding and aspartate uptake data were processed with the EBDA and LIGAND programs (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK) to produce fitted curves and to determine K m andV max values as described (47Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7772) Google Scholar). To investigate the involvement of protein kinase C (PKC) and protein kinase A (PKA) in s-hAPP effects on astroglial aspartate uptake, cultured astrocytes (see above) were exposed to GF 109203X (GFX, an inhibitor of PKC (see Ref. 48Toullec D.

GFX was first dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), and Rp and Sp in water; these reagents were then diluted 1:10 in phosphate-buffered saline and added individually (either with or without recombinant s-hAPP) to astrocyte cultures (without exchange of media) resulting in final concentrations of 1 μm (GFX) and 10 μm (Rp, Sp). The activities of PKC and PKA in astroglial cell extracts were measured with assay systems from Life Technologies, Inc. per manufacturer's instructions. In preliminary experiments, different dilutions of astroglial cell extracts were analyzed to ensure that the enzyme activities of test samples were within the linear range of the assays (data not shown). PKC activity was expressed as picomoles/min/106 cells. For PKA activity, we first determined basal and s-hAPP-induced PKA activities. cAMP was then added to each test sample to maximally stimulate PKA. Final values for basal and s-hAPP-induced PKA activities were expressed as percent of total activated PKA. Statistical analysis was performed with the StatView and Superanova programs (Abacus, Berkeley, CA). All data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Differences between means were analyzed by unpaired Student's t test, differences among means by one-way analysis of variance. When analysis of variance showed significant differences, pairwise comparisons between means were tested by Dunnett's or Tukey-Kramer post hoc tests. The null hypothesis was rejected at the 0.05 level. To determine whether hAPP influences the transport of excitatory amino acid transmitters in the central nervous system in vivo, neocortical aspartate uptake was compared in unmanipulated nontransgenic controls (n = 9) and NSE-hAPP mice expressing either hAPP751 (n = 10) or hAPP695 (n = 8) at moderate levels (22Mucke L.

Here we describe experiments designed to explain the conditional phenotype associated with this allele. We found that combining thesecY40 mutation with defects in the signal recognition particle targeting pathway led to synthetic lethality. Since the signal recognition particle is required for the insertion of inner membrane proteins (IMPs) into the cytoplasmic membrane but not for protein export, this observation prompted us to examine the effect of thesecY40 mutation on IMP biogenesis. The membrane insertion of all IMPs that we tested was impaired at both permissive and nonpermissive temperatures in secY40 cells grown in either rich or minimal medium.

Jungnickel B. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 271-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). A highly conserved, membrane-embedded heterotrimer called the SecYEG complex in bacteria and the Sec61p complex in eukaryotes (2Gorlich D. Prehn S. Hartmann E. Kalies K.U. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 489-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 3Hartmann E. Sommer T. Prehn S. Gorlich D. Jentsch S. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 1994; 367: 654-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) forms the core component of the translocation machinery or “translocon” in both systems. Genetic studies in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae have demonstrated the importance of the SecYEG-Sec61p complex for protein translocationin vivo (4Schatz P.J. Beckwith J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1990; 24: 215-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 5Deshaies R.J. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 633-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The E. coli SecYEG complex and the peripheral membrane protein SecA, which provides an ATP-driven push, are sufficient to support translocation of preproteins into proteoliposomes in vitro (6Brundage L. Hendrick J.P. Schiebel E. Driessen A.J. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 62: 649-657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Likewise, the mammalian Sec61p complex can be cross-linked to nascent secretory proteins (2Gorlich D. Prehn S. Hartmann E. Kalies K.U. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 489-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) and is sufficient to mediate translocation into lipid vesicles (7Gorlich D. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1993; 75: 615-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). A variety of studies have indicated that in addition to catalyzing protein translocation, the Sec61p-SecYEG complex facilitates the insertion of membrane proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum or IM. Genetic and biochemical studies have demonstrated that the Sec61p complex plays a central role in the insertion process in both yeast and mammals (7Gorlich D. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1993; 75: 615-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 8Stirling C.J. Rothblatt J. Hosobuchi M. Deshaies R. Schekman R. Mol. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 743-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Several studies using conditional alleles ofsecY isolated in screens for protein export mutants have suggested that the insertion of model inner membrane proteins (IMPs) is SecY-dependent (10Wolfe P.B. Rice M. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1836-1841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24523-24532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with these results, depletion of SecE was recently shown to block the insertion of the maltose transporter MalF (14Traxler B. Murphy C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12394-12400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, several other studies that also used conditional alleles of secY have suggested that the insertion of some IMPs is SecY-independent (10Wolfe P.B. Rice M. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1836-1841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12von Heijne G. Nature. 1989; 341: 456-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 15Bassilana M. Gwizdek C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5202-5208Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) or that SecY dependence is related to the length of cytoplasmic loops (16Andersson H. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 683-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Although the discrepancies in these studies may be due in part to the use of different assays for IMP insertion, they nevertheless raise the possibility that some mutant alleles may not affect the transport of all proteins equally. Protein insertion into and translocation across a phospholipid bilayer are two processes that are likely to impose very different functional requirements on the translocon. The mechanism by which the SecYEG-Sec61p complex directs both of these processes is still poorly understood. Available evidence indicates that the mammalian translocon forms an aqueous channel that permits translocation of hydrophilic polypeptides (17Gilmore R. Blobel G. Cell. 1985; 42: 497-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 18Crowley K.S. Liao S. Worrell V.E. Reinhart G.D. Johnson A.E.

Cell. 1991; 65: 371-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar) and also opens laterally to allow the exit of transmembrane regions into the lipid bilayer (20Martoglio B. Hofmann M.W. Brunner J. Dobberstein B. Cell. 1995; 81: 207-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 21Mothes W. Heinrich S.U. Graf R. Nilsson I. von Heijne G. Brunner J. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1997; 89: 523-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). One study indicated that cleavable signal peptides of secreted proteins and signal-anchor domains of transmembrane proteins are positioned differently within the eukaryotic translocon, suggesting that secreted and membrane proteins might be handled differently (22Nilsson I. Whitley P. von Heijne G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1127-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In addition, the E. coli translocon may be able to recognize the longer hydrophobic segments of signal anchors or transmembrane regions of IMPs and allow them to partition into the lipid bilayer (23Sato K. Mori H. Yoshida M. Tagaya M. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20082-20087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). A recent study suggests that during co-translational targeting, the mammalian ribosome can detect the presence of an emerging membrane-spanning domain and use this information to influence the activity of the translocon (24Liao S. Lin J. Do H. Johnson A.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 31-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Given the complexity of the tasks performed by the translocon, it is possible that the passage of secreted proteins and the insertion of integral membrane proteins are facilitated by distinct regions of the heterotrimer. Thus, some mutations may preferentially affect the transport of one of these two classes of proteins. We hypothesized that one such mutation might be the E. coli secY40 allele, which was isolated in a screen for secretion mutants (25Baba T. Jacq A. Brickman E. Beckwith J. Taura T. Ueguchi C. Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 7005-7010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Taura T. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 243: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) based on the observation that protein export defects up-regulate secAexpression (27Oliver D.B. Beckwith J. Cell. 1982; 30: 311-319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 28Riggs P.D. Derman A.I. Beckwith J. Genetics. 1988; 118: 571-579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the mutation gives rise to a moderate increase in secA synthesis and a clear cold-sensitive phenotype, no significant defects in maltose-binding protein (MBP) or OmpA export were observed even after the cells were incubated at the nonpermissive temperature for prolonged periods (25Baba T. Jacq A. Brickman E. Beckwith J. Taura T. Ueguchi C. Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 7005-7010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Taura T. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 243: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In this study, we tested the possibility that the secY40mutation selectively affects IMP insertion using a combination of genetic and biochemical experiments. We exploited the observation that secreted proteins and IMPs are targeted to the IM of E. coliby different pathways. At least some IMPs are targeted by the signal recognition particle (SRP) (29Ulbrandt N.D. Newitt J.A. Bernstein H.D. Cell. 1997; 88: 187-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 30de Gier J.W. Mansournia P. Valent Q.A. Phillips G.J. Luirink J. von Heijne G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 307-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), a ribonucleoprotein that is composed of homologs of the mammalian 54-kDa signal sequence binding protein (“Ffh”) and 7SL RNA (“4.5 S RNA”) (31Ribes V. Romisch K. Giner A. Dobberstein B. Tollervey D. Cell. 1990; 63: 591-600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 32Poritz M.A. Bernstein H.D. Strub K. Zopf D. Wilhelm H. Walter P. Science. 1990; 250: 1111-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In contrast, exported proteins are targeted by the chaperone SecB (33Kumamoto C.A. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 267-274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or by other SRP-independent mechanisms (29Ulbrandt N.D. Newitt J.A. Bernstein H.D. Cell. 1997; 88: 187-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Although SRP is essential for viability (34Phillips G.J. Silhavy T.J. Nature. 1992; 359: 744-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 35Brown S. Fournier M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 178: 533-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), we found that secY40 strains were hypersensitive to perturbations of the SRP pathway. This result suggested that the secY40 mutation exacerbates the effect of SRP mutations by having a similar effect on IMP biogenesis. Direct examination revealed that the secY40 mutation blocked IMP insertion but, as expected, had little or no effect on the export of most proteins. These results confirm that secY is required for IMP biogenesis and provide the first evidence that mutations insecY can have different effects on protein export and IMP insertion. Antisera against various proteins were obtained from 5 Prime → 3 Prime (alkaline phosphatase (AP) and β-lactamase (BLA)), New England Biolabs (MBP), Dr. Jon Beckwith (ribose binding protein (RBP) and DegP), and Dr. Stephen Pollitt (OmpA).

Newitt J.A. Bernstein H.D. Cell. 1997; 88: 187-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). For the experiments described here, a BamHI–SalI fragment of plasmid pJS310 containing the MtlA 310-AP fusion was cloned into a derivative of pLG388 (37Stoker N.G. Fairweather N.F. Spratt B.G. Gene (Amst.). 1982; 18: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The AcrB 576-AP fusion was placed under control of the lac promoter by transferring aBlpI–HindIII fragment containing the fusion into the lacI Q- containing plasmid RB11 (obtained from Carol Gross). A HindIII–BstEII fragment from plasmid pHI-1 (38Inouye H. Michaelis S. Wright A. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 146: 668-675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing the AP gene was cloned into pWJC12 (39Gross L. Chen W.J. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 488-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) to create plasmid pAP-1. To obtain plasmid pFFH (wild type), theBglI site immediately downstream of the ffhcoding sequence was first converted to a BamHI site. ASalI–BamHI fragment containing theffh gene was then cloned into the corresponding sites in pACYC184. Leucine residues 38 and 39 in Ffh were changed to alanines by PCR using the “megaprimer” technique (40Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. Biotechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar) to create the ffh cs101 mutant. Pulse-chase labeling in M9 medium was performed essentially as described (29Ulbrandt N.D. Newitt J.A. Bernstein H.D. Cell. 1997; 88: 187-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) except that 0.4% maltose was substituted for glucose in experiments in which MBP export was assayed. For experiments in rich medium, saturated cultures were diluted into fresh LB to an optical density (A 550) of 0.005. When the cultures reached anA 550 of 0.5 they were labeled for 5 min with 380 μCi/ml Tran35S-label (ICN, specific activity 1490 Ci/mmol). In temperature shift experiments, cultures were grown to anA 550 of 0.4–0.5 at 37 °C and then transferred to 23 °C for varying lengths of time prior to labeling. Samples were processed as described (29Ulbrandt N.D. Newitt J.A. Bernstein H.D. Cell. 1997; 88: 187-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), and immunoprecipitations were performed with the following modifications. Trichloroacetic acid-precipitated samples were solubilized in IP1 (5% SDS, 500 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), heated at 50 °C for 30 min and then diluted with 11.5 volumes of IP2 (2.17% Triton X-100, 163 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 5.5 mm EDTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After binding the antibody-antigen complexes to protein A-agarose, the beads were washed three times with IP3 (0.1% Triton X-100, 0.02% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 5 mm EDTA) and once with IP4 (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA). We reasoned that if the secY40 mutation inhibits the insertion of IMPs at the permissive temperature, then a second genetic change that also impairs IMP biogenesis might have a synergistic effect and lead to a synthetic lethal phenotype. Slight SRP deficiencies can be tolerated by wild-type E. coli, but a 5–8-fold decrease in the intracellular Ffh concentration becomes growth-limiting (29Ulbrandt N.D. Newitt J.A. Bernstein H.D. Cell. 1997; 88: 187-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), presumably because the biogenesis of IMPs is reduced below a critical level. Therefore, assessment of the viability of secY40 strains that have reduced SRP activity should provide an indication as to whether the mutation impedes IMP insertion. In support of this notion, we found that the secY39mutation, which has been shown to inhibit IMP insertion (16Andersson H. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 683-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), is lethal in strains carrying SRP deficiencies (data not shown). To determine whether the secY40 allele affects the viability of cells that have reduced levels of SRP, we constructed strains HDB84 (secY +) and HDB85 (secY40) in which expression of ffh is regulated by the trcpromoter. Cells were plated on LB agar containing various amounts of IPTG and incubated at 37 °C. Previous work demonstrated that the parent strain (HDB45) produces near normal levels of Ffh in the presence of 10 μm IPTG (29Ulbrandt N.D. Newitt J.A. Bernstein H.D. Cell. 1997; 88: 187-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). HDB84 grew at all IPTG concentrations between 0 and 20 μm, although noticeably smaller colonies were produced below 2 μm IPTG (Fig.1 A, diamonds). In contrast, HDB85 showed an exquisite sensitivity to the level of Ffh. Reduction in the IPTG concentration from 20 to 10 μmresulted in the production of slightly smaller colonies (Fig.1 A, circles); at 5 μm IPTG, a >50-fold decrease in plating efficiency was observed. Similar results were obtained using strains in which expression of the gene encoding 4.5 S RNA (ffs) is regulated by the trc promoter. HDB86 (secY +) grew normally at all IPTG concentrations between 50 and 100 μm (Fig. 1 B,triangles). HDB87 (secY40), however, produced progressively smaller colonies below 100 μm IPTG, and at 50 μm IPTG the plating efficiency dropped sharply (Fig.1 B, squares). These results show that even a slight decrease in SRP concentration below the wild-type level inhibits the growth of secY40 strains and indicate that, even at the permissive temperature, the secY40 mutation compounds the effect of perturbing the SRP pathway. Similar results were obtained when the secY40 mutation was combined with an Ffh Cs mutation that is likely to reduce substrate binding activity. The ffh cs101 allele contains a mutation in a highly conserved motif that does not affect protein stability (data not shown) but that has been shown to reduce the signal sequence binding activity of canine SRP54 (the mammalian SRP 54-kDa protein) (41Newitt J.A. Bernstein H.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 720-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Cells containing the mutation grow at 37 °C or above but do not grow at 30 °C. To test the ability of cells to tolerate both theffh and secY mutations, strains HDB74 (secY +) and HDB78 (secY40), in which expression of ffh is controlled by the araBADpromoter, were transformed with a plasmid bearing either the wild-typeffh gene or ffh cs101. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in the absence of arabinose to repress expression of the chromosomal ffh gene. HDB78 and HDB74 transformed with pFFH (wild type) grew equally well (Table II). HDB74 transformed with pFFH (cs101) also grew well, although slightly more slowly than cells transformed with pFFH (wild type). However, HDB78 transformed with pFFH (cs101) did not grow, indicating a synthetic lethal interaction between the secY40 and ffh cs101 alleles. Taken together with the results described above, these data suggest that a modest SRP deficiency and thesecY40 mutation cannot be combined in a single cell because their effect on IMP insertion is additive.Table IISynthetic lethal interaction between secY40 and ffh mutant allelesHDB74 (secΥ + )HDB78 (secΥ40)pFFH (WT)++++++pFFH (cs101)++− Open table in a new tab The results of the synthetic lethality test prompted us to assess the membrane insertion of several IMPs in secY40cells directly by using a protease protection assay. In this assay, protease treatment of spheroplasts releases the AP domain from IMP-AP fusion proteins that are properly inserted into the IM but not from those that are retained in the cytoplasm (42Traxler B. Lee C. Boyd D. Beckwith J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5339-5345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HDB58 (secY +) and CU165 (secY40) were transformed with plasmids encoding IMP-AP fusions, grown in M9 medium enriched with amino acids, and radiolabeled. Spheroplasted cells were treated with protease, and the released AP plus any protected fusion protein were recovered by immunoprecipitation with an anti-AP antiserum. We found that CU165 grown at the permissive temperature (37 °C) had a small but reproducible defect in the insertion of all IMPs tested. Small amounts of full-length LctP 426-AP (lactate permease fusion) were observed in CU165 pulse-labeled for 30 s (Fig.2 A, lane 3). Significant amounts of full-length LctP 426-AP and AcrB 576-AP (multidrug efflux pump fusion) also remained in the cytoplasm after a 5-min chase (Fig. 2, A and B, lane 4) and at later time points (data not shown). A larger amount of full-length fusion protein was consistently observed after the chase presumably because the synthesis of the C-terminal AP tag on many molecules was not completed within the pulse labeling period. Substantial amounts of protease-protected MalF 350-AP (maltose transporter fusion) and MtlA 310-AP (mannitol permease fusion) were observed in pulse-labeled CU165, but less of the intact fusion protein remained after a 5-min chase (Fig. 2, C and D). Thus, the insertion of these proteins may be delayed rather than completely blocked by the secY40 mutation. Insertion defects were also observed for all of these proteins in CU165 after shifting to 23 °C for 90 min, but the magnitude of the defects did not increase under these growth conditions (data not shown). Consistent with previous reports (25Baba T. Jacq A. Brickman E. Beckwith J. Taura T. Ueguchi C. Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 7005-7010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Taura T. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 243: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), we found that protein export was normal in CU165 grown in defined minimal medium. The SecB-dependent proteins MBP and OmpA, and the SecB-independent proteins RBP, BLA, and AP were immunoprecipitated from radiolabeled cells generated in the experiments described above or from cells transformed with pAP-1, a plasmid that encodes native AP. In each case, a portion of the sample that had not been treated with protease was used (see “Experimental Procedures” and Ref. 29Ulbrandt N.D. Newitt J.A. Bernstein H.D. Cell. 1997; 88: 187-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The preprotein form of each of these proteins was converted to the mature form in CU165 as rapidly as in HDB58 (Fig.3, lanes 1–4), indicating that the secY40 allele did not affect protein export. In agreement with previous reports (25Baba T. Jacq A. Brickman E. Beckwith J. Taura T. Ueguchi C. Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 7005-7010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Taura T. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 243: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), incubation at the nonpermissive temperature (23 °C) also did not reveal a secretion defect (data not shown). In contrast, the addition of sodium azide, an inhibitor of SecA function, effectively blocked protein translocation and led to substantial preprotein accumulation (Fig. 3, lane 5). Hence, under the growth conditions used in these experiments, the secY40 allele inhibits only IMP insertion. The fact that the secY40 allele was originally isolated in rich medium (25Baba T. Jacq A. Brickman E. Beckwith J. Taura T. Ueguchi C. Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 7005-7010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Taura T. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 243: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and the observation that IMP insertion defects in cells grown in minimal medium did not show a clear temperature dependence prompted us to reexamine the viability of a secY40 strain in different growth media. MC4100, HDB58, and CU165 were streaked onto LB agar, M9-glucose agar enriched with amino acids, and M9-glycerol agar and incubated at 37 or 23 °C. As expected, CU165 did not grow at 23 °C on LB agar (Fig. 4). On enriched M9-glucose agar, however, CU165 grew at 23 °C, but the colonies had an abnormal, mucoid appearance. On the poorest medium, M9-glycerol agar, CU165 grew as well as HDB58 and MC4100 and formed normal colonies at both 37 and 23 °C. These results suggest that the severity of the Cs phenotype associated with the secY40 allele correlates with the rate of cell growth. To determine whether the secY40 mutation caused a more substantial IMP insertion block at 23 °C than at 37 °C under conditions of rapid growth, we developed a pulse labeling method to analyze the fate of polypeptides synthesized by cells grown in rich medium. HDB68 and CU165 were transformed with plasmids that expressed IMP-AP fusions, grown to midlog phase in LB, and radiolabeled for 5 min. AP-containing polypeptides were recovered from untreated and protease-treated spheroplasts by immunoprecipitation as described above. At 37 °C, approximately 22% of the pulse-labeled MalF 350-AP synthesized in CU165 was not inserted into the IM (Fig.5 A, compare lanes 3and 4). Small or moderate insertion defects were also observed for other IMPs (data not shown). Shifting the incubation temperature to 23 °C, however, increased the magnitude of the insertion defect. After 48 and 114 min at low temperature, 47 and 50%, respectively, of the pulse-labeled MalF 350-AP was retained in the cytoplasm (lanes 3 and 4 in Fig. 5, Band C). In contrast, HDB58 showed no significant accumulation of MalF 350-AP at 37 °C (Fig. 5 A,lanes 1 and 2) or at 23 °C (Fig. 5,B and C, lanes 1 and 2). Thus, the secY40 mutation exerts a greater effect on IMP insertion at low temperature when cells are grown in rich medium. In contrast, the secY40 mutation had little or no effect on the export of most proteins when cells were grown in LB. Protein export was assessed by immunoprecipitating OmpA, RBP, BLA, AP, and DegP from pulse-labeled HDB58 and CU165 transformed with a plasmid expressing an IMP-AP fusion or with pAP-1. In these experiments, the rate of protein translocation in the two strains at 37 °C was comparable (Fig.6, lanes 1 and2), although the precursor form of several exported proteins could be detected in CU165 by Western blot (data not shown). Similar results were obtained at 23 °C (Fig. 6, lanes 3 and4) except that RBP export was clearly impaired (Fig. 6, RBP,lane 4). The marked effect on RBP export at low temperature was unique, however, and we cannot determine from these data whether the export block was a direct consequence of the mutation or an indirect effect of the decreased efficiency of IMP insertion. In this report, we show that the secY40 mutation selectively blocks the insertion of IMPs. Initially, we found that combining the secY40 mutation with SRP deficiencies produced a synergistic effect and reduced cell viability. The genetic data suggested that the secY40 mutation blocks the same biological process as ffh and ffs mutations. Consistent with these results, direct examination of the insertion of several individual IMPs revealed that the secY40 mutation has a broad effect on IMP biogenesis. Moderate IMP insertion defects were observed in cells grown at 37 °C in both rich and minimal media. Shifting cells grown in LB to 23 °C led to more severe IMP insertion defects. In contrast, no defects in the export of SecB-dependent proteins (which had been examined previously) or several SecB-independent proteins could be detected in cells grown in minimal medium. The export of most proteins was not notably affected by growth in rich medium either. Taken together, these results suggest that the marked cold sensitivity of secY40strains grown in rich medium is attributable to an increased impairment of IMP insertion defects at low temperature. The data presented here help to clarify two issues regarding SecY function. First, the observation that the insertion of several unrelated IMPs was blocked by the secY40 mutation supports the view that the SecYEG translocon is required for IMP biogenesis. The observation that the mutation affects the insertion of both MalF, which has a long periplasmic loop, and MtlA, which has only short periplasmic loops, also suggests that the translocon facilitates the insertion of a broader range of IMPs than has been previously proposed (16Andersson H. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 683-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Second, the finding that the secY40 mutation inhibits IMP insertion links the mutation to the protein transport function of SecY and argues against the proposal that it affects a postulated second function of SecY (25Baba T. Jacq A. Brickman E. Beckwith J. Taura T. Ueguchi C. Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 7005-7010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our data do not fully explain, however, why thesecY40 mutation was isolated in a screen for mutations that increase secA expression. One possibility is that an inhibition of IMP insertion, like a protein export block, leads to an increase in SecA synthesis. This possibility is consistent with several studies that indicate that SecA is required for the insertion of at least some IMPs (10Wolfe P.B. Rice M. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1836-1841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Traxler B. Murphy C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12394-12400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 16Andersson H. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 683-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 43Gebert J.F. Overhoff B. Manson M.D. Boos W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16652-16660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, the slight protein export defects observed in secY40 strains when cells are grown in rich medium may be sufficient to cause a moderate up-regulation of secA expression. This explanation is consistent with the observation that the secY40 mutation increases secA expression to a much smaller degree thansecY alleles that produce strong effects on protein export (26Taura T. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 243: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). An important point that arises from this study is that it cannot be assumed that translocon mutations have equal effects on the transport of all proteins. For this reason, the use of a single secallele to test the “Sec dependence” of transport of a given protein may yield misleading results. Another implication of this study is that transport defects may be sensitive to growth conditions. The observation that both the phenotype and the biochemical defects associated with the secY40 allele varied in different media demonstrates that it can be misleading to extrapolate from one growth condition to another. Slowing the growth rate of secY40cells by culturing in minimal medium may suppress the cold-sensitive phenotype by reducing the burden of polypeptides that the translocon must handle in a given time period. This notion is consistent with the observation that the secY40 Cs phenotype can be suppressed by simply overproducing a cytoplasmic protein (44Danese P.N. Murphy C.K. Silhavy T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4969-4973Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which presumably reduces the rate of synthesis of IMP proteins. Sensitivity to biosynthetic rates may be a general property of secmutations, since the growth defects of several Cs alleles ofsecY, secE, secD, and secFcan all be suppressed by overproduction of cytoplasmic proteins (44Danese P.N. Murphy C.K. Silhavy T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4969-4973Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The most intriguing implication of this study is that translocon mutations can have distinct effects on protein secretion and membrane protein insertion. Our results suggest that different regions of SecY/Sec61p may be specialized to facilitate two fundamentally distinct processes, the translocation of largely hydrophilic proteins and the membrane insertion of more hydrophobic IMPs. Although a variety of export-defective alleles of secY have been obtained based on the up-regulation of secA expression, the mutations tend to cluster in specific regions of the protein (26Taura T. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 243: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Indeed, no mutations have been isolated in some highly conserved regions that might conceivably participate in IMP insertion. For these reasons, it should be interesting to develop additional screening methods to isolate newsecY alleles that impair the transport of specific classes of proteins. Characterization of these alleles as well as further analysis of existing sec mutations should provide a great deal of insight into the mechanism by which the translocon performs a complex set of tasks.

https://openalex.org/W2089110154,"We have investigated the role of arginine residues in the regulation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, a cyclosporin A-sensitive inner membrane channel. Isolated rat liver mitochondria were treated with the arginine-specific chemical reagent 2,3-butanedione or phenylglyoxal, followed by removal of excess free reagent. After this treatment, mitochondria accumulated Ca2+ normally, but did not undergo permeability transition following depolarization, a condition that normally triggers opening of the permeability transition pore. Inhibition by 2,3-butanedione and phenylglyoxal correlated with matrix pH, suggesting that the relevant arginine(s) are exposed to the matrix aqueous phase. Inhibition by 2,3-butanedione was potentiated by borate and was reversed upon its removal, whereas inhibition by phenylglyoxal was irreversible. Treatment with 2,3-butanedione or phenylglyoxal after induction of the permeability transition by Ca2+ overload resulted in pore closure despite the presence of 0.5 mmCa2+. At concentrations that were fully effective at inhibiting the permeability transition, these arginine reagents (i) had no effect on the isomerase activity of cyclophilin D and (ii) did not affect the rate of ATP translocation and hydrolysis, as measured by the production of a membrane potential upon ATP addition in the presence of rotenone.

High matrix Ca2+ concentrations, Pi, and oxidation of intramitochondrial pyridine nucleotides promote pore opening, whereas ADP, H+, and CsA cause inhibition (1Bernardi P. Broekemeier K.M.

Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8483-8488Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), it has been suggested that the pore may be formed by the ANT (7Halestrap A.P. Davidson A.M. Biochem.

This notion has gained momentum with the findings that (i) Bax and Bcl-XL, two channel-forming proteins of the Bcl-2 superfamily localized mainly to mitochondria (11Minn A.J. Velez P. Schendel S.L.

Cell. 1997; 91: 559-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar for a review). Presently, however, further investigations into the function of the pore and its relation with apoptosis are hampered by lack of structural information on the PTP and by lack of pore-specific inhibitors. Indeed, not even CsA is selective for the PTP at the cellular level (see discussion in Refs. 1Bernardi P. Broekemeier K.M. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar and 9Bernardi P. Petronilli V. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1996; 28: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), and its inhibitory effect in isolated mitochondria is transient (18Broekemeier K.M. Pfeiffer D.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16440-16449Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar).The use of selective chemical reagents in intact mitochondria has proven of great value in characterizing functionally important amino acid residues. With this approach, we have identified (i) a dithiol that controls the pore conformation through dithiol-disulfide interconversions (19Costantini P. Chernyak B.V. Petronilli V. Bernardi P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 20Costantini P. Chernyak B.V. Petronilli V. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6746-6751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) and (ii) a matrix histidine that appears to control CyP-D binding (6Nicolli A. Basso E. Petronilli V. Wenger R.M. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2185-2192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 21Nicolli A. Petronilli V. Bernardi P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4461-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Prompted by the finding that PGO inhibits uncoupler-induced PTP opening (22Eriksson O. Fontaine E. Petronilli V. Bernardi P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 361-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), we carried out a thorough investigation on the effects of arginine-selective reagents on the permeability transition. We show that treatment of isolated rat liver mitochondria with BAD or PGO, followed by removal of excess free reagent, inhibits the permeability transition following depolarization. Remarkably, modification with PGO or BAD was sufficient to induce pore closure even at high (0.5 mm) free Ca2+concentrations, implying a mechanism of inhibition different from that of both ADP and CsA (23Novgorodov S.A. Gudz T.I. Milgrom Y.M. Brierley G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16274-16282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment with PGO or BAD at concentrations providing effective inhibition of the PTP (i) had no major effect on mitochondrial energy conservation, (ii) did not affect the enzymatic activity of CyP-D, and (iii) did not modify the rate of ATP translocation and hydrolysis. We conclude that treatment with PGO and BAD results in a stable chemical modification of critical arginine residue(s), which, in turn, strongly favors a closed state of the pore.MATERIALS AND METHODSRat liver mitochondria were prepared from male albino Wistar rats as described previously (24Bernardi P. Veronese P. Petronilli V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1005-1010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preincubation of mitochondria with PGO or BAD was carried out at room temperature for 15 min in 250 mm sucrose, 20 μm EGTA/Tris, 10 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 8.0). In some experiments, the medium was supplemented with 10 mm borate. (Preincubation with borate in the absence of arginine reagents had no effect on the permeability transition (data not shown).) The reaction was terminated by adjusting the pH to 6.8 with Hepes and by cooling to 4 °C, whereupon mitochondria were sedimented by centrifugation at 8000 ×g for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended at ∼1 mg of protein/ml in 250 mm sucrose, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm bovine serum albumin, and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). The centrifugation was repeated once, and the mitochondria were finally resuspended at ∼50 mg of protein/ml in 250 mmsucrose, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4).Unless otherwise stated, the standard assay medium contained 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Hepes/Tris (pH 7.4), 5 mm succinate, 1 mm Pi/Tris, and 2 μm rotenone. The slight inhibitory effect of PGO on uncoupled respiration has been described previously (22Eriksson O. Fontaine E. Petronilli V. Bernardi P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 361-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and BAD was found to have similar effects, although at somewhat higher concentrations (data not shown). Mitochondrial swelling, Ca2+ transport, ΔΨ, oxygen consumption, and matrix pH were measured as described previously (22Eriksson O. Fontaine E. Petronilli V. Bernardi P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 361-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 25Bernardi P. Vassanelli S. Veronese P. Colonna R. Szabo I. Zoratti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2934-2939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Peptidylprolylcis,trans-isomerase activity was measured spectrophotometrically as described (26Kofron J.L. Kuzmic P. Kishore V. Colon B.E. Rich D.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6127-6134Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), except that the assay medium was supplemented with 1% Nonidet P-40. ATP hydrolysis was measured based on the oxidation of NADH at 370 nm with a coupled enzyme assay in 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Hepes/Tris (pH 7.0), 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 1 mm NADH, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5 unit/ml pyruvate kinase, and 0.5 unit/ml lactate dehydrogenase.Chemical modification of mitochondria that had undergone permeability transition (see Fig. 3) was performed as follows. Mitochondria were suspended at 1 mg of protein/ml in 30 mm sucrose, 10 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.8), 0.5 mmCaCl2, and 10 μm arsenazo III, and the permeability transition was monitored spectrophotometrically. When the whole population had undergone permeability transition (i.e.when the absorbance had stabilized at ∼50% of its initial value, which took ∼30 min), arginine reagents were added. After 15 min of incubation, mitochondria were loaded onto a Sephadex G-100 column equilibrated with 30 mm sucrose, 10 mmHepes/Tris (pH 7.8), and 0.5 mm CaCl2; recovered in the flow-through fraction; and used immediately as shown in the experiments of Fig. 3 at a concentration of 0.3 mg/ml. Chemical modification of recombinant CyP-A with PGO was carried out in 250 mm sucrose, 20 μm EGTA, and 10 mmHepes-KOH (pH 8.0). Following modification, isomerase activity was measured at a protein concentration of 20 μg/ml.For electron microscopy, mitochondria suspended in the standard assay medium were fixed by mixing with an equal volume of 2.5% glutaraldehyde, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 3 min. Samples were post-fixed with osmium tetroxide, dehydrated, and embedded in epoxy resin. Thin sections were stained with lead citrate and uranyl acetate. CsA and human recombinant CyP-A were a kind gift of Dr. Roland Wenger (Novartis, Basel, Switzerland).

Both control and BAD- or PGO-treated mitochondria readily accumulated Ca2+ from the medium following energization (Fig.1). After completion of Ca2+uptake, ruthenium red was added to prevent efflux of Ca2+by reversal of the uniporter, and the permeability transition was induced by addition of the protonophore FCCP. Control mitochondria rapidly released Ca2+ (Fig. 1, trace a) and underwent swelling due to sucrose diffusion (electron micrographs inrow a). In the presence of CsA, both Ca2+release and swelling were inhibited (trace b and row b), indicating that the PTP is the main pathway for Ca2+ and sucrose fluxes under these conditions. In both PGO- and BAD-treated mitochondria, Ca2+ release was almost completely inhibited (traces c and d, respectively), and mitochondria remained impermeable to sucrose (rows c and d, respectively), indicating that they did not undergo a permeability transition. Neither BAD nor PGO inhibited the permeability transition when added directly to the cuvette just before mitochondria (data not shown). These data suggest that inhibition of the permeability transition was due to covalent protein modification.Figure 1Inhibition of the PTP by BAD and PGO.Control mitochondria (traces a and b) and mitochondria pretreated with 2 mm PGO (trace c) or BAD (trace d) were suspended at 0.3 mg/ml in 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Hepes/Tris (pH 7.4), 1 mm Pi, 20 μm Ca2+, 15 μm arsenazo III, and 2 μm rotenone. Light absorption was measured at the wavelength couple 665/685 nm. Where indicated, 5 mm succinate (succ), 0.1 μm ruthenium red followed by 1.0 μm FCCP (RR+FCCP), and 1 μm A23187 (A 23 ) were added. In trace b, 1 μm CsA was present. Electron micrographs (rows a–d) show the mitochondrial ultrastructure prior to addition of succinate (0 min) and after addition of ruthenium red and FCCP (15 min) under the conditions of traces a–d, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To approach the problem of specificity, we investigated if the modification had the characteristic features of the arginine-carbonyl addition reaction. Fig. 2 shows that the inhibitory effect of BAD on the rate of Ca2+ efflux was potentiated by borate. In the presence of 10 mm borate, half-maximal inhibition of the permeability transition was observed at 0.2 mm BAD (closed circles), whereas in the absence of borate, it increased to 1 mm BAD (open circles), consistent with the stabilizing effect of borate ions on the reaction product of BAD and arginine residues in proteins (27Riordan J.F. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 3915-3923Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). To assess whether inhibition was reversible, we incubated BAD- and PGO-treated mitochondria at room temperature for up to 3 h after removing excess reagent and before inducing the permeability transition (Fig. 2). In PGO-treated mitochondria, the rate of Ca2+release was essentially stable with time (inset, open triangles), whereas BAD-treated mitochondria released Ca2+ faster at increasing incubation times (inset, closed circles), indicating a recovery of the activity of the permeability transition distinguishable from the smaller increase observed in untreated mitochondria (inset,closed squares).Figure 2Concentration dependence and reversibility of BAD-induced inhibition of the PTP: effect of borate. Experimental conditions were as described in the legend to Fig. 1. The rate of Ca2+ efflux after FCCP addition was normalized by taking the efflux rate of control mitochondria in the absence of CsA as 100% and the efflux rate in the presence of 1 μm CsA as 0. Mitochondria were preincubated in the absence (open circles) or presence (closed circles) of 10 mm borate.Inset, control mitochondria (closed squares) or mitochondria treated with 1 mm PGO (open triangles) or BAD (closed circles) were incubated at room temperature in 250 mm sucrose, 10 mmHepes/Tris (pH 7.4), and 2 μm rotenone for the times indicated, followed by experiments similar to those shown in Fig.1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To rule out an effect on other protein(s) that indirectly exert control over the permeability transition by modulating mitochondrial ion or metabolite concentrations or ΔΨ, we studied the effects of PGO and BAD in mitochondria that had already undergone permeability transition,i.e. after they had lost their content of ions and small molecules. Under these conditions, any effect of arginine reagents on the permeability transition is likely to reflect a change in the conformation of the pore (28Gunter T.E. Pfeiffer D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C755-C786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Respiring mitochondria suspended in a hypotonic sucrose-based medium were incubated in the presence of 0.5 mm Ca2+ to induce the permeability transition, and then aliquots were either (i) treated with PGO or BAD, followed by removal of excess reagent by gel filtration, or (ii) untreated and subjected to the same gel filtration protocol (see “Materials and Methods” for details). Fig. 3 shows that addition of 4% polyethylene glycol 8000 to untreated mitochondria resulted in a rapid increase in light scattering, due to shrinkage of mitochondria following sucrose diffusion through the open pore(s) (trace a) (see also Ref. 29Pfeiffer D.R. Gudz T.I. Novgorodov S.A. Erdahl W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4923-4932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). When Ca2+ was chelated by 2 mm EGTA prior to the addition of polyethylene glycol, only a small change in light scattering followed the addition of polyethylene glycol 8000 to control mitochondria, showing that removal of Ca2+ caused pore closure (trace b). Remarkably, PGO- and BAD-treated mitochondria underwent only a small shrinkage upon addition of polyethylene glycol, suggesting that the PTP had been locked in the closed conformation despite the presence of 0.5 mm Ca2+ (trace c). It should be noted that both PGO and BAD inhibited the pore to a comparable degree compared with the combination of CsA and ADP (trace d), whereas neither CsA nor ADP alone was able to inhibit the pore under these conditions (data not shown). These results indicate that the PGO- and BAD-reactive arginine(s) are directly involved in the PTP open-closed transitions, which under these conditions are independent of ΔΨ or of any regulatory compounds like ADP, Mg2+, or pyridine nucleotides. To our knowledge, the arginine modification described here is the only condition identified so far that allows pore closure at high Ca2+ concentrations in the absence of ADP.We next addressed the question of whether the relevant arginine(s) are localized on the external side or on the matrix side of the inner membrane. At millimolar concentrations, both PGO and BAD partition about equally in water/hexane (data not shown), suggesting that their matrix and medium concentrations were the same. Furthermore, passive swelling experiments showed that borate equilibrated rapidly (within seconds) across the inner membrane (data not shown). Thus, the distribution of the reagents provided no clue regarding the membrane topology of the reactive arginine(s). Therefore, we studied whether the modification was pH-dependent and whether it correlated with the pH of the mitochondrial matrix or of the incubation medium. To modulate matrix and medium pH independently, we incubated de-energized mitochondria in isotonic sucrose or KCl medium and performed chemical arginine modification at external pH values ranging between 7.4 and 8.4. 2Mitochondria lose a fraction of matrix K+ during isolation in a low K+ medium due to the activity of the constitutive K+/H+antiporter (30Garlid K.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). As a result, matrix pH of nonenergized mitochondria in sucrose medium is ∼0.7–1.0 unit lower than external pH (e.g. Ref. 21Nicolli A. Petronilli V. Bernardi P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4461-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), whereas in KCl medium, matrix and external pH coincide, as revealed by direct measurements with 2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (data not shown). Fig.4 shows that modification with BAD (or PGO (data not shown and Ref. 22Eriksson O. Fontaine E. Petronilli V. Bernardi P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 361-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar)) was more efficient at alkaline pH. However, the PTP was more effectively inhibited when mitochondria were modified in KCl than in sucrose medium at all values of external pH (Fig. 4 A). Nevertheless, when the data were replotted as a function of matrix pH measured with 2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein, a direct correlation was obtained between the pH and the degree of PTP inhibition (Fig.4 B). These results demonstrate that chemical modification with BAD and PGO is pH-dependent, support the possibility that protonation of the guanidino group is at equilibrium matrix pH, and thus suggest that the relevant arginines face the matrix.Figure 4pH dependence of the effects of BAD on the permeability transition in sucrose and KCl media. Chemical modification was carried out in sucrose medium (circles) or in KCl medium (squares) at pH 7.4, 8.0, and 8.4 as described under “Materials and Methods” using 1 mm BAD in all experiments. After removal of excess BAD, experiments were carried out exactly as described in the legend to Fig. 1. The initial rate of Ca2+ efflux after addition of FCCP is plotted as a function of extramitochondrial (A) and intramitochondrial (B) pH during chemical modification. The rate was normalized by taking the efflux rate of control mitochondria (treated identically, but with BAD omitted) as 100%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)CsA is thought to inhibit the permeability transition by binding to the active site of matrix CyP-D, a peptidylprolylcis,trans-isomerase, thereby releasing it from the putative binding sites on the pore (5Connern C.P.

Chem. 1996; 271: 2185-2192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Fig.5 shows that the total peptidylprolylcis,trans-isomerase activity of mitochondria (largely due to CyP-D) was unaffected by treatment with 2 mm BAD or PGO (i.e. a concentration causing >90% inhibition of the permeability transition) and that CyP-A was only 10% inhibited at 10 mm PGO (inset). On the other hand, the peptidylprolylcis,trans-isomerase activity was fully inhibited by CsA in control mitochondria as well as in BAD- or PGO-treated mitochondria. These data demonstrate that the mechanism by which BAD and PGO inhibit the permeability transition is not related to inhibition of CyP-D.Figure 5Effect of PGO and BAD on mitochondrial peptidylprolyl cis,trans-isomerase activity. The peptidylprolylcis,trans-isomerase activity of a mitochondrial extract was assessed using a 50 μm concentration of the peptide N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide in 50 mm Hepes/NaOH (pH 8.0) and 1% Nonidet P-40. Cleavage of the trans-isomer of the peptide by α-chymotrypsin was monitored at 410 nm and is expressed as percent of the final absorbance, i.e. when all of the test peptide had been hydrolyzed.

Inset, human recombinant CyP-A was incubated with PGO as described under “Materials and Methods.” The rate of isomerization was normalized by taking the t½ for catalysis of the test peptide by untreated CyP-A as 100% and that by CyP-A treated with 1 μm CsA as 0.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Several lines of evidence suggest that the PTP and the ANT may be functionally linked or even structurally identical (7Halestrap A.P.

ATP/ADP exchange across the inner membrane was measured as the rate of ATP hydrolysis by intact de-energized mitochondria. Fig.6 shows that the rate of atractyloside-sensitive ATP hydrolysis was essentially unaffected by concentrations of BAD and PGO relevant for pore inhibition. Furthermore, treatment with 1 mm PGO or BAD (i.e. a concentration that caused >90% inhibition of the PTP) only marginally affected the development of the ΔΨ produced by ATP hydrolysis in the presence of rotenone (Fig.7). Thus, full inhibition of the PTP by arginine reagents occurred under conditions where the activity of the ANT and of the F1F0-ATPase remained largely unaffected.Figure 6Atractyloside-sensitive ATP hydrolysis by de-energized mitochondria: effect of PGO and BAD.

Oxidation of NADH was measured at 370 nm.

Mediation of these binding interactions by iron and iron-containing compounds regulates several post-transcriptional events relevant to iron metabolism. There are two known IRPs, IRP1 and IRP2, both of which can respond to iron fluxes in the cell. There is ample evidence that IRP1 is converted by iron to cytoplasmic aconitase in vivo. It has also been shown that, under certain conditions, a significant fraction of IRP1 is degraded in cells exposed to iron or heme. Studies have shown that the degradation of IRP1 that is induced by iron can be inhibited by either desferrioxamine mesylate (an iron chelator) or succinyl acetone (an inhibitor of heme synthesis), whereas the degradation induced by heme cannot. This suggests that heme rather than iron is responsible for this degradation.Several laboratories have shown that IRP2 is also degraded in cells treated with iron salts. We now show evidence suggesting that this IRP2 degradation may be mediated by heme. Thus, in experiments analogous to those used previously to study IRP1, we find that IRP2 is degraded in rabbit fibroblast cells exposed to heme or iron salts. However, as shown earlier with IRP1, both desferrioxamine mesylate and succinyl acetone will inhibit the degradation of IRP2 induced by iron but not that induced by heme.

Several genes that are required for iron homeostasis are regulated via post-transcriptional events. One of the best understood examples is the regulation of ferritin synthesis. Near the 5′-cap of the ferritin mRNA is an iron-responsive element (IRE), 1The abbreviations used are: IRE, iron-responsive element; Desferal, desferrioxamine mesylate; FAC, ferric ammonium citrate; IRP, iron-regulatory protein; SA, succinyl acetone. which acts as a docking site for a member of a family of proteins known as iron-regulatory proteins (IRPs). There are two related IRPs, IRP1 and IRP2, both of which recognize wild-type IREs with nearly equivalent binding affinity (1Henderson B.R. Seiser C. Kuhn L.C. J. Biol.

However, the two IRPs have overlapping but distinct preferences for a variety of IRE variants generated in vitro (6Henderson B.R. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 7Butt J. Kim H.-Y. Basilion J.P. Cohen S. Iwai K. Philpott C.C. Altschul S. Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Although these variant IREs have not been found naturally, such studies reveal subtle differences in how each IRP recognizes the natural IRE. Regulation of IRE-IRP interactions in vivo is crucial to the expression of several gene products. Incubation of cells with iron or heme leads to dissociation of the IRP from the IRE. This dissociation leads to increased translation of genes that contain an IRE in their 5′-untranslated region. Examples of mRNAs that are regulated by this mechanism are ferritin (8Mascotti D.P.

A primary response to cellular iron influx is conversion of apo-IRP1 to a holo-protein that contains a 4Fe-4S iron-sulfur cluster. This iron loaded IRP1 has a reduced affinity for IREs, and concomitantly gains aconitase activity (8Mascotti D.P. Rup D. Thach R.E. Annu. Rev.

However it has been shown that, under some conditions, IRP1 can be degraded when iron enters the cell (25Goessling L.S. Daniels-McQueen S. Bhattacharyya-Pakrasi M. Lin J.-J. Thach R.E.

The degradation of IRP1 induced by iron in vivo is stimulated by δ-aminolevulinic acid (a heme precursor) and inhibited by both succinyl acetone (SA; an inhibitor of heme synthesis) and desferrioxamine mesylate (Desferal; an iron chelator). By contrast heme-induced degradation of IRP1 is not affected by these agents. This suggests that heme rather than free iron is the causative agent of the degradation (25Goessling L.S.

The mechanism for heme-induced IRP1 breakdown is not known; however, some evidence suggests that a high molecular weight intermediate may be involved (25Goessling L.S. Daniels-McQueen S.

We were interested to know if heme, rather than free iron, may be responsible for this degradation as it appears to be for IRP1. In order to determine this, we studied the breakdown of IRP2 using experiments similar to those used to analyze IRP1. A normal rabbit skin fibroblast line, RAB-9, was used for all experiments reported. These cells were seeded at low density in Earle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum and nonessential amino acids (alanine, aspartate, glutamate, glycine, proline, and serine, all at 0.1 mm), and 1 mm sodium pyruvate. Cells were allowed to grow for 2 days by which time they had reached from two-thirds to three-fourths confluency. On the day of each experiment, additions were made to the spent growth medium unless otherwise stated. At the end of the incubations, cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and were lysed by the addition of band shift lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 40 mm KCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 7 mm2-mercaptoethanol). After lysis in bandshift buffer, equal quantities of protein were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then transferred by electroblotting for 20–24 h at 100 mA onto nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell, Protran BA83) membranes. IRP2 was then detected using anti-IRP2 primary antibody (provided by Dr. E. Leibold, Salt Lake City, UT) and alkaline phosphatase conjugated to goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (36Blake M.S. Johnston K.H. Russell-Jones G.J. Gotschlich E.C. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 136: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1631) Google Scholar). IRP1 was detected using anti-IRP1 primary antibody and alkaline phosphatase conjugated to goat anti-rat IgG secondary antibody. Stained bands were quantitated by densitometry. Most experiments were performed in duplicate or triplicate, and the results were averaged. Reproducibility of results was high. For example, the effect of iron on IRP2 was quantitated in 12 different individual reactions; the average reduction in IRP2 relative to the same number of untreated control reactions was 72%. The average deviation was ±6.3% of the untreated control value. The comparable values (reported in parenthesis) for other important experiments were: the reduction of IRP2 in the presence of Desferal plus iron (done 4 times, ±8.5% deviation); the reduction of IRP2 in the presence of SA plus iron (done 8 times, ±13%); the reduction of IRP2 in the presence of heme (done 13 times, ±8.5%); the reduction of IRP2 in the presence of SA plus 20 μm heme (done 5 times, ±7.9%). To test the ability to distinguish IRP1 from IRP2, Western analysis was performed on untreated RAB-9 lysates. The nitrocellulose membranes bearing transferred proteins were probed with antibodies specific for IRP1 and IRP2. Fig. 1 shows that antibodies raised against IRP2 do not cross-react with IRP1, andvice versa. The mobility of IRP2 in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis is slightly slower than that of IRP1, in accordance with its higher molecular weight. In all cases, IRP1 is more abundant than IRP2 in RAB-9 cells, although IRP2 was still readily detectable. We next wanted to corroborate findings that IRP2 is degraded in cells exposed to iron salts. RAB-9 cells were incubated with control medium or medium containing 100 μm ferric ammonium citrate (FAC) for 3.5 h and then lysed (see “Experimental Procedures”). Results of this experiment are shown in Fig.2 A. Lane 2 shows that significantly less IRP2 is present in cells exposed to 100 μm FAC than in cells grown in control medium (lane 1). These results agree quite well with data shown by Samaniegoet al. (4Samaniego F. Chin J. Iwai K. Rouault T.A. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30904-30910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the effect of limiting porphyrin synthesis, cells were also treated with both FAC and 7.5 mm SA (Fig. 2 A,lane 3). Simultaneous incubation of SA with FAC reduces the extent of IRP2 degradation attributable to iron. Administration of 40 μm heme to RAB-9 cells also induces the degradation of IRP2, as shown in Fig. 2 A, lane 4. Addition of Desferal after 30 min of heme treatment does not inhibit this degradation (Fig. 2 B, lane 6). Quantitation of the effects of iron, heme, SA, and Desferal is shown is Table I. In Experiment 1, nearly 80% of IRP2 is degraded in the presence of iron. This effect is largely prevented by the addition of Desferal 30 min after iron addition. By contrast, the degradation induced by heme is not prevented by Desferal. In Experiment 2, the effect of SA in inhibiting the iron-induced degradation of IRP2 is seen; it is quantitatively similar to that of Desferal. A lower concentration of heme than that used in Experiment 1 produces less IRP2 degradation; however, SA has a slight effect on the heme-induced degradation of IRP2 in this experiment. We speculated that this might be due to a small amount of iron that was released from heme by the action of heme oxygenase. To test this possibility, cells were pretreated with Desferal before heme addition. The results are shown in Experiment 3: as anticipated, the influence of SA on the heme-induced degradation is negligible in the presence of Desferal. Moreover, comparison of the results in Experiments 2 and 3 show that even pretreatment of cells with Desferal does not mitigate the degradation induced by heme.Table ISuccinyl acetone and Desferal inhibit the effect of iron but not heme on IRP2AdditionsRelative residual IRP21st incubation2nd incubation% controlExperiment 1aRAB-9 cells were pretreated for 30 min with 100 μm FAC or 30 μm heme (1st incubation).

Open table in a new tab The above data show that the degradation of IRP2 caused by heme addition is not inhibited by Desferal. This suggests that heme is not merely serving as a source of free iron. By contrast, the degradation caused by FAC is inhibited by both SA and Desferal. Together, these results suggest that iron must first be incorporated into heme (or some other compound in the porphyrin biosynthetic pathway) before it can influence IRP2 stability. The results shown here confirm reports by others (4Samaniego F. Chin J. Iwai K. Rouault T.A. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30904-30910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Guo B.

The data presented also suggest that iron must be converted to heme, or a heme-like compound, before it can trigger IRP2 degradation. Previous studies on IRP1 degradation by iron or heme showed similar results (25Goessling L.S. Daniels-McQueen S. Bhattacharyya-Pakrasi M. Lin J.-J. Thach R.E. Science. 1992; 256: 670-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar,26Goessling L.S. Mascotti D.P. Bhattacharyya-Pakrasi M. Gang H. Thach R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4343-4348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We also find that the rate and extent of IRP2 degradation are significantly greater than for IRP1 (indeed, under certain conditions, no degradation of IRP1 was seen (26Goessling L.S. Mascotti D.P. Bhattacharyya-Pakrasi M. Gang H. Thach R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4343-4348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). These results are consistent with findings of others that a 73-amino acid insert present in IRP2 protein relative to IRP1 is responsible for the high rate of IRP2 degradation (31Iwai K. Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5350-5357Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Another interesting difference between IRP1 and IRP2 is that the latter appears unable to form an iron-sulfur cluster (32Phillips J.D. Guo B. Yu Y. Brown F.M. Leibold E.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15704-15714Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). One interesting possibility is that the absence of a cluster in IRP2 (caused by the presence of the 73-amino acid insert?) might facilitate its rapid degradation. If this were true, then it might offer an explanation for why IRP1 degradation is so variable; perhaps only IRP1 that lacks an iron-sulfur cluster is degraded by heme. However, before this notion can be seriously pursued, more information about the roles of cysteine residues within the 73-amino acid insert is required. It should also be noted that the phosphorylation state of IRP1 might play a role in determining whether it will be degraded. It is still not certain which of the two major iron-dependent pathways (iron-sulfur cluster formation or protein degradation) is primarily responsible for derepression of ferritin mRNA translation. It seems likely that both are involved, and that the relative importance of each may be determined by variables such as cell type (33Coccia E.M. Stellacci E. Perrotti E. Marziali G. Battistini A. J. Biol. Regul. Homeost. Agents. 1994; 8: 81-87PubMed Google Scholar) and cell physiological state (25Goessling L.S. Daniels-McQueen S. Bhattacharyya-Pakrasi M. Lin J.-J. Thach R.E. Science. 1992; 256: 670-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 26Goessling L.S. Mascotti D.P. Bhattacharyya-Pakrasi M. Gang H. Thach R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4343-4348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the fact that the re-repression after iron treatment requires new protein synthesis is consistent with the degradation pathway being operational in the cells employed (26Goessling L.S. Mascotti D.P. Bhattacharyya-Pakrasi M. Gang H. Thach R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4343-4348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, it is not yet clear which protein, IRP1 or IRP2, is primarily responsible for repression. Again, both may play roles that depend upon cell type and physiological circumstances. Alternatively, or in addition, the two IRP forms may recognize different versions of the IRE in vivo (32Phillips J.D. Guo B. Yu Y. Brown F.M. Leibold E.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15704-15714Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). If IRP2 cannot form an iron-sulfur cluster then it is presumably not a target for nitric oxide regulation (34Drapier J. Hirling H. Wietzerbin J. Kaldy P. Kuhn L.C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3643-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 35Weiss G. Goossen B. Doppler W. Fuchs D. Pantopoulos K. Werner-Felmayer G. Wachter H. Hentze M.W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3651-3657Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). This would constitute an important functional distinction between the two forms of IRP. We are grateful to Dr. Elizabeth Leibold for generously providing antibodies against IRP2 and for helpful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2073225903,"Many cytokine receptors employ Janus protein tyrosine kinases (Jaks) and signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stats) for nuclear signaling. Here, we have established yeast strains in which an autoactivated Jak2 kinase induces tyrosine phosphorylation, dimerization, nuclear translocation, and DNA binding of a concomitantly expressed Stat5 protein. Transcriptional activity of Stat5 on a stably integrated, Stat-dependent reporter gene required the C-terminal fusion of the VP16 transactivation domain. In such yeast strains, the interaction between Jak2 and Stat5 was analyzed without interference by other mammalian proteins involved in regulating Jak-Stat signaling, and mutant versions of both proteins were analyzed for their ability to productively interact. Complexes between Jak2 and Stat5 were found to be stable under stringent co-immunoprecipitation conditions. Deletion of the Jak homology regions 2–7 (JH2–JH7) of Jak2, leaving only the kinase domain (JH1) intact, reduced the ability of the kinase to phosphorylate Stat5, whereas deletion of the JH2 domain caused an increased enzymatic activity. A site-directed R618K mutation in the Stat5 SH2 domain abolished the phosphorylation by Jak2, while deletion of the C terminus led to Stat5 hyperphosphorylation. A single phosphotyrosine-SH2 domain interaction was sufficient for the dimerization of Stat5, but such dimers bound to DNA very inefficiently. Together, our data show that yeast cells are appropriate tools for studying Jak-Stat or Stat-Stat interactions. Our mutational analysis suggests that the Stat5 SH2 domain is essential for the interaction with Jak2 and that the kinase domain of Jak2 is sufficient for Jak2-Stat5 interaction.

Therefore, the Jak kinase domain may be all that is needed to cause Stat phosphorylation in situations where receptor docking is dispensable. The biological activity of cytokines generally requires changes in the pattern of gene expression. Signal transduction to the cell nucleus is therefore an essential component in a cytokine response. Many cytokine receptors contain amino acid motifs mediating constitutive binding with Jak protein tyrosine kinases (Jaks 1The abbreviations used are: Jak, Janus kinase; mJak, murine Jak; JH, Jak homology region; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; GAS, γ-interferon activated site; SH2, Src homology region 2; Stat, signal transducer and activator of transcription; mStat, murine Stat; PCR, polymerase chain reaction.; Refs. 1Ihle J.N.

Biochem. 1997; 248: 615-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). After ligand-receptor interaction receptor chains cluster, and this most likely enables Jaks on neighboring chains to cross-phosphorylate and activate each other. Important substrates of activated Jaks are the signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat) proteins (2Pellegrini S. Dusanter-Fourt I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 615-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 3Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R.

Stark G.R. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1578-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). A distinctive feature of these transcription factors is the presence of an SH2 domain. The Stat SH2 domain can be instrumental in binding phosphotyrosines on ligand-activated receptors. Receptor-associated Stats are then phosphorylated by Jaks on a single tyrosine residue. In the context of the interferon-γ receptor, the β-chain-associated Jak2 kinase could be exchanged for another Jak kinase without consequences for Stat activation or biological activity (6Kotenko S.V. Izotova L.S. Pollack B.P. Muthukumaran G. Paukku K. Silvennoinen O. Ihle J.N. Pestka S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17174-17182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Similarly, an erythropoietin receptor box 2 motif conferred Jak2 binding upon an interleukin-2 receptor β-chain, and Jak2 was able to substitute for Jak1 in a mitogenic response to interleukin-2 (7Jiang N. He T.C. Miyajima A. Wojchowski D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16472-16476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These results suggested that Jaks contribute little specificity to postreceptor events and that the signal selection is made by the receptor chains. On the other hand, a comparison between Jak1 and Jak3 showed an inherently better ability of Jak1 to phosphorylate Stat5 (8Liu K.D. Gaffen S.L. Goldsmith M.A. Greene W.C. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 817-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The question thus remains whether and in which situations Jak kinases help to specify the signal transducers employed by cytokine receptors. Tyrosine-phosphorylated Stats form dimers, and phosphotyrosine-SH2 interactions are essential for dimerization to occur. It appears that both partners in Stat dimers isolated from cytokine-treated cells are phosphorylated and thus held together by two phosphotyrosine-SH2 contacts (9Shuai K. Horvath C.M. Huang L.H. Qureshi S.A. Cowburn D. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1994; 76: 821-828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether reciprocal phosphotyrosine binding is a necessity for dimerization and DNA binding or whether a single contact would suffice (10Gupta S. Yan H. Wong L.H. Ralph S. Krolewski J. Schindler C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1075-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In vitrostudies suggested that the increased affinity generated by two phosphotyrosine-SH2 domain bonds is the driving force behind dissociation of the Stat-receptor complex, held together by a single phosphotyrosine-SH2 domain bond with a high intrinsic affinity (11Greenlund A.C. Morales M.O. Viviano B.L. Yan H. Krolewski J. Schreiber R.D. Immunity. 1995; 2: 677-687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). It is therefore conceivable that a Stat activation mechanism independent of receptor docking may result in the formation of dimers held by a single SH2-phosphotyrosine interaction. The receptor docking model for Stats has been tested for many different cytokine receptors by mutating relevant tyrosines in the intracellular domain. These analyses produced diverging results concerning the role of phosphotyrosines in the sequence of reactions leading to Stat phosphorylation. Depending on the receptor studied, and sometimes even on the experimental system used to analyze receptor activity, Stat docking sites were either found to be an absolute requirement, necessary to increase the potential to phosphorylate Stats, or of no importance at all (12Greenlund A.C.

Biochem. 1998; 251: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The observation of Stat activation independent of receptor binding fueled the search for alternative ways by which cytokine receptors cause Stat phosphorylation. Jaks are characterized by seven distinct homology regions (JH1–JH7, reviewed in Refs. 2Pellegrini S. Dusanter-Fourt I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 615-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar and 25Zimiecki A. Harpur A.G. Wilks A.F. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 207-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The JH1 region encompasses the kinase domain; the JH2 region encompasses the kinase-like, or pseudokinase, domain; and JH3–7 provides specificity of receptor binding and most likely contacts to other proteins. In principle, Stat phosphorylation independent of receptor docking might require adapter proteins associating with JH regions and thus facilitating the contact with Jaks. Evidence for the existence of such adapters was recently obtained (26Collum R.G. Schindler C. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 1996; 7: 518Google Scholar). Alternatively, certain combinations of Jaks and Stats might not require any third party help at all for interaction between Stats and JH regions. This was recently proposed by Fujitani et al.(27Fujitani Y. Hibi M. Fukada T. Takahashi-Tezuka M. Yoshida H. Yamaguchi T. Sugiyama K. Yamanaka Y. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 751-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). A yeast two-hybrid approach with baits from different Jak kinases suggested a specific interaction of the pseudokinase (JH2) domain with the two Stat5 isoforms, Stat5a and Stat5b. This result linked the JH2 domain with Stat association and at the same time provided a possible explanation for Stat5 activation independent of receptor docking. Further insight concerning the role of the JH2 domain stems from reconstitution experiments in cell lines devoid of certain Jaks or from a naturally occurring gain of function mutation in theDrosophila Jak homologue Hopscotch (28Luo H. Rose P. Barber D. Hanratty W.P. Lee S. Roberts T.M. D'Andrea A.D. Dearolf C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1562-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Deletion of the JH2 domain in the Jak family kinase Tyk2 causes a loss of enzymatic activity (29Velazquez L. Mogensen K.E. Barbieri G. Fellous M. Uze G. Pellegrini S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3327-3334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and the same was found for Hopscotch (28Luo H. Rose P. Barber D. Hanratty W.P. Lee S. Roberts T.M. D'Andrea A.D. Dearolf C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1562-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Partial deletion of JH2 in Jak2 did not abolish its ability to autophosphorylate while decreasing the functionality of Jak2 in interferon-γ signal transduction (30Kohlhuber F. Rogers N.C. Watling D. Feng J. Guschin D. Briscoe J. Witthuhn B.A. Kotenko S.V. Pestka S. Stark G.R. Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 695-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the Hopscotch mutation (E695K) in the JH2 domain resulted in a hyperactive kinase, and introduction of the corresponding mutation into the mammalian Jak2 corroborated this result (28Luo H. Rose P. Barber D. Hanratty W.P. Lee S. Roberts T.M. D'Andrea A.D. Dearolf C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1562-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that the JH2 domain is necessary for enzymatic activity at least in some Jaks but that it may also serve to down-regulate and control kinase activity. Consistently, Sakai and Kraft (31Sakai I. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12350-12358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) reported constitutive Jak2 activity upon deletion of either the JH2 domain or the JH2–JH7 domains in the context of a CD16/Jak2 fusion protein. The constitutively active Jak2 could recapitulate certain aspects of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor signaling, thus suggesting an intrinsic signaling specificity of the Jak2 kinase domain. In further support of an autonomous function of the Jak2 kinase domain, Berchtold et al. (32Berchtold S. Moriggl R. Gouilleux F. Silvennoinen O. Beisenherz C. Pfitzner E. Wissler M. Stocklin E. Groner B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30237-30243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) demonstrated that a Stat5/Jak2 (JH1) fusion protein expressed intrinsic kinase activity and was able to phosphorylate itself as well as cellular Stat1 and Stat5 in living cells. In mammalian cells, association with receptors usually restricts the movement of Jaks and inhibits ligand-independent kinase activity. When Jaks are overexpressed, they form a pool of cytoplasmic proteins, which are capable of ligand-independent interaction and thus autoactivation (33Yamamoto K. Quelle F.W. Thierfelder W.E.

Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 833-840PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we have exploited this feature and report the establishment of yeast cells as tools to study the interaction between activated Jak2 and Stat5 as well as Stat5 dimerization. The advantage of this approach lies in the absence of an endogenous Jak-Stat signaling path in yeast, which allows us to interpret results without having to consider possible interference by receptors and/or adapter proteins. Moreover, interactions are studied in a situation of moderate overexpression of reactants, thus minimizing interactions forced by unphysiologically high concentrations. Under these conditions, we find that the JH2 domain is not necessary to bind and phosphorylate Stat5. Rather, our results point toward a negative regulatory function of this domain. Moreover, we show that a functional Stat5 SH2 domain is of critical importance for Jak2 interaction and that reciprocal SH2 domain-phosphotyrosine interactions are essential for the generation of Stat5 dimer efficiently binding to DNA. Yeast cells (Genotype: MATa, ade2–1, trp1–1, can 1–100, leu 2–3, 112, his 3–11, 15, ura3, GAL, psi+ W303–1B) were grown in minimal medium containing 6.7 g/liter yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, supplemented with necessary amino acids, 2% raffinose and/or galactose. Briefly, yeast cells were allowed to grow in 50 ml of minimal medium to an OD up to 1.0 (approximately 1 × 107 cells/ml). In order to induce the Gal1/10 promoter, cells were grown first in minimal medium containing 2% D(+) raffinose and shifted at an OD of 0.7 to a medium containing 2% D(+) galactose for 4 h. For extraction, yeast cells (1 × 107 cells/ml) were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in buffer C (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol). Approximately 13 volume of ice-cold glass beads were added, and cells were broken by thoroughly vortexing five or six times for 1 min. Between vortexing, the tubes were put on ice for 2 min. After vortexing the last time, the tubes were placed on ice for 30 min. Lysed cells were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was carefully transferred to a new Eppendorf tube. The simian kidney fibroblast cell line COS-N31, stably transfected with the interferon-γ receptor α-chain (kindly provided by Silvio Hemmi, University of Zürich; Ref. 36Hemmi S. Bohni R. Stark G. Di Marco F. Aguet M. Cell. 1994; 76: 803-810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), was grown in RPMI medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Methods for generating nuclear extracts for EMSA and IP/Western blot analysis have been described elsewhere (37Eilers A. Baccarini M. Horn F. Hipskind R.A. Schindler C. Decker T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1364-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding murine Stat5a was described previously (38Liu X. Robinson G.W. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Hennighausen L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8831-8835Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Plasmids pfl80, containing the murine Stat5b gene and pFB5bT, encoding the murine Stat5b gene, truncated at the NsiI site were kindly provided by C. Schindler (Columbia University, New York; Ref. 39Azam M. Erdjument Bromage H. Kreider B.L. Xia M. Quelle F. Basu R. Saris C. Tempst P. Ihle J.N. Schindler C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1402-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The above mentioned cDNAs were cloned into the pBluescript-SK or -KS plasmids (Stratagene). The C-terminally truncated Stat5a gene was generated by PCR mutagenesis, introducing a stop codon immediately downstream of the endogenousNsiI site. A myc tag (with three repeats of threemyc epitopes) was inserted into a NheI site, which was generated by PCR mutagenesis immediately downstream of the start codon of both Stat5 genes. The same PCR mutagenesis allowed the generation of an EcoRI site immediately upstream of the start codon for subsequent cloning purposes. The critical tyrosine in Stat5a (Tyr694) and Stat5b (Tyr699) was mutated to phenylalanine by PCR mutagenesis. The mutation arginine 618 to lysine in Stat5a was generated by altering codon 618 from CGC to AAG by PCR mutagenesis. A VP16 fragment encoding the transactivating domain with NsiI–SpeI sites at the respective ends was generated by PCR amplification from MGFΔC-VP16 (40Moriggl R. Berchtold S. Friedrich K. Standke G.J. Kammer W. Heim M. Wissler M. Stocklin E. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3663-3678Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The C terminus of Stat5 starting from the NsiI site was replaced with this fragment. All mutations generated by PCR were verified by sequencing analysis. Wild-type or mutated Stat5 genes could thereafter be subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) by using the EcoRI and NotI restriction sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. Plasmid pK2082 containing the Gal1/10 promoter was kindly provided by K. Nasmyth (Institute of Molecular Pathology, Vienna). The Gal promoter was excised from pK2082 and cloned as aBamHI–EcoRI fragment into theBamHI–EcoRI sites of pYcplac22, -33, and -111 yeast centromeric plasmids. mStat5a and mStat5b without the myc tag in addition to allmyc-tagged cDNAs described above were cloned intoEcoRI–SpeI sites of Ycplac33 and -111 yeast plasmids carrying either uracil or leucine selection markers. mJak2, kindly provided by Jim Ihle (St. Jude Children Research Hospital, Memphis, TN), was blunt end-cloned into theHindIII–SalI sites of Ycplac22 carrying a tryptophane selection marker. mJak2ΔJH2 was created by removal of an internal restriction fragment generated by cutting with the restriction enzymes DraI and StuI. Jak2 mutant ΔN was generated by digestion with the restriction enzyme Asp718(KpnI). After removal of the restriction fragment, overhanging ends were filled with Klenow enzyme and ligated. To generate a Stat-dependent reporter gene, a 400-base pair fragment containing three IFP-53-GAS sequences and a cyc-1minimal promoter with SmaI–XbaI sites was generated by PCR and cloned into the SmaI–XbaI sites of the YIp356 integrative yeast plasmid. An antibody recognizing specifically Stat5b (5b) was generated by immunizing rabbits with a peptide comprising the C-terminal 14 amino acids of Stat5b. The Stat5a-specific antibody (5a) was described previously (41Meinke A. Barahmand-pour F. Wöhrl S. Stoiber D. Decker T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6937-6944Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation (IP), antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:100; for Western blots, antibodies were used at a final concentration of 1:5000. Stat5a- and Stat5b-specific antisera were used in EMSA experiments as recently described for Stat5a (41Meinke A. Barahmand-pour F. Wöhrl S. Stoiber D. Decker T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6937-6944Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The monoclonal anti-myc antibody (myc) was obtained from supernatants of the hybridoma cell line 9E10 and used in IP and EMSA at a concentration of 1:10; in Western blots, the dilution was 1:250. The antiserum directed against the amino acids 144–295 of Jak2 was kindly provided by Andrew Zimiecki (University of Bern) and used in IP/Western blotting analysis (final concentration 1:100 for IP and 1:1000 for Western blot). A goat polyclonal antibody directed against a peptide corresponding to amino acids 1110–1129 of mJak2 (Santa Cruz) was used for IP at a final dilution of 1:100 and 1:1000 for Western blotting. The phosphotyrosine-specific antibodies PY20 and 4G10 were purchased from Transduction Laboratories and Upstate Biotechnology Inc., respectively. The final dilution for Western blotting was 1:300 (Py20) and 1:1000 (4G10). The electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed as described by Eilers et al. (37Eilers A. Baccarini M. Horn F. Hipskind R.A. Schindler C. Decker T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1364-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In the present paper, an oligonucleotide corresponding to the GAS sequence from the rat β-casein promoter was used as a probe (42Wakao H. Gouilleux F. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2182-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations were carried out as described previously (41Meinke A. Barahmand-pour F. Wöhrl S. Stoiber D. Decker T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6937-6944Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (buffer C). Nuclei were removed by centrifugation. Appropriate antibodies and protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added, and the mixture was incubated for 4 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed in ice-cold washing solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, 30 mm NaPP, 50 mm NaF, 2 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100. Proteins were separated on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBST (phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h and subsequently incubated with relevant primary antibody for 1 h, washed in PBST, and incubated for 1 h with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membranes were washed in PBST and developed with enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce), followed by exposure to film (Hyperfilm ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For co-immunoprecipitations, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (buffer C). The lysates were incubated with first antibodies at 4 °C. After 2 h, protein A-Sepharose was added, and the mixture was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were then processed as described above. The lithium acetate procedure was used for yeast DNA transformation. Yeast suspensions (1 × 107 cells/ml) were resuspended in lithium solution buffer (1 volume of 10× TE buffer (100 mmTris·Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8), 1 volume of 10× lithium acetate stock solution (1 m lithium acetate, pH 7.5, adjusted with dilute acetic acid), 8 volumes of sterile water) and incubated for less than 1 h at 30 °C before adding the transforming DNA. For each transformation, 200 μg of carrier DNA and less than 5 μg of transforming DNA were mixed in a sterile microcentrifuge tube, and 200 μl of yeast suspension was added. 1.2 ml of freshly prepared polyethylene glycol solution, (8 volumes of 50% polyethylene glycol, 1 volume of 10× TE buffer, pH 7.5, 1 volume of 10× lithium acetate stock solution) was then added to each tube and shaken for 30 min at 30 °C. Heat shock for exactly 15 min at 42 °C enhanced the transformation efficiency. The cells were collected with a microcentrifuge for 5 s at room temperature, resuspended in sterile water, and incubated on the required minimal plates at 30 °C until transformants appeared. Transfection experiments in COS-N31 cells were performed using the SuperFect transfection reagent and the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). For activation of the transfected erythropoietin, the cells were treated with human recombinant erythropoietin (7 units/ml) for 30 min. Extract corresponding to 50–100 μg of total protein was added to 1 ml of buffer Z (60 mmNa2HPO4, 40 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) and incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. The reaction was started by adding 200 μl ofo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside and stopped by adding 0.5 ml of 1 m Na2CO3. The enzymatic activity, determined by absorbance measurement at 420 nm, was calculated in units (1 unit catalyzes the turnover of 1 nmol of o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside/min/μg of protein). The gene encoding murine Jak2 was cloned into a yeast centromeric (single copy) plasmid under the control of a galactose-inducible promoter and introduced into yeast cells. Growth of these cells in liquid media with galactose as a carbon source or the addition of galactose to raffinose-containing medium caused expression of Jak2, and the protein was phosphorylated on tyrosine (Fig.1 a). Fig. 1 a also shows that Jak2 migrates in SDS gels as two clearly distinguishable bands that react with different intensities with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Jak2 is known to be phosphorylated on multiple tyrosines. Therefore, these two bands may represent phosphorylation isoforms of the kinase. Expression levels of total cellular Jak2 were somewhat higher on a protein basis compared with most mammalian cells, but Jak2 never formed a visible band when total cytoplasmic protein was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This indicated that expression of Jak2 was sufficient to cause autophosphorylation, but it did not generate a very high cytoplasmic concentration of the protein. Stat5a and Stat5b proteins were expressed under galactose control similarly to Jak2 protein (Fig.1 b). When Jak2 was co-transformed with these plasmids, Stat5 EMSA activity was observed in cellular extracts (Fig. 1 c), indicating Jak2 activity and productive interaction with both Stat5 isoforms. Importantly, no clear preference for the phosphorylation of either Stat5a or Stat5b was noted (data not shown), indicating that Jak2 has no intrinsic ability to distinguish between the two Stat5 isoforms. A Stat-dependent lacZ reporter gene was cloned on a yeast integration plasmid and inserted into the genome by homologous recombination. Transformation of this reporter strain with both Jak2 and Stat5a or -5b did not produce elevated lacZactivity in cellular extracts, despite the appearance of Stat5 EMSA activity (Fig. 2, a andb). Replacement of the Stat5 C terminus with a VP16 transactivating domain generated a Stat5-VP16 fusion protein, which was phosphorylated by Jak2 at le"

ACS shares the conservation of 11 invariant residues with a family of aminotransferases that includes aspartate aminotransferase.

These mutants have been used in complementation experiments either in vivo inEscherichia coli or in an in vitrotranscription/translation assay to study whether the enzyme functions as a dimer. When the Y92L mutant is coexpressed with the K278A mutant protein, there is partial restoration of enzyme activity, suggesting that the mutant proteins can dimerize and form active heterodimers. Coexpressing a double mutant with the wild-type protein reduces wild-type activity, indicating that inactive heterodimers are formed between the wild-type and the double mutant protein subunits. Furthermore, hybrid complementation shows that another tomato isoenzyme, Le-ACS4, can dimerize and that Le-ACS2 and Le-ACS4 have limited capacity for heterodimerization.

Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1984; 35: 155-189Crossref Google Scholar). The rate-limiting step in ethylene biosynthesis is the conversion ofS-adenosylmethionine to the cyclic amino acid 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) 1The abbreviations used are: ACC, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxyl-ate; ACS, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase; AspAT, aspartate aminotransferase; PLP, pyridoxal 5′ phosphate; BS3, Bi(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; kbp, kilobase pair(s). and methylthioadenosine catalyzed by the enzymeS-adenosyl-l-methionine methylthioadenosine-lyase (ACS, EC 4.4.1.14). ACS is a pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme that is proposed to undergo an α,γ-1,3 elimination reaction that is unique among all PLP-dependent enzymes (2Adams D.O. Yang S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 170-174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Ramalingam K. Lee K. Woodward R.W. Bleecker A.B. Kende H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7820-7824Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). ACS also shares sequence similarity with another group of PLP-dependent enzymes, the amino-transferases (4Rottmann W.H. Peter G.F. Oeller P.W. Keller J.A. Shen N.F. Nagy B.P. Taylor L.P. Campbell A.D. Theologis A. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 937-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 5Huang P. Parks J.E. Rottmann W.H. Theologis A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7021-7025Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). A recent alignment indicates that ACSs have the highest similarity to a sub-group of aminotransferases that includes alanine-, tyrosine-, histidinol phosphate-, phenyl-alanine-, and aspartate (AspAT) aminotransferases and share all the 11 invariant residues in this subgroup including four conserved residues (Gly-197, Asp-222, Lys-258, Arg-386) present in all aminotransferases (Ref. 6Mehta P.K. Hale T.I. Christen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 849-854Crossref Scopus (361) Google Scholar, see Fig. 1 I). The homology between ACS and aminotransferases such as AspAT suggests that these two groups of enzymes may be evolutionary related and raises the possibility that the quaternary structure and co-factor binding sites of these two groups of enzymes may be similar (4Rottmann W.H. Peter G.F. Oeller P.W. Keller J.A. Shen N.F. Nagy B.P. Taylor L.P. Campbell A.D. Theologis A. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 937-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 5Huang P. Parks J.E.

Although most published reports indicate that the enzyme is a homodimer (7Satoh S. Mori H. Imaseki H. Plant Cell Physiol. 1993; 34: 753-760Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 8Sato T. Oeller P.W.

AspAT is a homodimer with functionally independent active sites formed by the interaction of residues from both subunits and thus cannot function as a monomer (13McPhalen C.A. Vincent M.G. Jansonius J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 495-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). It is possible that ACS may also function as a dimer in which the active sites are shared and located at the interface between subunits. The presence of shared active sites in oligomeric proteins can be demonstrated using an elegant approach first described by Wente and Schachman (14Wente S.R. Schachman H.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) for aspartyl transcarbamoylase and since then has been applied to other proteins (15Larimer F.W. Lee E.H. Mural R.J. Soper T.S.

The experimental approach is based on the measurement of enzyme activity obtained from hybrid proteins between wild-type and/or inactive mutants of a protein (Fig.1 II). In this paper we report a series of experiments designed to probe the nature and organization of the active site(s) of the tomato ACS isoenzymes Le-ACS2 and Le-ACS4. In particular, we want to determine whether some of the conserved residues between ACS and aminotransferases are required for active catalysis and thus may be part of the active site of the enzyme. These mutant proteins have also been used to demonstrate that the active site of ACS is located at the interface of the protein subunits, suggesting that the isoenzymes function as dimers. Furthermore the ability of the isoenzymes to heterodimerize has been tested with hybrid complementation experiments. Restriction and DNA modifying enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs and Boehringer Mannheim. Radionucleotides were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Acrylamide and SDS-PAGE gel reagents were from ICN and Bio-Rad. All other chemicals were at least reagent grade and obtained from Sigma. The Escherichia coli strain used for most transformations is Sure: mcrA, D(mcrCB-hsdSMR-mrr)171, endA1, supE-44, thi-1, gyrA-96, relA1, lac, recB, recJ, sbcC, umuC(Kanr),uvrC(Tetr) obtained from Stratagene. E. coli CJ236: dut1, ung1, thi1, relA1/pCJ105(Cmr) (New England Biolabs) was used for site-directed mutagenesis. The plasmid vector used for mutagenesis was Bluescript (Stratagene), whereas pGEM3-Z (Promega) was used for in vitrotranscription and translation. The construction of the two-gene constructs used for the E. coli in vivo coexpression experiments is as follows. The vector was derived from pKK233–2 (Amersham) with the removal of the 1.6-kbpEcoRI-AccI small fragment containing theTet resistance gene and the insertion of an oligonucleotide linker containing restriction sites for NotI,SmaI, and XhoI. An NcoI site was engineered into the 5′ start codon of the Le-ACS2 andLe-ACS4 cDNAs using ptACS2 and ptACS4 (4Rottmann W.H. Peter G.F. Oeller P.W. Keller J.A. Shen N.F. Nagy B.P. Taylor L.P. Campbell A.D. Theologis A. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 937-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) as templates for polymerase chain reaction. The entire Le-ACS2 or Le-ACS4 cDNAs were ligated into the modified pKK233–2 vector as anNcoI-blunt fragment to make the single plasmid construct. To make the two-gene constructs, the 2.7-kbpXhoI-ScaI fragment from the single-gene plasmid construct was gel-purified and ligated to another single-gene plasmid construct that was first digested with NotI, made blunt with Klenow, and subsequently digested with XhoI. The following oligonucleotides were synthesized using a Perkin-Elmer model 392 DNA synthesizer for constructing the following mutants.

Le-ACS4—Y92Q, GAATTCAGGCAATCCATGCTGATCTTG; Y92E, GAATTCAGGCAATCCATGCTCATCTTG; K278A, GTCTTTCCGCG GACTTAG. Routine DNA manipulations were performed as described (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Single mutants were generated using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (20Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar) or by polymerase chain reaction using the oligonucleotides listed above. Mutants were isolated and identified by restriction analysis and sequencing using the Sanger chain termination method (21Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52743) Google Scholar) and the Sequenase version 1.0 kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). ACS cDNA containing two or three mutations were constructed by swapping appropriate restriction fragments. The final mutant cDNAs were sequenced in their entirety to verify that the desired codon changes were the only mutations in the cDNA. Plasmids containing one or two copies of the wild-type or mutated ACS cDNA were transformed in E. coli Sure and grown in 100 ml of LB medium containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 6 h. Aliquots were removed after 6 h for determining the A 600 and ACC accumulation as described by Sato et al. (8Sato T. Oeller P.W. Theologis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3752-3759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Crude protein was obtained from cells harvested from the 100-ml culture and used to determine ACS activity as described (8Sato T. Oeller P.W. Theologis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3752-3759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One unit of ACS activity obtained from crudeE. coli protein is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the formation of 1 nmol of ACC/h at 30 °C and in the presence of 200 μm S-adenosylmethionine. The specific activity is expressed in units/mg of protein. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method using the dye reagent from Bio-Rad and bovine serum albumin as a protein standard. The results in Figs. 2 and 4 represent the average of duplicate samples from three independent experiments. The level of protein expression of the various mutants in E. coli was assessed by immunoblotting. A value of E. coli culture corresponding toA 600 = 1.5 was resuspended in 60 μl of loading buffer (4Rottmann W.H. Peter G.F. Oeller P.W. Keller J.A. Shen N.F. Nagy B.P. Taylor L.P. Campbell A.D.

Samples in Fig. 5 were synthesized using the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system because Le-ACS4 is more efficiently translated in this system. Cross-linking of the35S-labeled proteins was carried out by incubating an aliquot (10 μl) of the transcription and translation reaction with an equal volume of a solution containing 400 mm Hepes, pH 8.5, 20 mm PLP and 2 mm bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3; Pierce) at room temperature for 30 min. The cross-linking reaction is then quenched with the addition of 0.1 volume of 1 m Tris, pH 7.5. SDS-PAGE, Coomassie staining, and immunoblot analysis were performed as described previously (4Rottmann W.H. Peter G.F. Oeller P.W. Keller J.A. Shen N.F. Nagy B.P. Taylor L.P. Campbell A.D. Theologis A. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 937-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Immunoblots were probed with either a 1:3000 dilution of partially purified Le-ACS2 rabbit polyclonal antibody obtained previously (4Rottmann W.H. Peter G.F. Oeller P.W. Keller J.A. Shen N.F. Nagy B.P. Taylor L.P. Campbell A.D. Theologis A. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 937-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) or with a 1:10,000 dilution of partially purified and concentrated mouse polyclonal antibody for Le-ACS4 raised from BalbC mouse using standard techniques. The antibody-antigen complex was visualized with alkaline phosphatase conjugated to goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse IgG (Promega). Aliquots of the transcription and translation reaction were assayed for ACS activity using the procedure of Sato et al.(8Sato T. Oeller P.W. Theologis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3752-3759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific activity of ACS from the transcription and translation reaction was expressed as nmol of ACC formed/h with 200 μm S-adenosylmethionine at 30 °C/107 cpm of radiolabeled synthesized protein. The three-dimensional structure of AspAT has been solved and shows that it functions as a homodimer whose active site is formed from the interaction of residues from the monomeric subunits (13McPhalen C.A. Vincent M.G. Jansonius J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 495-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In particular, the Tyr-70 residue, which helps in anchoring the PLP co-factor to the AspAT apoenzyme, interacts with active-site residues like Lys-258, which forms a covalent Schiff base with the PLP co-factor from the adjacent subunit. The homology of ACS to AspAT suggests that the corresponding residues in ACS may play equivalent roles in PLP binding and catalysis (Ref. 6Mehta P.K. Hale T.I. Christen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 849-854Crossref Scopus (361) Google Scholar, Fig.1 I). Site-directed mutagenesis has been carried out by making substitutions at the Lys-92 and Lys-278 residues. Mutant and wild-type Le-ACS2 cDNAs have been expressed in E. coli, and their activity and levels of protein expression have been determined. The data in Fig.2 show that mutations at these conserved residues severely affect the activity of the enzyme. The decrease in enzyme activity is not due to a decreased expression or stability of the mutant proteins compared with wild-type because immunoblots of wild-type and mutant proteins expressed in E. coli show similar levels of expression (see protein expression in Fig. 2). Fig. 1 IIillustrates how the presence of shared active sites in a dimeric protein can be tested. A prerequisite of this approach is that the mutations should be targeted on residues that are essential for enzyme activity and occupy distinct domains of the active site. Using AspAT as a model, we postulate that the Lys-278 residue in Le-ACS2 is located in an active-site domain distinct from that of the Lys-92 residue of the same subunit. According to the shared active-site model, association between two inactive proteins containing two different active-site mutations results in the formation of active heterodimers (positive complementation; see Fig. 1 IIA), while inactive heterodimers result from the association between wild-type and a mutant protein containing both inactivating mutations (negative complementation; see Fig. 1 IIB). To allow hybridization to occur between two mutant ACS proteins, we have used an in vivo coexpression system in E. coli. This coexpression system has the advantage of utilizing the natural efficiency of subunit assembly that occurs in the cytoplasmic environment (15Larimer F.W. Lee E.H. Mural R.J. Soper T.S. Hartman F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15327-15329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This approach has been used successfully to demonstrate shared active sites in other proteins; however, in most of these experiments, a two plasmid system has been used (15Larimer F.W. Lee E.H. Mural R.J. Soper T.S. Hartman F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15327-15329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Tan D. Ferreira G.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8934-8941Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Because these two plasmids utilize two different replication origins and antibiotic markers for maintenance, they are often present in different copy numbers in the same cell. Thus, expression of the genes found in these two plasmids can be different and difficult to quantify. To minimize this problem we have designed an expression vector to carry two copies of the ACS gene that may have the same or different mutations under the control of the same promoter. To prevent recombination and DNA rearrangements, the plasmid has been transformed into a recombination-deficient E. coli Sure strain. Isolation and sequencing of the two-gene plasmids from E. coli Sure have confirmed the presence of the expected mutations, providing evidence that recombination has not occurred. The level and activity of ACS protein accumulated in E. coli expressing a plasmid with one or two copies of the ACS cDNA are similar (data not shown). To test for positive complementation, the Y92L mutant has been used for coexpression with the K278A single mutant proteins. Coexpression of two inactive mutant ACSs in the same E. coli results in partial restoration of enzyme activity as shown in Fig. 2 (K278A/Y92L, 16%). To test for negative complementation, wild-type Le-ACS2 has been coexpressed with cDNAs containing one mutation as well as with cDNAs containing two inactivating mutations in the same E. coli cell. In agreement with the shared active-site model, activity is reduced to 25% when wild-type and a mutant containing two mutations are coexpressed (Fig. 2, Y92L+K278A/WT), whereas coexpression of the wild type with a mutant with only one inactivating mutation reduces the activity to about 50% that of wild-type activity (Fig. 2, K278A/WT, 55%; Y92L/WT 41%). To verify the results from the in vivo coexpression system, further experiments have been carried out in a cell-free system by expressing the mutant proteins in an in vitro transcription and translation system. ACS has a detectable enzymatic activity when synthesized in vitro either in a wheat germ or a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system. Since the wild-type and mutant proteins are identical with regard to their electrophoretic migration, heterodimer formation can only be inferred from the activity observed from coexpression. In order to distinguish the formation of homo- and heterodimeric proteins, we have used a truncated Le-ACS2 that lacks 46 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus (ΔC46) which retains full enzymatic activity (9Li N. Mattoo A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6908-6917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results of both positive and negative complementation experiments are shown in Fig.3. The enzymatic activity is very low when full-length (Fig. 3 I, lanes 5 and6) or truncated proteins (Fig. 3 I, lanes 9 and 10) containing either the Y92L or K278A mutations are expressed individually. Co-translation of either full-length or truncated proteins containing either the Y92L or the K278A mutations yields 10–11% wild-type activity (Fig. 3, I (lanes 7 and 11) and II, (lanes 3 and4)). The activity of the truncated wild-type (WTΔC46) ACS is reduced to 57% when co-translated with the full-length ACS containing the Y92L mutation, whereas it is reduced to 10% when cotranslated with ACS containing both the Y92L and K278A mutations (negative complementation; Fig. 3 III, lane 2). To demonstrate that dimeric proteins are formed, the in vitro translation products have been cross-linked with a homo-bifunctional cross-linker, BS3, followed by electrophoresis on SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 3, full-length and truncated synthesized proteins can be cross-linked to produce protein complexes with sizes corresponding to the expected dimeric proteins. The estimated sizes are full-length monomer, 56 kDa; truncated monomer, 49 kDa; full-length dimer, 110 kDa; truncated dimer, 98 kDa; heterodimer, ∼105 kDa (Figs. 3, II, lanes 3 and4) and III (lanes 2 and4)). Minor bands corresponding to even higher molecular mass complexes are also observed that may correspond to higher oligomeric forms of the enzyme (Fig. 3 I, II, andIII). When a full-length protein is synthesized simultaneously with a truncated protein, an intermediate-sized cross-linked species is formed that has the molecular mass between a full size and truncated dimer, as seen in Figs. 3, II(lanes 3 and 4) and III (lanes 2 and 4). The cross-linked species represents the dimeric ACS because they are also detected by immunoblotting using an Le-ACS2 polyclonal antibody (see Fig. 3 I, II, andIII). It should be pointed out that the Le-ACS2 antibody has more affinity for full-length protein than for truncated. The antibody is less efficient in detecting both truncated homodimers and the heterodimers that are formed. We have also observed that there is less cross-linked protein for the K278A mutant than for the Y92L mutant protein (see Fig. 3 I, compare lanes 5 and9 with lanes 6 and 10). This may reflect differences in the ability of the mutant proteins to dimerize. Because ACS is encoded by a multigene family in tomato (4Rottmann W.H. Peter G.F. Oeller P.W. Keller J.A. Shen N.F. Nagy B.P. Taylor L.P. Campbell A.D. Theologis A. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 937-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), it is of interest to determine whether other isoenzymes of ACS can function as dimers with shared active sites. In addition, because Le-ACS2 and Le-ACS4 have similar amino acid sequences (69% amino acid identity) and similar expression characteristics, particularly in ripening tomato fruits (4Rottmann W.H. Peter G.F. Oeller P.W. Keller J.A. Shen N.F. Nagy B.P. Taylor L.P. Campbell A.D. Theologis A. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 937-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), we wanted to determine whether the two isoenzymes are able to heterodimerize using the positive complementation approach. Mutations in the Tyr-98 and Lys-282 residues of Le-ACS4 have been constructed and used for coexpression experiments both in vivo and in vitro (Figs.4 and 5). The Y98Q and Y98E mutants as well as the K282A mutant protein do not have ACS activity when expressed in E. coli (Fig. 4) or in the in vitro transcription and translation system (see Fig.5 II, lanes 1–3). When either the Y98Q or Y98E mutated Le-ACS4 protein is coexpressed with the K282A-mutated Le-ACS4 protein, ACS activity is partially restored to about 14% that of the Le-ACS4 wild-type activity in the in vivo E. colicoexpression system (Fig. 4) and 32 and 37% in the in vitrotranscription and translation system (Fig. 5 II, lanes 4 and 5). To determine whether Le-ACS2 and Le-ACS4 are able to heterodimerize, we have performed experiments whereby we coexpressed the Le-ACS2 Y92L mutant with the Le-ACS4 K282A mutant protein and also did the converse experiments where the Le-ACS4 Y98Q or Le-ACS4 Y98E mutant proteins were coexpressed with the Le-ACS2 K278A mutant. The results shown in Fig. 4and Fig. 5 II (lanes 6–8) indicate that there is some restoration of ACS activity and that the activity obtained varies depending on the functional active-site residue on the isoenzyme. For example, coexpression of the Le-ACS2 Y92L with the Le-ACS4 K282A mutant proteins showed 11% wild-type activity in vivo (Fig. 4) and 35% wild-type activity in vitro (Fig. 5 II,lane 6), whereas coexpression of the Le-ACS4 Tyr-92 with the Le-ACS2 K278A mutant proteins showed only 2–5% wild-type activity both in vivo (Fig. 4) and in vitro (Fig.5 II, lanes 7 and 8). The presence of these two isoenzymes in the coexpression experiments is confirmed using polyclonal antibodies for Le-ACS2, which can also detect Le-ACS4, and a more specific antibody for Le-ACS4 as shown in Figs. 4 and 5. Cross-linking with BS3 produces cross-linked proteins corresponding to the homodimers of Le-ACS2 (110 kDa) and high molecular mass complexes of Le-ACS4 (Fig. 5 I, lanes 1 and2). The cross-linked proteins of Le-ACS4 are detected by a specific Le-ACS4 antibody but have a higher molecular mass (∼120 kDa) than the expected dimeric protein (109 kDa). The slower migration of the cross-linked protein may indicate that Le-ACS4 cross-links with a contaminating protein, but it can also be due to a partial unfolding of the protein during the cross-linking reaction. We have been unable to detect any heterodimers that may be formed between Le-ACS2 and Le-ACS4 (Fig. 5, I (lane 3) and II(lanes 6–8)). This negative result, however, does not rule out the formation of heterodimers. The possibility exists that the heterodimers may be inefficiently cross-linked or may migrate close to the Le-ACS2 and Le-ACS4 homodimeric cross-linked proteins. Although the three-dimensional structure of ACS remains unresolved, critical active-site residues have been inferred based on sequence similarity with aminotransferases and functional analysis of mutant proteins. In this work, we have made mutations in the tomato Le-ACS2 and Le-ACS4 isoenzymes in the amino acid residues that correspond to Tyr-70 and Lys-258 of AspAT. Mutations in these residues decrease or completely abolish ACS activity, indicating that these residues play an important role in catalysis. Mutagenesis in some of these residues in the apple ACS shows that the resulting mutant proteins also have reduced enzymatic activity and altered kinetic properties (10White M.F. Vasquez J. Yang S.F. Kirsch J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12428-12432Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the proposition that the conserved residues may have a similar role in catalysis as their counterparts in the aminotransferases (10White M.F. Vasquez J. Yang S.F. Kirsch J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12428-12432Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Thus, the sequence similarity between ACS and aminotransferases such as AspAT may extend to a similarity in structure. The subunit structure of ACS is controversial. ACS is reported to be either dimeric or monomeric depending on from which species it has been purified. To obtain further insight on the subunit structure and active-site localization of ACS, we have carried out in vivoand in vitro complementation experiments that allow the determination of whether tomato Le-ACS2 and Le-ACS4 also have shared active sites and function as dimers. We observe partial restoration of ACS activity when expression plasmids harboring two inactive Le-ACS2 mutants are expressed in a recombination-deficient E. coliSure strain. Cells harboring these plasmids exhibit 16% wild-type ACS activity, which is close to the theoretical value of 25% (Fig.1 II). This result has been verified by in vitrotranscription and translation reactions of the inactive Y92L and K278A mutant ACS. This positive complementation result demonstrates an interaction between the two inactive mutants to form partially active heterodimers, indicating that ACS must be able to dimerize. Protein level complementation, however, can result from different mechanisms. In the conformational correction model, folding of the mutant enzyme is defective, and the adjacent subunit serves as a template to aid in the folding process (14Wente S.R. Schachman H.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Complementation can also occur when active sites are made up of amino acid residues from the two interacting subunits, and a functional active site can thus be formed from the properly folded components of the two defective subunits. To rule out the first model and thus provide evidence for shared active sites in ACS, a negative complementation experiment has been carried out. Negative complementation is demonstrated when association between wild-type and double-mutant subunits results in a significant reduction in wild-type activity, reflecting the formation of completely inactive heterodimers. In both in vivo and in vitro coexpression experiments, it has been observed that although coexpression of wild-type with a single mutant protein decreased ACS activity about 50%, coexpression with a double mutant protein decreased activity to about 25% in vivo and 10% in vitro of wild-type activity (Figs. 2 and 3). The formation of heterodimers is clearly demonstrated from cross-linking experiments of in vitrosynthesized full-length and truncated Le-ACS2. The Le-ACS2 ΔC46 deletion mutant has been reported to be monomeric and with 450% of the specific activity as the full-length protein (9Li N. Mattoo A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6908-6917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although our data indicate that this truncated protein is indeed highly active, the specific activity is only 120% that of the full-length wild-type protein. The difference could be due to the fact that the previous paper based their specific activity on the apparent amount of the ACS protein as detected from Western blots. Using the same Le-ACS2 rabbit polyclonal antibody that they had used, we have observed that the antibody has a lower titer for the truncated protein than for the full-length protein (Fig. 3). This can account for an underestimation of the amount of truncated Le-ACS2 that will inflate its specific activity. Our results indicate that the truncated Le-ACS2 produces a cross-linked band of the expected size of a dimeric protein. Coexpression experiments of Le-ACS2 ΔC46 with Y92L and K278A mutations also show complementation (Fig. 3 I, lane 11). Thus, contrary to their claim that Le-ACS2 ΔC46 is monomeric, our data clearly show that it is able to dimerize. Complementation studies with another tomato ACS isoenzyme, Le-ACS4, provide strong evidence that it is also able to dimerize and has shared active sites. However, coexpression studies between inactive mutants of Le-ACS2 and Le-ACS4 are unclear as to whether these two isoenzymes can heterodimerize. Although complementation studies between inactive mutants of Le-ACS2 and Le-ACS4 show some restoration of enzyme activity, the restored activity is very low and is not corroborated by the results from the cross-linking with BS3 (Fig. 5). However, it is interesting that there is a difference between the activity of the coexpressed constructs depending on the mutation (or the functional amino acid) that is present on the isoenzymes. For instance when the Tyr-92 mutation is on Le-ACS2 and the Lys-278 mutation is on Le-ACS4, the coexpressed proteins are more active than when the Tyr-92 mutation is on Le-ACS4 and the Lys-278 mutation is on Le-ACS2. Furthermore some of our preliminary studies indicate that the former resembles Le-ACS2 in its kinetic properties, particularly in the time course of reaction with S-adenosylmethionine, whereas the latter is more like Le-ACS4 (data not shown). It is possible that the functional heterodimers that are formed in the two co-expressions have different kinetic properties. A similar result has been previously reported from in vitro complementation studies to form functional protozoan and mouse heterodimers of ornithine decarboxylase (22Osterman A. Grishin N.V. Kinch L.N. Phillips M.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13662-13667Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Osterman et al. (22Osterman A. Grishin N.V. Kinch L.N. Phillips M.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13662-13667Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) found that the substrate binding properties of the restored active site of the cross-species heterodimer mimic the characteristics of the wild-type enzyme from the species that contributed the subunit with the functional Lys that serves as the Schiff base of the PLP co-factor. In summary, by utilizing in vivo and in vitrocomplementation experiments, we provide compelling evidence that ACS has an intersubunit or shared arrangement with its active sites and that it functions as a dimer. This active site arrangement has been previously found for a number of oligomeric enzymes; however, in most of these cases dissociation of the oligomeric protein produces inactive monomers. Bovine serum RNase is the only example in the literature of a dimeric enzyme with shared active sites that is also functional as a monomer (23Piccoli R. Di Donato A. D'Alessio G. Biochem. J. 1988; 253: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In view of the fact that previously reported experimental evidence indicates that tomato ACS is able to function as a monomer, the question that can be asked is whether ACS must dimerize to function or whether ACS may be active both as a monomer and as a dimer and have shared active sites. Our experimental results cannot distinguish between these two possibilities. The experimental strategy we have used, however, can be used to screen which other residues are part of the active site of ACS. Our complementation studies also show that a dominant negative effect is observed when mutant proteins are coexpressed with the wild type, resulting in an inhibition of ACS activity. This raises the prospect that expression of mutant ACS isoforms in transgenic plants using their own promoters may inhibit ACS expression in a cell- and tissue-specific manner. This reverse genetics strategy may allow the elucidation of the role of each ACS isoform during plant growth and development. We thank Dr. William Rottmann for his seminal observation on the sequence similarity between ACSs and aminotransferases and his suggestion to carry out complementation experiments to demonstrate the presence of shared active sites in ACS. We also thank Dr. Jose Alfredo Cura, Dr. Yutaka Oono, Dr. Paul Overvoorde, and Salvador Tarun, Jr. for critical reading of the manuscript."

Cryptococcus neoformans is a haploid yeast that causes systemic infection in immunocompromised humans. The organism has tropism for the central nervous system where it produces chronic meningitis. The incidence of infection in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome is ∼10% (1Mitchell T.G. Perfect J.R. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 8: 515-548Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). New ways of treating cryptococcal meningitis are needed given the limitations of currently available fungicidal and fungistatic agents (e.g. Refs. 2Powderly W.G. Finkelstein D.M. Feinberg J. Frame P.

An ideal drug target would be a fungal gene product that is expressed under the conditions of infection and that is essential for the viability of the organism. The metabolic pathway and/or substrate specificities of the target protein should be distinguishable from those of the human host. Finally, it would be desirable if the protein is common to many fungal pathogens and is required for their survival. Studies of C. neoformans pathogenesis have revealed several virulence genes. They encode products involved in capsule formation (CAP59 and CAP64), synthesis of melanin (CNLAC1), and mating (MFα). GPA1functions as a regulator of each of these functions (4Alspaugh J.A.

One reason for the paucity of such tests is that targeted gene disruption is limited by several factors inC. neoformans. Homologous recombination appears to be inefficient (4Alspaugh J.A.

Moreover, in the absence of a conditional lethal allele, disruption of an essential gene in this haploid organism will produce death, precluding further analysis of the function of the gene. The C. neoformans gene encoding myristoyl-CoA:proteinN-myristoyltransferase (EC 2.1.3.97) (NMT) 1The abbreviations used are: NMT, gene encoding myristoyl-CoA:protein N-myristoyltransferase; Arf, ADP ribosylation factor; kb, kilobase pair; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. fulfills many of the criteria for an anti-fungal target. Nmt is a monomeric enzyme that catalyzes the co-translational transfer of myristate, a 14-carbon saturated fatty acid, from CoA to the N-terminal Gly residue of nascent proteins. Cellular N-myristoylproteins have diverse biological functions (22Bhatnagar R.S. Gordon J.I. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 14-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The enzyme appears to be ubiquitously expressed in eukaryotes, including the two organisms that are the principal causes of systemic fungal infections in immunosuppressed humans, C. neoformans and Candida albicans (23Weston S.A.

In vitro studies of purified orthologous Nmts have shown that their acyl-CoA substrate specificities are highly conserved, whereas their peptide substrate specificities are divergent. These differences in peptide recognition have been exploited to develop species-selective peptidomimetic inhibitors (Refs. 25Devadas B. Zupec M.E. Freeman S.K. Brown D.L. Nagarajan S. Sikorski J.A.

In addition, genetic tests have established thatNMT is essential for the growth and viability of bothC. neoformans and C. albicans (19Lodge J.K. Jackson-Machelski E. Toffaletti D.L. Perfect J.R.

NMT represents a unique example of an essential C. neoformans gene where a conditional lethal allele has been generated by homologous recombination. This allele was based on a mutant Saccharomyces cerevisiae NMT1 allele (nmt1-451D). nmt1-451D contains a single nucleotide substitution that results in replacement of an absolutely conserved Gly, located 5 residues from the C terminus of the enzyme, with an Asp (32Duronio R.J. Rudnick D.A. Johnson R.L. Johnson R.D. Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1313-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This substitution reduces the affinity of the enzyme for myristoyl-CoA (33Zhang L. Jackson-Machelski E. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33131-33140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The analogous mutation in C. neoformans NMT is Gly487 → Asp (nmt487D). A strain containing several copies of nmt487D, including one at the endogenous locus, was produced (19Lodge J.K. Jackson-Machelski E. Toffaletti D.L. Perfect J.R. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12008-12012Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). It is a myristic acid auxotroph. Withdrawal of myristate produces rapid growth arrest and death within 4 h (19Lodge J.K.

Virulence studies using isogenic NMT andnmt487D strains and an immunosuppressed rabbit model of cryptococcal meningitis established that genetic attenuation of Nmt activity allows the host to rid itself of an otherwise fatal infection (19Lodge J.K. Jackson-Machelski E. Toffaletti D.L. Perfect J.R. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12008-12012Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In the present study, we generated a strain of C. neoformanswith a single copy of nmt487D at the endogenous gene locus. This strain was used to correlate cellular proteinN-myristoylation with growth and viability. Moreover, strains expressing wild type C. neoformans or human Nmt were employed to show that a species-selective, fully depeptidized inhibitor of the acyltransferase produces fungicidal effects through an Nmt-dependent mechanism. Strains generated during the course of these studies are described in Table I. Two C. neoformansstrains, MO49 (ade2, NMT) and CMD2 (ADE2, nmt487D), have been described previously (19Lodge J.K.

A strain derived from MO49 with an unmapped insertion of ADE2 was named CAP8 in an earlier report (19Lodge J.K. Jackson-Machelski E. Toffaletti D.L. Perfect J.R. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

The ARF insert in pCN36-23 was sequenced in its entirety to verify that no unanticipated mutations had been introduced by PCR. pHS20-57 was used to express human Nmt in C. neoformans. This plasmid consists of five components: (i) a 1.4-kb fragment fromC. neoformans NMT that includes transcriptional regulatory elements from its 5′-nontranscribed domain. This fragment spans the region from the HindIII site of pCN25–28 (19Lodge J.K. Jackson-Machelski E. Toffaletti D.L. Perfect J.R. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1405-1411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The diameter of the gold particles was 0.6 μm. When strain MO49 was transformed with pCN28-14 (nmt487D; 19), cells were selected based on their ability to grow at 24 °C on YNB supplemented with 0.8 g/liter complete synthetic medium without adenine (CSM-ade: Bio 101), 500 μm myristate, 1% Brij 58, and 1 m sorbitol. When strain CMD19 was transformed with pCN36-23 (ARF), cells were selected at 24 °C on YPD containing 200 units/ml hygromycin (Calbiochem). When CMD19 was transformed with either pCN25-28 (C. neoformans NMT) or pHS20-57 (human NMT), cells were selected for their capacity to grow at 35 °C on YPD without supplements. NMT copy number was quantitated by scanning Southern blots of genomic DNA. Fresh colonies were picked from plates into YPD, and the liquid cultures were adjusted to anA 595 = 0.1. Aliquots (250 μl) were inoculated into 5 ml of YPD or YPD containing 500 μm myristate and 1% Brij 58. Cultures were then incubated with shaking at 24 or 37 °C. Aliquots (10 μl) were withdrawn at various time points and diluted 1:10 with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and theA 595 of the sample was determined using a Molecular Devices Thermomax microplate reader. All strains were grown at each condition in triplicate, and each A 595measurement was done in triplicate. Five-milliliter cultures of C. neoformans strains were grown overnight at 24 °C in YPD supplemented 500 μm myristate and 1% Brij 58. The cells were then pelleted by centrifugation at 900 × gfor 10 min at room temperature, washed once in PBS, pelleted once more, and then were resuspended in 0.25 ml of a solution containing 2% SDS, 80 mm Tris, pH 6.8, and 2 mm Pefabloc (Boehringer Mannheim). Following addition of 0.5 ml of zirconia/silica beads (0.5 mm diameter, Biospec Products), the cells were vortexed (3 pulses of 1 min, alternating with 1 min of incubation on ice). The resulting lysates were boiled for 5 min and clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min. Glycerol (final concentration = 5% v/v), 2-mercaptoethanol (2%), and bromphenol blue (0.002%) were added. Equal amounts of lysate were fractionated by electrophoresis through 10% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% SDS (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). The separated proteins were then transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore) transfer membranes (38Lodge J.K. Jackson-Machelski E. Gordon J.I. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Protein blots were probed with a previously characterized rabbit anti-C. albicans Nmt sera (final dilution = 1:1000-fold in blocking buffer; Refs. 24Lodge J.K. Johnson R.L. Weinberg R.A. Gordon J.I.

Fifty-milliliter cultures of C. neoformans strains were grown overnight in YPD, 500 μm myristate, 1% Brij 58 at 24 °C to anA 595 ≈2.0–3.0. The cultures were then centrifuged as above, washed twice in 25 ml of PBS, and resuspended in 4–6 ml of YPD. A 1-ml aliquot was added to 10 ml of YPD or YPD, 500 μm myristate, 1% Brij 58. Following a 2-h incubation at 24 or 37 °C, cells were pelleted, washed once in 5 ml of PBS, and resuspended in 0.5 ml of a solution containing 4% SDS and 0.125m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8. Two volumes of 0.5 mm zirconia/silica beads were added, and cells were disrupted by vortexing as described above. Cleared lysates were prepared and denatured, and the cellular proteins were fractionated using a 16-cm long, 0.75-mm thick, 12% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% SDS (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). Separated proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes. The protein blots were subsequently incubated with a previously characterized rabbit anti-S. cerevisiae Arf1p sera (R40, a generous gift of R. Kahn, Emory University) diluted 1:50,000 in PBS containing 1% gelatin, 0.2% Tween 20, and 0.1% sodium azide. Antigen-antibody complexes were detected using the Tropix Western-Light kit. Synthesis of this compound was accomplished according to the scheme shown in Fig.1 and involved reacting the amine (1) with the 2-methylimidazole carboxylic acid (2) in the presence of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (see Ref. 39Devadas B. Freeman S.K. McWherter C.A. Kishore N.S. Lodge J.K. Jackson-Machelski E. Gordon J.I. Sikorski J.A. J. Med.

The resulting product was treated with trifluoroacetic acid at ambient temperature, and the final product (SC-61213) was isolated by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography. The 1H NMR and mass spectral data of SC-61213 were consistent with the structure presented in Fig. 1. A stock solution of 40 mm SC-61213 was prepared in sterile deionized water, and aliquots were stored at −20 °C prior to use. The effects of SC-61213 on purified C. neoformans, human, and S. cerevisiae Nmts were defined using a previously described two-step enzyme assay (40Rudnick D.A. Duronio R.J. Gordon J.I. Hooper N.M.

An octapeptide representing the N-terminal sequence of a C. neoformans Arf (GLSVSKLL-NH2) was used as a substrate peptide (final concentration = 10 nm to 2 μm). [3H]Myristoyl-GLSVSKLL-NH2was purified from the reaction mixture by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography using a C18 10-μm μBondapak column (dimensions = 3.9 × 300 mm; Waters Corp.) and a linear gradient from H2O, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 0.05% triethylamine to 100% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The amount of labeled myristoylpeptide recovered was quantitated with an in-line scintillation counter (42Kishore N.S. Lu T.B. Knoll L.J. Katoh A. Rudnick D.A. Mehta P.P. Devadas B. Huhn M.

Peptide K m andV max values were determined for each Nmt from double-reciprocal plots. The K m value at each inhibitor concentration and the type of inhibition were determined using double-reciprocal plots (43Segel I.H. Biochemical Calculations: How to Solve Mathematical Problems in General Biochemistry. 2nd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1976Google Scholar). K i values were calculated from Dixon plots (1/v versus [I]; see Ref. 43Segel I.H. Biochemical Calculations: How to Solve Mathematical Problems in General Biochemistry. 2nd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1976Google Scholar). All assays were performed at least twice, each time in triplicate. The minimal inhibitory concentration of SC-61213 was defined by a broth microdilution anti-fungal test performed according to the protocol described by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) tentative standard (44National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards Reference Method for Broth Dilution Antifungal Susceptibility Testing of Yeasts: Tentative Standard, Document M 27-T. National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards, Villanova, PA1995Google Scholar). Briefly, RPMI 1640, buffered to pH 7.0 with MOPS or to pH 5.4 with MES, was introduced together with varying amounts of SC-61213 into each well of a 96-well microtiter plate (Falcon).C. neoformans strains CPA8 and HMC1 were then added to the wells according to the NCCLS protocol. Microtiter plates were incubated at 35 °C without shaking. Forty-eight and 72 h after inoculation, the cells in each well were resuspended by pipetting, and the A 550 of the resulting suspension was determined using a Molecular Devices Thermomax plate reader. SC-61213 was tested in a series of 2-fold dilutions over the concentration range 100 to 1.6 μm. Each dilution of the compound was tested on two separate occasions, each time in triplicate. Controls included (i) media without any inoculated C. neoformans to confirm that no contaminants were acquired during the course of the incubation; (ii) media with the isogenic C. neoformans strains but with no drug; and (iii) media containing the strains plus a known fungicidal agent (amphotericin B, 0.25–4 μg/ml).

Mutations in either the NRF-1 or in the two cyclic AMP response elements on the cytc promoter significantly reduce cyt c promoter activation produced either by electrical stimulation (Xia, Y., Buja, L. M., Scarpulla, R. C., and McMillin, J. B. (1997)Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 94, 11399–11404) or by transfection of c-jun into nonpaced cardiac myocytes. Electrical stimulation of cardiac myocytes activates the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (McDonough, P. M., Hanford, D. S., Sprenkle, A. B., Mellon, N. R., and Glembotski, C. C. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 24046–24053) so that the fold-activation of the cyt c promoter is increased by pacing when either c-jun or c-fos/c-jun were cotransfected. Physical association of NRF-1 protein with the NRF-1 enhancer element and of c-Jun with the cyclic AMP response element binding sites on the cytc promoter was demonstrated by gel shift competition assays and by antibody super shifts. This is the first demonstration that induction of NRF-1 and c-Jun by pacing of cardiac myocytes directly mediates cyt c gene expression and mitochondrial proliferation in response to hypertrophic stimuli in the heart. Activation of cytochrome c (cytc) transcription in electrically stimulated neonatal rat cardiac myocytes is preceded by transient expression of the activating protein-1 family of transcription factors, c-Fos, c-Jun, and JunB, as well as nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF-1).

Electrical stimulation of cardiac myocytes activates the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (McDonough, P. M., Hanford, D. S., Sprenkle, A. B., Mellon, N. R., and Glembotski, C. C. (1997) J. Biol.

This is the first demonstration that induction of NRF-1 and c-Jun by pacing of cardiac myocytes directly mediates cyt c gene expression and mitochondrial proliferation in response to hypertrophic stimuli in the heart. Hypertrophic growth is a basic mechanism for increasing cell size in post-mitotic cardiac muscle. Hearts that have been subjected to hemodynamic stress increase intermediate early gene and contractile protein expression as part of the hypertrophic response. Likewise, in cardiac myocytes in culture, application of mechanical stimuli produces increases in the intermediate early genes c-fos, c-jun and junB (1Xia Y. Buja L.M. Scarpulla R.C. McMillin J.B.

Yazaki Y. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1993; 55: 55-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). When neonatal rat cardiac myocytes in culture are paced, both the content and organization of cellular contractile proteins increase (6McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11665-11668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The increased energy demand resulting from electrical stimulation of cardiac myocytes is associated with increased mitochondrial number and cytochrome oxidase activity (7Xia Y. Buja L.M. McMillin J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12082-12087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The proliferation of mitochondria observed with electrical stimulation is coincidental with increased mRNA content for cytochrome oxidase subunit Va and cytochrome c (1Xia Y. Buja L.M. Scarpulla R.C.

Pacing also increases c-fos, β-myosin heavy chain, and cytochrome cpromoter activities which coincide with the rise in their respective gene transcripts. These results are consistent with the interpretation that electrical stimulation of cardiac myocytes produces transcriptional activation of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins. Therefore, electrical stimulation provides a model whereby physiologically meaningful expression of transcription factors specific to nuclear-encoded mitochondrial target genes in cardiac myocytes can be identified. Pacing of cardiac myocytes induces a rise in cytoplasmic calcium, an event which has been demonstrated to activate multiple signaling pathways (8Greengard P.

Atrial natriuretic factor (anf) gene induction by electrical stimulation in neonatal cardiac myocytes is dependent on Ca2+ influx and calmodulin activity (6McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11665-11668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

These authors concluded that maintenance of elevated JNK activity is important for development of the hypertrophic state. The latter data, together with observations that JNK is activated by Ca2+(12Mitchell F.M. Russell M. Johnson G.L. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 381-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 13Enslen H.

A. 1996; 93: 10803-10808Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) and that transcriptional activation of the cardiac-specificanf promoter occurs by collaborative interactions between JNK, c-Jun, serum response factor and Sp-1 (2McDonough P.M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 24046-24053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), suggest that there is participation of c-Jun in pathways involving Ca2+-activated gene expression and the hypertrophic response. Recent studies from our laboratory also support a potential regulatory role for activating protein-1 (AP-1) as well as nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF-1) in the initiation of mitochondrial proliferation in response to electrical stimulation. The promoters of many nuclear genes encoding respiratory subunits are at least partially dependent on the nuclear respiratory factors, NRF-1 and NRF-2 (reviewed in Ref. 14Scarpulla R.C. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1996; 6: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These nuclear transcription factors also act on genes that encode key components of mitochondrial transcription and replication suggesting that they may act to coordinate nuclear-mitochondrial interactions (15Virbasius J.V. Scarpulla R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1309-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Consistent with an important role of NRF-1 in mitochondrial gene activation, mutations in the NRF-1 site of the cyt cpromoter inhibited the induction by electrical stimulation by 5-fold (1Xia Y. Buja L.M. Scarpulla R.C. McMillin J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11399-11404Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Likewise, mutations in the CRE (ATF) sites of the cyt cpromoter also significantly reduced the induction of this gene by electrical stimulation (1Xia Y. Buja L.M. Scarpulla R.C. McMillin J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11399-11404Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Recent findings suggest that the Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB families of transcription factors interact and should be grouped into a superfamily of transcription factors (16Hai T. Curran T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3720-3724Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar). Since both NRF-1 and Fos/Jun mRNAs appear in time just prior to activation of cyt c gene expression, and since AP-1 factors play a central role in mitogenesis (17Andrisani O.M. Zhu Z. Pot D.A. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2181-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), we asked whether AP-1 is involved in cytc gene expression, and whether this involvement is a direct interaction. The results herein describe the transcriptional response of the cyt c promoter to a hypertrophic stimulus in the neonatal cardiac myocyte. Neonatal (1–3 day old) cardiac myocytes were isolated and plated in 12-well dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% Hyclone calf serum at a plating density of 4 × 105 cell/21 cm as described previously by this laboratory (7Xia Y. Buja L.M. McMillin J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12082-12087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). After 24 h, the serum-containing medium was removed, and the cells were washed and subsequently maintained for 72 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, in the absence of serum, containing 1% bovine serum albumin (fraction V). The medium was exchanged for fresh serum-free medium at 2 days. After 4 days in culture (24 h + serum, 72 h − serum), three wells containing myocytes were stimulated for 72 h using the method of Brevet et al. (18Brevet A. Pinto E. Peacock J. Stockdale F.E. Science. 1976; 193: 1152-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) as modified by McDonough and Glembotski (6McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11665-11668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Three additional wells in the dish were maintained in the same medium as the stimulated cells, but in the absence of contractile stimulation. During the experimental period, the medium bathing the control and stimulated cells was changed after 48 h to fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 1% bovine serum albumin. RNA was isolated (Ultraspec RNA isolation system, Biotex Laboratories, Houston, TX) either at a single time or during sequential experiments (0, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h) from control or electrically stimulated neonatal rat cardiac myocytes. For Northern blot analysis, 20 μg of total cellular RNA was electrophoresed in 1% agarose containing 0.6% formaldehyde at 45 V for 3 h. Fractionated RNA was transferred to a Duralon-UV nylon membrane (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) by capillary action for 24 h. After blotting, the RNA was cross-linked to the filter by UV irradiation. Following prehybridization overnight at 42 °C, the blot was hybridized in the same prehybridization solution containing 1% dextran sulfate and the labeled cDNA fragment of cyt c(1Xia Y. Buja L.M. Scarpulla R.C. McMillin J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11399-11404Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). After washing, the blots were visualized by autoradiography following storage at −70 °C for 24 h. The MNRFIRP plasmid containing the 487-base pairClaI-SphI fragment includes coding exon 2 of the mouse nrf-1 gene in pGEM7Zf. Radiolabeled RNA transcripts were synthesized from template DNA linearized with Eco0109 as described by the Promega technical manual using Sp-6 RNA polymerase, ATP, GTP, UTP and [α-32P]CTP (0.5 mm each) in the presence of RNasin and spermidine. After DNase digestion, the cRNA probes were hybridized to 20 μg of total RNA and then digested with RNase A (Boehringer Mannheim), and the RNA/RNA hybrid was analyzed using 3.5% PAGE in the presence of 8 m urea. Autoradiography was performed as described above for Northern blots. The plasmid pRC4Luc/−326 containing 1.1 kilobase pairs of the first intron and the 5′-flanking region of rat cyt c was constructed by cloning the BglII and XhoI fragment from RC4RAT/−326 (Dr. Richard C. Scarpulla, Northwestern University) into the pGL3-Basic vector. Cloning the BglII and XhoI fragments of the respective mutant promoters into pGL3-Basic vector generated plasmids containing the mutated cyt c promoter constructs (mSp-1, dmCRE, and mNRF-1). The mSp-1-Luc mutation was generated in the first intron by a +83/+100 deletion and point mutations of +103 and +104 from CC to ag; the dmCRE was generated by a double mutation in two CRE sites, respectively: −119/−96, from CTACGTCAC to CTAatTaAt, and −281/−256, from TGACGTCA to TGAatTaA; mNRF-1 was generated byBamHI linker insertion at SphI between −172 and −147. The plasmid pc-Fos (pF100) was constructed by cloning the full human c-fos cDNA (Dr. Ann-Bin Shyu, the University of Texas Medical School at Houston) into a pGM-2 vector betweenEcoRI and HindIII restriction sites. The plasmid pc-Jun was constructed by cloning a 2.6-kilobase pair fragment of c-jun cDNA into the pGM-2 vector betweenEcoRI sites. The plasmid pJunB was constructed by cloning 1.2-kilobase pair fragment of JunB cDNA into pGM-2 vector betweenEcoRI and SmaI sites. The canonical AP-1 response element, TRE-Luc, and the neutral core promoter, Δ56 Fos-Luc, were generous gifts of Dr. Michael Schneider (Baylor College of Medicine). Cardiac myocytes were grown in serum-containing medium for 24 h; the myocytes were transfected by the (Ca)3(PO4)2 precipitation method (19Poyton R.O. Trueblood C.E. Wright R.M. Farrell L.E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1988; 550: 289-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To detect the interrelationship of the early gene products with subsequent expression of later genes, e.g. cytc, 0.1 μg of pc-Fos, 1 μg of pc-Jun, and 1 μg of pJunB were cotransfected singly or in combination with 2 μg of wild type or the mutated cyt c promoters. In each case, 2 μg of Rous sarcoma virus β-galactosidase (β-gal) expression plasmid was cotransfected to monitor transfection efficiency. Six hours after transfection, the cells were washed twice and maintained in serum-free medium for another 12 h. Electrical stimulation was initiated and cell extracts were isolated either at the point when electrical stimulation began (zero time) or after 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h. The control cells were maintained under the same conditions as the stimulated cells, only in the absence of electrical stimulation. Luciferase and β-gal assays were performed (20Ansubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R. Struhl K. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1.

Nuclear extracts were isolated from control and stimulated cardiac myocytes. Cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, put on ice, and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The pellet was dissolved in buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, put on ice for 5 min, gently vortexed, and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was dissolved in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 420 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, gently vortexed while on ice, and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was stored at −70 °C. Gel mobility shift assays were performed as follows. 10–20 μg of nuclear extracts were incubated with 2–5 × 105 cpm of32P-end-labeled DNA probe in 20 μl of 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.9, 25 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mmdithiothreitol, 0.025% Nonidet P-40, 50 μg/ml poly(dI-dC) or poly (dG-dC), and 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Poly(dI-dC) was used for assays involving both cyt c CRE and Sp-1 probes; poly(dG-dC) was used for assays involving the cyt c NRF-1 probe. DNA-protein complexes were incubated at room temperature for 20 min. For supershifts with antibodies anti-c-Jun, anti-CREB-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechology) and anti-NRF-1 (gift of Dr. Richard Scarpulla, Northwestern University School of Medicine), the complexes were further incubated under the same conditions for an additional 20 min. The reaction mixtures were loaded on a 5% low ionic strength polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide:bisacrylamide, 80:1) containing 45 mm Tris borate, and 1 mm EDTA, and electrophoresed in 45 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA at room temperature and 250 V for 2 h. After drying, the gel was visualized by autoradiography following storage at −70 °C for 6–12 h. The significance of the changes reported was determined using Student's t test for paired and nonpaired variates. Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. Activation of c-fos, c-jun, and junB in cultured myocytes and in intact animals precedes the hypertrophic response with up-regulation of “fetal” cardiac isoforms (1Xia Y. Buja L.M. Scarpulla R.C.

Chem. 1997; 272: 14057-14061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Electrical stimulation of neonatal cardiac myocytes induces sequential expression of c-Jun, NRF-1, and cyt c mRNA (1Xia Y. Buja L.M. Scarpulla R.C. McMillin J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11399-11404Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). To answer the question whether increased levels of c-Jun expression, independent of electrical stimulation, can increase mRNA for either NRF-1 and/or cytc, we overexpressed c-Jun by cotransfecting the c-jun expression vector with β-galactosidase in neonatal cardiac myocytes. The mRNA for NRF-1 began to rise after 3 h of transfection of c-jun, peaked at 12 h, and declined to control levels at 24 h. Subsequent to the rise in NRF-1, a small (67%) but significant induction of cyt c mRNA in the transfected, unstimulated myocytes was observed at 12 and 24 h (Fig. 1). These results suggest that induction of c-jun early gene expression, either by transfection or by electrical stimulation (1Xia Y. Buja L.M. Scarpulla R.C. McMillin J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11399-11404Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), is important for subsequent expression of nrf-1. These experiments also raise the possibility that, in addition to NRF-1, intermediate early genes may also play a direct role in cyt c gene transcription in the heart. Mutational analysis has revealed the essential role of CRE and NRF-1 sites in the cyt c promoter in the response of cardiac myocytes to electrical stimulation (1Xia Y. Buja L.M. Scarpulla R.C. McMillin J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11399-11404Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that AP-1 proteins might map to one or both electrical stimulation response elements of the cyt c promoter (i.e. CRE and NRF-1), unstimulated cardiac myocytes were cotransfected with the c-jun expression vector and a luciferase reporter gene driven by the wild-type or by series mutants of the cyt c promoter. Negative control experiments were carried out by transfection of empty vector/β-gal alone or with c-jun, as well as transfection of the neutral core promoter, Δ56 Fos-Luc/β-gal alone or with c-jun. There was no inductive response of the reporter gene in either of the negative control transfections (Fig. 2). The TRE-Luc/β-gal transfection served as a positive control. The unstimulated cardiac myocytes demonstrated a slight inductive response (p < 0.05) with the TRE expression construct alone, and this response was significantly (p < 0.01) augmented by cotransfection with c-jun (Fig. 2). Similarly, transfection of cyt c/β-gal alone produced a small but significant (p < 0.05) augmentation of reporter gene expression, and this increase was significantly (p < 0.01) enhanced by cotransfection with c-jun (Fig. 2). Mutation of Sp-1 sites in the cyt c promoter did not alter transactivation by c-Jun. In contrast, mutation of both CRE sites reduced c-Jun-dependent promoter transcription by 80% (p < 0.05, Fig. 2). Mutation of the NRF-1 site in the cyt c promoter resulted in 57% decrease from reporter gene activity when myocytes were transfected with c-jun(p < 0.05, Fig. 2). The dependence of the cytc promoter on intact NRF-1 sites in the absence of electrical stimulation is consistent with up-regulation of NRF-1 mRNA observed with transfection of c-jun (Fig. 1). Together, these mutations suggest that both CRE and NRF-1, but not Sp-1, are necessary for full transactivation of the cyt cpromoter by c-Jun. Electrical stimulation of neonatal rat cardiac myocytes produces an early (15 min to 3 h) increase in c-Fos, c-Jun, and JunB mRNA, with subsequent induction of cyt c beginning at 12 h (1Xia Y. Buja L.M. Scarpulla R.C. McMillin J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11399-11404Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). To determine whether the cyt c promoter is a physiological target for c-Fos, c-Jun and JunB activities in heart, cardiac myocytes were cotransfected with the cyt c Luc/β-gal reporter genes with c-fos, c-jun, and junB expression vectors (singly or in combination) in the absence of electrical stimulation (open bars, Fig.3). Although expressed at low levels, the cyt c promoter was significantly (p < 0.05) activated by c-Fos, c-Jun, or JunB alone (5.35-, 5.89-, and 7.05-fold, respectively; Fig. 3, open bars). The effect of c-fos alone appears to be an amplification of the response of the cyt c promoter to endogenous levels of c-Jun present in these cells (1Xia Y. Buja L.M. Scarpulla R.C. McMillin J.B.

This interpretation is supported by activation of the TRE promoter construct when it is transfected alone in unstimulated cells (see Fig. 2). When the combinations c-fos +junB and c-jun + junB, were cotransfected with cyt c/β-gal, cyt c promoter gene activities were not different when compared with the single transfection of junB (Fig. 3, open bars). However, the combination of c-fos/c-jun slightly (1.5-fold) increased cyt c promoter expression compared with cotransfection with either c-fos or c-jun alone (Fig. 3, open bars). This small response may be rate limited by c-Jun phosphorylation by the low levels of JNK activity present in unstimulated neonatal cardiac myocytes (2McDonough P.M. Hanford D.S. Sprenkle A.B.

Pacing specifically activates c-Jun N-terminal kinase so that the combination of pacing and c-jun transfection of cardiac myocytes synergistically stimulates expression of theanf promoter (2McDonough P.M.

Based on these observations, electrical stimulation should further increase the c-jun enhancement of cyt c promoter expression (Fig. 2) by activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase. Effects due to pacing were assessed by taking the ratio of the levels of cyt c promoter expression in the paced, transfected myocytes to the levels in control (nonpaced), transfected cardiac myocytes (Fig. 3). Pacing stimulated cytc transcription 5.7-fold (Fig. 3, compare filled bars to open bars). The stimulatory effect of pacing on cyt c promoter activation was not further enhanced by cotransfection of junB (ratio = 6.0) or by the combinations of c-fos + junB (ratio = 6.3) and of c-jun + junB (ratio = 5.7) (Fig. 3). Significant increases (p < 0.05) in cyt cpromoter activation by electrical stimulation were seen in cardiac myocytes which were cotransfected with c-jun alone (ratio = 8.5) or with c-jun + c-fos(ratio = 8.38) (Fig. 3). These results implicate the AP-1 proteins, c-Fos and c-Jun, in the activation of cyt ctranscription as mitochondria proliferate in response to electrical stimulation (7Xia Y. Buja L.M. McMillin J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12082-12087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Since both CRE and NRF-1 elements are essential for the response of cardiac myocytes to electrical stimulation, transcription factors that bind to these sites should be increased in cells subjected to pacing. Densitometric analysis of gel mobility shift assays were used to estimate the extent to which 32P-end-labeled CRE and NRF-1 elements were shifted in the presence of nuclear extracts from control and paced cardiac myocytes (Fig.4 A). CRE-1 label density increased by 3-fold, CRE-2 increased by 2-fold, and NRF-1 increased by 1.5-fold (Fig. 4 A). Confirming that the shifts were a result of a specific interaction between protein factors and the specific enhancer DNA, competition assays were carried out using unlabeled CRE-1, CRE-2, mCRE-1, mCRE-2, and NRF-1, as well as authentic AP-1 oligonucleotide (Fig. 4 B). Unlabeled probes specific for each element were effective competitors, whereas the mutated probes were not (Fig. 4 B). Unlabeled AP-1 was tested for its ability to compete for extract protein binding to labeled CRE-1 and CRE-2. In each case, the observed shifts of both labeled enhancer oligonucleotides were abolished (Fig. 4 B). These results demonstrate that protein factors binding to the CRE sites also bind the AP-1 probe with high affinity, consistent with the suggestion that there is a Jun-dependent transactivation of cytc. The ability of the AP-1 oligonucleotide to compete with protein associated with the CRE sites on the cytc promoter suggests that c-Jun might activate CRE by physical association with these sites. To identify the protein associated with CRE, supershifts were performed by using anti-c-Jun (Fig. 5). Anti-c-Jun completely blocked both CRE shifts (Fig. 5, CRE-1 and -2, lanes 3), suggesting that the protein associated with the CRE sites is c-Jun. Conversely, anti-NRF-1 did not interact with CRE-bound protein (Fig. 5, CRE-1 and -2, lanes 4). Parallel experiments were carried out using AP-1 as the consensus probe. Anti-c-Jun, but not anti-NRF-1, produced a supershift with protein bound to the AP-1 oligonucleotide (Fig. 5, AP-1, lanes 3 and 4), confirming th"

Optimal conditions for activation and inactivation of the target transgene were determined using a luciferase reporter gene. Analyses of mRNA stability were thereupon conducted on cells that were doubly transfected with transactivator and inducible target genes and derived from pooled clones of transfected cells. Rates of mRNA decay were compared upon inactivation of the transgenes after high levels of mRNA had been induced. Deletion of the 445-nucleotide (nt) 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) (L/+++−) or 527 nt of the 3′-coding region (3′-CR) (L/++−+) increased the stability of NF-L mRNA compared with the full-length (L/++++) transcript in neuronal (N2a and P19 cells) and non-neuronal (L cells) lines. Deletion of both the 3′-UTR and 3′-CR (L/++−−) led to a further stabilization of the transcript. A major stability determinant was then localized to a 68-nt sequence that forms the junction between the 3′-CR and 3′-UTR of NF-L and is the binding site of a unique ribonucleoprotein complex (Cañete-Soler, R., Schwartz, M.

The studies establish a novel system for mapping determinants of mRNA stability and have applied the system to localize determinants that regulate the stability of the NF-L mRNA. Altering mRNA stability is a universal post-transcriptional mechanism for modulating gene expression during growth, development and differentiation. Post-transcriptional regulation may be particularly important in cells, such as neurons, that undergo extensive differentiation and change after cessation of cell division. Alterations in mRNA stability are known to affect the levels of several key proteins in post-mitotic neurons (2Hadcock J.R. Wang H.Y. Malbon C.C. J. Biol.

Moreover, levels of NF expression have been implicated in motoneuron disease by virtue of the selective motoneuron degeneration that occurs when a light (NF-L) or heavy (NF-H) subunit transgene is overexpressed in transgenic mice (8Xu Z.

A transient up-regulation of endogenous NF mRNA also precedes the spontaneous motoneuron degeneration in the Wobbler mice (10Pernas-Alonso R. Schaffner A.E. Perrone-Capano C. Orlando A. Morelli F.

Functional assays for mapping stability determinants use a variety of methods to compare stabilities of mutant versus wild-type mRNAs (11Ross J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 423-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most of these methods are limited by their disruptive or pleiotrophic effects on the host cells and are, therefore, especially problematic for assessing stabilities of long-lived mRNAs. An alternative method is provided by the development of the tetracycline-responsive promoter system whereby target gene expression is stringently controlled by a non-toxic antibiotic ligand (12Gossen M.J.

Here, we have adapted this system to assess mRNA stability in neuronal and non-neuronal cell lines and to map stability determinants in the NF-L transcript. The method has enabled the identification of stability determinants in the 3′-CR and 3′-UTR of the NF-L mRNA and have localized a key determinant to a 68-nt sequence at the junction of the 3′-CR and 3′-UTR. pUHD15.1, pUHD10.3, and pUHD13.3 were a generous gift of Dr. H. Bujard. pUHD15.1M is a modified expression vector that was rendered autoinducible (see Ref. 16Shockett P. Difilippantonio M. Hellman N. Schatz D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6522-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) by placing an EcoRI site and consensus translation start sequence immediately upstream of the tTA open reading frame and subcloning theEcoRI/BamHI PCR fragment from pUHD15.1 into the polylinker of pUHD10.3. Full-length and mutant mouse NF-L cDNAs (see Fig.1) were constructed by splicing together three PCR fragments. Fragment 1 extended from +1 to a BglII site at +829 in exon 1, fragment 2 extended from +829 to aKpnI site at +1208, and fragment 3 extended from +1208 to a site (+2180) 25 bp upstream of the AATAAA termination signal. The PCR template for fragment 1 was a genomic clone of NF-L, and templates for fragments 2 and 3 were cDNAs generated from mouse spinal cord.HindIII and XbaI sites were placed in the flanking primers to facilitate cloning of cDNAs into theHindIII/XbaI polylinker sites of pRC/RSV (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) and pRC/tet (modified pRC expression vector in which the Rous sarcoma virus promoter was replaced with the heptamerized Tn-10 tet operator sequence). The pRC/tet vector containing the full-length NF-L cDNA was designated L/++++. A deletion mutant lacking 445 bp of 3′-UTR (L/+++−) was created by splicing PCR fragment 3, which extended 3′ to a site (+1740) just beyond the TGA stop codon. A deletion mutant lacking 445 bp of 3′-UTR and 527 bp of the coding region (L/++−−) was generated by splicing PCR fragments 1 and 2 and placing a TGA stop codon at +1212. A deletion mutant lacking only the 3′-coding region (L/++−+) was made by splicing with PCR fragment 3 containing a KpnI site, TGA stop codon, and 3′-UTR. A 68-bp deletion at the junction of 3′-CR and 3′-UTR (+1735) was generated by splicing upstream and downstream PCR fragments that lacked sequence between +1712 (BspMI site) and +1979 (HincII site) and placing a stop codon at +1712. Wild-type sequence in L/++++ was then replaced with the PCR fragment and designated L/++/del/++. Constructs were sequenced to confirm the integrity of junctional and Tn-10 tet operator sequences. HeLa, P19, N2a, and 3T3 (L) cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and transiently or stably transfected using calcium phosphate (20Shneidman P.S. Bruce J. Schwartz M.L. Schlaepfer W.W. Mol. Brain Res. 1992; 13: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) or LipofectAMINE (7Schwartz M.L. Bruce J. Shneidman P.S. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26364-26369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Cells were cotransfected with transactivator (pUHD15.1 or pUHD15.1M) and pSVZeo (Invitrogen), selected with Zeocin, and pooled (>100 clones). Cells were then transfected with target genes bearing tetracycline-responsive promoters, selected with G418 and Zeocin, and pooled (>100 clones). Growth and selection were conducted in the presence of tetracycline (0.5 μg/ml). The presence of the transgenes was monitored by PCR. The luciferase reporter gene driven by the tetracycline-responsive promoter (pUHD13.3) was used to test tetracycline-mediated regulation of transcription. Pooled clones of N2a, P19, and L cells bearing pUHD15.1 or pUHD15.1M were transiently transfected with pUHD13.3 and assayed for luciferase activity after 24 h in the absence of tetracycline. pUHD13.3 was also stably transfected by cotransfecting with pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Luciferase activity was measured by luminometer (Lumat LB 9501; Berthold, Wildbad, Germany) using a luciferase kit (Promega, Madison, WI) according to manufacturer's instructions. NF-L expression was compared in pooled clones of N2a, P19, and L cells that had been doubly transfected with pUHD15.1M and pRC/tet vectors bearing wild-type or mutant NF-L cDNAs. Cells were grown in the absence of tetracycline, split into replicate plates, and harvested in triplicate for NF expression at varying time points after readdition of tetracycline. Ribonuclease protection assays were conducted as described previously (3Schwartz M.L. Shneidman P.S. Bruce J. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24596-24600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A luciferase reporter gene with tetracycline-responsive promoter (pUHD 13.3) was used to test the ability of the tTA transactivator expression vectors (pUHD15.1 or pUHD15.1M) to confer tetracycline-sensitive activation in neuronal (P19 and N2a)versus non-neuronal (L cells) cell lines. Preliminary studies with transient transfections revealed increases in luciferase activity of 2–4 orders of magnitude in neuronal and non-neuronal cell lines by 24 h after withdrawal of tetracycline (data not shown), as reported previously in other cell lines (12Gossen M.J. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4253) Google Scholar, 13Gossen M.J. Bujard H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 471-475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 14Gossen M.J. Bujard H. BioTechniques. 1995; 19: 213-216PubMed Google Scholar). A similar range of induction was observed in cell lines that were transiently cotransfected or that had been stably transfected with the tTA transactivator vector. Expression vectors with constitutive (pUHD15.1) and autoinducible (pUHD15.1M) promoters were both effective in conferring tetracycline-responsive activation. To monitor the tetracycline-responsive promoter system for both activation and inactivation of the test gene, the luciferase reporter gene was stably transfected into cell lines containing the autoinducible tTA transactivator expression vector (pUHD15.1M). To reduce position effects and disparity in copy numbers, multiple clones were pooled for each transfection. The luciferase gene in doubly transfected cell lines was highly sensitive to tetracycline (Fig.2 A) and was rapidly activated and inactivated upon withdrawal and readdition of tetracycline (Fig. 2,B and C). Induction factors ranged from 100- to 300-fold after 24 h and reached maximal levels by 72 h after withdrawal of tetracycline in the neuronal and non-neuronal cell lines. There was also rapid decreases of luciferase activity upon readdition of tetracycline, with less than 5% and 0.5% of residual activities after 24 and 48 h, respectively. Levels of tetracycline-inducible luciferase expression did not differ appreciably in cell lines transfected with varying admixtures of tTA expression vectors driven by constitutive (pUHD15.1) and autoinducible (pUHD15.1M) promoters. NF-L cDNAs driven by the tetracycline-responsive promoter were readily inducible upon withdrawal of tetracycline in P19 and N2a cells (Fig.3) as well as in L cells (data not shown). Increases of 50–100-fold in NF-L mRNA levels occurred in P19 and N2a cell lines in which the tTA expression (pUHD15.1M) and NF-L target (L/++++) vectors had been transfected. NF-L expression was not induced in the parental N2a cells lacking a NF-L transgene (Fig. 3,parental); however, there was low level leakage from the L/++++ transgene in the presence of tetracycline (Fig. 3, 0 h). Background in P19 cells was also derived from endogenous NF-L gene expression. Interestingly, marked increases of NF-L transgene expression in P19 cells was accompanied by up-regulation of endogenous NF-M gene expression. Occasionally, there also appeared to be slight increases in NF-H expression. The stabilities of wild-typeversus mutant NF-L mRNAs were compared by inducing NF-L transgene expression for 72 h and then measuring mRNA levels at varying time points after the readdition of tetracycline. Fig.4 depicts a representative experiment of mRNA decay in P19 cells containing wild-type (L/++++) or mutant (L/++−+, L/+++−, and L/++−−) NF-L target transgene. Fig.5 shows the average decline of NF-L/β-actin mRNA levels in N2a and P19 cells from three experiments. Similar pattern of NF-L mRNA decay was observed in L cells (data not shown). In all instances, wild-type (L/++++) NF-L mRNA was relatively unstable, comparable to measurements using actinomycin-induced decay (3Schwartz M.L. Shneidman P.S. Bruce J. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24596-24600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion of 3′-CR (L/++−+) or 3′-UTR (L/+++−) diminished the loss of NF-L mRNA in each of the cell lines tested. Moreover, deletion of both 3′-CR and 3′-UTR (L/++−−) was additive in that it further diminished the loss of the NF-L transcript. Short term (6 h) losses of NF-L mRNAs from wild-type and mutant transgenes in P19 cells showed intermediate levels of decline (data not shown), supporting the view that decreases in the rate of loss of NF-L/β-actin mRNA over time may be due to increasing admixtures of mRNA from the endogenous NF-L gene. The loss of NF-L mRNA upon inactivation of the transgene in P19 cells was accompanied by a parallel loss of NF-M mRNA expression that had been up-regulated by induction of the transgene. Interestingly, the up-regulation (and subsequent down-regulation) of the endogenous NF-M gene did not occur with high level expression of the L/++−− mutant NF-L mRNA.Figure 5NF-L mRNA decay in P19 and in N2a cells following activation and inactivation of transcription of wild-type (L/++++) and mutant (L/++−+, L/+++−, and L/++−−) NF-L cDNAs, as described in Fig. 4.

Data were averaged from three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To localize stability determinants in NF-L transcript, a NF-L transgene (L/++/del/++) was constructed with a 68-nt segment deleted from the junction between the coding region and 3′-UTR. The deleted sequence corresponded to the binding site of the C-binding RNP complex (1Cañete-Soler R. Schwartz M.L. Hua Y. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Biol.

Loss of NF-L mRNA from the deleted transgene (L/++/del/++) was much less than that from the wild-type transgene (L/++++) upon tetracycline-induced inactivation of the transgenes in N2a cells (Fig. 6). In fact, TableI shows that the NF-L transcript was stabilized to a similar extent either by deletion of the 68-nt segment from the junction of 3′-CR and 3′-UTR (L/++/del/++) or by deletion of 527 nt from the 3′-CR and 445 nt of 3′-UTR (L/++++). Deletion of either the 3′-CR (L/++−+) or 3′-UTR (L/+++−) led to intermediate levels of stabilization. A diminished rate of mRNA decay from the deleted transgene (L/++/del/++) was also observed in L cells (data not shown). The findings indicate that a major stability determinant is localized to the junction between the 3′-CR and 3′-UTR.Table IStabilities of mutant and wild-type NF-L mRNAs in N2a cellsTransgenesHalf-liveshL/++++17.2L/++−+22.5L/+++−34.0L/++−−46.8L/++/del/++48.2 Open table in a new tab The tetracycline-responsive promoter system provides for stringent, non-toxic, and high level control of specific gene expression using either the addition or withdrawal of the antibiotic ligand (or derivatives) to activate or repress transcription (12Gossen M.J.

The present study has adapted this system to study mRNA stability using the ligand to turn off transcription after high levels of the test gene mRNA are attained. For this purpose, the use of tetracycline as a repressor is advantageous in that the kinetics of the off reaction is mediated by the addition rather than by the disappearance (i.e. half-life) of the ligand. Our methods have also incorporated some safeguards such as the pooling of stably transfected clones to equalize test gene copy number, reduce position effects, and limit alterations from genetic perturbations during passage of the transgenes. Pooling of transfectants may reduce levels of induction but generates sufficient and comparable levels of transgene mRNAs for ready assessment of transcript decay. The relative persistence in steady-state levels of mutantversus wild-type NF-L mRNA after inactivation of the transgene indicates that deletion of either the 3′-coding region (L/++−+) or the 3′-UTR (L/+++−) removes destabilizing components from the NF-L transcript. The increased stability of the double mutant (L/++−−) mRNA suggests that sequences in the 3′-CR and in the 3′-UTR may also act in an additive or cooperative manner. Multiple determinants in the 3′-coding region and 3′-UTR have also been detected in other neuronal transcripts (21Nishizawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 789-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 22Nishizawa K. Okamoto H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The latter possibility is supported by the localization of a major stability determinant to a 68-nt sequence at the junction of 3′-CR and 3′-UTR of NF-L. Both the 3′-CR and 3′-UTR sequence in the 68-nt fragment are necessary for assembly of a unique C-binding RNP complex at this site (1Cañete-Soler R. Schwartz M.L. Hua Y. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12655-12661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the stability of the α-globin mRNA is also regulated by a determinant on the proximal edge of the 3′-UTR that is dependent upon sequence in the adjacent 3′-CR (25Weiss I.G. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8123-8133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Wang X. Kiledjian M. Weiss I.G. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 1769-1777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The increased stability of the mutant NF-L transcripts in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells suggests that destabilization of NF-L mRNA involves common components that are widely present in different cell lines. Moreover, the relative instability of wild-type NF-L mRNA in both neuronal and non-neuronal cell lines, compared with the extraordinary stability of the transcripts in primary neurons (3Schwartz M.L. Shneidman P.S. Bruce J. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24596-24600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), raises the possibility that NF mRNA levels are regulated by altering a default destabilization pathway. Such putative stabilizing conditions (or factors) might help to explain the discrepancy between the high levels of NF expression that are attained in vivoand the low levels of NF expression that occur in vitro. It also indicates that destabilization of NF mRNA may provide key insights into the mechanisms regulating levels of NF expression and their role in motoneuron degeneration. The increases in steady-state levels of endogenous NF-M mRNA that accompany high level expression of the wild-type (L/++++) or single mutant (L/++−+ or L/+++−) transgenes in P19 cells could be due to the titering of a component(s) that serves to destabilize the NF-L and NF-M transcripts. The inability of the double mutant (L/++−−) transgene to up-regulate NF-M expression may indicate that the function of the putative component(s) in destabilizing NF-L and NF-M mRNAs requires both the 3′-CR and 3′-UTR. Similar changes were not observed in N2a or L cells but would have been precluded by methylation and nonexpression of the NF-L and NF-M genes in these cell lines (27Bruce J. Schwartz M.L. Shneidman P.S. Schlaepfer W.W. Mol. Brain. Res. 1993; 17: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Up-regulation of NF-L upon overexpression of an NF-M transgene has been reported in transgenic mice (28Tu P.-H. Elder G. Lazzarini R.A. Nelson D. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1629-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), although the relationship between transgene and endogenous gene expressions may not be comparable to that in P19 cells by virtue of the greater stability of NF mRNA in vivo as well as the much higher levels of trangene expression achieved in vitro. Our biochemical studies have not only identified the binding site of a unique C-binding RNP complex at the juction of 3′-CR and 3′-UTR but have also detected multiple binding sites of a U/A-binding RNP complex in the 3′-CR and 3′-UTR of NF-L mRNA (1Cañete-Soler R. Schwartz M.L. Hua Y. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12655-12661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Moreover, binding of the C-binding and U/A-binding complexes show a pattern of reciprocal interactions, as if competing for common factors or binding sites. To what extent the different complexes enhance or alter the stability of NF-L transcript is presently unknown. The tetracycline-responsive promoter system, herein described, provides a functional assay that will enable a more precise mapping of regulatory elements and, thereby, facilitate the identification and cloning of cognate binding factors that regulate neurofilament gene expression."

Its activity was lost when the Ser119 in the conserved GXSXG motif was changed to Ala by site-directed mutagenesis. The sequences of the liver and macrophage enzymes showed no sequence similarity to other lysophospholipid-hydrolyzing enzymes, such as carboxyl ester lipase (7Han J.H. Stratowa C. Rutter W.J.

Rijken D. van Deenen L.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 369: 50-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), rabbit myocardium (63 kDa) (24Gross R.W. Drisdel R.C. Sobel B.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 6252-6258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Partially purified enzymes were also obtained from lung (50-kDa) (26Brumley G. van den Bosch H. J. Lipid Res. 1977; 18: 523-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and stomach (27Lin Y.N. Wassef M.K. Horowitz M.I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 193: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Most lysophospholipases of this type were shown to exhibit transacylase activity as well, producing one molecule of disaturated phosphatidylcholine from two molecules of lyso-PC releasing GPC. In addition, the beef liver enzyme was reported to exhibit platelet-activating factor (PAF) acetylhydrolase activity (28Aarsman A.J. Neys F.W. Van den Bosch H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, the molecular structure of the large form lysophospholipase was totally unknown. In this paper, we report the cDNA cloning of a large form lysophospholipase from rat liver using antibody against the purified enzyme (25Sugimoto H. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6252-6258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cloned cDNA encoded 564 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 60,794 and showed no sequence similarity to the small form lysophospholipases of rat liver and macrophage, indicating that the large form lysophospholipase is evolutionarily apart from the small form enzyme. The large form enzyme was predicted to be composed of two domains, the amino-terminal putative catalytic domain significantly resembling Escherichia coliasparaginase I and the carboxyl-terminal ankyrin repeat. When the cDNA was transfected into HEK293 cells, not only lysophospholipase activity but also asparaginase and PAF acetylhydrolase activities were expressed.DISCUSSIONThis paper reports the initial cloning of large form lysophospholipase in mammalian tissues. The sequence bears little sequence similarity to that of small form lysophospholipase (12Sugimoto H. Hayashi H. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7705-7711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 20Wang A. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12723-12729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Small form lysophospholipase resembles the esterases ofPseudomonas fluorescens (21Hong K.H. Jang W.H. Choi K.D. Yoo O.J. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1991; 55: 2839-2845Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar) and Spirulina platensis (22Salvi S. Trinei M. Lanfaloni L. Pon C.L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 243: 124-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and contains the esterase/lipase consensus, Gly-X-Ser-X-Gly (12Sugimoto H. Hayashi H. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7705-7711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 20Wang A. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12723-12729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The serine in the consensus is part of the esterase catalytic triad, Ser-Asp-His, and plays a role of nucleophile in the hydrolytic reaction of the enzyme. In P388 macrophage lysophospholipase, the catalytic triad was assigned to Ser119–Asp174–His208 (67Wang A. Loo R. Chen Z. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22030-22036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In contrast to the small form lysophospholipase, large form lysophospholipase resembles microbial asparaginases. Indeed, the large form lysophospholipase cloned here catalyzed the hydrolysis of asparagine. The mechanism of the asparaginase reaction is reminiscent of that of serine esterase. However, threonine, rather than serine, has been postulated to play a role of nucleophile (52Swain A.L. Jaskolski M. Housset D. Rao J.K. Wlodawer A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1474-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), and lysine, instead of histidine, is thought to enhance the nucleophilicity of the threonine (51Lubkowski J. Palm G.J. Gilliland G.L. Derst C. Rohm K.H. Wlodawer A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Crystallographic and biochemical studies identified the asparaginase catalytic triad as Thr89-Asp90–Lys162 for E. coli asparaginase II (52Swain A.L. Jaskolski M. Housset D. Rao J.K. Wlodawer A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1474-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), Thr100-Asp101–Lys173 forPseudomonas 7A asparaginase (50Lubkowski J. Wlodawer A. Ammon H.L. Copeland T.D. Swain A.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10257-10265Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and Thr93-Asp94–Lys166 for W. succinogenes asparaginase (51Lubkowski J. Palm G.J. Gilliland G.L. Derst C. Rohm K.H. Wlodawer A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment of 60-kDa lysophospholipase with these bacterial asparaginases suggests that the catalytic triad of the enzyme might be Thr116-Asp117–Lys188, which had well conserved surrounding sequences. It is tempting to speculate that these amino acids play an essential role in the catalytic activity of 60-kDa lysophospholipase and that the Thr116 is the nucleophile involved in the formation of the acyl-enzyme intermediate.From the results of RT-PCR, mRNA encoding 60-kDa lysophospholipase is expressed at high levels in liver and kidney and a low level in stomach but at negligible levels in other tissues. Lysophospholipase-transacylase partially purified from gastric mucosa (27Lin Y.N. Wassef M.K. Horowitz M.I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 193: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) showed similar properties to the rat liver enzyme. It had a pH optimum at 6.0 with the K m value of 0.25 mm for lyso-PC, but it was only 10% active at pH 8.5. The isoelectric point was determined to be 5.4, while the value for the liver enzyme was calculated to be 5.39 from the deduced amino acid sequence. Thus, the gastric enzyme described by Lin et al.(27Lin Y.N. Wassef M.K. Horowitz M.I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 193: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) is probably the same as the present enzyme. de Jong et al. (11de Jong J.G. van den Bosch H. Rijken D. van Deenen L.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 369: 50-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) reported the purification of a large form lysophospholipase called lysophospholipase II with a molecular mass of 60 kDa from bovine liver. The bovine enzyme was shown to be localized in the microsomal fraction (68van den Bosch H. de Jong J.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 398: 244-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To examine the relationship of 60-kDa lysophospholipase to the enzyme of de Jong et al. (11de Jong J.G. van den Bosch H. Rijken D. van Deenen L.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 369: 50-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), we performed Western blot analysis of rat liver microsomes using the antibody against the 60-kDa enzyme. The antibody recognized a 60-kDa protein in microsomes. Furthermore, we could solubilize lysophospholipase-transacylase activity with Triton X-100 and purify it by a procedure similar to that used for the enzyme in the soluble fraction. 2H. Sugimoto, unpublished results. Moreover, lysophospholipase II catalyzed the deacetylation of PAF (28Aarsman A.J. Neys F.W. Van den Bosch H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and the 60-kDa enzyme also exhibited the same activity. Thus, lysophospholipase II described by de Jong et al. (11de Jong J.G. van den Bosch H. Rijken D. van Deenen L.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 369: 50-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and the 60-kDa enzyme reported here are very likely the same enzyme. The only difference reported between lysophospholipase II and the 60-kDa enzyme is that the former was reported to be deficient in transacylase activity, but this could be due to the different conditions used for transacylase assay,e.g. pH of the reaction mixture. Lysophospholipase-transacylase was also purified from other sources, such as heart (24Gross R.W. Drisdel R.C. Sobel B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 15165-15172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and lung (26Brumley G. van den Bosch H. J. Lipid Res. 1977; 18: 523-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), clearly showing that heart and lung are rich sources of large form lysophospholipase. However, as shown above, the transcript encoding hepatic 60-kDa lysophospholipase could not be detected in heart and lung. These results are consistent with the view that a different isoform of large form lysophospholipase is present in heart and lung.An interesting feature of 60-kDa lysophospholipase is that it contains the ankyrin repeat in the C-terminal region. Various forms of the ankyrin repeat have been found in many proteins involved in tissue differentiation and cell cycle control. However, the motif was recently shown to be also contained in a class of phospholipase, calcium-independent phospholipase A2 (6Tang J. Kriz R.W. Wolfman N. Shaffer M. Seehra J. Jones S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8567-8575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The enzyme activity was shown to be lost when the ankyrin repeat was deleted, although the active site of the enzyme still remained (6Tang J. Kriz R.W. Wolfman N. Shaffer M. Seehra J. Jones S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8567-8575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The ankyrin repeat is often regarded as a motif for protein-protein interaction (69Lux S.E. John K.M. Bennett V. Nature. 1990; 344: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), and the ankyrin repeat in calcium-independent phospholipase A2 was proposed to be involved in enzyme activity through oligomeric complex formation. 60-kDa lysophospholipase contains not only the ankyrin repeat but also leucine zipper motif. Probably, the enzyme exists in a complexed form with some other protein that may regulate the activities of the enzyme. Identification and characterization of such a binding protein would provide a useful information on the regulation and physiological function of 60-kDa lysophospholipase.

The rat liver enzyme comprised 230 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 24,708 Da (12Sugimoto H. Hayashi H. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7705-7711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and showed significant similarity to microbial esterases (21Hong K.H. Jang W.H. Choi K.D. Yoo O.J. Agric.

Genet. 1994; 243: 124-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) with the GXSXG consensus conserved in the active sites of serine esterases, proteases, and lipases. The murine macrophage enzyme was also composed of 230 amino acid residues and showed 96.5% amino acid identity to the rat liver enzyme (20Wang A. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12723-12729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Its activity was lost when the Ser119 in the conserved GXSXG motif was changed to Ala by site-directed mutagenesis. The sequences of the liver and macrophage enzymes showed no sequence similarity to other lysophospholipid-hydrolyzing enzymes, such as carboxyl ester lipase (7Han J.H. Stratowa C. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1617-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 8Kyger E.M. Wiegand R.C. Lange L.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Large form lysophospholipases with molecular masses of 50–63 kDa were purified from beef liver (60 kDa) (11de Jong J.G. van den Bosch H. Rijken D. van Deenen L.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 369: 50-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), rabbit myocardium (63 kDa) (24Gross R.W. Drisdel R.C. Sobel B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 15165-15172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and rat liver (60 kDa) (25Sugimoto H. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6252-6258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Partially purified enzymes were also obtained from lung (50-kDa) (26Brumley G. van den Bosch H. J. Lipid Res. 1977; 18: 523-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and stomach (27Lin Y.N. Wassef M.K. Horowitz M.I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 193: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Most lysophospholipases of this type were shown to exhibit transacylase activity as well, producing one molecule of disaturated phosphatidylcholine from two molecules of lyso-PC releasing GPC. In addition, the beef liver enzyme was reported to exhibit platelet-activating factor (PAF) acetylhydrolase activity (28Aarsman A.J. Neys F.W. Van den Bosch H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, the molecular structure of the large form lysophospholipase was totally unknown. In this paper, we report the cDNA cloning of a large form lysophospholipase from rat liver using antibody against the purified enzyme (25Sugimoto H. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6252-6258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cloned cDNA encoded 564 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 60,794 and showed no sequence similarity to the small form lysophospholipases of rat liver and macrophage, indicating that the large form lysophospholipase is evolutionarily apart from the small form enzyme. The large form enzyme was predicted to be composed of two domains, the amino-terminal putative catalytic domain significantly resembling Escherichia coliasparaginase I and the carboxyl-terminal ankyrin repeat. When the cDNA was transfected into HEK293 cells, not only lysophospholipase activity but also asparaginase and PAF acetylhydrolase activities were expressed. DISCUSSIONThis paper reports the initial cloning of large form lysophospholipase in mammalian tissues. The sequence bears little sequence similarity to that of small form lysophospholipase (12Sugimoto H. Hayashi H. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7705-7711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 20Wang A. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12723-12729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Small form lysophospholipase resembles the esterases ofPseudomonas fluorescens (21Hong K.H. Jang W.H. Choi K.D. Yoo O.J. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1991; 55: 2839-2845Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar) and Spirulina platensis (22Salvi S. Trinei M. Lanfaloni L. Pon C.L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 243: 124-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and contains the esterase/lipase consensus, Gly-X-Ser-X-Gly (12Sugimoto H. Hayashi H. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7705-7711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 20Wang A. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12723-12729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The serine in the consensus is part of the esterase catalytic triad, Ser-Asp-His, and plays a role of nucleophile in the hydrolytic reaction of the enzyme. In P388 macrophage lysophospholipase, the catalytic triad was assigned to Ser119–Asp174–His208 (67Wang A. Loo R. Chen Z. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22030-22036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In contrast to the small form lysophospholipase, large form lysophospholipase resembles microbial asparaginases. Indeed, the large form lysophospholipase cloned here catalyzed the hydrolysis of asparagine. The mechanism of the asparaginase reaction is reminiscent of that of serine esterase. However, threonine, rather than serine, has been postulated to play a role of nucleophile (52Swain A.L. Jaskolski M. Housset D. Rao J.K. Wlodawer A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1474-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), and lysine, instead of histidine, is thought to enhance the nucleophilicity of the threonine (51Lubkowski J. Palm G.J. Gilliland G.L. Derst C. Rohm K.H. Wlodawer A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Crystallographic and biochemical studies identified the asparaginase catalytic triad as Thr89-Asp90–Lys162 for E. coli asparaginase II (52Swain A.L. Jaskolski M. Housset D. Rao J.K. Wlodawer A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1474-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), Thr100-Asp101–Lys173 forPseudomonas 7A asparaginase (50Lubkowski J. Wlodawer A. Ammon H.L. Copeland T.D. Swain A.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10257-10265Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and Thr93-Asp94–Lys166 for W. succinogenes asparaginase (51Lubkowski J. Palm G.J. Gilliland G.L. Derst C. Rohm K.H. Wlodawer A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment of 60-kDa lysophospholipase with these bacterial asparaginases suggests that the catalytic triad of the enzyme might be Thr116-Asp117–Lys188, which had well conserved surrounding sequences. It is tempting to speculate that these amino acids play an essential role in the catalytic activity of 60-kDa lysophospholipase and that the Thr116 is the nucleophile involved in the formation of the acyl-enzyme intermediate.From the results of RT-PCR, mRNA encoding 60-kDa lysophospholipase is expressed at high levels in liver and kidney and a low level in stomach but at negligible levels in other tissues. Lysophospholipase-transacylase partially purified from gastric mucosa (27Lin Y.N. Wassef M.K. Horowitz M.I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 193: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) showed similar properties to the rat liver enzyme. It had a pH optimum at 6.0 with the K m value of 0.25 mm for lyso-PC, but it was only 10% active at pH 8.5. The isoelectric point was determined to be 5.4, while the value for the liver enzyme was calculated to be 5.39 from the deduced amino acid sequence. Thus, the gastric enzyme described by Lin et al.(27Lin Y.N. Wassef M.K. Horowitz M.I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 193: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) is probably the same as the present enzyme. de Jong et al. (11de Jong J.G. van den Bosch H. Rijken D. van Deenen L.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 369: 50-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) reported the purification of a large form lysophospholipase called lysophospholipase II with a molecular mass of 60 kDa from bovine liver. The bovine enzyme was shown to be localized in the microsomal fraction (68van den Bosch H. de Jong J.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 398: 244-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To examine the relationship of 60-kDa lysophospholipase to the enzyme of de Jong et al. (11de Jong J.G. van den Bosch H. Rijken D. van Deenen L.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 369: 50-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), we performed Western blot analysis of rat liver microsomes using the antibody against the 60-kDa enzyme. The antibody recognized a 60-kDa protein in microsomes. Furthermore, we could solubilize lysophospholipase-transacylase activity with Triton X-100 and purify it by a procedure similar to that used for the enzyme in the soluble fraction. 2H. Sugimoto, unpublished results. Moreover, lysophospholipase II catalyzed the deacetylation of PAF (28Aarsman A.J. Neys F.W. Van den Bosch H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and the 60-kDa enzyme also exhibited the same activity. Thus, lysophospholipase II described by de Jong et al. (11de Jong J.G. van den Bosch H. Rijken D. van Deenen L.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 369: 50-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and the 60-kDa enzyme reported here are very likely the same enzyme. The only difference reported between lysophospholipase II and the 60-kDa enzyme is that the former was reported to be deficient in transacylase activity, but this could be due to the different conditions used for transacylase assay,e.g. pH of the reaction mixture. Lysophospholipase-transacylase was also purified from other sources, such as heart (24Gross R.W. Drisdel R.C. Sobel B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 15165-15172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and lung (26Brumley G. van den Bosch H. J. Lipid Res. 1977; 18: 523-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), clearly showing that heart and lung are rich sources of large form lysophospholipase. However, as shown above, the transcript encoding hepatic 60-kDa lysophospholipase could not be detected in heart and lung. These results are consistent with the view that a different isoform of large form lysophospholipase is present in heart and lung.An interesting feature of 60-kDa lysophospholipase is that it contains the ankyrin repeat in the C-terminal region. Various forms of the ankyrin repeat have been found in many proteins involved in tissue differentiation and cell cycle control. However, the motif was recently shown to be also contained in a class of phospholipase, calcium-independent phospholipase A2 (6Tang J. Kriz R.W. Wolfman N. Shaffer M. Seehra J. Jones S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8567-8575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The enzyme activity was shown to be lost when the ankyrin repeat was deleted, although the active site of the enzyme still remained (6Tang J. Kriz R.W. Wolfman N. Shaffer M. Seehra J. Jones S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8567-8575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The ankyrin repeat is often regarded as a motif for protein-protein interaction (69Lux S.E. John K.M. Bennett V. Nature. 1990; 344: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), and the ankyrin repeat in calcium-independent phospholipase A2 was proposed to be involved in enzyme activity through oligomeric complex formation. 60-kDa lysophospholipase contains not only the ankyrin repeat but also leucine zipper motif. Probably, the enzyme exists in a complexed form with some other protein that may regulate the activities of the enzyme. Identification and characterization of such a binding protein would provide a useful information on the regulation and physiological function of 60-kDa lysophospholipase. This paper reports the initial cloning of large form lysophospholipase in mammalian tissues. The sequence bears little sequence similarity to that of small form lysophospholipase (12Sugimoto H.

The enzyme activity was shown to be lost when the ankyrin repeat was deleted, although the active site of the enzyme still remained (6Tang J. Kriz R.W. Wolfman N. Shaffer M. Seehra J. Jones S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8567-8575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The ankyrin repeat is often regarded as a motif for protein-protein interaction (69Lux S.E. John K.M. Bennett V. Nature. 1990; 344: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), and the ankyrin repeat in calcium-independent phospholipase A2 was proposed to be involved in enzyme activity through oligomeric complex formation. 60-kDa lysophospholipase contains not only the ankyrin repeat but also leucine zipper motif. Probably, the enzyme exists in a complexed form with some other protein that may regulate the activities of the enzyme. Identification and characterization of such a binding protein would provide a useful information on the regulation and physiological function of 60-kDa lysophospholipase.

https://openalex.org/W1518210230,"The erythroleukemic cell line K562 can undergo further differentiation in erythroid or megakaryocytic lineage depending on the nature of the stimulus. Phorbol ester (PMA) stimulates megakaryocytic development whereas hemin promotes erythroid differentiation of these cells. We have examined the effect of PMA and hemin on the expression of the Kell blood group and CD10 antigens, two related proteins that belong to a family of membrane-bound neutral metalloendopeptidases. We show here that differentiation of K562 cells by PMA in the megakaryocytic lineage results in abolishment of Kell mRNA accumulation and protein expression and, in parallel, the induction of CD10 mRNA accumulation, protein expression, and enzymatic activity. Conversely, differentiation of these cells by hemin in the erythroid lineage is accompanied by an up-regulation of Kell mRNA and protein expression, with no changes in CD10 mRNA and protein expression. Thus, CD10 and Kell can be regarded as specific markers of the differentiation of K562 cells in the megakaryocytic and erythroid lineages, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2088669429,"A human RNA polymerase II (pol II) complex was isolated from a HeLa-derived cell line that conditionally expresses an epitope-tagged RPB9 subunit of human pol II. The isolated FLAG-tagged pol II complex (f:pol II) contains a subset of general transcription factors but is devoid of TFIID and TFIIA. In conjunction with TATA-binding protein (TBP) or TFIID, f:pol II is able to mediate both basal and activated transcription by Gal4-VP16 when a transcriptional coactivator PC4 is also provided. Interestingly, PC4, in the absence of a transcriptional activator, actually functions as a repressor to inhibit basal transcription. Remarkably, TBP is able to mediate activator function in this transcription system. The presence of TBP-associated factors, however, helps overcome PC4 repression and further enhance the level of activation mediated by TBP. Alleviation of PC4 repression can also be achieved by preincubation of the transcriptional components with the DNA template. Sarkosyl disruption of preinitiation complex formation further illustrates that PC4 can only inhibit transcription prior to the assembly of a functional preinitiation complex. These results suggest that PC4 represses basal transcription by preventing the assembly of a functional preinitiation complex, but it has no effect on the later steps of the transcriptional process.

In eukaryotes, transcription of protein-encoding genes requires general transcription factors (GTFs) 1The abbreviations used are: GTF, general transcription factor; pol, polymerase; PC4, positive cofactor 4; SRB, suppressor of RNA polymerase B; TBP, TATA-binding protein; TAF, TBP-associated factor; TFIID, transcription factor IID; f:pol II, a FLAG-tagged RNA polymerase II complex; USA, upstream stimulatory activity; PIC, preinitiation complex; ss, single-stranded; HSSB, human single-stranded DNA-binding protein.1The abbreviations used are: GTF, general transcription factor; pol, polymerase; PC4, positive cofactor 4; SRB, suppressor of RNA polymerase B; TBP, TATA-binding protein; TAF, TBP-associated factor; TFIID, transcription factor IID; f:pol II, a FLAG-tagged RNA polymerase II complex; USA, upstream stimulatory activity; PIC, preinitiation complex; ss, single-stranded; HSSB, human single-stranded DNA-binding protein. and RNA polymerase II (pol II), which are assembled on the promoter region to form a preinitiation complex (PIC) capable of producing RNAs when both ribonucleoside triphosphates and energy sources are provided (1Roeder R.G.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2657-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar).In vivo, the PIC assembly is a rate-limiting step for the initiation of transcription and is often facilitated by gene-specific transcriptional activators (3Struhl K.

Currently, there are two proposed pathways for the PIC assembly on TATA-containing promoters. In the sequential pathway, TFIID binding to the TATA box is followed, in a stepwise fashion, by the joining of TFIIB, pol II/TFIIF, TFIIE, and TFIIH, whereas in the two-component pathway, binding of TFIID is accompanied by a preassembled pol II complex that contains pol II, a subset of GTFs, SRBs (suppressors of RNA polymerase B mutations (5Koleske A.J.

Transcriptional activators, in most cases, are able to increase the level of initiation by enhancing the recruitment of TFIID and/or other components of the basal transcription machinery to the promoter region (3Struhl K. Cell. 1996; 84: 179-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 4Ptashne M. Gann A. Nature. 1997; 386: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). This activation process often requires transcriptional coactivators. Thus far, two major classes of general coactivators required for activator function have been identified in mammalian cell-free transcription systems. One is TBP-associated factors (TAFs) in TFIID (14Burley S.K. Roeder R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 769-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 15Verrijzer C.P. Tjian R. Trends Biochem.

Cell. 1997; 88: 729-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and the other is protein cofactors derived from the upstream stimulatory activity (USA) found in the phosphocellulose P11 0.85 m KCl fraction of HeLa nuclear extracts (17Meisterernst M. Roy A.L. Lieu H.M. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1991; 66: 981-993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 18Kaiser K. Meisterernst M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 342-345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Positive cofactor 4 (PC4) was isolated from a crude USA fraction and was able to substitute for USA to mediate activator-dependent transcription in vitro(19Ge H. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1994; 78: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 20Kretzschmar M. Kaiser K. Lottspeich F. Meisterernst M.

PC4 is a nonspecific DNA-binding protein, which shows a higher affinity toward single-stranded (ss) DNA molecule (20Kretzschmar M. Kaiser K. Lottspeich F. Meisterernst M. Cell. 1994; 78: 525-534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 21Kaiser K. Stelzer G. Meisterernst M.

The ssDNA binding activity of PC4 can replace human ssDNA-binding protein (HSSB, also called replication protein A (RPA)) in supporting the T antigen-catalyzed unwinding of SV40 origin-containing duplex DNA (23Pan Z.-Q. Ge H. Amin A.A. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22111-22116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, PC4 cannot substitute for HSSB in other aspects of replication activities mediated by HSSB (23Pan Z.-Q. Ge H. Amin A.A. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22111-22116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Likewise, the transcriptional activity of PC4 cannot be replaced by other ssDNA-binding proteins (19Ge H. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1994; 78: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The coactivator function of PC4 seems to correlate with its double-stranded DNA binding activity (21Kaiser K. Stelzer G. Meisterernst M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3520-3527Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and its interactions with transcriptional activators and with components of the general transcription machinery such as TFIIA (19Ge H. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1994; 78: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, gene inactivation of a PC4 homologue in yeast does not lead to cell death, indicating that PC4 is nonessential in yeast (24Knaus R. Pollock R. Guarente L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1933-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 25Henry N.L. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21842-21847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Since yeast PC4 also exhibits distinct properties from that of human PC4 (24Knaus R. Pollock R. Guarente L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1933-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 25Henry N.L. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21842-21847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), it is likely that PC4 may function differentially in various organisms. This remains to be further investigated. Using an in vitro transcription system reconstituted with either TBP or TFIID and a preassembled pol II complex, we found that PC4 could function as a repressor to suppress basal transcription in the absence of an activator. Interestingly, TBP was able to mediate Gal4-VP16 activation in the absence of TAFs. This finding suggests that human TBP can indeed mediate activator function, as observed in the yeast system (26Walker S.S. Reese J.C. Apone L.M. Green M.R. Nature. 1996; 383: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 27Moqtaderi Z. Bai Y. Poon D. Weil P.A. Struhl K.

To understand the molecular mechanism of PC4 repression, we carried out template challenge and Sarkosyl disruption experiments using our two-component transcription system. The results indicate that PC4 represses transcription by preventing the assembly of a functional preinitiation complex when an activator is not present. A tetracycline-regulated human RPB9-expressing plasmid, pTetCMV-Fo:hRPB9, was first constructed by cloning the RPB9 cDNA (29Acker J. Wintzerith M. Vigneron M. Kedinger C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5345-5350Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), isolated from pBn-Fo:14.5 (provided by H. Ge) between NdeI andXbaI sites, to pTetCMV-Fo(AS) (30Wu S.-Y. Chiang C.-M. BioTechniques. 1996; 21: 718-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) at the same enzyme-cutting sites. The expression plasmid, pF:TFIIA(55)-11d, was made by transferring the p55 insert from pET11aN1–376 (31DeJong J. Roeder R.G. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2220-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) into pF:TBP-11d (32Chiang C.-M. Roeder R.G. Peptide Res. 1993; 6: 62-64PubMed Google Scholar) after removing the TBP insert between NdeI and EcoRI sites. Similarly, plasmids pF:TFIIA(1–274)-11d, pF:TFIIA(275–376), and pF:TFIIAγ(hp12) were constructed by swapping individual TFIIA inserts from pJD1–274, pJDGEX2t(L)275–376, and pGEX2t(L)hp12 (33DeJong J. Bernstein R. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3313-3317Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) with the TBP insert from pF:TBP-11d betweenNdeI and BamHI sites. Ten μg of PvuI-linearized pTetCMV-Fo:hRPB9 DNA was cotransfected with 50 μg of sheared calf thymus DNA and with 0.5 μg of SacI-linearized pREP4 (Invitrogen) into HtTA-1 (34Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4213) Google Scholar), a HeLa-derived cell line that constitutively expresses a tetracycline-controlled transactivator. Detailed procedures for establishing the tetracycline-regulated clonal cell lines had been described (30Wu S.-Y. Chiang C.-M. BioTechniques. 1996; 21: 718-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). A cell line (hRPB9–3) that showed induced expression of FLAG-tagged hRPB9 in the absence of tetracycline was isolated after screening a dozen hygromycin-resistant cellular clones. To detect the presence of individual GTFs as shown in Fig. 1 A, 50 μl of HeLa nuclear extracts and 200 μl of f:pol II were mixed separately with an equal volume of the 2× protein sample buffer. The protein mixture was then separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using a preparative mini-gel apparatus (Bio-Rad). After transfer to the nitrocellulose filters, samples were divided into multiple lanes using a Mini-Protean II multiscreen apparatus (Bio-Rad). Each sample lane was then incubated with a primary antibody, usually diluted 1000-fold unless otherwise specified, in a final volume of 600 μl. The rest of the procedures for Western blotting were performed as described (30Wu S.-Y. Chiang C.-M. BioTechniques. 1996; 21: 718-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The f:pol II complex was purified from hRPB9–3 as follows. The hRPB9–3 cell line was maintained in suspension culture with Joklik medium containing 5% calf serum in the presence of tetracycline (1 μg/ml) and selected with G418 (0.6 mg/ml, total weight) for 4 days before expansion for the preparation of nuclear extracts and S100. To induce protein expression, cells were pelleted and washed at least 3 times with 1× phosphate-buffered saline to remove tetracycline. Cells were then resuspended in fresh Joklik medium plus 5% calf serum. Nuclear extracts and S100 were prepared from hRPB9–3 cells, 4 days after removing tetracycline, as described (35Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9131) Google Scholar). To purify f:pol II, 10 ml of the hRPB9–3 nuclear extract or S100 was incubated with 250–500 μl of anti-FLAG M2-agarose beads (Kodak) at 4 °C for 6–12 h. Bound proteins were then washed and eluted with the synthetic FLAG peptide with 100 mm KCl-containing buffer as described previously for TFIID purification (36Chiang C.-M. Ge H. Wang Z. Hoffmann A. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2749-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Recombinant PC4 was purified from bacteria harboring pET11a/PC4, obtained from H. Ge, as described (37Ge H. Martinez E. Chiang C.-M. Roeder R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 274: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Purification of recombinant FLAG-tagged basal transcription factors including TFIIA (p55, p35, p19, and p12), TFIIB, TBP, TFIIEα, and TFIIEβ was performed as described previously (32Chiang C.-M. Roeder R.G. Peptide Res. 1993; 6: 62-64PubMed Google Scholar). TFIIA and TFIIF were then reconstituted from individually purified components following denaturation and renaturation. Typically, equal molar amounts of individual TFIIA (p55 and p12) or TFIIF (RAP30 and RAP74) subunits were mixed and adjusted to 6 m guanidine hydrochloride in BC100 (36Chiang C.-M. Ge H. Wang Z. Hoffmann A. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2749-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The mixture was incubated at room temperature for an hour and then sequentially dialyzed for 2 h each against 60 volumes of 2, 0.5, and 0.1m guanidine hydrochloride in BC100 and eventually against BC100. After centrifugation, the reconstituted proteins were dispensed into small aliquots and stored at −80 °C. Purification of FLAG-tagged TFIID (36Chiang C.-M. Ge H. Wang Z. Hoffmann A. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2749-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), core-pol II (38Reinberg D. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3310-3321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Gal4-VP16 (39Chasman D.I. Leatherwood J. Carey M. Ptashne M. Kornberg R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4746-4749Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), and FLAG-tagged Gal4 fusion proteins (40Chiang C.-M. Roeder R.G. Science. 1995; 267: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) was performed as described. FLAG-tagged TFIIH was purified from S100 derived from a tetracycline-regulated cell line that conditionally expresses the FLAG-tagged p62 subunit of human TFIIH (30Wu S.-Y. Chiang C.-M. BioTechniques. 1996; 21: 718-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) following the procedure described for f:pol II purification. Recombinant histidine-tagged RAP30 and histidine-tagged RAP74 were purified from bacteria containing pET23d/RAP30 (41Fang S.M. Burton Z.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11703-11709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and pET23d/RAP74NspV (42Wang Q. Lei L. Burton Z.F. Protein Expression Purif. 1994; 5: 476-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), respectively, following the published protocols (43Wang Q. Kostrub C.F. Finkelstein A. Burton Z.F. Protein Expression Purif. 1993; 4: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In vitro transcription was typically carried out in a 25-μl reaction mixture containing 50 ng of pG5HMC2AT, 20 ng of pMLΔ53, 42 ng of renatured TFIIA (35 ng of p55 and 7 ng of p12), 10 ng of TFIIB, 10 ng of TBP, or 1 μl of FLAG-tagged TFIID (which contains approximately 1 ng of TBP as judged by Western blotting), 20 ng each of TFIIEα and TFIIEβ, 28 ng of renatured TFIIF (20 ng of RAP74 and 8 ng of RAP30), 1 μl (∼7.5 ng) of FLAG-tagged TFIIH, and 0.6 μl (∼18 ng) of core-pol II or f:pol II using the conditions as described previously (17Meisterernst M. Roy A.L. Lieu H.M. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1991; 66: 981-993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). For activator-dependent transcription, 100 ng of PC4 and 50 ng of Gal4-VP16 were also included as specified. In the minimal transcription system, 3 μl (∼90 ng) of f:pol II was used in conjunction with either 2 ng of TBP or 2 μl of FLAG-tagged TFIID. The amount of FLAG-tagged Gal4 fusion proteins used in the minimal transcription reaction was: 3 ng of Gal4 (1–94), 6 ng of Gal4-Pro, 6 ng of Gal4-Gln, and 30 ng of Gal4 (1–147). Reactions were then performed and analyzed as described (36Chiang C.-M. Ge H. Wang Z. Hoffmann A. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2749-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). A two-step incubation procedure described by Kaiser et al. (21Kaiser K. Stelzer G. Meisterernst M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3520-3527Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) was used with a minor modification. Briefly, 50 ng of pG5HMC2AT and 20 ng of pMLΔ53 were preincubated with either 2 μl of FLAG-tagged TFIID (or 2 ng of TBP) or 3 μl of f:pol II at 30 °C for 50 min. Ribonucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) and the other component required for transcription (f:pol II or TFIID or TBP) were added after the preincubation period to initiate transcription. Reactions were continued at 30 °C for 60 min and then analyzed for RNA formation (36Chiang C.-M. Ge H. Wang Z. Hoffmann A. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2749-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Gal4-VP16 and PC4, when added, were used at 50 and 100 ng, respectively. The challenge template (500 ng of pG5HMC2AT or 500 ng of pMLΔ53) was included either at the beginning or at the end of the preincubation period as depicted in Fig. 3 A. In this experiment, 0.015% Sarkosyl was added either at the beginning or at the end of the preincubation period, which was performed in the presence of TBP, f:pol II, and both pG5HMC2AT and pMLΔ53 DNA templates as described in the template challenge experiments. Ribonucleoside triphosphates were then added to initiate transcription. One hundred nanograms of PC4 were added at various time points as outlined at the bottom of Fig. 4. A human pol II complex was purified from a clonal HeLa-derived cell line (hRPB9–3) that conditionally expresses the FLAG-tagged RPB9 subunit of human pol II (see “Experimental Procedures”). The purified FLAG-tagged pol II complex (f:pol II) contains not only pol II subunits as detected by Western blotting with antibodies against RPB1, RPB2, RPB6, RPB8, and RPB9 2S.-Y. Wu and C.-M. Chiang, unpublished data. but also a subset of GTFs including TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH (Fig.1 A). The f:pol II complex contains stoichiometric amounts of TFIIB and TFIIF but substoichiometric quantities of TFIIE and TFIIH (Fig. 1 A, compare relative signals detected in nuclear extracts and f:pol II), as also evidenced by quantitative Western blotting using purified recombinant proteins as standards. 3The f:pol II complex contains approximately 50 fmol μl−1 of pol II subunits, 70 fmol μl−1 of TFIIB, 135 fmol μl−1 of TFIIF, 1.2 fmol μl−1 of TFIIE, and 3.2 fmol μl−1of TFIIH. TFIID and TFIIA were not detected in f:pol II at a sensitivity of 1 ng with anti-TBP and anti-TAFII55 antibodies and at a sensitivity of 0.1 ng with anti-TFIIA p35 antibodies (Fig. 1 A).2 Our f:pol II, enriched approximately 200-fold after immunoaffinity purification, did not seem to contain other transcriptional cofactors such as PC4 and Dr1 and transcriptional activators including Sp1, YY1, USF, p53, pRB, and the p50 subunit of NFkB.2 Recombinant human TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, and FLAG-tagged TFIID and FLAG-tagged TFIIH were used in conjunction with either core-pol II (i.e. traditionally defined pol II) or immunoaffinity-purified f:pol II for transcriptional analysis. Both core-pol II and f:pol II, normalized by the content of RPB2 in the purified complexes, showed comparable levels of transcriptional activities irrespective of whether TBP or TFIID was used as the TATA-binding factor (Fig. 1 B, top andbottom panels, lanes 1 and9). The pG5HMC2AT template contains 5 Gal4-binding sites preceding the HIV-1 TATA box and the adenovirus major late (ML) initiator element in front of a G-less cassette of approximately 380 nucleotides, whereas pMLΔ53, which lacks the activator-binding sites, has a shorter G-less cassette (∼280 nucleotides) driven only by the major late promoter TATA and initiator elements. In our transcription system, TFIIB, TFIIF, and a TATA binding activity (either TBP or TFIID) were essential for transcription by core-pol II (Fig. 1 B, lanes 3, 4, and6), whereas TFIIE and TFIIH, although not necessary for transcription from supercoiled DNA templates (44Goodrich J.A. Tjian R. Cell. 1994; 77: 145-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 45Parvin J.D. Shykind B.M. Meyers R.E. Kim J. Sharp P.A. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 391-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 B, lanes 5 and 7), are required for transcription from linearized DNA molecules.2Interestingly, transcription from different promoter elements seem to require differential amounts of TFIIE and TFIIH, as leaving out TFIIE and TFIIH affected transcription from pG5HMC2AT more dramatically than from pMLΔ53 (Fig. 1 B, lanes5 and 7). In contrast, transcription by f:pol II required only a TATA-binding factor (Fig. 1 B, lanes 9–16), although leaving out TFIIE significantly reduced basal transcription from both DNA templates. The transcription data not only functionally confirm the identities of GTFs detected in our purified f:pol II (Fig. 1, A and B) but further suggest that a two-component pathway comprised of preassembled f:pol II and a TATA-binding factor is probably sufficient for the assembly of a functional preinitiation complex (see below). Obviously, TFIIA and TAFs were not needed for basal transcription from either DNA template (Fig.1 B, compare top and bottom panels, lanes 1 versus 2 and lanes 9 versus 10). We also examined the factor requirement for activator-dependent transcription in our highly purifiedin vitro transcription system. All GTFs, except TFIIA, were necessary, in conjunction with a transcriptional activator (Gal4-VP16) and a coactivator (PC4), for activated transcription by core-pol II (Fig. 1 C, lanes 1–10). In contrast, f:pol II only requires TFIID, PC4, and Gal4-VP16 for activated transcription from pG5HMC2AT (Fig. 1 C, lanes 11–20). Again, leaving out TFIIE and TFIIH showed some effect on activated transcription by f:pol II, reflecting their substoichiometric amounts in purified f:pol II (Fig. 1 A). Apparently, TFIIA was not required for activated transcription by either core-pol II or f:pol II in this highly purified in vitro transcription system (Fig. 1 C, compare lanes 1 and2 with lanes 11 and 12). Presumably TFIIA is only needed to antagonize the repressive effect from some negative factors that may be present in cruder systems (2Orphanides G. Lagrange T. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2657-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). Indeed, we have found that TFIIA becomes essential whenever a partially purified E/F/H or USA fraction is used in the transcription assay. 4S.-Y. Wu, E. Kershnar, and C.-M. Chiang, manuscript in preparation. In addition, the requirement for TFIIA can be affected by the amount of TFIID and the promoter structure of the DNA templates used in the reaction (47Lieberman P.M. Ozer J. Gürsel D.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6624-6632Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, this analysis indicates that, in addition to f:pol II and TFIID, a transcriptional activator (Gal4-VP16) and a coactivator such as PC4 were minimally required for activated transcription in vitro. To investigate the role of TBP and TAFs in activator-dependent transcription, we compared in parallel the transcriptional activities of TBP and TFIID in a transcription system comprised of f:pol II, TBP or TFIID, PC4, and Gal4-VP16. In this assay, TFIID was the only source of TAFs, which were not found in f:pol II as judged by Western blotting (Fig. 1 A) and transcriptional assays (Fig. 1 B, lanes 12 inupper and lower panels, and Fig. 1 C,lane 14). As expected, no transcription could be detected in the absence of a TATA binding activity provided by either TBP or TFIID (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1and 6). When TBP or TFIID, containing an equivalent amount of TBP, was also included, basal transcription could be detected from both pG5HMC2AT and pMLΔ53 DNA templates (Fig.2 A, lanes 2 and 7). If Gal4-VP16 was added to the system without PC4, only minor if any enhancement of transcription was observed (Fig. 2 A, compare lanes 2 and 3, and 7 and 8), confirming the importance of additional cofactors other than TAFs in mediating activator function (17Meisterernst M. Roy A.L. Lieu H.M. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1991; 66: 981-993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 36Chiang C.-M. Ge H. Wang Z. Hoffmann A. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2749-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the coactivator PC4 in the absence of an activator acts as a repressor to suppress basal transcription mediated by TBP (Fig. 2 A, compare lanes 2 and 4). PC4 repression was not obvious in the case of TFIID (Fig. 2 A, compare lanes 7 and9), indicating that TAFs can overcome PC4 repression. Surprisingly, when Gal4-VP16 was also provided, we observed transcriptional activation mediated by both TBP and TFIID (Fig.2 A, compare lanes 2 and 5, and7 and 10). These data suggest that human TBP, in the absence of TFIID TAFs, can also mediate transcriptional activation in a mammalian cell-free transcription system, as previously shown in yeast (5Koleske A.J. Young R.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). The presence of TAFs, however, help overcome PC4 repression and further enhance the level of activation mediated by TBP (Fig.2 A, compare lanes 7 and 9, and7 and 10). To see if TBP- and TFIID-mediated activation was unique to the acidic type of activation domains as exemplified by Gal4-VP16, we also tested the ability of other Gal4 fusion proteins in activating transcription in our minimal transcription system. Both Gal4-Pro and Gal4-Gln, which contain proline-rich and glutamine-rich activation domains linked, respectively, to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain, were able to activate transcription mediated by TBP, mainly at the level of antirepression (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1–4). In contrast, Gal4-(1–94), which was the portion us"

In addition, heat treatment is known to affect ion transport mechanisms associated with vital cellular processes, including cell volume regulation. However, there has been no reports to date of a heat shock effect on cellular volume regulation itself. The aim of our study was to investigate whether the heat shock response influences volume regulation of cells. Human promonocytic U937 cells display an increase in volume in response to osmotic shrinkage. This regulatory volume increase (RVI) is mediated mainly by ion antiporters. U937 cells exposed to a temperature of 45°C for 10 min (heat shock) show an enhancement of RVI after hypertonic challenge compared with untreated cells. Also, heat-treated cells display a lower intracellular pH (pHi) than untreated cells; similar control mechanisms are believed to be involved in regulating both pHi and RVI. In agreement with this, heat-shocked cells demonstrated increased activity of an HCO3−-independent/DIDS-sensitive pHi down-regulator, postulated to be a Cl−/HCO3− exchange. We suggest that heat shock-mediated RVI enhancement is at least partially mediated by an increased Cl−/HCO3− exchange. Our results indicate that heat shock of U937 cells activates a hitherto unknown cytoprotective effect that may help cells to overcome hypertonic challenge."

Neurofilaments (NFs) 1The abbreviations used are: NF, neurofilament(s); NF-L, light NF subunit; NF-M, midsized NF subunit; NF-H, heavy NF subunit; 3′-CR, 3′-coding region; 3′-UTR, 3′-untranslated region; RNP, ribonucleoprotein; nt, nucleotide(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; oligo, oligonucleotide; ARE, adenylate/uridylate-rich element(s).1The abbreviations used are: NF, neurofilament(s); NF-L, light NF subunit; NF-M, midsized NF subunit; NF-H, heavy NF subunit; 3′-CR, 3′-coding region; 3′-UTR, 3′-untranslated region; RNP, ribonucleoprotein; nt, nucleotide(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; oligo, oligonucleotide; ARE, adenylate/uridylate-rich element(s).are the principle constituent of the axonal cytoskeleton, so that levels of NF expression are believed to be a major determinant of axonal size. This view is supported by the simultaneous up-regulation of the light (NF-L), midsized (NF-M), and heavy (NF-H) NF subunit mRNAs (2Schlaepfer W.W. Bruce J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1990; 25: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) that accompanies the enlargement and myelination of axons during postnatal development of the nervous system (3Muma N. Slunt H.H. Hoffman P.N. J. Neurocytol. 1991; 20: 844-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The postnatal surge in NF expression is a posttranscriptional event (4Moskowitz P.F. Oblinger M.M. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 30: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) that is mediated in part by stabilization of NF mRNAs (5Schwartz M.L. Shneidman P.S. Bruce J. Schlaepfer W.W. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 27: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The extent of axonal enlargement, and presumably the levels of NF up-regulation, are determined by the nature of target cell innervations and can be reconstituted in transected nerve upon successful reinnervation of the target site (6Gutmann E. Sanders F.E. J. Physiol. 1943; 101: 489-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Moreover, the stability of NF mRNAs becomes dependent upon continuity of axons with target sites in that the transcripts are destabilized upon nerve transection or excision and transfer of parent neurons to primary culture (7Schwartz M.L. Shneidman P.S. Bruce J. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24596-24600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, NF mRNAs are stabilized during the same postnatal interval in which neurons acquire the ability to survive nerve transection and mount a regenerative response (8Schwartz M.L. Shneidman P.S. Bruce J. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Neurosci. Res. 1990; 27: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The overlapping appearance of these phenomena raises the possibility that common components of posttranscriptional pathways regulate neuronal homeostasis and levels of NF expression. If so, then titration of regulatory components could account for: (i) the motoneuron degeneration in transgenic mice upon overexpression of a wild-type NF-L (9Xu Z. Cork L.C. Griffin J.W. Cleveland D.W. Cell. 1993; 73: 23-33Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar) or NF-H (10Cote F. Collard J.F. Julien J.P. Cell. 1993; 73: 35-46Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar) transgene or modest expression of a mutant NF-L transgene (11Lee M.K. Marszalek J.R. Cleveland D.W. Neuron. 1994; 13: 975-988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), (ii) the preferential degeneration of NF-enriched neurons in mice bearing a mutant SOD-1 transgene (12Morrison B.M. Gordon J.W. Ripps M.E. Morrison J.H. J. Comp. Neurol. 1996; 373: 617-631Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and (iii) the transient up-regulation of NF mRNA that precedes the spontaneous motoneuron in Wobbler mice (13Pernas-Alonso R. Schaffner A.E. Perrone-Capano C. Orlando A. Morelli F. Hansen D.T. Barker J.L. Esposito B. Cacucci R. diPorzio U. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 38: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Mechanisms regulating levels of NF expression may therefore bear an important relationship to neurodegenerative states. We have begun to map stability determinants that regulate steady-state levels of NF-L mRNA. Deletion of the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) from a mouse NF-L transgene stabilizes the NF-L transcript in neuronal cell lines and alters the developmental up-regulation and axotomy-induced down-regulation of the transgene in transgenic mice (14Schwartz M.L. Bruce J. Shneidman P.S. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26364-26369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). More recently, we have begun to apply an expression system with tetracycline-regulated promoter to map stability determinants in NF mRNAs. In a companion study (1Cañete-Soler R. Schwartz M.L. Hua Y. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12650-12654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), we demonstrate the presence of stability determinants in the 3′-coding region (3′-CR) and 3′-UTR of NF-L mRNA and have localized a stabilizing element at the junction of 3′-CR and 3′-UTR that may account for the stabilizing properties of the transcript. The present study examines the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes that assemble on NF-L mRNA when nascent radioactive fragments of the transcript are incubated with cytosolic brain extracts. The RNP complexes have been characterized by their abilities to be competed with homoribopolymers, thereby taking advantage of the high affinity and selective binding of many RNA-binding proteins for specific homoribopolymers (15Swanson M.S. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2237-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). A similar approach has been very helpful in characterizing RNP complexes that are believed to stabilize α-globin mRNA (16Wang X. Kiledjian M. Weiss I.M. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1769-1777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Wang X. Liebhaber S.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5040-5051Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The goal of the present study is to correlate biochemical with functional studies (1Cañete-Soler R. Schwartz M.L. Hua Y. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12650-12654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and thereby develop a working model for elucidating the mechanisms that regulate the stability of the mouse NF-L transcript. Rat brain and liver (10–15 g) were minced, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer with two volumes of 50 mm potassium acetate, 3 mm magnesium acetate, and 2 mm dithiothreitol in 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4 (Buffer A), and a mixture of protease inhibitors (18Schwartz M.L. Katagi C. Bruce J. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13444-13450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Crude supernatant from a microcentrifuge spin (10,000 × gfor 10 min) was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min, yielding cytosolic extracts with 7–9 or 15–20 mg/ml protein from brain and liver, respectively. Glycerol (5%) was added, and the extracts were aliquoted, snap-frozen, and stored at −80 °C. All operations were conducted on ice or at 4 °C. Multiple dishes (>108 cells) of confluent P19, N2a, or L cells, originally obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, detached with a scraper, pelleted in a clinical centrifuge (1,000 × gfor 5 min), and homogenized in a Dounce homogenized with two volumes of Buffer A containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Crude supernatants from a microcentrifuge spin (10,000 × g for 10 min) were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min, yielding cytosolic extracts (protein of 5–8 mg/ml). Extracts were admixed with glycerol, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. Some extracts were also concentrated 3-fold in a Centricon-10 (Amicon Corp.). Templates for RNA probes (Fig. 1) were prepared by PCR with restriction sites or a T7 promoter sequence in the primers to facilitate cloning or to generate RNA products directly from PCR templates. The parent A680 template (+1482/+2161) was cloned into HindIII/BamHI sites of the pBluescript II SK+ vector (Stratagene) and was cut withBamHI (at +2161), HincII (at +1779), orBspMI (at +1712) to yield the full-length A680 template (+1482/+2161), the A680/H template (+1482/+1779), or the A680/B template (+1482/+1712). The SalI (and HincII) site in the polylinker was mutated to preserve the continuity of T7 promoter sequence with the A680/H template. The A680/del template was generated by a second PCR reactions that fused upstream and downstream PCR products with sequence between +1712 and +1779 deleted. Probes 1–5 were cloned into the SK+ vector, and probes A, B, and X were generated off PCR templates. Templates were sequenced to confirm junctional and mutational sites. RNA probes were uniformly labeled with [32P]UTP using T7 polymerase (7Schwartz M.L. Shneidman P.S. Bruce J. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24596-24600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Full-length probes were excised from denaturing acrylamide gels, eluted overnight into 0.5 mNH4 acetate, 0.1% SDS, and 1 mm EDTA, and ethanol-precipitated. Probes were diluted to 2.5 × 104 cpm/μl in Buffer A immediately prior to use. Homoribonucleotides (Sigma) and antisense oligonucleotides were solubilized in Buffer A. Radioactive probes (5 × 104 cpm), cytosolic extract (120 μg), and varying amounts of homoribonucleotides or antisense oligonucleotides were incubated for 30 min at 20 °C in 20 μl, digested for 10 min with 2 units of RNase T1 (Sigma), dissociated with heparin (5 mg/ml), and electrophoresed on a 5% acrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris-borate-EDTA buffer. Dried gels were subjected to autoradiography. For cross-linking analyses, the complexes were cross-linked on ice for 30 min at 3 cm distance underneath a UV light (4 × 106J/cm2) and further digested for 15 min at 20 °C with RNase T1 (10 units) or RNase A (10 μg). Radioactive cross-linked polypeptides were solubilized by boiling for 5 min in SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and identified by autoradiography of dried gels. Complex formations were compared on probes that were denatured at 95 °C for 2 min and rapidly or slowly cooled to 20 °C prior to the addition of extract. Probes were also heat-denatured with antisense oligonucleotide in excess of EDTA (5 mm) and incubated with RNase H (1 unit) for 20 min at 37 °C in excess magnesium (3 mm) prior to addition of extract. An NF-L mRNA probe (A680) that spans the entire 3′-UTR (427 nt) and distal 253 nt of 3′-CR (see Fig. 1) was used to identify binding factors and binding sites that could account for stability determinants in these regions of the transcript (1Cañete-Soler R. Schwartz M.L. Hua Y. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12650-12654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). When brain extracts were incubated with the radioactive A680 probe and electrophoresed on non-denaturing gels, multiple gel-shifted bands were detected (Fig.2, lane 3). These bands were characterized by their abilities to be competed by addition of increasing amounts of poly(C) (lanes 4–6), poly(U) (lanes 7–9), poly(A) (lanes 10–12), or poly(G) (lanes 13 and 14) homoribopolymers. A set of faster migrating bands (solid arrowheads) were competed by 20 ng of poly(C), but not by 100-fold higher concentrations of poly(G), poly(A), or poly(U). Similarly, a set of slower migrating bands (open arrowheads) were competed by 200 ng of poly(A) or poly(U), but not by 10-fold higher concentrations of poly(C) or poly(G). The faster migrating bands are referred to as the C-binding complex, whereas the slower migrating bands are referred to as the U/A-binding complex. Gel-shifted bands were not seen when the probes were incubated without extract (lane 1) or when the extract was treated with protease K (lane 2) or heated to 65 °C (data not shown). To localize binding sites, gel shift assays were conducted with probes that extended to varying distances into the 3′-UTR (Fig. 3). The C-binding complex (solid arrowheads) formed on the full-length A680 probe extending to +2161 (lanes 1–3), to a much lesser extent on probe A680/H extending to +1779 (lanes 4–8), but not on probe A680/B extending to +1712 (lanes 9–12) or on probe A680(del) in which sequence between +1712 and +1779 is deleted (lanes 13–15). Variations in relative intensities of gel-shifted bands of the U/A- and C-binding complexes occurred when examined with different probes. In addition, the C-binding complex was markedly enhanced on probe A680/H when U/A-binding complex was competed off with poly(U) or poly(A) (compare lanes 4 withlanes 6–8). The findings indicate that formation of the C-binding complex requires sequence between +1712 and +1779. This sequence comprises the distal 23 nt of 3′-CR (+1712/+1734) and the proximal 45 nt of 3′-UTR (+1735/1779). To confirm the location of the binding site for the C-binding complex, gel shift studies were conducted with probe A (+1712/+1779), which contained the 3′-CR and 3′-UTR components of the putative binding site, and with probe X (+1735/+1779), which contained only the 3′-UTR component of the binding site. Fig. 4shows that the C-binding complex (solid arrowhead) readily formed on probe A (lane 1), but not very well on probe X (lane 6). Upon prolonged exposures of autoradiograms, similar but markedly reduced amounts of C-binding complex can be identified on probe X (data not shown). Low (20 ng), medium (200 ng), and high (2000 ng) amounts of poly(C) competed the C-binding complex from probe A (lanes 2–4) and probe X (data not shown). Note that the addition of poly(C) not only abolished the C-binding complex but also enhanced the formation of the slow-migrating U/A-binding complex (open arrowhead) on probe A (lanes 2–4) and probe X (data not shown). Additional gel-shifted bands formed on probe A and, especially, on probe X, but were not competed with poly(C) or poly(U), and their relationship to the C- and U/A-binding complexes is unclear. Their presence does not obscure the principle finding,i.e. that the C-binding complex binds weakly to the proximal 45 nt of 3′-UTR and that this binding is markedly enhanced by the addition of upstream flanking sequence. Further evidence that 3′-CR is instrumental in the formation of the C-binding complex is seen in gel shift assays using a series of 5′-deletion probes extending from +2064 (probe 1), +1870 (probe 2), +1768 (probe 3), +1735 (probe 4), and +1519 (probe 5) to +2161 (see Fig. 1). Whereas probes 1–4 contained increasing amounts of 3′-UTR, only probe 5 extended beyond the 3′-UTR and into the 3′-CR. Fig.5 shows that addition of poly(C) abolished the set of fast-migrating gel-shifted bands (solid arrowheads) that formed on probe 5 (compare lanes 1 and3) but did not abolish the set of fast-migrating gel-shifted bands that formed on probe 4 (compare lanes 4 and6), probe 3 (compare lanes 7 and 9), probe 2 (compare lanes 10 and 12) or probe 1 (compare lanes 13 and 15). The ability to be competed away with poly(C) identifies the fast-migrating set of bands on probe 5 as the C-binding complex. This complex was also enhanced in the presence of poly(U) (compare lanes 1 and 2). Gel-shifted bands of similar migration also formed on probes 1–4, but were not competed with poly(C), so that their relationship to the C-binding complex is unclear. The findings provide additional evidence that formation of the C-binding complex is dependent upon sequences in the proximal 3′-UTR and distal 3′-CR. U/A-binding complexes are defined as sets of slow-migrating gel-shifted bands that are competed with poly(U) or poly(A). Fig. 5 shows that similar U/A-binding complexes (open arrowheads) were competed with poly(U) on probe 5 (lanes 1 and 2), probe 4 (lanes 4 and5), probe 3 (lanes 7 and 8), probe 2 (lanes 10 and 11), and probe 1 (lanes 13 and 14). Gel-shifted bands of U/A-binding complexes on probes 1–5 differed in their relative abundance. Likewise, similar gel-shifted bands in different proportions comprised the U/A-binding complex that formed on probes containing only 3′-CR sequence (A680/B), with the addition of proximal 3′-UTR (A680/H) or with the addition of the full 3′-UTR (A680) (see Fig. 3). U/A-binding complexes were also present on short probes (see Fig. 4) and were generally composed of fewer and fainter bands. Moreover, the U/A complexes were sometimes competed more effectively with poly(U) or poly(A), depending on the size and position of the probe. Finally, in many instances, competing off the U/A-binding complex with poly(U) or poly(A) enhanced the formation of the C-binding complex. We conclude that slow-migrating U/A-binding complexes of varying composition form at multiple sites in the 3′-CR and 3′-UTR of NF-L mRNA and that formation of U/A-binding complexes may adversely affect the formation of C-binding complexes. The sequence necessary for the formation of the C-binding complexes extends from +1712 to +1779 of the NF-L cDNA and spans the distal 23 nt of 3′-CR and proximal 45 nt of 3′-UTR, as follows. To assess specific sequence requirements for the formation of the C-binding complex, gel shift assays were conducted with brain extracts and probe A (+1712/+1779) that had been preincubated with 15-mer antisense oligonucleotides to the proximal (oligo P), middle (oligo M), or distal (oligo D) 3′-UTR sequence in probe A (as schematically shown above). Fig. 6 shows that formation of the C-binding complex was abolished by preincubation with antisense probes P or M and markedly reduced by antisense probe D. Preincubation with the same amounts (100 ng) of 15-mer oligos to sequence in the SK+ vector (oligo SK) or 5′-flanking region of NF-L (oligo 5′) did not affect the formation of C-binding complexes. The findings indicate that assembly of the C-binding complexes can be disrupted at multiple sites, thereby requiring an extended stretch of intact sequence in the proximal 3′-UTR that is enriched in cytosine and pyrimidine residues.Figure 6Gel shift assay of the C-binding complex (closed arrowheads) that forms when probe A is preincubated with 15-mer antisense oligonucleotides (100 ng) to the proximal (P), middle (M), or distal (D) sequence of the putative C-binding site and then incubated with brain extract in the presence of 0 (−) or 2000 (+++) ng of poly(C) or poly(U). Control 15-mer antisense oligonucleotides were from the SK+ vector (SK) and from the 5′-flanking sequence of NF-L (5′).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cytosolic extracts from neuronal (P19 and N2a) and non-neuronal (L cells) cell lines were tested in gel shift assays and were found to generate C-binding complexes (data not shown). Studies were then conducted to compare the C-binding complexes from neuronal (brain) and non-neuronal (liver) tissues. Fig.7 shows that very similar C-binding complexes formed when brain (lanes 3–8) or liver (lanes 9-14) extracts were gel-shifted with probe A. However, at least a 10-fold larger amount of C-binding complex formed with brain extracts, based upon radioactivity per microgram of protein in the cytosolic extract. Components of the C-binding and U/A-binding complexes were identified by UV cross-linking of the complexes that form on radioactive probes, then digested away the radioactive residues that are not cross-linked to protein and using the cross-linked radioactivity to detect polypeptides in autoradiograms after their separation by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. When polypeptides in rat brain extracts were cross-linked to probe B (+1670/+1779) and separated on a 15% acrylamide gel, polypeptides with migrational rates of 39- and 18-kDa were identified as components of the C-binding complexes (Fig. 8 A). Their association with the C-binding complexes was attributed to their ability to be competed with poly(C). The 39-kDa polypeptide was competed with low levels (20 ng), whereas loss of the 18-kDa polypeptide required higher levels (2000 ng) of poly(C). Cross-linking of the 18-kDa and, especially, the 39-kDa polypeptides was enhanced by the addition of poly(U). Digestion of the cross-linked complexes using RNase A (in addition to T1 nuclease) increased the migrational rate of the 39-kDa polypeptide to that of a 36-kDa polypeptide. Addition of poly(U) also competed away the cross-linking of an 80-kDa polypeptide. When polypeptides in brain extracts were cross-linked to probe A (+1712/+1779) and separated on a 10% gel (Fig. 8 B), 80- and 72-kDa polypeptides were competed away by the addition of poly(U) (compare lanes 2 and 4) and were slightly increased by the addition of poly(C) (compare lanes 2 and3). A 39-kDa polypeptide was competed away by the addition of poly(C) (compare lanes 2 and 3) and was slightly increased by the addition of poly(U) (compare lanes 2 and 4). The presence of an 18-kDa polypeptide (lane 2) and its ability to be competed by poly(C) (lane 3) and enhanced by poly(U) (lane 4) were obscured by the cross-linking of additional polypeptides that migrated in the 20–30-kDa range (compare lanes 1 and 2). The findings identify 18- and 36-kDa core polypeptide components of the C-binding complex and 80- and 72-kDa components of the U/A-binding complex. With this study, we have begun to identify the RNP binding factors and binding sites that regulate the stability of NF-L mRNA. Competition with homoribopolymers (15Swanson M.S. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2237-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 16Wang X. Kiledjian M. Weiss I.M. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1769-1777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Wang X. Liebhaber S.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5040-5051Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) has been very helpful in characterizing specific RNP components and in localizing their binding sites. In particular, the ability to be selectively competed with poly(C) has identified a prominent C-binding complex that binds to the proximal 3′-UTR of NF-L mRNA. In a companion study (1Cañete-Soler R. Schwartz M.L. Hua Y. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12650-12654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), we have mapped the stability determinants in the NF-L transcript and have shown that the major determinant of NF-L mRNA stability is localized to the binding site of the C-binding complex. The identification and characterization of RNP complexes on the NF-L transcript are therefore directly relevant to the mechanisms that regulate the stability of the NF-L transcript. The C-binding complex is unusual, in that its binding site is located in the proximal 45 nt of 3′-UTR but the binding reaction is markedly enhanced by the addition of the 23-nt flanking upstream sequence in the 3′-CR. The ability of distal 3′-CR to enhance formation of C-binding complexes could be due to its participation in secondary (or tertiary) structure. Computer modeling based on the free energy minimization algorithm of Zuker et al. (19Zuker M. Jaeger J.A. Turner D.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2707-2714Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) indicates that the distal 3′-CR forms a stable stem structure with the proximal 3′-UTR. Alternatively, it is also possible that other factors bind to the 3′-CR and facilitate formation of the C-binding complex. Immediate upstream flanking sequences are necessary for binding to a 29-nt destabilizing element in the 3′-UTR of human amyloid precursor protein mRNA (20Zaidi S.H.E. Denman R. Malter J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24000-24006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Remote upstream sequences may also be required to form an essential stem structure (21Scheper W. Holthuizen P.E. Sussenbach J.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1000-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The binding site for the C-binding complexes in the proximal 3′-UTR of NF-L mRNA is phylogenetically conserved (TableI). Several pyrimidine-rich stretches are present in proximal 45 nt of the 3′-UTR and may be instrumental for binding of the complex. Disruption of RNA structure by incubating probes with antisense oligonucleotides shows that the C-binding complex requires the integrity of sequences spanning the proximal, middle and distal pyrimidine-rich sites. Flanking and intervening sequences are also conserved (Table I) and may also be important for the formation of the C-binding complex.Table IComparison of the sequences in the proximal 3′-UTR (lowercase) and adjacent 3′-CR (uppercase) of the mouse (38Lewis S.A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 15279-15284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The pyrimidine composition of some of these sites is C-rich and complex formation is also inhibited by poly(C) homoribopolymers (16Wang X. Kiledjian M. Weiss I.M. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1769-1777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. Beresh J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3293-3299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Moreover, pyrimidine-rich sites often contain tandem repeats of sequence-specific motifs that are not functionally redundant in that complex formation is markedly impaired if a single motif repeat is disrupted (16Wang X. Kiledjian M. Weiss I.M. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1769-1777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. Beresh J.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 15279-15284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Whereas point mutations in some residues can be very disruptive, complex formation may tolerate or even be enhanced by exchanging the C and U pyrimidine residues in the binding site (22Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. Beresh J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3293-3299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 25Manzella J.M. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7077-7082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the sequence as well as the recognition site in the cognate binding factors have diverged during evolution so that the complex on the α-globin mRNA binds to a C-rich motif in the human but C/U-rich motif in the mouse (17Wang X. Liebhaber S.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5040-5051Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Splicing factors that bind to polypyrimidine tracts of intervening sequences have distinctive but overlapping sequence specificities (26Gorlach M. Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23074-23078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Singh R. Valcarcel J. Green M.R. Science. 1995; 268: 1173-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 28Coolidge C.J. Seely R.J. Patton J.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 888-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Indeed, competition between multiple trans-acting factors for binding to polypyrimidine tracts is believed to be instrumental in splicesome assembly and in the selection of the 3′-splice sites. An unusual feature of the C-binding complex is that its assembly is effected by the presence of other RNP complexes on the transcript. Gel shift studies suggest that the C- and U/A-binding complexes have reciprocal binding interactions, as if the two sets of complexes compete for the same components or use the same or nearby sites. These binding features were most readily observed with short probes that spanned the C-binding and nearby U/A-binding sites. Moreover, reciprocal binding phenomena were readily apparent in cross-linking experiments, suggesting that interactions between the complexes alter core (i.e. RNA contacting) binding components of the respective complexes. The assembly of similar U/A-binding complexes on probes to different regions (e.g. probes A, 1, and A680/B) of the NF-L transcript indicates that the complexes bind to multiple sites in the 3′-UTR and 3′-CR. Such a multiplicity of binding sites in the 3′-UTR and 3′-CR is reminiscent of some adenylate/uridylate-rich elements (ARE) that were originally described as destabilizing determinants in short-lived mRNAs of proto-oncogene, cytokines, and transcription factors (32Chen C.-Y.A. Shyu A.-B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar). For example, destabilization of β-interferon mRNA is mediated by multiple AREs that compete with each other and with poly(U) or poly(A) in the binding of a 65-kDa polypeptide (33Babu N. Raj K. Pitha P.M. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 702-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Agonist- or hypoxia-induced stabilization of mRNAs may be mediated by masking destabilizing AREs (34Malter J.S. Hong Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3167-3171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or by a different set of AREs (35Levy A.P. Levy N.S. Goldberg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25492-25497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Binding of the same set of factors to multiple sites in the 3′-UTR is also believed to regulate the stability of the neuronal GAP-43 mRNA (31Kohn D.T. Tsau K.-C. Cansino V.V. Neve R.L. Perrone-Bizzozero N.I. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 36: 240-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Moreover, the GAP-43 binding factors are neuron-specific, including a factor that was recently identified as an Elav-like protein (36Chung S. Eckrich M. Perrone-Bizzozero N. Kohn D.T. Furneaux H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6593-6598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Elav-like proteins are essential for the differentiation and maintenance of neurons and have been identified as the target immunogens that mediate autoimmune neurodegenerative disease (37Darnell R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4529-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The extent to which different components of the C- and U/A-binding complexes are neuron-specific is presently unknown. It is quite possible, for example, for neuron specificity to be mediated by altering (e.g. phosphorylation) a common component, by changing the concentration of a critical component(s), or by adding a novel component to the RNP complex in a neuronal setting. The 18- and 36-kDa polypeptide core binding components of the C-binding complexes are novel RNP components, which are enriched in neuronal tissues. They could represent subunits with similar properties or monomer/dimer components of a common subunit. In the latter instance, the ability of poly(C) to compete preferentially with the binding of the 36-kDa polypeptide would indicate a greater effect on the assembly of the dimer in the complex. In either case, the subunits are smaller than those of other RNP components that bind to C-rich sites and are competed with poly(C) (16Wang X. Kiledjian M. Weiss I.M. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1769-1777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. Beresh J.E. J. Biol.

The identification of the complexes and their binding sites will now enable further characterization of the RNP components and their role in stabilizing NF-L transcript. It is quite conceivable that factors regulating NF-L mRNA stability could also play a major role in the post-transcriptional regulation of neuronal metabolism. In particular, the findings could provide important insights into the relationship between overexpression of an NF-L transgene and the selective degeneration of motor neurons in transgenic mice."

However, control of IL-1 expression in thymic-derived stromal cells (TSC) has not been reported. We found that IL-1β increased steady-state mRNA levels for IL-1α and IL-1β in TSC-936 and TSC-2C4 cells; stability was not a major determinant of this effect. To study transcriptional regulation of IL-1β, we functionally characterized 4 kilobase pairs of the 5′-flanking region and first intron of the bovine IL-1β gene. The −470/+14 fragment was sufficient to confer maximal responsiveness to IL-1β upon transfection into these cell lines. Progressive 5′ deletions identified several IL-1β-responsive regions, including −308 to −226, which we further characterized. Electrophoretic mobility shift and supershift analyses showed that IL-1β induced the ability to form multiple protein complexes with −261/−226 and that one of these contained nuclear factor Oct-1. A competitor containing a mutated Oct consensus site failed to compete not only for this complex but others as well, suggesting that this sequence regulates binding of other proteins to this region. Functional analysis confirmed that this element was essential for maximal induction of transcription.

Although it is primarily recognized as an inflammatory agent, it exerts diverse effects on numerous cell types (for reviews, see Refs. 1Dinarello C.A.

Two distinct agonists, IL-1α and IL-1β, are encoded by distinct but closely related genes, and are produced by several cell types. Monocytes are the major sources of IL-1 in response to components derived from infectious agents such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and much of our knowledge about the control of IL-1 expression has been derived from these cells. In addition to its well known function in inflammation, IL-1 also plays an important role in T-cell development (for reviews, see Refs. 6Carding S.R. Hayday A.C. Bottomly K. Immunol.

IL-1α and tumor necrosis factor-α were shown to be required for early thymocyte commitment and differentiation (12Zuniga-Pflucker J.C. Jiang D. Lenardo M.J. Science. 1995; 268: 1906-1909Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and IL-1β was shown to be essential for positive selection by thymic nurse cells (13Pezzano M. Philp D. Stephenson S. Li Y. Reid V. Maitta R. Guyden J.C. Cell. Immunol. 1996; 169: 174-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In addition to effects on thymocytes, IL-1 also induced DNA synthesis and morphological changes in TSC (14Galy A.H.M. Hadden E.M. Touraine J. Hadden J.W. Cell. Immunol. 1989; 124: 13-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and stimulated thymic epithelial cells to produce other cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-8, granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor, and leukemia inhibitory factor (15Galy A.H.M.

These studies suggest that TSC-derived IL-1 serves as an autocrine/paracrine factor to modulate cytokine production within the thymus. A number of growth factors and hormones have been shown to regulate IL-1 expression in TSC, including epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor-α (18Le P.T. Lazorick S. Whichard L.P.

However, despite its biological significance, the regulation of IL-1 expression at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels in TSC remains poorly understood.

Although transcriptional control has been implicated in some studies, little is known about the mechanism(s) of the response. The regulation of IL-1 transcription has been most extensively studied in response to LPS in monocytes (for reviews, see Refs. 1Dinarello C.A.

Several DNA regulatory elements and corresponding nuclear proteins have been identified, which ultimately participate in the control of IL-1β transcription. These include an upstream induction sequence, which binds transcription factors NF-IL6, cAMP-response element binding protein (27Tsukada J. Saito K. Waterman W.R. Webb A.C. Auron P.E. Mol. Cell.

In addition to transcriptional regulation, the stability of IL-1 mRNA can be selectively modulated by various stimuli (for review, see Ref. 26Fenton M.J. Int. J. Immunopharmacol. 1992; 14: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Little is known about how this gene is controlled in other cell types by different stimuli. Moreover, several lines of evidence have suggested that regulation of IL-1 expression may occur at multiple levels, and the mechanisms may vary with the particular cell type and stimulus examined (18Le P.T.

In this study, we show that IL-1β is able to increase levels of mRNAs for both IL-1α and IL-1β in TSC, documenting a positive feedback loop for IL-1 in the thymus. We show that IL-1β regulates its own gene primarily at the level of transcription by inducing Oct-1 binding to a consensus sequence in the 5′-flanking region. These findings describe a previously unrecognized mechanism for autocrine regulation of IL-1β in TSC and establish a model system to study IL-1 gene regulation and signal transduction. Recombinant bovine IL-1β was a generous gift from Dr. Dale Shuster, American Cyanamid Company, Princeton, NJ. LPS and actinomycin D were purchased from Sigma. Antibodies, anti-Oct-1 (sc-232x), and anti-STAT5b (sc-835x) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Tissue culture plates and flasks were obtained from Fisher. Three bovine thymic stromal cell lines (TSC-936, TSC-2C4, TSC-934) and a bovine endometrial fibroblast line (End-6.2) were generated by a strategy of temperature-sensitive conditional transformation as described previously (20Tseng Y.-H.

Previous immunocytochemical studies showed that both TSC-936 and TSC-2C4 cells stained positively only for vimentin, consistent with a mesenchymal origin, whereas TSC-934 cells exhibited both vimentin- and cytokeratin-specific staining (Ref.20Tseng Y.-H.

Growth of these cells resembles tumor cells at the permissive temperature (33 °C) and reverts to a normal phenotype at the nonpermissive temperature (39 °C), which is also the normal temperature for bovine cells. These cells were routinely maintained at 33 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 5% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone; Logan, UT). LB, a bovine dermal fibroblast line (39Chase C.L.C. Lohff C. Letchworth G.J. Virology. 1993; 194: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), was grown at 39 °C. All experiments were performed on cells within 20 passages. For stimulation with cytokine, cells were plated and grown at 39 °C for 3 days to 80–90% confluency. The cells were then washed with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS, Life Technologies, Inc.) twice and serum-starved for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 before treatment. In all experiments, cells were treated with IL-1β at 10 ng/ml (0.5 nm) unless otherwise noted. LPS was used at 10 μg/ml. For mRNA stability studies, cells were treated with IL-1β for 3 h followed by the addition of 2 μg/ml actinomycin D, and incubation was continued for varying times. Cells were plated at a density of 4 × 105/T-25 flask and grown at 39 °C for 3 days before serum starvation and cytokine treatment as described above. Total RNA was isolated and analyzed using methods described previously (20Tseng Y.-H. Kessler M.A. Schuler L.A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1997; 128: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The signals were quantified with a PhosphorImager Storm 840 (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). All determinations were repeated 2–3 times. A bovine genomic EMBL3 phage library (40Yu P.-W. Chen H.-T. Czuprynski C.J. Schuler L.A. Cytokine. 1997; 9: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) was screened with an oligonucleotide probe (5′-GCAATGAAGGTTGGCTGG-3′) made from the 5′-untranslated region of the bovine IL-1β cDNA (41Maliszewski C.R.

Nucleotide sequences were determined on both DNA strands and analyzed using the Genetics Computer Group programs (42Devereux J. Haberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 687-695Crossref Scopus (11536) Google Scholar). The 4-kbpBamHI/BamHI fragment with or without an additional 0.6-kbp BamHI/NcoI fragment was inserted into pGL3-basic (Promega) to generate the pIL-1β-luciferase constructs with or without the first intron (Fig. 4, constructs 1 and 2). Other deletion constructs were generated by digestion with appropriate restriction enzymes from these plasmids. −278/+14, −255/+14, and -234/+14 constructs (Fig. 5) were derived by polymerase chain reaction amplification using oligonucleotides corresponding to the specific regions. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using a mutagenic oligonucleotide (5′-CCAACATATgcTTGCATGATGACAC-3′; sequences correspond to −247 to −223 of the bovine IL-1β gene, and the lowercase letters indicate mutated bases) and the MORPHTMsite-specific plasmid DNA mutagenesis kit (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO) to introduce an AT to GC mutation in the Oct consensus site in the −303/+14 and −255/+14 reporter plasmids. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing.

(43Kingston R.E. Chen C.A. Okayama H. Ausubel F.M. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley Interscience, New York1990: 9.1.1-9.1.3Google Scholar). For transient transfections, TSC-2C4 cells were plated at 3.6 × 105/6-cm plate and grown at 39 °C for 3 days. After transfection, they were washed with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline three times, incubated in serum free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 for 12–16 h, and then stimulated with 0.5 nm IL-1β for an additional 24 h before harvesting. Cells were lysed with 110 μl of 1× cell culture lysis reagent (Promega). Luciferase activity was measured by adding 100 μl of luciferase substrate to 50 μl of cell lysate in a Turner Designs Model 20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA). Relative light units were determined by 10-s integration and normalized with the co-transfected β-galactosidase activity, as measured by the Galacto-Light Plus kit (Tropix Inc., Bedford, MA). TSC-936 cells were stably transfected pIL-1β-luciferase constructs and pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) encoding the neomycin resistance gene and selected in 0.3 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.)-containing medium. Expanded, resistant colonies were treated as above. Luciferase activity was corrected for protein, as determined by the BCA protein assay (Pierce). TSC-2C4 and TSC-936 cells were plated at a density of 1.8–2 × 106/10-cm plate and grown at 39 °C for 3 days before serum starvation and cytokine treatment as described above. Nuclear extracts were prepared by a method modified from Andrews and Faller (44Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar). Cells from two 10-cm plates were incubated on ice for 10 min in 400 μl of buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 mm Na3VO4, vortexed, and then pelleted. A high salt extraction was performed by resuspending the cells in 25 μl of buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin and incubating on ice for 30 min. The extraction was repeated, and the supernatants were pooled and stored at −80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA protein assay. Mobility shift reactions containing 5 μl of nuclear extract (5 μg of total protein), 3 μg of poly(dI·dC), 4 μl of 5× binding buffer (1× contains 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol), and 1 ng of double-stranded oligonucleotide probe labeled by T4 polynucleotide kinase purified by Nick Columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in a final volume of 20 μl were incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The reactions were electrophoresed for 1.5–2 h on a 4% polyacrylamide gel with 2.5% glycerol in 0.25× Tris-buffered EDTA that had been prerun for at least 1 h. The −308/−226 fragment (Fig. 5 D) was generated by polymerase chain reaction amplification followed by gel purification. The −308/−274 and −261/−226 oligonucleotides (Fig. 5 D) were synthetic double-stranded DNA. For the competition assays, a 100-fold excess of competitor oligonucleotides was added to the binding reaction 20 min before the addition of the radiolabeled probe. Consensus sequences (CS) used as specific competitors include Oct_CS, 5′-CGTACGTCCATTTGCATGGATCCTCT-3′ (45Wegner M. Drolet D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 488-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar); GATA_CS, 5′-GAAACAAGATAAGATCAAATT-3′ (46Martin G. Orkin S.H.

For supershift assays, extracts were preincubated with 1 μg of antibody for 45 min at room temperature before the addition of the radiolabeled probe. All experiments were repeated at least two times. To see if there are differences in the ability of IL-1 to induce IL-1 expression among fibroblast cell lines derived from different tissues, we examined the effects of IL-1β on both IL-1 agonist mRNAs in different cell lines by Northern analysis. To eliminate the possibility that hormones or growth factors present in serum may induce the expression of IL-1, cells were cultured in serum-free media for 24 h before treatment. No IL-1 RNA was detected in any unstimulated cells (Fig.1). IL-1β induced both IL-1α and IL-1β mRNA accumulation in all three thymic stromal cell lines (TSC-934, -936, -2C4) to a somewhat different extent. IL-1β increased only IL-1α mRNA in the endometrial stromal End-6.2 cells. However, IL-1β had no detectable effect on mRNA levels for either IL-1 agonist in the LB line, despite the fact that IL-1 receptors have been described on these cells (48Lederer J. Czuprynski C. Mol. Immunol. 1993; 30: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In contrast to monocytes, the thymic stromal cell lines TSC-936 and TSC-2C4 were insensitive to LPS stimulation. This also ruled out the possibility that the IL-1 responses we observed were due to endotoxin contamination in the recombinant cytokine. These data suggested that the ability of IL-1β to induce IL-1α and IL-1β mRNAs was cell-specific. To further investigate the effects of IL-1β on thymic-derived stromal cells, we focused on cell lines TSC-936 and TSC-2C4. In both cell lines, IL-1α mRNA was greatly increased as early as 1 h by IL-1β, but increases in the level of IL-1β mRNA were not observed until 3 h after the addition of cytokine (Fig.2, A and B). However, at longer times, relative transcript levels differed between these cell lines. In TSC-936 cells, both messages gradually declined with time, whereas in TSC-2C4 cells, a further rise was observed at 8 h for both IL-1α and IL-1β, and levels remained elevated at 24 h. Expression of the IL-1α and IL-1β genes is regulated at multiple levels, including both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. To assess the contribution of mRNA stability to the IL-1β-induced increases in steady-state levels of IL-1α and IL-1β mRNAs, we measured the rates of decay of these transcripts following IL-1β treatment after inhibiting new transcription with actinomycin D. As shown in Fig. 2, C andD, both IL-1α and IL-1β mRNA rapidly decayed in both cell lines, with an estimated half-life of less than 1 h, similar to that reported for many unstable mRNAs in different cell types (for review, see Ref. 49Peltz S.W. Jacobson A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 979-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These data suggested a role for transcriptional regulation in the changes in steady-state levels of mRNA that we observed. As a first step toward studying the transcriptional regulation of IL-1β gene by IL-1β itself, we cloned the bovine IL-1β gene and functionally characterized the 5′-flanking region. A genomic clone with a 12-kbpSalI insert was isolated that contained about 7 kbp of 5′-flanking region plus the coding sequences. Primer extension identified a major transcript with an initiation site 45 base pairs 5′ to the first exon-intron junction; a TATA box was located 25 base pairs upstream of this site. Multiple other minor start sites were also observed in TSC-936, TSC-2C4, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (data not shown), consistent with the multiple putative TATA boxes present in the 5′-flanking region of this gene (Fig.3 A). Consensus sequences for a number of putative transcription factors were present in the 5′-flanking region as well as the first intron. Comparison of the sequences of the proximal promoter region (−462 to +45) to the human genomic sequences (50Clark B.D. Collins K.L. Gandy M.S. Webb A.C. Auron P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 14: 7897-7914Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar) showed 76% identity, including the regions indicated in IL-1β responsiveness (Fig. 3 B). To determine the role of transcription in the IL-1β-induced increases in the steady-state levels of mRNA, a fragment containing 4 kbp of the 5′-flanking region plus the first intron was linked to the luciferase reporter gene, and this construct was transiently transfected into TSC-2C4 cells. Stimulation of the cells with IL-1β increased luciferase activity 3.7-fold (Fig.4, C and D,lane 1). To further localize sequences necessary for IL-1β autoregulation, we generated a series of 5′-deletion constructs containing different amounts of the 5′-flanking region with or without the first intron (Fig. 4 A) and examined their responsiveness in both TSC-2C4 and TSC-936 cells. Because TSC-936 cells were difficult to transiently transfect, we generated stably transfected cells. To normalize for different copy numbers of the foreign gene in different stable cell lines, data are presented as -fold induction by IL-1β relative to the medium control. In both stably transfected TSC-936 and transiently transfected TSC-2C4, the −470/+14EcoRI-BamHI fragment was sufficient to confer maximal responsiveness to IL-1β (Fig. 4, B–D, lane 6). Basal levels varied with different constructs in transiently transfected TSC-2C4 (Fig. 4 C), suggesting multiple positive and negative regulatory elements. The stimulatory effect of IL-1β was dose-dependent; increases in luciferase activity were observed at concentrations as low as 20 pm, reaching maximal levels at 0.5 nm in both cell lines (data not shown). Because similar response patterns were observed in both cell lines, we utilized transiently transfected TSC-2C4 cells to further localize the response elements. Progressive 5′ deletions of the −470/+14EcoRI/BamHI fragment identified several IL-1β-responsive regions (Fig. 5,A–C). Deletion of −303 to −234 reduced IL-1β-stimulated reporter gene activity from 6.6- to 1.9-fold. Further dissection of this region identified two smaller areas located at −303 to −278 and −255 to −234, each of which reduced IL-1β responsiveness by approximately 40%. There was no significant difference between the constructs −278/+14 and −255/+14, suggesting that −278 to −255 may not contain important elements for the IL-1β response. Another region, located between −180 and −100, appeared to contain elements responsible for both basal and IL-1β-induced activities. In fact, deletion of −234 to −180 showed a significant reduction in basal activity, and further deletion to −100 diminished basal transcription to that of the promoterless vector control (Fig. 5 B). To avoid the confounding influence of basal transcription on IL-1β-induced activity, we focused our studies on the −303 to −234 region. To visualize protein-DNA interactions within the −303/−234 region, EMSA was performed. Using a probe spanning −308 to −226 (Fig. 5 D), which included the −303/−234 fragment and some surrounding sequences, we examined complex formation in nuclear extracts prepared from TSC-2C4 cells stimulated with IL-1β for increasing times. As shown in Fig.6 A, extracts from the IL-1β-stimulated cells were able to form at least five complexes. Among these, complex 2 was not detected in the untreated cells and was strongly induced by IL-1β. Complexes 1 and 3 were present at low levels before treatment and further increased by IL-1β. These complexes were induced by IL-1β as early as 30 min and remained intact up to 9 h. Competition assays showed that all five complexes were specifically competed by excess unlabeled −308/−226 oligonucleotide (Fig. 6 B, lane 2). The oligonucleotide, PRE, containing the consensus site for transcription factor STAT5 (47Gouilleux F. Pallard C. Dusanter-Fourt I. Wakao H. Haldosen L.-A. Norstedt G. Levy D. Groner B.

https://openalex.org/W2059078262,"Tannic acid, which comprises polyphenolic compounds from tea leaves, suppresses the glucocorticoid-induced gene expression of mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) integrated into 34I cells. To investigate whether this suppression is due to promoter responsiveness to tannic acid, we performed chloramphenicol acetyltransferase analysis transfecting a MMTV promoter containing a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression vector into mouse fibroblast L929 cells. Deletion analysis of the promoter region revealed that a 50-base pair (bp) region located downstream of the TATA element is responsible for the suppressive effect of tannic acid. The tannic acid-sensitive suppressibility was introduced into a thymidine kinase promoter by inserting the 50-bp region into the region on the 5′-upstream side of the promoter. Detailed point mutation analyses revealed that two elements, a 13-bp element and an ACTG motif in the 50-bp region, contribute to tannic acid sensitivity and promoter repressibility, respectively. Interestingly, this repressive ACTG motif is found in the human immunodeficiency virus promoter, the activity of which is also suppressed by tannic acid (Uchiumi, F., Maruta, H., Inoue, J., Yamamoto, T., and Tanuma, S. (1996) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 220, 411–417). Furthermore, electrophoretic mobility shift analysis revealed that a protein factor(s) in nuclear extracts from L929 cells binds to the 50-bp region in a sequence-specific manner and that the amount of DNA-protein complex is increased by tannic acid treatment. Moreover, the negative regulatory sequence ACTG and the tannic acid-sensitive 13-bp element in this region were shown to be responsible for the formation of the DNA-protein complex by electrophoretic mobility shift analysis and footprint analyses. These findings suggest that the suppressive effect of tannic acid on MMTV gene expression is mediated by a protein factor(s) that binds to the negative regulatory element containing the common ACTG motif in a cooperative manner with the tannic acid-sensitive 13-bp element."
https://openalex.org/W1781942360,"It is increasingly evident that cell swelling is associated with the triggering of many biological processes, including progression of the cell cycle, hormonal response, and gene expression. However, the mechanism by which cell swelling is initially sensed and converted into intracellular signals is still ill-defined. We report here an early event in the detection of cell swelling and initiation of the volume regulatory response in Giardia intestinalis, an ancient representative of the eukaryotic kingdom. Giardial cell swelling, irrespective of the extent, was sensed at a cell volume of 1.06 × isosmotic volume (the threshold volume), at which the transition of the volume regulatory transport system from the ‘resting’ to the ‘open’ state occurred. Irreversible modification by p-chloromercuribenzoate (pCMB) and N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) of reduced thiols affected the threshold volume, but in opposing manners: pCMB increased the threshold volume to 1.14 × and NEM decreased to 0.85 × isosmotic volume. The simple modification of the threshold volume by NEM caused a drastic reduction of giardial cell volume under isosmotic conditions, with a process strikingly similar to the opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pore, a causative event in stress-induced programmed cell death. Substantial evidence supports the hypothesis that modulation of the membrane thiol moieties at the threshold volume, causing the ‘all-or-nothing’ type of swelling detection, represents the event linking cell swelling to the second messenger systems for volume regulation in present eukaryotes. Pathophysiological implications of alteration of the threshold volume are discussed."
