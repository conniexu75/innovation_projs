https://openalex.org/W2005213334,"Infection has been obtained in both rhesus and cynomolgus monkeys by inhalation of poliomyelitis virus in the form of droplet nuclei. The olfactory route was excluded in part of the animals successfully infected. The gastrointestinal route is believed to have been excluded in the rhesus monkeys. It seems most probable that the portals of entry were the lower respiratory mucosa in the case of the rhesus monkeys and the oropharyngeal mucosa in the case of the cynomolgus monkeys. Fever and occasional mild symptoms in 8 other rhesus monkeys suggest that an abortive form of poliomyelitis may have resulted from inhalation, but this can not at present be considered as proved. The experiments open up the possibility that human poliomyelitis may, at least sometimes, be an air-borne infection and that the lungs may be a portal of entry. Neither of these aspects of the disease has hitherto, so far as we are aware, been studied experimentally. The presence of virus in the human nasopharynx, which has been repeatedly demonstrated, provides an obvious source of air contamination by patients and carriers; and direct contact has been traced during epidemics in a considerable fraction of cases, amounting to about one third in the report of Top and Vaughan. The relative importance of transmission by air and by ingested material remains to be determined. It would seem probable, however, that both modes of infection must be taken into account."

https://openalex.org/W1966645505,Certain strains of Staphylococcus aureus will agglutinate when grown in the presence of normal or influenza virus-infected chorio-allantoic fluid. Fluids are rendered inactive after heating at 56Â° C. for one or two minutes. Surface tension and temperature are not important factors in the manifestation of the phenomenon so long as they are within the limits compatible with growth. The reaction is favored by an alkaline pH. Bacterial dissociation is not a feature of this phenomenon and the relationship of this reaction to bacteriophagy is probably not significant but is being investigated further. Similar reactions as described for the egg fluids may be seen when Berkefeld filtrates of influenza virus-infected and normal mouse lungs are used. A more detailed account of all the data will appear at a later date.

https://openalex.org/W2799747427,"IN RECENT months many members of the AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY have expressed a desire to take an active part in the program of national defense. The number of letters which have been received by various officials in Washington from chemists all over the country offering their services to the Government is a clear manifestation of the great desire of the members of our profession to do their part in the present gigantic task of rearmament. Unfortunately, in many cases it has not been possible to take advantage of the talent thus offered. This is a physicist's war rather than a chemist's. For the present, at least, there appear to be more investigations of a physical nature than there are chemical military problems. But the situation may at any moment change rapidly. It is well to have a reservoir of research capacity in our colleges, universities, consulting laboratories, and research institutes. It may not be long ..."
