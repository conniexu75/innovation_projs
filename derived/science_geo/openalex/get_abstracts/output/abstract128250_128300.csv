https://openalex.org/W2092722802,"The tumor suppressor p53 exerts antiproliferation effects through its ability to function as a sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factor. Here, we demonstrate that p53 can be modified by acetylation both in vivo and in vitro. Remarkably, the site of p53 that is acetylated by its coactivator, p300, resides in a C-terminal domain known to be critical for the regulation of p53 DNA binding. Furthermore, the acetylation of p53 can dramatically stimulate its sequence-specific DNA-binding activity, possibly as a result of an acetylation-induced conformational change. These observations clearly indicate a novel pathway for p53 activation and, importantly, provide an example of an acetylation-mediated change in the function of a nonhistone regulatory protein. These results have significant implications regarding the molecular mechanisms of various acetyltransferase-containing transcriptional coactivators whose primary targets have been presumed to be histones."
https://openalex.org/W2115346781,"Telomerase, the ribonucleoprotein enzyme that elongates telomeres, is repressed in normal human somatic cells but is reactivated during tumor progression. We report the cloning of a human gene, hEST2, that shares significant sequence similarity with the telomerase catalytic subunit genes of lower eukaryotes. hEST2 is expressed at high levels in primary tumors, cancer cell lines, and telomerase-positive tissues but is undetectable in telomerase-negative cell lines and differentiated telomerase-negative tissues. Moreover, the message is up-regulated concomitant with the activation of telomerase during the immortalization of cultured cells and down-regulated during in vitro cellular differentiation. Taken together, these observations suggest that the induction of hEST2 mRNA expression is required for the telomerase activation that occurs during cellular immortalization and tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W1985064409,"We describe a gene encoding p73, a protein that shares considerable homology with the tumor suppressor p53. p73 maps to 1p36, a region frequently deleted in neuroblastoma and other tumors and thought to contain multiple tumor suppressor genes. Our analysis of neuroblastoma cell lines with 1p and p73 loss of heterozygosity failed to detect coding sequence mutations in remaining p73 alleles. However, the demonstration that p73 is monoallelically expressed supports the notion that it is a candidate gene in neuroblastoma. p73 also has the potential to activate p53 target genes and to interact with p53. We propose that the disregulation of p73 contributes to tumorigenesis and that p53-related proteins operate in a network of developmental and cell cycle controls."

https://openalex.org/W2242165656,"Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is a recessively inherited disorder characterized by dramatic episodes of fever and serosal inflammation. This report describes the cloning of the gene likely to cause FMF from a 115-kb candidate interval on chromosome 16p. Three different missense mutations were identified in affected individuals, but not in normals. Haplotype and mutational analyses disclosed ancestral relationships among carrier chromosomes in populations that have been separated for centuries. The novel gene encodes a 3.7-kb transcript that is almost exclusively expressed in granulocytes. The predicted protein, pyrin, is a member of a family of nuclear factors homologous to the Ro52 autoantigen. The cloning of the FMF gene promises to shed light on the regulation of acute inflammatory responses."

https://openalex.org/W1990983421,"The semaphorin family contains a large number of phylogenetically conserved proteins and includes several members that have been shown to function in repulsive axon guidance. Semaphorin III (Sema III) is a secreted protein that in vitro causes neuronal growth cone collapse and chemorepulsion of neurites, and in vivo is required for correct sensory afferent innervation and other aspects of development. The mechanism of Sema III function, however, is unknown. Here, we report that neuropilin, a type I transmembrane protein implicated in aspects of neurodevelopment, is a Sema III receptor. We also describe the identification of neuropilin-2, a related neuropilin family member, and show that neuropilin and neuropilin-2 are expressed in overlapping, yet distinct, populations of neurons in the rat embryonic nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2013184812,"Extending axons in the developing nervous system are guided to their targets through the coordinate actions of attractive and repulsive guidance cues. The semaphorin family of guidance cues comprises several members that can function as diffusible axonal chemorepellents. To begin to elucidate the mechanisms that mediate the repulsive actions of Collapsin-1/Semaphorin III/D (Sema III), we searched for Sema III–binding proteins in embryonic rat sensory neurons by expression cloning. We report that Sema III binds with high affinity to the transmembrane protein neuropilin, and that antibodies to neuropilin block the ability of Sema III to repel sensory axons and to induce collapse of their growth cones. These results provide evidence that neuropilin is a receptor or a component of a receptor complex that mediates the effects of Sema III on these axons."

https://openalex.org/W2019563312,"The absence of dystrophin at the muscle membrane leads to Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a severe muscle-wasting disease that is inevitably fatal in early adulthood. In contrast, dystrophin-deficient mdx mice appear physically normal despite their underlying muscle pathology. We describe mice deficient for both dystrophin and the dystrophin-related protein utrophin. These mice show many signs typical of DMD in humans: they show severe progressive muscular dystrophy that results in premature death, they have ultrastructural neuromuscular and myotendinous junction abnormalities, and they aberrantly coexpress myosin heavy chain isoforms within a fiber. The data suggest that utrophin and dystrophin have complementing roles in normal functional or developmental pathways in muscle. Detailed study of these mice should provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of DMD and provide an improved model for rapid evaluation of gene therapy strategies."

https://openalex.org/W2005637545,"The vomeronasal organ of mammals is an olfactory sensory structure that detects pheromones. It contains two subsets of sensory neurons that differentially express Gαo and Gαi2. By comparing gene expression in single neurons, we identified a novel multigene family that codes for a diverse array of candidate pheromone receptors (VRs) expressed by the Gαo+ subset. Different VRs are expressed by different neurons, but those neurons are interspersed, suggesting a distributed mode of sensory coding. Chromosome mapping experiments suggest an evolutionary connection between genes encoding VRs and receptors for volatile odorants. However, a dramatically different structure for VRs and the existence of variant VR mRNA forms indicate that there are diverse strategies to detect functionally distinct sensory stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W1988182516,Mammals have retained two functionally and anatomically independent collections of olfactory neurons located in the main olfactory epithelium and in the vomeronasal organ (VNO). Pheromones activate the VNO in order to elicit fixed action behaviors and neuroendocrine changes involved in animal reproduction and aggression. Differential screening of cDNA libraries constructed from individual rat VNO neurons has led to the isolation of a novel family of approximately 100 genes encoding seven transmembrane receptors with sequence similarity with Ca2+-sensing and metabotropic glutamate receptors. These genes are likely to encode a novel family of pheromone receptors. Patterns of receptor gene expression suggest that the VNO is organized into discrete and sexually dimorphic functional units that may permit segregation of pheromone signals leading to specific arrays of behaviors and neuroendocrine responses.
https://openalex.org/W2136449953,"In a 4-cell stage C. elegans embryo, signaling by the P2 blastomere induces anterior-posterior polarity in the adjacent EMS blastomere, leading to endoderm formation. We have taken genetic and reverse genetic approaches toward understanding the molecular basis for this induction. These studies have identified a set of genes with sequence similarity to genes that have been shown to be, or are implicated in, Wnt/Wingless signaling pathways in other systems. The C. elegans genes described here are related to wnt/wingless, porcupine, frizzled, beta-catenin/armadillo, and the human adenomatous polyposis coli gene, APC. We present evidence that there may be partially redundant inputs into endoderm specification and that a subset of these genes appear also to function in determining cytoskeletal polarity in certain early blastomeres."
https://openalex.org/W1987980762,"Dystrophin is a cytoskeletal protein of muscle fibers; its loss in humans leads to Duchenne muscular dystrophy, an inevitably fatal wasting of skeletal and cardiac muscle. mdx mice also lack dystrophin, but are only mildly dystrophic. Utrophin, a homolog of dystrophin, is confined to the postsynaptic membrane at skeletal neuromuscular junctions and has been implicated in synaptic development. However, mice lacking utrophin show only subtle neuromuscular defects. Here, we asked whether the mild phenotypes of the two single mutants reflect compensation between the two proteins. Synaptic development was qualitatively normal in double mutants, but dystrophy was severe and closely resembled that seen in Duchenne. Thus, utrophin attenuates the effects of dystrophin deficiency, and the double mutant may provide a useful model for studies of pathogenesis and therapy."

https://openalex.org/W2080835326,"In eukaryotic cells, firing of DNA replication origins normally does not recur until after M phase. This characteristic is thought to be due to the properties of “initiation” proteins like Orc, Cdc6, and Mcms. Using formaldehyde cross-linking, we show that Cdc6p and Mcm7p associate specifically with replication origins during G1 but not during G2 in S. cerevisiae. Mcm7p's association with origins depends on Cdc6p. Ectopic expression of Cdc6p enables it to associate with origins during G2, but this fails to recruit Mcm7p. Our data suggest that the loading of Mcm proteins onto origins is regulated by two mechanisms: first, by Cdc6p occupancy, and second, by S- and M-CDKs, whose activity during S, G2, and M phases prevents Mcm loading."
https://openalex.org/W2030557396,"A polarizing signal induces endoderm production by a 4-cell stage blastomere in C. elegans called EMS. We identified 16 mutations in five genes, mom-1 through mom-5, required for EMS to produce endoderm. mom-1, mom-2, and mom-3 are required in the signaling cell, P2, while mom-4 is required in EMS. P2 signaling downregulates an HMG domain protein, POP-1, in one EMS daughter. The sequence of mom-2 predicts that it encodes a member of the Wnt family of secreted glycoproteins, which in other systems activate HMG domain proteins. Defective mitotic spindle orientations in mom mutant embryos indicate that Wnt signaling influences cytoskeletal polarity in blastomeres throughout the early embryo."
https://openalex.org/W2151541959,"Crystal structures of binary and ternary complexes of the E. coli Rep helicase bound to single-stranded (ss) DNA or ssDNA and ADP were determined to a resolution of 3.0 A and 3.2 A, respectively. The asymmetric unit in the crystals contains two Rep monomers differing from each other by a large reorientation of one of the domains, corresponding to a swiveling of 130 degrees about a hinge region. Such domain movements are sufficiently large to suggest that these may be coupled to translocation of the Rep dimer along DNA. The ssDNA binding site involves the helicase motifs Ia, III, and V, whereas the ADP binding site involves helicase motifs I and IV. Residues in motifs II and VI may function to transduce the allosteric effects of nucleotides on DNA binding. These structures represent the first view of a DNA helicase bound to DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2063759666,"Stage-specific proteolysis of mitotic cyclins is fundamental to eukaryotic cell cycle regulation. We found that yeast Hct1, a conserved protein of eukaryotes, is a necessary and rate-limiting component of this proteolysis pathway. In hct1 mutants, the mitotic cyclin Clb2 is highly stabilized and inappropriately induces DNA replication, while G1 cyclins and other proteolytic substrates remain short-lived. Viability of hct1 mutants depends on SIC1. This and further results suggest that inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinases may compensate for defects in cyclin proteolysis. Remarkably, elevated levels of Hct1 ectopically activate destruction box- and Cdc23-dependent degradation of Clb2 and cause phenotypic effects characteristic for a depletion of M-phase cyclins. Hct1 and the related Cdc20 may function as substrate-specific regulators of proteolysis during mitosis."

https://openalex.org/W2136644864,"We demonstrate that fizzy-related (fzr), a conserved eukaryotic gene, negatively regulates the levels of cyclins A, B, and B3. These mitotic cyclins that bind and activate cdk1(cdc2) are rapidly degraded during exit from M and during G1. While Drosophila fizzy has previously been shown to be required for cyclin destruction during M phase, fzr is required for cyclin removal during G1 when the embryonic epidermal cell proliferation stops and during G2 preceding salivary gland endoreduplication. Loss of fzr causes progression through an extra division cycle in the epidermis and inhibition of endoreduplication in the salivary gland, in addition to failure of cyclin removal. Conversely, premature fzr overexpression down-regulates mitotic cyclins, inhibits mitosis, and transforms mitotic cycles into endoreduplication cycles."

https://openalex.org/W2013190249,"13S condensin is a five-subunit protein complex that plays a central role in mitotic chromosome condensation in Xenopus egg extracts. Two core subunits of this complex, XCAP-C and XCAP-E, belong to an emerging family of putative ATPases, the SMC family. We report here that 13S condensin has a DNA-stimulated ATPase activity and exhibits a high affinity for structured DNAs such as cruciform DNA. 13S condensin is able to introduce positive supercoils into a closed circular DNA in the presence of bacterial or eukaryotic topoisomerase I. The supercoiling reaction is ATP-dependent. We propose that 13S condensin wraps DNA in a right-handed direction by utilizing the energy of ATP hydrolysis. This reaction may represent a key mechanism underlying the compaction of chromatin fibers during mitosis."

https://openalex.org/W2077462876,"The structure of gelsolin has been determined by crystallography and comprises six structurally related domains that, in a Ca2+-free environment, pack together to form a compact globular structure in which the putative actin-binding sequences are not sufficiently exposed to enable binding to occur. We propose that binding Ca2+ can release the connections that join the N- and C-terminal halves of gelsolin, enabling each half to bind actin relatively independently. Domain shifts are proposed in response to Ca2+ as bases for models of how gelsolin acts to sever, cap, or nucleate F-actin filaments. The structure also invites discussion of polyphosphoinositide binding to segment 2 and suggests how mutation at Asp-187 could initiate a series of events that lead to deposition of amyloid plaques, as observed in victims of familial amyloidosis (Finnish type)."

https://openalex.org/W2016047955,"In yeast, TATA box binding protein associated factors (TAF(II)s) are dispensable for transcription of most genes. Here we use differential display to identify a small subset of yeast genes whose transcription in vivo requires yTAF(II)145. Promoter-mapping studies reveal, unexpectedly, that the region of a gene that renders it yTAF(II)145-dependent is not the upstream activating sequence, which contains the activator-binding sites, but rather the core promoter. In fact, a core promoter requiring yTAF(II)145 retained that requirement when its transcription was directed by several unrelated upstream activating sequences and even in the absence of an activator. Taken together, our results indicate that yTAF(II)145 functions in recognition and selection of core promoters by a mechanism not involving upstream activators."
https://openalex.org/W2040008103,"Ever since the use of interferon-gamma to treat patients with multiple sclerosis resulted in enhanced disease, the role of IFN-gamma in demyelination has been under question. To address this issue directly, transgenic mice were generated that expressed the cDNA of murine IFN-gamma in the central nervous system by using an oligodendrocyte-specific promoter. Expression of the transgene occurred after 8 weeks of age, at which time the murine immune and central nervous systems are both fully developed. Directly associated with transgene expression, primary demyelination occurred and was accompanied by clinical abnormalities consistent with CNS disorders. Additionally, multiple hallmarks of immune-mediated CNS disease were observed including upregulation of MHC molecules, gliosis and lymphocytic infiltration. These results demonstrate a direct role for IFN-gamma as an inducer of CNS demyelination leading to disease and provide new opportunities for dissecting the mechanism of demyelination."

https://openalex.org/W1964463485,"TFIID comprises the TATA box-binding protein and a set of highly conserved associated factors (TAF(II)s). yTAF(II)145, the core subunit of the yeast TAF(II) complex, is dispensable for transcription of most yeast genes but specifically required for progression through G1/S. Here we show that transcription of G1 and certain B-type cyclin genes is dependent upon yTAF(II)145. At high cell density or following nutrient deprivation, yeast cells cease division, enter a G0-like state, and terminate transcription of most genes. In this stationary phase, we find that the levels of yTAF(II)145, several other yTAF(II)s, and TBP are drastically reduced. Collectively, our results indicate that yTAF(II)145 and other TFIID components have a specialized role in transcriptional regulation of cell cycle progression and growth control."
