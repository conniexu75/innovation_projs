https://openalex.org/W2095898308,"Manipulating matter at the nanometre scale is important for many electronic, chemical and biological advances, but present solid-state fabrication methods do not reproducibly achieve dimensional control at the nanometre scale. Here we report a means of fashioning matter at these dimensions that uses low-energy ion beams and reveals surprising atomic transport phenomena that occur in a variety of materials and geometries. The method is implemented in a feedback-controlled sputtering system that provides fine control over ion beam exposure and sample temperature. We call the method ""ion-beam sculpting"", and apply it to the problem of fabricating a molecular-scale hole, or nanopore, in a thin insulating solid-state membrane. Such pores can serve to localize molecular-scale electrical junctions and switches and function as masks to create other small-scale structures. Nanopores also function as membrane channels in all living systems, where they serve as extremely sensitive electro-mechanical devices that regulate electric potential, ionic flow, and molecular transport across cellular membranes. We show that ion-beam sculpting can be used to fashion an analogous solid-state device: a robust electronic detector consisting of a single nanopore in a Si3N4 membrane, capable of registering single DNA molecules in aqueous solution."

https://openalex.org/W2171592578,"Relapse to cocaine addiction is frequently associated with subjective reports of craving, a poorly understood state that precedes and accompanies cocaine-seeking behaviours1. It has been suggested2 that over the first few weeks of withdrawal from cocaine, human addicts become sensitized to drug-associated environmental cues that act as external stimuli for craving, although the evidence for this is inconsistent3. Here we provide behavioural evidence from laboratory animals suggesting that the onset of craving is delayed and that craving does not decay, but rather increases progressively, over a two-month withdrawal period."

Inspection of the SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 sequences indicates that they both contain the sequence ψKXE, which represents the consensus SUMO modification site.

Pyrowolakis G. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 335-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). SUMO-1 is known to be covalently conjugated to a variety of cellular substrates via a three-step enzymatic pathway analogous to that of ubiquitin conjugation. The E1-like enzymes for both SUMO-1 and the yeast homologue Smt3p exist as heterodimers known as SAE1/SAE2 and Uba2p/Aos1p, respectively (2Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Kemp G.D. Hay R.T. J. Biol.

In the first step the SAE1/SAE2 heterodimer utilizes ATP to adenylate the C-terminal glycine of SUMO-1. Formation of a thioester bond between the C-terminal glycine of SUMO-1 and a cysteine residue in SAE2 is accompanied by the release of AMP. The second step is a transesterification reaction, which transfers SUMO-1 from the E1 to a cysteine residue within the SUMO-specific E2-conjugating enzyme (Cys93 in Ubc9). In the third step, Ubc9 catalyzes the formation of an isopeptide bond between the C terminus of SUMO-1 and the ε-amino group of lysine in the target protein. In contrast to the ubiquitin conjugation pathway no activity equivalent to an E3 ligase is required for SUMO-1 conjugationin vitro (2Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Kemp G.D. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10618-10624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 4Okuma T. Honda R. Ichikawa G. Tsumagari N. Yasuda H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), suggesting that the specificity for target proteins is conferred by Ubc9 itself or the Ubc9·SUMO-1 thioester complex. This is supported by the observations that almost all SUMO-1-conjugated proteins bind Ubc9 in two-hybrid assays, and the acceptor lysine residues on target proteins appear to exist within the consensus motif ψKXE (where ψ represents a large hydrophobic amino acid, and X represents any amino acid) (6Johnson E.S.

Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). Furthermore, SUMO-1 is thought not to form SUMO-1-SUMO-1 polymers, which are characteristic of ubiquitination. Unlike the majority of ubiquitinated proteins, acceptors of SUMO-1 modifications are not targeted for degradation. In fact, in the case of the transcriptional inhibitor IκBα the target lysine for SUMO-1 modification is the same as that of ubiquitin conjugation, thus blocking ubiquitination at that residue and stabilizing the protein (8Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). Transcriptional activity of specific proteins appears to be affected by SUMO-1 modification. For example, conjugation at a single site in the C terminus of p53 activates its transcriptional response (9Rodriguez M.S. Desterro J.M. Lain S. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Hay R.T.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6462-6471Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Furthermore, SUMO-1 modification of certain substrates is also known to have implications upon subcellular localization. The interaction of Ran GTPase-activating protein 1 (RanGAP1) with the Ran-GTP-binding protein 2 at the cytoplasmic face of the nuclear pore complex is dependent on SUMO-1 conjugation of RanGAP1 (11Mahajan R. Delphin C. Guan T. Gerace L. Melchior F. Cell. 1997; 88: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar, 12Matunis M.J. Coutavas E. Blobel G. J.

Blood. 2000; 95: 2748-2752Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two ubiquitin-like proteins, known as SUMO-2 (SMT3A, Sentrin-3) and SUMO-3 (SMT3B, Sentrin-2), have been identified that are related to SUMO-1 but are apparently functionally distinct (18Lapenta V. Chiurazzi P. van der Spek P. Pizzuti A. Hanaoka F. Brahe C. Genomics. 1997; 40: 362-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 19Saitoh H. Hinchey J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 11349-11353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 are very similar (95% sequence identity) but are relatively different from SUMO-1 (50% sequence identity). In vivostudies have indicated that PML is modified by SUMO-1 and SUMO-2/-3, although the functional significance of SUMO-2/-3 conjugation has not been revealed (21Kamitani T. Nguyen H.P. Kito K. Fukuda-Kamitani T. Yeh E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3117-3120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Whether or not SUMO-2/-3 conjugates to RanGAP1in vivo may depend on the expression levels of the SUMO proteins (19Saitoh H. Hinchey J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6252-6258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar, 20Kamitani T. Kito K. Nguyen H.P. Fukuda-Kamitani T. Yeh E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11349-11353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that SUMO-2/-3 is more abundant than SUMO-1 in COS-7 cells and that pools of free SUMO-2/-3 decrease when these cells are exposed to heat, ethanol, or hydrogen peroxide (19Saitoh H. Hinchey J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6252-6258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). Thus SUMO-2/-3 may be involved in the cellular response to environmental stresses. Here we demonstrate that functional SUMO modification sites present in the N-terminal regions of SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 are utilized by SAE1/SAE2 and Ubc9 to form polymeric chains of SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 on protein substrates in vitro, and SUMO-2 chains are detected in vivo. The ability to form polymeric chains is not shared by SUMO-1. Thus, although all SUMO species share the same conjugation machinery, modification by SUMO-1 and SUMO-2/-3 may have distinct functional consequences. HA-SUMO-1, HA-SUMO-2, HA-K11R-SUMO-2, and HA-SUMO-3 were detected in Western blot experiments using monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (at a 1:5000 dilution), which recognizes YPYDVPDYA from influenza HA, obtained from BAbCO. Sheep anti-mouse horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used to detect primary antibodies at a 1:5000 dilution. The wild type (wt) full-length (FL) 2The full-length versions of the SUMO proteins are the pro-protein forms that contain inhibitory C-terminal extensions (4, 11, and 2 residues for SUMO-1, SUMO-2, and SUMO-3, respectively). These are removed in vivo by specific proteases to yield mature, active protein products that terminate in a diglycine motif. cDNAs of SUMO-2 (309 nucleotides) and SUMO-3 (285 nucleotides) were cloned by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using HeLa poly(A)+ RNA as template in the TitanTMone-tube RT-PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. wt-SUMO-2 was cloned using primers 5′-TCCCCGCGCCGCTCGGAATCCATGTCCGAG-3′ and 5′-CCCGAATTCGGGACGGGCCCTCTAGAAACT-3′, and wt-SUMO-3 was cloned using primers 5′-GAGGAGACTCCGGCGGGATCCATGGCCGACGAA-3′ and 5′-GTAGAATTCCAGGTTCCCTTTTCAGTAGAC-3′. Shorter DNA constructs that code for proteins terminated at the diglycine (276 nucleotides for wt-SUMO-2-GG and 279 nucleotides for wt-SUMO-3-GG) were amplified by PCR using a single downstream primer (5′-CCCGAATTCCTAACCTCCCTGCTGCTGTTGGAACAC-3′) for both with the respective upstream primer as described above. The restriction sites introduced into the primers allowed the cleavage of the cDNAs by the enzymes BamHI and EcoRI and subsequent ligation into both pCDNA3-HA (22Desterro J.M. Thomson J. Hay R.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) and pGEX-2T. Note that our sequences for SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 cloned from poly(A)+ HeLa RNA were consistent with those cloned recently from a human B-lymphocyte library (23Ahn J.H. Xu Y. Jang W.J. Matunis M.J. Hayward G.S. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3859-3872Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) that only differ from one another by 3 residues close to the N terminus (see Fig. 2 A). The mutant SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 K11R DNAs were amplified by PCR using the same single downstream primer described above for the wild type GG constructs along with mutant upstream primers 5′-ATCGATGGATCCATGTCCGAGGAGAAGCCCAAGGAGGGTGTGAGGACAGAGAAT-3′ and 5′-ATCGATGGATCCATGGCCGACGAAAAGCCCAAGGAAGGAGTCAGGACTGAGAAC-3′, respectively. Cleavage with BamHI and EcoRI allowed the cloning of PCR products into pGEX-2T for GST fusion protein expression and pCDNA3-HA for transient cell transfection. DNA encoding the C52A-SUMO-1 mutant, which does not form disulfide dimers, was PCR-amplified from the wild type protein using the internal primers 5′-GAATCATACGCTCAAAGACAG-3′ and 5′-CTGTCTTTGAGCGTATGATTC-3′ and the external primers described previously for the cloning of the wt-SUMO-1-GG protein (22Desterro J.M. Thomson J. Hay R.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). pGEX-4T-SAE2 plasmid for expression of SAE2 was constructed by PCR amplification of SAE2 cDNA (2Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Kemp G.D. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10618-10624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) with the primers 5′-ACGCGTCGACATGGCACTGTCGCGGGGGCTG-3′ and 5′-GAATGCGGCCGCTCAATCTAATGCTATGACATC-3′. The PCR product was cleaved with SalI and NotI before insertion into similarly cleaved pGEX-4T. A plasmid for translationally linked expression of GST-SAE2/SAE1 was constructed by PCR amplification of SAE1 cDNA (2Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Kemp G.D. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10618-10624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) with primers containing a ribosome binding site andNotI restriction sites (5′-ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCATTAAAAGGAGAAATTAACTATGGTGGAGAAGGAGGAG-3′ and 5′-TATCAAATGCGGCCGCTCACTTGGGGCCAAGGCACTC-3′). The PCR product was cloned as a NotI insert in pGEX-4T-SAE2 to form the GST-SAE2/SAE1 expression plasmid. To generate a recombinant substrate containing a single SUMO modification site, GST was fused to an 11-amino acid sequence (PRKVIKMESEE) representing amino acids 485–495 of PML (7Rodriguez M.S. Dargemont C. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12654-12659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). GST and the 11-amino acid modification site were separated by a recognition motif (EPVYFQG) for the tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease (24Dougherty W.G. Parks T.D. Cary S.M. Bazan J.F. Fletterick R.J. Virology. 1989; 172: 302-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). An upstream primer complementary to pGEX-2T in the region of the BstBI restriction site (5′-GCTGAAAATGTTCGAAGATCGTTTATGTCA-3′) and a downstream primer containing both a BamHI restriction site and a sequence coding for the TEV protease recognition motif (5′-CAGGGATCCTTGGAAATAGACTGGTTCATCCGATTTTGGAGGATGGTC-3′) were used in PCR reactions using pGEX-2T as template. BstBI- andBamHI-cleaved PCR products were subsequently ligated into pGEX-2T to give the pGEX-2T-TEV plasmid. Into this expression plasmid DNA coding the 11-amino acid fragment of PML was inserted as described previously (7Rodriguez M.S. Dargemont C. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12654-12659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Human wild type histone deacetylase 4 (wt-HDAC4) in pCDNA3.1 (a gift from T. Kouzarides, University of Cambridge (25Miska E.A. Karlsson C. Langley E. Nielsen S.J. Pines J. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5099-5107Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar)), which encodes HDAC4 with an N-terminal Myc epitope tag linked to a 6-histidine (His6) peptide, was used as template with the internal primers 5′-GGCGTGCAGGTGAGGCAGGAGCCCATT-3′ and 5′-AATGGGCTCCTGCCTCACCTGCACGCC-3′ with the TransformerTMsite-directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH) as directed by the manufacturer. This generated the K559R-HDAC4 mutant DNA construct in pCDNA3.1. All DNA constructs were verified by automated DNA sequencing on an ABI PRISMTM 377 DNA Sequencer (St. Andrews University DNA Sequencing Unit). 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For analysis of SUMO-1/-2-modified His6-HDAC4, 75-cm2 flasks of subconfluent 293 cells were transfected with 12 μg of total plasmid DNA as indicated in the figures. Lysates, protein purification, and Western blots were prepared as indicated. His6-HDAC4 proteins were purified from transfected cells by guanidine cell lysis and nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose (Qiagen) purification as described previously (7Rodriguez M.S. Dargemont C. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12654-12659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Proteins eluted from the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose were fractionated by electrophoresis in 8% polyacrylamide gels containing SDS before anti-HA Western blotting as described above. GST-SAE2/SAE1 fusion protein was expressed inEscherichia coli B834 and purified by affinity chromatography using glutathione-Sepharose as described previously (26Jaffray E. Wood K.M. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2166-2172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The GST fusion protein was cleaved with thrombin and dialyzed to remove glutathione, and the SAE1/2 was purified by covalent affinity chromatography on a column of SUMO-1 linked to agarose as described previously (2Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Kemp G.D. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10618-10624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Expression of both proteins was confirmed by Western blotting, and the activity of recombinant protein was tested by thioester assay using 125I-SUMO-1 and Ubc9 (data not shown). Recombinant Ubc9 was expressed and purified as detailed previously (22Desterro J.M. Thomson J. Hay R.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). All SUMO proteins were expressed in E. coli strain B834, extracted, and purified as described previously (26Jaffray E. Wood K.M. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2166-2172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GST-SUMO proteins were bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads and either eluted with buffer containing 10 mm glutathione or cleaved by 17 units·ml−1 thrombin while bound. Eluted GST-SUMO proteins were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) and concentrated using 30-kDa molecular mass cut-off microconcentrators to 10 mg·ml−1 before storage at −70 °C. Thrombin-cleaved SUMO proteins were dialyzed against 20 mm ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.2), 1 mm DTT. Protein samples were lyophilized and taken up in 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm DTT at a concentration of 10 mg·ml−1. All cleaved SUMO protein masses were verified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry on a Micromass TofSpec 2E mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK; University of St. Andrews Mass Spectrometry Service) before use in the assays. The GST-TEV-PML protein was expressed and extracted as described for the GST fusion SUMO proteins. The resultant GST-TEV-PML protein (referred to herein as GST-PML) solution was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm DTT and concentrated to 4 mg·ml−1 using 10-kDa molecular mass cut-off microconcentrators. All recombinant protein concentrations were determined using both the Bradford method (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215632) Google Scholar) or calculated ε280 extinction coefficients for absorbance measurements at 280 nm. wt-SUMO-GG proteins were labeled by incorporation of [35S]methionine/cysteine during isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction of bacterial cultures as described above in the presence of 35.75 mCi/liter [35S]methionine/cysteine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Expressed proteins were then purified as outlined above for the unlabeled proteins. In vitrotranscription/translation of proteins was performed using 1 μg of plasmid DNA and a wheat germ-coupled transcription/translation system according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer (Promega). [35S]Methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used in the reactions to generate radiolabeled proteins. C52A-SUMO-1, GST-SUMO-2-FL, and GST-PML were radiolabeled with 125I using the chloramine-T method as described previously for wt-SUMO-1 (22Desterro J.M. Thomson J. Hay R.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) except that the labeled protein was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm DTT instead of passage over a P2-acrylamide gel column. Noncompetitive SUMO conjugation assays were performed in 10-μl volumes containing between 1.4 and 10 μg (as indicated) of either unlabeled or35S/125I-labeled SUMO proteins, an ATP-regenerating system, and buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 3.5 units·ml−1creatine kinase) and 0.6 units·ml−1 inorganic pyrophosphatase in either the absence or presence of 1 μl of [35S]methionine-labeled substrate (HDAC4 or promyelocytic leukemia protein) or varying concentrations of GST, GST-PML, GST-SUMO-1-FL, GST-SUMO-2-FL, or GST-SUMO-3-FL as indicated in the figure legends. Unless otherwise stated, assays contained 120 ng (1.1 pmol) of purified recombinant SAE1/SAE2 and 650 ng (35.9 pmol) of Ubc9. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for between 45 min and 4 h as described. After termination with SDS sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol, reaction products were fractionated by electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels (8–10%) containing SDS, stained, destained, and dried before analysis by phosphorimaging. Competition assays were performed in 10-μl reaction volumes with limiting Ubc9 (0.55 pmol/10 ng), 5 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 120 ng (1.1 pmol) of purified recombinant SAE1/SAE2, 4 μg (143 pmol) of GST-PML, and 0.5 μm125I-C52A-SUMO-1 with either no competitor or one of seven 1:1 serial dilutions of wt-SUMO-1 (from 142 to 2.22 μm), K11R-SUMO-2 (from 80 to 1.25 μm), or K11R-SUMO-3 (from 73 to 1.14 μm). Reactions were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C before termination with SDS sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol followed by electrophoresis in a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing SDS. Gels were stained and destained before drying and exposure to a phosphorimaging screen for 10 min. The mutant proteins C52A-SUMO-1 and K11R-SUMO-2/-3 were used to avoid experimental interference from SUMO-1-SUMO-1 disulfide linked dimers and the formation of poly(SUMO-2) and poly(SUMO-3). After a 3-h incubation a portion (10 μl) of the SUMO-2 conjugation assays carried out either in the absence of substrate or in the presence of GST-PML was dialyzed against 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate on a 0.025-μm VS membrane disc (Millipore, Bedford, MA). This procedure not only exchanged the buffer but also removed ATP thus stopping the reaction. 0.5 μl of trypsin (bovine, sequencing grade, Roche Diagnostics, 1 μg·μl−1) was added to the dialyzed sample, and the digestion was allowed to proceed overnight at 37 °C. The tryptic digest was then analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. 0.5 μl of tryptic digest was applied to the target along with 0.5 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid to acidify the sample and 0.5 μl of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix solution (10 mg·ml−1 in 75% acetonitrile, 2.5% formic acid) and allowed to dry. The sample was analyzed using a TofSpec 2E mass spectrometer (Micromass) in reflectron mode. To facilitate the biochemical analysis of SUMO-1 conjugation an in vitro system has been developed that contains recombinant, bacterially produced components. The assay contains SAE1/SAE2, Ubc9, SUMO-1, and, as substrate, GST fused to an 11-amino acid sequence containing the SUMO modification site located between amino acids 485–495 of PML (7Rodriguez M.S. Dargemont C. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12654-12659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Each of the components was analyzed in a polyacrylamide gel containing SDS and was highly purified as judged by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig.1 A). SUMO-1 was labeled with35S by the addition of [35S]methionine/cysteine to the bacterial growth medium. In comparison with previous assay methods that used cell extract sources of SAE1/2 and in vitro translated protein substrates, the GST-PML fusion was efficiently utilized as a substrate for modification with 35S-labeled SUMO-1 in this system (Fig. 1 B). The specificity of the reaction was assessed by comparing modification of GST with that of the GST-PML fusion and quantitation of the 35S-labeled products by phosphorimaging. Although GST contains 21 lysine residues, none of them conform to the SUMO modification consensus ψKXE, and modification of GST was less than 1% of that observed for the GST-PML fusion (Fig. 1 C). The extent of modification was such that after fractionation by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis the reaction products could be easily monitored by Coomassie Blue staining. Under these conditions the product of the reaction was GST-PML bearing a single SUMO-1 modification with no evidence for the formation of SUMO-1 multimers (Fig. 1, D and E). Inspection of the SUMO-1, SUMO-2, and SUMO-3 sequences revealed that a consensus SUMO modification site (ψKXE) is present in the N-terminal regions of SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 but is absent in the sequence of SUMO-1 (Fig.2 A). This raises the possibility that SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 could be used as substrates for SUMO modification and thus form poly(SUMO) chains. SUMO-1, SUMO-2, and SUMO-3 were therefore expressed and purified as both the full-length pro-protein precursors and the shorter active forms (exposing the C-terminal diglycine motif). GST fusion and thrombin-cleaved versions of each protein were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining (data not shown). The thrombin-cleaved proteins were essentially homogeneous, and their mass, which was determined by mass spectrometry, corresponded to that predicted from the sequence. To test the possibility that SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 could be conjugated to themselves the purified proteins were incubated in an assay containing purified SAE1/SAE2 and Ubc9. Analysis of the reaction products by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining revealed that in the presence of all the assay components a large number of more slowly migrating species are observed that are consistent with the formation of poly(SUMO-2) (Fig. 2 B) and poly(SUMO-3) (Fig. 2 C) chains. In each case the formation of these products was dependent on the presence of SAE1/SAE2 and Ubc9. To compare the ability of SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 to act as acceptors for SUMO modification with that of SUMO-1 and GST-PML, GST fusions of the unprocessed forms (which cannot be conjugated to protein substrates) of SUMO-1-(1–101) (SUMO-1-FL), SUMO-2-(1–103) (SUMO-2-FL), and SUMO-3-(1–95) (SUMO-3-FL) and GST-PML were added in increasing amounts to a modification reaction containing 125I-labeled SUMO-1 and limiting amounts of Ubc9. Incorporation of SUMO-1 into conjugated product was determined and plotted as a function of added substrate (Fig. 2 D). GST-SUMO-2-FL was relatively efficiently utilized as a substrate (0.9 pmol of product formed in the presence of 100 pmol of substrate) albeit less efficiently than GST-PML (1.6 pmol of product formed in the presence of 100 pmol of substrate), whereas GST-SUMO-3-FL was not a good substrate for SUMO-1 modification (0.2 pmol of product formed in the presence of 100 pmol of substrate). GST-SUMO-1-FL modification was at background levels (less than 0.1 pmol of product formed in the presence of 100 pmol of substrate). Although the accumulation of slowly migrating species was consistent with the formation of poly(SUMO-2) chains, it was important to establish that this was indeed the case and to demonstrate that these chains could be linked to substrate proteins. In vitro reactions containing SAE1/SAE2 and Ubc9 were therefore set up in the additional presence of GST-PML, SUMO-2, or GST-PML and SUMO-2. Analysis of the reaction products by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining revealed that in the presence of SUMO-2, dimers and trimers of SUMO-2 were present (Fig. 3 A). In the presence of GST-PML, but with no added SUMO-2, no additional products were generated. When GST-PML and SUMO-2 were incubated in the conjugation assay a series of more slowly migrating products were generated that are consistent with the formation of poly(SUMO-2) chains linked to GST-PML (Fig. 3 A). To establish the identity of lysine residues involved in the formation of poly(SUMO-2) chains and attachment to the GST-PML substrate, samples from the reaction products analyzed in Fig. 3 A were digested with trypsin and analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Trypsin digestion of the assay mixture, containing SUMO-2 but no substrate, gave signals corresponding to the expected peptides produced by cleavage at the carboxyl side of lysine and arginine residues (Fig. 3 B). In particular a signal was detected at 3873.5 Da that corresponds to aa 59–92 of SUMO-2. This peptide contains Arg60, which under these conditions appeared to be resistant to trypsin cleavage with only a very small portion of the completely digested product (3570.7 Da) being detected. Additionally a pair of signals were detected at 5048.9 and 5352.1 Da. These signals correspond to digestion fragments in which aa 61–92 of SUMO-2 are covalently linked by an isopeptide bond to aa 8–20 of SUMO-2 and aa 59–92 are linked by an isopeptide bond to aa 8–20. Hence, these sign"

The mantle is the rocky, interior region of the planet that transports heat generated during accretion and subsequent core formation. The crust formed by melting of the upper mantle, and has been shaped and re-distributed by impact, volcanism, mantle flow and erosion. Observations point to a dynamically active interior in the early phases of martian history, followed by a rapid fall-off in heat transport that significantly influenced the geological, geophysical and geochemical evolution of the planet, including the history of water and climate."

https://openalex.org/W1624627435,"Direct dating of ductile shear zones and calculation of uplift/exhumation rates can be done using various radiometric dating techniques. But radiometric dating of shallow crustal faulting, which occurs in the crust's brittle regime, has remained difficult because the low temperatures typical of shallow crusted faults prevent the complete syntectonic mineral recrystallization that occurs in deeper faults. Both old (detrital) and newly grown (authigenic) fine-grained phyllosilicates are thus preserved in shallow fault zones and therefore their radiometric ages reflect a mixture of both mineral populations. Also, the loss of 39Ar during neutron irradiation in dating of clay minerals can produce erroneously old ages. Here we present a method of characterizing the clay populations in fault gouge, using X-ray modelling, combined with sample encapsulation, and show how it can be used to date near-surface fault activity reliably. We examine fault gouge from the Lewis thrust of the southern Canadian Rockies, which we determine to be approximately 52 Myr old. This result requires the western North America stress regime to have changed from contraction to extension in only a few million years during the Eocene. We also estimate the uplift/exhumation age and sedimentary source of these rocks to be approximately 172 Myr."

An intracellular pool of endogenously synthesized hyaluronan, from 1 to 20 fg/cell, inversely related to cell density, was observed in cultured rat epidermal keratinocytes. More than 80% of the intracellular hyaluronan was small (<90 kDa). Approximately 25% of newly synthesized hyaluronan was endocytosed by the keratinocytes and had a half-life of 2–3 h. A biotinylated aggrecan G1 domain/link protein probe demonstrated hyaluronan in small vesicles of ∼100 nm diameter close to the plasma membrane, and in large vesicles and multivesicular bodies up to 1300 nm diameter around the nucleus. Hyaluronan did not co-localize with markers of lysosomes. However, inhibition of lysosomal acidification with NH4Cl or chloroquine, or treating the cells with the hyaluronidase inhibitor apigenin increased intracellular hyaluronan staining, suggesting that it resided in prelysosomal endosomes. Competitive displacement of hyaluronan from surface receptors using hyaluronan decasaccharides, resulted in a rapid disappearance of this endosomal hyaluronan (t 12 ∼5 min), indicating its transitory nature. The ultrastructure of the hyaluronan-containing vesicles, co-localization with marker proteins for different vesicle types, and application of specific uptake inhibitors demonstrated that the formation of hyaluronan-containing vesicles did not involve clathrin-coated pits or caveolae. Treatment of rat epidermal keratinocytes with the OX50 monoclonal antibody against the hyaluronan receptor CD44 increased endosomal hyaluronan. However, no CD44-hyaluronan co-localization was observed intracellularly unless endosomal trafficking was retarded by monensin, or cultivation at 20 °C, suggesting CD44 recycling.

Our experiments show that even in open monolayer cultures, where hyaluronan can easily escape into the culture medium, REKs actively internalize and rapidly metabolize newly synthesized hyaluronan in a receptor-mediated fashion through an endocytic route which is not dependent on coated pits or caveolae, but which involves CD44.

Here we show that vomeronasal neurons can actually detect both odorants and pheromones. This suggests that in mammals, as in insects4,5,6, odorous compounds released from plants or other animal species may act as 'semiochemicals' — signalling molecules that elicit stereotyped behaviours that are advantageous to the emitter or to the receiver."

https://openalex.org/W3103457928,"Binary pulsars provide an excellent system for testing general relativity because of their intrinsic rotational stability and the precision with which radio observations can be used to determine their orbital dynamics. Measurements of the rate of orbital decay of two pulsars have been shown1,2 to be consistent with the emission of gravitational waves as predicted by general relativity, but independent verification was not possible. Such verification can in principle be obtained by determining the orbital inclination in a binary pulsar system using only classical geometrical constraints. This would permit a measurement of the expected retardation of the pulse signal arising from the general relativistic curvature of space-time in the vicinity of the companion object (the ‘Shapiro delay’). Here we report high-precision radio observations of the binary millisecond pulsar PSR J0437-4715, which establish the three-dimensional structure of its orbit. We see the Shapiro delay predicted by general relativity, and we determine the mass of the neutron star and its white dwarf companion. The determination of such masses is necessary in order to understand the origin and evolution of neutron stars3."

To explore the molecular basis of TGF-β regulation of OPG expression, we evaluated the effects of TGF-β on osteoclast formation, OPG protein secretion, mRNA expression, and gene transcription. The marked inhibitory effect of TGF-β on osteoclast differentiation was confirmed in a co-culture model utilizing murine stromal/osteoblastic BALC cells and bone marrow hematopoietic precursors. This inhibition in osteoclast differentiation was preceded by a decrease in RANKL mRNA expression (5-fold) and a reciprocal increase in OPG mRNA (6.1-fold) and protein (7.1-fold) expression in BALC cells. At the promoter/transcriptional level, TGF-β treatment resulted in a 3–10-fold increase in reporter gene activity directed by a 5.9-kilobase fragment of the human OPG promoter in transfection assays performed in UMR106 cells. The effect of TGF-β was mimicked by TGF-β2 and -β3 but not by BMP-4, suggesting a TGF-β signal-specific effect. Deletion analysis revealed that a 183-base pair region (−372 to −190) in the promoter was required for TGF-β responsiveness, and this region was sufficient to confer TGF-β inducibility to a heterologous (osteocalcin) minimal promoter. Substitution mutations that disrupted the Cbfa1- and/or Smad-binding elements present in the 183-base pair region resulted in a decrease in base-line expression and in the responsiveness to TGF-β and Cbfa1.

TGF-β is one such cytokine that plays a major role in the regulation of bone formation and resorption (21Centrella M. Horowitz M. Wozney J.M. McCarthy T.L. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 27-39PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown to inhibit the formation of osteoclast-like cells in long term human marrow cultures (22Chenu C. Pfeilschifter J. Mundy G.R. Roodman G.D.

More recently, TGF-β has been shown to induce OPG expression in osteoblastic cells and to inhibit osteoclast differentiation and survival (17Murakami T. Yamamoto M. Ono K. Nishikawa M. Nagata N.

However it is not known whether TGF-β directly affects the transcriptional activity of the OPG gene. To further investigate the molecular basis of TGF-β effects on OPG production, we analyzed the effect of TGF-β on osteoclast formation, OPG protein secretion, mRNA expression, and gene transcription. In order to analyze the mechanism by which TGF-β stimulates OPG gene transcription, we have characterized the TGF-β-responsiveness of a 5.9-kb fragment of the human OPG promoter that we recently cloned (24Thirunavukkarasu K. Halladay D.L. Miles R.R. Yang X. Galvin R.J.S. Chandrasekhar S. Martin T.J. Onyia J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25163-25172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). We provide evidence that TGF-β inhibition of osteoclast formation is preceded by reciprocal up-regulation of OPG (mRNA and protein) and down-regulation of RANKL. TGF-β effects on OPG expression occurred by direct activation of the OPG promoter as demonstrated in transient and stable transfection analyses. Additionally, we demonstrate that a 183-bp proximal region (−372 to −190) of the promoter is necessary and sufficient for mediating TGF-β effects. Mutation of a Cbfa1-binding element (OSE2) (25Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar) and/or a Smad-binding element (SBE) (26Jonk L.J.C.

Taken together, our studies suggest the involvement and possible interaction of Cbfa1 and Smad proteins in mediating the effects of TGF-β on the OPG promoter. For analyzing the role of TGF-β on osteoclast differentiation, co-cultures of bone marrow cells and BALC cells (a murine calvarial-derived cell line) were performed in the presence or absence of TGF-β as described previously (27John V. Hock J.M. Short L.L. Glasebrook A.L. Galvin R.J.S. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2457-2463Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 28Sells Galvin R.J. Gatlin C.L. Horn J.W. Fuson T.R. Biochem.

Bone marrow cells from the femora of male Balb/C mice (aged 10 weeks; Taconic, Germantown, NY) were seeded into 24-well cluster dishes (Costar, Cambridge, MA) at a density of 5 × 104 mononuclear cells/cm2in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) containing 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic solution (Life Technologies). BALC cells (1.5 × 104 cells/cm2) were co-cultured with the bone marrow cells. The cultures were treated either with vehicle or with 10−8 m 1,25-(OH)2vitamin D3, (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA) in the presence of vehicle or recombinant human TGF-β (0.01–10 ng/ml) (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for 6 days, with fresh medium and reagents added on day 3. At the termination of the experiments, the cultures were fixed with 10% formalin for 10 min and stained for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity as previously described (27John V. Hock J.M. Short L.L. Glasebrook A.L. Galvin R.J.S. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2457-2463Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The number of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive multinucleated cells (containing three or more nuclei) was counted in each well. Cloning of the 5.9-kb fragment of the human OPG promoter (pOPG5.9βgal) as well as sequential 5′-deletions of the promoter (pOPG3.6βgal, pOPG1.9βgal, pOPG1.5βgal, pOPG0.9βgal, pOPG0.4βgal, and pOPG0.2βgal) linked to the β-galactosidase (β-gal) reporter gene in pβgal-Basic reporter vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), were performed using standard cloning procedures, as described previously (24Thirunavukkarasu K. Halladay D.L. Miles R.R. Yang X. Galvin R.J.S. Chandrasekhar S. Martin T.J. Onyia J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25163-25172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of the proximal OSE2 element, the AP1-like element, and the SBE was performed using the two-step PCR strategy (29Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G.

The proximal OSE2 core element (AACCTCA, at positions −309 to −303) in the pOPG0.9βgal construct (in the pβgal-Basic vector backbone) was substituted with a random sequence of six nucleotides (AGATATC; EcoRV recognition site underlined). The AP1-like element (GGAGACA, at positions −293 to −287) was substituted with a 6-nucleotide random sequence (CTCGAGA; XhoI recognition site underlined), and the SBE element (CAGACA, at positions −230 to −225) was substituted with the 6-nucleotide random sequence (GAATTC;EcoRI recognition site).

The second-step PCR was performed with flanking primers (pβgal-F and pβgal-R), using the two first step PCR products as template. To generate the OSE2, AP1-like, and SBE mutant constructs (pOPG0.9OSEmutβgal, pOPG0.9AP1mutβgal, and pOPG0.9SBEmutβgal), the second-step PCR product was digested with Asp718 andBglII and was ligated to pβgal-Basic vector containing the same restriction ends. To generate the OSE2, AP1-like, and SBE mutations in pOPG0.4βgal, the 0.4-kb region (−372 to +19) containing the mutation was PCR-amplified from pOPG0.9OSEmutβgal, pOPG0.9AP1mutβgal, and pOPG0.9SBEmutβgal, respectively, using the primers, 5′-ata ggt acc gcc cag ccc tcc cac cgc tgg t-3′ (OPG392AspF) and pβgal-R. The PCR product was digested with Asp718 and BglII and ligated to pβgal-Basic vector that was digested with the same enzymes. In order to link the 183-bp region (−372 to −190) upstream of the osteocalcin minimal promoter (−34/+13) (25Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar), PCR amplification was performed using OPG392AspF as forward primer and 100OPGOG2 (5′-ata tag atc tga ctt gtc tgt tcc tgc acc ctc cag cat cca gta gca ttt ata tcg ccc agg gag gtg ggg cgt ga-3′) as reverse primer (that contains aBglII restriction site and the osteocalcin −34/+13 sequence at the 5′-end). pOPG0.4βgal served as template. The resultant PCR products were digested with Asp718 and BglII and ligated to pβgal-Basic vector that was digested with the same enzymes to generate the −372 to −190 OCβgal construct. Substitution mutations in the OSE2, AP1-like, and SBE elements were created in the −372 to −190 OCβgal construct by PCR amplification using the appropriate mutant pOPG0.4βgal construct as template and OPG392AspF and 100OPGOG2 as forward and reverse primers, respectively. The −34/+13 OCβgal construct was created by annealing OG2For (5′-tat agg tac ccg ata taa atg cta ctg gat gct gga ggg tgc agg aac aga caa gtc aga tct ata t-3′) and OG2Rev (5′-ata tag atc tga ctt gtc tgt tcc tgc acc ctc cag cat cca gta gca ttt ata tcg ggt acc tat a-3′) oligonucleotides, digesting the double-stranded oligonucleotide withAsp718 and BglII, and ligating them to pβgal-Basic digested with the same enzymes. Double mutants (OSE2 and SBE) were created utilizing the same two-step PCR strategy, with a template containing the OSE2 mutation and primers containing the SBE mutation. pEF/myc/cyto (control vector) was purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). pEF-Cbfa1 containing the coding region for the Cbfa1 isoform starting with amino acids MASNS and ending with VWRPY (Osf2Met69) (30Thirunavukkarasu K.

The integrity of all plasmid constructs was confirmed by restriction mapping and automated DNA sequencing. The GCG Wisconsin Package (Genetics Computer Group, Inc., Madison, WI) was used to analyze the 5.9-kb OPG promoter for the presence of consensus transcription factor binding sites, including AP1 sites, SBEs, OSE2 (Cbfa1-binding element), and other elements. BALC cells were grown as described above (27John V. Hock J.M. Short L.L. Glasebrook A.L. Galvin R.J.S. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2457-2463Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The UMR106 rat osteosarcoma cell line was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium (3:1) (Life Technologies), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 mm Hepes, and 2 mmglutamine. All cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. Experiments were initiated when cells were ∼70–80% confluent. For studies on TGF-β induction, UMR106 cells (2 × 105 cells/well) were plated in six-well plates and incubated for 24 h. Cells were then serum-starved for 12–16 h (in medium containing 0.1% serum) and then transfected with 1 μg of either the OPG promoter-βgal construct(s) or the negative control promoterless plasmid pβgal-Basic, using FugeneTM 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as recommended by the manufacturer. Approximately 5.5 h after transfection, the medium was removed and replaced with complete medium. Four hours later, the cells were subjected to serum starvation (in medium containing 0.1% serum) overnight. Cells were then treated with either vehicle or TGF-β (10 ng/ml) for the indicated times. After the treatments, cells were lysed in 100 μl of lysis buffer, and β-gal activity was assayed in a fixed amount of the extracts (one-fifth of total) using the β-gal reporter gene assay kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). β-gal enzyme activity was determined and expressed as relative light units or as the percentage change over control activity (serum-free controls, with no TGF-β addition). The results from a representative experiment are shown as the mean ± S.E. of 4–12 separate wells. As a positive control and to verify transfection efficiency, separate plates were transfected with a β-gal expression plasmid (pβgal-Promoter; CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), that has the β-gal reporter gene coding region under the control of the SV40 early promoter. This was done to avoid possible squelching of factors that could arise when cotransfecting multiple plasmids (31Farr A. Roman A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 920Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar,32Selvamurugan N. Chou W.-Y. Pearman A.T. Pulumati M.R. Partridge N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10647-10657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). β-gal expression was quantified either by histochemical staining or by β-gal enzymatic assay. The transfection efficiency was 85–90% and comparable across plates. Additionally, all of our experiments were repeated many times (∼2–6 times) using multiple clones of the same construct and different preparations of the plasmids. The results obtained under these conditions were similar or identical in nature. Furthermore, the luciferase reporter vector was not used to normalize for transfection efficiency because of our recent finding that cryptic enhancer elements in the promoterless luciferase reporter vector pGL3-Basic could mediate transactivation by Cbfa1, leading to spurious background luciferase expression (33Thirunavukkarasu K. Miles R.R. Halladay D.L. Onyia J.E. BioTechniques. 2000; 28: 506-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). For Cbfa1 transactivation studies, 2 × 105 cells were plated per well in six-well plates and incubated for 24 h. Cells were transfected with 1 μg each of the reporter plasmid (OPG promoter-βgal constructs or the negative control promoterless plasmid pβgal-Basic) and the effector plasmid (pEF-Cbfa1 or the control expression vector, pEF/myc/cyto) and incubated for an additional 48 h. The OPG promoter construct pOPG5.9βgal (−5917 to +19), was stably transfected into UMR106 cells using FugeneTM 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as recommended by the manufacturer. A second plasmid, pRc/CMV (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), encoding the neomycin gene was cotransfected for selection. Forty-eighty hours after transfection in T25 flasks (Corning Glass), cells were reseeded (1:10) into T75 flasks (Corning Glass) and selected in medium containing 1 mg/ml G418 for 10 days. Regular medium changes were made at 3–4-day intervals. On day 10, randomly selected G418-resistant colonies (containing more than 50 cells) were picked and expanded in fresh medium containing 1 mg/ml G418. For analysis of gene expression, selected colonies were plated in 96-well plates (50,000 cells/well) for 24 h, and experiments were initiated following serum withdrawal for 12–16 h. Cells were stimulated with TGF-β1, -β2, -β3, or BMP-4 (R & D Systems), as indicated and analyzed as described above for transient transfection assays. Cell extracts were assayed for β-gal activity using the β-gal reporter gene assay kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as recommended by the manufacturer. Luminescence was measured in a Dynatech MLX luminometer, and light integration was measured at 2 s (relative luminescence units summed). Results were analyzed using Student's t test, and probability (p) values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. BALC and UMR106 cells were plated in T150 flasks, allowed to grow to 70–80% confluence, transferred to medium containing 0.1% serum for 12–16 h, and then treated with TGF-β (10 ng/ml) for the indicated periods of time. Total RNA was extracted using Ultraspec-IITM reagent, as recommended by the manufacturer (Biotecx, Houston, TX). Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from total RNA using Oligotex resin (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol and quantified by spectrophotometry. OPG, RANKL, Cbfa1, and GAPDH cDNAs were used to generate radioactive probes using the Random Primer DNA labeling kit (Life Technologies). 25 ng of cDNA were labeled using [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and free nucleotides were removed by centrifugation through a Centricon-50 column (Amicon). OPG and RANKL mRNA expression was analyzed by Northern blot. GAPDH was used as a control for RNA integrity and to normalize for variations in loading and transfer efficiency. Prehybridization and hybridization were carried out at 48 °C in NorthernMax buffers (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX). After hybridization, the membranes were washed for 30 min at room temperature in buffer containing 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS and then for 30 min at 48 °C in 0.2× SSC and exposed to Biomax MS x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.) at −70 °C. Autoradiograms were quantified by scanning laser densitometry (LKB 2400 Gel Scan XL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In order to quantify the amount of OPG secreted into the cell culture medium, BALC cells (4800 cells/well) were plated in 96-well plates, treated with TGF-β (10 ng/ml), and incubated for 72 h. The amount of OPG secreted into the culture medium was analyzed using a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay procedure, utilizing rabbit polyclonal antiserum directed against recombinant human OPG, as described previously (18Onyia J.E.

We reported earlier that co-culture of the murine calvaria-derived stromal/osteoblastic cell line BALC along with murine bone marrow cells in the presence of 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3 resulted in the differentiation of hematopoietic osteoclast progenitors in the bone marrow to form tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive, multinucleated osteoclasts (27John V.

Bone. 1998; 23: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). These osteoclasts expressed calcitonin receptor and were fully capable of resorbing bone in pit formation assays performed on bovine cortical bone slices. The addition of TGF-β to these co-cultures resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the number of osteoclasts formed (Fig. 1A). At a concentration of 10 ng/ml, TGF-β completely inhibited the differentiation of osteoclast precursors. Since a reciprocal expression of OPG and RANKL in osteoblasts/stromal cells is essential for supporting osteoclast formation (35Nagai M. Sato N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 719-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), we analyzed the effect of TGF-β on OPG and RANKL expression in BALC cells. As shown in Fig. 1, B andC, treatment of BALC cells with TGF-β (10 ng/ml) led to a time-dependent increase in the steady state levels of OPG mRNA, with a maximum of 6.1-fold stimulation observed after 12 h of treatment, and a parallel decrease (∼5-fold) in RANKL mRNA levels. Consistent with the increase in OPG mRNA levels, treatment of BALC cells with TGF-β led to a 7.1-fold increase in the amount of OPG protein secreted into the culture medium (Fig. 1D). TGF-β had a very similar effect in stimulating OPG mRNA (3.7-fold increase at 24 h) (Fig. 1E) and protein levels (data not shown) in the rat osteosarcoma cell line UMR106. To better understand the mechanism by which TGF-β regulates OPG expression, we investigated its effect on OPG gene transcription. We analyzed the human OPG promoter (−5917 to +19) fused to the β-gal reporter gene (24Thirunavukkarasu K. Halladay D.L. Miles R.R. Yang X. Galvin R.J.S. Chandrasekhar S. Martin T.J. Onyia J.E. J.

Previous studies have shown that caveolin-1 is phosphorylated on tyrosine 14 by c-Src and that lipid modification of c-Src is required for this phosphorylation event to occur in vivo. Phosphocaveolin-1 (Tyr(P)-14) localizes within caveolae near focal adhesions and, through its interaction with Grb7, augments anchorage-independent growth and epidermal growth factor-stimulated cell migration. However, the cellular factors that govern the coupling of caveolin-1 to the c-Src tyrosine kinase remain largely unknown. Here, we show that palmitoylation of caveolin-1 at a single site (Cys-156) is required for coupling caveolin-1 to the c-Src tyrosine kinase. Furthermore, upon evaluating a battery of nonreceptor and receptor tyrosine kinases, we demonstrate that the tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 by c-Src is a highly selective event. We show that Src-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 can be inhibited or uncoupled by targeting dually acylated proteins (namely carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), CD36, and the NH2-terminal domain of Gαi1) to the exoplasmic, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic regions of the caveolae membrane, respectively. Conversely, when these proteins are not properly targeted or lipid-modified, the ability of c-Src to phosphorylate caveolin-1 remains unaffected. In addition, when purified caveolae preparations are preincubated with a myristoylated peptide derived from the extreme N terminus of c-Src, the tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 is abrogated; the same peptide lacking myristoylation has no inhibitory activity. However, an analogous myristoylated peptide derived from c-Yes also has no inhibitory activity. Thus, the inhibitory effects of the myristoylated c-Src peptide are both myristoylation-dependent and sequence-specific. Finally, we investigated whether phosphocaveolin-1 (Tyr(P)-14) interacts with the Src homology 2 and/or phosphotyrosine binding domains of Grb7, the only characterized downstream mediator of its function. Taken together, our data identify a series of novel lipid-lipid-based interactions as important regulatory factors for coupling caveolin-1 to the c-Src tyrosine kinase in vivo.

There are now three known caveolin genes (Cav-1, Cav-2, and Cav-3) that correspond to four different subtypes of caveolin proteins.

Chem. 1995; 270: 6838-6842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar,47Uittenbogaard A. Smart E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25595-25599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). This suggests that these palmitoyl groups may serve other functions, perhaps in regulating the interaction of caveolin-1 with other caveolar protein components. Here, we directly explore this hypothesis.Many acylated signaling proteins, such as eNOS, Gα subunits, and Src family kinases also reside within caveolae (1Lisanti M.P. Scherer P. Tang Z.-L. Sargiacomo M. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 231-235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 3Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). However, unlike caveolin-1, these molecules localize to noncaveolar cell compartments when their sites of myristoylation and/or palmitoylation are eliminated. Thus, it appears that lipid modification of certain signaling molecules serves to target them to caveolae, where they can interact with caveolin-1 (49Galbiati F. Volonte' D. Meani D. Milligan G. Lublin D.M. Lisanti M.P. Parenti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5843-5850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).Here, we show that c-Src-mediated phosphorylation of caveolin-1 is highly selective and is strictly dependent on the palmitoylation of caveolin-1 at a single site (Cys-156). We speculate that this coupling event occurs through an interaction between the N-terminal myristoyl moiety of c-Src and the palmitoyl group attached to caveolin-1 at Cys-156. A prediction of this hypothesis is that targeting of other acylated proteins to caveolae should be able to competitively uncouple c-Src from caveolin-1. In direct support of this hypothesis, we demonstrate that targeting of three distinct classes of dually acylated proteins (GPI1-linked, transmembrane, and cytoplasmically oriented) to caveolae is sufficient to inhibit Src-induced phosphorylation of caveolin-1 in vivo. Similarly, in vitro competition experiments show that a peptide encoding the myristoylated N terminus of Src prevents the tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 in purified preparations of caveolae membranes. We also show that the inhibitory effects of the myristoylated c-Src peptide are both myristoylation-dependent and sequence-specific. Thus, our current studies demonstrate that the lipid-modified nature of certain proteins not only serves to target them to caveolae but may also function to modulate the balance of protein-protein interactions occurring within caveolae membranes.DISCUSSIONLipid modification of certain proteins serves to target them to caveolae. It is ironic that the defining protein of caveolae (i.e. caveolin-1), while palmitoylated on three residues, does not require lipid modification for its proper targeting or caveolar membrane association (34Dietzen D.J. Hastings W.R. Lublin D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6838-6842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Thus, we explored the possibility that the acyl groups of caveolar proteins, including caveolin-1 itself, can regulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 by c-Src.Here, we show through a detailed mutational analysis that the terminal palmitoylation site of caveolin-1, cysteine 156, is the single palmitoylation site required for coupling the c-Src tyrosine kinase to caveolin-1. This finding is of interest, since the only other experimentally derived function for the acyl groups of caveolin-1 shows that removal of the cysteine 156 palmitoylation site eliminates caveolin-1 association with cholesterol and the chaperone protein HSP56 (47Uittenbogaard A. Smart E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25595-25599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). These effects are specific, since the loss of cysteines at positions 133 and 143 either did not affect caveolin-1 cholesterol binding or resulted in its inability to bind other proteins, respectively. Taken together with our current findings, it is clear that the palmitoylation of specific residues on caveolin-1 affects its interaction with other proteins in vivo. These data suggest that interactions with cholesterol via caveolin-1's terminal palmitoyl group may also be important for caveolin-1 to serve as a substrate for c-Src. In support of this notion, we have shown that insertion of oxidized cholesterol within caveolae membranes in vivoblocks the tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 in response to cellular stress (51Volonte' D. Galbiati F. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8094-8103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar).Using proteins that localize to caveolae under various conditions, we were able to examine multiple aspects of the role played by fatty acyl-containing proteins on the c-Src-mediated phosphorylation of caveolin-1. Since GPI-linked proteins target to caveolae only when cross-linked or clustered, the caveolar localization of GPI-linked proteins can be specifically induced by the addition of bivalent antibodies to the medium. In accordance with these previous studies, we show here that expression of CEA (a well studied GPI-anchored protein) at the plasma membrane is not sufficient to uncouple the Src-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1. However, after induction of caveolar targeting of CEA by antibody cross-linking, the tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 is greatly reduced. Thus, the mere co-expression of a dually acylated membrane protein is insufficient to alter caveolin-1 phosphorylation by c-Src, showing that caveolar localization is necessary to block this phosphorylation event.Since GPI-acyl groups are restricted to the exoplasmic leaflet of the lipid bilayer, while caveolin-1 palmitoyl groups and the c-Src myristoyl group reside within the cytoplasmic leaflet of the lipid bilayer, our results also provide evidence that there is communication between lipid moieties within the exoplasmic and cytoplasmic leaflets of the lipid bilayer. The mechanism by which the clustering of GPI-anchored proteins connects to the function of lipid-anchored proteins on the cytoplasmic surface has not been thoroughly elucidated (59Rietveld A. Simons K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 467-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). It is possible that lipid-lipid interactions between the exoplasmic and cytoplasmic leaflets of the caveolar membrane serve to alter the relationship between the proteins to which they are bound, ultimately affecting their function. This is supported by the fact that there is no known “protein-protein” interaction between GPI-anchored proteins and caveolin-1 or c-Src. The acyl group-dependent association of caveolin-1 with cholesterol may also link the cytoplasmic and exoplasmic leaflets of the lipid bilayer, since cholesterol is present in both leaflets and can potentially form dimers that span the membrane, acting as a bridge (60Harris J.S. Epps D.E. Davio S.R. Kezdy F.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3851-3857Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).The use of the acylated Gαi1-GFP fusion proteins was also quite informative. Given that both the “myristoylated/palmitoylated” and “myristoylated-only” Gαi1-GFP fusion proteins localize to caveolae (49Galbiati F. Volonte' D. Meani D. Milligan G. Lublin D.M. Lisanti M.P. Parenti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5843-5850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), we predicted that expression of either would abrogate c-Src phosphorylation of caveolin-1. However, only the dually acylated form of the protein affected caveolin-1 phosphorylation. This observation can be generalized, since only dually acylated proteins, regardless of the region of caveolae to which they were targeted (exoplasmic or cytoplasmic membrane domains), affected the phosphorylation of caveolin-1 by c-Src (summarized in Fig.9). Both in vitro and in vivo, proteins that were myristoylated-only were unable to disrupt caveolin-1 phosphorylation, with the exception of the myristoylated c-Src N-terminal peptide lacking the kinase domain, in vitro. This presents the intriguing possibility that the amino acid sequence adjacent to the myristoyl group on c-Src is important for its interaction with caveolin-1. Although differences in substrate specificity and kinase activity must also be taken into account, it is an interesting first observation that the myristoylated-only Src family kinases (c-Src and Blk) were the only two that could efficiently phosphorylate caveolin-1 (Fig. 1 A).Finally, we determined which binding domains of Grb7 interact with phosphocaveolin-1 (Tyr(P)-14). The SH2 and PTB domain of Grb7 each bound Src-phosphorylated caveolin-1, although the SH2 domain showed a much stronger interaction. Similarly, other Grb7-interacting proteins, such as insulin receptor and focal adhesion kinase, either prefer the SH2 domain or interact with both SH2/PTB domains equally well (58Kasus-Jacobi A. Bereziat V. Perdereau D. Girard J. Burnol A.F. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2052-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 61Han D.C. Shen T.L. Guan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28911-28917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Since Grb7 contains two functional phosphotyrosine binding domains (SH2 and PTB) and Grb7 forms large hetero-oligomeric complexes, Grb7 binding may serve to link phosphocaveolin-1 (Tyr(P)-14) to the focal adhesion machinery. In support of this notion, phosphocaveolin-1 (Tyr(P)-14) is localized within a subpopulation of caveolae membranes that are proximal to focal adhesions in intact cells (50Lee H. Volonte D.

There are now three known caveolin genes (Cav-1, Cav-2, and Cav-3) that correspond to four different subtypes of caveolin proteins.

An inherited deficiency of hAC activity causes a fatal lysosomal accumulation of ceramide in patients suffering from Farber disease (1Moser H.W. Linke T. Fensom A.H. Levade T. Sandhoff K. Scriver Beaudet Valle Sly The Metabolic & Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 8th Ed. McGraw Hill Inc., New York2001: 3573-3588Google Scholar). Ceramide is the common backbone of most sphingolipids and serves as the hydrophobic anchor of sphingolipids in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells. All steps leading to ceramide synthesis are localized to the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum (2Mandon E.C. Ehses I. Rother J. van Echten G. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11144-11148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Michel C. van Echten-Deckert G. Rother J. Sandhoff K. Wang E. Merrill A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22432-22437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The stepwise addition of various activated sugar residues occurs in the Golgi compartment and leads to the large number of different glycosphingolipids observed in eukaryotic cells. The transfer of phosphorylcholine to the 1-hydroxy group of ceramide to generate sphingomyelin takes place at the luminal side of the cis-Golgi (4Jeckel D. Karrenbauer A. Birk R. Schmidt R.R. Wieland F. FEBS Lett. 1990; 261: 155-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The lysosomal degradation of glycosphingolipids is catalyzed by the sequential action of exoglycosidases, whereas sphingomyelin is hydrolyzed by sphingomyelinase. Ceramide is further degraded into sphingosine and fatty acid by hAC. In vivo lysosomal cleavage of ceramide is achieved by the coordinate action of hAC and the membrane-active sphingolipid activator proteins SAP-C or SAP-D, which presumably interact with lipid bilayers in such a way that the amide bond of ceramide becomes more accessible to the active center of the enzyme (5Klein A.

During the past decade, interest in ceramide and its derivatives has been focused on its role in signal transduction processes. Numerous studies on receptor-mediated signaling gave evidence that the regulated generation of ceramide through sphingomyelin breakdown plays a physiological role in the induction of cellular stress responses and apoptosis (reviewed in Refs. 7Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar and 8Perry D.K. Hannun Y.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). A number of exogenously applied, short chain ceramide derivatives have also been shown to be capable of inducing cellular changes resembling apoptosis. Whereas most reports on stress-mediated signal transduction put ceramide in the focus of this signaling pathway, ceramide generation is not always necessarily linked to stress responses; it is also thought to be involved in nonapoptotic signaling (9Segui B.

Two different alkaline ceramidases were purified from guinea pig epidermis, which are most active toward long chain ceramides such as N-lineoylsphingosine. In addition, neutral and alkaline ceramidase activity have been found in cultured skin fibroblasts, white blood cells, cerebellum, kidney, and small intestine, where it seems to play an important role in the hydrolysis of dietary ceramides (25Yada Y.

Lysosomal enzymes are usually translocated into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and then transported further to the early Golgi compartment. In the Golgi compartment, they are subjected to a variety of post-translational modifications (i.e. modification of carbohydrate structures with mannose 6-phosphate) before being routed to the acidic organelles of the cell. In fibroblasts, most of the soluble lysosomal proteins are targeted to endosomes and lysosomes via the mannose 6-phosphate receptor (M6PR)-mediated pathway (29von Figura K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 642-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, a small number of lysosomal enzymes have been shown to be sorted to endosomes and lysosomes by an M6PR-independent pathway (e.g. acid phosphatase (30Peters C. Braun M. Weber B. Wendland M. Schmidt B. Pohlmann R. Waheed A. von Figura K. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3497-3506Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), β-glucocerebrosidase (31van Dongen J.M. Willemsen R. Ginns E.I. Sips H.J.

Schneider W. Sandhoff K. Herz J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4617-4625Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar)). Fibroblasts from I-cell disease patients (mucolipidosis II) are deficient in the proper formation of mannose 6-phosphate residues (33Kornfeld S. Sly W.S. Scriver Beaudet Valle Sly The Metabolic & Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 8th Ed. McGraw Hill Inc., New York2001: 3469-3482Google Scholar). As a consequence, these fibroblasts secrete most of the M6PR-dependent proteins instead of sorting them to endosomes and lysosomes. Previous enzymatic studies on I-cell disease fibroblasts gave no direct evidence for hAC being generally targeted via the M6PR pathway, since residual cellular hAC activity was decreased by only 50–60% compared with normal fibroblasts (34Ben-Yoseph Y. Gagne R. Parvathy M.R. Mitchell D.A. Momoi T. Clin. Genet. 1989; 36: 38-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We therefore analyzed the targeting and processing of hAC in normal and I-cell fibroblasts as well as the relevance of the potential N-glycosylation sites by metabolic labeling studies. [35S]methionine/cysteine (>1000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from ICN, and [32P]phosphate was from Hartmann Analytics (Braunschweig, Germany). Protease inhibitors were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals; PNGase F and endo-β-N-acetylglycosaminidase H (Endo H) were from New England Biolabs; and anti-IgY-agarose was from Promega. DMEM as well as methionine/cysteine-deficient and phosphate-free MEM were purchased from Sigma, and Opti-MEM was from Life Science. All other chemicals were of the highest purity available and purchased from Sigma, Merck, or Roth GmbH. Diploid human skin fibroblasts and fibroblasts of a patient with I-cell disease were established from biopsies submitted to us for diagnosis. Mannose 6-phosphate receptor −/− knock-out mouse fibroblasts (35Pohlmann R. Boeker M.W. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27311-27318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. von Figura (Göttingen, Germany). Human skin fibroblasts and COS-1 cells were grown in monolayers at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere in DMEM supplemented with antibiotics and 10% fetal calf serum. Specific pathogen-free chickens (VALO, Lohmann, Cuxhaven) were hatched and raised in isolators under filtered negative air pressure. Prior to the immunization with hAC, preimmune sera were obtained from these birds to serve as hAC antibody negative controls. Pure preparation of hAC (approximately 1.2 mg/ml) was solved in phosphate-buffered isotonic saline, pH 7.0, containing 0.05% β-d-octyl glucoside. In total, 0.5 ml of this preparation were emulsified with two parts of complete Freund's adjuvant (Difco) and administered at multiple intramuscular and intradermal parts of two 6-week-old chicken. After 6 weeks, the chicken were boostered and exsanguinated 14 days later. This experiment was performed with permission of the Lower Saxony Authorities (permit number 99A 884). Subconfluent (80–90% confluence) fibroblast cell cultures (21-cm2dishes) were starved for 2 h in methionine/cysteine-free MEM supplemented with 4% dialyzed (with TBS) and heat-inactivated FCS. Labeling was initiated by the addition of 100 μCi/mll-[35S]methionine/cysteine to the deficient medium. Various chase periods were started by substituting the pulse medium with methionine/cysteine-free MEM supplemented with 4% dialyzed and heat-inactivated FCS and 3 mm methionine, 0.2 mm cysteine final concentration. Prior to [32P]phosphate labeling, cells were washed twice with phosphate-free MEM supplemented with 4% dialyzed and heat-inactivated FCS and incubated for 10 min. Labeling was conducted by the addition of 250 μCi/ml [32P]phosphoric acid for the indicated time. For some experiments, cells were preincubated with 10 mm NH4Cl 1 h prior tol-[35S]methionine/cysteine labeling, and the treatment continued throughout the pulse and chase periods. Labeled cells were washed once with cold PBS, harvested by scraping, and lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture mini-tablet/10 ml (CompleteTM; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in PBS, pH 7.2), 4 °C, 20 min, unless otherwise stated. Lysis buffer for [32P]phosphate-labeled cells was additionally supplemented with 50 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 1 mmorthovanadate. Subsequently, cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and the supernatant was preadsorbed with protaminesulfate for an additional 30 min on ice. The insoluble precipitate was sedimented by centrifugation. The cleared supernatants were carefully removed and incubated with 2 μl of chicken anti-human hAC antiserum for >4 h. The immune complexes were precipitated by adding anti-IgY-agarose for an additional 2 h. The immunoprecipitates were washed 10 times for 30 min at 4 °C with radioimmune precipitation buffer. Immunoprecipitation from the cell culture media was carried out by the addition of 2 μl of chicken anti-hAC-antiserum and subsequent precipitation with anti-IgY-agarose as outlined above. Deglycosylation with Endo H and PNGase F were essentially performed as suggested by the manufacturers except that instead of 1% Triton X-100, as recommended for PNGase F digestion, 0.25% β-d-octyl glucoside was used. Deglycosylation was generally performed at 37 °C overnight. Confluent human skin fibroblasts were labeled with l-[35S]methionine/cysteine in the presence of NH4Cl for 16 h. The radiolabeled culture medium was dialyzed extensively against DMEM and added either to unlabeled fibroblasts for 12 h in the presence of 10 mm mannose 6-phosphate or to M6PR-deficient mouse fibroblasts (35Pohlmann R. Boeker M.W. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27311-27318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were prepared and treated as described above. The wild-type cDNA was cloned into the pSV-Sport-1 vector (Life Science) commonly used for transient protein expression in COS-1 cells. Site-directed mutagenesis of the wild-type hAC-cDNA was performed using the QuikChange kit from Stratagene. Two complementary PCR primers for each of the six potential N-glycosylation sites were generated with a sequence mutation that results in the substitution for the normal asparagine by glutamine within theN-glycosylation consensus sequence. The Pfupolymerase replicates both strands of the plasmid without replacing the two oligonucleotides. A mutagenized plasmid with staggered nicks was generated by incorporation of the oligonucleotide primers. In a subsequent step, the wild-type plasmid strands were digested by the endonuclease DpnI, which specifically acts on methylated and hemimethylated DNA strands. The PCR-derived strands carrying the desired mutation were not cleaved by DpnI, since they are not methylated. The polymerase chain reaction primers used for mutagenesis are as follows (changed nucleotides indicated in boldface type): ΔGS1 (first glycosylation site from the 5′-end), primer 1A (5′-TGGAACATAAATCAAGATACCTGG-3′) and primer 1B (5′-CCAGGTATCTTGATTTATGTTCCA-3′); ΔGS2, primer 2A (5′-TTCCAAAGAAACCAAAAAACTGTCTTC-3′) and primer 2B (5′-GAAGACAGTTTTTTGTTCCAGAACTGT-3′); ΔGS3, primer 3A (5′-ACAGTTCTGGAACAAAGCACAAGTTAT-3′) and primer 3B (5′-ATAACTTGTGCTTTGTTCCAGAACTGT-3′); ΔGS4, primer 4A (5′-CCTGGGAGGCCAACAGTCTGGGG-3′) and primer 4B (5′-CCCCAGACTGTTGGCCTCCCAGG-3′); ΔGS5, primer 5A (5′-AGATGTGTCTGCAGCGCACCAGC-3′) and primer 5B (5′-GCTGGTGCGCTGCAGACACATCT-3′); ΔGS6, primer 6A (5′-CCAGCCAAGAGCAAATCTCATTTGA-3′) and primer 6B (5′-TCAAATGAGATTTGCTCTTGGCTGG-3′). About 8 × 105 cells supplemented with DMEM and 10% FCS were plated in 25-cm2 culture dishes the day before transfection. Transfections were carried out using the SuperFect (Qiagen) transfection reagent with 5 μg of purified plasmid DNA for each dish. The cells were treated with DNA-SuperFect complexes in serum-free Opti-MEM (Life Science) medium for 5–6 h. After removal of the transfection medium, the cells were supplemented with DMEM containing 10% FCS, grown for an additional 48 h, and then either used for metabolic labeling experiments or harvested and assayed for hAC activity. The hAC activity of transfected and control cells was assayed using the synthetic substrateN-lauroylsphingosine in the presence of detergents as described previously (20Bernardo K. Hurwitz R. Zenk T. Desnick R.J. Ferlinz K. Schuchman E.H. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11098-11102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In brief, the cell extracts were incubated with the substrate, and after extraction of cellular lipids with methanol, the free amino groups were derivatized withortho-phthalaldehyde. The total amount of free sphingosine was determined using a fluorescence detector after elution by high pressure liquid chromatography. C-16/C-18-sphinganine was used as an internal standard for quantification. Protein was determined according to the BCA method (42Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermnason G.T. Mallia N.M. Gartner F.H. Prorenzano M.D. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk C.D. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 75-85Crossref Scopus (18647) Google Scholar). Cultured human fibroblasts were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine and harvested after various time periods. The hAC protein was immunoprecipitated using a polyclonal chicken anti-hAC serum raised against recombinant hAC produced by a baculovirus/insect cell expression system (not shown) and separated by SDS-PAGE. Fluorographic images of the respective gels indicate that hAC is synthesized as a precursor protein with an apparent molecular mass of 53–55 kDa (Fig. 1 a). Time resolution of this early process by pulse/chase experiments revealed the initial biosynthesis of a precursor polypeptide pair of 53 and 55 kDa, respectively (Fig. 1 b). Within approximately 2 h, the intensity of the 53-kDa form increases at the expense of a decreasing amount of 55-kDa precursor, and the mature heterodimeric form of hAC becomes detectable (Fig. 1, a and b). As formerly reported on hAC cDNA-transfected COS cells (21Koch J. Gaertner S. Li C.M. Quintern L.E. Bernardo K. Levran O. Schnabel D. Desnick R.J. Schuchman E.H. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33110-33115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), proteolytic cleavage of the common precursor polypeptides results in the formation of both α-subunit (∼13 kDa) and β-subunits (∼40 kDa). Both subunits of mature hAC are linked by disulfide bridges as depicted by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions (Fig.2 a, right panel). Complete processing of the hAC precursor is accomplished ∼12 h after the beginning of biosynthesis, and the half-life of mature heterodimeric hAC is estimated to be above 20 h (not shown). Different from most other soluble lysosomal proteins, secretion of hAC from fibroblasts and even transfected COS-cells (as indicated below) was significantly delayed and almost negligible. Only small amounts of the hAC precursor with reduced apparent molecular mass (46–48 kDa) were observed after an initial lag phase of up to 8 h from biosynthesis (Fig. 2 b). Mature heterodimeric hAC was not detectable in the culture medium of radiolabeled normal fibroblasts.Figure 2Biosynthesis of hAC. Cells were pulsed with [35S]methionine/cysteine for 1 h and chased for the indicated times. The hAC from the cell extracts (A) and the culture medium (B) was precipitated using a polyclonal chicken anti-hAC antiserum. Immunoprecipitates were separated on a 12.5% SDS-Tricine PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions (A) or reducing conditions (B) and analyzed by fluorography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Analysis of the N-linked carbohydrate structures on different hAC forms from fibroblasts was carried out by deglycosylation of hAC immunoprecipitates with either Endo H or PNGase F. Complete removal of oligosaccharide chains reduces the apparent molecular mass of the hAC precursor from 53–55 to 42 kDa and that of the β-subunit from 40 to 28 kDa (Fig. 3). The α-subunit, which misses any potential N-glycosylation site is, as expected, not glycosylated. The apparent molecular mass of 13 kDa remains unchanged after PNGase F treatment. Removal of high mannose/hybrid carbohydrate chains by Endo H treatment reduces the apparent molecular weight of the hAC precursor to 44 kDa and that of the β-subunit to 30 kDa (not shown) identical to our results from hAC-transfected COS cells (see Fig. 9).Figure 9Deglycosylation of the wild-type and mutant hAC. The transfected COS-1 cells were labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine (30 min) and chased for 12 h. The hAC immunoprecipitates were treated with PNGase F or Endo H and separated by SDS-PAGE.

No differences in the apparent molecular weight and amount of hAC precursor, synthesized during a 1-h pulse period, were detected in I-cell disease fibroblasts when compared with normal fibroblasts. However, immunoprecipitates obtained at different chase times indicate that there is a significant loss of intracellular hAC material in I-cell disease fibroblasts. As early as 5 h after biosynthesis, hAC polypeptides become undetectable in the cell homogenate (Fig.4 a). Furthermore, I-cell disease fibroblasts are not capable of processing the hAC precursor protein into the mature heterodimeric enzyme, suggesting that the uncoupling of the intracellular mannose 6-phosphate receptor targeting pathway leads to missorting and secretion of hAC precursor. The hAC is secreted in the form of the 53–55-kDa polypeptide and can be recovered from the culture medium of I-cell disease fibroblasts as early as 2 h after biosynthesis (Fig. 4 b). The apparent molecular mass of the secreted hAC corresponds to the molecular mass of the intracellular precursor but not to that of the regularly secreted hAC (∼46–48 kDa). However, deglycosylation of both secretory forms with PNGase F results in molecular masses of 42 kDa (Fig. 4 c). In contrast to the intracellular hAC from I-cell disease fibroblasts, small but notable amounts of mature heterodimeric hAC are detected in the cell culture medium of I-cell disease fibroblasts (Fig. 4 c). This maturation might be due to extracellular proteolysis by acidic proteases, which are also secreted as a consequence of impaired lysosomal sorting in I-cell disease fibroblasts. In order to uncouple the intracellular mannose-6-phosphate pathway, radiolabeled normal fibroblasts were preincubated with the lysosomotropic agent NH4Cl (10 mm). Under these conditions, hAC processing closely resembled the one observed in I-cell disease fibroblasts: increased secretion of hAC at the expense of intracellular hAC precursor and failure to process hAC into the mature heterodimeric enzyme (Fig. 4,a and b). However, in contrast to secretory hAC from I-cell disease fibroblasts, NH4Cl-induced secretory hAC had the same apparent molecular mass as the regularly secreted hAC (∼46–48 kDa; Fig. 4, b and c). In order to investigate the potential role of the M6PR pathway for the internalization of extracellular hAC, radiol"

As a death receptor (DR), p75NTR belongs to the NGF/TNF receptor superfamily. To date, seven DRs have been identified that contain a conserved death domain (DD) (18Singh A. Ni J. Aggarwal B.B. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1998; 18: 439-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This domain has been shown to mediate apoptotic signaling by mediating homotypic interactions with adaptor proteins (19Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5169) Google Scholar). Although the p75NTR DD displays all the structural hallmarks of a DD, no homotypic interaction partners have been identified so far (20Huang B. Eberstadt M. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 384: 638-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). In contrast, the Fas and TNFR1 death pathways are well understood and involve receptor activation by their cognate ligands, FasL and TNF-α, respectively. Upon activation, the adaptor proteins FADD and FADD/TRADD are recruited and activate caspase 8. Activated caspase 8 initiates proteolytic activities of other downstream caspases like caspase 3 and caspase 6, which then cleave specific substrates resulting in apoptotic morphology and DNA fragmentation (19Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5169) Google Scholar). The apoptotic signaling mechanism of p75NTR is not understood in such detail. However, caspase inhibitors and Bcl-XL inhibit the process suggesting that the downstream components are conserved (21Coulson E.J. Reid K. Barrett G.L. Bartlett P.F. J. Biol.

However, it is currently not understood how any of these molecules are able to transmit the signal to the apoptotic effector machinery. Cellular systems have been instrumental in elucidating signaling from other death receptors such as FAS and TNFR1. To undertake similar studies, we developed a cellular system as a tool to study p75NTR-induced apoptotic signaling. p75NTRreceptor expression in ST14A cells was sufficient to induce cell death without the confounding effect of co-stimuli. ST14A cells are conditionally immortalized neurons derived from the striatum and retain the expression of multiple markers characteristic for neurons, but in addition they are highly transfectable and immortalized at the permissive temperature (30Cattaneo E. Conti L. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 53: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). By using this system we show that the DD is essential for the initiation of apoptosis. Truncation mutants without DD are inactive and dominantly interfere with p75NTR signaling. The similarities to other DRs also included the inhibition by the viral protein E8, activation of caspase 9, and multiple downstream caspases. However, caspase 8 was not activated, and FADD DN did not have any inhibitory effect. Hence, p75NTR induces apoptosis in ST14A cells through a similar molecular mechanism to that of other DRs but via different adaptors and apical caspases. Zeocin and ponasterone were obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA); hygromycin B was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals; LipofectAMINE was from Life Technologies, Inc.; and NGF was from Harlan Bioproducts (Madison, WI). Caspase substrates were from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The BrdUrd kit was from BD PharMingen (San Diego, CA). Propidium iodide (PI), poly-l-lysine hydrobromide, protein G-Sepharose, α-FLAG M2 antibody, and anti-mouse IgG fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate (Fc-specific) were from Sigma. α-NGF receptor polyclonal antibody was from Promega (Madison, WI). Secondary antibodies and ECL reagents were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. ST14A are striatal neurons conditionally immortalized by transfection with a temperature-sensitive form of the SV40 large T-antigen (30Cattaneo E. Conti L. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 53: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). ST14A and 293 human embryonic kidney cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mm non-essential amino acids, 2 mml-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin in 5% CO2 at 33 °C (for ST14A cells) or 37 °C (for 293 cells). Human neuroblastoma cells, SK-N-BE, were grown at 37 °C in minimum Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 nutrient mixture (1:1) with the same additions as for ST14A cells. Schwann cells were isolated from sciatic nerve of neonatal rats, and single cell suspension was achieved by trypsin and collagenase and cultured with 10% fetal bovine serum, 6 mml-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, 20 μg/ml pituitary extract, and 2 μm forskolin on poly-l-lysine-coated tissue culture dishes at 37 °C. A431 carcinoma cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (1:1) containing 2.0 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, 0.25 mg/ml amphotericin B, and 5% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C. The p75NTR constructs shown in Fig.1 were obtained by PCR and cloned into the ecdysone-inducible mammalian expression vector pIND-Hygro (Invitrogen) using a human p75NTR plasmid kindly provided by Moses V. Chao (New York University). All constructs were verified by sequencing and ponasterone-inducible expression in 293 cells. For stable expression, p75NTR constructs were transfected together with the ecdysone receptor plasmid pVgRXR. Cells expressing p75NTR (ST14A-p75ind) were selected by growth in hygromycin B (0.625 mg/ml) and zeocin (0.625 mg/ml) and screened for expression by immunoblotting. Total RNA (1 μg) was isolated from the different cell lines using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). After reverse transcription, cDNA was amplified using superscript one-step RT-PCR system (Life Technologies, Inc.). For RT-PCR, the following primers were used: rat p75NTR, 5′-AGCCAACCAGACCGTGTGTG-3′ and 5′-TTGCAGCTGTTCCACCTCTT-3′ (31Suter-Crazzolara C. Lachmund A. Arab S.F. Unsicker K. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 43: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar); rat TrkA, 5′-GCTGACCAATGAGACCATGCGGCAT-3′ and 5′-GTGAGCAGCTCTGCCTCACGATGG-3′ (31Suter-Crazzolara C. Lachmund A. Arab S.F. Unsicker K. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 43: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar); rat GAPDH, 5′-ATGGTGAAGGTCGGTGTCAACGGA-3′ and 5′-TTACT- CCTTGGAGGCCATGTAGGC-3′. The assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI). About 5 × 104 cells grown in a 96-well plate in 100 μl of medium were either left untreated or treated with ponasterone. Twenty μl of combined MTS/PBS solution was added, and the cells were put in the incubator for 1 h before reading the absorbance at 490 nm. About 5 × 106ST14A cells treated with ponasterone for different times were harvested by DNAZol (MRC, Ohio). DNA was purified by EtOH precipitation. The precipitate was dissolved in H2O, digested for 30 min at 37 °C with 20 μg/ml DNase-free RNase, and analyzed by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel. About 5 × 106 ST14A cells were treated with ponasterone or left untreated. Attached cells were harvested in 135 mm potassium chloride, 15 mm sodium citrate at 37 °C for 5 min. The resulting cell suspensions were pooled with cells in the supernatant, washed with 1% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum in PBS, blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min, and incubated with α-FLAG or α-p75NTR antibody (1:100) for 1.5 h and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (1:2000) for 1 h. All processing was performed at 4 °C. The cells were analyzed on a Beckman flow cytometer. About 5 × 106 cells were collected in lysis buffer (20 mmTris, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA with 5 mmNa2VO4, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) on ice and directly analyzed by Western blot or immunoprecipitated after clearing at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The soluble lysates were incubated with the relevant antibodies for 3 h, and immune complexes were harvested with protein G-Sepharose beads for 1 h, followed by three washes in lysis buffer, and boiling in sample buffer. Eluted proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by Western blot (1:1000 dilution of primary and 1:10000 of secondary antibodies). About 1 × 106 ST14A-p75ind cells were grown on glass coverslips coated with gelatin and co-transfected with plasmids expressing the indicated proteins (1 μg) and GFP as a transfection marker (0.25 μg). After transfection, cells were treated with ponasterone for 48 h, washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, incubated for 10 min in 0.5 μg/ml PI, and washed with PBS. Transfected (green) cells were scored by fluorescence microscopy for chromatin condensation, and nuclear fragmentation was revealed by intense PI staining. About 1 × 106ST14A-p75ind cells were transfected as above and treated with ponasterone for 48 h. Attached cells and matching supernatant were pooled, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and submitted to terminal deoxytransferase-mediated BrdUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) using phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-BrdUrd monoclonal antibody flow cytometer following the instructions of the manufacturer. Labeled cells were analyzed on a Beckman flow cytometer. Cell extracts and enzyme assays were performed as described previously (32Suzuki A. Iwasaki M. Wagai N. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 233: 48-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 106 cells were harvested in PBS and homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer in extraction buffer (10 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EGTA, 25% glycerol, 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, soybean trypsin inhibitor, and pepstatin, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) with 40 strokes. Twenty μg of lysate proteins in a 100-μl final volume were incubated with 0.2 mm of the following caspase substrates at 37 °C for 3 h: caspase 1, Ac-YVAD-AFC; caspase 3, Ac-DEVD-AFC; caspase 6, Z-VEID-AFC; caspase 8, Ac-IETD-AFC; and caspase 9, Ac-LEHD-MCA. Caspase substrates incubated in non-ponasterone-treated extracts were used as control. Released AFC or MCA was read in a cytofluor II fluorescence multiwell plate reader (excitation at 400 nm and emission at 505 nm for AFC-labeled substrates or excitation at 360 nm and emission at 460 nm for the MCA substrate). The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit from Promega (Madison, WI) was used to determine NGF in the media according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Cells were incubated in serum-free media supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin for 24 and 48 h prior to the assay. StatView software was used to calculate significant differences by analysis of variance algorithm. Error bars indicate S.E. Multiple functional studies on p75NTR have been performed using primary neuronal cells and transgenic or knockout models (33Casaccia-Bonnefil P. Gu C. Khursigara G. Chao M.V. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1999; 45: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). These studies show that p75NTR engages multiple and sometimes opposing signaling pathways, depending on the cell type, microenvironment, and stage of development (10Barrett G.L. Prog. Neurobiol. (New York). 2000; 61: 205-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Invariably, cellular systems developed to study p75NTR function and mechanisms show only a subset of the responses attributed to p75NTR signaling. In search of a model for the apoptotic signaling of p75NTR, we investigated the ST14A cell line. These cells are derived from the striatum of embryonic day 14 rats and are conditionally immortalized by expression of the temperature-sensitive mutant of the SV40 large T antigen (30Cattaneo E. Conti L. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 53: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). ST14A cells acquire antigenic and electrophysiological properties characteristic of mature neurons and become postmitotic at the non-permissive temperature (39 °C) (34Ehrlich M.E. Conti L. Toselli M. Taglietti L. Fiorillo E. Taglietti V. Ivkovic S. Guinea B. Tranberg A. Sipione S. Rigamonti D. Cattaneo E. Exp. Neurol. 2001; 167: 215-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Because these neuronal cells are susceptible to a variety of apoptotic stimuli, including the death receptor TNFR1 (35Rigamonti D. Bauer J.H. De-Fraja C. Conti L. Sipione S. Sciorati C. Clementi E. Hackam A. Hayden M.R. Li Y. Cooper J.K. Ross C.A. Govoni S. Vincenz C. Cattaneo E. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3705-3713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated their responses to p75NTR. Stable ST14A expressing p75NTR lines (ST14A-p75ind) were established using an ecdysone-inducible system to avert problems with the pro-apoptotic activity of p75NTR during the selection process. This two-plasmid system puts the gene of interest under the control of the Ecdysone/glucocorticoid response element promoter. The ecdysone receptor is transcribed from the co-transfected pVgRXR plasmid, and expression of the gene of interest is induced by addition of the ecdysone homologue ponasterone. Expression of the two NGF receptors in parental ST14A as well as lines carrying an expression vector for p75NTR was assayed by RT-PCR (Fig.2 A). Parental ST14A cells were negative for p75NTR but expressed similar levels of TrkA as the carcinoma cell line A431. Exposing these cells to ponasterone had no effect on the levels of NGF receptors (lanes 3 and4). Analysis of the ST14A-p75ind cells revealed expression of p75NTR RNA both in a pool and two randomly selected clones (lanes 6–11). Robust induction of p75NTR by ponasterone was observed after 15 PCR cycles (lanes 5 and 6). Amplification of the RT product for 30 cycles also yielded a band in the absence of ponasterone indicating some leakiness of the promoter (lanes 7 and9). The levels of expression were lower than endogenous p75NTR levels in Schwann cells (lane 11). TrkA levels remained unchanged in the transfectants with or without ponasterone. These results indicate that the ST14A clone used here did not express endogenous p75NTR and therefore represent a convenient null background for the introduction of wild type or mutants. Addition of ponasterone to ST14A-p75ind cells produced dramatic cell killing as demonstrated by measuring viability with the MTS assay (Fig. 2 B). After a 2-day treatment with ponasterone at 33 °C about 75% of mitochondrial activity was lost in freshly established ST14A-p75ind compared with the untreated cells. The cells detach from the substrate, round up, and develop cell membrane blebs during the treatment (not shown). However, ST14A-p75ind cells that were kept in culture for extended periods gradually became resistant to ponasterone at 33 °C (passage 40). Ponasterone was not cytotoxic when added to parental ST14A cells. To demonstrate expression of the exogenous protein on the cell surface, FACS analysis was performed on p75NTR-FLAG transfectants (Fig. 2 C). The epitope tag in this construct is engineered immediately C-terminal to the signal peptide (Fig. 1). Non-permeabilized cells were stained with α-FLAG antibodies with or without ponasterone treatment. Fluorescence in the absence of ponasterone was identical to the background control. After overnight incubation with ponasterone, increased staining of cells with α-FLAG was measured. In contrast, late passage cells did not show any expression at 33 °C. However, at 39 °C expression as well as sensitization to cell killing by ponasterone was restored (not shown). To avoid these confounding factors of prolonged culture all subsequent experiments were performed on cells passaged less than 20 times unless indicated. Because in some systems NGF is able to induce cell death by binding to p75NTR, we investigated whether addition of this neurotrophin affects the cell death response in ST14A-p75ind. The loss of viability of ST14A-p75ind upon ponasterone treatment was not affected by incubation in serum-free media indicating that the process was not controlled by serum-derived factors (Fig.3 A). Similarly, cell killing induced by ponasterone was neither enhanced nor inhibited by the addition of NGF (10 ng/ml) as measured by MTS assay (Fig.3 A). To investigate a possible autocrine mechanism, NGF levels in the media of parental and ST14A-p75ind were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. After 48 h of incubation of parental ST14A cells 75.25 ± 19 and 39.38 ± 17.41 pg/ml NGF was detected in the absence and presence of ponasterone, respectively. The p75NTR transfectants produced similarly low levels of NGF (29.5 ± 4.91 pg/ml). These levels of NGF are in the picomolar range well below the nanomolar concentrations required for p75NTR activation. Therefore, a NGF autocrine mechanism cannot account for the p75NTR-induced cell death in ST14A-p75ind. NF-κB activation in ST14A-p75ind cells was also measured. No significant induction of this pathway could be observed using luciferase reporter assays (not shown), suggesting that p75NTR cannot activate NF-κB in these cells or that the strong pro-apoptotic response masks other signals that potentially emanate from this receptor. The intracellular domain of p75NTR contains a well conserved DD whose role in initiating apoptosis has been disputed (21Coulson E.J. Reid K. Barrett G.L. Bartlett P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16387-16391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar,36Coulson E.J. Reid K. Baca M. Shipham K.A. Hulett S.M. Kilpatrick T.J. Bartlett P.F. J. Biol.

To address this issue in the ST14A system, we established ST14A-p75ind lines expressing FLAG-tagged full-length and deletion mutants (Fig. 1). Deletions of the DD (ΔDD) and the whole intracellular domain (ΔICD) were tested. Expression of both the ΔDD and ΔICD had no effect on cell viability similar to parental ST14A cells (Fig. 3 A). Levels of expression were measured by immunoblotting with α-FLAG antibodies (Fig. 3 B). Ponasterone induced the expression of a doublet band at ∼75 kDa in the FL transfectants. This is the molecular weight reported for the glycosylated form of endogenous p75NTR (37Johnson D. Lanahan A. Buck C.R. Sehgal A. Morgan C. Mercer E. Bothwell M. Chao M. Cell. 1986; 47: 545-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation with p75NTR-specific antibodies revealed that the levels of p75NTR expressed were slightly lower than endogenous p75NTR in Schwann cells. A similar level of expression was seen when lysates from cells expressing the ΔDD and ΔICD constructs were probed together with the full-length p75NTR lysates. Doublet bands at ∼65 and 45 kDa were induced by ponasterone with the ΔDD and ΔICD, respectively. The transfectants expressing the truncation mutants were also analyzed by FACS for cell surface expression using the α-p75NTRantibody. More than 75% of the cells stained positive after overnight incubation with ponasterone (not shown). Therefore, the failure of the ΔDD and ΔICD to induce apoptosis is due to the inability of these mutants to signal cell death and not due to lack of expression or inappropriate cellular localization. In these cells, therefore, deletion of the DD impairs the ability of p75NTR to signal cell death. Shown here are the results from transfection pools, but the analysis of 7 ΔDD and 3 ΔICD expressing clones produced identical results. The size distribution of DNA recovered from ST14A cells was analyzed in order to establish whether p75NTR-induced cell death proceeded by an apoptotic mechanism (Fig. 4 A). Treatment of the ST14A-p75ind cells with ponasterone induced degradation of DNA into a pattern of ∼200-base pair periodicity that was particularly distinct after 48 h when most cells have acquired apoptotic morphology. This degradation was not observed without ponasterone treatment. Such an oligonucleosomal pattern is a prominent feature of apoptosis and therefore indicates that p75NTR is able to"

Among these active neuropeptides, we have characterized the antibacterial and antifungal activities of vasostatin-I, CGA-(1–76), the highly conserved N-terminal fragment resulting from the natural processing of CGA (8Metz-Boutigue M.H.

Antimicrobial agents are classified as inhibitors for microbial cell metabolism (9Bartizal K. Abruzzo G. Trainor C. Krupa D. Nollstadt K. Schmatz D. Schwartz R. Hammond M.

Nippon Rinsho. 1997; 55: 1155-1160PubMed Google Scholar). The present work was carried out to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in the antifungal activity of the C-terminal region of vasostatin-I; we sought the most active fragment and found the CGA-(47–66) peptide to be the shortest potent one. This peptide was named chromofungin. The three-dimensional structure of chromofungin has been obtained from 1H NMR analysis, indicating that it adopts a helical structure. The interaction of chromofungin with fungal membranes was analyzed using biophysical measurements of the penetration of these peptides within lecithin monolayers (12Maget-Dana R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1462: 109-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Confocal laser microscopy on several fungi and yeast cells using rhodamine-labeled chromofungin showed the ability of this peptide to cross through cell wall and plasma membrane and to accumulate in microorganisms. Since previous studies have shown that the CGA N-terminal region interacts with calmodulin (CaM) in the presence of calcium (13Yoo S.-H. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6134-6140Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), the sequence of chromofungin was compared with those of several CaM-binding enzymes and found to display common features. This property led us to study the effect of chromofungin on CaM-dependent enzymes choosing calcineurin (CaN) phosphatase activity. Peptides were synthesized in our laboratory on an Applied Biosystems 432A peptide synthesizer SYNERGY, using the stepwise solid-phase synthetic approach (7Lugardon K. Raffner R. Goumon Y. Corti A.

Chromofungin corresponds to the bovine CGA-(47–66) sequence RILSILRHQNLLKELQDLAL. For control experiments, a chromofungin-derived peptide with two proline residues in positions 61 and 64 and a bovine CGB-(602–626) peptide corresponding to the sequence ELENLAAMDLELQKIAEKFSGTRRG have been prepared. For the fluorescence study, peptides were dissolved in diisopropylethylamine and labeled by the addition of 5,6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole/o-benzotriazol-1-yl-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate as coupling agent. Filamentous fungi were grown on a five-cereal medium, and spores were harvested as previously described (18Bulet P. Dimarcq J.L. Hetru C. Lagueux M. Charlet M. Hegy G. van Dorsselaer A. Hoffman J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14893-14897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The following filamentous fungi strains were used:Neurospora crassa (CBS 327–54), Aspergillus fumigatus, Alternaria brassicola (MUCL 20297),Nectria hematococca (160.2.2), Fusarium culmorum(MUCL 30162), Fusarium oxyporum (MUCL 909), andTrichophyton mentagrophytes. Yeast cells were precultured on a Sabouraud medium, and four strains were tested: Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Candida glabrata, and Cryptococcus neoformans. In order to test the antifungal activity of CGA-(47–66), spores (final concentration, 104 spores/ml) were suspended in a growth medium containing potato dextrose broth (Difco; in half-strength) and yeast cells in Sabouraud medium, with starting absorbance at 620 nm of 0.001. These media were supplemented with tetracycline (10 μg/ml) and cefotaxime (0.1 μg/ml). Fungal growth was assessed after an appropriate incubation period (24 or 40 h at 30 °C). Aliquots of peptide extract (20 μl) were incubated in microtiter plates with 80 μl of fungal spores or yeast cultures. Growth of fungi was monitored microscopically and evaluated by measuring the culture absorbance at 595 nm (A 595) using a microplate reader. Yeast cells growth was assessed by the increase ofA 620. A lyophilized sample of 4 mg of CGA-(47–66) was dissolved in 600 μl of aqueous 20 mm sodium acetate-d 6 buffer (pH 5.0), 50 mmKCl with the addition of deuterated trifluoroethanol (TFE-d 3) to yield 50% (v/v) solution. The final peptide concentration was 3 mm. The 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate was used as an internal chemical shift reference (0.00 ppm). All 1H NMR measurements were carried out at 288 K at 500 MHz on a Bruker AMX500 spectrometer. Standard two-dimensional proton scalar and dipolar coupling experiments were carried out in phase-sensitive mode using the STATES-TPPI (time-proportional phase incrementation) scheme (19Marion D. Ikura M. Tschudin R. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1989; 85: 393-399Google Scholar), with a spectral width of 6009 Hz in both dimensions and a relaxation delay of 3 s. Water signal suppression was achieved using a WATERGATE sequence (20Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3539) Google Scholar), together with a very low power presaturation pulse on the water frequency. Amino acid proton spin systems were mostly assigned using a homonuclear Hartman Hahn (21Shaka A.J. Lee C.J. Pines A. J. Magn. Reson. 1988; 77: 274-293Google Scholar) experiment with a 60-ms DIPSI2 (decoupling in the presence of scalar interaction) isotropic mixing pulse sequence. Sequential assignment was achieved using two NOESY spectra recorded with mixing times of 150 and 250 ms. Processing was performed on an IBM RS/600 computer using the program FELIX version 2.10 (Biosym Inc.) and on an SGI INDY R5000 computer using UXNMR software (Bruker). Data were zero-filled and processed by apodization with a 90°-shifted sine squared bell window in both dimensions before Fourier transformation. The final size of matrices was 2048 × 1024 points for all spectra. The computer model was obtained using the Molmol program (22Koradi R. Billeter M. Wütrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar). Penetration experiments of peptides within artificial monolayer membrane (12Maget-Dana R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1462: 109-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar) were performed at constant area (19.6 cm2) in a thermostated (T = 20 ± 0.2 °C) glass vessel equipped with a short vertical tube and containing 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, as a subphase (volume 12 ml). The vessel was put on a miniature Variomag stirring system, and the whole device was enclosed in a plexiglass box. The lipids were spread at the air/water interface from an ethanol solution to give the desired initial surface pressure. Aliquots of a peptide stock solution (concentration in water: 10−5mres, expressed in amino acid residue/liter) were successively injected in the subphase under the lipid film through the vertical tube, and the bulk phase was gently stirred for a few minutes. The surface tension was measured with a Wilhelmy platinum plate hung to a Q11 balance (Schenk SA). The accuracy of surface pressure measurements was ±0.2 mN/meter. The poly-l-lysine-coated chambered coverglass system (× 8, Lab Tek, 0.8 cm2) was covered with 190 μl of medium (one-half potato dextrose broth or Sabouraud) containing A. fumigatus or A. brassicola (104 spores/ml) or C. albicans(A 620 = 0.001) at 30 °C during 24 or 40 h. Then rhodamine-labeled synthetic peptides (CGA-(47–66)R and CGB-(602–626)R) were added to culture medium (30 °C). After the incubation time as indicated, chambers were washed with fresh culture medium and subsequently treated for 90 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.12 m sodium/potassium phosphate, pH 7.2. After several rinses with phosphate-buffered saline, chambers were covered with Elvanol-Mowiol. Fluorescence staining was monitored with a Zeiss laser scanning microscope (LSM 410) equipped with a planapo oil (× 63) immersion lens (numerical aperture = 1.4). Rhodamine emission was excited using the helium/neon laser 543-nm line, and the emission signal was filtered with a Zeiss long pass 595-nm filter. Fungi were subjected to optical serial sectioning (0.2–0.3 μm) to produce images in thex-y plane. Each optical section was scanned eight times to obtain an average image. Images were recorded digitally in a 768 × 576-pixel format. To measure the calcineurin phosphatase activity, we have used the BIOMOL GREENTM assay kit (TEBU), including a 96-well microtiter plate format with all reagents supplied by the manufacturer. The RII phosphopeptide substrate (DVPIPGRFDRRVpSVAAE), is the most efficient peptide substrate known for calcineurin (23Martin B. Pallen C.J. Wang J.H. Graves D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14932-14937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Donella-Deana A. Krinks M.H. Ruzzene M. Klee C. Pinna L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The detection of free phosphate released is based on the classic malachite green assay. Recently, we have shown that vasostatin-I, the CGA N-terminal 1–76 peptide, displays antibacterial and antifungal activities (7Lugardon K. Raffner R. Goumon Y. Corti A. Delmas A. Bulet P. Aunis D. Metz-Boutigue M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10745-10753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). After digestion of recombinant human vasostatin-I with endoproteinase Glu-C, the shortest antifungal peptide corresponding to CGA-(47–60) was isolated and identified (7Lugardon K. Raffner R. Goumon Y. Corti A. Delmas A. Bulet P. Aunis D. Metz-Boutigue M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10745-10753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In order to investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in the antifungal activity of vasostatin-I, several other synthetic peptides have been prepared with various CGA-41/47–60/70 sequences, and antifungal assays revealed that the most active ones were CGA-(47–60) and CGA-(47–70) (7Lugardon K. Raffner R. Goumon Y. Corti A. Delmas A. Bulet P. Aunis D. Metz-Boutigue M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10745-10753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Then the shortest active peptides with maximum global hydrophobicity and amphipathic features were synthesized and tested. As shown here, two peptides were found to be the most efficient; they correspond to CGA-(47–70) and CGA-(47–66) (Table I). These two peptides are similarly active against a variety of filamentous fungi, including N. crassa, A. fumigatus, A. brassicola, N. hematococca, F. culmorum, F. oxyporum, andT. mentagrophytes in the concentration range from 5 to 30 μm. Furthermore, when tested against the growth of several strains of yeasts, CGA-(47–70) inhibited completely C. albicans and C. neoformans at a concentration of 200 and 150 μm, respectively, while it inhibited C. tropicalis by 70% at 200 μm. Interestingly, the second synthetic fragment CGA-(47–66) was more active, since it inhibited completely the growth of C. albicans, C. tropicalis, and C. neoformans at a concentration of 50 μm; it was inactive against the growth of C. glabrata at 200 μm.Table IAntifungal activity of the two synthetic peptides CGA-(47–70) and CGA-(47–66) chromofunginSpeciesMIC100 of CGA synthetic peptides1-aMIC100, the minimal concentration completely inhibiting filamentous fungi and yeast cell growth, in the standardized conditions as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Sequences are as follows: CGA-(47–70), RILSILRHQNLLKELQOLALQGAL; CGA-(47–66), RILSILRHQNLLKELQOLAL.CGA-(47–70)CGA-(47–66)μmFilamentous fungi N. crassa55 A. fumigatus3030 A. brassicola1010 N. haematococca77 F. culmorum1010 F. oxyporum3030 T. mentagrophytes3030Yeast cells C. albicans20050 C. tropicalis2001-b70% of growth inhibition is obtained at a peptide concentration of 200 μm.50 C. glabrata—1-c—, no detectable activity.— C. neoformans150501-a MIC100, the minimal concentration completely inhibiting filamentous fungi and yeast cell growth, in the standardized conditions as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Sequences are as follows: CGA-(47–70), RILSILRHQNLLKELQOLALQGAL; CGA-(47–66), RILSILRHQNLLKELQOLAL.1-b 70% of growth inhibition is obtained at a peptide concentration of 200 μm.1-c —, no detectable activity. Open table in a new tab Since the shortest synthetic peptide CGA-(47–66) displayed the highest antifungal activity, it was used thereafter to investigate the molecular mechanisms. This synthetic peptide has been named chromofungin. The first step was to determine the three-dimensional structure of this peptide in water/trifluoroethanol solution (50/50) using 1H NMR spectroscopy. The folding of peptides in the presence of trifluoroethanol is often encountered for peptides able to interact with membranes and has been widely used to study their three-dimensional properties. Among antibacterial peptides reported so far, trifluoroethanol has been used to study the structure of cecropin A (25Holak T.A. Engström A. Kraulis P.J. Lindeberg G. Benneich H. Jones T.A. Groneneborn A.M. Clore G.M. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7620-7629Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), pardaxin P-2 (26Zagorski M.G. Norman D.G. Barrow C.J. Iwashita T. Tachibana K. Patel D.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8009-8017Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), magainin 2 (27Marion D. Zasloff M. Bax A. FEBS Lett. 1988; 227: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), and ranalexin (28Vignal E. Chavanieu A. Roch P. Chiche L. Grassy G. Calas B. Aumelas A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In addition, comparative study of 1H NMR structures of magainin 2 and ranalexin in the presence of phospholipid micelles confirmed the helical structure previously found in trifluoroethanol/water solution (28Vignal E. Chavanieu A. Roch P. Chiche L. Grassy G. Calas B. Aumelas A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 29Gesell J. Zasloff M. Opella S.J. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 9: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Two regions of the 150-ms NOESY spectrum are shown in Fig.1. They correspond to the fingerprint region, which contains the dipolar correlations between amide and Hα protons (Fig. 1 A) and correlations between amide protons of different residues (Fig. 1 B). In addition, to sequential NOEs between the Hα of one residue and the amide proton of the following one, several medium range NOEs could be observed between the Hα of a residue and the amide proton 3–4 residues toward the C terminus αn(i + 3), αn(i + 4) for several residues along the sequence. This feature is a clear indication that the peptide adopts an α-helical structure in solution. The analysis of the amide-amide proton region of the NOESY map (Fig. 1 B) shows many strong sequential and medium range HN-HN cross-peaks (nn(i + 1), nn(i + 2),nn(i + 3)), which is expected in helical conformations. All sequential and medium range NOEs, which have been observed for the backbone protons of the CGA-(47–66) peptide are summarized in Fig.2. The distribution of αn(i + 3) contacts along the sequence shows that the helical conformation extends through the entire peptide. The gap observed for residues located around Leu61 is due to severe overlap between the Hα protons resonance frequencies of residues 59, 61, and 62 (Fig. 1 A). However, the observation of NOEs between the Hα of the aspartate 63 and the amide proton of the C-terminal Leu66 indicates that the C terminus of the peptide is folded into an α-helical conformation. A ribbon diagram of the average structure of the CGA-(47–66) peptide is shown in Fig.3. This representation shows the amphipathic helical character of the C-terminal part of the sequence (Arg53–Leu66). It is shown that hydrophobic leucine residues in positions 57, 58, 61, 64, and 66 are located on one side (blue ribbon), while four polar residues (Arg53, Lys59, Glu60, and Asp63) are aligned on the other side (red ribbon). This feature is less pronounced in the N-terminal side of the α-helix, where a rather hydrophobic segment (Ile48, Leu49, Ile51) is followed by a continuous stretch of hydrophilic residues from arginine 53 to asparagine 56. In Fig. 4, the representation of the helical wheel corresponding to the N- and C-terminal fragments of chromofungin (CGA-(47–56) (A) and CGA-(53–66) (B), respectively) emphasizes the importance of the region 53–66 for the amphipathic character.Figure 4Helical wheel projection of the N- and C-terminal fragments of chromofungin according to the PLOT.A/HEL program. A, CGA-(47–56); B, CGA-(53–65). Hydrophobic residues Ile and Leu are in boldface type. Underlined Leu61 and Leu64 were changed in proline residues to test the importance of the amphipathic character of chromofungin for the antifungal activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Chromofungin, in the concentration range of 1–10 μm, is highly active against a variety of filamentous fungi, and it completely inhibits the growth of N. crassa at 5 μm (Table I). In order to examine the importance of this amphipathic C-terminal sequence, we have tested the antifungal activity of the chromofungin-derived peptide with two proline residues in place of Leu61 and Leu64. These two proline residues disrupt the helical structure and the amphipathic character (Fig. 4). This control peptide inhibits the growth of N. crassa by 81% at 100 μm, whereas it was inactive at the concentration of 5 μm. This result shows that the amphipathic helix is crucial for the antifungal activity. Many antimicrobial peptides have α-helical structures; the majority are cationic and amphipathic, but some hydrophobic peptides have also been described. Most antimicrobial peptides interact with inner and outer membranes and may be able to reach intracellular targets. Thus, it was important to study the interaction of chromofungin with fungal membranes. Penetration experiments were performed at peptide concentrations ranging from 5 × 10−9 to 2 × 10−8mres so that the adsorption to a clean air/water interface (i.e. in the absence of lipid film) did not induce any surface pressure increase. The initial pressure of the lipid films (20 ± 0.5 mN/meter) was near the value generally considered as the internal pressure in cellular membranes (30Marsh D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 183-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). The addition of chromofungin (5 × 10−9mres in the subphase) beneath lecithin film resulted in a slow increase, Δπ, of the surface pressure, which reached its maximum value, ΔπM = 1 mN/meter, after 3 h (Fig. 5, inset). This modest surface pressure increase is indicative of the penetration of chromofungin into the lipid monolayers, because agents interacting only with the lipid head groups without penetration do not modify the surface pressure (31Demel R. London Y. Geurts van Kessel W. Vosseberg F. Van Dunen L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 311: 507-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). When ergosterol, the main sterol in yeast (32Mishra P. Bolard J. Prasad R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1127: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and fungus (33Friedman K.J. Glick D. J. Membr. Biol. 1980; 54: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) plasma membranes was included in the lipid monolayer, ΔπM increased to 3.5 mN/meter. Increasing the subphase peptide concentration from 5 × 10−9 to 2 × 10−8mres leads to an increase of ΔπM to 2 mN/meter and 4 mN/meter for lecithin and lecithin/ergosterol monolayers, respectively. Parallel experiments were carried out with the inactive peptide CGB-(602–626). At 5 × 10−9mres subphase concentration, CGB-(602–626) induced a surface pressure increase higher than that obtained with chromofungin (2.5 and 5.5 mN/meter instead of 1 and 4 mN/meter in lecithin and lecithin/ergosterol monolayers, respectively) (Fig. 5), indicating that CGB-(602–626) is able to interact with lipid membranes. However, since CGB-(602–626) is inactive toward fungi, this peptide is unable to interact with the plasma membrane, probably because of the presence on the cell wall of complex structures as β-1,3-glucan and chitin (linear polymer of β-1,4-N-acetylglucosamine) preventing its targeting. At this stage, it was important to examine with confocal laser microscopy the interaction of chromofungin with various fungal microorganisms. We used confocal laser microscopy to analyze the interaction of chromofungin with fungal membranes using the synthetic rhodamine-labeled CGA-(47–66)R peptide. The fluorescent rhodamine chromogranin B-derived peptide CGB-(602–626)R was used as a control, since it was inactive against fungi and yeasts. Prior the confocal microscopy analysis, we verified that the rhodamine-labeled peptides possess similar antifungal activities as those of unlabeled peptides. In these experiments, a concentration of 10 or 30 μmpeptide was used. Fungal spores of A. fumigatus, A. brassicola, and C. albicans were incubated at 30 °C first during 24 or 40 h and then for 1, 16, or 21 h with fluorescent peptides. Fungal spores of A. fumigatus were incubated during 24 h prior to treatment for 1 h at 30 °C with fluorescent peptides (Fig. 6). By comparison with a control experiment (no peptide; Fig. 6 A), CGA-(47–66)R 10 μm was visible at the level of the cell wall, where it seemed to accumulate, but also in the inner part of A. fumigatus (Fig. 6 B). In contrast, the labeled inactive peptide CGB-(602–626)R was undetectable in filamentous fungi (A. fumigatus; Fig. 6 C) and yeast (C. albicans; data not shown) at any treatment time. In a second series of experiments, we have tested the activity of chromofungin on fungal spores of A. fumigatus prepared by a first incubation for 40 h (Fig.7 A), prior to treatment for 1 h at 30 °C with CGA-(47–66)R 30 μm (Fig.7 B). The fluorescent active peptide was partly visible on the cell wall and the inner part of the distal growing end. This result showed that chromofungin penetrated through the cell wall at the fungus weakest point. After incubation for 40 h and then for 21 h at 30 °C with CGA-(47–66)R 10 μm, we observed that the fluorescent peptide invaded the numerous hyphae of A. fumigatus, inducing distortion of the wall and formation of numerous vacuoles (Fig. 7 C). By phase-contrast microscopy, fungi regions invaded with the labeled peptide were visible asdarkened areas. In addition, we also examined the spores of A. brassicola(Fig. 8 A) and C. albicans (Fig. 8 B) prepared by a first incubation for 24 h followed by a second incubation for 1 h at 30 °C with CGA-(47–66)R 30 μm or CGA-(47–66)R 1"
https://openalex.org/W2167964617,"Gap junctions are important in maintaining lens transparency and metabolic homeostasis. In this paper, we report that the gap junction-forming protein, connexin (Cx) 45.6, was specifically truncated during lens development and that the majority of the truncated fragments were located in the differentiated lens fibers. When isolated lens membranes were treated by caspase-3, the truncated fragments of Cx45.6 were reproduced, and this truncation occurred at the COOH terminus of Cx45.6. Moreover, when primary lens cells were treated with apoptosis-inducing reagents, Cx45.6 was cleaved similarly as the in vitro treatment by caspase-3, and this cleavage was blocked by a caspase-3 inhibitor. These results suggest that caspase-3 is responsible for the development-associated cleavage of Cx45.6. The cleavage site of Cx45.6 was identified between amino acid residues Glu367 and Gly368. We have shown previously that Ser363 is an in vivophosphorylated site by casein kinase II, and this specific phosphorylation leads to a rapid turnover of Cx45.6. Interestingly, we found here that when Ser363 was phosphorylated by casein kinase II, the cleavage of Cx45.6 catalyzed by caspase-3 was inhibited. This study, for the first time, demonstrates that a connexin can be a direct target of an apoptotic protease and that cleavage by caspase-3-like protease leads to the development-associated truncation of a lens connexin. Finally, caspase-3-mediated cleavage can be regulated by casein kinase II-mediated phosphorylation, suggesting that Cx45.6 turnover and specific cleavage by caspase-3-like protease is alternatively modulated.

The lens is an avascular organ composed of an anterior epithelial cell layer and highly differentiated fibers ranging from the outer cortex toward the central core region. The terminal differentiation and aging of lens fibers are marked by dramatic morphological changes. As new cells arise on the outside of the lens, older cells are pushed inward where nuclei and organelles are lost (1Rafferty N. Esson E. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1974; 46: 239-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Because these cells are never lost from the lens, the most central cells are as old as the organism itself. The survival of lens cells relies on the intercellular communications between these cells and the cells at the lens surface through a large network of gap junctions that facilitate the exchange of ions and metabolites throughout the organ (2Mathias R.T. Rae J.L. Sperelakis N. Cole W.C. Cell Interactions and Gap Junctions. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1989: 29-50Google Scholar, 3Cooper K. Mathias R.T. Rae J.L. Peracchia C. Biophysics of Gap Junction Channels. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 57-74Google Scholar). Gap junctions are intercellular channels between two adjacent cells, which allow passage of small molecules (≤1000 Da) such as small metabolites, ions, and second messengers. The structural components of gap junctions are the members of a protein family called connexins, which consist of four conserved transmembrane domains and two extracellular loops, whereas their cytoplasmic regions are unique. The COOH terminus, the most variable region among connexins, contains several kinase and protease consensus sequences. Connexins are highly dynamic proteins that undergo rapid turnover both in cell lines (4Musil L.S. Cunningham B.A. Edelman G.M. Goodenough D.A. J.

We have recently shown that an in vivo phosphorylated lens connexin undergoes a faster turnover than its unphosphorylated counterpart (17Yin X. Jedrzejewski P.T. Jiang J.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6850-6856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Differentiating lens fibers share a number of morphological and biochemical characteristics with cells undergoing apoptosis such as nucleus degeneration, loss of organelles, and activation of members of a cysteine protease family named caspase (18Wride M.A. Parker E. Sanders E.J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 213: 142-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 19Wride M.A. Apoptosis. 2000; 5: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 20Dahm R.

However, unlike apoptotic cells, which are rapidly digested, the organelle-free lens fibers retain their basic cell integrity and metabolism throughout the lifetime of the organ. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, an enzyme involved in DNA repair and maintenance of genomic integrity, is cleaved by caspases in the developing lens (18Wride M.A. Parker E. Sanders E.J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 213: 142-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Caspase-3 is predominantly activated during staurosporine-induced apoptosis in lens cells (22Andersson M. Sjöstrand J. Petersen A. Honarvar A.K.S. Karlsson J. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 2623-2632PubMed Google Scholar). The function of caspases has been reported to be responsible for nucleus degradation during the later stage of lens fiber differentiation (18Wride M.A. Parker E. Sanders E.J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 213: 142-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Although activation of caspases has been demonstrated during lens fiber differentiation, only a couple of caspase substrates have been identified, such as cytoskeletal proteins named α- and β-spectrins (21Lee A. Morrow J.S. Fowler V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20735-20742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Connexin (Cx)1 45.6 is one of the connexins expressed in chick lens fibers (23Jiang J.X. White T.W. Goodenough D.A. Paul D.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 363-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 24Jiang J.X. White T.W. Goodenough D.A. Dev. Biol. 1995; 168: 649-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Cx45.6, which is different from the other two chick lens connexins, Cx43 and Cx56, seems to be involved in lens development and differentiation. Mutations in Cx50, the mammalian ortholog of Cx45.6, have been identified in human cataract families (25Shiels A. Mackay D. Ionides A. Berry V. Moore A. Bhattacharya S. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 62: 526-532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 26Berry V. Mackay D. Khaliq S. Francis P.J. Hameed A. Anwar K. Mehdi S.Q. Newbold R.J. Ionides A. Shiels A. Moore T. Bhattacharya S.S. Hum. Genet. 1999; 105: 168-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Mice deficient in Cx50 not only develop cataracts, but also exhibit microphthalmia with a decrease of lens size (27White T.W. Goodenough D.A. Paul D.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 815-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Primary cultures of chick lens closely mimic in vivolens cell differentiation processes in which the monolayer of the lens epithelial cells differentiate into structures called “lentoids” displaying features of differentiated lens fibers (28Piatigorsky J. Rothschile S.S. Milstone L.M. Dev. Biol. 1973; 34: 334-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 29Menko A.S. Klukas K.A. Johnson R.G. Dev. Biol. 1984; 103: 129-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that overexpression of Cx45.6 in lens primary cultures stimulates lens cell differentiation and formation of fibers (30Gu S. Yin X. Jiang J.X. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 405Google Scholar). Additionally, Cx45.6 is subjected to post-translational modificationin vivo. Cx45.6 is a phosphoprotein (23Jiang J.X. White T.W. Goodenough D.A. Paul D.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 363-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 31Jiang J.X. Goodenough D.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that Cx45.6 is phosphorylated in vivo by CKII at Ser363 located at the COOH-terminal region, and this phosphorylation facilitated the turnover of Cx45.6 (17Yin X. Jedrzejewski P.T. Jiang J.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6850-6856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A previous report shows that Cx50, the ovine ortholog of Cx45.6, is also truncated at the COOH terminus in the center of the lens by a protease called calpain (32Lin J.S. Fitzgerald S. Dong Y. Knight C. Donaldson P. Kistler J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 73: 141-149PubMed Google Scholar). Although post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and specific truncation of lens connexins, have been investigated previously, the physiological significance and regulatory mechanism of these modifications in lens differentiation and development are less certain. In this report, we identified a specific proteolytic cleavage of Cx45.6 associated with lens development. Our experimental evidence suggests that the protease involved in this cleavage is caspase-3, an apoptotic protease. Moreover, the cleavage site by caspase-3 in Cx45.6 was identified to be close to the phosphorylated site by CKII. This specific phosphorylation protects Cx45.6 from cleavage by caspase-3. This is the first report showing that the apoptotic protease, caspase-3, is responsible for cleavage of a connexin, and this specific cleavage is regulated by a specific phosphorylation. Fertilized chicken eggs were obtained from SPAFAS (Roanoke, IL) and Tyson Hatchery (Gonzalez, TX). CKII and caspase-3 were obtained from Sigma. Caspase-3 inhibitor Z-DEVD-FMK was from Calbiochem. [γ-32P]ATP and [35S]methionine were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Tissue culture reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. SDS-PAGE standards were from Bio-Rad. QuikChangeTMSite-directed Mutagenesis kit was obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Chemiluminescence kit, ECL, was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.X-Omat AR film was obtained from Eastman Kodak. Bacterial fusion proteins containing GST fused with various portions of Cx45.6 were prepared as described (23Jiang J.X. White T.W. Goodenough D.A. Paul D.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 363-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 33He D.S. Jiang J.X. Taffet S.M. Burt J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6495-6500Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The fusion proteins generated included the following: GST fused with partial COOH terminus of Cx45.6, GST-Cx45.6F1 (amino acids 307–389) and its corresponding site mutants, GST-Cx45.6F1(D364A) and GST-Cx45.6F1(E367A); GST fused with entire COOH terminus of Cx45.6, GST-Cx45.6F2 (amino acids 237–400); and GST fused with intracellular loop region of Cx45.6, GST-Cx45.6(L) (amino acids 98–148). Briefly, DNA fragments containing various portions of Cx45.6 or its mutants were produced by PCR with specific oligonucleotide primers. The codon GAT encoding Asp364 was changed to GCT encoding Ala and GAA encoding Glu367 was altered to GCA encoding Ala in one of the two primer sequences required for mutant synthesis. Each DNA fragment generated was inserted into the expression vector pGEX-2T. The recombinant fusion proteins were expressed inEscherichia coli, induced by isopropyl-thio-β-d-galactoside, and isolated with GST beads. To ensure the correct sequence all constructs generated were sequenced at the Institutional DNA Sequencing Facility. Fusion protein containing GST plus intracellular loop portion of Cx45.6 was used to raise polyclonal antisera in rabbits (Pocono Rabbit Farm and Laboratory Inc, Canadensis, PA). The antisera generated were immunoaffinity-purified by passage through two Sepharose CL-4B columns, GST-conjugated and GST-Cx45.6 fusion protein-conjugated, respectively, as described (23Jiang J.X. White T.W. Goodenough D.A. Paul D.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 363-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 33He D.S. Jiang J.X. Taffet S.M. Burt J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6495-6500Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The fusion proteins and crude membrane samples were loaded in each lane of a 10% SDS-PAGE. For Western blotting, samples on SDS-PAGE were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes according to the method of White et al. (34White T.W. Bruzzone R. Goodenough D.A. Paul D.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Membranes were probed with the affinity-purified preimmune or Cx45.6 antibody (1:500 dilution). The primary antibodies were detected either with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary anti-rabbit antiserum or peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-rabbit antiserum and followed by chemiluminescence reagent kit (ECL) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The membranes were exposed to X-Omat AR films (Eastman Kodak) and detected by fluorography. Retroviral constructs and high titer viruses were prepared based on our protocol described previously (35Jiang J.X. Bruzzone R. Giaume C. Connexin Methods and Protocols. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2000: 159-174Google Scholar). Briefly, cDNA fragment containing the wild type Cx45.6 was made by PCR and was constructed into the retroviral vector RCAS(A) as described (17Yin X. Jedrzejewski P.T. Jiang J.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6850-6856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 36Jiang J.X. Goodenough D.A. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 537-543PubMed Google Scholar). With the wild type RCAS(A)-Cx45.6 DNA construct as a template, retroviral constructs of Cx45.6 mutants containing point mutations were generated with the QuikChangeTM Site-directed Mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The codon alteration for site mutants, RCAS(A)-Cx45.6(D364A) and RCAS(A)-Cx45.6(E367A), were described above. RCAS(A)-Cx45.6(E367D) was made by changing codon GAA encoding Glu367 to GAT encoding Asp. All constructs generated were sequenced at the Institutional DNA Sequencing Facility. The high titer retroviruses (1–5 × 108 colony forming units/ml) containing the wild type and the mutant RCAS(A) Cx45.6 constructs were prepared as we have described previously (35Jiang J.X. Bruzzone R. Giaume C. Connexin Methods and Protocols. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2000: 159-174Google Scholar, 36Jiang J.X. Goodenough D.A. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 537-543PubMed Google Scholar). The crude cell membranes were isolated and prepared as described (37Jiang J.X. Goodenough D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1287-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Briefly, lenses from embryonic day 9 or CEF cells infected with retroviruses were lysed in lysis buffer (5 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 5 mm EDTA/EGTA) plus 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mmN-ethylmaleimide, and 100 μm leupeptin. Crude membranes were pelleted at 35,000 rpm for 30 min (Beckman SW60 rotor). The crude membranes from CEF cells and lenses or the purified GST fusion proteins were subjected to in vitro cleavage by caspase-3. Crude membranes or 2.5 μg of various GST fusion proteins were incubated at 37 °C in 25 μl of caspase-3 reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm sucrose, and 5% glycerol) with and without 0.3 μg of caspase-3 at various times. Reactions were terminated by the addition of electrophoresis sample buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 2% β-mercaptoethanol, and 35% glycerol) and boiled for 5 min. Primary lens cultures were prepared according to the procedure described previously (17Yin X. Jedrzejewski P.T. Jiang J.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6850-6856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 38Musil L.S. Beyer E.C. Goodenough D.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 116: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Briefly, chick lenses dissected from embryonic day 11 embryos were ruptured, and the cells that dissociated from the lenses were plated at 1 × 106 cells per 35-mm tissue culture plates in medium 199 plus 10% fetal bovine serum. Eight days after cell plating, primary cultures were treated either with 5 μm staurosporine dissolved in culture medium or with 2 mm EGTA for 4.5 h at 37 °C. When caspase-3 inhibitor Z-DEVD-FMK was used, cultures were preincubated with this inhibitor for 1 h before exposure to staurosporine or EGTA. CEF cells were plated at 1 × 105 cells in 35-mm tissue culture plates with DMEM plus 10% fetal calf serum and 5% CO2. The 2nd day after cell plating CEF cells were infected with high titer retroviruses (5 μl/dish) carrying either the wild type or the mutant Cx45.6 cDNAs. When CEF cells reached confluence, they were collected either for membrane preparation or for treatment with apoptosis-inducing reagents. CEF cells were treated in the presence of 1 mm staurosporine for 8 h at 37 °C. The isolated embryonic lens membranes were incubated in 20 μl of CKII reaction buffer (10 mmMgCl2, 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 150 mmNaCl, and 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) plus 2 μl of CKII (119 units/ml) at 30 °C for 2 h. The reaction was stopped by the inactivation of CKII by incubating at 56 °C for 30 min. Fifty microliters of caspase-3 reaction buffer were added to the in vitro phosphorylated lens membrane sample, and the reaction mixture was then divided into two tubes. In each tube, 3 μl of caspase-3 or caspase-3 storage buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, and 10% (w/v) glycerol) was added and incubated at 37 °C for 6 h. The reaction was terminated by boiling the samples for 5 min in the presence of 0.6% SDS prior to the immunoprecipitation with affinity purified Cx45.6 antibody as previously described (31Jiang J.X. Goodenough D.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 37Jiang J.X. Goodenough D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1287-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). To control for the immunoprecipitation assay, embryonic day 9 lenses were rinsed three times with culture medium deficient in methionine prior to the incubation with 1 ml of35S-labeled medium (methionine-free DMEM with 5% dialyzed fetal calf serum, 20 μm methionine, and 0.5 mCi of [35S]methionine) for 3 h. The radioactive medium was removed, and lenses were incubated in non-radioactive medium (DMEM supplemented with 0.5 mm methionine and 10% fetal calf serum) for various chase periods. 35S-Labeled lens membranes were isolated and treated at the identical condition as the 32P-labeled sample except the omission of ATP in CKII reaction mix, followed by the treatment by caspase-3, and immunoprecipitation as described above. Chick lenses at embryonic (E) days 8, 12, 15, and 18 and postnatal (P) days 1, 15, 30, and 60 were immunoblotted with affinity-purified Cx45.6 antibody that recognized the intracellular loop region of Cx45.6. The full-length Cx45.6 was phosphorylated in vivo and migrated as three close bands at the positions of 53, 56, and 58 kDa (Fig.1) as demonstrated previously (23Jiang J.X. White T.W. Goodenough D.A. Paul D.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 363-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). At E8, a full-length Cx45.6 was solely present in the lens (Fig. 1,lane 1). Starting at E12, an additional band appeared migrating at around 46 kDa (empty arrowhead) (Fig. 1,lane 2) and its concentration level increased during the development of the lens as shown at E15 (Fig. 1, lane 3), E18 (Fig. 1, lane 4), and postnatal stages (Fig. 1,lanes 5–8). In addition, a 48-kDa fragment (solid arrowhead) closely migrating with the 46-kDa fragment appeared at E15, which is a lesser amount than 46-kDa fragment at embryonic stages. The level of this fragment, however, increased dramatically at the later developmental stages and reached a similar level as the 46-kDa fragment approaching P15 (Fig. 1, lane 6). No protein bands could be detected using pre-immune antibody (data not shown). To exclude the possibility that these cleavages may have occurred during sample preparation, we incubated lysates from embryonic and postnatal lenses at room temperature for 16 h and did not detect any accumulation of these fragments (data not shown). To determine if one of the closely migrated fragments was the phosphorylated form of another fragment, crude membranes from lens at P30 were treated with alkaline phosphatase. The levels of these two fragments were not altered (data not show), suggesting that neither of the fragments is the phosphorylated form of the other. The exterior portions of the 2-month postnatal chick lens containing epithelial cells and the fibers of the outer cortex were separated from the central core portion of the lens composed of mature lens fibers. The whole lens lysate contained both the full-length Cx45.6 and the cleaved fragments (Fig.2, lane 3, arrowheads). However, the cleaved fragments predominantly existed in the mature fibers of the central core (Fig. 2, lane 1, arrowheads) and to a much lesser extent in the outer cortex which, in contrast, was mainly composed of full-length Cx45.6 (Fig. 2, lane 2). Because cells are retained in the lens and new cells continually arise on the outside of the lens, most cells in the central core regions are differentiated mature lens fibers (1Rafferty N. Esson E. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1974; 46: 239-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Consistent with the observation in Fig. 1 that truncated Cx45.6 fragments were accumulated associated with lens development, the results indicate that the specific cleavage of Cx45.6 in differentiated lens fibers may be related to the process of lens cell differentiation and formation of mature fibers. To identify the potential protease(s) involved in the cleavage of Cx45.6 during lens development, we first experimented with Ca2+-activated, cysteine protease calpain. This protease cleaves at the COOH terminus of Cx50, the ovine counterpart of Cx45.6 in the central region of the lens (32Lin J.S. Fitzgerald S. Dong Y. Knight C. Donaldson P. Kistler J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 73: 141-149PubMed Google Scholar). Western blot of the membranes from embryonic (E) day 9 chick lens revealed a full-length Cx45.6 (Fig. 3 A, lane 2). Treatment by calpain led to a cleavage from a full-length Cx45.6 into a major 33-kDa fragment (Fig. 3 A, lane 3, open arrowhead), different from the 46-kDa fragment observed in the 2-month P chick lens (Fig. 3 A, lane 1, solid arrowhead). This result suggests that unlike ovine Cx50 calpain is unlikely involved in the in vivo truncation of Cx45.6 in chick lens. Caspase-3-like protease involved in apoptosis has been reported to be activated when lens epithelial cells differentiate into fibers in vivo (39Ishizaki Y. Jacobson M.D. Raff M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), and caspase-3 expression is localized in the outer fibers (18Wride M.A. Parker E. Sanders E.J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 213: 142-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Caspase-3 is activated between embryonic days 8 and 12 in chick lens (18Wride M.A. Parker E. Sanders E.J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 213: 142-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), which is at the similar time frame as when the cleavage of Cx45.6 was observed. To determine whether caspase-3 is the protease responsible for the cleavage, embryonic lens membranes were incubated with caspase-3. As shown in Fig. 3 B, after 2-h incubation, the full-length Cx45.6 was partially cleaved into fragments around 46 kDa (Fig. 3 B, lane 1, arrowhead), which migrated to the same position as the truncated Cx45.6 of the lens membrane from the newborn chick (Fig. 3 B, lane 5, arrowhead). After 16-h incubation with caspase-3, the majority of the full-length Cx45.6 proteins was cleaved (Fig. 3 B, lane 3, arrowhead). These results indicate that Cx45.6 may be a direct substrate for caspase-3. Alternatively, Cx45.6 can be cleaved by other protease(s) present in the lens membrane that could be activated by caspase-3. To examine these possibilities further, purified fusion proteins containing GST fused with portions of Cx45.6 were used for in vitro caspase-3 enzymatic digestion. The fusion parts of Cx45.6 include the following: the intracellular loop of Cx45.6 (GST-45.6L) (amino acids 98–148) (Fig. 3 C, lanes 3 and 4), partial COOH terminus (GST-45.6 F1) (amino acids 307–389) (Fig.3 C, lanes 5 and 6), and entire COOH terminus (GST-45.6F2) (amino acids 237–400) (Fig. 3 C, lanes 7 and8). These fusion proteins, together with the GST protein itself (Fig. 3 C, lanes 1 and 2), were treated with caspase-3. Both GST-45.6 F1 (Fig. 3 C, lane 6) and GST-45.6F2 (Fig. 3 C, lane 8) were cleaved by caspase-3 (arrowheads), whereas GST protein (Fig. 3 C, lane 2) and GST-45.6L (Fig. 3 C, lane 4) were not cleaved. These results suggest that Cx45.6 is a substrate of caspase-3 and that the cleavage site is located within the COOH terminus between amino acids 307 and 389. To examine whether Cx45.6 can be cleaved by caspase-3 in lens cells, primary lens cultures were incubated with apoptosis-inducing reagents staurosporine (Fig.4, lane 2) (22Andersson M. Sjöstrand J. Petersen A. Honarvar A.K.S. Karlsson J. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 2623-2632PubMed Google Scholar) or EGTA (Fig.4, lane 4) (40McGinnis K.M. Wang K.K.W. Gnegy M.E. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1853-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These two compounds are known chemical inducers for caspase-mediated apoptosis (22Andersson M. Sjöstrand J. Petersen A. Honarvar A.K.S. Karlsson J. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 2623-2632PubMed Google Scholar, 40McGinnis K.M. Wang K.K.W. Gnegy M.E. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1853-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Treatments by both reagents regenerated fragments around 46 kDa (Fig. 4, lanes 2 and 4, arrowhead). The cleavage was significantly inhibited by Z-DEVD-FMK, a caspase-3 inhibitor (Fig. 4, lane 5). The results confirm that caspase-3 is likely to be involved in the cleavage of Cx45.6 in vivo. The amino acid sequence Asp364-Glu-Val-Glu367-Gly was identified in the COOH-terminal region of Cx45.6 (see Fig.5 A). This sequence is similar to a known caspase-3 consensus sequence (41Talanian R.V. Quinlan C. Trautz S. Hackett M.C. Mankovich J.A. Banach D. Ghayur T. Brady K.D. Wong W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9677-9682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar) with the exception of substituting Asp with Glu at position 367. If cleavage by caspase-3 occurs between Glu367 and Gly368, the predicted molecular weight of one of the cleaved fragments would match that of the 46-kDa fragment. The two aspartate residues in the consensus sequence of caspase-3 are essential, and cleavage cannot occur if either residue is altered to alanine (42Barkett M. Xue D. Horvitz H.R. Glimore T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29419-29422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Since glutamate like aspartate is an acidic residue, this segment of the sequence in Cx45.6 is a potential target for caspase-3. As illustrated in Fig.5 A, mutants were constructed with alterations in the conserved amino acid residues corresponding to the consensus sequence of caspase-3. Fusion proteins GST-Cx45.6F1, and its mutants GST-Cx45.6F1(D364A) and GST-Cx45.6F1(E367A), were subjected to caspase-3 cleavage in vitro (Fig. 5 B). GST-Cx45.6F1 was cleaved by caspase-3 into two closely migrating bands (Fig. 5 B, lane 2). Both GST-Cx45.6F1(D364A) (Fig. 5 B, lane 4) and GST-Cx45.6F1(E367A) (Fig. 5 B, lane 6) exhibited resistance to cleavage by caspase-3. These data suggest that either Asp364 or Glu367 seems to be crucial in the cleavage by caspase-3. The COOH terminus of Cx45.6 in GST fusion protein may not have similar conformation as compared with the one in the membrane-spanning full-length molecule. Therefore, full-length Cx45.6 and its mutants carrying alterations of conserved residues corresponding to caspase-3 (see Fig. 5 A) were expressed in CEF cells through retroviral infection, and the isolated cell membranes were subjected to caspase-3 treatment (Fig. 5 C). Similar to the results shown for fusion proteins, mutations in D364A and E367A prevented cleavage of Cx45.6 by caspase-3 (Fig. 5 C, lanes 4 and 6). Furthermore, the mutation of E367D, producing a cleavage sequence in Cx45.6 identical to the consensus sequence for caspase-3, increased cleavage (Fig. 5 C, lane 8). The ratio of the fragments around 46 kDa to the full-length form of Cx45.6(E367D) (Fig. 5 C, lane 8) is greater than that to the full-length wild type Cx45.6 (Fig.5 C, lane 2). Similar results were observed when CEF cells expressing wild type and mutant Cx45.6 were treated by the apoptosis-inducing reagent staurosporine (Fig. 5 D). Neither Cx45.6(D364A) nor Cx45.6(E367A) was cleaved (Fig. 5 D, lanes 4 and6), whereas the wild type Cx45.6 was (Fig. 5 D, lane 2). In comparison to the wild type Cx45.6, the cleavage of Cx45.6(E367D) was further enhanced (Fig. 5 D, lane 8). Together, the results obtained from fusion proteins and full-length Cx45.6 expressed in cells suggest that the cleavage site of Cx45.6 by caspase-3 is between Glu367 and Gly368. We have reported that Ser363, an amino acid residue close to the caspase-3 cleavage site, is phosphorylated in vivo by CKII (17Yin X. Jedrzejewski P.T. Jiang J.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6850-6856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of certain substrates has been shown to be important in regulating their cleavage by caspase-3 (42Barkett M. Xue D. Horvitz H.R. Glimore T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29419-29422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 43Walter J. Schindzielorz A. Grünberg J. Haass C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1391-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To determine whether phosphorylation at Ser363 affects the ability of Cx45.6 to serve as a substrate for caspase-3, Cx45.6 in the membranes of embryonic lenses was treated in the presence of CKII and followed by proteolytic digestion by caspase-3 (Fig.6, lane 2). The results indicate that Cx45.6 phosphorylated by CKII was protected from caspase-3 digestion. To ensure that Cx45.6 in both full-length and truncated forms could be immunoprecipitated, embryonic lenses were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine and chased in non-radioactive medium immediately (Fig. 6, lanes 3 and4) and after 6 h of incubation (Fig. 6, lanes 5 and 6). The isolated membranes labeled with [35S]methionine were treated in the presence (Fig. 6,lanes 4 and 6) and absence (Fig. 6, lanes 3 and 5) of caspase-3 and followed by immunoprecipitation. The Cx45.6 antibody we used here was capable of immunoprecipitating the full-length as well as the truncated (arrowhead) Cx45.6 cleaved by caspase-3. Together, the data suggest that the specific cleavage of Cx45.6 by caspase-3 is likely to be regulated by CKII-mediated phosphorylation. In this report, we identified caspase-3 as the protease responsible for the cleavage of Cx45.6 during chick lens development. Additionally, the cleavage on Cx45.6 was localized to the site close to the amino acid residue phosphorylated by CKII. Our previous studies (17Yin X. Jedrzejewski P.T. Jiang J.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6850-6856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) have shown that Cx45.6 is phosphorylated in vivo by CKII at Ser363, and this phosphorylation may be a signal for Cx45.6 degradation mediated by proteasome. Here, we found that phosphorylation of Ser363 by CKII protected Cx45.6 from cleavage by caspase-3, suggesting that the specific cleavage of Cx45.6 is regulated by CKII-mediated phosphorylation. Based on our experimental evidence, a model is proposed for the involvement of CKII-mediated phosphorylation in the regulation of Cx45.6 turnover and specific cleavage by caspase-3-like protease. In the outer cortex of the lens, when a full-length Cx45.6 is phosphorylated by CKII at Ser363, it becomes unstable and possibly undergoes degradation mediated through the proteasome pathway (17Yin X. Jedrzejewski P.T. Jiang J.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6850-6856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The CKII phosphorylation site Ser363 is located within a PEST domain (17Yin X. Jedrzejewski P.T. Jiang J.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6850-6856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 44Liu Z.P. Galindo R.L. Wasserman S.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 15: 3413-3422Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and this domain has been reported to be associated with a rapid protein turnover via proteasome-mediated degradation (45Rechsteiner M. Rogers S.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 267-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1406) Google Scholar). Additionally, phosphorylation is also known to signal protein degradation by proteasome (46Lange C.A. Shen T. Horwitz K.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1032-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). When Ser363 is not phosphorylated by CKII, Cx45.6 renders itself into a substrate for caspase-3, which cleaves at Glu367 at the COOH terminus of Cx45.6 and generates truncated fragments of Cx45.6. These fragments were localized to the central core region of the lens. We observed two fragments derived from Cx45.6 in the size of 46 and 48 kDa. These fragments were accumulated during lens development. The 46-kDa fragment was predominant during the embryonic stage, whereas the level of the 48-kDa fragment increased and reached a similar level as compared with the 46-kDa form at the postnatal stage. Formation of two fragments was also observed when GST-Cx45.6F1 was treated with caspase-3. However, mutation of a potential cleavage site in GST-Cx45.6F1 blocked the production of either fragment, suggesting that this site initiates generation of these two fragments. Because of the closeness of their migration, these two fragments sometimes were less distinctive on the SDS-PAGE. We also observed a potential third band larger than 48 kDa at P60 samples, and this band could be generated from additional cleavage or certain type of posttranslational modifications. Our data suggest that caspase-3-like protease is responsible for thein vivo cleavage of Cx45.6. In contrast to our observation in chicken, a previous study has shown that a large portion of the COOH terminus of Cx50, the ovine ortholog of Cx45.6, is removed by calpain (32Lin J.S. Fitzgerald S. Dong Y. Knight C. Donaldson P. Kistler J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 73: 141-149PubMed Google Scholar). This discrepancy could account for the difference in expression level or accessibility of these two proteases expressed in these two species, because the responsibility of one protease could be replaced by the other during evolution. It is also likely that the cleaved fragment of Cx50 observed in ovine is caused by in vitroexperimental manipulation. We found if lysates of lens primary cells were handled improperly, Cx45.6 would be cleaved into a 33-kDa fragment, an identical size fragment as the fragment cleaved by calpain (data not shown). We have also shown that the truncated Cx45.6 was accumulated during lens development and was localized to the differentiated lens fibers. The activation of caspases-3 also initiates in the differentiated lens fibers and is involved in later stage cell differentiation, such as nucleus degeneration (18Wride M.A. Parker E. Sanders E.J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 213: 142-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Thus, the caspase-3-truncated Cx45.6 is likely to form a unique type of gap junctions, different from the ones formed by full-length Cx45.6. These intercellular channels may facilitate the passage of factors important for fiber differentiation and/or maintain the physiological functions of mature fibers. Functional gap junction channels are, indeed, formed by truncated Cx50 of ovine lens (32Lin J.S. Fitzgerald S. Dong Y. Knight C. Donaldson P. Kistler J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 73: 141-149PubMed Google Scholar). These channels are characterized to be less sensitive to low pH, compared with those formed by full-length Cx50. Studies by Le and Musil (47Le A.N. Musil L.S. Dev. Biol. 1998; 204: 80-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) have shown that lens primary cultures differentiate normally even if the channels are blocked with the gap junction inhibitor 18β-glycyrrhetinic acid. Since 18β-glycyrrhetinic acid has been tested for gap junctions formed solely by full-length connexins (48Guan X.J. Wilson S. Schlender K.K. Ruch R.J. Mol. Carcinog. 1996; 16: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), the channels consisting of truncated connexins may not be similarly inhibited by this chemical. Lens Cx45.6 is the first connexin identified as a substrate for caspase. In addition to lens fibers other cell types, such as skin keratinocytes, also undergo degeneration of nuclei and organelles during cell differentiation. Caspase activation has been identified in the differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes and is required for the loss of the nucleus (49Weil M. Raff M.C. Braga M.M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 361-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). It is of great interest to determine whether connexins in those cells are also subjected to regulation by caspases. The physiological significance of the regulation of connexins by caspases requires further investigation. We thank D. Adan-Rice and L. Wang for technical assistance and Z. Dong for valuable discussions. We thank members of the Jiang laboratory for critical reading of the manuscript."

Biol. 2000; 16: 51-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) where the insertion of several plasma membrane proteins was shown to require the activity of two soluble/extrinsic proteins, SRP and FtsY. Escherichia coli SRP is a complex comprising a 4.5 S RNA molecule together with a homolog of the 54-kDa subunit of eukaryotic SRPs, which binds to particularly hydrophobic regions such as nascent or newly synthesized membrane proteins. The SRP-substrate complex interacts, at least in some cases, with the SecYEG translocon in the plasma membrane and, in a poorly understood sequence of events, the substrate is transferred into the translocon with the assistance of an additional factor, FtsY (2De Gier J-W.L.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2289-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Both SRP and FtsY are GTPases and the insertion process depends totally on GTP hydrolysis. A broadly similar pathway has been characterized for the insertion of the major light-harvesting chlorophyll-binding protein, Lhcb1, into the thylakoid membrane of plant chloroplasts. This conservation of insertion pathway is perhaps not surprising, given that chloroplasts are widely accepted to have evolved from endosymbiotic cyanobacterial-type organisms. After import from the cytosol, Lhcb1 binds stromal SRP to form a soluble targeting complex (9Li X. Henry R. Yuan J. Cline K. Hoffman N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3789-3793Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Integration of the polytopic Lhcb1 protein into the thylakoid membrane further requires FtsY (10Kogata N. Nishio K. Hirohashi T. Kikuchi S. Nakai M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 329: 329-333Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 11Tu C.J. Schuenemann D. Hoffman N.E. J. Biol.

The translocase has yet to be fully characterized; antibodies to SecY strongly inhibit the insertion of SecA-dependent lumenal substrates but do not block the insertion of Lhcb1 (12Mori H. Summer E.J. Ma X. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 13Moore M. Harrison M.S. Peterson E.C. Henry R. J. Biol.

This raises the possibility that the thylakoid SecYEG complex is not required, although this work could not rule out the possibility that the SRP interacts with a different SecY determinant that is unaffected by antibody binding. Interestingly, the chloroplast SRP particle differs from that of E. coli in that (i) no RNA is present and (ii) this SRP possesses a novel 43-kDa subunit (14Schuenemann D. Gupta S. Persello-Cartieaux F. Klimyuk V.I. Jones J.D.G. Nussaume L. Hoffman N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10312-10316Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), which binds to a novel SRP recognition element in Lhcb1 that is found in other members of the light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b -binding protein family (LHC proteins) (15DeLille J.

Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13187-13190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, there are clear parallels with the E. coli insertion pathway and the similar natures of the pathways are reinforced by recent findings concerning the essential involvement of Oxa1-type proteins. Oxa1 is a mitochondrial inner membrane protein that is involved in the biogenesis of a range of mitochondrial inner membrane proteins, specifically those that insert from the matrix side of the membrane (17Herrmann J.M. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2217-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 18Hell K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1281-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). An Oxa1 homologue, termed Alb3, is also essential for the insertion of Lhcb1 in thylakoids (13Moore M. Harrison M.S. Peterson E.C. Henry R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1529-1532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) and recent work has shown an E. coli homologue, YidC, to be essential for the insertion of at least some SRP-dependent membrane proteins in this organism (19Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moeller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Critically, YidC is also essential for the biogenesis of E. coli membrane proteins that do not require SRP or the Sec apparatus. The insertion mechanism of M13 procoat protein has been characterized in some detail (20Kuhn A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 17: 185-190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and this protein has been shown to insert efficiently into the plasma membrane in the complete absence of functional SRP, SecA, or the membrane-bound SecYEG translocon. On the basis of these data it had been suggested that this protein may insert spontaneously into the membrane, but depletion of YidC led to a rapid block in its insertion indicating a central role in their insertion. Thus, it appears that one pool of YidC may be associated with the Sec apparatus (21Scotti P.A. Urbanus M.L. Brunner J. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. van der Does C. Driessen A.J.M. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 542-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) while another pool may in effect represent a novel form of translocase dedicated for the insertion of some, if not all, SRP-independent membrane proteins. Like M13 procoat, a subset of thylakoid membrane proteins are synthesized with cleavable signal peptides but inserted in the absence of SRP (22Michl D. Robinson C. Shackleton J.B. Herrmann R.G. Klösgen R.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1310-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 23Kim S.J. Robinson C. Mant A. FEBS Letts. 1998; 424: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), but the possible involvement of the YidC homolog, Alb3, remains to be clarified. All of the previous studies on thylakoid protein insertion have focused either on relatives of the well studied Lhcb1 (LHC proteins), or on proteins that bear cleavable N-terminal signal peptides. In this report we have sought to characterize the insertion of a different type of thylakoid membrane protein, PsaK, which is not synthesized with a cleavable signal peptide and which is unrelated to LHC proteins. We show that this protein inserts with high efficiency into thylakoids by a mechanism that does not involve SRP, NTP hydrolysis, or any of the known translocation machinery in the thylakoid membrane, including Alb3. A full-length cDNA clone encoding the precursor of barley PsaK (pPsaK) in the plasmid pBluescriptTM SK(−) was a gift from B. L. Møller (24Kjærulff S. Andersen B. Nielsen V.S. Møller B.L. Okkels J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18912-18916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A construct encoding the mature PsaK protein was prepared by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the aforementioned barley cDNA. The forward primer (5′-CAGGGGATCCGCATGGACTACATCGGC-3′) introduced a BamHI site between base pairs 287 and 288, and altered cysteine 42, which is the last amino acid of the transit peptide, to an initiating methionine residue. The reverse primer (5′-CCCGAAGCTTGCAGAACAGCTATG-3′) introduced a HindIII restriction site between base pairs 603 and 604, after the stop codon at base pair 565. The amplified region was cloned 5′BamHI-HindIII 3′ into pGEMTM 4Z, and sequenced completely before being used as a template for transcription and translation. A cDNA clone encoding pea pLhcb1 was provided by N. E. Hoffman (25Adam Z. Hoffman N.E. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), while the cDNA clone encoding wheat p23K has been described (26James H.E. Bartling D. Musgrove J.E. Kirwin P.M.

The plasmid encoding pPsaK was linearized with XhoI, whereas linearization was found to be unnecessary for the plasmid encoding PsaK. Transcription in vitro was performed according to Promega protocols, using either T3 RNA polymerase (for pPsaK) or SP6 RNA polymerase (for PsaK, pLhcb1 and p23K). Radiolabeled proteins were prepared using a wheat germ lysate system (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biochem), also according to the manufacturers instructions. The translation mixtures were treated with puromycin and centrifuged prior to use in insertion assays, as described by Thompson et al. (27Thompson S.J. Robinson C. Mant A. J. Biol.

In order to test if PsaK was correctly inserted in the thylakoid membrane (either after import into intact chloroplasts, or after insertion into isolated thylakoid membranes), the membranes (between 10 and 20 μg of chlorophyll, depending on the experiment) were washed with 0.5 ml of ice-cold 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 8, 5 mmMgCl2 (HM) and then reisolated by centrifugation at 18,000 × g and 4 °C for 5 min in a microcentrifuge. Next, they were washed with 100 μl of 20 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 8 (TB), and reisolated as above, then subjected to one round of extraction with 6.8 m urea, using a protocol adapted from Breyton et al. (28Breyton C. de Vitry C. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7597-7602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and described in detail in Ref. 27Thompson S.J. Robinson C. Mant A. J. Biol.

Next, the membranes were resuspended in TB and digested with 0.2 mg ml−1 trypsin (Sigma, type XIII) in a final volume of 100 μl for 30 min on ice. Trypsin digestions were stopped by the addition of 0.5 mg ml−1 trypsin inhibitor (Sigma, type I-S), followed by centrifugation at 18,000 × g and 4 °C for 10 min in a microcentrifuge. Finally, the thylakoid membranes were resuspended in 15 μl of TB containing 5 μg of trypsin inhibitor, and an equal volume of 2 × protein sample buffer, then immediately boiled for 5 min. Insertion efficiencies were measured by exposing dried SDS-PAGE gels in PhosphorImager cassettes, followed by quantitation in a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. PsaK is a nuclear-encoded subunit of photosystem I that is important for the stable interaction of LHCI with the photosystem I core complex (29Jensen P.E. Gilpin M. Knoetzel J. Scheller H.V. J. Biol.

Barley PsaK is synthesized in the cytosol as a 13.7-kDa precursor, imported into the chloroplast and subsequently inserted into the thylakoid membrane (24Kjærulff S. Andersen B. Nielsen V.S. Møller B.L. Okkels J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18912-18916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presequence is a typical stroma-targeting peptide that is predicted to be removed by the stromal processing peptidase (SPP). From sequence analysis, the 9-kDa mature protein is predicted to span the membrane twice with the N and C termini both located in the lumen and the positively charged loop region remaining on the stromal (cis) side of the thylakoid membrane according to the “positive-inside rule” (30Gavel Y. Steppuhn J. Herrmann R.G. von Heijne G. FEBS Lett. 1991; 282: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Recent high-resolution crystallographic analyses of Synechococcus elongatus photosystem I have confirmed these predictions for the cyanobacterial PsaK, which is highly similar to eukaryotic PsaK. 2P. Jordan, P. Fromme, and N. Krauss, personal communication. This “horseshoe” configuration is illustrated in Fig. 1, which also indicates the locations of the methionine residues in the mature barley protein (two in the first transmembrane region, one in the second). The stroma-exposed loop region contains numerous positively charged residues and trypsin is therefore predicted to cleave in this region and generate two degradation fragments containing the indicated numbers of methionine residues. The amino acid sequence of pPsaK is also given in Fig. 1 together with the start site of a mature-size construct described below. Fig.2 shows a chloroplast import experiment conducted with [35S]methionine-labeled barley pPsaK. The precursor protein (pPsaK) is imported into chloroplasts (lane C) where it is processed to the mature form and resistant to added protease (lane C+); the mature protein has an apparent mass of 7 kDa (in agreement with Ref. 24Kjærulff S. Andersen B. Nielsen V.S. Møller B.L. Okkels J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18912-18916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is found exclusively in the thylakoid fraction (lane T). The protein is highly resistant to urea extraction (lane Turea), which has been shown to be an effective means of identifying many membrane proteins (28Breyton C. de Vitry C. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7597-7602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Trypsin treatment of the thylakoids from lane T (lane 1) leads to the generation of two fragments, one of which contains precisely twice as much 35S radioactivity as the other (data not shown, from PhosphorImager analysis). On the basis of the data described above, the stronger, lower band most likely represents the first transmembrane region (TM1) and the other (TM2) is the C-terminal transmembrane span. If the thylakoids are washed with urea after trypsin treatment, a proportion of the fragments are extracted (lane 2) whereas the same fragments observed inlane 1 are obtained if the membranes are urea-treated prior to proteolysis (lane 3). Clearly, mature PsaK is far more resistant to urea extraction than either of the single-span degradation fragments and we believe that this reflects the ability of urea to partially extract small, single-span proteins, whereas proteins containing two or more spans are almost totally resistant. We have observed a similar phenomenon with single-span proteins bearing signal peptides: the precursor proteins adopt loop conformations in the membrane that are far more resistant to urea extraction than the single-span mature proteins (27Thompson S.J. Robinson C. Mant A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4059-4066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The primary aim in this work was to analyze the mechanism by which PsaK inserts into the thylakoid membrane, and for these experiments we usedin vitro assays for the insertion of radiolabeled protein into purified pea thylakoids. Our criteria for correct insertion were (i) that the protein should be resistant to urea extraction and (ii) that trypsin should generate the two degradation products observed after import of pPsaK as shown in Fig. 2. Fig.3A shows the results of incubating the pPsaK translation product (lane Tr) with thylakoids in the presence of stromal extract: the mature protein is efficiently generated by SPP in the extract, a large proportion of mature PsaK becomes associated with the thylakoids (lane T) and urea extraction followed by trypsin digestion produces the two diagnostic degradation products (TM1 and TM2). These results effectively confirm that insertion is taking place. However, the full precursor protein is unsuitable for detailed tests on the insertion requirements because stromal extract (which contains essentially all of the SRP) cannot be omitted since it also contains almost all of the stromal peptidase required to generate the mature form of PsaK. The N terminus of the mature PsaK is located in the lumen, which means that processing to the mature size must precede insertion. We have found that the full precursor form does not insert correctly in the absence of stromal extract (see below), which is not surprising because the entire presequence would have to be translocated across the thylakoid membrane. Further experiments were therefore conducted with a mature size PsaK translation product synthesized from a truncated cDNA as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 3B shows assays for the insertion of this construct (denoted PsaK) into isolated thylakoids. After each assay, samples of the thylakoids were either treated with trypsin (upper panel) or urea-extracted (lower panel). PsaK again inserts into isolated thylakoids and the inserted protein is again converted to the diagnostic degradation products TM1 and TM2 (“+trypsin” panel). As a control, we incubated the translation product with trypsin in the absence of membranes (lane Tr+) and this procedure leads to an almost complete degradation of PsaK, with no evidence for either the TM1 or TM2 bands (providing further evidence that TM1 and TM2 represent membrane-integrated regions). In this assay, TM1 should contain three times as much [35S]Met as TM2 because of the initiation methionine introduced during the cloning procedure, which is located in the lumen after insertion and hence protected from proteolysis. In repeat assays such as those shown in Fig. 3B, the TM1:TM2 [35S]Met ratio was always near 3 (within 15% in each case) confirming correct insertion, and this is supported by the observation that the mature protein is equally resistant to urea extraction (“+ urea” panel). We have routinely found that PsaK inserts with very high efficiency in this assay system; 34% of translation product was found to be inserted in this particular experiment (based on the recovery of [35S]Met in TM1 and TM2) and insertion efficiencies of over 40% have been observed in other experiments (data not shown). The left hand panel of Fig. 3B shows assays carried out in the presence of stromal extract (SE) or Hepes-magnesium buffer (HM), and in each of these cases insertion was assayed either with or without pretreatment of the assay mixture with apyrase (indicated as ± above the lanes). This enzyme hydrolyzes nucleoside triphosphates in the mixture and totally blocks insertion by the SRP route (9Li X. Henry R. Yuan J. Cline K. Hoffman N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3789-3793Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 11Tu C.J. Schuenemann D. Hoffman N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27219-27224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). These lanes show that insertion is most efficient in the HM incubations, i.e. in the absence of stromal extract (and hence SRP). The presence of apyrase does, however, lead to a reduction in insertion efficiency (to 71% of the control value) but this is not due to SRP involvement because the presence of stromal extract also leads to a slight reduction in insertion efficiency (down to 81% of the HM value). Stromal extract contains essentially all of the SRP (see below) and this result rules out an SRP involvement. In the same experiment we also assessed the effects of including GMP-PNP and AMP-PNP (non-hydrolyzable analogs of GTP and ATP, respectively) in an attempt to identify the cause of the reduction observed with apyrase. GMP-PNP, in particular, is an effective inhibitor of SRP (11Tu C.J. Schuenemann D. Hoffman N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27219-27224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, neither analog inhibits insertion to any marked extent, either in the absence or presence of stromal extract (right-hand panel in Fig. 3B). As a control for these experiments we used insertion assays with Lhcb1, a known substrate for the SRP pathway. After insertion into thylakoids, Lhcb1 becomes highly resistant to trypsin digestion and a characteristic stable degradation product is generated (9Li X. Henry R. Yuan J. Cline K. Hoffman N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3789-3793Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 11Tu C.J. Schuenemann D. Hoffman N.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 1529-1532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Fig. 3C shows that insertion is completely dependent on stromal extract, as shown by the appearance of the degradation product in the SE panel. Insertion is also completely dependent on the presence of NTPs in the mixture as pretreatment with apyrase (lanes indicated by +) totally blocks insertion, as found previously (9Li X. Henry R. Yuan J. Cline K. Hoffman N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3789-3793Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 11Tu C.J. Schuenemann D. Hoffman N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27219-27224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). On the basis of these data we conclude that PsaK does not require SRP for its insertion and, because insertion is not even stimulated by the presence of stroma, we propose that insertion is indeed completely independent of SRP. Insertion is, however, slightly inhibited by apyrase treatment even in the absence of stromal extract, which indicates a mild stimulatory influence of an ATP or GTP-hydrolyzing factor in the wheat germ translation system. We believe the most likely explanation to be an anti-aggregation effect of chaperones in the wheat germ extract which may prevent some PsaK molecules from adopting an insertion-incompetent conformation. The above studies rule out a central role for NTP hydrolysis in the insertion of PsaK but to obtain a more comprehensive picture of the energy requirements we tested whether the thylakoidal proton motive force stimulates insertion. Fig.4A shows the effect of nigericin (a proton ionophore) on the import and sorting of pPsaK in intact chloroplasts. In the control assay, the protein is found exclusively in the thylakoid fraction, and only as the mature form. With nigericin present, however, some imported protein is found in the stromal fraction and it is notable that the primary stromal form is the full precursor protein. Some mature PsaK is also found in the stroma, together with a further, intermediate-size protein (iPsaK) that may represent a processing intermediate (alternatively, this may result from proteolysis of pPsaK). From these data it is evident that optimal insertion efficiency is dependent on the thylakoidal proton electrochemical gradient, Δμ̃H+. The appearance of the full precursor protein, furthermore, suggests that pPsaK is not necessarily processed immediately upon entry into the stroma, and we suggest in addition that at least some molecules may be processed only during the later stages of the insertion pathway, since the appearance of pPsaK most likely stems from an inhibition of insertion. To obtain further data on the Δμ̃H+dependence of insertion we conducted thylakoid insertion assays with PsaK in the presence of nigericin (Fig. 4B). The data show that the presence of nigericin (lanes N) reduces insertion efficiency to a moderate extent when compared with the control samples shown in lanes C (in this experiment by 20–25%) in both the presence and absence of stromal extract. Taken together, these data indicate that the Δμ̃H+stimulates PsaK insertion but is not essential. The data shown in Figs. 3 and 4 exclude the involvement of SRP or NTPs in PsaK insertion but it is equally important to understand whether membrane-bound translocation machinery is involved. The question of Alb3 involvement is critical because the homologo"

The murine ameloblastin promoter functions in a cell type-specific manner and containscis-acting elements that function both to enhance and to suppress transcription. The objective of this study was to determine whether the transcription factor Cbfa1, known to be essential for transcription of other mineralized tissue genes, is also required for ameloblastin transcription. Site-directed mutagenesis of the Cbfa1-binding site (−248 base pairs) termed osteoblast-specific element 2 (OSE2) decreased ameloblastin promoter activity by greater than 50% in ameloblast-like cells. No differences in promoter activity were observed in two other oral tissue-derived cell lines transfected with similar constructs. Nuclear factor binding to the ameloblastin promoter was also shown to be cell type-specific and was altered by site-specific mutations in the OSE2 site. Cbfa1 was specifically shown to participate in the DNA-protein complexes between nuclear factors and the ameloblastin OSE2 site by supershift electrophoretic mobility shift assays. The findings that Cbfa1 interacts with functionally important regions of the ameloblastin promoter while promoter activity is diminished in constructs containing site-directed mutations in the Cbfa1 site indicate that Cbfa1 possesses an important function in transcription of the ameloblastin gene."

ApsbT-deficient mutant (ΔpsbT) of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii grows photoautotrophically, whereas its growth is significantly impaired in strong light. To understand the photosensitivity of ΔpsbT, we have studied the effect of strong illumination on PSII activity and proteins. It is shown that the level of PSII activity and proteins is reduced in the ΔpsbT more significantly than in wild type under strong light. When recovery of the photodamaged PSII is inhibited by a chloroplast protein synthesis inhibitor, the light-induced inactivation and degradation of PSII occur similarly in wild-type and mutant cells. On the contrary, the recovery of PSII activity after partial photoinactivation is remarkably delayed in the ΔpsbTcells, suggesting that PsbT is required for efficient recovery of the photodamaged PSII complex. These results therefore present the first evidence for involvement of this small PSII polypeptide in the recovery process.

Although light energy is essential for photosynthesis, excess light is harmful to photosynthetic apparatus. Damage to photosynthetic apparatus caused by excess light is designated as photoinhibition and it is generally accepted that the primary target for the photoinhibition is PSII (1Barber J. Andersson B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 61-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar, 2Aro E.-M. Virgin I. Andersson B. Biochim. Biophys.

It has been proposed that strong light illumination of photosynthetic organisms results in the overreduction of the primary acceptor of PSII, QA to QAH2 and the subsequent release of QAH2 from the PSII complex. In light, the PSII complex depleted of QAgenerates the triplet state of P680, which produces a singlet excited oxygen species (1O2) in the presence of oxygen. Since 1O2 is a very reactive and strongly oxidizing species, it may damage PSII proteins, in particular the D1 protein, as well as PSII cofactors (5Telfer A. Oldham T.C. Phillips D. Barber J. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B Biol. 1999; 48: 89-96Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The damaged D1 is degraded and subsequently replaced by a newly synthesized copy. This light-induced rapid turnover of D1 as well as replacement of cofactors are essential for maintaining PSII activity in light (6Schuster G. Timberg R. Ohad I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 177: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In addition to this acceptor side photoinhibition, donor side photoinhibition occurs when the oxygen-evolving complex is inhibited. In this case, strong oxidants that are accumulated on the primary electron donor, P680, and/or the secondary electron donor, Yz, are thought to trigger degradation of the D1 protein (1Barber J. Andersson B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 61-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar, 2Aro E.-M. Virgin I. Andersson B. Biochim. Biophys.

The PSII complex consists of a number of cofactors and more than 20 subunits. The major redox components involved in the photochemical reaction are present in the two homologous reaction center polypeptides, D1 and D2 (D1/D2 heterodimer), that are encoded by the chloroplast psbA and psbD genes, respectively, in eukaryotes (7Nanba O. Satoh K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 109-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The core antenna complexes, CP47 and CP43, of which the apoproteins are encoded by the chloroplast psbB andpsbC genes, respectively, and cytochromeb559 coded for by the chloroplastpsbE and psbF genes are closely associated with the D1/D2 heterodimer (7Nanba O. Satoh K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 109-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to these polypeptides containing cofactors, the PSII complex contains the lumenal extrinsic polypeptides, OEE1, OEE2, and OEE3, encoded by the nuclearpsbO, psbP, and psbQ genes, respectively (8Seidler A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1277: 35-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), and approximately 10 hydrophobic small polypeptides (9Takahashi Y. J. Plant Res. 1998; 111: 101-111Crossref Google Scholar). The three extrinsic polypeptides are known to be involved in O2 evolution, while the small polypeptides might be required for assembly, stability, and/or optimal function of PSII. However, the specific role of the small polypeptides mostly remains to be elucidated. The PsbT polypeptide with a molecular mass of 4 kDa is one of the small polypeptides of the PSII core complex and has a putative transmembrane helix (10Monod C. Takahashi Y. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Rochaix J.-D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2724-2754Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This polypeptide is encoded by the chloroplastpsbT gene; this gene was tentatively called ycf8(hypothetical chloroplast open reading frame 8) and was designated aspsbS in a previous paper (10Monod C. Takahashi Y. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Rochaix J.-D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2724-2754Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). According to the international gene nomenclature, this gene is renamed psbT. The psbT gene is located in a highly conserved gene cluster,psbB-psbT-psbN-psbH genes, in the chloroplast genome (11Ohyama K. Fukuzawa H. Kohchi T. Shirai H. Sano T. Sano S. Umesono K. Shiki Y.

Takahashi Y. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Rochaix J.-D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2724-2754Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar), a psbT deletion mutant (ΔpsbT) has been generated from the green algaChlamydomonas reinhardtii by particle-gun mediated chloroplast transformation. The resulting mutant was able to grow photoautotrophically like wild type in the moderate light. Since the activity and amount of PSII in the mutant were only slightly impaired as compared with those in wild-type cells, it was concluded that PsbT is not essential for synthesis, stability, and function of the PSII complex. An intriguing characteristic of the ΔpsbT mutant is that the cell growth and PSII activity were significantly impaired under certain adverse growth conditions. Interestingly, no mutant cell growth was observed under light stress conditions. This finding suggests that PSII is more photosensitive in the ΔpsbTmutant cells than in wild-type cells. In this study, we have characterized the activity and stability of PSII during strong illumination as well as the recovery of photodamaged PSII. We show that the steady-state level of PSII activity decreased more significantly in ΔpsbT mutant cells in strong light as compared with wild-type cells. According to the results presented here, PsbT does not play a role in the protection of PSII against photoinhibition but is essential for the efficient recovery of the photodamaged PSII. Since the synthesis of chloroplast-encoded proteins was not affected after strong light illumination, PsbT appears to be involved in a post-translational step in the repair process. The possible role of PsbT in the repair process of the photodamaged PSII is discussed. C. reinhardtiiwild-type strain 137c and a psbT deletion mutant (ΔpsbT) were used in the present study. The ΔpsbT transformants were generated by particle-gun mediated chloroplast transformation as described (10Monod C. Takahashi Y. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Rochaix J.-D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2724-2754Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to mid-log phase (4 × 106 cells ml−1) in Tris acetate-phosphate (TAP) medium at 25 °C in the dim light (10 μmol of photons m−2 s−1) (17Gorman D.S. Levine R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 54: 1665-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar). To study the effects of strong light illumination on PSII activity and proteins, cells from mid-log phase were collected by centrifugation (3,200 × g for 10 min at 25 °C) and then resuspended in TAP medium at 10 μg of Chl ml−1. The cells were exposed to strong illumination (4,000 μmol of photons m−2 s−1) or kept in the dark as a control. The rate of PSII photodamage was estimated in the presence of chloramphenicol (200 μg ml−1), which was added to cultures 10 min prior to experiments. To study the recovery of photodamaged PSII activity, cells were photoinhibited for 15 min and subsequently incubated either in the light (40 μmol of photons m−2 s−1) or dark. O2 evolution of cells (10 μg of Chl ml−1) was measured by a Clark-type O2 electrode using actinic light intensity of 5,000 μmol of photons m−2 s−1. The reaction mixture contained TAP medium and 0.2 mmphenyl-p-benzoquinone.

Separated polypeptides were electrophoretically blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes and probed with specific polyclonal antibodies. The signals were visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) method. To estimate the amount of PSII proteins, a dilution series (50, 25, and 12.5%) of total cell proteins from non-illuminated cells was blotted onto the same nitrocellulose membrane and used for a calibration standard. Quantification of polypeptides was performed by scanning the signals with a Personal Scanning Imager PD110 densitometer (Molecular Dynamics). Antibody raised against D1 was kindly provided by Dr. M. Ikeuchi of University of Tokyo. Cells grown to mid-log phase (4 × 106 cells ml−1) were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in TAP medium containing no sulfur and incubated for 2 h. The cells (10 μg of Chl ml−1) were either exposed to the strong light or incubated in the dark for 15 min, subsequently incubated in the dark in the presence of cycloheximide (10 μg ml−1) for 5 min, and then kept in the low light (40 μmol of photons m−2s−1). The pulse labeling was carried out with [35S]Na2SO4 (50 μCi ml−1) in low light for 30 min.

The PSII core complex was purified from the middle band by DEAE-Toyopearl 650S column chromatography with a linear gradient of NaCl from 25 to 175 mm in elution buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 0.05% DM. The purified PSII core complex (85 μg of Chl ml−1) was dissociated in the presence of 0.5 m potassium thiocyanate (KSCN) at 25 °C for 60 min (22Yamaguchi N. Takahashi Y. Satoh K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1988; 29: 123-129Google Scholar). The dissociation was terminated by addition of 30 times volume of ice-cold 0.05% DM solution. The dissociated PSII subcore complexes were separated by DEAE-Toyopearl 650S column chromatography. It has previously been reported by cell growth experiments on solid medium that the psbT-deletion mutant (ΔpsbT) ofChlamydomonas is able to grow photoautotrophically and mixotrophically under moderate light conditions (90 μmol of photons m−2 s−1) while the growth of this mutant is significantly impaired by strong light illumination (1,200 μmol of photons m−2 s−1) (10Monod C. Takahashi Y. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Rochaix J.-D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2724-2754Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To verify the effect of high irradiance on cell growth more quantitatively, we analyzed the growth rate of wild-type and ΔpsbT cells in liquid TAP medium both in strong light and in darkness. Cells grown to 4 × 106 cells ml−1 in the dim light (10 μmol of photons m−2 s−1) were diluted to 5 × 105 cells ml−1 prior to analysis of cell growth. Fig.1 A shows exponential growth of the wild-type and ΔpsbT cells with a doubling time of 12 h in the dark. However, in strong light (4,000 μmol of photons m−2 s−1), the wild-type cells showed a lag-phase of several hours and a subsequent exponential growth with a doubling time of 8 h (Fig. 1 B). This lag-phase suggests that cells grown in low light need to become adapted to the strong light condition before they start to propagate. In contrast to the wild-type cells, no increase in the ΔpsbT cell density was observed in strong light (Fig. 1 B). These results confirm the suppression of growth of ΔpsbT cells by excess light. It has been established that PSII is one of the major targets for photoinhibition caused by excess light. To evaluate the photoinhibition of PSII in ΔpsbT cells, we measured O2 evolution of cells that had been exposed to strong light illumination for various periods of time. Fig. 2 A shows that upon strong light illumination, the O2 evolution of wild-type cells was reduced to about 35% of the original level within 15 min. This initial drop in activity was terminated after a short period and followed by a short lag period. Subsequently the activity was restored to more than 50% of the original level after 4 h of strong light illumination. During prolonged strong light illumination, no further decrease in the activity was observed. This result is consistent with the lag-phase and subsequent logarithmic phase of the wild-type cell growth in strong light as shown in Fig. 1 B. The extent of the inactivation in ΔpsbT cells was obviously more significant than that of wild-type cells, although the initial drop of the activity occurred at the same rate as for wild-type cells. It is noted that a slow decrease in the PSII activity continued in the ΔpsbT cells during prolonged strong light illumination. The activity was decreased to ∼15% of the original activity after strong light illumination for 12 h. In the dark, no decrease in O2 evolution was observed in both strains (data not shown). To address the question as to whether the strong light-induced inactivation of O2 evolution results from a decrease in the steady-state level of the PSII complex, we analyzed the accumulation of PSII proteins in wild-type and ΔpsbT cells in strong light. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the wild-type cells contained constant amounts of major PSII proteins except for PsbT in strong light. The amount of PsbT was slightly reduced at longer than 12 h of strong illumination. In contrast, in ΔpsbT cells, the level of major PSII proteins were gradually reduced during strong light illumination. The decrease in PSII proteins was, however, much slower than the initial photoinhibition of O2 evolution. The accumulation of PSI polypeptide was constant in both strains in strong light. In the dark, the amount of PSII and PSI polypeptides was also constant (data not shown). Therefore, it is concluded that the initial rapid photoinactivation of O2 evolution cannot be ascribed to decrease in amount of PSII proteins. The decrease in PSII activity in strong light should be determined by the relative rates of photoinactivation of PSII and repair of the photodamaged PSII complex. Therefore, the enhanced decrease in PSII activity of ΔpsbTunder strong light conditions could result from accelerated photoinactivation of PSII and/or decreased repair activity of the photodamaged PSII. In order to investigate these possibilities, we measured the rate of photoinactivation of O2 evolution in the presence of an inhibitor of chloroplast translation, chloramphenicol, which blocks the repair of photodamaged PSII (see Fig.4 C). Fig. 3 A shows that the activity of wild type and ΔpsbT decreased at the same rate with a half-decay time of 12 min. Thus PsbT does not protect PSII activity against excess light irradiation. Interestingly, the initial photoinactivation of PSII in the absence of chloramphenicol shown in Fig. 2 A was comparable to that in the presence of the inhibitor. These results suggest that the repair of photodamaged PSII complex is rather slow in the cells that had been adapted to dim light and the repair process is activated by strong light illumination.Figure 3Kinetics of inactivation of PSII activity and degradation of PSII proteins during the strong light illumination.The cells (10 μg of Chl ml−1) were illuminated at 4,000 μmol of photons m−2 s−1 at 25 °C in the presence of chloramphenicol (200 μg ml−1). A,light-induced inactivation of O2 evolution in wild-type and ΔpsbT cells. The activity was measured as described in the legend to Fig. 2. B, light-induced degradation of PSII proteins. PSI and PSII proteins were detected by Western analysis. To estimate the amount of the proteins during the illumination, a dilution series (50, 25, and 12.5%) of total cell proteins from non-illuminated cells was also analyzed for a calibration standard. Relative amounts of proteins were estimated by scanning the signals with a densitometer. The half-decay times of D1, D2, CP47, and CP43 were estimated to be 15, 15, 25, and 25 min, respectively, in wild-type and mutant cells. The half-decay time of PsbT in wild-type cells was estimated to be 17 min.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The strong light-induced decrease in PSII proteins in the ΔpsbT as shown in Fig. 2 B could be due to an accelerated degradation during the illumination and/or a decreased efficiency of repair of the photodamaged PSII with newly synthesized proteins. Therefore, the rate of photodegradation of PSII proteins was measured in the presence of chloramphenicol. Fig. 3, B andC, show that the whole PSII complex was photodegraded in a similar manner in both strains while the amount of PSI polypeptide was constant. In the dark, PSII proteins remained constant during the experimental period (data not shown). The rates of photodegradation of PSII proteins were estimated by scanning the signals with a densitometer and are summarized in the legend of Fig. 3. It was revealed that no difference in the photodegradation rates of the D1, D2, CP43, and CP47 proteins was observed between wild-type and ΔpsbT cells. The photodegradation of D1/D2 heterodimer (t12 = 15 min) occurred immediately after the photoinactivation of O2evolution (t12 = 12 min). The photodegradation of CP43 and CP47 was much slower (t12 = 25 min). Thus, the absence of PsbT does not affect photodegradation of the PSII complex. Interestingly, the half-decay time of PsbT during strong light illumination was estimated to be 17 min, which is only slightly slower than that of the D1 and D2. Since the primary target for the photodegradation is D1, it can be concluded that D2 is highly unstable in the absence of D1 probably because of the formation of the D1/D2 heterodimer. PsbT is also rather unstable under the photoinhibition condition, suggesting a close interaction of this polypeptide with the D1/D2 heterodimer. The observations shown in Fig. 3 suggest that PsbT could be involved in the recovery of photodamaged PSII complex rather than in the photo-protection of the PSII complex. To confirm this possibility, we analyzed the recovery of O2 evolution after photoinhibition. O2 evolution of wild-type and ΔpsbT cells was inhibited by about one-half of the original level by illuminating the cells with strong light (4,000 μmol of photons m−2 s−1) for 15 min. Subsequently, the cells were incubated either in the dark or in low light (40 μmol photons m−2 s−1) to measure the recovery of photodamaged PSII activity. Fig. 4 A shows that the photodamaged activity of wild-type cells was recovered to the initial level after 60 min of the low light illumination while recovery of the activity in ΔpsbT cells was approximately four times slower. The recovery of PSII activity was also observed in the dark although at a very low rate. To recover to the initial level in wild-type cells, about 4 h was needed. The recovery in ΔpsbT cells in the dark was also delayed to a similar extent as compared with the wild-type cells (Fig. 4 B), indicating that the slower recovery in ΔpsbT in low light was not due to a low-light induced photoinhibition in this photosensitive mutant. These observations indicate that PsbT is required for the efficient recovery of photodamaged PSII. Fig.4 C shows that no recovery was observed in wild-type and ΔpsbT cells in the presence of chloramphenicol. As already shown (23Ohad I. Kyle D.J. Arntzen C.J. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 481-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), the recovery after photoinhibition requires de novo protein synthesis in the chloroplast. It is well known that D1 undergoes a rapid turnover during the photoinhibition-repair cycle. Thus, the slower repair of the photoinactivated PSII complex in ΔpsbT cells could be ascribed either to a partial photoinhibition of chloroplast-encoded protein synthesis, particularly D1, or to a less efficient post-translational event such as replacement of the photodamaged D1 by a newly synthesized copy. To study D1 synthesis during the recovery after photoinhibition, pulse labeling experiments were carried out. After cells were incubated either in the dark or in strong light (4,000 μmol of photons m−2s−1) for 15 min, pulse labeling was carried out with [35S]sulfate in low light (40 μmol of photons m−2 s−1) in the presence of an inhibitor of nuclear-encoded protein synthesis, cycloheximide. The presence of cycloheximide does not affect the recovery of photodamaged PSII (23Ohad I. Kyle D.J. Arntzen C.J. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 481-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 shows that major PSII proteins such as D1, D2, CP43, and CP47 as well as the large subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RbcL) were clearly labeled in low light in the cells of wild-type and ΔpsbTstrains that had been incubated in the dark prior to the pulse labeling (Fig. 5, lane D). In wild-type cells, the strong light illumination increased the intensity of pulse-labeled D1 severalfold. The intensity of the labeled D2 also became stronger while CP43, CP47, and RbcL did so only slightly. This light-induced enhancement of protein synthesis was maintained at least for 60 min in low light. It is revealed that synthesis of the major PSII proteins is activated by strong light illumination in wild-type cells. A very similar strong light-induced enhancement of pulse labeling was observed in the ΔpsbT strain. These observations indicate that the absence of PsbT did not affect the protein synthesis activity of D1 as well as the other major PSII proteins during strong light illumination. It is thus concluded that PsbT is required for a post-translational event(s) in the recovery process of PSII complex, in particular photodamaged D1. It has already been demonstrated that PsbT is associated with the PSII core complex that contains the D1/D2 heterodimer, CP43, CP47, and several small polypeptides (10Monod C. Takahashi Y. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Rochaix J.-D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2724-2754Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, the exact location of this polypeptide within the core complex is poorly understood. To investigate the localization of PsbT within the complex, purified PSII core complex was disintegrated into subcore complexes with a chaotropic reagent, potassium thiocyanate (KSCN) as described under “Materials and Methods.” The resulting PSII subcore complexes were subsequently fractionated into three distinct fractions (I, II, and III) by DEAE ion-exchange column chromatography, as shown in Fig.6. Fractions I and II contain core antenna complexes, CP43 and CP47, respectively, and fraction III was mainly composed of the D1/D2 heterodimer. Under this disintegration condition, CP43 and CP47 were almost completely dissociated from the PSII reaction center complex (Fig. 6 B). It is noted that approximately two-thirds of the PsbT was separated in fraction III, indicating its co-purification with the D1/D2 heterodimer. The remaining one-third of PsbT was separated at low concentration of NaCl (<10 mm). Incubation of the PSII core complex in the buffer containing 0.05% DM but not KSCN at 25 °C resulted in only a partial disintegration of CP43 and CP47 from the core complex (data not shown). In this case, neither release of PsbT nor its co-purification with the partially dissociated CP43 or CP47 was observed. PsbT was only detected in the fraction containing both non-dissociated PSII core complex and subcore complexes that were depleted of either CP43 or CP47. It is therefore concluded that all PsbT is originally located in D1/D2 heterodimer. It has already been observed that PsbT is co-purified with PSII core complex in Chlamydomonas (10Monod C. Takahashi Y. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Rochaix J.-D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2724-2754Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and is present in a PSII subcore complex depleted of CP43 in spinach (24Zheleva D. Sharma J. Panico M. Morris H.R. Barber J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16122-16127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In the present study, partial disintegration of the PSII core complex and subsequent fractionation has shown that PsbT is associated with the D1/D2 heterodimer, the PSII reaction center. Small polypeptides so far detected in the PSII reaction center are cytochrome b559, PsbI, and PsbW (7Nanba O. Satoh K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 109-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Ikeuchi M. Inoue Y. FEBS Lett. 1988; 24: 99-104Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 26Irrgang K.D. Shi L.-X. Funk C. Schroder W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17588-17593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus it can be concluded that PsbT is a new component of the PSII reaction center. According to a current model of the three-dimensional structure of transmembrane helices of PSII core complex obtained by electron crystallography on CP43-depleted non-oxygen evolving PSII complex (27Rhee K.-H. Morris E.P. Zheleve D. Hankamer B. Kühlbrandt W. Baber J. Nature. 1997; 396: 283-286Crossref Scopus (284) Google Scholar) and by x-ray crystallography on oxygen-evolving PSII complex (28Zouni A. Witt H.T. Kern J. Fromme P. Krauss N. Saenger W. Orth P. Nature. 2001; 409: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1776) Google Scholar), the D1/D2 heterodimer is located between CP43 and CP47. In addition to 22 transmembrane helices of the D1/D2 heterodimer, CP43, and CP47, seven helices are observed in the proximity to the D1/D2 heterodimer of the CP43-depleted PSII complex (27Rhee K.-H. Morris E.P. Zheleve D. Hankamer B. Kühlbrandt W. Baber J. Nature. 1997; 396: 283-286Crossref Scopus (284) Google Scholar). They probably correspond to the small hydrophobic polypeptides with a single transmembrane helix such as PsbE, PsbF, PsbI, PsbK, PsbL, PsbT, and PsbW. In the oxygen-evolving PSII complex, more helices which may correspond to small polypeptides were observed in the proximity of the D1/D2 heterodimer and core antenna complexes (28Zouni A. Witt H.T. Kern J. Fromme P. Krauss N. Saenger W. Orth P. Nature. 2001; 409: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1776) Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear whether PsbT has a direct interaction with D1. Although the psbT gene is co-expressed with the psbB gene (15Monod C. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Rochaix J.-D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 231: 449-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 29Johnson C.H. Schmidt G.W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 22: 645-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), no biochemical evidence for functional and/or structural interaction between PsbT and CP47 was obtained in the present study. Improved resolution of the three-dimensional structure of the PSII complex might demonstrate a possible interaction between PsbT and CP47. In Chlamydomonas, stable accumulation of the PSII complex is affected in mutants that are deficient in one of the small polypeptides associated with D1/D2 heterodimer. Mutants deficient in cytochromeb559 accumulate no detectable amount of PSII complex (30Morais F. Barber J. Nixon P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), whereas psbI-deficient mutants accumulate PSII complex only to 20–30% of the wild-type level (31Künstner P. Guardiola A. Takahashi Y. Rochaix J.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9651-96540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Probably the absence of these polypeptides affects stability and/or synthesis of the PSII complex. In contrast to these mutants, the content and activity of the PSII complex is reduced by only ∼10% in the ΔpsbTmutant (10Monod C. Takahashi Y. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Rochaix J.-D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2724-2754Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The difference of the phenotype among these mutants may reflect different localization of the small polypeptides in and/or binding mode to the D1/D2 heterodimer. Photodegradation of PsbT was rather fast compared with that of CP43 and CP47 and only slightly slower than that of D1 in the presence of chloramphenicol (Fig. 3 B). The photodegradation of the whole PSII complex may largely be due to a pleiotropic effect; when D1 is primarily photodegraded and is not replaced by a newly synthesized copy, the whole PSII complex becomes unstable. D2 appears to be rather unstable in the absence of D1 because D2 was photodegraded as rapidly as D1 as shown in Fig. 3. In fact, no detectable amount of D2 was observed in a psbA deletion mutant, Fud7, that completely lacks D1 (32Bennoun P. Spierer-Herz M. Erickson J. Girard-Bscou J. Pierre Y. Delsome M. Rochaix J.-D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1986; 6: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) (data not shown). The marked instability of PsbT during photoinhibition compared with CP43 and CP47 may result from its close association with D1. Prolonged illumination of wild-type cells with strong light resulted in a gradual decrease in the steady-state level of PsbT although the other PSII proteins remained constant (Fig.2 B). This observation suggests that photodegraded PsbT is not replaced by a newly synthesized copy efficiently enough, probably because synthesis of PsbT might be slower than that of D1. It is noted that the nuclear-encoded PsbW is also as unstable as D1 during photoinhibition in the isolated thylakoid (33Hagman A. Shi L.-X. Rintamaki E. Andersson B. Schroder W.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12666-12671Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether the steady-state level of PsbW is reduced in vivo during strong light illumination. We have shown that strong light illumination results in significantly reduced steady-state levels both of PSII activity and proteins in ΔpsbT mutant cells compared with wild-type cells. In the absence of PsbT, the rates of photoinactivation and photodegradation of PSII complex were not affected, while recovery of photoinhibited PSII activity was remarkably delayed. Thus PsbT is required for efficient recovery of the photodamaged PSII complex. The inefficient recovery of the photodamaged PSII leads to reduced steady-state levels of PSII activity and proteins and probably a defect in cell growth in strong light. Thus this is the first evidence that one of the small hydrophobic polypeptides of PSII is involved in the repair process of the photodamaged PSII. The repair of the photodamaged PSII activity is a multistep process. This includes replacement of photodamaged D1 and other PSII proteins by newly synthesized copies, and integration and reactivation of cofactors that were lost during the replacement of the photodamaged PSII proteins. It is known that the synthesis of D1 occurs in the stroma-exposed thylakoids, while the functional complex is preferentially located in the grana thylakoids (34Mattoo A.K. Edelman M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Thus the repair process may require a lateral translocation of the PSII complex between the grana and stroma-exposed thylakoids. As shown in Fig. 5, strong light illumination enhanced the protein synthesis activity in both wild-type and ΔpsbT mutant strains to a similar extent. It is therefore concluded that the synthesis of chloroplast-encoded proteins was not affected by photoinhibition treatment in the absence of PsbT. Thus we can conclude that a post-translational event(s) of the repair process is impaired in the absence of PsbT. However, it remains unclear how PsbT facilitates the recovery of photodamaged PSII complex. Close localization of PsbT in the D1/D2 heterodimer suggests that this polypeptide could form a scaffold for the replacement of the photodamaged D1 by a newly synthesized copy. The replacement of D1 could be stimulated by a hydrophobic interaction between PsbT and D1. Alternatively, PsbT might be required for maintaining a structure of the D1-depleted PSII complex. It is expected that the PSII core complex depleted of D1 might accumulate transiently during the damage-repair cycle. If the structure of the D1-depleted PSII complex was modified by the absence of PsbT, the insertion of newly synthesized D1 into the D1-depleted PSII complex and/or a subsequent structural organization of the replaced D1 in the PSII complex would be affected. Accordingly, the absence of PsbT would lead to accumulation of the unstable PSII complexes to a larger extent, which could lead to a decreased steady-state level of PSII complex in strong light. The repair of the photodamaged PSII also requires assembly and reactivation of PSII cofactors that were lost during D1 replacement. Since D1 binds photosynthetic pigments, plastoquinone, and the oxygen-evolving manganese complex, these cofactors must be assembled into the repaired complex, and reactivated during or after the reinsertion of D1 into a D1-depleted PSII complex. The PsbT in the vicinity of the D1/D2 heterodimer might facilitate this process. In order to resolve the recovery steps in which PsbT is specifically involved, it will be necessary to measure partial electron transfer activity of PSII during photoinhibition and recovery processes and estimate contents of redox components such as pheophytin, plastoquinone, and manganese atom.

Recently, the rat homologue of PIASxα named ARIP3 (for androgen receptor interaction protein 3), has been suggested to act as a coregulator of androgen receptor (AR) (29Moilanen A.M. Karvonen U.

Genetic studies indicate that the Drosophila PIAS protein negatively regulates the Drosophila Jak-STAT pathway (41Betz A. Lampen N. Martinek S. Young M.W. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9563-9568Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar).We report here that the PIAS family of proteins has proapoptotic activity. PIAS1 induced apoptosis in both human 293T cells and human osteosarcoma cells. Ectopic expression of PIAS1 activates JNK kinase, which is required for PIAS1-mediated apoptosis. In addition, the proapoptotic activity of PIAS1 is independent of the ability of PIAS1 to repress Stat1-mediated transcription. Taken together, our results reveal a novel function of PIAS1 to trigger JNK-dependent apoptosis.DISCUSSIONIn this paper, we have provided strong evidence to demonstrate a novel function of PIAS1 in the activation of JNK and apoptosis. We showed that PIAS1-induced apoptosis is dependent on JNK activation. Four different types of apoptotic assays were used to confirm the proapoptotic activity of PIAS1: the detection of apoptotic bodies, the examination of nuclear condensation by Hoechst staining, annexin V analysis, and the measurement of caspase 3 activity. In addition, PIAS-induced cell death was inhibited by the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk, the expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-xL, or a dominant negative caspase 9 mutant protein.Several lines of evidence indicate that PIAS1-induced apoptosis is mediated through JNK1 activation. First, JNK1 activation was observed after inducing PIAS1 expression for 12 h, whereas PIAS1-triggered apoptosis could be detected ∼40 h after PIAS1 induction. Thus, PIAS1-induced JNK1 activation precedes the apoptotic phenotype caused by PIAS1. Second, the level of JNK activation by PIAS1 is significant as compared with that by UV treatment at 200 J/m2, a dose significantly higher than physiological settings, suggesting that JNK activation may be important in PIAS1-triggered apoptosis. The most convincing data were derived from studies with the dominant-negative JNK. After introducing JNK1dn into the PIAS1 tet-off cell line, JNK1dn sufficiently blocked both PIAS1-induced JNK1 activation and PIAS1-mediated apoptosis, indicating that JNK1 is required for PIAS1-triggered apoptosis.Our data indicate that PIAS1 is a nuclear protein and that it triggers a nuclear signal to activate JNK. Previous studies suggest that JNK activation by UV radiation involves a series of cytoplasmic events (5Rosette C. Karin M. Science. 1996; 274: 1194-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar,6Sachsenmaier C. Radler-Pohl A. Zinck R. Nordheim A. Herrlich P. Rahmsdorf H.J. Cell. 1994; 78: 963-972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). The mechanism of JNK activation by nuclear signals such as DNA damage is not well understood. p53 can cause transcriptional up-regulation of gadd45 in response to genotoxic stress (37Kastan M.B.

It has been proposed that GADD45 and its related proteins can bind MTK1 to activate JNK (10Takekawa M. Saito H. Cell. 1998; 95: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that the overexpression of the nuclear protein BRCA1 induced JNK-dependent apoptosis coupled with up-regulation ofgadd45 (7Harkin D.P. Bean J.M. Miklos D. Song Y.H.

However, the role of GADD45 in mediating the stress-induced JNK activation has been challenged by a number of other studies. For example, stress-induced JNK activation is not altered ingadd45-deficient embryonic fibroblasts (11Shaulian E. Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29595-29598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 12Wang X. Gorospe M. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29599-29602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that PIAS1 can induce gadd45 expression. However, overexpression of GADD45 in U2OS cells failed to activate JNK or to trigger apoptosis. Thus, we conclude that PIAS1-inducedgadd45 expression is not sufficient to account for the PIAS1-mediated JNK activation and apoptosis. Since our in vitro studies suggest that PIAS1 itself does not directly activate JNK1 (Fig. 9), it is possible that PIAS1 can induce other genes to activate JNK.PIAS1 is an inhibitor of Stat1-mediated gene activation. To examine if the ability of PIAS1 to activate JNK and apoptosis is dependent on its inhibitory activity on Stat1, we characterized PIAS1Δ-(1–9), a mutant PIAS1 protein lacking the NH2-terminal 9 aa residues. PIAS1Δ-(1–9) failed to repress Stat1-mediated gene activation but retained its ability to activate JNK and to trigger apoptosis. Thus, PIAS1-mediated JNK activation and apoptosis are independent of the inhibitory role of PIAS1 in Stat1-mediated gene activation. The role of PIAS1 in the AR-mediated gene activation has also been suggested (39Tan J. Hall S.H. Hamil K.G. Grossman G. Petrusz P. Liao J. Shuai K. French F.S. Mol.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3880-3887Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). However, it seems unlikely that the proapoptotic activity of PIAS1 involves AR since PIAS1-induced apoptosis was observed in 293T cells, which do not express AR.JNK plays a critical role in the regulation of AP-1 transcriptional activity (15Ip Y.T.

Our finding that PIAS1 can activate JNK suggests a more broad involvement of PIAS1 in gene regulation. It will be of great interest in the future to identify signals that can activate the PIAS1-JNK pathway. The c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK)1 is activated by a variety of cellular signals including growth factors, inflammatory cytokines, and environmental stress (1Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3591) Google Scholar). Multiple signaling pathways can lead to JNK activation. It has been demonstrated that UV radiation results in the rapid activation of JNK (2Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J.

The activation of JNK by UV is mediated through the aggregation of cell surface receptors, which triggers a series of cytoplasmic events to activate JNK (5Rosette C. Karin M.

It has been reported that BRCA1-triggered JNK activation is coupled with the induction of gadd45, a growth arrest and DNA damage-induced gene (8Fornace Jr., A.J. Alamo Jr., I. Hollander M.C. Proc.

It was proposed that GADD45 may be involved in stress-induced JNK activation. However, recent studies indicate that stress-induced activation of JNK is not altered in gadd45-null embryonic fibroblasts (11Shaulian E. Karin M. J. Biol.

In this paper, we have provided strong evidence to demonstrate a novel function of PIAS1 in the activation of JNK and apoptosis. We showed that PIAS1-induced apoptosis is dependent on JNK activation. Four different types of apoptotic assays were used to confirm the proapoptotic activity of PIAS1: the detection of apoptotic bodies, the examination of nuclear condensation by Hoechst staining, annexin V analysis, and the measurement of caspase 3 activity. In addition, PIAS-induced cell death was inhibited by the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk, the expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-xL, or a dominant negative caspase 9 mutant protein. Several lines of evidence indicate that PIAS1-induced apoptosis is mediated through JNK1 activation. First, JNK1 activation was observed after inducing PIAS1 expression for 12 h, whereas PIAS1-triggered apoptosis could be detected ∼40 h after PIAS1 induction. Thus, PIAS1-induced JNK1 activation precedes the apoptotic phenotype caused by PIAS1. Second, the level of JNK activation by PIAS1 is significant as compared with that by UV treatment at 200 J/m2, a dose significantly higher than physiological settings, suggesting that JNK activation may be important in PIAS1-triggered apoptosis. The most convincing data were derived from studies with the dominant-negative JNK. After introducing JNK1dn into the PIAS1 tet-off cell line, JNK1dn sufficiently blocked both PIAS1-induced JNK1 activation and PIAS1-mediated apoptosis, indicating that JNK1 is required for PIAS1-triggered apoptosis. Our data indicate that PIAS1 is a nuclear protein and that it triggers a nuclear signal to activate JNK. Previous studies suggest that JNK activation by UV radiation involves a series of cytoplasmic events (5Rosette C. Karin M. Science. 1996; 274: 1194-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar,6Sachsenmaier C. Radler-Pohl A. Zinck R. Nordheim A. Herrlich P. Rahmsdorf H.J. Cell. 1994; 78: 963-972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). The mechanism of JNK activation by nuclear signals such as DNA damage is not well understood. p53 can cause transcriptional up-regulation of gadd45 in response to genotoxic stress (37Kastan M.B.

Hollander M.C. Fornace Jr., A.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 43-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that GADD45 and its related proteins can bind MTK1 to activate JNK (10Takekawa M. Saito H. Cell. 1998; 95: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that the overexpression of the nuclear protein BRCA1 induced JNK-dependent apoptosis coupled with up-regulation ofgadd45 (7Harkin D.P. Bean J.M. Miklos D. Song Y.H. Truong V.B. Englert C. Christians F.C. Ellisen L.W. Maheswaran S. Oliner J.D. Haber D.A. Cell. 1999; 97: 575-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). However, the role of GADD45 in mediating the stress-induced JNK activation has been challenged by a number of other studies. For example, stress-induced JNK activation is not altered ingadd45-deficient embryonic fibroblasts (11Shaulian E. Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29595-29598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 12Wang X. Gorospe M. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29599-29602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that PIAS1 can induce gadd45 expression. However, overexpression of GADD45 in U2OS cells failed to activate JNK or to trigger apoptosis. Thus, we conclude that PIAS1-inducedgadd45 expression is not sufficient to account for the PIAS1-mediated JNK activation and apoptosis. Since our in vitro studies suggest that PIAS1 itself does not directly activate JNK1 (Fig. 9), it is possible that PIAS1 can induce other genes to activate JNK. PIAS1 is an inhibitor of Stat1-mediated gene activation. To examine if the ability of PIAS1 to activate JNK and apoptosis is dependent on its inhibitory activity on Stat1, we characterized PIAS1Δ-(1–9), a mutant PIAS1 protein lacking the NH2-terminal 9 aa residues. PIAS1Δ-(1–9) failed to repress Stat1-mediated gene activation but retained its ability to activate JNK and to trigger apoptosis. Thus, PIAS1-mediated JNK activation and apoptosis are independent of the inhibitory role of PIAS1 in Stat1-mediated gene activation. The role of PIAS1 in the AR-mediated gene activation has also been suggested (39Tan J. Hall S.H. Hamil K.G. Grossman G. Petrusz P. Liao J. Shuai K. French F.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 14-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 40Gross M. Liu B. Tan J. French F.S. Carey M. Shuai K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3880-3887Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). However, it seems unlikely that the proapoptotic activity of PIAS1 involves AR since PIAS1-induced apoptosis was observed in 293T cells, which do not express AR. JNK plays a critical role in the regulation of AP-1 transcriptional activity (15Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar, 16Karin M.

Because of the unique problems that might attend the translation of such a short open reading frame, we have investigated the properties and the translation of the mRNAs encoding L41. In Saccharomyces cerevisiaeL41 is encoded by two linked genes, RPL41A andRPL41B. These genes give rise to mRNAs that have short 5′ leaders of 18 and 22 nucleotides and rather long 3′ leaders of 203 and 210 nucleotides not including their poly(A) tails. The mRNAs are translated exclusively on monosomes, suggesting that ribosomes do not remain attached to the mRNA after termination of translation. Calculations based on the abundance of ribosomes and of L41 mRNA indicate that the entire translation event, from initiation through termination, must occur in ∼2 s. Termination of translation after only 25 codons does not subject the mRNAs encoding L41 to nonsense-mediated decay.

During translation, their products will pass through a cavity in the large subunit of the ribosome, before emerging at the bottom of the subunit. This passage, originally identified by Yonath et al. (1Yonath A. Leonard K.R. Wittmann H.G. Science. 1987; 236: 813-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and recently analyzed at high resolution (2Ban N. Nissen P. Hansen J. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. Science. 2000; 289: 905-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (2783) Google Scholar), will accommodate some 30–40 amino acids (3Malkin L.I. Rich A. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 26: 329-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Because nearly all proteins are synthesized as polypeptides larger than 50 amino acids, they will naturally emerge from the ribosome during translation and be available for the folding chaperones (4McCallum C.D. Do H. Johnson A.E. Frydman J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 591-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). An exception to both these conventions is ribosomal protein L41. L41 was originally purified from the ribosomes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and identified as a very small, very basic protein that appeared to have orthologues in the ribosomes ofSchizosaccharomyces pombe and of man. The first 25 amino acids were sequenced by Edman degradation (5Otaka E. Higo K. Itoh T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 195: 544-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, cloning of the gene encoding L41 revealed that these 25 amino acids comprised its entire open reading frame (6Suzuki K. Hashimoto T. Otaka E. Curr. Genet. 1990; 17: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar)! Seventeen of its 25 amino acids are Arg or Lys. Thus, L41 is not only the smallest but also the most basic eukaryotic protein. L41 is highly conserved in eukaryotes (7Chan Y.L. Olvera J. Wool I.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 810-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar); indeed its mRNA is among the ten most abundant in a recent serial analysis of gene expression of human transcripts (8Velculescu V.E. Madden S.L. Zhang L. Lash A.E., Yu, J. Rago C. Lal A. Wang C.J. Beaudry G.A. Ciriello K.M. Cook B.P. Dufault M.R. Ferguson A.T. Gao Y. He T.C. Hermeking H. Hiraldo S.K. Hwang P.M.

L41 is present in certain archaea, e.g. Methanococcus jannaschii (9Bult C.J. White O. Olsen G.J. Zhou L. Fleischmann R.D. Sutton G.G. Blake J.A. FitzGerald L.M. Clayton R.A. Gocayne J.D.

Science. 1996; 273: 1058-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (2281) Google Scholar), but not in others. No clear orthologue has been found in eubacteria, although a protein with similar properties is present in certain thermophilic eubacteria, e.g. Thermus thermophilus (10Choli T. Franceschi F. Yonath A. Wittmann-Liebold B. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 374: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). (BEWARE: the name L41 has also been applied to a different fungal ribosomal protein, mutant alleles of which can cause resistance to cycloheximide (11Kawai S. Murao S. Mochizuki M. Shibuya I. Yano K. Takagi M. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 254-262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Dehoux P. Davies J. Cannon M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 841-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In the official nomenclature that protein is now known as L42 (13Mager W.H. Planta R.J. Ballesta J.P. Lee J.C. Mizuta K. Suzuki K. Warner J.R. Woolford Jr., J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4872-4875Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar).) In S. cerevisiae, L41 is encoded by two genes,RPL41A and RPL41B (6Suzuki K. Hashimoto T. Otaka E. Curr. Genet. 1990; 17: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). There is a single base difference in the ORFs1of the two genes, Ala-3 being encoded by GCC in RPL41A and by GCT in RPL41B. However, the two genes differ almost completely in both the 5′- and 3′-flanking regions. The mRNAs encoding L41 in S. cerevisiae have been reported to be about 325 nucleotides in length (6Suzuki K. Hashimoto T. Otaka E. Curr. Genet. 1990; 17: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), suggesting that they contain substantial amounts of 5′- and/or 3′-untranslated sequence. Because of the special features that might be apparent in the translation of such a short ORF, we have explored in more detail the mRNAs encoding L41 and their translation. We find that the mRNAs derived from the two genes both have short 5′-UTRs and unusually long 3′-UTRs. They are translated almost exclusively on single ribosomes. It is interesting that despite their translation terminating after only 25 codons the mRNAs encoding L41 are not subject to nonsense-mediated decay. Although L41 is found widely in nature, deletion of the two RPL41 genes does not prevent the growth of S. cerevisiae.

For the experiment in Fig. 3 two derivatives carrying theupf1::LEU2 gene disruption were used (15Vilardell J. Chartrand P. Singer R.A. Warner J.R. RNA. 2000; 6: 1773-1780Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in either yeast extract-peptone-dextrose or dropout medium, depending on the plasmid markers. Northern blot analysis was carried out as described previously (16Li B. Nierras C.R. Warner J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5393-5404Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). 32P-labeled RNAs were used as probes for RPL30, ACT1, andRPL41 mRNAs. Oligonucleotide probes specific forRPL41A and RPL41B mRNAs and for 18S rRNA and 25S rRNA were end-labeled with polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. The RACE method was adopted from Frohman (17Frohman M.A. PCR Methods Applications. 1994; 4: S40-S58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using three adaptor primers referred to as QT, QO, and QI: QT: CCAGTGAGCAGAGTGACGAGGACTCGAGCTCAAGCTTTTT- TTTTTTTTTTT QO: CCAGTGAGCAGAGTGACG QI: GAGGACTCGAGCTCAAGC 5 μg of total RNA (in a 2-μl volume) was primed with 40 ng of QT primer and reverse transcribed by 1 μl (200 units) of MMLV reverse transcriptase in a 10-μl reaction. The reaction mixture was diluted to 100 μl, and then two consecutive rounds of PCR amplification were carried out in a 50-μl PCR mixture (1 mm dNTPs, 1× PCR buffer, 1.5 mmMg2+, 2.5 units Taq polymerase). For the first round PCR, 1 μl of diluted cDNA pool together with 25 pmol of QO primer and 25 pmol of gene-specific primer 1 were used. For the second round, 25 pmol of QI primer and 25 pmol gene-specific primer 2 were used. Oligonucleotides used (See Fig. 1,lower panel) were: GSP1(A) GAACCAGACCACATCGATTC GSP2(A) CGATTCAATCGAAATGAGAGCC GSP1(B) TCGACTTAATTCCAAATGAG GSP2(B) GCTAAGTGGAGAAAGAAGAG 5 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed using 12.5 pmol of gene-specific primer and MMLV reverse transcriptase in a 10-μl reaction. The 5′ partial cDNA pool was diluted to 100 μl purified, concentrated to 10 μl, added to terminal transferase components (0.5 mm ATP, 1× TdT buffer, 0.5 μl of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase) to a final volume of 20 μl, and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. The product was diluted to 100 μl of which 1 μl was used for amplification by two rounds of PCR similar to 3′-RACE. Oligonucleotides used (See Fig. 1, lower panel) were: GSP1(A) GAGTTATTTACTCATAATC GSP2(A) TCCGCTTATTTGGATCTGG GSP1(B) TAACGATTTGCTCTCAAGC GSP2(B) TCCGCTTATTTGGATCTGG Yeast cells were grown in 50 ml of yeast extract-peptone-dextrose to mid-log phase and chilled by addition of crushed ice immediately following the addition of cycloheximide (50 μg/ml). The cells were harvested and washed twice in 0.1m NaCl, 0.03 m MgCl2, 0.01m Tris, pH 7.4, 50 μg/ml cycloheximide, 200 μg/ml heparin and resuspended in 0.5 ml LHB buffer (0.1 m NaCl, 0.03 m MgCl2, 0.01 m Tris, pH 7.4). Cells were lysed by vortexing with glass beads and the lysate centrifuged twice for 15 min. at 15,000 × g. The supernatant was layered onto a 7–47% sucrose gradient in TMN solution (0.05 m Tris acetate, pH 7.0, 0.05 mNH4Cl, 0.012 m MgCl2) and centrifuged at 4° for 3 h at 39,000 rpm in a SW41 rotor. Gradients were then collected through an ISCO fractionator into Eppendorf tubes containing 0.1 ml of 10% SDS. Each fraction was extracted with hot phenol and the RNA was collected by ethanol, fractionated on a denaturing agarose gel, and subjected to Northern analysis (16Li B. Nierras C.R. Warner J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5393-5404Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Primer Extension System-AMV Reverse Transcriptase (Promega) was used for primer extension analysis. 10 pmol of specific primer was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) using 10 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase, annealed to 10 μg of total RNA, and reverse transcribed using 1 unit of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase in a 20-μl reaction at 42 °C for 30 min. Primer extension products were electrophoresed on a denaturing 8% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea. The gel was dried and exposed in a phosphorimaging cassette. The RPL41 genes were deleted using a PCR-based one-step gene disruption (18Lorenz M.C. Muir R.S. Lim E. McElver J. Weber S.C. Heitman J. Gene. 1995; 158: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). A set of oligonucleotides that contain 45 nt of RPL41A flanking sequence and 23 nt of HIS3 sequence were designed to carry out PCR using the HIS3 gene in pRS303 as the template. An analogous set of oligonucleotides for the RPL41B andURA3 genes were used for PCR using the URA3 gene of pRS306. Amplified DNA fragments were purified and used to transform yeast cells by homologous recombination. Transformants were screened on selective plates. Total yeast DNA was digested withEcoRI, separated by electrophoresis on a 0.8% agarose gel, and transferred onto a Zeta-Probe blotting membrane.32P-labeled DNA probes were prepared by random primer extension of a fragment containing either the RPL41A orRPL41B gene and flanking sequences within the twoEcoRI cutting sites. To identify the ends of the RPL41 transcripts, we utilized the RACE method (17Frohman M.A. PCR Methods Applications. 1994; 4: S40-S58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). cDNAs representing the region between a single point in a mRNA transcript and its 3′- or 5′-end were amplified using PCR. Because the coding sequences of theRPL41 genes are nearly identical, it was necessary to use gene-specific primers, oriented in the direction of the missing sequence. Extension of the partial cDNAs from the unknown end of the message back to the known region is achieved using primers that anneal to the preexisting or an appended poly(A) tail. The amplified cDNA fragments were excised from an agarose gel and sequenced (Fig. 1). Unique sequences were found, suggesting that there is a single site of initiation and termination for each gene. Both RPL41A and RPL41BmRNA have unusually short 5′-UTRs, 22 nucleotides in the case ofRPL41A and 18 nucleotides for RPL41B. By contrast the 3′-UTRs are unusually long, ∼210 and ∼203nts forRPL41A and RPL41B, respectively. A similarly long 3′-UTR has been observed for the human transcript encoding L41 (19Klaudiny J. von der K.H. Scheit K.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Because the mRNAs end at a series of A residues in the gene (underlined), the exact site of the cleavage that precedes the addition of poly(A) is indeterminate. With the addition of ∼50 poly(A) residues, the sizes described in Fig. 1 would be consistent with a published size of 325 nt based on Northern analysis (6Suzuki K. Hashimoto T. Otaka E. Curr. Genet. 1990; 17: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Although the signals for cleavage and polyadenylation in S. cerevisiae are less rigid than in mammals, three elements have been identified (reviewed in Refs. 20Guo Z. Sherman F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 477-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar and 21Zhao J. Hyman L. Moore C. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 405-445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and supplemented with an extensive computer analysis (22Graber J.H. Cantor C.R. Mohr S.C. Smith T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14055-14060Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Comparison of the presence of these signals in the two RPL41 genes is illuminating. An “upstream” or “efficiency” element, UAUAUA, is present twice in the A gene but not the B gene. A “positioning” element, AAUAAA, is present in the B gene but only as a variant, AAUCAA, in the A gene. The poly(A) site, itself, generally Y(A)n , is present in the B gene but as the variant YG(A)n in the A gene. Termination at the latter may be enhanced by its (U)7 element that is reported to facilitate 3′-cleavage and poly(A) addition (22Graber J.H. Cantor C.R. Mohr S.C. Smith T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14055-14060Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Thus, the two genes each possess some but not all of the elements used to denote 3′-cleavage in yeast. The non-coding sequences of the two genes diverge from position −3 upstream of the ORF and from position +8 downstream of the ORF. Indeed, their putative transcription factor binding sites, from positions −200 to −600, differ substantially (23Lascaris R.F. Mager W.H. Planta R.J. Bioinformatics. 1999; 15: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Yet, the sum of the effects of transcription factor binding sites, transcription initiation sites, and 3′-cleavage signals provide just the appropriate amount of mRNA to enable equimolar synthesis of L41 with the other ribosomal proteins (see below). To ask how RPL41 mRNA is translated, we carried out a polyribosome analysis. Yeast ribosomes were separated in a 7–47% sucrose gradient, and total RNA from each fraction was extracted and subjected to a Northern analysis (Fig.2). The positions of 18S rRNA and the 25S rRNA indicate the 40S subunits and the 60S subunits, respectively.ACT1 mRNA, encoding a 478-amino acid protein, is primarily translated on higher order polyribosomes, most of which have run to the bottom of the gradient. RPL30 mRNA, encoding a 104-amino acid protein, is translated largely on dimer and trimer polysomes. By contrast, RPL41 mRNA, encoding its 25-amino acid protein, is translated exclusively on single ribosomes, although there is some forward spreading of the peak. The most recent estimate, based on sensitivity to hydroxyl radicals, is that about 58 nucleotides of mRNA are protected by a translating 70S-ribosome of Escherichia coli (24Huttenhofer A. Noller H.F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3892-3901Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The larger eukaryotic ribosome would probably protect a somewhat longer stretch. Thus, in mid-translation a single ribosome should occupy essentially the entire L41 ORF. When it reaches the termination codon, however, some 50 nucleotides should be available for the binding of a new 43S initiation complex. The few mRNAs with both a 43S-initiation complex as well as an 80S-ribosome might account for the forward spreading from the 80S-peak observed in Fig. 2, lower panel. Finally, Fig. 2suggests that the extensive 3′-UTR does not stably associate with a ribosome that has terminated translation. Nevertheless, it is possible that the long 3′-UTR of the RPL41 mRNAs facilitates the interaction of proteins bound to the 5′-CAP with those bound to poly(A), as suggested in the “circular” polyribosome model recently proposed (25Wells S.E. Hillner P.E. Vale R.D. Sachs A.B. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 135-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). Nonsense mediated decay (NMD) is a highly conserved mechanism used to rid the cell of mRNAs that are likely to produce aberrant proteins because of premature stop codons introduced either by mutation or by errors in splicing (reviewed in Ref. 26Czaplinski K. Ruiz-Echevarria M.J. Gonzalez C.I. Peltz S.W. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 685-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).UPF1 is one of the genes essential for NMD. Deletion ofUPF1 results in accumulation of aberrant mRNAs, such as the unspliced transcripts of the ribosomal protein gene,CYH2 (27He F. Peltz S.W. Donahue J.L. Rosbash M. Jacobson A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7034-7038Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). We asked whether the termination codon of either L41-encoding transcript, only 25 codons from the initiator, would invoke NMD. As shown in Fig. 3, it does not. There is no detectable difference in the level of L41 mRNA between strains carrying a UPF1 or aupf1::LEU2 allele, while the amount of pre-CYH2 mRNA increases substantially. Although this is perhaps to be expected because the L41 mRNAs are “natural”, this result emphasizes the extraordinary subtlety that one must invoke to explain NMD. The 3′-UTRs of the two L41 transcripts do not appear to contain a sequence match to the putative downstream elements that activate NMD (28Hagan K.W. Ruiz-Echevarria M.J. Quan Y. Peltz S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 809-823Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Zhang S. Ruiz-Echevarria M.J. Quan Y. Peltz S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2231-2244Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) although such an element has been identified in only a small fraction of yeast genes. Because most ribosomal proteins are essential, knockout experiments are usually conducted on diploid strains. On the other hand, in cases such as L41 where there are two genes, it is generally easier to analyze a double knockout by mating two single knockout strains and dissecting the resulting spores. However, in S. cerevisiae the two RPL41 genes are tightly linked on chromosome IV, separated by only 8 kb. Therefore, we started with a homozygous diploid strain, first disruptingRPL41A with a HIS3 marker (see “Materials and Methods”). Using this strain we disrupted RPL41B withURA3. We expect that half the URA3 disruptants would be on the same chromosome as the HIS3 disruptants. After the second transformation, several colonies that grew on a −His−Ura plate were subjected to PCR to identify colonies in which both the HIS3 and URA3 genes had integrated into the correct loci (data not shown). These double mutants were sporulated, and the resulting tetrads were analyzed. Unexpectedly, colonies with the genotype His+Ura+ survived. A Southern blot (Fig. 4) as well as primer extension (see below) demonstrated that both RPL41A andRPL41B had been successfully deleted. The haploid double mutant grows well on a −His−Ura plate at 30 °C as well as at 23 °C or 37 °C, showing that it is neither heat- nor cold-sensitive. As with most ribosomal proteins, the function of L41 is still unknown. Yet, it is surprising that this highly conserved protein seems almost entirely dispensable for growth. On the other hand, there is a report that L41 may be absent from the proteome of Caenorhabditis elegans (30Wheelan S.J. Boguski M.S. Duret L. Makalowski W. Gene. 1999; 238: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), suggesting that it is not essential even in higher organisms. Unfortunately, the one high-resolution structure of the large subunit is from Haloarcula marismortui, (2Ban N. Nissen P. Hansen J. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. Science. 2000; 289: 905-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (2783) Google Scholar) an archaeon that appears not to have a version of L41. To measure the contribution of the RPL41A and RPL41B genes to the cell, we made use of the fact that their mRNAs differ by 4 nt in the length of the 5′-UTR. Thus, the relative amount of the two transcripts can be assayed by primer extension, using a primer complementary to a sequence common to both ORFs. The primer used leads to a 105-nt band from the RPL41A transcript and a 101-nt band from the RPL41B transcript (Fig.5). It is apparent that in wild type cells the ratio of RPL41A mRNA to RPL41BmRNA is about 2:1. The amount of RPL41A mRNA appears to be similar to that of RPL30, determined to be about 35 copies/cell (31Holstege F.C.P. Jennings E.G. Wyrick J.J. Lee T.I. Hengartner C.J. Green M.R. Golub T.R. Lander E.S. Young R.A. Cell. 1998; 95: 717-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar), leading to an estimate of about 50 mRNAs/cell for mRNAs encoding L41. This is a useful value because the small L41 ORFs are omitted from many of the measurements of genome-wide transcription. In heterozygous diploid strains of genotypeRPL41A/rpl41A or RPL41B/rpl41B, the amount ofL41A or L41B mRNA is reduced ∼50%, respectively, as expected. Interestingly, in a haploidΔRPL41A strain the amount of L41B transcript increases about 35%, suggesting some measure of dosage compensation as has been shown for CRY2, encoding ribosomal protein S14 (32Li Z. Paulovich A.G. Woolford Jr., J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6454-6464Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). No obvious change in the level of L41 mRNA was observed in a haploid ΔRPL41B strain, perhaps reflecting the relatively larger amount of RPL41A transcript that is normally present. In the double knockout strain, no mRNA-encoding L41 is detected. A rapidly growing yeast cell has about 200,000 ribosomes. To accommodate a doubling time of 100 min, it must synthesize 2000 ribosomes and 2000 molecules of L41 each minute (33Warner J.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 437-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1391) Google Scholar). Our estimate (Fig. 5) of 50–60 mRNAs/cell encoding L41 means that each L41 mRNA is translated 30–40 times/min. Thus, the entire translational process, from initiation through termination, must occupy no more than about 2 s. Perhaps the extended 3′-UTR is necessary for the short L41 mRNA to circularize during translation through interaction of poly(A) binding protein and eIF4G (25Wells S.E. Hillner P.E. Vale R.D. Sachs A.B. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 135-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). The structure of the exit passage of the large ribosomal subunit has been solved to 2.4 Å resolution (2Ban N. Nissen P. Hansen J. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. Science. 2000; 289: 905-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (2783) Google Scholar). The passage is relatively narrow and tortuous, lined almost entirely with RNA helices. It is remarkable that L41 traverses this passage despite a) its high concentration of positive charge that should interact electrostatically with the walls of the passage, and b) its short length that should preclude its interaction with chaperonins at the surface of the ribosome that could assist its exit (4McCallum C.D. Do H. Johnson A.E. Frydman J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 591-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar)."
https://openalex.org/W2038840485,"Adipose cells produce and secrete several physiologically important proteins, such as lipoprotein lipase (LPL), leptin, adipsin, Acrp30, etc. However, secretory pathways in adipocytes have not been characterized, and vesicular carriers responsible for the accumulation and transport of secreted proteins have not been identified. We have compared the intracellular localization of two proteins secreted from adipose cells: leptin and LPL. Adipocytes accumulate large amounts of both proteins, suggesting that neither of them is targeted to the constitutive secretory pathway. By means of velocity centrifugation in sucrose gradients, equilibrium density centrifugation in iodixanol gradients, and immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, we determined that LPL and leptin were localized in different membrane structures. LPL was found mainly in the endoplasmic reticulum with a small pool being present in low density membrane vesicles that may represent a secretory compartment in adipose cells. Virtually all intracellular leptin was localized in these low density secretory vesicles. Insulin-sensitive Glut4 vesicles did not contain either LPL or leptin. Thus, secretion from adipose cells is controlled both at the exit from the endoplasmic reticulum as well as at the level of downstream secretory vesicles."

Similar to other dehydrogenases, HAD contains a general acid/base, His158, which is within hydrogen bond distance of a carboxylate, Glu170.

This observation, coupled with significantly reduced enzymatic stability of the E170Q mutant, implicates Glu170 in maintenance of active site architecture. Examination of the crystal structure of E170Q in complex with NAD+ and acetoacetyl-CoA (R = 21.9%, Rfree = 27.6%, 2.2 Å) reveals that Gln170 no longer hydrogen bonds to the side chain of His158.

Instead, the imidazole ring is nearly perpendicular to its placement in the comparable native complex and no longer positioned for efficient catalysis. l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase acetoacetyl-CoA trifunctional protein root mean square l-3-Hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HAD1; EC 1.1.1.35) is the penultimate enzyme in the β-oxidation spiral, reversibly catalyzing the oxidation of the hydroxyl group ofl-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA to a keto group, concomitant with the reduction of NAD+ to NADH, as shown in SchemeFS1. The dimeric enzyme displays broad substrate specificity, utilizing substrates with 4–16 carbons in the acyl chain (1Kobayashi A. Jiang L.L. Hashimoto T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 775-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Hydride transfer occurs at the pro-S position of the nicotinamide ring, making HAD a “B-side”-specific dehydrogenase (2Noyes B.E. Bradshaw R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 3052-3059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As illustrated, His158 is thought to serve as a general acid/base in the catalytic mechanism of HAD, with catalysis facilitated by the presence of a conserved glutamate residue, Glu170 (3He X.Y. Yang S.Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9625-9630Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 4He X.Y. Deng H. Yang S.Y.

Chem. 2000; 275: 27186-27196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the precise role of Glu170 in catalysis has not been established. Crystallographic studies of HAD have shown that Glu170 is located adjacent to His158 in the enzyme active site (5Barycki J.J. O'Brien L.K. Bratt J.M. Zhang R. Sanishvili R. Strauss A.W. Banaszak L.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5786-5798Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar,6Barycki J.J. O'Brien L.K. Strauss A.W. Banaszak L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27186-27196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The backbone carbonyl and amide groups of Glu170 are positioned to form hydrogen bonds with the backbone amide and carbonyl groups of His158, respectively. In addition, a carboxylate oxygen of Glu170 is within hydrogen bond distance of ND1 of His158 as depicted in Scheme FS1. However, Glu170also forms contacts that may be important for dynamic enzyme movements. HAD exhibits a two-domain topology (7Birktoft J.J. Holden H.M. Hamlin R. Xuong N.H. Banaszak L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8262-8266Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), with the N-terminal domain (residues 12–200) adopting a β-α-β fold similar to NAD(P)+-binding enzymes and the C-terminal domain (residues 201–302) consisting primarily of α-helices involved in subunit dimerization. Two distinct conformers of the enzyme structure have been identified (5Barycki J.J. O'Brien L.K. Bratt J.M. Zhang R. Sanishvili R. Strauss A.W. Banaszak L.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5786-5798Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 6Barycki J.J. O'Brien L.K. Strauss A.W. Banaszak L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27186-27196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the open conformation, as described for apo and cofactor-bound enzyme, a large cleft is observed between the NAD+-binding and the C-terminal domains. The addition of substrate results in a conformational change in which the NAD+-binding domain rotates inward toward the dimer interface, sequestering the enzyme active site. This domain shift appears necessary for high affinity substrate binding and critical for effective catalysis. The linker region, composed of residues 201–207, relates the two domains and contains a consensus Pro203-Gly204-Phe205 sequence, which appears to be the pivot point for domain movement. Numerous interactions between Glu170 and residues within this region are observed, including a hydrogen bond with a conserved water molecule. Charge transfer complex formation by HAD provides a spectroscopic assay for structural integrity that can be used to complement binding studies and kinetic analysis. As described previously, the abortive ternary complex composed of HAD, NAD+, and AACoA exhibits a broad absorbance band centered between 410 and 420 nm (6Barycki J.J. O'Brien L.K. Strauss A.W. Banaszak L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27186-27196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AACoA, which is bound as an enolate in the abortive complex, acts as an electron donating species and the nicotinamide ring of NAD+ serves as the electron acceptor. The intensity of the charge transfer band is pH-dependent, with the protonation of a single group resulting in decreased enolate and charge transfer complex formation. The spectroscopic properties of the charge transfer complex are sensitive to perturbations in the protein structure and can be used to probe active site integrity. To evaluate the contribution of Glu170 to catalysis, this residue was substituted with glutamine by site-directed mutagenesis, and the resultant enzyme (E170Q) was analyzed by kinetic, spectroscopic, and x-ray crystallographic techniques. Comparison of the mutant and native enzyme characteristics suggests that Glu170 is required for enzyme stability and positioning of the imidazole ring of His158 for efficient catalysis. In addition, an ionizable group with an apparent pKa of 5.3 has been identified as an important determinant in efficient substrate binding and charge transfer complex formation. These studies expand our understanding of the catalytic mechanism ofl-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase and provide additional insight into the potential nature of analogous Glu-His and Asp-His catalytic dyads. The E170Q mutation was created in the previously reported HAD expression plasmid using the Stratagene QuikChange mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. The enzyme was expressed inEscherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS and purified by affinity chromatography using a nickel-chelating column (Novagen), as described previously (6Barycki J.J. O'Brien L.K. Strauss A.W. Banaszak L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27186-27196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For protein crystallization, the N-terminal histidine tag was removed by thrombin cleavage. Purified protein was dialyzed against 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and stored at 4 °C. Enzyme activity was measured on a Cary-50 spectrophotometer at 25 °C by monitoring the disappearance of NADH (ε340 = 6220m−1 cm−1) upon reduction of acetoacetyl-CoA (AACoA), as described by Noyes & Bradshaw (2Noyes B.E. Bradshaw R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 3052-3059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For standard screening of enzyme activity, the assay was performed in citrate/phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 100 μm NADH and 50 μm AACoA. For pH dependence studies, a citrate/phosphate buffer system of uniform ionic strength, maintained by the addition of KCl, was employed (8Elving P.J. Markowitz J.M. Rosenthal I. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 1179-1180Crossref Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Measurements were made at a saturating concentration of NADH (100 μm) with acetoacetyl-CoA as the varied substrate. At an indicated pH, a substrate saturation curve was determined in triplicate, and values ofVmax and Km were obtained. pH profile data were plotted as the log of the kinetic parameter against pH and fitted using the appropriate rate equation, as described by Cleland (9Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1930) Google Scholar). To assess enzyme stability, protein (1 mg/ml; citrate/phosphate buffer, pH 7.0) was incubated at 37 °C. Aliquots were withdrawn at the indicated time, and activity was measured under standard conditions. l-3-Hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase in complex with NAD+ and AACoA has been shown to form a charge transfer complex, as indicated by a broad band centered between 410 and 420 nm (6Barycki J.J. O'Brien L.K. Strauss A.W. Banaszak L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27186-27196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the pH dependence of the charge transfer complex, absorbance measurements were made at 412 nm with either wild-type or mutant enzyme as a function of pH. Spectroscopic measurements were performed on a Cary-50 spectrophotometer at 25 °C, using the citrate/phosphate/KCl buffer system described above. To 130 μl of buffer of a given pH, 20 μl of a pre-equilibrated stock solution of enzyme, NAD+, and AACoA were added to yield final concentrations of 1.15 mg/ml enzyme, 2 mmNAD+, and 2 mm AACoA. Measurements were made in triplicate and analyzed using the Origin 6.0 software package. Crystals of the abortive ternary complex composed of E170Q, NAD+, and acetoacetyl-CoA were grown by the hanging drop method out of a solution of 50 mmN-[2-acetamido]-2-iminodiacetic acid, pH 6.5, within the precipitant range of 14–19% polyethylene glycol 4000 at a protein concentration of 5 mg/ml as described for wild-type protein (6Barycki J.J. O'Brien L.K. Strauss A.W. Banaszak L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27186-27196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Diffraction data were collected at the University of Minnesota using radiation produced by a Rigaku RU-200BH rotating anode fitted with an Osmic MaxFlux confocal multilayer fixed focus optical system and an R-AXIS IV++ image plate system. Crystals were maintained under cryogenic conditions by an X-stream cooling system, and data were analyzed with the Crystal Clear software package (10Pflugrath J.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1718-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar) (Molecular Structure Corp.). The structure of the E170Q abortive ternary complex was isomorphous with the corresponding wild-type complex (Protein Data Bank accession code 1F0Y). The E170Q model was refined using the crystallography and NMR system CNS, version 0.3 (11Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M.

Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar) and rebuilt after each round of refinement using the program O (12Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar), as described previously (5Barycki J.J. O'Brien L.K. Bratt J.M. Zhang R. Sanishvili R. Strauss A.W. Banaszak L.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5786-5798Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Ambiguous regions of the electron density map were evaluated using 2∣Fo∣ − ∣Fc∣ simulated annealing omit maps, in which designated regions of the structure were omitted and the remaining model was subjected to simulated annealing prior to map calculation. Water molecules obeying proper hydrogen bonding constraints with electron densities greater than 1.0 ς on a 2∣Fo∣ − ∣Fc∣ map and 4.0 ς on an ∣Fo∣ − ∣Fc∣ map were included as model refinement neared completion. Bound substrate and cofactor were also added at this point using coordinates from the analogous wild-type structure. Note that the positions of O3 and C4 of acetoacetyl-CoA could not be assigned unambiguously in the electron density. The current models have O3 positioned within hydrogen bonding distance of Nε2 of His158, the proposed catalytic base. Similarly, the orientations of His158, Gln170, and Asn208 side chains cannot be determined unequivocally and are modeled such that potential hydrogen bond interactions are maximized. Coordinates and structure factors for the E170Q model have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under the accession code1IL0. The E170Q mutant enzyme was overexpressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity. E170Q protein yields were ∼4-fold lower than wild-type enzyme, with 15–20 mg produced per liter of cell culture. In addition, E170Q appeared to be less stable than native enzyme. Visible precipitate was observed in the concentrated E170Q stock solution (∼10 mg/ml) after 5–7 days when stored at 4 °C; native enzyme was stable indefinitely under similar conditions. In addition, the specific activity of the E170Q protein decreased ∼10% over this time period, while that of native enzyme remained unchanged. However, initial specific activity values for the E170Q enzyme could be restored by removal of the precipitated protein. As observed with wild-type protein, uncleaved and thrombin-cleaved E170Q exhibited similar levels of enzyme activity, cofactor affinity, and substrate binding (data not shown), indicating that the N-terminal histidine tag did not significantly alter enzyme structure or function. A comparison of native and E170Q kinetic parameters is provided in Table I. The concentration of acetoacetyl-CoA was varied at a saturating NADH concentration (100 μm), with initial rates determined in triplicate. Data were then fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation to obtainVmax and Km. The sensitivity of the kinetic assay employed precluded determination of aKm for NADH by the reciprocal experiments. However, as judged by fluorescence quenching experiments (5Barycki J.J. O'Brien L.K. Bratt J.M. Zhang R. Sanishvili R. Strauss A.W. Banaszak L.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5786-5798Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), E170Q bound reduced cofactor with equal or slightly greater affinity than native enzyme; Kd values were typically less than 1 μm (data not shown). The E170Q mutation did not alter substrate binding as evidenced by comparable Kmvalues for native and mutant enzymes. In contrast, the side chain substitution dramatically impaired catalysis, withVmax reduced ∼60-fold at pH 7.0.Table IApparent kinetic values for the reduction of acetoacetyl-CoA by native and mutant l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenasesVmaxKm AACoAμmol/min/mgμmNative500 ± 34.614.8 ± 1.62E170Q7.83 ± 0.4416.9 ± 1.63Measurements were made at pH 7.0 using a saturating concentration of NADH (100 μM).

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15002-15011Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), a potential role of Glu170 is to elevate the apparent pKa of His158, rendering the enzyme-catalyzed reaction more reversible at neutral pH. The E170Q mutation would therefore be predicted to alter the pH dependence of a given kinetic parameter. Vmaxand Km values were determined as described above for native and mutant enzymes over the pH range of 5.0–8.0 in 0.2 increments. Steady-state kinetic parameters are presented as log valuesversus pH (Fig. 1), with the data fit according to the methodology of Cleland (9Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1930) Google Scholar) to obtain apparent pK values (Table II). Catalytic efficiency (Vmax/Km) was pH-independent for native enzyme in the neutral pH range (Fig. 1A), with decreased enzyme efficiency in the acidic region of the curve indicative of a single ionizable group with an apparent pKa of 5.14 ± 0.53 (Table II). In contrast, the pH dependence of E170Q enzyme activity fit to a bell-shaped curve described by two ionization events. The first (pKa1 = 5.18 ± 0.57) was comparable with wild-type enzyme, and the second (pKa2 = 6.80 ± 0.45) accounted for the basic limb of the curve.Table IISummary of apparent pK valuesVmax/KmVmax, pKa1/Km, pKapKa1pKa2Native5.14 ± 0.53—aNative enzyme does not display a basic limb (Fig. 1A).—bThe slight decrease in catalytic activity observed at pH values greater than 7 (Fig. 1B) is attributable to strong product inhibition and therefore underestimation of Vmax.5.24 ± 0.38E170Q5.18 ± 0.576.80 ± 0.456.69 ± 0.125.43 ± 0.29Values were obtained by fitting the data presented in Fig. 1 with the appropriate equation as described under “Experimental Procedures.”a Native enzyme does not display a basic limb (Fig. 1A).b The slight decrease in catalytic activity observed at pH values greater than 7 (Fig. 1B) is attributable to strong product inhibition and therefore underestimation of Vmax. Open table in a new tab Values were obtained by fitting the data presented in Fig. 1 with the appropriate equation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” To assign the observed pKa values to a binding event or to catalysis, individual kinetic parameters were examined. A plot of log Vmax versus pH (Fig.1B) revealed that catalysis by E170Q was dependent on a single ionizable group with an apparent pKa = 6.69 ± 0.12, comparable with the value of 6.8 obtained from theVmax/Km analysis (Table II). In contrast, native enzyme turnover appeared to be essentially pH-independent. A slight decrease in Vmax was seen in the basic pH range (pH >7.0), but this observation was attributable to underestimation of Vmax; considerable product inhibition was detected in this pH range, reducing the calculated initial rates. Native and E170Q enzymes exhibited nearly identical Km values for AACoA over the pH range tested. Plots of log (1/Km) versus pH (Fig. 1, C and D) indicated apparent pKa values of 5.24 ± 0.38 and 5.43 ± 0.29, which were associated with substrate binding to wild-type and mutant proteins, respectively (Table II). These values are in good agreement with those obtained from theVmax/Km analysis. A charge transfer complex composed of HAD, NAD+, and AACoA has been described (6Barycki J.J. O'Brien L.K. Strauss A.W. Banaszak L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27186-27196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and its spectroscopic properties were used to probe the integrity of the E170Q active site. Difference spectroscopy experiments were performed in which the sum of the individual spectra of the components was subtracted from the spectrum of the charge transfer complex. Both native and mutant enzymes displayed similar difference spectra with a sharp peak at 302 nm, corresponding to the enolate species of AACoA, and a broad peak centered between 410 and 420 nm, indicative of charge transfer (data not shown). The topologies of the two spectra were nearly identical, suggesting that key components involved in charge transfer complex formation were not dramatically perturbed by the E170Q mutation. However, the E170Q difference spectrum was uniformly reduced in magnitude ∼3-fold relative to that of the native enzyme, indicating generally diminished enolate formation. This could result from lower affinity of the protein for AACoA or from altered positioning of key residues. The former was discounted by the observation that a 5-fold increase of AACoA concentration did not produce an increase in the intensity of the charge transfer band. To further investigate the possible structural effects resulting from the E170Q mutation, the pH dependence of enolate formation by native and mutant HAD was assessed indirectly by measuring charge transfer complex formation as a function of pH (Fig.2). As observed in the difference spectroscopy measurements, native and E170Q charge transfer bands exhibited an ∼3-fold difference in magnitude at a given pH. However, a similar pH transition for charge transfer complex formation was observed for both native and mutant enzymes. Charge transfer band intensities were plotted as a function of pH and fit to a sigmoidal curve, yielding a single transition at pH 5.25 ± 0.02 and 5.33 ± 0.08 for native and E170Q enzymes, respectively. Values for this transition are, furthermore, in agreement with pKa values for AACoA binding obtained by kinetic measurements. Decreased stability of the E170Q mutant protein was suggested by the formation of precipitate upon storage of the enzyme, as described above. This observation, along with previous structural characterizations, suggested that Glu170 may function to maintain active site structure, prompting a detailed investigation of relative protein stability. An examination of tryptophan fluorescence as a function of guanidine hydrochloride concentration indicated a sharp transition at low denaturant concentration (∼0.75 m) for native enzyme (data not shown). Significant stability differences between native and E170Q HAD could not be detected by this method, possibly because of the location of the single tryptophan residue of the enzyme; Trp265 is positioned at the interface of the NAD+-binding and C-terminal domains near the hinge region of the protein. This region has been demonstrated to undergo significant conformational changes in response to substrate binding and may be more susceptible to disruption by chemical denaturants. Hence, tryptophan quenching may not be a reliable probe for overall structural integrity. Therefore, an alternative measure of protein stability was developed. Native and E170Q proteins (1 mg/ml, pH 7.0) were incubated at 37 °C, and enzyme activity was monitored over time. As shown in Fig. 3, native enzyme activity (squares) was completely retained over the time course, whereas the E170Q activity (circles) declined with a half-life of ∼2 h. Furthermore, loss of enzyme activity was accompanied by precipitation of the E170Q protein, indicating reduced structural stability of the mutant relative to native HAD. Structural studies of the E170Q mutant were undertaken to aid in the interpretation of the biochemical observations and provide a molecular model of catalysis by the mutant enzyme. X-ray diffraction data and model refinement statistics are summarized in TableIII. E170Q enzyme crystals belonged to space group P212121 and were isomorphous with those of the previously determined HAD abortive ternary complex. A nearly complete data set was collected with diffraction data extending beyond 2.2 Å. To minimize model bias, a simulated annealing omit map was calculated for the region about the E170Q mutation and used during model building. The final E170Q model has well defined geometry with nearly 90% of all residues found in the “most favorable” region of the Ramachandran plot (16Laskowski R.A. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 1049-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). It is important to note that the resolution of the current model (2.2 Å) precluded discrimination between carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen atoms, and therefore rotamer assignments of side chains were based on optimizing potential hydrogen bond interactions.Table IIIData collection and model refinement statisticsParameterValueSpace groupP212121Cell dimensions a (Å)49.66 b(Å)87.72 c (Å)158.40Resolution (Å)30–2.2Percentage complete (highest shell)99.8 (99.3)No. of reflections35973Redundancy7.89I/ςI17.1Rmerge (highest shell)9.0% (26.4%)Ramachandran geometryaThe Ramachandran geometry was monitored using Procheck (16).

Open table in a new tab The E170Q enzyme structure was compared with the analogous wild-type HAD model to assess the effects of the mutation on protein structure. Overall, the E170Q and native models are quite similar with a root mean square deviation for α-carbons of 0.46 Å and overall B-factors of 29.9 Å2 and 21.5 Å2, respectively. However, subtle differences between the two models are observed throughout the active site region. This region of the final E170Q model (dark gray) and its corresponding 2‖Fo‖−‖Fc‖ omit map density is superimposed upon the analogous wild-type structure (light gray) in Fig.4. As illustrated, the electron density map supports an E170Q model in which the imidazole ring of His158 has rotated ∼90° relative to its placement in the native HAD structure. In addition, the loop containing the E170Q mutation has retreated slightly from the enzyme active site. The position of the His158 side chain was the most dramatic difference observed between the native and E170Q structures. Shown in Fig. 5 are the native (Fig.5A) and E170Q (Fig. 5B) enzyme active sites, with relevant interatomic distances of ≤3.5 Å illustrated asdashed lines; actual distances are summarized in Table IV. Instead of hydrogen bonding with the side chain of Gln170 in a fashion similar to wild-type protein, the imidazole ring of His158 is rotated ∼90° in the E170Q model. New hydrogen bonds are suggested between ND1 of His158 and the backbone carbonyl of Phe159 as well as between NE2 of His158 and the side chain amide of Asn208. As a result, NE2 of His158 is removed more than 0.7 Å from the 3-keto oxygen of AACoA (O3) and no longer positioned for optimal hydrogen bond formation. This is reflected by an increase in the average B-factor of O3, from 13.4 Å2 in native enzyme to 50.0 Å2in the E170Q model, and is consistent with reduced catalytic efficiency of the mutant enzyme. Other than at the C3 carbonyl of AACoA, substrate binding appears to be unaffected by the E170Q mutation, with comparable protein/ligand interactions observed in native and mutant enzymes.Table IVComparison of equivalent interatomic distancesNativeE170QAtom 1Atom 2Distance (Å)Distance (Å)Atom 1Atom 2Wat 809G204∶O2.662.55Wat 984G204∶OWat 809N208∶N2.833.44Wat 984N208∶NWat 809N208∶ND23.353.07Wat 984N208∶ND2Wat 809E170∶OE12.642.77Wat 984Q170∶NE2E170∶0E2I206∶N3.063.50Q170∶0E1I206∶NE170∶0E2V207∶N3.163.91Q170∶0E1V207∶NE170∶OE1H158∶ND12.693.72Q170∶NE2H158∶ND1H158∶ND1F159∶O4.652.87H158∶ND1F159∶OH158∶NE2N208∶ND23.543.00H158∶NE2N208∶ND2H158∶NE2AACoA∶O32.623.37H158∶NE2AACoA∶O3N161∶NAACoA∶O12.983.21N161∶NAACoA∶O1Each line represents comparable interatomic distances in the native and E170Q models.

The antibody binds the steroid in a deep hydrophobic pocket formed at the interface between the variable domains. No major structural rearrangements take place upon ligand binding; however, a large part of the heavy chain variable domain near the binding pocket is unusually flexible and is partly stabilized when the steroid is bound.

Especially, the 17-hydroxyl group of E2 is recognized by an intricate hydrogen bonding network in which the 17-hydroxyl itself forms a rare four-center hydrogen bond with three polar amino acids; this hydrogen bonding arrangement accounts for the low cross-reactivity of the antibody with other estrogens such as estrone.

E2 is the cell proliferation-promoting steroid hormone during the menstrual cycle, and it has known functions in bone metabolism and in the cardiovascular and central nervous systems. E2 is the most potent member of the family of estrogens, including estrone and estriol, and it binds tighter to the known human estrogen receptors (ER), ERα and ERβ, than other estrogens (1Kuiper G.G. Carlsson B. Grandien K. Enmark E. Haggblad J. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J.A. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 863-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (3678) Google Scholar). In fertile women sera, the E2 concentrations range normally from 110 to 2200 pmol/liter, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle (2Thomas L. 1st Ed. Clinical Laboratory Diagnostics: Use and Assessment of Clinical Laboratory Results. TH-Books Verlagsgesellschaft mbH, Frankfurt/Main, Germany1998Google Scholar), whereas in prepubertal and postmenopausal female sera, the concentrations are substantially lower. 17β-estradiol is used as a drug in various hormone-dependent disorders; for example, supplementary E2 administered to postmenopausal women relieves postmenopausal symptoms, reverses urogenital atrophy, and increases bone mass. On the other hand, increased serum E2 levels have been linked with malignant/premalignant diseases such as breast cancer (3Hankinson S.E. Willett W.C. Manson J.E. Colditz G.A. Hunter D.J. Spiegelman D. Barbieri R.L. Speizer F.E. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1998; 90: 1292-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar) and endometriosis (4Bulun S.E. Zeitoun K.M. Takayama K. Sasano H. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 25: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Immunoassays are routinely used to measure serum E2 levels. However, the generation of monoclonal antibodies with high enough affinity and specificity for steroid hormones has proven to be very difficult with the conventional hybridoma techniques. The conserved hydrophobic steroid skeleton of E2 with only two polar heavy atoms (3- and 17-hydroxyl groups) seems to be a particularly challenging target for the murine immune system, and the current E2 assays are based on polyclonal immunoglobulins from rabbit sera. However, the polyclonal antibodies have disadvantages compared with monoclonals. The most severe problem is a large batch-to-batch variation, and therefore the E2 assays require a laborious optimization procedure with each new batch of polyclonals. Hence, a monoclonal, recombinant, high affinity/specificity anti-E2-antibody would be very desirable and could be of great potential value in clinical assays. The monoclonal antibody 57-2 has been raised in mice against the E2 conjugated to bovine serum albumin, and the genes encoding its antigen binding regions have previously been cloned in our laboratory (5Pajunen M. Saviranta P. Jauria P. Karp M. Pettersson K. Mantsala P. Lovgren T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1351: 192-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The antibody has a moderately high affinity for E2 (Ka∼ 5 × 108) and a good selectivity between different estrogens. Unfortunately, the E2 affinity is not high enough to be useful in clinical assays, and the antibody also cross-reacts with testosterone with a substantially high affinity (Ka(testosterone)/Ka(E2) = 37%). Molecular modeling was previously used to predict how E2 binds to the 57-2 antibody (6Lamminmäki U. Villoutreix B.O. Jauria P. Saviranta P. Vihinen M. Nilsson L. Teleman O. Lovgren T. Mol. Immunol. 1997; 34: 1215-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), but in order to obtain structural information on the nature of the E2-Fab interactions with improved accuracy, we have recently crystallized the 57-2 Fab in the absence and presence of 17β-estradiol (7Lamminmäki U. Kankare J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1670-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Currently, there are few steroid antibody complex crystal structures available in the Protein Data Bank (Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics, Rutgers University) (8Berman H.M.

In this study, we report the crystal structures of the Fab fragment of the antibody 57-2 in the absence and presence of the antigen 17β-estradiol at 2.5 and 2.15 Å, respectively. The high resolution crystal structures provide detailed information of the complex nature of the E2-antibody interactions and explain the previously characterized binding properties of the antibody, especially its excellent selectivity between different estrogens and high cross-reactivity with testosterone. There are some unusual features in the antibody; a large region of the combining site appears to be flexible, the residues in the complementarity-determining region (CDR) 2 of the light chain participate in hapten recognition, and the ligand recognition involves a rare four-center hydrogen bond. The crystal structures presented in this work might be useful for future structure-based engineering of novel Fab variants with improved affinity and specificity. The detailed description of the protein expression, purification, and crystallization protocol of the molecule is described elsewhere (7Lamminmäki U. Kankare J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1670-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Briefly, the Fab fragment was (i) overexpressed into periplasma Escherichia coli and (ii) purified first with cation exchange chromatography and then with hydrophobic interaction chromatography followed by another cation exchange chromatography. (iii) The purified protein was desalted and concentrated to ∼30 mg/ml, and (iv) crystals were obtained at 276 K using sitting drop vapor diffusion methods with reservoir solutions containing 5% polyethylene glycol 8000 in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.7). The initial crystals were unsuitable for x-ray studies, but diffracting crystals could be grown reproducibly with microseeding in sitting drops using a protein concentration of 15–25 mg/ml and 10–14% polyethylene glycol 4000 or 8–12% polyethylene glycol 8000 and Tris-HCl buffer in high pH (9.0–9.5) as the precipitant. Crystals of the Fab-steroid complex were produced by co-crystallization in the presence of 17β-estradiol and cross-seeding with the apo-form crystals. The crystals were flash-cooled using 25% glycerol as the cryoprotectant in a 100 K nitrogen gas stream, and x-ray data were collected with a Rigaku Raxis II diffractometer operated at 50 kV and 180 mA using copper Kα (λ = 1.5418 Å) radiation; data were integrated and scaled with the software DENZO and SCALEPACK (13Otwinowski Z. DENZO and SCALEPACK: Data Processing and Scaling Programs. Yale University, New Haven, CT1993Google Scholar). The calculated Matthews coefficient (14Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7922) Google Scholar) was consistent with one Fab fragment in the asymmetric unit. The Fab structures were solved by molecular replacement methods (15Rossman M.G. Blow D.M. Acta Crystallogr. 1962; 15: 24-31Crossref Google Scholar,16Brünger A.T. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1990; 46: 46-57Crossref Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The novel software CNS (17Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar) was used in all molecular replacement and refinement work, and the software O (18Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar) was used for displaying electron density maps and for model building. Before any structure solution was attempted, 7–10% of the reflections were randomly set aside and used only for calculations of the cross-validated error function Rfree (19Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3864) Google Scholar) but never in refinement or map calculations. A hybrid Fab fragment model that was used as a template in the molecular replacement studies was constructed from the Protein Data Bank files1TET (variable domain of heavy chain; Ref. 20Shoham M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 1169-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and 1FDL (variable domain of light chain and both constant domains; Ref. 21Fischmann T.O. Bentley G.A. Bhat T.N. Boulot G. Mariuzza R.A. Phillips S.E. Tello D. Poljak R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12915-12920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rotation and translation function produced a very clear solution in the correct space group. After a rigid body refinement followed by a torsion angle dynamics simulated annealing (22Adams P.D. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Brünger A.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5018-5023Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) run, the Rfree dropped to 37%, and initial maps (resolution 50–2.7 Å) were calculated. When electron density maps were inspected using a graphics work station, a clear E2 electron density (>5 ς over the mean density in (Fobs −Fcalc)exp(iαcalc) maps) was seen in the maps generated with x-ray data collected from crystals obtained with microseeding in the presence of E2. Further refinement work proceeded smoothly as an iterative process between interactive graphics work with O and refinement with CNS. All x-ray data to 2.15 Å in the E2 complex structure and all data to 2.5-Å resolution in the apo structure were used in all subsequent refinements without a ς cut-off. An anisotropic B-factor correction was used, and a bulk solvent correction was applied to model the low resolution reflections. The refinement method varied between the deepest descent approach and simulated annealing torsion angle dynamics (23Rice L.M. Brünger A.T. Proteins. 1994; 19: 277-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) methods using the novel maximum likelihood function (22Adams P.D. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Brünger A.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5018-5023Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) as the refinement target. The simulated annealing-torsion angle refinement was always utilized when a drop in Rfreejustified its use. The calculated 2Fo −Fc and Fo −Fc maps used in model building were always ςA (24Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1986; 42: 140-149Crossref Scopus (2036) Google Scholar) weighted. When the R-factor had dropped below 30% and missing side chains had been included in the model, we began adding water molecules to the structure. The criteria for water addition was as follows. The waters were only added to the model in places were Fo −Fc electron density maps had a peak value 3 ς over the mean with reasonable hydrogen bonding geometry to the protein. Also, after adding the water molecule to the model, the 2Fo − Fc maps were required to show a peak hight of 1.5 ς in the putative water molecule position and a real space correlation coefficient greater than 0.50. B-factors were released at the same time when water building was started; the use of individual B-factor refinement versus grouped B-factor refinement was again validated with Rfree. A number of simulated annealing omit maps (25Hodel A. Rice L.M. Brünger A.T. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1992; 48: 851-859Crossref Scopus (393) Google Scholar) were calculated in regions of ill defined electron density, and the models were modified accordingly. The steroid was built into the maps as a rigid molecule, and the coordinates and potential parameters were obtained from the Hetero-Compound Information Center (Uppsala, Sweden) (Web site: alpha2.bmc.uu.se/hicup) (26Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 1119-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Finally, the molecule was checked against pathologies with the Whatcheck program in the software package WHAT IF (27Vriend G. J. Mol. Graph. 1990; 8: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar), which led to only minor changes in the structure. The program InsightII (Molecular Simulations, San Diego, CA) was used for molecular modeling, and the coordinates of other steroids were obtained from the Cambridge Structural Data Base (28Allen F.H. Kennard O. Chem. Design Automation News. 1993; 8: 31-37Google Scholar). The figures in this work were prepared with Molscript (29Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar) and Raster3D (30Merritt E.A. Bacon D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 505-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (3875) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional crystal structures of 57-2 Fab fragment in the absence (apo) and presence (holo) of 17β-estradiol (Fig. 1) were determined to 2.5- and 2.15-Å resolution, respectively. The crystals belong to space group P212121 with one monomer in the asymmetric unit; the crystal and refinement data are presented in Table I. The amino acid sequence of the 57-2 Fab and residue numbering following the Kabat numbering scheme (31Kabat A.S. Wu T.T. Perry H.M. Gottesman K.S. Foeller C. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD1991: 91-3242Google Scholar) is shown in Fig. 2. The electron density maps were well defined in most parts of the structures, and immunoglobulin fold models with good stereochemistry (Table I) could be built without difficulties. There are three chain breaks in the loop regions in the heavy chains of both models due to poor local electron density. In the holo structure, the regions not built include residues H29 and H30 in the CDR1 of heavy chain, H73–H75 in the loop next to the heavy chain CDRs (Fig.3), and residues H128–H132 in a loop in the heavy chain constant region (CH). In addition, two C-terminal residues in the heavy chain could not be built. The same regions of the maps were also ill defined in the apo structure (the gap in CH is a bit shorter, H128–H131); furthermore, two heavy chain N-terminal residues were not built. All but the C-terminal amino acid L214 were built in the light chains of both structures. The apo and holo Fabs have identical packing environments. None of the CDR loops is involved in direct crystal contacts; therefore, the architecture of the combining site region is probably not affected by packing effects. The Fabs in the two structures are in very similar, rather extended conformations with the elbow angles between the variable and constant domains about 161°, a value that is in the range commonly observed for Fab structures (32Wilson I.A. Stanfield R.L. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Lesk A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 901-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (1184) Google Scholar). The CDRL1 belongs to canonical class 2, and the CDRL2 and CDRL3 loops are both of class 1. The heavy chain CDR2 was judged to belong to the canonical class 2. Because of the chain break in CDRH1, it was not possible to define the canonical type of this loop. Due to the high diversity of the apex of CDRH3, a comprehensive canonical classification scheme has only been introduced for the stem of the loop (34Oliva B. Bates P.A. Querol E. Aviles F.X. Sternberg M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 1193-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 35Morea V. Tramontano A. Rustici M. Chothia C. Lesk A.M. J. Mol.

In 57-2, the stem of CDRH3 adopts a nonkinked conformation probably because the loop lacks both Arg-H94 and Asp-H101, which typically form a conserved salt bridge in the kinked-type loop. Once the estradiol-Fab co-crystallization procedure was established (7Lamminmäki U. Kankare J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1670-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), the bound steroid could be unambiguously detected in the electron density maps (Fig.4). As shown in Figs.Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, E2 is bound in a deep pocket formed between the heavy and light chain variable domains (VH and VL). The depth of the cleft is ∼8 Å, and the width and length are 5 and 11 Å, respectively. The hapten is oriented parallel to the interface between VH and VL. The D-ring of the steroid penetrates deep into the cleft so that the 17-OH of E2 lies next to the bottom of the binding pocket, whereas the A-ring is located near the mouth of the pocket. The D-ring lies between the stem of CDRH2 and CDRL3, and the A-ring interacts with CDRH3. Only about 16% (75 Å2) of the total solvent-accessible steroid surface (482 Å2) is exposed to solvent (using 1.4-Å probe radius). The antibody was raised against E2–6-carboxymethyl oxime-bovine serum albumin. In the holo structure, C6 and the parts of the steroid immediately surrounding it are solvent-accessible. Also, the 3-OH group of E2 is partially exposed to solvent. A detailed description of the interactions between the antibody and E2 is presented in Table II and in Fig. 5. The steroid is sandwiched between the side chains of three aromatic residues in the walls of the binding pocket; the α-side (Fig. 1) of the steroid is in contact with Tyr-L49 and Phe-L91, and the β-side is in contact with Trp-H95. The indole side chain of the CDRH3 residue Trp-H95 protrudes between the steroid and CDRH1 loop and is alone responsible for the majority of the contacts that the antibody makes with the β-side of E2. Glycines H96 and H97 and Ala-H101 in CDRH3 interact with the A-ring of E2. CDRH3 has a prominent role in the binding of the ligand; this loop accounts for 45% of the antibody's solvent-accessible surface that is buried upon the ligand binding. The D-ring end of the steroid is in contact with Trp-L96 from CDRL3, and the bottom of the binding cleft is formed by Gln-H35, Tyr-L36, and His-L89. Only one non-CDRH3 heavy chain residue, Gln-H35 in the stem of CDRH1, contacts the steroid directly.Table IIContacts between 17β-estradiol and antibody 57–2Steroid atomFab residueFab atomC1Tyr-L49Cδ1, Cɛ2, Cγ, Cη, Cδ2Ser-H99OC2Gly-H97OTyr-L49Cɛ2, CηSer-H99NC3Gly-H97OO3Gly-H97O (H-bond), CGly-H96CC4Trp-H95Cδ1C5Trp-H95Cδ1, CγC6Trp-H95Nɛ1, Cδ1C7Phe-L91Cɛ2, Cδ2, CηTrp-H95Cδ1C8Trp-H95Cδ1, Cδ2, CγC10Tyr-L49Cδ2Trp-H95Cβ, Cδ1C11Leu-L46Cδ2Tyr-L49CβAla-H101CβC12Tyr-L36OHAla-L34CβLeu-L46Cδ1C13Tyr-L36OHC14Phe-L91Cδ1, Cɛ1, Cγ, CηC15Phe-L91Cβ, Cδ1, Cδ2, CγTrp-L96Cɛ3, Cη3C16Phe-L91Cβ, Cδ1, CγHis-L89Cɛ1, Nδ1Trp-L96Cɛ3C17His-L89Cɛ1, Nδ1Tyr-L36OHGln-H35Nɛ2O17Gln-H35Nɛ2 (H-bond)Tyr-L36OH (H-bond), Cɛ2, CηHis-L89Nδ1 (H-bond), Cɛ1C18Trp-H95Cδ2, Cɛ3Gln-H35Nɛ2Tyr-L36OHThere are a total of 66 atomic contacts between the steroid and the antibody with a cut-off of 3.4 Å for hydrogen bonds and a distance of 0.5 Å between the van der Waals surfaces of the atoms for van der Waals interactions.

The two hydroxyl groups of E2 are hydrogen-bonded to the antibody (Fig.5). The 17-OH of E2 is recognized by an intricate hydrogen bond network (Fig. 6, a and b). In the heart of this network, there is a four-center hydrogen bond between the 17-OH and the side chains of the residues: Gln-H35, Tyr-L36, and His-L89. Each of these three polar side chains forms additional hydrogen bonds to surrounding residues. The 3-OH group of E2, in turn, forms a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of Gly-H97 in CDRH3. There are no major structural differences between the apo and the holo structures. We could superimpose 419 Cα atoms of the two structures with a root mean square deviation of 0.41 Å, and the difference in the relative domain association angle between VH and VL in the two structures is only 0.45°. The B-factors of the residues (Trp-H95 to Trp-H101) in the CDRH3 loop refined to much higher average values in the apo structure (58.6 Å2) than in the holo structure (27.0 Å2), and there is a slight movement of this loop (root mean square deviation of 0.3 Å when six Cα atoms were superimposed) upon ligand binding (Fig. 5). The orientations of the residues Tyr-L49 and Asp-L56 are different between the two structures (Fig. 5). These residues are located on both sides of the CDRH3 loop, and their side chains are hydrogen-bonded to CDRH3 residue Asn-H98 in the complex structure. This arrangement could not be detected in the apo structure. In the apo structure, there are two water molecules in the binding site; one is located at the bottom of the binding site close to the position occupied by the 17-OH of E2 in the holo structure, and the other is situated higher in the binding pocket and is hydrogen-bonded to the first one. The interactions between the antibody with two nonnatural E2 analogs, 17α-estradiol and 17-deoxyestradiol, as well as with natural estrogens estrone (E1) and estriol (E3) were studied with a graphics work station by superimposing these steroids on E2 in the holo structure using the carbon atoms of the steroid skeleton (Fig. 7). The two nonnatural analogs are otherwise identical with E2, but in 17α-estradiol the 17-OH group is oriented to the opposite side of the steroid skeleton than in 17β-estradiol, and 17-deoxyestradiol lacks the 17-OH group (Fig. 1). The superimposition of 17α-estradiol on E2 shows that the 17-OH of 17α-estradiol is too far to hydrogen-bond to Gln-H35 and Tyr-L36 (distances of 5.3 and 4 Å, respectively), and the hydrogen bonding geometry is unfavorable for a hydrogen bond to His-L89 (distance of 3.5 Å); however, there is no steric clash with the antibody. Obviously, the 17-deoxyestradiol lacks the four-center hydrogen bond entirely. E1 differs from E2 only in position 17 of the steroid skeleton, where it has a keto group instead of a hydroxyl group (Fig. 1). The keto group of E1 is in the plane of the steroid skeleton unlike the 17-OH of E2, and the modeling shows that it is too far to form a hydrogen bond with Gln-H35 (4.0 Å) but is still within the hydrogen bonding distance from His-L89 (2.9 Å) and Tyr-L36 (2.8 Å). However, as judged by the hydrogen bond arrangement in the holo structure, the δ1 nitrogen of the His-L89 is not protonated (Fig. 6, a and b) and is unable to hydrogen-bond with the keto group. Therefore, presuming that the protonation state of His-L89 is not shifting, the keto group of estrone could form only a single hydrogen bond with Tyr-L36. E3 has an additional hydroxyl group at the position C16 and a slightly different D-ring conformation compared with E2. When the structure of E3 is superimposed on the E2 skeleton in the holo structure, the 16-OH of E3 penetrates in a cavity between the side chains of His-L89 and Phe-L91 and Trp-L96, which can result in steric clashes and repulsive interactions between the polar 16-OH and the hydrophobic si"

We previously reported that a potent protein kinase C activator, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, increases human cystatin A expression by the activation of AP-1 proteins. Here, we delineate the signaling cascade responsible for this regulation. Co-transfection of the cystatin A promoter into normal human keratinocytes together with a dominant active form ofras increased the promoter activity by 3-fold. In contrast, a dominant negative form of ras suppressed basal cystatin A promoter activity. Further analyses disclosed that transfection of dominant negative forms of raf-1,MEK1, ERK1, ERK2, or wild-typeMEKK1 all increased cystatin A promoter activity in normal human keratinocytes, whereas wild-type raf-1,ERK1, ERK2, or dominant negative forms ofMEKK1, MKK7, or JNK1 suppressed the promoter activity. The increased or decreased promoter activity reflected the expression of cystatin A on mRNA and protein levels. These effects were not observed when a cystatin A promoter with a T2 (−272 to −278) deletion was used. In contrast, transfection of dominant negative forms of MKK3, MKK4, orp38 did not affect cystatin A promoter activity. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that phosphorylated active extracellular signal-regulated kinases and c-Jun N-terminal kinase were expressed in the nuclei of basal cells and cells in the suprabasal-granular cell layer, respectively. These results indicate that the expression of cystatin A is regulated via mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways positively by Ras/MEKK1/MKK7/JNK and negatively by Ras/Raf/MEK1/ERK.

In the epidermis cystatin A is expressed in the upper spinous to granular cell layers (12Lobitz C.J. Buxman M.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1982; 78: 150-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In addition to its proteinase inhibitory effect, cystatin A is known to be an early precursor protein of CE in keratinocytes (8Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17702-17711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). The human cystatin A gene is located on 3q21 (13Hsieh W.-T. Fong D. Sloane B.F. Golembieski W. Smith D.I. Genomics. 1991; 9: 207-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and consists of three exons that are separated by 14- and 3.6-kilobase introns, respectively (14Takahashi H. Asano K.

A potent protein kinase C activator, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), induces terminal differentiation of keratinocytes (15Hawley-Nelson P. Roop D.R. Cheng C.K. Krieg T.M. Yuspa S.H. Mol.

Recent studies revealed that TPA increases cystatin A expression at both the mRNA and protein levels (6Takahashi H. Kinouchi M. Wuepper K.D. Iizuka H. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1997; 108: 843-847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The 5′-flanking region of the cystatin A gene contains at least two putative TPA-responsive regions, T1 (−189 to −196) and T2 (−272 to −278). The AP-1 proteins, c-Jun, c-Fos, and Jun D, regulate cystatin A promoter activity via PKC activation (8Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17702-17711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). However, the precise regulatory mechanism of AP-1-dependent cystatin A expression in keratinocytes remains to be determined. Cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis are mediated by the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. A MAPK is activated by a specific MAPK kinase (MAPKK) through the phosphorylation of specific threonine and tyrosine residues (Thr-X-Tyr) in MAPK. MAPKK is activated by MAPKK kinase through the phosphorylation of specific threonine and tyrosine residues (Thr-Y-Tyr) in MAPKK (17Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin.

Recent analyses indicate that TPA-induced gene expression of keratinocytes is associated with MAP kinase activation. For example, the expression of the human involucrin gene is regulated by MAPK cascades (25Efimova T. LaCelle P. Welter J.F. Eckert R.L. J. Biol.

In the present study, we have analyzed the regulatory pathway(s) of various MAPK-signaling systems that control cystatin A expression of normal human keratinocytes. Normal human keratinocytes (NHK cells) were obtained during plastic surgery. Informed consent was obtained from the patients. The cells were cultured in keratinocyte growth medium containing epidermal growth factor (10 ng/ml), insulin (5 μg/ml), and bovine pituitary extract (50 μg/ml) at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in air. NHK cells were maintained in a subconfluent state by subculturing every 4–5 days. Cells were seeded into 60-mm diameter plastic dishes at concentrations of 4 × 105cells/5 ml.

Typically, 5 μg of reporter plasmid and 2 μg of β-galactosidase plasmid were co-transfected with 2 μg of various expression vectors or empty vector into 1 × 105 NHK cells. The β-galactosidase plasmid was used as the internal standard to normalize the efficiency of each transfection. After 48 h, the cells were collected, and CAT assays were performed (35Neuman J.R. Morency C.A. Russian K.D. BioTechniques. 1987; 5: 441Google Scholar). The enzyme activity of β-galactosidase in the transfected cell extracts was measured spectrophotometrically (36Maniatis T. Fritsch E.H. Sambrook T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Relative CAT activities were expressed as the fold increase in the acetylated fraction after correction for the activity of the 0-CAT vector. The cDNA of dominant negative mutants of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (dn-REK1, human REK1 K52R) and dn-ERK2 (rat ERK2 K71R) were provided by Dr. Melanie Cobb (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX) (26Robbins D.J. Zhen E Owaki H. Vanderbilt C.A. Ebert D. Geppert T.D. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 68: 5097-5106Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Recombinant adenoviruses (constitutively active ras (G12V) (Ad-da-ras) and Ad-dn-ERK1) were prepared using the procedures described previously (37Namikawa K. Honma M. Abe K. Takeda M. Mansur K. Obata T. Miwa A. Okado H. Kiyama H. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2875-2886Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cDNA fragments encoding these proteins were cloned into an expression cosmid cassette designated pAxCAwt (38Miyake S. Makimura M. Kanegae Y. Harada S. Sato Y. Takamori K. Tokuda C. Saito I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1320-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). This was created from the human type 5 adenovirus genome from which the E1A, E1B, and E3 regions had been deleted and replaced with the appropriate expression unit under the control of the CAG promoter (39Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4617) Google Scholar). Each expression cosmid cassette and EcoT221-digested adenovirus DNA terminal protein complex (Ad5-dIX DNA-TPC) was co-transfected into human embryonic kidney (HEK)293 cells, and the recombinant adenoviruses were generated by homologous recombination and amplified in HEK293 cells. Moreover, high titers of recombinant viral stocks were generated in HEK293 cells, purified by cesium gradient centrifugation (40Kanegae Y. Makimura M. Saito I. Jpn. J. Med. Sci. Biol. 1994; 47: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar), and stored at −80 °C until use. The viral titers were determined by plaque-forming assays in HEK293 cells. AxCAdaMEK, representing constitutively active human MEK1 (termed dominant active MEK1 or da-MEK1), without the nuclear export signal was constructed as described elsewhere (37Namikawa K. Honma M. Abe K. Takeda M. Mansur K. Obata T. Miwa A. Okado H. Kiyama H. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2875-2886Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The AxCANLacZ was provided kindly by Dr. Izumi Saito (University of Tokyo) (41Terashima T. Miwa A. Kanegae Y. Saito I. Okado H. Anat. Embryol. 1997; 196: 363-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The cells were infected by adding recombinant adenovirus (multiplicity of infection, 10) to keratinocyte growth medium. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. The medium was changed to fresh keratinocyte growth medium, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. NHK cells (5 × 106) were homogenized using the 6 mguanidine-cesium-guanidine method (36Maniatis T. Fritsch E.H. Sambrook T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Total RNA (30 μg) was electrophoresed in 1% agarose-formaldehyde gels and transferred to nylon filters. Human cystatin A and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were labeled with [32P]dCTP by the random primer method. Hybridization was performed as described previously (36Maniatis T. Fritsch E.H. Sambrook T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). GAPDH cDNA was a generous gift of Dr. Michael Tainsky (M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, University of Texas, Houston, TX). Total RNA was extracted from NHK cells and transcribed into cDNA as described previously (42Takahashi H. Kinouchi M. Tamura T. Iizuka H. Br. J. Dermatol. 1996; 134: 1065-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). cDNA was synthesized from 3 μg of total RNA in a 30-μl reaction mixture using random primers. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed according to the protocol of the LightCycler-DNA Master SYBER Green 1 kit (Roche Diagnostics K. K., Mannheim, Germany). Human cystatin A was amplified using specific oligonucleotide primers (5′-ATGATACCTGGAGGCTTATCT-3′ and 5′-CAAGTCCTCATTTTGTCCGGG-3′). The housekeeping gene GAPDH as a standard was amplified using the specific oligonucleotides 5′-TGGGCTACACTGAGCACCAG-3′ and 5′-CAGCGTCAAAGGTGGAGGAG-3′ (43Torma H. Karlsson T. Michaelsson G. Rollman O. Vahlquist A. Acta Derm. Venereol. 2000; 80: 4-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). DNA was amplified for 40 cycles on a LightCycler (Roche Diagnostics K.K.) at 95 °C for 5 s, 65 °C for 5 s, and 72 °C for 5 s. Cell extracts were prepared according to the method of Zettergren et al. (18Zettergren C.J. Peterson L. Wuepper K.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 238-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Cytosolic extracts (30 μg of protein) were electrophoresed on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose for 1 h in a buffer containing 25 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.3), 192 mm glycine, and 20% methanol. The blots were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in PBS for 1 h at room temperature and were then incubated at 4 °C overnight with anti-human cystatin A antibody (6Takahashi H. Kinouchi M. Wuepper K.D. Iizuka H. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1997; 108: 843-847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), anti-MEKK1 antibody (New England Biolabs), anti-MKK3 antibody (New England Biolabs), anti-MKK4 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-MKK7 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-JNK antibody (New England Biolabs), anti-ERK antibody (New England Biolabs), or anti-p38 antibody (New England Biolabs) diluted 500-fold in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.6). After washing with 0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline at room temperature, immunodetection was performed using a blot detection kit for rabbit antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Tissue specimens were fixed in 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin, and cut into consecutive sections of 5-μm thickness. The sections were treated with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide to block endogenous peroxidase activity. After incubation with normal goat serum diluted in PBS for 10 min, the sections were incubated for 4 h at room temperature with anti-ERK, anti-phospho-ERK, anti-JNK, or anti-phospho-JNK (New England Biolabs) antibodies diluted 1:200 in PBS. The sections were then washed with PBS followed by staining with the Histofine streptavidin-biotin (SAB)-PO(M) kit (Nichirei, Tokyo, Japan). Biotinylated goat anti-rabbit antibody was used as the secondary antibody, and the immune reaction was visualized by avidin/biotin complexing with 0.03% hydrogen peroxide as a substrate and diaminobenzidine as a chromogen. The sections were then counterstained with hematoxylin and mounted in PermaFlurTMaqueous mounting medium (IMMUNON, Pittsburgh, PA). DMCB153 medium was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Penicillin and streptomycin were obtained from M.A. Bioproducts (Walkersville, MD). PD90859 and SB203580 were purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). [α-32P]dCTP was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All other chemicals were purchased from Nakarai Chemicals Ltd. (Kyoto, Japan). Ras is a GTP-binding protein located upstream of the MAP kinase cascade (17Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2286) Google Scholar, 18Zettergren C.J. Peterson L. Wuepper K.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 238-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Although the activation of Ras is usually associated with receptor tyrosine kinase activation, recent studies demonstrated that Ras is also a downstream target of PKC (44Downward J. Graves J.D. Warne P.H. Rayter S. Cantrell D.A. Nature. 1990; 346: 719-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar, 45Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Mason C.S. Marshall C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4378-4383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). To determine whether Ras is involved in TPA-stimulated cystatin A promoter activity, the promoter vector (p648CAT) was transfected into NHK cells together with either da-ras or dn-ras vectors. As reported previously (6Takahashi H. Kinouchi M. Wuepper K.D. Iizuka H. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1997; 108: 843-847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 14Takahashi H. Asano K. Kinouchi M. Ishida-Yamamoto A. Wuepper K.D. Iizuka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17375-17380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), TPA significantly stimulated cystatin A promoter activity (Fig. 1). Co-transfection of the da-ras vector with p648CAT increased cystatin A promoter activity to a similar extent as TPA. The stimulatory effect of da-Ras was not affected by the presence or absence of TPA (Fig. 1), suggesting that the effect of the latter on cystatin A promoter activity is mediated via the activation of Ras. In contrast, co-transfection of dn-ras decreased both basal and TPA-stimulated promoter activity. This is consistent with the idea that TPA mediates its effects through the activation of Ras and also suggests that Ras is partially activated in NHK cells under the conditions employed (i.e. with 0.01 mm calcium). Ras activates various MAPK cascades including Raf-1/MEK1/ERK and MEKK1/MKK3/4/6/7/p38/JNK pathways (17Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2286) Google Scholar, 18Zettergren C.J. Peterson L. Wuepper K.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 238-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The effect of the Raf-1/MEK1/ERK pathway on cystatin A promoter activity was analyzed. Transfection of wt-raf or wt-ERK1/2 into p648CAT-transfected NHK cells decreased basal cystatin A promoter activity (Fig.2). On the other hand, transfection of the dominant negative forms of raf-1, MEK1, orERK1/2 markedly stimulated basal cystatin A promoter activity. The stimulatory effect was similar to that of transfecting da-ras (Fig. 2). The da-ras-induced stimulation of cystatin A promoter activity was not affected by co-transfection of wt-raf-1 or wt-ERK1/2 but was augmented by co-transfection of dominant negative forms of raf-1, MEK1, orERK1/2 (Fig. 2). This suggests that the Raf-1/MEK1/ERK1/2 pathway mediates the inhibitory effect on cystatin A promoter activity in NHK cells. Consistent with this, a MEK1 inhibitor, PD90859, increased cystatin A promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.3). This was observed even in the absence of transfection of da-Ras, again indicating that Ras is partially activated under our culture conditions. Increased promoter activity caused by PD90859 was augmented by the transfection of da-Raf-1 (Fig.3).Figure 3The MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 increases cystatin A promoter activity. Subconfluent NHK cells, which were transfected with 5 μg of p648CAT and 2 μg of da-Ras (closed box) or pSRa (empty vector, open box) were cultured for 24 h. The cells were then treated with various concentrations of PD98059 for 24 h, and the CAT activity was measured. The average CAT activities relative to the promoterless vector were calculated from at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Raf-1 is located upstream of ERK1. Accordingly, the stimulatory effect of dn-raf-1 was inhibited by the co-transfection of wt-ERK1 but not by co-transfection of dn-ERK1(Fig. 4). Co-transfection of dominant negative forms of JNK1 or p38 vectors had no effect on dn-raf-1-induced cystatin A promoter activity (Fig. 4), suggesting that the effect of dn-raf-1 is independent of JNK or p38 pathways. These results indicate that (i) the Raf-1/MEK1/ERK pathway suppresses cystatin A expression in NHK cells, (ii) Raf-1 is functionally located upstream of MEK1 and ERK1/2 in this cascade, and (iii) the Raf-1-dependent inhibitory pathway is distinct from JNK1 or p38 pathways in NHK cells. In addition to the Raf-1/MEK1/ERK pathway, Ras also activates the MEKK1-signaling cascade (46Stokoe D. Macdonald S.G. Cadwallader K. Symons M. Hancock J.F. Science. 1994; 264: 1463-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). MEKK1 activates MKK4, which in turn activates JNK and p38 (27Minden A. In A. McMahon M. Lange-Carter C. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1994; 266: 1719-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar, 29Yan M. Dai T. Deak J.C. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R. Templeton D.J. Nature. 1994; 372: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). MEKK1 also activates MKK7, which is a specific activator of JNK (31Moriguchi T. Toyoshima F. Masuyama N. Hanafusa H. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7045-7053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transfection of wt-MEKK1 increased cystatin A promoter activity in NHK cells (Fig. 5). This effect was similar to that of da-ras, and co-transfection of both da-Ras and wt-MEKK1 had no additive effect on the increased promoter activity (Fig. 5). This indicates that da-Ras mediates its stimulatory effect through MEKK1. Further analyses disclosed that the effect of da-Ras depends on MEKK1, MKK7, and JNK1 but not on MKK4 or p38. The transfection of dn-MEKK1, dn-MKK7, or dn-JNK suppressed basal promoter activity, whereas co-transfection of da-ras had no stimulatory effect (Fig.5). Transfection of dn-MKK3, dn-MKK4, or dn-p38 had no effect on basal promoter activity either. Furthermore, da-Ras showed stimulatory effects in these cells, indicating that MKK3, MKK4, or p38 are involved in the Ras-dependent activation of cystatin A expression in NHK cells. Western blot analysis showed the expression of MKK3, MKK4, and p38 in NHK cells. The p38 inhibitor, SB203580, also failed to diminish the increased cystatin A promoter activity induced by wtMEKK1 (data not shown). As described above, MEKK1 is located downstream of active Ras. Consistent with this, the transfection of MEKK1 stimulated cystatin A promoter activity in NHK cells (Fig.6). Co-transfection with dn-MKK7 or dn-JNK inhibited MEKK1-dependent stimulation of cystatin A promoter activity. Co-transfection of wt-ERK1 inhibited the MEKK1-stimulated promoter activity, whereas dn-ERK1 and dn-MEK1 augmented it. This was expected, because the suppressive effect of the Raf-1/MEK1/ERK pathway on cystatin A expression of NHK cells was abrogated under these conditions. Co-transfection of dn-MKK3, dn-MKK4, or dn-p38 had no effect on MEKK1-stimulated cystatin A promoter activity in NHK cells (Fig. 6). Western blot analysis showed the expression of MKK3, MKK4, and p38, suggesting an independent effect for promoter activity. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis confirmed that the transfection of wtMEKK1 into NHK cells increased cystatin A mRNA levels, whereas the transfection of dn-MEKK1, dn-MEK7, or dn-JNK decreased them (Fig.7). The transfection of dn-MKK3, dn-MKK4, dn-MKK7, or dn-p38 was without effect (data not shown). These results indicate that (i) the MEKK1/MKK7/JNK pathway induces up-regulation of cystatin A promoter activity, (ii) MEKK1 is functionally located upstream of MKK7 and JNK in this cascade, and (iii) activation of the MEKK1/MKK7/JNK pathway is distinct from the inhibitory pathway that depends on Raf-1/MEK1/ERK.Figure 7Influence on cystatin A mRNA expression by transfection of wt-MEKK1, dn-MEKK1, dn-MKK7, or dn-JNK1 expression vectors into NHK cells. NHK cells were cultured under low Ca2+ (0.01 mm) conditions. Subconfluent NHK cells were transfected with 2 μg of wt-MEKK1, dn-MEKK1, dn-MKK7, or dn-JNK1 expression vectors and cultured for 24 h under low Ca2+ (0.05 mm) conditions in the presence or absence of TPA (10 ng/ml). The expression level of cystatin A mRNA in the control was designated as 1.0.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Previous analyses revealed that the cystatin A promoter contains at least two putative TPA-responsive elements, T1 (−189 to −196) and T2 (−272 to −278), and T2 is most likely critical for TPA-dependent stimulation of cystatin A promoter activity (14Takahashi H. Asano K. Kinouchi M. Ishida-Yamamoto A. Wuepper K.D. Iizuka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17375-17380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To determine the critical region(s) for MAPK-dependent positive and negative regulation of cystatin A expression, T1- and/or T2-deleted constructs were co-transfected into NHK cells together with various MAPK vectors (Fig. 8). Deletion of T1 had no effect on the promoter activity; the T1-deleted vector allowed the retention of dn-MEK1-, dn-ERK1-, and wtMEKK1-dependent stimulatory effects on cystatin A promoter activity. In contrast, the T2-deleted vector resulted in a loss of stimulatory effects of dn-MEK1, dn-ERK1, and wtMEKK1 (Fig. 8). These results indicate that the T2 region of the cystatin A gene is critical for the regulation of not only the stimulatory MEKK1/MKK7/JNK pathway but also the inhibitory Raf-1/MEK1/ERK pathway. Because the Lipofectin method is not efficient enough for detecting changes in cystatin A mRNA levels by Northern blot or protein levels by Western blot in NHK cells, an adenovirus vector-dependent transfection system was utilized. Transfection of adenovirus vector containing da-ras (AxCAdaRas) increased cystatin A mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 9, lane 3). The transfection of adenovirus vector containing a dominant negative form of ERK1 (AxCAdnERK1) also increased cystatin A mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 9, lane 4). The co-transfection of AxCAdaRas and AxCAdn-ERK1 resulted in a more marked increase in cystatin A promoter activity (Fig. 9, lane 5). In contrast, the transfection of dominant negative MEKK1-expressing adenovirus vector (Ad-dn-MEKK1) suppressed the cystatin A expression. These results indicate that the activation of Ras does indeed stimulate cystatin A expression in NHK cells, which can be suppressed by the Raf-1/MEK1/ERK pathway. Immunohistochemical analyses were performed to locate active ERK and JNK proteins in the normal human epidermis. ERKs were expressed in nuclei of basal cell layers and cytoplasm of suprabasal cell layer (Fig.10A). The active phosphorylated forms of ERKs were present exclusively in the nuclei of the basal cell layer (Fig. 10B). This suggests that cystatin A expression is suppressed because of the activated Raf-1/MEK1/ERK pathway in the basal cell layer. On the other hand, JNK was detected in both cytosole and nuclei of upper spinous cell and granular cell layers (Fig. 10C). Furthermore, active phosphorylated JNK was found in the nuclei of upper spinous cell and granular cell layers (Fig.10D). This suggests that cystatin A expression is stimulated because of the activation of MEKK1/MKK7/JNK pathway as well as loss of inhibitory tonus via the Raf-1/MEK1/ERK pathway. All these results are consistent with the suprabasal expression pattern of cystatin A in the normal human epidermis (47Tezuka T. Qing J. Saheki M. Kusuda S. Takahashi M. Dermatology. 1994; 188: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Our results clearly demonstrated that AP-1-dependent cystatin A expression in the human epidermis is regulated by two MAP kinase systems: positively via MEKK1/MKK7/JNK and negatively via Raf-1/MEK1/ERK. Although both pathways are triggered by the activation of Ras, the differential localization of downstream targets (active ERK in the basal epidermis and active JNK in the upper epidermis) explains the suprabasal expression of cystatin A in the normal human epidermis. AP-1 is comprised of Jun and Fos protein families. Previously we reported that c-Fos and c-Jun and/or Jun D are involved in cystatin A expression (14Takahashi H. Asano K. Kinouchi M. Ishida-Yamamoto A. Wuepper K.D. Iizuka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17375-17380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Because active JNKs efficiently phosphorylate c-Jun and less efficiently phosphorylate Jun D, but do not phosphorylate Jun B at all, it is conceivable that c-Jun and/or Jun D are the regulatory factors for cystatin A expression (14Takahashi H. Asano K. Kinouchi M. Ishida-Yamamoto A. Wuepper K.D. Iizuka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17375-17380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It should be noted that c-Fos is constitutively expressed, whereas c-Jun is marginally expressed in the normal human epidermis (48Fisher G.J. Talwar H.S. Lin J. In P. McPhillips F. Wang Z.-Q. Li X. Wan Y. Kang S. Voorhees J.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1432-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). This suggests that c-Jun is more critical than c-Fos for AP-1-dependent regulation in normal human epidermis. It is known that the phosphorylation of c-Jun by JNK reduces its susceptibility to proteasome attack, increasing its half-life (49Musti A.M. Treier M. Bohmann D. Science. 1997; 275: 400-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). The activation of the Raf-1/MEK1/ERK pathway is usually associated with cell proliferation (19Cobb M.H. Robbins D.J. Boulton T.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 1025-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). On the other hand, terminal differentiation of keratinocytes is associated with growth arrest associated with the activation of other MAP kinases (50Schmidt M. Goebeler M. Posern G. Feller S.M. Seitz C.S. Brocker E.B. Rapp U.R. Ludwig S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41011-41017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In addition to TPA, calcium also induces keratinocyte differentiation, and our preliminary analysis suggested that high calcium concentrations (1.0 mm) decreased phosphorylated ERKs in NHK cells (data not shown). This is consistent with the finding that cystatin A expression is increased by calcium treatment in NHK cells (6Takahashi H. Kinouchi M. Wuepper K.D. Iizuka H. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1997; 108: 843-847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). TPA mediates its effects through the activation of PKC. Previously we reported that the expression of cystatin A is stimulated by PKC-α (14Takahashi H. Asano K. Kinouchi M. Ishida-Yamamoto A. Wuepper K.D. Iizuka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17375-17380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the expression of involucrin, another CE precursor protein, is also stimulated by PKC-α and PKC-η (51Takahashi H. Asano K. Manabe A. Kinouchi M. Ishida-Yamamoto A. Iizuka H. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 110: 218-223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) as well as by calcium. Recently Ng et al. (52Ng D.C. Shafaee S. Lee D. Bikle D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24080-24088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) reported that the calcium-responsive region of the involucrin gene is regulated by AP-1. Although these effects suggest that the expression of cystatin A and involucrin is regulated by a similar mechanism, Efimova et al. (25Efimova T. LaCelle P. Welter J.F. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24387-24395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) reported that involucrin gene expression in keratinocytes is stimulated by the PKC/Ras/MEKK1/p38 pathway but not by the JNK pathway. This implicates distinctive MAP kinase-dependent regulatory mechanisms among the keratinocyte differentiation markers. In the present study, we have characterized the nature of cystatin A expression in keratinocytes. The results demonstrate that (i) the stimulatory effect of TPA on cystatin A expression is mediated through Ras, (ii) the Ras/MEKK1/MEK7/JNK/AP1 and Raf-1/MEK1/ERK pathways mediate stimulation and inhibition of cystatin A promoter activity, respectively, and (iii) these pathways depend on an intact T2 region (−272 to −278) of the cystatin A gene. Our results define another novel TPA-dependent MAP kinase-mediated regulatory mechanism for keratinocyte differentiation. The technical assistance of K. Nishikura, K. Takahashi, and Y. Mera and the secretarial assistance of Y. Maekawa are greatly appreciated."
https://openalex.org/W1975693129,"P-glycoprotein (Pgp), the ATP-binding cassette multidrug transporter, exhibits a drug (substrate)-stimulatable ATPase activity, and vanadate (Vi) inhibits this activity by stably trapping the nucleoside diphosphate in the Pgp·ADP·Vi conformation. We recently demonstrated that Vi-induced 8-azido-[α-32P]ADP trapping into Pgp in the absence of substrate occurs both in the presence of 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP (following 8-azido-ATP hydrolysis) or 8-azido-[α-32P]ADP (without hydrolysis) and, the transition state intermediates generated under either condition are functionally indistinguishable. In this study, we compare the effect of substrates on Vi-induced 8-azido-[α-32P]ADP trapping into Pgp under both non-hydrolysis and hydrolysis conditions. We demonstrate that whereas substrates stimulate the Vi-induced trapping of 8-azido-[α-32P]ADP under hydrolysis conditions, they strongly inhibit Vi-induced trapping under non-hydrolysis conditions. This inhibition is concentration-dependent, follows first order kinetics, and is effected by drastically decreasing the affinity of nucleoside diphosphate for Pgp during trapping. However, substrates do not affect the binding of nucleoside diphosphate in the absence of Vi, indicating that the substrate-induced conformation exerts its effect at a step distinct from nucleoside diphosphate-binding. Our results demonstrate that during the catalytic cycle of Pgp, although the transition state, Pgp·ADP·Pi(Vi), can be generated both via the hydrolysis of ATP or by directly providing ADP to the system, in the presence of substrate the reaction is driven in the forward direction, i.e. hydrolysis of ATP. These data suggest that substrate-stimulated ATP hydrolysis by Pgp is a vectorial process. P-glycoprotein (Pgp), the ATP-binding cassette multidrug transporter, exhibits a drug (substrate)-stimulatable ATPase activity, and vanadate (Vi) inhibits this activity by stably trapping the nucleoside diphosphate in the Pgp·ADP·Vi conformation. We recently demonstrated that Vi-induced 8-azido-[α-32P]ADP trapping into Pgp in the absence of substrate occurs both in the presence of 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP (following 8-azido-ATP hydrolysis) or 8-azido-[α-32P]ADP (without hydrolysis) and, the transition state intermediates generated under either condition are functionally indistinguishable. In this study, we compare the effect of substrates on Vi-induced 8-azido-[α-32P]ADP trapping into Pgp under both non-hydrolysis and hydrolysis conditions. We demonstrate that whereas substrates stimulate the Vi-induced trapping of 8-azido-[α-32P]ADP under hydrolysis conditions, they strongly inhibit Vi-induced trapping under non-hydrolysis conditions. This inhibition is concentration-dependent, follows first order kinetics, and is effected by drastically decreasing the affinity of nucleoside diphosphate for Pgp during trapping. However, substrates do not affect the binding of nucleoside diphosphate in the absence of Vi, indicating that the substrate-induced conformation exerts its effect at a step distinct from nucleoside diphosphate-binding. Our results demonstrate that during the catalytic cycle of Pgp, although the transition state, Pgp·ADP·Pi(Vi), can be generated both via the hydrolysis of ATP or by directly providing ADP to the system, in the presence of substrate the reaction is driven in the forward direction, i.e. hydrolysis of ATP. These data suggest that substrate-stimulated ATP hydrolysis by Pgp is a vectorial process. P-glycoprotein ATP-binding cassette 2(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid vanadate The best studied form of multidrug resistance in tumor cells is that caused by the overexpression of P-glycoprotein (Pgp),1 a 150–170-kDa plasma membrane protein. Pgp is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily of transporter proteins and can extrude a range of hydrophobic anti-cancer drugs from the cell against a concentration gradient using the energy of ATP hydrolysis (1Gottesman M.M.

Orthovanadate (Vi) is an efficient inhibitor of Pgp ATPase activity because it is a transition state analogue of Pi (12Smith C.A. Rayment I.

The transition state intermediates generated under both hydrolysis and non-hydrolysis conditions were functionally indistinguishable except that the activation energy for generating the Pgp·8-azido-[α-32P]ADP·Vi transition state complex starting with 8-azido-[α-32P]ADP was ∼2.5 times greater than if 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP were used (15Sauna Z.E.

In this study, we have characterized the effect of substrates on generating the intermediate Pgp·8-azido-ADP·Vi under hydrolysis and non-hydrolysis conditions. Our results show that substrates strongly inhibit the Vi-induced trapping of 8-azido-[α-32P]ADP in the absence of ATP hydrolysis. This finding is in stark contrast to the stimulation of Vi-induced trapping of 8-azido-[α-32P]ADP into Pgp by substrates such as verapamil under 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP hydrolysis conditions (11Kerr K.M.

These studies indicate that substrates shift the equilibrium, driving the reaction in the forward direction, which results in the dissociation of Pi and ADP from the Pgp·ADP·Pi catalytic state intermediate following ATP hydrolysis rather than the formation of the transition state intermediate when ADP and Pi are provided under non-hydrolysis conditions. We suggest that in the presence of substrates, because of a drastic decrease in the affinity for nucleoside diphosphate under non-hydrolysis condition, Pgp and possibly other ABC transporters function mainly as ATP-hydrolyzing enzymes. 8-Azido-[α-32P]ATP (15–20 Ci/mmol), 8-azido-[α-32P]ADP (15–20 Ci/mmol), [α-32P]ADP (15–20 Ci/mmol), 8-azido-ATP, and 8-azido-ADP were purchased from Affinity Labeling Technologies, Inc.

Crude membranes (1 mg/ml) or proteoliposomes containing purified Pgp were incubated in the dark at 37 °C for 3–5 min in the presence of Me2SO or the indicated drug substrate in ATPase assay buffer (40 mm MES-Tris, pH 6.8, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm sodium azide, 2 mmEGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mmMgCl2) containing 50 μm8-azido-[α-32P]ATP or 8-azido-[α-32P]ADP (containing 2.5 μCi/nmol) and 250 μm Vi.

Several laboratories have demonstrated that Pgp exhibits ATPase activity that is stimulated severalfold by compounds including anti-cancer agents (6Urbatsch I.L. al-Shawi M.K. Senior A.E.

When 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP is provided to Pgp in the presence of Vi a single cycle of hydrolysis is mandatory to convert the 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP to 8-azido-[α-32P]ADP. Vi-induced trapping of 8-azido-[α-32P]-ADP into Pgp in the presence of substrates is significantly increased as a result of the increased 8-azido-ATP hydrolysis (11Kerr K.M. Sauna Z.E. Ambudkar S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8657-8664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 16Szabo K. Welker E. Bakos Muller M. Roninson I. Varadi A. Sarkadi B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10132-10138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It was thus interesting to find that when Vi-induced trapping was carried out under non-hydrolysis conditions, substrates such as verapamil and valinomycin strongly inhibited the trapping of 8-azido-[α-32P]ADP into Pgp (Fig.1). In addition, we have recently demonstrated that under hydrolysis conditions, a linear correlation exists between the extent of Vi-induced nucleoside diphosphate trapping and the -fold stimulation of steady state ATP hydrolysis in the presence of various substrates (11Kerr K.M. Sauna Z.E. Ambudkar S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8657-8664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Thus, different drugs stimulate 8-azido-[α-32P]ADP trapping generated through hydrolysis to different extents. In contrast, all of the drugs tested almost equally and completely (by ∼90%) inhibited trapping of nucleoside diphosphate carried out in the absence of hydrolysis (the data for verapamil and valinomycin are given in Fig. 1). There exists, however, the possibility that the drugs retard only the rate of Vi-induced trapping under non-hydrolysis conditions and that at steady state Pgp treated with drug would trap 8-azido-[α-32P]ADP to the same extent as the untreated Pgp. Fig. S1 in the Supplemental Material describes the time course of Vi-induced 8-azido-[α-32P]ADP trapping under non-hydrolysis conditions in purified Pgp reconstituted into liposome. It is clear that in both untreated Pgp and Pgp treated with verapamil (50 μm), the trapping of nucleotide rapidly reaches saturation, and at steady state the amount of 8-azido-[α-32P]ADP incorporated into Pgp treated with verapamil is less than 10% of that in the untreated Pgp. These experiments raised two significant questions. (a) How do the kinetics of stimulation and inhibition by substrates under hydrolysis and non-hydrolysis condition compare? (b) Is the substrate effect on the binding or the trapping of nucleotide? 32 P]ADP Trapping under Non-hydrolysis Conditions but Stimulates It under Hydrolysis Conditions—We addressed these questions by using the substrate verapamil, because a large number of studies have documented its stimulatory effect on ATP hydrolysis and on the Vi-induced trapping of 8-azido-[α-32P]ADP under hydrolysis conditions (7Sharom F.J., Yu, X. Doige C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24197-24202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,9Ambudkar S.V. Lelong I.H. Zhang J. Cardarelli C.O. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Fig. 2 A shows that verapamil stimulates the Vi-induced trapping of 8-azido-[α-32P]ADP up to 20 μmunder hydrolysis conditions in a concentration-dependent manner. Under non-hydrolysis condition verapamil, however, clearly inhibits the Vi-induced trapping of 8-azido-[α-32P]ADP with aKi of 7.2 μm. In addition, the data in Fig. 2 B demonstrate that consistent with previous results (23Sauna Z.E. Ambudkar S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11653-11661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) verapamil has no effect on the binding of 8-azido-[α-32P]ADP per se in the absence of Vi. The effect of verapamil and other drugs on the kinetics of 8-azido-[α-32P]ADP trapping into Pgp under hydrolysis conditions has been well characterized elsewhere (11Kerr K.M. Sauna Z.E. Ambudkar S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8657-8664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The experiments depicted above demonstrating that substrates reduce the extent of Vi-induced trapping of 8-azido- [α-32P]ADP into Pgp under non-hydrolysis conditions involve photo-cross-linking. This raises the possibility that this phenomenon may be an artifact caused by the effect of drug on the cross-linking step. We therefore used an experimental approach not involving photo-cross-linking. Proteoliposomes containing purified Pgp were incubated in the dark at 37 °C with 8-azido-[α-32P]ADP or 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP and Vi in the absence or presence of 50 μm verapamil. After incubation for a specified time as indicated in the legend to Fig. S2 (Supplemental Material), the reaction was stopped by adding 200-fold excess ATP, and the unbound nucleotides and Vi were removed by centrifugation. The radioactivity incorporated in the resuspended proteoliposomes was measured in a liquid scintillation counter. The data in Fig. S2 in the Supplemental Material show that in the presence of verapamil, the amount of occluded 8-azido-[α-32P]ADP decreases by >85% when the trapping is carried out under non-hydrolysis conditions. Conversely, under hydrolysis conditions, consistent with previous results (11Kerr K.M. Sauna Z.E. Ambudkar S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8657-8664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), treatment with verapamil results in an ∼2-fold increase in the amount of 8-azido-[α-32P]ADP trapped. It is thus clear that the opposing observed effects do not arise because of effects on the cross-linking of azido nucleotide with Pgp. The kinetics of 8-azido-[α-32P]ADP trapping under non-hydrolysis conditions were studied by incubating increasing concentrations of 8-azido-[α-32P]ADP in the presence of Vi with Pgp at 37 °C for 2 min followed by cross-linking. The experiment was carried out for 3 min at 37 °C on proteoliposomes pretreated with either Me2SO or 30 μm verapamil. Fig.3 shows that for the Vi-induced 8-azido-[α-32P]ADP trapping in untreated Pgp proteoliposomes, the single site model of Henri-Michaelis-Menten best described the data (R2 = 0.97) with aKd (8-azido-[α-32P]ADP) of 19.1 μm, which is comparable with that reported previously (11Kerr K.M. Sauna Z.E. Ambudkar S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8657-8664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 23Sauna Z.E. Ambudkar S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11653-11661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). However, in proteoliposomes treated with 30 μmverapamil, besides the fact that the extent of Vi-induced 8-azido-[α-32P]ADP is drastically reduced, there is no saturation of the signal observed even at 75 μm8-azido-[α-32P]ADP. Thus, although it is not possible to determine the Kd (8-azido-[α-32P]ADP) for Pgp treated with the substrate verapamil, it is clear that there is a significant decrease in the affinity for nucleoside diphosphate in the presence of verapamil. The data in Figs. 2 B and 3 demonstrate that verapamil affects a step subsequent to binding, which involves conformational change(s) leading to the formation of the transition state intermediate in the presence of Vi. The revised catalytic scheme for the drug-stimulated ATP hydrolysis by Pgp, based on the data reported here and recently published work (11Kerr K.M. Sauna Z.E. Ambudkar S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8657-8664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 23Sauna Z.E. Ambudkar S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11653-11661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), is depicted in Fig.4. Drug and ATP both bind to Pgp, and this is followed by ATP hydrolysis resulting in the transition state, Pgp·Drug·ADP·Pi. The drug, Pi, and ADP are released, and the release of ADP appears to be the rate-limiting step (11Kerr K.M. Sauna Z.E. Ambudkar S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8657-8664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). If Vi is provided in the reaction mixture, it traps the complex in the Pgp·ADP·Vi conformation (24Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Bhagat S. Senior A.E. J. Biol.

Myosin and the mitochondrial F1Fo-ATP synthase exhibit high affinity binding of ATP, but no such high affinity binding is evident in Pgp (4Senior A.E. Acta Physiol. Scand.

Chem. 2001; 276: 21199-21208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Similarly, the P-type ATPases involve the formation of a catalyticE ≃ P intermediate, and no such intermediate has been found to occur in Pgp (4Senior A.E. Acta Physiol. Scand. Suppl. 1998; 643: 213-218PubMed Google Scholar, 28Lelong I.H. Cardarelli C.O. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8921-8929Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that in Pgp ATP hydrolysis generates a high chemical potential state, and the relaxation of this state provides the energy for drug extrusion (3Senior A.E. al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 4Senior A.E. Acta Physiol. Scand. Suppl. 1998; 643: 213-218PubMed Google Scholar, 5Senior A.E. Gadsby D.C. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1997; 8: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Thus, the Pgp·ADP·Pi catalytic state intermediate would be central to the energetics of ATP hydrolysis by Pgp. The disassociation of this complex is a reversible process, which we recently have demonstrated directly by providing 8-azido-[α-32P]ADP in the presence of Vi to generate the Pgp·8-azido-[α-32P]ADP·Vi transition state (15Sauna Z.E. Smith M.M. Muller M. Ambudkar S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21199-21208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Similar results were also obtained when [α-32P]ADP was used instead of 8-azido-[α-32P]ADP (data not shown). This would imply that during the catalytic cycle of Pgp, ADP and Pi could in principle generate the Pgp·ADP·Pi intermediate in the absence of ATP hydrolysis indicated by the backward reaction shown in Steps 3 and 4 or the forward reaction in Step 5A (Fig. 4). There is considerable evidence that drug transport in Pgp is powered by ATP hydrolysis (3Senior A.E. al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L.

Thus, during the ATP hydrolysis cycle of Pgp it is imperative that the forward reaction (following ATP hydrolysis) generate the Pgp·ADP·Pi catalytic state intermediate and not the backward reaction (Fig. 4, Step 5B). The question then is, what drives the reaction in the forward direction? The data presented in this paper clearly show that the presence of substrate blocks the formation of the Pgp·ADP·Vi catalytic state intermediate under non-hydrolysis condition (the backward reaction). Our recent work also demonstrated that the activation energy for generating the Pgp·8-azido-[α-32P]ADP·Vi transition state complex starting with 8-azido-[α-32P]ADP was over 2.5 times greater than if 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP were used (15Sauna Z.E. Smith M.M. Muller M. Ambudkar S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21199-21208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that the combination of (i) the requirement for an intrinsic large energy barrier and (ii) the modulation by substrates shifts the equilibrium in the forward direction. Thus, the system, because of these energetic and kinetic constraints, appears to have a propensity in the presence of substrates to generate the Pgp·ADP·Pi transition state conformation mainly via the hydrolysis of nucleoside triphosphate. The mechanism by which substrates block formation of the transition state in the absence of ATP hydrolysis is not understood at present. We speculate that the conserved dodecapeptide linker region, also known as the ABC signature motif, which is implicated in the signal transduction from substrate-binding domains to the ATP sites (32Hyde S.C. Emsley P. Hartshorn M.J. Mimmack M.M. Gileadi U. Pearce S.R. Gallagher M.P. Gill D.R. Hubbard R.E. Higgins C.F. Nature. 1990; 346: 362-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar), may play a role in this phenomenon. Further work including directed mutagenesis of residues in ATP sites as well as resolution of crystal structure of Pgp ATP domains is required for the resolution of this novel regulation by substrates. Recently, the comparison of structures of one of the two ATP sites of the ArsA, the ATPase subunit of the bacterial arsenate transporter has provided important information about the conformational changes resulting from ATP hydrolysis (33Zhou T. Radaev S. Rosen B.P. Gatti D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30414-30422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The failure to obtain a Vi-induced ADP trapped transition state intermediate of bacterial maltose permease in the presence of maltose and maltose-binding protein under non-hydrolysis conditions (34Sharma S. Davidson A.L. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6570-6576Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) is consistent with the data on Pgp reported here, and we suggest that the substrate-mediated vectorial modulation of ATP hydrolysis might be a feature common to other ABC transporters. This is in contrast to P-type ATPases such as the Ca2+-ATPase of the sarcoplasmic reticulum and the Na+,K+-ATPase, where reversal of the ion concentration gradient has been shown at least in in vitro to drive synthesis of ATP from ADP (35Yamada S. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3108-3119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Repke K.R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1982; 402: 272-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). ABC transporters utilize the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis to effect substrate transport against a concentration gradient. Our results suggest that the vectorial control of ATP hydrolysis by substrates in conjunction with the thermodynamics of the system could be a common mechanism by which Pgp and other ABC transporters, consistent with their physiological role, act primarily as ATPases that couple energy from ATP hydrolysis to substrate transport.
