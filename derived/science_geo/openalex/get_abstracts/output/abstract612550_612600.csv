https://openalex.org/W2807942438,"Background Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an endogenous regulator of the renin angiotensin system. Increased circulating ACE2 predicts adverse outcomes in patients with heart failure (HF), but it is unknown if elevated plasma ACE2 activity predicts major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). Methods We prospectively recruited patients with obstructive CAD (defined as ≥50% stenosis of the left main coronary artery and/or ≥70% stenosis in ≥ 1 other major epicardial vessel on invasive coronary angiography) and measured plasma ACE2 activity. Patients were followed up to determine if circulating ACE2 activity levels predicted the primary endpoint of MACE (cardiovascular mortality, HF or myocardial infarction). Results We recruited 79 patients with obstructive coronary artery disease. The median (IQR) plasma ACE2 activity was 29.3 pmol/ml/min [21.2–41.2]. Over a median follow up of 10.5 years [9.6–10.8years], MACE occurred in 46% of patients (36 events). On Kaplan-Meier analysis, above-median plasma ACE2 activity was associated with MACE (log-rank test, p = 0.035) and HF hospitalisation (p = 0.01). After Cox multivariable adjustment, log ACE2 activity remained an independent predictor of MACE (hazard ratio (HR) 2.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.24–4.72, p = 0.009) and HF hospitalisation (HR: 4.03, 95% CI: 1.42–11.5, p = 0.009). Conclusions Plasma ACE2 activity independently increased the hazard of adverse long-term cardiovascular outcomes in patients with obstructive CAD."
https://openalex.org/W2807778550,"There is highly suggestive evidence for an effect of air pollution exposure on dementia-related outcomes, but evidence is not yet present to clearly pinpoint which pollutants are the probable causal agents. The aims of this study was to assess the longitudinal association between exposures of fine ambient particulate matter (PM2.5) from residential wood burning, and vehicle exhaust, with dementia.We used data from the Betula study, a longitudinal study of dementia in Umeå, Northern Sweden. The study size was 1 806 and the participants were followed from study entry (1993-1995) to 2010. Modelled levels of source-specific fine particulate matter at the residential address were combined with information on wood stoves or wood boilers, and with validated data on dementia diagnosis and individual-level characteristics from the Betula study. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate Hazard Ratios (HRs) and their 95% CIs for dementia incidence (vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease), adjusted for individual-level characteristics.The emission of PM2.5 from local residential wood burning was associated with dementia incidence with a hazard ratio of 1.55 for a 1 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.00-2.41, p-value 0.05). Study participants with an address in an area with the highest quartile of PM2.5 from residential wood burning and who also had a wood-burning stove were more likely to develop dementia than those in the lower three quartiles without a wood-burning stove with hazard ratios of 1.74 (CI: 1.10-2.75, p-value 0.018). Particulate matter from traffic exhaust seemed to be associated with dementia incidence with hazard ratios of 1.66, (CI: 1.16-2.39), p-value 0.006, and 1.41 (CI: 0.97-2.23), p-value 0.07, in the third and fourth quartiles, respectively.If the associations we observed are causal, then air pollution from residential wood burning, and air pollution from traffic, might be independent important risk factors for dementia."
https://openalex.org/W2808346138,"Mangrove endophytic fungi can produce impressive quantities of metabolites with promising antioxidant activities that may be useful to humans as novel physiological agents. In this study, we investigated the phylogenetic diversity and antioxidant potential of 46 fungal endophytes derived from the mangrove species Rhizophora stylosa and R. mucronata from the South China Sea. The fungal isolates were identified using a combination of morphological characteristics and phylogenetic analysis of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences. Seventeen genera belonging to 8 taxonomic orders of Ascomycota were discovered, specifically, Botryosphaeriales, Capnodiales, Diaporthales, Eurotiales, Glomerellales, Hypocreales, Pleosporales, and Xylariales. The most abundant fungal orders included Xylariales (35.49%) and Diaporthales (27.61%), which were predominantly represented by the culturable species Pestalotiopsis sp. (34.54%) and Diaporthe sp. (18.62%). The stems showed more frequent colonization and species diversity than the roots, leaves, hypocotyls, and flower tissues of the host plant. The antioxidant activities of all the isolated fungal extracts on four different culture media were assessed using improved 2,2'-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonicacid) (ABTS) methods. A relatively high proportion (84.8%) of the isolates displayed antioxidant capacity (%RSA > 50%). Further research also provided the first evidence that HQD-6 could produce flufuran as a significant radical scavenger with IC50 values of 34.85±1.56 and 9.75±0.58 μg/mL, respectively. Our findings suggest that the utilization of a biotope such as that of the endophytic fungal community thriving on the mangrove plants R. stylosa and R. mucronata may be suitable for use as a sustainable resource for natural antioxidants."
https://openalex.org/W2808221974,"Lactation records from 396,534 pedigree Holstein and Holstein-Friesian primiparous cows from 6,985 UK milk recorded herds, calving for the first time during the period between the 1st of January 2006 and the 31st of December 2008, were examined in order to determine the associations between age at first calving (AFC) and subsequent production, udder health, fertility and survivability parameters. Heifers were grouped by AFC into single month classes ranging from 21 to 42 months. Mixed effects multivariable regression modelling was used for data analysis. Mean and median AFC were 29.1 and 28 months respectively. Within the study, only 48,567 heifers (12.3% of the studied population) calved for the first time at 24 months of age or younger. 162,157 heifers (40.9%) were 30 months or older at their first calving. An increased AFC was associated with increased first lactation milk, fat and protein yields. The lowest predicted mean 305-day yield (6,617kgs; 95% confidence interval (CI): 6,546–6,687 kgs) was recorded for the 21 month AFC class, significantly lower than any other class. The 36 month AFC class had the highest predicted mean (7,774 kgs; 95% CI: 7,737–7,811 kgs). However, an increased AFC was also associated with increased calving interval and increased first lactation somatic cell count (SCC). Animals calving at 21 months had a predicted mean lactation SCC of 72,765 (95% CI: 68427–77378). Animals calving at 36 months of age had a predicted mean lactation SCC of 86,648 (95% CI: 84,499–88,853). Importantly, an increased AFC was also associated with decreased lifetime daily milk yield and decreased likelihood of calving for a second successive time. Animals calving at 22 months of age had a predicted mean daily lifetime milk yield of 15.24 kgs (95% CI: 15.06–15.35); animals calving at 36 months of age had a predicted mean daily lifetime milk yield of 12.83 kgs (95% CI: 12.76–12.91). Our results highlight the importance of achieving a lower age at first calving which was here associated with improved udder health, increased lifetime daily milk yield, improved reproductive performance and increased likelihood of calving for a second time."
https://openalex.org/W2808529048,"Research in the field of work and organizational psychology increasingly highlights the importance of meaningful work. Adding to this growing body of research, this study examined the complex linkage between meaningful work and performance. More specifically, we hypothesized that meaningful work has a positive relationship with an employee’s performance in several and interrelated ways, via employees’ use of strengths, via work engagement, and via strengths use affecting work engagement. We conducted a structural equation modeling on a sample of 459 professionals working at a global operating organization for health technology. The results provided support for the proposed model which showed a better fit than the sequential mediation model and the direct effects model. This indicates that the meaningful work–performance relationship is predicted best by multiple pathways via employees’ use of strengths and work engagement. The main theoretical, practical, and methodological implications of the results are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2808291409,"Introduction Too often dementia care is still fragmented and unresponsive to the needs of people living with dementia and their family caregivers. To develop effective health care services, in-depth insight into the experiences of family caregivers is a prerequisite. Methods This Dutch study is a qualitative interview study. The aim was twofold: 1) to develop an in-depth understanding of what it means to live with dementia and 2) to gain insight into what constitutes the art of living with dementia, both from the perspective of family caregivers. Data were gathered through 47 interviews with individuals and 6 focus group interviews. The analysis followed a phenomenologically inspired thematic approach. Results The findings show that living with dementia can be understood as becoming entangled in uncertainty and isolation. The following themes illustrate this experience in various phases of the disease: a) Before the diagnosis: a growing uneasy feeling that something is amiss; b) The diagnostic disclosure: an uncertain and upsetting relief; c) Dementia at home: entangled in an isolated and exhausting life; d) Capitulation to relocation: torn between relief and grief. In addition, the study shows that the art of living with dementia is associated with: a) The ability to face tragedy; b) The discovery of meaning and dignity in the context of illness; c) Retaining a sense of connection and bond; d) The primacy of attention and recognition by others. Discussion and conclusion Our findings show that dealing with what Boss (2011) called ‘ambiguous loss-experiences’ is one of the most demanding aspects of living with dementia. Based on the findings, we have developed a model that depicts how people handle contingency and seek balance along the continuum of facing and resisting. Our study shows that resilience in the context of living with dementia should not be understood as merely an individual mental ability, nor as a set of behaviours, but rather as a social-ecological enterprise."
https://openalex.org/W2808284277,"Intestinal barrier function and microbiota are integrally related and play critical roles in maintenance of host physiology. Sex is a key biologic variable for several disorders. Our aim was to determine sex-based differences in response to perturbation and subsequent recovery of intestinal barrier function and microbiota in healthy humans. Twenty-three volunteers underwent duodenal biopsies, mucosal impedance, and in vivo permeability measurement. Permeability testing was repeated after administration of indomethacin, then 4 to 6 wk after its discontinuation. Duodenal and fecal microbiota composition was determined using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Healthy women had lower intestinal permeability and higher duodenal and fecal microbial diversity than healthy men. Intestinal permeability increases after indomethacin administration in both sexes. However, only women demonstrated decreased fecal microbial diversity, including an increase in Prevotella abundance, after indomethacin administration. Duodenal microbiota composition did not show sex-specific changes. The increase in permeability and microbiota changes normalized after discontinuation of indomethacin. In summary, women have lower intestinal permeability and higher microbial diversity. Intestinal permeability is sensitive to perturbation but recovers to baseline. Gut microbiota in women is sensitive to perturbation but appears to be more stable in men. Sex-based differences in intestinal barrier function and microbiome should be considered in future studies.-Edogawa, S., Peters, S. A., Jenkins, G. D., Gurunathan, S. V., Sundt, W.

https://openalex.org/W2808185486,"Objective We identified patients with non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) disease in the US Veterans Health Administration (VHA), examined the distribution of diseases by NTM species, and explored the association between NTM disease and the frequency of clinic visits and mortality. Methods We combined mycobacterial isolate (from natural language processing) with ICD-9-CM diagnoses from VHA data between 2008 and 2012 and then applied modified ATS/IDSA guidelines for NTM diagnosis. We performed validation against a reference standard of chart review. Incidence rates were calculated. Two nested case-control studies (matched by age and location) were used to measure the association between NTM disease and each of 1) the frequency of outpatient clinic visits and 2) mortality, both adjusted by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), other structural lung diseases, and immunomodulatory factors. Results NTM cases were identified with a sensitivity of 94%, a specificity of >99%. The incidence of NTM was 12.6/100k patient-years. COPD was present in 68% of pulmonary NTM. NTM incidence was highest in the southeastern US. Extra-pulmonary NTM rates increased during the study period. The incidence rate ratio of clinic visits in the first year after diagnosis was 1.3 [95%CI 1.34–1.35]. NTM patients had a hazard ratio of mortality of 1.4 [95%CI 1.1–1.9] in the 6 months after NTM identification compared to controls and 1.99 [95%CI 1.8–2.3] thereafter. Conclusions In VHA, pulmonary NTM disease is commonly associated with COPD, with the highest rates in the southeastern US. After adjustment, NTM patients had more clinic visits and greater mortality compared to matched patients."
https://openalex.org/W2808329680,"The third plague pandemic originated from Yunnan Province, China in the middle of the 19th century. The last human plague epidemic in Yunnan occurred from 1986-2005. On June 6, 2016, a case of human plague was reported in the Xishuangbanna Prefecture, Yunnan. The patient suffered from primary septicemic plague after exposure to a dead house rat (Rattus flavipectus), which has been identified as the main plague reservoir in the local epizootic area. Moreover, a retrospective investigation identified another bubonic plague case in this area. Based on these data, human plague reemerged after a silent period of ten years. In this study, three molecular typing methods, including a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) analysis, different region analysis (DFR), and multiple-locus variable number of tandem repeats analysis (MLVA), were used to illustrate the molecular characteristics of Yersinia pestis (Y. pestis) strains isolated in Yunnan. The DFR profiles of the strains isolated in Yunnan in 2016 were the same as the strains that had previously been isolated in this Rattus flavipectus plague focus. The c3 spacer present in the previously isolated strains was absent in the spacer arrays of the Ypc CRISPR loci of the strains isolated in 2016. The MLVA analysis using MLVA (14+12) showed that the strains isolated from the human plague case and host animal plague infection in 2016 in Yunnan displayed different molecular patterns than the strains that had previously been isolated from Yunnan and adjacent provinces."
https://openalex.org/W2808539940,"Seagrass habitats provide important ecosystem services, including their ability to take up and store substantial amounts of organic carbon, known as 'blue carbon.' However, the paucity of geospatial and carbon storage information along the Pacific Coast of Canada hinders the inclusion of blue carbon storage data in conservation planning and policy development in coastal habitats. We assessed the carbon storage and accumulation rates in three eelgrass (Zostera marina) meadows in southern Clayoquot Sound on the Pacific Coast of British Columbia. The intertidal and subtidal portions of each meadow were mapped and sampled to estimate eelgrass density, biomass, and carbon, and sediment cores were analyzed to estimate sediment carbon storage and accumulation rates. Aboveground biomass measurements were consistent with estimates for Z. marina in other regions, with average aboveground carbon biomass estimates of 16.78 g C m-2 and 16.25 g C m-2 in the intertidal and subtidal areas, respectively. However, the estimated aboveground to belowground biomass ratio was an order of magnitude higher than for seagrass species in temperate/tropical areas, largely because belowground biomass was up to 10 times lower than for other Z. marina meadows, averaging 6.17 g C m-2 and 5.03 g C m-2 in the intertidal and subtidal zones, respectively. Sediment carbon concentrations did not exceed 1.30%Corg, and carbon accumulation rates ranged from 2.90-39.61 g Corg m-2 yr-1, decreasing with depth and averaging 10.8 ± 5.2 g Corg m-2 yr-1. While sediment carbon stocks were generally higher in the eelgrass meadows relative to non-vegetated reference sites, carbons stocks averaged 1343 ± 482 g Corg m-2, substantially less than global averages. These carbon results confirm that eelgrass does contribute to carbon storage in Clayoquot Sound but at lower rates than identified for more tropical seagrasses. By improving the quantification of site-specific carbon dynamics, eelgrass' role in climate change mitigation and conservation planning can be assessed."
https://openalex.org/W2808670255,"Changes in climate are rapidly modifying the Arctic environment. As a result, human activities-and the sounds they produce-are predicted to increase in remote areas of Greenland, such as those inhabited by the narwhals (Monodon monoceros) of East Greenland. Meanwhile, nothing is known about these whales' acoustic behavior or their reactions to anthropogenic sounds. This lack of knowledge was addressed by instrumenting six narwhals in Scoresby Sound (Aug 2013-2016) with Acousonde™ acoustic tags and satellite tags. Continuous recordings over up to seven days were used to describe the acoustic behavior of the whales, in particular their use of three types of sounds serving two different purposes: echolocation clicks and buzzes, which serve feeding, and calls, presumably used for social communication. Logistic regression models were used to assess the effects of location in time and space on buzzing and calling rates. Buzzes were mostly produced at depths of 350-650 m and buzzing rates were higher in one particular fjord, likely a preferred feeding area. Calls generally occurred at shallower depths (<100 m), with more than half of these calls occurring near the surface (<7 m), where the whales also spent more than half of their time. A period of silence following release, present in all subjects, was attributed to the capture and tagging operations, emphasizing the importance of longer (multi-day) records. This study provides basic life-history information on a poorly known species-and therefore control data in ongoing or future sound-effect studies."
https://openalex.org/W2808054468,"Aggregation during diapause is a common phenomenon in arthropods that nevertheless remains poorly understood. The most commonly claimed benefit is that survival is higher in aggregations but animal aggregations could also be driven by sexual selection. In this perspective, we investigated whether aggregations in insects could be part of their mating system. We studied the overwintering aggregations of the ladybird Hippodamia undecimnotata (Schneider), an aphidophagous species from Southern and Eastern Europe as well as Asia. We collected ladybirds at three aggregation sites in Southwest France, during two overwintering periods (2013–2014 and 2014–2015). We checked their reproductive status by counting the viable sperm cells in the sperm storage organs of both males and females, and by assessing the ovarian status of females. We also investigated if mating behaviour occurred in these aggregations. We found that males have a high quantity of viable sperm cells (70–95%) in their reproductive organs throughout the overwintering periods. In contrast, although most females (85–95%) had empty spermatheca at the onset of the aggregations in autumn, the majority (65–91%) had numerous viable sperm in their spermatheca at the time of dispersal from the aggregation in early spring. Furthermore, frequent copulations were observed towards the end of the overwintering period, few weeks before dispersal. These results suggest that finding sexual mates may have been involved in overwintering aggregations in H. undecimnotata."
https://openalex.org/W2808515516,"The NAC transcription factors involved plant development and response to various stress stimuli. However, little information is available concerning the NAC family in the woodland strawberry. Herein, 37 NAC genes were identified from the woodland strawberry genome and were classified into 13 groups based on phylogenetic analysis. And further analyses of gene structure and conserved motifs showed closer relationship of them in every subgroup. Quantitative real-time PCR evaluation different tissues revealed distinct spatial expression profiles of the FvNAC genes. The comprehensive expression of FvNAC genes revealed under abiotic stress (cold, heat, drought, salt), signal molecule treatments (H2O2, ABA, melatonin, rapamycin), biotic stress (Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and Ralstonia solanacearum). Expression profiles derived from quantitative real-time PCR suggested that 5 FvNAC genes responded dramatically to the various abiotic and biotic stresses, indicating their contribution to abiotic and biotic stresses resistance in woodland strawberry. Interestingly, FvNAC genes showed greater extent responded to the cold treatment than other abiotic stress, and H2O2 exhibited a greater response than ABA, melatonin, and rapamycin. For biotic stresses, 3 FvNAC genes were up-regulated during infection with C. gloeosporioides, while 6 FvNAC genes were down-regulated during infection with R. solanacearum. In conclusion, this study identified candidate FvNAC genes to be used for the genetic improvement of abiotic and biotic stress tolerance in woodland strawberry."
https://openalex.org/W2807966979,"Background Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been reported to have a negative effect on bone mineral density (BMD) in Asian populations. Whether such an association exists in Western populations is less clear. Methods This cross-sectional analysis of data from NHANES III, a United States national health survey conducted from 1988 to 1994, included 6089 participants aged 40–75 years, selected after excluding people with hepatitis virus serology, elevated alcohol consumption, decreased renal function, or steroid use, and pregnant females. The main outcome, BMD at the femoral neck, was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. The primary exposure, NAFLD, was defined as moderate or severe hepatic steatosis diagnosed using abdominal ultrasonography. Result After controlling for gender and menopausal status, race/ethnicity, age and body mass index, NAFLD was not significantly associated with BMD (beta coefficient: −0.006, 95%CI: −0.016, 0.003). A secondary analysis categorized participants with NAFLD according to their serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels into high and normal ALT NAFLD groups, and compared these with the non-NAFLD group. NAFLD with higher levels of ALT was associated with lower levels of BMD (beta coefficient: −0.023, 95% CI: −0.044, −0.002). Conclusion This study showed a relationship between NAFLD with high ALT and lower BMD in the general U.S. population."
https://openalex.org/W2807855262,"Pressure garment therapy is often prescribed to improve scar properties following full-thickness burn injuries. Pressure garment therapy is generally recommended for long periods of time following injury (1–2 years), though it is plagued by extremely low patient compliance. The goal of this study was to examine the effects of early cessation of pressure garment therapy on scar properties. Full-thickness burn injuries were created along the dorsum of red Duroc pigs. The burn eschar was excised and wound sites autografted with split-thickness skin. Scars were treated with pressure garments within 1 week of injury and pressure was maintained for either 29 weeks (continuous pressure) or for 17 weeks followed by cessation of pressure for an additional 12 weeks (pressure released); scars receiving no treatment served as controls. Scars that underwent pressure garment therapy were significantly smoother and less contracted with decreased scar height compared to control scars at 17 weeks. These benefits were maintained in the continuous pressure group until week 29. In the pressure released group, grafts significantly contracted and became more raised, harder and rougher after the therapy was discontinued. Pressure cessation also resulted in large changes in collagen fiber orientation and increases in collagen fiber thickness. The results suggest that pressure garment therapy effectively improves scar properties following severe burn injury; however, early cessation of the therapy results in substantial loss of these improvements."

The aim of this research was to investigate, from a carer's perspective, the factors that influenced the quality of life of these young people.Families of young people with Down syndrome (n = 197), aged 16-31 years, living in Western Australia, took part in a questionnaire study regarding young person daily functioning, family characteristics, medical background and quality of life measured by the Kidscreen 27-item scale. Kidscreen-10 total score was used as an outcome in the investigation of determinants with higher scores indicating better quality of life.After adjustment for confounders including carer's mental health measured by the Depression and Anxiety Scale (DASS), global impact of illness as well as impact of mental health and bowel conditions were all negatively associated with the young person's quality of life. Young people who had three or more friends had better quality of life than those with no friends. Scores were lower (reflecting poor quality of life) in individuals who had more behavioural problems but these relationships were attenuated after adjustment for confounders and DASS.Overall, our findings revealed that quality of life of young people with Down syndrome was most negatively associated with burden of medical conditions, but also with lack of friendships. We were somewhat surprised to find the effect of medical problems on quality of life persisting into adolescence and adulthood where in general the burden of medical comorbidities is much less than in childhood."
https://openalex.org/W2807784135,"Birt-Hogg-Dube’ Syndrome (BHDS) is a rare genetic disorder in humans characterized by skin hamartomas, lung cysts, pneumothorax, and increased risk of renal tumors. BHDS is caused by mutations in the BHD gene, which encodes for Folliculin, a cytoplasmic adapter protein that binds to Folliculin interacting proteins-1 and -2 (Fnip1, Fnip2) as well as the master energy sensor AMP kinase (AMPK). Whereas kidney-specific deletion of the Bhd gene in mice is known to result in polycystic kidney disease (PKD) and renal cell carcinoma, the roles of Fnip1 in renal cell development and function are unclear. In this study, we utilized mice with constitutive deletion of the Fnip1 gene to show that the loss of Fnip1 is sufficient to result in renal cyst formation, which was characterized by decreased AMPK activation, increased mTOR activation, and metabolic hyperactivation. Using RNAseq, we found that Fnip1 disruption resulted in many cellular and molecular changes previously implicated in the development of PKD in humans, including alterations in the expression of ion and amino acid transporters, increased cell adhesion, and increased inflammation. Loss of Fnip1 synergized with Tsc1 loss to hyperactivate mTOR, increase Erk activation, and greatly accelerate the development of PKD. Our results collectively define roles for Fnip1 in regulating kidney development and function, and provide a model for how loss of Fnip1 contributes to PKD and perhaps renal cell carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W4230262700,"Paclitaxel is a powerful chemotherapeutic drug, used for the treatment of many cancer types, including esophageal adenocarcinomas (EAC). Autophagy is a lysosome-dependent degradation process maintaining cellular homeostasis. Defective autophagy has been implicated in cancer biology and therapy resistance. We aimed to assess the impact of autophagy on chemotherapy response in EAC, with a special focus on paclitaxel. Responsiveness of EAC cell lines, OE19, FLO-1, OE33 and SK-GT-4, to paclitaxel was assessed using Alamar Blue assays. Autophagic flux upon paclitaxel treatment in vitro was assessed by immunoblotting of LC3B-II and quantitative assessment of WIP1 mRNA. Immunohistochemistry for the autophagy markers LC3B and p62 was applied on tumor tissue from 149 EAC patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, including pre- and post-therapeutic samples (62 matched pairs). Tumor response was assessed by histology. For comparison, previously published data on 114 primary resected EAC cases were used. EAC cell lines displayed differing responsiveness to paclitaxel treatment; however this was not associated with differential autophagy regulation. High p62 cytoplasmic expression on its own (p ≤ 0.001), or in combination with low LC3B (p = 0.034), was associated with nonresponse to chemotherapy, regardless of whether or not the regiments contained paclitaxel, but there was no independent prognostic value of LC3B or p62 expression patterns for EAC after neoadjuvant treatment. p62 and related pathways, most likely other than autophagy, play a role in chemotherapeutic response in EAC in a clinical setting. Therefore p62 could be a novel therapeutic target to overcome chemoresistance in EAC."
https://openalex.org/W2808197261,"Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) is a rare tumor suppressor syndrome that manifests with multiple schwannomas and meningiomas. There are no effective drug therapies for these benign tumors and conventional therapies have limited efficacy. Various model systems have been created and several drug targets have been implicated in NF2-driven tumorigenesis based on known effects of the absence of merlin, the product of the NF2 gene. We tested priority compounds based on known biology with traditional dose-concentration studies in meningioma and schwann cell systems. Concurrently, we studied functional kinome and gene expression in these cells pre- and post-treatment to determine merlin deficient molecular phenotypes. Cell viability results showed that three agents (GSK2126458, Panobinostat, CUDC-907) had the greatest activity across schwannoma and meningioma cell systems, but merlin status did not significantly influence response. In vivo, drug effect was tumor specific with meningioma, but not schwannoma, showing response to GSK2126458 and Panobinostat. In culture, changes in both the transcriptome and kinome in response to treatment clustered predominantly based on tumor type. However, there were differences in both gene expression and functional kinome at baseline between meningioma and schwannoma cell systems that may form the basis for future selective therapies. This work has created an openly accessible resource (www.synapse.org/SynodosNF2) of fully characterized isogenic schwannoma and meningioma cell systems as well as a rich data source of kinome and transcriptome data from these assay systems before and after treatment that enables single and combination drug discovery based on molecular phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2808692506,"Increasing evidence has confirmed that nigral iron accumulation and activation of NMDA receptors (NRs) contribute to the neurodegeneration of dopamine (DA) neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD). Earlier work indicated that activation of NRs participated in iron metabolism in the hippocampus. However, the relationship between activation of NRs and iron accumulation in DA neurons of the substantia nigra in PD was unknown. In this study, our results showed that NRs inhibitors MK-801 and AP5 protected nigrostriatal projection system and reduced nigral iron levels of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced PD rats. In vitro studies demonstrated that NMDA treatment increased the expression of iron importer divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) and decreased the expression of iron exporter ferro- potin 1 (Fpn1), which were dependent on iron regulatory protein 1 (IRP1). This led to increased intracellular iron levels and intensified the decrease in mitochondrial transmembrane potential in MES23.5 dopaminergic neurons. In addition, we reported that MK801 and neuronal nitric oxide synthase inhibitor could antagonize 6-OHDA-induced up- regulation of IRP1 and DMT1 and down-regulation of Fpn1, thus attenuating 6-OHDA-induced iron accumulation in MES23.5 cells. This suggested that 6-OHDA-induced activation of NRs might modulate the expression of DMT1 and Fpn1 via the neuronal nitric oxide synthase-IRP1 pathway.—Xu, H., Liu, X., Xia, J., Yu, T., Qu, Y., Jiang, H., Xie, J., Activation of NMDA receptors mediated iron accumulation via modulating iron transporters in Parkinson's disease.

The purpose of this study was to analyze climate and environmental parameters associated with malaria transmission in Korhogo, a city in northern Côte d’Ivoire. All data were collected over a 10-year period (2004–2013). Rainfall, temperature and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were the climate and environmental variables considered. Association between these variables and clinical malaria data was determined, using negative binomial regression models. From 2004 to 2013, there was an increase in the annual average precipitation (1100.3–1376.5 mm) and the average temperature (27.2°C—27.5°C). The NDVI decreased from 0.42 to 0.40. We observed a strong seasonality in these climatic variables, which resembled the seasonality in clinical malaria. An incremental increase of 10 mm of monthly precipitation was, on average, associated with a 1% (95% Confidence interval (CI): 0.7 to 1.2%) and a 1.2% (95% CI: 0.9 to 1.5%) increase in the number of clinical malaria episodes one and two months later respectively. A 1°C increase in average monthly temperature was, on average, associated with a decline of a 3.5% (95% CI: 0.1 to 6.7%) in clinical malaria episodes. A 0.1 unit increase in monthly NDVI was associated with a 7.3% (95% CI: 0.8 to 14.1%) increase in the monthly malaria count. There was a similar increase for the preceding-month lag (6.7% (95% CI: 2.3% to 11.2%)). The study results can be used to establish a malaria early warning system in Korhogo to prepare for outbreaks of malaria, which would increase community resilience no matter the magnitude and pattern of climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2807891294,"This study explores the long-term effects of exposure to a maternal Western diet (WD) vs. standard diet (SD) in the Yucatan minipig, on the adult progeny at lean status (n = 32), and then overweight status. We investigated eating behavior, cognitive abilities, brain basal glucose metabolism, dopamine transporter availability, microbiota activity, blood lipids, and glucose tolerance. Although both groups demonstrated similar cognitive abilities in a holeboard test, WD pigs expressed a higher stress level than did SD pigs (immobility, P < 0.05) and lower performance in an alley maze (P = 0.06). WD pigs demonstrated lower dopamine transporter binding potential in the hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex (P < 0.05 for both), as well as a trend in putamen (P=0.07), associated with lower basal brain activity in the prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens (P < 0.05) compared with lean SD pigs. Lean WD pigs demonstrated a lower glucose tolerance than did SD animals (higher glucose peak, P < 0.05) and a tendency to a higher incremental area under the curve of insulin from 0 to 30 minutes after intravenous glucose injection (P < 0.1). Both groups developed glucose intolerance with overweight, but WD animals were less impacted than SD animals. These results demonstrate that maternal diet shaped the offspring's brain functions and cognitive responses long term, even after being fed a balanced diet from weaning, but behavioral effects were only revealed in WD pigs under anxiogenic situation; however, WD animals seemed to cope better with the obesogenic diet from a metabolic standpoint.—Gautier, Y., Luneau, I., Coquery, N., Meurice, P., Malbert, C.-H., Guerin, S., Kemp, B., Bolhuis, J.

https://openalex.org/W2808137767,"Tissue calcification is an important physiological process required for the normal structure and function of bone. However, ectopic or excessive calcification contributes to diseases such as chondrocalcinosis, to calcium deposits in the skin or to vascular calcification. SMOC2 is a member of the BM-40/osteonectin family of calcium-binding secreted matricellular proteins. Using osteoprogenitor MC3T3-E1 cells stably overexpressing SMOC2, we show that SMOC2 inhibits osteogenic differentiation and extracellular matrix mineralization. Stable Smoc2 knockdown in these cells had no effect on mineralization suggesting that endogenous SMOC2 is not essential for the mineralization process. Mineralization in MC3T3-E1 cells overexpressing mutant SMOC2 lacking the extracellular calcium-binding domain was significantly increased compared to cells overexpressing full length SMOC2. When SMOC2 overexpressing cells were cultured in the presence of extracellular calcium supplementation, SMOC2’s inhibitory effect on calcification was rescued. Our observations were translationally validated in primary human periosteal-derived cells. Furthermore, SMOC2 was able to impair mineralization in transdifferentiated human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Taken together, our data indicate that SMOC2 can act as an inhibitor of mineralization. We propose a possible role for SMOC2 to prevent calcification disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2808214340,"Patients with liver cirrhosis are susceptible to fungal infections. Due to low sensitivity of culture-based methods, we applied a real-time PCR assay targeting the 18S rRNA gene in combination with direct sequencing and terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) in order to establish a novel tool to detect fungal DNA and to quantify and differentiate Candida DNA, also in polyfungal specimens. In total, 281 samples (blood n = 135, ascites n = 92, duodenal fluid n = 54) from 135 patients with liver cirrhosis and 52 samples (blood n = 26, duodenal fluid n = 26) from 26 control patients were collected prospectively. Candida DNA was quantified in all samples. Standard microbiological culture was performed for comparison. Blood and ascites samples, irrespective of the patient cohort, showed a method-independent low fungal detection rate of approximately 1%, and the Candida DNA content level did not exceed 3.0x10(1) copies ml-1 in any sample. In contrast, in duodenal fluid of patients with liver cirrhosis high fungal detection rates were discovered by using both PCR- and culture-based techniques (81.5% vs. 66.7%; p = 0.123) and the median level of Candida DNA was 3.8x10(5) copies ml-1 (2.3x10(2)-6.3x10(9)). In cirrhosis and controls, fungal positive culture results were confirmed by PCR in 96% and an additional amount of 44% of culture negative duodenal samples were PCR positive. Using T-RFLP analysis in duodenal samples, overall 85% of results from microbial culture were confirmed and in 75% of culture-negative but PCR-positive samples additional Candida species could be identified. In conclusion, PCR-based methods and subsequent differentiation of Candida DNA might offer a quick approach to identifying Candida species without prior cultivation."
https://openalex.org/W2808364546,"Background Obesity is suggested to underlie development of other metabolic aberrations, but longitudinal relationships between metabolic factors at various ages has not been studied in detail. Methods Data from 27,379 men and 32,275 women with in total 122,940 health examinations in the Västerbotten Intervention Project, Sweden and the Vorarlberg Health Monitoring and Prevention Programme, Austria were used to investigate body mass index (BMI), mid-blood pressure, and fasting levels of glucose, triglycerides, and total cholesterol at baseline in relation to 10-year changes of these factors and weight. We included paired examinations performed 10±2 years apart and used them for longitudinal analysis with linear regression of changes between the ages 30 and 40, 40 and 50, or 50 and 60 years. Results Higher levels of BMI were associated with increases in glucose and mid-blood pressure as well as triglycerides levels, and, to a lesser extent, decreases in cholesterol levels. For instance, per 5 kg/m2 higher BMI at age 40, glucose at age 50 increased by 0.24 mmol/l (95%CI: 0.22–0.26) and mid-blood pressure increased by 1.54 mm Hg (95%CI: 1.35–1.74). The strongest association observed was between BMI at age 30 and mid-blood pressure, which was 2.12 mm Hg (95% CI: 1.79–2.45) increase over ten years per 5 kg/m2 higher BMI level. This association was observed at an age when blood pressure levels on average remained stable. Other associations than those with BMI at baseline were much weaker. However, triglyceride levels were associated with future glucose changes among individuals with elevated BMI, particularly in the two older age groups. Conclusion BMI was most indicative of long-term changes in metabolic factors, and the strongest impact was observed for increases in blood pressure between 30 and 40 years of age. Our study supports that lifestyle interventions preventing metabolic aberrations should focus on avoiding weight increases."
https://openalex.org/W2808377749,"Parental consent for the participation of their neonate in neonatal research is influenced by the quality of the information delivered and the interaction between parents and investigators. Failure to provide important information may lead to difficulties in the decision making process of parents. This Delphi survey aims to establish a consensus between parent representatives of neonatal associations and healthcare professionals concerning the information deemed essential by both parties in order to improve the recruitment of neonates into clinical trials.This study was conducted in Europe among parent representatives and healthcare professionals. In this 3-phase study, 96 items were defined by the Scientific Committee (CS), composed of 11 clinicians (from 8 countries) and 1 parent representative of the European network of neonatal associations. Then the Committee of Experts (CE) composed of 16 clinicians were matched by country with 16 national parent representatives and evaluated these items in two rounds. The importance of each item was evaluated by each member of the CE on a scale between 1 and 9 based on their personal experience.Fifty eight items reached the second and final level of consensus. In contrast to clinicians, parent representatives preferred to be informed about the study by the physician in charge of their child. They also favoured additional support during the informed consent process and stated that both parents need to agree and sign.The set of 58 items on which parents and clinicians reached consensus will be helpful to healthcare professionals seeking parental consent for the inclusion of a neonate in a clinical trial. Providing parents with information about the trial by the investigator in the presence of the patient's neonatologist, developing closer contacts with parents and informing them of the available support by parents associations may be helpful for parents."
https://openalex.org/W2808326284,"Objectives: Pupil light reflex (PLR) has been widely used as a method for evaluating parasympathetic activity. The first aim of the present study is to develop a PLR measurement using a computer screen set-up and compare its results with the PLR generated by a more conventional setup using light-emitting diode (LED). The parasympathetic nervous system, which is known to control the ‘rest and digest’ response of the human body, is considered to be associated with daily life fatigue. However, only few studies have attempted to test the relationship between self-reported daily fatigue and physiological measurement of the parasympathetic nervous system. Therefore, the second aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between daily-life fatigue, assessed using the Need for Recovery scale, and parasympathetic activity, as indicated by the PLR parameters.
Design: A pilot study was conducted first to develop a PLR measurement set-up using a computer screen. PLRs evoked by light stimuli with different characteristics were recorded to confirm the influence of light intensity, flash duration, and color on the PLRs evoked by the system. In the subsequent experimental study, we recorded the PLR of 25 adult participants to light flashes generated by the screen set-up as well as by a conventional LED set-up. PLR parameters relating to parasympathetic and sympathetic activity were calculated from the pupil responses. We tested the split-half reliability across two consecutive blocks of trials, and the relationships between the parameters of PLRs evoked by the two set-ups. Participants rated their need for recovery prior to the PLR recordings.
Results: PLR parameters acquired in the screen and LED set-ups showed good reliability for amplitude related parameters. The PLRs evoked by both set-ups were consistent, but showed systematic differences in absolute values of all parameters. Additionally, higher need for recovery was associated with faster and larger constriction of the PLR.
Conclusions: This study assessed the PLR generated by a computer screen and the PLR generated by a LED. The good reliability within set-ups and the consistency between the PLRs evoked by the set-ups indicate that both systems provides a valid way to evoke the PLR. A higher need for recovery was associated with faster and larger constricting PLRs, suggesting increased levels of parasympathetic nervous system activity in people experiencing higher levels of need for recovery on a daily basis."
https://openalex.org/W2808411812,"Managing the disturbance of visitors due to crowding is an important management task in protected areas with high use levels. To achieve this, managers need to know how the use level affects the perceived disturbance due to crowding. Here we present a method to predict the level of disturbance as a function of use level measured by number of visitors. In contrast to the visual approach where subjects are asked to evaluate acceptability of use levels from manipulated images of scenery, our approach uses data gathered from actual experiences: actual (measured) use levels and concurrent on-site data on levels of disturbance experienced by visitors. Using the example of Nature Park Telašćica, we show how these data can be acquired with limited resources (a smart-phone and short, time-stamped questionnaires), and demonstrate the subsequent analysis and model fitting. The resulting model estimates the probability that a visitor experiencing a given use level will report certain level of disturbance. We suggest a way of using the probability density functions to define an inherent limit of acceptable disturbance (LAD) due to crowding; the LAD can also be set to a desired value by management. Regardless of the definition, LAD can be used to determine the maximum acceptable use level as dictated by crowding considerations. The method gives predictions consistent with previous literature and can be used even when data are collected at low use levels."
https://openalex.org/W2808249568,"The emergence of food production during the earliest Neolithic of the Near East was accompanied by profound changes in the ways in which societies were organized. Elaborate and multi-stage mortuary practices involving the removal, caching, and plastering of symbolically charged skulls are thought to have played an important role in cross-cutting household lines to integrate communities and maintain social cohesion during the late tenth to ninth millennium cal BP, particularly in Middle Pre-Pottery Neolithic B settlements located in the southern Levant. While the ritual and mortuary activities associated with skull manipulation were dramatic and high impact occasions that drew people and households together, it is likely they were highly episodic and, consequently, attendant community cohesion susceptible to decay over time. Recent research in southern Jordan, where skull plastering was not practiced as seen elsewhere in the southern Levant, has revealed that non-residential building structures were a common feature of early Pre-Pottery Neolithic settlements. Renewed excavations at Beidha, a Middle PPNB settlement located in the Shara’a mountains, have revealed a large, easily accessible communal structure that provided a focal point in which mundane, informal daily activities could regularly take place. The routine and repeated interactions fostered by such non-domestic structures facilitated highly durable modes of community cohesion and was part of a temporally deep ethos of community that first emerged a thousand years earlier when people first began to experiment with plant cultivation. It appears that in southern Jordan, a distinctive social cohesion pathway developed that engaged community daily practice within non-residential buildings to maintain and strengthen social structures, rather than occasional and dramatic ritual and mortuary practices used elsewhere in the southern Levant."
https://openalex.org/W2807830632,"Conservation payments are increasingly advocated as a way to meet both social and ecological objectives, particularly in developing countries, but these payments often fail to reach the 'right' individuals. The Government of Bangladesh runs a food compensation scheme that aims to contribute to hilsa (Tenualosa ilisha) conservation by improving the socioeconomic situation of households affected by hilsa sanctuary fishing bans. Analysing data from a household survey of compensation recipients and non-recipients, we identify the current correlates of compensation distribution and explore perceptions of fairness in this distribution. We find that distribution is largely spatial rather than based on the household characteristics that are supposed to determine eligibility for compensation, indicating political influence in the distribution process. We also find the compensation scheme is widely perceived to be unfair, which could be undermining its potential to compensate vulnerable fishers while improving compliance with fishing bans. The spatial distribution of compensation would shift substantially under alternative targeting scenarios that are likely to improve the cost-effectiveness of the scheme, such as targeting those who are most dependent on fishing for their livelihood. This study highlights a challenge for conservation payment schemes that aim to achieve the dual objectives of poverty reduction and ecological sustainability, particularly large-scale public schemes, and suggests that more effective targeting and transparency about the basis of payment distribution are prerequisites for schemes to be both cost-effective and socially acceptable."

Clinically available therapeutics for radiation-induced vascular injury are largely supportive. PKCδ was identified as a critical regulator of the inflammatory response, and its inhibition was shown to protect critical organs during sepsis. We used a novel biomimetic microfluidic assay (bMFA) to interrogate the role of PKCδ in radiation-induced neutrophil-endothelial cell interaction and endothelial cell function. HUVECs formed a complete lumen in bMFA and were treated with 0.5, 2, or 5 Gy ionizing radiation (IR). At 24 h post-IR, the cells were treated with a PKCδ inhibitor for an additional 24 h. Under physiologic shear flow, the role of PKCδ on endothelium function and neutrophil adherence/migration was determined. PKCδ inhibition dramatically attenuated IR-induced endothelium permeability increase and significantly decreased neutrophil migration across IR-treated endothelial cells. Moreover, neutrophil adhesion to irradiated endothelial cells was significantly decreased after PKCδ inhibition in a flow-dependent manner. PKCδ inhibition downregulated IR-induced P-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule 1, and VCAM-1 but not E-selectin overexpression. PKCδ is an important regulator of neutrophil-endothelial cell interaction post-IR, and its inhibition can serve as a potential radiation medical countermeasure.—Soroush, F., Tang, Y., Zaidi, H.

https://openalex.org/W2808236084,"Hepatic irradiation for the treatment of hepatobiliary malignancies often indirectly damages liver tissue and promotes the development of liver fibrosis. However, little is known concerning the effects of hepatic irradiation on the liver immune system, including natural killer (NK) cells. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate how hepatic irradiation influences the functions and characteristics of liver resident NK cells. An established murine hepatic irradiation model was used to examine the specific effects of hepatic irradiation on immune cell populations and metastasis. This analysis demonstrated that hepatic irradiation decreased the number of liver resident NK cells (DX5-TRAIL+), but did not affect the total NK number or proportions of NK cells in the liver or spleen. This effect was correlated with the hepatic irradiation dose. Surprisingly, the liver resident NK population had not recovered by two months after hepatic irradiation. We also found that hepatic irradiation limited the cytotoxic effects of liver-derived lymphocytes against a mouse hepatoma cell line and promoted hepatic metastases in an in vivo model, although adoptive transfer of activated NK cells could alleviate metastatic growth. Finally, we demonstrated that hepatic irradiation disrupted the development of liver-resident NK cells, even after the adoptive transfer of precursor cells from the bone marrow, liver, and spleen, suggesting that irradiation had altered the developmental environment of the liver. In summary, our data demonstrated that hepatic irradiation abolished the DX5-TRAIL+ liver-resident NK cell population and dampened antitumor activities in the liver for at least two months. Additionally, hepatic irradiation prevented differentiation of precursor cells into liver-resident NK cells."
https://openalex.org/W2808312281,"This paper describes the skeletal carbonate mineralogy of 156 bryozoan species collected from Scotland (sourced both from museum collections and from waters around Scotland) and collated from literature. This collection represents 79% of the species which inhabit Scottish waters and is a greater number and proportion of extant species than any previous regional study. The study is also of significance globally where the data augment the growing database of mineralogical analyses and offers first analyses for 26 genera and four families. Specimens were collated through a combination of field sampling and existing collections and were analysed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and micro-XRD to determine wt% MgCO3 in calcite and wt% aragonite. Species distribution data and phylogenetic organisation were applied to understand distributional, taxonomic and phylo-mineralogical patterns. Analysis of the skeletal composition of Scottish bryozoans shows that the group is statistically different from neighbouring Arctic fauna but features a range of mineralogy comparable to other temperate regions. As has been previously reported, cyclostomes feature low Mg in calcite and very little aragonite, whereas cheilostomes show much more variability, including bimineralic species. Scotland is a highly variable region, open to biological and environmental influx from all directions, and bryozoans exhibit this in the wide range of within-species mineralogical variability they present. This plasticity in skeletal composition may be driven by a combination of environmentally-induced phenotypic variation, or physiological factors. A flexible response to environment, as manifested in a wide range of skeletal mineralogy within a species, may be one characteristic of successful invasive bryozoans."

Considering that preantral follicles represent the main ovarian reserve, harvesting of these follicles is crucial for the development/use of assisted reproductive techniques. Therefore, knowledge on follicle spatial distribution can be helpful for targeting areas with richer number of preantral follicles through biopsy procedures. The aim of this study was to assess the distribution and localization of equine preantral follicles according to: (i) age, (ii) ovarian portion (lateral and intermediary) and region (dorsal and ventral), (iii) distance from the geometric center, and (iv) follicular class. Ovaries from young and old mares (n = 8) were harvested in a slaughterhouse and submitted to histological processing for further evaluation. For data analyses, a novel methodology was developed according to the geometric center of each histological section for a precise determination of preantral follicle distribution. Results indicated that (i) equine preantral follicles are clustered and located near to the ovarian geometric center, and that aging induced their dispersion through the ovarian cortex; (ii) the distance from the geometric center was shorter for developing follicles than primordial; and (iii) secondary follicles were more distant from the geometric center but closer to the ovulation fossa. In conclusion, the spatial distribution of preantral follicles was successfully determined in the equine ovary and was affected by age, region, and portion."
https://openalex.org/W2807849046,"The purpose was to examine and compare the effects of replacing time spent sitting with standing at work on fat-free mass, fat mass and waist circumference using isotemporal substitution. Analyses were conducted on work hours on both cross-sectional and longitudinal data. The study included 223 persons from an intervention study aimed at reducing sitting time at work among office employees. Sitting, standing and anthropometry were measured objectively. Cross-sectional isotemporal substitution analyses were modelled on baseline data, while longitudinal analyses were modelled based on differences in sitting and standing time at work between baseline and 1-month follow-up in relation to differences in anthropometric measures between baseline and 3-months follow-up. Replacing one hour of sitting time with one hour of standing was associated with a 0.21 kg higher fat-free mass in the longitudinal analysis and 0.95 kg in the cross-sectional analysis. Fat mass was 0.32 kg lower in the longitudinal analysis and 0.61 kg lower in the cross-sectional analysis. Waist circumference decreased by 0.38 cm in the longitudinal analysis and 0.81 cm in the cross-sectional analysis. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses showed an effect on body composition measures by replacing one hour of sitting with standing however, this effect was largest in the cross-sectional analyses.

Alerted by these findings, a follow up survey was conducted in 2015 to further assess the trend of IMR.We used the same preceding-birth technique as in previous surveys to estimate IMR and neonatal mortality rate (NMR) per 1000 live births. All multiparous mothers who came to the 22 UNRWA health centers to register their last-born child for immunization were asked if their preceding child was alive or dead. We based our target sample size on the previous IMR of 22.4 and we interviewed 3126 mothers from September to November 2015.The third survey estimated mortality rates in 2013. The IMR was 22.7 (95% CI 17.2-28.1) per 1000 live births. IMR did not decline since the estimated IMR of 20.2 (15.3-25.1) per 1000 live births in 2006 and 22.4 (16.4-28.3) per 1000 live births in 2011. NMR was 16.1 (11.6-20.7) per 1000 live births, which was not statistically significantly different from 2006 (12.1 (8.7-16.4)), and was lower than in 2011 (20.3 (15.3-26.2)).The estimated mortality rate in infants of Palestine refugees in Gaza has not declined since 2006. The stagnation of infant mortality rates indicates that further efforts are needed to investigate causes for this stagnation and ways of addressing the potentially preventable causes among Palestine refugee children in Gaza."
https://openalex.org/W2808710459,"Semiochemicals that elicit species-specific attraction or repulsion have proven useful in the management of terrestrial pests and hold considerable promise for control of nuisance aquatic species, particularly invasive fishes. Because aquatic ecosystems are typically large and open, use of a semiochemical to control a spatially dispersed invader will require the development of a cost-effective emitter that is easy to produce, environmentally benign, inexpensive, and controls the release of the semiochemical without altering its structure. We examined the release properties of five polymers, and chose polyethylene glycol (PEG) as the best alternative. In a series of laboratory and field experiments, we examined the response of the invasive sea lamprey to PEG, and to a partial sex pheromone emitted from PEG that has proven effective as a trap bait to capture migrating sea lamprey prior to spawning. Our findings confirm that the sea lamprey does not behaviorally respond to PEG, and that the attractant response to the pheromone component was conserved when emitted from PEG. Further, we deployed the pheromone-PEG emitters as trap bait during typical control operations in three Great Lakes tributaries, observing similar improvements in trap performance when compared to a previous study using mechanically pumped liquid pheromone. Finally, the polymer emitters tended to dissolve unevenly in high flow conditions. We demonstrate that housing the emitter stabilizes the dissolution rate at high water velocity. We conclude the performance characteristics of PEG emitters to achieve controlled-release of a semiochemical are sufficient to recommend its use in conservation and management activities related to native and invasive aquatic organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2807963206,"The thymectomy specimens from the “thymectomy trial in non-thymomatous myasthenia gravis patients receiving prednisone therapy” (MGTX) underwent rigid and comprehensive work-up, which permits analysis of the spatial distribution of histological and immunohistological features. This analysis revealed strong intra- and inter-case variability. While many histological features (e.g. median percent fat content among different specimens) can easily be correlated with clinical parameters, intra-case spatial variability of histological features has yet defied quantification and statistical evaluation. To overcome this gap in digital pathology, we here propose intra-case entropy of measured histological features in all available slides of a given thymectomy specimen as a quantitative marker of spatial histological heterogeneity. Calculation of entropy led to one value per specimen and histological feature. Through these ‘entropy values’ the so far neglected degree of spatial histological heterogeneity could be fed into statistical analyses, extending the scope of clinico-pathological correlations."
https://openalex.org/W2808582502,"In a self-paced reading study on German sluicing, Paape (Paape, 2016) found that reading times were shorter at the ellipsis site when the antecedent was a temporarily ambiguous garden-path structure. As a post-hoc explanation of this finding, Paape assumed that the antecedent’s memory representation was reactivated during syntactic reanalysis, making it easier to retrieve. In two eye tracking experiments, we subjected the reactivation hypothesis to further empirical scrutiny. Experiment 1, carried out in French, showed no evidence in favor in the reactivation hypothesis. Instead, results for one out of the three types of garden-path sentences that were tested suggest that subjects sometimes failed to resolve the temporary ambiguity in the antecedent clause, and subsequently failed to resolve the ellipsis. The results of Experiment 2, a conceptual replication of Paape’s (Paape, 2016) original study carried out in German, are compatible with the reactivation hypothesis, but leave open the possibility that the observed speedup for ambiguous antecedents may be due to occasional retrievals of an incorrect structure."
https://openalex.org/W2808676376,"Parasites of fishes have been shown to be effective bioindicators of the aquatic environment. Few investigations have been conducted on ectoparasite models and therefore little is known about the fate of trace elements and metals which they accumulate. In this study trace element sequestration was observed in the carapace of the fish louse, Argulus japonicus and found to relate to the sex of the parasite, as well as, the degree of sclerotization of the carapace. Adults of A. japonicus were collected from cyprinid hosts in the Vaal Dam, South Africa. Parasites were removed and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen before being sectioned with a cryomicrotome. Sections and whole mounts of parasites were prepared and treated with Phen–Green TM FL cell–permeant diacetate. Cryosections were assessed for trace elements and metals using a scanning electron microscope equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy. Results indicated that in both male and female parasites, trace elements become bound to the carapace and produce more intense fluorescence than in soft tissues. Sexual dimorphic differences were further observed between male and female parasites. The intensity of the fluorescence signals was greater in the carapace of male parasites than in females, particularly when comparing the carapace of the ventral side of the thorax. In females, an amorphous layer of material surrounding the eggs was observed and produced an intense fluorescent signal. Levels of trace elements and metals detected were not significantly different between male and female parasites. Results observed serve as a demonstration for the first time of trace element sequestration in a freshwater crustacean parasite and possible mechanisms employed to reduce body burdens of trace elements and metals."
https://openalex.org/W2808375614,"Background Decisions regarding which vaccines are funded in the United Kingdom (UK) are increasingly informed by cost-effectiveness analyses. Such analyses use Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) as a measure of effectiveness and assume that QALYs are equal regardless of where and in whom they occur in the population. However, there is increasing debate about whether this QALY approach is appropriate and whether societal preferences for childhood vaccinations should be used to help inform childhood immunisation policy. Objective To gauge the general public’s preferences for prioritising certain characteristics of childhood vaccination, to help inform future policy making decisions in the UK. Design Qualitative design using individual face-to-face interviews, with data analysed using an inductive thematic framework approach. Setting Two counties in England, UK. Population Adult members of the general public were recruited using the Bristol and South Gloucestershire open electoral registers, using gender and deprivation quotas for each area. Participants 21 members of the public participated in qualitative interviews. Results The qualitative research identified three major themes and several key attributes that influences participant’s opinions about priority setting for childhood vaccinations: (1) population segment (i.e. age group, carer impact and social group), (2) vaccine preventable diseases preferences (i.e. disease severity, disease incidence and declining infection) and (3) risks and benefits associated with childhood vaccinations (i.e. vaccine associated side-effects, herd protection and peace of mind). Conclusion Evidence from this qualitative study suggests that some members of the UK general public have more nuanced views than the health-maximisation approach when considering how childhood vaccines should be prioritised. This is not necessarily captured by the current economic approaches for assessing the benefits from childhood vaccinations in the UK, but is an important area for future research to ensure appropriate decision making."

These activity pattern categories often influence the methodological approaches employed, including the temporal period of study (daylight or nighttime). We evaluated banded mongoose (Mungos mungo) behavior in Northern Botswana through the use of remote sensing cameras at active den sites in order to characterize early morning behavior for this diurnal species. Our approach, however, provided the facility to capture unexpected nocturnal activity in a species that had otherwise only been studied during daylight hours. Camera traps were deployed for 215 trap days (24 hour data capture period) at den sites, capturing 5,472 photos over all events. Nocturnal activity was identified in 3% of trap days at study den sites with both vigilant and non-vigilant nocturnal behaviors identified. While vigilant behaviors involved troop fleeing responses, observations of non-vigilant behaviors suggest nonresident mongoose may investigate den sites of other troops during nocturnal time periods. There was no association between the occurrence of nocturnal activity and lunar phase (Fisher’s exact test, n = 215, p = 0.638) and thus, increased moonlight was not identified as a factor influencing nocturnal behavior. The drivers and fitness consequences of these nocturnal activities remain uncertain and present intriguing areas for future research. Our findings highlight the need for ecological studies to more explicitly address and evaluate the potential for temporal variability in activity periods. Modifying our approach and embracing variation in wildlife activity patterns might provide new insights into the interaction between ecological phenomenon and species biology that spans the diurnal–nocturnal spectrum."
https://openalex.org/W2808108835,"Several auditory-based feedback devices have been developed to improve the quality of ventilation performance during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), but their effectiveness has not been proven in actual CPR situations. In the present study, we investigated the effectiveness of visual flashlight guidance in maintaining high-quality ventilation performance. We conducted a simulation-based, randomized, parallel trial including 121 senior medical students. All participants were randomized to perform ventilation during 2 minutes of CPR with or without flashlight guidance. For each participant, we measured mean ventilation rate as a primary outcome and ventilation volume, inspiration velocity, and ventilation interval as secondary outcomes using a computerized device system. Mean ventilation rate did not significantly differ between flashlight guidance and control groups (P = 0.159), but participants in the flashlight guidance group exhibited significantly less variation in ventilation rate than participants in the control group (P<0.001). Ventilation interval was also more regular among participants in the flashlight guidance group. Our results demonstrate that flashlight guidance is effective in maintaining a constant ventilation rate and interval. If confirmed by further studies in clinical practice, flashlight guidance could be expected to improve the quality of ventilation performed during CPR."
https://openalex.org/W2808195284,"Back pain is a serious medical problem especially for those people sitting over long periods during their daily work. Here we present a system to help users monitoring and examining their sitting behavior. The Virtual-Spine Platform (VSP) is an integrated system consisting of a real-time body position monitoring module and a data visualization module to provide individualized, immediate, and accurate sitting behavior support. It provides a comprehensive spine movement analysis as well as accumulated data visualization to demonstrate behavior patterns within a certain period. The two modules are discussed in detail focusing on the design of the VSP system with adequate capacity for continuous monitoring and a web-based interactive data analysis method to visualize and compare the sitting behavior of different persons. The data was collected in an experiment with a small group of subjects. Using this method, the behavior of five subjects was evaluated over a working day, enabling inferences and suggestions for sitting improvements. The results from the accumulated data module were used to elucidate the basic function of body position recognition of the VSP. Finally, an expert user study was conducted to evaluate VSP and support future developments."
https://openalex.org/W2808221160,"Recent findings of mosaicism (DNA sequence variation) challenge the dogma that each person has a stable genetic constitution. Copy number variations, point mutations and chromosome abnormalities in normal or diseased tissues have been described. We studied normal skin mosaicism of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) [rs1426654, p.Thr111Ala] in SLC24A5, an ion transporter gene. This SNP is unusual in that more than 90% of people of European descent have homozygous germline A/A alleles, while more than 90% of East Asians and Blacks have homozygous germline G/G alleles. We found mosaicism in neonatal foreskins as well as in 69% of nearly 600 skin surface scraping samples from 114 donors of different ages. Strikingly, donors with germline (buccal or blood) A/A, A/G or G/G genotypes had all three sequences (A/A, A/G or G/G) in the skin surface scrapings. SNP sequence differences extended within the epidermis in the vertical dimension from basal cell layer to the stratum corneum at the surface, as well as across the two-dimensions of the skin surface. Furthermore, repeated scrapings in the same location revealed variation in the sequences in the same individuals over time, adding a fourth dimension to this variation. We then used this mosaicism to track the movement of epidermal cells during normal differentiation and characterize the patterning of epidermal cells during terminal differentiation. In this coordinated proliferation model of epidermal differentiation, the skin surface is alternatively populated by synchronous, cycling of waves of cells, with each group having a different DNA sequence. These groups of cells abruptly flatten into large sheets at the surface providing patches of uniform SNP sequence. This four-dimensional mosaicism is a normal, previously unrecognized form of dynamic mosaicism in human skin."
https://openalex.org/W2807895561,"Deep waters of the South Pacific off northern Chile remain poorly studied, particularly in regard to invertebrate faunas. Some recent works include new records on deep-water species, mostly from the bycatch of benthic fisheries concentrated along the continental margin of the country. Among these, a few specimens of an unidentified bathylasmatine balanomorph were collected off Caldera, northern Chile, and they are described here as Bathylasma chilense sp. nov. While this is the second report of a bathylasmatid in the Eastern Pacific Ocean, the first being Tetrachaelasma southwardi Newman & Ross, 1971, it is not only the first but the deepest known (1800-2000 m) species of Bathylasma. Its discovery increases the number of described Bathylasma species to eight, four of which are extant. This is the third deep-water balanomorph cirriped recorded for the region where it may represent an isolate from a West Wind Drift fauna, an immigrant from the western Pacific, or a relict of a once cosmopolitan Paleocene-Eocene fauna now having an amphitropical component."
https://openalex.org/W2807736469,"This study provides an engineering approach for designing an aquaculture cage system for use in constructed channel flow environments. As sustainable aquaculture has grown globally, many novel techniques have been introduced such as those implemented in the global Atlantic salmon industry. The advent of several highly sophisticated analysis software systems enables the development of such novel engineering techniques. These software systems commonly include three-dimensional (3D) drafting, computational fluid dynamics, and finite element analysis. In this study, a combination of these analysis tools is applied to evaluate a conceptual aquaculture system for potential deployment in a power plant effluent channel. The channel is supposedly clean; however, it includes elevated water temperatures and strong currents. The first portion of the analysis includes the design of a fish cage system with specific net solidities using 3D drafting techniques. Computational fluid dynamics is then applied to evaluate the flow reduction through the system from the previously generated solid models. Implementing the same solid models, a finite element analysis is performed on the critical components to assess the material stresses produced by the drag force loads that are calculated from the fluid velocities."
https://openalex.org/W2807849599,"Conditioned place preference (CPP) tests in rodents have been well established to measure preference induced by secondary reinforcing properties, but conventional assays are not sensitive enough to measure innate, weak preference, or the primary reinforcing property of a conditioned stimulus. We designed a novel CPP assay with better sensitivity and efficiency in quantifying and ranking preference of particular sounds among multiple alternatives. Each test tone was presented according to the location of free-moving rats in the arena, where assignment of location to each tone changed in every 20-s session. We demonstrated that our assay was able to rank tone preference among 4 alternatives within 12.5 min (125 s (habituation) + 25 s/sessions × 25 sessions). In order to measure and rank sound preference, we attempted to use sojourn times with each test sound ([Formula: see text]), and a preference index (PI) based on transition matrices of initial and end sounds in every session. Both [Formula: see text] and PI revealed similar trends of innate preference in which rats preferred test conditions in the following order: silence, 40-, 20-, then 10-kHz tones. Further, rats exhibited a change in preference after an classical conditioning of the 20-kHz tone with a rewarding microstimulation of the dopaminergic system. We also demonstrated that PI was a more robust and sensitive indicator than [Formula: see text] when the locomotion activity level of rats became low due to habituation to the assay repeated over sessions. Thus, our assay offers a novel method of evaluating auditory preference that is superior to conventional CPP assays, offering promising prospects in the field of sensory neuroscience."
https://openalex.org/W2807863524,"Seasonal influenza is a contagious respiratory illness that annually affects millions of people worldwide. To identify currently circulating influenza virus subtypes, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's International Reagent Resource distributes the World Health Organization (WHO) influenza reagent kits, which are used globally by testing laboratories for influenza surveillance. The data generated by the kits aid in strain selection for the influenza vaccine each season. The use of animals to produce high quality and quantities of antibodies is critical to the production of these kits. In this study, we assessed the effects and efficacy of repeated sampling from automated plasmapheresis in goats. Analysis of blood samples demonstrated that repeated automated plasmapheresis procedures did not adversely affect the immediate or long-term health of goats. Further, our results indicate that repeated plasmapheresis in goats was capable of generating 2 liters of antibody-rich plasma per goat per week. This volume is sufficient to produce enough WHO influenza kits to conduct over 1 million tests. Thus, we have shown that the rapid production of plasma in goats can positively impact the public health preparedness and response to influenza."
https://openalex.org/W2808569218,"Plectromacronema Ulmer 1906 is a Neotropical genus recorded sparsely from South of Mexico to the North of Argentina. The genus is placed within the Macronematinae sub-family, members of which are relatively large among the Trichoptera and bears conspicuous wing ornamentations. There are only two species recorded for Brazil, Plectromacronema comptum Ulmer 1906 and Plectromacronema subfuscum (Banks 1920). Plectromacronema lisae Flint 1983 recorded for Mexico and Costa Rica is the only species in the genus with immature stages described. Immature stages species level identification is required for water quality biomonitoring and most of the Trichoptera taxonomy is based only on adult male genitalia. In this paper, we propose a new species, Plectromacronema solaris sp.nov., larva, pupa, and adult. Aspects of the life history of the new species are also discussed. This record also represents a new genus record for the state of Minas Gerais, extending the knowledge on the diversity, distribution, biogeography, and biology of this remarkable genus."
