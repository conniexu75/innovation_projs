https://openalex.org/W1995398218,Adipocyte differentiation is an important component of obesity and other metabolic diseases. This process is strongly inhibited by many mitogens and oncogenes. Several growth factors that inhibit fat cell differentiation caused mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase-mediated phosphorylation of the dominant adipogenic transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and reduction of its transcriptional activity. Expression of PPARγ with a nonphosphorylatable mutation at this site (serine-112) yielded cells with increased sensitivity to ligand-induced adipogenesis and resistance to inhibition of differentiation by mitogens. These results indicate that covalent modification of PPARγ by serum and growth factors is a major regulator of the balance between cell growth and differentiation in the adipose cell lineage.
https://openalex.org/W1984536659,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling was analyzed in mammalian cells conditionally defective for receptor-mediated endocytosis. EGF-dependent cell proliferation was enhanced in endocytosis-defective cells. However, early EGF-dependent signaling events were not uniformly up-regulated. A subset of signal transducers required the normal endocytic trafficking of EGFR for full activation. Thus, endocytic trafficking of activated EGFR plays a critical role not only in attenuating EGFR signaling but also in establishing and controlling specific signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2022614447,"The fundamental event in prion diseases seems to be a conformational change in cellular prion protein (PrPC) whereby it is converted into the pathologic isoform PrPSc. In fatal familial insomnia (FFI), the protease-resistant fragment of PrPSc after deglycosylation has a size of 19 kilodaltons, whereas that from other inherited and sporadic prion diseases is 21 kilodaltons. Extracts from the brains of FFI patients transmitted disease to transgenic mice expressing a chimeric human-mouse PrP gene about 200 days after inoculation and induced formation of the 19-kilodalton PrPSc fragment, whereas extracts from the brains of familial and sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease patients produced the 21-kilodalton PrPSc fragment in these mice. The results presented indicate that the conformation of PrPSc functions as a template in directing the formation of nascent PrPSc and suggest a mechanism to explain strains of prions where diversity is encrypted in the conformation of PrPSc."
https://openalex.org/W2003647281,"Resistance to bacterial speck disease in tomato occurs when the Pto kinase in the plant responds to expression of the avirulence gene avrPto in the Pseudomonas pathogen. Transient expression of an avrPto transgene in plant cells containing Pto elicited a defense response. In the yeast two-hybrid system, the Pto kinase physically interacted with AvrPto. Alterations of AvrPto or Pto that disrupted the interaction in yeast also abolished disease resistance in plants. The physical interaction of AvrPto and Pto provides an explanation of gene-for-gene specificity in bacterial speck disease resistance."

This catalytic system utilizes oxygen or air as the ultimate, stoichiometric oxidant, producing water as the only by-product."
https://openalex.org/W2041988832,"Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was detected in morphologically normal lobules adjacent to breast cancers. The most frequent aberration was at chromosome 3p22-25; of ten cases with this LOH in the carcinoma, six displayed the same LOH in adjacent normal lobules. This suggests that in a subset of sporadic breast cancers, a tumor suppresser gene at 3p22-25 may be important in initiation or early progression of tumorigenesis. Among sixteen breast cancers with LOH at 17p13.1 and five breast cancers with LOH at 11p15.5, one case each displayed the same LOH in adjacent normal lobules. Thus the molecular heterogeneity that characterizes invasive breast cancers may occur at the earliest detectable stages of progression."
https://openalex.org/W1972857786,Transient expression of the Pseudomonas syringae avirulence gene avrPto in plant cells resulted in a Pto -dependent necrosis. The AvrPto avirulence protein was observed to interact directly with the Pto resistance protein in the yeast two-hybrid system. Mutations in the Pto and avrPto genes which reduce in vivo activity had parallel effects on association in the two-hybrid assay. These data suggest that during infection the pathogen delivers AvrPto into the plant host cell and that resistance is specified by direct interaction of Pto with AvrPto.
https://openalex.org/W2121339588,"Disruptions in mushroom body (MB) or central complex (CC) brain structures impair Drosophila associative olfactory learning. Perturbations in adenosine 3′,5′ monophosphate signaling also disrupt learning. To integrate these observations, expression of a constitutively activated stimulatory heterotrimeric guanosine triphosphate-binding protein α subunit (Gα s *) was targeted to these brain structures. The ability to associate odors with electroshock was abolished when Gα s * was targeted to MB, but not CC, structures, whereas sensorimotor responses to these stimuli remained normal. Expression of Gα s * did not affect gross MB morphology, and wild-type Gα s expression did not affect learning. Thus, olfactory learning depends on regulated G s signaling in Drosophila MBs."
https://openalex.org/W2030973999,"The crystal structure of an unmodified hammerhead RNA in the absence of divalent metal ions has been solved, and it was shown that this ribozyme can cleave itself in the crystal when divalent metal ions are added. This biologically active RNA fold is the same as that found previously for two modified hammerhead ribozymes. Addition of divalent cations at low pH makes it possible to capture the uncleaved RNA in metal-bound form. A conformational intermediate, having an additional Mg(II) bound to the cleavage-site phosphate, was captured by freeze-trapping the RNA at an active pH prior to cleavage. The most significant conformational changes were limited to the active site of the ribozyme, and the changed conformation requires only small additional movements to reach a proposed transition-state."
https://openalex.org/W1975748795,"Cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP)-dependent protein kinases (cGKs) mediate cellular signaling induced by nitric oxide and cGMP. Mice deficient in the type II cGK were resistant to Escherichia coli STa, an enterotoxin that stimulates cGMP accumulation and intestinal fluid secretion. The cGKII-deficient mice also developed dwarfism that was caused by a severe defect in endochondral ossification at the growth plates. These results indicate that cGKII plays a central role in diverse physiological processes."
https://openalex.org/W2075963617,"The administration of antigens in soluble form can induce antigen-specific immune tolerance and suppress experimental autoimmune diseases. In a marmoset model of multiple sclerosis induced by myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), marmosets tolerized to MOG were protected against acute disease, but after tolerization treatment a lethal demyelinating disorder emerged. In these animals, MOG-specific T cell proliferative responses were transiently suppressed, cytokine production was shifted from a T helper type 1 (T H 1) to a T H 2 pattern, and titers of autoantibodies to MOG were enhanced. Thus, immune deviation can increase concentrations of pathogenic autoantibodies and in some circumstances exacerbate autoimmune disease."
https://openalex.org/W2077449764,"The products of the Rag1 and Rag2 genes drive genomic V(D)J rearrangements that assemble functional immunoglobulin and T cell antigen receptor genes. Expression of the Rag genes has been thought to be limited to developmentally immature lymphocyte populations that in normal adult animals are primarily restricted to the bone marrow and thymus. Abundant RAG1 and RAG2 protein and messenger RNA was detected in the activated B cells that populate murine splenic and Peyer's patch germinal centers. Germinal center B cells thus share fundamental characteristics of immature lymphocytes, raising the possibility that antigen-dependent secondary V(D)J rearrangements modify the peripheral antibody repertoire."
https://openalex.org/W2049685850,"Interfacially active block copolymer amphiphiles have been synthesized and their self-assembly into micelles in supercritical carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) has been demonstrated with small-angle neutron scattering (SANS). These materials establish the design criteria for molecularly engineered surfactants that can stabilize and disperse otherwise insoluble matter into a CO 2 continuous phase. Polystyrene- b -poly(1,1-dihydroperfluorooctyl acrylate) copolymers self-assembled into polydisperse core-shell-type micelles as a result of the disparate solubility characteristics of the different block segments in CO 2 . These nonionic surfactants for CO 2 were shown by SANS to be capable of emulsifying up to 20 percent by weight of a CO 2 -insoluble hydrocarbon into CO 2 . This result demonstrates the efficacy of surfactant-modified CO 2 in reducing the large volumes of organic and halogenated solvent waste streams released into our environment by solvent-intensive manufacturing and process industries."
https://openalex.org/W1964285407,"The human Kv1.5 potassium channel (hKv1.5) contains proline-rich sequences identical to those that bind to Src homology 3 (SH3) domains. Direct association of the Src tyrosine kinase with cloned hKv1.5 and native hKv1.5 in human myocardium was observed. This interaction was mediated by the proline-rich motif of hKv1.5 and the SH3 domain of Src. Furthermore, hKv1.5 was tyrosine phosphorylated, and the channel current was suppressed, in cells coexpressing v-Src. These results provide direct biochemical evidence for a signaling complex composed of a potassium channel and a protein tyrosine kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2030758065,"Genetic footprinting was used to assess the phenotypic effects of Ty1 transposon insertions in 268 predicted genes of chromosome V of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. When seven selection protocols were used, Ty1 insertions in more than half the genes tested (157 of 268) were found to result in a detectable reduction in fitness. Results could not be obtained for fewer than 3 percent of the genes tested (7 of 268). Previously known mutant phenotypes were confirmed, and, for about 30 percent of the genes, new mutant phenotypes were identified."
https://openalex.org/W2006941404,"Enoyl reductase (ENR), an enzyme involved in fatty acid biosynthesis, is the target for antibacterial diazaborines and the front-line antituberculosis drug isoniazid. Analysis of the structures of complexes of Escherichia coli ENR with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and either thienodiazaborine or benzodiazaborine revealed the formation of a covalent bond between the 2' hydroxyl of the nicotinamide ribose and a boron atom in the drugs to generate a tight, noncovalently bound bisubstrate analog. This analysis has implications for the structure-based design of inhibitors of ENR, and similarities to other oxidoreductases suggest that mimicking this molecular linkage may have generic applications in other areas of medicinal chemistry."
https://openalex.org/W1966866685,"Recombination activating genes (RAG-1 and RAG-2), involved in V(D)J rearrangement of immunoglobulin genes, have been thought to be expressed only in immature stages of B-cell development. However, RAG-1 and RAG-2 transcripts were found to be reexpressed in mature mouse B cells after culture with interleukin-4 in association with several different co-stimuli. Reexpression was also detected in draining lymph nodes from immunized mice. RAG-1 and RAG-2 proteins could be detected by immunofluorescence microscopy in the nuclei of B cells cultured in vitro and in the germinal centers of draining lymph nodes. These findings suggest that RAG gene products play a heretofore unsuspected role in mature B cells."
https://openalex.org/W1967592183,"In Drosophila embryos, germ cell formation is induced by specialized cytoplasm at the posterior of the egg, the pole plasm. Pole plasm contains polar granules, organelles in which maternally produced molecules required for germ cell formation are assembled. An untranslatable RNA, called Polar granule component (Pgc), was identified and found to be localized in polar granules. Most pole cells in embryos produced by transgenic females expressing antisense Pgc RNA failed to complete migration and to populate the embryonic gonads, and females that developed from these embryos often had agametic ovaries. These results support an essential role for Pgc RNA in germline development."
https://openalex.org/W2017146235,"Responses to subjective contours in visual cortical areas V1 and V2 in adult cats were investigated by optical imaging of intrinsic signals and single-unit recording. Both V1 and V2 contain maps of the orientation of subjective gratings that have their basis in specific kinds of neuronal responses to subjective orientations. A greater proportion of neurons in V2 than in V1 show a robust response to subjective edges. Through the use of subjective stimuli in which the orientation of the luminance component is invariant, an unmasked V1 response to subjective edges alone can be demonstrated. The data indicate that the processing of subjective contours begins as early as V1 and continues progressively in higher cortical areas."
https://openalex.org/W2081892064,"Polymer chains attached by one end to an impenetrable surface at high coverage exemplify a tethered layer of mesoscopic dimensions. At equilibrium, thermal fluctuations of the segment density profile of the brushlike layer reflect the tethered chain dynamics; the probing of these fluctuations by evanescent-wave dynamic light scattering is reported. By utilizing a set of terminally attached layers with thicknesses (L 0 ) from 45 to 130 nanometers, it was found that there is a preferred wavelength of order L 0 of these fluctuations with a concurrent slowing down of their thermal decay rate. This technique could open the route for the investigation of the largely unexplored area of polymer surface dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2066053659,"An important feature of the human immune system is the ability of T cells to respond to small quantities of antigen. Class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted T cells that expressed a costimulatory natural killer (NK) cell receptor for class I MHC proteins were cloned. In the presence of low doses of superantigen, the proliferative response of these T cell clones was three- to ninefold greater when the T cells were costimulated by way of the NK receptor. Thus, the action of costimulatory NK receptors on T cells may play a significant role in initiating and sustaining immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W2029154551,"The grain growth rates of MgSiO 3 perovskite and periclase in aggregates have been determined at 25 gigapascals and 1573 to 2173 kelvin. The average grain size ( G ) was fitted to the rate equation, and the grain growth rates of perovskite and periclase were G 10.6 = 1 × 10 −57.4 t exp(−320.8/ RT ) and G 10.8 = 1 × 10 −62.3 t exp(−247.0/ RT ), respectively, where t is the time, R is the gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature. These growth rates provide insight into the mechanism for grain growth in minerals relevant to the Earth's lower mantle that will ultimately help define the rheology of the lower mantle."

The ( R, R′ ) structure was characterized to near-atomic resolution by grazing-incidence x-ray diffraction (GIXD). The two diastereomeric systems, ( R, R′ ) and ( R, S′ ), demonstrate similar surface pressure-molecular area isotherms, but their structures are completely different on the molecular level, as monitored by GIXD. Complementary data on these two architectures were provided by atomic force microscopy."
