https://openalex.org/W2085279168,"Global plant trait studies have revealed fundamental trade-offs in plant resource economics. We evaluated such trait trade-offs during secondary succession in two species-rich tropical ecosystems that contrast in precipitation: dry deciduous and wet evergreen forests of Mexico. Species turnover with succession in dry forest largely relates to increasing water availability and in wet forest to decreasing light availability. We hypothesized that while functional trait trade-offs are similar in the two forest systems, the successful plant strategies in these communities will be different, as contrasting filters affect species turnover. Research was carried out in 15 dry secondary forest sites (5-63 years after abandonment) and in 17 wet secondary forest sites (<1-25 years after abandonment). We used 11 functional traits measured on 132 species to make species-trait PCA biplots for dry and wet forest and compare trait trade-offs. We evaluated whether multivariate plant strategies changed during succession, by calculating a ‘Community-Weighted Mean’ plant strategy, based on species scores on the first two PCA-axes. Trait spectra reflected two main trade-off axes that were similar for dry and wet forest species: acquisitive versus conservative species, and drought avoiding species versus evergreen species with large animal-dispersed seeds. These trait associations were consistent when accounting for evolutionary history. Successional changes in the most successful plant strategies reflected different functional trait spectra depending on the forest type. In dry forest the community changed from having drought avoiding strategies early in succession to increased abundance of evergreen strategies with larger seeds late in succession. In wet forest the community changed from species having mainly acquisitive strategies to those with more conservative strategies during succession. These strategy changes were explained by increasing water availability during dry forest succession and increasing light scarcity during wet forest succession. Although similar trait spectra were observed among dry and wet secondary forest species, the consequences for succession were different resulting from contrasting environmental filters."

We aimed to clarify the alterations in peripheral blood T cell subsets associated with MS relapse on fingolimod.Blood samples successively collected from 23 relapsing-remitting MS patients before and during fingolimod therapy (0.5 mg/day) for 12 months and 18 healthy controls (HCs) were analysed for T cell subsets by flow cytometry. In MS patients, the percentages of central memory T (CCR7+CD45RO+) cells (TCM) and naïve T (CCR7+CD45RO-) cells decreased significantly, while those of effector memory T (CCR7-CD45RA-) and suppressor precursor T (CD28-) cells increased in both CD4+T and CD8+T cells from 2 weeks to 12 months during fingolimod therapy. The percentages of regulatory T (CD4+CD25highCD127low) cells in CD4+T cells and CCR7-CD45RA+T cells in CD8+T cells also increased significantly. Eight relapsed patients demonstrated greater percentages of CD4+TCM than 15 non-relapsed patients at 3 and 6 months (p=0.0051 and p=0.0088, respectively). The IL17-, IL9-, and IL4-producing CD4+T cell percentages were significantly higher at pre-treatment in MS patients compared with HCs (p<0.01 for all), while the IL17-producing CD4+T cell percentages tended to show a transient increase at 2 weeks of fingolimod therapy (pcorr=0.0834).The CD4+TCM percentages at 2 weeks to 12 months during fingolimod therapy are related to relapse."
https://openalex.org/W2159287338,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a debilitating autoimmune neuroinflammatory disease influenced by genetics and the environment. MS incidence in female subjects has approximately tripled in the last century, suggesting a sex-specific environmental influence. Recent animal and human studies have implicated dietary sodium as a risk factor in MS, whereby high sodium augmented the generation of T helper (Th) 17 cells and exacerbated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the principal model of MS. However, whether dietary sodium interacts with sex or genetics remains unknown. Here, we show that high dietary sodium exacerbates EAE in a strain- and sex-specific fashion. In C57BL6/J mice, exposure to a high-salt diet exacerbated disease in both sexes, while in SJL/JCrHsd mice, it did so only in females. In further support of a genetic component, we found that sodium failed to modify EAE course in C57BL6/J mice carrying a 129/Sv-derived interval on chromosome 17. Furthermore, we found that the high-sodium diet did not augment Th17 or Th1 responses, but it did result in increased blood-brain barrier permeability and brain pathology. Our results demonstrate that the effects of dietary sodium on autoimmune neuroinflammation are sex specific, genetically controlled, and CNS mediated."

Alternative splicing of Tau exon 10, which encodes the second microtubule-binding repeat, generates Tau isoforms containing three and four microtubule-binding repeats, termed 3R-Taus and 4R-Taus, respectively. Dual specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A (Dyrk1A) lies at the Down syndrome critical region of chromosome 21. Overexpression of this kinase may contribute to the early Tau pathology in Down syndrome via phosphorylation of Tau and dysregulation of Tau exon 10. Here, we report that Dyrk1A was truncated at the C terminus and was associated with overactivation of calpain I in AD brain. Calpain I proteolyzed Dyrk1A in vitro first at the C terminus and further at the N terminus and enhanced its kinase activity toward Tau via increased Vmax but not Km. C-terminal truncation of Dyrk1A resulted in stronger activity than its full-length protein in promotion of exon 10 exclusion and phosphorylation of Tau. Dyrk1A was truncated in kainic acid-induced excitotoxic mouse brains and coincided with an increase in 3R-Tau expression and phosphorylation of Tau via calpain activation. Moreover, truncation of Dyrk1A was correlated with an increase in the ratio of 3R-Tau/4R-Tau and Tau hyperphosphorylation in AD brain. Collectively, these findings suggest that truncation/activation of Dyrk1A by Ca2+/calpain I might contribute to Tau pathology via promotion of exon 10 exclusion and hyperphosphorylation of Tau in AD brain.

Biology has evolved complex strategies to generate, reflect, utilize, control, and detect light. Cephalopods (squids, octopi, and cuttlefish) are paragon examples of light-manipulating organisms, having evolved a sophisticated camera-like eye, which in some respects outperforms the eyes of vertebrate eyes (1.Land M.F. Fernald R.D. The evolution of eyes.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1992; 15: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). They have evolved the ability to activate, shutter, and direct bioluminescence generated autogenically (2.Arnold J. Young R. Ultrastructure of squid photophore. I. Structure of the photogenic tissue.Biol. Bull. 1974; 147: 507-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and by endosymbionts (3.Ruby E.G.

Microbiol. 1996; 50: 591-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). These animals are especially renowned for their remarkable ability to dynamically camouflage themselves, seemingly morphing into and appearing from their surroundings, by actively tuning combinations of the pigmentation, iridescence, transparency, and light scattering of their skin (4.Mäthger L.M.

Messenger J.B. Cephalopod Behavior. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1996: 31-45Google Scholar). Iridescence (angle- and wavelength-dependent reflectance) is a form of structural coloration that results from reflection rather than from differential absorption by pigments. Unlike the pigmented chromatophore cells in the skin, the cephalopods' iridocytes (also known as iridophores) produce iridescent colors by constructive interference of light reflected from the lamellae of subcellular Bragg reflectors that create a periodic, mesoscale array of alternating high and low refractive indices (8.Denton E.J. Land M.F. Mechanism of reflexion in silvery layers of fish and cephalopods.Proc. R Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1971; 178: 43-61Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Live Doryteuthis opalescens specimens were purchased from Outer Banks Commercial Fisheries (Oxnard, CA), and transported under constant oxygen aeration to the University of California-Santa Barbara where they were kept in 2-m circular tanks connected to an open seawater system. Iridocyte tissue was isolated by careful dissection as reported previously (13.Tao A.R. DeMartini D.G. Izumi M. Sweeney A.M. Holt A.L. Morse D.E.

The pellets were centrifugally washed two times with homogenization buffer. The pellet was solubilized in SDS loading buffer, heated to 95 °C for 5 min, and resolved by SDS-PAGE (125 V, 1.5 h) on a 12% Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gel and then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue protein stain (0.1% (w/v) Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, 50% methanol, 10% acetic acid), and destained (10% methanol, 10% acetic acid). Alternatively, gels were fixed and stained with SYPRO RubyTM (Thermo Fisher Scientific) per the manufacturer's protocol. SeeBlue® Plus2 and BenchMarkTM protein ladder were used as molecular mass standards to determine the apparent molecular masses of the protein bands. Known (0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 5 μg) amounts of recombinant reflectin DpRA1 (13.Tao A.R. DeMartini D.G. Izumi M. Sweeney A.M. Holt A.L. Morse D.E.

Protein gels were imaged and analyzed with a ChemiDocTM XRS+ imaging system and Image LabTM software (Bio-Rad). For determination of the reflectin proportion of the dry tissue weight, isolated tissue was rinsed in deionized water, lyophilized, weighed, and then homogenized and extracted as described above. Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained and destained protein bands were excised from the protein gel. Proteins in the gel fragments were digested using the in-gel tryptic digestion protocol described by the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Mass Spectrometry Facility (19.Rosenfeld J.

In brief, cysteine residues were reduced with 10 mm dithiothreitol in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate for 1 h at 56 °C followed by alkylation with 55 mm iodoacetamide in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate for 0.75 h at room temperature. Washed and dehydrated gels were rehydrated in trypsin solution (12.5 ng of trypsin/ml 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate) and digested for 8 h at 37 °C. Peptides were extracted from the gel with 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid followed by lyophilization overnight. Peptides were resuspended in 1% formic acid and resolved by LC/MS/MS on a Waters 2695 HPLC unit arranged in line with a Waters Micromass QTOF2 (Waters, Milford, MA) instrument at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) Mass Spectrometry Facility. Chromatograms and spectra were analyzed with MassLynx 4.0 software. The reflectin pellet was solubilized in 6 m guanidine HCl and then desalted with C18 ZipTips® according to the manufacturer's protocol (Millipore, Billerica, MA). 2 μl of eluant was mixed with 8 μl of a saturated matrix solution of sinapic acid in 70:30, acetonitrile:H2O, with 0.1% TFA, spotted onto a stainless steel plate, and analyzed on a Voyager Biospectrophotometry work station (Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA). Tryptic digests were analyzed as above except that the matrix solution was α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50:50 acetonitrile:H2O, with 0.1% TFA. Protein bands resolved on an electrophoresis gel were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane in a semi-dry blotter (15 V) for 20 min, and the protein bands were briefly stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and destained with 10% methanol, 10% acetic acid. The protein bands of interest were excised, vacuum-sealed in ampules with 100 μl of HCl, 5 μl of phenol, and 5 μl of thioglycolic acid, and hydrolyzed for 24 h at 110 °C. The resulting amino acid constituents were analyzed by an L-8900 amino acid analyzer (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) and calibrated with a known amino acid standard solution. Total RNA was isolated using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), from freshly dissected iridocyte tissue that was disrupted by grinding in a mortar and pestle under liquid nitrogen. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript III RT (Invitrogen) with an oligo(dT)20 primer. A BD SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit (Clontech) was used to prepare rapid amplification of complementary DNA ends (RACE)-ready cDNA. All the procedures were performed according to the manufacturers' instructions. We designed primers (Table 1) based on the reflectin cDNA transcripts of the closely related species, Doryteuthis pealeii (14.Izumi M. Sweeney A.M. DeMartini D.G. Weaver J.C. Powers M.L. Tao A.

PCR products were cloned into the pCR2.1 vector using TA cloning (Invitrogen) and sequenced by the Sanger method (GENEWIZ Inc., South Plainfield, NJ) using the standard T7 promotor and M13 reverse primers. Sequences of D. opalescens reflectin-like proteins A1, A2, and B1 were deposited into GenBankTM: DoRA1 (GenBank accession number KF661517), DoRA2 (GenBank accession number KF661516), and DoRB1 (GenBank accession number KF661515). D. opalescens reflectin-like protein C1 (DoRC1, GenBank accession number KF661518) was sequenced using degenerate primers based on the MS/MS sequencing of the tryptic fragments (Table 2) coupled with the universal 5′ and 3′ RACE primers from the BD SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit. Based on the RACE results, primers were designed to amplify the full coding sequence of DoRC1 (Table 1), cloned, and sequenced as described for the reflectin proteins above. The D. opalescens reflectin sequences described here were later confirmed using 454 generated sequencing assemblies (data not shown).TABLE 1PCR primers for the amplification of full length reflectin CDSProtein5′ primer3′ primerDoRA1GTGTCCCTTCTTGGTCGTTGGGAACATGCCACGCCCACAAGDoRA2CCGTCAATATGAATCGCTACGAAAAAAACACACACACGAGAGDoRB1AGAACTTTTGTATCACGCTAAAATTCAACTTCCGGDoRC1GTTTCCAAATCAAACCAGCACCCGAAAGTTTAAGAAGTCCTCCAG Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Degenerate internal primers of DoRC1 for sequencing by RACEPeptide (MS/MS)Forward primerReverse primerYMDMPQGRTAYATGGAYATGCCNCAYGGCCRTGNGGCATRTCCATRTAMEGNMENATGGARGGNAAYATGGARAATTYTCCATRTTNCCYTCCATPPDMPRCCNCCNGAYATGCCNMGCKNGGCATRTCNGGNGGMSPMPYGATGMCNCCNATGCCNTAYGGCCRTANGGCATNGGNGKCAT Open table in a new tab The optical spectra of the squid tissues were measured by a USB2000 spectrophotometer (Ocean Optics, Dunedin, FL) through a 0.6-mm multi-mode collection fiber surrounded by a coaxial illumination fiber positioned normal to the skin surface at a distance of 2 mm. The reflectance measurements were taken under illumination (also normal to the surface) with a broadband halogen white light source (DH-2000, Ocean Optics). All spectra were standardized to a diffuse reflection standard WS-1 (Ocean Optics), corrected by subtraction of the electric dark signal, and recorded over an integration time of 0.75 s. Tissues were homogenized in homogenization buffer with 2% SDS using TenBroeck tissue homogenizers. Total protein content was determined by a BCA assay (Thermo Fisher), and each lysate was adjusted to final concentration of ∼1 mg/ml protein in SDS loading buffer and heated to 95 °C for 5 min. Freshly resolved SDS-PAGE gels were transferred to PVDF membranes in transfer buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, and 20% (v/v) methanol) using a semi-dry blotter (25 V, 15 min). Western blots for the detection of DoRA1 and DoRA2 were performed using a rabbit polyclonal IgG antibody raised against recombinant D. pealeii reflectin like protein-A1 (DpRA1; GenBank accession number FJ824804) (13.Tao A.R.

Membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C in blocking buffer (PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, 3% (w/v) BSA, pH 7.4). The membranes were incubated in a 1:100 dilution of the primary antibodies in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature and then washed in blocking buffer three times for 10 min/wash. The membranes were then incubated in a 1:5000 dilution of secondary antibodies (goat anti-rabbit-conjugated HRP, Thermo Scientific, catalog number 31460) in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were again washed in blocking buffer three times. Immunoreactivity was visualized by chemiluminescence (SuperSignal West Dura chemiluminescence substrate, Thermo Scientific, catalog number 37071). For Western blot detection of DoRB1, we used a custom polyclonal chicken IgY antibody generated against the peptide: DDHYMENDRFLYPHD (Aves Labs, Tigard, OR). Similarly, for Western blot detection of DoRC1, we used a custom polyclonal chicken IgY antibody generated against the peptide: DQGRMGEPMEGNMENR (Aves Labs, Tigard, OR). For these two IgY antibodies, the blotting protocol was the same as outlined above except that the blocking buffer had 3% (w/v) nonfat milk instead of BSA, the primary antibodies were diluted 1:1000, and the secondary antibody (goat anti-chicken IgY HRP Aves Labs, H-1004) was diluted 1:5000. Blots and protein gels were imaged and analyzed on a ChemiDocTM XRS+ imaging system with Image LabTM software (Bio-Rad). Squid were euthanized by decapitation immediately prior to dissection. The mantle was cut along the ventral surface, the internal organs and gladius were removed, and the mantle was washed with artificial seawater (470 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 27 mm MgCl2, 29 mm MgSO4, 11 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8) and pinned out flat in a dissection tray. Areas of the dermis were carefully dissected away from the mantle muscle and pinned out to the original dimensions in SYLGARD 184 (Dow Corning, Midland, MI)-coated dishes. These samples were fixed for electron microscopy (2% formaldehyde, 2% glutaraldehyde in artificial seawater, 2 h at room temperature). Following fixation, the tissue was washed with deionized water (freshly degassed) three times. At this point, samples not used for immunohistochemistry were post-fixed in 2% OsO4 for 1 h at room temperature. The tissue was dehydrated in a series of graded ethanol solutions: 25, 50, 75, 90, 100, 100, and 100% ethanol, followed by sequential exchange into propylene oxide:ethanol solutions: 33, 66, 100, 100, 100% propylene oxide. The tissue samples then were transferred to Spurr's resin (Ted Pella Inc., Redding, CA) through a graded series of Spurr's resin:propylene oxide solutions: 33, 66, 100, and 100% Spurr's resin, transferred to silicon molds overlaid with fresh resin, and cured overnight at 55 °C. The hardened blocks were trimmed and sectioned on a Leica EM UC6 ultramicrotome (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). Ultrathin sections (80–100 nm) were collected on Formvar-coated copper mesh grids. The samples were gold-labeled following the previously published protocol (21.Bergersen L.H. Storm-Mathisen J. Gundersen V. Immunogold quantification of amino acids and proteins in complex subcellular compartments.Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 144-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were etched with 5% hydrogen peroxide for 10 min; blocked in Tris-buffered saline (TBST, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 25 mm Tris, 0.1% v/v Tween-20, pH 7.4); incubated for 16 h at room temperature in solutions of the antibodies diluted in TBST (rabbit anti-RA1, 1:100; chicken anti-RB1, 1:1000; chicken anti-IN2, 1:1000); washed three times in TBST; incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to 12-nm gold nano-particles (donkey anti-rabbit IgG, 711-205-152, or donkey anti-chicken IgY, 703-205-155, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc., West Grove, PA), washed three times in TBST; post-stained using 4% uranyl acetate (10 min) followed by four water washes; and soaked in 2% lead citrate (2 min) followed by four more washes. Samples were imaged on a JEOL 123 transmission electron microscope operating at 80 kV. The ImageJ software package was used to analyze the spatial distribution of the localized gold nanoparticle with respect to the iridosomal lamellae by measuring the distance from each particle to the membrane at the edge of the lamellae (dpm) and the thickness of the platelet (dt). The distance from the center of the platelet to the particle was expressed as a percentage of the distance from the center platelet to the edge of the platelet (dcp)to normalize for variation in platelet thickness.

The relative molecular masses of the various reflectins were determined by mobility during SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A) and by mass spectrometry (Fig. 2B) and compared with the cDNA deduced sequences (Table 3). We also sequenced an additional abundant protein, DoRC1 (Fig. 4); its amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA was validated by LC/MS/MS sequencing of multiple tryptic peptides (Table 4).

The pathways involved in disease progression are not understood. Loss-of-function mutations in Wnt coreceptor LDL receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6) underlie early-onset atherosclerosis, metabolic risk factors, and NAFLD in humans by unknown mechanisms. We generated mice with the human disease-associated LRP6(R611C) mutation and phenotypically characterized their liver. Homozygote LRP6(R611C) (LRP6(mut/mut)) mice exhibited both steatohepatitis and steatofibrosis. These traits were associated with increased activity of the noncanonical Wnt/Ras homolog family member A, Rho-associated protein kinase 2, and PKC-α/-μ pathways. Accordingly, there was increased TGF-β1 activity, coupled with enhanced expression of smooth muscle α-actin and vimentin that colocalized with albumin in LRP6(mut/mut) mouse liver. LRP6 knockdown reprogramed HepG2 cells to express both these markers, linking impaired Wnt signaling with hepatocyte transdifferentiation. The causal link between altered Wnt signaling and NASH was established by normalization of the disease pathways and rescue of the liver traits by Wnt3a administration to LRP6(mut/mut) mice. Thus, this study identifies diverse disease pathways that underlie a spectrum of NASH-related liver diseases and are linked by a single human genetic variant. LRP6 and noncanonical Wnt pathways are important potential therapeutic targets against NASH."

A recently proposed algorithm (named Ecres) estimates well enough the supplemental carbohydrates for exercises lasting one hour, but its performance for prolonged exercise requires validation. Nine T1DM patients (5M/4F; 35-65 years; HbA1c 54 ± 13 mmol · mol(-1)) performed, under free-life conditions, a 3-h walk at 30% heart rate reserve while insulin concentrations, whole-body carbohydrate oxidation rates (determined by indirect calorimetry) and supplemental carbohydrates (93% sucrose), together with glycemia, were measured every 30 min. Data were subsequently compared with the corresponding values estimated by the algorithm. No significant difference was found between the estimated insulin concentrations and the laboratory-measured values (p = NS). Carbohydrates oxidation rate decreased significantly with time (from 0.84 ± 0.31 to 0.53 ± 0.24 g · min(-1), respectively; p < 0.001), being estimated well enough by the algorithm (p = NS). Estimated carbohydrates requirements were practically equal to the corresponding measured values (p = NS), the difference between the two quantities amounting to -1.0 ± 6.1 g, independent of the elapsed exercise time (time effect, p = NS). Results confirm that Ecres provides a satisfactory estimate of the carbohydrates required to avoid glycemic imbalances during moderate intensity aerobic physical activity, opening the prospect of an intriguing method that could liberate patients from the fear of exercise-induced hypoglycemia."

Here we have determined the LRP1 domains involved in AgLDL recognition with the aim of specifically blocking AgLDL internalization in hVSMCs. The capacity of fluorescently labeled AgLDL to bind to functional LRP1 clusters was tested in a receptor-ligand fluorometric assay made by immobilizing soluble LRP1 “minireceptors” (sLRP1-II, sLRP1-III, and sLRP1-IV) recombinantly expressed in CHO cells. This assay showed that AgLDL binds to cluster II. We predicted three well exposed and potentially immunogenic peptides in the CR7–CR9 domains of this cluster (termed P1 (Cys1051–Glu1066), P2 (Asp1090–Cys1104), and P3 (Gly1127–Cys1140)). AgLDL, but not native LDL, bound specifically and tightly to P3-coated wells. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against P3 prevented AgLDL uptake by hVSMCs and were almost twice as effective as anti-P1 and anti-P2 Abs in reducing intracellular cholesteryl ester accumulation. Moreover, anti-P3 Abs efficiently prevented AgLDL-induced LRP1 up-regulation and counteracted the down-regulatory effect of AgLDL on hVSMC migration.

https://openalex.org/W2028058217,"We established co-cultures of invasive or non-invasive NSCLC cell lines and various types of fibroblasts (FBs) to more precisely characterize the molecular mechanism of tumor-stroma crosstalk in lung cancer. The HGF-MET-ERK1/2-CREB-axis was shown to contribute to the onset of the invasive phenotype of Calu-1 with HGF being secreted by FBs. Differential expression analysis of the respective mono- and co-cultures revealed an upregulation of NFκB-related genes exclusively in co-cultures with Calu-1. Cytokine Array- and ELISA-based characterization of the “cytokine fingerprints” identified CSF2 (GM-CSF), CXCL1, CXCL6, VEGF, IL6, RANTES and IL8 as being specifically upregulated in various co-cultures. Whilst CXCL6 exhibited a strictly FB-type-specific induction profile regardless of the invasiveness of the tumor cell line, CSF2 was only induced in co-cultures of invasive cell lines regardless of the partnered FB type. These cultures revealed a clear link between the induction of CSF2 and the EMT signature of the cancer cell line. The canonical NFκB signaling in FBs, but not in tumor cells, was shown to be responsible for the induced and constitutive CSF2 expression. In addition to CSF2, cytokine IL6, IL8 and IL1B, and chemokine CXCL1 and CXCL6 transcripts were also shown to be increased in co-cultured FBs. In contrast, their induction was not strictly dependent on the invasiveness of the co-cultured tumor cell. In a multi-reporter assay, additional signaling pathways (AP-1, HIF1-α, KLF4, SP-1 and ELK-1) were found to be induced in FBs co-cultured with Calu-1. Most importantly, no difference was observed in the level of inducibility of these six signaling pathways with regard to the type of FBs used. Finally, upon tumor fibroblast interaction the massive induction of chemokines such as CXCL1 and CXCL6 in FBs might be responsible for increased recruitment of a monocytic cell line (THP-1) in a transwell assay."
https://openalex.org/W2079494387,"The objective of this investigation was to evaluate whether intravaginal infusion of a lactic acid bacteria (LAB) cocktail around parturition could influence the immune response, incidence rate of uterine infections, and the overall health status of periparturient dairy cows. One hundred pregnant Holstein dairy cows were assigned to 1 of the 3 experimental groups as follows: 1) one dose of LAB on wk -2 and -1, and one dose of carrier (sterile skim milk) on wk +1 relative to the expected day of parturition (TRT1); 2) one dose of LAB on wk -2, -1, and +1 (TRT2), and 3) one dose of carrier on wk -2, -1, and +1 (CTR). The LAB were a lyophilized culture mixture composed of Lactobacillus sakei FUA3089, Pediococcus acidilactici FUA3138, and Pediococcus acidilactici FUA3140 with a cell count of 108-109 cfu/dose. Blood samples and vaginal mucus were collected once a week from wk -2 to +3 and analyzed for content of serum total immunoglobulin G (IgG), lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), serum amyloid A (SAA), haptoglobin (Hp), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and vaginal mucus secretory IgA (sIgA). Clinical observations including rectal temperature, vaginal discharges, retained placenta, displaced abomasum, and laminitis were monitored from wk -2 to +8 relative to calving. Results showed that intravaginal LAB lowered the incidence of metritis and total uterine infections. Intravaginal LAB also were associated with lower concentrations of systemic LBP, an overall tendency for lower SAA, and greater vaginal mucus sIgA. No differences were observed for serum concentrations of Hp, TNF, IL-1, IL-6 and total IgG among the treatment groups. Administration with LAB had no effect on the incidence rates of other transition cow diseases. Overall intravaginal LAB lowered uterine infections and improved local and systemic immune responses in the treated transition dairy cows."

The study was designed to investigate the feasibility of two proposed construction-general solutions to the question of how children retreat from, or avoid, such errors. No support was found for the prediction of the preemption hypothesis that the greater the frequency of the verb in the single most nearly synonymous construction (for this example, the periphrastic causative; e.g., Daddy made the baby giggle), the lower the acceptability of the error. Support was found, however, for the prediction of the entrenchment hypothesis that the greater the overall frequency of the verb, regardless of construction, the lower the acceptability of the error, at least for the two older groups. Thus while entrenchment appears to be a robust solution to the problem of the retreat from error, and one that generalizes across different error types, we did not find evidence that this is the case for preemption. The implication is that the solution to the retreat from error lies not with specialized mechanisms, but rather in a probabilistic process of construction competition."

This study aimed to develop a simple validated prognostic score based on the predictive factors for survival in patients with intermediate-stage HCC treated with TACE.Three-hundred and fifty patients with intermediate-stage HCC undergoing initial TACE at Chiba University Hospital (training cohort; n = 187) and two affiliated hospitals (validation cohort; n = 163) were included. Following variables were entered into univariate and multivariate Cox regression models to develop a points-based clinical scoring system: gender, age, etiology, pretreatment, Child-Pugh score, aspartate aminotransferase, creatinine, C-reactive protein, alfa-fetoprotein, size of the largest lesion, and number and location of lesions.The number of lesions and the Child-Pugh score were identified as independent prognostic factors in the training cohort. The development of a 0-7-point prognostic score, named the Chiba HCC in intermediate-stage prognostic (CHIP) score, was based on the sum of three subscale scores (Child-Pugh score = 0, 1, 2, or 3, respectively, number of lesions = 0, 2, or 3, respectively, HCV-RNA positivity = 0 or 1, respectively). The generated scores were then differentiated into five groups (0-2 points, 3 points, 4 points, 5 points, and 6-7 points) by the median survival time (65.2, 29.2, 24.3, 13.1, and 8.4 months, respectively; p < 0.0001). These results were confirmed in the external validation cohort (p < 0.0001).The CHIP score is easy-to-use and may assist in finding an appropriate treatment strategy for intermediate-stage HCC."

https://openalex.org/W2031636664,"Cervical lymph nodes (CLN) are the first lymph nodes encountered by material taking the oral route. To study their role in orally acquired infections, we analyzed 307 patients of up to 14 years treated in the university clinic of Skopje, Macedonia, for brucellosis, a zoonotic bacterial disease frequently acquired by ingestion of contaminated dairy products. From these children, 36% had lymphadenopathy. Among orally infected children, lymphadenopathy with CLN being the only lymph nodes affected was significantly more frequent as compared to those infected by contact with animals (83% vs. 63%), suggesting a possible involvement of CLN during orally acquired human brucellosis. Using a murine model where bacteria are delivered into the oral cavity, we show that Brucella quickly and selectively colonize the CLN where they proliferate and persist over long periods of time for up to 50 days post-infection. A similar efficient though less specific drainage to CLN was found for Brucella, Salmonella typhimurium and fluorescent microspheres delivered by gavage, a pathway likely representing a mixed infection mode of intragastric and oral infection, suggesting a central pathway of drained material. Microspheres as well as bacteria drained to CLN predominately reside in cells expressing CD68 and no or low levels of CD11c. Even though no systemic response could be detected, Brucella induced a locally restricted inflammatory reaction with increased expression levels of interferon γ, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-12, granzyme B and a delayed induction of Nos2. Inflammation led to pronounced lymphadenopathy, infiltration of macrophages/monocytes expressing high levels of major histocompatibility complex II and to formation of epitheloid granulomas. Together, these results highlight the role of CLN in oral infections as both, an initial and efficient trap for bacterial invaders and as possible reservoir for chronic pathogens. They likewise cast a new light on the significance of oral routes for means of vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W2018631267,"Apolipoprotein D (apoD), a member of the lipocalin family, is a 29-kDa secreted glycoprotein that binds and transports small lipophilic molecules. Expressed in several tissues, apoD is up-regulated under different stress stimuli and in a variety of pathologies. Numerous studies have revealed that overexpression of apoD led to neuroprotection in various mouse models of acute stress and neurodegeneration. This multifunctional protein is internalized in several cells types, but the specific internalization mechanism remains unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that the internalization of apoD involves a specific cell surface receptor in 293T cells, identified as the transmembrane glycoprotein basigin (BSG, CD147); more particularly, its low glycosylated form. Our results show that internalized apoD colocalizes with BSG into vesicular compartments. Down-regulation of BSG disrupted the internalization of apoD in cells. In contrast, overexpression of basigin in SH-5YSY cells, which poorly express BSG, restored the uptake of apoD. Cyclophilin A, a known ligand of BSG, competitively reduced apoD internalization, confirming that BSG is a key player in the apoD internalization process. In summary, our results demonstrate that basigin is very likely the apoD receptor and provide additional clues on the mechanisms involved in apoD-mediated functions, including neuroprotection."
https://openalex.org/W2060267148,"Background Information on body size and shape is used to interpret many aspects of physiology, including nutritional status, cardio-metabolic risk and lung function. Such data have traditionally been obtained through manual anthropometry, which becomes time-consuming when many measurements are required. 3D photonic scanning (3D-PS) of body surface topography represents an alternative digital technique, previously applied successfully in large studies of adults. The acceptability, precision and accuracy of 3D-PS in young children have not been assessed. Methods We attempted to obtain data on girth, width and depth of the chest and waist, and girth of the knee and calf, manually and by 3D-PS in a multi-ethnic sample of 1484 children aged 5–11 years. The rate of 3D-PS success, and reasons for failure, were documented. Precision and accuracy of 3D-PS were assessed relative to manual measurements using the methods of Bland and Altman. Results Manual measurements were successful in all cases. Although 97.4% of children agreed to undergo 3D-PS, successful scans were only obtained in 70.7% of these. Unsuccessful scans were primarily due to body movement, or inability of the software to extract shape outputs. The odds of scan failure, and the underlying reason, differed by age, size and ethnicity. 3D-PS measurements tended to be greater than those obtained manually (p<0.05), however ranking consistency was high (r2>0.90 for most outcomes). Conclusions 3D-PS is acceptable in children aged ≥5 years, though with current hardware/software, and body movement artefacts, approximately one third of scans may be unsuccessful. The technique had poorer technical success than manual measurements, and had poorer precision when the measurements were viable. Compared to manual measurements, 3D-PS showed modest average biases but acceptable limits of agreement for large surveys, and little evidence that bias varied substantially with size. Most of the issues we identified could be addressed through further technological development."
https://openalex.org/W2021605204,"Cell surface receptors of the NOTCH family of proteins are activated by ligand induced intramembrane proteolysis. Unfolding of the extracellular negative regulatory region (NRR), enabling successive proteolysis by the enzymes Adam10 and γ-secretase, is rate-limiting in NOTCH activation. Mutations in the NOTCH1 NRR are associated with ligand-independent activation and frequently found in human T-cell malignancies. In mammals four NOTCH receptors and five Delta/Jagged ligands exist, but mutations in the NRR are only rarely reported for receptors other than NOTCH1. Using biochemical and functional assays, we compared the molecular mechanisms of ligand-independent signaling in NOTCH1 and the highly related NOTCH2 receptor. Both murine Notch1 and Notch2 require the metalloprotease protease Adam17, but not Adam10 during ligand-independent activation. Interestingly, the human NOTCH2 receptor is resistant to ligand-independent activation compared with its human homologs or murine orthologs. Taken together, our data reveal subtle but functionally important differences for the NRR among NOTCH paralogs and homologs."
https://openalex.org/W2035376792,"Glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase-4 (GPAT4) null pups grew poorly during the suckling period and, as adults, were protected from high fat diet-induced obesity. To determine why Gpat4−/− mice failed to gain weight during these two periods of high fat feeding, we examined energy metabolism. Compared with controls, the metabolic rate of Gpat4−/− mice fed a 45% fat diet was 12% higher. Core body temperature was 1 oC higher after high fat feeding. Food intake, fat absorption, and activity were similar in both genotypes. Impaired weight gain in Gpat4−/− mice did not result from increased heat loss, because both cold tolerance and response to a β3-adrenergic agonist were similar in both genotypes. Because GPAT4 comprises 65% of the total GPAT activity in brown adipose tissue (BAT), we characterized BAT function. A 45% fat diet increased the Gpat4−/− BAT expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPAR) target genes, Cpt1α, Pgc1α, and Ucp1, and BAT mitochondria oxidized oleate and pyruvate at higher rates than controls, suggesting that fatty acid signaling and flux through the TCA cycle were enhanced. To assess the role of GPAT4 directly, neonatal BAT preadipocytes were differentiated to adipocytes. Compared with controls, Gpat4−/− brown adipocytes incorporated 33% less fatty acid into triacylglycerol and 46% more into the pathway of β-oxidation. The increased oxidation rate was due solely to an increase in the oxidation of exogenous fatty acids. These data suggest that in the absence of cold exposure, GPAT4 limits excessive fatty acid oxidation and the detrimental induction of a hypermetabolic state."

In this work, we found that PNAS-4 expression in lung tumor tissues is significantly lower than that in adjacent lung tissues; its expression is significantly increased in A549 cells after exposure to cisplatin, methyl methane sulfonate, and mitomycin; and its overexpression induces S phase arrest and apoptosis in A549 (p53 WT), NCI-H460 (p53 WT), H526 (p53 mutation), and Calu-1 (p53−/−) lung cancer cells, leading to proliferation inhibition irrespective of their p53 status. The S phase arrest is associated with up-regulation of p21Waf1/Cip1 and inhibition of the Cdc25A-CDK2-cyclin E/A pathway. Up-regulation of p21Waf1/Cip1 is p53-independent and correlates with activation of ERK. We further showed that the intra-S phase checkpoint, which occurs via DNA-dependent protein kinase-mediated activation of Chk1 and Chk2, is involved in the S phase arrest and apoptosis. Gene silencing of Chk1/2 rescues, whereas that of ATM or ATR does not affect, S phase arrest and apoptosis. Furthermore, human PNAS-4 induces DNA breaks in comet assays and γ-H2AX staining. Intriguingly, caspase-dependent cleavage of Chk1 has an additional role in enhancing apoptosis. Taken together, our findings suggest a novel mechanism by which elevated PNAS-4 first causes DNA-dependent protein kinase-mediated Chk1/2 activation and then results in inhibition of the Cdc25A-CDK2-cyclin E/A pathway, ultimately causing S phase arrest and apoptosis in lung cancer cells.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Despite recent advances in understanding the molecular biology of lung cancer and the introduction of new therapeutic agents for its treatment, its dismal 5-year survival rate has not changed substantially (1.Han S.W. Roman J. Targeting apoptotic signaling pathways in human lung cancer.Curr. Cancer Drug. Targets. 2010; 10: 566-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Clinical approaches have not significantly improved the survival of lung cancer patients. However, recent discoveries regarding the molecular mechanisms responsible for lung cancer initiation and proliferation have unveiled new targets for therapy (1.Han S.W. Roman J. Targeting apoptotic signaling pathways in human lung cancer.Curr. Cancer Drug. Targets. 2010; 10: 566-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Emerging evidence suggests that alterations in pro- and anti-apoptotic pathways are common in cancer cells, and defects in regulation of apoptosis have been implicated in tumorigenesis and drug resistance (1.Han S.W. Roman J. Targeting apoptotic signaling pathways in human lung cancer.Curr. Cancer Drug. Targets. 2010; 10: 566-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 2.Johnstone R.W. Ruefli A.A. Lowe S.W.

Apoptosis in human cancer cells.Curr. Opin. Oncol. 2004; 16: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Thus, the therapeutic application of apoptosis manipulation (e.g. restoration of the defective apoptosis pathway through introduction of a pro-apoptotic gene) may be an attractive approach to improve the clinical response of lung cancer patients. PNAS-4 was identified as a novel apoptosis-related gene in human acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line NB4. The PNAS-4 protein contains two or three hydrophobic motifs and a conserved N-terminal DUF (domain of unknown function) 862 domain, which is one of the Pfam domains for the ubiquitination machinery and has been recently reported to be a composition of deubiquitinases (4.Choy A. Severo M.S. Sun R. Girke T. Gillespie J.J. Pedra J.H. Decoding the ubiquitin-mediated pathway of arthropod disease vectors.PLoS One. 2013; 8: e78077Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence identities of PNAS-4 among various organisms are very high, implying that PNAS-4 has some important functions. Recently, it was reported that PNAS-4 protein (also known as DeSI-2) belongs to the putative deubiquitinating isopeptidase PPPDE superfamily (5.Shin E.J. Shin H.M. Nam E. Kim W.S. Kim J.H. Oh B.H. Yun Y. DeSUMOylating isopeptidase: a second class of SUMO protease.EMBO Rep. 2012; 13: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that PNAS-4 is up-regulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells after exposure to carcinogenic agents, such as benzene (6.Forrest M.S. Lan Q. Hubbard A.E. Zhang L. Vermeulen R. Zhao X. Li G. Wu Y.Y. Shen M. Yin S. Chanock S.J. Rothman N. Smith M.T.

Recently, PNAS-4 was identified as a novel pro-apoptotic gene activated during the early response to DNA damage, and when overexpressed in osteosarcoma U2OS cells, it could induce significant apoptosis (9.Filippov V.

The early response to DNA damage can lead to activation of alternative splicing activity resulting in CD44 splice pattern changes.Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 7621-7630Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Similarly, we found that overexpression of PNAS-4 induces apoptosis in A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells, mouse colon cancer CT26 cells, and Lewis lung carcinoma LL2 cells and that it suppresses tumor growth in mice and enhances sensitivity to cisplatin, gemcitabine, honokiol, and radiation in lung cancer (10.Hou S.

However, the underlying action mechanism regarding S phase arrest and apoptosis by PNAS-4 in lung cancer cells remains far from clear. The purpose of this work is to elucidate the molecular mechanism for PNAS-4 action in lung cancer cells. human PNAS-4 5-ethyl-2′-deoxyuridine cyclin-dependent kinase checkpoint homolog 1 and 2 ataxia telangiectasia mutated ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase DNA-dependent protein kinase DNA-PK catalytic subunit pTango-zeo-N3Myc tissue microarray 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide. In this work, we found that PNAS-4 expression in lung tumor tissues is significantly lower than that in adjacent lung tissues; that hPNAS-4 is up-regulated in A549 cells after exposure to DNA-damaging agents, including cisplatin, MMS, and MMC; and that its overexpression induces proliferation inhibition, S phase arrest, and apoptosis in lung cancer cells. The S phase arrest was associated with up-regulation of p21Waf1/Cip1, which was independent of the p53 status, and inhibition of the Cdc25A-CDK2-cyclin E/A pathway. Furthermore, hPNAS-4 overexpression resulted in phosphorylation of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) and Chk1/Chk2 but did not cause phosphorylation of ATM and induced DNA breaks. Interestingly, cleavages of Chk1 by caspase-3 and -7 during apoptosis further enhanced the apoptotic signals. Taken together, these data suggest a new mechanism by which PNAS-4 first activates DNA-PK, but not ATM and ATR, which in turn activates Chk1 and Chk2, resulting in inhibition of the Cdc25A-CDK2-cyclin E/A pathway, causing S phase arrest and ultimately triggering apoptosis. Furthermore, caspase-mediated cleavage of Chk1 has an additional positive role in enhancing apoptosis, suggesting a function of Chk1 in switching the cellular response from cell cycle arrest to apoptosis. To our knowledge, we provide new molecular evidence for the potential application of PNAS-4 as a novel target in lung cancer gene therapy. pcDNA3.1 plasmid encoding the human PNAS-4 gene (pc3.1-hPNAS-4) was constructed as described previously (11.Yan F. Gou L. Yang J. Chen L. Tong A. Tang M. Yuan Z. Yao S. Zhang P. Wei Y. A novel pro-apoptosis gene PNAS4 that induces apoptosis in A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells and inhibits tumor growth in mice.Biochimie. 2009; 91: 502-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic expression vectors for expressing wild-type hChk1 and truncated hChk1 mutant (residues 1–299) tagged with Myc at the N terminus were generated into pTango-zeo-N3Myc (pTNM) vector and defined as pTango-zeo-N3Myc-Chk1[M-hChk1(WT)] and pTango-zeo-N3My c-Chk1-T[M-hChk1-T]. pcDNA3.1 (pc3.1), pcDNA3.1-GFP (pc3.1-GFP), pTNM, M-hChk1(WT), M-hChk1-T, and pc3.1- hPNAS-4 plasmids were purified by two rounds of passage over EndoFree columns (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA), as reported previously (12.Yuan Z.

The following antibodies were used: the goat anti-PPPDE1/PNAS-4 Antibody (Everest Biotech, Ltd.), anti-p53, anti-p53 (Ser-15), anti-p21Waf1/Cip1, anti- p27Kip1, anti-p16INK4a, anti-Cdc25A, anti-CDK2, anti-phospho-CDK2 (Tyr-15), anti-cyclin A, anti-cyclin E, anti-cyclin D1, anti-cyclin B1, anti-CDK4, anti-CDK6, anti-Myc, anti-Chk1, anti-Chk2, anti-phospho-Chk1 (Ser-345), anti-phospho-Chk2 (Thr-68), anti-ATM, anti-phospho-ATM (Ser-1981), and anti-β-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.); anti-DNA-PKcs, anti-phospho-DNA-PKcs (Thr-2609), and anti-ATX (Abcam, Cambridge, MA); anti-ERK, anti-phospho-ERK, anti-caspase-3, and anti-caspase-7 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA); and anti-γ-H2AX (Ser-139) (Abcam). Rhodamine (TRITC) AffiniPure goat anti-rabbit IgG was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and ERK inhibitor PD98059 was obtained from Calbiochem. KU60019, VE821, and NU7026 were obtained from Selleck Chemicals (Houston, TX). Lung cancer tissue microarray (TMA) chips containing a total of 55 pairs of human lung tumors and matched adjacent lung tissues were purchased from the National Engineering Center for BioChips (Shanghai, China), and the product ID of the tissue microarray is OD-CT-RsLug04-003. The expression of hPNAS-4 in the tissues was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining with a PNAS-4-specific antibody, using the DakoCytomation EnVision + System-HRP (DAB) detection kit. Briefly, the tissue array sections of 5 μm were dehydrated and subjected to peroxidase blocking. hPNAS-4 antibody was added at a dilution of 1:200 and incubated at room temperature for 30 min on the Dako AutoStainer (Carpinteria, CA) using the DakoCytomation EnVision + System-HRP (DAB) detection kit. The staining was scored according to the staining intensity of cells stained. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotides were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO) with sequences targeting human PNAS-4 (5′-CCAAGAACTCCAGGATGAA-3′). ATM (5′-ACTAGAACATGATAGAGCTAC-3′), ATR (5′-CCAGAGGAATATAATACAGTT-3′), DNA-PKcs (5′-CTTTATGGTGGCCATGGAG-3′), ATX (5′-CCAGGACACGAGGAAACTG-3′), Chk1 (5′-CCAATATTTATTTCTGGA-3′), and Chk2 (5′-CTGAGCTCCTTAGAGACAG-3′). Human A549 (p53 WT), NCI-H460 (p53 WT), H526 (p53 mutation), H358 (p53−/−), and Calu-1 (p53−/−) lung cancer cells were obtained from the ATCC (Manassas, VA). Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium or DMEM (Gibco). All culture media were supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Transfection was performed with LipofectamineTM 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. A549, NCI-H460, H526, H358, and Calu-1 cells were classified into three groups and treated as follows. For group 1 (control), the cells were left untreated and harvested for subsequent experiments. For group 2 (pc3.1) (empty vector), the cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1 plasmid, and 24, 36, or 48 h after transfection, cells were harvested for subsequent experiments. For group 3 (hPNAS-4), the cells were transfected with pc3.1-hPNAS-4 plasmid, and 24, 36, or 48 h after transfection, cells were harvested for subsequent experiments. The harvested cells were used for the following experiments, including RT-PCR, MTT assay, flow cytometric analysis, EdU staining, and Western blotting analysis. For gene silencing of ATM, ATR, Chk1, and Chk2, the corresponding siRNAs were co-transfected with pc3.1/pc3.1-hPNAS-4 plasmids into the indicated cells. The cells were harvested at 24 h post-transfection to detect the cell cycle distribution and apoptosis by using flow cytometric analysis. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. First strand cDNA was synthesized using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Semiquantitative RT-PCR was done to amplify human PNAS-4 and GAPDH. The following pairs of primers were used: human PNAS-4, 5′-ATGGGGGCTAACCAGTTAGT-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTATAGTTTAGTGTGGCGCC-3′ (reverse); GAPDH, 5′-AATCCCATCACCATCTTCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CATCACGCCACAGTTTCC-3′ (reverse). Cells were synchronized using the serum starvation method (16.Xu X. Hamhouyia F. Thomas S.D. Burke T.J. Girvan A.C. McGregor W.G. Trent J.O. Miller D.M. Bates P.J.

Briefly, A549 and Calu-1 cells were plated in complete medium (DMEM or RPMI 1640) containing 10% FBS, at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well in 6-well plates and incubated overnight. Then cells were washed three times with sterile PBS, and the medium was replaced with DMEM with 0.1% (v/v) FBS. After incubation in low serum medium for 48 h, cells were washed three times with PBS, and complete medium was added. The synchronized cells were treated as described above and then used for cell cycle analysis. Cell viability was assessed by an MTT assay (17.Baluchamy S. Ravichandran P. Periyakaruppan A. Ramesh V.

Briefly, cells were plated in 96-well plates at 5 × 103 cells/well and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2, 95% humidity air for 24 h, and then cells were treated as described above. MTT was added to the medium (0.5 mg/ml) and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. The resulting insoluble formazan was dissolved with DMSO and measured at 570 nm using a spectrophotometer. Data represent the average of three wells, and the experiment was repeated three times. Apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry analysis and detecting the cleavages of caspase-3 and -7 and PARP. Cell cycle were analyzed by flow cytometry, as described previously (18.Wei Y.Q. Zhao X. Kariya Y. Fukata H. Teshigawara K. Uchida A.

Briefly, cells were collected and pelleted at 1,500 rpm for 3 min and suspended in 1 ml of hypotonic fluorochrome solution containing 50 μg of propidium iodide/ml in 0.1% sodium citrate plus 0.1% Triton X-100, and the cells were analyzed by the use of a flow cytometer (ESP Elite, Coulter, Miami, FL). Colony formation assays were conducted as described previously (19.Zhang N. Yang Y. Cheng L. Zhang X.M. Zhang S. Wang W. Liu S.Y. Wang S.Y. Wang R.B. Xu W.J. Dai L. Yan N. Fan P. Dai L.X. Tian H.W.

Gene Ther. 2012; 23: 837-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Briefly, A549 and Calu-1 cells transfected with hPNAS-4 for 24 h were plated in triplicate at 500 cells/well in 6-well plates and cultured for 10 days. Then the treated cells were washed twice in PBS, fixed in cold methanol, and stained with 2% crystal violet. After incubation at room temperature for 20 min, the 6-well plates were washed twice in double-distilled H2O and dried, and colonies containing more than 50 cells were counted. All of the experiments were repeated three times, and the average values were reported. EdU (Invitrogen, Alexa Fluor 647 kit) staining was performed as described previously (20.Salic A.

Briefly, A549 and Calu-1 cells were seeded on the coverslips and treated as described above. Then EdU was present at 10 μm for a 24-h period at the beginning of the culture. EdU was imaged using Click-iT labeling (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were counterstained with Hoechst, mounted in standard mounting media, and imaged by a Zeiss (Jena, Germany) fluorescence microscope. Protein samples were mixed with loading buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, and 10% glycerol), heated at 100 °C for 5 min, and loaded onto a 12% SDS-PAGE in electrophoresis buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 250 mm glycine, and 0.1% SDS. Protein was then transferred to PVDF using the Trans-Blot semidry system (Bio-Rad). The membranes were immunoblotted with primary antibodies as described under “Experimental Procedures.” DNA damage was evaluated using single-cell gel electrophoresis with a Trevigen kit (Gaithersburg, MD), as described previously (22.Kang K.

Briefly, A549 cells were transfected with pc3.1-hPNAS-4 plasmid for 24 h or 10 μm etoposide (to provide a positive control) for 12 h. Then the treated cells were embedded in agarose on microscope slides, lysed, and electrophoresed. DNA fragments caused by single- or double-stranded breaks migrated faster than intact DNA. The DNA fragments were visible as comet tails by fluorescence microscope (Zeiss), and the percentage of DNA in the tail was calculated using TriTek CometScore version 1.5 software (Sumerduck, VA). A549 cells were untreated or co-transfected with pc3.1/pc3.1-PNAS-4 and pTNM/pTNM-Chk1(WT)/pTNM-Chk1-T plasmids and incubated in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 24 h. After fixation with methanol at −20 °C, the cells were immunostained with monoclonal anti-γ-H2AX (Ser-139) antibodies and subsequently with rhodamine (TRITC) affinipure goat anti-rabbit IgG and counterstained with DAPI (Invitrogen). The fluorescence images were visualized with a Zeiss fluorescence microscope. The statistical analysis was performed with SPSS software (version 17.0 for Windows). Results are presented as mean ± S.D. Analysis of variance and the Tukey-Kramer multiple-comparison test were used in comparisons. The unpaired two-tailed Student's t test was used for the comparison of parameters between two groups in human lung adenocarcinoma tissue microarray chips, as described previously (23.Yang D. Li L.

However, the majority of the experiments were performed by overexpression of PNAS-4, which may cause artifacts. To rule out this possibility, we decided to investigate whether PNAS-4 has some clinical significance in lung cancers. We determined the expression of hPNAS-4 in human lung cancer tissues and their adjacent lung tissues by immunohistochemistry staining of human lung adenocarcinoma TMA chips with anti-PNAS-4 antibody. The array included the cancer tissue samples and corresponding adjacent normal tissue samples from 55 lung cancer patients. The patients consisted of 30 males and 25 females. The PNAS-4 levels in the tissue array specimens were assessed by measurement of the relative staining density. According to the intensity of staining, we classified the samples into four groups with increasing staining intensity from weak (+) to medium (++), strong (+++), and strongest (++++). If hPNAS-4 expression was low, the sample would be classified into groups 1 (+) and 2 (++). If hPNAS-4 expression was high, the sample would fall into groups 3 (+++) and 4 (++++). As shown in Fig. 1, A–D, we found that in the cancer tissues, 33 cases exhibited weak immunopositivity (60%), 14 cases exhibited moderate immunopositivity (25.5%), 7 cases exhibited strong immunopositivity (12.7%), and one case exhibited the strongest immunopositivity (1.8%), whereas in the adjacent lung tissues, one case exhibited weak immunopositivity (1.9%), 7 cases exhibited moderate immunopositivity (13.2%), 20 cases exhibited strong immunopositivity (37.7%), and 25 cases exhibited the strongest immunopositivity (47.2%). Based on these data, we found that PNAS-4 expression was low, falling into groups 1 (+) and 2 (++), in a majority of lung cancer tissues (85.5%). But it was high, falling into groups 3 (+++) and 4 (++++) in a majority of adjacent normal tissues (84.9%). Statistical analysis (Fig. 1E) revealed that the expression levels of PNAS-4 in the tumor tissues (Fig. 1, A–D, top panels) were significantly lower than that in adjacent lung tissues (Fig. 1, A–D, bottom panels) (p < 0.001). Taken together, the current data combined with our previous observations suggested that the PNAS-4 gene may be a tumor suppressor gene and may have some important clinical significance. To test the effects of DNA-damaging agents on endogenous PNAS-4, we exposed A549 cells to apoptotic doses of cisplatin, MMS, and MMC, respectively, and then used RT-PCR (Fig. 2A) and Western blot (Fig. 2B) to analyze the expression of hPNAS-4. As shown in Fig. 2, the hPNAS-4 level was significantly increased in A549 cells treated with cisplatin, MMS, or MMC, indicating that PNAS-4 was activated during the response to DNA damage. To investigate the potentially functional significance of DNA damage- induced PNAS-4 up-regulation, we first examined whether knockdown of PNAS-4 affects DNA damage-induced checkpoint and apoptosis.

Increased expression of CCL20 is likely involved in the increased recruitment of dendritic cells observed in fibroinflammatory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). CCL20 expression is increased by the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β. We have determined that IL-1β-dependent CCL20 expression is also dependent on the multifunctional cytokine TGF-β. TGF-β is expressed in a latent form that must be activated to function, and activation is achieved through binding to the integrin αvβ8 (itgb8). Here we confirm correlative increases in αvβ8 and IL-1β with CCL20 protein in lung parenchymal lysates of a large cohort of COPD patients. How IL-1β- and αvβ8-mediated TGF-β activation conspire to increase fibroblast CCL20 expression remains unknown, because these pathways have not been shown to directly interact. We evaluate the 5′-flanking region of CCL20 to determine that IL-1β-driven CCL20 expression is dependent on αvβ8-mediated activation of TGF-β. We identify a TGF-β-responsive element (i.e. SMAD) located on an upstream enhancer of the human CCL20 promoter required for efficient IL-1β-dependent CCL20 expression. By chromatin immunoprecipitation, this upstream enhancer complexes with the p50 subunit of NF-κB on a NF-κB-binding element close to the transcriptional start site of CCL20.

These synthetic functions place fibroblasts at the top of a hierarchy in controlling the shape and composition of the extracellular matrix while simultaneously facilitating immune cell trafficking in response to inflammatory stimuli. Primary human or mouse lung fibroblasts upon IL-1β stimulation increase αvβ8 expression and αvβ8-mediated TGF-β activation and CCL20 (6.Kitamura H. Cambier S. Somanath S. Barker T. Minagawa S.

Finally, increased CCL20 levels and increased numbers of DCs are associated with airway remodeling induced by CS; these increases are efficiently blocked by B5 (7.Minagawa S. Lou J. Seed R.I.

A number of questions remain: 1) Does αvβ8 play a role in driving CCL20 expression in human COPD lungs? 2) How do IL-1β- and αvβ8-mediated TGF-β activation together drive CCL20 expression in fibroblasts? 3) How important are fibroblasts as a source of CCL20? Here we confirm that αvβ8 and CCL20 expression levels correlate in COPD lung parenchyma; the IL-1β-dependent transcriptional regulation of CCL20 occurs through a previously unreported mechanism requiring αvβ8-depenent binding of SMAD4 to an upstream CCL20 enhancer element, which forms a long range complex with the p50 subunit of NF-κB located on the proximal CCL20 promoter; airway fibroblasts are a dominant source of CCL20 in COPD. These findings are the first report, to our knowledge, of a cooperative transcriptional complex containing SMAD4 and NF-κB. Informed consent was obtained from all study participants as part of an approved ongoing research protocol (11-05710) by the University of California San Francisco Committee on Human Research in full accordance with the declaration of Helsinki principles. Human lung tissues were collected from 152 Caucasian subjects with documented COPD and 83 with no evidence of COPD based on assessment of medical information from a prospectively maintained clinical database. Further clinical information was obtained from medical records where required. All tissue specimens were histologically normal, excised from adjacent tumor tissue, from patients undergoing lung resection for lung cancer. All tissues were snap frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen at the time of collection. Both COPD and non-COPD patient groups were either current or past smokers and approximately matched for age, gender, and smoking pack year history.

Ubiquitin-like modifications require the catalysis of three enzymes generally known as E1, E2, and E3. We solved the crystal structure of the E2 for the small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMO) in complex with an RWD domain and confirmed the structure using solution NMR analysis. The binding surface of RWD on Ubc9 is located near the N terminus of Ubc9 that is known to be involved in noncovalent binding of the proteins in the conjugation machinery, including a domain of E1, SUMO, and an E3 ligase. NMR data indicate that the RWD domain does not bind to SUMO and E1. The interaction between RWD and Ubc9 has a Kd of 32 ± 4 μm. Consistent with the structure and binding affinity and in contrast to a previous report, the RWD domain and RWDD3 have minimal effects on global SUMOylation.

The structural and biochemical information presented here forms the basis for further investigation of the functions of RWD-containing proteins. The RWD domain was identified more than a decade ago as a conserved domain by bioinformatic analysis of the human proteome sequence and was named after the three major families of proteins that contain this domain: RING finger-containing proteins, WD repeat-containing proteins, and DEAD (DEXD)-like helicases (1Doerks T.

The functions of RWD domains and many proteins in the RWD-containing family are not well understood. An RWD domain-containing protein, known as RSUME or RWDD3, was reported to affect post-translational modifications by the small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMO). 2The abbreviations used are: SUMOsmall ubiquitin-like modifierUFDubiquitin fold domainHSQCheteronuclear single quantum coherenceCSPchemical shift perturbation.

A single E1 and a single E2 (also known as Ubc9) are responsible for SUMOylation of all SUMO paralogues (7Yasugi T. Howley P.M.

At least two domains of E1 are involved in binding their corresponding E2s: the ubiquitin fold domain (UFD), which binds to the N-terminal region of E2, and the Cys domain, which binds to a surface near the catalytic Cys of E2 (9Wang J.

In this study, we found that the RWD domain of RWDD3 is the only well structured region in RWDD3 and is responsible for interaction of RWDD3 with Ubc9. The Ubc9 and RWD domain binding interfaces are located near their respective N termini, and the RWD-binding surface on Ubc9 overlaps with the noncovalent SUMO-binding surface on Ubc9. Therefore, it could not enhance Ubc9-SUMO noncovalent interaction, as speculated previously (2Carbia-Nagashima A. Gerez J. Perez-Castro C. Paez-Pereda M. Silberstein S. Stalla G.K. Holsboer F. Arzt E. RSUME, a small RWD-containing protein, enhances SUMO conjugation and stabilizes HIF-1alpha during hypoxia.Cell. 2007; 131: 309-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Enzymatic assays revealed that the RWD domain may alleviate the inhibitory effect of Ubc9 on the catalysis of SUMO-activating enzyme at high concentrations of the RWD domain in vitro, but this effect was not observed in cells. In contrast, slight inhibition of SUMOylation was seen in cells, consistent with the mode of interaction between RWD and Ubc9. The moderate cellular effects are consistent with the moderate binding affinity (Kd = 32 ± 4 μm). Taken together, we found that the RWD domain is an E2-interacting module, and the mode of interaction observed here could represent how an RWD domain interacts with an E2 in ubiquitin-like modifications. Human SUMO E1 (SAE1/SAE2), Ubc9, SUMO-1, SUMO-2, and GST-Sp100 were prepared as previously described (10Wang J. Hu W. Cai S. Lee B. Song J. Chen Y.

The DNA fragment encoding RWDD3 was PCR-amplified using primers that generated NdeI and XhoI upstream and downstream restriction sites, respectively. The fragment was then subcloned into the NdeI-XhoI sites of the pET28a vector. The RWD region of RWDD3 was constructed by mutating the residue immediately after the intended C-terminal region to a stop codon. Point mutations were prepared with the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and confirmed by sequencing.

Proteins were then exchanged to 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm DTT or sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 1 mm DTT for conjugation assay and NMR analysis, respectively. All SUMO conjugation assays were conducted in a mixture that contained ATP and assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1% Tween). Assay reactions were incubated at 37 °C for the times indicated in the figures and were stopped by addition of SDS loading buffer (with or without DTT). Samples were resolved on 4–12% Bis-Tris NuPAGE SDS-PAGE gels (Invitrogen), and the polypeptide bands were visualized with SimplyBlue SafeStain (Invitrogen). To examine the effect of RWDD3 and RWD on time-dependent formation of SAE2·SUMO and Ubc9·SUMO thioesters, E1 (0.80 μm), Ubc9 (17 μm), and SUMO-1 (40 μm) were incubated in the presence of either full-length RWDD3 (33 μm) or RWD (23 μm). Aliquots of the reactions were withdrawn at 0, 5, 10, 20, and 30 min after initiation of the reaction for SDS-PAGE analysis. To determine the Ubc9 concentration-dependent effect of RWD on Ubc9·SUMO thioester formation, E1 (0.50 μm), SUMO-1 (20 μm), and serial concentrations of Ubc9 (0, 2.5, 5, 10, 15, and 20 μm) were incubated in the presence of RWD (0, 5, and 50 μm). Reactions were terminated after 5 min by adding an equal volume of nonreducing SDS loading buffer. To examine the effect of RWD on the transfer of SUMO from E1 to Ubc9, E1∼SUMO thioester were formed first by incubating E1 (1 μm), and Alexa680 fluorescently labeled SUMO-1 (1 μm). After 15 min, EDTA was added to a final concentration of 30 mm to chelate Mg2+ and subsequently inhibit further ATP-dependent E1 activity. The rate of SUMO transfer from E1 to Ubc9 is fast, and thus the succeeding experiments were conducted in the cold room. All solutions used for the assay were precooled on ice. Ubc9 (0.6 μm) and RWD (0 and 50 μm) were added to the reaction mixtures containing E1·SUMO/EDTA. Aliquots were taken at different time points (0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 s), and reactions were stopped by the addition of equal volumes of nonreducing SDS gel loading buffer containing 4 m urea. The bands were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The fluorescent image of the gel was taken using a LI-COR Odyssey infrared fluorescence scanner. All NMR spectra were acquired at 25 °C on a Bruker Avance spectrometer equipped with a cryo-probe and operating at a 600-MHz 1H frequency. The Kd was estimated by titrating an incremental 0.125 molar equivalent of Ubc9 C93A to 15N-RWD WT to a final ratio of 1:2 15N-RWD:Ubc9 followed by recording 1H-15N HSQC. This experiment also provided chemical shift perturbations (CSP) on RWD upon binding Ubc9. Similarly, CSP of Ubc9 was monitored by titrating an incremental 0.125 molar equivalent of RWD to 15N-Ubc9 to a final ratio of 1:2 15N-Ubc9:RWD followed by recording 1H-15N HSQC. Binding studies of RWD on SUMO, SAE Cys domain and SAE UFD fold were also followed by NMR titration experiments to a final ratio of 1:1.2 of 15N-RWD:SUMO-1, 15N-SAE Cys domain:RWD, and 15N-RWD:SAE UFD fold, respectively. Displacement titration was carried out to determine whether RWD can disrupt the noncovalent interaction of Ubc9 and SUMO. 15N-Ubc9 was titrated with SUMO-1 to a final molar ratio of 1:1, and the 15N-Ubc9-SUMO-1 complex was subsequently titrated with incremental addition of RWD to a final molar ratio of 1:1:1 (15N-Ubc9:SUMO:RWD). All NMR data were processed using NMRPipe and analyzed with the program Sparky. GST-Sp100 (241–360) was labeled with [S35]methionine by in vitro transcription and translation system (TnT coupled wheat germ extract system; Promega), following the manufacturer's instructions. After that, 5 μl of [S35]methionine-labeled GST-Sp100 was mixed with purified E1 (0.1 μm), Ubc9 (17 μm), SUMO-1 (15 μm), RWD, or RWDD3 at the indicated concentrations to perform in vitro SUMO conjugation assay. The reactions were then incubated at 37 °C for 15 min, and the results were verified by SDS-PAGE separation and autoradiography. pCDNA3.1, pCDNA3-RWD, and pCDNA3-RWDD3 DNAs were transfected into HEK293T cells by Lipofectamine LTX (Life Technologies Inc.) for 48 h. Both RWD and RWDD3 protein have Flag tags at their N termini. The cells were harvested, and the total proteins were first separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by transferring to PVDF membrane. The membrane was first blocked with Odyssey Blocking Buffer (LI-COR) and then blotted by anti-SUMO-2/3 (1:1000; Millipore), HIF1α (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology), Flag (1:1000; Clontech), and GAPDH (1:1000; Santa Cruz) antibodies. After three washes with 1× PBST buffer (3.2 mm Na2HPO4, 0.5 mm KH2PO4, 1.3 mm KCl, 135 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.4), the fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies were then used, and the results were visualized by Odyssey Quantitative Imaging Systems (LI-COR). Initial conditions for the optimal crystal growth were obtained by hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 20 °C using Crystal Screens 1 and 2 from Hampton Research. The complex was prepared by mixing Ubc9 and RWD to a final concentration of 13–18 mg/ml at ∼1:1 stoichiometry. Different volume ratios of protein complex to reservoir solution (1:1, 2:1, and 1:2) were mixed and equilibrated against 500 μl of reservoir solution. Crystals of Ubc9-RWD heterotrimer complex displaying a flat plate morphology were obtained after 4–5 days in the optimized condition of 10% (w/v) PEG8000, 100 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 8.0, and 8% ethylene glycol at a volume ratio of 1:2 reservoir solution·Ubc9-RWD complex. The crystals were soaked in a cryoprotectant comprised of 20% glycerol in mother liquor prior to data collection. The crystals were frozen in a stream of nitrogen gas at 100 K. Diffraction data were collected at 1.5418 Å on a Rigaku MicroMax-007HF with R-AxisIV++detector (X-ray Crystallography Core Facility of City of Hope). The data were then processed with XDS and scaled with XSCALE (17Kabsch W. XDS.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (11232) Google Scholar). The structure of the RWD-Ubc9 heterotrimer was solved by molecular replacement using Molrep (18Winn M.D. Ballard C.C. Cowtan K.D. Dodson E.J. Emsley P. Evans P.R. Keegan R.M. Krissinel E.B.

The human RWDD3 protein (195 amino acid residues), also known as RSUME, has a single RWD domain located at its N terminus (residues 1–115) (2Carbia-Nagashima A. Gerez J. Perez-Castro C. Paez-Pereda M. Silberstein S. Stalla G.K. Holsboer F. Arzt E. RSUME, a small RWD-containing protein, enhances SUMO conjugation and stabilizes HIF-1alpha during hypoxia.Cell. 2007; 131: 309-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). We acquired and compared the 1H-15N HSQC spectra of both full-length RWDD3 and the RWD domain (residues 1–116) (Fig. 1A). The RWDD3 resonances had much broader line widths, indicating a much larger hydrodynamic radius than the RWD domain. However, the well dispersed resonances of RWDD3 (red) and the RWD domain (blue) overlapped well, indicating that the structure of the RWD domain is not influenced by the C-terminal segment of RWDD3. In addition, most of the RWDD3 resonances that did not overlap with the RWD domain resonances were not well dispersed and corresponded to random coil chemical shifts, suggesting that the RWDD3 region outside of the RWD domain is disordered. The disordered C terminus of RWDD3 likely contributes to its large hydrodynamic radius, resulting in the broad line widths observed for the RWDD3 resonances. Next, we investigated whether the RWD domain is responsible for the reported RWDD3 SUMOylation enhancement effect. To do this, we evaluated the formation rates of the thioester conjugates between SUMO and E2 (Ubc9). Formation of both thioesters is stimulated by RWDD3, as found previously (2Carbia-Nagashima A. Gerez J. Perez-Castro C. Paez-Pereda M. Silberstein S. Stalla G.K. Holsboer F. Arzt E. RSUME, a small RWD-containing protein, enhances SUMO conjugation and stabilizes HIF-1alpha during hypoxia.Cell. 2007; 131: 309-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Samples of the conjugation reactions were taken at multiple time points (0, 5, 10, 20, and 30 min) in the presence and absence of RWDD3 or the RWD domain. RWDD3 and the RWD domain similarly stimulated formation of the Ubc9·SUMO thioester conjugate (Fig. 1B). Consistently, they similarly stimulated formation of the SAE2·SUMO thioester and SAE2-SUMO isopeptide (Fig. 1B). Both SAE2 conjugates are dependent on the Ubc9·SUMO thioester. SAE2-SUMO isopeptide conjugate is dependent on the amount of E2·SUMO thioester (21Truong K. Lee T.D. Chen Y. Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) modification of E1 Cys domain inhibits E1 Cys domain enzymatic activity.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 15154-15163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In addition, the transfer of SUMO from E1 to E2 is reversible, and thus increased Ubc9·SUMO thioester conjugate leads to the increased SAE2·SUMO thioester conjugate. Taken together, the RWD domain is critical for binding Ubc9 and is responsible for the reported in vitro effect on SUMOylationenhancement by the RWDD3 splice variants (22Gerez J. Fuertes M. Tedesco L. Silberstein S. Sevlever G. Paez-Pereda M. Holsboer F. Turjanski A.G. Arzt E. In silico structural and functional characterization of the RSUME splice variants.PLoS One. 2013; 8: e57795Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Because the RWD domain had a similar effect on SUMOylation as RWDD3, we used the RWD domain for structural investigations of how it interacts with Ubc9. We obtained crystals of the complex between Ubc9 and the RWD domain of RWDD3 that diffracted to ∼2.7 Å, and the crystal structure was solved by molecular replacement. We observed a heterotrimeric complex with two Ubc9 molecules and one RWD domain in the asymmetric unit (Fig. 2A and Table 1). Through multiple rounds, the structure was built and refined with good overall stereochemical values (Table 1). Based on the model, the N-terminal surface of Ubc9 is independently involved in an interface that forms an asymmetric homodimer with a second Ubc9 and an interface that binds to RWD. The second interface of Ubc9 that participates in the homodimer formation is adjacent to the catalytic Cys-93.TABLE 1Data collection and processing statistics for the RWD-Ubc9 complexData collectionSpace groupP1 21 1Cell dimensionsa, b, c (Å)63.23, 34.86, 114.51α, β, γ (°)90.0, 98.53, 90.0Resolution (Å)33.32-2.77 (2.77-2.70)aHighest resolution shell is shown in parentheses.Rmeas0.112 (1.103)I/σ(I)12.8 (1.4)Completeness (%)99.5 (100.0)Redundancy3.2 (3.3)RefinementResolution (Å)2.70No. reflections13,981Rwork/Rfree21.6/25.4No. atomsProtein3310Water56Root mean square deviationBond lengths (Å)0.003Bond angles (°)0.705Ramachandran statisticsFavored95.19Allowed3.37Disallowed1.44a Highest resolution shell is shown in parentheses. Open table in a new tab The interactions observed in the crystal structure were further validated by NMR CSP. 15N-Labeled Ubc9 was titrated with unlabeled RWD domain, or 15N-labeled RWD domain was titrated with unlabeled Ubc9, and then CSP was monitored using 1H-15N HSQC spectra (Fig. 2, B and C). The weighted CSP upon the complex formation was plotted for each residue of Ubc9 (Fig. 2B) and the RWD domain (Fig. 2C) (excluding Pro and overlapping resonances). Residues 7–10, 26, and 36–37 of Ubc9 exhibited the largest CSPs (Fig. 2B), which are consistent with the RWD-Ubc9 interaction observed in the crystal structure. In addition, CSP on Ubc9 was observed on residues at the homodimer interface near the catalytic Cys-93, i.e. Thr-135. In particular, the resonances of Thr-135 showed increased intensity as well as CSP, despite the fact that complex formation is expected to reduce the overall NMR resonance intensity caused by broadened line widths (Fig. 2B). The broadened resonances in the absence of the RWD domain indicate monomer-oligomer equilibrium, and the sharpened resonance upon addition of the RWD domain suggests its blockage of the N terminus of Ubc9 for Ubc9-Ubc9 dimer formation. For the RWD domain, residues 11–16 and 100–102 showed significant CSP that is consistent with the binding interface observed in the crystal structure (Fig. 2, A and C). Taken together, NMR data verified that the crystal structure exists in solution. Ubc9 and RWD domain have interfaces that are complementary in both charge and shape (Fig. 3A). The binding interface on Ubc9 has a positive electrostatic potential, whereas the binding interface on RWD has a negative electrostatic potential (Fig. 3A). The interaction is facilitated by charge interactions between Arg-13, Lys-14, Arg-17, and Lys-18 of Ubc9 and Glu-7, Glu-8, Glu-97, and Glu-102 of the RWD domain (Fig. 3B). Hydrophobic and polar residues, such as Leu-6, Ala-10, Thr-35, and Leu-38 of Ubc9 and Val-11, Ile-15, His-101, and Leu-105 of RWD, contribute to the van der Waals contacts (Fig. 3B). The C terminus of the RWD domain faces away from the Ubc9 binding surface (Fig. 3A), and thus the full-length RWDD3, which contains an unstructured C-terminal extension from the RWD domain, likely interacts with Ubc9 in a similar manner as the RWD domain, and the unstructured C-terminal segment is unlikely to affect the RWD-Ubc9 interaction. This is consistent with the similar effects of the RWD and RWDD3 on SUMOylation (Fig. 1B). The dissociation constant (Kd) of the RWD and Ubc9 interaction was estimated as 32 ± 4 μm, using five residues in the RWD domain that displayed the largest chemical shift perturbations (Ala-13, Ala-14, Ile-15, Val-100, and Glu-102) (Fig. 3C). The RWD domain binds to a surface of Ubc9 that is the “hot spot” for interactions with other proteins of the conjugation pathway (E1, SUMO and E3). The RWD-binding surface on Ubc9 overlaps with the surface that binds the UFD of SAE2 (9Wang J. Cai S. Chen Y. Mechanism of E1-E2 interaction for the inhibition of Ubl adenylation.J. Biol.

Thus, there is an urgent need to assess their ecological and genetic distinctiveness and determine if Sundarbans tigers should be defined and managed as separate conservation unit. We utilized nine microsatellites and 3 kb from four mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genes to estimate genetic variability, population structure, demographic parameters and visualize historic and contemporary connectivity among tiger populations from Sundarbans and mainland India. We also evaluated the traits that determine exchangeability or adaptive differences among tiger populations. Data from both markers suggest that Sundarbans tiger is not a separate tiger subspecies and should be regarded as Bengal tiger (P. t. tigris) subspecies. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses of the mtDNA data revealed reciprocal monophyly. Genetic differentiation was found stronger for mtDNA than nuclear DNA. Microsatellite markers indicated low genetic variation in Sundarbans tigers (He= 0.58) as compared to other mainland populations, such as northern and Peninsular (Hebetween 0.67- 0.70). Molecular data supports migration between mainland and Sundarbans populations until very recent times. We attribute this reduction in gene flow to accelerated fragmentation and habitat alteration in the landscape over the past few centuries. Demographic analyses suggest that Sundarbans tigers have diverged recently from peninsular tiger population within last 2000 years. Sundarbans tigers are the most divergent group of Bengal tigers, and ecologically non-exchangeable with other tiger populations, and thus should be managed as a separate “evolutionarily significant unit” (ESU) following the adaptive evolutionary conservation (AEC) concept."

https://openalex.org/W2032631943,"Copy-number variations (CNV), loss of heterozygosity (LOH), and uniparental disomy (UPD) are large genomic aberrations leading to many common inherited diseases, cancers, and other complex diseases. An integrated tool to identify these aberrations is essential in understanding diseases and in designing clinical interventions. Previous discovery methods based on whole-genome sequencing (WGS) require very high depth of coverage on the whole genome scale, and are cost-wise inefficient. Another approach, whole exome genome sequencing (WEGS), is limited to discovering variations within exons. Thus, we are lacking efficient methods to detect genomic aberrations on the whole genome scale using next-generation sequencing technology. Here we present a method to identify genome-wide CNV, LOH and UPD for the human genome via selectively sequencing a small portion of genome termed Selected Target Regions (SeTRs). In our experiments, the SeTRs are covered by 99.73%~99.95% with sufficient depth. Our developed bioinformatics pipeline calls genome-wide CNVs with high confidence, revealing 8 credible events of LOH and 3 UPD events larger than 5M from 15 individual samples. We demonstrate that genome-wide CNV, LOH and UPD can be detected using a cost-effective SeTRs sequencing approach, and that LOH and UPD can be identified using just a sample grouping technique, without using a matched sample or familial information."

In cells, COT kinase forms a heterotrimeric complex together with NF-κB transcription factor p105 and A20-binding inhibitor of NF-κB (ABIN-2). COT kinase is activated by IκB kinase β (IKKβ), which triggers proteasome-dependent degradation of p105 to p50 and disassembly of the ternary complex (1.Beinke S. Robinson M.J. Hugunin M. Ley S.C.

Careful selection of protein constructs and optimizations in the protein production procedures allowed us to obtain pure enzyme of exquisite biochemical activity. In this study, we additionally report on two new COT kinase inhibitors, 5-(5-(1H-indol-3-yl)-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridin-3-yl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-amine (2) and 5-(2-amino-5-(quinolin-3-yl)pyridin-3-yl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole-2(3H)-thione (3), that display nanomolar inhibitory activity of substrate phosphorylation in our biochemical assay. We also present the first atomic resolution x-ray crystal structures of the human COT kinase domain as complexes with the two inhibitors. These structures reveal that COT kinase adopts a unique and unexpected kinase domain fold. The P-loop (also known as glycine-rich loop) is preceded by a 15-amino acid insert, which turned out to be a central modulator of the size and chemical characteristics of the active site. In addition, the active site of COT kinase is structurally more flexible than previously anticipated. The results presented in this study provide a basis for enzyme production and the design of novel, potent, and selective COT kinase inhibitors. For protein production and crystallization, all chemicals, unless stated otherwise, were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The DNA sequence, containing codons optimized for insect cell expression, for full-length human COT kinase (UniProt P41279) was ordered from GeneArt and used as a template for creating truncated variants encompassing the kinase domain. Constructs coding for amino acids 66–395 and 30–404, having an N-terminal hexahistidine tag followed by a PreScission protease cleavage site, were designed and subcloned into a transfer plasmid containing a proximal polyhedrin promotor. Sf21 cells were co-transfected with pFlashbac virus DNA (Oxford Expression Technologies) for baculovirus generation according to the vendor's recommendation. Protein expression was carried out in 1-liter cell cultures of Sf21 cells with plaque-purified viruses. To improve the yields of overexpressed protein, compound 1 was added to the culture at a final concentration of 10 μm at 24 h after infection. Cells were harvested 72 h after infection, and the pellets were frozen and stored at −80 °C. The pellets of 50 g of cells containing overexpressed COT(aa66–395) or COT(aa30–404) were resuspended in 300 ml of lysis buffer (0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.003 m tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP), 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.4 m NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100, and Complete, EDTA-free (Roche Applied Science)). Compound 1 (dissolved in DMSO) was added to a final concentration of 20 μm followed by homogenization of the lysate. Cleared lysates were applied on a Ni-NTA column (Qiagen) equilibrated in buffer A (0.025 m Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.003 m tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.4 m NaCl, 0.01 m imidazole). The column was washed extensively with buffer A, followed by another wash step with modified buffer A containing 0.2 m NaCl. The protein was eluted by applying an imidazole gradient from 20 to 290 mm imidazole, and fractions containing the kinase were pooled. Exchange of compound 1 and cleavage of the His6 tag were carried out simultaneously overnight in the presence of 1 mm EDTA, PreScission protease and an excess of new ligand. The final purification step was carried out by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 75 HiLoad 16/60 column (GE Healthcare). Fractions containing the protein·ligand complex were pooled and concentrated to a final concentration of about 4 mg/ml. Both COT·ligand complexes were concentrated to 3.5 mg/ml using an Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter with 10,000 molecular weight cut-off (Millipore) before crystallization by vapor diffusion. Hanging drops consisting of an equal ratio of complex to reservoir solution (1 μl) were set up and equilibrated against 500 μl of reservoir solution containing either 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.2, 24% (w/v) PEG monomethyl ether 500 (PEGMME500), and 0.05 m MgCl2 (COT·compound 2) or 8% (w/v) PEG4000, 12% (v/v) ethylene glycol and 7% (v/v) isopropyl alcohol (COT·compound 3) in a 24-well VDX plate (Hampton Research) at room temperature. Crystals grew within 2 days and were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, either directly after harvest from the mother liquor (COT·compound 2) or after a quick dip into a reservoir solution containing 10% (v/v) glycerol (COT·compound 3). Diffraction data were collected at 100 K at the Swiss Light Source beamline X10SA at 1.0 Å wavelength. Diffraction images were recorded on a MAR225 CCD detector (MAR Research) and processed and scaled with XDS and XSCALE (23.Kabsch W. Xds. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

The COT kinase·compound 2 structure was solved by molecular replacement. A BLAST search was carried out against the Protein Data Bank (PDB) using the human COT kinase amino acid sequence (UniProt P41279) including residues 66–395, and coordinates of the top 99 search results were downloaded. Sequence alignments of the downloaded hits with COT kinase residues 66–395 were created using FASTA (24.Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Improved tools for biological sequence comparison.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9378) Google Scholar). To create the search models for molecular replacement, the coordinate files were prepared with Chainsaw, which is part of the CCP4 software suite (25.Winn M.D. Ballard C.C. Cowtan K.D. Dodson E.J.

Open table in a new tab All assays were performed in 384-well microtiter plates using automated liquid dispensing. The assay plates were prepared by the addition of 50 nl/well of compound solution in 90% (v/v) DMSO.

Kinase reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 60 min and subsequently terminated by the addition of 16 μl/well of stop solution (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5% (v/v) DMSO, 0.1% (v/v) Caliper coating reagent, 10 mm EDTA, and 0.015% (w/v) Brij35). Plates with terminated kinase reactions were transferred to the Caliper LC3000 workstations for reading. Phosphorylated and unphosphorylated peptides were separated and quantified using the Caliper microfluidic mobility shift technology. A detailed protocol for the syntheses of (E)-3-(2-amino-5-(naphthalen-2-yl)pyridin-3-yl)acrylic acid (1), 5-(5-(1H-indol-3-yl)-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridin-3-yl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-amine (2) and 5-(2-amino-5-(quinolin-3-yl)pyridin-3-yl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole-2(3H)-thione (3) (see Fig. 1) can be found in the supplemental information. A series of DNA plasmids encoding hexahistidine-tagged human COT kinase domain with varying N and C termini was subjected to small scale expression tests in baculovirus-infected Sf21 insect cells. Two constructs, one encompassing amino acid residues 30–404 (aa30–404) and the other one encompassing amino acid residues 66–395 (aa66–395), were identified in a first round of expression experiments to yield soluble but heterogeneously phosphorylated protein. It has been reported previously that expression yields of kinases in baculovirus-infected insect cells can be improved by the addition of specific small molecular weight kinase inhibitors to the cell cultivation medium (31.Strauss A. Fendrich G. Horisberger M.A. Liebetanz J. Meyhack B. Schlaeppi J.M. Schmitz R. Improved expression of kinases in Baculovirus-infected insect cells upon addition of specific kinase inhibitors to the culture helpful for structural studies.Protein Expr. Purif. 2007; 56: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). For both constructs, the addition of the ATP-competitive inhibitor 1 during fermentation and initial purification was essential to increase the overall yield as well as to reduce heterogeneous phosphorylation. In the absence of compound 1, about 0.2 mg of 65% non-phosphorylated and soluble COT kinase (aa30–404) was isolated per liter of cell culture volume after a nickel affinity purification step. The addition of compound 1 greatly enhanced this yield to 4–6 mg of protein per liter of cell culture. Purified COT protein was found 90% non-phosphorylated after the addition of compound 1, suggesting that compound 1 blocks COT kinase autophosphorylation (Table 2). A second construct (aa66–395) was identified using a similar approach and yielded about 2 mg/liter of cell culture after the first purification step. It was possible to quantitatively exchange compound 1 by other ATP site binders by chromatography or to remove it completely to prepare apo-form enzyme (see “Experimental Procedures”).TABLE 2Optimization of human COT kinase (aa30–404) expression in Sf21 insect cellsCompound 1Form of additionTime of additionCultivation time [h]Ni-NTA yieldPhosphorylation in %0×1×2×μmmg0NANA640.2–0.365251030Diluted into medium, sterile filteredAt infection632.48416010DMSO stock diluted into cultureAt infection644.28911010DMSO stock diluted into culture24 h after infection64790100 Open table in a new tab The use of radioactive filter binding and homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence assays to measure COT kinase activity has been described before (32.Jia Y.

Biophys. 2005; 441: 64-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). For this study, we developed an assay that measures in vitro phosphorylation of a peptide substrate. Enzyme reactions were carried out in 384-well plates. We used the Caliper microfluidic mobility shift technology to quantitatively separate phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated substrate peptides (supplemental Fig. 1). With this experimental setup, the half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50 values) of a large variety of compounds were measured at compound concentrations of up to 10 μm. Chemical derivation of a hit obtained from high throughput screening resulted in the discovery of the two COT inhibitors 2 and 3 discussed in this study (Fig. 1). Both compounds show low nanomolar inhibitory activity of COT kinase in the enzymatic Caliper assay with IC50 values of 13 nm for compound 2 and 17 nm for compound 3. Both protein variants mentioned above were subjected to extensive crystallization experiments, and COT kinase (aa66–396) yielded well diffracting crystals. We determined the x-ray co-crystal structures of the human COT kinase domain in complex with compound 2 at 2.3 Å resolution. The crystal structure of this complex has a refined model that includes residues 73–93, 103–139, and 143–392 (Table 1). Another co-crystal of the same human COT kinase domain was solved in complex with compound 3 at a resolution of 2.9 Å. The model of this co-crystal structure contains residues 73–92, 102–331, and 343–389 (Table 1). Both structures revealed a bilobed kinase domain fold (Fig. 2) with an N-terminal extension that is similar to the one observed in the crystal structure of nuclear factor κB-inducing kinase (PDB entry 4DN5) (33.Liu J.

We find that matured game currencies have price stability similar to that of small size equities or gold, and their transaction costs are sometimes lower than real currencies. Assuming that virtual currencies with a longer history can provide an estimate for Bitcoin's prospects, we project that Bitcoin will be less influenced by speculative trades and become a low cost alternative to real currencies."

The genetic diversity of C. albicans has been rarely studied in China. In the present study, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was used to characterize the genetic diversity and population structure of 62 C. albicans isolates collected from 40 patients from Huashan Hospital in Shanghai, China. A total of 50 diploid sequence types (DSTs) were identified in the 62 C. albicans isolates, with 41 newly identified DSTs. Based on cluster analysis, the 62 isolates were classified into nine existing clades and two new clades (namely clades New 1 and New 2). The majority of the isolates were clustered into three clades, clade 6 (37.5%), clade 1 (15.0%) and clade 17 (15.0%). Isolates of clade New 2 were specifically identified in East Asia. We identified three cases of potential nosocomial transmission based on association analysis between patients’ clinical data and the genotypes of corresponding isolates. Finally, by analyzing the genotypes of serial isolates we further demonstrated that the microevolution of C. albicans was due to loss of heterozygosity. Our study represents the first molecular typing of C. albicans in eastern China, and we confirmed that MLST is a useful tool for studying the epidemiology and evolution of C. albicans."

Barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) silencing vectors containing an endogenous phytoene desaturase (PDS) gene fragment were agroinfiltrated into young leaves of Z. zerumbet under controlled growth conditions to effect virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS). Infiltrated leaves as well as newly emerged leaves and tillers showed visual signs of PDS silencing after 30 days. Replication and systemic movement of the viral vectors in silenced plants were confirmed by RT-PCR. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis verified significant down-regulation of PDS transcripts in the silenced tissues. Label-free proteomic analysis was conducted in leaves with established PDS transcript down regulation and buffer-infiltrated (mock) leaves. A total of 474 proteins were obtained, which were up-regulated, down-regulated or modulated de novo during VIGS. Most of these proteins were localized to the chloroplast, as revealed by UniprotKB analysis, and among the up-regulated proteins there were abiotic stress responsive, photosynthetic, metabolic and membrane proteins. Moreover, the demonstration of viral proteins together with host proteins proved successful viral infection. We report for the first time the establishment of a high-throughput gene functional analysis platform using BSMV-mediated VIGS in Z. zerumbet, as well as proteomic changes associated with VIGS."

Using metabolomics and advanced microscopy we determined specific target pathways in the Rlv metabolic network and consequent changes to its phenotype, surface ultrastructure, and physical properties during sublethal 2,4-D exposure. Auxin and 2,4-D, its structural analogue, showed common morphological changes in vitro which were similar to bacteroids isolated from plant nodules, implying that these changes are related to bacteroid differentiation required for nitrogen fixation. Rlv showed remarkable adaptation capabilities in response to the herbicide, with changes to integral pathways of cellular metabolism and the potential to assimilate 2,4-D with consequent changes to its physical and structural properties. This study identifies biomarkers of 2,4-D in Rlv and offers valuable insights into the mode-of-action of 2,4-D in soil bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2016257897,"There is growing concern that interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs) are being used off-label for the diagnosis of active tuberculosis (TB) disease in many high-burden settings, including India, where the background prevalence of latent TB infection is high. We analyzed the costs and consequences of using IGRAs for the diagnosis of active TB in India from the perspective of the Indian TB control sector.We constructed a decision analytic model to estimate the incremental cost and effectiveness of IGRAs for the diagnosis of active TB in India. We compared a reference scenario of clinical examination and non-microbiological tests against scenarios in which clinical diagnosis was augmented by the addition of either sputum smear microscopy, IGRA, or Xpert MTB/RIF. We examined costs (in 2013 US dollars) and consequences from the perspective of the Indian healthcare sector. Relative to sputum smear microscopy, use of IGRA for active TB resulted in 23,700 (95% uncertainty range, UR: 3,800 - 38,300) additional true-positive diagnoses, but at the expense of 315,700 (95% UR: 118,300 - 388,400) additional false-positive diagnoses and an incremental cost of US$49.3 million (95% UR: $34.9 - $58.0 million) (2.9 billion Indian Rupees). Relative to Xpert MTB/RIF (including the cost of treatment for drug resistant TB), use of IGRA led to 400 additional TB cases treated (95% UR: [-8,000] - 16,200), 370,600 (95% UR: 252,200 - 441,700) more false-positive diagnoses, 70,400 (95% UR: [-7,900] - 247,200) fewer disability-adjusted life years averted, and US$14.6 million (95%UR: [-$7.2] - $28.7 million) (854 million Indian Rupees) in additional costs.Using IGRAs for diagnosis of active TB in a setting like India results in tremendous overtreatment of people without TB, and substantial incremental cost with little gain in health. These results support the policies by WHO and Standards for TB Care in India, which discourage the use of IGRAs for the diagnosis of active TB in India and similar settings."

https://openalex.org/W1999469863,"Three-dimensional tissues, such as the cornea, are now being engineered as substitutes for the rehabilitation of vision in patients with blinding corneal diseases. Engineering of tissues for translational purposes requires a non-invasive monitoring to control the quality of the resulting biomaterial. Unfortunately, most current methods still imply invasive steps, such as fixation and staining, to clearly observe the tissue-engineered cornea, a transparent tissue with weak natural contrast. Second- and third-harmonic generation imaging are well known to provide high-contrast, high spatial resolution images of such tissues, by taking advantage of the endogenous contrast agents of the tissue itself. In this article, we imaged tissue-engineered corneal substitutes using both harmonic microscopy and classic histopathology techniques. We demonstrate that second- and third-harmonic imaging can non-invasively provide important information regarding the quality and the integrity of these partial-thickness posterior corneal substitutes (observation of collagen network, fibroblasts and endothelial cells). These two nonlinear imaging modalities offer the new opportunity of monitoring the engineered corneas during the entire process of production."
https://openalex.org/W2038060920,"Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), members of the TGF-β superfamily, have numerous biological activities including control of growth, differentiation, and vascular development. Using an in vitro co-culture endothelial cord formation assay, we investigated the role of a BMP7 variant (BMP7v) in VEGF, bFGF, and tumor-driven angiogenesis. BMP7v treatment led to disruption of neo-endothelial cord formation and regression of existing VEGF and bFGF cords in vitro. Using a series of tumor cell models capable of driving angiogenesis in vitro, BMP7v treatment completely blocked cord formation. Pre-treatment of endothelial cells with BMP7v significantly reduced their cord forming ability, indicating a direct effect on endothelial cell function. BMP7v activated the canonical SMAD signaling pathway in endothelial cells but targeted gene knockdown using shRNA directed against SMAD4 suggests this pathway is not required to mediate the anti-angiogenic effect. In contrast to SMAD activation, BMP7v selectively decreased ERK and AKT activation, significantly decreased endothelial cell migration and down-regulated expression of critical RTKs involved in VEGF and FGF angiogenic signaling, VEGFR2 and FGFR1 respectively. Importantly, in an in vivo angiogenic plug assay that serves as a measurement of angiogenesis, BMP7v significantly decreased hemoglobin content indicating inhibition of neoangiogenesis. In addition, BMP7v significantly decreased angiogenesis in glioblastoma stem-like cell (GSLC) Matrigel plugs and significantly impaired in vivo growth of a GSLC xenograft with a concomitant reduction in microvessel density. These data support BMP7v as a potent anti-angiogenic molecule that is effective in the context of tumor angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2132410278,"The optimisation of haematopoietic stem and progenitor cell expansion is on demand in modern cell therapy. In this work, haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) have been selected from unmanipulated cord blood mononuclear cells (cbMNCs) due to adhesion to human adipose-tissue derived stromal cells (ASCs) under standard (20%) and tissue-related (5%) oxygen. ASCs efficiently maintained viability and supported further HSPC expansion at 20% and 5% O2. During co-culture with ASCs, a new floating population of differently committed HSPCs (HSPCs-1) grew. This suspension was enriched with СD34+ cells up to 6 (20% O2) and 8 (5% O2) times. Functional analysis of HSPCs-1 revealed cobble-stone area forming cells (CAFCs) and lineage-restricted colony-forming cells (CFCs). The number of CFCs was 1.6 times higher at tissue-related O2, than in standard cultivation (20% O2). This increase was related to a rise in the number of multipotent precursors - BFU-E, CFU-GEMM and CFU-GM. These changes were at least partly ensured by the increased concentration of MCP-1 and IL-8 at 5% O2. In summary, our data demonstrated that human ASCs enables the selection of functionally active HSPCs from unfractionated cbMNCs, the further expansion of which without exogenous cytokines provides enrichment with CD34+ cells. ASCs efficiently support the viability and proliferation of cord blood haematopoietic progenitors of different commitment at standard and tissue-related O2 levels at the expense of direct and paracrine cell-to-cell interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1967353676,"Objectives To identify the pulmonary hypertension (PH) patients who develop an exercise induced venous-to-systemic shunt (EIS) by performing the cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), analyse the changes of CPET measurements during exercise and compare the exercise physiology and resting pulmonary hemodynamics between shunt-PH and no-shunt-PH patients. Methods Retrospectively, resting pulmonary function test (PFT), right heart catheterization (RHC), and CPET for clinical evaluation of 104 PH patients were studied. Results Considering all 104 PH patients by three investigators, 37 were early EIS+, 61 were EIS-, 3 were late EIS+, and 3 others were placed in the discordant group. PeakVO2, AT and OUES were all reduced in the shunt-PH patients compared with the no-shunt-PH subjects, whereas VE/VCO2 slope and the lowest VE/VCO2 increased. Besides, the changes and the response characteristics of the key CPET parameters at the beginning of exercise in the shunt group were notably different from those of the no shunt one. At cardiac catheterization, the shunt patients had significantly increased mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP), mean right atrial pressure (mRAP) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), reduced cardiac output (CO) and cardiac index (CI) compared with the no shunt ones (P<0.05). Resting CO was significantly correlated with exercise parameters of AT (r = 0.527, P<0.001), OUES (r = 0.410, P<0.001) and Peak VO2 (r = 0.405, P<0.001). PVR was significantly, but weakly, correlated with the above mentioned CPET parameters. In Conclusions CPET may allow a non-invasive method for detecting an EIS and assessing the severity of the disease in PH patients."
https://openalex.org/W2053730174,"Background This study contrasted annual rates of difficult behaviours in emergency departments among cohorts of individuals who were homeless and low-income housed and examined predictors of these events. Methods Interviews in 1999 with men who were chronically homeless with drinking problems (CHDP) (n = 50), men from the general homeless population (GH) (n = 61), and men residing in low-income housing (LIH) (n = 58) were linked to catchment area emergency department records (n = 2817) from 1994 to 1999. Interview and hospital data were linked to measures of difficult behaviours. Results Among the CHDP group, annual rates of visits with difficult behaviours were 5.46; this was 13.4 (95% CI 10.3–16.5) and 14.3 (95% CI 11.2–17.3) times higher than the GH and LIH groups. Difficult behaviour incidents included physical violence, verbal abuse, uncooperativeness, drug seeking, difficult histories and security involvement. Difficult behaviours made up 57.54% (95% CI 55.43–59.65%), 24% (95% CI 19–29%), and 20% (95% CI 16–24%) of CHDP, GH and LIH visits. Among GH and LIH groups, 87% to 95% were never involved in verbal abuse or violence. Intoxication increased all difficult behaviours while decreasing drug seeking and leaving without being seen. Verbal abuse and violence were less likely among those housed, with odds ratios of 0.24 (0.08, 0.72) and 0.32 (0.15, 0.69), respectively. Conclusions Violence and difficult behaviours are much higher among chronically homeless men with drinking problems than general homeless and low-income housed populations. They are concentrated among subgroups of individuals. Intoxication is the strongest predictor of difficult behaviour incidents."

To constitutively co-express a second receptor construct in these cells they were transfected with the appropriate cDNA construct, as described above, and antibiotic-resistant clones selected using 1 mg·ml−1 G418. All such cell lines were initially screened by fluorescence microscopy for receptor expression based on covalent binding of SNAP- or CLIP-tagged fluorophores and subsequently by measuring specific binding of [3H]QNB in cell membrane preparations. Cells treated or not with doxycycline, were harvested after 24 h, in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and pellets were frozen at −80 °C for a minimum of 1 h. Pellets were thawed and resuspended in ice-cold 10 mm Tris, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4 (TE) buffer, supplemented with CompleteTM protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). Cells were passed through a 25-gauge needle (5–10 times) and then homogenized on ice, by 50 strokes in a glass-on-teflon homogenizer. Homogenized cells were centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant fraction was removed and transferred to microcentrifuge tubes and subjected to further centrifugation at 90,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. The pellets were resuspended in TE buffer, and protein concentration was assessed. Membrane preparations were either used directly or kept at −80 °C until required. Binding using various concentrations of [3H]QNB was carried out using 5 μg of membrane protein per reaction in assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4). Nonspecific binding was defined in the presence of 10 μm atropine. Reactions were incubated for 2 h at 30 °C. Bound ligand was separated from free by vacuum filtration through GF/C filters (Brandel Inc.). The filters were washed twice with assay buffer, and bound ligand was estimated by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Cells were harvested, washed twice in ice cold PBS, and pelleted by centrifugation. The pellets were resuspended in radio-immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 10 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaH2PO4, 5% ethylene glycol, pH 7.4), supplemented with CompleteTM protease inhibitors mixture. Resuspended cells were then placed on a rotating wheel for 30 min at 4 °C, and subsequently centrifuged at 21,000 × g, for 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were collected, and the protein concentration of the lysates determined. Samples were heated at 60–65 °C in 1× Laemmli buffer (10% w/v SDS, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 20% v/v glycerol, 0.2 m Tris-HCl, 0.05% w/v bromphenol blue, pH 6.8). The required amount of protein lysate was then loaded on 4–12% NuPAGETM Novex® Bis-Tris gels (Life Technologies). Following electrophoresis, proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, blocked, and subsequently incubated with the primary antibody/antiserum in 5% fat-free milk TBST (2 mm Tris-base, 15 mm NaCl, and 0.1% v/v Tween 20, pH 7.4) at 4 °C, overnight. After 5 × 5 min washing steps with TBST, the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG secondary antibody was incubated with the membrane at room temperature for 1 h. Immunoblots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence solution (Pierce). Cells were seeded on poly-d-lysine pre-coated cover slips (0.0 mm thickness) to 500,000 cells per cover slip and incubated overnight in the presence or absence of doxycycline in complete DMEM. Cells that expressed HA-CLIP-hM3RASSL receptor were labeled with 5 μm CLIP-Surface 488 while those expressing VSV-SNAP-hM2WT were labeled using 5 μm SNAP-Surface 549 (New England Biolabs) in complete DMEM for 30 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were washed three times with complete DMEM and once with HEPES physiological saline solution (130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 10 mm d-glucose). Cover slips were imaged using an inverted Nikon TE2000-E microscope (Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY) equipped with a 40× (numerical aperture-1.3) oil-immersion Pan Fluor lens and a cooled digital Photometrics Cool Snap-HQ charge-coupled device camera (Roper Scientific, Trenton, NJ). Cells were grown to 100,000 per well on poly-d-lysine pre-treated 96-well solid black bottom plates (Greiner Bio-One). Cells were induced with doxycycline at the stated concentration for 24 h to express the receptor(s) of interest. After 24 h induction, cell surface receptor expression was monitored by adding 10 nm SNAP-Lumi4Tb or 20 nm CLIP-Lumi4Tb. After incubation at 37 °C/5% CO2 for 1 h, cells were washed three times with labeling medium (Cisbio Bioassays), and the fluorescence output was read at 620 nm using a PheraStar FS (BMG Lab technologies). In htrFRET experiments various combinations of energy donor:acceptor were used to detect either homomers or heteromers. Detection of hM2WT homomers was carried out by labeling with 5 nm SNAP-Lumi4Tb with varying concentrations of SNAP-Red. hM3RASSL homomers were detected by labeling with 10 nm CLIP-Lumi4Tb and varying concentrations of CLIP-Red. Heteromeric interactions between hM2WT and hM3RASSL were detected using 5 nm SNAP-Lumi4Tb with varying concentrations of CLIP-Red, or the reverse combination, 10 nm CLIP-Lumi4Tb with varying concentrations of SNAP-Red. Labeling reactions were carried out for 1 h at 37 °C/5% CO2. Cells were then washed three times with 100 μl per well labeling medium and plates were either read directly after this or further processed to test the effect of receptor ligands. For the latter experiments, ligands were added to the plates after the washing step and subsequently incubated at the noted temperature and times prior to measurements using a PheraStar FS. Both the emission signal from the SNAP-Lumi4Tb or CLIP-Lumi4Tb (620 nm) and the FRET signal emanating from the acceptor SNAP-Red or CLIP-Red (665 nm) were recorded. Specific 620 nm fluorescence, 665 nm FRET or 665:620 ratio values are shown as the difference between signals obtained from induced and un-induced cells. Cells were plated, grown, and treated with doxycycline in the same way as described in the previous section. The cells were then simultaneously labeled with three different, but spectrally compatible htrFRET substrates. One donor was used at a time, either SNAP-Lumi4Tb (5 nm) or CLIP-Lumi4Tb (10 nm), in combination with SNAP-Green (100 nm) and CLIP-Red (100 nm). The substrates were prepared at 3× the final concentrations in labeling buffer and 25 μl of each was added per well. Cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C/5% CO2 and washed three times with labeling buffer. Ligands were added to the plates and incubated at the set time points after which the plates were read using a PheraStar FS. Two different protocols were used to measure the fluorescence output corresponding to energy transfer to the two acceptors, CLIP-Red at 665 nm and SNAP-Green at 520 nm. The donor emission at 620 nm originating from either SNAP-Lumi4Tb or CLIP-Lumi4Tb was also measured in both protocols. A suspension of 10,000 cells per assay point was prepared in stimulation buffer (10 mm HEPES, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 4.2 mm KCl, 146 mm NaCl, 5.5 mm glucose, and 50 mm LiCl, pH 7.4) and incubated with ligands for 1 h at 37 °C/5% CO2 in a white Proxiplate-384 Plus (PerkinElmer). After stimulation, cells were lysed in a mixture of detection reagents prepared in lysis buffer according to the manufacturer's instructions (IP-One Tb kit, Cisbio Bioassays) and incubated for a further hour at room temperature. htrFRET was then measured using a PheraStar FS and changes in inositol monophosphate levels were calculated as ratio of 665/620 nm signals. A suspension of 4,000 cells per assay point was prepared in Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS). Cells were co-incubated with forskolin (5 μm) and ligands for 30 min in a white Proxiplate-384 Plus. This step was followed by lysis of cells using a mixture of detection reagents prepared in lysis buffer according to manufacturer's instructions (cAMP dynamic 2 kit, Cisbio Bioassays) and incubation for 1 h at room temperature. htrFRET was measured on a PheraStar FS and the reduction of cAMP levels was calculated as ratio of 665/620 nm. To explore aspects of the potential oligomerization of the wild type (WT) human (h) muscarinic M2 acetylcholine receptor, a construct (VSV-SNAP-hM2WT) was generated in which the extracellular N-terminal domain was modified to incorporate both the VSV peptide epitope tag and the SNAP protein tag sequences. This was cloned into the doxycycline-inducible locus of Flp-InTM T-RExTM 293 cells and a transfected population selected. Doxycycline-regulated expression of this construct was assessed in three distinct ways. Firstly, immunoblotting with an anti-SNAP/CLIP antiserum of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) resolved lysates of cells that had been maintained for 24 h in the presence of different concentrations of doxycycline identified specific induction of the receptor construct as a polypeptide with apparent molecular mass in the region of 80 kDa (Fig. 1A). No equivalent species was detected either in lysates of these cells grown in the absence of doxycycline or in lysates of parental, non-transfected Flp-InTM T-RExTM 293 cells (Fig. 1A). Secondly, doxycycline-induced expression and effective cell surface delivery of the construct was defined by fluorescence emission at 620 nm following excitation at 337 nm, subsequent to adding the SNAP-tag label SNAP-Lumi4Tb to intact cells. This reflects covalent attachment of the label to the SNAP tag of the construct. This is located in the extracellular milieu because the N-terminal domain of cell surface targeted GPCRs is anticipated to be outside the cell (Fig. 1B). Third, specific binding of concentrations of the muscarinic antagonist [3H]QNB, close to the Kd as assessed in saturation binding studies (0.30 ± 0.07 nm, mean ± S.E., n = 4), to membranes of doxycycline-induced VSV-SNAP-hM2WT cells generated a qualitatively similar profile as labeling of the construct with SNAP-Lumi4Tb (Fig. 1C). We have previously characterized VSV- and SNAP-tagged forms of both the WT muscarinic hM3 acetylcholine receptor and a chemically engineered, Receptor Activated Solely by Synthetic Ligand (RASSL) variant (4.Alvarez-Curto E.

Rather, it is activated by the usually inert chemical ligand clozapine N-oxide (CNO) (23.Alvarez-Curto E. Prihandoko R. Tautermann C.S. Zwier J.M. Pediani J.D. Lohse M.J. Hoffmann C. Tobin A.B.

Now, a modification of this construct to generate HA-CLIP-hM3RASSL in which the N-terminal VSV- and SNAP-tags were replaced with the HA peptide epitope tag and the CLIP protein tag sequence was generated. This was also cloned into the doxycycline-inducible locus of Flp-InTM T-RExTM 293 cells. Doxycycline-induced expression and cell surface delivery of this construct was also characterized by immunoblotting to detect each of the CLIP- and HA-tags (Fig. 2A) and, now, by the binding of CLIP-Lumi4Tb (Fig. 2B). As anticipated from the substantially larger third intracellular loop of the hM3 receptor compared with hM2, the apparent molecular mass of the predominant form of HA-CLIP-hM3RASSL identified by the SNAP/CLIP antiserum was in the region of 110 kDa (Fig. 2A). Such RASSL forms of muscarinic receptors display modestly reduced affinity for many antagonist ligands (24.Armbruster B.N. Li X. Pausch M.H. Herlitze S. Roth B.L.

Preliminary studies indicated the Kd of [3H]QNB for HA-CLIP-hM3RASSL to be in the region of 2.5 nm. Therefore, by measuring the specific binding of a substantially higher concentration of [3H]QNB (15 nm) than used for VSV-SNAP-hM2WT it was also possible to quantify expression of HA-CLIP-hM3RASSL (Fig. 2C). Noticeably, although the anti-SNAP/CLIP antiserum identified two forms of HA-CLIP-hM3RASSL, the HA antiserum identified only the more rapidly migrating and less prominent form (Fig. 2A). Pre-treatment of cells during the period of receptor induction with the de novo N-glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin demonstrated the form with lower mobility, which was not identified by the anti-HA an"
https://openalex.org/W2084665817,"Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) is an autosomal recessive disorder. The most common type OCA1 and OCA2 are caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the tyrosinase gene (TYR) and OCA2 gene, respectively.The purpose of this study was to evaluate the molecular basis of oculocutaneous albinism in four Chinese families.Four non-consanguineous OCA families were included in the study. The TYR and OCA2 genes of all individuals were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), sequenced and compared with a reference database.Four patients with a diagnosis of oculocutaneous albinism, presented with milky skin, white or light brown hair and nystagmus. Genetic analyses demonstrated that patient A was compound heterozygous for c.1037-7T.A, c.1037-10_11delTT and c.1114delG mutations in the TYR gene; patient B was heterozygous for c.593C>T and c.1426A>G mutations in the OCA2 gene, patients C and D were compound heterozygous mutations in the TYR gene (c.549_550delGT and c.896G>A, c.832C>T and c.985T>C, respectively). The heterozygous c.549_550delGT and c.1114delG alleles in the TYR gene were two novel mutations. Interestingly, heterozygous members in these pedigrees who carried c.1114delG mutations in the TYR gene or c.1426A>G mutations in the OCA2 gene presented with blond or brown hair and pale skin, but no ocular disorders when they were born; the skin of these patients accumulated pigment over time and with sun exposure.This study expands the mutation spectrum of oculocutaneous albinism. It is the first time, to the best of our knowledge, to report that c.549_550delGT and c.1114delG mutations in the TYR gene were associated with OCA. The two mutations (c.1114delG in the TYR gene and c.1426A>G in the OCA2 gene) may be responsible for partial clinical manifestations of OCA."
https://openalex.org/W1978357004,"SSB1 and SSB2 are newly identified single-stranded (ss) DNA binding proteins that play a crucial role in genome maintenance in humans. We recently generated a knockout mouse model of Ssb1 and revealed its essential role for neonatal survival. Notably, we found compensatory up-regulation of Ssb2 protein levels in multiple tissues of conditional Ssb1(-/-) mice, suggesting functional compensation between these 2 proteins. We report here the first description of Ssb2(-/-) knockout mice. Surprisingly, unlike Ssb1 knockout mice, Ssb2(-/-) mice are viable and fertile and do not exhibit marked phenotypic changes when compared with their Ssb2(+/+) and Ssb2(+/-) littermates. Notably, we did not detect any pathologic changes in the thymus, spleen, or testes, tissues with the most abundant expression of Ssb2. Moreover, Ssb2(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) did not show any sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, or defects in DNA repair capacity. However, we observed modest up-regulation of Ssb1 levels in Ssb2(-/-) MEFs as well as in Ssb2(-/-) thymus and spleen, suggesting that Ssb1 is likely able to compensate for the loss of Ssb2 in mice. Altogether, our results show that Ssb2 is dispensable for embryogenesis and adult tissue homeostasis, including thymopoiesis, splenic development, male fertility, and DNA repair in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2009339006,"This study aimed to clarify the activation characteristics of the vastus lateralis muscle in the front leg during timing correction for a sudden decrease in the velocity of a target during baseball swings. Eleven male collegiate baseball players performed coincident timing tasks that comprised constant velocity of 8 m/s (unchanged) and a sudden decrease in velocity from 8 to 4 m/s (decreased velocity). Electromyography (EMG) revealed that the muscle activation was typically monophasic when responding unchanged conditions. The type of muscle activation during swings in response to decreased velocity condition was both monophasic and biphasic. When biphasic activation appeared in response to decreased velocity, the impact time and the time to peak EMG amplitude were significantly prolonged and the timing error was significantly smaller than that of monophasic activation. However, the EMG onset from the target start was consistent both monophasic and biphasic activation in response to conditions of decreased velocity. In addition, batters with small timing errors in response to decreased velocity were more likely to generate biphasic EMG activation. These findings indicated that timing correction for a sudden decrease in the velocity of an oncoming target is achieved by modifying the muscle activation characteristics of the vastus lateralis muscle of front leg from monophasic to biphasic to delay reaching peak muscle activation and thus prolong impact time. Therefore, the present findings suggests that the extent of timing errors in response to decreased velocity is influenced by the ability to correct muscle activation after its initiation rather than by delaying the initiation timing of muscle activation during baseball swings."
https://openalex.org/W2003953650,"Rapid and reliable laboratory diagnosis of persons suspected of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection is important for timely implementation of infection control practices and disease management. In addition, monitoring molecular changes in the virus can help elucidate chains of transmission and identify mutations that might influence virus transmission efficiency. This was illustrated by a recent laboratory investigation we conducted on an imported MERS-CoV case in Greece. Two oropharyngeal swab specimens were collected on the 1st and 2nd day of patient hospitalization and tested using two real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) assays targeting the UpE and Orf-1a regions of the MERS-CoV genome and RT-PCR and partial sequencing of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and nucleocapsid genes. Serum specimens were also collected and serological test were performed. Results from the first swab sample were inconclusive while the second swab was strongly positive for MERS-CoV RNA by rRT-PCR and confirmed positive by RT-PCR and partial gene sequencing. Positive serologic test results further confirmed MERS-CoV infection. Full-length nucleocapsid and spike gene coding sequences were later obtained from the positive swab sample. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the virus was closely related to recent human-derived MERS-CoV strains obtained in Jeddah and Makkah, Saudi Arabia, in April 2014 and dromedary camels in Saudi Arabia and Qatar. These findings were consistent with the patient's history. We also identified a unique amino acid substitution in the spike receptor binding domain that may have implications for receptor binding efficiency. Our initial inconclusive rRT-PCR results highlight the importance of collecting multiple specimens from suspect MERS-CoV cases and particularly specimens from the lower respiratory tract."

Edinburgh minimal medium and amino acids were from Q-Biogen; oligonucleotides were from Integrated DNA Technologies; GelCode Blue, West Pico ECL, and Dura ECL kits were from Pierce; and HRP-conjugated, goat anti-rabbit, and goat anti-mouse antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. Protease inhibitors were from Sigma (1000× stock; leupeptin (10 mg/ml), aprotinin (28 trypsin inhibitor units/ml), pepstatin A (5 mg/ml), and PMSF (0.5 m)). Protein sequence homology analysis was performed using ExPASy LALIGN. S. pombe cells were grown in YES (5 g/liter yeast extract, 30 g/liter glucose) or Edinburgh minimal medium, both supplemented with 225 μg/ml each of uracil, adenine, leucine, histidine, and lysine at 30 °C. Temperature-sensitive strains were grown at 25 °C and transferred to non-permissive 36 °C for the indicated times. For anaerobic growth, exponentially grown cells were pelleted, transferred to an Invivo2 400 work station (Biotrace), and resuspended in deoxygenated medium. Anaerobic conditions were maintained by 10% hydrogen gas with balanced nitrogen in the presence of palladium catalyst. Media were deoxygenated by incubation in an Invivo2 400 work station for at least 24 h. Yeast manipulations and transformations were done using standard protocols. dsc1-integrating plasmid (pES215) (5.Stewart E.V. Nwosu C.C. Tong Z. Roguev A. Cummins T.D. Kim D.U. Hayles J. Park H.O.

These plasmids were linearized and transformed to strains for integration at the his3 locus. Transformants were selected for growth on Edinburgh minimal medium lacking histidine. Correct plasmid integration was confirmed by DNA sequencing of PCR-amplified genomic DNA, and protein expression was checked by Western blotting. ESY462 (h+ leu1-32 ura4-D18 ade6-M216 his3-D1::dsc2-6×GFP-his3+ Δdsc2-D1::kanMX6) was generated using dsc2-6×GFP plasmid (5.Stewart E.V. Nwosu C.C. Tong Z. Roguev A. Cummins T.D. Kim D.U. Hayles J.

Strains expressing Dsc2-6×GFP and mCherry-tagged Ost1 were generated by standard mating and random spore analysis using ESY462 as a parent strain. Wild-type Dsc1 RING domain (aa 608–695) and the corresponding mutants (C634A, H668A, I636D, and L675D) were PCR-amplified from dsc1 integrating plasmids and cloned into XbaI and HindIII sites of pGEX-KG as N-terminal GST fusion proteins. Recombinant wild-type and mutant Dsc1 RING domains were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 Codon Plus® (DE3)-RIPL (Stratagene), induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h and purified using GST-agarose beads (Sigma Aldrich). Briefly, E. coli cell pellets expressing the recombinant proteins were lysed by sonication in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 1× protease inhibitors, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 20 min and allowed to bind to GST-agarose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Bound GST fusion proteins were eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione. The purity of the protein was checked by SDS-PAGE and staining with GelCode Blue.

Dsc1 antiserum was affinity-purified by passing through a column containing Dsc1 N terminus (aa 1–300) coupled to agarose beads (AminoLink Plus immobilization kit, Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer's protocol. HRP-conjugated Dsc antibodies were prepared using the EZ-link Plus activated peroxidase kit (Thermo Scientific) following the manufacturer's instructions. Anti-GST antibody was from Covance, and anti-ubiquitin (P4D1) and anti-FLAG (M2) were from Sigma. In vitro ubiquitination assays were performed as described (12.Braun M.A. Costa P.J. Crisucci E.M.

Briefly, purified S. pombe E1 (Uba1), E2 (Ubc4), wild-type Dsc1 RING domain (aa 608–695), and Dsc1 mutants (C634A, H668A, I636D, and L675D) were used in this assay. Purified RING domain (500 nm) was mixed with 125 nm E1, 400 nm E2, and 5 μm ubiquitin (S. cerevisiae, Boston Biochem) in the presence of 2 mm ATP in ubiquitination buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm NaF, and 0.6 mm DTT). The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and stopped by adding equal amount of 2× SDS-DTT buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 200 mm DTT, 0.2% bromphenol blue). After boiling for 5 min, proteins were separated using 12% SDS-PAGE, ubiquitination was detected using anti-ubiquitin antibody (P4D1), and expression of the proteins was determined using anti-GST antibody. Sre1 and Sre2 cleavage assays were performed as described previously (3.Hughes A.L. Todd B.L. Espenshade P.J.

Briefly, for Sre1 cleavage, cells were grown to exponential phase under normoxic conditions and then shifted to anaerobic chamber (Invivo2 400 work station) for the indicated times. Cells were collected and washed, and lysates were prepared under denaturing conditions as described (3.Hughes A.L. Todd B.L. Espenshade P.J.

Processing of Sre1 was detected by Western blot analysis using anti-Sre1 antibody. Anti-Dsc5 antibody was used as a loading control. For quantification purposes, blots were developed using IRDye secondary antibodies and an Odyssey CLx imager from LI-COR. Signals for Sre1 were normalized to Dsc5, and data were quantified from three independent experiments using Image Studio software from LI-COR. For Sre2 cleavage assays, strains expressing 3×FLAG-Sre2 (aa 423–793) from the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter (9.Cheung R. Espenshade P.J.

Immunoblots were developed using chemiluminescence except where noted in the figure legends. Cells (5 × 108) were grown to exponential phase and collected by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min. Cell pellets were washed once and resuspended in B88 buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 150 mm KOAc, 5 mm Mg(OAc)2, 250 mm sorbitol) and supplemented with 1× protease inhibitors and with an additional 1× Complete, EDTA-free protease inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics). Cell lysis was performed by vortexing with glass beads (Sigma, 400–600 μm) for 10 min, and debris was removed by centrifugation at 500 × g. The resulting supernatant was subjected to 20,000 × g centrifugation for 20 min. The membrane pellet was resuspended in B88 buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and nutated at 4 °C for 1 h followed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min. Supernatant was collected and used as Nonidet P-40-solubilized membrane. Solubilized membrane proteins (30 μg) were denatured by adding SDS and 2-mercaptoethanol to final concentrations of 0.5 and 1%, respectively, in 15 μl and heating at 37 °C for 30 min. Peptide-N-glycosidase F (500 units) (New England Biolabs) was added to the denatured membrane protein and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 5× SDS-PAGE loading dye (150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 15% SDS, 25% glycerol, 0.02% bromphenol blue, and 12.5% 2-mercaptoethanol) and heating at 37 °C for an additional 30 min. Dsc1 mobility was assayed by immunoblotting using affinity-purified Dsc1 antiserum. Temperature-sensitive sar1-1 or ubc4-P61S strains were grown overnight at permissive 25 °C to exponential phase. Cycloheximide (100 μg/ml) was added to the cells and shifted to non-permissive 36 °C for the indicated times before harvesting. Cell membranes were processed as described above or treated cells were directly used for live cell microscopy. S. pombe cells expressing fluorescently tagged proteins were immobilized on 2% agarose as described previously (5.Stewart E.V. Nwosu C.C. Tong Z. Roguev A. Cummins T.D. Kim D.U. Hayles J. Park H.O.

Cells were imaged at room temperature, 25 °C, or 36 °C as indicated in the figure legends. Images were captured using 100× oil objective with 1.0 NA. We used SlideBook 5.0 for data acquisition. Fifteen Z-images (0.34-μm step size) were collected, and three-dimensional reconstitution of the confocal slices was performed by ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). All the images described in this study were acquired and processed in an identical manner. Co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed as described previously (8.Lloyd S.J. Raychaudhuri S.

Briefly, cells (6 × 108) from exponentially growing wild-type or mutant strains were collected and lysed using glass beads in digitonin lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 6.8, 1% (w/v) digitonin, 50 mm KOAc, 2 mm Mg(OAc)2, 1 mm CaCl2, 200 mm sorbitol, 1 mm NaF, 0.3 mm Na3VO2, supplemented with 1× protease inhibitors). Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 10 min, and 0.75 mg of lysate supernatant was incubated with 5 μl of Dsc2 antiserum for 15 min at 4 °C followed by the addition of 40 μl of protein A-agarose beads. Binding reaction was rotated overnight at 4 °C, and unbound proteins were removed by three washes with digitonin lysis buffer. The bound fraction was eluted by boiling 5 min in SDS-lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mm NaCl, 1% SDS and 1 mm EDTA) and analyzed by Western blotting using HRP-conjugated Dsc antibodies. The fission yeast Golgi Dsc E3 ligase complex contains five integral membrane proteins, Dsc1–Dsc5. Bioinformatic analysis identified S. pombe Dsc1 as a homolog of the S. cerevisiae Golgi Tul1 E3 ligase (6.Reggiori F. Pelham H.R. A transmembrane ubiquitin ligase required to sort membrane proteins into multivesicular bodies.Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Although Dsc1 and Tul1 have low sequence similarity (less than 30%), both are predicted to contain a large luminal N-terminal domain (about 300–400 aa long), followed by seven transmembrane segments, and a C-terminal, cytosolic RING domain. The RING domain is a well characterized zinc finger in which a total of eight cysteine and histidine residues coordinate two zinc atoms (13.Deshaies R.J. Joazeiro C.A. RING domain E3 ubiquitin ligases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2009; 78: 399-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1879) Google Scholar). Dsc1 contains an H2-type RING domain (C3H2C3) that differs from the classical RING domain (C3HC4) by having two histidines in the fourth and fifth positions (Fig. 1B) (14.Borden K.L. Freemont P.S. The RING finger domain: a recent example of a sequence-structure family.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). RING domains interact directly with E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes to ubiquitinate protein substrates (13.Deshaies R.J. Joazeiro C.A. RING domain E3 ubiquitin ligases.Annu. Rev.

https://openalex.org/W1971853583,"The Azorean barnacle, Megabalanus azoricus (Pilsbry, 1916), is a Macaronesian endemic whose obscure taxonomy and the unknown relationships among forms inhabiting isolated Northern Atlantic oceanic islands is investigated by means of molecular analysis herein. Mitochondrial data from the 16S rRNA and COX1 genes support its current species status, tropical ancestry, and the taxonomic homogeneity throughout its distribution range. In contrast, at the intraspecific level and based on control region sequences, we detected an overall low level of genetic diversity and three divergent lineages. The haplogroups α and γ were sampled in the Azores, Madeira, Canary, and Cabo Verde archipelagos; whereas haplogroup β was absent from Cabo Verde. Consequently, population analysis suggested a differentiation of the Cabo Verde population with respect to the genetically homogenous northern archipelagos generated by current oceanographic barriers. Furthermore, haplogroup α, β, and γ demographic expansions occurred during the interglacial periods MIS5 (130 Kya - thousands years ago -), MIS3 (60 Kya), and MIS7 (240 Kya), respectively. The evolutionary origin of these lineages is related to its survival in the stable southern refugia and its demographic expansion dynamics are associated with the glacial-interglacial cycles. This phylogeographic pattern suggests the occurrence of genetic discontinuity informative to the delimitation of an informally defined biogeographic entity, Macaronesia, and its generation by processes that delineate genetic diversity of marine taxa in this area."
https://openalex.org/W2072155475,"Intrinsically disordered sequences within bacterial adhesins bind to E-strands in the β-sheets of multiple FNI modules of fibronectin (FN) by anti-parallel β-strand addition, also called tandem β-zipper formation. The FUD segment of SfbI of Streptococcus pyogenes and Bbk32 segment of BBK32 of Borrelia burgdorferi, despite being imbedded in different adhesins from different bacteria, target the same FNI modules, 2–5,8–9FNI, in the N-terminal 70-kDa region (FN70K) of FN. To facilitate further comparisons, FUD, Bbk32, two other polypeptides based on SfbI that target 1–5FNI (HADD) and 2–5FNI (FRD), and mutant Bbk32 (ΔBbk32) were produced with fluorochromes placed just outside of the binding sequences. Unlabeled FUD competed ~1000-fold better for binding of labeled Bbk32 to FN than unlabeled Bbk32 competed for binding of labeled FUD to FN. Binding kinetics were determined by fluorescence polarization in a stopped-flow apparatus. On-rates for FUD, Bbk32, HADD, and FRD were similar, and all bound more rapidly to FN70K fragment than to full length FN. In stopped-flow displacement and size exclusion chromatographic assays, however, koff for FUD or HADD to FN70K or FN was considerably lower compared to koff of FRD or Bbk32. FUD and Bbk32 differ in the spacing between sequences that interact with 3FNI and 4FNI or with 5FNI and 8FNI. ΔBbk32, in which 2 residues were removed from Bbk32 to make the spacing more like FUD, had a koff intermediate between that of Bbk32 and FUD. These results indicate a “folding-after-binding” process after initial association of certain polypeptide sequences to FN that results in formation of a stable complex and is a function of number of FNI modules engaged by the polypeptide, spacing of engagement sites, and perhaps flexibility within the polypeptide-FN complex. We suggest that contributions of SfbI and BBK32 adhesins to bacterial pathogenicity may be determined in part by stability of adhesin-FN complexes."

The next 56 patients (admitted from June 2008 to November 2011) were treated with reduced-target-volume IMRT (RV-IMRT). For the RV-IMRT group, the CTV70 was delineated as the GTV alone.The 4-year local recurrence-free, regional recurrence-free, distant metastasis-free, progression-free, and overall survival rates were 77.2%, 80.1%, 83.2%, 61.2%, and 74.4% for the LV-IMRT group and 83.5%, 92.6%, 89.1%, 78.5, and 91.0% for the RV-IMRT group, respectively. Late toxicity scoring of xerostomia was lesser in the RV-IMRT group than the LV-IMRT group (P < 0.001).The use of RV-IMRT for the treatment of NPC did not negatively affect survival rates but did reduce the late xerostomia events compared to LV-IMRT."
https://openalex.org/W1966159851,"The pathophysiology of diverticulitis is poorly understood. Factors such as physical inactivity, constipation, obesity, smoking, and the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been associated with an increased risk of diverticular disease. To evaluate whether patients exhibiting long-term steroid use are at increased risk of colonic diverticulitis.We conducted a population-based, nested case-control study. Data were retrospectively collected from the National Health Insurance Research Database. The study cohort comprised patients diagnosed with diverticulitis, identified using inpatient discharge records using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes (562.11 and 562.13), and those who were administered one or more prescriptions for corticosteroids for systemic use. Control patients were matched to cases by age, sex, NSAID use, laxative drug use, and index date. We enrolled 690 patients with colonic diverticulitis and 2760 in the control group. The adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using conditional logistic regression.Compared with steroid nonusers, the adjusted ORs were 0.60 (95% CI = 0.35-1.06) and 0.80 (95% CI = 0.64-1.008) in current steroid users and previous steroid users, respectively. In addition, the adjusted ORs were 0.55 (95% CI = 0.31-0.98), 0.57 (95% CI = 0.31-0.98), and 0.44 (95% CI = 0.22-0.86) for steroid use duration more than half time by an exposure period of 90 days, 180 days, and 365 days before the claim date of colonic diverticulitis, respectively.The results indicated that long-term steroid use within one year is associated with lower risk of colonic diverticulitis."
https://openalex.org/W2093497006,"We analyse demographic longitudinal survey data of South African (SA) and Mozambican (MOZ) rural households from the Agincourt Health and Socio-Demographic Surveillance System in South Africa. In particular, we determine whether absolute poverty status (APS) is associated with selected household variables pertaining to socio-economic determination, namely household head age, household size, cumulative death, adults to minor ratio, and influx. For comparative purposes, households are classified according to household head nationality (SA or MOZ) and APS (rich or poor). The longitudinal data of each of the four subpopulations (SA rich, SA poor, MOZ rich, and MOZ poor) is a five-dimensional space defined by binary variables (questions), subjects, and time. We use the orbit method to represent binary multivariate longitudinal data (BMLD) of each household as a two-dimensional orbit and to visualise dynamics and behaviour of the population. At each time step, a point (x, y) from the orbit of a household corresponds to the observation of the household, where x is a binary sequence of responses and y is an ordering of variables. The ordering of variables is dynamically rearranged such that clusters and holes associated to least and frequently changing variables in the state space respectively, are exposed. Analysis of orbits reveals information of change at both individual- and population-level, change patterns in the data, capacity of states in the state space, and density of state transitions in the orbits. Analysis of household orbits of the four subpopulations show association between (i) households headed by older adults and rich households, (ii) large household size and poor households, and (iii) households with more minors than adults and poor households. Our results are compared to other methods of BMLD analysis."
