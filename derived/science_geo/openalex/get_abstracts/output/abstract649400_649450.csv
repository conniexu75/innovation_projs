https://openalex.org/W3012477861,"The Acidobacteria is one of the major bacterial phyla in soils and peatlands. The currently explored diversity within this phylum is assigned to 15 class-level units, five of which contain described members. The ecologically relevant traits of acidobacteria from different classes remain poorly understood. Here, we compared the patterns of acidobacterial diversity in sandy soils of tundra, along a gradient of increasing vegetation–unfixed aeolian sand, semi-fixed surfaces with mosses and lichens, and mature soil under fully developed plant cover. The Acidobacteria-affiliated 16S rRNA gene sequences retrieved from these soils comprised 11 to 33% of total bacterial reads and belonged mostly to members of the classes Acidobacteriia and Blastocatellia, which displayed opposite habitat preferences. The relative abundance of the Blastocatellia was maximal in unfixed sands and declined in soils of vegetated plots, showing positive correlation with soil pH and negative correlation with carbon and nitrogen availability. An opposite tendency was characteristic for the Acidobacteriia. Most Blastocatellia-affiliated reads belonged to as-yet-undescribed members of the family Arenimicrobiaceae, which appears to be characteristic for dry, depleted in organic matter soil habitats. The pool of Acidobacteriia-affiliated sequences, apart from Acidobacteriaceae- and Bryobacteraceae-related reads, had a large proportion of sequences from as-yet-undescribed families, which seem to specialize in degrading plant-derived organic matter. This analysis reveals sandy soils of tundra as a source of novel acidobacterial diversity and provides an insight into the ecological preferences of different taxonomic groups within this phylum."
https://openalex.org/W3010955800,"It has been demonstrated that the performance of typical unimodal brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can be noticeably improved by combining two different BCI modalities. This so-called “hybrid BCI” technology has been studied for decades; however, hybrid BCIs that particularly combine electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) (hereafter referred to as hBCIs) have not been widely used in practical settings. One of the main reasons why hBCI systems are so unpopular is that their hardware is generally too bulky and complex. Therefore, to make hBCIs more appealing, it is necessary to implement a lightweight and compact hBCI system with minimal performance degradation. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of implementing a compact hBCI system with significantly less EEG channels and fNIRS source-detector (SD) pairs, but that can achieve a classification accuracy high enough to be used in practical BCI applications. EEG and fNIRS data were acquired while participants performed three different mental tasks consisting of mental arithmetic, right-hand motor imagery, and an idle state. Our analysis results showed that the three mental states could be classified with a fairly high classification accuracy of 77.6 ± 12.1% using an hBCI system with only two EEG channels and two fNIRS SD pairs."
https://openalex.org/W3012104523,"Postnatal brain circuit assembly is driven by temporally regulated intrinsic and cell-extrinsic cues that organize neurogenesis, migration, and axo-dendritic specification in post-mitotic neurons. While cell polarity is an intrinsic organizer of morphogenic events, environmental cues in the germinal zone (GZ) instructing neuron polarization and their coupling during postnatal development are unclear. We report that oxygen tension, which rises at birth, and the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)-hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (Hif1α) pathway regulate polarization and maturation of post-mitotic cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs). At early postnatal stages with low GZ vascularization, Hif1α restrains CGN-progenitor cell-cycle exit. Unexpectedly, cell-intrinsic VHL-Hif1α pathway activation also delays the timing of CGN differentiation, germinal zone exit, and migration initiation through transcriptional repression of the partitioning-defective (Pard) complex. As vascularization proceeds, these inhibitory mechanisms are downregulated, implicating increasing oxygen tension as a critical switch for neuronal polarization and cerebellar GZ exit."
https://openalex.org/W3010952037,"Having children is a transformative experience and may change the way people think about the future. Parents invest time, energy and resources to ensure the survival and reproductive success of offspring. Having children may also induce environmental concerns and investments in actions aimed at guaranteeing the quality of natural resources available to offspring. However, there is limited empirical support for this parenthood effect, and little is known about how environmental attitudes and behaviour change over time following the birth of a child. This pre-registered study uses data from the first seven waves (2009–2015) of the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study—a longitudinal national probability study of social attitudes, personality, and health outcomes—with multilevel interrupted time series analysis. Respondents’ belief in the reality and causes of climate change, sacrifices to standard of living to protect the environment, and changes in daily routine to protect the environment did not change significantly following the birth of a child; and nor were there changes in the underlying trends of attitudes or pre-birth anticipation effects. The study further found no gender differences in the attitudinal effects of childbirth. Additional exploratory analyses suggest that becoming a parent for the first time may increase beliefs in the reality of climate change but does not appear to change other environmental attitudes. Overall, our findings provide little empirical evidence for parenthood effects on environmentalism."
https://openalex.org/W3011218089,"The extent to which small plastics and potentially associated compounds are entering coastal food webs, especially in estuarine systems, is only beginning to be realized. This study examined an estuarine reach at the mouth of urbanized Chollas Creek in San Diego, California to determine: 1) the extent and magnitude of microplastics pollution in estuarine sediments and fish, 2) the extent and magnitude of SVOC contamination in estuarine fish, and 3) whether fish preferentially ingested certain types of microplastics, when compared with the microplastic composition of creekbed sediments. Surface sediments (0-5 cm depth) contained about 10,000 small plastic pieces per m2, consisting mostly (90%) of fibers, and hard and soft pieces. Nearly 25% of fish contained small plastics, but prevalence varied with size and between species. Of the 25 types of small plastics found in sediment, fish preferred about 10 types (distinct colors and forms). Several SVOCs, both water soluble and sediment-associated compounds, were found in the two species of fish tested. This study revealed that a species' natural history may influence contamination levels, and warrants further study to better understand the pathways of plastics and associated contaminants into and throughout coastal food webs, and the potential health risks for small and/or low-trophic level organisms."

The targeted alpha therapy with 212Pb-NNV003 presented in this study combines cytotoxic α-particles from 212Pb, with the anti-CD37 antibody NNV003, targeting B-cell malignancies. The goal of this study was to explore 212Pb-NNV003 for treatment of CD37 positive chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in preclinical mouse models.An anti-proliferative effect of 212Pb-NNV003 was observed in both chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (MEC-2) and Burkitt's lymphoma (Daudi) cells in vitro. In biodistribution experiments, accumulation of 212Pb-NNV003 was 23%ID/g and 16%ID/g in Daudi and MEC-2 tumours 24 h post injection. In two intravenous animal models 90% of the mice treated with a single injection of 212Pb-NNV003 were alive 28 weeks post cell injection. Median survival times of control groups were 5-9 weeks. There was no significant difference between different specific activities of 212Pb-NNV003 with regards to therapeutic effect or toxicity. For therapeutically effective activities, a transient haematological toxicity was observed. This study shows that 212Pb-NNV003 is effective and safe in preclinical models of CD37 positive chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, warranting future clinical testing."
https://openalex.org/W3011089770,"First reported in March 2014, an Ebola epidemic impacted West Africa, most notably Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. We demonstrate the value of social media for automated surveillance of infectious diseases such as the West Africa Ebola epidemic. We experiment with two variations of an existing surveillance architecture: the first aggregates tweets related to different symptoms together, while the second considers tweets about each symptom separately and then aggregates the set of alerts generated by the architecture. Using a dataset of tweets posted from the affected region from 2011 to 2014, we obtain alerts in December 2013, which is three months prior to the official announcement of the epidemic. Among the two variations, the second, which produces a restricted but useful set of alerts, can potentially be applied to other infectious disease surveillance and alert systems."
https://openalex.org/W3011345774,"Bacterial type VII secretion systems secrete a wide range of extracellular proteins that play important roles in bacterial viability and in interactions of pathogenic mycobacteria with their hosts. Mycobacterial type VII secretion systems consist of five subtypes, ESX-1–5, and have four substrate classes, namely, Esx, PE, PPE, and Esp proteins. At least some of these substrates are secreted as heterodimers. Each ESX system mediates the secretion of a specific set of Esx, PE, and PPE proteins, raising the question of how these substrates are recognized in a system-specific fashion. For the PE/PPE heterodimers, it has been shown that they interact with their cognate EspG chaperone and that this chaperone determines the designated secretion pathway. However, both structural and pulldown analyses have suggested that EspG cannot interact with the Esx proteins. Therefore, the determining factor for system specificity of the Esx proteins remains unknown. Here, we investigated the secretion specificity of the ESX-1 substrate pair EsxB_1/EsxA_1 in Mycobacterium marinum. Although this substrate pair was hardly secreted when homologously expressed, it was secreted when co-expressed together with the PE35/PPE68_1 pair, indicating that this pair could stimulate secretion of the EsxB_1/EsxA_1 pair. Surprisingly, co-expression of EsxB_1/EsxA_1 with a modified PE35/PPE68_1 version that carried the EspG5 chaperone-binding domain, previously shown to redirect this substrate pair to the ESX-5 system, also resulted in redirection and co-secretion of the Esx pair via ESX-5. Our results suggest a secretion model in which PE35/PPE68_1 determines the system-specific secretion of EsxB_1/EsxA_1.

Mycobacteria possess an unusual hydrophobic cell envelope that protects them from various stresses and contributes to the resilience of pathogenic mycobacteria during infection. Classified as guanine-cytosine rich Gram-positive bacteria, the cell envelope of mycobacteria consists of a relatively standard cell membrane with a surrounding peptidoglycan layer. However, mycobacteria belong to a subgroup of guanine-cytosine rich Gram-positive bacteria that have acquired an extra hydrophobic layer of long-chain fatty acids, called mycolic acids. These specific lipids are covalently linked via an arabinogalactan layer to the peptidoglycan layer, forming a highly rigid and impermeable structure. Mycobacteria employ specialized machineries, called type VII secretion systems (T7SSs) 3The abbreviations used are: T7SStype VII secretion systemNBDnucleotide-binding domainHAhemagglutinin. to secrete proteins across their complex cell envelope (1Houben E.N.

Interestingly, each ESX system secretes its own subset of Esx, PE, and PPE substrates that are most likely responsible for the various roles of ESX systems in the bacterial life cycle. How these structurally similar proteins are specifically targeted to their corresponding ESX system still remains unclear. A conserved T7SS secretion signal (YXXX(D/E)) has been identified that is located directly after the helix–turn–helix domain of one partner protein of the Esx heterodimer and the PE partner of the PE/PPE heterodimer. This signal, although required for secretion, is exchangeable among PE substrates of different ESX systems without changing their initial secretion route (29Daleke M.H. Ummels R. Bawono P. Heringa J. Vandenbroucke-Grauls C.M. Luirink J. Bitter W. General secretion signal for the mycobacterial type VII secretion pathway.Proc. Natl. Acad.

Hence, this signal does not determine system-specific secretion of these ESX substrates. Structural analysis showed that the conserved N termini of PPE proteins contain, in addition to the helix–turn–helix structure, an extra domain that is not present in Esx and PE proteins. This relatively hydrophobic helical tip domain extends from the characteristic four-helix bundle formed by the PE-PPE interface (22Korotkova N. Freire D. Phan T.H. Ummels R. Creekmore C.C. Evans T.J.

Previously, we could establish the redirection of the ESX-1 substrate pair PE35/PPE68_1 to the ESX-5 system by replacing its EspG1 chaperone-binding domain with the equivalent domain of the ESX-5 substrate PPE18 (32Phan T.H.

The remaining question is how the Esx substrate pairs that lack this extended tip domain are specifically recognized and targeted to their designated systems. Here, we investigated the signals that determine the system specificity of Esx substrates in Mycobacterium marinum using the ESX-1 heterodimer EsxB_1/EsxA_1 as model substrates. Its encoding genes esxB_1/esxA_1 (MMAR_0187/MMAR_0188) are adjacent to pe35/ppe68_1 (MMAR_0185/MMAR_0186), which are gene products we have previously used as a model ESX-1–dependent PE/PPE heterodimer (31Daleke M.H. van der Woude A.D.

Interestingly, the EsxB_1/EsxA_1 pair could be rerouted to the ESX-5 system by solely exchanging the EspG-binding domain in PPE68_1. This not only confirms the strict dependence of the EsxB_1/EsxA_1 heterodimer on PE35/PPE68_1 for secretion but also reveals that this PE/PPE pair determines the system specificity of this Esx pair. To investigate how the system-specific secretion of Esx substrates is achieved, we investigated the secretion requirements of EsxB_1/EsxA_1 in M. marinum. The corresponding coding genes (MMAR_0187/MMAR_0188) lie adjacent to the gene pair pe35/ppe68_1 (MMAR_0185/MMAR_0186) and are paralogs of the pe35–ppe68–esxB–esxA gene cluster located in the esx-1 locus (Fig. 1A).

https://openalex.org/W3010987597,"Paleopathological diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) essentially relies on the identification of macroscopic lesions in the skeleton that can be related to different manifestations of TB. Among these alterations, granular impressions (GIs) on the inner skull surface have been considered as pathognomonic features of tuberculous meningitis (TBM). GIs may be established by pressure atrophy of the tubercles formed on the outermost meningeal layer during later stages of TBM. Although GIs were used as diagnostic criteria for TBM in the paleopathological practice since the late 20th century, their diagnostic value has been questioned. To contribute to strengthening the diagnostic value of GIs, a macroscopic investigation–focusing on the macromorphological characteristics and frequency of GIs–was performed on skeletons of known cause of death from the Terry Collection. The χ2 analysis of our data revealed that GIs were significantly more common in individuals who died of TB than in individuals who died of non-TB causes. Furthermore, GIs were localized on the inner surface of the skull base and of the lower lateral skull vault. The localization pattern and distribution of GIs on the endocranial surface resemble that of the tubercles observed in the affected meninges during the pathogenesis of TBM. Our results strengthen the tuberculous origin of GIs and imply that they can be considered as specific signs of TBM. Therefore, GIs can be used as diagnostic criteria for TBM in the paleopathological practice, and the diagnosis of TBM can be established with a high certainty when GIs are present in ancient human bone remains."
https://openalex.org/W3011065967,"Preclinical studies have shown a larger inhibition of tumour growth when exercise begins prior to tumour implant (preventative setting) than when training begins after tumour implant (therapeutic setting). However, post-implantation exercise may alter the tumour microenvironment to make it more vulnerable to treatment by increasing tumour perfusion while reducing hypoxia. This has been shown most convincingly in breast and prostate cancer models to date and it is unclear whether other tumour types respond in a similar way. We aimed to determine whether tumour perfusion and hypoxia are altered with exercise in a melanoma model, and compared this with a breast cancer model. We hypothesised that post-implantation exercise would reduce tumour hypoxia and increase perfusion in these two models. Female, 6–10 week old C57BL/6 mice were inoculated with EO771 breast or B16-F10 melanoma tumour cells before randomisation to either exercise or non-exercising control. Exercising mice received a running wheel with a revolution counter. Mice were euthanised when tumours reached maximum ethical size and the tumours assessed for perfusion, hypoxia, blood vessel density and proliferation. We saw an increase in heart to body weight ratio in exercising compared with non-exercising mice (p = 0.0008), indicating that physiological changes occurred with this form of physical activity. However, exercise did not affect vascularity, perfusion, hypoxia or tumour growth rate in either tumour type. In addition, EO771 tumours had a more aggressive phenotype than B16-F10 tumours, as inferred from a higher rate of proliferation (p<0.0001), a higher level of tumour hypoxia (p = 0.0063) and a higher number of CD31+ vessels (p = 0.0005). Our results show that although a physiological training effect was seen with exercise, it did not affect tumour hypoxia, perfusion or growth rate. We suggest that exercise monotherapy is minimally effective and that future preclinical work should focus on the combination of exercise with standard cancer therapies."
https://openalex.org/W3011077493,"The Olsen phosphorus (Olsen-P) concentration of soil is generally a good indicator for estimating the bioavailability of P and environmental risk in soils. To maintain soil Olsen-P at adequate levels for crop growth and environmental sustainability, the relationship between soil Olsen-P and the P budget (the P input minus the output) as well as the variations of soil Olsen-P and P budget were investigated from three long-term (22 years) experiments in China. Five treatments were selected: (1) unfertilized control (CK); (2) nitrogen and potassium (NK); (3) nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium (NPK); (4) nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium and straw; (5) nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium and manure. The results showed that without P fertilizers (CK, NK), there was a soil P deficit of 75–640 kg ha-1, and the lowest P deficit (mean of CK and NK) was in Eutric Cambisol. Soil Olsen-P decreased by 0.11–0.39 mg kg-1 year-1 in the order of Luvic Phaeozems > Eutric Cambisol > Calcaric Cambisol. Soil Olsen-P and the P deficit had a significantly (P<0.01) positive linear relationship. For every 100 kg of P ha–1 of deficit, soil Olsen-P decreased by 0.44–9.19 mg kg–1 in the order of Eutric Cambisol > Luvic Phaeozems > Calcaric Cambisol. Under the P fertilizer treatments (NPK, NPKS, and NPKM), soil Olsen-P showed an obvious surplus (except the NPK and NPKS in Luvic Phaeozems) of 122–2190 kg ha-1, and the largest P surplus was found under the NPKM treatment at each site. The relation between soil Olsen-P and the experimental years could be simulated using quadratic equation of one unknown in Calcaric Cambisol for the lower P input after 14 years of fertilization. And soil Olsen-P increased by 1.30–7.69 mg kg-1 year-1 in the order of Luvic Phaeozems > Eutric Cambisol. The relation between soil Olsen-P and the P surplus could be simulated by a simple linear equation except under NPK and NPKS in Luvic Phaeozems. With 100 kg ha-1 P surplus, soil Olsen-P increased by 3.24–7.27 mg kg-1 in the order of Calcaric Cambisol (6.42 mg kg-1) > Eutric Cambisol (3.24 mg kg-1). In addition, the change in soil Olsen-P with a 100 kg P ha-1 surplus (soil Olsen-P efficiency) was affected by the soil organic matter (SOM), pH, and CaCO3 content, etc. In the practice of fertilization, it’s not necessary to increase the amount of P fertilizers, farmers should take measure to solve the local problem, for adjust the soil pH of Eutric Cambisol and Calcaric Cambisol, and apply more nitrogen in Luvic Phaeozems. In the area of serious soil P surplus, it is encouraged to stop applying P fertilizers for a few years to take advantage of soil accumulated P and make the high Olsen-P content decrease to a reasonable level."
https://openalex.org/W3011078828,"Participation, defined as ‘involvement in life situations’ according to the World Health Organisation, is a well-recognized concept and critical indicator of quality of life. In addition it has become an important outcome measure in child rehabilitation. However, little is known about the level of participation of young children with Developmental Disabilities. The aim of this study was to capture their subjective experiences of participation. An adapted informed consent based on a comic strip was used to get the children’s assent. A Photo Elicitation study was used, in which photographs were taken by the children when they were involved in meaningful activities. The photographs were then used to facilitate communication with the children and to initiate in depth-interviews. Forty-seven interviews with 16 children between five and nine years were conducted based on their photographs. This method generated rich data, confirming that young children with Developmental Disabilities were able to inform us accurately on their experiences of participation. Data was analysed by means of an inductive thematic analysis. Results showed that children perceived their participation as satisfying when they can play, learn and join in family gatherings resulting in feelings of inclusion, recognition and belonging. When there are—on occasions—moments that their participation was obstructed, the children used two strategies to resolve it. Or they walked away from it and choose not to participate, or when autonomously motivated for the activity, they relied primarily on their context (i.e. mothers) as enabling their participation. Related to the data, children discussed themes related to their person, activities, connections and mediators between those themes. These themes fit well within earlier and current research on the subject of participation."
https://openalex.org/W3011269696,"Low soil fertility, high rates of fertilizer application and low yields and quality are major problems in intensive banana production in acid soils of south China. A field experiment was carried out for two years to determine the optimum management practices for maximizing soil health and banana yield and quality. The experiment consisted of an unamended control (CK) and lime (Lime), calcium magnesium phosphate fertilizer (CMP), organic fertilizer (OF), and organic fertilizer combined with calcium magnesium phosphate fertilizer (OFC) treatments. Soil nutrient concentrations and banana shoot biomass, nutrient uptake, yield and fruit quality were determined. Application of lime and CMP was found to increase soil pH and nutrient availability and increase banana yield. Yet, the banana biomass and yields in the Lime and CMP treatments were significantly lower than those in the OF and OFC treatments in which soil organic matter (SOM) content increased. Total soluble solids and soluble sugar contents increased in the CMP and organic fertilizer treatments. A consistent increase in Mg concentrations in banana leaves over the two years in the CMP and organic fertilizer treatments indicates that Mg is essential for banana production and quality. Short-term adding Mg from banana corms increased total soluble solids and soluble sugar content. The application of organic fertilizer combined with CMP or Mg solution is therefore recommended to increase soil health and promote the yield and quality of banana in intensively managed plantations in subtropical regions."

We examined whether current urbanicity was associated with mental health problems directly and indirectly via biological stress system functioning. Participants (n = 323) were adolescents from the Dutch general population. Measures included home and laboratory assessments of autonomic nervous system and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis functioning, neighborhood-level urbanicity and socioeconomic status, and mother- and adolescent self-reported mental health problems. Structural equation models showed that urbanicity was not associated with mental health problems directly. Urbanicity was associated with acute autonomic nervous system and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis reactivity such that adolescents who lived in more urban areas showed blunted biological stress reactivity. Furthermore, there was some evidence for an indirect effect of urbanicity on mother-reported behavioral problems via acute autonomic nervous system reactivity. Urbanicity was not associated with overall autonomic nervous system and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis reactivity or basal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis functioning. Although we observed some evidence for associations between urbanicity, biological stress reactivity and mental health problems, most of the tested associations were not statistically significant. Measures of long-term biological stress system functioning may be more relevant to the study of broader environmental factors such as urbanicity."
https://openalex.org/W3010804760,"We present a novel virtual reality (VR) system to measure soccer players' read-the-game ability. Read-the-game is a term that encompasses a conglomerate of visual exploratory behavioral patterns and cognitive elements required to make accurate in-game decisions. Our technological approach in the Sports Science domain focuses on the visuomotor component of targeted skill development in a VR simulation because VR is a powerful perception-action coupling training solution for visuomotor coordination due to its high sense of immersion and its psychological byproduct presence. Additionally, we analyze two critical aspects: psychological (i.e., sense of presence) and the human-computer interaction (HCI) domain (i.e., suitable input device for full-body immersion). To measure head movements related to visual explorations, the system tracks the user's head excursions. Specifically, the engaged visual exploratory activity (VEA) during a VR simulation is measured frame-by-frame at runtime to study the behavior of players making passing decisions while experiencing pressure from rivals during in-game situations recreated with computer graphics (CG). Additionally, the sense of presence elicited by our system is measured via the Igroup Presence Questionnaire applied to beginner and amateur soccer players (n = 24). Regarding the HCI aspect, a comparison of input options reveals that a high presence can be achieved when using full body interactions that integrate head and body motions via a combination of an HMD and kinetic body tracking. During our system verification, a difference in the VEA performance is observed between beginner and amateur players. Moreover, we demonstrate the capacity of the system to measure the VEA while evoking immersive soccer in-match experiences with a portable VR setup."

Thymopoiesis, cell activation, senescence and cell proliferation were analyzed by CD31, HLA-DR/CD38, CD28/CD57 and Ki-67 expression, respectively. Plasma levels of sCD14 and MDA were measured by ELISA. Frail infected individuals showed a reduced number of memory T cells, both CD4+ and CD8+ populations. Activated CD3+CD4+HLA-DR+ T cells were lower in frail individuals, and directly correlated with CD3+CD8+HLA-DR+ and CD8M cells. Senescent CD8+CD28-CD57+ cells were reduced in frail HIV-1 infected individuals and inversely correlated with CD8RTE, CD8N and CD3+CD4+HLA-DR+. Higher plasma levels of sCD14 and MDA were found in HIV-1 infected frail individuals. Our data show association among frailty, markers of immune activation and oxidative stress. Understanding the immune mechanisms underlying frailty status in HIV-1 population is of high relevance not only for the prediction of continuing longevity but also for the identification of potential strategies for the elderly."
https://openalex.org/W3010736544,"Mobile devices for on-field DNA analysis have been used for medical diagnostics at the point-of-care, forensic investigations and environmental surveys, but still have to be validated for ancient DNA studies. We report here on a mobile laboratory that we setup using commercially available devices, including a compact real-time PCR machine, and describe procedures to perform DNA extraction and analysis from a variety of archeological samples within 4 hours. The process is carried out on 50 mg samples that are identified at the species level using custom TaqMan real-time PCR assays for mitochondrial DNA fragments. We evaluated the potential of this approach in museums lacking facilities for DNA studies by analyzing samples from the Enlène (MIS 2 layer) and the Portel-Ouest cave (MIS 3 deposits), and also performed experiments during an excavation campaign at the Roc-en-Pail (MIS 5) open-air site. Enlène Bovinae bone samples only yielded DNA for the extinct steppe bison (Bison priscus), whereas Portel-Ouest cave coprolites contained cave hyena (Crocuta crocuta spelaea) DNA together, for some of them, with DNA for the European bison sister species/subspecies (Bison schoetensacki/Bb1-X), thus highlighting the cave hyena diet. Roc-en-Pail Bovinae bone and tooth samples also contained DNA for the Bison schoetensacki/Bb1-X clade, and Cervidae bone samples only yielded reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) DNA. Subsequent DNA sequencing analyses confirmed that correct species identification had been achieved using our TaqMan assays, hence validating these assays for future studies. We conclude that our approach enables the rapid genetic characterization of tens of millennia-old archeological samples and is expected to be useful for the on-site screening of museums and freshly excavated samples for DNA content. Because our mobile laboratory is made up of commercially available instruments, this approach is easily accessible to other investigators."
https://openalex.org/W3011028208,"Predicting the number of defects in software at the method level is important. However, little or no research has focused on method-level defect prediction. Therefore, considerable efforts are still required to demonstrate how method-level defect prediction can be achieved for a new software version. In the current study, we present an analysis of the relevant information obtained from the current version of a software product to construct regression models to predict the estimated number of defects in a new version using the variables of defect density, defect velocity and defect introduction time, which show considerable correlation with the number of method-level defects. These variables also show a mathematical relationship between defect density and defect acceleration at the method level, further indicating that the increase in the number of defects and the defect density are functions of the defect acceleration. We report an experiment conducted on the Finding Faults Using Ensemble Learners (ELFF) open-source Java projects, which contain 289,132 methods. The results show correlation coefficients of 60% for the defect density, -4% for the defect introduction time, and 93% for the defect velocity. These findings indicate that the average defect velocity shows a firm and considerable correlation with the number of defects at the method level. The proposed approach also motivates an investigation and comparison of the average performances of classifiers before and after method-level data preprocessing and of the level of entropy in the datasets."
https://openalex.org/W3012353182,"Introduction Household contacts of patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) often have latent TB infection, and are at risk of progression to disease. We set out to investigate whether index TB case HIV status was linked to a higher probability of latent TB infection among household contacts. Materials and methods Data were collected prospectively from participants in the intervention arm of a household cluster-randomised trial in two South Africa provinces (Mangaung, Free State, and Capricorn, Limpopo). In intervention group households, TB contacts underwent HIV testing and tuberculin skin testing (TST). TST induration was estimated at two cut-offs (≥5mm, ≥10mm). Multilevel Bayesian regression models estimated posterior distributions of the percentage of household contacts with TST induration ≥5mm and ≥10mm by age group, and compared the odds of latent TB infection by key risk factors including HIV status index case age and study province. Results A total of 2,985 household contacts of 924 index cases were assessed, with most 2,725 (91.3%) undergoing TST. HIV prevalence in household contacts was 14% and 10% in Mangaung and Capricorn respectively. Overall, 16.8% (458/2,725) had TST induration of ≥5mm and 13.1% (359/2,725) ≥10mm. In Mangaung, children aged 0–4 years had a high TST positivity prevalence compared to their peers in Capricorn (22.0% vs. 7.6%, and 20.5% vs. 2.3%, using TST thresholds of ≥5mm and ≥10mm respectively). Compared to contacts from Capricorn, household contacts living in Mangaung were more likely to have TST induration ≥5mm (odds ratio [OR]: 3.08, 95% credibility interval [CI]: 2.13–4.58) and ≥10mm (OR: 4.52, 95% CI: 3.03–6.97). There was a 90% and 92% posterior probability that the odds of TST induration ≥5mm (OR: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.56–1.14) and ≥10mm (OR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.53–1.10) respectively were lower in household contacts of HIV-positive compared to HIV-negative index cases. Conclusions High TST induration positivity, especially among young children and people living in Mangaung indicates considerable TB transmission despite high antiretroviral therapy coverage. Household contact of HIV-positive index TB cases were less likely to have evidence of latent TB infection than contacts of HIV-negative index cases."
https://openalex.org/W3010996289,"The interest in reef manta rays (Mobula alfredi) from the scientific community is growing in reaction to the major decline of populations around the world. Studies have highlighted the need to further investigate the spatial ecology of this species to inform conservation and management initiatives. Here we briefly report the results from nine SPLASH10-F-321A pop-off satellite archival tags (PSAT-tags) deployed in New Caledonia that recorded the world's deepest known dives for reef manta rays. All tagged individuals performed dives exceeding 300 m in depth, with a maximum depth recorded of 672 ± 4 m. Diel comparisons revealed that most of the deepest dives occurred during night-time. We hypothesize this deep-diving behaviour is employed to access important food resources at these depths during the night and may also indicate that zooplankton abundance in the surface waters surrounding New Caledonian coral reefs is insufficient to sustain these megafauna. These results add new information on the habitat use of this species in a region where manta behaviour has not previously been studied, and increase the known depth range of M. alfredi by more than 200 m."
https://openalex.org/W3011607919,"The cellular energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a metabolic regulator that mediates adaptation to nutritional variations to maintain a proper energy balance in cells. We show here that suckling-weaning and fasting-refeeding transitions in rodents are associated with changes in AMPK activation and the cellular energy state in the liver. These nutritional transitions were characterized by a metabolic switch from lipid to glucose utilization, orchestrated by modifications in glucose levels and the glucagon/insulin ratio in the bloodstream. We therefore investigated the respective roles of glucose and pancreatic hormones on AMPK activation in mouse primary hepatocytes. We found that glucose starvation transiently activates AMPK, whereas changes in glucagon and insulin levels had no impact on AMPK. Challenge of hepatocytes with metformin-induced metabolic stress strengthened both AMPK activation and cellular energy depletion under limited-glucose conditions, whereas neither glucagon nor insulin altered AMPK activation. Although both insulin and glucagon induced AMPKα phosphorylation at its Ser485/491 residue, they did not affect its activity. Finally, the decrease in cellular ATP levels in response to an energy stress was additionally exacerbated under fasting conditions and by AMPK deficiency in hepatocytes, revealing metabolic inflexibility and emphasizing the importance of AMPK for maintaining hepatic energy charge. Our results suggest that nutritional changes (i.e. glucose availability), rather than the related hormonal changes (i.e. the glucagon/insulin ratio), sensitize AMPK activation to the energetic stress induced by the dietary transition during fasting.

It is widely accepted that AMPK integrates nutritional and hormonal signals to maintain the cellular energy balance and execute appropriate metabolic functions (e.g. inhibition of ATP-consuming pathways and promotion of ATP-generating pathways) in response to nutritional environmental challenges. AMPK is activated in response to a variety of metabolic stresses or hormonal changes that typically change the cellular AMP/ATP and ADP/ATP ratios caused by increasing ATP consumption or reducing ATP production, such as that observed following starvation, exercise, hypoxia, ischemia, or inhibition of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.

AMPK is a heterotrimeric complex consisting of a catalytic α-subunit and two regulatory subunits, β and γ. Each subunit has at least two isoforms. The α-subunit contains the kinase domain, which is normally active only when a critical residue, Thr172, is phosphorylated within the activation loop (2Willows R. Sanders M.J. Xiao B. Patel B.R.

The upstream kinases that phosphorylate this site have been identified as the tumor suppressor liver kinase B1 (LKB1) and Ca2+/calmodulin-activated protein kinase kinase 2 (CaMKK2). Whereas the Thr172 residue represents the major AMPK phosphorylation and activation site in the α-subunit, phosphorylation of some Ser/Thr residues within the ST loop by PKA, Akt, and GSK3, associated with reduced α-Thr172 phosphorylation, has been reported to inhibit AMPK activity (1Hardie D.G.

The γ-subunit contains four tandem repeats of the cystathionine β-synthase motif, which provides binding sites for the regulatory nucleotides, AMP, ADP, and ATP. Binding of AMP or ADP activates AMPK by various mechanisms that are all inhibited by ATP. They include the promotion of AMPK α-subunit Thr172 phosphorylation by the upstream kinase LKB1 and inhibition of α-Thr172 dephosphorylation by protein phosphatases. In addition, binding of AMP, but not ADP, causes allosteric activation of up to 10-fold. Activation of AMPK can also occur independently of AMP/ADP binding through α-Thr172 phosphorylation by CaMKK2 in response to increased intracellular Ca2+ levels. An additional AMP/ADP-independent mechanism is engaged upon glucose removal by the formation of an axin/LKB1/AMPK complex at the surface of lysosomes, leading to the phosphorylation and activation of a compartmentalized pool of AMPK. The activation of distinct subcellular pools of AMPK may play an important role in the phosphorylation of specific downstream targets. Indeed, a recent study reported that the intensity of stress stimulation triggers differential AMPK activation in the lysosomal, cytosolic, and mitochondrial fractions to target specific metabolic pathways, depending on the metabolic status of the cell (7Zong Y.

The transition from the fasting to refed state is associated with modifications in hepatic lipid metabolism (i.e. increased fatty acid synthesis and decreased fatty acid oxidation) that appear to coincide with changes in the activation and phosphorylation of the AMPK α-subunit at Thr172 and ACC at Ser79 (13Assifi M.M.

This observation raises the possibility that the modulation of AMPK activity may contribute to the shift of lipid metabolism in the liver from catabolism to anabolism. However, the specific cues that mediate such changes in AMPK signaling are still poorly understood. The hepatic metabolic adaptations that occur during fasting/refeeding are primarily triggered by changes in the glucagon/insulin ratio. During fasting, plasma glucagon levels are high, and plasma insulin and glucose levels are low. By contrast, refeeding increases plasma glucose and insulin concentrations. Hence, changes in glucose availability and/or the level of pancreatic hormones may directly modulate hepatic AMPK activity during this metabolic transition. AMPK activity during fasting and refeeding may thus be regulated by glucagon or insulin-stimulated changes in kinase phosphorylation, respectively (15Munday M.R. Milic M.R. Takhar S. Holness M.J. Sugden M.C. The short-term regulation of hepatic acetyl-CoA carboxylase during starvation and re-feeding in the rat.Biochem.

Consistent with this possibility, the AMPK α-subunit is phosphorylated at multiple sites, including α1-Ser485/α2-Ser491, by the insulin-activated protein kinase Akt, inhibiting subsequent phosphorylation of α-Thr172 by upstream kinases (19Hawley S.A.

Here, we provide evidence that hepatic AMPK activity is insensitive to changes in insulin and glucagon levels but is instead sensitive to variations in glucose availability. Such regulation is central to defining the threshold of AMPK activation during metabolic/energy stress in the liver. The suckling-weaning transition is accompanied by marked changes in metabolic pathways in the liver (i.e. a metabolic switch from lipid to glucose utilization with a decrease in lipid oxidation and an increase in glycolysis and lipogenesis) (21Pillay D. Bailey E. Lipogenesis at the suckling-weaning transition in liver and brown adipose tissue of the rat.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 713 (6129898): 663-66910.1016/0005-2760(82)90327-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). During the suckling period, the plasma insulin concentration is low and that of glucagon high because of the ingestion of milk, which is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate food. The transition from a milk diet to a high-carbohydrate diet at weaning leads to an increase in blood glucose and plasma insulin levels (Fig. 1A). Weaning from maternal milk was associated with a decrease in the phosphorylation of AMPK at α-Thr172 and that of its substrate ACC at Ser79 in the liver, whereas the abundance of the AMPK and ACC proteins was unchanged (Fig. 1B). In this context, increased phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 reflects activation of the insulin-signaling pathway (Fig. 1B). Conversely, AMPK signaling was highly active in the liver of suckling rats, as characterized by an increase in the phosphorylation of AMPK-α-Thr172 and ACC-Ser79 (Fig. 1B). As expected, the transition from fasting to refeeding was associated with an increase in blood glucose and insulin levels and a decrease in blood glucagon levels (Fig. 1C). In the liver of starved mice, phosphorylation of AMPK-α-Thr172 and ACC-Ser79 was markedly higher than that of refed mice (Fig. 1D), in agreement with previous studies (13Assifi M.M. Suchankova G.

Conversely, the increase in blood insulin levels in refed mice induced the phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 residue (Fig. 1D). During fasting, changes in AMPK activation were associated with a lower cellular energy state, as revealed by the decrease and increase of hepatic ATP and ADP concentrations, respectively, resulting in a significant increase in the ADP/ATP ratio (Fig. 2). Thus, hepatic AMPK activation induced by fasting is associated with a decrease in the cellular energy state in the liver. AMPK plays a crucial role in maintaining energy homeostasis during periods of metabolic stress. We therefore hypothesized that AMPK deficiency in the liver may alter sensitivity to an energy stress. We tested this hypothesis by treating hepatic AMPK-deficient mice with metformin, a mild inhibitor of mitochondrial respiratory chain (22El-Mir M.Y. Nogueira V. Fontaine E. Avéret N. Rigoulet M.

Importantly, the increase in the ADP/ATP ratio was greater in AMPK-deficient liver (Fig. 3, A and B).

These results demonstrate the protective role of AMPK in maintaining hepatic energy homeostasis in response to a metabolic challenge induced by a reduction in cellular energy charge. Given the modulation of AMPK activity during the fasting/refeeding and suckling/weaning transitions, we hypothesized that the regulation of hepatic AMPK is driven by changes in glucose availability and/or glucagon or insulin-stimulated changes in the kinase phosphorylation status (15Munday M.R.

We thus treated mouse primary hepatocytes with the AMPK activators, metformin, AICAR, or A-769662, under various nutritional and hormonal conditions mimicking the fasting or fed states to identify the nature of the stimuli that modulate hepatic AMPK activity. Under low glucose/basal conditions (5 mm glucose), metformin induced the phosphorylation of AMPK at α-Thr172 and that of its downstream targets ACC at Ser79 and Raptor at Ser792 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4). Incubation of hepatocytes with high glucose concentrations (25 mm glucose) and insulin, to mimic feeding, increased the phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 but did not alter metformin-induced AMPK phosphorylation relative to that of the basal condition (Fig. 4). In contrast, culturing the hepatocytes in a medium that simulated fasting conditions, which contained glucagon and in which glucose was replaced with lactate and pyruvate, robustly enhanced metformin-induced AMPK phosphorylation concomitantly with an increase in the PKA substrate phosphorylation pattern (Fig. 4). We next assessed the effect of changes in glucose concentrations and pancreatic hormone levels in culture medium on metformin-induced energy depletion in both control and AMPK-deficient hepatocytes. In the absence of metformin, the cellular energy charge was similar between control and AMPK-deficient hepatocytes and was not altered after an 8-h incubation under conditions mimicking fasting (glucose-free medium containing lactate and pyruvate plus glucagon) or refeeding (25 mm glucose plus insulin), indicating that these conditions are insufficient to alter the cellular energy state (Fig. 5, A and B). Metformin treatment strongly correlated with a marked decrease in ATP and energy charge in both control and AMPK-deficient hepatocytes. As observed in the liver (Fig. 3, A and B), the decrease in ATP levels and energy charge in response to metformin was greater in AMPK-deficient hepatocytes than control hepatocytes (Fig. 5, A and B). Metformin-induced energy depletion was also greater when hepatocytes were incubated under fasting-like than refeeding-like conditions, and this effect was greater in AMPK-deficient hepatocytes than control hepatocytes. Thus, the higher activation of AMPK in response to an energy stress in hepatocytes incubated under fasting-like conditions coincides with a greater cellular energy deficiency. Moreover, the aggravation of energy depletion observed in AMPK-deficient hepatocytes incubated under fasting conditions is consistent with the role of AMPK in regulating the cellular energy balance to restore cellular ATP levels to normal values. To dissociate the impact of glucagon and insulin signaling from that of glucose availability on AMPK activity, we separately examined their respective effects on metformin-induced AMPK activation in hepatocytes. In the presence of 5 mm glucose, treatment with glucagon or insulin induced sustained phosphorylation of PKA substrates or Akt-Ser473, respectively, but they had no effect on the pattern of change of AMPK phosphorylation at α-Thr172 or that of its downstream targets (ACC at Ser79 and Raptor at Ser792) induced by metformin (Fig. 6A). Conversely, the incubation of hepatocytes in glucose-free medium containing lactate and pyruvate led to greater metformin-induced AMPK phosphorylation than that in hepatocytes incubated with 5 or 25 mm glucose for 8 h (Fig. 6B). We obtained similar results with A-769662, a direct small molecule AMPK activator (Fig. S1). Furthermore, AMPK and ACC phosphorylation induced by the cell-permeable AMPK activator AICAR was unaltered by treatment with the pancreatic hormone glucagon or insulin (Fig. 7A). In contrast, a comparison of the action of AICAR at various glucose concentrations showed AMPK phosphorylation to be stimulated to a greater extent in glucose-free medium containing lactate and pyruvate plus glucagon than in medium containing only 5 mm glucose or 25 mm glucose plus insulin (Fig. 7B). In summary, AMPK activation in hepatocytes is enhanced by the scarcity of glucose, whereas changes in insulin or glucagon concentrations do not affect its activity.Figure 7Effect of glucose and pancreatic hormone levels on AICAR-mediated AMPK activation in primary hepatocytes. Mouse primary hepatocytes were preincubated for 1 h under various culture conditions, including 5 mm glucose (G5), 5 mm glucose plus 100 nm insulin, or 5 mm glucose plus 100 nm glucagon (A) and 10 mm lactate and 1 mm pyruvate without glucose (L/P) plus 10 nm glucagon, 5 mm glucose (G5), or 25 mm glucose (G25) plus 100 nm insulin (B), and then various concentrations of AICAR (0, 50, 75, 100, or 200 μm) were added to the medium. After 8 h, cells were harvested for Western blot analysis. Immunoblots from hepatocyte lysates were performed using the indicated antibodies.

We tested whether changes in glucose availability could activate AMPK at early time points. Incubation of hepatocytes with a glucose-free medium containing lactate and pyruvate transiently activated AMPK signaling within 2 h (Fig. 8A). Indeed, phosphorylation of α-Thr172-AMPK and its downstream targets ACC and Raptor were maximal at 2 h and nearly returned to basal levels after 8 h (Fig. 8A). In contrast, incubation in a medium containing 5 or 25 mm glucose did not modify AMPK signaling (Fig. 8A). Moreover, AMPK activation induced by the absence of glucose in the culture medium correlated with a low but significant decrease in intracellular ATP levels at 2 h, which was amplified in AMPK-deficient hepatocytes (Fig. 8B). These results indicate that the lack of glucose induces transient activation of AMPK, which acts to adapt hepatocyte metabolism and maintain cellular energy levels. We next assessed AMPK activation in response to various activators at early time points in hepatocytes incubated with various levels of glucose. Activation of AMPK by metformin (Fig. 9) or AICAR (Fig. S2A) was enhanced when hepatocytes were incubated in glucose-free medium containing lactate and pyruvate or with low glucose concentrations (5 mm glucose).

We have recently reported a previously unappreciated role for HSF1 in the regulation of energy metabolism in fat tissues; however, whether HSF1 is differentially expressed in adipose depots and how its levels are regulated in fat tissues remain unclear. Here, we show that HSF1 levels are higher in brown and subcutaneous fat tissues than in those in the visceral depot and that HSF1 is more abundant in differentiated, thermogenic adipocytes. Gene expression experiments indicated that HSF1 is transcriptionally regulated in fat by agents that modulate cAMP levels, by cold exposure, and by pharmacological stimulation of β-adrenergic signaling. An in silico promoter analysis helped identify a putative response element for activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) at −258 to −250 base pairs from the HSF1 transcriptional start site, and electrophoretic mobility shift and ChIP assays confirmed ATF3 binding to this sequence. Furthermore, functional assays disclosed that ATF3 is necessary and sufficient for HSF1 regulation. Detailed gene expression analysis revealed that ATF3 is one of the most highly induced ATFs in thermogenic tissues of mice exposed to cold temperatures or treated with the β-adrenergic receptor agonist CL316,243 and that its expression is induced by modulators of cAMP levels in isolated adipocytes.

ATF3 is known to activate and repress transcription through its binding to the canonical cis-regulatory element 5′-TGACGTCA-3′ via its basic region–leucine zipper domain as a homodimer or heterodimer, in combination with other ATFs or AP-1 transcription factors (12Jadhav K.

Despite the evidence linking ATF3 to cellular stressors, there are currently no data on whether ATF3 levels are regulated by stimuli such as cold or β-adrenergic signaling in adipose depots. We have previously demonstrated that heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) controls the levels of expression of the metabolic coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1-α (PGC1α) and induces thermogenic programs in vivo (13Ma X.

Celastrol protects against obesity and metabolic dysfunction through activation of a HSF1–PGC1α transcriptional axis.Cell Metab. 2015; 22 (26344102): 695-70810.1016/j.cmet.2015.08.005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In the present study we analyzed the expression profile of HSF1 in adipose tissues and the mechanisms of its transcriptional regulation in response to thermogenic cues. Here we provide novel evidence that HSF1 is highly expressed in mature BAT and scWAT and induced by agents that increase cAMP levels in vitro. Furthermore, we show that in vivo, HSF1 mRNA levels are induced by cold exposure and via pharmacological activation of the β-adrenergic receptor signaling pathway. Our detailed analysis of the molecular mechanisms that control HSF1 expression in thermogenic fat cells revealed that HSF1 is regulated by the activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3), which, in turn, is induced in response to thermogenic stimuli. Collectively, our studies provide novel evidence that HSF1 mRNA levels are rapidly up-regulated in response to thermogenic cues and identify for the first time the stress response transcription factor ATF3 as a critical new regulator of HSF1 levels in response to thermogenic signals. We have previously shown that HSF1 can directly control the expression of PGC1α in differentiated brown fat cells (13Ma X. Xu L. Alberobello A.T. Gavrilova O. Bagattin A. Skarulis M. Liu J. Finkel T. Mueller E. Celastrol protects against obesity and metabolic dysfunction through activation of a HSF1–PGC1α transcriptional axis.Cell Metab. 2015; 22 (26344102): 695-70810.1016/j.cmet.2015.08.005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), but the relative levels of HSF1 in different adipose depots have not been previously investigated. To specifically determine the pattern of HSF1 expression in fat tissues in vivo, we analyzed HSF1 mRNA and protein levels in BAT, scWAT, and eWAT isolated from 9-week-old male mice. As shown in Fig. 1A, HSF1 mRNA levels were higher in BAT and scWAT than in eWAT. Western blotting analysis provided further confirmation that HSF1 is present at higher levels in BAT and scWAT than in eWAT (Fig. 1B). Next, we assessed HSF1 expression levels during a time course of brown fat differentiation of stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells derived from mouse scWAT, as well as in the pluripotent mesenchymal cell line 10T1/2. As shown in Fig. 1 (C and D), HSF1 levels are elevated only in differentiated cells. We measured in parallel UCP1 and demonstrated that its levels are induced concomitantly to those of HSF1, confirming that the cells underwent brown-like differentiation (Fig. 1, C and D). These results demonstrate that HSF1 mRNA is selectively elevated in mature thermogenic tissues in vivo and in differentiated brown-like adipocytes in vitro. Given that HSF1 is highly expressed in differentiated brown-like adipocytes (Fig. 1), we assessed whether HSF1 levels are regulated via classic thermogenic signals known to be involved in the control of brown and beige cells functionality (14Gauthier M.S.

To test whether modulators of cAMP levels were able to induce HSF1, we treated brown differentiated SVF cells derived from scWAT with forskolin and observed an increase in HSF1 mRNA and protein levels compared with vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 2A). Increased phospho-CREB levels measured in parallel in the same cells confirmed the effectiveness of forskolin in inducing cAMP-dependent downstream signaling (Fig. 2A). To further investigate the dynamic of HSF1 induction by forskolin and the effects of other cAMP modulators on HSF1 levels, we performed detailed time-course and dose-response analyses in brown-like differentiated 10T1/2 cells and demonstrated that HSF1 mRNA levels are induced by these agents in differentiated cells (Fig. 2, B and C). These results suggest that HSF1 mRNA is regulated in response to modulators of cAMP levels in thermogenic adipocytes. To determine whether HSF1 is regulated in response to classic thermogenic stimuli also in vivo, we analyzed the levels of HSF1 in BAT and scWAT obtained from male and female mice kept either at room temperature or exposed to cold. As shown in Fig. 3 (A and B) HSF1 mRNA levels are up-regulated when compared with those detected in control mice. Analysis of the expression levels of UCP1, a classic marker of brown fat functionality, demonstrated the efficacy of the cold exposure treatment in eliciting thermogenic gene expression (Fig. 3, A and B). To assess the responsiveness of HSF1 to pharmacological activation of β-adrenergic signaling in vivo, we treated male and female mice with the agonist CL316,243 (CL) and showed increased levels of HSF1 in both BAT and scWAT, compared with control treated mice, which occurred in parallel to the expected elevation in UCP1 levels (Fig. 3, C and D). Taken together, these results suggest that HSF1 mRNA expression is regulated in response to thermogenic stimuli both in cells, in vitro, and in vivo in fat tissues of both males and females. Given that ATF/CREB family members, such as ATF2 and CREB, have been shown to be involved in the regulation of the expression of genes involved in thermogenesis (16Kim H.B. Kim W.H. Han K.L.

Among the 13 ATF3 putative responsive elements identified by Genomatix, we chose to analyze the most proximal element located in position −258 to −250 (Fig. 4A) from the transcriptional start site. To assess whether ATF3 indeed binds to the HSF1 promoter at this site, we first performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and demonstrated that nuclear extracts obtained from differentiated 10T1/2 cells treated with forskolin are able to generate a shift when incubated with a labeled probe corresponding to the putative ATF3-binding element identified in silico in position −258 to −250, and a supershift, when an anti-ATF3 antibody was added. To test the specificity of ATF3 binding to this putative site, we tested whether the shift could be annulled if we pretreated nuclear extracts with excess unlabeled oligonucleotides and demonstrated that the binding was competed off. Further analysis using oligonucleotides containing a mutation in the putative ATF3-responsive element demonstrated the inability of these mutated oligonucleotides to generate a shift when incubated with nuclear extracts obtained from differentiated 10T1/2 treated with forskolin (Fig. 4B). To further confirm in vivo the binding of endogenous ATF3 present in brown-like adipocytes treated with forskolin to the HSF1 promoter, we performed ChIP assays. Our results demonstrated that ATF3 occupies the putative response element at position −258 to −250 (Fig. 4C). These data indicate that the ATF3 putative binding motif identified in the proximal region of the HSF1 promoter can recruit ATF3 in forskolin-stimulated 10T1/2 differentiated cells. To further test whether ATF3 is regulated in vivo in response to thermogenic stimuli and to assess the relative induction of ATF3 compared with that of other ATF family members, we assessed the levels of all ATFs factors in fat depots in response to cold, compared with room temperature. Our results demonstrated that ATF3 is the most highly induced in BAT in response to these stimuli (Fig. 5A and Fig. S1) and among the factors with the highest induction in scWAT. Further analysis of fat tissue samples obtained from vehicle- and CL-treated mice revealed that ATF3 is the most highly induced ATF factor in both BAT and scWAT in response to this β-adrenergic agonist, compared with control treated mice (Fig. 5B). Although ATF3 appears to be similarly induced in males and females in response to cold and pharmacological stimuli in BAT and scWAT, other ATF family members, such as ATF4, 5, 6, and 7 showed differential inducibility between males and females, which appeared to be depot- and stimulus-dependent. These data suggest distinct mechanisms in males and females underlying the regulation of the expression of these genes. Comparison of the basal, unstimulated levels of all the ATFs demonstrated that ATF3 mRNAs are higher, or comparable, to those of ATF4, 5, 6, and 7 and CREB but lower than ATF1 and 2, in both BAT and scWAT, with the exception of ATF4, which appears to be higher than ATF3 selectively in BAT (Fig. S2). Given that ATFs family members are known to bind to DNA either as homodimers or heterodimers (18Hai T. Wolfgang C.D. Marsee D.K. Allen A.E. Sivaprasad U. ATF3 and stress responses.Gene Expr. 1999; 7 (10440233): 321-335PubMed Google Scholar) and because ATF6 is the second most highly induced ATF factor after ATF3 in BAT in males (Fig. 5, A and B), we sought to investigate whether ATF6 may participate in HSF1 regulation via heterodimerization with ATF3 and via binding to the HSF1 promoter. As shown in Fig. S3, ATF3 antibodies did not immunoprecipitate ATF6 in differentiated adipocytes, and no occupancy of ATF6 at the HSF1 promoter at the −258 to −250 site was observed in these cells by ChIP assays. Given the paucity of data on the regulation of ATF3 levels in adipocytes, we assessed whether ATF3 is expressed in differentiated cells and whether its levels may be controlled by compounds that modulate cAMP. As shown in Fig. 5 (C and D), modulators of cAMP levels increased ATF3 mRNAs in differentiated SVF cells isolated from scWAT and in 10T1/2 cells (Fig. 5, C and D). ATF3 appeared to be the most highly induced among all ATF family members also in response to modulators of cAMP levels in vitro, similar to what observed in vivo (Fig. 5, C and D). Taken together these results demonstrate for the first time that ATF3 expression is highly regulated at the transcriptional level by thermogenic stimuli, both in vitro and in vivo. To confirm that ATF3 directly modulates HSF1 levels in response to thermogenic signals, we performed luciferase assays and gain- and loss-of-function studies. We first generated a HSF1 promoter reporter gene linked to luciferase containing 2 kb of the sequence upstream of the HSF1 transcription start site, which includes the putative ATF3-binding motif we newly identified. In addition to this WT-HSF1 promoter luciferase construct, we generated also a reporter containing a mutated putative ATF3-responsive element to assess its requirement for HSF1 regulation. As shown in Fig. 6A, luciferase assays revealed that the ATF3-binding site is required for the induction of the reporter gene in response to forskolin, confirming the involvement of the ATF3-binding motif located in the proximal promoter region in the regulation of HSF1 gene expression. Co-expression of ATF3 with the reporter constructs demonstrated that luciferase activity is induced only when ATF3 is co-transfected with the WT-HSF1 promoter but not in the presence of the mutated reporter (Fig. 6B). These results demonstrate that ATF3 is required for the induction of the HSF1 promoter luciferase reporter. To further establish the sufficiency and necessity of ATF3 for the regulation of the expression of endogenous HSF1 in cells, we performed gain- and loss-of-function experiments. As shown in Fig. 6C, overexpression of ATF3 in differentiated 10T1/2 cells led to the induction of HSF1, whereas ATF3 knockdown decreased HSF1 levels (Fig. 6D). All together, these data point for the first time to ATF3 as a novel regulator of HSF1 levels in brown and beige fat in response to classic extrinsic signals that control thermogenesis. To assess whether ATF3 expression is required for the induction of UCP1 in brown-like adipocytes in vitro, we performed gain- and loss-of-ATF3-function in brown-like differentiated cells. As shown in Fig. 7 (A and B), ATF3 is sufficient and necessary to induce UCP1 in brown adipocytes. To test whether ATF3 requires the induction of HSF1 to regulate UCP1 in brown-like adipocytes, we assessed the effects of ATF3 overexpression on the levels of UCP1 in the presence or absence of HSF1. As shown in Fig. 7C, ATF3-mediated induction of UCP1 is reduced when HSF1 is knocked down. These results suggest that HSF1 is required, at least in part, for ATF3-mediated regulation of the brown fat functional marker UCP1. We have previously demonstrated that the stress-induced heat shock factor HSF1 is a novel regulator of energy metabolism, involved in the induction of the expression of the metabolic coactivator PGC1α in thermogenic cells (13Ma X.

Celastrol protects against obesity and metabolic dysfunction through activation of a HSF1–PGC1α transcriptional axis.Cell Metab. 2015; 22 (26344102): 695-70810.1016/j.cmet.2015.08.005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). However, the questions of whether HSF1 is depot-selectively expressed in mature fat tissues in vivo and whether its levels are transcriptionally controlled in these fat tissues by classic stimuli that regulate the functionality of thermogenic adipose tissues have remained unanswered. The results presented here provide for the first time evidence that HSF1 is expressed at higher levels in thermogenic adipocytes and brown fat tissues than in classic white adipocytes, that HSF1 is induced in response to thermogenic stimuli in vitro and in vivo, and that it is transcriptionally controlled by the stress-induced transcription factor ATF3. It has been previously shown that cold and β-adrenergic stimulation can rapidly induce the expression of factors involved in brown fat thermogenesis and functionality in fat tissues (17Cao W.

Our data showing that cold exposure and elevation of cAMP levels lead to an increase in HSF1 mRNA levels provide the first evidence demonstrating that HSF1 is transcriptionally controlled by thermogenic stimuli in adipocytes and brown/beige fat tissues. These results pointing to a rapid induction of HSF1 levels is interesting in light of the fact that HSF1 has been previously shown to be predominantly regulated at the post-translational level in other tissues (21Vihervaara A. Sistonen L. HSF1 at a glance.J. Cell Sci. 2014; 127 (24421309): 261-26610.1242/jcs.132605Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Our data link for the first time the stress-inducible transcription factor ATF3 to the transcriptional control of HSF1 by demonstrating that ATF3 binds to an upstream regulatory sequence present in the proximal region of the HSF1 promoter and that it is required for HSF1 induction. In addition, our in-depth analysis of the pattern of expression of ATF3 in fat tissues revealed that ATF3 is turned on at the transcriptional level in brown and beige tissues by thermogenic stimuli. These data suggest a possible role for ATF3 in the positive regulation of thermogenic responses via transactivation of HSF1, in addition to ATF3 recently described repressive effects on carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein and stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (22Cheng C.F.

Further molecular studies focusing on the promoter of ATF3 will determine the specific mechanisms through which cAMP elevation leads to ATF3 transcriptional regulation in adipocytes. Our survey of the levels of ATF family members in response to cold exposure and CL treatment has revealed for the first time that ATF3 is among the ATFs most highly induced at the transcriptional level by these stimuli in adipose tissue, supporting a critical role for ATF3 in the regulation of transcriptional responses to thermogenic stimuli leading to control of brown/beige fat tissue functionality. Although it has been shown that mice with total ablation of ATF3 develop obesity and insulin resistance (23Kim S. Song N.J. Bahn G. Chang S.H. Yun U.J. Ku J.M. Jo D.G. Park K.W.

Future studies involving the generation of new animal models with conditional knockout of ATF3 in adipose tissues will reveal the extent of ATF3 contribution to thermogenic functionality in fat tissues. Overall our data demonstrating that HSF1 is selectively expressed in brown/beige fat, that both HSF1 and ATF3 are turned on in response to thermogenic cues, and that ATF3 controls HSF1 levels provide novel insights into the specific molecular mechanisms controlling brown and beige fat functionality in response to thermogenic signals.

MBCs are fundamental to successful medical interventions such as vaccinations and therapy in autoimmunity. However, their lifestyle and anatomic residence remain enigmatic in humans. Extrapolation from animal studies serves as a conceptual basis but might be misleading due to major anatomical distinctions between species.Multicolor immunofluorescence stainings on fixed and unfixed frozen tissue sections were established using primary antibodies coupled to haptens and secondary signal amplification. The simultaneous detection of five different fluorescence signals enabled the localization and characterization of human CD27+CD20+Ki67- mBCs for the first time within one section using laser scanning microscopy. As a result, human tonsillar mBCs were initially identified within their complex microenvironment and their relative location to naïve B cells, plasma cells and T cells could be directly studied and compared to the human splenic mBC niche. In all investigated tonsils (n = 15), mBCs appeared to be not only located in a so far subepithelial defined area but were also follicle associated with a previous undescribed gradual decline towards the follicular mantle comparable to human spleen. However, mBC areas around secondary follicles with large germinal centers (GCs) in tonsils showed interruptions and a general widening towards the epithelium while in spleen the mBC-containing marginal zones (MZ) around smaller GCs were relatively broad and symmetrical. Considerably fewer IgM+IgD+/- pre-switch compared to IgA+ or IgG+ post-switch mBCs were detected in tonsils in contrast to spleen.This study extends existing insights into the anatomic residence of human mBCs showing structural similarities of the superficial follicular area in human spleen and tonsil. Our data support the debate of renaming the human splenic MZ to 'superficial zone' in order to be aware of the differences in rodents and, moreover, to consider this term equally for the human palatine tonsil."

For the giant senecios (Dendrosenecio), the endemic landmarks of the East African sky islands, it has also been suggested that parallel adaptation has been important for within-lineage differentiation. To test this hypothesis and to address potential gene flow and hybridization among the isolated sky islands, we organized field expeditions to all major mountains. We sampled all currently accepted species and all but one subspecies and genotyped 460 plants representing 109 populations. We tested whether genetic structuring corresponds to geography, as predicted by a parallel adaptation hypothesis, or to altitudinal belt and habitat rather than mountains, as predicted by a hypothesis of a single origin of adaptations. Bayesian and Neighbor-Net analyses showed that the main genetic structure is shallow and largely corresponds to geography, supporting a hypothesis of recent, rapid radiation via parallel altitude/habitat adaptation on different mountains. We also found evidence for intermountain admixture, suggesting several long-distance dispersals by wind across vast areas of unsuitable habitat. The combination of parallel adaptation, secondary contact, and hybridization may explain the complex patterns of morphological variation and the contradicting taxonomic treatments of these rare enigmatic giants, supporting the use of wide taxonomic concepts. Notably, the within-population genetic diversity was very low and calls for increased conservation efforts."

Study design Cross-sectional observational study. Setting Tertiary referral center. Subjects and methods Two hundred seventy-six, non-smoker male wood workers and equal number of non-smoker male office workers, referred to pulmonology clinic included in this study. Evaluation of study participants included completion of a questionnaire regarding respiratory symptoms and baseline spirometry was measured according to the actual recommendations. Results Respiratory symptoms including cough, phlegm, chest tightness, and wheezing were significantly higher in wood workers than office workers (40.2% versus 29.3% for cough, p = 0.0073; 40.6% versus 23.6% for phlegm, p<0.0001; 38.0% versus 23.1% for chest tightness, p = 0.0001; 25.3% versus 14.5% for wheezing, p = 0.0014). No statistically significant differences were observed for Dyspnea, and upper respiratory tract symptoms among wood workers compared to office workers. While wood workers were more likely to require spirometry test than office workers (21.4% versus 5.4%, p<0.001) the obstructive changes were more prevalent on spirometry test in wood workers (71.4% obstructive pattern versus 28.6% restrictive pattern). Spirometry test revealed the mean values of FEV1 and FEV1/FVC ratio were significantly lower in the wood workers, compared to their mean values in the control group. Conclusion Respiratory symptoms associated with work, are more prevalent among wood workers than office workers. Our data revealed that workplace exposure to hardwood dust may compromise respiratory function, indicating the importance and the need for optimizing preventive measures in workplace to protect the respiratory health among exposed workers. Obstructive changes on pulmonary function test is a dominant pathologic pattern in pulmonary function test among wood workers. Further investigation is required by current available tools such as nasal cytology to detect influence of wood dust exposure on the upper respiratory airway."

Although systematic population-based screening is not recommended, there is room to experience new strategies for improving early diagnosis of the disease in high risk subjects. We report the results of an opportunistic screening for diabetes, implemented in the setting of community pharmacies.To identify people at high risk to develop diabetes, pharmacists were trained to administer FINDRISC questionnaire to overweight, diabetes-free customers aged 45 or more. Each interviewee was followed for 365 days, searching in the administrative database whether he/she had a glycaemic or HbA1c test, or a diabetologists consultation, and to detect any new diagnosis of diabetes defined by either a prescription of any anti-hyperglycaemic drug, or the enrolment in the register of patients, or a hospital discharge with a diagnosis of diabetes. Out of 5977 interviewees, 53% were at risk of developing diabetes. An elevated FINDRISC score was associated with higher age, lower education, and living alone. Excluding the number of cases expected, based on the incidence rate of diabetes in the population, 51 new cases were identified, one every 117 interviews. FINDRISC score, being a male and living alone were significantly associated with the diagnosis.The implementation of a community pharmacy-based screening programme can contribute to reduce the burden of the disease, particularly focusing on people at higher risk, such as the elderly and the socially vulnerable."

In this context, the objective of this study was to estimate the ΨW by surface reflectance values and vegetation indices obtained from the Landsat-8/OLI sensor in Minas Gerais—Brazil Several algorithms using OLI bands and vegetation indexes were evaluated and from the correlation analysis, a quadratic algorithm that uses the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) performed better, with a correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.82. Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) was performed to validate the models and the best results were for NDVI quadratic algorithm, presenting a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 27.09% and an R2 of 0.85. Subsequently, the NDVI quadratic algorithm was applied to Landsat-8 images, aiming to spatialize the ΨW estimated in a representative area of regional coffee planting between September 2014 to July 2015. From the proposed algorithm, it was possible to estimate ΨW from Landsat-8/OLI imagery, contributing to drought monitoring in the coffee area leading to cost reduction to the producers."
https://openalex.org/W3011138003,"Sense of agency refers to the feeling of being in control of one’s actions. Previous research has demonstrated that sense of agency is produced through the sensorimotor system, which is involved in comparing internal predictions with sensory feedback in motor control. Therefore, sensorimotor deficits might impair agency through a sensorimotor system malfunction. The present study examined this hypothesis by investigating post-stroke patients who had suffered a subcortical stroke that damaged regions associated with sensorimotor function. To examine agency judgments with respect to motor control, we adopted a self-other attribution task and applied it to post-stroke patients. Participants traced a horizontal straight line and received visual feedback through a cursor on a monitor. The cursor movement reflected either the participants’ actual movement or the movement of an “other” that had been previously recorded. Participants judged whether the cursor movement reflected their own movement (self) or an other’s movement while they engaged in four cycles of the horizontal tracing movement. After each trial, participants reported their self-other judgment on a nine-point scale. Post-stroke patients completed the experiment with their paretic as well as their non-paralyzed upper limbs. Compared to healthy controls, patients made significantly more self-attributions of others’ movements. Interestingly, such misattributions were observed in the patients’ performance using both paretic and non-paralyzed upper limbs. These results suggest that post-stroke patients with sensorimotor deficits form misattributions that cannot be explained solely by the sensorimotor system’s role in motor control. We discuss these misattributions in post-stroke patients in terms of cue integration theory."

Indeed, Br2 vapor is shown to passivate Br-vacancies and associated Pb° in the bulk of macroscopic crystals. Controlling the exposure time can markedly improve the overall stoichiometry for moderate exposures or introduce excessive bromide for long exposures, resulting in p-doping of the crystals. In the low dose passivation regime, Hall effect measurements reveal a ca. 3-fold increase in carrier mobility to ca. 15 cm2V-1s-1, while the p-doping increases the electrical conductivity ca. 10000-fold, including a 50-fold increase in carrier mobility to ca. 150 cm2V-1s-1. The ease of diffusion of Br2 vapor into macroscopic crystals is ascribed to the porosity allowed in rapidly grown crystals through aggregative processes of the colloidal sol during growth of films and macroscopic crystals. This process is believed to form significant growth defects, including open voids, which may be remnants of the escaping solvent at the solidification front. These results suggest that due to the sol-gel-like nature of the growth process, macroscopic perovskite crystals reported in this study are far from perfect and point to possible pathways to improving the optoelectronic properties of these materials. Nevertheless, the ability of the vapor-phase approach to access and tune the bulk chemistry and properties of nominally macroscopic perovskite crystals provides interesting new opportunities to precisely manipulate and functionalize the bulk properties of hybrid perovskite crystals in a noninvasive manner."

We have used Drosophila melanogaster to evaluate the effects of altered Hipk expression on the nervous system and muscle. Using genetic manipulation of Hipk expression we demonstrate that knockdown and over-expression of Hipk produces early adult lethality, possibly due to the effects on the nervous system and muscle involvement. We find that optimal levels of Hipk are critical for the function of dopaminergic neurons and glial cells in the nervous system, as well as muscle. Furthermore, manipulation of Hipk affects the structure of the larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ) by promoting its growth. Hipk regulates the phosphorylation of the synapse-associated cytoskeletal protein Hu-li tai shao (Hts; adducin in mammals) and modulates the expression of two important protein kinases, Calcium-calmodulin protein kinase II (CaMKII) and Partitioning-defective 1 (PAR-1), all of which may alter neuromuscular structure/function and influence lethality.

Very high resolution (VHR) sub-meter satellite images may offer a low-cost and high-efficiency approach to automatically detect craters and estimate UXO density. Machine-learning methods from the meteor crater literature are ill-suited to find bomb craters, which are smaller than meteor craters and have high appearance variation, particularly in spectral reflectance and shape, due to the complex terrain environment. A two-stage learning-based framework is created to address these challenges.

In a second stage, a patch-dependent novel spatial feature is developed through dynamic mean-shift segmentation and SIFT descriptors. We apply the model to a multispectral WorldView-2 image of a Cambodian village, which was heavily bombed during the Vietnam War. The proposed method increased true bomb crater detection by over 160 percent. Comparative analysis demonstrates that our method significantly outperforms typical object-recognition algorithms and can be used for wide-area bomb crater detection. Our model, combined with declassified records and demining reports, suggests that 44 to 50 percent of the bombs in the vicinity of this particular Cambodian village may remain unexploded."
https://openalex.org/W3011484163,"Background For pregnant women with a known cardiac condition or those who develop cardiac disease during pregnancy, there is an increased risk of complications during pregnancy, to both mother and foetus. To reduce this risk, best practice guidelines have been developed and available in South Australia for several years. Measuring clinical practice against the guideline recommendations verifies real-life practice and an essential part of any clinical practice quality improvement project by identifying gaps. This study is the first report on adherence to statewide perinatal guidelines for these women in South Australia. Objectives To evaluate adherence to evidence-based clinical practice perinatal guidelines To identify predictors of adherence. Make comparisons across three practice settings examined. Design A retrospective cross-sectional observational design that analysed data from medical records. Setting Three SA Health public metropolitan, university-affiliated teaching hospitals with an obstetric service within a ten-year timeframe (2003–2013). Participants 271 admissions of women who were categorised as ‘pre-existent’ or ‘newly acquired’ cardiac condition during their pregnancy. Outcome measures Adherence to guidelines was measured using a purposefully designed scoring system across the three sites. The researcher chose a minimum acceptable score of 17 applicable to the ‘newly acquired’ group and 35 for the ‘pre-existent’ group. Results Overall adherence to the perinatal guidelines for the combined groups (n = 271) reported a mean score of 16.3, SD ± 6.7, with a median score of 17. Women in the ‘newly acquired’ group scored less compared to women in the ‘pre-existent’ group (Estimate -2.3, CI -3.9,-0.7). Variance in adherence was observed across the three hospitals (P value <0.0001). The most significant predictor of adherence to guidelines was pre-pregnancy cardiac consultation which increased the likelihood of preconception care by Odds ratio 18.5 (95%, CI 2, 168). Similarly, compliance with mental health screening was associated with improved adherence to antenatal assessments (OR: 11.3(95% CI 4.7, 27.3). Conclusion There was overall suboptimal adherence to the statewide guidelines for women with cardiac conditions in pregnancy. The variance in the level of adherence across the three hospitals correlated with the exposure to higher acuity cases, and that appropriate up- referral to a higher acuity hospital was intrinsically linked to better adherence. Recommendations include preconception counselling, and to ensure that all health practitioners have the skills, sufficient training and time to complete a comprehensive initial antenatal assessment Trial registration ACTRN12617000417381"

The present manuscript contains a redescription of P. warreni involving the syntypes and additional material, as well as formal descriptions of two new species of Pliotrema Regan. All specimens of both new species were found in the western Indian Ocean. Individuals of the first new species, hereafter referred to as P. kajae sp. nov., were identified originating from Madagascar and the Mascarene Ridge. Specimens of the second new species, hereafter referred to as P. annae sp. nov., were only found off Zanzibar. Pliotrema kajae sp. nov. appears to inhabit upper insular slopes and submarine ridges at depths of 214–320 m, P. annae sp. nov. so far is only known from shallow waters (20–35 m). Both new species differ from P. warreni in a number of characteristics including the known distribution range and fresh coloration. Taxonomical differences include barbels that are situated approximately half way from rostral tip to mouth, with prebarbel length equidistant from barbel origin to symphysis of the upper jaw in P. kajae sp. nov. and P. annae sp. nov. (vs. about two thirds way from rostral tip to mouth, with prebarbel length about twice the distance from barbel origin to symphysis of upper jaw in P. warreni) and rostra that are clearly and slightly constricted between barbel origin and nostrils, respectively (vs. rostrum not constricted). Pliotrema kajae sp. nov. differs from P. annae sp. nov. in a longer snout, more numerous large lateral rostral teeth and upper jaw tooth rows, jaw teeth with (vs. without) sharp basal folds, and coloration, particularly pale to light brown (vs. medium to dark brown) dorsal coloration with (vs. without) two indistinct yellowish stripes.

https://openalex.org/W3011560649,"Orientation selectivity is a fundamental property of primary visual encoding. High-level processing stages also show some form of orientation dependence, with face identification preferentially relying on horizontally-oriented information. How high-level orientation tuning emerges from primary orientation biases is unclear. In the same group of participants, we derived the orientation selectivity profile at primary and high-level visual processing stages using a contrast detection and an identity matching task. To capture the orientation selectivity profile, we calculated the difference in performance between all tested orientations (0, 45, 90, and 135°) for each task and for upright and inverted faces, separately. Primary orientation selectivity was characterized by higher sensitivity to oblique as compared to cardinal orientations. The orientation profile of face identification showed superior horizontal sensitivity to face identity. In each task, performance with upright and inverted faces projected onto qualitatively similar a priori models of orientation selectivity. Yet the fact that the orientation selectivity profiles of contrast detection in upright and inverted faces correlated significantly while such correlation was absent for identification indicates a progressive dissociation of orientation selectivity profiles from primary to high-level stages of orientation encoding. Bayesian analyses further indicate a lack of correlation between the orientation selectivity profiles in the contrast detection and face identification tasks, for upright and inverted faces. From these findings, we conclude that orientation selectivity shows distinct profiles at primary and high-level stages of face processing and that a transformation must occur from general cardinal attenuation when processing basic properties of the face image to horizontal tuning when encoding more complex properties such as identity."
https://openalex.org/W3012307243,"It has been demonstrated in numerous studies that bee pollen supplementation shows numerous positive effects on health. However, its impact on bones is largely unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of bee pollen supplementation on the tibia biomechanical properties and bone morphometric measures using Japanese quail as an animal model. The experiment was arranged in a 2x2x2 factorial design, with sex, quail line (meat-type or egg-lying type), and bee pollen inclusion (0 or 10 g/kg of feed) as factors. The quails were one-day-old at the beginning of the experiment, they were euthanized after 42 days. Our study showed for the first time unfavorable effects of bee pollen on bones properties. Bee pollen supplementation negatively affected bone structure, irrespective of quails' sex or line type. Bone length (P < 0.001), weight (P < 0.01), and mean relative wall thickness (P < 0.01) and mineralization (P < 0.05) were reduced by bee pollen treatment. For female quails, irrespective of line type, the decrease of yield load (P < 0.001), ultimate load (P < 0.01), yield stress (P < 0.001) and ultimate stress (P < 0.05) was noted. Analysis of growth plate in bone metaphysis showed that bee pollen supplementation slowed the process of bone maturation irrespective of sex (P < 0.05). On contrary, dietary bee pollen positively affected bone homeostasis of trabecular bone in bone metaphysis as bone mineral density increased in experimental groups (P < 0.05). In males, this was the result of the increase of trabecular thickness (P < 0.01), in females due to the reduction of trabecular space (P < 0.001). In conclusion, our results demonstrate that bee pollen (1.0%, 10 g/kg of feed) supplementation caused significant negative effects on the mechanical endurance of the tibia of quails, while showed beneficial effects on trabecular bone histomorphometry."
https://openalex.org/W3011004838,"To understand the influence of user interface on task performance and situation awareness, three levels of user interface were designed based on the three-level situation awareness model for the 3-player diner's dilemma game. The 3-player diner's dilemma is a multiplayer version of the prisoner's dilemma, in which participants play games with two computer players and try to achieve high scores. A total of 117 participants were divided into 3 groups to participate in the experiment. Their task performance (the dining points) was recorded and their situation awareness scores were measured with the Situation Awareness Global Assessment Technique. The results showed that (1) the level-3 interface effectively improved the task performance and situation awareness scores, while the level-2 interface failed to improve them; (2) the practice effect did exist in all three conditions; and (3) the levels of user interface had no effect on the task learning process, implying that the learning rules remained consistent across different conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3012057773,"To translate and adapt cross-culturally the De Morton Mobility Index from English to Brazilian Portuguese. Furthermore, to test the content validity, reliability, construct validity, interpretability and responsiveness for older hospitalized patients.After we carried out the translation and the cross-cultural adaptation of the De Morton Mobility Index and its administration instructions according to international guidelines, the content validity of De Morton Mobility Index was tested by experienced physiotherapists. In the sequence, the reliability, construct validity, interpretability and responsiveness were tested in a test-retest design with 93 older patients hospitalized in ward for clinical reasons. The reliability was tested by Cronbach's alpha coefficient (internal consistency), standard error measurement (agreement), and interclass correlation coefficients (intra and inter-examiner reliability). The construct validity was tested by Pearson's correlation between the De Morton Mobility Index score and the number of steps. Interpretability was analyzed by determining the minimum detectable change and the floor and ceiling effects (frequency of maximum and minimum scoring). Responsiveness was analyzed by effect size.The Brazilian version of the De Morton Mobility Index was made and adapted. The internal consistency (α = 0.89), reliability intra-(ICC = 0.94) and inter-examiners (ICC = 0.82), agreement were all adequate. The De Morton Mobility Index is validity when correlated with number of steps (r = 0.46). Floor or ceiling effects (<15%) were not observed and the responsiveness was high (ES = 3.65).The De Morton Mobility Index has shown adequate reliability, validity, interpretability and responsiveness for the evaluation of the mobility of older hospitalized patients."
https://openalex.org/W3012157426,"Introduction Millions of women and girls have been exposed to female genital cutting (FGC). The practice of FGC extends beyond countries in Africa and Asia in which it is traditionally practiced. Women living with FGC in Norway have been reported to be in need of healthcare, but there is evidence of suboptimal use of healthcare services among this group, and we lack the women’s perspective about this problem. This study aims to explore the experiences and perceptions hindering access and use of the Norwegian healthcare system among sub- Saharan African (SSA) immigrant women exposed to FGC. Method This qualitative research was conducted using purposive and snowball sampling to recruit thirteen SSA immigrant women in Norway previously exposed to FGC. Interviews were conducted from October 2017 to July 2018. The Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis method was used. Results The findings indicate that women experience barriers both in reaching out to the healthcare system and within the healthcare system. Barriers prior to contact with the healthcare system include lack of information, husband and family influence on healthcare, and avoiding disclosing health problems. Barriers within the healthcare system include care providers with insufficient knowledge and poor attitudes of care providers. Conclusion This study reveals multiple barriers to healthcare access that co-exist and overlap. This indicates that SSA immigrant women are ‘left behind’ in being able to access and use the Norwegian healthcare system. Therefore, appropriate interventions to improve access to healthcare should be considered in order to reach Universal Health Coverage, thus having a positive impact on the health of these women. Equitable healthcare should be reflected in policy and practice."
https://openalex.org/W3012184134,"Prunus rootstock belonging to subgenera Amygdalus (peach), Prunus (plum) and Cerasus (cherry) are either from the same species as the scion or another one. The number of inter-species (including inter-subgenera) hybrids has increased as a result of broadening the genetic basis for stress (biotic and abiotic) resistance/tolerance. Identifying genes associated with important traits and responses requires expression analysis. Relative quantification is the simplest and most popular alternative, which requires reference genes (housekeeping) to normalize RT-qPCR data. However, there is a scarcity of validated housekeeping genes for hybrid Prunus rootstock species. This research aims to increase the number of housekeeping genes suitable for Prunus rootstock expression analysis. Twenty-one candidate housekeeping genes were pre-selected from previous RNAseq data that compared the response of root transcriptomes of two rootstocks subgenera to hypoxia treatment, 'Mariana 2624' (P. cerasifera Ehrh.× P. munsoniana W. Wight & Hedrick), and 'Mazzard F12/1' (P. avium L.). Representing groups of low, intermediate or high levels of expression, the genes were assayed by RT-qPCR at 72 hours of hypoxia treatment and analyzed with NormFinder software. A sub-set of seven housekeeping genes that presented the highest level of stability were selected, two with low levels of expression (Unknown 3, Unknown 7) and five with medium levels (GTB 1, TUA 3, ATPase P, PRT 6, RP II). The stability of these genes was evaluated under different stress conditions, cold and heat with the hybrid 'Mariana 2624' and N nutrition with the hybrids 'Colt' (P. avium × P. pseudocerasus Lindl.) and 'Garnem' [P. dulcis Mill.× (P. persica L.× P. davidiana Carr.)]. The algorithms of geNorm and BestKeeper software also were used to analyze the performance of these genes as housekeepers. Stability rankings varied according to treatments, genotypes and the software for evaluation, but the gene GBT 1 often had the highest ranking. However, most of the genes are suitable depending on the stressor and/or genotype to be evaluated. No optimal number of reference genes could be determined with geNorm software when all conditions and genotypes were considered. These results strongly suggest that relative RT-qPCR should be analyzed separately with their respective best housekeeper according to the treatment and/or genotypes in Prunus spp. rootstocks."
https://openalex.org/W3011475489,"Baseball pitchers use various pitch types to reduce hitting accuracy, but little is understood of the practical strategy of using visuomotor skills and timing control to respond to different pitches. This study examined 1) effectiveness of pitch type combinations, and 2) relationship between the presence and absence of advance information about the next pitch and the timing error. Twenty-six high school baseball players hit a ball launched from a pitching machine in a combination of fastballs (34.3±1.3 m·s-1), curveballs (25.4±1.0 m·s-1), and slowballs (25.5±0.9 m·s-1). Each participant performed three conditions. (1) Continuity condition (15 trials), in which the same pitch type was thrown five times consecutively. (2) Random condition (30 trials), in which pitch type was not preliminarily conveyed to the participants. (3) Open condition (20 trials), in which the next pitch type was preliminarily conveyed to participants. Participants' hitting movement was recorded by an optical motion capture system and force platform. We calculated timing error based on the difference between the measured impact location (ball position relative to the batter's body at ball-bat impact) and optimal impact location. The timing error between n-th pitch type, (n-1)-th pitch, and the presence or absence of advance information about pitch type (open vs random condition) were analyzed using three-way repeated ANOVA. The results showed that the (n-1)-th pitch type did not affect the timing of impact (p = 0.338). In contrast, the timing errors in open conditions were fewer compared to random conditions (p < 0.001). These results indicate that the pitch type sequence has insignificant effects, and advance information about pitches affects the timing errors. Therefore, having two or more pitch types, reducing the fluctuation of the pitching motion, and the early trajectory of the ball between different pitches potentially lead to increase timing errors."
https://openalex.org/W3011579095,"In recent years, animated situation comedies (generally known as animated sitcoms) have gained widespread popularity among young adults. Animated sitcoms often dissect sensitive social and political concerns using negative humor, exaggeration, and stereotyping. The present study aimed to explore the motives for viewing animated sitcoms using qualitative and quantitative research methods and investigate their associations with humor styles, positivity, and self-criticism in a sample of Hungarian viewers. A total of 816 Hungarian adults (54.5% female; Mage = 23.9 years, SD = 5.6) completed an online questionnaire focusing on animated sitcom viewing habits and other relevant psychological constructs. As a result, three major motive dimensions were identified: (1) social criticism, (2) fun and entertainment, and (3) relaxation. These motives were assessed by the Motives for Animated Sitcom Viewing Questionnaire (MASVQ), which demonstrated strong psychometric properties. Using a MIMIC model, multiple associations were described across motives and other psychological constructs, indicating that individuals with different levels of humor, positivity, and self-criticism are motivated to view animated sitcoms for different reasons in this sample of Hungarian viewers."
