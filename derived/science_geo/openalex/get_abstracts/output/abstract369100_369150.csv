https://openalex.org/W2129355962,"Human breast tumors contain a breast cancer stem cell (BCSC) population with properties reminiscent of normal stem cells. We found 37 microRNAs that were differentially expressed between human BCSCs and nontumorigenic cancer cells. Three clusters, miR-200c-141, miR-200b-200a-429, and miR-183-96-182 were downregulated in human BCSCs, normal human and murine mammary stem/progenitor cells, and embryonal carcinoma cells. Expression of BMI1, a known regulator of stem cell self-renewal, was modulated by miR-200c. miR-200c inhibited the clonal expansion of breast cancer cells and suppressed the growth of embryonal carcinoma cells in vitro. Most importantly, miR-200c strongly suppressed the ability of normal mammary stem cells to form mammary ducts and tumor formation driven by human BCSCs in vivo. The coordinated downregulation of three microRNA clusters and the similar functional regulation of clonal expansion by miR-200c provide a molecular link that connects BCSCs with normal stem cells.

Cancers arise in tissues and organs that contain proliferating cells that regenerate old and damaged cells. Typically, these tissues are maintained by stem cells that have the ability to self-renew, a process by which the stem cells maintain the ability to undergo extensive proliferation while preserving the undifferentiated state. The stem cells also produce progeny that undergo a series of cell divisions in which they become progressively more differentiated before reaching maturation. Like the tissues from which they arise, solid tumors are composed of a heterogeneous population of cells, and many properties of normal stem cells are shared by at least a subset of cancer cells (Lobo et al., 2007Lobo N.A.

Molecular heterogeneity of breast carcinomas and the cancer stem cell hypothesis.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 791-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). To maintain tissue homeostasis, normal stem cells must be able to undergo a large number of mitoses, and in many tissues they must be able to migrate to different regions of the organ. Both of these properties are reminiscent of two hallmark properties of cancer cells, immortality and invasion. The fact that tumors contain heterogeneous populations of cells at various stages of maturation and that cancer cells share properties of normal stem cells led to the speculation that tumors may contain a cancer stem cell population that drives the growth of the tumor (Bruce and Gaag, 1963Bruce W.R.

Genetic studies in leukemia patients demonstrated that a primitive leukemia cell can give rise to fully mature nonreplicating progeny, showing that not all cancer cells have the ability to form tumors (Fialkow, 1976aFialkow P.J.

With improvements in isolation of both normal and cancer stem cells, there is now a growing body of evidence that in at least some cases of both human and mouse leukemia, as well as human and mouse epithelial tumors such as breast, colon, head and neck, skin, and brain cancer, a cancer stem cell population can be enriched based on phenotype (Al-Hajj et al., 2003Al-Hajj M.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding regulatory RNAs that regulate the translation of mRNAs by inhibiting ribosome function, decapping the 5′ Cap structure, deadenylating the poly(A) tail, and degrading the target mRNA (Filipowicz et al., 2008Filipowicz W. Bhattacharyya S.N. Sonenberg N. Mechanisms of post-transcriptional regulation by microRNAs: are the answers in sight?.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2008; 9: 102-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (3857) Google Scholar). miRNAs are able to regulate expression of hundreds of target mRNAs simultaneously, thus controlling a variety of cell functions including cell proliferation, stem cell maintenance, and differentiation. One of the best studied miRNAs, let-7 in Caenorhabditis elegans, was initially identified by genetic analysis of mutants with defects in developmental timing (Reinhart et al., 2000Reinhart B.J. Slack F.J. Basson M. Pasquinelli A.E. Bettinger J.C. Rougvie A.E. Horvitz H.R. Ruvkun G. The 21-nucleotide let-7 RNA regulates developmental timing in Caenorhabditis elegans.Nature. 2000; 403: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (3502) Google Scholar). Subsequently, Dicer was identified as a key enzyme of miRNA processing and function; Dicer null mutations result in embryonic lethality and depletion of stem cells (Bernstein et al., 2003Bernstein E. Kim S.Y. Carmell M.A. Murchison E.P. Alcorn H. Li M.Z. Mills A.A. Elledge S.J. Anderson K.V. Hannon G.J. Dicer is essential for mouse development.Nat. Genet. 2003; 35: 215-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (1479) Google Scholar). In addition, tissue-specific deletion of Dicer affects self-renewal of embryonic stem cells, development of B lymphocyte lineage cells, and tissue morphogenesis (Chen et al., 2008Chen J.F. Murchison E.P. Tang R. Callis T.E. Tatsuguchi M. Deng Z. Rojas M. Hammond S.M.

Rajewsky N. et al.Dicer ablation affects antibody diversity and cell survival in the B lymphocyte lineage.Cell. 2008; 132: 860-874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). In the skin, miR-203 is a critical regulator of stem cell maintenance (Yi et al., 2008Yi R. Poy M.N. Stoffel M. Fuchs E. A skin microRNA promotes differentiation by repressing ‘stemness’.Nature. 2008; 452: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Deletion of DGCR8, another key enzyme for miRNA processing, alters silencing of self-renewal genes in embryonic stem cells (Wang et al., 2007Wang Y. Medvid R. Melton C. Jaenisch R. Blelloch R. DGCR8 is essential for microRNA biogenesis and silencing of embryonic stem cell self-renewal.Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 380-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). These findings demonstrate that miRNAs are critical regulators of self-renewal and differentiation. Many of the common chromosomal amplifications and deletions seen in cancer contain miRNA-coding sequences, and some miRNAs function as oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes (Calin et al., 2004Calin G.A. Sevignani C. Dumitru C.D. Hyslop T. Noch E. Yendamuri S. Shimizu M. Rattan S. Bullrich F. Negrini M. et al.Human microRNA genes are frequently located at fragile sites and genomic regions involved in cancers.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Cancer. 2006; 6: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (5857) Google Scholar). For example, dysregulation of the miR-17-92 cluster can induce B cell lymphoma and downregulation of let-7 is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis of lung cancer patients (He et al., 2005He L. Thomson J.M. Hemann M.T. Hernando-Monge E. Mu D. Goodson S. Powers S. Cordon-Cardo C. Lowe S.W.

Nimura Y. et al.Reduced expression of the let-7 microRNAs in human lung cancers in association with shortened postoperative survival.Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3753-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (2071) Google Scholar). Expression of let-7 also prevents tumor sphere formation of breast cancer cell lines and inhibits tumorigenicity in an in vivo xenograft tumor assay (Yu et al., 2007Yu F. Yao H. Zhu P. Zhang X. Pan Q. Gong C. Huang Y. Hu X. Su F. Lieberman J. et al.let-7 regulates self-renewal and tumorigenicity of breast cancer cells.Cell. 2007; 131: 1109-1123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). Finally, miRNA expression profiles are correlated with tumor stage, progression, and prognosis of cancer patients (Calin et al., 2005Calin G.A. Ferracin M. Cimmino A. Di Leva G. Shimizu M. Wojcik S.E. Iorio M.V. Visone R. Sever N.I. Fabbri M. et al.A MicroRNA signature associated with prognosis and progression in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.N. Engl. J.

Campiglio M. et al.MicroRNA gene expression deregulation in human breast cancer.Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 7065-7070Crossref PubMed Scopus (3298) Google Scholar). The ability to prospectively identify an enriched population of stem cells enables the interrogation of these cells for clues to the molecular regulators of key stem cell functions. In this report, we undertook a systematic comparison of the miRNAs in breast stem/progenitor cell populations and in their differentiated progeny, and this comparison led to the identification of new regulators shared between normal and cancer stem cells. As miRNAs are critical regulators of self-renewal and differentiation in both normal embryonic and adult tissue stem cells, we compared the miRNA expression profiles between human CD44+CD24−/lowlineage− breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) and the remaining lineage− nontumorigenic breast cancer cells (NTG cells). In many patients with breast cancer, only a subset population of CD44+CD24−/lowlineage− cancer cells is highly tumorigenic in immunodeficient mice, as compared to the remaining lineage− breast cancer cells (Al-Hajj et al., 2003Al-Hajj M. Wicha M.S. Benito-Hernandez A. Morrison S.J. Clarke M.F. Prospective identification of tumorigenic breast cancer cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 3983-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (7899) Google Scholar). The CD44+CD24−/lowlineage− cells have stem cell-like properties such as self-renewal and differentiation and can regenerate the original tumor from as few as 200 cells, whereas tens of thousands of the remaining lineage− nontumorigenic cancer cells cannot. Multiplex real-time PCR was used to measure the expression of 460 miRNAs in BCSCs and NTG cells isolated from three human breast tumors. We found that 37 miRNAs were upregulated or downregulated in BCSCs compared to NTG cells in all three samples analyzed (Figure 1A). The expression of these 37 differentially expressed miRNAs was then measured in a total of 11 sets of human BCSCs and NTG cells, and this analysis confirmed that these 37 miRNAs were indeed differentially expressed (Figure 1B). Three clusters of miRNAs, the miRNA-200c-141 cluster located on chromosome 12p13, the miR-200b-200a-429 cluster located on chromosome 1p36, and the miR-183-96-182 cluster located on chromosome 7q32, were consistently downregulated in human BCSCs (Figures 1B and 1C). For example, expression of miR-200a, miR-200b, and miR-200c was 2 to 218 times lower in BCSCs compared to NTG cells. It is thought that the CD44+CD24−/lowlineage− cells might be malignant counterparts of normal mammary stem or early progenitor cells (Al-Hajj et al., 2003Al-Hajj M. Wicha M.S. Benito-Hernandez A. Morrison S.J. Clarke M.F. Prospective identification of tumorigenic breast cancer cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 3983-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (7899) Google Scholar, Mani et al., 2008Mani S.A. Guo W. Liao M.J. Eaton E.N. Ayyanan A. Zhou A.Y. Brooks M. Reinhard F. Zhang C.C. Shipitsin M. et al.The epithelial-mesenchymal transition generates cells with properties of stem cells.Cell. 2008; 133: 704-715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6231) Google Scholar). Similarly, embryonic carcinoma cells are malignant cells that arise from germ cells, which share many properties with pluripotent stem cells. Thus, the expression of these miRNAs was tested in Tera-2 embryonal carcinoma cells. Notably, Tera-2 cells either fail to express detectable levels of each of the miRNAs, or the level of expression is just at the level of detection (Figure S1 available on line). The miRNA seed sequence serves to direct the miRNA to its mRNA targets (Lewis et al., 2005Lewis B.P. Burge C.B. Bartel D.P. Conserved seed pairing, often flanked by adenosines, indicates that thousands of human genes are microRNA targets.Cell. 2005; 120: 15-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9265) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the miR-200c-141 cluster and the miR-200b-200a-429 cluster are formed by two groups of miRNAs with essentially the same seed sequence (miR-200c/miR-200b/miR-429 miRNAs, and miR-200a/miR-141 miRNAs), which suggests that they might share some common target genes (Figure 1C). Given this similarity and the observed expression patterns, we suggest that downregulation of all three of the clustered miRNAs in breast cancer CD44+CD24−/lowlineage− cells and Tera-2 embryonal carcinoma cells may be critical to maintaining a stem cell function in cancer cells. The functional similarities of cancer cells with normal tissue stem cells suggest that activation of normal stem cell self-renewal and/or differentiation pathways account for many of the properties associated with malignancies. We therefore tested early mammary stem and progenitor cells and more differentiated mammary epithelial progenitor cells for the expression of the miRNAs that are differentially expressed by BCSCs and NTG cells. We first performed this analysis in mouse where the mammary epithelium is better understood; CD24medCD49fhighCD29highSca-1− mouse mammary fat pad cells are enriched for mammary stem cells with an ability to regenerate a whole mammary gland in vivo. We collected the CD24medCD49fhighCD45−CD31−CD140a−Ter119− cells (MRUs, mammary repopulating units) that are enriched for mammary stem cells and the CD24highCD49flowCD45−CD31−CD140a−Ter119− cells (MaCFCs) that are enriched for more differentiated mammary epithelial progenitor cells (Figure 2A). We found that all three of the clustered miRNAs that were downregulated in human BCSCs were also downregulated in mouse MRU cells as compared to both MaCFCs and mature epithelial cells (Figures 2B and S2). An analysis of normal human breast epithelial cells isolated based both on CD44 and CD24 and on the markers recently described by Eaves and colleagues (Eirew et al., 2008Eirew P. Stingl J. Raouf A. Turashvili G. Aparicio S. Emerman J.T. Eaves C.J. A method for quantifying normal human mammary epithelial stem cells with in vivo regenerative ability.Nat. Med. 2008; 14: 1384-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) suggested that most of the 37 miRNAs are also differentially expressed by early human breast progenitors (Figure S3). This supports the notion that the differential expression of these three miRNA clusters between BCSCs and NTG cells is a part of the normal mammary cell developmental pathways. Potential molecular targets of miR-200bc/429 were predicted by TargetScan 4.2 (http://www.targetscan.org/) (Lewis et al., 2005Lewis B.P. Burge C.B. Bartel D.P. Conserved seed pairing, often flanked by adenosines, indicates that thousands of human genes are microRNA targets.Cell. 2005; 120: 15-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9265) Google Scholar). Among the potential targets, we focused on BMI1 because it possessed critically conserved nucleotides indicative of a legitimate target and is known to be essential in regulating self-renewal and differentiation of other stem cell types, including hematopoietic, brain, and mammary stem cells (Molofsky et al., 2005Molofsky A.V. He S. Bydon M. Morrison S.J. Pardal R. Bmi-1 promotes neural stem cell self-renewal and neural development but not mouse growth and survival by repressing the p16Ink4a and p19Arf senescence pathways.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1432-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, Park et al., 2003Park I.K. Qian D. Kiel M. Becker M.W. Pihalja M. Weissman I.L. Morrison S.J. Clarke M.F. Bmi-1 is required for maintenance of adult self-renewing haematopoietic stem cells.Nature. 2003; 423: 302-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1540) Google Scholar, Pietersen et al., 2008Pietersen A.M. Evers B. Prasad A.A. Tanger E. Cornelissen-Steijger P. Jonkers J. van Lohuizen M. Bmi1 regulates stem cells and proliferation and differentiation of committed cells in mammary epithelium.Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 1094-1099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The ability of miR-200c to regulate the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of BMI1 was evaluated via luciferase reporter assays. HEK293 cells, which did not express miR-200c and miR-429 and expressed barely detectable levels of miR-200b (data not shown), were used. The 3′UTR target sites of BMI1 were cloned into pGL3-Control vector, downstream of a luciferase minigene (Figure 3A). HEK293 cells were cotransfected with a pGL3 luciferase vector, pRL-TK Renilla luciferase vector, and miR-200c precursor RNA. We observed that the cotransfection of the miR-200c precursor suppressed the luciferase activity of the vector with the wild-type BMI1 3′UTR by 35% (Figure 3B); moreover, mutation of the miRNA-200bc/429 seed region within the BMI1 3′UTR abrogated the repressive ability of the miRNA, demonstrating specificity of the target sequence for BMI1 (Figures 3A and 3B). The ability of miR-200c to regulate the endogenous BMI1 protein was also tested. To do this, HEK293T cells were transfected with a miR-200c precursor and cells were cultured for 7 days. Western blotting showed that BMI1 protein expression was decreased in cells transfected by miR-200c (Figure 3C). The observation that the same clusters of miRNAs were downregulated in normal mammary stem cells, tumorigenic CD44+CD24-/lowlineage− breast cancer cells, and embryonal carcinoma cells implies that these miRNAs are regulators of critical stem cell functions such as self-renewal and/or differentiation. In addition to suppressing the expression of BMI1, a gene critical for self-renewal in many types of stem cells, it has recently been shown that miR-200 family miRNAs prevent EMT (epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition) by suppressing expression of ZEB1 and ZEB2, two transcriptional repressors of E-cadherin (Christoffersen et al., 2007Christoffersen N.R. Silahtaroglu A. Orom U.A. Kauppinen S.

EMT is a stem cell property that has been linked to both normal and cancer stem cells (Iwashita et al., 2003Iwashita T. Kruger G.M. Pardal R. Kiel M.J. Morrison S.J. Hirschsprung disease is linked to defects in neural crest stem cell function.Science. 2003; 301: 972-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, Mani et al., 2008Mani S.A. Guo W. Liao M.J.

Shipitsin M. et al.The epithelial-mesenchymal transition generates cells with properties of stem cells.Cell. 2008; 133: 704-715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6231) Google Scholar). To determine how expression of these miRNAs affects cells, we infected Tera-2 embryonal carcinoma cells with lentivirus that expresses miR-200c. The morphology of Tera-2 cells infected with miR-200c lentiviruses suggested that they had differentiated (Figure 4A). Indeed, staining with anti-neuron-specific class IIIβ tubulin (TUJ1) antibody showed that miR-200c-infected Tera-2 cells preferentially expressed the early postmitotic neuron marker, TUJ1 antigen, suggesting that the miRNAs had induced neural differentiation (Figure 4B). Flow cytometry analysis confirmed that 36% of miR-200c-expressing Tera-2 cells expressed TUJ1 protein 10 days after infection, as compared to 0.9% of Tera-2 cells infected with the control lentivirus (Figure 4C). We found that Tera-2 cells infected with the miR-200c lentivirus, but not the control lentivirus, showed growth retardation (Figure 4D). Preliminary experiments suggest that miR-200c might also inhibit tumor formation in vivo (Figure S4). MMTV-Wnt-1 murine breast tumors are composed of both luminal and myoepithelial cells and an expanded mammary stem cell pool (Cho et al., 2008Cho R.W. Wang X. Diehn M. Shedden K. Chen G.Y. Sherlock G. Gurney A. Lewicki J. Clarke M.F. Isolation and molecular characterization of cancer stem cells in MMTV-Wnt-1 murine breast tumors.Stem Cells. 2008; 26: 364-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). We infected MMTV-Wnt-1 murine breast cancer cells with a miR-200c-expressing lentivirus. Colony formation by the miR-200c-infected cells was almost completely suppressed, reducing the number of colonies by 96% when compared to cells infected with the control lentivirus (Figure 5A). Flow cytometry can be used to isolate different populations of mammary cells that are enriched for stem cells, committed progenitor cells, or mature epithelial cells. When grown in tissue culture, the cell fraction that is enriched for normal mammary stem/progenitor cells (MRUs) or MMTV-Wnt-1 BCSCs formed colonies that are bi-phenotypic, expressing both the myoepithelial cell cytokeratin CK14 and the epithelial cell cytokeratin CK8/18 (data not shown). Colonies that arise from the mature epithelial cell-enriched population express either CK8/18 or CK19 but not CK14. Cultured myoepithelial-enriched cells express CK14 but not CK8/18 or CK19 (Cho et al., 2008Cho R.W. Wang X. Diehn M. Shedden K. Chen G.Y. Sherlock G. Gurney A. Lewicki J. Clarke M.F.

Breast cancer cells infected with the control virus formed large colonies and expressed CK14 and CK8/18, with an occasional cell that expressed CK19 (Figure 5B), whereas cells infected with the miR-200c-expressing virus formed only small aggregates of cells that showed low levels of CK14 (Figure 5B). To prove functional relevance of BMI1 regulation by miR-200c, we constructed a BMI1-expressing lentivirus in which the BMI1 cDNA does not contain the 3′UTR sequence that is targeted by miR-200c. Coexpression of this BMI1 transgene substantially rescued the defect in colony formation of breast cancer cells infected with the miR-200c lentivirus (Figures 5C and 5D). These results suggest that BMI1 is one of the key functional targets of miR-200c, at least with respect to the ability of miR-200c to suppress colony formation of breast cancer cells in vitro. The observation that the same clusters of miRNAs were downregulated both in normal mammary stem cells and in tumorigenic CD44+CD24−/lowlineage− breast cancer cells and that miR-200c regulates the expression of the self-renewal gene BMI1 as well as EMT suggests that these miRNAs are regulators of normal and cancer stem cell functions such as self-renewal, proliferation, and/or differentiation. To clarify the role of miR-200c in normal mammary stem cells, we infected 50,000 lineage− murine mammary cells with the miR-200c-expressing lentivirus and transplanted them into cleared mammary fat pads of syngeneic mice. Noninfected (mock) and control lentivirus-infected mammary cells were transplanted as controls. Overall, 8 out of 18 transplants with noninfected mammary cells showed formation of a mammary tree, and 11 out of 20 transplants using cells infected with a control lentivirus formed a GFP-positive mammary tree, suggesting that lentivirus infection was highly efficient and did not perturb engraftment of mammary cells (Figure 6A). Histological and immunohistochemical analysis of mammary trees infected with control lentivirus showed normal structure and differentiation of both luminal and myoepithelial lineage mammary cells (Figure 6B). By contrast, using the mammary cells infected with miR-200c-expressing lentivirus, only 1 GFP-positive mammary tree was formed out of 18 transplants, whereas 6 transplants formed an aberrant, disorganized structure with a small cluster of mammary cells (Figures 6A and 6C). Similar to the miR-200c-infected breast cancer cells, the engrafted miR-200c-expressing mammary cells exclusively expressed CK14 but not CK8/18 (Figure 6C), suggesting induction of myoepithelial cell differentiation by miR-200c. We previously found that in many patients' tumors, the CD44+CD24−/lowlineage− cells (BCSCs"

This is only partly achieved by classical mass spectrometry or affinity-based methods. We applied a targeted proteomics approach based on selected reaction monitoring (SRM) to detect and quantify proteins expressed to a concentration below 50 copies/cell in total S. cerevisiae digests. The detection range can be extended to single-digit copies/cell and to proteins undetected by classical methods. We illustrate the power of the technique by the consistent and fast measurement of a network of proteins spanning the entire abundance range over a growth time course of S. cerevisiae transiting through a series of metabolic phases. We therefore demonstrate the potential of SRM-based proteomics to provide assays for the measurement of any set of proteins of interest in yeast at high-throughput and quantitative accuracy.
https://openalex.org/W2155945227,"During endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, homeostatic signaling through the unfolded protein response (UPR) augments ER protein-folding capacity. If homeostasis is not restored, the UPR triggers apoptosis. We found that the ER transmembrane kinase/endoribonuclease (RNase) IRE1alpha is a key component of this apoptotic switch. ER stress induces IRE1alpha kinase autophosphorylation, activating the RNase to splice XBP1 mRNA and produce the homeostatic transcription factor XBP1s. Under ER stress--or forced autophosphorylation--IRE1alpha's RNase also causes endonucleolytic decay of many ER-localized mRNAs, including those encoding chaperones, as early events culminating in apoptosis. Using chemical genetics, we show that kinase inhibitors bypass autophosphorylation to activate the RNase by an alternate mode that enforces XBP1 splicing and averts mRNA decay and apoptosis. Alternate RNase activation by kinase-inhibited IRE1alpha can be reconstituted in vitro. We propose that divergent cell fates during ER stress hinge on a balance between IRE1alpha RNase outputs that can be tilted with kinase inhibitors to favor survival."
https://openalex.org/W2057361172,"We have previously reported that the loss of Arx and/or Pax4 gene activity leads to a shift in the fate of the different endocrine cell subtypes in the mouse pancreas, without affecting the total endocrine cell numbers. Here, we conditionally and ectopically express Pax4 using different cell-specific promoters and demonstrate that Pax4 forces endocrine precursor cells, as well as mature alpha cells, to adopt a beta cell destiny. This results in a glucagon deficiency that provokes a compensatory and continuous glucagon+ cell neogenesis requiring the re-expression of the proendocrine gene Ngn3. However, the newly formed alpha cells fail to correct the hypoglucagonemia since they subsequently acquire a beta cell phenotype upon Pax4 ectopic expression. Notably, this cycle of neogenesis and redifferentiation caused by ectopic expression of Pax4 in alpha cells is capable of restoring a functional beta cell mass and curing diabetes in animals that have been chemically depleted of beta cells."
https://openalex.org/W2165615730,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) consists of tubules that are shaped by the reticulons and DP1/Yop1p, but how the tubules form an interconnected network is unknown. Here, we show that mammalian atlastins, which are dynamin-like, integral membrane GTPases, interact with the tubule-shaping proteins. The atlastins localize to the tubular ER and are required for proper network formation in vivo and in vitro. Depletion of the atlastins or overexpression of dominant-negative forms inhibits tubule interconnections. The Sey1p GTPase in S. cerevisiae is likely a functional ortholog of the atlastins; it shares the same signature motifs and membrane topology and interacts genetically and physically with the tubule-shaping proteins. Cells simultaneously lacking Sey1p and a tubule-shaping protein have ER morphology defects. These results indicate that formation of the tubular ER network depends on conserved dynamin-like GTPases. Since atlastin-1 mutations cause a common form of hereditary spastic paraplegia, we suggest ER-shaping defects as a neuropathogenic mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2160947862,"Previous studies have shown that blocking DLL4 signaling reduced tumor growth by disrupting productive angiogenesis. We developed selective anti-human and anti-mouse DLL4 antibodies to dissect the mechanisms involved by analyzing the contributions of selectively targeting DLL4 in the tumor or in the host vasculature and stroma in xenograft models derived from primary human tumors. We found that each antibody inhibited tumor growth and that the combination of the two antibodies was more effective than either alone. Treatment with anti-human DLL4 inhibited the expression of Notch target genes and reduced proliferation of tumor cells. Furthermore, we found that specifically inhibiting human DLL4 in the tumor, either alone or in combination with the chemotherapeutic agent irinotecan, reduced cancer stem cell frequency, as shown by flow cytometric and in vivo tumorigenicity studies."
https://openalex.org/W2115578546,"Pluripotent stem cells self-renew indefinitely and possess characteristic protein-protein networks that remodel during differentiation. How this occurs is poorly understood. Using quantitative mass spectrometry, we analyzed the (phospho)proteome of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) during differentiation induced by bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and removal of hESC growth factors. Of 5222 proteins identified, 1399 were phosphorylated on 3067 residues. Approximately 50% of these phosphosites were regulated within 1 hr of differentiation induction, revealing a complex interplay of phosphorylation networks spanning different signaling pathways and kinase activities. Among the phosphorylated proteins was the pluripotency-associated protein SOX2, which was SUMOylated as a result of phosphorylation. Using the data to predict kinase-substrate relationships, we reconstructed the hESC kinome; CDK1/2 emerged as central in controlling self-renewal and lineage specification. The findings provide new insights into how hESCs exit the pluripotent state and present the hESC (phospho)proteome resource as a complement to existing pluripotency network databases."
https://openalex.org/W2067656182,"Modulation of intracellular chloride concentration ([Cl(-)](i)) plays a fundamental role in cell volume regulation and neuronal response to GABA. Cl(-) exit via K-Cl cotransporters (KCCs) is a major determinant of [Cl(-)](I); however, mechanisms governing KCC activities are poorly understood. We identified two sites in KCC3 that are rapidly dephosphorylated in hypotonic conditions in cultured cells and human red blood cells in parallel with increased transport activity. Alanine substitutions at these sites result in constitutively active cotransport. These sites are highly phosphorylated in plasma membrane KCC3 in isotonic conditions, suggesting that dephosphorylation increases KCC3's intrinsic transport activity. Reduction of WNK1 expression via RNA interference reduces phosphorylation at these sites. Homologous sites are phosphorylated in all human KCCs. KCC2 is partially phosphorylated in neonatal mouse brain and dephosphorylated in parallel with KCC2 activation. These findings provide insight into regulation of [Cl(-)](i) and have implications for control of cell volume and neuronal function."

The extension of the G-rich telomeric strand by telomerase is also believed to be coordinated with the complementary synthesis of the C strand by the conventional replication machinery. However, we show that under telomere length-maintenance conditions in cancer cells, human telomerase extends most chromosome ends during each S phase and is not preferentially recruited to the shortest telomeres. Telomerase rapidly extends the G-rich strand following telomere replication but fill-in of the C strand is delayed into late S phase. This late C-strand fill-in is not executed by conventional Okazaki fragment synthesis but by a mechanism using a series of small incremental steps.

The ends of linear eukaryotic chromosomes are capped by telomeres that protect chromosome termini from degradation, end-to-end fusion and recombination (Blackburn, 2001Blackburn E.H.

Protection of mammalian telomeres.Oncogene. 2002; 21: 532-540Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In human cells, the DNA component of telomeres is composed of ∼5–15 kb of double-stranded 5′-TTAGGG-3′ repeats terminating in a 3′ single-stranded overhang of ∼12–300 bases (Makarov et al., 1997Makarov V.L.

Wright W.E. Quantitative telomeric overhang determination using a double-strand specific nuclease.Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: e14Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Because of the unidirectional nature of DNA polymerase and processing events, human telomeres lose ∼50–200 base pairs during each cell division. Eventually, critically short telomeres trigger replicative senescence or apoptosis (Smogorzewska and De Lange, 2004Smogorzewska A. De Lange T. Regulation of telomerase by telomeric proteins.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 177-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). The majority of tumor cells and germ line cells overcome this proliferative limit by the action of telomerase, a ribonucleoprotein with reverse transcriptase activity that adds telomeric DNA repeats to the 3′ overhang of telomeres (Collins and Mitchell, 2002Collins K. Mitchell J.R. Telomerase in the human organism.Oncogene. 2002; 21: 564-579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Greider and Blackburn, 1985Greider C.W. Blackburn E.H.

An understanding of telomerase biology thus has important implications for both cancer and aging. A central question in telomere biology concerns how telomerase maintains telomere length. Many reports indicate that telomerase is preferentially recruited to the shortest telomeres (Bianchi and Shore, 2008Bianchi A. Shore D.

Telomere length regulation in mice is linked to a novel chromosome locus.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998; 95: 8648-8653Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In these studies the data supporting this conclusion were obtained under conditions of changing telomere length, and it is unknown whether significant preference for the shortest telomeres exists when overall telomere length is being maintained. Six essential proteins form a complex called shelterin that binds telomeric DNA, and all are believed to play important roles in the recruitment and regulation of telomerase at the G strand (Bianchi and Shore, 2008Bianchi A. Shore D. How telomerase reaches its end: mechanism of telomerase regulation by the telomeric complex.Mol. Cell. 2008; 31: 153-165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, Palm and de Lange, 2008Palm W. de Lange T. How shelterin protects mammalian telomeres.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2008; 42: 301-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar). Several studies indicate that disruption of C-strand DNA synthesis can also impair telomere length control (Price, 1997Price C.M. Synthesis of the telomeric C-strand. A review.Biochemistry (Mosc.). 1997; 62: 1216-1223PubMed Google Scholar). In the ciliate Euplotes, inhibition of DNA polymerase α and β during de novo telomere synthesis alters telomeric C-strand length and also causes an increase in G-strand length (Fan and Price, 1997Fan X. Price C.M. Coordinate regulation of G- and C strand length during new telomere synthesis.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2145-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Similarly, propagation of S. cerevisiae strains defective for components of the lagging strand replication machinery causes a telomerase-dependent increase in telomere length (Adams and Holm, 1996Adams A.K. Holm C. Specific DNA replication mutations affect telomere length in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4614-4620Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, Adams Martin et al., 2000Adams Martin A. Dionne I. Wellinger R.J. Holm C. The function of DNA polymerase alpha at telomeric G tails is important for telomere homeostasis.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 786-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Mouse cells harboring a temperature-sensitive allele of DNA polymerase α undergo sequential G-rich overhang elongation (that is not dependent on telomerase) followed by a marked increase in overall telomere length (that is telomerase dependent) (Nakamura et al., 2005Nakamura M. Nabetani A. Mizuno T. Hanaoka F. Ishikawa F. Alterations of DNA and chromatin structures at telomeres and genetic instability in mouse cells defective in DNA polymerase alpha.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 11073-11088Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Following extension of the 3′ end of the G-rich strand by telomerase, fill-in synthesis of the complementary C strand completes replication of the double-stranded telomeric DNA. Increasing evidence shows that C-strand fill-in can be tightly regulated. In Euplotes, the newly synthesized G strands are heterogeneous in length with the majority 95–100 nucleotides long. In contrast, most C strands are exactly 84 nucleotides long, suggesting that the length of the C strand is the more precisely regulated step (Price et al., 1994Price C.M. Adams A.K. Vermeesch J.R. Accumulation of telomerase RNA and telomere protein transcripts during telomere synthesis in Euplotes.J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. 1994; 41: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). End-processing of the C strand is also more specific than that of the G strand. Up to 80% of the C-rich strands terminate in CCAATC-5′ in human cells, whereas the G-terminal nucleotide is less precise (Sfeir et al., 2005Sfeir A.J. Chai W. Shay J.W. Wright W.E. Telomere-end processing the terminal nucleotides of human chromosomes.Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 131-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae telomeres replicate late in S phase due to late firing of subtelomeric origins of DNA replication (McCarroll and Fangman, 1988McCarroll R.M. Fangman W.L. Time of replication of yeast centromeres and telomeres.Cell. 1988; 54: 505-513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Elongation of an artificially shortened telomere coincides with semiconservative telomere replication, which occurs very late in S phase (Marcand et al., 2000Marcand S. Brevet V. Mann C. Gilson E. Cell cycle restriction of telomere elongation.Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 487-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), suggesting coupling between the two processes. De novo addition of a telomere to a newly created double strand (ds) break adjacent to a telomere seeding sequence also suggests coupling between the replication machinery and telomerase. Using an inducible HO endonuclease to control the timing, Diede and Gottshling (Diede and Gottschling, 1999Diede S.J. Gottschling D.E. Telomerase-mediated telomere addition in vivo requires DNA primase and DNA polymerases alpha and delta.Cell. 1999; 99: 723-733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) showed that telomerase addition could not occur during G1 but that it could in M-phase-arrested cells. This allowed them to explore the role of essential DNA polymerase components after a normal S phase was completed. Telomere addition of even the G-rich strand was blocked in the absence of Pol α, Pol δ and DNA primase (Diede and Gottschling, 1999Diede S.J. Gottschling D.E. Telomerase-mediated telomere addition in vivo requires DNA primase and DNA polymerases alpha and delta.Cell. 1999; 99: 723-733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), reinforcing the concept that telomerase addition and C-strand fill-in are coupled to the replication complex. Human telomeres replicate throughout S phase (Ten Hagen et al., 1990Ten Hagen K.G. Gilbert D.M. Willard H.F. Cohen S.N. Replication timing of DNA sequences associated with human centromeres and telomeres.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6348-6355Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, Wright et al., 1999Wright W.E. Tesmer V.M. Liao M.L. Shay J.W. Normal human telomeres are not late replicating.Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 251: 492-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), providing the opportunity to distinguish whether telomerase extension/processing is a late S/G2/M process or is directly coupled to semiconservative replication. Recent in situ analysis indicates an S-phase-specific co-localization of telomerase with small numbers of telomeres at any one time (Jady et al., 2006Jady B.E. Richard P. Bertrand E. Kiss T. Cell cycle-dependent recruitment of telomerase RNA and Cajal bodies to human telomeres.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 944-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, Tomlinson et al., 2006Tomlinson R.L. Ziegler T.D. Supakorndej T. Terns R.M. Terns M.P. Cell cycle-regulated trafficking of human telomerase to telomeres.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 955-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), consistent with telomerase extension occurring during the heterogeneous replication of telomeres throughout S phase. However, direct proof that telomerase action is restricted to this part of the cell cycle is lacking. We developed several independent assays to monitor G-strand extension and C-strand fill-in. We demonstrate that telomere elongation by telomerase occurs within 30 min of telomere replication throughout S phase, and that 70%–100% of the ends in HeLa and H1299 cells are extended during each cell cycle. Telomerase is thus not preferentially recruited to the shortest telomeres under steady state conditions of telomere length maintenance. We also observed the unanticipated result that C-strand fill-in is delayed until late S phase. The demonstration that fill-in is uncoupled from telomerase extension defines a two-step model for telomere maintenance in cancer cells, implies an unexpected regulatory step in telomere extension, and provides a target for telomerase-inhibition therapies. Single Telomere Length Analysis (STELA) (Baird et al., 2003Baird D.M. Rowson J. Wynford-Thomas D. Kipling D. Extensive allelic variation and ultrashort telomeres in senescent human cells.Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) can determine the length of individual human telomeres, and thus their elongation by telomerase during a single cell cycle. For this purpose, the approximate timing of replication of the target telomere needs to be established, telomeres need to be short and uniform enough so that small changes can be detected, and telomeres need to be elongating so that a change in length can be detected. We first determined the timing of replication of the Xp/Yp telomere in human fibroblasts. ReDFISH (Bailey et al., 2004Bailey S.M. Goodwin E.H. Cornforth M.N.

USA. 2004; 101: 12928-12933Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A) produces a specific pattern of hybridization of telomeres that have replicated during a pulse of 5-bromodeoxyuridine/bromodoxycytidine (BrdU/BrdC). The removal of the BrdU/BrdC-containing strands allows hybridization of fluorescent C-rich and G-rich probes to only one of the two daughter chromatids at each end. The fractions of ends exhibiting this pattern are then determined by hourly pulses during S phase. 70% of the Xp/Yp telomeres replicate between 2-4 hr following release from a hydroxyurea block (Figure 1B). This timing, occurring relatively early, provided a good window for distinguishing events coupled to replication from those that occur late in S phase. Human fibroblasts have telomeres that are sufficiently long so that measuring small changes during a single S phase would be difficult. Therefore, a clone of A549 lung cancer cells was picked that had very short telomeres (∼3.5 kb). This clone was treated with the telomerase inhibitor GRN163L (Herbert et al., 2005Herbert B.S. Gellert G.C. Hochreiter A. Pongracz K. Wright W.E. Zielinska D. Chin A.C. Harley C.B. Shay J.W. Gryaznov S.M. Lipid modification of GRN163, an N3′–> P5′ thio-phosphoramidate oligonucleotide, enhances the potency of telomerase inhibition.Oncogene. 2005; 24: 5262-5268Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) in order to induce further telomere shortening. Finally, it was transduced with a retrovirus overexpressing the human TERT catalytic subunit in order to cause rapid enough telomere elongation to measure in a single cell cycle. Telomere length immediately following infection was 2.5 kb, which elongated at about 500 bp/division during the first few divisions (Figure 2A). Cells were synchronized at G1/S using aphidicolin immediately after selection for antibiotic resistance, and then samples were harvested every two hours for FACS (Figure 2B) and STELA (Figures 2C–2E). Approximately 100 individual telomeric bands were analyzed at each time point. The size of the Xp telomere increased by approximately 250 bp between 4 and 6 hr after release into S phase. FACS analysis indicated that ∼50% of the cells entered S phase following release (Figure 2B, time points 6 and 8 hr), so the measured rate of telomere elongation by STELA (∼250 nt) corresponds closely with the value predicted from telomere restriction fragment gels (∼500 bp ÷ 2) (Figure 2A). Comparison of the FACS profile of BJ fibroblasts synchronized with hydroxyurea and A549 cells synchronized with aphidicolin show similar rates of progression through S phase, so most of the Xp/Yp telomeres in A549 cells should have replicated by 4 hr after release (Figure 2B). ReDFISH analysis of A549 cells confirmed that most Xp/Yp replication had occurred by 4 hr after release (data not shown). However, STELA products only elongated after 6 hr (Figures 2D and 2E). This raised the possibility that telomerase action might be delayed following replication. However, the STELA procedure used above measures the size of the C-rich telomeric strand, and telomerase might have elongated the G-rich strand at an earlier time. The samples were thus re-analyzed using a modification in which a long C-rich oligonucleotide is first annealed to the telomeric overhangs (Sfeir et al., 2005Sfeir A.J. Chai W. Shay J.W. Wright W.E. Telomere-end processing the terminal nucleotides of human chromosomes.Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 131-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). This “platform” oligonucleotide creates a single-stranded C-rich overhang to which an appropriately modified G-telorette oligonucleotide can be annealed and ligated to the G strand (Figure 2F). Amplification then occurs based upon the length of the G rather than the C strand. G-strand STELA products exhibited an ∼250 nt elongation between 2 and 4 hr after release into S phase, consistent with the timing of replication of the Xp/Yp telomere (Figures 2G and 2H). This established that there is a significant delay between the time at which telomerase elongates the G strand (2–4 hr) and when the extended overhang is filled in (starting at 6 hr). Control experiments using asynchronously dividing cells showed only the expected∼100 nt difference between G- and C-strands due to the 3′overhangs (see Figure S1 available with this article online). A delay between the extension of the G strand by telomerase and the fill-in of the C strand on the Xp/Yp telomere predicts that overhang length on other telomeres should become longer during S phase than in either G1 or G2. Global overhang length was analyzed using DSN (duplex specific nuclease), which digests total double-stranded DNA to < 10 bp while leaving the single-stranded telomeric overhang intact (Zhao et al., 2008Zhao Y. Hoshiyama H. Shay J.W. Wright W.E. Quantitative telomeric overhang determination using a double-strand specific nuclease.Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: e14Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Because of the anticipated large size of these overhangs, the DNA was run on agarose rather than the polyacrylamide gels usually used for this analysis. Figure 3A shows that total overhangs become hundreds of nt longer during S phase, confirming the STELA results that very long G-overhangs accumulate on many different chromosome ends in these cells and that C-strand fill-in is delayed until the end of S phase. The A549 experiments used cells overexpressing telomerase, which might have altered normal replication and processing. We thus examined overhang length in synchronized HeLa cells expressing only endogenous telomerase. Because of their heterogeneity, the overhangs exhibit a wide distribution of sizes on polyacrylamide gels (Figure 3B). After adjusting the signal intensity for size (since longer overhangs hybridize to more probe), the average overhang size was compared at different times after release into S phase. Total overhang length increased from ∼65 nt to ∼105 nt by 6 hr after release, dropping back to 65 nt by 10 hr. The results from this DSN analysis were compared to that from native gel hybridization, in which the signal hybridizing to the overhang in double-stranded (native) telomeres is compared to the total telomere signal following denaturation. This only gives a relative value for the size of the overhang rather than a quantitative measure, but it confirmed the progressive elongation of the overhangs during S phase (Figure 3C). Repetitive analysis of logarithmically growing HeLa cells did not show a change in relative overhang length (see Figure S2). In order to increase the resolution for how quickly telomerase acted following replication, we looked at overhang lengths in telomeres labeled during a very short BrdU exposure. HeLa cells were released into S phase and then either continuously exposed to BrdU or pulsed for 30 min in mid-S and harvested immediately. DNA that had replicated during the 30 min pulse was separated from unreplicated and previously replicated DNA on CsCl gradients (Figure 3D). The increased amount of BrdU incorporated into the G-rich telomeric sequence allows the separation of daughter strands synthesized by leading and lagging strand synthesis (Chai et al., 2006Chai W. Du Q. Shay J.W. Wright W.E. Human telomeres have different overhang sizes at leading versus lagging strands.Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 427-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Figure 3E shows that the average size of both leading and lagging strand overhangs is elongated within 30 min of replication. Figure 3F quantitates the differences shown in 3E as a function of size, and shows that at 30 min twice as many overhangs are longer than 50 nt (60%–70% versus 30%) than at 8 hr for both leading and lagging daughter telomeres. S. cerevesia telomeres exhibit a transient increase in overhang length at the end of S phase (Wellinger et al., 1996Wellinger R.J. Ethier K. Labrecque P. Zakian V.A. Evidence for a new step in telomere maintenance.Cell. 1996; 85: 423-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, Wellinger et al., 1993Wellinger R.J. Wolf A.J. Zakian V.A. Saccharomyces telomeres acquire single-strand TG1–3 tails late in S phase.Cell. 1993; 72: 51-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Because this transient increase is also observed in the absence of telomerase, it is presumed to represent a resection of the C-rich strand. Although we did not observe a statistically significant decrease in C-strand STELA Xp/Yp products during the first four hours after release into S phase, the standard deviations are large and we do not believe we could have detected a 50 nt decrease in length. It thus remains formally possible that the increase in overhang length observed in Figure 3 is due to C-strand resection rather than telomerase elongation. In order to provide direct evidence for elongation by telomerase, we examined the BrdU content of lagging strand overhangs. The parental G strand provides the template for lagging strand synthesis, and following replication initially contains only thymidine in synchronized cells released into S phase in the presence of BrdU (Figure 4A). However, if telomerase acts it will incorporate BrdU into the newly synthesized GGTTAG repeats. If C-strand fill-in is delayed, these overhangs will then contain a mixture of thymidine and BrdU containing repeats and should have an intermediate density on CsCl gradients. Depending on the amount of elongation, C-strand fill-in might then convert the thymidine-containing portion of the overhang to ds DNA, leaving a fully BrdU substituted overhang. Since the G-rich strand is the newly synthesized strand during leading strand synthesis, its overhangs will be fully BrdU substituted regardless of whether or not telomerase has acted. Despite their small size and thus high rates of diffusion, we were able to separate thymidine containing and fully BrdU-substituted overhangs on CsCl gradients (Figure 4B). The signals were abolished by treatment with the 3′ to 5′ nuclease Exo I prior to DSN digestion, showing that the signals on slot blots used to analyze the gradient were not due to small undigested dsDNA (data not shown). Synchronized HeLa cells were released for 3 hr in the presence of BrdU. Total DNA was digested with DSN and the surviving single-stranded G-rich overhangs were separated on CsCl gradients. The intermediate density peak half-way between the thymidine and fully substituted overhangs directly demonstrates that telomerase elongation of the lagging overhangs had occurred (Figure 4C). This intermediate density peak was absent in similar experiments performed on normal human fibroblasts (telomerase-negative) and HeLa cells in which telomerase had been inhibited with the hTR-template antagonist GRN163L, demonstrating that it required active telomerase to be produced. Probing the slot blot with a G-rich probe to identify the presence of any C-strand DNA surviving the DSN digestion gave only background signals (Figure 4D), further confirming that the intermediate peak represented G-rich single-stranded overhangs. The time course of telomerase extension and C-strand fill-in was examined at different intervals after release from a G1/S block. Figure 5B shows that increasing amounts of intermediate density overhangs accumulated until 4–6 hr after release. By 8 hr, the intermediate density peak disappeared, and the relative intensity of the thymidine and BrdU overhang peaks matched the FACS profile of cells still in G1 versus those in late S/G2 (Figure 5A). The early appearance of intermediate density overhangs and their late conversion into fully substituted overhangs confirmed that telomerase action and C-strand fill-in are uncoupled, and extension products do not get filled-in until late S phase. The data in Figure 5B was obtained in the continuous presence of BrdU. In order to follow a single cohort of replicated telomeres, cells were pulsed with BrdU for the first 2.5 hr after release from a G1/S block and then chased for different times (Figure 5C). A distinct peak of intermediate density overhangs appeared during the first 2.5 hr pulse, which persisted at the 5 hr time point before disappearing in DNA isolated 8 hr after release (Figure 5D). Thus, even the telomeres that had replicated at the earliest time point had their overhangs extended by telomerase early, and delayed C-strand fill-in until late S. It is currently unknown whether telomerase maintains telomeres by adding small amounts to most of the telomeres during each cell division or by adding much more to a small fraction of the ends. The intensity of the intermediate density peak in Figure 4, Figure 5 suggested that a large fraction of the ends were being extended, and the intermediate density suggested that the amount added was approximately equal to the size of the newly replicated lagging daughter overhang. In order to directly determine the fraction of extended lagging ends, we labeled HeLa cells with BrdU for the first four hours following replication, and then purified lagging daughter telomeres on CsCl gradients (Figure 6A). These telomeres were then digested with DSN and their overhangs reanalyzed on a second CsCl gradient. Telomeres that had not been elongated by telomerase should contain only thymidine (Figure 4A). Most of the replicated telomeres exhibited overhangs with an intermediate density (Figure 6B), indicating that in HeLa cells telomerase is maintaining telomere length by elongating most of the ends during every cell division. Fitting the observed distribution to overlapping Gaussian distributions indicated that ∼18% of the signal was in the thymidine-only peak (Figure 6C). The position of the intermediate-density peak half-way between the thymidine only and fully BrdU substituted peaks implies that the telomerase-extended overhangs are twice as long and have roughly equal numbers of thymidine and BrdU-containing repeats. They will thus give twice the signal per overhang when probed. Normalizing the signals for this difference indicate"

BH4 levels are determined by the activity of GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH), the rate-limiting enzyme in de novo BH4 biosynthesis. However, BH4 levels may also be influenced by oxidation, forming 7,8-dihydrobiopterin (BH2), which promotes eNOS uncoupling. Conversely, dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) can regenerate BH4 from BH2, but the functional importance of DHFR in maintaining eNOS coupling remains unclear. We investigated the role of DHFR in regulating BH4 versus BH2 levels in endothelial cells and in cell lines expressing eNOS combined with tet-regulated GTPCH expression in order to compare the effects of low or high levels of de novo BH4 biosynthesis. Pharmacological inhibition of DHFR activity by methotrexate or genetic knockdown of DHFR protein by RNA interference reduced intracellular BH4 and increased BH2 levels resulting in enzymatic uncoupling of eNOS, as indicated by increased eNOS-dependent superoxide but reduced NO production. In contrast to the decreased BH4:BH2 ratio induced by DHFR knockdown, GTPCH knockdown greatly reduced total biopterin levels but with no change in BH4:BH2 ratio. In cells expressing eNOS with low biopterin levels, DHFR inhibition or knockdown further diminished the BH4:BH2 ratio and exacerbated eNOS uncoupling. Taken together, these data reveal a key role for DHFR in eNOS coupling by maintaining the BH4:BH2 ratio, particularly in conditions of low total biopterin availability.

In vascular disease states such as atherosclerosis and diabetes, endothelial nitric oxide (NO) bioactivity is reduced, and oxidative stress is increased, resulting in endothelial dysfunction. It has become apparent that enzymatic “coupling” of endothelial NO synthase by its cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) 2The abbreviations used are: BH4tetrahydrobiopterinBH27,8-dihydrobiopterinBbiopterinDHFRdihydrofolate reductaseNOSnitric-oxide synthaseeNOSendothelial NOSGTPCHguanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase Il-NAMENG-nitro-l-arginine methyl esterSODsuperoxide dismutasesiRNAsmall interfering RNAGFPgreen fluorescent proteineGFPenhanced GFPHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyMTXmethotrexate. 2The abbreviations used are: BH4tetrahydrobiopterinBH27,8-dihydrobiopterinBbiopterinDHFRdihydrofolate reductaseNOSnitric-oxide synthaseeNOSendothelial NOSGTPCHguanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase Il-NAMENG-nitro-l-arginine methyl esterSODsuperoxide dismutasesiRNAsmall interfering RNAGFPgreen fluorescent proteineGFPenhanced GFPHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyMTXmethotrexate. plays a key role in maintaining endothelial function. Indeed, the balance between NO and superoxide production by eNOS appears to be determined by the availability of BH4 versus the abundance of 7,8-dihydrobiopterin (BH2, that is inactive for NOS cofactor function and may compete with BH4 for NOS binding (1Vásquez-Vivar J. Kalyanaraman B. Martásek P. Hogg N. Masters B.S. Karoui H. Tordo P. Pritchard Jr., K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 9220-9225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar). Intracellular biopterin levels are regulated principally by the activity of the de novo biosynthetic pathway (Fig. 1). Guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH; EC 3.5.4.16) catalyzes the formation of dihydroneopterin triphosphate from GTP, and BH4 is generated by two further steps through 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase and sepiapterin reductase. GTPCH appears to be the rate-limiting enzyme in BH4 biosynthesis, and overexpression of GTPCH is sufficient to augment BH4 levels in cultured endothelial cells (2Chalupsky K. Cai H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 9056-9061Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy studies have shown that BH4 both stabilizes and donates electrons to the ferrous-dioxygen complex in the oxygenase domain, as the initiating step of l-arginine oxidation (3Hurshman A.R. Krebs C. Edmondson D.E. Huynh B.H. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15689-15696Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 4Schmidt P.P. Lange R. Gorren A.C. Werner E.R. Mayer B. Andersson K.K.

J. 2002; 362: 733-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In this reaction BH4 forms the protonated trihydrobiopterin cation radical, which is subsequently reduced by electron transfer from NOS flavins. When BH4 availability is limiting, electron transfer from NOS flavins becomes uncoupled from l-arginine oxidation, eNOS generates superoxide rather than NO, BH4 becomes oxidized to catalytically incompetent BH2, and a futile feed-forward cascade of BH4 destruction proceeds (1Vásquez-Vivar J. Kalyanaraman B. Martásek P. Hogg N. Masters B.S. Karoui H. Tordo P. Pritchard Jr., K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 9220-9225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar). Recent studies reveal that BH4 and BH2 bind eNOS with equal affinity and that BH2 can efficiently replace eNOS-bound BH4, resulting in eNOS uncoupling (6Crabtree M.J. Smith C.L. Lam G. Goligorsky M.S. Gross S.S. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2008; 294: H1530-H1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Indeed, we have previously shown that the relative abundance of eNOS versus BH4 together with the intracellular BH4:BH2 ratio, rather than absolute concentrations of BH4, are the key determinants of eNOS uncoupling (7Crabtree M.J. Tatham A.L. Al-Wakeel Y. Warrick N. Hale A.B. Cai S. Channon K.M. Alp N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 1136-1144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), a hypothesis supported by a recent publication where BH2 levels are elevated after exposure of bovine aortic endothelial cells to DHFR-specific siRNA (8Sugiyama T. Levy B.D. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 12691-12700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Thus, mechanisms that regulate the BH4:BH2 ratio independently of overall biopterin levels may play an equally important role in regulating eNOS coupling as the well established role of GTCPH, which regulates de novo BH4 biosynthesis. In addition to key roles in folate metabolism, dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR; EC 1.5.1.3) can reduce BH2, thus regenerating BH4 (9McGuire J.J. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2003; 9: 2593-2613Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 10Nzila A. Ward S.A. Marsh K. Sims P.F. Hyde J.E. Trends Parasitol. 2005; 21: 292-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). It is, therefore, likely that net BH4 bioavailability within the endothelium reflects the balance between de novo BH4 synthesis, loss of BH4 by oxidation to BH2, and the regeneration of BH4 by DHFR. In human liver extracts DHFR has been shown to reduce BH2 back to BH4 as part of the salvage pathway for biopterin synthesis (11Curtius H.C. Heintel D. Ghisla S. Kuster T. Leimbacher W. Niederwieser A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 148: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, the role of this pathway and the extent to which it regulates intracellular BH4 levels in vivo remains unknown. Recent work by Chalupsky and Cai (2Chalupsky K. Cai H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 9056-9061Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) investigated the functionality of endothelial DHFR in cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells. Exposure to angiotensin II down-regulated DHFR expression, decreased BH4 levels, and increased eNOS uncoupling, which was restored by overexpression of DHFR (2Chalupsky K. Cai H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 9056-9061Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). A recent study also suggests that perturbation of BH4 metabolism differentially affects eNOS phosphorylation sites. Knockdown of DHFR by siRNA inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor-induced dephosphorylation of eNOS at Ser-116, an effect that is completely recovered by the addition of exogenous BH4 (8Sugiyama T. Levy B.D. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 12691-12700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, the requirement for DHFR in regulating intracellular BH4 homeostasis and the quantitative relationships that relate BH4 de novo synthesis versus BH4 recycling to eNOS coupling remain uncertain. Accordingly, we sought to address these questions using both pharmacologic and genetic manipulation of DHFR activity and related these interventions to effects on eNOS coupling. We manipulated DHFR in both endothelial cells and in novel cell lines that stably express an eNOS-GFP fusion protein and where expression of human GTPCH can be regulated by doxycycline in order to test the effects of variations in intracellular BH4 biosynthesis (7Crabtree M.J.

We report that although GTPCH is the key regulator of the total amount of intracellular biopterins, DHFR is critical to eNOS function by determining BH4:BH2 ratio and, thus, in maintaining eNOS coupling. In particular, DHFR is important in preventing “self-propagated” eNOS uncoupling in conditions of low total biopterin levels, when eNOS-dependent oxidation of BH4 that would further exacerbate eNOS uncoupling can be rescued by DHFR. tetrahydrobiopterin 7,8-dihydrobiopterin biopterin dihydrofolate reductase nitric-oxide synthase endothelial NOS guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase I NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester superoxide dismutase small interfering RNA green fluorescent protein enhanced GFP high performance liquid chromatography methotrexate. tetrahydrobiopterin 7,8-dihydrobiopterin biopterin dihydrofolate reductase nitric-oxide synthase endothelial NOS guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase I NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester superoxide dismutase small interfering RNA green fluorescent protein enhanced GFP high performance liquid chromatography methotrexate. We used NIH 3T3 murine fibroblasts stably transfected with a tet-off transactivator construct as previously described (7Crabtree M.J. Tatham A.L. Al-Wakeel Y. Warrick N. Hale A.B. Cai S. Channon K.M. Alp N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 1136-1144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In the presence of doxycycline, binding of the transactivator is blocked, and gene expression is prevented. These 3T3-tet-off cells, previously shown to express neither eNOS nor GTPCH (12Tzeng E. Billiar T.R. Robbins P.D. Loftus M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 11771-11775Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and also confirmed to be devoid of eNOS protein, were stably transfected with a plasmid encoding hemagglutinin antigen-tagged human GTPCH under the control of a tetracycline-responsive element. Individual colonies were isolated and analyzed for GTPCH expression, and a cell line termed “GCH cells” was established from expansion of a single colony. GCH/eNOS cells were produced by stable transfection of GCH cells with a plasmid encoding a human eNOS-eGFP fusion protein as described (13McDonald D.M. Alp N.J. Channon K.M. Pharmacogenetics. 2004; 14: 831-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). All cell lines underwent at least three rounds of clonal selection. sEnd.1 murine endothelial cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml). Additionally, GCH cells were maintained using media containing the antibiotics hygromycin (200 μg/ml) and Geneticin (200 μg/ml), whereas eNOS/eGFP cell media also included puromycin (2 μg/ml). Where appropriate, doxycycline (1 μg/ml) was added to cell culture media to abolish transcription of GCH1 mRNA. BH4, BH2, and biopterin (B) levels in cell lysates were determined by HPLC followed by electrochemical and fluorescent detection, as previously described (14Heales S. Hyland K. J. Chromatogr. 1989; 494: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown to confluence and harvested by trypsinization. Cell pellets were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (50 mm), pH 7.4, containing dithioerythritol (1 mm) and EDTA (100 μm) and subjected to three free-thaw cycles. After centrifugation (15 min at 13,000 rpm and 4 °C), samples were transferred to new, cooled micro tubes and precipitated with cold phosphoric acid (1 m), trichloroacetic acid (2 m) and dithioerythritol (1 mm). Samples were vigorously mixed and then centrifuged for 15 min at 13,000 rpm and 4 °C. Samples were injected onto an isocratic HPLC system and quantified using sequential electrochemical (Coulochem III, ESA, Inc.) and fluorescence (Jasco) detection. HPLC separation was performed using a 250-mm ACE C-18 column (Hichrom) and a mobile phase comprised of sodium acetate (50 mm), citric acid (5 mm), EDTA (48 μm), and dithioerythritol (160 μm) (pH 5.2) (all ultrapure electrochemical HPLC grade) at a flow rate of 1.3 ml/min. Background currents of +500 μA and −50 μA were used for the detection of BH4 on electrochemical cells E1 and E2, respectively. 7,8-BH2 and biopterin were measured using a Jasco FP2020 fluorescence detector. Quantification of BH4, BH2, and B was done by comparison with authentic external standards and normalized to sample protein content. Cells were suspended in radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton, 0.1% SDS, 0.1 sodium deoxycholate, pH 7.4) including a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), and subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles in liquid nitrogen. Western blotting was carried out using standard techniques and anti-eNOS (BD Transduction Laboratories), anti-hemagglutinin, anti-DHFR, anti-SOD, and anti-GAPDH antibodies. The rabbit anti-rat GTPCH antibody was kindly provided by Prof. Steven S. Gross of Weill Medical College of Cornell University. Rabbit anti-human GTPCH was kindly provided by Gabriele Werner-Felmayer of the Institute for Medical Chemistry and Biochemistry, Innsbruck, Austria. Cell pellets were lysed in phosphate-buffered saline containing dithioerythritol (1 mm) and EDTA (100 μm) as for BH4 analysis. Sample fluorescence was quantified using a TEKAN fluorescence plate reader and a standard curve generated using recombinant eGFP. Because recombinant eNOS was expressed as an eNOS-eGFP fusion protein, eGFP fluorescence and eNOS levels were directly proportional. Importantly, determination of both eGFP fluorescence and BH4 levels was done on identical cell samples, allowing accurate determination of the BH4:eNOS ratio. Measurement of 2-hydroxyethidium formation by HPLC was used to quantify superoxide production by methods adapted from those previously described (15Zhao H. Joseph J. Fales H.M. Sokoloski E.A.

Cells were washed 3 times in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in Krebs-Hepes buffer in the presence or absence of l-NAME (100 μm). After 1 h, dihydroethidium (25 μm) was added, and cells were then incubated for an additional 20 min at 37 °C. Cells were then harvested by scraping, centrifuged, and lysed in ice-cold methanol. Hydrochloric acid (100 mm) was added (1:1 v/v) before loading into the autosampler for analysis. All samples were stored in darkened tubes and protected from light at all times. Separation of dihydroethidium, 2-hydroxyethidium, and ethidium was performed using a gradient HPLC system (Jasco) with an ODS3 reverse phase column (250 mm, 4.5 mm; Hichrom) and quantified using a fluorescence detector set at 510 nm (excitation) and 595 nm (emission). A linear gradient was applied from mobile phase A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) to mobile phase B (0.085% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile) over 23 min (30% to 50% acetonitrile). Cellular NO synthesis by eNOS was assessed by measuring the conversion of l-[14C]arginine to citrulline with HPLC detection in the presence and absence of l-NMMA, as previously described (17de Bono J.P. Warrick N. Bendall J.K. Channon K.M. Alp N.J. Nitric Oxide. 2007; 16: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). DHFR- and GCH-specific “ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool” siRNA was purchased from Dharmacon Thermo Scientific. The siRNAs were used as a pool of four specific siRNA duplexes with the following sequences: GCH duplex 1, GGUAGAAUGCUAAGUACGU; GCH duplex 2, CGAGAAGUGUGGCUACGUA; GCH duplex 3, GAGAAGGGAGAAUCGCUUU; GCH duplex 4, AGUAGUGAUUGAAGCGACA; DHFR duplex 1, AGUUUGAAGUCUACGAGAA; DHFR duplex 2, AGAAAGCACAGUUGGGAUA; DHFR duplex 3, GCCUGUAGGUUGUCUAAUA; DHFR duplex 4,- GCAAGUAAAUGUGUUGUAA. sEnd.1 endothelial cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml). 24 h before transfection, cells were seeded into 6-well plates. Cells were then transfected with GCH- or DHFR-specific siRNA (100 nm), and GAPDH-positive (100 nm) or nonspecific pooled duplex negative control siRNA (100 nm). Cells were cultured for 72 h, and gene silencing was detected by analysis of DHFR and GTPCH protein expression by Western blotting using DHFR and GTPCH-specific antibodies. Cellular antioxidant status was assessed using an antioxidant detection kit that quantifies the combined antioxidant capacity of aqueous and lipid-soluble antioxidant including vitamins, proteins, lipids, glutathione, uric acid. Cells were harvested into assay buffer (50 mm phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing dithioerythritol (1 mm) and EDTA (100 μm) and subjected to three free-thaw cycles). Protocol was then followed as per the manufacturer's instructions. Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. Data were subjected to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to determine distribution. Groups were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test for non-parametric data or Student's t test for parametric data. When comparing multiple groups data were analyzed by analysis of variance with the Newman-Keuls post-test for parametric data or Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunns post-test for non-parametric data. Correlation testing was performed using the Pearson test. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. We first investigated the effect of DHFR overexpression on biopterin levels and eNOS regulation in sEnd.1 murine endothelial cells. DHFR protein was increased 5-fold after transfection of sEnd.1 endothelial cells with DHFR cDNA, compared with untreated, GFP, or mock transfection controls (Fig. 2A). However, DHFR overexpression did not change the intracellular levels of either BH4 or total biopterins (Fig. 2, B and C). Similarly, neither endothelial-derived NO nor superoxide production was altered by DHFR overexpression, as evidenced by conversion of radiolabeled arginine to citrulline and by 2-hydroxyethidium accumulation, respectively (Fig. 2, D and E). These observations suggest that sEnd.1 endothelial cells contain sufficient DHFR to regulate steady-state BH4 levels and efficiently couple eNOS such that overexpression of DHFR has no further effects. We next sought to evaluate the effects of DHFR inhibition using MTX on steady-state biopterin levels to determine the requirement of DHFR for maintenance of BH4 homeostasis and eNOS coupling. We compared BH4, BH2, and biopterin levels in sEnd.1 endothelial cells after exposure to MTX (1 μm) for 16 h. Western blot analysis revealed that MTX did not alter protein levels of eNOS, DHFR, GCH, or GAPDH (Fig. 3A). However, intracellular BH4 levels were significantly decreased by exposure to MTX (from 308.0 ± 40.5 to 229.0 ± 36.3 pmol/mg protein) (Fig. 3B, p < 0.05), whereas the levels of BH2 and B were markedly elevated (Fig. 3, C and D, p < 0.001). Total biopterin levels (BH4 + BH2 + B) were unaltered by MTX, but there was a striking decrease in the ratio of reduced to oxidized biopterins (BH4:BH2 and B) (13.8 ± 2.3 versus 3.3 ± 0.2; Fig. 3, E and F, p < 0.001). Furthermore, MTX induced eNOS uncoupling, demonstrated by the simultaneous decrease in NO synthesis (p < 0.05; Fig. 4A) and elevation in eNOS-dependent superoxide production (p < 0.01; Fig. 4, B and C). Additional effects of MTX treatment on SOD protein levels and general cellular antioxidant capacity may explain changes in 2-hydroxyethidium accumulation observed in the presence of MTX. To eliminate these potentially confounding effects, we quantified CuZn-, Mn-, and endothelial cell SOD protein levels using Western blotting. No effect of MTX was observed on SOD levels (supplemental Fig. 1). However, a significant reduction in cellular antioxidant capacity was detected after incubation of sEnd.1 endothelial cells, GCH, and GCH/eNOS cells with MTX (*, p < 0.05, supplemental Fig. 2). No confounding effects of DHFR inhibition on cell growth and viability were observed (data not shown).FIGURE 4Inhibition of endogenous DHFR activity by MTX:nitric oxide and superoxide production. A23187-induced conversion of arginine to citrulline was used as a measure of eNOS activity. A, eNOS activity (as indicated by the inhibition of citrulline accumulation by N-methyl arginine; NMA) was attenuated in the presence of MTX in sEnd.1 cells (*, p < 0.05). B, after exposure to MTX (1 μm) for 16 h, cells were exposed to dihydroethidium (25 μm) for 20 min, and accumulation of 2-hydroxyethidium was measured by HPLC with fluorescence detection. MTX exposure markedly elevated cellular superoxide production (**, p < 0.01), which was significantly inhibited after pretreatment of cells with the NOS inhibitor, l-NAME (C) (100 μm; *, p < 0.05). n = 6 for each experiment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next investigated the effects of reduced DHFR expression by siRNA rather than pharmacologic DHFR inhibition and sought to compare with the effects of reduced GTPCH expression to determine the functional relationships between BH4 biosynthesis and BH4 recycling for eNOS coupling. After exposure of sEnd.1 endothelial cells to DHFR- or GTPCH-targeted siRNA for 72 h, DHFR or GTCPH protein was reduced by ∼95 or 90%, respectively. No nonspecific effects of control GAPDH-targeted siRNA, non-targeted scrambled control siRNA, or transfection reagent alone (mock) were observed by Western blotting (Fig. 5A). Cells treated with DHFR, GTPCH, and control siRNA were simultaneously prepared for biopterin analysis. As observed with DHFR inhibition using MTX, knockdown of DHFR resulted in a 40% decrease in intracellular BH4 (Fig. 5B) and a 2-fold elevation in BH2 levels (Fig. 5C), whereas total biopterins remained unchanged (Fig. 5D). In contrast, knockdown of GTPCH reduced BH4 and BH2 as well as total biopterin levels by >90%. Consequently, a striking reduction in the BH4:BH2 ratio was observed in the presence of DHFR knockdown but not GTPCH knockdown (4.8 ± 1.5 to 1.9 ± 0.8) (p < 0.05, Fig. 5E). eNOS uncoupling, evidenced by increased total and eNOS-dependent superoxide (p < 0.05, Fig. 5, G and H), as well as a reduced conversion of arginine to citrulline was significantly increased in the presence of both DHFR- and GCH-specific siRNAs (Fig. 5F). When combined, GTPCH- and DHFR-specific knockdown resulted in markedly more eNOS-derived superoxide (**, p < 0.05) and a diminished BH4:BH2 ratio (†, p < 0.05) when compared with either GTPCH or DHFR knockdown alone (Fig. 5). These data suggest that either major reductions in de novo BH4 biosynthesis or an altered BH4:BH2 ratio through reduced BH4 recycling is sufficient to induce eNOS uncoupling. Furthermore, the exacerbation of both BH4:BH2 ratio and eNOS-dependent superoxide production by DHFR knockdown at low levels of total biopterin infers that DHFR activity is more significant at low, compared with high or saturating levels of BH4. We investigated the effects of DHFR inhibition using MTX in cells expressing hemagglutinin antigen-tagged human GTPCH under the control of a tetracycline-responsive element (GCH cells) (7Crabtree M.J. Tatham A.L. Al-Wakeel Y. Warrick N. Hale A.B. Cai S. Channon K.M. Alp N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 1136-1144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Titrating doxycycline concentration between 0.01 and 1 ng/ml to manipulate GTPCH expression, and therefore de novo BH4 synthesis, resulted in the expected concentration-dependent reduction in steady-state intracellular BH4 levels. However, co-incubation with MTX significantly reduced BH4 levels across the whole range of GTPCH expression while markedly elevating intracellular BH2 levels (p < 0.05; Fig. 6). Importantly, the relative magnitude of the effect of DHFR inhibition by MTX was significantly greater at low absolute biopterin levels (Fig. 6). Intracellular BH4 levels were reduced by 25% at 0.01 ng/ml doxycycline (i.e. high GTCPH and high total biopterins) versus 47% reduction at 1 ng/ml doxycycline (i.e. low GTPCH and low total biopterins). We reasoned that the potential importance of DHFR in BH4 recycling under low total biopterin conditions might be critical in eNOS uncoupling, where eNOS-dependent ROS production can itself lead to BH4 oxidation. To test this hypothesis, we compared the effects of DHFR inhibition by MTX in GCH cells versus GCH cells stably expressing an eNOS-GFP fusion protein (GCH/eNOS cells) at different levels of GTPCH expression as determined by doxycycline. We confirmed by Western blotting that eNOS protein was abundant in GCH/eNOS cells but not GCH cells and that transgenic GTPCH protein was present equally in both GCH and GCH/eNOS cells but was undetectable after incubation with doxycycline for 7 days. Importantly, neither eNOS nor DHFR protein levels were altered by doxycycline or MTX exposure (Fig. 7A). Incubation of both GCH and GCH/eNOS cells with doxycycline, MTX, or both in combination resulted in a marked suppression of intracellular BH4 levels (*, p < 0.05). However, BH4 levels in GCH/eNOS cells were significantly lower than those in GCH cells after doxycycline exposure, associated with increased accumulation of BH2 (Fig. 7, B and C). BH2 accumulation in GCH/eNOS cells was significantly higher in the presence of both MTX and DOX when compared with DOX alone (Fig. 7C; †, p < 0.05). The BH4:BH2 ratio, a key determinant of eNOS coupling, was not altered in GCH cells after doxycycline treatment in either the presence or absence of MTX. However, a striking doxycycline-induced decrease in the ratio of BH4:BH2 was observed in GCH/eNOS cells, which was further exacerbated in the presence of MTX (Fig. 7D). Similarly, the eNOS:BH4 ratio, determined by fluorescent quantification of eNOS-GFP fusion protein in cell lysates, was reduced by MTX (21.2 ± 4.6 to 13.0 ± 0.9) and by doxycycline (21.2 ± 4.6 to 0.9 ± 0.6) (Table 1). Both GCH and GCH/eNOS cells showed a MTX-induced accumulation of 2-hydroxyethidium, indicative of superoxide production (Fig. 8, A and B). However, superoxide production was only inhibitable with l-NAME, indicating superoxide production from uncoupled eNOS in GCH/eNOS cells but not in GCH cells (Fig. 8, C and D). Taken together, these data support evidence from our experiments using RNA interference and suggest that DHFR is required to maintain eNOS coupling, in particular under conditions of low biopterin synthesis.TABLE 1Molar ratios of eNOS and BH4 in GCH/eNOS cells exposed to doxycycline and MTXDOXMTXeNOS/BH4BH4/eNOS−−0.05 ± 0.0121.2 ± 4.63+−1.57 ±"
https://openalex.org/W1990050585,"In homeostasis of adult vertebrate tissues, stem cells are thought to self-renew by infrequent and asymmetric divisions that generate another stem cell daughter and a progenitor daughter cell committed to differentiate. This model is based largely on in vivo invertebrate or in vitro mammal studies. Here, we examine the dynamic behavior of adult hair follicle stem cells in their normal setting by employing mice with repressible H2B-GFP expression to track cell divisions and Cre-inducible mice to perform long-term single-cell lineage tracing. We provide direct evidence for the infrequent stem cell division model in intact tissue. Moreover, we find that differentiation of progenitor cells occurs at different times and tissue locations than self-renewal of stem cells. Distinct fates of differentiation or self-renewal are assigned to individual cells in a temporal-spatial manner. We propose that large clusters of tissue stem cells behave as populations whose maintenance involves unidirectional daughter-cell-fate decisions."
https://openalex.org/W2035415099,"Protein phosphorylation, while critical to cellular behavior, has been undercharacterized in pluripotent cells. Therefore, we performed phosphoproteomic analyses of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and their differentiated derivatives. A total of 2546 phosphorylation sites were identified on 1602 phosphoproteins; 389 proteins contained more phosphorylation site identifications in undifferentiated hESCs, whereas 540 contained more such identifications in differentiated derivatives. Phosphoproteins in receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling pathways were numerous in undifferentiated hESCs. Cellular assays corroborated this observation by showing that multiple RTKs cooperatively supported undifferentiated hESCs. In addition to bFGF, EGFR, VEGFR, and PDGFR activation was critical to the undifferentiated state of hESCs. PDGF-AA complemented a subthreshold bFGF concentration to maintain undifferentiated hESCs. Also consistent with phosphoproteomics, JNK activity participated in maintenance of undifferentiated hESCs. These results support the utility of phosphoproteomic data, provide guidance for investigating protein function in hESCs, and complement transcriptomics/epigenetics for broadening our understanding of hESC fate determination."
https://openalex.org/W2000440473,"Background Gonadal fate in many reptiles, fish, and amphibians is modulated by the temperature experienced during a critical period early in life (temperature-dependent sex determination; TSD). Several molecular processes involved in TSD have been described but how the animals “sense” environmental temperature remains unknown. We examined whether the stress-related hormone cortisol mediates between temperature and sex differentiation of pejerrey, a gonochoristic teleost fish with marked TSD, and the possibility that it involves glucocorticoid receptor- and/or steroid biosynthesis-modulation. Methodology/Principal Findings Larvae maintained during the period of gonadal sex differentiation at a masculinizing temperature (29°C; 100% males) consistently had higher cortisol, 11-ketotestoterone (11-KT), and testosterone (T) titres than those at a feminizing temperature (17°C; 100% females). Cortisol-treated animals had elevated 11-KT and T, and showed a typical molecular signature of masculinization including amh upregulation, cyp19a1a downregulation, and higher incidence of gonadal apoptosis during sex differentiation. Administration of cortisol and a non-metabolizable glucocorticoid receptor (GR) agonist (Dexamethasone) to larvae at a “sexually neutral” temperature (24°C) caused significant increases in the proportion of males. Conclusions/Significance Our results suggest a role of cortisol in the masculinization of pejerrey and provide a possible link between stress and testicular differentiation in this gonochoristic TSD species. Cortisol role or roles during TSD of pejerrey seem(s) to involve both androgen biosynthesis- and GR-mediated processes. These findings and recent reports of cortisol effects on sex determination of sequential hermaphroditic fishes, TSD reptiles, and birds provide support to the notion that stress responses might be involved in various forms of environmental sex determination."
https://openalex.org/W2160284078,"SH2 domain-mediated interactions represent a crucial step in transmembrane signaling by receptor tyrosine kinases. SH2 domains recognize phosphotyrosine (pY) in the context of particular sequence motifs in receptor phosphorylation sites. However, the modest binding affinity of SH2 domains to pY containing peptides may not account for and likely represents an oversimplified mechanism for regulation of selectivity of signaling pathways in living cells. Here we describe the crystal structure of the activated tyrosine kinase domain of FGFR1 in complex with a phospholipase Cγ fragment. The structural and biochemical data and experiments with cultured cells show that the selectivity of phospholipase Cγ binding and signaling via activated FGFR1 are determined by interactions between a secondary binding site on an SH2 domain and a region in FGFR1 kinase domain in a phosphorylation independent manner. These experiments reveal a mechanism for how SH2 domain selectivity is regulated in vivo to mediate a specific cellular process."
https://openalex.org/W2039217252,"Research on microbe-host interactions focuses principally on pathogens, yet our immune system must deal with the huge number of beneficial commensal bacteria in our gut. It is becoming clear that the host immune system must reach a delicate balance between destroying dangerous bacterial pathogens while preserving the beneficial gut microbiota. Research on microbe-host interactions focuses principally on pathogens, yet our immune system must deal with the huge number of beneficial commensal bacteria in our gut. It is becoming clear that the host immune system must reach a delicate balance between destroying dangerous bacterial pathogens while preserving the beneficial gut microbiota. We can ignore the astronomical number of microorganisms that populate our gut, skin, and other mucosal surfaces, yet our immune system cannot. In the mammalian gut, there is an increasing gradient from jejunum to ileum to rectum of resident microorganisms that peaks in the colon at a concentration of 1010 per gram of stool. This vast complex community comprises 1000 or more different bacterial species and has a metabolic capacity comparable to that of the liver (Frank and Pace, 2008Frank D.N. Pace N.R. Curr. Opin. Gastroenterol. 2008; 24: 4-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Most of the gut microbiota is composed of obligate anaerobic bacteria that cannot be grown in culture. The majority are harmless commensals that benefit from the nutrient-rich environment offered by the host. Some are symbionts that also provide a benefit to the host, thereby establishing a condition of mutualism. Here, we will use the term commensal in a broad sense, regardless of whether the bacteria are also symbionts. Most of the gut microbiota belong to the Firmicutes (Gram-positive anaerobes) and Bacteroidetes (Gram-negative anaerobes), with far fewer belonging to the oxygen-adapted Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria. The resident gut microbiota can provide two major benefits to the host: release of nutrients from food and formation of a barrier against pathogens (Sansonetti, 2004Sansonetti P.J. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 953-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). The gut microbiota exerts a right of “first occupancy” precluding other microorganisms, particularly pathogens, from invading the occupied niche. It also strengthens the gut epithelial barrier, both mechanically and immunologically. The nutritional input of the gut microbiota is indispensible for the host enabling the synthesis of certain vitamins, hydrolysis of complex plant sugars, and production of short-chain fatty acids for direct assimilation by the host. Although colonization of the gut and other tissues by commensal bacteria is common to all metazoans, its extent increased during evolution particularly in vertebrates, due to the emergence of new organs that could be colonized (Ley et al., 2008Ley R.E. Hamady M. Lozupone C. Turnbaugh P.J. Ramey R.R. Bircher J.S. Schlegel M.L. Tucker T.A. Schrenzel M.D. Knight R. Gordon J.I. Science. 2008; 320: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (2398) Google Scholar). With this increase in colonization, metazoans became dependent on an increasingly elaborate relationship with their gut flora. The coevolution of hosts and their commensal microbiota had a particularly strong impact on the immune system, which had to develop the ability to discriminate between the continuously resident microbiota, with which it actively maintains a homeostatic balance, and the invasive pathogens, to which it must respond. Here, we will explore the elusive barrier that separates these two types of host-microbial interactions and the possible mechanisms and consequences for the failure to maintain this delicate balance. Tolerance of the host immune system toward gut commensals is mediated by three key players: the microbes themselves, the gut epithelium, and the immune cells that reside in lymphoid tissue in the lamina propria of the gut wall (Figure 1). Induction of immune tolerance and maintenance of the homeostatic balance reflects a series of strategies: avoidance of immune recognition by commensals, active suppression of the host response by commensals, and regulation of the immune response by the host when recognition of commensals does occur. If a group of commensals is able to avoid immune recognition, active suppression of the host response may not be necessary. Likewise, if active suppression of the immune response is established by certain commensals, regulation of the immune response by the host may not be as critical. To avoid immune recognition, commensal microorganisms must fail to express key virulence factors. One issue that needs more study is the degree of diversity in pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) in commensals compared to pathogens. PAMPs, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and peptidoglycans, are the structural elements of prokaryotes to which immune cells respond. For example, lipid A, the endotoxin moiety of LPS in Gram-negative bacteria, is pentacylated in the Bacteroidetes species that dominate the gut microbiota. This modification makes the lipid A of Bacteroidetes a poor agonist for Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), the receptor expressed by immune cells that is activated by LPS (Coats et al., 2007Coats S.R. Do C.T. Karimi-Naser L.M. Braham P.H. Darveau R.P. Cell. Microbiol. 2007; 9: 1191-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Conversely, the lipid A of commensal Proteobacteria is hexacylated, making it strongly endotoxic and more likely to elicit an immune response (Munford and Varley, 2006Munford R.S. Varley A.W. PLoS Pathog. 2006; 2: e67https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.0020067Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The effect of Proteobacteria lipid A as a potent agonist for TLR4 is diluted out in the gut because of the predominance of Bacteroidetes species. However, during inflammation associated with inflammatory bowel disease or intestinal infection, there is a decrease in Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes species and an increase in Proteobacteria, which are more resistant to inflammatory mediators (Lupp et al., 2007Lupp C. Robertson M.L. Wickham M.E. Sekirov I. Champion O.L. Gaynor E.C. Finlay B.B. Cell Host Microbe. 2007; 2: 119-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). This may result in an exacerbation of intestinal inflammation. Thus, homeostasis is highly dependent on maintaining the balance between strictly anaerobic and aero-tolerant microbes and their relative expression of immunostimulatory PAMPs. Maintenance of immune homeostasis toward commensal microorganisms is not mediated exclusively by tolerance. Increasing evidence indicates that some commensal bacteria have the capacity to actively suppress inflammation, particularly by targeting NF-κB, a key mediator of the inflammatory response. Some bacteria, such as nonpathogenic Salmonella, block the ubiquitination of IκBα catalyzed by the E3-SCF (βTrCP) ubiquitin ligase by neddylating cullin-1. This prevents degradation of IκBα, which keeps NF-κB in its inactive state and prevents transcription of NF-κB target genes including those encoding proinflammatory factors (Collier-Hyams et al., 2005Collier-Hyams L.S. Sloane V. Batten B.C. Neish A.S. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 4194-4198PubMed Google Scholar). The bacterium Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron targets the NF-κB subunit RelA, enhancing its export from the nucleus through a mechanism that is independent of the nuclear export receptor Crm-1 but dependent on formation of a complex with PPARγ. This prevents transcription of the proinflammatory genes activated by NF-κB (Kelly et al., 2003Kelly D. Campbell J.I. King T.P. Grant G. Jansson E.A. Coutts A.G. Pettersson S. Conway S. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 5: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, Lactobacillus casei induces transcriptional downregulation of Roc-1 (a subunit of E3-SCF) and of several components of the proteasome complex, thereby protecting IκB from degradation (Tien et al., 2006Tien M.T. Girardin S.E. Regnault B. Le Bourhis L. Dillies M.A. Coppée J.Y. Bourdet-Sicard R. Sansonetti P.J. Pédron T. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 1228-1237PubMed Google Scholar). The challenge now is to identify the effectors of commensal microorganisms that mediate the blockade of NF-κB activity. One clue comes from the study of a mouse model of colitis (Mazmanian et al., 2008Mazmanian S.K. Round J.L. Kasper D.L. Nature. 2008; 453: 620-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1696) Google Scholar). This study shows that the exopolysaccharide of a gut bacterial species Bacteroides fragilis exerts a strong protective anti-inflammatory action against the induction of colitis by the pathogen Helicobacter hepaticus. It induces the protective effect by regulating production of the cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) by immune cells of the gut. A systematic analysis of the characteristics of a limited number of gut microorganisms is needed to obtain a “commensal signature,” as has been done for gut pathogens. Particularly important questions to ask are, what are the effector molecules that enable commensals to occupy a niche and stay there, and what are the factors and mechanisms that alter the host immune response? The intestinal epithelium is a critical barrier to invasion by pathogenic microbes. It is on the frontline of sensing microbes in the gut and participates in the innate immune response as a bona fide component of the host immune system. The gut epithelium had to evolve under the double constraints of sensing microbes and adjusting the immune response to the perceived degree of threat. The result has been either constitutive “physiological inflammation” that balances the constant presence of the resident gut microbiota or induced “pathological inflammation,” the degree of which depends on the number and virulence of the invading pathogens. Physiological inflammation can be viewed as a basal sensing-responding loop that maintains a dynamic yet fragile homeostatic balance. The epithelium secretes factors such as mucins that establish a protective film of variable thickness and density, with the layer closest to the epithelial surface forming a dense lattice in which secreted antimicrobial molecules remain embedded (Liévin-Le Moal and Servin, 2006Liévin-Le Moal V. Servin A.L. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2006; 19: 315-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). In general, commensal bacteria seem to grow at a respectable distance from this zone establishing a sort of “bacterial no man's land.” This notion has been nicely confirmed with the demonstration that the densely packed inner mucin layer that is immediately adjacent to the epithelial surface is devoid of bacteria in the mouse colon (Johansson et al., 2008Johansson M.E. Phillipson M. Petersson J. Holm L. Hansson G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 15064-15069Crossref PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar). At the lumenal edge of the peripheral zone of the mucus layer, bacteria seem to establish complex communities often referred to as biofilms (Swidsinski et al., 2005Swidsinski A. Loening-Baucke V. Lochs H. Hale L.P. World J. Gastroenterol. 2005; 11: 1131-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Distance does not mean ignorance, however. TLRs are expressed by gut epithelial cells enabling them to detect bacteria, although receptors such as TLR4 are present at low levels and may be devoid of coactivating molecules (Abreu et al., 2005Abreu M.T. Fukata M. Arditi M. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 4453-4460PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, tolerance of the gut epithelium to major immune activators, such as bacterial LPS, is established very early in life (Lotz et al., 2006Lotz M. Gütle D. Walther S. Ménard S. Bogdan C. Hornef M.W. J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 973-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). And recent evidence in the zebrafish indicates that alkaline phosphatase in the epithelial brush border actively detoxifies bacterial endotoxins in the gut lumen (Bates et al., 2007Bates J.M. Akerlund J. Mittge E. Cell Host Microbe. 2007; 2: 371-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). From a coevolutionary perspective, these observations suggest that LPS may be a major effector driving the mechanisms leading to immune tolerance to the gut microbiota. The gut epithelium also actively monitors the proximity and density of the resident microbiota by sampling bacterial molecules via apical channels such as hPepT1 (Vavricka et al., 2004Vavricka S.R. Musch M.W. Chang J.E. Nakagawa Y. Phanvijhitsiri K. Waypa T.S. Merlin D. Schneewind O. Chang E.B. Gastroenterology. 2004; 127: 1401-1409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Bacterial cell wall components, such as muramyl dipeptide, are transported into cells via these channels and may induce maintenance of a minimal level of “physiological inflammation” by activating NOD (nucleotide-oligomerization domain) proteins (pattern recognition receptors of the innate immune system) in the cytoplasm of gut epithelial and immune cells. In parallel, OCTN2, a cation transporter on the apical surface of epithelial cells, is able to sample quorum-sensing molecules produced by bacterial communities, leading to activation of stress signaling pathways mediated by MAPK, Akt kinase, and heat-shock proteins that maintain the integrity of the epithelial barrier (Fujiya et al., 2007Fujiya M. Musch M.W. Nakagawa Y. Hu S. Alverdy J. Kohgo Y. Schneewind O. Jabri B. Chang E.B. Cell Host Microbe. 2007; 1: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Similarly, the quorum-sensing regulator C12 selectively impairs the activation of NF-κB in mammalian cells (Kravchenko et al., 2008Kravchenko V.V. Kaufmann G.F. Mathison J.C. Scott D.A. Katz A.Z. Grauer D.C. Lehmann M. Meijler M.M. Janda K.D. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 2008; 321: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). TLRs also play a role in this complex choreography: they are sequestered in the intestinal crypts that act as sanctuaries for stem cells and so must be protected. TLRs also mediate essential signals for proliferation of epithelial stem cells in these critical zones (Rakoff-Nahoum et al., 2004Rakoff-Nahoum S. Paglino J. Eslami-Varzaneh F. Edberg S. Medzhitov R. Cell. 2004; 118: 229-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3282) Google Scholar). Thus, the intestinal epithelium provides a highly suitable and adaptable frontline for microbiota to interact with the host and is much more than just a static defensive barrier. Vertebrate hosts have had to develop both innate and adaptive tolerance toward commensal bacteria. Commensals are a source not only of PAMPs but also of foreign antigens that potentially can be recognized by the adaptive immune system. Immune cells in the lamina propria are actively maintained in a state of tolerance to the gut microbiota by epithelial cells. For example, intestinal epithelial cells produce factors such as thymic stromal lymphopoietin that ensure dendritic cells and macrophages in the gut do not induce an inflammatory response (Rimoldi et al., 2005Rimoldi M. Chieppa M. Salucci V. Avogadri F. Sonzogni A. Sampietro G.M. Nespoli A. Viale G. Allavena P. Rescigno M. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). In addition, IKKβ produced by gut epithelial cells maintains this homeostatic balance by promoting mucosal immunity and controlling intestinal inflammation (Zaph et al., 2007Zaph C. Troy A.E. Taylor B.C. Berman-Booty L.D. Guild K.J. Du Y. Yost E.A. Gruber A.D. May M.J. Greten F.R. et al.Nature. 2007; 446: 552-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Similarly, epithelial IKKγ/NEMO is critical for maintaining epithelial integrity and immune homeostasis (Nenci et al., 2007Nenci A. Becker C. Wullaert A. Gareus R. van Loo G. Danese S. Huth M. Nokolaev A. Neufert C. Madison B. et al.Nature. 2007; 446: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). The resident microbiota, by producing TLR-mediated signals, stimulates expression of inhibitory factors that maintain tolerance. The local production of IgA antibodies directed against microbial antigens is also part of the dynamic epithelial barrier that keeps the resident flora in check and allows downregulation of proinflammatory signals (Peterson et al., 2007Peterson D. McNulty N. Guruge J. Gordon J.I. Cell Host Microbe. 2007; 2: 328-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Finally, T regulatory lymphocytes (Tregs) in the gut subepithelium produce IL-10 and TGF-β, factors that are major contributors to inducing tolerance of the innate and adaptive immune systems to the resident gut microbiota (Izcue et al., 2006Izcue A. Coombes J.L. Powrie F. Immunol. Rev. 2006; 212: 256-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). On the host side, any broken link in the chain that maintains physiological inflammation can cause loss of the gut mucosa's ability to keep the resident microbiota in check, leading to a switch from physiological to pathological inflammation. This may be a major cause of a type of inflammatory bowel disease called Crohn's disease. In Crohn's disease, mutations in the gene encoding NOD2, a key element of the homeostasis network, lead to decreased production of antimicrobial β-defensins by gut epithelial cells (Nuding et al., 2007Nuding S. Fellermann K. Wehkamp J. Stange E.F. Gut. 2007; 56: 1240-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This enables commensals to make intimate contact with the epithelial surface (Swidsinski et al., 2002Swidsinski A. Ladhoff A. Pernthaler A. Swidsinski S. Loening-Baucke V. Ortner M. Weber J. Hoffmann U. Schreiber S. Dietel M. Lochs H. Gastroenterology. 2002; 122: 44-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar) resulting in a destructive mucosal inflammation. Defects in the adaptive arm of immune tolerance to the resident microbiota also may lead to inflammation, and experimental models confirm this (Hoffmann et al., 2003Hoffmann J.C. Pawlowski N.N. Kühl A.A. Höhne W. Zeitz M. Pathobiology. 2003; 70: 121-130Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Immunological analyses of gut tissue from Crohn's disease patients indicate a strong bias in favor of T helper (Th) 1 and Th17 cells in the gut lamina propria, which are lymphocytes of the adaptive immune system that induce an inflammatory response (Arseneau et al., 2007Arseneau K.O. Tamagawa H. Pizarro T.T. Cominelli F. Curr. Gastroenterol. Rep. 2007; 9: 508-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Genetic analyses of patients with inflammatory bowel disease will undoubtedly continue to provide key information regarding the essential molecules that regulate the homeostatic balance between the innate and adaptive immune systems of the gut and its resident microbiota. Pathogens produce an arsenal of effectors that enable them to achieve close proximity and colonization of the epithelial surface followed by subversion and destabilization of the epithelial barrier. These effectors include adhesins, invasins, proteases (mucinases), toxins, as well as PAMPs such as hexacylated lipid A. Some pathogens are able to dampen expression or destroy epithelial defenses such as mucus. Invasive microorganisms, such as Shigella, induce decreased production of antimicrobial molecules such as β-defensins and cathelicidin, thereby achieving efficient colonization of epithelial surfaces by escaping the bactericidal effects of these molecules (Spérandio et al., 2008Spérandio B. Regnault B. Guo J. Zhang Z. Stanley Jr., S.L. Sansonetti P.J. Pédron T. J. Exp. Med. 2008; 205: 1121-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Together, these pathogenic properties result in a massive delivery of PAMPs and other signaling molecules to the epithelial and subepithelial surveillance network of TLRs and Nod-like receptors (NLRs) expressed by gut epithelial cells and immune cells (Figure 1). The host immune system thus appears to have evolved under an antagonistic selective pressure enabling it to tolerate the beneficial gut microbiota on the one hand and to combat and eradicate pathogens on the other. The virulence of pathogens may be specifically sensed by the host resulting in an immune response, but what is sensed may be the specific and stereotypic effects of virulence on host tissues. An example of this includes disruption of the extracellular matrix and basement membranes of epithelial cells by bacterial proteases. Another example is disruption of membrane integrity by the pore-forming exotoxins of Gram-positive pathogens or by the type III secretion systems of Gram-negative pathogens, which is sensed by the NALP3 inflammasome of macrophages and other immune cells (Pétrilli et al., 2007Pétrilli V. Dostert C. Muruve D.A. Tschopp J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2007; 19: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). It is not simply tissue damage per se, but rather the very specific alterations in tissue homeostasis associated with pathogen virulence that signal the immune system to mount a protective response. Commensal bacteria are highly heterogeneous, and what counts is the combination of all of their individual properties. It is interesting to consider a “social” view of the ecology of this vast community. Genomic sequencing of individual species, together with metagenomics that provides information on the genomes of most of the gut microbiota (the majority of which cannot be cultured), no doubt will confirm that some commensal microorganisms are potentially more harmful than others. This may be particularly true for Proteobacteria species including probiotic strains like the Nissle 1917 strain that carries virulence genes (Grozdanov et al., 2004Grozdanov L. Raasch C. Schulze J. Sonnenborn U. Gottschalk G. Hacker J. Dobrindt U. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5432-5441Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). These bacteria may be essential for the development of at least some signals that induce immune tolerance, such as those inducing tolerance to LPS, as long as their density is kept in check. Thus, the concept of “good” and “bad” commensals may not withstand a sociological view of the intestinal flora. Moreover, maintaining the balance among the different bacterial species that comprise the microbiota depends on the characteristics of the bacteria themselves and on certain environmental cues, particularly nutrition, which introduces another degree of complexity. Inflammation of the gut epithelium also contributes to loss of homeostatic balance and expansion of potentially more aggressive microorganisms such as the Proteobacteria. This process may explain in part the chronic inflammation of inflammatory bowel disease. Likewise, innate immune signaling through the TLR/MyD88 pathway affects the composition of the intestinal microbiota, and this in turn affects the development of autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes (Wen et al., 2008Wen L. Ley R.E. Volchkov P.Y. Stranges P.B. Avanesyan L. Stonebraker A.C. Hu C. Wong F.S. Szot G.L. Bluestone J.A. et al.Nature. 2008; 455: 1109-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1500) Google Scholar). The notion of “good” and “bad” commensals thus may be a reflection of the balance between representative commensal species and the particular characteristics of the gut milieu. We still have a lot to learn about how homeostasis is maintained between the gut and its microbiota. Deciphering the mechanisms of this homeostasis and its possible rupture will yield essential information about how development, tissue repair, and physiology can be affected by our microbial environment. At stake is our understanding and treatment of major inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease as well as colon cancer and other tumors. Other epithelial surfaces, such as those of the oral cavity and skin, will benefit from this global concept according to which only fighting ignorance guarantees the virtue of tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W2142263762,"Genetic analyses of plant symbiotic mutants has led to the identification of key genes involved in Rhizobium-legume communication as well as in development and function of nitrogen fixing root nodules. However, the impact of these genes in coordinating the transcriptional programs of nodule development has only been studied in limited and isolated studies. Here, we present an integrated genome-wide analysis of transcriptome landscapes in Lotus japonicus wild-type and symbiotic mutant plants. Encompassing five different organs, five stages of the sequentially developed determinate Lotus root nodules, and eight mutants impaired at different stages of the symbiotic interaction, our data set integrates an unprecedented combination of organ- or tissue-specific profiles with mutant transcript profiles. In total, 38 different conditions sampled under the same well-defined growth regimes were included. This comprehensive analysis unravelled new and unexpected patterns of transcriptional regulation during symbiosis and organ development. Contrary to expectations, none of the previously characterized nodulins were among the 37 genes specifically expressed in nodules. Another surprise was the extensive transcriptional response in whole root compared to the susceptible root zone where the cellular response is most pronounced. A large number of transcripts predicted to encode transcriptional regulators, receptors and proteins involved in signal transduction, as well as many genes with unknown function, were found to be regulated during nodule organogenesis and rhizobial infection. Combining wild type and mutant profiles of these transcripts demonstrates the activation of a complex genetic program that delineates symbiotic nitrogen fixation. The complete data set was organized into an indexed expression directory that is accessible from a resource database, and here we present selected examples of biological questions that can be addressed with this comprehensive and powerful gene expression data set."
https://openalex.org/W2068437602,"Differentiating cells can dedifferentiate to replace stem cells in aged or damaged tissues, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. In the Drosophila testis, a cluster of stromal cells called the hub creates a niche by locally activating Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (Jak-STAT) signaling in adjacent germline and somatic stem cells. Here, we establish a system to study spermatogonial dedifferentiation. Ectopically expressing the differentiation factor bag-of-marbles (Bam) removes germline stem cells from the niche. However, withdrawing ectopic Bam causes interconnected spermatogonia to fragment, move into the niche, exchange positions with resident somatic stem cells, and establish contact with the hub. Concomitantly, actin-based protrusions appear on subsets of spermatogonia, suggesting acquired motility. Furthermore, global downregulation of Jak-STAT signaling inhibits dedifferentiation, indicating that normal levels of pathway activation are required to promote movement of spermatogonia into the niche during dedifferentiation, where they outcompete somatic stem cells for niche occupancy."

Myosin VI-mediated cargo transport is essential for a host of cellular processes, including clathrin-dependent endocytosis, the maintenance of the cis- and trans-Golgi network and exocytosis at the Golgi complexes, and the asymmetric distribution of cellular components in polarized cells (see reviews, Buss and Kendrick-Jones, 2008Buss F.

In addition to its transporting roles, myosin VI also serves as an anchor that supports cellular architectures by physically connecting cytoskeletons with its binding targets, such as membranes. As an anchor, myosin VI is indispensable for the development and maintenance of highly organized cellular structures, such as the stereocilia of hair cells in ears (Hasson et al., 1997Hasson T. Gillespie P.G. Garcia J.A. MacDonald R.B. Zhao Y. Yee A.G. Mooseker M.S. Corey D.P. Unconventional myosins in inner-ear sensory epithelia.J.

Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 529-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In addition to myosin VI, other unconventional myosins (e.g., myosin VII, myosin X, and myosin XV) can also function both as transporters and as anchors (Knight et al., 2005Knight P.J. Thirumurugan K. Xu Y. Wang F. Kalverda A.P. Stafford 3rd, W.F. Sellers J.R. Peckham M. The predicted coiled-coil domain of myosin 10 forms a novel elongated domain that lengthens the head.J. Biol.

Dimerized Drosophila myosin VIIa: a processive motor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 5746-5751Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms dictating this functional dichotomy of the unconventional myosins are largely unknown. Myosin VI contains an N-terminal motor domain followed by a short neck (also called the lever arm), a hypothetical coiled-coil domain in the middle, and a C-terminal globular cargo-binding domain (CBD) (Figure 1A). Recent structural and biochemical studies of the motor domain have revealed that a unique insertion between the motor domain and the neck region confers the reverse moving directionality to myosin VI (Bryant et al., 2007Bryant Z. Altman D. Spudich J.A. The power stroke of myosin VI and the basis of reverse directionality.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 772-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, Menetrey et al., 2005Menetrey J. Bahloul A. Wells A.L. Yengo C.M. Morris C.A. Sweeney H.L. Houdusse A.

The structural rearrangement of this insertion, together with the neck, also provides a partial explanation for the large power-stroke of myosin VI (Menetrey et al., 2007Menetrey J. Llinas P.

Recent studies of the putative coiled-coil region indicate that it forms an extended monomeric helix instead of the previously expected dimeric coiled-coil (Rock et al., 2001Rock R.S. Rice S.E. Wells A.L. Purcell T.J. Spudich J.A. Sweeney H.L. Myosin VI is a processive motor with a large step size.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Long single α-helical tail domains bridge the gap between structure and function of myosin VI.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 591-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This finding provides a plausible explanation for the unexpectedly large step size (∼36 nm) of myosin VI but also raises an important question concerning the dimerization mechanism of the motor. The C-terminal CBD of myosin VI recognizes and selects its binding cargoes (Buss et al., 2004Buss F. Spudich G. Kendrick-Jones J. Myosin VI: cellular functions and motor properties.Annu. Rev.

Cell Biol. 2007; 19: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Several adaptor proteins have been reported to interact specifically with the CBD, thus defining the specific subcellular functions of myosin VI: an endocytic adaptor protein Disabled-2 (Dab2), which links myosin VI to clathrin-coated vesicles at the early stages of endocytosis (Buss et al., 2001Buss F. Arden S.D. Lindsay M. Luzio J.P. Kendrick-Jones J.

In addition to cargo recognition, the myosin VI CBD has recently been shown to be involved in the dimerization of myosin VI (Spudich et al., 2007Spudich G. Chibalina M.V. Au J.S. Arden S.D. Buss F. Kendrick-Jones J. Myosin VI targeting to clathrin-coated structures and dimerization is mediated by binding to Disabled-2 and PtdIns(4,5)P2.Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 176-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy (EM) studies of myosin VI in vitro showed that purified myosin VI can form dimers at high concentrations, and this clustering-induced dimerization is somewhat inhibited by its CBD (Park et al., 2006Park H. Ramamurthy B. Travaglia M. Safer D. Chen L.Q. Franzini-Armstrong C. Selvin P.R. Sweeney H.L. Full-length myosin VI dimerizes and moves processively along actin filaments upon monomer clustering.Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 331-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In contrast, a fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based assay in vivo demonstrated that myosin VI forms dimers on the surface of transport vesicles in a CBD-dependent manner (Altman et al., 2007Altman D. Goswami D. Hasson T. Spudich J.A. Mayor S.

Long single α-helical tail domains bridge the gap between structure and function of myosin VI.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 591-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, it has been shown that purified native myosin VI exists as a nonprocessive monomer in solution (Lister et al., 2004Lister I. Schmitz S. Walker M. Trinick J. Buss F. Veigel C. Kendrick-Jones J. A monomeric myosin VI with a large working stroke.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1729-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and the monomeric myosin VI has been proposed to function mainly as an anchor (Buss et al., 2004Buss F. Spudich G. Kendrick-Jones J. Myosin VI: cellular functions and motor properties.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 649-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Therefore, the elucidation of the molecular mechanism governing the monomer-dimer conversion of myosin VI represents a task crucial to understanding the cellular functions of myosin VI as well as other unconventional myosins. Here, we describe our 8 year journey in the elucidation of the myosin VI cargo recognition mechanism. The solution structure of the monomeric apo-myosin VI CBD solved in this work reveals that myosin VI exists as a stable monomer in the absence of cargoes. The crystal structure of the myosin VI CBD/Dab2 complex shows that the myosin VI CBD forms a cargo-induced dimer, suggesting that the motor undergoes a cargo binding-dependent monomer-to-dimer conversion. This cargo binding-mediated monomer-to-dimer conversion mechanism adopted by myosin VI may be shared by other unconventional myosins, such as myosin VII and myosin X. We initiated biochemical and structural characterizations of the myosin CBD when this domain was implicated in cargo selections (Inoue et al., 2002Inoue A. Sato O. Homma K. Ikebe M.

The entire myosin VI CBD contains ∼200 residues, and the N-terminal 1/3 of this 200 residue fragment was shown to bind to lipid membranes and cargoes such as GIPC and optineurin (Reed et al., 2005Reed B.C.

The myosin VI CBD studied in detail here corresponds to the C-terminal ∼2/3 of the entire tail domain (residues 1137–1265). Amino acid sequence alignment analysis showed that the myosin VI CBD is highly conserved throughout its evolution, with no recognizable protein domains known to date and no homologous sequences in other proteins (Figure 1B). Our initial biochemical analysis showed that the myosin VI CBD forms a stable monomer at low concentrations (<0.2 mM) in solution, with a well-folded tertiary structure as indicated by the well-dispersed NMR spectrum of the domain (Figure S1A available online). Unfortunately, the NMR spectra of the CBD deteriorated progressively with the increase of its concentration due to nonspecific sample aggregation (Figure S1B). Extensive efforts in trying to obtain crystals of the CBD were not successful. Systematic NMR-based sample condition screenings with various buffers, salts, and additives revealed that the inclusion of 0.5%–1% CHAPS in the sample buffer significantly improved the quality of the CBD spectra (Figure S1C), suggesting that the domain tends to aggregate via hydrophobic interactions at elevated concentrations. Due to technical difficulties, we were only able to determine the solution structure of the myosin VI CBD in the presence of CHAPS by NMR spectroscopy at a low resolution (data not shown). Nevertheless, this low-resolution structure served as a template for us to design strategies for obtaining the high-resolution structure of the domain. Additionally, the large chemical shift changes of the CBD induced by CHAPS binding indicated that the CBD structure determined in the presence of CHAPS may not represent its bona fide structure in its apo-form (Figures 1C and S2A). Guided by the solution structure of the CBD in the presence of CHAPS and aided by the NMR-based sample condition screenings, we tested a large number of point mutations of the CBD in an attempt to disrupt the concentration-dependent aggregation observed in the wild-type protein. One of the mutants tested, with Leu1209 substituted with Lys (denoted as “L2K”-CBD), displayed an excellent NMR spectrum even at a concentration of ∼1 mM (Figure S1D). Importantly, the spectrum of the L2K-CBD overlaps very well with that of the wild-type protein except for a few residues surrounding Leu1209, indicating that the substitution of Leu1209 with Lys did not introduce significant changes to the structure of the myosin VI CBD (Figures 1C and S2B). We next determined the high-resolution structure of L2K-CBD using NMR spectroscopy. The overall structure of the CBD is well defined except for the N and C termini and the loop between the first and the second β strands (Figure 1D and Table S1). The myosin VI CBD contains four β strands (βA–βD) and six α helices (αA–αF). The four β strands form an antiparallel β sheet, which forms the core of the domain. One side of the β sheet is covered by three helices (αD–αF), which pack with each other perpendicularly; the other side of the sheet is largely exposed to the solvent with a short αC helix capped at one of its edges (Figure 1E). No folds similar to the myosin VI CBD were found in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) when searching with the Dali algorithm (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/dali/). Interestingly, the packing between the helices (αC and αD–αF) and the β sheet is limited to one end (arbitrarily referred to as the up-half) of the β sheet, leaving the lower half of the β sheet completely exposed (Figures 1E and S3). A short and somewhat mobile helix (αB) connects the βA and βB strands at the extreme end of the lower half of the CBD β sheet (Figures 1D and 1E). Analysis of the surface properties of the myosin VI CBD showed that the domain contains a prominent hydrophobic surface located at one face of the lower half of the β sheet (Figures 1E and S3). This hydrophobic surface is responsible for the concentration-dependent aggregation of the wild-type CBD. The structure also explains why the L2K mutation significantly weakens such hydrophobic interactions without altering the overall structure of myosin VI CDB (Figures S3A and S3B). This L2K mutation has been extremely valuable in the structure determination of the apo-form myosin VI CBD. However, the caveat of the mutation is that it essentially prevented the CBD from binding to its targets (see below for details). The best known myosin VI CBD-binding partner known to date is Disabled-2 (Dab2) (Inoue et al., 2002Inoue A. Sato O. Homma K. Ikebe M. DOC-2/DAB2 is the binding partner of myosin VI.Biochem. Biophys.

In view of the critical role of the myosin VI/Dab2 interaction in clathrin-coated vesicle-mediated endocytosis(Mishra et al., 2002Mishra S.K. Keyel P.A. Hawryluk M.J. Agostinelli N.R. Watkins S.C.

Myosin VI binds to and localises with Dab2, potentially linking receptor-mediated endocytosis and the actin cytoskeleton.Traffic. 2002; 3: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), we decided to characterize this interaction in detail. Dab2 is composed of an N-terminal PTB domain and a long C-terminal tail with no recognizable domains (Figure 2A). Dab2 has been shown to bind to myosin VI via its C-terminal tail. It was shown that substitution of the “682SYF684”-motif within this Dab2 C-terminal tail with an “AAA” cassette abolished Dab2's binding to the GST-fused CBD of myosin VI (Morris et al., 2002Morris S.M. Arden S.D. Roberts R.C. Kendrick-Jones J. Cooper J.A. Luzio J.P. Buss F. Myosin VI binds to and localises with Dab2, potentially linking receptor-mediated endocytosis and the actin cytoskeleton.Traffic. 2002; 3: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). We confirmed the direct interaction between the myosin VI CBD and the entire C-terminal tail of the wild-type Dab2 and verified that the 682SYF684-motif of Dab2 is absolutely required for binding to myosin VI (data not shown). A 21 residue synthetic peptide comprising residues 675–695 of Dab2 was used for detailed characterization of the interaction between Dab2 and myosin VI. The boundaries of the Dab2 peptide were chosen based on the following findings: further extension to the N-terminal end beyond residue 675 did not further increase the binding affinity of Dab2 to myosin VI (data not shown), and the C-terminal end was chosen because it was shown that the “699DFD701”-motif of Dab2 was not required for myosin VI binding (Morris et al., 2002Morris S.M. Arden S.D. Roberts R.C. Kendrick-Jones J. Cooper J.A. Luzio J.P. Buss F. Myosin VI binds to and localises with Dab2, potentially linking receptor-mediated endocytosis and the actin cytoskeleton.Traffic. 2002; 3: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). NMR-based titration experiments showed that the Dab2 peptide indeed binds to the myosin VI CBD with a 1:1 stoichiometry. An ITC-based assay showed that the 21 residue Dab2 peptide binds to the myosin VI CBD with a dissociation constant (KD) of ∼0.5 μM (Figure 2C). We believed that this 21 residue peptide most likely represented the complete myosin VI-binding domain of Dab2, and we used NMR and X-ray methods to try to determine the structure of the myosin VI CBD in complex with this 21 residue peptide. However, we were never able to prepare a wild-type CBD/Dab2 peptide complex that was suitable for NMR-based structure determination. Extensive screening for crystals of the complex also failed. We decided to revisit the interaction between the myosin VI CBD and Dab2 using longer fragments of Dab2. Powered by the exquisite sensitivity of NMR chemical shifts in response to target bindings, we discovered that addition of a Dab2 fragment with a C-terminal extension covering the 699DFD701-motif (residues 675–713) induced additional chemical shift changes to a number of residues in the myosin VI CBD (Figure 2B, bottom panel and Figure S4), indicating that the 699DFD701-motif, previously identified to be dispensable for myosin VI binding (Morris et al., 2002Morris S.M. Arden S.D. Roberts R.C. Kendrick-Jones J. Cooper J.A. Luzio J.P. Buss F. Myosin VI binds to and localises with Dab2, potentially linking receptor-mediated endocytosis and the actin cytoskeleton.Traffic. 2002; 3: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), is actively involved in the Dab2/myosin VI interaction. Detailed chemical shift perturbation analysis showed that the binding of the 21 residue Dab2 peptide induced chemical shift changes limited to one side of the CBD β sheet. This 21 residue Dab2 binding side of the myosin VI CBD β sheet (referred to as “site I,” Figures S4A and S4B) is highly hydrophobic (Figure S3B) and complements the hydrophobic nature of the N-terminal half of the longer Dab2 fragment (Figure 2A). Extending the Dab2 peptide to cover the 699DFD701-motif (residues 675–713) induced additional chemical shift changes to the residues located at the opposite side of the myosin VI CBD β sheet (referred to as “site II,” Figures S4C and S4D), which is rich in positively charged residues (Figure S3B) and matches well with a cluster of the negatively charged residues at the C-terminal half of the longer Dab2 fragment (Figure 2A). Taken together, the above biochemical and spectroscopic studies reveal that the myosin VI CBD contains two discrete Dab2-binding sites located at the two sides of the myosin VI CBD β sheet (Figure S4), and that a 39 residue fragment of Dab2 is directly involved in myosin VI binding. The binding affinity of this 39 residue extended Dab2 fragment to the myosin VI CBD (KD ∼80 nM) is about five times higher than the 21 residue Dab2 peptide (Figure 2C). Further extension at the C-terminal end of this 39 residue Dab2 fragment did not increase its binding affinity to the myosin VI CBD (Figure 2C), indicating that this 39 residue Dab2 fragment (instead of the 21 residue Dab2 peptide selected initially) represents the complete myosin VI-binding region of Dab2. We referred to this myosin VI-interacting region as MIR (myosin VI interaction region, Figure 2A). It is noted that the Dab2 MIR sequence is also found in Dab1; this explains why myosin VI also binds to Dab1 (Morris et al., 2002Morris S.M. Arden S.D. Roberts R.C. Kend"

However, the final contribution of newborn neurons to neuronal networks is limited. Here we show that in neural stem cells, stimulation of the “death receptor” CD95 does not trigger apoptosis but unexpectedly leads to increased stem cell survival and neuronal specification. These effects are mediated via activation of the Src/PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, ultimately leading to a global increase in protein translation. Induction of neurogenesis by CD95 was further confirmed in the ischemic CA1 region, in the naive dentate gyrus, and after forced expression of CD95L in the adult subventricular zone. Lack of hippocampal CD95 resulted in a reduction in neurogenesis and working memory deficits. Following global ischemia, CD95-mediated brain repair rescued behavioral impairment. Thus, we identify the CD95/CD95L system as an instructive signal for ongoing and injury-induced neurogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1970930966,"Protease inhibitors (PI) act by blocking human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) polyprotein processing, but there is no direct quantitative correlation between the degree of impairment of Gag processing and virion infectivity at low PI concentrations. To analyze the consequences of partial processing, virus particles were produced in the presence of limiting PI concentrations or by co-transfection of wild-type proviral plasmids with constructs carrying mutations in one or more cleavage sites. Low PI concentrations caused subtle changes in polyprotein processing associated with a pronounced reduction of particle infectivity. Dissection of individual stages of viral entry indicated a block in accumulation of reverse transcriptase products, whereas virus entry, enzymatic reverse transcriptase activity, and replication steps following reverse transcription were not affected. Co-expression of low amounts of partially processed forms of Gag together with wild-type HIV generally exerted a trans-dominant effect, which was most prominent for a construct carrying mutations at both cleavage sites flanking the CA domain. Interestingly, co-expression of low amounts of Gag mutated at the CA-SP1 cleavage site also affected processing activity at this site in the wild-type virus. The results indicate that low amounts (<5%) of Gag processing intermediates can display a trans-dominant effect on HIV particle maturation, with the maturation cleavage between CA and SP1 being of particular importance. These effects are likely to be important for the strong activity of PI at concentrations achieved in vivo and also bear relevance for the mechanism of action of the antiviral drug bevirimat."

The cone shape of PtdEtn is thought to underlie the importance of PtdEtn as a chaperone for membrane protein folding and its role in promoting membrane fusion. Plasmalogens constitute a major fraction of the PtdEtn molecular species in several tissues and cell lineages (3Nagan N. Zoeller R.A. Prog. Lipid Res. 2001; 40: 199-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). PtdEtn headgroup turnover is associated with signal transduction events and protein kinase C activation. PtdEtn is a major reservoir for polyunsaturated fatty acids that are released following cell activation and converted to the myriad of bioactive eicosanoids that regulate cell function. The fatty acid ethanolamides arise from the acylation of the PtdEtn headgroup followed by hydrolysis of N-acyl-PtdEtn. PtdEtn is also used as a precursor for PtdCho, the major membrane phospholipid in mammals. The Pemt gene encodes the only enzyme in this pathway, and PEMT performs all three of the methylation steps (Fig. 1). The significance of PtdEtn methylation to PtdCho production is reflected by the expression of PEMT, which is highest in liver and testis (5Jackowski S. Rehg J.E. Zhang Y.M. Wang J. Miller K.

Although the CDP-Etn pathway was not necessary for growth and differentiation of hepatocytes, the absence of this pathway resulted in significant changes in the phospholipid molecular species composition and the accumulation of TG giving rise to hepatic steatosis. The steps to obtain a hepatocyte-specific knock-out of ECT are outlined in Fig. 2A. The steps were as follows: 1) engineering the plasmid construct depicted in Fig. 2; 2) transducing, screening, and selecting clonal embryonic stem cells that contained a replacement of the endogenous ECT gene with the engineered construct by homologous recombination; 3) injecting mouse blastocysts with the recombinant embryonic stem cells (St. Jude Transgenic Core Facility); 4) screening mouse chimeras for mosaic animals capable of germ line transmission of the engineered ECT gene; and 5) mating the mice carrying the recombinant allele with a transgenic mouse strain globally expressing the FLP1 recombinase. The FLP1 recombinase-mediated deletion of the DNA between the “Frt” sequences (Fig. 2) removed the NeoTK selection cassette and yielded a floxed mouse with the addition of only two 35-bp pieces of new DNA in two introns (Fig. 2A). The ECT floxed mouse was crossed with a transgenic mouse expressing the Cre recombinase under control of the liver-specific albumin promoter (The Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME). The Cre recombinase under control of the albumin promoter mediates the extremely efficient and selective deletion of the genomic DNA between the “loxP” sequences specifically in hepatocytes (30Postic C. Shiota M. Niswender K.D. Jetton T.L. Chen Y. Moates J.M. Shelton K.D. Lindner J. Cherrington A.D. Magnuson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 305-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar). Mice with a tail genotype of Pcyt2fl/fl/Alb-Cre+/0 lacked functional ECT expression in hepatocytes. Routine genotyping used a PCR-based screen of mouse tail DNA using primers specific for the ECT floxed (fl) allele and the Alb-Cre transgene (Fig. 2B). The primers used for Pcyt2 genotyping were as follows: F1, 5′-TGGTGTTGACATGATGATAGCC-3′; R1, 5′-TGACACAAGTGGACAGTTCCC-3′; R2, 5′-CTGCAGTGTGCAAATGGTATG-3′. These data identified mice with a liver-specific knock-out (Pcyt2fl/fl/Alb-Cre+/0) and the floxed (Pcyt2fl/fl/Alb-Cre0/0) control mice arising from each litter. A product of the F1-R2 primer pair (1637 bp) in the floxed liver sample was not observed because of the short extension time in the PCR analysis. The breeding program mated Pcyt2fl/fl mice with Pcyt2fl/fl, albumin-Cre+/0 mice. This strategy on average produced an equal number of mice with either normal ECT levels in the liver (Pcyt2fl/fl, Albumin-Cre0/0) or with an ECT-deficient liver (Pcyt2fl/fl, albumin-Cre+/0), thus providing both mutant mice and littermate controls (floxed) for the experiments. All experimental animals were identified at weaning by PCR-mediated genotyping of tail DNA and were used for experiments between 8 and 16 weeks of age. Animals of either sex exhibited the same phenotype, and thus both sexes were used for experiments. Blood chemistry analysis was performed with five mice per gender and genotype that were fasted overnight. Samples were analyzed by the Veterinary Pathology Core at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Weight monitoring of 6–10 mice per gender and genotype was started at 4 weeks of age and recorded weekly for 12 weeks up to age 16 weeks. All procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Hepatocytes were isolated using the liver perfusion procedure described by Mudra and Parkinson (31Mudra D.R. Parkinson A. Current Protocols in Toxicology.in: 8. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2001: 14.2.1-14.2.13Google Scholar). Briefly, control and ECT-deficient mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital, and their livers were perfused in situ through direct cannulation of the portal vein. All solutions were equilibrated at 37 °C before perfusion. Each liver was perfused at a speed of 7 ml/min first with 50 ml of Krebs-Ringer solution (4.8 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 120 mm NaCl, 24 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and 20 mm glucose) containing 0.1 mm of EGTA and 1.05 mg of Liberase Blendzyme 3 (Roche Applied Science), followed by an additional 50 ml of Krebs-Ringer solution containing 1.4 mm of CaCl2 and 1.2 mg of Liberase Blendzyme 3. The livers were then gently removed and placed in 20 ml of ice-cold of Krebs-Ringer solution containing 1.4 mm CaCl2. Hepatocytes were dispersed by cutting through the liver capsule several times and filtered through a 70-μm cell strainer. The filtrate was then diluted to 30 ml with the same solution and centrifuged at 5000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C. This step was repeated twice. Genomic DNA was extracted from the hepatocytes using the REDExtract-N-Amp Tissue PCR kit (Sigma), following the manufacturer's instruction for mouse tails and tissue. Isolated hepatocytes were cultured at a density of 106 per 60-mm dish in Williams' medium E (32Abu-Elheiga L. Oh W. Kordari P. Wakil S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 10207-10212Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) containing 5 μm glycerol plus [3H]glycerol (20 μCi/ml; specific activity 40 Ci/mmol) or l-[3-3H]serine (10 μCi/ml, specific activity 40 Ci/mmol) obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals. After incubation for the specified times, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped from the culture dishes, counted, and subjected to extraction according to the method of Bligh and Dyer (33Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41848) Google Scholar). The amount of radiolabel incorporated into the organic phase was quantified by scintillation counting. An aliquot of each organic phase was spotted onto silica gel H thin layers (Analtech) that were developed in chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water, 50:25:8:2 (v/v), for separation of the phospholipids or chloroform/methanol/acetic acid, 98:2:1 (v/v), for separation of the neutral lipids. PtdCho, PtdEtn, PtdSer, DAG, and TG were identified by co-migration with standards, and the corresponding areas of silica gel were scraped from the plates, and the fractional distribution of the lipids was determined by scintillation counting. Radiolabeled secreted lipids were quantified following extraction of the culture medium and thin layer chromatography of aliquots of the organic phase on silica gel H layers developed in chloroform/methanol/acetic acid, 98:2:1. The standard ECT assays contained the following: CTP (2 mm), Mg2Cl (10 mm), Tris-HCl (0.1 m), pH 8.0, phospho-[14C]Etn (50 μm; final specific activity 5 μCi/μmol), and soluble cell lysate (0–80 μg of protein) in a final volume of 50 μl. The reaction was started by the addition of protein and stopped by the addition of acetic acid. The CDP-[14C]Etn product was separated from substrate by thin layer chromatography on silica gel H layers developed with 2% ammonium hydroxide, 95% ethanol (1:1; v/v). The substrate (Rf = 0.4) and CDP-Etn product (Rf = 0.8) were visualized using a Bioscan AR2000 radiochromatography imaging scanner and the appropriate areas scraped from the plate and quantified by scintillation counting. Protein was determined using the Bradford method (34Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). Lipids were extracted using a slight modification of the Bligh and Dyer method (33Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41848) Google Scholar) that had been optimized for lipid quantitation by the LipidMaps group (35Ivanova P.T. Milne S.B. Byrne M.O. Xiang Y. Brown H.A. Methods Enzymol. 2007; 432: 21-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We determined the amount of each major lipid class using flame ionization mass detection following thin layer chromatography with the Iatroscan instrument (Iatron, Inc.). Phospholipids were separated using chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (50:25:8:2; v/v), and neutral lipid classes were separated using hexane/ether/acetic acid (90:10:1; v/v) on high resolution glass rods coated with a thin layer of silica gel chromatography medium. PtdSer was quantified following fractionation by column chromatography as described below followed by thin layer chromatography using a solvent system of chloroform/methanol/ammonium hydroxide (60:35:0.9; v/v). The lipids were identified by co-migration with standards, and a standard curve was prepared for each lipid class and used, along with the dilution factor from the original sample, to determine the amount of each lipid class present in the sample. The amount of DAG was quantified in liver extracts as described previously (36Preiss J.E. Loomis C.R. Bell R.M. Niedel J.E. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 141: 294-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Briefly, liver extracts obtained as described above or 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol standard solutions (Avanti, Alabaster, AL) were solubilized in octyl-β-d-glucoside/cardiolipin, and the DAG mass was determined by enzymatic assay in a reaction buffer containing 90 mm imidazole HCl, pH 6.6, 90 mm NaCl, 22 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm EGTA, 4.5 mm dithiothreitol, 4 μg DAG kinase (Sigma), 1 mm ATP, and 0.02 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (30 Ci/mmol) in a total volume of 24.5 μl. The samples were incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 750 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:2; v/v) and 175 μl of 1% HClO4 and vigorous mixing. The [32P]phosphatidic acid product was extracted with 250 μl of chloroform and an equal volume of 1% HClO4. The upper layer was discarded, and the lower layer was washed twice with 500 μl of 1% HClO4. The lower layer was spotted onto a TLC plate developed in chloroform, methanol, acetic acid, 88% formic acid (65:27:7:3; v/v). The dried plate was exposed to a phosphor screen, and the phosphorylated product was quantified using ImageQuant 5.2 software. Phospholipid molecular species fingerprints were determined using direct-infusion electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry technology (35Ivanova P.T. Milne S.B. Byrne M.O. Xiang Y. Brown H.A. Methods Enzymol. 2007; 432: 21-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 37Krank J. Murphy R.C. Barkley R.M. Duchoslav E. McAnoy A. Methods Enzymol. 2007; 432: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Mass spectrometry analysis was performed at the Hartwell Center for Bioinformatics and Biotechnology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, using a Finnigan™ TSQ® Quantum (Thermo Electron, San Jose, CA) triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with the nanospray ion source. PtdCho or PtdEtn was dissolved in 50:50 (v/v) chloroform, methanol + 1% formic acid; PtdSer and PtdIns were dissolved in 50:50 chloroform/methanol; and TG was dissolved in 50:50 chloroform, methanol + 5 mm ammonium acetate. The instrument was operated in positive ion mode for PtdCho, PtdEtn, and TG and negative ion mode for PtdSer and PtdIns. Ion source parameters were as follows: spray voltage 1000 V, capillary temperature 270 °C, capillary offset 35 V, and tube lens offset was set by infusion of the polytyrosine tuning and calibration solution (Thermo Electron, San Jose, CA) in electrospray mode; PtdCho, scan range, 600–900 m/z; scan time, 0.3 s; product mass, 184.1 m/z; collision energy, 40 V; peak width, Q1 and Q3 0.7 full width at half-maximum (FWHM); and Q2 CID gas, 0.5 mT; PtdEtn, scan range, 600–900; m/z; scan time, 0.3 s; neutral loss mass, 141.0 m/z; collision energy, 30 V; peak width, Q1 and Q3 0.7 FWHM; and Q2 CID gas, 0.5 mT. Instrument control and data acquisition was performed using a Finnigan™ Xcalibur™ software (Thermo Electron, San Jose, CA). The molecular species composition of the TG pool was determined as described (37Krank J. Murphy R.C. Barkley R.M. Duchoslav E. McAnoy A. Methods Enzymol. 2007; 432: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) following the removal of the phospholipids by column chromatography. TG scan range was 700–1000 m/z; scan time was 0.5 s; and peak width was Q1 0.7 FWHM. PtdSer and PtdIns were profiled by mass spectrometry (38Alvarez J.G. Touchstone J.C. J. Chromatogr. 1992; 577: 142-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) following separation from the major phospholipids using a Discovery DSC-NH2 solid phase extraction column (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA) (39Brügger B. Erben G. Sandhoff R. Wieland F.T. Lehmann W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 2339-2344Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). In brief, the column was conditioned with 8 ml of hexane, and lipid extract was added. Nonpolar lipids were eluted with 6 ml of 2:1 (v/v) chloroform/isopropyl alcohol; fatty acids were eluted with 6 ml of ether, 2% acetic acid; PtdCho and PtdEtn were eluted with 6 ml of methanol; and PtdSer and PtdIns were eluted with 6 ml of chloroform, methanol, 0.8 m sodium acetate, 60:30:4.5 (v/v). For PtdSer, the scan range was 600–900 m/z, scan time 0.5 s, neutral loss mass 87.0 m/z, collision energy 25 V, peak width Q1 and Q3 0.7 FWHM, and Q2 CID, gas 0.5 mT. For PtdIns, the scan range was 600–1100 m/z, scan time 0.5 s, parent mass 241.0 m/z, collision energy 45 V, peak width Q1 and Q3 0.7 FWHM, and Q2 CID gas, 0.5 mT. Acquisition parameters for a neutral loss scan that was used to identify the fatty acyl groups that constitute a particular mass peak were as follows: scan range 600–900 m/z, scan time 0.5 s, collision energy 30 V, peak width Q1 and Q3 0.7 FWHM, and Q2 CID gas 0.5 mT. For the neutral loss mass, the following fatty acyl groups and m/z were used: 16:0, 256; 16:1, 254; 18:0, 284; 18:1, 282; 18:2, 280; 20:4, 304; and 22:6, 328. Mouse tissues were analyzed using paraffin sections. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and perfused intracardially with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline. Liver tissue was dissected from the animal and incubated at 4 °C overnight in 10% formalin prior to dehydration in ethanol and embedding in paraffin. Paraffin sections were cut to 4 μm thickness. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Sample preparation was performed in the Animal Diagnostic Lab and viewed with an Olympus BX41 microscope. After animal perfusion as described above, tissue samples were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer (Tousimis, Rockville, MD). Following postfixation in 0.8% osmium tetroxide, 3% ferrocyanide, 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were stained en bloc with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate, followed by ethanol dehydration. The samples were embedded in Spurr's epoxy resin, and ultrathin sections (∼75 nm) from selected blocks were mounted on 1 × 2-mm grids and examined using a Philips CM10 electron microscope (FEI, Hillsboro, OR) at 50–80 kV. These tasks were performed by the St. Jude Imaging Shared Resource. Total RNA was isolated from livers of 4–7 control and ECT-deficient mice of either sex using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Pelleted RNA was resuspended in nuclease-free water, digested with DNase I to remove any contaminating genomic DNA, aliquoted, re-precipitated in ethanol, and stored at −20 °C. Synthesis of first-strand cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription using SuperScript™ II RNase H− reverse transcriptase, the RNA templates, and random primers. Quantitative real time PCR was performed in triplicate using the ABI Prism® 7700 Sequence detection system. The primers used are listed in supplemental Table S1. The reaction mixtures contained SYBR Green PCR Master Mix, 10 ng of cDNA, and 150 nm of the appropriate primers. Cyclophilin B mRNA was used as a control. All of the real time values were compared using the CT method. The two-tailed t test for significance between means was used to compare results between mouse groups. The statistical analysis package included in GraphPad Prism software was used to perform the calculations and graphical analysis. An adult knock-out mouse model lacking a functional CDP-Etn pathway in hepatocytes because of the specific deletion of the ECT gene (Pcyt2) was derived as outlined in Fig. 2A and detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” Control (floxed) mice lacked the Alb-Cre transgene (tail genotype = Pcyt2fl/fl/Alb-Cre0/0), and the mice with an ECT-deficient liver harbored the Alb-Cre transgene (tail genotype = Pcyt2fl/fl/Alb-Cre+/0).

To better understand the molecular mechanism by which spiders anchor their threads to a solid support, we solubilized the attachment discs from black widow spiders and performed in-solution tryptic digests followed by MS/MS analysis to identify novel peptides derived from glue silks. Combining matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization tandem time-of-flight mass spectrometry and cDNA library screening, we isolated a novel member of the silk gene family called pysp1 and demonstrate that its protein product is assembled into the attachment disc silks.

MS/MS analysis also confirmed the presence of MaSp1 and MaSp2, two important components of dragline silks, anchored within the attachment disc materials. Characterization of the ultrastructure of attachment discs using scanning electron microscopy studies support the localization of PySp1 to small diameter fibers embedded in a glue-like cement, which network with large diameter dragline silk threads, producing a strong, adhesive material. Consistent with elevated PySp1 mRNA levels detected in the pyriform gland, MS analysis of the luminal contents extracted from the pyriform gland after tryptic digestion support the assertion that PySp1 represents one of the major constituents manufactured in the pyriform gland.

All spiders (order Araneae, ∼40,000 described species) spin silk, but members of the highly diverse suborder Araneomorphae (∼37,000 species) spin multiple high performance fibers that enable them to perform a wide range of functions, including prey capture, locomotion, and protection of developing offspring (1Foelix R. Biology of Spiders. Oxford University Press, New York1996Google Scholar, 2Schultz J.W. Biol. Rev. 1987; 62: 89-113Crossref Google Scholar). Araneomorph spiders use specialized abdominal glands to express up to seven different fibroins, protein-based silks/glues, that have diverse mechanical properties. Over the past 20 years, seven distinct members of the silk gene family have been identified and characterized at the molecular level, which include the silk proteins MaSp1 and MaSp2 (dragline silk)(3Xu M.

These spider fibroins have revealed that they share a number of distinctive properties, including four fundamental amino acid repeat motifs that characterize the majority of the family: (i) alternating glycine alanine couplets (GAn), (ii) polyalanine blocks (An), (iii) GGX (X = subset of residues, which include Leu, Ile, and Ala), and (iv) GPGXn. Biophysical studies support that repeated GA couplets or polyalanine blocks form β sheet structures that correspond to the crystalline regions in the spun fibers, which provide much of the high tensile strengths for these silk types (15Simmons A. Ray E. Jelinski L.W. Macromolecules. 1994; 27: 5235-5237Crossref Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 16van Beek J.D. Hess S. Vollrath F. Meier B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

GPGXn repeats, which are found in MaSp2 and Flag silk, have been hypothesized to form β turn structures, which provide extensibility to the threads (14Hayashi C.Y. Lewis R.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 773-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). To date, the only reported full-length gene sequences from the spider silk family include masp1, masp2, and cysp1 (11Zhao A.C. Zhao T.F. Nakagaki K. Zhang Y.S. Sima Y.H. Miao Y.G. Shiomi K. Kajiura Z. Nagata Y. Takadera M. Nakagaki M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 3348-3356Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 18Ayoub N.A.

These gene sequences are known to encode large molecular mass proteins, with their corresponding predicted molecular masses representing 250, 311, and 277 kDa, respectively. Although much emphasis has been placed on studying the major and minor ampullate glands, as well as the tubuliform glands of araneomorph spiders, little, if any information regarding the chemical properties of the pyriform gland has been reported. Based upon observational and histological data, the pyriform gland has been implicated in the production of attachment disc silks, which function to affix dragline silk to substrates (19Kovoor J. Zylberberg L. Tissue Cell. 1980; 12: 547-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 20Kovoor J. Zylberberg L. Tissue Cell. 1982; 14: 519-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 21Vollrath F. Knight D.P. Nature. 2001; 410: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1353) Google Scholar). SEM data support the spigots of the pyriform gland as being relatively small and numerous, located near the major ampullate spigots on the same spinneret (22Moon M.J. An J.S. Entomological Res. 2006; 36: 133-138Crossref Google Scholar). Attachment discs have an important biological function for the spider, as they serve to cement dragline silks to a solid support, anchoring the web to wood, concrete, or other surfaces during web construction for prey capture. Additionally, dragline silk, which is often referred to as a “safety line” for the spider has been observed to fuse with attachment disc silk, providing dragline silk with a secure anchor point for locomotor functions to assist prey capture and predator evasion. Although the current hypothesis supports the pyriform gland in the production of fibroins that are spun into short, sticky threads, no glue silk fibroin family members have been identified and characterized at the molecular level that match this description. Moreover, given the nature of attachment disc silks, which are spun in a gluey liquid material that dries to facilitate affixing dragline silk, it is uncertain whether the biochemical properties of the attachment disc silk fibroins would be highly divergent from traditional silk family members. To investigate the hypothesis that the pyriform gland manufactures silk fibroins to help anchor dragline silk to solid surfaces, we solubilized the attachment discs with chaotropic agents, followed by in-solution tryptic digests and MS/MS analysis to search for peptides potentially derived from the sticky threads.

MS analysis of 55 distinct peptides, coupled with cDNA library screening, led to the identification of a cDNA that encodes a new member of the spider silk gene family. Molecular and biochemical studies indicated that the pyriform gland was chiefly responsible for the expression of this gene, and it was subsequently named pyriform spidroin 1 (pysp1). Translation of the PySp1 cDNA revealed internal iterated blocks with a high degree of polar amino acid residues (Gln, Glu, Arg, and Lys) adjacent to triplet alanine repeats, with substantial divergence relative to repeat modules found within traditional fibroin family members. Translation of the PySp1 cDNA revealed the highest levels of alanine relative to other reported fibroin family members; however, surprisingly, little, if any, glycine was found in the PySp1 protein. Phylogenetic analysis of the C terminus revealed that PySp1 was a member of the spider silk family, but also showed that it was a highly divergent fibroin with distinctive internal molecular features. Collectively, these data suggest the unique chemical properties of PySp1 likely facilitate its ability to be spun into a sticky liquid environment that is well suited to cement dragline silk to solid surfaces. Given the specialized chemical properties of PySp1, these findings have substantial impact for structural biologists and material scientists seeking to engineer synthetic silks that have diverse properties for applications that include body armor, ropes and cords, tissue engineering, and drug delivery. mass spectrometry matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight scanning electronmicrograph major ampullate spidroin 1 and 2 minor ampullate spidroin 1-like aciniform spidroin 1-like pyriform spidroin 1 open reading frame. Attachment disc silks were collected by anchoring the backside of SEM stubs to the walls of glass jars using tape. After several days, the spiders would spin attachment disc silks on the surface of the stubs. After detaching the top portion of the anchored scaffolding fibers embedded in the attachment disc silks from the SEM stubs using scissors, the attachment disc structures were analyzed using previously described procedures (23Hu X.

Spiders were placed into glass jars (∼8 inches tall and 3 inches in diameter) along with a small wooden stick for 2 weeks. Each spider was fed one cricket every 2 weeks. Prior to solubilization of the attachment discs, the scaffolding fibers were carefully severed with scissors. Using a sterile surgical blade, >200 attachment discs were scraped off the walls of glass jars. Materials on the blade were collectively dissolved in less than 50 μl of 9 m LiBr and pooled in a single microcentrifuge tube. After solubilization of the attachment discs, the solution was brought up to a 100-μl final reaction volume. To facilitate solubilization, the sample was heated for 20 min at 95 °C and then vortexed for an additional 20 min. Following vortexing, the sample was diluted from 9 to 1 m LiBr using 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate. LiBr was selected because it has been shown to be an effective solvent in dissolving fibroins (24Sponner A. Vater W. Monajembashi S. Unger E. Grosse F. Weisshart K. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e998Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Samples were digested and the peptides extracted and desalted as previously described (6Vasanthavada K. Hu X. Falick A.M.

Conventional mass spectra were obtained with a MALDI-TOF-TOF mass spectrometer (4800 Proteomics Analyzer, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) operated in reflectron mode. MS/MS spectra were obtained by operating this same instrument in MS/MS mode. De novo peptide sequences were obtained by manual interpretation of the high energy collision-activated dissociation spectra. Samples from the in-solution tryptic digest of attachment discs were separated by high pressure liquid chromatography and analyzed by mass spectrometry as previously described (6Vasanthavada K. Hu X. Falick A.M. La Mattina C. Moore A.M. Jones P.R. Yee R. Reza R. Tuton T. Vierra C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 35088-35097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For the mass spectrometric analysis involving the luminal contents isolated from the pyriform gland, the proteins were extracted as described in the amino acid composition section. Following extraction of the proteins, the sample was re-suspended in buffer, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by MALDI-TOF as outlined above. A composite cDNA library was prepared from the seven different silk-producing glands of the black widow spider. Hundreds of distinct clones were randomly isolated and subject to DNA sequencing as previously described (25Mitchell B. Mugiya M. Youngblom J. Funes-Duran M. Miller R. Ezpeleta J. Rigby N. Vierra C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1492: 320-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). After DNA sequencing, a single clone was identified that carried a ∼2.4-kb cDNA insert that contained a long open reading frame (ORF) with a predicted region that showed similarity to the conserved, non-repetitive C-terminal region common to spider silk gene family members. This cDNA fragment was subsequently used to re-screen the cDNA library using conventional nucleic acid-nucleic acid hybridization to obtain a larger ∼3.6-kb cDNA fragment. The C terminus DNA sequence for pysp1 was aligned with sequences obtained from GenBankTM representing all known members of the spidroin family except misp2, which was not available. Preliminary alignments were created in MUSCLE (26Edgar R.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1792-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (31027) Google Scholar) and were heavily modified in MacClade version 4.08 (27Maddison D.R. Maddison W.P. MacClade Version 4.08. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA2005Google Scholar) by eye with reference to the translated amino acid sequence. The data matrix consisted of 55 taxa that each contained 342 base pairs. The data were analyzed using the maximum likelihood criterion and a stochastic genetic algorithm with 25 replications as implemented in GARLI version 0.96 (28Zwickl D.J. Genetic Algorithm Approaches for the Phylogenetic Analysis of Large Biological Sequence Datasets under the Likelihood Criterion, Version 0.95. The University of Texas, Austin, TX2006Google Scholar). Data were analyzed using (a) the GTR+G model for nucleotide data, (b) the Goldman and Yang (29Goldman N. Yang Z. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1994; 11: 725-736PubMed Google Scholar) model for codons with F3 × 4 codon frequencies, and (c) the WAG+G+I+F model for amino acids (30Whelan S. Goldman N. Mol. Biol.

Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 2104-2105Crossref PubMed Scopus (2544) Google Scholar). One hundred nonparametric bootstrap replicates were also performed in GARLI for each evolutionary model. Luminal fluids were collected by separately treating each of the flagelliform, aggregate, tubuliform, and pyriform glands using an established protocol (6Vasanthavada K. Hu X. Falick A.M.

Turner D. Houchin K. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1999; 24: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from each of the seven different silk-producing glands, as well as fat tissue, using TRIzolTM according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription reactions and real-time PCR analyses were performed as previously described (34Nguyen L. Round J. O'Connell R. Geurts P. Funes-Duran M. Wong J. Jongeward G. Vierra C.A.

Oligonucleotides used for the analysis of PySp1 were the forward and reverse primers 5′-AGC TGC TGC CAA AGC TAA AA-3′ and 5′-GGA GGA AGC ACT TTC ACT GC-3′, respectively. Primers used for normalization were designed using the housekeeping gene, β-actin (6Vasanthavada K. Hu X. Falick A.M. La Mattina C. Moore A.M. Jones P.R. Yee R. Reza R. Tuton T. Vierra C. J. Biol.

To investigate the physical structure of attachment discs produced by the black widow spider, female spiders were allowed to spin attachment discs on the surface of either cardboard paper (Fig. 1A) or SEM stubs. Analyses of the attachment discs spun directly on stubs for SEM revealed the presence of large diameter fibers that penetrated into a glue-like matrix, with the sticky material making several distinct contacts to the surface with finger-like projections (Fig. 1B). These large diameter threads represent dragline silk fibers anchored to the surface, which are embedded in a glue-like substance containing smaller diameter fibers (Fig. 1C). Complex networks of the smaller diameter fibers were observed that formed a mesh-like structure (Fig. 1D). Larger diameter fibers measuring 4 ± 0.2 μm, a size consistent with major ampullate silks from the black widow spider, were observed leading into the attachment disc structure (Fig. 1B). Smaller diameter fibers were 1 order of magnitude smaller relative to the large diameter fibers, measuring 0.4 ± 0.02 μm. To identify the major structural proteins within the attachment discs, we solubilized the attachment discs using LiBr and performed biochemical analyses on the dissolved proteins. SEM was used to monitor the effectiveness of the solubilization process (data not shown). MALDI-TOF analysis of the in-solution tryptic digests from the solubilized attachment discs revealed 55 distinct peptide masses (data not shown). All 55 peptides were sequenced using high energy collision-activated dissociation. Analysis of the peptide sequences against the nrNCBI protein data base using BLASTp revealed that 23 peptides were similar to MaSp1 or MaSp1 variants (identities ranged from 78 to 100% with peptide lengths spanning from 11 to 29 residues), 1 peptide matched MaSp2 (100% identity for 19 amino acid residues) and 29 peptides showed no significant matches to other proteins in the data base. Six of the peptides derived from the MaSp molecules, those with m/z values of 1319.6, 1611.8, 1622.8, 2372.1, 3115.5, and 3297.5, are shown in Table 1. Of the 29 unknown peptides, peptide ions 864.4, 986.5, 1014.5, 1553.7, 1595.8, and 2267.1 are reported in Table 1. The product ion spectra for the peptides MH+ 986.5 and 1563.8 are shown in Fig. 2, A and B, respectively. The N termini of ions 1553.7, 2372.1, 3115.5, and 3297.5 could not be successfully retrieved, but a significant amount of amino acid sequence was obtained (Table 1). Two remaining peptide ions, those with m/z values of 1206.6 and 1222.7, contained sequences that were 100 and 90% identical, respectively, to regions found within SCP-1, a glue-coating peptide previously reported on gumfooted lines, scaffolding threads, and egg sacs in the black widow spider (35Hu X.

Collectively, these data support the presence of the dragline silk fibroins MaSp1 and MaSp2, along with SCP1 and other uncharacterized proteins, embedded within attachment disc material.TABLE 1MS/MS analyses of tryptic fragments generated from the in-solution digest of solubilized attachment discs from L. hesperus supports the presence of the dragline silk fibroins MaSp1 and MaSp2, silk coating peptide SCP-1, as well as other proteinsDe novo sequences obtained by mass spectrometryPeptide mass (M+H)SequenceIdentity864.4AYAEALARPySp1*986.5AQAQAEAAARPySp1*1014.5AQAQVEAAARPySp1*1206.6AVHHYEVPVRSCP11222.7AVHHYEVLVRSCP11319.6AAAGGAG(AG/Q)GGLGGYGRMaSp11553.7…LAPYYGNYYRUnknown1563.8LASLSQAMSSVLSGGRPySp1*1595.8TTVPLYLQFTEQRUnknown1611.8(N/GG)AGQGGAAAAAAAAAGAGQRMaSp11622.8GPGGSGAAAAAAAAAGGAGGPRMaSp22267.1YLYLDDNVLNGAQNWLLSRUnknown2372.1…GGQGAGQGGAGAAAAAAAAGGAGQGGQRMaSp13115.5…DNGVTTNALADALTSAFYQTTGVVNSRMaSp13297.5…GGYGQGGYGQGGAGQGGAGAAAAAAAAAGGAGQGGYGRMaSp1 Open table in a new tab During a random cDNA library screen for silk genes, we fortuitously isolated a ∼2.4-kb cDNA sequence that, after translation, indicated the fragment contained a long ORF. Analysis of the ORF indicated that the fragment encoded the C-terminal region of a putative silk fibroin. Using the 2.4-kb cDNA fragment as a probe to screen our cDNA library by conventional nucleic acid-nucleic acid hybridization, we isolated a longer cDNA sequence that was ∼3.6 kb (ORF; GenBank accession FJ973621; Fig. 3A). Translation of this cDNA sequence revealed no in-frame translational start codon, suggesting this cDNA represents a partial sequence. The longest ORF encodes a 1153-amino acid protein, with a predicted molecular mass of 116.5 kDa. Based upon the sequences of full-length silk family members, which predict masses ranging from ∼250 to 310 kDa, this implies our cDNA sequence likely corresponds to ∼50% of the PySp1 gene sequence. Protein-protein BLAST searches against the nrNCBI data base using the last 122 amino acids, which corresponds to the highly conserved, non-repetitive C-terminal region in the spider silk gene family, revealed similarity to other members of the spider gene family. Alignment of the C-terminal 122 amino acid residues of this clone to fibroins MaSp1, MaSp2, AcSp1-like, MiSp1-like, and TuSp1 from L. hesperus revealed conservation at specific residues, but divergence in others (Fig. 3B). However, when the 3.6-kb translated cDNA sequence was analyzed using BLASTp against the protein data base, there were no strong matches to any of the spider gene family members. The top matches corresponded to a hypothetical protein from Streptococcus pneumoniae (GenBank accession ZP02717830; E-value 8 × 10−83 with 370/1059 identities), a kinetoplast-associated protein-like protein from Leishmania braziliensis (GenBank accession XP_001565786; E-value 1 × 10−74 with 448/909 identities), and a neurofilament protein from Trichomonas vaginalis (GenBank accession EAY15892.1; E-value 6 × 10−72 with 333/892 identities). Manual inspection of the translated cDNA revealed novel short block repeats. These repeats consisted of the sequences AAARAQAQAEARAKAE and AAARAQAQAE, which were iterated many times within our translated PySp1 cDNA. Interestingly, scattered throughout the amino acid sequence there were short blocks of alanine that consisted of 3 residues (Fig. 3A). Three larger 78-amino acid iterations were found to interrupt runs of the AAARAQAQAEARAKAE and AAARAQAQAE motifs; these 78-amino acid iterations were exceptionally hydrophilic, containing over 14% histidine, 22% serine, 14% threonine, 10% glutamine, and 7% glutamic acid (Fig. 3A). Theoretical digestion of the translated cDNA sequence with trypsin revealed two peptides that contained identical sequences to those found for ions 986.5 and 1563.8; these ions were found in the in-solution tryptic digest of the attachment discs (compare Table 1 to Fig. 3A). Peptide ion 986.5, which was found 10 times within the translated amino acid sequence, represents part of a novel molecular module that is absent in other spidroin family members (Fig. 3A). Additionally, peptide ion 1563.8, which localized to the non-repetitive conserved region, was unique to our translated cDNA and was not found in the C-terminal regions of other family members (Fig. 3B). Phylogenetic analysis of a 342-base pair alignment of the C terminus of spider fibroin genes strongly support that PySp1 is a member of the fibroin gene family. Both the codon and amino acid models indicate PySp1 is closely related to the TuSp group (Fig. 3C), whereas the nucleotide model placed the pysp1 sister to the flag genes, with this grouping closest to the tusp gene (data not shown). Bootstrap values for these basal nodes were low. To compare the theoretical amino acid composition of PySp1 to other fibroin family members, we translated their sequences and analyzed their amino acid percentages. Translation of the PySp1 cDNA revealed that this fibroin contained the highest amount of alanine but the lowest amount of glycine relative to other fibroin family members (Fig. 3D). PySp1 also contained the highest amount of glutamic acid, as well as significant amounts of the polar amino acid residues serine, threonine, arginine, lysine, and glutamine. Relative to the other spidroins, PySp1 displayed the largest percentages of amino acid residues with R groups with either positive (Lys and Arg, Fig. 3D) or negative charges (Glu and Asp, Fig. 3D). Although the protein sequences for TuSp1, MiSp1-like, AcSp1-like, and PySp1 represent partial sequences, their amino acid composition profiles are assumed to be representative of the full-length sequences because silk protein family members are largely comprised of block repeat modules. Overall, these data support the assertion that the PySp1 protein is unique and has distinctive molecular properties relative to other fibroin family members, representing a novel fibroin member. Recent studies have shown that spider silk glands are specialized structures designed to store large quantities of silk proteins (7Hayashi C.Y. Blackledge T.A. Lewis R.V. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2004; 21: 1950-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In many cases, it has been shown that a single silk family member is stored within one silk-producing gland. To determine whether PySp1 was the major constituent stored within the pyriform gland, we extracted the luminal contents and hydrolyzed the proteins with acid for an amino acid composition analysis. Comparative analysis of the predicted amino acid composition of PySp1 to the hydrolyzed luminal contents revealed remarkably similar amino acid percentages for serine and glutamine (Table 2). Despite the similarities for several amino acid residues, alanine levels were substantially higher in the translated PySp1 cDNA relative to the stored contents within the pyriform gland (Table 2). To compare the amino acid composition profiles for the luminal proteins stored within all seven silk producing glands from L. hesperus, we extracted the proteins and performed acid hydrolysis, followed by quantification of the residues (Fig. 4).

By immobilizing microscopic chromatin-coated beads on slide surfaces using a microprinting technique, we have examined the effect of chromatin on the dimensions and symmetry of spindles in Xenopus laevis cytoplasmic extracts. While circular spots with diameters around 14–18 μm trigger bipolar spindle formation, larger spots generate an incorrect number of poles. We also examined lines of chromatin with various dimensions. Their length determined the number of poles that formed, with a 6 × 18 μm rectangular patch generating normal spindle morphology. Around longer lines, multiple poles formed and the structures were disorganized. While lines thinner than 10 μm generated symmetric structures, thicker lines induced the formation of asymmetric structures where all microtubules are on the same side of the line. Our results show that chromatin defines spindle shape and orientation.For a video summary of this article, see the PaperFlick file available with the online Supplemental Data."
https://openalex.org/W1987585617,"In addition to genetic changes, the occurrence of epigenetic alterations is associated with accumulation of both genetic and epigenetic events that promote the development and progression of human cancer. Previously, we reported a set of candidate genes that comprise part of the emerging “cancer methylome”. In the present study, we first tested 23 candidate genes for promoter methylation in a small number of primary colon tumor tissues and controls. Based on these results, we then examined the methylation frequency of Oncostatin M receptor-β (OSMR) in a larger number of tissue and stool DNA samples collected from colon cancer patients and controls. We found that OSMR was frequently methylated in primary colon cancer tissues (80%, 80/100), but not in normal tissues (4%, 4/100). Methylation of OSMR was also detected in stool DNA from colorectal cancer patients (38%, 26/69) (cut-off in TaqMan-MSP, 4). Detection of other methylated markers in stool DNA improved sensitivity with little effect on specificity. Promoter methylation mediated silencing of OSMR in cell lines, and CRC cells with low OSMR expression were resistant to growth inhibition by Oncostatin M. Our data provide a biologic rationale for silencing of OSMR in colon cancer progression and highlight a new therapeutic target in this disease. Moreover, detection and quantification of OSMR promoter methylation in fecal DNA is a highly specific diagnostic biomarker for CRC."

Our results demonstrate that Sfrp1 is required to maintain HSC homeostasis through extrinsic regulation of β-catenin. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) reside in a heterogeneous microenvironment (or niche) in which they generate all mature blood cells. The niche is made up of several different cell types: hematopoietic cells at different stages of differentiation, vascular cells, bone-lining cells, as well as neural cells that tightly regulate the self-renewal capacity and multipotency of HSCs (Morrison and Spradling, 2008Morrison S.J. Spradling A.C. Stem cells and niches: mechanisms that promote stem cell maintenance throughout life.Cell. 2008; 132: 598-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar). The microenvironment permits the maintenance of HSCs for the entire lifetime of an organism. Moreover, the microenvironment is an efficient sensor of cellular stress, which allows flexible responses to maintain the steady state of the blood cell system. The precise mechanisms of HSC maintenance are still not fully understood. Prominent players in the regulation of self-renewal and differentiation are the lipid-modified Wnt-signaling members. The Wnt family members bind frizzled (Fzd) receptors to activate downstream signaling in catenin-dependent canonical and noncanonical pathways. In the canonical pathway, Fzd associates with the Lrp5/6 receptor, and signals are propagated through catenins to activate Tcf/Lef transcription complexes. The level of catenins is regulated through serine and threonine phosphorylation and marked for degradation by the Skp1/Cul1/beta-TrCP ubiquitin ligase complex. Activation of catenin-dependent signaling regulates genes involved in cell-cycle regulation and proliferation such as Ccnd1 and Myc, but also Spp1, Socs2, P2ry14, and many others (Nygren et al., 2007Nygren M.K. Dosen G. Hystad M.E. Stubberud H. Funderud S. Rian E. Wnt3A activates canonical Wnt signalling in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) cells and inhibits the proliferation of B-ALL cell lines.Br. J. Haematol. 2007; 136: 400-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In noncanonical signaling, Fzds associate with either Ryk or Ror receptor tyrosine kinases to activate calmodulin/Ca2+-, or Rho-dependent responses, which, in turn, activate Nfat or the Jun-dependent AP-1 complex, respectively. These pathways regulate a different set of Wnt targets, such as Pparg and Pcdh8 (Takada et al., 2007Takada I. Suzawa M. Matsumoto K. Kato S. Suppression of PPAR transactivation switches cell fate of bone marrow stem cells from adipocytes into osteoblasts.Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 2007; 1116: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Also, there is crosstalk between noncanonical and canonical pathways, as Ca2+-dependent signals inhibits catenin stability through Camk2-mediated activation of Nemo-like kinase (Nlk) and subsequent phosphorylation of catenin (Ishitani et al., 2003Ishitani T. Kishida S. Hyodo-Miura J. Ueno N. Yasuda J. Waterman M. Shibuya H. Moon R.T. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. The TAK1-NLK mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade functions in the Wnt-5a/Ca(2+) pathway to antagonize Wnt/beta-catenin signaling.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Knowledge about specificity of Fzds and Wnts for canonical or noncanonical pathways is limited. To complicate matters, there is a range of different Wnt-signaling inhibitors, such as Dkk, Wif or Sfrp, or other Wnt antagonists, such as Kremen, Ctgf, Cyr61, Sost, and Sostdc1. Paradoxically, some of these directly stimulate certain Fzds independent of Wnt factors. For instance, Sfrp1 directly activates Fzd2 (Rodriguez et al., 2005Rodriguez J. Esteve P. Weinl C. Ruiz J.M. Fermin Y. Trousse F. Dwivedy A. Holt C. Bovolenta P. SFRP1 regulates the growth of retinal ganglion cell axons through the Fz2 receptor.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 1301-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), as well as Fzd4 and Fzd7 (Dufourcq et al., 2008Dufourcq P. Leroux L. Ezan J. Descamps B. Lamaziere J.M. Costet P. Basoni C. Moreau C. Deutsch U. Couffinhal T. et al.Regulation of endothelial cell cytoskeletal reorganization by a secreted frizzled-related protein-1 and frizzled 4- and frizzled 7-dependent pathway: role in neovessel formation.Am. J. Pathol. 2008; 172: 37-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Also, Wnt factors have been suggested to initiate Fzd-independent signaling events. For instance, Wnt5a activates Fzd-independent signaling through both Ror (Fukuda et al., 2008Fukuda T. Chen L. Endo T. Tang L. Lu D. Castro J.E. Widhopf 2nd, G.F. Rassenti L.Z. Cantwell M.J.

Cell Biol. 2006; 38: 2011-2017Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Definitive HSCs emerge from the AGM region between E10 and E11. During this midgestational transition, a significant upregulation of β-catenin (Ctnnb1) is observed (Orelio and Dzierzak, 2003Orelio C. Dzierzak E. Identification of 2 novel genes developmentally regulated in the mouse aorta-gonad-mesonephros region.Blood. 2003; 101: 2246-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In addition, overexpression of Ctnnb1 results in expansion of the HSC pool, but, at the same time, to loss of myelopoiesis (Kirstetter et al., 2006Kirstetter P. Anderson K. Porse B.T. Jacobsen S.E. Nerlov C. Activation of the canonical Wnt pathway leads to loss of hematopoietic stem cell repopulation and multilineage differentiation block.Nat.

Surprisingly, conditional deletion of Ctnnb1 or both Ctnnb1 and plakoglobin does not affect the repopulating ability of HSCs (Cobas et al., 2004Cobas M. Wilson A. Ernst B. Mancini S.J. MacDonald H.R.

Taken together, these results suggest that canonical Wnt signaling may be important in definitive hematopoietic specification, and that catenin stabilization inhibits differentiation and/or lineage commitment. Noncanonical Wnt signaling has also been shown to play a role in hematopoiesis. Current evidence suggests that this pathway is important in the establishment of the niche by promoting trabecular bone formation and enlarging endosteal surfaces (reviewed by Yin and Li, 2006Yin T. Li L. The stem cell niches in bone.J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 1195-1201https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI28568Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar), as well as regulating cell cycle of HSCs and more mature progenitors. Wnt5a, the principal noncanonical stimulator, was shown to maintain HSCs (Murdoch et al., 2003Murdoch B. Chadwick K. Martin M. Shojaei F. Shah K.V. Gallacher L. Moon R.T. Bhatia M. Wnt-5A augments repopulating capacity and primitive hematopoietic development of human blood stem cells in vivo.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Wnt5a inhibits canonical Wnt signaling in hematopoietic stem cells and enhances repopulation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 15436-15441Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Also, the noncanonical intermediate Camk2 is essential for myeloid proliferation (Si and Collins, 2008Si J. Collins S.J. Activated Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIgamma is a critical regulator of myeloid leukemia cell proliferation.Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 3733-3742Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These results show that noncanonical signaling may be important in the control of HSC behavior. Furthermore, the decrease of Ctnnb1 after Wnt5a stimulation suggests that noncanonical signaling is a natural downregulator of canonical signaling. In addition to this intrinsic role of Wnt signaling, there is also a role for extrinsic Wnt regulation. For instance, Wnt3a stimulates proliferation and inhibits differentiation in cocultures of marrow cells with stromal cells (Yamane et al., 2001Yamane T. Kunisada T. Tsukamoto H. Yamazaki H. Niwa H. Takada S. Hayashi S.I. Wnt signaling regulates hemopoiesis through stromal cells.J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 765-772PubMed Google Scholar). More interestingly, recently, it was shown that wild-type HSCs show increased cell cycling when transplanted into mice transgenic for the canonical inhibitor Dkk1, while at the same time, the HSC pool is gradually lost (Fleming et al., 2008Fleming H.E. Janzen V. Lo Celso C. Guo J. Leahy K.M. Kronenberg H.M. Scadden D.T. Wnt signaling in the niche enforces hematopoietic stem cell quiescence and is necessary to preserve self-renewal in vivo.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 2: 274-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Further extrinsic effects were demonstrated in experiments where stromal cells deficient in Nlk were shown to be defective in maintaining hematopoietic progenitors (Kortenjann et al., 2001Kortenjann M. Nehls M. Smith A.J. Carsetti R. Schuler J. Kohler G. Boehm T. Abnormal bone marrow stromal in mice deficient for nemo-like kinase, Nlk.Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 3580-3587Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We have isolated a large panel of stromal cell clones from which two cell lines, EL08-1D2 and UG26-1B6, maintain both fetal and adult HSCs (Oostendorp et al., 2002Oostendorp R.A.J. Harvey K.N. Kusadasi N. de Bruijn M.F. Saris C. Ploemacher R.E. Medvinsky A.L. Dzierzak E.A.

Long-term maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells does not require contact with embryo-derived stromal cells in cocultures.Stem Cells. 2005; 23: 842-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Comparison of gene expression in these two cell lines with a panel of nonsupporting stromal cell lines revealed a number of overrepresented secreted molecules, including Secreted frizzled-related protein 2 (Sfrp2) (Oostendorp et al., 2005Oostendorp R.A.J. Robin C. Steinhoff C. Marz S. Bräuer R. Nuber U.A. Dzierzak E.A. Peschel C. Long-term maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells does not require contact with embryo-derived stromal cells in cocultures.Stem Cells. 2005; 23: 842-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Here we additionally identify Secreted frizzled-related protein 1 (Sfrp1), a secreted 37kDa protein that inhibits canonical Wnt signaling (Kawano and Kypta, 2003Kawano Y. Kypta R. Secreted antagonists of the Wnt signalling pathway.J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2627-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar) and interacts with Wnts 1, -2, -3a, and -7b, as a factor upregulated in both supportive stromal cell lines. Our study shows that Sfrp1 regulates production of clonogenic cells and long-term HSC maintenance through an extrinsic signaling mechanism. Sfrp1, one of the secreted-type of Wnt signaling modulators, was shown to be expressed by bone-lining osteoblast-like cells (Yokota et al., 2008Yokota T. Oritani K. Garrett K.P. Kouro T. Nishida M. Takahashi I. Ichii M. Satoh Y. Kincade P.W. Kanakura Y. Soluble frizzled-related protein 1 is estrogen inducible in bone marrow stromal cells and suppresses the earliest events in lymphopoiesis.J.

Res. 2004; 19: 1873-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and to inhibit trabecular bone formation in adult mice (Bodine et al., 2004Bodine P.V. Zhao W. Kharode Y.P. Bex F.J. Lambert A.J. Goad M.B. Gaur T. Stein G.S. Lian J.B. Komm B.S. The Wnt antagonist secreted frizzled-related protein-1 is a negative regulator of trabecular bone formation in adult mice.Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1222-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). In hematopoietic malignancies, Sfrp1 acts as a putative tumor suppressor molecule (Huang et al., 2007Huang J. Zhang Y.L. Teng X.M. Lin Y. Zheng D.L. Yang P.Y. Han Z.G. Down-regulation of SFRP1 as a putative tumor suppressor gene can contribute to human hepatocellular carcinoma.BMC Cancer. 2007; 7: 126Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We found that Sfrp1 is upregulated in embryo-derived stromal cells UG26-1B6 (2.2% of Rpl13a) and EL08-1D2 (31.8% of Rpl13a), known to support HSCs in non-contact cultures when compared to cell lines not capable of HSC maintenance (0.6% of Rpl13a in a 1:1:1 mixture of UG15-1B7, EL28-1B3, and AM30-3F4), (Oostendorp et al., 2002Oostendorp R.A.J. Harvey K.N. Kusadasi N. de Bruijn M.F. Saris C. Ploemacher R.E. Medvinsky A.L. Dzierzak E.A. Stromal cell lines from mouse aorta-gonads-mesonephros subregions are potent supporters of hematopoietic stem cell activity.Blood. 2002; 99: 1183-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A). In order to investigate the role of Sfrp1 in the maintenance of HSCs, we established a stable knockdown of Sfrp1 of 80% (0.4% of Rpl13a) in the HSC-supportive UG26-1B6 stromal cell line (Figure 1B), which correlates well to the level expressed by the mix of nonsupportive stroma cell lines. Irradiated knockdown stromal cells (shSfrp1) or control cells (pLKO.1) were cocultured with the lineage negative (Lin−) fraction of total bone marrow (BM) cells from control mice in a direct-contact manner. Interestingly, Lin− cells cultured on the shSfrp1 UG26-1B6 generated more colonies compared to the Lin− cells cultured on the control clone (Figure 1C), suggesting that lack of microenvironmental Sfrp1 promotes hematopoietic progenitor activity in vitro. To find out how Sfrp1 affects hematopoiesis, we decided to study the mice deficient in Sfrp1 (Satoh et al., 2006Satoh W. Gotoh T. Tsunematsu Y. Aizawa S. Shimono A. Sfrp1 and Sfrp2 regulate anteroposterior axis elongation and somite segmentation during mouse embryogenesis.Development. 2006; 133: 989-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The knockout mice were originally generated on the 129 background and were paired at least 5 generations with 129B6 background. In contrast to the old Sfrp-deficient mice studied by others (Bodine et al., 2004Bodine P.V. Zhao W. Kharode Y.P. Bex F.J. Lambert A.J. Goad M.B. Gaur T. Stein G.S. Lian J.B. Komm B.S. The Wnt antagonist secreted frizzled-related protein-1 is a negative regulator of trabecular bone formation in adult mice.Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1222-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), the present study revealed no gross differences in the extension of the growth plates, but a slight increase in chondrocytes of 10-week-old Sfrp1−/− mice compared to their controls (Figure S1). As a first experiment, we investigated the capacity of primary Sfrp1−/− stroma to maintain hematopoiesis using cocultures with Lin- negative cells; the results were in full accordance with the above findings with the knockdown stromal cell line UG26-1B6 (Figures 1B and 1C). Interestingly, the increased production of colony-forming cells was completely abolished when the cultures were supplemented by cell-free conditioned medium (CM) from wild-type (Sfrp1+/+) stroma, indicating that an Sfrp1-dependent soluble factor was the cause of the increase in hematopoietic progenitors (Figure 1D). However, addition of recombinant Sfrp1, in a concentration of 1 μg/ml every 3 days, to cocultures of WT Lin− cells and primary marrow stroma did not affect the generation of hematopoietic progenitors (Figure S2). This suggests that either recombinant Sfrp1 is not biologically active or that Sfrp1 does not directly act on hematopoietic progenitors. Because of the above results, we decided to characterize the hematopoiesis of Sfrp1−/− mice in more detail. The BM, spleen, and thymus cellularity was unchanged (Figure 2A), while the peripheral blood (PB) cell number was significantly increased in Sfrp1−/− mice (Figures 2A and 2B). The numbers of eosinophiles (Eos), red blood cells (RBC), hematocrit (HCT), and platelets (PLT) were within normal range (Figure 2B). The main contribution to the increased cell number in peripheral blood comes from increased B220+ B cell populations (1.4-fold) and Gr1+ cells (2.1-fold) (Figure 2C). Also notable was a slight, but significant, increase of B220+ cells in the BM and thymus, as well as a minor, but significant, decrease of both T and B lymphocytes in the spleen (Figure 2C). Taken together, these findings suggest an altered homeostasis of lymphocytes and leukocytes in the absence of Sfrp1. To find out whether these changes result from alterations in early hematopoiesis, we analyzed the primitive cell populations in multiparameter flowcytometry (Figure 3A). Numbers of Lin−, Sca1+, and Kit+ (LSK) cells were unchanged in Sfrp1−/− mice (Figure 3B). However, the number of as the more primitive Flk2 and Cd34 double-negative population of LSKs (Cd34-Flk2-LSK) (Osawa et al., 1996Osawa M. Hanada K. Hamada H. Nakauchi H.

USA. 2001; 98: 14541-14546Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar; 1.5-fold, p = 0.013 [n = 7]; Figures 3A and 3B) as well as Cd150+ Cd48- Cd34-Flk2-LSK (Wilson et al., 2008Wilson A. Laurenti E.

Further down the hematopoietic hierarchy, we found that multipotent progenitors (Lin−, Sca1−, and Kit+ MPP) were significantly reduced. This, in turn, suggested that the progenitors that make up the MPP population (common myeloid progenitors [CMPs], granulocytic progenitors [GMPs], and megakaryocytic/erythroid progenitors [MEPs]) should be reduced as well; however, we only observed a significant reduction (1.4-fold) in the MEP population (Figures 3C and 3D). Additionally, the number of common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs) in these mice also seemed reduced (1.4-fold), but due to the intraanimal variance, this difference never reached statistical significance (p = 0.12, n = 8 for both control and Sfrp1−/− groups) (Figures 3C and 3D). Functionally, the number of colony-forming cells, such as CFU-GEMM, was unchanged, but the number of CFU-GM, particularly the large CFU-GM, as well as the BFU-E, were significantly decreased (Figure 3E). Thus, loss of Sfrp1 results in a decreased progenitor cell activity. Entry of HSC into the cell cycle is regulated by the microenvironment as well as modified by intrinsic factors. Our results suggest that absence of Sfrp1 affects the production of both progenitors and mature hematopoietic cells. In order to understand which mechanisms underlie these alterations, we studied the cell-cycle status of LSKs, MPPs, and mature cells in vivo. Animals were injected with BrdU and were sacrificed 3 hours later. Bone marrow and blood cells were analyzed for hematopoietic subpopulations (Figure 4A). We found that in the bone marrow, the G0/G1 population is increased in both LSK and MPP cells from Sfrp1−/− mice. Correspondingly, a decrease of the S phase cells was observed, indicating that in Sfrp1−/− mice, LSKs (p = 0.063) and MPPs (p = 0.012) cycle less (Figure 4B). However, this cycling behavior changes from early to late hematopoiesis, as both mature myeloid Gr1+ cells as well as B B220+ cells show an expanded S phase population in the marrow (Figure 4C). The increase in S phase was not noticed in Cd4+ or Cd8a+ T cells, indicating that Sfrp1 does not affect cell cycle of T cells in the marrow (Figure 4C). In order to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying altered hematopoiesis in the absence of Sfrp1, we analyzed the expression level of several molecules that could possibly be involved. Intracellular flowcytometric analyses demonstrated that the number of cells expressing high levels of the central canonical Wnt signaling intermediate Ctnnb1 was significantly decreased in LSKs, MPPs, and CLPs of Sfrp1−/− mice compared to the control animals (Figure 5A and Figure S4). At the same time, P-Ctnnb1 was significantly decreased only in LSK cells of Sfrp1−/− compared to the wild-type controls (Figure 5A and Figure S4). In contrast, the number of cells expressing Jnk1 (Mapk8), one of the mediators of noncanonical Wnt signaling, was not altered in Sfrp1 knockout animals (Figure 5B and Figure S4). To address the more critical question of whether Ctnnb1 accumulates in the nucleus, we performed single-cell stains. These stains independently confirmed that Ctnnb1 is present at a lower level in Sfrp1−/− LSKs, MPPs, and CLPs (Figures 5C and 5D). In LSK and CLP control cells, Ctnnb1 was present in clearly visible membrane-bound forms (Figure 5C), whereas in cells derived from Sfrp1−/− bone marrow, membrane-bound Ctnnb1 appeared to be absent, resulting in a relatively high nuclear to cytoplasmic Ctnnb1 ratio, particularly in Sfrp1−/− LSK cells (Figure 5E). Thus, the difference in nuclear, cytoplasmic Ctnnb1 distribution was clearest in LSK cells (Figure 5E). To find out how the level and altered distribution of Ctnnb1 affects gene expression, we studied expression levels of “classical” downstream transcriptional targets of the catenin/Tcf/Lef pathway as well as other molecules mediating Wnt signaling: Lef1, Fzd4, and Pparg. The decreased catenin levels resulted in a significant reduced expression of both catenin targets: cyclin D1 (Ccnd1) and the Wnt inhibitor dickkopf 1 (Dkk1) in Cd34-LSK, but not MPP cells (Figure 5F and Figure S5). The expression of transcription factor Lef1, which activates target genes in complex with the nuclear Ctnnb1, was unchanged in Cd34-LSKs and MPPs of Sfrp1−/− mice (Figure 5F and Figure S5). In contrast, the expression of Pparg, which is a repressor of Wnt signaling, was significantly upregulated in MPP (Figure 5F; Figure S5). On the other hand, Fzd4 expression, which binds Sfrp1 (Dufourcq et al., 2008Dufourcq P. Leroux L. Ezan J. Descamps B. Lamaziere J.M. Costet P. Basoni C. Moreau C. Deutsch U.

Wnt signaling was shown to affect Notch pathway in HSCs (Duncan et al., 2005Duncan A.W. Rattis F.M. DiMascio L.N. Congdon K.L. Pazianos G. Zhao C. Yoon K. Cook J.M. Willert K. Gaiano N. et al.Integration of Notch and Wnt signaling in hematopoietic stem cell maintenance.Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 314-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar), and we found a significant upregulation of the Notch target gene Hes1 in Cd34-LSKs and MPPs of Sfrp1−/− mice compared to the controls (Figure 5F and Figure S5). This finding is in line with previously published results from transgenic mice overexpressing Dkk1 (Fleming et al., 2008Fleming H.E. Janzen V. Lo Celso C. Guo J. Leahy K.M. Kronenberg H.M. Scadden D.T. Wnt signaling in the niche enforces hematopoietic stem cell quiescence and is necessary to preserve self-renewal in vivo.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 2: 274-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), another repressor molecule in Wnt signaling. Also, the expression of Runx1, a downstream mediator of Notch signaling (Burns et al., 2005Burns C.E. Traver D. Mayhall E. Shepard J.L. Zon L.I. Hematopoietic stem cell fate is established by the Notch-Runx pathway.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2331-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), was significantly upregulated in MPPs and not altered in LSKs of Sfrp1−/− mice (Figure 5F and Figure S5). The NF-κB modulator Ikbkg was slightly lower expressed in Cd34-LSK cells from Sfrp1−/− mice, but unchanged in their MPPs (Figure 5F and Figure S5), suggesting possible crosstalk of NF-κB and Sfrp1 signals in the earliest hematopoietic cells. The expression levels of the transcription factor Lmo2 was unchanged in both populations of Sfrp1 knockout mice (Figure 5F and Figure S5). Taken together, these results show that the absence of Sfrp1 alters the expression of both Wnt and Notch pathway mediators and targets in both MPP and Cd34-LSK. In order to separate intrinsic from extrinsic effects caused by Sfrp1 loss, we first analyzed engraftment of Sfrp1−/− HSCs transplanted into 129Ly5.1 recipients. In addition, we performed this experiment in a limiting dilution fashion, which would also enable independent functional confirmation of phenotypical results shown in Figure 3B. These experiments showed that the number of functional HSCs is unchanged in Sfrp1−/− mice (Figure 6A). In addition, the pattern of lymphomyeloid engraftment was unchanged with regard to recipients receiving control 129B6 cells (Figure 6B and Figure S6), indicating there are no intrinsic defects in the ability of Sfrp1−/− to engraft myeloid and lymphoid lineages. In order to assess the extent of the extrinsic effect, we analyzed engraftment of wild-type Ly5.1 HSC in Sfrp1−/− and control 129Ly5.1 mice (primary transplants, 1°) (Figure 7A). Sixteen weeks after transplantation in 1° recipients, we observed a significant increase of engrafted wild-type cells in BM and PB of Sfrp1−/− mice (Figure 7B). The number of mature myeloid cells wa"

CoA is synthesized from pantothenate via five enzymatic reactions; pantothenate kinase (PanK), 4′-phosphopantothenoylcysteine synthetase (PPCS), 4′-phosphopantothenoylcysteine decarboxylase (PPCDC), 4′- phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase (PPAT), and dephospho-CoA kinase (DPCK). Although many animals rely on exogenous pantothenate to initiate CoA biosynthesis, microorganisms and plants can synthesize pantothenate from 2-oxoisovalerate and β-alanine. This is a three-step pathway catalyzed by ketopantoate hydroxymethyltransferase (KPHMT), ketopantoate reductase, and pantothenate synthetase (PS). In contrast to the wealth of knowledge on CoA biosynthesis in bacteria and eukaryotes, the corresponding pathway in the Archaea remains unclear (4Genschel U. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2004; 21: 1242-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Sequence data indicate that the bacterial PPCS and PPCDC homologs and eukaryotic PPAT homologs are found on almost all of the archaeal genomes. The archaeal PPCS and PPCDC genes are fused in many cases, and the bifunctional protein from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii has been shown to exhibit both activities (5Kupke T. Schwarz W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5435-5444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The PPAT homolog from Pyrococcus abyssi has also been studied and confirmed to exhibit the expected PPAT activity (6Armengaud J. Fernandez B. Chaumont V. Rollin-Genetet F. Finet S. Marchetti C. Myllykallio H. Vidaud C. Pellequer J.L. Gribaldo S. Forterre P. Gans P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31078-31087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Bacterial KPHMT and ketopantoate reductase homologs can also be found, to a lesser extent, on the archaeal genomes. They are not found in the methanogens and Thermoplasmatales, and the fact that the structural similarity among archaeal enzymes is not higher than that toward enzymes from hyperthermophilic bacteria suggests that the archaeal KPHMT and ketopantoate reductase are a result of horizontal gene transfer from bacteria (4Genschel U. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2004; 21: 1242-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In addition, there are candidate genes distantly related to bacterial/eukaryotic DPCK. However, PS homologs are not found in any of the archaeal genomes, and PanK homologs are found only in a few exceptional cases. Recently, Genschel and co-workers have taken a comparative genomics approach to predict the genes corresponding to the archaeal PS and PanK genes, and have also described the identification of a structurally novel PS from Methanosarcina mazei (4Genschel U. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2004; 21: 1242-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 7Ronconi S. Jonczyk R. Genschel U. FEBS J. 2008; 275: 2754-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In this study, we describe the identification of the enzymes responsible for the conversion of pantoate to 4′-phosphopantothenate in Thermococcus kodakaraensis. The organism is a hyperthermophilic archaeon isolated from Kodakara Island, Japan (8Morikawa M. Izawa Y. Rashid N. Hoaki T. Imanaka T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 4559-4566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Atomi H. Fukui T. Kanai T. Morikawa M. Imanaka T. Archaea. 2004; 1: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The complete genome sequence is available (10Fukui T. Atomi H. Kanai T. Matsumi R. Fujiwara S. Imanaka T. Genome Res. 2005; 15: 352-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), and gene disruption systems have been developed (11Sato T. Fukui T. Atomi H. Imanaka T. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 210-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 12Sato T. Fukui T. Atomi H. Imanaka T. Appl. Environ.

Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 2683-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To our surprise, the conversion of pantoate to 4′-phosphopantothenate in T. kodakaraensis is not brought about by the two classic enzyme reactions catalyzed by PS and PanK, but by two novel enzyme reactions; phosphorylation of pantoate (pantoate kinase) followed by the condensation of 4-phosphopantoate and β-alanine (4′-phosphopantothenate synthetase or 4-phosphopantoate:β-alanine ligase). Homologs of these two genes are distributed on almost all of the archaeal genomes, suggesting that the Archaea utilize different chemistry in the conversion from pantoate to 4′-phosphopantothenate. The strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in supplemental Table S1. T. kodakaraensis KOD1 and its derivatives were cultivated under strictly anaerobic conditions at 85 °C in a nutrient-rich medium (ASW-YT) or a synthetic medium (ASW-AA). ASW-YT medium (pH 6.6) was composed of 0.8× artificial seawater (0.8× ASW), 5.0 g liter−1 of yeast extract, and 5.0 g liter−1 of Tryptone. Sodium pyruvate (5 g liter−1) or elemental sulfur (2 g liter−1) was supplemented prior to inoculation. ASW-AA medium consisted of 0.8× ASW, a mixture of 20 amino acids, modified Wolfe's trace minerals, a vitamin mixture, and 2.0 g liter−1 of elemental sulfur (11Sato T. Fukui T. Atomi H. Imanaka T. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 210-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 14Robb F.T. Place A.R. Archaea: A Laboratory Manual, thermophiles.in: Robb F.T. Place A.R. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1995: 167-168Google Scholar). Solid media used to isolate transformants were based on ASW-YT medium containing 1.0 g liter−1 of gelrite and 0.4 g liter−1 of polysulfide. Specific modifications of the medium to select and investigate the auxotrophy of individual mutant strains are described in the respective sections. When examining the effects of adding 4′-phosphopantothenate to the medium, 4′-phosphopantothenate was enzymatically synthesized (37 °C, 90 min) in a reaction mixture (30 ml) containing 12 mm pantothenate, 13 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, and 3.6 μm Ec-PanK in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The volume of the reaction mixture added was 10% (v/v) of that of the medium. Escherichia coli strains DH5α and BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL, used for plasmid construction and heterologous gene expression, respectively, were cultivated at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium containing ampicillin (100 mg liter−1). Unless mentioned otherwise, all chemicals were purchased from Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan) or Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan). Plasmids for gene expression of TK0939, TK1473, TK1686, TK2141, and TK2242 in E. coli were constructed as follows. The coding region of each gene was amplified from the genomic DNA of T. kodakaraensis KOD1 by PCR using the primer sets TK0939EF/ER, TK1473EF/ER, TK1686EF/ER, TK2141EF/ER, and TK2242EF/ER for TK0939, TK1473, TK1686, TK2141, and TK2242, respectively (supplemental Table S2). Using the NdeI-EcoRI or NdeI-BamHI restriction enzyme sites incorporated during the PCR, the fragments were inserted into the pET21a(+) expression vector (Novagen). After confirming the absence of unintended mutations, the plasmids were introduced into E. coli strain BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL. The transformants were cultivated at 37 °C in LB medium with ampicillin until the optical density at 660 nm reached ∼0.5. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm to induce overexpression, and cells were incubated for a further 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5), and disrupted by sonication. After centrifugation (20,000 × g, 15 min), the soluble cell extract was heat treated for 10 or 15 min at 70 or 80 °C, and thermolabile proteins derived from the host were removed by centrifugation (20,000 × g, 15 min). The supernatants were used for initial examination of enzyme activity. The recombinant TK1686 protein produced in E. coli and the TK2141 protein produced in T. kodakaraensis (see below) were further purified by anion-exchange chromatography with HiTrap Q HP 5 ml (Amersham Biosciences), and the recombinant proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of KCl (0 to 1.0 m) in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) at a flow rate of 0.4 ml min−1. For TK1686, protein fractions were combined and concentrated using Amicon Ultra-4 10K (Millipore) and were further applied to a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) with a mobile phase of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 100 mm KCl at a flow rate of 0.3 ml min−1. The molecular mass of native TK1686 protein and TK2141 protein were determined from a calibration curve constructed with the standard proteins thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), albumin (67.0 kDa), ovalbumin (43.0 kDa), and chymotrypsinogen A (25.0 kDa). Protein concentration was determined with the Protein Assay System (Bio-Rad), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Genes whose expression did not lead to soluble proteins in E. coli (TK0939 and TK2141) were expressed in T. kodakaraensis (supplemental Fig. S1). Recombination in T. kodakaraensis was designed so that the individual genes would be fused downstream of the cell surface glycoprotein gene (csg, TK0895) promoter. The csg promoter corresponds to a 200-bp region of the 5′-flanking region of the TK0895 gene. Because TK0939 is the first gene of a putative TK0939-TK0940 operon, we inserted the csg promoter upstream of the original TK0939 gene locus. A His tag sequence was incorporated in the N terminus of TK0939 for use in purification. On the other hand, the TK2141 gene is located in the middle of a putative TK2140-TK2142 operon. We thus constructed a csg promoter/TK2141 gene cassette and inserted the cassette into another region of the genome, which originally harbors the chitinase-encoding chiA gene (TK1765). A His tag was also added at the N terminus of TK2141. pUD3, which contains the pyrF marker gene cassette inserted in the ApaI site of pUC118, was used to construct individual plasmids. For the TK0939 gene, the coding region along with a 1000-bp region of the TK0939 5′-flanking region was amplified from genomic DNA with the primer set TK0939TF1/TR1, digested with BamHI, and inserted into the BamHI site of pUD3. Inverse PCR of this plasmid with the primer set TK0939TF2/TR2 was performed so that a His tag sequence was incorporated after the initiation codon. The primer set PcsgF1/R was used to amplify the csg promoter region from genomic DNA, with the initiation codon of TK0939 and the His tag sequence present at the 3′-terminal region. The fragments amplified by TK0939TF2/TR2 and PcsgF1/R were mixed for fusion PCR. The obtained fragment was self-ligated to complete the promoter exchange plasmid. For TK2141, the coding region was amplified from genomic DNA with the primer set TK2141TF/TR, incorporating a His tag sequence after the initiation codon. chiATF1/TR1 was used to amplify a 1000-bp region of the 3′-flanking region of the chitinase-encoding chiA gene (TK1765). Fusion PCR was performed so that the His tag TK2141 gene was placed upstream of the TK1765 3′-flanking region (fragment 1). Fragments amplified with chiATF2/TR2 (TK1765 5′-flanking region) and PcsgF2/R (csg promoter) were fused (fragment 2). The NdeI-BamHI-digested fragment 1, the EcoRI-NdeI-digested fragment 2, and the EcoRI-BamHI-digested pUD3 were ligated to complete the plasmid. T. kodakaraensis strain KUW1 (ΔpyrFΔtrpE) (12Sato T. Fukui T. Atomi H. Imanaka T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71: 3889-3899Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), was used as the host strain for genetic manipulation. Transformation of KUW1 was performed as follows. Cells at the late log phase were harvested, resuspended in 200 μl of 0.8× ASW, and kept on ice for 30 min. After treatment with 3.0 μg of the plasmid and further incubation on ice for 1 h, the cells were cultivated in ASW-AA medium for 24 h at 85 °C. Cells were consecutively cultivated under the same conditions to enrich the desired transformants that display uracil prototrophy, followed by cultivation in ASW-YT medium for 12 h at 85 °C. The cells grown in ASW-YT medium were harvested, diluted with 0.8× ASW, and spread onto solid medium supplemented with 10 g liter−1 of 5-fluoroorotic acid and 60 mm NaOH. Only cells that have undergone a pop-out recombination that removes the pyrF gene can grow in the presence of 5-fluoroorotic acid. Cells were grown for 2 days at 85 °C for colony formation. After incubation, genotypes of the isolated transformants were analyzed by PCR with the primer set PcsgF1/TK0939TR1 for the TK0939 overexpression strain (ETK0939) and PcsgF1/TK2141TR for the TK2141 overexpression strain (ETK2141) (supplemental Table S2). Transformants whose amplified DNA products displayed the expected size were chosen, and relevant sequences were confirmed to have no unintended mutations. The TK0939 and TK2141 overexpression strains were cultivated in ASW-YT medium with 5 g liter−1 sodium pyruvate for 12 h at 85 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.5 m KCl and 40 mm imidazole, and sonicated. After centrifugation (20,000 × g, 15 min), the supernatant was applied onto His GraviTrap (Amersham Biosciences), and the His tag proteins were eluted with elution buffer (20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 0.5 m KCl, and 0.5 m imidazole). After exchanging the elution buffer to Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) with Amicon Ultra-4 10K (Millipore), the collected fractions were used for initial examination of activity. PanK activity was measured with HPLC or by coupling the PanK reaction with pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase (PK/LDH). In the HPLC method, reactions were performed at 75 °C. The reaction mixture contained 4 mm d-pantothenic acid (Sigma), 4 mm ATP (Oriental Yeast, Tokyo, Japan), 10 mm MgCl2, in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), with cell-free extract (∼100 μg ml−1) or various amounts of recombinant protein. MgCl2 and Tris-HCl were first incubated at 75 °C for 2 min, and, after adding and mixing the other reagents, the reaction mixture was further incubated at 75 °C. The reaction was started by adding the protein sample and stopped by adding 20 μl of 1 m HCl and cooling on ice. After incubation on ice for 30 min, proteins in the reaction mixture were removed by ultrafiltration using Microcon Ultracel YM-10 (Millipore). An aliquot (10 μl) of this solution was applied to a Synergi 4u Hydro-RP 80A 150 × 4.60 mm (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) column using an LC-VP system (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Compounds were eluted with a solution of 20 mm KH2PO4 plus 0.1% hexane sulfonate adjusted to pH 3.0 by phosphoric acid and 1.5% (v/v) acetonitrile at a flow rate of 1.0 ml min−1. Absorbance at 210 nm was measured. For measurements using PK/LDH, the PanK reaction was either carried out prior to the PK/LDH reaction (80 °C) or simultaneously (42 °C). When the PanK and PK/LDH reactions were carried out separately, the initial reaction mixture was identical to that described for HPLC analysis. After the reaction, samples were put on ice for 30 min, and proteins were removed as described above. An aliquot (100 μl) was added to the second reaction mixture (1 ml) containing 0.2 mm NADH (Oriental Yeast), 5 mm potassium phosphoenolpyruvate, 14.8 units ml−1/18.6 units ml−1 of PK/LDH from rabbit muscle (Sigma), 10 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). MgCl2 and Tris-HCl were first incubated at 37 °C for 2 min, and, after adding the other components, the decrease in absorption at 340 nm was measured by using a spectrophotometer at 37 °C. The millimolar absorbance coefficient (ϵ340 nm = 6.22) of NADH was used to quantify the ADP formed in the first reaction. The amount of NADH that decreased after adding an aliquot of the first reaction without pantothenate was subtracted from each assay result. When the PanK and PK/LDH reactions were carried out simultaneously, the reaction mixture contained 5 mm ATP, 5 mm of pantothenate, 0.2 mm NADH, 5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 14.8 units ml−1/18.6 units ml−1 of PK/LDH, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 6.8 μg ml−1 of recombinant TK2141 protein. After preincubating MgCl2 and Tris-HCl at 42 °C for 2 min, other reagents were added, and the rate of decrease in absorption at 340 nm was measured. The reaction was initiated with the addition of ATP. Pantoate kinase activity was measured with the same methods, except that d-pantothenic acid was replaced with d-pantoic acid. d-Pantoic acid was obtained by hydrolyzing d-pantolactone in 400 mm KOH at 90 °C for 1 h. For kinetic examination of TK2141, kinetic parameters for pantothenate and pantoate were examined in the presence of 5 mm ATP, whereas those for ATP were examined in the presence of 5 mm pantoate. The reaction mixture for examining PS activity contained 4 mm d-pantoate, 4 mm β-alanine (Sigma), 4 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2 in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and recombinant TK1686 protein (17 μg ml−1). MgCl2 and Tris-HCl buffer were incubated at 75 °C for 2 min, and, after adding the other reagents, the reaction mixture was incubated at 75 °C. The reaction was started by adding ATP and stopped by adding 20 μl of 1 m HCl and cooling on ice for 30 min. Proteins were removed by ultrafiltration using Microcon Ultracel YM-10, and 10-μl aliquots were applied to a COSMOSIL 5C18-PAQ 250 × 4.60 mm column (Nacalai Tesque). Compounds were separated with 50 mm NaH2PO4 at a flow rate 1.0 ml min−1. Absorbance at 210 nm was measured. Phosphopantothenate synthetase activity was measured with the same methods, except that the substrate 4-phosphopantoate was supplied by the pantoate kinase activity of the recombinant TK2141 protein. The pantoate kinase reaction was performed either prior to or together with the phosphopantothenate synthetase reaction. In the latter case, recombinant TK2141 (11 μg) was added to the reaction mixture described for the examination of PS activity. When the pantoate kinase reaction was carried out separately, the first reaction mixture was identical to that used for examining pantothenate kinase activity by HPLC, except that pantothenate was replaced by pantoate. After removing proteins, an aliquot (100 μl) was added to the second reaction mixture identical to that described for the examination of PS activity, but without pantoate. Gene disruption plasmids for TK1686 and TK2141 were constructed by first amplifying the genes along with 1000 bp of their 5′- and 3′-flanking regions using the primer sets TK1686DF1/DR1 and TK2141DF1/DR1. After digesting with BamHI, the fragments were inserted into the BamHI site of pUD3. Inverse PCR was performed with TK1686DF2/DR2 and TK2141DF2/DR2 to remove the respective coding regions, and the amplified fragment was self-ligated. The proper sequences of the 5′- and 3′-flanking regions of each gene were confirmed. The plasmids were introduced into T. kodakaraensis KUW1 as described above. PCR analyses of transformants were performed with the primer sets TK1686CF/CR (TK1686 gene disruptant) and TK2141CF/CR (TK2141 gene disruptant). The loci of candidate strains were sequenced to confirm gene disruption. We first examined whether T. kodakaraensis was able to synthesize CoA de novo. Cells were grown in a synthetic ASW-AA medium, including salts, trace minerals, amino acids, elemental sulfur, and trace vitamins but excluding pantothenate. Cell growth was consistently observed in the synthetic medium during three rounds of cultivation, indicating that T. kodakaraensis cells harbor the ability to synthesize CoA. In terms of T. kodakaraensis, homologs with high similarity to the bacterial KPHMT, ketopantoate reductase, PPCS, and PPCDC and the eukaryotic PPAT are present on the genome. In addition, two candidate genes that are distantly related to the bacterial/eukaryotic DPCK can also be identified. As in the case of the majority of the archaea, genes structurally related to PS and PanK genes are not present on the T. kodakaraensis genome. We have previously encountered numerous cases in which structurally novel, archaea-specific proteins replace the functions of proteins homologous to previously characterized enzymes from bacteria and eukaryotes (15Rashid N.

We thus examined the presence of ATP-dependent PanK activity in the cell-free extracts of T. kodakaraensis cells. Activity was first measured by coupling the generation of ADP with the PK/LDH enzyme system. No notable levels of activity could be detected. We next examined activity by monitoring the generation of 4′-phosphopantothenate with HPLC. For use as a standard compound, 4′-phosphopantothenate was synthesized enzymatically with PanK from E. coli (Ec-PanK). The Ec-PanK gene was amplified from E. coli genomic DNA and expressed with the pET21a(+)/E. coli BL21(DE3)CodonPlus RIL system. A His tag sequence was introduced in the N terminus region, and the enzyme was purified with a nickel affinity column. Incubation of Ec-PanK with ATP and pantothenate led to increases in a peak corresponding to ADP (retention time: 1.4–1.5 min) and another peak corresponding to 4′-phosphopantothenate with a retention time of 1.9–2.0 min using a Synergi 4u Hydro-RP 80A column. When we examined the cell-free extract of T. kodakaraensis for PanK activity, a peak corresponding to 4′-phosphopantothenate could not be detected. In addition, pantothenate consumption was not observed, suggesting that activity levels, if any, were trace. As we could not detect sufficient levels of ATP-dependent pantothenate kinase (PanK) activity in the cell-free extracts of T. kodakaraensis, we took a comparative genomics approach to identify candidate genes that might encode a structurally novel PanK. Among the 51 genes annotated as putative kinases on the T. kodakaraensis genome (10Fukui T. Atomi H. Kanai T. Matsumi R. Fujiwara S. Imanaka T. Genome Res. 2005; 15: 352-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), we were able to identify ten kinase genes that were widely distributed in the archaeal genomes and whose specific functions could not be predicted. Among these, only four were specific to the Archaea, and thus selected for further examination; TK0939 (predicted archaeal sugar kinase), TK1473 (predicted archaeal kinase), TK2141 (predicted archaeal sugar kinase), and TK2242 (predicted archaeal sugar kinase). TK0939, TK2141, and TK2242 are members of the galacto-/homoserine/mevalonate/phosphomevalonate kinase family (19Bork P. Sander C. Valencia A. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The TK0939, TK1473, TK2141, and TK2242 genes were individually inserted into pET21a(+) and expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)CodonPlus RIL. Soluble proteins were obtained for TK1473 and TK2242. The two proteins were partially purified by heat treatment and examined for PanK activity by HPLC. When recombinant TK1473 and TK2242 proteins were incubated in the presence of ATP and pantothenate"
https://openalex.org/W2160788420,"Domain interaction, a structural property of apolipoprotein E4 (apoE4), is predicted to contribute to the association of apoE4 with Alzheimer disease. Arg-61 apoE mice, a gene-targeted mouse model specific for domain interaction, have lower brain apoE levels and synaptic, functional, and cognitive deficits. We hypothesized that domain interaction elicits an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in astrocytes and an unfolded protein response that targets Arg-61 apoE for degradation. Primary Arg-61 apoE astrocytes had less intracellular apoE than wild-type astrocytes, and unfolded protein response markers OASIS (old astrocyte specifically induced substance), ATF4, and XBP-1 and downstream effectors were up-regulated. ER stress appears to cause global astrocyte dysfunction as glucose uptake was decreased in Arg-61 apoE astrocytes, and astrocyte-conditioned medium promoted neurite outgrowth less efficiently than wild-type medium in Neuro-2a cell cultures. We showed age-dependent up-regulation of brain OASIS levels and processing in Arg-61 apoE mice. ER stress and astrocyte dysfunction represent a new paradigm underlying the association of apoE4 with neurodegeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2017071197,"The extracellular sulfatases Sulf1 and Sulf2 remodel the 6O-sulfation state of heparan sulfate proteoglycans on the cell surface, thereby modulating growth factor signaling. Different from all other sulfatases, the Sulfs contain a unique, positively charged hydrophilic domain (HD) of about 320 amino acid residues. Using various HD deletion mutants and glutathione S-transferase (GST)-HD fusion proteins, this study demonstrates that the HD is required for enzymatic activity and acts as a high affinity heparin/heparan sulfate interaction domain. Association of the HD with the cell surface is sensitive to heparinase treatment, underlining specificity toward heparan sulfate chains. Correspondingly, isolated GST-HD binds strongly to both heparin and heparan sulfate in vitro and also to living cells. Surface plasmon resonance studies indicate nanomolar affinity of GST-HD toward immobilized heparin. The comparison of different mutants reveals that especially the outer regions of the HD mediate heparan sulfate binding, probably involving “tandem” interactions. Interestingly, binding to heparan sulfate depends on the presence of 6O-sulfate substrate groups, suggesting that substrate turnover facilitates release of the enzyme from its substrate. Deletion of the inner, less conserved region of the HD drastically increases Sulf1 secretion without affecting enzymatic activity or substrate specificity, thus providing a tool for the in vitro modulation of HS-dependent signaling as demonstrated here for the signal transduction of fibroblast growth factor 2. Taken together, the present study shows that specific regions of the HD influence different aspects of HS binding, cellular localization, and enzyme function.

The human sulfatases represent a family of 17 enzymes responsible for the turnover and remodeling of sulfate esters and sulfamates. Their reaction mechanism relies on a special amino acid residue, Cα-formylglycine, which is generated post-translationally via oxidation of a conserved cysteine residue in the active site (1Dierks T.

The corresponding double knock-out mice display an obvious reduction in body weight and developmental malformations, including skeletal and renal defects (18Ai X. Kitazawa T. Do A.T.

Together with biochemical analyses on the impact of Sulf loss on HS sulfation, the phenotypic observations suggest a functional cooperativity between Sulf1 and Sulf2 in modulating the 6O-sulfation of UA(2S)-GlcNS(6S) disaccharide units within the S-domains of HS chains (17Lamanna W.C.

Moreover, analyses of heparan sulfate disaccharide compositions from Sulf1 and Sulf2 knock-out mice cell lines have indicated dynamic influences of Sulf loss also on non-substrate N-, 2O-, and 6O-sulfate groups via modulation of sulfotransferase expression, which may contribute to the developmental defects associated with the Sulf knock-out mice (24Lamanna W.C. Frese M.A. Balleininger M. Dierks T. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 27724-27735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar).From the biochemical perspective, it is an important question how the Sulfs are able to recognize their HSPG substrates and how cell surface localization is achieved, despite a lack of transmembrane domains or lipid anchors. Classical GAG-binding proteins, such as antithrombin III (25Li W. Johnson D.J. Esmon C.T. Huntington J.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 857-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) or FGF1 (26Pellegrini L. Burke D.F. von Delft F. Mulloy B. Blundell T.L. Nature. 2000; 407: 1029-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar), interact with their negatively charged GAG partners via small clusters of positively charged amino acid residues. Although some consensus sequences for heparin binding have been identified (XBBXBX, XBBBXXBX, and XBBXXBBBXXBBX, where B is a basic residue and X a hydropathic) (27Cardin A.D. Weintraub H.J. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 21-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Sobel M. Soler D.F. Kermode J.C. Harris R.B. J. Biol.

BioEssays. 1998; 20: 156-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar), they are neither required nor sufficient. Unlike these classical GAG-binding proteins, Sulf1 and Sulf2 contain a large hydrophilic domain (HD), located between the N-terminal catalytic domain and the C-terminal domain. The HD is a unique feature of the extracellular sulfatases that is neither found in other sulfatases nor shows any homology with other known protein domains. According to sequence alignments, the HD of human Sulf1 has a size of ∼320 amino acid residues, 27% of which are basic and 14% acidic, resulting in a strong positive charge at neutral pH and a high theoretical pI of 9.8. Remarkably, the C-terminal end of the HD is composed of a cluster of 12 basic amino acid residues. Whereas the outer regions of the HD are highly conserved between Sulf1 and Sulf2 as well as between human, murine, and avian orthologs, the inner region, encoded by exons 13 and 14 in the case of human Sulf1 (6Morimoto-Tomita M. Uchimura K. Werb Z. Hemmerich S. Rosen S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49175-49185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), is significantly less conserved.The role of the HD has previously been investigated for the avian ortholog QSulf2 (30Ai X.

Results from this study indicated that the HD binds to negatively charged ligands and might serve to anchor the enzyme on the cell surface. Sulfate release assays indicated the necessity of the avian HD for enzymatic activity. Moreover, a very recent analysis of the HD of human Sulf1/Sulf2 revealed the presence of two furin-type proteinase cleavage sites within the inner region, explaining their partial processing into disulfide-linked subunits of 75 and 50 kDa (31Tang R. Rosen S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 21505-21514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Sulf1/2 mutants, in which these sites were deleted, retained enzymatic activity but failed to potentiate Wnt signaling when overexpressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells.Due to the observed differences in enzyme secretion and detergent solubility between the human and avian orthologs (24Lamanna W.C.

Emerson Jr., C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4969-4976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and the likely importance of this domain for mammalian Sulf localization and activity, we analyzed the function of the HD of human Sulf1 in mediating enzyme activity, cell surface targeting, secretion, and substrate recognition. Using different Sulf1 deletion mutants and glutathione S-transferase (GST)-HD fusion proteins, this study demonstrates that specific regions of the HD, especially at the conserved N and C termini, are responsible for heparin/HS binding, cell surface localization, and enzymatic activity of human Sulf1. Interaction analyses show that binding of the HD to heparin is significantly stronger compared with other typical heparin-binding proteins, suggesting a new mode of GAG binding. The deletion of the inner region of the HD leads to significantly increased secretion of the enzyme, allowing the purification of an active variant that is able to modulate FGF signaling in cell culture experiments.DISCUSSIONEditing of 6O-sulfation of cell surface HSPGs represents a novel mechanism by which the signal transduction pathways of various growth factors and morphogens can be modulated. How the two endosulfatases Sulf1 and Sulf2 recognize their HS substrates and how membrane targeting is achieved are critical questions for understanding their function in cell signaling processes. The present study demonstrates that the HD and distinct regions thereof have important functions in mediating high affinity GAG binding and enzyme activity.The HD Is a Novel Heparin/HS-binding Domain That Interacts in a 6O-Sulfate-dependent MannerDeletion of the HD of Sulf1 strongly reduces the cell surface localization of Sulf1 and leads to increased secretion of the enzyme into the medium. Taken together, the results from the deletion mutants underline that the HD and especially the outer regions are essential for cell surface targeting. For direct or indirect attachment to the cell membrane, several potential interaction partners have to be considered, including different classes of proteoglycans, other proteins, and also negatively charged phospholipids. As shown by FACS experiments with heparinase-treated fibroblasts, the HD of human Sulf1 preferentially binds to heparan sulfate chains, indicating that the HD mediates interactions with the HS chains of HSPGs, the substrate of Sulf1 and Sulf2. These findings contradict previous reports on QSulf1, which had either excluded HS as an interaction partner (5Dhoot G.K. Gustafsson M.K. Ai X. Sun W. Standiford D.M. Emerson Jr., C.P. Science. 2001; 293: 1663-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) or assumed non-selective binding of the HD to negatively charged GAGs (30Ai X. Do A.T. Kusche-Gullberg M. Lindahl U. Lu K. Emerson Jr., C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4969-4976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar).To compare the heparin/HS binding properties of the HD with other GAG-binding proteins, heparin affinity chromatography was employed, using immobilized heparin as a matrix and gradient elution with increasing concentrations of NaCl. In previous studies, typical heparin-binding proteins, such as thrombin, antithrombin III, and heparin cofactor II, exhibited elution peaks at 470, 760, or 220 mm NaCl, respectively (40Eckert R. Ragg H. FEBS Lett. 2003; 541: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In contrast, binding of GST-HD was significantly stronger with elution peaks at >1000 mm NaCl, similar to the affinity of FGF1 (41Klagsbrun M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1990; 2: 857-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Combined with the data from surface plasmon resonance experiments, indicating stable complex formation between the HD and heparin with nanomolar affinity, these results imply that the HD represents a novel high affinity heparin/HS-binding domain that localizes the enzyme close to the 6O-sulfate substrate groups.Yet, the Sulfs also need to be released from their substrate to fulfill their function at the cell surface. We could show that the binding of GST-HD to HS was almost completely abrogated after treatment of HS with enzymatically active Sulf1ΔHDC. This result indicates that the binding of GST-HD specifically depends on the 6O-sulfated substrate disaccharides, i.e. UA(2S)-GlcNS(6S) and UA-GlcNS(6S) (24Lamanna W.C. Frese M.A. Balleininger M. Dierks T. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 27724-27735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and that dissociation and mobility of Sulf1 are promoted by substrate turnover. This would allow the enzyme to reach other proteoglycan substrates at the cell surface and also in the extracellular matrix.Due to the large size of the HD, it seems likely that multiple contacts to adjacent or more distant sites are required for a stable interaction with heparin/HS. Based on the analysis of the different deletion mutants, the inner region of the HD, encoded by the less conserved exons 13 and 14, appears not to be involved in GAG binding. As seen for Sulf1ΔHDC, the loss of the inner region does not affect the cell surface localization. Consistent with these data, the GST-HDC fusion protein exhibited high affinity toward heparan sulfate, heparin, and mammalian cell surfaces. Compared with GST-HD, the increased affinity of GST-HDC toward heparin and especially HS might be explained by a hypothetical model in which the N- and C-terminal regions of the HD contain at least two independent GAG-binding sites, which come into close contact upon deletion of the HD inner region. This proximity could allow binding of the protein within the same S-domain of HS, whereas the presence of the inner region in GST-HD might result in orientation of the binding sites where only one site can interact with one S-domain (Fig. 8). This model would also explain why the observed differences in binding efficiencies were less prominent with homogeneously sulfated heparin as the binding partner. In the case of full-length Sulf1, the inner region might have structural importance to regulate HS affinity or to enable “tandem” interactions of the HD outer regions with two different GAG chains simultaneously.Biochemical Properties of Sulf1 with and without HDUsing different Sulf1 deletion mutants, the role of the HD in enzymatic activity was investigated. Enzyme assays with the physiological substrate, HS, as well as with the pseudosubstrate 4-MUS demonstrate that the HD of Sulf1 is required for enzyme function, corresponding to previous reports on QSulf2 (30Ai X. Do A.T. Kusche-Gullberg M. Lindahl U. Lu K. Emerson Jr., C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4969-4976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). A deletion of the inner region of the HD does not affect activity or substrate specificity toward HS or 4-MUS. In contrast, the loss of the entire HD leads to a reduced activity toward 4-MUS, whereas activity is completely lost against HS, supporting recent results also from Sulf2 (31Tang R. Rosen S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 21505-21514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings support a model in which the HS chain is first bound by the HD to neutralize its negative charge and then presented to the active site for efficient catalysis (30Ai X. Do A.T. Kusche-Gullberg M. Lindahl U. Lu K. Emerson Jr., C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4969-4976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The small pseudosubstrate 4-MUS might simply diffuse into the active site and thus does not require the presence of the HD. In this context, the sulfate-induced activation of Sulf1ΔHDC toward 4-MUS, but not toward HS as a substrate, might indicate that the sulfate ions are able to occupy binding sites within the HD, mimicking the HS chain and leading to neutralization of the positive charge and subsequent conformational changes. Also the basic cluster at the C-terminal end of the HD appears to be essential for Sulf1 activity, as deletion of this cluster represents the only difference between Sulf1ΔHD (inactive) and Sulf1ΔHDB (active). Finally, it was shown for the first time that deletion of large parts of the HD does not alter HS substrate specificity of Sulf1. In both active mutants Sulf1ΔHDB and Sulf1ΔHDC, the trisulfated UA(2S)-GlcNS(6S) unit was the preferred substrate group within HS chains, confirming that the selection of specific positions is mediated by the active site rather then by the HD.PerspectivesBased on its high activity in vitro and significantly increased secretion, the Sulf1ΔHDC variant allowed the biochemical and kinetic characterization of heparin and heparan sulfate desulfation. Furthermore, this mutant opens up new possibilities to obtain larger amounts of functional enzyme, which will be useful for further applications such as cell culture-based assays, also in comparison to Sulf2 (12Uchimura K. Morimoto-Tomita M. Bistrup A. Li J. Lyon M. Gallagher J. Werb Z. Rosen S.D. BMC Biochem. 2006; 7: 2Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The general applicability of Sulf1ΔHDC has been demonstrated by the reduction of the FGF signaling response after incubation of Sulf1/Sulf2 double-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts with Sulf1ΔHDC. This assay suggests that the purified protein will be helpful to study also other growth factor signaling pathways dependent on heparan sulfate 6O-sulfate groups. Interestingly, it has recently been shown that deletion of the furin cleavage sites within the HD of Sulf1 and Sulf2 renders both enzymes unable to activate Wnt signaling (31Tang R. Rosen S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 21505-21514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This finding was attributed to the reduced localization of the uncleavable Sulf mutants into lipid rafts. In contrast to Wnt signaling, we show here that Sulf1ΔHDC, a mutant lacking both furin cleavage sites due to the deletion of the inner region of the HD, is able to modulate FGF2 signal transduction. This difference is likely due to the highly soluble nature of exogenous Sulf1ΔHDC, which might allow the enzyme to freely access raft and non-raft located proteoglycans on the cell surface. In addition to its ability to modulate cell signaling, Sulf1ΔHDC will serve as an important tool for further research investigating the role of 6O-sulfate groups. 6O-Desulfated HS material, generated by Sulf1ΔHDC treatment, can be used for example, in surface plasmon resonance studies to explicitly investigate the role of substrate sulfates in binding of the HD. Protein crystallography of the isolated HD in complex with defined HS oligosaccharides will help to further understand the role of the HD with regard to substrate recognition and enzyme mechanism. Moreover, structural analysis of the HD will also contribute to a more detailed understanding of how the analog code of HS sulfation is recognized and deciphered by proteins at the molecular level. The human sulfatases represent a family of 17 enzymes responsible for the turnover and remodeling of sulfate esters and sulfamates. Their reaction mechanism relies on a special amino acid residue, Cα-formylglycine, which is generated post-translationally via oxidation of a conserved cysteine residue in the active site (1Dierks T.

https://openalex.org/W2152929735,"Lysosomal neuraminidase-1 (NEU1) forms a multienzyme complex with β-galactosidase and protective protein/cathepsin A (PPCA). Because of its association with PPCA, which acts as a molecular chaperone, NEU1 is transported to the lysosomal compartment, catalytically activated, and stabilized. However, the mode(s) of association between these two proteins both en route to the lysosome and in the multienzyme complex has remained elusive. Here, we have analyzed the hydrodynamic properties of PPCA, NEU1, and a complex of the two proteins and identified multiple binding sites on both proteins. One of these sites on NEU1 that is involved in binding to PPCA can also bind to other NEU1 molecules, albeit with lower affinity. Therefore, in the absence of PPCA, as in the lysosomal storage disease galactosialidosis, NEU1 self-associates into chain-like oligomers. Binding of PPCA can reverse self-association of NEU1 by causing the disassembly of NEU1-oligomers and the formation of a PPCA-NEU1 heterodimeric complex. The identification of binding sites between the two proteins allowed us to create innovative structural models of the NEU1 oligomer and the PPCA-NEU1 heterodimeric complex. The proposed mechanism of interaction between NEU1 and its accessory protein PPCA provides a rationale for the secondary deficiency of NEU1 in galactosialidosis. Lysosomal neuraminidase-1 (NEU1) forms a multienzyme complex with β-galactosidase and protective protein/cathepsin A (PPCA). Because of its association with PPCA, which acts as a molecular chaperone, NEU1 is transported to the lysosomal compartment, catalytically activated, and stabilized. However, the mode(s) of association between these two proteins both en route to the lysosome and in the multienzyme complex has remained elusive. Here, we have analyzed the hydrodynamic properties of PPCA, NEU1, and a complex of the two proteins and identified multiple binding sites on both proteins. One of these sites on NEU1 that is involved in binding to PPCA can also bind to other NEU1 molecules, albeit with lower affinity. Therefore, in the absence of PPCA, as in the lysosomal storage disease galactosialidosis, NEU1 self-associates into chain-like oligomers. Binding of PPCA can reverse self-association of NEU1 by causing the disassembly of NEU1-oligomers and the formation of a PPCA-NEU1 heterodimeric complex. The identification of binding sites between the two proteins allowed us to create innovative structural models of the NEU1 oligomer and the PPCA-NEU1 heterodimeric complex. The proposed mechanism of interaction between NEU1 and its accessory protein PPCA provides a rationale for the secondary deficiency of NEU1 in galactosialidosis.

NEU1 initiates the intralysosomal hydrolysis of sialo-oligosaccharides, -glycolipids, and -glycoproteins by removing their terminal sialic acid residues. In human and murine tissues, NEU1 forms a complex with at least two other proteins, β-galactosidase and the protective protein/cathepsin A (PPCA) (22d'Azzo A. Andria G. Strisciuglio P. Galjaard H.

By virtue of their association with PPCA, NEU1 and β-galactosidase acquire their active and stable conformation in lysosomes. However, PPCA appears to function as a crucial chaperone/transport protein for NEU1. Because NEU1 is poorly mannose 6-phosphorylated, it depends on PPCA for correct compartmentalization and catalytic activation in lysosomes (23van der Spoel A. Bonten E. d'Azzo A.

Only a small amount of PPCA and β-galactosidase activities is found in the NEU1-PPCA-β-galactosidase complex, which instead contains all of the NEU1 catalytic activity (24van der Spoel A.

By understanding how and when NEU1 and PPCA interact, how they regulate each other in different cell types, and what determinants control their association, we may gain important insight into their significance in physiologic and pathologic conditions. The absence of NEU1 is associated with two neurodegenerative diseases that involve glycoprotein metabolism; sialidosis, which is caused by structural lesions in the lysosomal NEU1 locus (28Thomas G.H. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease.in: Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. 8th Ed. McGraw Hill, Inc., New York2001: 3507-3534Google Scholar), and galactosialidosis (GS), a combined deficiency of NEU1 and β-galactosidase which is caused by the absence of PPCA (22d'Azzo A. Andria G.

Patients with sialidosis and those with GS have similar clinical and biochemical features, and both diseases are characterized by multiple phenotypes that are classified according to the age of onset and severity of the symptoms. Previously, we generated two animal models of primary or secondary NEU1 deficiency, Neu1−/− mice and Ppca−/− mice. Both mouse models have a profound loss of Neu1 activity in multiple tissues and develop clinical, biochemical, and pathologic manifestations resembling those seen in patients with severe sialidosis and GS (29Zhou X.Y.

Neu1−/− mice are phenotypically similar but not identical to Ppca−/− mice and, like children with the disease, exhibit a time-dependent splenomegaly associated with extramedullary hematopoiesis (30de Geest N. Bonten E. Mann L. de Sousa-Hitzler J. Hahn C. d'Azzo A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 1455-1464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Yogalingam G. Bonten E.J. van de Vlekkert D. Hu H. Moshiach S. Connell S.A. d'Azzo A. Dev. Cell. 2008; 15: 74-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We found that the cause of these phenotypic abnormalities is the gradual loss of retention of hematopoietic progenitors within the bone niche due to exacerbated lysosomal exocytosis of bone marrow cells. The latter process is negatively regulated by NEU1 activity (31Yogalingam G. Bonten E.J. van de Vlekkert D. Hu H. Moshiach S. Connell S.A. d'Azzo A. Dev. Cell. 2008; 15: 74-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The mode of interaction between PPCA and NEU1 and the mechanism of catalytic activation are not well understood. Here we present biochemical, analytical, and structural analyses of NEU1, PPCA, and the PPCA-NEU1 complex by using purified baculovirus (BV)-expressed wild-type and mutagenized recombinant enzymes and synthetic peptides. Fibroblasts from a patient with early infantile galactosialidosis were deposited in the European Cell Bank (Rotterdam, The Netherlands). Fibroblasts were maintained in culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin) at 37 °C (5% CO2). Macrophages were isolated from the bone marrow of Ppca-null mice as previously described (32Bonten E.J. Wang D. Toy J.N. Mann L. Mignardot A. Yogalingam G. d'Azzo A. FASEB J. 2004; 9: 971-973Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Antibodies against NEU1 and PPCA were produced and affinity-purified as described previously (32Bonten E.J. Wang D. Toy J.N. Mann L. Mignardot A. Yogalingam G. d'Azzo A. FASEB J. 2004; 9: 971-973Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). PPCA and NEU1 were expressed in insect cells and purified to near homogeneity as previously described (32Bonten E.J. Wang D. Toy J.N. Mann L. Mignardot A. Yogalingam G. d'Azzo A. FASEB J. 2004; 9: 971-973Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 33Wang D. Bonten E.J. Yogalingam G. Mann L. d'Azzo A. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2005; 85: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Wild-type Ppca and Neu1 cDNA constructs have been previously described (4Bonten E. van der Spoel A. Fornerod M. Grosveld G. d'Azzo A. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3156-3169Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 34Galjart N.J. Gillemans N. Harris A. van der Horst G.T. Verheijen F.W. Galjaard H. d'Azzo A. Cell. 1988; 54: 755-764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Ppca cDNA was in vitro mutagenized to introduce the following single amino acid substitutions: R20A, A251E, L354D, K355Q, W382A, and P451A. To generate the cDNA mutants, we performed two rounds of PCR using Ppca oligonucleotide primers with specific nucleotide mutations encoding each of the PPCA amino acid substitutions. The nucleotide exchanges were confirmed by automated sequence analysis. Wild-type and mutant Ppca and Neu1 cDNAs were subcloned into the 5′ internal ribosomal entry sequence (IRES) of the MSCV-IRES-GFP retroviral vector, and retroviruses were generated and expressed in human fibroblasts as previously described (35Wang D. Zaitsev S. Taylor G. d'Azzo A. Bonten E.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1790: 275-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Retrovirally transduced fibroblasts were harvested and lysed in water containing Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). NEU1 catalytic activity was measured using the synthetic substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-α-d-N-acetylneuraminic acid as described earlier (36Galjaard H. Ann. Clin. Biochem. 1979; 16: 343-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), and total protein concentration was measured using the BCA assay and bovine serum albumin as a standard (Pierce). Cell lysate samples were resolved on 12.5% polyacrylamide gels under denaturing conditions, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and incubated with anti-NEU1 and/or anti-PPCA affinity-purified antibodies and peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). NEU1 and PPCA were visualized using Western Lightning Chemiluminescence Reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Fluorescence-sorted retrovirally transduced GFP+ fibroblasts were seeded directly onto Superfrost/Plus microscope glass slides (Fisher) at about 60% confluence. One day later the slides were processed according to the method of van Dongen et al. (37van Dongen J.M. Willemsen R. Ginns E.I. Sips H.J. Tager J.M. Barranger J.A. Reuser A.J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 39: 179-189PubMed Google Scholar) by using affinity-purified anti-NEU1 antibody and cyanine 3-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). The stained slides were examined using a fluorescence microscope as described earlier (4Bonten E. van der Spoel A. Fornerod M. Grosveld G. d'Azzo A. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3156-3169Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Purified BV-NEU1 (1 mg/ml) in 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.0, 100 mm NaCl) was adsorbed to carbon-coated grids, negatively stained with 1% aqueous uranyl acetate, and imaged with a Phillips 301 electron microscope operated at 60 kV. Purified insect cell-expressed recombinant NEU1 and PPCA (mature and precursor forms) were separately dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7) or 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.0, 100 mm NaCl). NEU1 and PPCA (pH 5 or 7) were mixed at ∼1:1 (8 μg each) to a 1:7 ratio (8 and 56 μg, respectively) in either 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 5, 100 mm NaCl) or 50 mm MES (pH 6.5, 100 mm NaCl) in a total volume of 100 μl per sample. The protein samples were incubated for 24 h at 4 °C, room temperature, or 37 °C, after which the neuraminidase activity was measured as described above. The denatured and reduced proteins were resolved on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and stained with 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue (w/v) in 40% methanol, 10% acetic acid (v/v). A panel of 72 sequential 15-mer NEU1 peptides (4Bonten E. van der Spoel A. Fornerod M. Grosveld G. d'Azzo A. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3156-3169Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) and 88 sequential 15-mer PPCA peptides (34Galjart N.J. Gillemans N. Harris A. van der Horst G.T. Verheijen F.W. Galjaard H. d'Azzo A. Cell. 1988; 54: 755-764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), each overlapping with the following peptide by 10 residues, were synthesized using an Advanced Chemtech 396 synthesizer. The N-terminal signal peptides of NEU1 and PPCA were not included in the peptide synthesis. The peptide amides were synthesized on 4-hydroxymethylphenoxyacetyl-4′-methylbenzyhydrylamine-amide resin (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA), and the Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) amino acids were coupled using 1-hydroxybenzotriazole/2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate chemistries. N-terminal acetylation was performed using acetic anhydride and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole. Peptides were cleaved from the resin in 91% trifluoroacetic acid containing 2% phenol, 2% ethanedithiol, and 5% thioanisole. The peptides were precipitated and washed twice with diethyl ether. Peptide concentrations for CD and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) were determined using quantitative amino acid analysis. Binding studies were performed using a Biacore 3000 surface plasmon resonance instrument (GE Healthcare). Purified insect cell-expressed PPCA and NEU1 proteins were covalently attached to a CM-5 chip (Biacore) using standard amine coupling methods in 10 mm sodium acetate at pH 5.5. The remaining reactive sites were blocked with ethanolamine. A reference cell was prepared similarly in the absence of protein. Binding of NEU1, PPCA, or NEU1 synthetic 15-mer peptides was measured by flowing protein or peptides in 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% surfactant P20 (HBS-EP buffer, Biacore) at 20 μl/min in sequence through the reference and protein-containing flow cells at 25 °C. The pH of the HBS-EP buffer was adjusted with 1 m HCl for each pH tested. Synthetic peptides were at a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml, and sample and system buffers were supplemented with 500 mm NaCl, 5% DMSO, and 10 mg/ml dextran sulfate 10 to improve peptide solubility and reduce background binding. The system and sample-diluting buffers were set at the pH being tested. A blank containing only HBS-EP buffer at the appropriate pH was also run. Regeneration of the chip surface to remove bound protein or peptides consisted of two 500-μl injections of HBS-EP buffer at pH 7.4. The flow cells were maintained at 25 °C. Data reported are the maximum differences in SPR signal between the flow cells containing coupled protein and the reference cells. Any contribution of the HBS-EP buffer to the signal was removed by subtracting the blank (HBS-EP buffer) injection from the reference-subtracted signal. The binding level was determined as the maximum signal in the binding phase. Because of the extremes of pH used in these studies, some loss of binding capacity was observed between injections, amounting to ∼1% loss of binding per injection. For measurements of binding levels for pH titration and peptide binding studies, the top value at the end of the binding phase was used as the binding value. Data analysis was done using software and kinetic models supplied with the Biacore 3000 instrument. Purified insect cell-expressed NEU1 and PPCA were dialyzed against the ultracentrifugation buffers, 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5, or phosphate-buffered saline, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.0, and subjected to sedimentation velocity in a ProteomeLab XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge with an eight-hole Beckman An-50 rotor and cells containing sapphire windows and charcoal-filled Epon double-sector center pieces (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). The buffer dialysate was used as optical reference. The loading volume of ∼400 μl was identical for the reference and sample chambers of the double-sector centerpiece, and the final loading protein concentrations were 1.8 to 0.15 mg/ml. The density and viscosity of the ultracentrifugation buffers at 4 °C were calculated from their respective compositions, and the partial specific volume at 4 °C, and molecular weights of the proteins were calculated based on the amino acid composition using the software SEDNTERP (38Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science.in: Harding S. Rowe A. Horton J. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1992Google Scholar). After equilibration at 4 °C at rest, the rotor was accelerated to 50,000 rpm and fringe-displacement data at time intervals of 1.0 min were collected with the Rayleigh interference system for 10 h and analyzed with SEDFIT software using the model for continuous sedimentation coefficient distribution c(s) with deconvolution of diffusion effects (39Schuck P.

The positions of the meniscus and bottom as well as time-invariant and radial noises were fitted. A two-dimensional size-shape distribution, c(s, f/f0) (with the first dimension the s distribution and the second the f/f0 distribution) was also calculated with an equidistant f/f0 grid of 0.1 steps that varied from 1.0 to 2.8, a linear s-grid that varied from 0.5 to 15 S, and Tikhonov-Phillips regularization (41Brown P.H. Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2006; 90: 4651-4661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). The distributions were transformed to c(s,Mr) and c(s,f/f0) distributions, where Mr is the molecular weight, f/f0 is the frictional ratio, and s is the sedimentation coefficient, and plotted as contour plots. This analysis was with regularization. The dotted lines of the c(s,Mr) distribution plots indicate lines of constant f/f0. The distributions were not normalized (41Brown P.H. Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2006; 90: 4651-4661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). A structural model of human NEU1 was generated using the comparative method (42Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10456) Google Scholar). Initial modeling was performed using the fold-recognition program LOOPP (43Teodorescu O. Galor T. Pillardy J. Elber R.

Subsequently, an atomic model was generated using MODELLER, Version 9v4 (46Martí-Renom M.A. Stuart A.C. Fiser A. Sánchez R. Melo F. Sali A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol.

Data obtained from the surface plasmon resonance peptide scanning from both NEU1 and PPCA sides were used to build the structural models of the NEU1 oligomer and the PPCA-NEU1 complex. Two templates were used to model the structure of the PPCA-NEU1 heterodimeric complex with 1:1 molar ratio; 1) computer-generated model of human NEU1 and 2) crystallographic structure of the precursor PPCA monomer, PDB code 1IVY (48Rudenko G.

After visualization of the contacts and preliminary analysis of the surface interactions with the computer graphics program COOT (49Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23040) Google Scholar), several three-dimensional models were suggested based on the optimal packing of the individual monomers. Attempts were undertaken to discriminate between various models using the protein-protein docking servers ClusPro (50Comeau S.R. Gatchell D.W. Vajda S. Camacho C.J. Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar), RosettaDock (51Gray J.J. Moughon S. Wang C. Schueler-Furman O. Kuhlman B. Rohl C.A. Baker D. J. Mol.

NEU1 gains full catalytic activity in the lysosome through its binding to PPCA and assembly within the multienzyme complex, which most likely triggers conformational changes essential for catalysis. The timing of the proteolytic processing of the 54-kDa PPCA zymogen into the mature two-chain, 32/20-kDa enzyme remains unknown, as does whether this process is a prerequisite for activation of the 46-kDa NEU1. No mutations have been identified that prevent the proteolytic processing and activation of PPCA. Instead, all patients with GS present with deficiencies in cathepsin A and NEU1. To better understand the mechanism of NEU1 activation, we examined the ability of purified precursor PPCA and mature PPCA to activate NEU1 in solution. At pH 6.5 and 5.0, we added increasing quantities of PPCA to a constant amount of NEU1, in ratios of 1:0.7 to 1:7, to assess the effect on NEU1 activity. To analyze whether time or temperature was important for catalytic activation, we incubated the samples for 1 or 24 h at room temperature or 37 °C and then assayed NEU1 activity. Increasing amounts of bovine serum albumin added to NEU1 as a control had no effect on the enzyme activity (not shown). At pH 6.5, NEU1 activity increased with the PPCA concentration independent of time, temperature, and whether the precursor or mature PPCA form was present, except that incubation with mature PPCA for 24 h at 37 °C resulted in overall lower NEU1 activity (Fig. 1, A and B). At pH 5, a similar temperature-independent increase in NEU1 activity was measured after 1 h of incubation with either form of PPCA (Fig. 1, C and D), but the addition of mature PPCA followed by 24 h of incubation at 37 °C led to a steady decline in NEU1 activity (Fig. 1D). SDS-PAGE analysis showed the increasing appearance of a degradation product (∼36 kDa) in NEU1 samples that had been mixed with an equal amount of mature PPCA and incubated at 37 °C for 1 or 24 h (Fig. 1E). These results may explain the relatively short half-life of endogenous NEU1 in mammalian cells maintained in culture (23van der Spoel A. Bonten E. d'Azzo A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1588-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and suggest that mature PPCA may trigger the inactivation and degradation of this protein. The mode of interaction between PPCA and NEU1 and the sites of their binding are unknown. To identify amino acid residues on the PPCA precursor that bind NEU1, we took advantage of the tertiary structure of PPCA (55Rudenko G. Bonten E. Hol W.G. d'Azzo A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 621-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We assumed that the solvent-accessible surface of the PPCA structure, as calculated by GRASP (48Rudenko G. Bonten E. d'Azzo A.

We created single amino acid mutations of surface residues that are conserved in human and mouse PPCA but not in other nonmammalian members of the serine carboxypeptidase family that have no protective function toward other prot"

It has been proposed that Top1 cleavage complexes arrest advancing replication forks, triggering the formation of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) because of replication fork runoff at the Top1 cleavage complex sites on the leading strand. In this study, we show that the formation of replication-dependent DSBs requires the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in CPT-treated cells. First, the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 specifically inhibited CPT-induced but not ionizing radiation- or hydroxyurea-induced DSBs as revealed by both the neutral comet assay and measurements of the specific DNA damage signals (e.g. γ-H2AX, phosphorylated ataxia telangiectasia mutated (Ser-1981), and phosphorylated Chk2 (Ser-33/35)) that are characteristic for DSBs. Knocking down the 20 S proteasome maturation protein also supported the requirement of the proteasome activity for CPT-induced DSBs. Second, CPT-induced DSB signals were shown to require ubiquitin, ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), a CUL-3-based ubiquitin ligase (E3), and the formation of Lys-48-linked polyubiquitin chains on Top1. Third, immunocytochemical studies revealed that the CPT-induced formation of γ-H2AX foci occurred at the replication forks and was attenuated by co-treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132.

Anticancer camptothecins (CPTs) as well as various structurally perturbed DNAs (e.g. UV adducts, abasic sites, base mismatches, uracil incorporation, nicks and gaps, and oxidized DNA lesions) are known to stabilize reversible Top1-DNA covalent complexes, often referred to as Top1 cleavage complexes (reviewed in Refs. 3Li T.K.

Top1 cleavage complexes, in addition to their rapid reversibility, are also characterized by Top1-concealed single strand breaks (SSBs) (6Hsiang Y.H. Hertzberg R. Hecht S. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14873-14878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as their denaturation by SDS or alkali in vitro exposes Top1-linked SSBs in which Top1 molecules are covalently linked to the 3′ phosphoryl ends of SSBs through their active-site tyrosine (6Hsiang Y.H.

It is well established that Top1 cleavage complexes are responsible for the antitumor activity of CPTs (3Li T.K. Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

The unique nature of Top1 cleavage complexes has led to the proposal that their interactions with cellular machineries (e.g. DNA replication and transcription processes) are needed for the exposure of the Top1-concealed strand breaks in cells (8Desai S.D.

Consistent with this notion, a robust transcription- and proteasome-dependent mechanism for the intracellular processing of Top1 cleavage complexes into SSBs has been demonstrated (8Desai S.D. Zhang H. Rodriguez-Bauman A. Yang J.M. Wu X. Gounder M.K. Rubin E.H. Liu L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2341-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that Top1 cleavage complexes arrest elongating RNA polymerases, triggering proteasomal degradation of Top1 (termed Top1 down-regulation) and the concomitant exposure of the Top1-concealed SSBs for repair (8Desai S.D. Zhang H. Rodriguez-Bauman A. Yang J.M. Wu X. Gounder M.K. Rubin E.H. Liu L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2341-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The role of active DNA replication in the processing of Top1 cleavage complexes into DNA damage is initially suggested based on the observation that CPTs are exquisitely cytotoxic to S phase cells and simultaneous/transient arrest of DNA synthesis abolishes CPT cytotoxicity (12D'Arpa P. Beardmore C. Liu L.F. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6919-6924PubMed Google Scholar, 13Holm C. Covey J.M. Kerrigan D. Pommier Y. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 6365-6368PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the CPT-induced aberrant replication intermediates in the SV40 cell-free replication system has led to the suggestion of a replication fork collision model (9Hsiang Y.H. Lihou M.G. Liu L.F. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5077-5082PubMed Google Scholar, 11Tsao Y.P. Russo A. Nyamuswa G. Silber R. Liu L.F. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5908-5914PubMed Google Scholar). Results from replication runoff studies in HT29 cells and genetic studies in yeast (10Strumberg D. Pilon A.A. Smith M. Hickey R. Malkas L. Pommier Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3977-3987Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 14Nitiss J.L. Wang J.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1095-1102PubMed Google Scholar, 15Reid R.J. Fiorani P. Sugawara M. Bjornsti M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 11440-11445Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) also support such a conclusion. In this model, the reversible Top1 cleavage complexes arrest the advancing replication fork, resulting in the formation of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) and Top1-DNA cross-links at the collision sites (9Hsiang Y.H. Lihou M.G. Liu L.F. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5077-5082PubMed Google Scholar, 11Tsao Y.P. Russo A. Nyamuswa G. Silber R. Liu L.F. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5908-5914PubMed Google Scholar, 16Zhang H. D'Arpa P. Liu L.F. Cancer Cells. 1990; 2: 23-27PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this proposed model, many DNA damage signals, such as phosphorylated RPA2, ATM, Chk1, Chk2, p53, NF-κB, and H2AX (γ-H2AX), are detected upon CPT treatment and most of them are replication-dependent (5Pommier Y. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 789-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (1629) Google Scholar). Implicit in the replication fork collision model is that the formation of DSBs at the replication forks occurs as a consequence of replication fork runoff on the leading strand of DNA synthesis (10Strumberg D. Pilon A.A. Smith M. Hickey R. Malkas L. Pommier Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3977-3987Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Consequently, the processing of Top1 cleavage complexes is not predicted to be necessary for DSB formation as it is for transcription-dependent SSB formation. In this study, we provide evidence showing that the formation of DSBs at the arrested replication forks is dependent on the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, which involves a CUL-3-based E3 ligase and the formation of Lys-48-linked polyubiquitin chains. These results are most consistent with a modified replication fork collision model in which Top1 cleavage complexes at the arrested replication forks are degraded by proteasome prior to the replication runoff on the leading strand to generate DSBs. Antibodies against Mrell (Upstate), PRA2 (Oncogene), γ-H2AX (Upstate), Ser(P)-15-p53 (Cell Signaling), Ser(P)-33/35-Chk2 (Cell Signaling), Chk1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and Ser(P)-345-Chk1 (Cell Signaling) were purchased from commercial sources. Anti-Top1 antibodies were obtained from sera of scleroderma 70 patients as described before (17Desai S.D. Liu L.F. Vazquez-Abad D. D'Arpa P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24159-24164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The hybridoma cell line that produces monoclonal antibody 12G10 (α-tubulin) was obtained from Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank. The siRNAs targeting POMP (ID SAS1-Hso1-00010430) and CUL-3 (ID SAS1-Hso1-00042272) were purchased from Sigma. Ubiquitin isopeptidase inhibitor I (G5) was purchased from Calbiochem. HeLa Tet-On (Clontech) and HT29 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FetalPlex animal serum complex (Gemini Bio-Products, West Sacramento, CA), l-glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. ZR-75-1 stable cell lines that express control, ISG15, or UbcH8 shRNAs (18Desai S.D. Wood L.M. Tsai Y.C. Hsieh T.S. Marks J.R. Scott G.L. Giovanella B.C. Liu L.F. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2008; 7: 1430-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) were cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FetalPlex animal serum complex, l-glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. Mouse leukemic cell lines Fm3A and Ts85 (ubiquitin E1 Ts mutant) were cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FetalPlex animal serum complex, l-glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) in a 30 °C incubator with 5% CO2. The comet assays were performed according to the Trevigen CometAssayTM kit protocol with slight modifications. Cells were pretreated with various inhibitors for 30 min, followed by co-treatment with 25 μm CPT for 1 h. Treated cells were trypsinized with 0.005% trypsin (50× lower than the normal concentration) at 37 °C for 5 min. An equal amount of drug-free medium (with 10% serum) was then added to quench the trypsin activity. The final cell density was about 10,000 cells/ml. 50 μl of the cell suspension was then mixed with 500 μl of 0.5% low melting point agarose (in PBS) (Invitrogen) at 37 °C. 50 μl of the cell/agarose mixture was transferred onto glass slides. Slides were then immersed in pre-chilled lysis buffer (2.5 m NaCl, 100 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 10.0, 1% Triton X-100, and 10% DMSO) for 1 h, followed by electrophoresis in 1× TBE buffer at 0.8 V/cm for 8–10 min at room temperature. After electrophoresis, slides were dehydrated in 70% alcohol for 30 min and air-dried overnight. Cells were then rehydrated in H2O and stained with 0.2 μg/ml ethidium bromide for 1 h. Images were visualized under a fluorescence microscope and captured with a CCD camera. The comet tail moment was determined as described (19Lyu Y.L. Kerrigan J.E. Lin C.P. Azarova A.M. Tsai Y.C. Ban Y. Liu L.F. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 8839-8846Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). The means ± S.E. were obtained from at least 100 cells for each treatment group. Statistical analysis was performed using two-tailed unpaired Student's t test. For overexpression of dominant-negative ubiquitin (K48R-Ub) or HA-tagged ubiquitin (HA-Ub), cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids (obtained from Dr. Cam Patterson, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill) 24 h prior to CPT treatment using PolyFect transfection reagent (Qiagen). For transfection of siRNAs, 250 pmol of siRNAs were transfected into cells (50% confluent on a 60-mm plate) using Oligofectamine transfection reagent (Invitrogen). After 48 h, transfected cells were split for further experiments. CPT-induced Top1 degradation was monitored by immunoblotting of the alkaline lysates as described previously (8Desai S.D. Zhang H. Rodriguez-Bauman A. Yang J.M. Wu X. Gounder M.K. Rubin E.H. Liu L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2341-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) with slight modification. Briefly, for each 35-mm dish, 100 μl of an alkaline lysis buffer (200 mm NaOH, 2 mm EDTA) was added, and cells were then scraped with a rubber policeman. Alkaline lysates were neutralized by addition of 16 μl of 1 m HCl, 600 mm Tris, pH 8.0, followed by mixing with 13 μl of 10× S7 nuclease buffer (50 mm MgCl2, 50 mm CaCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and a protease inhibitor mixture) and 60 units of staphylococcal S7 nuclease (20Mao Y. Desai S.D. Ting C.Y. Hwang J. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40652-40658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The digestion was performed on ice for 20 min for releasing Top1 from covalent Top1-DNA complexes. After nuclease digestion, 100 μl of 6× SDS gel sample buffer was added, followed by boiling for 10 min. The samples were then analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted with anti-hTop1 antibody. Immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (21Desai S.D. Li T.K. Rodriguez-Bauman A. Rubin E.H. Liu L.F. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5926-5932PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed with 400 μl of an alkaline lysis buffer, followed by neutralization with 75 μl of a neutralization buffer (described in Top1 down-regulation assay) with brief sonication. 60 μl of 10× S7 buffer was then added to the cell lysates, followed by S7 nuclease treatment (180 units). Top1 were immunoprecipitated by Top1 antiserum and protein l-conjugated agarose beads. Immunostaining of BrdUrd and γ-H2AX was performed according to the previous study (22Seiler J.A. Conti C. Syed A. Aladjem M.I. Pommier Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 5806-5818Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) with slight modification. Briefly, after 45 min of pulse-labeling with 50 μm BrdUrd in the presence of 1 μm CPT for the last 30 min, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, followed by a PBS wash, and incubated with methanol for 15 min at −20 °C. Cells were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h, followed by incubation with mouse anti-γ-H2AX monoclonal antibody in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 2 h at room temperature. After two PBS washes, cells were incubated with Cy2-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch), followed by three PBS washes and 4% formaldehyde fixation for 10 min. Cells were incubated with 1.5 n HCl for 10 min at 37 °C to denature the DNA. After two PBS washes, cells were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min, followed by staining with Alexa Fluor 488 mouse anti-BrdUrd antibody (Pharmingen) in PBS for 2 h. After three PBS washes, cells were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, mounted, and visualized under the fluorescence microscope, and images were captured with the CCD camera. Previous studies have demonstrated that CPT-induced DNA SSBs are transcription-dependent and require proteasome activity (23Lin C.P. Ban Y. Lyu Y.L. Desai S.D. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 21074-21083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To test whether CPT-induced DSBs also require proteasome activity, HeLa cells were treated with CPT in the presence and absence of the proteasome inhibitor, MG-132, and the formation of DSBs was monitored by the neutral comet assay. As shown in Fig. 1A, CPT (1 h of treatment) induced a substantial increase (from 0.7 to 1.2) of the tail moment, indicative of the formation of DNA DSBs. Consistent with previous studies (9Hsiang Y.H. Lihou M.G. Liu L.F. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5077-5082PubMed Google Scholar, 11Tsao Y.P. Russo A. Nyamuswa G. Silber R. Liu L.F. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5908-5914PubMed Google Scholar, 22Seiler J.A. Conti C. Syed A. Aladjem M.I. Pommier Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 5806-5818Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), CPT-induced DSBs were largely abolished by co-treatment with the DNA polymerase inhibitor aphidicolin (APH) but not the transcription inhibitor DRB, suggesting that CPT-induced DSBs are exclusively replication-dependent. Interestingly, co-treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 also largely abolished CPT-induced DSBs in HeLa cells, suggesting a requirement of proteasome activity for CPT-induced DSBs. The involvement of proteasome activity in the formation of DSBs in CPT-treated HeLa cells was also supported by measuring CPT-induced γ-H2AX, a marker for DNA DSBs (24Thiriet C. Hayes J.J. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 617-622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). As in the case of neutral comet assay, CPT-induced (1 h of treatment) γ-H2AX was diminished by co-treatment with the replication inhibitor APH (Fig. 1B) or the proteasome inhibitors MG-132 (Fig. 1B) and PS-341 (bortezomib, a therapeutic proteasome inhibitor) (Fig. 1C), but not the transcription inhibitor DRB (Fig. 1B), suggesting the involvement of both DNA replication and proteasome activity, but not transcription, in the generation of CPT-induced DSBs. The involvement of proteasome activity in CPT-induced DNA damage was further demonstrated by measuring various DNA damage signals. As shown in Fig. 2A, CPT was shown to induce ATM autophosphorylation (phosphorylation of Ser-1981), Chk2 phosphorylation (phosphorylation of Ser-33/35), and Mre11 phosphorylation in HeLa cells. All these phosphorylations were abolished or reduced by co-treatment with APH and MG-132 but not DRB (Fig. 2A). CPT was also shown to induce Chk1 phosphorylation (Ser-345) in HeLa cells in a proteasome-dependent manner (Fig. 2C). Similar experiments were also performed in HT29 colorectal cancer cells. As shown in Fig. 2B, CPT was shown to induce phosphorylation of ATM (Ser-1981), H2AX (Ser-139), p53 (Ser-15), RPA2 (detected by band shift), and Mre11 (detected by band shift) in HT29 cells. Consistent with previous studies, the phosphorylation of RPA2 and Mre11 appears to be replication-dependent because those band shifts (reflecting the phosphorylated forms of RPA2 and Mre11) induced by CPT were abolished by APH but not DRB (25Shao R.G. Cao C.X. Zhang H. Kohn K.W. Wold M.S. Pommier Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1397-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 26Takemura H. Ashutosh Rao V. Sordet O. Furuta T. Miao Z.H. Meng L. Zhang H. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 30814-30823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Again, these phosphorylations were significantly diminished by co-treatment with MG-132, suggesting the involvement of proteasome in replication-dependent DNA damages induced by CPT. The requirement of proteasome activity appears to be specific for CPT-induced DNA damage. As shown in Fig. 3A, IR-induced DNA damage signals (i.e. γ-H2AX and phosphorylated Chk1 and Chk2), unlike CPT-induced DNA damage signals, were not reduced by MG-132 co-treatment in either HeLa or HT29 cells, suggesting the requirement of proteasome activity is specific for CPT-induced DNA damage. In addition, the amount of IR-induced DNA DSBs, as measured by neutral comet assay, were essentially the same in the presence and absence of MG-132 (Fig. 3B), suggesting that the requirement of proteasome activity for DSB formation is specific for CPT but not IR. Similar experiments were repeated in HeLa and HT29 cells using HU, which is known to arrest the replication forks through depletion of the nucleotide pool. As shown in Fig. 3, C and D, HU-induced DNA damage signals (i.e. γ-H2AX and Ser-15-phosphorylated p53) and DNA DSBs (monitored by neutral comet assay) were unaffected by MG-132. Together, these results suggest that proteasome activity is specifically required for CPT-induced but not IR- or HU-induced DNA damage. It should be noted that Chk1 phosphorylation actually increased, rather than decreased, in IR-irradiated HeLa cells in the presence of MG-132. This phenomenon is consistent with the recent finding that phosphorylated Chk1, which is induced upon DNA damage, is degraded by proteasome (27Zhang Y.W. Otterness D.M. Chiang G.G. Xie W. Liu Y.C.

Although the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is well characterized for the degradation of many proteins, an increasing number of proteins are known to be degraded by proteasome in a ubiquitin-independent manner (reviewed in Ref. 28Hoyt M.A. Coffino P. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 1596-1600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether CPT-induced DSBs require all components of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, the role of ubiquitin in CPT-induced DNA damage was determined by using a ubiquitin isopeptidase inhibitor I, G5, which is effective in depleting the ubiquitin pool (23Lin C.P.

Brancolini C. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 9235-9244Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A (upper panel), CPT-induced DNA γ-H2AX was diminished in HeLa cells pretreated with G5 (1 h pretreatment followed by 1 h co-treatment with CPT, a condition known to deplete the free ubiquitin pool and inhibit CPT-induced Top1 degradation (23Lin C.P. Ban Y. Lyu Y.L. Desai S.D. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 21074-21083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar)). Similarly, CPT-induced γ-H2AX and phosphorylated Mre11 were diminished in HT29 cells treated with G5 (Fig. 4A, lower panel). These results suggest that CPT-induced DNA damage may involve a ubiquitin-dependent pathway. To further investigation the involvement of ubiquitin, the role of ubiquitin E1 was also determined using the mouse leukemic Ts85 cell line that harbors a temperature-sensitive ubiquitin E1 and its wild type control cell line, Fm3A (30Finley D. Ciechanover A. Varshavsky A. Cell. 1984; 37: 43-55Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4B, CPT-induced γ-H2AX in Fm3A cells was significantly higher than in Ts85 cells at the nonpermissive temperature, 39 °C, suggesting the involvement of ubiquitin E1 in CPT-induced DNA damage. Previous studies have demonstrated that a cullin 3 (CUL-3)-based E3 ligase is involved in degradation of Top1 in CPT-treated cells (31Zhang H.F. Tomida A. Koshimizu R. Ogiso Y. Lei S. Tsuruo T. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 1114-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Although degradation of Top1 in CPT-treated cells is primarily due to a transcription-dependent process, it is possible that a CUL-3-based E3 ligase may also be involved in replication- and proteasome-dependent DNA damage induced by CPT. To test this possibility, CUL-3 was knocked down in HeLa cells by the CUL-3 siRNA. As shown in Fig. 5A, CPT induced rapid degradation of Top1 (Top1 down-regulation) in HeLa cells, a phenomenon that has been well characterized and shown to be transcription- and proteasome-dependent (8Desai S.D.

Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5926-5932PubMed Google Scholar). CPT-induced Top1 down-regulation was diminished in HeLa cells treated with CUL-3 siRNA, consistent with the report that Top1 down-regulation requires the CUL-3-based E3 ligase (31Zhang H.F. Tomida A. Koshimizu R. Ogiso Y. Lei S. Tsuruo T. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 1114-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Interestingly, CPT-induced DNA damage signals (e.g. γ-H2AX and phosphorylated Chk2), which are known to be replication-dependent, were also much reduced in CUL-3 siRNA-treated HeLa cells (Fig. 5B), suggesting that replication-dependent DNA damage induced by CPT also requires a CUL-3-based E3 ligase. To further evaluate the involvement of proteasome in CPT-induced DNA damage, the proteasome maturation protein (POMP) was also knocked down by POMP siRNA in HeLa cells. POMP is known to facilitate major steps of 20 S proteasome assembly at the endoplasmic reticulum (32Fricke B. Heink S. Steffen J. Kloetzel P.M. Krüger E. EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 1170-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5A, CPT-induced Top1 down-regulation, which is transcription- and proteasome-dependent, was significantly reduced in HeLa cells treated with POMP siRNA, consistent with the proposed role of proteasome in CPT-induced Top1 down-regulation (8Desai S.D. Zhang H. Rodriguez-Bauman A. Yang J.M. Wu X. Gounder M.K. Rubin E.H. Liu L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2341-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Interestingly, CPT-induced DNA damage signals (e.g. γ-H2AX) (Fig. 5B), which are replication-dependent, were also much reduced in HeLa cells treated with POMP siRNA. This result suggests that the 20 S proteasome assembly is required for CPT-induced, replication-dependent, DNA DSBs, consistent with the notion that the proteasome activity is required for CPT-induced DNA DSBs. Degradation of proteins by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is known to require the formation of polyUb chains through the action of E1/E2/E3 and other factors (reviewed in Ref. 33Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2922) Google Scholar). A number of lysine residues (e.g. Lys-29, Lys-63, and Lys-48) on ubiquitin are known to form polyUb chains through isopeptide bonds (reviewed in Ref.34Ikeda F. Dikic I. EMBO Rep. 2008; 9: 536-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar), and Lys-48-linked polyUb chains are known to be the major polyUb chains associated with degradation by proteasome (33Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2922) Google Scholar). In the previous study, we have demonstrated that the formation of Lys-48-, but not Lys-29- and Lys-63-, linked polyUb chains on Top1 is responsible for CPT-induced, transcription-dependent, DNA SSBs (23Lin C.P.

To test whether Lys-48-linked polyUb chains are also involved in the CPT-induced, replication-dependent, DSBs, a plasmid expressing the dominant-negative mutant ubiquitin (K48R) was transiently transfected into HeLa cells.

https://openalex.org/W2121222881,"Background Malignant pleural mesothelioma is considered an almost incurable tumour with increasing incidence worldwide. It usually develops in the parietal pleura, from mesothelial lining or submesothelial cells, subsequently invading the visceral pleura. Chromosomal and genomic aberrations of mesothelioma are diverse and heterogenous. Genome-wide profiling of mesothelioma versus parietal and visceral normal pleural tissue could thus reveal novel genes and pathways explaining its aggressive phenotype. Methodology and Principal Findings Well-characterised tissue from five mesothelioma patients and normal parietal and visceral pleural samples from six non-cancer patients were profiled by Affymetrix oligoarray of 38 500 genes. The lists of differentially expressed genes tested for overrepresentation in KEGG PATHWAYS (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) and GO (gene ontology) terms revealed large differences of expression between visceral and parietal pleura, and both tissues differed from mesothelioma. Cell growth and intrinsic resistance in tumour versus parietal pleura was reflected in highly overexpressed cell cycle, mitosis, replication, DNA repair and anti-apoptosis genes. Several genes of the “salvage pathway” that recycle nucleobases were overexpressed, among them TYMS, encoding thymidylate synthase, the main target of the antifolate drug pemetrexed that is active in mesothelioma. Circadian rhythm genes were expressed in favour of tumour growth. The local invasive, non-metastatic phenotype of mesothelioma, could partly be due to overexpression of the known metastasis suppressors NME1 and NME2. Down-regulation of several tumour suppressor genes could contribute to mesothelioma progression. Genes involved in cell communication were down-regulated, indicating that mesothelioma may shield itself from the immune system. Similarly, in non-cancer parietal versus visceral pleura signal transduction, soluble transporter and adhesion genes were down-regulated. This could represent a genetical platform of the parietal pleura propensity to develop mesothelioma. Conclusions Genome-wide microarray approach using complex human tissue samples revealed novel expression patterns, reflecting some important features of mesothelioma biology that should be further explored."
https://openalex.org/W1502493645,"Adipogenesis is a key differentiation process relevant to obesity and associated diseases such as type 2 diabetes. This process involves temporally regulated genes controlled by a set of transcription factors, CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBP) β, C/EBPδ, and C/EBPα and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ). Currently, PPARγ is universally accepted as the master regulator that is necessary and sufficient to induce adipogenesis as no known factor can induce adipogenesis without PPARγ. We present evidence that a novel zinc finger protein, MCP-1-induced protein (MCPIP), can induce adipogenesis without PPARγ. Classical adipogenesis-inducing medium induces MCP-1 production and expression of MCPIP in 3T3-L1 cells before the induction of the C/EBP family of transcription factors and PPARγ. Knockdown of MCPIP prevents their expression and adipogenesis as measured by expression of adipocyte markers and lipid droplet accumulation. Treatment of 3T3-L1 cells with MCP-1 or forced expression of MCPIP induces expression of C/EBPβ, C/EBPδ, C/EBPα, and PPARγ and adipogenesis without any other inducer.

Thus, MCPIP is a newly identified protein that can induce adipogenesis without PPARγ. The incidence of obesity and associated diseases is increasing dramatically throughout the world. The global incidence of type 2 diabetes is projected to double to 350 million cases by the year 2030 (1Ogden C.L. Carroll M.D. Curtin L.R. McDowell M.A. Tabak C.J. Flegal K.M. JAMA. 2006; 295: 1549-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (7402) Google Scholar). Because adipose tissue serves as a crucial integrator of glucose homeostasis, understanding of adipocyte biology is crucial for understanding the pathophysiological basis of obesity and related metabolic diseases (2Rosen E.D.

Adipogenesis and angiogenesis, which supply blood to the growing adipose tissue, occur in the growing adipose tissue when the caloric intake significantly exceeds caloric expenditure. Adipogenesis involves a temporally regulated set of gene expression controlled by a set of transcription factors (3Guilherme A. Virbasius J.V. Vishwajeet P. Czech M.P. Nat. Rev. Mol.

MacDougald O.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 885-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (1957) Google Scholar). This conclusion is based mainly on the finding that forced expression of PPARγ in C/EBPα−/− fibroblasts induces adipogenesis (5Wu Z. Rosen E.D. Brun R. Hauser S. Adelmant G. Troy A.E. McKeon C. Darlington G.J. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 151-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar), whereas forced expression of C/EBPα in PPARγ−/− fibroblasts does not induce adipogenesis (6Rosen E.D. Hsu C.H. Wang X. Sakai S. Freeman M.W. Gonzalez F.J. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). Thus, the current concept is that PPARγ is both necessary and sufficient for adipogenesis. No other factor is known that can induce adipogenesis in the absence of PPARγ (7Lefterova M.I. Lazar M.A. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2009; 20: 107-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). Here we report that a newly discovered zinc finger protein, MCP-1-induced protein (MCPIP) (8Zhou L. Azfer A. Niu J. Graham S. Choudhury M. Adamski F.M. Younce C. Binkley P.F. Kolattukudy P.E. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 1177-1185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), induces adipogenesis in the absence of PPARγ. In an engineered tissue model, MCP-1 treatment was reported to enhance adipose tissue volume (9Hemmrich K. Thomas G.P. Abberton K.M. Thompson E.W. Rophael J.A. Penington A.J. Morrison W.A. Obesity. 2007; 15: 2951-2957Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In 3T3-L1 cells undergoing adipogenesis in the commonly used adipogenesis-inducing medium, containing dexamethasone, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and insulin (DMI), MCP-1 is produced, and MCPIP is induced before the induction of the C/EBP family of transcription factors and PPARγ. Knockdown of MCPIP with siRNA inhibits induction of these genes and adipogenesis. Treatment of 3T3-L1 cells with MCP-1 or forced expression of MCPIP induces adipogenesis without the adipogenesis-inducing DMI medium. Forced expression of MCPIP induces adipogenesis in PPARγ−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF). Thus, MCPIP is a newly identified inducer of adipogenesis. CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ C-C motif chemokine receptor 2 dexamethasone, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine lipoprotein lipase MCP-1-induced protein mouse embryonic fibroblasts reverse transcription small interfering RNA green fluorescent protein glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The 3T3-L1 fibroblast cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). PPARγ−/− MEF cell line was obtained from Dr. Bruce Spiegelman, Harvard University. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 10% fetal bovine serum until experimentation. Cells growing on plates at 60% confluency were treated with or without 10 ng/ml MCP-1 for 7 days. Adipocyte differentiation was induced by replacing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with media containing DMI (Zen-Bio, Inc.). Construction of the MCPIP-GFP expression plasmid has been described previously (8Zhou L. Azfer A. Niu J. Graham S. Choudhury M. Adamski F.M. Younce C. Binkley P.F. Kolattukudy P.E. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 1177-1185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with 100 nmol/liter of a chemically synthesized siRNA targeted for MCPIP (Ambion) or with 100 nmol/liter nonspecific siRNA (Ambion) 12 h prior to treatment with DMI. All cells types were transfected using FuGENE HD (Roche Applied Science). 3T3-L1 or PPARγ−/− MEF cells were fixed with 10% formalin for 30 min at room temperature 8 days after experimental treatment. Cells were then washed with 60% isopropyl alcohol followed by treatment with Oil Red-O (2.1 mg/ml) for 20 min at room temperature. Samples were then washed four times with H2O. Images of sample plates stained with Oil Red-O were taken and analyzed using morphometric software analysis. Oil Red-O was evaluated by measuring total objects stained, area of plate stained, and total intensity of stained area. All three methods yielded similar results. After examining the plates microscopically, they were treated with 100% isopropyl alcohol to extract Oil Red-O. The solution was then measured for absorbance at 520 nm. Total RNA was isolated from treated fibroblasts using TRIzol (Invitrogen). First-strand cDNA was synthesized using 1 μg of total RNA (DNase-treated) using the RT cDNA synthesis kit (High Capacity, Applied Biosystems). β-Actin served as internal control. The primer set forward 5-ctccaatgttctcaaacttac-3′ and reverse 5′-gtattcctatggcttccagtgc-3′ was used to detect a 400-bp product in the PPARγ−/− MEF cell line to confirm the deletion of exon 2 in PPARγ (9Hemmrich K.

Obesity. 2007; 15: 2951-2957Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). 3T3-L1 and PPARγ−/− MEFs were treated with cell lysis buffer (20% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 8% 0.5 m EDTA, and 1% 1 m dithiothreitol), and protein samples were collected and subjected to immunoblot using polyclonal antibodies specific for MCPIP (1:2000), C/EBPα (1:2000), C/EBPβ (1:2000, Abcam), C/EBPδ (1:2000, Abcam), PPARγ (1:2000, Abcam), adiponectin (1:3000, Abcam), LPL (1:2000, Abcam), aP2 (1:2000, Abcam), and apelin (1:3000, Abcam). Rabbit secondary antibody was used at a concentration of 1:5000 except for aP2, which used a chicken secondary antibody at a concentration of 1:5000. We recently reported that MCP-1 binding to CCR2 leads to the induction of a novel zinc finger protein, called MCPIP, that can induce cell death (8Zhou L. Azfer A. Niu J. Graham S. Choudhury M.

Fatma S. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 14542-14551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). MCP-1 production by preadipocytes has been detected (11Wang B. Jenkins J.R. Trayhurn P. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2005; 288: E731-E740Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), and in a tissue engineering model of adipogenesis MCP-1 treatment was reported to increase adipose tissue mass in vivo (9Hemmrich K. Thomas G.P. Abberton K.M. Thompson E.W. Rophael J.A. Penington A.J. Morrison W.A. Obesity. 2007; 15: 2951-2957Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In view of these observations that suggest the possibility of a role for MCP-1 in adipogenesis, we tested whether differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells into adipocytes involves MCP-1. First, we tested whether 3T3-L1 cells were induced to produce MCP-1 by DMI medium. Real time RT-PCR showed that MCP-1 transcript level reached maxima 4 h after treatment with DMI medium compared with non-DMI-containing medium (Fig. 1A). We then tested whether MCP-1 treatment could induce differentiation of 3T3L-1 cells into adipocytes in a non-DMI-containing medium. MCP-1 treatment induced expression of the C/EBP family of transcription factors and PPARγ that is known to be induced during differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells into adipocytes (Fig. 1B). C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ were induced early followed by induction of C/EBPα and PPARγ. Induction of these adipogenesis-associated transcription factors was clearly seen at the transcript level determined by real time PCR analysis and at the protein level as determined by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1, B and C). MCP-1 treatment induced adipocyte markers. Induction of adiponectin, LPL, and AP2 was clearly seen at the transcript level determined by real time PCR and protein level as determined by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1, D and E). Microscopic examination revealed lipid body accumulation. Oil Red-O staining revealed robust accumulation of lipid bodies (Fig. 1F). We tested whether MCP-1-induced adipogenesis is mediated via MCPIP. Upon MCP-1 treatment, MCPIP was induced to a maximal level during the 1st day (Fig. 1G). This induction was clear from real time PCR measurement of the transcript level and from the immunoblot analysis of MCPIP protein level. After the 2nd day MCPIP levels decreased. This result is consistent with the involvement of MCPIP in adipogenesis. If MCPIP is a key player in adipogenesis, it should be induced early during the adipocyte differentiation and induced in 3T3-L1 cells by the commonly used adipogenesis-inducing DMI medium. The levels of MCPIP, C/EBPβ, and C/EBPδ reached maximal levels during the first 2 days. Induction of PPARγ and C/EBPα followed as expected (Fig. 2). That MCPIP plays a critical role in adipogenesis is indicated by the finding that knockdown of MCPIP expression with siRNA specific for MCPIP inhibited adipogenesis induced by DMI medium, whereas nonspecific (scrambled) siRNA had very little effect (Fig. 3, A–H). This inhibition was demonstrated by the inhibition of appearance of adipocyte markers adiponectin and LPL at the transcript level as indicated by real time RT-PCR (Fig. 3A) and at the protein level as measured by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 3, B and C). In addition, real time RT-PCR measurements of transcript levels showed that knockdown of MCPIP expression resulted in inhibition of induction of the known adipogenesis-associated transcription factors C/EBPβ, C/EBPδ, C/EBPα, and PPARγ (Fig. 3, D–G). Staining of the cells with Oil Red-O after 8 days of differentiation in DMI medium showed that knockdown of MCPIP by treatment with siRNA, specific for MCPIP, drastically inhibited lipid droplet accumulation, whereas nonspecific siRNA had little effect (Fig. 3H). Measurement of Oil Red-O extracted from stained cells also shows that knockdown of MCPIP inhibited lipid accumulation (data not shown). These results suggest that MCPIP plays a critical role in adipogenesis induced by DMI.FIGURE 3Knockdown of MCPIP inhibited DMI-induced adipogenesis. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were treated with siRNA specific for MCPIP for 24 h before treatment with DMI. A, RNA was isolated from all samples 7 days after DMI treatment and was evaluated for transcript levels for the adipocyte markers, adiponectin, and LPL by using RT-PCR; β-actin served as a control.

Transfection of 3T3-L1 cells with an expression construct for MCPIP-GFP caused the induction of adipogenesis in the absence of DMI medium, whereas GFP controls did not show differentiation (Fig. 4). Forced expression of MCPIP induced the expression of the well established cascade of gene expression known to occur in DMI medium. MCPIP expression induced C/EBPβ, C/EPBδ, C/EBPα, and PPARγ, the transcription factors well known to be involved in adipogenesis. The induction of these transcription factors was seen both at the transcript levels measured by real time RT-PCR (Fig. 4, B–E) and at a protein level measured by immunoblot analyses (Fig. 4, F–K). C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ levels reached maximal levels before C/EBPα and PPARγ levels reached maximal levels as seen in DMI medium. MCPIP-induced adipogenesis was demonstrated by the induction of adipocyte markers, adiponectin and LPL, both at the transcript level as indicated by real time RT-PCR and at protein level as measured by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 4, L–O). Staining of the cells transfected with MCPIP-GFP expression plasmid, after 8 days in non-DMI medium showed strong staining of lipid bodies, whereas GFP controls showed no staining (Fig. 4P). Thus it is clear that MCPIP expression can induce adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells in the absence of the usual adipogenesis-inducing factors in the medium. MCP-1 treatment and forced expression of MCPIP in non-DMI medium caused accumulation of lipid droplets comparable with that observed in the DMI medium, although the DMI medium induced the most robust degree of lipid droplet accumulation. This conclusion is based on morphometric quantitative analysis of the stained plates (Fig. 5).FIGURE 5Treatment of 3T3-L1 cells with MCP-1 or transfection with MCPIP-GFP resulted in oil droplet accumulation comparable with 3T3-L1 cells treated with the classical mixture DMI. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were treated with DMI or MCP-1 or were transfected with MCPIP-GFP. Cells were stained with Oil Red-O 8 days after treatment. Images of plates were captured, and staining was measured using morphometric software analysis. Quantitation of lipid accumulation in the entire plate was done on the basis of total stained area, number of cells stained, and intensity of staining. All three methods yielded similar results. The results obtained on the basis of total area stained are displayed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In view of the currently held view that adipogenesis cannot be induced in the absence of PPARγ, we tested whether forced expression of MCPIP can induce adipogenesis in PPARγ−/− MEFs. We transfected PPARγ−/− cells with MCPIP-GFP expression plasmids or GFP control and incubated them in DMI medium. Forced expression of MCPIP in PPARγ−/− cells caused induction of the C/EBP family of transcription factors, C/EBPβ, C/EBPδ, and C/EBPα, as seen both at the transcript level as measured by real time PCR (Fig. 6A) and at protein level as measured by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 6, B–E). The MCPIP-GFP-transfected cells exhibited adipogenesis as indicated by induction of adipocyte markers, Ap2, adiponectin, and LPL, as measured by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 6, F and G), whereas GFP controls showed very little induction. Microscopic examination of the Oil Red-O-stained cells showed robust accumulation of lipid droplets in MCPIP-GFP-transfected PPARγ−/− cells, whereas GFP controls showed little lipid accumulation (Fig. 6H). Because this result is contrary to the currently accepted view that PPARγ is necessary for adipogenesis, we confirmed that the PPARγ−/− MEFs we used were, in fact, PPARγ−/− as reported by the authors who generated this PPARγ null cell line (12Rosen E.D.

Cell. 1999; 4: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1661) Google Scholar) and as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” Immunoblot analysis confirmed the absence of PPARγ protein (Fig. 6I). Thus, MCPIP expression can induce adipogenesis in the absence of PPARγ. The results presented here constitute the discovery of a previously unknown key player that can induce adipogenesis in the absence of PPARγ that is currently thought to be necessary and sufficient for adipogenesis. The central role of MCPIP in adipogenesis was demonstrated by the finding that MCP-1 production was induced very early after 3T3-L1 cells were placed in DMI medium. Furthermore, MCP-1 treatment of 3T3-L1 cells induced adipogenesis. This direct demonstration of MCP-1 induction of adipogenesis is consistent with a recent report that MCP-1 enhanced new adipose tissue formation in vivo (9Hemmrich K. Thomas G.P. Abberton K.M. Thompson E.W. Rophael J.A. Penington A.J. Morrison W.A. Obesity. 2007; 15: 2951-2957Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Adipogenic precursor cells are known to have CCR2 (13Gerhardt C.C. Romero I.A. Cancello R. Camoin L. Strosberg A.D. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 175: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Because MCPIP is induced by the signaling process resulting from MCP-1 interaction with its receptor CCR2 (8Zhou L. Azfer A. Niu J. Graham S. Choudhury M. Adamski F.M. Younce C. Binkley P.F. Kolattukudy P.E. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 1177-1185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the present results have implications on the role of MCP-1/CCR2 in obesity and type 2 diabetes. In diet-induced insulin resistance, mcp-1 gene expression in adipose tissue increases in ob/ob and db/dp mice (14Kanda H. Tateya S. Tamori Y. Kotani K. Hiasa K. Kitazawa R. Kitazawa S. Miyachi H. Maeda S. Egashira K. Kasuga M. J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 1494-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1977) Google Scholar). Adipocyte-specific overexpression of MCP-1 in mice results in increased macrophage recruitment to adipose tissue and causes hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance in liver and muscle as well as fat tissue. In CCR2−/− mice, recruitment of monocytes/macrophages into adipose tissue is inhibited, and development of obesity-induced insulin resistance is attenuated (15Weisberg S.P. Hunter D. Huber R. Lemieux J. Slaymaker S. Vaddi K. Charo I. Leibel R.L. Ferrante Jr., A.W. J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar). Macrophage recruitment and consequent inflammatory response in adipose tissue result in secretion of more MCP-1, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin-β (16Lagathu C. Yvan-Charvet L. Bastard J.P. Maachi M. Quignard-Boulangé A. Capeau J. Caron M. Diabetologia. 2006; 49: 2162-2173Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). These agents cause increase in lipolysis and decrease in triacylglycerol synthesis leading to increased levels of fatty acids and in the availability of triacylglycerols for uptake directly into skeletal muscle (3Guilherme A. Virbasius J.V. Vishwajeet P. Czech M.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (1610) Google Scholar). These excess circulating lipids cause accumulation of fatty acyl-CoA in skeletal muscle, liver, and β cells leading to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (17Unger R.H. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 863-870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Unger R.H. Annu. Rev. Med. 2002; 53: 319-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). The inflammatory stress causes interleukin-6 secretion from the adipose tissue that leads to expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling expression that is known to induce hepatic insulin resistance (19Sabio G. Das M. Mora A. Zhang Z. Jun J.Y. Ko H.J. Barrett T. Kim J.K. Davis R.J. Science. 2008; 322: 1539-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Thus, there is strong evidence for a key role that MCP-1/CCR2 system plays in obesity and type 2 diabetes. The role of MCP-1 in this process has been questioned on the basis that macrophage accumulation in adipose tissue was not significantly attenuated in MCP-1-deficient mice (20Inouye K.E. Shi H. Howard J.K. Daly C.H. Lord G.M. Rollins B.J. Flier J.S. Diabetes. 2007; 56: 2242-2250Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). However, MCP-5 can substitute as a CCR2 ligand in mice (21Sarafi M.N. Garcia-Zepeda E.A. MacLean J.A. Charo I.F. Luster A.D. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The exact source of MCP-1 in adipose tissue is not known, although there are several possibilities. Obesity is well known to cause elevation of MCP-1 levels. The resident macrophages and macrophages infiltrating the adipose tissue could produce MCP-1. MCP-1 production could also be caused by endotoxemia from gut flora elevated by feeding (22Cani P.D. Amar J. Iglesias M.A. Poggi M. Knauf C. Bastelica D. Neyrinck A.M. Fava F. Tuohy K.M. Chabo C. Waget A. Delmée E. Cousin B. Sulpice T. Chamontin B. Ferrières J. Tanti J.F. Gibson G.R. Casteilla L. Delzenne N.M. Alessi M.C. Burcelin R. Diabetes. 2007; 56: 1761-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (4229) Google Scholar). Death of adipocytes could release MCP-1, as dying cells are known to release MCP-1 (23Kobara M. Sunagawa N. Abe M. Tanaka N. Toba H. Hayashi H. Keira N. Tatsumi T. Matsubara H. Nakata T. J. Appl. Physiol. 2008; 104: 601-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Adipose tissue in obese animals is reported to have localized hypoxia that could lead to hypoxia-inducible factor induction and MCP-1 production (24Hosogai N. Fukuhara A. Oshima K. Miyata Y. Tanaka S. Segawa K. Furukawa S. Tochino Y. Komuro R. Matsuda M. Shimomura I. Diabetes. 2007; 56: 901-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar, 25Ye J. Gao Z. Yin J. He Q. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2007; 293: E1118-E1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). We have found that under hypoxia human macrophages secrete MCP-1. In adipose tissue macrophage-containing areas were found to be hypoxic, and thus these macrophages would also produce MCP-1. We show that MCP-1 binding to CCR2, which is known to be present in fibroblasts and preadipocytes (13Gerhardt C.C. Romero I.A. Cancello R. Camoin L. Strosberg A.D. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 175: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 26Hogaboam C.M. Bone-Larson C.L. Lipinski S. Lukacs N.W. Chensue S.W. Strieter R.M. Kunkel S.L. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2193-2201PubMed Google Scholar), caused MCPIP induction before C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ were induced. Furthermore, knockdown of MCPIP expression inhibited the induction of these transcription factors and drastically inhibited adipogenesis. Forced expression of MCPIP induced the cascade of transcription factors well known to be induced by DMI medium leading to robust adipogenesis. Thus MCPIP expression induced adipogenesis via the already known sequence of induction of transcription factors and expression of adipogenesis markers. MCPIP induction is one of the earliest events in adipogenesis, and MCPIP-induced adipogenesis was associated with PPARγ induction. What was surprising was that MCPIP expression could induce adipogenesis in PPARγ−/− cells in which no other factor has previously been able to induce adipogenesis. This finding shows that MCPIP is a key regulator of adipogenesis. How exactly MCPIP induces the expression of the C/EBP family of transcription factors that would lead to adipogenesis remains to be elucidated. Considering the finding that MCPIP is induced before the induction of the C/EBP family, it appears possible that the role of MCPIP is to induce the early transcriptions factors C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ, which would then lead to the induction of subsequent factors required for adipogenesis. C/EBPα and PPARγ can induce each other. However, C/EBPα cannot induce adipogenesis without PPARγ. Our results demonstrate that MCPIP can induce C/EBPα and adipogenesis without PPARγ. Thus, MCPIP can be considered a critical regulator of adipogenesis. There is overwhelming evidence that demonstrates a key role for CCR2-mediated events in obesity and development of type 2 diabetes. Our results show that the MCP-1/CCR2 system plays a direct role in adipogenesis. There is experimental evidence that MCP-1 can promote angiogenesis (27Salcedo R. Ponce M.L. Young H.A. Wasserman K.

Blood. 2005; 105: 1405-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) and that this MCP-1-induced angiogenesis is mediated via MCPIP (10Niu J. Azfer A. Zhelyabovska O. Fatma S. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 14542-14551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Thus, MCPIP induced by MCP-1/CCR2 interaction promotes adipogenesis and angiogenesis to supply blood to growing adipose tissue. These findings help provide a molecular basis for the role of the MCP-1/CCR2 system in the development of obesity and consequent development of type 2 diabetes.

https://openalex.org/W2003646972,"Since its original description, the induction of synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) has been known to be accompanied by a lasting increase in the intrinsic excitability (intrinsic plasticity) of hippocampal neurons. Recent evidence shows that dendritic excitability can be enhanced by an activity-dependent decrease in the activity of A-type K+ channels. In the present manuscript, we examined the role of A-type K+ channels in regulating intrinsic excitability of CA1 pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus after synapse-specific LTP induction. In electrophysiological recordings we found that LTP induced a potentiation of excitability which was accompanied by a two-phased change in A-type K+ channel activity recorded in nucleated patches from organotypic slices of rat hippocampus. Induction of LTP resulted in an immediate but short lasting hyperpolarization of the voltage-dependence of steady-state A-type K+ channel inactivation along with a progressive, long-lasting decrease in peak A-current density. Blocking clathrin-mediated endocytosis prevented the A-current decrease and most measures of intrinsic plasticity. These results suggest that two temporally distinct but overlapping mechanisms of A-channel downregulation together contribute to the plasticity of intrinsic excitability. Finally we show that intrinsic plasticity resulted in a global enhancement of EPSP-spike coupling."
https://openalex.org/W2043703665,"We investigated the interrelations between C4 ketogenesis (production of β-hydroxybutyrate + acetoacetate), C5 ketogenesis (production of β-hydroxypentanoate + β-ketopentanoate), and anaplerosis in isolated rat livers perfused with 13C-labeled octanoate, heptanoate, or propionate. Mass isotopomer analysis of C4 and C5 ketone bodies and of related acyl-CoA esters reveal that C4 and C5 ketogenesis share the same pool of acetyl-CoA. Although the uptake of octanoate and heptanoate by the liver are similar, the rate of C5 ketogenesis from heptanoate is much lower than the rate of C4 ketogenesis from octanoate. This results from the channeling of the propionyl moiety of heptanoate into anaplerosis of the citric acid cycle. C5 ketogenesis from propionate is virtually nil because acetoacyl-CoA thiolase does not favor the formation of β-ketopentanoyl-CoA from propionyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA. Anaplerosis and gluconeogenesis from heptanoate are inhibited by octanoate. The data have implications for the design of diets for the treatment of long chain fatty acid oxidation disorders, such as the triheptanoin-based diet.

In contrast, very little information is available on the metabolism of C5 ketone bodies, i.e. β-hydroxypentanoate (BHP) and β-ketopentanoate (BKP), which are known in the clinical literature as 3-hydroxyvalerate and 3-ketovalerate (5Sweetman L.

Biomed. Mass Spectrom. 1983; 10: 629-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The C5 ketone bodies are formed in liver from the partial oxidation of odd-chain fatty acids (see Fig. 1, center column). C5 ketogenesis uses the same enzymes of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) cycle as C4 ketogenesis. The counterpart of HMG-CoA in C5 ketogenesis is 3-hydroxy-3-ethylglutaryl-CoA (HEG-CoA). We only found one report on the formation of [14C]HEG-CoA in liver extract incubated with propionyl-CoA and [1-14C]acetyl-CoA (7Baker F.C. Schooley D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 664: 356-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). β-hydroxybutyrate acetoacetate β-ketopentanoate (3-ketovalerate) β-hydroxypentanoate (3-hydroxyvalerate) citric acid cycle β-hydroxy-β-ethylglutaryl-CoA β-hydroxy-β-methylglutaryl-CoA molar percent enrichments. Because odd-chain fatty acids are absent from the diet of non-ruminant mammals, body fluids contain only traces of C5 ketone bodies. However, C5 ketone bodies and hydroxyethylglutarate are found in body fluids of patients with disorders of the anaplerotic pathway, propionyl-CoA → methylmalonyl- CoA → succinyl-CoA, such as deficiency in propionyl-CoA carboxylase and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase as well as biotin or vitamin B12 deficiency (5Sweetman L.

Acta. 1978; 82: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The formation of C5 ketone bodies in these pathological states involves either the conversion of propionyl-CoA to BKP-CoA via 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (Fig. 1, reaction 1) or the β-oxidation of odd-chain fatty acids synthesized in these patients (9Hommes F.A. Kuipers J.R. Elema J.D. Jansen J.F. Jonxis J.H. Pediatr. Res. 1968; 2: 519-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) using propionyl-CoA as a primer (10Wakil S.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4523-4530Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Like their C4 counterparts, the C5 ketone bodies are interconverted by mitochondrial BHB dehydrogenase (11Bergmeyer H.U. Gawehn K. Klotzsch H. Krebs H.A. Williamson D.H. Biochem. J. 1967; 102: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In peripheral tissues, C5 ketone bodies are converted to propionyl-CoA (which is anaplerotic) + acetyl-CoA via 3-oxoacid-CoA transferase (12Stern J.R. Coon M.J. Del Campillo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 221: 1-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase. Peripheral tissues have a high capacity to utilize exogenous C5 ketone bodies (13Leclerc J. Des Rosiers C. Montgomery J.A. Brunet J. Ste-Marie L. Reider M.W. Fernandez C.A. Powers L. David F. Brunengraber H. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: E446-E452PubMed Google Scholar), especially heart, kidney, and brain, which have high activities of 3-oxoacid-CoA transferase (14Williamson D.H. Bates M.W. Page M.A. Krebs H.A. Biochem. J. 1971; 121: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 15Fukao T. Song X.Q. Mitchell G.A. Yamaguchi S. Sukegawa K. Orii T. Kondo N. Pediatr. Res. 1997; 42: 498-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Our interest in C5 ketone body metabolism arose from an ongoing clinical trial where patients with long chain fatty acid oxidation disorders are treated with a diet containing triheptanoin (16Roe C.R. Sweetman L. Roe D.S. David F. Brunengraber H. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 17Roe C.R. Yang B.Z. Brunengraber H. Roe D.S. Wallace M. Garritson B.K. Neurology. 2008; 71: 260-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) instead of the classical treatment with the even-chain triglyceride trioctanoin. These patients suffer from muscle weakness and rhabdomyolysis, manifested by the release of creatine kinase in plasma. It was hypothesized that the accumulation of long chain acyl-CoAs and long chain acylcarnitines results in membrane damage with release of large and small molecules from cells. The leakage of small molecules would deplete intermediates of the citric acid cycle (CAC) which carry acetyl groups as they are oxidized. It was further hypothesized that boosting anaplerosis with a suitable substrate would compensate for the chronic cataplerosis and improve heart and muscle function. The catabolism of heptanoate yields propionyl-CoA, which can be used for anaplerosis in most tissues, and C5 ketone bodies in liver. C5 ketone bodies are converted to propionyl-CoA, which can be used for anaplerosis in peripheral tissues. The marked improvement of the patients' conditions after switching from a trioctanoin- to a triheptanoin-based diet supported the hypothesis. After ingestion of meals containing triheptanoin as the only lipid component, both C5 ketone bodies and C4 ketone bodies accumulated in the plasma of patients that have been diagnosed with disorders of long chain fatty acid oxidation (16Roe C.R. Sweetman L. Roe D.S. David F. Brunengraber H. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). This suggested that acetyl groups derived from heptanoate can be used for the synthesis of C4 and C5 ketone bodies. Alternatively, the accumulation of C4 ketone bodies after triheptanoin ingestion might result from the inhibition of the utilization of C4 ketone bodies in peripheral tissues by C5 ketone bodies. The aim of the present study was to investigate the interaction between C4 and C5 ketogenesis in rat livers perfused with octanoate and/or heptanoate. To gain insight on the fates of the acetyl groups of both fatty acids and on the fate of the propionyl-CoA moiety of heptanoate, we conducted the experiments with a series of labeled substrates: [1-13C]octanoate, [8-13C]octanoate, [5,6,7-13C3]heptanoate, [1-13C]heptanoate, and [13C3]propionate. The outcome of the propionyl-CoA moiety of [5,6,7-13C3]heptanoate and [13C3]propionate was traced by measurements of anaplerosis and glucose labeling by mass isotopomer 3Mass isotopomers are designated as M1, M2…Mn, where n is the number of heavy atoms in the molecule. The mol percent enrichment of each isotopomer is designated as m1, m2…mn. analysis (18Kasumov T. Cendrowski A.V. David F. Jobbins K.A. Anderson V.E. Brunengraber H. Arch. Biochem.

In the present study we used gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to specifically assay C4 and C5 ketone bodies (13Leclerc J. Des Rosiers C. Montgomery J.A. Brunet J. Ste-Marie L. Reider M.W.

[1-13C]Heptanoic acid was prepared by reacting hexylmagnesium bromide with 13CO2. The purity of the vacuum-distilled product was assessed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and NMR. Internal standards of β-hydroxy-[2,2,3,4,4,4-2H6]butyrate and R,S-β-hydroxy-[2,2,3,4,4-2H5]pentanoate were prepared (13Leclerc J. Des Rosiers C. Montgomery J.A. Brunet J. Ste-Marie L. Reider M.W.

Reagents for trimethylsilyl and tert-butyldimethylsilyl derivatization were purchased from Pierce. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (130–140g) were fed ad libitum for 8–12 days with standard laboratory chow. Livers from overnight-fasted rats were perfused with non-recirculating bicarbonate buffer (30 ml/min) and 4 mm glucose containing 0 to 1 mm of either a single fatty acid ([1-13C]octanoate, [8-13C]octanoate, [5,6,7-13C3]heptanoate, or [13C3]propionate) or (1 mm octanoate + 0–1 mm heptanoate (or vice versa)) with different labeling patterns. At 14 and 18.5 min, samples of influent and effluent perfusate (collected over 1 min) were treated with NaB2H4 and frozen. This procedure stabilizes the unstable keto acids by converting them to stable monodeuterated hydroxy acids (13Leclerc J. Des Rosiers C. Montgomery J.A. Brunet J. Ste-Marie L. Reider M.W.

After 20 min the livers were quick-frozen and kept in liquid nitrogen until analysis. To assay the uptake of fatty acids and the production of C4 and C5 ketone bodies, 0.1-ml samples of NaB2H4-treated perfusate (influent and effluent) were (i) spiked with internal standards (30 nmol of [2H13]heptanoate, 30 nmol of [2H15]octanoate, 50 nmol of [2H5] propionate, 45 nmol of β-hydroxy-[2H6]butyrate, and 34 nmol of β-hydroxy-[2H5]pentanoate), (ii) acidified (to destroy excess NaB2H4), and (iii) deproteinized with 0.7 ml of acetonitrile/methanol (7:3). Supernatants from samples from experiments with octanoate and/or heptanoate were dried with N2, and the residue was treated to form the trimethylsilyl derivatives of the analytes. Supernatants from samples from experiments with propionate were dried with N2, and the residue was treated to form the tert-butyldimethylsilyl derivatives of the analytes. The treatment of the samples with NaB2H4 prevents assaying the individual concentrations of the labeled C4 ketone bodies (BHB and AcAc) and C5 ketone bodies (BHP and BKP) because of overlapping of some mass isotopomers. Therefore, the data of this assay yield total concentrations of C4 or C5 ketone bodies (13Leclerc J. Des Rosiers C. Montgomery J.A. Brunet J. Ste-Marie L. Reider M.W. Fernandez C.A. Powers L.

For the assay of the labeling pattern of individual C4 and C5 ketone bodies, 0.5-ml samples of effluent perfusate (not treated with NaB2H4) were incubated with 50 μmol of methoxylamine-HCl (adjusted to pH 9) and incubated at 60 °C for 40 min. After acidifying with HCl to pH 1, the samples were extracted 3 times with 5 ml of diethyl ether. The combined extracts were dried with N2, and the residue was treated to form the tert-butyldimethylsilyl derivatives of the ketone bodies. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry assay under electron ionization conditions yielded the mass isotopomer distribution of the total C4 and C5 ketone body molecules and the fragments corresponding to C-3 + 4 of C4 ketone bodies and C-3 + 4 + 5 of C5 ketone bodies (13Leclerc J. Des Rosiers C. Montgomery J.A. Brunet J. Ste-Marie L. Reider M.W. Fernandez C.A. Powers L. David F. Brunengraber H. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: E446-E452PubMed Google Scholar, 21Des Rosiers C.

Labeling of glucose was assayed on the penta-acetate derivative. For the assay of the mass isotopomer distribution of acyl-CoA esters, 250 mg of frozen liver powder was extracted with 4 ml of methanol/H2O (1:1) containing 5% acetic acid. After a 1-min extraction at 0 °C with a Polytron and centrifugation at 8000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was run through a solid phase extraction ion exchange cartridge packed with 300 mg of 2–2(pyridyl)ethyl silica gel (Sigma-Aldrich). The cartridge was preactivated with 3 ml of methanol followed by 3 ml of methanol/H2O (1:1) containing 5% acetic acid. After washing the cartridge with 3 ml of methanol/H2O (1:1) containing 5% acetic acid, the acyl-CoA esters were eluted out by (i) 3 ml of methanol/H2O (1:1) containing 50 mm ammonium formate, (ii) 3 ml methanol/H2O (3:1) containing 50 mm ammonium formate, and (iii) 3 ml of methanol. The combined effluent was dried under N2, and the residue was stored at −80 °C until liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. After dissolving the acyl-CoAs in 100 μl of high performance liquid chromatography buffer A (5% acetonitrile in 100 mm ammonium formate, pH 5.0), 10 μl of solution was injected on a Thermo Electron Hypersil Gold column (C18, 100 × 2.1 mm, 3-μm particle size) protected by a guard column (Hypersil Gold, C18, 10 × 2.1 mm, 3-μm particle size). Gradient elution at a constant flow rate of 0.2 ml/min was (i) 98% buffer A + 2% buffer B (5 mm ammonium formate in 95% acetonitrile) for 7 min, (ii) 2 to 60% B from 7 to 25 min, (iii) 60 to 90% B from 25 to 26 min, (iv) 90% B from 26 to 30 min, and (v) re-equilibration with initial buffer for 9 min before next injection. The order of acyl-CoA elution was malonyl-CoA (2.2 min), methylmalonyl-CoA (2.7 min), succinyl-CoA (3.5 min), HMG-CoA (3.9 min), acetyl-CoA (6.7 min), AcAc-CoA (6.9 min), BHB-CoA (8.1 min), HEG-CoA (9.1 min), BKP-CoA (14.0 min), propionyl-CoA (14.2 min), BHP-CoA (14.4 min), pentanoyl-CoA (17.7 min), hexanoyl-CoA (19.5 min), heptanoyl-CoA (20.9 min), and octanoyl-CoA (22.2 min). The liquid chromatograph was coupled to a 4000 QTrap mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) operated under positive electrospray ionization mode with the following parameters; the source temperature was set at 600 °C with gas 1 and gas 2 at 65 and 55 p.s.i., respectively. The curtain gas was at 30 p.s.i., and the collision-activated dissociation gas pressure was held at high. The turbo ion-spray voltage, declustering potential, entrance potential, and collision cell exit potential were 4500, 70, 10, and 50 V, respectively. Multiple reaction monitoring mode was used for quantitation and isotope enrichment analysis. The analyst software (Version 1.4.2, Applied Biosystems) was used for data collection and analysis. Correction of measured mass isotopomer distributions for natural enrichment was performed using the CORMAT software (22Fernandez C.A. Des Rosiers C. Previs S.F. David F. Brunengraber H. J. Mass Spectrom. 1996; 31: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Relative rates of anaplerosis from [13C3]propionyl-CoA precursors ([13C3]propionate, [5,6,7-13C3]heptanoate) were calculated (18Kasumov T. Cendrowski A.V. David F. Jobbins K.A. Anderson V.E. Brunengraber H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2007; 463: 110-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) as the ratio (m3 succinyl-CoA)/(m3 propionyl-CoA). These ratios refer to the contribution of the anaplerotic substrates to the catalytic intermediates of the CAC, which carry acetyl units as they are oxidized. Note that when label enters the CAC only via propionyl-CoA, M3 succinyl-CoA is only formed from the sequence M3 propionyl-CoA → M3 methylmalonyl-CoA → M3 succinyl-CoA (recycling of label in the CAC cannot form M3 succinyl-CoA). In experiments with [1-13C]octanoate or [8-13C]octanoate, the distribution of label between the two acetyl of C4 ketone bodies was calculated using (i) the m1 and m2 enrichments of the whole BHB molecule, and (ii) the m1 enrichment of the C-3 + 4 fragment of BHB. The m1 enrichment of the C-1 + 2 acetyl of BHB was calculated as: m1 of C-1 + 2 = [(2m2 + m1) of C-1 → 4] − (m1 of C-3 + 4). Herein, we present data from ∼70 liver perfusion experiments. For each of the conditions chosen, we ran six perfusions in the presence of selected unlabeled or 13C-labeled substrate(s) with the concentration parameters being allowed to vary. The data points shown in the figures represent means of duplicate gas chromatography-mass spectrometry or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry injections, which differed by <2%. The statistical differences between some profiles were tested using a paired t test (Graph Pad Prism Software, Version 3). Fig. 2A shows the uptake of octanoate and its conversion to C4 ketone bodies. Because 1 molecule of octanoate can yield up to two molecules of C4 ketone bodies, the yield of C4 ketogenesis from exogenous octanoate ranged from 80 to 90%. This calculation assumes that basal C4 ketogenesis at zero octanoate concentration was not inhibited by increasing concentrations of octanoate. Similar data were reported by McGarry and Foster (23McGarry J.D. Foster D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 1149-1159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2B shows the uptake of heptanoate and its conversion to both C5- and C4 ketone bodies. The uptake of heptanoate (Fig. 2B) was very similar to the uptake of octanoate (Fig. 2A). Because the oxidation of 1 molecule of heptanoate yields 1 molecule of propionyl-CoA and 2 molecules of acetyl-CoA, one calculates that (i) only about 40% of the propionyl moiety of heptanoate was converted to C5 ketone bodies, and (ii) about 75% of the acetyl moiety of heptanoate was converted to C5- and C4 ketone bodies. Thus, as outlined in Fig. 1, acetyl-CoA derived from heptanoate seems to be used to form both C5- and C4 ketone bodies. This will be confirmed by the labeling data presented below. The low yield of conversion of the propionyl moiety of heptanoate to C5 ketone bodies results from its diversion to anaplerosis and gluconeogenesis (Fig. 1) as will be shown below. Fig. 2C shows the uptake of propionate and the release of C5- and C4 ketone bodies. The yield of C5 ketogenesis from propionate was extremely low (about 0.1%). The much lower yield of C5 ketogenesis from propionate compared with heptanoate (Fig. 2B) reflects the properties of 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (Fig. 1, reaction 1), which had been described for the interconversion of AcAc-CoA and acetyl-CoA by this enzyme (24Hüth W. Dierich C. von Oeynhausen V. Seubert W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 56: 1069-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 25Hüth W. Dierich C. von Oeynhausen V. Seubert W. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1973; 354: 635-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 26Hüth W. Alves F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 830: 274-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 27Balzer I. Hüth W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 870: 350-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Although the thiolase reaction is reversible in vitro, its kinetic properties prevent the formation of AcAc-CoA from acetyl-CoA. This explains why C4 ketogenesis cannot be fueled by acetyl-CoA derived from glucose metabolism. The virtually nil C5 ketogenesis from propionate demonstrates that in the intact liver thiolase does not allow the formation of BKP-CoA from propionyl-CoA + acetyl-CoA. In contrast, thiolase allows the cleavage of BKP-CoA derived from heptanoate to propionyl-CoA + acetyl-CoA. Fig. 2C also shows that propionate inhibits C4 ketogenesis from endogenous fatty acids, as reported by Brass and Beyerinck (20Brass E.P. Beyerinck R.A. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 819-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To test the interaction between the uptakes of octanoate and heptanoate as well as the formation of C4 and C5 ketone bodies, we perfused livers with 1 mm concentrations of one fatty acid and increasing concentrations of the second fatty acid and vice versa (Figs. 3 and 4). Figs. 3, A and B, show that, starting with similar uptakes of 1 mm octanoate or heptanoate alone, the effects of octanoate on heptanoate metabolism are different from the effects of heptanoate on octanoate metabolism. The competition favors octanoate uptake over heptanoate uptake (Figs. 3, A and B; p < 0.05 for both comparisons). Fig. 4A shows that when increasing concentrations of heptanoate are added to a constant 1 mm octanoate, the production of C4 ketone bodies was not inhibited (slope was not significantly different from zero). Also, the production of C5 ketone bodies was much lower than in the presence of heptanoate alone (Fig. 2B). Fig. 4B shows that when increasing concentrations of octanoate were added to a constant 1 mm heptanoate, the production of C4 ketone bodies increased markedly, almost as much as in the presence of octanoate alone (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, the production of C5 ketone bodies from heptanoate decreased compared with what occurred in the presence of 1 mm heptanoate alone (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 4Competition between C4 ketogenesis from octanoate and C5 ketogenesis from heptanoate in perfused rat livers. A, constant 1 mm octanoate + increasing heptanoate concentration in influent perfusate. B, constant 1 mm heptanoate + increasing octanoate concentration in influent perfusate.

Kietzmann T. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1996; 16: 179-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) and (ii) the factors that influence the distribution of label between the two acetyl moieties of C4 ketone bodies. First, Fig. 5 shows that at low influent concentrations of octanoate (up to 0.2 mm), almost no substrate left the liver in the effluent perfusate. In perfusions with increasing concentrations of heptanoate, the profile of effluent heptanoate concentrations (not shown) was identical to what was measured in perfusions with octanoate. Under these conditions, the pericentral cells of the liver lobule were in contact with much lower octanoate or heptanoate concentrations than the periportal cells. The zonation of propionate concentrations (Fig. 5, upper curve) was less pronounced than in perfusions with octanoate, but the profiles were not significantly different. Second, the distribution of label between the two acetyl moieties of C4 ketone bodies depends on whether label enters the HMG-CoA cycle as acetyl-CoA or as the C-3 + 4 moiety of AcAc-CoA (Fig. 1). The latter is formed in one of the final steps of fatty acid β-oxidation. Hüth et al. (25Hüth W. Dierich C. von Oeynhausen V. Seubert W. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1973; 354: 635-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) has shown that in the reversible reaction catalyzed by 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (AcAc-CoA + CoA ↔ 2 acetyl-CoA (Fig. 1 (left side), reaction 1), the C-3 + 4 moiety of AcAc-CoA exchanges much more slowly with the free acetyl-CoA pool than its C-1 + 2 moiety. For livers perfused with increasing concentrations of [1-13C]octanoate or [8-13C]octanoate, Figs. 6, A and B, show the labeling of BHB, its acetyl moieties, and liver acetyl-CoA. We calculated the distribution of label between the two acetyl moieties of C4 ketone bodies from the electron ionization mass spectrum of the TBDMS derivative of BHB, which includes ions corresponding to carbons 1–4 and carbons 3 and 4 of BHB (21Des Rosiers C. Montgomery J.A. Desrochers S. Garneau M. David F. Mamer O.A. Brunengraber H. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 173: 96-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The two acetyl moieties of BHB had very different labeling. In the presence of [1-13C]octanoate, most of the label of BHB was on the C-1 + 2 acetyl, with relatively little label on the C-3 + 4 acetyl (Fig. 6A). The opposite labeling pattern of BHB was observed in perfusions with [8-13C]octanoate, where 90% of the BHB labeling was on the C-3 + 4 acetyl, the labeling of which plateaued at 37%. This results from the fact that the C-3 + 4 acetyl of BHB derives from the C-7 + 8 acetyl of octanoate via the C-3 + 4 acetyl of AcAc-CoA. Because the C-3 + 4 acetyl of AcAc-CoA exchanges poorly with the free acetyl-CoA pool, the two acetyl moieties of BHB have very unequal labeling. Katz (29Katz J. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 248: R391-R399PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that the labeling of C-1 + 2 of BHB could be taken as a proxy, i.e. an indicator, of that of liver mitochondrial acetyl-CoA. Fig. 6A shows that in the presence of [1-13C]octanoate, the enrichment of acetyl-CoA plateaued close to 25%, which is the maximal possible enrichment because [1-13C]octanoate was labeled on only one acetyl moiety. At high [1-13C]octanoate concentrations, the labeling of acetyl-CoA and of the C-1 + 2 acetyl of BHB were very close. However, at low [1-13C]octanoate concentrations (0.1–0.2 mm), the C-1 + 2 acetyl of BHB was much more labeled than acetyl-CoA. There are two possible explanations of this discrepancy: metabolic zonation (28Jungermann K. Kietzmann T. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1996; 16: 179-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) and/or metabolic channeling (30Srere P.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 89-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2025777743,"The ability of Escherichia coli to grow on a series of acetylated and glycosylated compounds has been investigated. It is surmised that E. coli maintains low levels of nonspecific esterase activity. This observation may have ramifications for previous reports that relied on nonspecific esterases from E. coli to genetically encode nonnatural amino acids. It had been reported that nonspecific esterases from E. coli deacetylate tri-acetyl O-linked glycosylated serine and threonine in vivo. The glycosylated amino acids were reported to have been genetically encoded into proteins in response to the amber stop codon. However, it is our contention that such amino acids are not utilized in this manner within E. coli. The current results report in vitro analysis of the original enzyme and an in vivo analysis of a glycosylated amino acid. It is concluded that the amber suppression method with nonnatural amino acids may require a caveat for use in certain instances."

However, little is known about the mechanisms by which thousands of Gag molecules are targeted to the plasma membrane. Using a bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay, we recently reported that the cellular sites and efficiency of HIV-1 Gag assembly depend on the precise pathway of Gag mRNA export from the nucleus, known to be mediated by Rev. Here we describe an assembly deficiency in human cells for HIV Gag whose expression depends on hepatitis B virus (HBV) post-transcriptional regulatory element (PRE) mediated-mRNA nuclear export. PRE-dependent HIV Gag expressed well in human cells, but assembled with slower kinetics, accumulated intracellularly, and failed to associate with a lipid raft compartment where the wild-type Rev-dependent HIV-1 Gag efficiently assembles. Surprisingly, assembly and budding of PRE-dependent HIV Gag in human cells could be rescued in trans by co-expression of Rev-dependent Gag that provides correct membrane targeting signals, or in cis by replacing HIV matrix (MA) with other membrane targeting domains. Taken together, our results demonstrate deficient membrane targeting of PRE-dependent HIV-1 Gag and suggest that HIV MA function is regulated by the trafficking pathway of the encoding mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W2036426345,"Proinflammatory NF-kappaB activation requires the IkappaB (inhibitor of NF-kappaB) kinase (IKK) complex that contains two catalytic subunits named IKKalpha and IKKbeta and a regulatory subunit named NF-kappaB essential modulator (NEMO). NEMO and IKKbeta are essential for tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced NF-kappaB activation, and we recently demonstrated that NEMO and IKKalpha are sufficient for interleukin (IL)-1-induced signaling. IKKalpha and IKKbeta both contain a functional NEMO-binding domain (NBD); however, the role of NEMO association with each kinase in NF-kappaB signaling and IKK complex formation remains unclear. To address this question, we stably reconstituted IKKalpha(-/-) and IKKbeta(-/-) murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) with wild-type (WT) or NBD-deficient (DeltaNBD) versions of IKKalpha and IKKbeta, respectively. TNF-induced classical NF-kappaB activation in IKKbeta(-/-) MEFs was rescued by IKKbeta(WT) but not IKKbeta(DeltaNBD), whereas neither IKKbeta(WT) nor IKKbeta(DeltaNBD) affected IL-1-induced NF-kappaB signaling. As previously described, classical NF-kappaB transcriptional activity was absent in IKKalpha(-/-) cells. Reconstitution with either IKKalpha(WT) or IKKalpha(DeltaNBD) rescued both IL-1 and TNF-induced transcription, demonstrating that NEMO association is not required for IKKalpha-dependent regulation of NF-kappaB-dependent transcription. Stably expressed IKKalpha(WT) or IKKbeta(WT) associated with endogenous IKKs and NEMO in IKKalpha(-/-) or IKKbeta(-/-) MEFs, respectively, resulting in formation of the heterotrimeric IKKalpha-IKKbeta-NEMO complex. In contrast, although the IKKalpha(DeltaNBD) and IKKbeta(DeltaNBD) mutants associated with endogenous IKKs containing an NBD, these dimeric endogenous IKK-IKK(DeltaNBD) complexes did not associate with NEMO. These findings therefore demonstrate that formation of the heterotrimeric IKKalpha-IKKbeta-NEMO holocomplex absolutely requires two intact NEMO-binding domains."
https://openalex.org/W2119393900,"The most recently characterized H4 histamine receptor (H4R) is expressed preferentially in the bone marrow, raising the question of its role during hematopoiesis. Here we show that both murine and human progenitor cell populations express this receptor subtype on transcriptional and protein levels and respond to its agonists by reduced growth factor-induced cell cycle progression that leads to decreased myeloid, erythroid and lymphoid colony formation. H4R activation prevents the induction of cell cycle genes through a cAMP/PKA-dependent pathway that is not associated with apoptosis. It is mediated specifically through H4R signaling since gene silencing or treatment with selective antagonists restores normal cell cycle progression. The arrest of growth factor-induced G1/S transition protects murine and human progenitor cells from the toxicity of the cell cycle-dependent anticancer drug Ara-C in vitro and reduces aplasia in a murine model of chemotherapy. This first evidence for functional H4R expression in hematopoietic progenitors opens new therapeutic perspectives for alleviating hematotoxic side effects of antineoplastic drugs."

Here, we tested the hypothesis that PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-dependent recruitment mediated by the first PH domain of ARAP1 regulates the in vivo and in vitro function of ARAP1.

However, PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 binding to the PH domain stimulated GAP activity and was required for in vivo function of ARAP1 as a regulator of endocytic trafficking of the EGFR.

The function of the tandem PH domains in the ARAPs has not been examined. Here we investigated the role of the first two PH domains of ARAP1 for catalysis and in vivo function. The first PH domain fits the consensus sequence for PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 binding (33Lietzke S.E. Bose S. Cronin T. Klarlund J. Chawla A. Czech M.P. Lambright D.G. Mol.

The second does not fit a phosphoinositide binding consensus but is immediately N-terminal to the GAP domain. We have previously reported that the PH domain that occurs immediately N-terminal of the Arf GAP domain of ASAP1 is critical for the catalytic function of the protein (38Luo R. Miller Jenkins L.M. Randazzo P.A. Gruschus J. Cell. Signal. 2008; 20: 1968-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 39Luo R. Ahvazi B. Amariei D. Shroder D. Burrola B. Losert W. Randazzo P.A. Biochem. J. 2007; 402: 439-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We tested the hypothesis that the two PH domains of ARAP1 function independently; one recruits ARAP1 to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-rich membranes, and the other functions with the catalytic domain. As predicted, PH1 interacted specifically with PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, and PH2 did not. However, both PH domains contributed to catalysis independently of recruitment to membranes. None of the PH domains in ARAP1 mediated PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-dependent targeting to plasma membranes (PM). PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 stimulated GAP activity, and the ability to bind PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 was required for ARAP1 to regulate membrane traffic. We propose that ARAP1 is recruited independently of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 to the PM where PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 subsequently regulates its GAP activity to control endocytic events. The cDNA fragments encoding the proteins described in Fig. 1 were cloned into NdeI and BamHI sites of the pET-19b bacterial expression vector (Novagen). The cDNA fragment encoding for PH1, PH2, PH1-PH2, PH3, PH4, or PH3-PH4 was cloned into the XhoI and BamHI sites of the mammalian expression vector pEGFP-C1 (Clontech). Point mutations were introduced using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions and confirmed by DNA sequencing. An expression vector for a chimeric protein consisting of the PH domain of PLCδ (residues 1–134 (40Várnai P. Balla T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar)) followed by the PH2, ArfGAP, and Ank motifs of ARAP1 or the ArfGAP and Ank motifs of ARAP1 (see Fig. 1) was constructed by amplifying the open reading frame (ORF) encoding residues 427–742 or residues 524–742 of ARAP1 with NdeI and SalI restriction sites on the 5′-end of the ORF and BamHI site at the 3′-end. This DNA was ligated into pET-19b using the NdeI and BamHI sites. The ORF encoding residues 1–134 of PLCδ was amplified incorporating NdeI restriction sites on the 5′-end of the ORF and SalI and BamHI restriction sites on the 3′-end. This DNA was ligated into pET-19b using the NdeI and BamHI sites. After restriction digestion with SalI and BamHI, the ARAP1 fragments were ligated into the vector containing the PH domain of PLCδ digested with SalI and BamHI. A plasmid for the expression of GFP-tagged Rab5 in mammalian cells was a generous gift from Juan Bonifacino (NICHD, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). To obtain myristoylated Arf5, human Arf5 was coexpressed with N-myristoyltransferase in Escherichia coli as described for Arf1 and Arf6 (41Randazzo P.A. Kahn R.A.

Briefly, the purified recombinant proteins (500 nm or 1 μm) were incubated with sucrose-loaded LUVs containing 500 μm or 1 mm total phospholipids for 5 min at 30 °C. The LUVs were precipitated by ultracentrifugation at 75,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The proteins that precipitated with LUVs were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. The signal was quantified by densitometry using Scion Image software. HeLa and COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at constant humidity. Cells were plated 1 day before transfection. For the experiments to examine protein localization, HeLa cells were transfected with plasmids using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. COS-7 cells were transfected with plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For RNA interference assays, HeLa cells were transfected for 48 h with 19 nucleotide siRNA duplexes with 3′-UU overhangs specific for the 3′ untranslated region (5′-GUUCAGACCUCUUGGCCCAUU-3′) and the ORF (ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool) of human ARAP1 (GenBankTM accession number NM_139181) from Dharmacon. siCONTROL non-targeting siRNA 2 (Dharmacon) was used as a negative control. RNA interference transfections were performed using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Endogenous ARAP1 was replaced with recombinant ARAP1 by first treating cells with siRNA and then, 48 h later, transfecting the cells with a plasmid for expression of ARAP1 using Lipofectamine 2000. The cells were used 24 h after the second transfection. Cells grown on glass coverslips coated with 10 μg/ml fibronectin (F1141, Sigma) were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), blocked, and lysed with 0.2% Triton X-100 and 10% fetal bovine serum in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were incubated with primary antibody anti-FLAG M5 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) diluted in 3% fetal bovine serum and 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed twice with PBS, blocked for 5 min, and incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch), diluted as described previously, for 50 min. For EGF uptake experiment, HeLa cells were plated on glass coverslips in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum overnight and serum-starved for 1h at 37 °C in prewarmed uptake Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were then incubated with1 μg/ml Alexa488-EGF (Molecular Probe) for 30 min on ice in ice-cold serum-free uptake medium and washed once in ice-cold PBS. Cells in prewarmed uptake medium were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. The cells were cooled rapidly at 4 °C and incubated with ice-cold acetic acid buffer (pH 3.5) in ice-water for 2 min to remove fluorescence-conjugated reagents remaining at the cell surface. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS before being fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde. All preparations were analyzed using a Zeiss LSM510-Meta laser-scanning confocal microscope with a ×63, 1.4 NA Plan Neofluar oil immersion lens. Images were processed using the Zeiss LSM 5 image software. Pearson's coefficients were determined for 30 cells under each condition using Imarisx64 software. To determine the Pearson's coefficients for the images presented in Fig. 10, thresholds were set to exclude ARAP1 localized in the cytoplasm. The same threshold was applied between cells stimulated or not with EGF in one group. Association of protein with the cell edge was determined by visual inspection. COS-7 cells were plated on glass coverslips (3 × 105 cells/35-mm dish) and 1 day after seeding were transfected with the indicated constructs (1 μg of DNA total/dish) using Lipofectamine 2000 for 24 h. Coverslips were mounted in metal Atto chambers (Invitrogen), and cells were incubated in a modified Krebs-Ringer buffer containing 120 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 0.7 mm MgSO4, 10 mm glucose, Na-Hepes 10 mm, pH 7.4. Confocal analysis was performed at 35 °C using a Zeiss LSM510-Meta confocal microscope. Post-acquisition processing was done using Adobe Photoshop to utilize the whole dynamic range of the image, but no change in the linearity was allowed. COS-7 cells were transfected with plasmids directing expression of GFP-tagged Arf proteins and FLAG-tagged ARAP1 as indicated. 24 h after transfection, cellular levels of Arf·GTP proteins were determined as described (50Yoon H.Y. Bonifacino J.S. Randazzo P.A. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 404: 316-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified recombinant GST-VHS-GATGGA3 (10 μg) were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare) for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes with ice-cold PBS, the immobilized GST fusion proteins were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with equal amounts of lysates from COS-7 cells. The beads were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with ice-cold PBS. Proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and detected by standard immunoblotting methods using mouse anti-GFP (Covance, MMS-118P) and rabbit anti-FLAG (Sigma, F7425) antisera. Signals from the immunoblots were quantified by densitometric scanning and plotted as the ratio of Arf·GTP level to the Arf·GTP level in control cells. Arf GAP assays, in which hydrolysis of [α32P]GTP bound to Arf is measured, have been described previously (45Che M.M. Nie Z.Z. Randazzo P.A.

Anti-Hsc70 antibody used to detect protein loading was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Protein concentrations were estimated using the Bio-Rad assay. 1,2-Dioctanoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phosphoinositol-3,4,5-trisphoshate] (dioctanoyl PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) and d-myo-inositol-1,3,4,5-tetraphosphate (IP4) were from Avanti Polar Lipids. Circular dichroism spectra were collected using a Jasco J720 CD spectropolarimeter for ARAP1 recombinant proteins diluted to 4 μm in PBS. Bacterially expressed recombinant ARAP1 has not been characterized previously. We expressed and purified ARAP1-(307–742) (henceforth referred to as PH1-Ank), composed of the PH1, PH2, Arf GAP, and Ank repeats (see Fig. 1A for schematic of proteins used in this article) to study the function of the first set of tandem PH domains. LUVs containing the indicated phosphoinositides were incubated with PH1-Ank and rapidly separated from bulk solution by centrifugation. ARAP1 specifically associated with vesicles containing PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and PtdIns(3,4)P2 (Fig. 1B). The Kd for the ARAP1·PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 complex, determined by titrating PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 into the binding reaction, was estimated to be 1.6 ± 0.3 μm (mean ± S.E., 13 experiments), which is similar to the concentration of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 for half-maximal stimulation of GAP activity (Table 1). The binding of ARAP1-(524–742) (henceforth called ArfGAP-Ank), composed of the Arf GAP and Ank repeat domains and lacking the PH domains, to vesicles was not significantly affected by PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (Fig. 1C). A recombinant protein that contained the second PH domain but not the first was not stable when expressed in bacteria.TABLE 1ARAP1 PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-dependent Arf GAP activity and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-ARAP1 associationRecombinant proteinPtdIns(3,4,5)P3 dependence of enzymatic activity, EC50Lipid-protein association, KdμmμmPH1-Ank1.6 ± 0.1 (7)1.6 ± 0.3 (13)ArfGAP-Ank>7.5 (3)>10 (3)[K336N]PH1-Ank>7.5 (3)>10 (4)[K347N]PH1-Ank4.1 ± 1.7 (3)0.5 ± 0.2 (4)[R348Q]PH1-Ank>7.5 (3)>10 (4)[R351Q]PH1-Ank1.9 ± 0.4 (3)0.4 ± 0.1 (3)[R450Q]PH1-Ank1.7 ± 0.4 (3)2.0 ± 0.4 (3)[K453N]PH1-Ank2.7 ± 1.4 (3)1.9 ± 0.4 (3)[K455N]PH1-Ank1.0 ± 0.2 (3)1.1 ± 0.1 (3) Open table in a new tab We examined the contribution of each PH domain to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 binding. The PH domains of ARAP1 were aligned with PH domains known to bind PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (Fig. 2A) to identify residues that might be involved in PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 binding. The effect of mutating the residues in PH1-Ank on binding to LUVs containing PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 was determined. Introduction of the mutations did not affect the circular dichroism spectra, indicating no gross changes in secondary structures (shown for [K336N] and [R348Q] in Fig. 2B). Two mutants, [K336N] and [R348Q], with changes in PH1 did not bind as efficiently as wild type PH1 (Fig. 2C and Table 1). Changes introduced into PH2 had less of an effect on binding to LUVs, although two mutations, [K453N] and [K455N], reduced the maximum protein binding by about 30% (Fig. 2D and Table 1). We further characterized the PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-dependent GAP activity of ARAP1. We started by determining the substrate specificity, which had not been examined previously for bacterially expressed recombinant AR"

Notably, TNF-alpha was shown to potentiate neuronal Ca(2+) signaling by enhancing type-1 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP(3)R) steady-state mRNA levels. In the present study, we sought to determine the promoter region ultimately responsive to TNF-alpha exposure. We report that a sequence encompassing a specificity protein 1 (SP-1) binding site is necessary for TNF-alpha regulation. Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis demonstrated specific binding to this sequence, while site-directed mutagenesis of this site abrogated both JNK-mediated regulation as well as transcription factor binding. Expression of a dominant-negative SP-1 eliminated both the enhanced promoter activity and the elevated IP(3)R-mediated Ca(2+) signals observed with TNF-alpha exposure. Overall, these data delineate a key pathway by which TNF-alpha in a neuronal environment modulates IP(3)R expression and intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W1972625565,"Background The phylogeny of the indigenous Indian-specific mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroups have been determined and refined in previous reports. Similar to mtDNA superhaplogroups M and N, a profusion of reports are also available for superhaplogroup R. However, there is a dearth of information on South Asian subhaplogroups in particular, including R8. Therefore, we ought to access the genealogy and pre-historic expansion of haplogroup R8 which is considered one of the autochthonous lineages of South Asia. Methodology/Principal Findings Upon screening the mtDNA of 5,836 individuals belonging to 104 distinct ethnic populations of the Indian subcontinent, we found 54 individuals with the HVS-I motif that defines the R8 haplogroup. Complete mtDNA sequencing of these 54 individuals revealed two deep-rooted subclades: R8a and R8b. Furthermore, these subclades split into several fine subclades. An isofrequency contour map detected the highest frequency of R8 in the state of Orissa. Spearman's rank correlation analysis suggests significant correlation of R8 occurrence with geography. Conclusions/Significance The coalescent age of newly-characterized subclades of R8, R8a (15.4±7.2 Kya) and R8b (25.7±10.2 Kya) indicates that the initial maternal colonization of this haplogroup occurred during the middle and upper Paleolithic period, roughly around 40 to 45 Kya. These results signify that the southern part of Orissa currently inhabited by Munda speakers is likely the origin of these autochthonous maternal deep-rooted haplogroups. Our high-resolution study on the genesis of R8 haplogroup provides ample evidence of its deep-rooted ancestry among the Orissa (Austro-Asiatic) tribes."

Immunopathol. 2000; 22: 239-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) showed that the CDR loops οf γδ TCR, predominantly germline-encoded residues of the complementary determining region of human TCRδ (CDR3δ), are in direct contact with T22, suggesting that the primary sequence of CDR3 in γδ TCR, especially CDR3δ, serves as a key determinant for the specificity of antigen recognition. Our recent finding that CDR3δ peptide mimics human γδ TCR binding to tumor cells and tissues is consistent with the role of CDR3δ in γδ TCR recognition (6Xu C. Zhang H. Hu H. He H. Wang Z. Xu Y. Chen H. Cao W. Zhang S. Cui L. Ba D. He W. Mol. Immunol. 2007; 44: 302-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).Based on this finding, we used synthesized CDR3δ peptide as a probe to screen putative protein ligands in tumor protein extracts by affinity chromatography analysis. With this novel strategy, we have successfully identified seven tumor-related epitopes, two hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection-related antigenic epitopes, and two self proteins including heat shock protein (HSP) 60 and human mutS homolog 2 (hMSH2) that are recognized by human γδ TCR (7Chen H.

These results further support that the primary sequence of CDR3δ in γδ TCR determine the specificity of antigen binding.CDR3δ is composed of fragments derived from V, N-D-N, and J gene segments. The flanking sequences composed of V and J fragment is conserved while N-D-N region is diverse. The diversity of γδ TCRs is supposedly higher than that of TCRαβ due to the link of D gene fragment and the insertion of nucleotide acids (8McVay L.D. Jaswal S.S. Kennedy C. Hayday A. Carding S.R. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5851-5860PubMed Google Scholar). However, the number of identified antigenic ligands recognized by γδ TCR remains very limited. It has been demonstrated that γδ TCR recognizes some protein antigens and small phosphate or amine-containing compounds, including nonclassical MHC class I molecule T22 and T10 in mice (9Shin S. El-Diwany R. Schaffert S. Adams E.J. Garcia K.C. Pereira P. Chien Y.H. Science. 2005; 308: 252-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), UL-16-binding protein (ULBP) (10Cao W. He W.

Nevertheless, important questions regarding γδ TCR recognition remain to be addressed. For example, given the seemingly high diversity of γδ TCR, why have only limited antigenic ligands been identified? What are the contributions of individual fragments of CDR3δ to antigen recognition? In αβ TCR, a single mutation in D gene fragment (12Brawley J.V. Concannon P. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 4946-4952PubMed Google Scholar) abolishes its antigenic recognition, whereas the contribution of the different fragments in γδ TCR recognition remain unknown. Answers to these questions will shed important insights to antigen recognition of γδ T cells.In this study, we investigated the contribution of individual fragments of CDR3δ in antigen recognition. We mutated V, N-D-N, or J fragments of a Vδ2 TCR CDR3 sequence (OT3) in peptide and engineered γδ TCR. We found that the conserved flanking regions of CDR3δ play a critical role in antigenic binding to OEC cells/tissues or hMSH2 protein, a new ligand for γδTCR we found recently (7Chen H. He X. Wang Z. Wu D. Zhang H. Xu C. He H. Cui L. Ba D. He W. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 12528-12537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have identified the cysteine residue in V fragment and the leucine residue in J fragment as critical residues in the binding activity of γδ TCR. These results demonstrate that TCRδ chain uses the conserved flanking regions to recognize their antigens, suggesting that ligands for γδ ΤCR may also be conserved and limited in number.DISCUSSIONAlthough γδ TCRs have been identified for more than 20 years, their known ligands are still very limited in number. It is not clear why this is the case. Our data here may provide a possible explanation: γδ TCRs critically depend on their conserved regions to recognize ligands, and the limited diversity in these regions correspond to a limited number of γδ T cell ligands.We have applied three approaches to determine the functional importance of the individual fragment of CDR3δ. First, we used wild-type CDR3δ2and its V/D/J mutant peptides to examine their ligand binding capabilities. Mutation in the V or J fragment dramatically impaired their staining capability to tumor cells or tissues, as well as hMSH2, a ligand for γ9/δ2 TCR. Mutation in N-D-N region did not affect its binding to the same target. Second, we generated cells which expressed γδ TCRs containing wild-type CDR3δ2 or its V/D/J mutants and examined their antigen recognition capability. Mutation in the V or J fragment impaired the binding capability of transfected cells expressing γδ TCR, while mutation in the N-D-N fragment did not have this effect. Third, we examined γδ TCR recognition using engineered chimeric proteins containing the extracellular domains of the human γ9 and δ2 chains with the CDR3δ2 or its V/D/J mutants. Again, the results suggest that the V and J but not D region contribute critically to γδ TCR recognition. We also identified cysteine in the V fragment or leucine in the J fragment is the critical determinant in γδ TCR antigen recognition of antigen. Taken together, this evidence strongly suggests that the conserved flanking sequences of the CDR3δ domain play a key role in determining antigen binding activity.The results of Adams et al. (13Adams E.J. Chien Y.H. Garcia K.C. Science. 2005; 308: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the D gene segment is responsible for binding to T22 antigen for G8 γδ T cells. Our results showed that the V/J segments of TCR δ are responsible for binding to γδ TCR. The contradiction may be explained by two differences: first, the antigen recognized by γδ TCR derived from human and mice was different. T22 was the antigen originating from mouse γδ TCR with the OT3 sequence recognizing the human antigen. Second, the length of γδ TCR CDR3 from human and mice was different. The length of mice γδ TCR CDR3 was shorter than that of human. So our conclusion was that for tumor peptide antigen, V/J segments of TCR δ, but not the D gene segment, are responsible for binding to γδ TCR.Our results have revealed an important aspect of γδ TCR antigenic recognition. All heterodimers of αβ TCR, γδ TCR, and BCR are products of rearranging genetic segments. At the first glance, these three receptors are similar in structure and genetic composition. However, the mechanisms of diversity formation are quite different. Because of a large number of gene segments, the diversity of antibodies relies to a large extent on V, D, and J gene rearrangement (14Koralov S.B. Novobrantseva T.I. Königsmann J. Ehlich A. Rajewsky K. Immunity. 2006; 25: 43-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). By contrast, there are only a few V, (D), and J segments encoding the αβ TCR, so the use of D segments and N region addition greatly increase the available diversity of αβ TCR (15Yao X.S. Diao Y. Sun W.B. Luo J.M. Qin M. Tang X.Y. Cell Mol. Immunol. 2007; 4: 215-220PubMed Google Scholar). There are even fewer V, D, and J segments that encode the γδ TCR. The potential diversity of γδ TCR comes primarily from the use of Dδ segments in all their reading frames, and N region addition at three different positions. Comparing to 1015 for the αβ TCR repertoire, the total potential repertoire of γδ TCR is about 1018 of junctional diversity; however, to date only a handful of ligands for γδ TCR have been identified. It appears paradoxical that a huge potential repertoire of γδ TCR only recognizes a few ligands unless the potential repertoire is not utilized for the generation of specificity. Alternatively, the N-D-N fragment in γδTCR may not play a critical role in determining antigen specificity. Our data clearly support the second possibility. The flanking sequences encoded by V and J fragments are more important in antigen recognition, since the mutation of V and J portion of the CDR3δ almost completely abolished their binding to tumor cells or tissues, while mutation of N-D-N residues minimally affected γδ TCR antigen recognition. Based on our results, we postulate that the flanking sequences may act as “rough-adjusters” for antigen recognition, while the highly diverse fragment of N-D-N may serve to fine-tune the affinity of γδ TCR to certain antigens. Our finding supports the notion that the conserved fragment within CDR3δ and the flanking sequences form a broad specificity to “rough-see” the molecules induced by stressful stimuli such as tumorigenesis or infection by recognizing that limited epitopes existed in these molecules. With evolution, such a “rough-see” way connects with “fine-see” way of αβ T cells and B cells by delivery of co-stimulator signals. Both αβ T cells and B cells are capable of distinguishing precisely a tiny and unique difference (epitope) in a given antigen from those of numerous foreign antigens. This very narrow specificity is based on the high diversities of antigen-receptor repertoires.γδ TCR recognition may behave more similar to pattern recognition by innate immune cells. Macrophages and DCs can recognize non-self structures such as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by pattern recognition receptor (PRR) such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) (16Takeda K. Kaisho T. Akira S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 335-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (4690) Google Scholar). More recent studies strongly emphasize the innate features and functions of γδ T cells, including the participation in wound healing (17Li Z. Burns A.R. Rumbaut R.E. Smith C.W. Am. J. Pathol. 2007; 171: 838-845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), tissue repair (18Koohsari H. Tamaoka M. Campbell H.R. Martin J.G. Respir Res. 2007; 8: 21Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and the ability to present antigen (19Brandes M. Willimann K. Moser B. Science. 2005; 309: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 20Moser B. Brandes M. Trends Immunol. 2006; 27: 112-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Previously, we have used CDR3 peptide as probe to pan twelve peptide libraries. Nine peptides as putative epitopes were identified, among which seven were tumor-related and two were HBV infection-related. BLAST searches revealed that most matched proteins were conserved proteins of prokaryotes (7Chen H. He X. Wang Z. Wu D. Zhang H. Xu C. He H. Cui L. Ba D. He W. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 12528-12537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Results suggest the possibility that γδ TCR recognizes some conserved molecules. During the recognition, the flanking sequences within CDR3δ, the conserved fragment of γδ TCR, might recognize readily their ligands via a pattern recognition model. Our finding may provide an explanation for the limited number of γδ TCR ligands that have as yet been identified.

Both αβ T cells and B cells are capable of distinguishing precisely a tiny and unique difference (epitope) in a given antigen from those of numerous foreign antigens. This very narrow specificity is based on the high diversities of antigen-receptor repertoires.γδ TCR recognition may behave more similar to pattern recognition by innate immune cells. Macrophages and DCs can recognize non-self structures such as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by pattern recognition receptor (PRR) such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) (16Takeda K. Kaisho T. Akira S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 335-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (4690) Google Scholar). More recent studies strongly emphasize the innate features and functions of γδ T cells, including the participation in wound healing (17Li Z. Burns A.R. Rumbaut R.E. Smith C.W. Am. J. Pathol. 2007; 171: 838-845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), tissue repair (18Koohsari H. Tamaoka M. Campbell H.R. Martin J.G. Respir Res. 2007; 8: 21Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and the ability to present antigen (19Brandes M. Willimann K. Moser B. Science. 2005; 309: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 20Moser B. Brandes M. Trends Immunol. 2006; 27: 112-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Previously, we have used CDR3 peptide as probe to pan twelve peptide libraries. Nine peptides as putative epitopes were identified, among which seven were tumor-related and two were HBV infection-related. BLAST searches revealed that most matched proteins were conserved proteins of prokaryotes (7Chen H. He X. Wang Z. Wu D. Zhang H. Xu C. He H. Cui L. Ba D. He W. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 12528-12537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Results suggest the possibility that γδ TCR recognizes some conserved molecules. During the recognition, the flanking sequences within CDR3δ, the conserved fragment of γδ TCR, might recognize readily their ligands via a pattern recognition model. Our finding may provide an explanation for the limited number of γδ TCR ligands that have as yet been identified. Although γδ TCRs have been identified for more than 20 years, their known ligands are still very limited in number. It is not clear why this is the case. Our data here may provide a possible explanation: γδ TCRs critically depend on their conserved regions to recognize ligands, and the limited diversity in these regions correspond to a limited number of γδ T cell ligands. We have applied three approaches to determine the functional importance of the individual fragment of CDR3δ. First, we used wild-type CDR3δ2and its V/D/J mutant peptides to examine their ligand binding capabilities. Mutation in the V or J fragment dramatically impaired their staining capability to tumor cells or tissues, as well as hMSH2, a ligand for γ9/δ2 TCR. Mutation in N-D-N region did not affect its binding to the same target. Second, we generated cells which expressed γδ TCRs containing wild-type CDR3δ2 or its V/D/J mutants and examined their antigen recognition capability. Mutation in the V or J fragment impaired the binding capability of transfected cells expressing γδ TCR, while mutation in the N-D-N fragment did not have this effect. Third, we examined γδ TCR recognition using engineered chimeric proteins containing the extracellular domains of the human γ9 and δ2 chains with the CDR3δ2 or its V/D/J mutants. Again, the results suggest that the V and J but not D region contribute critically to γδ TCR recognition. We also identified cysteine in the V fragment or leucine in the J fragment is the critical determinant in γδ TCR antigen recognition of antigen. Taken together, this evidence strongly suggests that the conserved flanking sequences of the CDR3δ domain play a key role in determining antigen binding activity. The results of Adams et al. (13Adams E.J. Chien Y.H. Garcia K.C. Science. 2005; 308: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the D gene segment is responsible for binding to T22 antigen for G8 γδ T cells. Our results showed that the V/J segments of TCR δ are responsible for binding to γδ TCR. The contradiction may be explained by two differences: first, the antigen recognized by γδ TCR derived from human and mice was different. T22 was the antigen originating from mouse γδ TCR with the OT3 sequence recognizing the human antigen. Second, the length of γδ TCR CDR3 from human and mice was different. The length of mice γδ TCR CDR3 was shorter than that of human. So our conclusion was that for tumor peptide antigen, V/J segments of TCR δ, but not the D gene segment, are responsible for binding to γδ TCR. Our results have revealed an important aspect of γδ TCR antigenic recognition. All heterodimers of αβ TCR, γδ TCR, and BCR are products of rearranging genetic segments. At the first glance, these three receptors are similar in structure and genetic composition. However, the mechanisms of diversity formation are quite different. Because of a large number of gene segments, the diversity of antibodies relies to a large extent on V, D, and J gene rearrangement (14Koralov S.B. Novobrantseva T.I. Königsmann J. Ehlich A. Rajewsky K. Immunity. 2006; 25: 43-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). By contrast, there are only a few V, (D), and J segments encoding the αβ TCR, so the use of D segments and N region addition greatly increase the available diversity of αβ TCR (15Yao X.S. Diao Y. Sun W.B. Luo J.M. Qin M. Tang X.Y. Cell Mol. Immunol. 2007; 4: 215-220PubMed Google Scholar). There are even fewer V, D, and J segments that encode the γδ TCR. The potential diversity of γδ TCR comes primarily from the use of Dδ segments in all their reading frames, and N region addition at three different positions. Comparing to 1015 for the αβ TCR repertoire, the total potential repertoire of γδ TCR is about 1018 of junctional diversity; however, to date only a handful of ligands for γδ TCR have been identified. It appears paradoxical that a huge potential repertoire of γδ TCR only recognizes a few ligands unless the potential repertoire is not utilized for the generation of specificity. Alternatively, the N-D-N fragment in γδTCR may not play a critical role in determining antigen specificity. Our data clearly support the second possibility. The flanking sequences encoded by V and J fragments are more important in antigen recognition, since the mutation of V and J portion of the CDR3δ almost completely abolished their binding to tumor cells or tissues, while mutation of N-D-N residues minimally affected γδ TCR antigen recognition. Based on our results, we postulate that the flanking sequences may act as “rough-adjusters” for antigen recognition, while the highly diverse fragment of N-D-N may serve to fine-tune the affinity of γδ TCR to certain antigens. Our finding supports the notion that the conserved fragment within CDR3δ and the flanking sequences form a broad specificity to “rough-see” the molecules induced by stressful stimuli such as tumorigenesis or infection by recognizing that limited epitopes existed in these molecules. With evolution, such a “rough-see” way connects with “fine-see” way of αβ T cells and B cells by delivery of co-stimulator signals.

https://openalex.org/W1986928472,"Fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) are important for many different mechanisms, including cell migration, proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Here, we show a new link between FGFR1 and the cell adhesion molecule neurofascin, which is important for neurite outgrowth. After overexpression in HEK293 cells, embryonal neurofascin isoform NF166 was able to associate with FGFR1, whereas the adult isoform NF186, differing from NF166 in additional extracellular sequences, was deficient. Pharmacological inhibitors and overexpression of dominant negative components of the FGFR signaling pathway pointed to the activation of FGFR1 after association with neurofascin in neurite outgrowth assays in chick tectal neurons and rat PC12-E2 cells. Both extra- and intracellular domains of embryonal neurofascin isoform NF166 were able to form complexes with FGFR1 independently. However, the cytosolic domain was both necessary and sufficient for the activation of FGFR1. Cytosolic serine residues 56 and 100 were shown to be essential for the neurite outgrowth-promoting activity of neurofascin, whereas both amino acid residues were dispensable for FGFR1 association. In conclusion, the data suggest a neurofascin intracellular domain, which activates FGFR1 for neurite outgrowth, whereas the extracellular domain functions as an additional, regulatory FGFR1 interaction domain in the course of development."
https://openalex.org/W2122277143,"The precise regulation and maintenance of balance between cell proliferation, differentiation and death in metazoan are critical for tissue homeostasis. CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha) has been implicated as a key regulator of differentiation and proliferation in various cell types. Here we investigated the potential dynamic change and role of C/EBPalpha protein during apoptosis induction.Upon onset of apoptosis induced by various kinds of inducers such as NSC606985, etoposide and others, C/EBPalpha expression presented a profound down-regulation in leukemic cell lines and primary cells via induction of protein degradation and inhibition of transcription, as assessed respectively by cycloheximide inhibition test, real-time quantitative RT-PCR and luciferase reporter assay. Applying chemical inhibition, forced expression of dominant negative mutant and catalytic fragment (CF) of protein kinase Cdelta (PKCdelta), which was proteolytically activated during apoptosis induction tested, we showed that the active PKCdelta protein contributed to the increased degradation of C/EBPalpha protein. Three specific proteasome inhibitors antagonized C/EBPalpha degradation during apoptosis induction. More importantly, ectopic expression of PKCdelta-CF stimulated the ubiquitination of C/EBPalpha protein, while the chemical inhibition of PKCdelta action significantly inhibited the enhanced ubiquitination of C/EBPalpha protein under NSC606985 treatment. Additionally, silencing of C/EBPalpha expression by small interfering RNAs enhanced, while inducible expression of C/EBPalpha inhibited NSC606985/etoposide-induced apoptosis in leukemic cells.These observations indicate that the activation of PKCdelta upon apoptosis results in the increased proteasome-dependent degradation of C/EBPalpha, which partially contributes to PKCdelta-mediated apoptosis."

Published online July 5, 2009)https://doi.org/10.1038/nature08195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar now link the function of miRNAs to smooth muscle cell (SMC) fate determination and plasticity by showing that miR-143 and miR-145 regulate the proliferation and differentiation of vascular SMCs. During the early embryonic stages of vasculogenesis, SMCs and their progenitors are highly proliferative and migratory. However, in adult blood vessels, SMCs become quiescent and express a repertoire of contractile, calcium regulatory, and signal transduction proteins necessary for the contractile function of fully differentiated SMCs (Owens et al., 2004Owens G.K. Kumar M.S. Wamhoff B.R. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 767-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2334) Google Scholar). Further, SMCs, unlike cardiac and skeletal myocytes, are not terminally differentiated and are capable of regaining their highly proliferative and migratory characteristics under certain conditions such as vascular injury. Expression of nearly all SMC marker genes is known to be dependent upon one or more serum response elements (SRE, CC(AT)6GG or CArG boxes) in their promoters/enhancers. Serum response factor (SRF) is known to regulate growth response genes as well as muscle-specific genes through its interaction with the muscle cell-enriched SRF cofactor myocardin (Wang et al., 2001Wang D. Chang P.S. Wang Z. Sutherland L. Richardson J.A. Small E. Krieg P.A. Olson E.N. Cell. 2001; 105: 851-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Further, it is well documented that SRF cofactors, many of which are antagonistic in action, are mechanistically involved in regulating phenotypic switching of SMCs between proliferation and differentiation, thus providing a molecular explanation of cell fate maintenance and change at the transcriptional level (Owens et al., 2004Owens G.K. Kumar M.S. Wamhoff B.R. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 767-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2334) Google Scholar, Wang et al., 2004Wang Z. Wang D.Z. Hockemeyer D. McAnally J. Nordheim A. Olson E.N. Nature. 2004; 428: 185-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). However, the functional significance of miRNAs during SMC differentiation remains uncertain. In particular, whether a specific miRNA is both necessary and sufficient to induce and direct the differentiation of quiescent SMCs in vitro and in vivo remains to be determined. The Srivastava lab previously reported that miR-143 expression is dramatically increased when ESCs were induced to differentiate into cardiomyocytes (Ivey et al., 2008Ivey K.N. Muth A. Arnold J. King F.W. Yeh R.F. Fish J.E. Hsiao E.C. Schwartz R.J. Conklin B.R. Bernstein H.S. et al.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 2: 219-229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). In their most recent report, Cordes et al., 2009Cordes K.R. Sheehy N.T. White M.P. Berry E.C. Morton S.U. Muth A.N. Lee T.H. Miano J.M. Ivey K.N. Srivastava D. Nature. 2009; (in press. Published online July 5, 2009)https://doi.org/10.1038/nature08195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar convincingly demonstrate that miR-143 and miR-145, which are clustered together and initially transcribed as a single transcript, are highly expressed in the developing heart and in vascular SMCs. The cardiac and smooth muscle expression pattern of miR-143/145 parallels that of myocardin, which (not surprisingly) was found to be SRF/myocardin dependent. After the initial analysis of miR-143 and miR-145 expression during development, Cordes et al., 2009Cordes K.R. Sheehy N.T. White M.P. Berry E.C. Morton S.U. Muth A.N. Lee T.H. Miano J.M. Ivey K.N. Srivastava D. Nature. 2009; (in press. Published online July 5, 2009)https://doi.org/10.1038/nature08195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar examined miR-143 and miR-145 expression as a function of phenotypic switching in a carotid artery ligation model. In agreement with a prior study (Cheng et al., 2009Cheng Y. Liu X. Yang J. Lin Y. Xu D.Z. Lu Q. Deitch E.A. Huo Y. Delphin E.S. Zhang C. Circ. Res. 2009; (in press. Published online June 18, 2009)https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.197517Crossref Scopus (542) Google Scholar), the authors demonstrate a reduction in miR-143/145 expression in the neointimal lesion after vascular injury. In support, Cordes et al., 2009Cordes K.R. Sheehy N.T. White M.P. Berry E.C. Morton S.U. Muth A.N. Lee T.H. Miano J.M. Ivey K.N. Srivastava D. Nature. 2009; (in press. Published online July 5, 2009)https://doi.org/10.1038/nature08195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar showed that lentiviral delivery of miR-145 in postinjured carotid arteries induced the expression of some, but not all, SMC marker genes. This observation is consistent with the view that miR-145 inhibits ESC self-renewal and proliferation while it concurrently promotes cellular differentiation (Xu et al., 2009Xu N. Papagiannakopoulos T. Pan G. Thomson J.A. Kosik K.S. Cell. 2009; 137: 647-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar), suggesting that miR-143/145 negatively regulate cell proliferation in this setting. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches were applied to fibroblasts and multipotent neural crest stem cells in vitro to demonstrate that miR-145 was both sufficient and necessary for SMC differentiation. One of the most striking observations revealed by Cordes et al., 2009Cordes K.R. Sheehy N.T. White M.P. Berry E.C. Morton S.U. Muth A.N. Lee T.H. Miano J.M. Ivey K.N. Srivastava D. Nature. 2009; (in press. Published online July 5, 2009)https://doi.org/10.1038/nature08195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar was that miR-145 actually enhanced myocardin-mediated SM gene expression and SMC conversion. This finding is in contrast to the generally accepted view that miRNAs degrade mRNA targets and/or repress protein translation. Searching for the molecular mechanism, the authors found that miR-145 increased, rather than decreased, luciferase activity in the presence of the Myocd 3′UTR. Additionally, miR-143 and miR-145 were found to inhibit luciferase activity in the presence of either the Elk1 or Klf4 3′UTR. Together, these results suggest that miR-143/145 positively induces the differentiation of quiescent SMCs by simultaneously repressing Elk-1 and Klf4 expression while inducing the expression of myocardin. Complicating these results is the observation that the Myocd 3′UTR mediated a repression in luciferase activity in Cos cells but not in 293T cells. Although the underlying mechanism remains unclear, it will be interesting to test whether a similar repression exists in 10T1/2 fibroblasts, in which miR-145 was not able to induce smooth muscle differentiation, and in neural crest stem cells, in which miR-145 potently induced smooth muscle differentiation. Whether the activation of myocardin by miR-145 is constitutively or contextually dependent upon the Myocd 3′UTR is an important question that warrants further investigation. Furthermore, elucidation of the mechanism whereby miR-145 activates myocardin may be of great clinical significance, given the ability of ectopic miR-145 to inhibit neointimal formation in balloon-injured carotid arteries (Cheng et al., 2009Cheng Y. Liu X. Yang J. Lin Y. Xu D.Z. Lu Q. Deitch E.A. Huo Y. Delphin E.S. Zhang C. Circ. Res. 2009; (in press. Published online June 18, 2009)https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.197517Crossref Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Though multiple miRNAs can target a single mRNA for translational repression and/or degradation, a single miRNA can induce translational repression and/or degradation of multiple mRNAs. Intriguingly, the data presented by Cordes et al., 2009Cordes K.R. Sheehy N.T. White M.P. Berry E.C. Morton S.U. Muth A.N. Lee T.H. Miano J.M. Ivey K.N. Srivastava D. Nature. 2009; (in press. Published online July 5, 2009)https://doi.org/10.1038/nature08195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar would suggest rather that miR-143/145 both initiates and maintains the smooth muscle differentiation program through enhancement of myocardin expression and activity. The authors suggest that miR-145 promotes SMC differentiation “in part by increasing Myocd [myocardin] protein and functioning in a feed-forward reinforcement of its own expression by the SRF-Myocd [myocardin] complex” whereas miR-143 represses Elk-1 and Klf4, SRF cofactors that inhibit smooth muscle differentiation. Interestingly, miR-145 expression is also under the control of Oct4, in that highly expressed Oct4 inhibits miR-145 transcription in pluripotent ESCs (Xu et al., 2009Xu N. Papagiannakopoulos T. Pan G. Thomson J.A. Kosik K.S. Cell. 2009; 137: 647-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). Upon ESC differentiation, Oct4 and other pluripotent transcription factors are downregulated, leading to the expression of miR-145. miR-145, in turn, suppresses pluripotency and promotes cellular differentiation, in part, by repressing the level of Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4. Thus, we have learned that miRNAs and their transcriptional regulators can modulate each other's expression and hence transcriptional activity, in a positive feedback, feed-forward, or double-negative feedback mechanism. It is therefore speculated that we will see similar miRNA-dependent mechanisms in various biological systems that maintain precise cellular homeostasis during development, cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Although the study by Cordes et al., 2009Cordes K.R. Sheehy N.T. White M.P. Berry E.C. Morton S.U. Muth A.N. Lee T.H. Miano J.M. Ivey K.N. Srivastava D. Nature. 2009; (in press. Published online July 5, 2009)https://doi.org/10.1038/nature08195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar revealed some very interesting functions of miRNAs in SMCs, with the implication of potential miRNA-based cardiovascular and cancer therapeutics, one should keep in mind that many of the conclusions were based upon in vitro experimental systems or overexpression approaches. For example, if miR-145 is required for myocardin activity during smooth muscle differentiation in vitro, one would expect that miR-145 knockout mice will phenocopy myocardin knockout mice, as predicted by the model of Cordes et al., 2009Cordes K.R. Sheehy N.T. White M.P. Berry E.C. Morton S.U. Muth A.N. Lee T.H. Miano J.M. Ivey K.N. Srivastava D. Nature. 2009; (in press. Published online July 5, 2009)https://doi.org/10.1038/nature08195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar. Similarly, one would also predict that miR-143/145 null animals would exhibit defects in ESC self-renewal, proliferation, and cell fate commitment, given the vital role of those miRNAs reported by Cordes et al., 2009Cordes K.R. Sheehy N.T. White M.P. Berry E.C. Morton S.U. Muth A.N. Lee T.H. Miano J.M. Ivey K.N. Srivastava D. Nature. 2009; (in press.

The in vivo biological role of miR-143/145, though uncertain, may prove to be a pivotal regulatory factor in ESC self renewal, cell fate commitment, and maintenance of the quiescent SMC phenotype. Determination of the upstream regulatory signals (normal or pathological) that modulate both the magnitude and temporal control of miR-143/145 expression will greatly enhance our understanding of the SMC differentiation program."

We are a field, a discipline, and an entire branch of science that brings new ideas, experiments, concepts, and approaches that impinge on every field of biomedical research and medical translation. Like anything new, we are a threat to the established order, and at every kind of educational and research institution, to thrive we must be recognized as entities, not divisions of the old entities. A stem cell is a cell that can both self-renew and differentiate to form clones of stem, progenitor, and mature cells. This is a very simple definition that may not, at first glance, appear to define a field, but its application to development, tissue homeostasis, cancer, and therapies reveals in our new discoveries a field that was absent before. Tissue and organ stem cells are in most cases the only self-renewing cells in those tissues and, as such, are ultimately responsible for the lifelong homeostatic maintenance of the tissues. They are also the only cells that are necessary and sufficient for transplantation to regenerate tissues: the operative cell for regeneration in bone marrow transplants is the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) and, in muscle, the subset of satellite cells that are the muscle stem cells. Very few tissue stem cells have been prospectively isolated, so we have far to go to in building the field of regenerative medicine. Furthermore, once isolated, it is essential to show that the putative tissue stem cells are clonogenic cells that both self-renew and differentiate to form their cognate tissue. Although there are many claims that stem cells of one tissue naturally transdifferentiate to become stem cells for any other tissue to which they migrate or are placed, it is my view that there are no credible demonstrations of tissue stem cell transdifferentiation. Pluripotent stem cells are clonogenic cells that can give rise to all tissue stem cells, and thus tissues, of the body. Their existence in the body at any stage is controversial, but cultures of pluripotent stem cells from several species allow the study of developmental cell lineages where precursor cell and progeny cell can be identified, isolated, and specified. One important aspect of pluripotent stem cell biology is the ability of these cells to pass through the various tissue stem cell stages while making the mature cells of the related tissues. These are the cells that might be used, with or without modification, to regenerate tissues in a recipient. While the study of developmental genetics reveals the role of particular genes in the development or survival of body components, stem cell biology and the study of clonal lineages remains the only way to determine precursor-progeny lineage relationships. Aging, too, can be approached anew by the study of clonal populations of tissue stem cells, all of which were derived for the last time in the fetus in vertebrates, as they compete and are selected, and perhaps matured. The clonal progressions that occur normally in aging can go awry, and premalignant clones of cells with altered proclivities of self-renewal and differentiation develop. The progression of genetic and epigenetic events in these clones can result in the emergence of cancer stem cells, or tumor-initiating cells—the self-renewing cells in a cancer that still differentiate to non-self-renewing but coexisting tumor progeny. This concept and field is changing and remains controversial. Perhaps the ultimate progression of cancer stem cells is to cells which fail differentiation and approach unity efficiency as tumor-initiating cells. The cancer stem cell hypothesis will be tested finally by methods that kill only these tumor subsets in the patient or animal of origin; if the tumor is gone and the cancer is cured, cancer stem cells were indeed the drivers of the malignancy. Translation of tissue stem cells to regenerative medicine will require either transplantation of isolated cells from a donor to a host (or in some cases, from a patient back to self) after therapies that require tissue regeneration from the isolated stem cells, or small molecules or proteins that act in vivo to expand and/or rejuvenate a nascent stem cell pool. These are not today traditional therapies carried out by the pharmaceutical or biotechnology sectors, and we will need to find ways to surmount the many barriers to bring in a new era of regenerative medicine. I believe it is a function of the ISSCR to be central to the changes that must occur to usher in this era. Stem cells are the root of regenerative medicine, and stem cells and their progenitors are the core of cell-lineage analyses. The stem cell field deserves and needs examples of PhD-granting programs in its subject matter and needs to be in independent entities, not departmental divisions. In future communications, I hope to work with ISSCR members to establish working groups to move the field forward. While transdifferentiation of one tissue stem cell type to another, and dedifferentiation of a specialized cell to a pluripotent state, have not convincingly been shown to occur in vivo in vertebrates, experimental methods to reprogram adult tissue cells to pluripotency are among the most exciting engines of discovery and translation in our field. Following the work in amphibians on reprogramming adult cells in the egg, the cloning of Dolly showed it was possible in vertebrates. The work of Jaenisch and others established without doubt that adult cells of a known type could be reprogrammed to pluripotency by somatic cell nuclear transfer (NT). If the tissue cell that donated the nucleus had an altered genome, e.g., T or B lymphocytes or a cancer cell, the pluripotent stem cell line derived by NT had those same alterations and could contribute to making all tissues of the organism, and the altered genes were faithfully used. The tissues derived from a T cell all had only one T cell antigen receptor rearrangement, and the T lymphocytes derived from them only expressed that receptor protein. The tissues derived from a melanoma cancer cell all had the inciting Ras mutation, contributed to all cell types normally, yet progressed in every animal to develop many independent clones of melanoma or rhabdomyosarcoma. The tissue cells derived by NT from a mouse lacking a gene required to make functional lymphocytes all lacked the enzyme and could not generate lymphocytes; in a demonstration of understanding disease pathogenesis caused by the mutation and the possible therapeutic correction of the disorder, replacement of the mutant gene in the NT pluripotent stem cell line led to the development of hematopoietic cells that could treat the disease. Given these scientific advances, a National Academies' panel, which I chaired, voted unanimously to encourage NT research, excluding human reproductive cloning, to move forward, overseen and approved by societal and governmental bodies. We cautioned that technical issues would be a major barrier, as the source of human oocytes would be limiting with a low-efficiency technology. Nevertheless, in order to study human disease pathogenesis (and even practice therapeutic cloning, a biotechnology hype), it would be important to create human disease-specific NT pluripotent cell lines so that scientists who study the disease would have the broadest opportunity to develop a depth of understanding that could lead to better diagnoses and therapies. Yet the political landscape remained unfriendly. In a famous speech on August 9, 2001, President Bush ruled out the use of U.S. federal funds for research using any embryonic stem cell (ESC) line produced after this date and also research using NT stem cell lines, however efficiently produced. President Bush gave his full support for bills introduced by Representative Weldon and Senator Brownback (ultimately not passed) to criminalize human NT research and the administration and use of any resultant treatments. In 2005, a nonbinding United Nations resolution was put forward, calling upon member states to ban all NT, including research. Some countries followed suit, but others, and the state of California, have approved human NT research, introducing medical, ethical, and institutional oversight, and funding the research. In 2006 and 2007, Yamanaka and colleagues reported a gene-based way to reprogram somatic cells from mice and humans to pluripotency (induced pluripotent stem cells), and it is important to see whether tissue cells from these can, like NT stem cells, recapitulate mouse and human genetic diseases and also avoid being tumorigenic. So there are two very promising scientifically validated ways to achieve reprogrammed pluripotency. We do not know yet if they are biologically equivalent to each other, to classical ESCs, or to the blastocyst inner-cell mass cells that are the in vivo source of ESCs. It would be a gamble to choose one over the other. The imposition of the funding ban for NT biology by President Bush had no scientific basis, but reflected his deep concern that this practice was beyond his moral scope. This view is held by many, and as individuals we must respect their right to such a view, as likewise, in a pluralistic democracy, we also do not have to abandon our own views unless they are illegal. Whether this represented his religious beliefs, his politics, or his own personal morality, it was a barrier to this field of research. In March of 2009, President Obama lifted the ban and promised that his administration would not place political or fixed ideological barriers in either the making of scientific policy or the appointment of federal employees or advisers in the entire scientific enterprise. He repeated these principles in a speech in front of the National Academy of Sciences in April. He called on the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to develop guidelines for funding ESC research that were in concert with his lifting of the ban and with his announced set of principles. Surprisingly, the NIH draft guidelines, released for public comment, restricted the eligibility of ESC lines for federal funding to embryos created by IVF for reproductive purposes and in excess of this need, continuing the funding ban on all NT-derived stem cell lines. (The Dickey-Wicker Amendment independently prohibits federal funding of the derivation of classical ESC lines from blastocysts, and by extension, from NT blastocysts). Because impeccable science has shown the worth of NT stem cell lines in revealing disease pathogenesis, and the application to humans is technical, it is hard to reconcile the NIH action with the Obama proclamation. The ISSCR has consistently endorsed research on all forms of stem cells, including pluripotent stem cell lines derived via IVF, NT, parthenogenesis, or gene-based reprogramming. The ISSCR supports such stem cell research globally, where performed under rigorous standards of research ethics described in the 2006 ISSCR Guidelines for the Conduct of Human Embryonic Stem Cell Research. As representatives of the ISSCR, the board of directors urged the NIH to open discussions on funding research carried out with human pluripotent stem cell lines derived from sources other than excess reproductive IVF embryos, including SCNT embryos, if they become available and are derived within legal and local ethical guidelines. In the final NIH guidelines, the bans remain on funding research using already established parthenogenic and NT pluripotent stem cell lines, however ethically obtained and however faithfully they replicate the pathogenesis of the human diseases from the patient nucleus donor. They do not cite a scientific reason for the ban. I will ask approval of the executive committee, and the society, to continue to call for a reversal of bans on funding research on established, ethically developed human NT and parthenogenic pluripotent stem cell lines. Every week, I am asked whether a family should take their loved one with an incurable disease to clinics that promise cures with supposed stem cell therapies. Usually, the costs for such therapies are in the tens of thousands of dollars. When I go to the websites of the providers, usually very slick, the therapies are often transplantation of tissue or umbilical cord stem cells for a variety of nonhematopoietic or nonmesenchymal disorders (claiming transdifferentiation), or even claim to be ESC therapies. I tell those that ask that there is no scientific basis for such transdifferentiation to date and no approved therapies using ESCs. If an enquirer is in the biomedical field, I remind him/her that there is now a pretty good operational way to determine whether a phenomenon, such as transdifferentiation, is real:(1)The scientific basis (e.g., of transdifferentiation) must be published in a peer-reviewed journal, but that is not enough.(2)Several independent laboratories should have confirmed and published in peer-reviewed journals that the findings as first published are reproducible, but that is not enough.(3)The principle that underlies the discovery (e.g., transdifferentiation) is so robust that any way you approach the issue, the discovery is validated, but that is not enough when therapeutic cell therapies are the objective.(4)The regeneration of tissues is rapid, robust, tissue-appropriate, and curative, not simply rare cells of uncertain origin. But these are not issues the lay public calling for the cures promised can judge alone. My own advice is that they should attempt to obtain the following from the stem cell companies or clinics before they agree to a therapy:(1)The provider must be able to send peer-reviewed papers from independent practitioners that establish the therapy as possible.(2)The provider must send evidence of approval from an independent committee, such as an institutional review board (a document from the clinical entity where the therapy is being practiced that shows the steps taken to protect the patient and justifying the experimental or approved therapy for their specific disease).(3)The provider must send a document from an agency equivalent to the Food and Drug Administration showing the approval of the experiment or the therapy for human subjects with their disease. I advise them that without all three, they must assume they are receiving an unproven therapy and that the patient is in danger of risking their life or health, of losing their money, of being away needlessly from home, family, and friends, and of course, of not being therapeutically improved. Over the past 2 years, the ISSCR has taken further steps to support the responsible translation of stem cell research to the clinic, releasing the Guidelines for the Clinical Translation of Stem Cells and accompanying Patient Handbook on Stem Cell Therapies (www.isscr.org/clinical_trans). As President of the ISSCR, I propose that we develop a website and occasional press alert naming as unproven stem cell therapies where providers of so-called “therapies” cannot supply to the ISSCR, within 60 days of request, evidence of rigorous and independent scientific and ethical review along the lines of what I recommend patients seek. We should be aware that the entities that cannot prove safety and efficacy are at one extreme of an unfortunate continuum that has, at the other end, proven therapies. We must all be cautious in our own enthusiasms and also how we define the minimum criteria required to achieve nonlisting on the site. We will not be a judge of approved therapies. I hope you agree with me on this subject, and I welcome your comments on this proposal either way. I ask for your understanding of this long introduction to a short presidency. I felt it was important to establish stem cell biology as an independent field, to establish our research as central to the development of regenerative medicine and new types of cancer therapies, to try to summarize the politics of stem cell policies clearly, and to find some way to keep our legitimate efforts separable and separate from the charlatans who compromise the safety of citizens in need of hope and cure and ultimately the promise of the field."
https://openalex.org/W2079934309,"The differentiation of T cells is an ideal system to study the molecular basis of lineage specification in mammalian cells. Upon stimulation with antigen during infection or inflammation, naive peripheral T cells differentiate into various types of effector T cells with specific immune functions. Naive CD4+ T cells differentiate into at least four subsets (lineages) of T helper (Th) cells: Th1, Th2, Th17, or “induced” regulatory T cells (iTregs). Each subset is distinguished by the cytokines that they produce (Ansel et al., 2006; Lee et al., 2006; Zhou et al., 2009). Naive CD8+ T cells differentiate into effector cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTLEff) that kill infected host cells using the poreforming protein perforin and serine esterases called granzymes (Cruz-Guilloty et al., 2009). Alternatively, naive CD8+ T cells can differentiate into memory CTLs (CTLMem) that survive long-term and protect the host from reinfection (Kaech and Wherry, 2007). T cell differentiation is in large part determined by signals from the environment and is shaped by numerous feedback and feed-forward loops (bold arrows) that modulate and reinforce the direction in which differentiation proceeds (Singh, 2007). Transcription factors (boxes) play a key role in this process by forming networks in which they reinforce or oppose each other’s actions. This SnapShot illustrates the differentiation pathways for several of the best characterized T cell subsets."
https://openalex.org/W1985609754,"Seizure-related gene 6 (Sez-6) is expressed in neurons of the mouse brain, retina and spinal cord. In the cortex, Sez-6 plays a role in specifying dendritic branching patterns and excitatory synapse numbers during development.The distribution pattern of Sez-6 in the retina was studied using a polyclonal antibody that detects the multiple isoforms of Sez-6. Prominent immunostaining was detected in GABAergic, but not in AII glycinergic, amacrine cell subpopulations of the rat and mouse retina. Amacrine cell somata displayed a distinct staining pattern with the Sez-6 antibody: a discrete, often roughly triangular-shaped bright spot positioned between the nucleus and the apical dendrite superimposed over weaker general cytoplasmic staining. Displaced amacrines in the ganglion cell layer were also positive for Sez-6 and weaker staining was occasionally observed in neurons with the morphology of alpha ganglion cells. Two distinct Sez-6 positive strata were present in the inner plexiform layer in addition to generalized punctate staining. Certain inner nuclear layer cells, including bipolar cells, stained more weakly and diffusely than amacrine cells, although some bipolar cells exhibited a perinuclear ""bright spot"" similar to amacrine cells. In order to assess the role of Sez-6 in the retina, we analyzed the morphology of the Sez-6 knockout mouse retina with immunohistochemical markers and compared ganglion cell dendritic arbor patterning in Sez-6 null retinae with controls. The functional importance of Sez-6 was assessed by dark-adapted paired-flash electroretinography (ERG).In summary, we have reported the detailed expression pattern of a novel retinal marker with broad cell specificity, useful for retinal characterization in rodent experimental models. Retinal morphology, ganglion cell dendritic branching and ERG waveforms appeared normal in the Sez-6 knockout mouse suggesting that, in spite of widespread expression of Sez-6, retinal function in the absence of Sez-6 is not affected."
https://openalex.org/W2071918109,"The global financial crisis has hit biotech companies hard both in the US and Europe as venture capital dries up. Finding new sources of long-term financing for translating research into new therapeutics will be essential for maintaining innovation and new drug development by biotech companies. The global financial crisis has hit biotech companies hard both in the US and Europe as venture capital dries up. Finding new sources of long-term financing for translating research into new therapeutics will be essential for maintaining innovation and new drug development by biotech companies. “In the midst of a perfect storm,” that's where biotech firms are right now, says James Greenwood, head of the US Biotechnology Industry Organization. The global financial crisis has reduced venture capital, the essential funds that fuel biotech companies, to $16 billion in 2008, a 46% decrease compared with 2007, according to Ernst & Young auditors. This means that half of the 370 publicly traded US biotech companies lack funds to weather the current financial storm over the next 6 to 12 months. And stock markets will not be able to come to the rescue. Although biotech companies raised $1.9 billion on stock exchanges worldwide in 2007, only $5.8 million was raised in a single initial public offering in 2008. Eleven American biotech companies filed for bankruptcy in 2008, and it is not clear how many others could share a similar fate. “This will impact new innovative drug therapies,” says Angus Dalgleish, an oncology researcher at St. George's Hospital Medical School in London and cofounder of the UK-based company Onyvax, which is developing cancer vaccines. “Only one good project is going to get funded for every ten that would be equally justifiable.” But the current crisis is not a complete surprise. “Whether or not we had this acute credit crisis, the biotech industry was already looking at a decline in financing,” says Richard Aldrich, a biotech investor in Boston, MA. In the US, the glory days of the biotech business started in 1982 with a very permissive financial climate “where people were willing to make crazy speculative bets,” but this came to an end around 2001, he says. And, in parallel, “the cost of getting a drug approved became so great, that we are not going to reap the benefits of all this great science that's been produced.” To transform a scientific idea into a single drug can cost up to $800 million and may take 10 to 12 years from the first lab experiments to approval by the US Food and Drug Administration or the European Medicines Agency, according to Aldrich. “And the probability is high, that it's not going to work at all. Biotech is just a bad investment proposition.” Aldrich, however, is quick to note that there are still good opportunities. For example, one of Aldrich's enterprises is Sirtris, a company in Cambridge, MA, developing small molecule drugs such as resveratrol that modulate sirtuin enzymes to treat aging-related diseases. Sirtris was bought last year by the pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline for $720 million. “Broad biological platforms based on great science will always create value,” emphasizes Mark Levin, the former CEO of the biotech company Millennium, who now heads up the technology investment group ThirdRockVentures. In the midst of the crisis, he invested $37 million to start Constellation Pharmaceuticals, which is developing drugs that target chromatin-modifying enzymes, such as histone methyltransferases or demethylases, to reverse pathogenic epigenetic modifications. But despite these examples, the biotech business is “much more narrow now and more difficult,” says Aldrich. Phillip Sharp, who studies RNA at MIT in Cambridge, MA, has witnessed all of the ups and downs of the biotech industry. Thirty years ago, the 1993 Nobel Prize winner cofounded Biogen-Idec, which makes drugs to treat multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and Crohn's disease with annual revenues of $4.1 billion in 2008. And in 2001, despite the bursting of the technology bubble, Sharp founded Alnylam, which is developing therapeutics based on RNA interference technology. Although “venture capital ran to the hills,” Sharp not only helped to raise about $17 million for initial financing for Alnylam but also took advantage of the pressure on other companies, who were letting talented personnel go. “Sometimes, it's to your advantage to be able to have a great idea in a slow economic time, because then there is real talent available for you.” This is true now, too, but the downturn is so substantial this time, that Sharp is not so sure when or whether an “up” will come. “This crisis is different from anything I've experienced in the last 30 years,” he says. Biotech companies are having to adjust. “The current situation favors low risk projects over high risk ones, and the high risk ones will be delayed and will require government or charity core support to progress,” says Dalgleish. With 44% of US biotech companies having less than a year's supply of cash according to Ernst & Young, companies are focusing on the most advanced projects and laying off staff involved with more risky or less developed programs. And that's true globally too. This year, Santhera, a Swiss company developing drugs to treat neuromuscular diseases, closed its in-house drug discovery program, letting go of 26 of the 82-person workforce. In the US alone, 2.4% of the estimated 128,200 biotech employees in 2007 lost their jobs in 2008, and according to a survey by the journal Nature Biotechnology, biotech companies reduced their workforce by about 38%. But throwing projects and employees overboard may not suffice, and the whole dependence on venture capital funding may have to change. “The venture capital system is under the most intense strain ever and has reduced investments in biotechnology,” says Sharp. Sharp's colleague at MIT, Tom Knight, who recently founded Ginkgo Bioworks, a synthetic biology company in Cambridge, MA, said he is not so keen to obtain venture capital anyway. “The venture capital community destroyed itself in the last five years,” says Knight. “They have demonstrated that they are not trustworthy partners in start-up companies and that the only thing they care about is their own return, not the return of anyone else.” Onyvax's Dalgleish agrees, “the greed of venture capital, who virtually expect 30% on returns, was extremely unrealistic.” As a result, “all of the smart people with really good ideas are avoiding venture capital like the plague,” emphasizes Knight. “The venture capital community is going to discover, when it wakes up next year, that the good deals are not available to them.” But who else can finance the early stage funding of drug development? In the current void of venture capital “other systems that allow innovation may have to be created,” says Sharp. “I'm sure we lose innovation in the current system, and I'm sure we are going to lose more innovation within the immediate future.” So, continues Sharp, “perhaps it's time to get government money to move innovation a little closer to the marketplace.” But currently this seems unlikely. Indeed, biotech companies may not be able to benefit from the $10 billion in stimulus money allocated to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) because a clause in the legislation exempts the NIH from its usual obligation to set aside 2.8% of its annual budget for small businesses. With revenues of €11.2 billion in 2008, the European biotech sector is much smaller than its US counterpart, which had revenues of close to $50 billion in 2008; and it still lacks success stories such as Amgen or Genentech. But European governments have a history of involvement in biotech start-ups and so European biotech companies are less dependent on venture capital. Although about 30% of publicly traded biotech companies in the US have less than 6 months of cash according to the biotech merchant bank Burrill & Co., only one out of five European biotechs are in danger of bankruptcy by the end of 2009 according to the trade group European Biopharmaceutical Enterprises. In Germany, for instance, the second largest biotech hub in Europe after the UK, the biotech industry reported a 6% increase in sales in 2008. With a total of 400 companies nationwide and sales of €1 billion per year, the German biotech sector cannot match the US. However, German biotech stocks performed about 5% better than the average German stocks on the DAX index. For example, the therapeutic human antibody company Morphosys, based near Munich, has just extended its collaboration with the Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis until 2017. And in the midst of the financial crisis, in March 2009, the Berlin-based company Mologen AG managed to publicly raise €2.8 million to continue the clinical development of gene therapy to treat different cancers. One reason for this resilience is that German biotech companies are used to a scarcity of venture capital funding, says Burghardt Wittig, who founded Mologen. Wittig sees a “wide and flat distribution of quality” in the US biotech industry from which “the big breakthroughs into scientifically and economically top levels emerge in a nearly stochastic but seldom rationally predictable way.” Thus, since the early days of the industry, the US has launched more biotech companies but also has lost more compared to Europe. And biotech companies that would never have been launched in Germany or the UK survived in the US due to the permissive investment culture. Another reason for the resilience of German biotech companies is “tremendous support from the government,” says Dalgleish. Germany's Bioregio program and other government programs not only provided seed money of more than €600 million between 1997 and 2005 (compared to around €500 million in the UK) but also helped with the creation of a biotech landscape, integrating economic, research, and community institutions together in centers such as Martinsried near Munich and Berlin-Brandenburg. In the UK, which has the second largest biotech industry after the US, more than 400 biotech companies generated about €2.5 billion in revenue in 2008. “The UK was fortunate in having significant capital behind several companies,” says Dalgleish. This got the UK biotech industry launched “but unfortunately due to the problems of a low hit rate, strict regulations and no government support, they are now much worse off than those in Germany and the US.” Companies that do not have an immediate desirable potential product are “likely to go to the wall and it is anticipated that up to 80% of British biotech companies needing funding this year could go under,” says Dalgleish, whose own venture Onyvax struggled to get a further round of financing to keep a clinical trial going and is now in administration. In the end, biotech companies everywhere will be impacted by the current fiscal crisis. Although R&D spending by Germany's biotech companies rose 16% in 2007, it fell 2% to €966 million in 2008, according to Ernst & Young. Even more worrying, the transfer of ideas from the academic sector to start-ups is being noticeably delayed, says Jörn Erselius, head of Max-Planck Innovation, the technology transfer company of the Max-Planck Society, Germany's biggest non-university basic research association. “Definitely, the formation of new ventures out of Max-Planck has been put on ice due to the lack of financing opportunities.” Entrepreneurs have been hesitant for the last 2 or 3 years, but now it is even more dramatic, says Erselius. To maintain maneuverability, biotech companies are increasingly dependent on being bought by big pharma. The less capital that young biotechs have to finance costly phase II and III clinical trials, the harder it will be for them to keep their independence and grow into new Amgens, Biogens, or Genentechs on their own. Big pharma also has the bargaining advantage now because they are the only ones with cash, and a recent wave of mergers has left fewer companies interested in biotech. “Pharma rules now,” says Kenneth Kaitin from the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development in Boston, MA. Big pharma companies like Pfizer, Sanofi-Aventis, Novartis, and GlaxoSmithKline seem to be the only “lifeboats” available for biotech companies. Last year, the Japanese pharma company Takeda bought Cambridge-based Millennium Pharmaceuticals, a vaccine developer, for $8.8 billion. Imclone Systems in New York, a cancer drug company, was acquired by Eli Lilly for $6.5 million, Sanofi-Aventis swallowed BiPar, Novartis bought Speedel, and GlaxoSmithKline acquired Stiefel Laboratories. With $28 billion spent by big pharma on buying biotechs, “2008 totted up the highest biotech M&A [mergers and acquisitions] ever,” according to the industry bulletin FierceBiotech. With so many biotech companies in tough circumstances, big pharma is currently in a good bargaining position, although they themselves need to buy biotech companies in order to refill their own dwindling drug pipelines with new innovative therapeutics developed by biotech. If there are fewer biotech ventures on the market, there will be fewer possibilities to find the next generation of blockbuster drugs. “The more biotech companies that fall out of their role as a transmitter between science and the big pharmaceutical companies, the more public money has to be provided to develop academic research up to the lead compound level, where they will hopefully be picked up by pharmaceutical companies,” says Erselius. Big pharma needs to engage in projects much earlier than phase I or II clinical trials, emphasizes Erselius. So, in the future, more biotech firms are likely to be bought by big pharma earlier in the drug development process. “The pipeline is the pipeline, whether internally or externally generated,” says Mark Fishman, Chief Scientific Officer of Novartis. “We have a good balance of short- and long-term projects. We stick to our strategy over the years, driven only by scientific discovery. Lurching in and out of fields, blown by short-term financial winds, is a foolish strategy.” Apparently unscathed by the current financial crisis, “Novartis continues to spend about 17% of its sales on R&D and to seek collaborations with partners in academia and biotech, who are innovative and who we believe have a technology or molecule that will either fill a gap or complement our internal R&D capabilities,” says Fishman. The next big threat likely to buffet biotechs worldwide could be triggered by healthcare reform in the US. “What happens in the US healthcare system will greatly determine the effect on biotech and pharmaceutical companies in the US as well as in Europe,” says Dalgleish, because the US is still the biggest pharmaceutical market with sales of about $315 billion in 2007. The US government's Medicare program alone, which provides health care for people 65 years and older, spent $50 billion in 2008 for prescription drugs. The Obama administration plans to expand healthcare to provide coverage for the 47 million Americans without health insurance but simultaneously has to reduce healthcare costs, which escalated in 2007 to $2.4 trillion, 17% of the US gross national product. Even if the US government does not end up regulating drug prices as Europe does, the market forces related to a Medicare-like healthcare system could beat down drug prices, thus reducing the incentive of biopharmaceutical companies to develop new drugs. “It's hard to keep the balance,” says MIT's Phillip Sharp, “to keep innovation in the system, control costs, and expand access to healthcare at the same time.” Overall, what shouldn't be lost is the public's need for new life-saving drugs. “Ideally the people in charge making these decisions understand the complexity of the whole process,” says Sharp. “What society needs to do is to say, I want a certain level of innovation, I know that there are people who are innovative by nature, and I will make an investment in these people.”"

The demands on tissue-specific stem cells undergo dramatic modifications as the functional requirements of the tissue they serve change throughout development, growth, and adult life. Skeletal muscle stem cells or satellite cells are quiescent cells located between the muscle fiber sarcolemma and the basal lamina surrounding the fiber. This population is responsible for replenishing the stem cell pool and providing a source of differentiated progeny for myofiber repair after injury (Charge and Rudnicki, 2004Charge S.B. Rudnicki M.A. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 209-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (1832) Google Scholar). The ability of these cells to provide a continual source of differentiated progeny during multiple rounds of damage and repair indicates that at least a subpopulation of satellite cells possess stem cell properties. In neonatal muscle, satellite cells are primarily proliferating and provide a critical source of differentiated nuclei for myofiber growth (Schultz, 1996Schultz E. Dev. Biol. 1996; 175: 84-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar).

The first appearance of Pax7-expressing cells that reside beneath the basal lamina, and that therefore fulfill the definition of a satellite cell, occurs at approximately E16.5 in the mouse embryo (Kassar-Duchossoy et al., 2005Kassar-Duchossoy L.

Experiments in Pax7-deficient mice have previously shown that formation of the satellite cell pool in the embryo appears to be Pax7 independent, whereas the specification of the adult satellite cell pool appears Pax7 dependent (Seale et al., 2000Seale P.

Lepper and colleagues have bypassed this previous limitation by using temporally inducible Cre/lox technology to dissect the role of Pax7 in satellite cells in postnatal and adult regenerating muscle. Their findings provide unanticipated insight into the molecular regulation of the Pax7+ satellite cell pool as it transitions from a “neonatal” into an “adult” stage. The authors demonstrate that in response to injury, the complement of Pax7-expressing satellite cells present in neonatal muscle exhibit a requirement for Pax7 that is subsequently lost in the Pax7-derived satellite cells of adult muscle. Transplantation assays have demonstrated that subpopulations of adult satellite cells have stem cell potential (Collins et al., 2005Collins C.A. Olsen I. Zammit P.S. Heslop L. Petrie A. Partridge T.A. Morgan J.E. Cell. 2005; 122: 289-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). The utilization of genetic lineage markers to trace the endogenous muscle stem cell pool (Lepper et al., 2009Lepper C. Conway S.J. Fan C.-M. Nature. 2009; (in press. Published online June 25, 2009)https://doi.org/10.1038/nature08209Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) provides an alternative method to transplantation assays whereby the full endogenous pool of stem cells can participate in the regeneration response and may reflect a more physiologically relevant stem cell capability within the native environment. Lepper and colleagues genetically label Pax7-expressing cells and can trace the Pax7 cells and their progeny over time. The authors found that adult Pax7-derived cells proliferate in response to injury and contribute to both muscle fiber repair and the renewing satellite cell pool in their endogenous environment. During a second round of injuries, a subpopulation of satellite cells with a Pax7 origin again contribute to myofiber repair, demonstrating the self-renewing capacity of this fraction under conditions of muscle damage and repair. Lepper and colleagues also disrupted Pax7 function in Pax7-derived cells in postnatal and adult mice. Analysis of subsequent injury-induced regeneration capacity demonstrated that early postnatal muscle was impaired in the absence of Pax7, confirming that Pax7 is critical for function of the postnatal Pax7-derived satellite cell pool. In contrast, when Pax7 function was disrupted in Pax7-derived adult satellite cells, bypassing the observed requirement for Pax7 in perinatal satellite cells, Lepper and colleagues found that regeneration of adult muscle and renewal of Pax7-derived adult satellite cells was normal. To exclude the possibility that Pax3 compensates for Pax7 in adult satellite cells as observed in embryonic myogenesis (Relaix et al., 2006Relaix F. Montarras D. Zaffran S. Gayraud-Morel B. Rocancourt D. Tajbakhsh S. Mansouri A. Cumano A. Buckingham M. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 91-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), compound mutants of Pax7 and Pax3 were injured and again muscle regeneration was not found to be impaired. Thus, Lepper and colleagues have convincingly demonstrated that normal adult muscle regeneration can proceed in the absence of Pax7 and Pax3. Given the essential role of Pax3 and Pax7 in embryonic myogenesis and Pax7 in perinatal myogenesis, it was entirely unexpected that adult satellite cells do not require either Pax7 or Pax3 for effective normal muscle regeneration. Whether Pax7 and Pax3 participate in aspects of adult satellite cell biology during muscle regeneration that are not borne out in the analysis or that manifest in other contexts such as cellular transplantation await further investigation. The latter may be particularly relevant when considering muscle satellite cells for therapeutic purposes. In an attempt to examine the kinetics of the switch from Pax-dependent to Pax-independent satellite cell functions, Lepper and colleagues systematically investigated the relationship between age and Pax7 requirement in Pax7-derived satellite cells. As postnatal development proceeded, the requirement for Pax7 diminished. The independence of the satellite cell from Pax7 requirement correlated with the cessation of Pax7-derived progenitors fusing into growing myofibers and formation of the adult satellite cell pool (Figure 1). The results from Lepper et al., 2009Lepper C. Conway S.J. Fan C.-M. Nature. 2009; (in press. Published online June 25, 2009)https://doi.org/10.1038/nature08209Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar imply that the adult satellite cell is somehow “reset” from its more developmental precursor. It is possible that Pax7 may be critical for establishing the phenotype of the “adult” satellite cell character, be it establishing quiescence under homeostasis, setting the size of the satellite cell pool after injury, or some other critical determinant of tissue-specific adult stem cells. Lepper et al., 2009Lepper C. Conway S.J. Fan C.-M. Nature. 2009; (in press. Published online June 25, 2009)https://doi.org/10.1038/nature08209Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar also demonstrate that neonatal satellite cells lacking Pax7 are less able to specify or maintain myogenic lineage commitment, raising the possibility that Pax7 acts to restrict satellite cells to a myogenic program. That Pax7 disruption in neonatal satellite cells resulted in a loss of myogenic lineage, a phenotype also observed during aging (Brack et al., 2007Brack A.S. Conboy M.J. Roy S. Lee M. Kuo C.J. Keller C. Rando T.A. Science. 2007; 317: 807-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar), suggests that satellite cells in normal healthy adult muscle are regulated from niche-derived and cell-intrinsic signaling that initiate and maintain the myogenic commitment of adult satellite cells. Lepper and colleagues propose many answers that help to define the complex regulation of tissue-specific stem cells within different cellular contexts. In the future, genetic disruption of niche factors in combination with cell-intrinsic regulators will be required to determine their respective contribution to stem cell function and regenerative capacity within the endogenous environment. Our knowledge in regenerative medicine is rapidly progressing; that Pax7 satellite cells are regulated differently as the organism progresses through development into adulthood emphasizes that regeneration is not a recapitulation of a developmental program. Identifying the molecular regulators, cofactors, and extrinsic signals that alter the satellite cell state and its requirement for genes such as Pax3/7 during these critical transition periods will be essential for understanding skeletal muscle repair and harnessing the potential of muscle stem cells for therapeutic purposes. In the future it will be critical to identify genes essential for regulation of adult muscle stem cells and their regenerative and self-renewal capacity. These recent findings also raise the issue that careful consideration should be given to the “age” of the stem cell and the extrinsic environment they are derived because this may dictate their utility for specialized therapeutic purposes."
