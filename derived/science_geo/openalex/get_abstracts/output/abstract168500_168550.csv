The mode of Ca2+ entry into a neuron plays a key role in determining which signaling pathways are activated and thus specifies the cellular response to Ca2+. Ca2+ influx through L-type voltage-activated channels (LTCs) is particularly effective at activating transcription factors such as CREB and MEF-2. We developed a functional knock-in technique to investigate the features of LTCs that specifically couple them to the signaling pathways that regulate gene expression. We found that an isoleucine-glutamine (""IQ"") motif in the carboxyl terminus of the LTC that binds Ca2+-calmodulin (CaM) is critical for conveying the Ca2+ signal to the nucleus. Ca2+-CaM binding to the LTC was necessary for activation of the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, which conveys local Ca2+ signals from the mouth of the LTC to the nucleus. CaM functions as a local Ca2+ sensor at the mouth of the LTC that activates the MAPK pathway and leads to the stimulation of genes that are essential for neuronal survival and plasticity."

Here, we argue that observations on the itinerant metamagnet Sr3Ru2O7 represent good evidence for a new class of quantum critical point, arising when the critical end point terminating a line of first-order transitions is depressed toward zero temperature. This is of interest both in its own right and because of the convenience of having a quantum critical point for which the tuning parameter is the magnetic field. The relationship between the resultant critical fluctuations and novel behavior very near the critical field is discussed."

All oxygen isotope compositions plot within +/-0.016 per mil (2 standard deviations) on a single mass-dependent fractionation line that is identical to the terrestrial fractionation line within uncertainties. This observation is consistent with the Giant Impact model, provided that the proto-Earth and the smaller impactor planet (named Theia) formed from an identical mix of components. The similarity between the proto-Earth and Theia is consistent with formation at about the same heliocentric distance. The three oxygen isotopes (delta17O) provide no evidence that isotopic heterogeneity on the Moon was created by lunar impacts."
https://openalex.org/W1990162272,"Ribavirin is administered in combination with interferon-α for treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Recently, we demonstrated that the antiviral activity of ribavirin can result from the ability of a viral RNA polymerase to utilize ribavirin triphosphate and to incorporate this nucleotide with reduced specificity, thereby mutagenizing the genome and decreasing the yield of infectious virus (Crotty, S., Maag, D., Arnold, J. J., Zhong, W., Lau, J. Y., Hong, Z., Andino, R., and Cameron, C. E. (2000) Nat. Med. 6, 1375–1379). In this study, we performed a quantitative analysis of a novel HCV RNA polymerase derivative that is capable of utilizing stably annealed primer-template substrates and exploited this derivative to evaluate whether lethal mutagenesis of the HCV genome is a possible mechanism for the anti-HCV activity of ribavirin. These studies demonstrate HCV RNA polymerase-catalyzed incorporation of ribavirin opposite cytidine and uridine. In addition, we demonstrate that templates containing ribavirin support CMP and UMP incorporation with equivalent efficiency. Surprisingly, templates containing ribavirin can also cause a significant block to RNA elongation. Together, these data suggest that ribavirin can exert a direct effect on HCV replication, which is mediated by the HCV RNA polymerase. We discuss the implications of this work on the development of nucleoside analogs for treatment of HCV infection.

Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 1035-1058Google Scholar). Currently, at least four million Americans are carriers of HCV. The available therapies are not very effective in clearing virus. The current therapeutic regimen includes a combination of interferon-α (IFN-α) and ribavirin (2Davis G.L. Clin. Liver Dis. 1999; 3: 811-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). IFN-α increases the nonadaptive antiviral response in cells (3Vilèek J. Sen G.C. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 375-400Google Scholar). Ribavirin is a broad-spectrum antiviral nucleoside that is converted to the mono-, di-, and triphosphorylated forms inside of cells (4Miller J.P. Kigwana L.J. Streeter D.G. Robins R.K. Simon L.N. Roboz J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1977; 4: 211-229Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Until this year, it was thought that the mechanism of action of ribavirin involved a decrease in cellular GTP pools resulting from inhibition of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase by ribavirin monophosphate (5Streeter D.G. Witkowski J.T. Khare G.P. Sidwell R.W. Bauer R.J. Robins R.K. Simon L.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 1174-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). The mechanism of action for ribavirin has been expanded to include lethal mutagenesis of the viral genome as a result of ribavirin triphosphate utilization by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and incorporation into viral RNA (6Crotty S. Maag D. Arnold J.J. Zhong W. Lau J.Y. Hong Z. Andino R. Cameron C.E. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1375-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 7Crotty S. Cameron C.E. Andino R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6895-6900Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1, the pseudo base of ribavirin can pair equivalently with both cytosine and uracil, thus providing a molecular basis for the mutagenic potential of ribavirin. Given the need for more effective strategies to control HCV infection, a precise understanding of the mechanism of action of existing antivirals should provide direction for the development of new anti-HCV therapeutics. Full-length HCV polymerase (NS5B) contains a very hydrophobic carboxyl terminus. To increase the solubility of this enzyme, the carboxyl-terminal 21 amino acids have been removed (8Ferrari E. Wright-Minogue J. Fang J.W. Baroudy B.M. Lau J.Y. Hong Z. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1649-1654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme has been referred to as NS5B-CTΔ21 (8Ferrari E. Wright-Minogue J. Fang J.W. Baroudy B.M. Lau J.Y. Hong Z. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1649-1654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The enzymatic properties of this derivative are similar to that of the full-length enzyme; therefore, for clarity we will refer to this enzyme as wild-type NS5B (8Ferrari E. Wright-Minogue J. Fang J.W. Baroudy B.M. Lau J.Y. Hong Z. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1649-1654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The structure of this enzyme is shown in Fig. 2 (9Ago H. Adachi T. Yoshida A. Yamamoto M.

Unique to this enzyme, however, is the completely encircled active site, which derives from extensive interactions between a unique amino-terminal subdomain, referred to as the fingertips, and the thumb subdomain. A second unique feature of this enzyme is the presence of a β-hairpin, referred to as the β-loop, which protrudes into the catalytic site of the enzyme (Fig. 2). This structure has some interactions with the remaining portion of the carboxyl-terminal tail, and this interaction occludes the nucleic acid-binding site (Fig. 2) (10Zhong W. Ferrari E. Lesburg C.A. Maag D. Ghosh S.K. Cameron C.E. Lau J.Y. Hong Z. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9134-9143Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Deletion of 8 amino acids from the β-loop yielded an enzyme, NS5B-BLΔ8, with increased activity, and this derivative was now capable of utilizing stably annealed primer-templates (11Hong Z. Cameron C.E. Walker M. Castro C. Yao N. Lau J.Y. Zhong W. Virology. 2001; 285: 6-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), including the symmetrical primer-template substrate (sym/sub) developed to study the poliovirus polymerase (12Arnold J.J. Cameron C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5329-5336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and used to demonstrate that ribavirin triphosphate is a substrate for this enzyme (6Crotty S. Maag D. Arnold J.J. Zhong W. Lau J.Y. Hong Z. Andino R. Cameron C.E. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1375-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). In this report, we exploit the HCV NS5B-BLΔ8 derivative to test the hypothesis that the antiviral activity of ribavirin against HCV can be mediated, in part, by the viral polymerase. Like poliovirus polymerase, HCV polymerase incorporates ribavirin opposite cytidine and uridine with equal efficiency. Once incorporated, however, ribavirin causes a much more significant impediment to RNA elongation by HCV polymerase than observed for poliovirus polymerase. Together, the data described herein provide evidence for a direct effect of ribavirin on HCV replication mediated by the viral polymerase and provide additional support for the use of lethal mutagenesis as a strategy for the development of antiviral agents. [γ-32P]ATP (>7,000 Ci/mmol) was from ICN; nucleoside 5′-triphosphates (ultrapure solutions) were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; ribavirin 5′-triphosphate was from Moravek Biochemicals, Inc. (Brea, CA); all RNA oligonucleotides were from Dharmacon Research, Inc. (Boulder, CO); T4 polynucleotide kinase was from New England Biolabs, Inc. All other reagents were of the highest grade available from Sigma or Fisher. Expression and purification of NS5B and NS5B-BLΔ8 was performed as described previously (8Ferrari E. Wright-Minogue J. Fang J.W. Baroudy B.M. Lau J.Y. Hong Z. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1649-1654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Zhong W. Ferrari E. Lesburg C.A. Maag D. Ghosh S.K. Cameron C.E. Lau J.Y. Hong Z. J.

Virology. 2001; 285: 6-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Purification, 5′-32P labeling and annealing of sym/subs were performed as described previously (12Arnold J.J. Cameron C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5329-5336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Reaction conditions were exactly as described previously for poliovirus polymerase (6Crotty S. Maag D. Arnold J.J. Zhong W. Lau J.Y. Hong Z. Andino R. Cameron C.E. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1375-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 12Arnold J.J. Cameron C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5329-5336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Details for experimental design have been presented under Results and in the appropriate figures or figure legends. Rapid mixing/quenching experiments were performed using a Model RQF-3 chemical quench-flow apparatus (KinTek Corp., Austin, TX). Product analysis (gel electrophoresis, imaging, and quantitation) was as described previously (6Crotty S. Maag D. Arnold J.J. Zhong W. Lau J.Y. Hong Z. Andino R. Cameron C.E. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1375-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 12Arnold J.J. Cameron C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5329-5336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Data were fit by nonlinear regression using the program KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). We developed a primer extension assay to study the activity of the wild-type enzyme (10Zhong W. Ferrari E. Lesburg C.A. Maag D. Ghosh S.K. Cameron C.E. Lau J.Y. Hong Z. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9134-9143Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and employed the present assay to compare the two enzymes directly. This assay employs a 10-nt RNA template and a dinucleotide primer (Fig. 3 A). NS5B (2.5 μm) was mixed with template (100 μm) and primer (10 μm) and incubated at 22 °C for 90 s in order to assemble productive complexes. The reaction was initiated by addition of ATP (500 μm), and aliquots were removed and quenched at various times. The product (pGpGpA) formed was resolved from primer by electrophoresis through a denaturing 20% polyacrylamide gel, visualized using a PhosphorImager, and quantified by using ImageQuant software. A linear accumulation of product was observed; the velocity of the reaction was 0.00095 ± 0.00019 μm/s (Fig. 3 B). A similar experiment was performed with NS5B-BLΔ8. Again, a linear accumulation of product formation was observed, and the velocity of the reaction was 0.0160 ± 0.0013 μm/s. These data support the conclusion that deletion of the β-loop does not impair the catalytic activity of this derivative relative to wild-type enzyme. Surprisingly, this deletion caused a 17-fold increase in the observed steady-state rate of product formation relative to the wild-type enzyme. Although we do not know the step(s) that limits the steady-state turnover of the enzyme, the steady-state rate measured is too slow to include phosphoryl transfer as a key contributor to the observed rate. As a result, it is unlikely that the observed 17-fold increase in the observed steady-state rate of the BLΔ8 enzyme relative to wild-type enzyme reflects a substantial difference in the chemical or kinetic mechanism of this derivative relative to wild-type NS5B. However, additional experiments will be required to test this hypothesis directly. It is plausible the BLΔ8 enzyme merely establishes more productive complexes than the wild-type enzyme. Consistent with this possibility is the finding that there was a demonstrable increase in the y-intercept for the BLΔ8 enzyme (0.27 ± 0.12 μm) relative to the wild-type enzyme (0.05 ± 0.02 μm) (Fig. 3 B). More sensitive assays will be required to scrutinize this possibility more rigorously. In the experiment shown in Fig. 4, the reaction was initiated by addition of NS5B-BLΔ8 (5 μm) to a mixture containing the symmetrical primer-template substrate, sym/sub, (0.5 μm duplex) shown in Fig. 4 A and ATP (500 μm). Product analysis was as described above. The result of this experiment is shown in Fig. 4, B andC. The kinetics of AMP incorporation into sym/sub were biphasic (Fig. 4 C), consisting of an exponential phase followed by a linear phase. The observed rate of the first phase was 0.0048 ± 0.0001 s−1, and the amplitude was 0.45 ± 0.1 μm, consistent with utilization of 90% of the input substrate. The observed rate of the second phase was 0.000071 ± 0.000005 s−1 (calculated as the slope of the line divided by the amplitude of the exponential). The observed rate of the exponential phase likely reflects assembly of NS5B-BLΔ8-sym/sub complexes rather than the rate of nucleotide incorporation (12Arnold J.J. Cameron C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5329-5336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The observed rate of the linear phase likely reflects dissociation of NS5B-BLΔ8 from sym/sub to bind to the unextended side of the substrate for a second round of incorporation (12Arnold J.J. Cameron C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5329-5336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To determine the rate constant for dissociation (Fig.5 A), NS5B-BLΔ8 (1 μm) was mixed with labeled sym/sub (0.1 μm) for 5 min followed by the addition of a 1000-fold molar excess of unlabeled sym/sub as a trap for unbound and dissociating enzyme. At various times after addition of trap, ATP was added, and incorporation was permitted for 30 s, a time sufficient for quantitative incorporation of nucleotide. Product formation was monitored as described above. The amount of product formed is a reflection of the number of intact complexes remaining. The percent of complexes remaining was plotted as a function of time after the addition of trap (Fig. 5 B). The data fit best to an equation describing the sum of two exponentials. Two complexes exist: the first represents 37% of the total and dissociates at a rate of 0.013 s−1; the second represents 63% of the total and dissociates at a rate of 0.00008 s−1 (Fig. 5 B). To measure the rate constant for nucleotide incorporation (Fig.5 C), NS5B-BLΔ8 (1 μm) was mixed with sym/sub (0.5 μm duplex) for 10 min, mixed rapidly with ATP (100 μm), and then quenched by the addition of EDTA (0.3m). Product formation was determined as described above. Product formed was plotted as a function of incubation time (Fig.5 D). The data were fit best by an equation describing the sum of two exponentials. Again, two complexes exist: the first represents 24% of the total and incorporates nucleotide at a rate of 136 s−1; the second represents 76% of the total and incorporates nucleotide at a rate of 8 s−1 (Fig.5 D). The fraction of enzyme capable of the fastest rate of incorporation was inactivated by a 1-min incubation at 22 °C in reaction buffer lacking nucleic acid and nucleotide; the slower fraction lost less than 10% of its activity after a 10-min incubation under the same conditions (data not shown). We evaluated the kinetics of NS5B-BLΔ8-catalyzed nucleotide incorporation in greater detail to determine the apparent binding constant for nucleotide (K d, app) and the maximal rate of nucleotide incorporation (k pol). The observed rate of nucleotide incorporation was determined at various nucleotide concentrations. The observed rate was plotted as a function of nucleotide concentration, and the data were fit to an equation describing an hyperbola in order to determine the values forK d, app and k pol . AMP incorporation was monitored using sym/sub-U; theK d, app value for ATP was 25 μm, and the k pol value was 12 s−1 (TableI). GMP incorporation was monitored using sym/sub-C; the K d, app value for GTP was 6 μm, and the k pol value was 10 s−1 (Table I).Table IRibavirin is a guanine and adenine mimicPrimer/templateNucleotideK d, appk polμms −1sym/sub-U 5′-GCAUGGGCCC-3′ATP25 ± 1112.3 ± 2.2CCCGGGUACG-5′RTP1-a“R” denotes ribavirin.634 ± 1090.044 ± 0.003sym/sub-C 5′-GAUCGGGCCC-3′GTP6.2 ± 1.110.4 ± 0.4CCCGGGCUAG-5′RTP1-a“R” denotes ribavirin.580 ± 1060.026 ± 0.001sym/sub-R1-a“R” denotes ribavirin. 5′-GCARCCCGGG-3′UTP313 ± 600.047 ± 0.004GGGCCCRACG-5′CTP140 ± 260.24 ± 0.01Experiments were performed as described in the text and the legend to Fig. 3 C.

Open table in a new tab Experiments were performed as described in the text and the legend to Fig. 3 C. The boldface letters in the sym/sub sequences indicate the templating residues. Ribavirin was incorporated into sym/sub with equal efficiency when either cytidine or uridine was the templating residue (Table I). The K d, app value for RTP was in the 500–700 μm range and the k pol value in the 0.03–0.04 s−1 range when either sym/sub-C or sym/sub-U was employed (Table I). The presence of ribavirin in the template supported incorporation of uridine and cytidine into RNA. The efficiency of incorporation of both nucleotides was equivalent based upon the k pol /K d, app values (Table I). Thek pol values for uridine and cytidine incorporation templated by ribavirin were en par with those measured for ribavirin incorporation templated by uridine or cytidine (Table I). This result was surprising because experiments performed previously with poliovirus polymerase showed a 500-fold increase in the k pol value measured when ribavirin was in the template relative to that measured when ribavirin was the incoming nucleotide (6Crotty S. Maag D. Arnold J.J. Zhong W. Lau J.Y. Hong Z. Andino R. Cameron C.E. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1375-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). We evaluated a substrate in which ribavirin was placed as the second templating nucleotide in the substrate (sym/sub-UR, Fig.6 A). Complexes containing NS5B-BLΔ8 and sym/sub-UR were assembled and mixed with the following for 30 s: ATP (Fig. 6 B, lane 4); ATP and UTP (Fig. 6 B, lane 5); or ATP, UTP, and GTP (Fig. 6 B, lane 6). Control experiments were performed in which sym/sub-U was employed instead of sym/sub-UR (Fig.6 B, lanes 1–3). The elongation efficiency of a significant fraction of enzyme was reduced by the presence of ribavirin in the template relative to control (compare lanes 2 and5 in Fig. 6 B). However, nucleotide incorporated opposite ribavirin was efficiently extended into full-length RNA (compare lanes 5 and 6 in Fig. 6 B). The presence of the product that is 4-nt longer than primer inlane 6 of Fig. 6 B is likely the product of misincorporation. The same analysis was performed employing poliovirus polymerase (3Dpol) instead of HCV polymerase. In this context, ribavirin in the template also caused some reduction in the elongation efficiency of 3Dpol relative to the control template lacking ribavirin (compare lane 8 with11 and lane 9 with 12 in Fig.6 B). Poliovirus and its polymerase have been employed as a model system to explore alternative hypotheses for the antiviral activity of the broad-spectrum antiviral nucleoside, ribavirin (6Crotty S. Maag D. Arnold J.J. Zhong W. Lau J.Y. Hong Z. Andino R. Cameron C.E. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1375-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). These studies have suggested that the viral polymerase mediates the antiviral activity of ribavirin by utilizing ribavirin triphosphate as a substrate and incorporating this nucleotide into RNA (6Crotty S. Maag D. Arnold J.J. Zhong W. Lau J.Y. Hong Z. Andino R. Cameron C.E. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1375-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). The ambiguous nature of the pseudo base of ribavirin (Fig. 1) forces polymerase to incorporate ribavirin with decreased specificity leading to increased mutagenesis of the viral genome and production of defective virus (6Crotty S. Maag D. Arnold J.J. Zhong W. Lau J.Y. Hong Z. Andino R. Cameron C.E. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1375-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 7Crotty S. Cameron C.E. Andino R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6895-6900Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Whether this mechanism of action of ribavirin is unique to poliovirus is important to determine. Should the next generation of antiviral nucleosides target inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase or the viral polymerase? To begin addressing this question, we developed an HCV polymerase derivative that permits direct evaluation of single nucleotide incorporation (11Hong Z. Cameron C.E. Walker M. Castro C. Yao N. Lau J.Y. Zhong W. Virology. 2001; 285: 6-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). This derivative, NS5B-BLΔ8, contains a truncated β-loop that opens the nucleic acid-binding pocket providing access to double-stranded nucleic acid (Fig. 2). The NS5B-BLΔ8 enzyme likely uses the same mechanism as wild-type NS5B (Fig. 3). It is worth noting that this derivative does support some degree of replication relative to inactive polymerase derivatives when evaluated in the context of subgenomic replicons. 2D. Maag, C. Castro, Z. Hong, and C. E. Cameron, unpublished results. The NS5B-BLΔ8 derivative utilizes the symmetrical sym/sub system developed for poliovirus polymerase (12Arnold J.J. Cameron C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5329-5336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4), establishing very stable complexes that are competent for fast rates of nucleotide incorporation (Fig. 5). The NS5B-BLΔ8-sym/sub complexes that assemble are heterogeneous, composed of at least two or three somewhat different species having different biochemical properties. When evaluating complex dissociation, nucleotide incorporation, or thermal stability, evidence for two complexes was obtained in each case (Fig. 5 and data not shown). The relationship between these complexes is not clear; however, we speculate that the observed heterogeneity is a consequence of the remaining portion of the carboxyl-terminal tail (Fig. 2) binding in various conformations in or around the nucleic acid-binding pocket. We are currently testing this hypothesis by constructing NS5B derivatives containing additional deletions in the carboxyl terminus. Nevertheless, the largest fraction of enzyme (∼76%) behaves as a single species with a half-life of ∼2.5 h, apparent binding constants for nucleotide in a physiologically relevant range (Table I), and maximal rates of nucleotide incorporation in the 10–12 s−1 range (TableI). The rates of nucleotide incorporation reported here are consistent with those measured by others when employing the full-length enzyme and homopolymeric substrates (13Lohmann V. Roos A. Korner F. Koch J.O. Bartenschlager R. Virology. 1998; 249: 108-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Together, these data suggest that HCV polymerase should be capable of replicating its genome in a single binding event requiring no longer than 15 min. Moreover, given the lowK d, app value for GTP, it is unlikely that the enzyme would be sensitive to the 2-fold reduction in intracellular GTP pools observed when cells are treated with ribavirin (14Wray, S. K., Gilbert, B. E., Noall, M. W., and Knight, V. Antiviral Res.5, 29–37Google Scholar). By using the NS5B-BLΔ8 derivative and the sym/sub system, we demonstrated that ribavirin triphosphate is a substrate for the HCV polymerase and should be mutagenic to the viral genome (Table I). However, ribavirin incorporation should occur at best only once/7000 nucleotides incorporated; that is, approximately once per genome. As a result, several cycles of replication may be necessary to cause a significant drop in production of infectious virus, consistent with the reduced efficacy of ribavirin monotherapy for treatment of HCV infection (15Zoulim F. Haem J. Ahmed S.S. Chossegros P. Habersetzer F. Chevallier M. Bailly F. Trepo C. J. Viral Hepatol. 1998; 5: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We also observed a substantial block to elongation of nascent RNA when ribavirin was present in the template (Fig. 6). In this case, a single incorporation per genome may be more than sufficient to cause a substantial antiviral effect. If this is the case, then the reduced efficacy of ribavirin monotherapy may be a reflection of the use of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction as an indicator of viral load instead of a direct analysis of virus infectivity (15Zoulim F. Haem J. Ahmed S.S. Chossegros P. Habersetzer F. Chevallier M. Bailly F. Trepo C. J. Viral Hepatol. 1998; 5: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). HCV RNA may be stable for substantial periods of time in cells and defective RNA may be packaged if the appropriate signals remain intact. Whether the effect of ribavirin is on genome fitness or integrity, the effect can be direct and mediated by the viral RNA polymerase. Moreover, in either case, IFN-α treatment should increase the efficiency of RNA clearance by activating the RNase L pathway among others (3Vilèek J. Sen G.C. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 375-400Google Scholar). Together, the data presented herein support the hypothesis that antiviral nucleosides can be developed that can be converted intracellularly to active substrates for the viral RNA polymerase, causing either lethal mutagenesis of the viral genome or premature termination of nascent viral RNA. By using a combination of the NS5B-BLΔ8 derivative, or related enzymes, and the sym/sub system, it is now possible to evaluate systematically and quantitatively the specificity and fidelity of the HCV RNA polymerase. This information should be useful in providing structure-activity relationships to assist in the rational design of antiviral nucleosides. In addition, it is now possible to interrogate diverse chemical libraries, including nucleotide libraries, for the desired effects on active elongation complexes, thus diminishing the noise associated with high-throughput screens that identify myriad compounds that bind to free enzyme or double-stranded nucleic acid that would have very weak, if any, biological activity.

Here, we derive an enzyme mechanism from true atomic-resolution x-ray structures of reaction intermediates. Two ultra–high resolution structures of wild-type and mutant d -2-deoxyribose-5-phosphate (DRP) aldolase complexes with DRP at 1.05 and 1.10 angstroms unambiguously identify the postulated covalent carbinolamine and Schiff base intermediates in the aldolase mechanism. In combination with site-directed mutagenesis and 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance, we can now propose how the heretofore elusive C-2 proton abstraction step and the overall stereochemical course are accomplished. A proton relay system appears to activate a conserved active-site water that functions as the critical mediator for proton transfer."

Here we report that hatchling loggerheads, when exposed to magnetic fields replicating those found in three widely separated oceanic regions, responded by swimming in directions that would, in each case, help keep turtles within the currents of the North Atlantic gyre and facilitate movement along the migratory pathway. These results imply that young loggerheads have a guidance system in which regional magnetic fields function as navigational markers and elicit changes in swimming direction at crucial geographic boundaries."

Specifically, histone deacetylase (HDAC) proteins repress transcription by deacetylating histones. To date, the only known regulatory mechanism of HDAC1 function is via interaction with associated proteins. Although the control of HDAC1 function by protein interaction and recruitment is well precedented, we were interested in exploring HDAC1 regulation by post-translational modification. Human HDAC1 protein was analyzed by ion trap mass spectrometry, and two phosphorylated serine residues, Ser421 and Ser423, were unambiguously identified. Loss of phosphorylation at Ser421and Ser423 due to mutation to alanine or disruption of the casein kinase 2 consensus sequence directing phosphorylation reduced the enzymatic activity and complex formation of HDAC1. Deletion of the highly charged carboxyl-terminal region of HDAC1 also decreased its deacetylase activity and protein associations, revealing its requirement in maintaining HDAC1 function. Our results reinforce the importance of protein associations in modulating HDAC1 function and provide the first step toward characterizing the role of post-translational modifications in regulating HDAC activity in vivo.

Transcription is regulated at many levels to selectively express only those proteins necessary for proper cell function. Although the role of DNA-binding transcription factors in controlling gene expression is well established, an additional level of regulation has been recently elucidated, the accessibility of genomic DNA to transcription factors (3Grunstein M. Sci. Am. 1992; 267: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The genome is tightly packed into chromosomes through nucleosomal protein-DNA complexes. Each nucleosome contains ∼200 base pairs of double-stranded DNA wrapped twice around a histone protein core (4Kornberg R.D. Klug A. Sci. Am. 1981; 244: 52-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Although the carboxyl-terminal region of the histones are involved in forming the nucleosome core, the amino-terminal, lysine-rich tails are located outside of the nucleosome core (5Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6885) Google Scholar). Various studies revealed a correlation between the acetylation of amino-terminal lysine residues on histones and transcriptional activity in chromatin (3Grunstein M. Sci. Am. 1992; 267: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 6Grunstein M. Nature. 1997; 389: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (2389) Google Scholar). Therefore, the current model of transcriptional control includes DNA accessibility due to acetylation of histones. The acetylation state of histones is dependent on the activity of two proteins, histone acetyltransferase and histone deacetylase (HDAC),1 which acetylate and deacetylate histones, respectively. Loss of HDAC activity using small molecule inhibitors correlates with the hyperacetylation of nucleosomal histones (7Van Lint C. Emiliani S. Verdin E. Gene Exp. 1996; 5: 245-253PubMed Google Scholar, 8Richon V.M. Emiliani S. Verdin E. Webb Y. Breslow R. Rifkind R.A. Marks P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3003-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar). Importantly, HDAC proteins in yeast and humans are necessary to achieve the full transcriptional repression and induction of diverse genes (9Vidal M. Gaber R.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6317-6327Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 10Bernstein B.E. Tong J.K. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Not surprisingly, HDAC proteins are critical in fundamental cellular events, including cell cycle control, differentiation, and cancer formation (11Kouzarides T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). A small molecule inhibitor of HDAC function, trichostatin, causes cell cycle arrest in mammalian cells at both G1 and G2 phases, while overexpression of HDAC1 in mouse cells results in reduced growth rate due to lengthening of G2 and M phases (12Hoshikawa Y.

Brain Res. 1998; 61: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Finally, HDAC proteins interact with cellular proteins implicated in cancer development, including the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor (Rb), metastasis-associated protein 2 (MTA2), and nuclear hormone receptors like the retinoic acid receptor (17Cress W.D. Seto E. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 184: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). As a well studied example, acute promyelocytic leukemia is associated with a fusion protein of retinoic acid receptor α and a promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger gene (promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger-retinoic acid receptor α) that recruits HDAC repression activity to block normal differentiation and lead to leukemia (18Grignani F. De Matteis S. Nervi C. Tomassoni L. Gelmetti V. Cioce M. Fanelli M. Ruthardt M. Ferrara F.F. Zamir I. Seiser C. Grignani F. Lazar M.A. Minucci S. Pelicci P.G.

Finally, the recently identified NAD-dependent sirtuin (SIRT) proteins are homologous to the yeast Sir2 protein (30Imai S. Armstrong C.M. Kaeberlein M. Guarente L.

HDAC function is regulated by two known mechanisms. In the case of class II proteins, HDAC4 and HDAC5 shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm via phosphorylation-dependent interaction with 14-3-3 protein (32Grozinger C.M. Schreiber S.L. Proc.

Three characterized protein complexes contain HDAC1 and HDAC2.

The nucleosome remodeling and deacetylating (NRD or NuRD) complex includes HDAC1, HDAC2, RbAp48, RbAp46, Mi-2 (or CHD), methyl-CpG-binding domain 3, and MTA2.

The identification of a group of repressor and corepressor proteins that bind HDAC proteins suggests a model where HDAC1 and HDAC2 are targeted to certain DNA promoters or chromosomal domains to affect transcription of cellular genes. Although the control of HDAC1 and HDAC2 function by protein interaction and recruitment is well precedented, we were interested in exploring HDAC1 regulation by post-translational modification. We began our study by analyzing the sequence of HDAC1 by mass spectrometry. Two phosphorylated serines were unambiguously identified at Ser421 and Ser423. Mutagenesis experiments revealed that phosphorylation at Ser421 and Ser423 promoted the enzymatic activity and complex formation of HDAC1. The protein kinase casein kinase 2 (CK2) was shown to phosphorylate HDAC1 in vitro. Disruption of the CK2 consensus sequence directing phosphorylation of Ser421 and Ser423 altered the enzymatic activity and complex formation of HDAC1. Glutamic acid and aspartic acid only partially substituted for the phosphoserines, indicating that the charge and size of phosphate are uniquely suited to maintaining HDAC1 function. Finally, our data support a model where the carboxyl-terminal region of HDAC1 is essential for maintaining the protein association and enzymatic activity of HDAC1. All HDAC1 mammalian expression plasmids were constructed by inserting the HDAC1-FLAG sequence into theNotI/EcoRI sites of pBJ5 (22Taunton J. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1996; 272: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1530) Google Scholar).

Simian virus 40 large T-antigen (T-Ag) Jurkat cells (40 × 106) were washed and incubated in 4 ml of phosphate-free medium containing 1.2 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 4 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.4) and lysed in 1 ml of JLB (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.5% Triton X-100) supplemented with 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin by rocking at 4 °C for 30 min. After pelleting cellular debris, the supernatant was incubated with 20 μl of α-HDAC1-conjugated agarose affinity gel in the presence and absence of HDAC1 peptide inhibitor (NH2-CGEEKPEAKGVKEEVKLA) for 1.5 h with rocking at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with 1 ml of KA/LB (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA) and resuspended in 20 μl of 2× SDS to elute bound proteins (1× SDS buffer contains 100 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 4% SDS, and bromphenol blue). The eluted proteins were separated using SDS-PAGE. K-trap affinity resin was synthesized by deprotection of Alloc-protected K-trap and immobilization onto Affi-Gel 10 as described (22Taunton J. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1996; 272: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1530) Google Scholar, 43Taunton J. Collins J.L. Schreiber S.L. J. Am. Chem.

T-Ag Jurkat cells (1.25 × 109) were lysed in JLB supplemented with 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin by rocking at 4 °C for 30 min. After cellular debris was pelleted by centrifugation, the protein concentration of the supernatant was determined by Bradford assay and diluted to 5 μg/μl with JLB. K-trap affinity resin (400 μl) was washed twice with JLB and incubated with the lysate at 4 °C for 14 h with rocking. The beads were washed with 10 ml of KA/LB twice quickly and three times more stringently by rocking for 10 min at room temperature. The washed beads were resuspended in 300 μl of 0.25× SDS buffer supplemented with freshly added 100 mm dithiothreitol and boiled for 5 min to elute bound protein. The supernatant was removed, and the elution was repeated with 100 μl of 0.25× SDS buffer. The 400 μl of eluted proteins were concentrated to 100 μl by evaporation, boiled, and separated using SDS-PAGE. After visualization with colloidal Coomassie staining (Novex), the band corresponding to HDAC1 was subjected to in gel reduction, carboxyamidomethylation, and tryptic digestion (Promega). Phosphorylated peptide sequences were determined in a two-stage microchromatographic run on a bimodal immobilized Fe3+ metal affinity/reverse phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) column. The bimodal column was packed in house with 5 cm of POROS MC support (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) followed by 5 cm of POROS R2 in a 75-μm inner diameter fused silica terminating in a 10-μm nanospray tip (New Objective). Phosphorylated peptides were retained by the immobilized Fe3+ metal affinity phase during RPLC of the nonphosphorylated peptides. Captured peptides were released by eluting with 100 mmKH2PO4, 1% acetic acid for subsequent RPLC concentration and separation. The chromatography was directly coupled to a LCQ DECA quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan) through a custom nanoelectrospray source. The flow rate was 290 nl/min. The ion trap repetitively surveyed the range m/z395–400, executing data-dependent tandem MS (MS/MS) for peptide sequence information on the four most abundant ions in each survey scan. MS/MS spectra were acquired with a relative collision energy of 30% and an isolation width of 2.5 daltons, and recurring ions were dynamically excluded.

FLAG epitope-tagged HDAC1 was transiently transfected by electroporation into T-Ag Jurkat cells. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, cells were lysed at 4 °C by rotation in JLB with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin. After cellular debris was pelleted by centrifugation, HDAC1-FLAG proteins were immunoprecipitated from the supernatant by incubation at 4 °C with α-FLAG M2 agarose affinity gel (Sigma) for 2 h with rocking. When immunoprecipitation was performed with T-Ag Jurkat lysates, 10 × 106 cells were lysed as described and incubated with the protein-specific antibody for 30 min, followed by incubation with protein G-agarose (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 1 h. For Western blot analysis, the beads were washed with JLB three times, diluted with 1× SDS buffer, and separated by SDS-PAGE. Antibodies against HDAC1 (22Taunton J. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1996; 272: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1530) Google Scholar) and MTA2 (42You A. Tong J.K. Grozinger C.M. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Antibodies against FLAG (Sigma), RbAp48 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), mSin3A (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), IκBα (Upstate Biotechnology), and CK2 (Upstate Biotechnology) were purchased. [3H]Acetate-incorporated histones were isolated from butyrate-treated HeLa cells by acid extraction as described (47Carmen A.A. Rundlett S.E. Grunstein M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15837-15844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were incubated with ∼0.4 μg (1,000 dpm) of histones for 2 h at 37 °C in 50 μl of HD buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol). The reaction was terminated by the addition of an equal volume of stop solution (0.5 m HCl and 0.2 macetic acid), and deacetylase activity was determined by scintillation counting of the ethyl acetate-soluble [3H]acetic acid (22Taunton J. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1996; 272: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1530) Google Scholar). Inhibition of enzymatic activity by trichostatin A was determined by incubating the immunoprecipitates with 500 nmtrichostatin A (Sigma) for 30 min prior to the addition of histones. For each assay, 107 T-Ag Jurkat cells were transfected by electroporation with 50 ng of luciferase reporter, 50 ng of cytomegalovirus-β-galactosidase reporter, and 50 ng of protein expression construct (36Hassig C.A. Fleischer T.C. Billin A.N. Schreiber S.L. Ayer D.E. Cell. 1997; 89: 341-347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours post-transfection, luciferase assays were performed (Promega). Normalized luciferase values were calculated by dividing the luciferase activity by the β-galactosidase activity. T-Ag Jurkat cell lysates (50 μl) were incubated with 20 units of calf intestinal phosphatase for 1 h at 30 °C. The calf intestinal phosphatase was denatured for 5 min at 65 °C, and lysates were incubated with 500 units of casein kinase 2 or 1000 units of casein kinase 1 at 30 °C for 1 h. When treated with 10 μm5,6-dichloro-1-β-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) or 200 nm KT5720, T-Ag Jurkat cells were harvested after a 45-min incubation. DRB, KT5720, recombinant CK1, and recombinant CK2 were purchased from Calbiochem. To determine whether HDAC1 is a phosphoprotein, simian virus 40 large T-Ag Jurkat cell lysates were treated with alkaline phosphatase, and HDAC1 was visualized using an HDAC1-specific antibody (Fig. 1 A). In the presence of phosphatase, HDAC1 migrated more quickly in a polyacrylamide gel than untreated HDAC1, consistent with the possibility that HDAC1 is phosphorylated. To verify that HDAC1 is phosphorylated, T-Ag Jurkat cells were labeledin vivo with [32P]orthophosphate, and HDAC1 was immunoprecipitated with an HDAC1-specific antibody. Immunoprecipitated HDAC1, which migrated by SDS-PAGE identically to HDAC1 from lysates (data not shown), was labeled with 32P, indicating that the protein is phosphorylated in vivo (Fig. 1 B). These results are consistent with previous experiments indicating that HDAC1 is post-translationally modified by phosphorylation (48Cai R. Kwon P. Yan-Neale Y. Sambuccetti L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To identify residues on HDAC1 that are phosphorylated, HDAC1 was purified from T-Ag Jurkat cells using K-trap, an affinity resin comprising modified trapoxin, an irreversible inhibitor of HDAC, attached to Affi-Gel 10 (Fig. 2 A; Ref. 22Taunton J. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1996; 272: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1530) Google Scholar). After separation by SDS-PAGE, the purified HDAC1 was excised from the gel (Fig. 2 B) and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Two phosphorylated serine residues were unambiguously identified, Ser421 and Ser423 (Fig. 2 C). Interestingly, every phosphorylated peptide observed was doubly phosphorylated at Ser421 and Ser423; no peptide detected contained only one of the two identified phosphorylated serines. The phosphorylated serines are located in the highly charged, carboxyl-terminal tail of HDAC1, removed from the catalytic site (Fig. 2 C). A sequence comparison of the class I HDAC proteins, HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, and HDAC8, indicates that only HDAC1 and HDAC2 contain serines in equivalent sequence positions. HDAC3 contains two potential CK2 consensus sites; however, a lack of sequence conservation in the C-terminal region of HDAC3 makes comparison with HDAC1 and HDAC2 difficult. HDAC8 does not contain the carboxyl-terminal charged tail, where the serine residues are located. For comparison, the yeast RPD3 protein contains a truncated carboxyl-terminal tail; however, no homologous serines exist in the equivalent HDAC1 Ser421 and Ser423 positions (not shown). The fact that the phosphorylated serines identified are located in the carboxyl-terminal charge tail of HDAC1 is consistent with previous results indicating that HDAC1 is phosphorylated between residues 387 and 482 (48Cai R. Kwon P. Yan-Neale Y. Sambuccetti L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To determine whether phosphorylation influences enzymatic activity, Ser421 and Ser423 were independently and simultaneously mutated to alanine. Mutant HDAC1 proteins fused to a FLAG epitope tag were expressed in T-Ag Jurkat cells, which contain only small amounts of endogenous HDAC2 (49Hassig C.A. Tong J.K. Fleischer T.C. Owa T. Grable P.G. Ayer D.E. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3519-3524Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The HDAC1 fusion protein was immunoprecipitated with α-FLAG affinity resin, and enzymatic activity was determined in vitro. Western blot experiments confirmed that only the FLAG-tagged HDAC1 protein bound to the α-FLAG affinity resin, and not detectable quantities of endogenous HDAC1 protein (data not shown). Under conditions where equal amounts of HDAC1 or mutant proteins were immunoprecipitated, mutant proteins displayed significantly diminished deacetylase activity compared with the wild-type protein (Fig. 3 A). HDAC1 S421A, S423A, and S421A/S423A mutants demonstrated 33.0 ± 4.2, 25.3 ± 2.9, and 22.9 ± 3.1% activity compared with wild-type, respectively. The minimal activity displayed by the mutants was lost upon treatment with trichostatin A, an inhibitor of HDAC activity, indicating that the residual activity may be the result of partially active enzyme or a small amount of co-immunoprecipitated, endogenous HDAC activity (data not shown; Ref. 50Taplick J. Kurtev V. Kroboth K. Posch M. Lechner T. Seiser C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To confirm that phosphorylation of HDAC1 promotes enzymatic activityin vivo, luciferase assays were performed. HDAC1 and mutants were expressed in T-Ag Jurkat cells as fusion proteins to Gal4 and VP16, which activate transcription of the luciferase gene under the control of four tandem Gal4 DNA binding sites. Where Gal4-VP16 activat"
https://openalex.org/W1975678399,"The PKB (protein kinase B, also called Akt) family of protein kinases plays a key role in insulin signaling, cellular survival, and transformation. PKB is activated by phosphorylation on residues threonine 308, by the protein kinase PDK1, and Serine 473, by a putative serine 473 kinase. Several protein binding partners for PKB have been identified. Here, we describe a protein partner for PKBalpha termed CTMP, or carboxyl-terminal modulator protein, that binds specifically to the carboxyl-terminal regulatory domain of PKBalpha at the plasma membrane. Binding of CTMP reduces the activity of PKBalpha by inhibiting phosphorylation on serine 473 and threonine 308. Moreover, CTMP expression reverts the phenotype of v-Akt-transformed cells examined under a number of criteria including cell morphology, growth rate, and in vivo tumorigenesis. These findings identify CTMP as a negative regulatory component of the pathway controlling PKB activity."

To overcome these barriers, we have covalently attached the cationic peptide melittin to poly(ethylenimine) (PEI). This conjugate condensed DNA into small, discrete particles (<100 nm in diameter), and the membrane lytic activity of melittin enabled efficient release of the DNA into the cytoplasm, as monitored by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Compared with PEI, the transfection activity was strongly increased within a broad range of cell lines and types tested, including different tumor cell lines but also primary hepatocytes and human umbilical vein endothelial cells. The early onset of gene expression (within 4 h, reaching maximal values after 12 h) and the high reporter gene expression achieved in slowly dividing or confluent cells suggested a further role of melittin after releasing the DNA into the cytoplasm. Intracytoplasmic microinjection of melittin-containing PEI·DNA complexes into fibroblasts produced 40% cellular frequency of reporter gene expression that was inhibitable by co-injection of wheat germ agglutinin, whereas simple PEI·DNA complexes showed only 10%. These data suggest that melittin enables release of nonviral gene transfer particles into the cytoplasm and also enhances their transport into the nucleus, possibly via the cationic cluster KRKR near the C terminus of the peptide.

Poor release of the vectors from the endosome into the cytoplasm (1Zabner J. Fasbender A.J. Moninger T. Poellinger K.A. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18997-19007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar) and, subsequently, inefficient transfer into the nucleus (2Tseng W.C. Haselton F.R. Giorgio T.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1445: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) are both thought to contribute to their low transgene expression efficiency. The importance of endosomal escape can be shown using lysosomotropic drugs, such as chloroquine (3Erbacher P. Roche A.C. Monsigny M. Midoux P. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 225: 186-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), or by incorporating membrane active peptides into the gene transfer complexes (4Plank C. Oberhauser B. Mechtler K. Koch C. Wagner E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12918-12924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which can lead to increases of >1000-fold in transfection. Similarly, inefficient nuclear transport was demonstrated when Pollardet al. (5Pollard H. Remy J.S. Loussouarn G. Demolombe S. Behr J.P. Escande D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7507-7511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar) showed by microinjection that only 0.1–1% of free plasmids microinjected into the cytoplasm were transferred into the nucleus. The effects of the cell cycle on the efficiency of transfection using polyelectrolyte complexes was shown by Brunneret al. (6Brunner S. Sauer T. Carotta S. Cotten M. Saltik M. Wagner E. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), compatible with the intact nuclear membrane restricting entry of DNA into the nucleus. Inefficient endosomal escape and poor nuclear transfer can both be addressed by incorporation of bioactive peptides into polyelectrolyte vectors. Nuclear localization sequences (NLS)1 have been coupled either directly to the DNA (7Sebestyen M.G. Ludtke J.J. Bassik M.C. Zhang G. Budker V. Lukhtanov E.A. Hagstrom J.E. Wolff J.A. Nat.

Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 873-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). NLS peptides are mainly cationic, and they are easily incorporated into discrete polycation-DNA complexes. In contrast, amphipathic peptides described for pH-triggered lysis of the endosome membrane are negatively charged at neutral pH and can interact electrostatically with the positively charged complex surface (4Plank C. Oberhauser B. Mechtler K. Koch C. Wagner E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12918-12924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), promoting formation of large aggregates (11Ogris M. Steinlein P. Kursa M. Mechtler K. Kircheis R. Wagner E. Gene Ther. 1998; 5: 1425-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Such aggregates have a poorly defined interaction with cells in vitro and are unlikely to find useful applications in vivo (12Ogris M. Brunner S. Schuller S. Kircheis R. Wagner E. Gene Ther. 1999; 6: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar). A major objective of the present study was to use a cationic membrane-active peptide to enhance transfection activity of poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI)·DNA complexes, while avoiding electrostatic aggregation. Melittin, a cationic membrane lytic component of bee sting venom (13Dempsey C.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1031: 143-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar), was linked covalently to the cationic polymer PEI. Complexes formed by the conjugate with plasmid DNA are small and discrete, and mediate very high levels of transgene expression in vitro against a broad range of target cells. This activity is partially dependent on enhanced membrane lytic activity; however, melittin also enhances the post-endosomal activity of the complexes, increasing their nuclear accumulation. This nuclear targeting function may be mediated through the NLS-like sequence KRKR, contained within the melittin primary structure; hence, this simple oligopeptide appears to mediate two complementary functions during transfection. The plasmids pGL3 (Promega, Southampton, United Kingdom (UK)) and pEGFP (CLONTECH, Basingstoke, UK) were purified with the Qiagen endo-free plasmid purification kit (Qiagen, Crawley, UK) and stored in water. Melittin (mel; GIGA VLKV LTTG LPAL ISWI KRKR QQ) and melittin-SH (mel-SH; CIGA VLKV LTTG LPAL ISWI KRKR QQ) were synthesized by Alta Biosciences (Birmingham, UK) to a purity >95%. Branched 25-kDa PEI (Aldrich, Poole, UK) was used as a 1 mg/ml working solution in water. Texas Red-X succinimidyl ester and YOYO-1 were from Molecular Probes (Leiden, The Netherlands). Cell culture reagents were from Life Technologies, Inc. (Paisley, UK). All other reagents were from Sigma (Poole, UK). PEI (25 kDa, 600 nmol) were modified (1 h, room temperature) with 3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionic acid N-hydroxy-succinimide ester (9 μmol) in 200 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, purified by chromatography (Sephadex G-25 superfine HR 10/30 column; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) in 250 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. The PEI content was measured by TNBS assay (14Snyder S.L. Sobocinski P.Z. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 64: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar), and the degree of modification with PDP determined by absorption at 343 nm after adding dithiothreitol to release the thiopyridone group (ε = 8080/mcm). Melittin-SH (1240 nmol, in 300 μl of water) was conjugated with PEI-PDP (89 nmol, PEI/PDP 1/11 m/M) in 500 mmNaCl, 130 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 (2 h, room temperature under nitrogen), purified on a HR 5/5 MONO-S cation exchange column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; gradient elution 10–60% buffer A (buffer A, 5m NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4; buffer B, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4)) and eluted at 2–2.5 m NaCl as monitored at 240 and 280 nm. The main fractions were pooled and concentrated/desalted on Centricon Plus-20 ultraconcentrators (Millipore, Bedford, MA; 8-kDa cut-off). A molar composition of PEI/melittin (1/10) was deduced from the change in the PEI/PDP molar ratio during the reaction, assuming that PDP can only react with the terminal cysteine of melittin. TNBS reactivity with melittin had no significant effect in this determination. Different batches of mel-PEI were prepared, resulting in molar ratios of PEI/melittin between 1/10 and 1/13. Conjugation of PEI 25 kDa with human transferrin was carried out using 3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionic acid N-hydroxy-succinimide ester chemistry (15Wagner E. Cotten M. Mechtler K. Kirlappos H. Birnstiel M.L. Bioconjug. Chem. 1991; 2: 226-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and purified as described above (transferrin/PEI 0.6 m/1 m). Conjugation of PEI with Texas Red-X succinimidyl ester was carried out in 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.6, for 2 h at room temperature. The resulting conjugate was purified by Sephadex G-25 chromatography in HBS. Texas Red content was measured by absorption at 596 nm. Human erythrocytes were isolated from citrate-treated blood, washed in 150 mm NaCl, and resuspended at 107cells/ml. Test materials were serially diluted 1:2 in 90 μl of buffer (140 mm NaCl, 20 mm phosphate, pH 7.4 or 5.5) using a V-bottom 96-well plate. 10 μl of erythrocyte suspension was added to each well, and the plate was incubated with constant shaking for 30 min at 37 °C. 100% lysis was achieved by adding 90 μl of water. After centrifugation at 300 × g for 10 min, released hemoglobin was determined at 490 nm (Microplate Autoreader, Bio-Tek Instruments, Montigny-le-Bretonneux, France). B16F10 cells (mouse melanoma), IGROV1 cells (human ovarian carcinoma), Rat-1 cells (rat fibroblast, ATCC CRL 2210), and HeLa cells (human cervical carcinoma, ATCC CCL-2) were grown in DMEM with Glutamax® and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS). Primary human and rat hepatocytes were grown in the same medium in collagen-coated 48-well plates. Freshly isolated hepatocytes were allowed to attach for 4 h, washed with PBS, and used immediately. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were grown in M199 medium, 10% FCS, 2 mm glutamine/antibiotics with basic fibroblast growth factor (20 ng/ml; kindly provided by Selective Genetics, San Diego, CA). K562 cells (human chronic myelogenous leukemia; ATCC CCL-243 K-562) were cultured in Iscove's modified DMEM, 10% FCS, 2 mm glutamine. DNA was condensed with polycation in either HEPES (10 mm, pH 7.4) or HBS (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) with a final DNA concentration of 20 or 40 μg/ml (11Ogris M. Steinlein P. Kursa M. Mechtler K. Kircheis R. Wagner E. Gene Ther. 1998; 5: 1425-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). The N/P ratio represents the molar ratio of nitrogen in PEI to phosphate in DNA. (mel)-PEI·DNA complexes (N/P 5, mixed in 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.4) were applied onto mica, air-dried, and stained with uranyl-acetate. Dried samples were then rotary-shadowed with platinum and viewed on a model 1200 EX electron microscope (Jeol, Tokyo, Japan). A Zetasizer 1000 (Malvern, UK) was used for size determination of complexes with 10 subruns conducted for each measurement. Results were analyzed using Contin software. Cells were analyzed on a Coulter Epics XL flow cytometer equipped with a 488 nm argon laser. Fluorescence was detected using 520 nm (FL1) and 575 nm (FL2) bandpass filters for EGFP. Background fluorescence and autofluorescence were determined using mock-treated cells. Cellular debris showing reduced side and forward scatter was excluded from further analysis. Approximately 10,000 events were acquired per sample. Data analysis was carried out using the program WinMDI (by Joseph Trotter; available at facs.scripps.edu). DNA was incubated with YOYO-1 (1 dye molecule/300 bp) (16Ogris M. Steinlein P. Carotta S. Brunner S. Wagner E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1474: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and then condensed with polycation (PEI or mel-PEI) containing 10% Texas Red-PEI. Cells were incubated with complexes in DMEM/FCS for 4 h at 37 °C and washed with PBS, and medium was replaced with phenol red-free DMEM/FCS. Cells were viewed on a Zeiss Axiovert-100 inverted microscope with heated stage. Fluorescence was viewed with filter sets appropriate for fluorescein or Texas Red; pictures were taken with a CCD camera (Princeton Instruments, Marlow, UK). Cells were incubated with 1 mg/ml FITC-dextran (38 kDa) and complexes (N/P 5) in DMEM/FCS for 2 h at 37 °C, washed with PBS, and incubated for another 2 h without FITC-dextran. Cells were then washed with PBS, trypsinized, distributed into two cytometer tubes, and stored on ice. Monensin was added to one tube (1 μg/ml) and incubated on ice for 10 min. Flow cytometry data were acquired in logarithmic mode and analyzed in linear mode. Complexes were added to adherent cells in 75 μl (48-well plates) or 300 μl (24- and 12-well plates) of FCS-containing medium, or to K562 cells (96-well plates, 50,000 cells/well) in 50 μl of medium. After 4 h complexes were removed and replaced by fresh medium. Gene expression was measured after 24 h. For luciferase detection, cells were washed once with PBS, lysed in Promega cell lysis solution, and assayed as described recently (17Carlisle, R. C., Bettinger, T., Ogris, M., Smart, S., Mautner, V., Seymour, L. W. (2001) Mol. Ther., in pressGoogle Scholar). 2 ng of recombinant luciferase (Promega) corresponded to 107 light units. Protein content was measured using the Bio-Rad assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hemel Hempstead, UK). EGFP expression was analyzed by diagonal gating (11Ogris M. Steinlein P. Kursa M. Mechtler K. Kircheis R. Wagner E. Gene Ther. 1998; 5: 1425-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). For radiolabeling experiments, DNA was spiked with32P-labeled DNA (18Dash P.R. Read M.L. Barrett L.B. Wolfert M.A. Seymour L.W. Gene Ther. 1999; 6: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). B16F10 cells (80,000 cells/well in 48-well plates) in 75 μl of DMEM/FCS were incubated with 12.5 μl of complex solution containing 250 ng of DNA (N/P 5, HEPES). After 4 h cells were washed with PBS and lysed in Promega cell lysis solution, and geometry-corrected analysis for the contained radioactivity was conducted in a Packard scintillation counter. Transfections have been carried out in several independent experiments, and representative data are shown. Cells were incubated in 10 μm bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd; Roche Diagnostics, Lewes, UK) for 6 h, harvested after 24 h, fixed in ethanol, and treated according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Staining with antibodies was carried out in 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.005% Triton X-100, PBS at room temperature (monoclonal mouse anti-BrdUrd (1:100, Roche); goat anti-mouse Alexa-488 (1:500, Molecular Probes)). Microinjection was performed using an Eppendorf microinjection system (17Carlisle, R. C., Bettinger, T., Ogris, M., Smart, S., Mautner, V., Seymour, L. W. (2001) Mol. Ther., in pressGoogle Scholar). Tetramethylrhodamine-dextran (150 kDa) was added to the complexes (N/P 5, 20 μg/ml DNA) at a final concentration of 2 mg/ml. In some studies tetramethylrhodamine-labeled wheat germ agglutinin (WGA, Sigma) was added. To prevent aggregation of the complexes by the lectin, bovine serum albumin (final concentration 5 mg/ml) was added prior to the addition of WGA. The membrane lytic activity of melittin was checked following its conjugation to PEI using a erythrocyte lysis assay. mel-SH and mel-PEI conjugate both showed erythrolysis at pH 7.4 (50% lysis occurred at 2–4 μm melittin content in each case) and at pH 5.5 (50% lysis at 4–8 μm melittin content for mel-SH, 2–4 μm for mel-PEI). PEI alone did not lyse erythrocytes. Electron microscopy showed that mel-PEI condensed DNA into spherical polyplexes with diameter 33 ± 8 nm, similar to DNA·PEI complexes. Laser light scattering showed that mel-PEI·DNA complexes had diameter of 73 ± 1 nm (polydispersity 0.125), compared with 67 ± 1 nm (polydispersity 0.119) for PEI·DNA. Cell association of PEI·DNA and mel-PEI·DNA complexes was measured using both YOYO-1-labeled DNA with analysis by flow cytometry and 32P-labeled DNA, analyzed by scintillation counting. In both cases the uptake of complexes was unaffected by the presence of melittin in the complex (data not shown). To examine the intracellular distribution, B16F10 cells were incubated with fluorescently labeled PEI·DNA or mel-PEI·DNA complexes, washed, and viewed live to rule out fixation artifacts. After 4 h of incubation, PEI·DNA complexes (N/P 5) appeared in a punctate intracellular pattern, suggesting entrapment within vesicles (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, mel-PEI·DNA complexes (N/P 5) showed fluorescence dispersed throughout the cytoplasm and also the nucleus (Fig. 1, B and magnified image in C). YOYO-1-labeled DNA and Texas Red-PEI showed co-incident distributions in both cases, suggesting the complexes remained intact. The cytoplasmic fluorescence of the melittin-containing complexes suggests that melittin may facilitate release of polyplexes into the cytoplasm, probably by lysis of intracellular vesicles. To check whether the effect could be caused by the influence of melittin on charge properties, PEI·DNA complexes were evaluated across a range of N:P ratios (up to 9; data not shown); however, none produced a fluorescence distribution similar to mel-PEI·DNA. We attempted to quantify the supposed endosomolytic action of melittin by incubating cells with complexes in the presence of FITC-labeled dextran, a fluid phase marker that co-internalizes into endocytic vesicles (Fig. 2). Acidification of endosomes by the ATP-dependent proton pump leads to partial quenching of FITC-dextran fluorescence, whereas the fluorescence of any FITC-dextran that enters into neutral compartments (e.g. the cytoplasm) should be unquenched (19Geisow M.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1984; 150: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested and analyzed by flow cytometry either in the presence or absence of monensin, a drug known to discharge intracellular pH gradients and restore quenched FITC fluorescence (20Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 676-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Cells incubated with FITC-dextran alone exhibited much greater fluorescence when analyzed in the presence of monensin (Fig. 2 A), suggesting the presence of FITC-dextran within acidified endosomes or lysosomes. The presence of chloroquine in the incubation medium effectively removed this ability of monensin to enhance fluorescence (Fig. 2 B), compatible with the lysosomotropic action of chloroquine leading to buffering of pH in the FITC-dextran-containing vesicles (3Erbacher P. Roche A.C. Monsigny M. Midoux P. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 225: 186-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). When cells were incubated with PEI·DNA complexes in the presence of FITC-dextran, monensin again showed significant ability to enhance FITC fluorescence (Fig. 2 C); this suggests the FITC-dextran is entering acidified vesicles, and therefore the buffering effect of PEI is not adequate to halt endosomal acidification completely. In contrast, when cells were incubated with mel-PEI·DNA in the presence of FITC-dextran, monensin exerted only a slight enhancement of FITC fluorescence (Fig. 2 D), compatible with the FITC-dextran being largely present in a nonacidified compartment, such as the cytoplasm. To normalize these data, the mean fractional increase in fluorescence mediated by monensin was calculated for each treatment (21Murphy R.F. Powers S. Verderame M. Cantor C.R. Pollack R. Cytometry. 1982; 2: 402-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 E). Compared with the untreated FITC-dextran control (sample 1), co-incubation with mel-PEI·DNA complexes significantly decreased the ability of monensin to enhance FITC fluorescence (sample 3), whereas the corresponding PEI·DNA complexes showed substantially less activity (sample 2). Co-incubation with chloroquine resulted in a ratio of close to 1 (sample 4), as the lysosomotropic drug efficiently buffers endosomal/lysosomal vesicles (see above). The effect of melittin is thought unlikely to reflect pH buffering, because melittin contained in the complexes does not exhibit significant buffering capacity. The possibility that melittin acts to transfer FITC-dextran into the cytoplasm is therefore more plausible and fits well with the fluorescent images described earlier (Fig. 1). The transfection activity of mel-PEI was assessed using several different cell types, with both luciferase and EGFP reporter genes (Table I). Activity was compared with that of DNA complexed with unmodified PEI or with the cationic lipid (DOTAP), with serum present throughout. The mel-PEI·DNA complexes invariably showed much greater activity than PEI·DNA (up to 700-fold for luciferase, over 20-fold for EGFP). Simple mixture of PEI and mel-SH prior to complexation with DNA did not increase transgene expression (data not shown). When applied to the human ovarian carcinoma cell line IGROV1, PEI·DNA complexes showed less than 2% transfection. This low level of activity is in accord with observations by Poulain and colleagues (22Poulain L. Ziller C. Muller C.D. Erbacher P. Bettinger T. Rodier J.F. Behr J.P. Cancer Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 644-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), who found very low transfection efficiency of IGROV1 cells with branched 25-kDa PEI. We verified their results (data not shown) and found that melittin also shows promising activity on even this cell line, with mel-PEI·DNA achieving over 20% EGFP positivity. Similar effects were also found using HeLa cells and early passage HUVEC; whereas PEI·DNA transfection achieves only about 1% transfected cells, mel-PEI·DNA complexes reproducibly achieved transfection rates of up to 30%. When transfecting nondividing primary rat hepatocytes or early passages of HUVEC cultured under minimal conditions (very slowly dividing), again melittin showed significant enhancement of transfection against a very low background achieved by PEI·DNA. The possibility of combining the activity of melittin with active targeting was demonstrated in K562 cells. Both mel-PEI·DNA and transferrin-targeted mel-PEI·DNA complexes were approximately 4-fold more efficient compared with their melittin-free counterparts, suggesting that melittin enhancement of transfection can be combined with active targeting.Table ICell transfectionsCell lineLuciferaseEGFP-positive cellsPEI·DNAmel-PEI·DNADOTAP·DNAPEI·DNAmel-PEI·DNADOTAP·DNARLU × 10 5 /mg protein%B16F101432 ± 18598,060 ± 13,98813.0 ± 4.077.4 ± 2.2B16F10*77,800 ± 16,58773,479 ± 811415,469 ± 162621.6 ± 4.660.2 ± 1IGROV134 ± 22290 ± 1191.6 ± 0.2421.8 ± 0.25IGROV1*29 ± 138590 ± 20810.14 ± 0.0155.8 ± 10.9 ± 0.2HeLa74 ± 8.7931 ± 2630.91 ± 0.0724.6 ± 1.3HeLa*1797 ± 343522 ± 1000.59 ± 0.1751.8 ± 1.16.6 ± 0.5K562**87 ± 21344 ± 44K56220 ± 1080 ± 6.6Rat-1*21 ± 8181 ± 53157 ± 5HUVEC p4 + FGF0.6 ± 0.3730.9 ± 11.716.6 ± 428.0 ± 0.671.6 ± 0.27HUVEC p5 + FGF36.2 ± 2.90.04 ± 0.018.19 ± 1.70.34 ± 0.03HUVEC p2 − FGF*01.2 ± 0.3Primary rat hepatocytes1.2 ± 1.543 ± 25Primary human hepatocytes*03.06 ± 0.450.94 ± 1.09For luciferase gene expression, B16F10, IGROV1, HeLa, Rat-1, HUVEC p2−FGF, rat and human hepatocytes (8000, 10,000, 25,000, 25,000, 50,000, and 15,000/well, respectively) were transfected with 250 ng (all N/P 5 except rat hepatocytes N/P 3.5).

The effect of melittin was also evaluated using complexes that were caused to aggregate by producing them in HBS. Such PEI·DNA aggregates usually show a 10–1000-fold higher gene expression level in vitro compared with their nonaggregated PEI·DNA counterparts, generated under low ionic conditions (6Brunner S. Sauer T. Carotta S. Cotten M. Saltik M. Wagner E. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 11Ogris M. Steinlein P. Kursa M. Mechtler K. Kircheis R. Wagner E.

Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1183-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), thought to reflect increased levels of cellular association and improved endosomal escape because of their greater ”proton sponge“ properties (24Kichler A. Behr J.P. Erbacher P. Huang L. Hung M.-C. Wagner E. Nonviral Vectors for Gene Delivery. Academic Press, San Diego1999: 191-206Google Scholar). Whereas there was a clear increase in gene expression on B16F10 cells using aggregated PEI·DNA complexes, this effect could not be found on IGROV1 or HeLa cells. In contrast, with aggregated mel-PEI·DNA complexes, gene expression was further increased in the latter cases. The time course of transgene expression using mel-PEI·DNA was compared with PEI·DNA, with both small and HBS-aggregated formulations of each. With PEI·DNA complexes, initial transgene expression could be detected after 8 h (large aggregates) or 12 h (small complexes) and expression reached its peak 24 h following transfection. In contrast, both formulations of mel-PEI·DNA showed much faster transgene expression, detectable after just 4 h, and maximum levels achieved by 12 h (Fig. 3). Recent studies have suggested that active nuclear transport of DNA leads to a noticeably earlier onset of transgene expression (8Zanta M.A. Belguise Valladier P. Behr J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar), and this raised the possibility that melittin might exert a post-endosomal function, possibly enhancing transfer of the DNA into the nucleus. To probe the usefulness of melittin in overcoming intracellular barriers others than endosomal release, we evaluated its transfection-enhancing effects in either fast growing B16F10 cells (grown at low density) or confluent cells with reduced cycling activity (Fig. 4). Rapidly dividing cells (8000 cells/well, 71 ± 2% BrdUrd-positive) always showed greater susceptibility to transfection than confluent cells (80,000 cells/well, 39 ± 5% BrdUrd-positive), and mel-PEI·DNA complexes showed better activity than PEI·DNA. The endosomolytic drug chloroquine increased transgene expression in rapidly dividing cells with PEI·DNA but not mel-PEI·DNA, perhaps suggesting that endosomal escape restricts expression of PEI·DNA in these cells, whereas the presence of melittin removes this barrier. Surprisingly, using confluent cells chloroquine did not enhance transgene expression with PEI·DNA, although it did potentiate mel-PEI·DNA. This could suggest that other factors in confluent cells, such as decreased nuclear membrane permeability, might restrict the activity of PEI·DNA conjugates more than the activity o"

Preincubation with the reduced glutathione (GSH) synthesis inhibitorl-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine (BSO) always potentiated peroxide accumulation. However, although GSH depletion potentiated the toxicity of cisplatin and melphalan, occasionally switching the mode of death from apoptosis to necrosis, it did not affect the toxicity of the other antitumor drugs. Hypoxia or preincubation with antioxidant agents attenuated death induction, apoptotic and necrotic, by alkylating drugs. The generation of necrosis by cisplatin could not be mimicked by addition of exogenous H2O2 instead of BSO and was not adequately explained by caspase inactivation nor by a selective fall in ATP content. Treatment with cisplatin and melphalan caused a late decrease in mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨm), which was much greater during necrosis than during apoptosis. The administration of the antioxidant agents N-acetyl-l-cysteine and butylated hydroxyanisole after pulse treatment with cisplatin or melphalan did not affect apoptosis but attenuated necrosis.

Med. 1993; 117: 1208-1214PubMed Google Scholar, 3Majno G. Joris I. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 3-15PubMed Google Scholar). Among other aspects, during apoptosis the cells undergo nuclear and cytoplasmic shrinkage, the chromatin is condensed and partitioned into multiple fragments, and the cells are finally broken into multiple membrane-surrounded bodies (apoptotic bodies). However, the plasma membrane retains the integrity during the process. By contrast, necrosis is characterized by cell swelling, lysis of intracellular organella, and rapid disintegration of the plasma membrane. Apoptosis seems to be clearly advantageous for the organism, because the elimination of the apoptotic cells or the resulting apoptotic bodies by phagocytosis prevents the release of intracellular content and the consequent damage of the surrounding tissue, as it occurs during necrosis. Hence, it seems very important to elucidate the mechanisms that regulate apoptosis and necrosis and the factors that may decide the selection between one or the other mode of death. One of the most complex aspects in the regulation of cell death is the role of intracellular oxidation. It was initially proposed that oxidation could be a general mediator of apoptosis (4Buttke T.H. Sandstrom P.A. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 7-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2089) Google Scholar). In fact, (i) exposure to reactive oxygen species (ROS),1 such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or nitric oxide (NO), induces apoptosis in different cell types (5Lennon S.V. Martin S.J. Cotter T.G. Cell Prolif. 1991; 24: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar, 6Albina J.E. Cui S. Mateo R.B. Reichner J.S. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 5080-5085PubMed Google Scholar); (ii) many apoptotic inducers, which are not ROS themselves, cause intracellular oxidation,e.g. growth factor deprivation, glucocorticoids, UV irradiation, and some cytotoxic drugs (7Benchekroun M.N.

Valentine J.S. Örd T. Bredesen D.E. Science. 1993; 262: 1274-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar). However, the relationship between oxidation and apoptosis is far from being clear. In fact, (i) some forms of apoptosis may take place under very low oxygen tensions, in which ROS generation is expected to be absent or greatly reduced (13Jacobson M.D. Raff M.C. Nature. 1995; 374: 814-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 14Muschel R.J. Bernhard E.J. Garza L. McKenna W.G. Koch C.J. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 995-998PubMed Google Scholar), or in the presence of antioxidants (13Jacobson M.D. Raff M.C. Nature. 1995; 374: 814-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar); (ii) pre-exposure to hyperoxia inhibited H2O2-provoked apoptosis in lung adenocarcinoma cells (15Franek W.R. Horowitz S. Stansberry L. Kazzaz J.A. Koo H.C. Li Y. Arita Y. Davis J.M. Mantell A.S. Scott W. Mantell L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 569-575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar); and (iii) low ROS concentrations may promote proliferation and prevent apoptosis in some cell models (16, and references therein). An additional factor of interest is given by the fact that the intensity of oxidation may be determinant for the mode of death. For instance, treatment with H2O2provoked apoptosis or necrosis, depending on the concentration used (5Lennon S.V. Martin S.J. Cotter T.G. Cell Prolif. 1991; 24: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar), and the administration of low concentrations of H2O2 sufficed to inhibit apoptosis and cause necrotic-like death in antitumor drug-treated Burkitt's lymphoma cells (17Shacter E. Williams J.A. Hinson R.M. Senturker S. Lee Y.J. Blood. 2000; 96: 307-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is known that the toxicity of antitumor drugs may largely depend on the intracellular level of reduced glutathione (GSH). Thus, depletion of GSH by prolonged incubation withl-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine (BSO), a specific inhibitor of γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase, increased the lethality of the DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor CPT-11 in V79 hamster lung fibroblasts (18Sawyer T.E. Bonner J.A. Br. J. Cancer Suppl. 1996; 27: S109-S113PubMed Google Scholar), of the DNA topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide in K562 human erythroleukemia cells (19Gantchev T.G. Hunting D.J.

Chemother. 1994; 6: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The influence of GSH was particularly evident in the case of alkylating agents, where BSO was occasionally able to change the mode of death from apoptosis to necrosis (24Fernandes R.S. Cotter T.G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 675-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 25Sugimoto C. Matsukawa S. Fujieda S. Noda Y. Tanaka N. Tsuzuki H. Saito H. Anticancer Res. 1996; 16: 675-680PubMed Google Scholar). Because GSH is the main antioxidant system in the cell, a possible explanation is that GSH depletion facilitates ROS accumulation in cells treated with antitumor drugs (26Miyajima A. Nakashima J. Yoshioka K. Tachibana M. Takazi H. Murai M. Br. J. Cancer. 1997; 76: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), which in turn increases their lethality. To test the validity of this hypothesis, in the present work we comparatively examined the capacity of BSO to modulate ROS production and cell death in U-937 human promonocytic cells treated with different antitumor drugs. The effects of exogenous H2O2and antioxidant agents, and the possible role of oxidation-related events, such as caspase inactivation, ATP depletion, and mitochondrial dysfunction, were also considered. U-937 promonocytic leukemia cells (27Sundström C. Nilsson K. Int. J. Cancer. 1976; 17: 565-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (1945) Google Scholar) were grown in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS, Life Technologies, Inc.) and 0.2% sodium bicarbonate and antibiotics in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Monochlorobimane, dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA), rhodamine 123 (R123), and 5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide (JC-1), were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR); benzyloxy-carbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (Z-VAD-Fmk) from Enzyme Systems Products (Dublin, CA); and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) from Serva (Heidelberg, Germany). All other reagents were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (Madrid, Spain). Stock solutions of etoposide (20 mm), camptothecin (10 mm), monochlorobimane (200 mm),N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC, 3 m), dihydroethidium (DHE, 10 mm), Z-VAD-Fmk (20 mm), JC-1 (0.3 mm), carbonyl cyanidep-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (10 mm), and oligomycin (30 mm) were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide; butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA, 0.5 m) and H2DCFDA (5 mm) in ethanol; melphalan (164 mm) in a mixture of ethanol/HCl (40/1, v/v); andcis-platinum(II)-diammine dichloride (cisplatin, 3.3 mm) and doxorubicin (20 mm) in distilled water. All these solutions were stored at −20 °C. In some experiments we used a commercial preparation of cisplatin (PLACIS, Chiesi Wasserman, Barcelona, Spain), with similar results. Stock solutions of DAPI (10 μg/ml), propidium iodide (PI, 1 mg/ml), and R123 (1 mg/ml) were prepared in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and stored at 4 °C. BSO (50 mm) was freshly prepared in distilled water, just before use. For GSH depletion, the cells were incubated for 24 h with 1 mm BSO, as earlier described by Ghibelli et al. (28Ghibelli L. Coppola S. Rotilio G. Lafavia E. Maresca V. Ciriolo M.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Under these conditions BSO did not affect cell proliferation nor viability, at least during 30 h of incubation. For ATP depletion, the cells were incubated in the presence of 10 μm oligomycin in glucose-free RPMI medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 1 mm sodium pyruvate and 10% dialyzed FCS. Oligomycin inhibits mitochondrial F0- or F1-ATPases and depletion of glucose blocks glycolysis, suppressing all sources of ATP (29Eguchi Y. Shimizu S. Tsujimoto Y. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1835-1840PubMed Google Scholar). Hypoxia was induced with the use of a cell culture incubator perfused with 1% O2/5% CO2/94% N2. The analysis of samples was carried out using an EPICS XL flow cytometer (Coulter, Hialeah, FL) equipped with an air-cooled argon laser tuned to 488 nm. The specific fluorescence signals corresponding to H2DCFDA and R123 were collected with a 525-nm band pass filter, the signal corresponding to JC-1 with a 575-nm band pass filter, and the signals corresponding to PI and DHE with a 620-nm band pass filter. To analyze changes in nuclear morphology, cells were collected by centrifugation, washed with PBS, resuspended in PBS, and mounted on glass slides. After fixation in 70% (v/v) ethanol, the cells were stained for 20 min at room temperature in PBS containing 1 μg/ml DAPI and examined by fluorescence microscopy. Apoptosis was characterized by chromatin condensation followed by partition into multiple bodies. Within the experimental time periods used in this work, non-apoptotic, primary necrotic cells still exhibited diffuse and uniform chromatin staining, as untreated cells. To measure loss of DNA, cells were collected by centrifugation and incubated for 30 min in PBS containing 0.5 mg/ml RNase A. After the addition of PI (final concentration of 50 μg/ml) and permeabilization with Nonidet P-40 (0.1%, w/v), the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Late apoptotic cells exhibited sub-G1 PI incorporation (hypo-diploid cells). Within the experimental time periods used, non-apoptotic, primary necrotic cells did not exhibit significant loss of DNA nor significant alterations in the cell cycle distribution in relation to untreated cells. The criterion currently used to examine necrosis was the loss of membrane integrity, as measured by massive influx of either trypan blue or PI in non-permeabilized cells. In the first case, cells were incubated for 5 min with 0.2% (w/v) trypan blue and examined by microscopy using a Neubauer hemacytometer. Under these conditions, only necrotic cells were clearly stained. In the second case, non-permeabilized cells were suspended in PBS containing 50 μg/ml PI, and the fluorescence was analyzed by flow cytometry. Under these conditions only necrotic cells exhibited great fluorescence, whereas the fluorescence was null or very low in apoptotic cells (30Bedner E. Li X. Gorczyca W. Melamed M.R. Darzynkiewicz Z. Cytometry. 1999; 35: 181-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The intracellular accumulation of ROS was determined using the fluorescent probes DHE and H2DCFDA. DHE preferentially measures O⨪2(31Benov L. Sztejnberg L. Fridovich Y. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 25: 826-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). H2DCFDA was commonly used to measure H2O2 (32LeBel C.P. Ischiropoulos H. Bondy S.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1992; 5: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (2190) Google Scholar), but it is now accepted that this probe is also sensitive to other peroxides (33Ischiropoulos H. Gow A. Thom S.R. Kooy N.W. Royall J.A. Crow J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 301: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). With this aim, 1 h prior to treatment with the cytotoxic agents the cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in RPMI medium without red phenol, and loaded with either 5 μm H2DCFDA or 2 μm DHE. The fluorescence was measured at the desired time intervals by flow cytometry. Control cells were subjected to the same manipulation, except for treatment with the cytotoxic agents. Cells were washed with PBS and then incubated for 20 min at 37 °C with PBS containing either 50 nm JC-1 or 1 μg/ml R123. After washing twice with FCS (in the case of JC-1) or once with PBS (in the case of R123), the cells were resuspended in PBS and the fluorescence was measured by flow cytometry. Under these conditions, incubation with the depolarizing agent carbonyl cyanidep-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (100 μm) greatly decreased ΔΨm. To determine the total intracellular GSH content, samples of 5 × 106 cells were washed and resuspended in 400 μl of PBS containing 2 mm monochlorobimane (34Fernández-Checa J.C. Kaplowitz N. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 190: 212-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Upon incubation for 30 min at 37 °C in the dark, the cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 400 μl of PBS. Aliquots of 100 μl were taken to estimate the fluorescence, using a POLARstar Galaxy fluorometer (BMG Labtechnologies, Offenburg, Germany) at excitation wavelength of 390 nm and emission wavelength of 520 nm. To determine the mitochondrial GSH, samples of 1.5 × 108 cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in 8 ml of ice-cold buffer A (20 mm Hepes-KOH, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mmKH2PO4, 1 mm EGTA, 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6), and homogenized by 10 strokes in an ice-cold Dounce homogenizer. Non-lysed cells and nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 750 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatant centrifuged again at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the resulting mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of ice-cold buffer A. Aliquots of 100 μl were taken to estimate the mitochondrial GSH content, as indicated above. To estimate the intracellular ATP content, aliquots of 2 × 106 cells were collected in a pre-heated (70 °C) buffer consisting of 100 mm Tris and 4 mm EDTA, pH 8, and heated for 2 min at 100 °C. After cooling on ice and centrifugation at 1500 × gfor 1 min 4 °C, the ATP content in the supernatants was determined using an ATP Bioluminescence Assay kit CLSII (Roche Diagnostics, Barcelona, Spain), following the procedure indicated by the manufacturer, and a TD-20/29 luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA). ATP standard curves (linear in the range of 5–500 nm) were carried out in all experiments. Extracts from cells depleted of ATP by incubation with oligomycin-containing glucose-free medium were used as control of the technique. The whole procedure was as previously described (35Vilaboa N.E. Garcı́a-Bermejo L. Pérez C. De Blas E. Calle C. Aller P. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 201-207PubMed Google Scholar). The antibody used was rabbit anti-human PKCδ polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). First, we investigated the capacity of antitumor drugs to cause intracellular oxidation, either under standard culture conditions or following GSH depletion. The antitumor drugs used were as follows: the DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors etoposide and doxorubicin, the DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin, and the alkylating agents cisplatin and melphalan. As a positive control, cells were treated with x-rays (20 grays), a well-known oxidation-inducing agent (36Cerutti P.A. Science. 1985; 227: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (2314) Google Scholar). For GSH depletion, the cells were preincubated for 24 h with 1 mm BSO, which was maintained during treatment with the antitumor drugs and during recovery after x-rays treatment. Measurements using the GSH-sensitive probe monochlorobimane revealed that BSO caused an ∼70% decrease in both the total intracellular and mitochondrial GSH pools (from 8.9 and 0.06 nmol/106 cells for total and mitochondrial GSH, respectively, in untreated cells; to 2.6 and 0.019 nmol/106 cells for total and mitochondrial GSH, respectively, in BSO-treated cells). Oxidation was determined by measuring the H2DCFDA- and DHE-derived fluorescence, as an indication of peroxides and anion superoxide accumulation, respectively. Fig. 1 shows the results obtained with 10 and 100 μm etoposide, with 7.5 and 30 μm doxorubicin, with 0.4 and 4 μmcamptothecin, with 100 and 500 μm cisplatin, and with 40 and 750 μm melphalan. Treatment with all antitumor drugs increased the H2DCFDA-derived fluorescence, which was roughly independent of drug concentration (with the only exception of melphalan), and was always potentiated by preincubation with BSO. The increase in fluorescence was always inhibited in a 50–70% by the H2O2-specific scavenger catalase (results not shown; see also Fig. 4), indicating that it represented at least in part H2O2 accumulation. By contrast, we were unable to detect any increase in DHE-derived fluorescence in cells treated for 30–120 min with the antitumor drugs, either with or without preincubation with BSO (Fig. 1 A, and results not shown). In this later assay doxorubicin was omitted, due to its strong autofluorescence at 620 nm.Figure 4Effects of hypoxia and antioxidant agents. For hypoxia (hypo), the cells were incubated at 1% O2 atmosphere. The antioxidant agents were: catalase (Cat, 500 units/ml), SOD (400 units/ml), BHA (200 μm), and NAC (15 mm). A, frequency of apoptotic and necrotic cells in untreated cultures (Cont); in cultures incubated for 24 h with BSO (BSO); and in cultures treated for 8 h with cisplatin, with or without preincubation with BSO, and in the absence (−) or the presence of antioxidants or under hypoxic conditions. The antioxidants were applied 2 h before cisplatin and maintained during the treatment period. B, modulation of the H2DCFDA-derived fluorescence at 30 min of treatment with cisplatin, following the same experimental conditions as inA. The values (mean ± S.D. of three determinations) are expressed in relation to untreated cells (Cont), which received the arbitrary value of one. C, changes in the frequency of apoptosis and necrosis by addition of antioxidant agents at 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 h of treatment with cisplatin. D, frequency of apoptotic and necrotic cells in BSO-preincubated cultures pulse-treated for 3 h with cisplatin or melphalan, then washed, and finally allowed to recover for 5 h in the absence or presence of antioxidant agents. BSO was always present during the recovery period. E, relative intracellular GSH content in BSO-preincubated cells treated for 6 h with cisplatin, with and without pre-treatment with antioxidant agents (Pre-treat); and in BSO-preincubated cells pulse-treated for 3 h with cisplatin and allowed to recover for 3 h with and without antioxidant agents (Post-treat). The values (mean ± S.D. of three determinations) are expressed in relation to untreated cells, which received the arbitrary value of one. All other conditions were as in Fig. 1. Approximate GSH content in untreated cultures: 9 nmol/106 cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Then, we analyzed the capacity of the antitumor drugs and x-rays, with and without preincubation with BSO, to cause cell death. The results, indicated in Fig. 2, were as follows: (i) Treatment with all agents in the absence of BSO caused death by apoptosis, as revealed by the presence of cells with fragmented chromatin. Increasing the drug concentration, or the x-ray dosage, increased or accelerated apoptosis but did not significantly cause necrosis, as revealed by the low frequency of trypan blue-stained cells. (ii) Preincubation with BSO did not affect the frequency nor the mode of death (apoptosis) caused by etoposide, camptothecin, doxorubicin, and x-rays. (iii) By contrast, BSO inhibited apoptosis and occasionally caused necrosis in cells treated with cisplatin. Thus, when used with 100 μmcisplatin BSO delayed cell death, but the mode of death was mostly apoptotic; when used with 500 μm cisplatin, BSO almost totally switched the mode of death from apoptosis to necrosis; and when used with 250 μm cisplatin, BSO caused a mixed situation,i.e. approximately equal amounts of apoptosis and necrosis (results not shown; see also Fig. 6 A). The generation of necrosis by cisplatin plus BSO was slightly delayed (∼2–3 h) in relation to the generation of apoptosis by cisplatin alone. Thus, although 500 μm cisplatin alone caused ∼95% apoptotic cells at 6 h of treatment, a similar amount of necrotic cells was obtained at 8–9 h of treatment with BSO plus 500 μmcisplatin. (iv) As in the case of cisplatin, BSO almost totally switched the mode of death from apoptosis to necrosis when used with 750 μm melphalan, suggesting that this phenomenon is a common characteristic of alkylating agents. However, BSO slightly accelerated or potentiated the generation of apoptosis without causing necrosis when used with a low concentration of melphalan (40 μm) and caused a mixed situation (approximately equal amounts of apoptosis and necrosis) when used with 400 μmmelphalan (result not shown).Figure 6Effect of the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-Fmk on cell death. A, frequency of apoptotic and necrotic cells in untreated cultures (Cont) and in cultures treated for the indicated time periods with BSO plus the indicated concentrations of cisplatin, either in the absence (−) or presence of 50 μm Z-VAD-Fmk. B, frequency of apoptotic and necrotic cells in untreated cultures (Cont) and in cultures treated for the indicated time periods with 500 μmcisplatin alone, either in the absence (−) or presence of 50 μm Z-VAD-Fmk. All determinations were repeated three times with similar results. All other conditions were as in Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The necrotic cells obtained by treatment with BSO plus cisplatin or BSO plus melphalan exhibited cytoplasmic swelling and diffuse non-fragmented chromatin (Fig. 3 A, and results not shown), suggesting that the observed necrosis is primary necrosis instead of apoptosis-derived secondary necrosis. To corroborate this fact, we measured other apoptotic and necrotic markers. It was observed that treatment with 500 μm cisplatin alone caused accumulation of cells with sub-G1 DNA content, which is a typical marker of apoptosis, but this characteristic was absent in BSO plus 500 μm cisplatin-treated cells (Fig. 3 B). By contrast, although free PI uptake was very low in cells treated with cisplatin alone, it was greatly increased in cells treated with BSO plus 500 μm cisplatin, indicating loss of plasma membrane integrity (Fig. 3 C). Finally, although cisplatin alone elicited the typical caspase-3-mediated PKCδ cleavage to give a fragment of ∼40 kDa, characteristic of apoptosis (37Ghayur T. Hugunin M. Talanian R.V. Ratnofsky S. Quinlan C. Emoto Y. Pandey P. Datta R. Huang Y. Kharbanda S. Allen H. Kamen R. Wong W. Kufe D. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 2399-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar), BSO plus 500 μm cisplatin did not (Fig. 3 D). Taken together, these results indicate that the observed necrosis is abona fide apoptosis-independent, primary necrosis. To investigate the possible relevance of oxidation for apoptosis and necrosis induction, cells were treated with cisplatin either under hypoxic conditions or in the presence of antioxidant agents. The antioxidants used were catalase (500 units/ml, specific for H2O2), SOD (400 units/ml, specific for O⨪2), and the nonspecific ROS scavenger BHA (200 μm). Under these conditions, both hypoxia and the antioxidant agents were innocuous, at least during 9 h of incubation. Some of the obtained results are represented in Fig. 4 A. It was observed that hypoxia and preincubation with catalase and BHA attenuated the generation apoptosis by cisplatin, as well as the generation of necrosis by BSO plus cisplatin. However, although hypoxia and BHA reduced necrosis without concomitant increase in apoptosis, catalase caused a partial reversion from necrosis to apoptosis. Under these conditions both BHA and catalase inhibited, albeit to different extent, the increase in H2DCFDA-derived fluorescence caused by both cisplatin alone and BSO plus cisplatin (Fig. 4 B). Preincubation with SOD did not prevent apoptosis nor necrosis, which is consistent with the apparent failure of the antitumor drugs to cause O⨪2 accumulation (Fig. 1). The antioxidant agents caused the same effects on both cell death and ROS generation when cisplatin was substituted by melphalan (results not shown). Catalase also decreased the generation of apoptosis and the increase in H2DCFDA-derived fluorescence in cells treated with etoposide and camptothecin, whereas SOD was ineffective (results not shown). In the experiments performed above, the antioxidant agents were applied prior to treatme"

Here, we investigate the detailed structure between 410 and 660 kilometers depth, by making use of regional stacks of precursors to the SS phase. The previously observed discontinuity at about 520 kilometers depth is confirmed in many regions, but is found to be absent in others. There are a number of regions in which we find two discontinuities at about 500 and 560 kilometers depth, an effect which can be interpreted as a “splitting” of the 520 kilometer discontinuity. These observations provide seismic constraints on the sharpness and observability of mineralogical phase transitions in the mantle transition zone."
https://openalex.org/W1557197358,"Zinc-dependent metalloproteases can mediate the shedding of the extracellular domain of many unrelated transmembrane proteins from the cell surface. In most instances, this process, also known as ectodomain shedding, is regulated via protein kinase C (PKC). The tumor necrosis factor α-converting enzyme (TACE) was the first protease involved in regulated protein ectodomain shedding identified. Although TACE belongs to the family of metalloprotease-disintegrins, few members of this family have been shown to participate in regulated ectodomain shedding. In fact, the phenotype of tace −/− cells and that of Chinese hamster ovary cell mutants defective in ectodomain shedding points to the existence of a common PKC-activated ectodomain shedding system, whose proteolytic component is TACE, that acts on a variety of transmembrane proteins. Examples of these proteins include the Alzheimer’s disease-related protein β-amyloid precursor protein (βAPP) and the transmembrane growth factors protransforming growth factor-α (pro-TGF-α) and, as shown in this report, proheparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (pro-HB-EGF). Here we show that the mercurial compound 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate (APMA), frequently used to activatein vitro recombinant matrix metalloproteases, is an activator of the shedding of βAPP, pro-HB-EGF, and pro-TGF-α. Treatment of tace −/− cells or Chinese hamster ovary shedding-defective mutants with APMA activates the cleavage of pro-TGF-α but not that of pro-HB-EGF or βAPP, indicating that APMA activates TACE and also a previously unacknowledged proteolytic activity specific for pro-TGF-α. Characterization of this proteolytic activity indicates that it acts on pro-TGF-α located at the cell surface and that it is a metalloprotease active in cells defective in furin activity.

Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 606-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The diversity of the extracellular domains susceptible to being proteolytically released, which include transmembrane growth factors and cytokines, growth factor receptors, cell adhesion molecules, and ectoenzymes, has prompted cell biologists from different backgrounds to study the components and mechanisms involved in ectodomain shedding. In certain cases ectodomain shedding also has a practical interest; for example, the shedding of the ectodomain of the β-amyloid precursor protein (βAPP)1 prevents the formation of the β-amyloid peptide, a component of the lesions found in brains of patients with Alzheimer’s disease (2Selkoe D.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 447-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). Two aspects seem to be common to most, if not all, shedding events: they are controlled by shared regulatory mechanisms, the best characterized of which involves protein kinase C (PKC), and they are mediated by zinc-dependent metalloproteases (for reviews, see Refs. 3Schlöndorff J. Blobel C.P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3603-3617Crossref PubMed Google Scholarand 4Kiessling L.L. Gordon E.J. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: R49-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Hydroxamate-derived compounds, which efficiently inhibit zinc-dependent members of the matrix metalloprotease and metalloprotease-disintegrin families, block the PKC-activated shedding of all proteins tested to date, suggesting that proteases that belong to these families are responsible for activated ectodomain shedding (1Blobel C.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 606-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The metalloprotease-disintegrin TACE was identified as the first one involved in a particular shedding event: that of the cytokine pro-TNF-α (5Black R.A. Rauch C.T. Kozlosky C.J. Peschon J.J.

The family of metalloprotease-disintegrins (also known as ADAM (adisintegrin andmetalloprotease) or MDC (metalloprotease/disintegrin/cysteine-rich)) comprises 14 members with predicted proteolytic activity (7Primakoff P. Myles D.G. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 83-87Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Given the diversity of the proteins that can be shed and the number of potentially active metalloprotease-disintegrins, it is frequently assumed that several metalloprotease-disintegrins, each one endowed with a particular specificity, are involved in ectodomain shedding. However, mouse fibroblasts expressing an inactive form of TACE (tace −/− cells) show defects in ectodomain shedding that are not restricted to pro-TNF-α and related molecules (8Peschon J. Slack J.

The shedding of the majority of these proteins can be activated via PKC; thus, the phenotype of tace −/− mouse fibroblasts indicates that, at least in this cell type, TACE plays a central role in PKC-mediated ectodomain shedding. Another independent piece of evidence points to the existence of a general shedding machinery regulated by PKC whose proteolytic component is TACE. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) mutant cell lines (M2) initially isolated for lack of activated pro-TGF-α shedding are also defective in an unidentified gene that is different from PKC or TACE but necessary for the regulated shedding of pro-TNF-α, L-selectin, interleukin-6 receptor α, and βAPP (14Arribas J. Massagué J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 15Arribas J. Coodly L. Vollmer P. Kishimoto T.K. Rose-John S. Massagué J. J. Biol.

In contrast to the apparent preponderant role of TACE in protein ectodomain shedding, few reports have implicated other metalloprotease-disintegrins in this process. The shedding of angiotensin-converting enzyme and that of the TNF-related protein TRANCE is normal in tace −/− cells, indicating that TACE is not responsible for these shedding events (17Sadhukhan R.

Also, ADAM10/Kuzbanian has been suggested to act on βAPP and on the ligand of the Notch receptor, Delta, in human embryonic kidney cells and Drosophila melanogaster, respectively (19Lammich S.

However, in this report we show thattace −/− mouse fibroblasts or CHO shedding-defective cell mutants show a lack of constitutive and activated pro-HB-EGF shedding, indicating that TACE is responsible for the shedding of this growth factor in these cell types and opening the possibility that pro-HB-EGF is a substrate of different metalloprotease-disintegrins in different cell lines. Thus, despite expectations, the number of proteins whose PKC-activated shedding is found to be dependent on TACE is continuously growing, while little evidence on alternative proteolytic activities involved in regulated ectodomain shedding has been reported so far. Since the majority of shedding events activated via PKC seem to be dependent on TACE, we have analyzed the effect of compounds with the potential to induce ectodomain shedding independently of PKC to determine the possible role of other proteolytic activities in ectodomain shedding. Here we present evidence showing that the mercurial compound 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate (APMA), frequently used to activate recombinant matrix metalloproteasesin vitro (22Birkedal-Hansen H. Curr.

The products of the shedding of βAPP, pro-HB-EGF, and pro-TGF-α induced by APMA are indistinguishable from those produced by TACE, indicating that APMA activates TACE and/or proteolytic activity(ies) with similar characteristics. Treatment oftace −/− cells or CHO shedding-defective mutants with APMA dramatically activates the shedding of pro-TGF-α but not those of pro-HB-EGF and βAPP. These results indicate that APMA activates TACE and also a previously unacknowledged proteolytic activity specific for pro-TGF-α. Characterization of this proteolytic activity indicates that it is a metalloprotease inhibited by hydroxamate-derived compounds that does not require processing by furin to be activated by APMA and that it acts on cell surface but not on intracellular pro-TGF-α. In summary, the use of APMA and shedding-defective cell lines as tools has unveiled the existence of a specific metalloprotease activity alternative to TACE with the ability to shed the ectodomain of pro-TGF-α. Anti-HA monoclonal antibodies were from Babco (Richmond, CA), the monoclonal anti-βAPP antibodies 22C11 and anti-Alz90 were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, the polyclonal antibody against the cytoplasmic domain of βAPP was a gift from Dr. Sam Gandy, and the polyclonal antibodies against the cytoplasmic tail of pro-TGF-α have been previously described (23Bosenberg M.W. Pandiella A. Massagué J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1157-1165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG was from Amersham Biosciences, Inc., and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG was from Becton Dickinson (Mountain View, CA). APMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), aprotinin, 1,10-phenantroline, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, EDTA, pepstatin A, and leupeptin were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. BB-94 (Batimastat) was kindly provided by British Biotech Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. (Oxford, United Kingdom). Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin, and the SuperSignal chemiluminescence kit were from Pierce. Cell culture reagents were from Life Technologies Ltd. Pro-HB-EGF was amplified from a HeLa cDNA library using appropriate oligonucleotides and subcloned into pCEP-4 vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). The HA epitope was inserted at the N terminus of the mature growth factor, between amino acids 77 and 78, using PCR and standard techniques. The pro-HA/TGF-α and the C-terminal pro-HA/TGF-α mutant (V159G) have been described elsewhere (24Ureña J. Merlos-Suárez A. Baselga J. Arribas J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 773-784Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Wild type CHO cells expressing pro-HA/TGF-α or pro-HA/TGF-α V158G, the M2 mutant cell line, tace −/− fibroblasts, and the corresponding wild type cell lines have been described previously (16Merlos-Suárez A. Fernández-Larrea J. Reddy P. Baselga J. Arribas J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24955-24962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 24Ureña J. Merlos-Suárez A. Baselga J. Arribas J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 773-784Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The furin-defective CHO mutant cell line, RPE.40, kindly provided by Dr. Joseph Sucic, was grown in DMEM F-12 supplemented with 1% nonessential amino acids and 7.5% fetal bovine serum. The various cell lines were permanently co-transfected with the pro-HA/TGF-α or pro-HA/HB-EGF constructs and the selectable plasmid pREP-4 (Invitrogen) at a DNA ratio of 25:1 using the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described previously (14Arribas J. Massagué J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Transfectants were selected in 600 μg/ml hygromycin and subcloned. The levels of expression of pro-HA/TGF-α or pro-HA/HB-EGF were assessed by flow cytometry using anti-HA antibodies and a FACScan instrument and software (Becton Dickinson). Approximately 3 × 106 cells expressing pro-HA/TGF-α or a pro-HA/TGF-α C-terminal mutant were metabolically labeled with 500 μCi/ml [35S]cysteine (Biolink 2000, Arlington Heights, IL) for 45 min in cysteine-free medium at 37 °C and chased for variable periods of time in complete medium with or without 1 μm PMA, 0.5 mm APMA, or APMA and BB-94 at 37 or 23 °C as indicated. Conditioned media were harvested in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture (10 mm1,10-phenantroline, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm EDTA, 20 μm pepstatin A, and 10 μm leupeptin). Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and the mixture of protease inhibitors), and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation; cell lysates were then immunoprecipitated with polyclonal antibodies against the cytoplasmic domain of pro-TFG-α or anti-HA monoclonal antibodies. Endogenous βAPP was immunoprecipitated with polyclonal antibodies against the cytoplasmic domain of this protein. Immune complexes were collected with protein A-Sepharose, washed three times with washing buffer (PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% SDS), analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels of the appropriate reticulation (13% for cell-associated pro-TGF-α and 15% for soluble TGF-α), and quantified using a BAS-1800 instrument and software (Fujifilm). For immunoprecipitation of pro-TGF-α located at the cell surface, CHO or tace −/− cells expressing pro-HA/TGF-α were metabolically labeled as above, chased for 15 min in DMEM, and shifted to 4 °C. Cells were then incubated with PBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin and 5 μg/ml anti-HA monoclonal antibodies, washed extensively with DMEM, shifted to 37 °C, and further chased for 20 min in the presence or absence of 0.5 mm APMA. Conditioned media were harvested, and cell lysates were prepared as indicated above. Immune complexes were recovered with protein A-Sepharose, washed, and analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Approximately 3 × 106parental HeLa, CHO, M2, or tace −/− cells or the same cells permanently transfected with pro-HA/HB-EGF were washed with DMEM and treated with 1 ml of DMEM with or without 1 μm PMA or 0.5 mm APMA for variable periods of time. Conditioned media were harvested in the presence of proteinase inhibitors, and cells were lysed as described above. Aliquots from conditioned media and from cell lysates were subjected to Western blotting analysis using the monoclonal anti-βAPP antibodies 22C11 or Alz90 as recommended by the manufacturers or 5 μg/ml anti-HA. Signals were detected with SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (Pierce). Films were digitized and quantified using MacBAS® software (Fujifilm). Exponentially growingtace −/− cells permanently expressing pro-HA/TGF-α were washed with DMEM, incubated with PBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin and 5 μg/ml anti-HA monoclonal antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C, shifted to 37 or 23 °C, and incubated in DMEM for variable periods of time. Cells were then stained for 30 min at 4 °C with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Becton Dickinson) in PBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin. Cell surface pro-HA/TGF-α levels were monitored with a FACScan instrument and software (Becton Dickinson). To determine whether APMA, an activator of matrix metalloproteases (22Birkedal-Hansen H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 728-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar) and metalloprotease-disintegrins (25Milla M.E. Leesnitzer M.A. Moss M.L. Clay W.C. Carter H.L. Miller A.B. Su J.L. Lambert M.H. Willard D.H. Sheeley D.M. Kost T.A. Burkhart W. Moyer M. Blackburn R.K. Pahel G.L. Mitchell J.L. Hoffman C.R. Becherer J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30563-30570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), is also an activator of the shedding of transmembrane proteins, we initially analyzed its effect on the shedding of one of the substrates of TACE, βAPP. Western blot analysis of CHO cell lysates with the antibody 22C11, directed against the N terminus of βAPP, revealed the typical array of immature and fully modified, mature forms of βAPP (Fig.1) that have been extensively characterized (26Weidemann A. Konig G. Bunke D. Fischer P. Salbaum J.M. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Cell. 1989; 57: 115-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, APMA induced a dose-dependent decrease in the amount of mature βAPP and, concomitantly, a release of soluble βAPP, also in a dose-dependent manner. The effect of APMA is rapid (t12∼12 min) (Fig. 1, C and D) and similar in different cell lines, including HeLa (Fig. 1, B and D). To extend these results, we also analyzed the shedding of the EGF receptor ligands pro-TGF-α and pro-HB-EGF. APMA was also found to activate the shedding of these molecules from CHO cells with a dose dependence and time course indistinguishable from those found for βAPP (data not shown). Therefore, these results show that APMA is an activator of the shedding of diverse molecules such as βAPP, pro-TFG-α, or -HB-EGF. To characterize the effect of APMA, we compared the electrophoretic migration of the products of the shedding of βAPP, pro-TGF-α, or pro-HB-EGF induced by APMA with that of the products produced by the PKC activator PMA, which activates the shedding of these molecules mediated by TACE (8Peschon J.

Sehara-Fujisawa A. Ohno S. Mekada E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7260-7272Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Several types of proteolytic activities, collectively known as secretases, act on βAPP. TACE possesses α-secretase activity since it cleaves βAPP, upon PKC activation, within the β-amyloid peptide, releasing the ectodomain of βAPP (Fig.2 A, schematic). As shown in Fig. 2 A, the migration of the ∼15-kDa stub that remains associated with cells after activation with APMA is indistinguishable from that generated by α-secretase under basal conditions or after PMA treatment. In addition, using monoclonal antibodies directed against the N terminus or the C terminus of the ectodomain of βAPP, equivalent soluble fragments are detected in the conditioned media of cells treated with PMA or APMA (Fig.2 A). In agreement with previous results, permanently transfected CHO cells express several pro-HB-EGF species of 20–30 kDa that differ in their glycosylation state and, therefore, in their electrophoretic migration (27Gechtman Z. Alonso J.L. Raab G. Ingber D.E. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28828-28835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The HA epitope was introduced at the N terminus of the mature growth factor (Fig. 2 B,schematic) to facilitate the detection of cell-associated pro-HB-EGF as well as soluble HB-EGF. The different forms of pro-TGF-α also differ in their glycosylation state and have been characterized previously (14Arribas J. Massagué J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The electrophoretic migration of the ectodomains of pro-TGF-α or pro-HB-EGF or the transmembrane/cytoplasmic domain of pro-TGF-α generated after APMA treatment are indistinguishable from those generated after PMA treatment (Figs. 2, B and C). These results indicate that APMA activates one (or more) proteolytic activity(ies) that cleaves βAPP, pro-TGF-α, and pro-HB-EGF at a site very proximal, if not identical, to that cleaved by the shedding activities activated by PKC. Therefore, APMA could be an activator of the metalloprotease-disintegrins previously found to act on the molecules analyzed, or alternatively, APMA could activate novel endogenous proteolytic activities with similar, if not identical, specificity(ies). One of the strongest evidences indicating that TACE has a role in the shedding of βAPP and pro-TGF-α is the lack of shedding of these molecules intace −/− cells (8Peschon J. Slack J. Reddy P.

Chem. 1998; 273: 24955-24962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In addition, the shedding of both molecules is affected in a mutant cell line (M2), initially isolated for lack of pro-TGF-α shedding, that is defective in many unrelated shedding events (14Arribas J. Massagué J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 15Arribas J. Coodly L. Vollmer P. Kishimoto T.K. Rose-John S. Massagué J. J. Biol.

To characterize the shedding of HB-EGF to the same extent as that of pro-TGF-α or βAPP, we analyzed the shedding of HB-EGF in M2 and tace −/− cells. As expected, treatment of wild type cells with PMA activates the shedding of HB-EGF as judged by the decrease in the amount of cell surface-associated pro-HB-EGF and a concomitant release of soluble mature HB-EGF (Fig. 3 A, and see also Fig. 2 B). The lack of effect of PMA on M2 cell mutants or tace −/− cells strongly suggests that TACE and the gene defective in M2 cells are necessary for the shedding of pro-HB-EGF, at least in these cell lines (Fig. 3, A and B), and, since it has been previously found that MDC9 can shed pro-HB-EGF from Vero cells (21Izumi Y. Hirata M. Hasuwa H. Iwamoto R. Umata T. Miyado K. Tamai Y. Kurisaki T. Sehara-Fujisawa A. Ohno S. Mekada E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7260-7272Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), opens the possibility that pro-HB-EGF is a substrate of different metalloprotease-disintegrins in different cell lines. The results presented elsewhere and in this report indicate that the shedding of βAPP, pro-TGF-α, and pro-HB-EGF relies on the presence of active TACE. An obvious explanation of the results presented this far is that APMA is an activator of TACE. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the shedding of endogenous βAPP, transfected pro-HB-EGF, or transfected pro-TGF-α in the shedding-defective mutant cell line M2 and intace −/− cells. As previously described (8Peschon J. Slack J. Reddy P. Stocking K. Sunnarborg S. Lee D. Rusell W. Castner R. Johnson R. Fitzner J. Boyce N. Nelson C. Kozlosky M. Wolfson M. Rauch C. Cerretti D.

Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), the PMA-inducible shedding of βAPP is defective in M2 and tace −/− cells (see also Fig.4). APMA did not induce the shedding of βAPP in M2 cells and produced a modest effect on tace −/− cells (Fig. 4), strongly suggesting that the effect of APMA in wild type cells is mediated by TA"

Biosynthesis of the fatty acyl chains of mycolic acids involves two fatty acid synthetic systems, the multifunctional polypeptide fatty acid synthase I (FASI), which performs de novo fatty acid synthesis, and the dissociated FASII system, which consists of monofunctional enzymes, and acyl carrier protein (ACP) and elongates FASI products to long chain mycolic acid precursors. In this study, we present the initial characterization of purified KasA and KasB, two β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase (KAS) enzymes of the M. tuberculosis FASII system. KasA and KasB were expressed in E. coli and purified by affinity chromatography. Both enzymes showed activity typical of bacterial KASs, condensing an acyl-ACP with malonyl-ACP. Consistent with the proposed role of FASII in mycolic acid synthesis, analysis of various acyl-ACP substrates indicated KasA and KasB had higher specificity for long chain acyl-ACPs containing at least 16 carbons. Activity of KasA and KasB increased with use of M. tuberculosis AcpM, suggesting that structural differences between AcpM and E. coli ACP may affect their recognition by the enzymes.

The unique core structure of the cell wall consists of a covalently linked complex of peptidoglycan, arabinogalactan, and mycolic acids (5Brennan P.J. Nikaido H. Annu. Rev.

In addition to their characteristically long acyl chains, M. tuberculosis mycolic acids also contain a variety of functionalities, including desaturations and cyclopropyl rings, α-methyl-branched methyl ethers, and α-methyl-branched ketones which define the α-, methoxy-, and ketomycolates, respectively (8Barry III, C.E.

The low permeability of the cell can be directly attributed to the nature of functional groups in mycolic acids and their effect on the fluidity of the cell wall (2Liu J. Barry III, C.E. Besra G.S.

Variations in functional group structure can also have effects on the ability of M. tuberculosis to grow in macrophages (11Yuan Y. Zhu Y. Crane D.D. Barry III, C.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1449-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In addition to the influence of mycolic acids on cell wall structure and function, cell wall components such as trehalose dimycolate (cord factor) have been shown to exhibit immunomodulatory activities that can enhance the pathogenicity of M. tuberculosis (12Bloch H. J. Exp. Med. 1950; 91: 197-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The importance of mycolic acids to bacterial survival and pathogenesis has generated much interest in the enzymes responsible for their biosynthesis, based on the hypothesis that inhibitors of these proteins will be potential antimycobacterial agents. Indeed, the cessation of mycolic acid synthesis is one of the primary effects of isoniazid (INH),1 a front-line anti-tuberculosis drug (13Takayama K. Wang L. David H.L. Antimicrob.

Biosynthesis of mycolic acid precursors requires the interaction of two fatty acid synthase (FAS) systems, the multifunctional polypeptide, FASI, and the dissociated FASII system, the latter composed of monofunctional enzymes and a discrete acyl carrier protein (ACP) 2The abbreviation ACP is typically used to describe acyl carrier protein. When the source of ACP is relevant,i.e. from either Escherichia coli or M. tuberculosis, the abbreviations ACPEc and AcpM are used, respectively, to differentiate the two. (8Barry III, C.E. Lee R.E.

Although the specific details of mycolic acid synthesis are not completely understood, the mycobacterial FASI system appears to be responsible for the de novosynthesis of C16–26 fatty acyl primers (18Bloch K. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 35: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), which are then passed to the FASII system and elongated to produce intermediates of the long meromycolate chain (19Qureshi N.

In turn, this has facilitated the characterization of several components of the M. tuberculosis FASII system, including FabH (21Choi K-H. Kremer L. Besra G.S. Rock C.O. J. Biol.

Of particular interest in the FASII system are the roles played by three condensing enzymes, FabH, KasA, and KasB. Recent reports describe the isolation of the FASII initiation enzyme FabH (21Choi K-H. Kremer L. Besra G.S. Rock C.O. J. Biol.

TLM also inhibits KasA and KasB, both putatively involved in fatty acid elongation, based on overexpression of the kasA andkasB genes in Mycobacterium bovis BCG, which resulted in increased resistance to TLM in vitro andin vivo (25Kremer L. Douglas J.D. Baulard A.R. Morehouse C. Guy M.R. Alland D. Dover L.G. Lakey J.H. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Brennan P.J. Minnikin D.E. Besra G.S. J. Biol.

Distinct roles for KasA and KasB in mycolic acid synthesis were postulated based upon increases in the incorporation of radioactivity into fatty acids in various FAS assays after overexpression of either kasA or kasB (25Kremer L.

The antimycobacterial activity of TLM suggests the essentiality of at least one of the three condensing enzymes, as is the case for orthologs in other bacterial species such as E. coli FabB (26Garwin J.L.

Kallender, manuscript in preparation. thus making them attractive targets for the development of screens to identify new lead compounds. Therefore, we purified and characterized KasA and KasB, and despite many similarities, these enzymes display differing enzymatic properties and may indeed play distinct roles in mycolic acid biosynthesis. Chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise noted. All cloning steps were performed in E. coli DH5α cells purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. E. coli BL21(DE3) cells and expression vector pET28a(+) were purchased from Novagen. M. tuberculosis H37Rv genomic DNA was obtained from Dr. John Belisle at Colorado State University. Q-Sepharose and HiTrap chelating columns were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Materials for polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were purchased from Novex. An AKTAprime liquid chromatography system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was utilized for protein purification. Mass spectra were obtained using a SELDI protein biology system purchased from Ciphergen Biosystems, Inc. Enzyme assays were performed on a SpectraMax Plus 384 plate reader (Molecular Devices). Representative sequences among selected classes of related fatty acid biosynthetic enzymes were aligned with the MACAW manual sequence alignment program (28Schuler G.D. Altschul S.F. Lipman D.J. Proteins. 1991; 9: 180-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). The alignments of conserved sequence blocks were evaluated with the segment pair overlap and Gibbs sampler options in MACAW based on the BLOSUM62 similarity matrix. Preliminary sequence data forEnterococcus faecalis sequences was obtained from The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) web site at www.tigr.org. The aligned sequences included: actinomycete KAS proteins (M. tuberculosis KasA, GI:1706746; Mycobacterium lepraeKasA, GI:3150229; M. tuberculosis KasB, GI:1706747; M. leprae KasB, GI:3150228; Streptomyces coelicolor Kas1, GI:125235), FabF proteins (E. coli, GI:729460;Moraxella catarrhalis (GlaxoSmithKline); Pseudomonas aeruginosa FabF1, GI:7433751; P. aeruginosa FabF2, GI:11347289; Bacillus subtilis, GI:7433750; E. faecalis FabF1 (TIGR), E. faecalis FabF2 (TIGR),Staphylococcus aureus, GI:13700788; S. pneumoniae, GI:9789234; Homo sapiens, GI:8923559;Drosophila melanogaster, GI:7296703; Caenorhabditis elegans, GI:7498864), FabB proteins (E. coli, GI:119783; Hemophilus influenzae, GI:1169589; M. catarrhalis (GlaxoSmithKline), P. aeruginosa, GI:11347502), and multi-domain fatty acid synthase proteins from actinomycetes (M. tuberculosis, GI:7447225; M. leprae, GI:4539127; Corynebacterium ammoniagenes, GI:580746), fungi (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, GI:119832;Candida albicans, GI:1169645, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, GI:3023732; Emericella nidulans, GI:2492657), and animals (H. sapiens, GI:1345959; Gallus gallus, GI:1345958; D. melanogaster, GI:7295848;C. elegans, GI:3876624). Positions with gaps or ambiguous alignment were compared with E. coli FabF and FabB crystal structures (1B3N (29Moche M. Schneider G. Edwards P. Dehesh K. Lindqvist Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6031-6034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), 1FJ8 (30Price A.C. Choi K.H. Heath R.J. Li Z. White S.W. Rock C.O. J. Biol.

In each case, such positions were found to be in predicted loop regions that suggested structural inequivalence among the aligned sequences in these regions. Thus, these regions, including the non-homologous domains of the multi-domain fatty acid synthase proteins, were removed from the alignment before phylogenetic analyses. In the final edited alignment, 395 of the 414 amino acids of M. tuberculosis KasA were maintained. Phylogenetic analyses were based on the total number of sites in edited multiple-sequence alignments. Trees were constructed by neighbor-joining and maximum-parsimony methods. Neighbor-joining trees were built from pairwise distances between amino acid sequences based on the Dayhoff PAM120 substitution matrix (31Dayhoff M.O. Schwartz M. Orcutt B.C. Dayhoff M.O. Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure. 5th Ed. National Biomedical Research Foundation, Washington, D. C.1978: 345-352Google Scholar) using the programs NEIGHBOR and PROTDIST of the PHYLIP 3.572c package (at genetics.washington.edu/phylip.html (32Felsenstein J. PHYLIP (Phylogeny Inference Package) Version 3.57c. Department of Genetics, University of Washington, Seattle1993Google Scholar)). The programs SEQBOOT and CONSENSE were used to estimate the confidence limits of branch points from 1000 bootstrap replicates. Maximum parsimony construction was accomplished with the software package PAUP*, version 4.0 (33Swofford D.L. PAUP*: Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony, Version 4.0. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, Mass1999Google Scholar). The number and length of minimal trees were estimated with 100 replicate random heuristic searches. Confidence limits for branch points were estimated from 1000 bootstrap replicates. To generate clones for expressing N-terminal hexahistidine-tagged KasA and KasB, the M. tuberculosis kasA and kasB genes (Rv2245 and Rv2246, respectively, GenBankTM accession number Z70692) were PCR-amplified from M. tuberculosis genomic DNA using standard PCR strategies (34Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., and Struhl, K.

PCR programs consisted of an initial 5-min denaturation step (94 °C) followed by 25 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min and then a final elongation step at 72 °C for 7 min. PCR products were digested withNheI/HindIII (kasA) orNdeI/SacI (kasB) and ligated with vector using T4 DNA ligase (Life Technologies, Inc.) to produce pETkasA and pETkasB. Positive clones were identified by PCR screening using the above primers, and the plasmid insert was sequenced to assure authenticity of the construct. The pETkasA and pETkasB plasmids were electroporated into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells, and single colony transformants were grown at 37 °C to mid-log phase (A 600 = 0.7) in LB broth containing kanamycin (50 μg/ml) and glucose (1%). For KasA, the cells were induced with 0.3 mm IPTG at 37 °C for 2.5 h. KasB cultures were equilibrated to 18 °C and induced with 0.3 mm IPTG for ∼24 h at 18 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in Buffer A (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol (5 ml/g)), and lysed by the addition of 2 mg of lysozyme followed by 3 cycles of freezing and thawing. The KasA lysate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min, the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was dissolved in 20 ml of Buffer A containing 8 m urea (Buffer A′). The urea solution was centrifuged at 27,000 × g, and the supernatant containing denatured KasA was loaded onto a 5-ml nickel-chelating column. The column was washed with 5 column volumes of Buffer A′ and eluted using a 100-ml linear gradient of 10–500 mm imidazole in Buffer A′. Fractions containing KasA were identified by SDS-PAGE, pooled, and diluted to an approximate concentration of 0.2 mg/ml in Buffer A′. KasA was refolded during stepwise dialyses (6–8-h/step) against 2 liters of 50 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 2 mm DTT containing 4, 2, and 1 m urea and then dialyzed against 4 liters of 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.5 mNaCl, 2 mm DTT. Finally, the sample was dialyzed overnight against 2 liters of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, 0.3m NaCl, 2 mm DTT, and 50% glycerol and filtered through 0.45 μm filter. Aliquots of KasA were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. The KasB lysate was centrifuged at 27,000 × g, and the pellet was discarded. The soluble lysate was loaded onto a 5-ml nickel-chelating column, washed with 5 column volumes of Buffer A, and eluted with a 100-ml linear gradient of 10–500 mmimidazole in Buffer A. Fractions containing KasB were identified by SDS-PAGE, pooled, and dialyzed against 4 liters of 50 mmsodium phosphate, 0.3 m NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 5% glycerol, after which KasB was divided into 100-μl aliquots, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Lauroyl (C12:0)-, palmitoyl (C16:0)-, and arachidoyl (C20:0)-ACPEc and C16:0-AcpM substrates were generated using holo-ACPEc (or holo-AcpM), lauric, palmitic, or arachidic acid and the E. coli Aas enzyme as previously described (24Schaeffer M.L.

Newly synthesized substrates were purified by anion exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose columns and characterized by SELDI-MS, and the acyl-ACPs were quantitated by amino acid analysis and enzymatically with KasA. Butyryl (C4:0)- and malonyl-ACPEc were provided by Martin Brandt (GlaxoSmithKline). Malonyl-AcpM was synthesized using apo-AcpM, malonyl-CoA, and E. coli AcpS and purified by anion exchange chromatography. A continuous assay format was used to monitor KasA and KasB activity by coupling the condensing activity of the KAS enzymes to a β-ketoacyl-ACP reductase, either M. tuberculosis MabA or S. pneumoniae FabG (obtained from Joshua West, GlaxoSmithKline). Both MabA and FabG reduce β-ketoacyl-ACP intermediates to the corresponding β-hydroxyacyl-ACPs, enabling the reaction course to be monitored spectrophotometrically by following the oxidation of NADPH to NADP+ at 340 nm. MabA was purified by expressing themabA gene as an N-terminal hexahistidine-tagged protein inE. coli followed by affinity chromatography of the soluble fraction of the whole-cell lysate. 4M. L. Schaeffer, unpublished results. Although various concentrations of enzyme and ACP substrates were utilized in the experiments described, the details of which are included in the figure legends and text, typical KasA assays (100-μl total volume) contained 96–240 nm KasA, 3 μmMabA or FabG, 26–54 μm malonyl-ACPEc (AcpM), 6–10 μm acyl-ACPEc (AcpM), 50 μm NADPH, and 0.01% CHAPS in 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 6.8. KasB reactions (100 μl total volume) contained 460–920 nm KasB, 3 μm MabA or FabG, 26–54 μm malonyl-ACPEc, 6–10 μmacyl-ACPEc, 50 μm NADPH, and 0.01% CHAPS in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. For KasB assays using AcpM, typical conditions were as described above with 140–185 nm KasB, 6–10 μm acyl-AcpM, and 18–26 μm malonyl-AcpM. Reactions were preincubated for 5 min at 37 °C before initiation and allowed to proceed for 20 min at 37 °C unless specified in half-area 96-well microtiter plates (Costar). Initial rates were determined by measuring the decrease inA 340 at either 10- or 30-s intervals throughout the course of the reaction and expressed as pmol/min. The presence of a bacterial FASII system in M. tuberculosis is well established, and sequencing of the M. tuberculosisgenome confirmed the presence of numerous genes postulated to comprise a single FASII system (8Barry III, C.E.

In the present context, phylogenetic analysis was applied to examine the relationship of KasA and KasB to selected classes of FAS enzymes (Fig. 2). M. tuberculosis andM. leprae KasA sequences share 93% identity and 99% similarity, and their KasB sequences share 92% identity and 98% similarity (Table I). M. tuberculosis KasA and KasB sequences are also closely related to one another, sharing 67% identity and 86% similarity (Table I). Neighbor-joining and maximum parsimony methods (Fig. 2) showed strong statistical support in terms of bootstrap values and minimal-length trees for placing these enzymes together in a clade distinct from the other classes of fatty acid biosynthetic enzymes. Additionally, these phylogenetic and sequence homology analyses indicate that KasA and KasB are more closely related to FabF and FabB than to any of the multi-subunit fatty acid synthases.Table I% similarities and % identities of selected homologs to M. tuberculosis KasA and KasB proteinsProtein% identity to KasA% identity to KasB% similarity to KasA% similarity to KasBKas proteins M. tuberculosis KasA1006710086 M. tuberculosis KasB6710086100 M. leprae KasA93679986 M. leprae KasB67928698FabF proteins E. coli41366665 M. catarrhalis37366667 P. aeruginosa 138366665 P. aeruginosa 242406967 B. subtilis39366968 E. faecalis 137366664 E. faecalis 236376661 S. aureus38386868 S. pneumoniae36346463 H. sapiens35356263FabB proteins E. coli33345759 H. influenzae35356163 M. catarrhalis34355961 P. aeruginosa31325860FASI proteins M. tuberculosis23245147 M. leprae24235148 S. cerevisiae20214646 H. sapiens22245050Pairwise similarities and identities were determined based on the length of the shorter sequence without gaps from the edited alignment.

We combined a behavioral test for magnetic compass orientation in mole rats and immunocytochemical visualization of the transcription factor c-Fos as a marker of neuronal activity. We found that the superior colliculus of the Zambian mole rat ( Cryptomys anselli ) contains neurons that are responsive to magnetic stimuli. These neurons are directionally selective and organized within a discrete sublayer. Our results constitute evidence for the involvement of a specific mammalian brain structure in magnetoreception.
https://openalex.org/W2085856353,An ossified Meckel's cartilage has been recovered from two early Cretaceous mammals from China. This element is similar to Meckel's cartilage in prenatal and some postnatal extant mammals and indicates the relationship of Meckel's cartilage with the middle ear in early mammals. The evidence shows that brain expansion may not be the initial factor that caused the separation of postdentary bones from the dentary as middle ear ossicles during mammalian evolution. The failure of the dentary to seize reduced postdentary elements during ontogeny of early mammals is postulated as an alternative mechanism for the separation. Modifications of both feeding and hearing apparatuses in early mammals may have led to the development of the definitive mammalian middle ear.
https://openalex.org/W2024776519,"Poly-alpha2,8-sialic acid (PSA) has been implicated in numerous normal and pathological processes, including development, neuronal plasticity, and tumor metastasis. We report that cell surface PSA expression can be reversibly inhibited by a small molecule, N-butanoylmannosamine (ManBut). Inhibition occurs through a metabolic mechanism in which ManBut is converted to unnatural sialic acid derivatives that effectively act as chain terminators during cellular PSA biosynthesis. N-Propanoylmannosamine (ManProp), which differs from ManBut by a single methylene group, did not inhibit PSA biosynthesis. Modulation of PSA expression by chemical means has a role complementary to genetic and biochemical approaches in the study of complex PSA-mediated events."
https://openalex.org/W1974145039,"Cell adaptation to hypoxia is partially accomplished by hypoxia-inducible transcription factor-1 (HIF-1). Here we report the hypoxia-independent up-regulation of HIF-1α subunit in antigen receptor-activated T cells. This is explained by a selective up-regulation of alternatively spliced mRNA isoform I.1 that encodes the HIF-1α protein without the first 12 N-terminal amino acids. We show that both short (I.1) and long (I.2) HIF-1α isoforms display similar DNA binding and transcriptional activities. Major differences were observed between these two HIF-1α isoforms in their expression patterns with respect to the resting and activated T lymphocytes in hypoxic and normoxic conditions. The T cell antigen receptor (TCR)-triggered activation of normal ex vivo T cells and differentiated T cells results in up-regulation of expression of I.1 isoform of HIF-1α mRNA without an effect on constitutive I.2 HIF-1α mRNA expression. The accumulation of I.1 HIF-1α mRNA isoform in T lymphocytes is also demonstrated during cytokine-mediated inflammation in vivo, suggesting a physiological role of short HIF-1α isoform in activated lymphocytes. The TCR-triggered, protein kinase C and Ca2+/calcineurin-mediated HIF-1α I.1 mRNA induction is protein synthesis-independent, suggesting that the HIF-1α I.1 gene is expressed as an immediate early response gene.

Cell adaptation to hypoxia is partially accomplished by the transcriptional activity of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1).1 HIF-1 is a basic helix-loop-helix/Per-ARNT-Sim protein consisting of HIF-1α and HIF-1β subunits (11Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1230-1237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1723) Google Scholar, 12Wang G.L. Jiang B.H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The HIF-1β subunit is also known as aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) and serves as a heterodimerization partner for other transcription factors (13Rowlands J.C. Gustafsson J.A.

HIF-1 activates the transcription of genes required for glucose metabolism, erythropoiesis, vascularization, and cell proliferation by binding to cis-acting hypoxia response element (HRE) (18Semenza G.L.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 149-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (2046) Google Scholar). The HIF-1α subunit may also affect cell metabolism and signaling by its ability to directly interact with other proteins such as p53 (23An W.G. Kanekal M. Simon M.C. Maltepe E. Blagosklonny M.V. Neckers L.M. Nature. 1998; 392: 405-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Multiple roles of HIF-1α as transcriptional factor and in protein-protein interactions complicate the understanding of its role in vivo. Possible clues are expected to be provided by studies of regulation of HIF-1α mRNA and protein expression. Oxygen-sensing mechanisms and the subsequent regulation of HIF-1 expression are the subject of intensive investigations. It was shown that HIF-1α, but not HIF-1β, expression is significantly enhanced by hypoxia (12Wang G.L. Jiang B.H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5040) Google Scholar, 24Huang L.E. Arany Z. Livingston D.M. Bunn H.F. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1996; 271: C1172-C1180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is believed that the regulation of HIF-1α expression occurs mostly on post-translational level (19Wenger R.H. Gassmann M. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 609-616PubMed Google Scholar). HIF-1α mRNA is constitutively expressed in tissue culture cells independent of oxygen tensions (26Wenger R.H. Kvietikova I. Rolfs A. Gassmann M. Marti H.H. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 560-563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar,27Wenger R.H. Rolfs A. Marti H.H. Guenet J.-L. Gassmann M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

At high oxygen tensions, HIF-1α is targeted for destruction by an E3 ubiquitin ligase containing the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL) (31Cockman M.E. Masson N. Mole D.R. Jaakola P.

According to a current model, pVHL binds to the oxygen-dependent degradation domain located in the central region of HIF-1α (33Srinivas V. Zhang L.P. Zhu X.H. Caro J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) that results in a subsequent degradation of HIF-1α through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (34Salceda S. Caro J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22642-22647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1406) Google Scholar, 35Huang L.E. Gu J. Schau M. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7987-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (1847) Google Scholar). We were prompted to revisit this model by recent demonstrations of oxygen tension-independent induction of HIF-1α by hormones (36Richard D.E. Berra E. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26765-26771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and proinflammatory cytokines (37Thornton R.D. Lane P. Borghaei R.C. Pease E.A. Caro J. Mochan E. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) as well as by our own studies of HIF-1α expression in activated T lymphocytes. 2C. Caldwell and M. Sitkovsky, manuscript in preparation. 2C. Caldwell and M. Sitkovsky, manuscript in preparation. It was also important to investigate the possibility of differential expression of two mouse HIF-1α mRNA isoforms, which contain two alternative first exons named I.1 and I.2 (38Wenger R.H. Rolfs A. Kvietikova P. Spielmann P. Zimmermann D.R. Gassmann M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 39Wenger R.H. Rolfs A. Spielmann P. Zimmermann D.R. Gassmann M. Blood. 1998; 91: 3471-3480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The I.1 mRNA encodes a protein, which is expected to be 12 N-terminal amino acid residues shorter than HIF-1α I.2 mRNA-encoded protein, although no difference in functions of these HIF-1α isoforms has yet been reported (40Gorlach A. Camenisch G. Kvietikova I. Vogt L. Wenger R.H. Gassmann M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1493: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). No corresponding human isoform has been found so far. The ratios of these two mRNA isoforms in cells and patterns of expression of HIF-1α I.1 mRNA in resting versusactivated versus differentiated cells are not known. HIF-1α I.2 mRNA is constitutively expressed like a housekeeping gene in all tissues in an oxygen tension-independent manner, while I.1 mRNA has a tissue-specific expression (39Wenger R.H. Rolfs A. Spielmann P. Zimmermann D.R. Gassmann M. Blood. 1998; 91: 3471-3480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, studies of expression of these two HIF-1α mRNA isoforms may allow to us to distinguish possible separate roles of HIF-1α as a transcription factor and in protein-protein interactions provided that the expression of short and long forms of HIF-1α is differentially regulated. Accordingly, in this study we asked whether HIF-1α mRNA is indeed constitutively expressed in ex vivo naive T cells, ex vivo activated T cells, differentiated T cells, and resting versus activated T cells by taking advantage of the possibilities provided by quantitative competitive RT-PCR. We report here that TCR-triggered activation of T lymphocytes results in up-regulation of the I.1 isoform of HIF-1α mRNA without an effect on I.2 mRNA expression. The expression of I.1 HIF-1α mRNA follows a pattern of immediate early response genes. These observations suggest differential regulation and functions of these two isoforms of HIF-1α proteins in resting and activated cells. Mouse 2B4 T helper hybridoma cells and mouse splenocytes were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Biofluids, Rockville, MD) supplemented with 5% dialyzed fetal calf serum (heat-inactivated) and 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 1 mmsodium pyruvate, 1 mm HEPES, nonessential amino acids (RP5), and 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol (complete RPMI). NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were cultured in AMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Single cell splenocyte suspensions were prepared from adult mouse spleens. T cells were isolated using a mixture of anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 microbeads to positively select cells on an AutoMACS (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA) using the manufacturer's protocol. Isolated cells were incubated in complete RPMI 1640. Unless otherwise indicated, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol was added into cell cultures conducted at 20% oxygen but not in the medium for cultures conducted at 1.0% oxygen tensions. Cells to be cultured at 1.0% oxygen were centrifuged and added to culture medium pre-equilibrated for at least 30 min with a certified gas mixture containing 1.0% oxygen, 5.0% CO2, and 94.0% N2 (Roberts Oxygen Company, Rockville, MD). Cells were incubated in a NAPCO (Winchester, VA) 7000 three-gas incubator at 1 or 20% oxygen tension as indicated in the figure legends. Th1 and Th2 cells were obtained after cytokine-driven differentiation of naive CD4+ T cells in vitro according to Ref. 41Hu-Li J. Huang H. Ryan J. Paul W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3189-3194Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, and they were kindly provided by Dr. J. Hu-Li (NIAID, National Institutes of Health). The TCR-activated 2B4 cells were incubated (2 × 106 cells/ml) in 96-well plates (Costar, Corning, NY) precoated with 10 μg/ml anti-TCR (clone H57-597; Pharmingen, La Jolla, CA). Studies of the biochemical pathways involved in HIF-1α mRNA regulation were performed after incubation of cells with 15 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (Calbiochem) and/or 300 nm ionomycin (Calbiochem). Inhibitors were added as indicated: cycloheximide (Sigma) (50 μg/ml), actinomycin D (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA) (5 μg/ml), cyclosporin A (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA) (1 μg/ml), and K252b (20 nm). Mouse T cells were activated by plate-bound (3 μg/ml) anti-CD3 mAb (clone 145-2C110; Pharmingen, La Jolla, CA) and 3 μg/ml anti-CD28 mAb (clone 37.51; Pharmingen) for 36 h as described earlier (42Apasov S. Sitkovsky M. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Female C57BL/6 mice were injected intravenously with 20 mg/kg concanavalin A (type IV; Sigma) dissolved in sterile phosphate-buffered saline. After 6 h, tissue samples were taken, and spleen T cells were isolated using AutoMACS as described above. Total RNA was isolated using the RNA STAT-60 kit (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Measurements of cytokine levels (tumor necrosis factor-α and interferon-γ in the sera were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits obtained from R&D systems (Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 2× sample buffer (Novex) with 4% 2-mercaptoethanol followed by 30-s ultrasonic treatment. Samples were boiled for 5 min and loaded to 7% SDS-PAGE. An immunoblot assay was performed as described (12Wang G.L. Jiang B.H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5040) Google Scholar) except that 1:200 diluted antibodies (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) were used. Total RNA was extracted from 105 to 107 cells using RNA STAT-60 kit (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Northern blotting was performed following the general procedure (formaldehyde gel) (43Sambrook J. Fritch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) using 1 μg of messenger RNA purified with the Oligotex mRNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) per lane. HIF-1α probe was synthesized using a 380-bp HIF-1α cDNA fragment. The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe was purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). The EcoRI-PstI fragment of human HIF-1α cDNA (GenBankTM number U22431), which has high homology with mouse HIF-1α (GenBankTM number AF003695) was subcloned into pGEM-3Zf(+) (Promega, Madison, WI) to be used for mimic construction. For deletion of the internal region from wild type cDNA, PCR was performed using M13 reverse primer andSpeI containing primer GAAACTACTAGTCGGACAGCCTCACCAAAC. PCR product was digested with PstI and SpeI and was inserted instead of the SpeI-PstI fragment in the HIF-1α cDNA EcoRI-PstI fragment. The resulting HIF-1α mimic cDNA was 33 bp shorter then wild type HIF-1α cDNA (Fig. 1B). I.1 (GenBankTMnumber Y09086) and I.2 (GenBankTM number Y13656) mimic cDNA were constructed by PCR using TTTCTGGGCAAACTGTTA and CTCTGGACTTGTCTC, respectively, and TAACCCCATGTATTTGTTC. PCR was performed on total cDNA from activated 2B4 cells. PCR products were digested with XbaI, resulting in the deletion of 167 bp (see Fig. 3B) and cloned into blunted XbaI site in pGEM-3Zf(+) (Promega, Madison, WI). The above primers were also used in competitive RT-PCR for determination of either I.1 or I.2 mRNA concentrations in cellular extracts. VEGF mimic cDNA was made by PCR on total mouse cDNA using primers TTTTTTGAATTCTTGAGTTAAACGAACGTACTTGC and TTTTTTGGATCCACGAGCTCTACAGGAATACCAG. A 369-bp PCR product was digested with EcoRI, BamHI, and HinfI and cloned into in pGEM-3Zf(+) (Promega, Madison, WI) byEcoRI-BamHI sites. Mimic cDNA for iNOS was created from total mouse cDNA by PCR using primers AATAATGAATTCAACTGCAAGAGAACGGAGAAC and AATAATGGATCCGAGCTCCTCCAGAGGGTAGG. 455-bp PCR product was digested with EcoRI,BamHI, and HinfI and cloned into in pGEM-3Zf(+) (Promega, Madison, WI) by EcoRI-BamHI sites.Figure 3Differential up-regulation of HIF-1α I.1 mRNA upon T cell activation.A, RT-PCR for I.1 and I.2 isoforms of HIF-1α mRNA from mouse T cells and 2B4 hybridoma cells.

Samples were normalized for β-actin mRNA expression.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) RNA corresponding mimic cDNA was synthesized with T7 RNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) according to the manufacturer's manual. Transcription product was analyzed in 8% PAGE, and an 850-base nondegraded RNA band was observed. Optical dichroism of RNA product was measured at 260 nm, and 1 μg of mimic RNA was subjected to reverse transcription in the same conditions as for endogenous RNA. Total RNA was prepared using the RNA STAT-60 kit followed by treatment with DNase I (Life Technologies). The first strand cDNA was synthesized on 1 μg of total RNA using the SuperSCRIPT preamplification system (Life Technologies) with random hexaprimers according to the manufacturer's instructions. After RNase H treatment, the reaction mixture was diluted to a final volume of 100 μl. The competitive PCR was performed using PLATINUM Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies) under standard conditions for 30 cycles in a 30-μl reaction volume that included 1 μl of the diluted cDNA and 1 μl of mimic DNA at the concentrations indicated in the figure legends. PCR using HIF-1α-specific primers ACTGCCACCACTGATGAATCAAAAACAG and TTCCATTTTTCGCTTCCTCTGAGCATTC gave a 283-bp product from mimic cDNA and a 316-bp product from wild type HIF-1α cDNA. Twenty microliters of PCR product was fractionated in a 2% agarose gel and examined by ethidium bromide staining. The density of each band was determined with Stratagene Eagle Eye II (Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX). The densities of RT-PCR products were normalized for differences in cDNA quantity between samples using PCR quantitation of β-actin mRNA using a β-actin competitive PCR set (Takara Shuzo Co., Kyoto, Japan). The use of β-actin mRNA as an internal standard in studies of activated murine T lymphocytes was justified in previous experiments reported by Koshiba et al. (44Koshiba M. Apasov S. Sverdlov V. Chen P. Erb L. Turner J.T. Weisman G.A. Sitkovsky M.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 831-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Quantitative determination of mRNA was done by estimating the equivalent point (where the mimic/target PCR product ratio equals 1.0) in a competitive RT-PCR experiment with serial dilutions of mimic. To estimate the equivalent point, 10-fold serial dilutions of mimic DNA were used in preliminary PCR experiments followed by more precise estimations using 2-fold dilutions of mimic DNA. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed as in Gorlach et al. (40Gorlach A. Camenisch G. Kvietikova I. Vogt L. Wenger R.H. Gassmann M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1493: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Briefly, plasmids pmHIF-I.1, pmHIF-I.2 (kind gift of Dr. R. Wenger, Medical University in Lubeck, Germany), and pBM5/NEO/M1–1 (kind gift of Dr. O. Hankinson (UCLA) were used for transcription in vitro of HIF-I.1, HIF-I.2, and human ARNT mRNAs, respectively, by T7 RNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), which were subsequently used for translation in vitro using rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI) with or without [35S]Met (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). After that, 5 μl of unlabeled in vitro synthesized ARNT and either one of the HIF-1α isoforms were incubated for 30 min at room temperature before the addition of 104 cpm of32P-labeled ([γ-32P]ATP for 5′ labeling of oligonucleotide was purchased from Amersham Biosciences) double-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotide AGCTTGCCCTACGTGCTGTCTCAG, corresponding to HRE from the human erythropoietin gene enhancer, and binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 0.1m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 2.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4) to a final volume of 40 μl. The same but unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide was used as a competitor in 20-fold excess. After 20 min of incubation at 4 °C, the samples were resolved using 5% nondenaturating gel with 0.5× TBE. Expression vector containing the HIF-I.2 isoform was prepared by cloning HIF-I.2 cDNA containing 45-bp 5′-untranslated region in pCEP4 plasmid (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). An expression construct of the I.1 isoform was created by deletion of 36 bp corresponding to amino acid residues 1–12 from I.2 cDNA. Human HIF-1α expressing vector pCEP4/HIF-1α T7 was kindly provided by Dr. G. Semenza (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD), and plasmid pBM5/NEO/M1–1 containing human ARNT was a kind gift from Dr. O. Hankinson. Reporter plasmid HRE-Luc, containing three copies of iNOS promoter-derived HRE, was kindly provided by Dr. M. Blagosklonny (NCI, National Institutes of Health). 5 × 104 NIH 3T3 cells/well were plated in 24-well plates (Costar, Corning, NY) the day before transfection. Cells were transfected in triplicate using LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent (Life Technologies) in the same medium according to the manufacturer's protocol. The following amounts of plasmids were used: 0.1 μg of HRE-Luc, 0.2–0.5 μg of one of the HIF-1α-expressing vectors, 0.2–0.5 μg of pBM5/NEO/M1. The total amount of DNA/well was adjusted to 1 μg with pGEM-3Zf(+) (Promega, Madison, WI). Sixteen hours after transfection, fresh medium was added, and cells were grown for an additional 24 h at either 1 or 20% O2. Luciferase activity was determined using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Our studies of T cell functions under hypoxic conditions revealed HIF-1α protein up-regulation in TCR-triggered activated T lymphocytes under normoxic conditions (20% O2).2 T lymphocytes are not unique to receptor-triggered HIF-1α up-regulation. This phenomenon has been reported in normoxic conditions in different cells after incubations with hormones (36Richard D.E. Berra E. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26765-26771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or proinflammatory cytokines (37Thornton R.D. Lane P. Borghaei R.C. Pease E.A. Caro J. Mochan E. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). We undertook detailed studies of HIF-1α regulation in activated T cells, since HIF-1α has important transcriptional activities and affects important regulatory proteins (45Semenza G.L. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 35: 71-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Up-regulation of HIF-1α protein and HIF-1α mRNA in activated versus nonactivated T cells is demonstrated by Western and Northern blot analysis of extracts from 2B4 T helper hybridoma cells after their incubation with anti-TCR mAb at nonhypoxic conditions at 20% oxygen (Fig.1A). Increased amounts of HIF-1α mRNA in activated T cells was unexpected, since HIF-1α regulation was known to be controlled on a post-translational level (19Wenger R.H. Gassmann M. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 609-616PubMed Google Scholar). Further detailed mRNA expression studies by Northern blot analysis of HIF-1α mRNA in T lymphocytes were limited by the requirement of the large numbers of cells and inadequate quantitative measurement of HIF-1α mRNA increase by Northern blot analysis. This precluded analysis of small numbers of cells in different T cells populations ex vivo and after in vitrodifferentiation and prompted the development of quantitative competitive RT-PCR assay using the mimic corresponding to the 3′ region of HIF-1α mRNA (Fig. 1B). We determined that HIF-1α mRNA expression is greater than 5-fold higher in TCR-stimulated T cells cultured at 1% O2 as compared with nonstimulated cells, with a 15-fold increase in HIF-1α mRNA in cells activated in normoxic conditions, at 20% O2 (Fig. 1C). Direct measurements established that there were lower levels of HIF-1α mRNA in ex vivo CD4+ naive T cells than in Th1 and Th2 T cells obtained after their differentiation in vitro (data not shown). Therefore, TCR-mediated activation, but not hypoxia, leads to HIF-1α mRNA expression up-regulation in T cells. Incubation of T cells with TCR-cross-linking reagents triggers a complex cascade of events such as inositol-triphosphate signaling, increases in intracellular Ca2+, Ca2+/CaM-dependent phosphatase, and calcineurin and protein kinase C activation (46Crabtree G.R. Clipstone N.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 1045-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). To test whether these pathways may be implicated in HIF-1α mRNA up-regulation, we tested the effects of protein kinase C activators and Ca2+ ionophore. It appears that these pathways are responsible, in part, for the observed incr"

In the normal human diploid cell line GM6112, the addition of soluble Fas ligand (sFasL) leads to morphological signs of cell death in less than 1% of cells. Treatment of serum-starved GM6112 fibroblasts with sFasL resulted in a rapid and transient phosphorylation of ERK1/2 without a significant increase in JNK and p38 activities. Unless co-treated with the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin, sFasL did not show gene-inducing activity in cells maintained in complete medium. However, when cells were serum-starved for 4 days, treatment with sFasL alone induced interleukin-6 gene expression and, less strongly, interleukin-8 gene expression. Sensitization of the gene-inducing activity by serum starvation correlated with NF-κB activation by sFasL. Furthermore, we found that the expression of FADD and caspase-8 was significantly reduced in serum-starved cells, whereas the level of cFLIP remained unchanged. Transfection of GM6112 cells with the antisense caspase-8 expression construct sensitized cells toward sFasL-induced NF-κB-dependent reporter activation. Our results support the notion that a change in the ratio of cFLIP and caspase-8 may be responsible for turning on the Fas-activated NF-κB pathway, which otherwise is supplanted by the death-inducing pathway. Many Fas-expressing cells do not undergo cell death upon Fas stimulation.

Stimulation of Fas leads to the recruitment of Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD)1 to its cytoplasmic death domain. FADD then recruits procaspase-8, and subsequent autoproteolytic activation of procaspase-8 within the receptor-signaling complex initiates the apoptosis program of the cell (1Nagata S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1999; 33: 29-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 2Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1035-1038Crossref Scopus (5085) Google Scholar). However, many Fas-expressing cells do not always undergo apoptosis upon Fas stimulation, indicating that susceptibility to Fas-mediated death does not invariably correlate with its expression in any given cell type. There is evidence that in addition to inducing cell death, in at least some cell lines Fas can mediate other activation signals, including increased proliferation in human T cells (3Alderson M.R.

Lynch D.H. Targan S.R. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4147-4154PubMed Google Scholar), and activation of the transcription factor NF-κB (6Porton A.M. Clement V. Stamenkovic I. J. Biol.

Inflamm. 1995; 45: 161-174PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the soluble form of Fas ligand (sFasL) shed from activated T cells can act directly as a chemoattractant for neutrophils (9Seino K. Kayagaki N. Okumura K. Yagita H. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Collectively, these observations indicate that Fas-mediated signaling is not limited to inducing cell death. However, the molecular events triggering Fas-mediated signals distinct from apoptosis induction have not been clearly delineated. FADD is not only an essential signaling mediator for Fas-transduced apoptosis, but it also can be involved in signals that promote proliferation of T cell receptor-activated T cells, as shown by the absence of activation-induced T proliferation in FADD knockout mice (10Zhang J. Cado D. Chen A. Kabra N.H. Winto A. Nature. 1998; 392: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar) or transgenic mice expressing dominant negative FADD (11Newton K. Harris A.W. Bath M.L.

Biol. 1998; 8: 467-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Therefore, Fas-mediated signaling pathways not associated with apoptosis induction can be branched out from FADD. It has been suggested that cFLIP (Casper/CASH/I-FLICE/CLARP) controls Fas-signaling pathways downstream of FADD (13Irmler M. Thome M. Hahne M. Schneider P. Hofmann K. Steiner V. Bodmer J.L.

A. 1997; 94: 10717-10722Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). cFLIP is a caspase-8-like molecule that lacks catalytic activity and has been known to act as a caspase-8 inhibitor by competing for the binding to FADD (18Tschopp J. Irmler M. Thome M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 19Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 388: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Under conditions in which CD3-activated proliferation of T cells is augmented by Fas co-stimulation, cFLIP is shown to be recruited to the Fas receptor complex by interacting with FADD. The FADD-associated cFLIP then interacts with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-associated factor 1 and 2 (TRAF1 and -2), leading to the activation of NF-κB and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) (20Kataoka T. Budd R.C. Holler N. Thome M. Martinon F. Irmler M. Burns K. Hahne M. Kennedy N. Kovacsovics M. Tschopp J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 640-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that the switch from the Fas-induced apoptotic pathway to a non-apoptotic signaling pathway may be determined by the equilibrium between caspase-8 and its repressor cFLIP and their competition for binding to FADD. Changes in the dynamics of the molecules involved in the decision-making step may be affected by additional signals such as T cell receptor stimulation in this specific setting. In fact, the function of Fas in a given cell type is known to be influenced by a cellular factor(s) whose expression or activation is affected by other stimuli. This idea is supported by the fact that many cells resistant to Fas-induced apoptosis become sensitive in the presence of metabolic inhibitors such as cycloheximide (CHX) and actinomycin D. In more physiological conditions, sensitivity to Fas-mediated apoptosis was shown to be influenced by certain combinations of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF, interferon-γ, or interleukin-1 (21Bretz J.D. Arscott P.L. Myc A. Barker Jr., J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25433-25438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In addition, the ability of Fas to activate NF-κB and subsequent gene induction can be observed under conditions in whichde novo protein synthesis is blocked or the apoptotic pathway is inhibited by treatment with caspase inhibitors (22Wajant H. Haas E. Schwenzer R. Muhlenbeck F. Kreuz S. Schubert G. Grell M. Smith C. Scheurich P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24357-24366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In the present study, we used the human diploid fibroblast cell line GM6112 to characterize Fas-mediated signals not associated with apoptosis induction and to define conditions that favor the generation of Fas-mediated non-apoptotic-signaling pathways. We show that upon sFasL treatment, GM6112 cells responded by the activation of ERK1/2 in the absence of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 activation. Serum starvation sensitized fibroblasts to Fas-mediated NF-κB activation, which correlated with the down-regulation of FADD and caspase-8 expression levels without a change in cFLIP expression. Our findings support the notion that a change in the ratio of cFLIP and caspase-8 may be responsible for the divergence of Fas signaling from the apoptotic pathway to a non-apoptotic pathway. Culture media were purchased from Life Technologies Inc. Normal human diploid fibroblasts GM6112 were purchased from Human Genetic Mutant Cell Repository, Camden, NJ 08103. GM6112 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS), 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293 was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS. Recombinant sFasL used in this study was prepared from culture supernatant of CHO-K1-sFasL cells grown in serum-free medium (CHO-S-SFM II; Life Technology). The biological activity of sFasL has been previously described (23Kim S. Kim K.-A. Hwang D.-Y. Lee T.H. Kayagaki N. Yagita H. Lee M.-S. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2931-2936Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 24Lee Z.H. Lee S.E. Kwack K. Yeo W. Lee T.H. Bae S.S. Suh P.-G. Kim H.-H. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 69: 490-496PubMed Google Scholar). In most experiments cells were treated with medium containing 10% (v/v) sFasL preparation, corresponding to a final sFasL concentration of 1–2 μg/ml. Yeast-derived recombinant human TNF-α was kindly supplied by Dr. H. H. Chung, Biotech Research Institute, LG Chem., Korea. Phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA), cycloheximide, and anisomycin were purchased from Sigma. PD098059 was purchased from Calbiochem. Rabbit polyclonal α-PY(ab-1) antibody reactive to phosphotyrosine residues was obtained from Dr. J. Schlessinger at NYU Medical Center. The rabbit anti-phospho-ERK and anti-phospho-p38 MAPK antibodies were purchased from New England Biolabs. The anti-Fas monoclonal antibody CH11 and antibodies to cFLIP and caspase-8 were purchased from Pharmingen. Antibodies to FADD and α-tubulin were from Transduction Laboratories and Sigma, respectively. A cytomegalovirus promoter-driven luciferase reporter plasmid, pCMV-luciferase (25Kim C.H. Song Y.-H. Park K. Oh Y. Lee T.H. J. Inflamm. 1995; 45: 312-322PubMed Google Scholar), was used for indirect assessment of cell viability. It was reported that the green fluorescent protein-fused antisense RNA showed an improved efficiency over conventional antisense RNA, because RNAs that lack an open reading frame are labile (26Pimental-Muinos F.X. Seed B. Immunity. 1999; 11: 783-793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Thus, we constructed mammalian expression plasmids for the expression of antisense FADD and caspase-8 RNAs by inserting the respective antisense cDNAs downstream of the green fluorescent protein-coding sequence. The C-terminal green fluorescent protein fusion plasmid pEGFP-C2 (CLONTECH) was used for this construction, in which the HindIII-XhoI fragment coding for the entire open reading frame of FADD and the BglII-XhoI DNA fragment coding for procaspase-8 were cloned into theXhoI/HindIII- andSalI/BamHI-digested pEGFP-C2 plasmids, respectively. For immunoblot analysis of cellular MAP kinases, cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped, and resuspended in a buffer consisting of 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm pyrophosphate, 10 mmsodium orthovanadate, 3 mm benzamidine, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 mm sodium fluoride. Cell lysates were centrifuged, and the supernatants were electrophoresed through 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). The blots were blocked in Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 supplemented with 5% skim milk for 1 h and incubated with 1:1,000 diluted primary rabbit anti-phospho-ERK or p38 MAPK antibody for 1 h and then with 1:5,000 diluted secondary antibody of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were then treated with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the phosphorylated proteins were detected by autoradiography. For Western blot analysis of other proteins, cells were lysed in a buffer containing 1% SDS and boiled for 15 min to reduce viscosity of the lysates. After centrifugation, clear lysates were processed as described above. GST-c-Jun-(1–79) fusion protein was purified from bacterial lysates using GST-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After stimulation, GM6112 cells were lysed in the lysis buffer described in the previous section. The lysates were mixed with 20 μl of GST-c-Jun bound to GST-Sepharose beads. The mixture was rotated at 4 °C for 1 h and pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 3 min. The pelleted beads were washed two times with the lysis buffer and once with kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mmβ-glycerol phosphate, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, and 0.2 mm dithiothreitol) and then resuspended in 50 μl of kinase buffer containing 50 μm ATP and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After 30 min of incubation at 30 °C, the reaction was terminated by adding 2× Laemmli sample buffer and boiling for 3 min. Samples were resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE gel and subjected to autoradiography. Transfection was carried out by the Ca2PO4-DNA precipitation method using Hepes or BES buffer as described elsewhere (27Hong S.-Y. Yoon W.-H. Park J.-H. Kang S.-G. Ahn J.-H. Lee T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10822-10828Google Scholar). Details of the transfection protocols used in GM6112 and HEK293 cells are described in the legend of Fig. 6. Transfectants were lysed in 0.15 ml of lysis buffer (Promega) and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min to remove cell debris. The resulting clear lysates were assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity, and the values of the luciferase assay were normalized with respect to the values of the β-galactosidase assay for relative comparison of each transfection. GM6112 cells were treated with sFasL at the indicated times. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described by Dignamet al. (28Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar), quantitated by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), and stored at −70 °C. The oligonucleotide probes for the EMSA corresponded to the NF-κB binding sites in the c-IAP2 promoter (sense, 5′-ATGGAAATCCCCGA-3′, and antisense, 5′-TCGGGGATTTCCAT-3′) (27Hong S.-Y. Yoon W.-H. Park J.-H. Kang S.-G. Ahn J.-H. Lee T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10822-10828Google Scholar). Two oligonucleotides complementary to each other were annealed to generate a double-stranded probe. End-labeling was accomplished by treatment with T4 polynucleotide kinase in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Approximately 1 ng of the labeled probe was mixed with 2.4 μg of nuclear protein in a total of 20 μl of the binding buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol) containing 2 μg of poly(dI·dC). After incubation for 20 min, the reaction mixture was separated on a 6% nondenaturating polyacrylamide gel with 0.5× TBE buffer (40 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). The gel was vacuum-dried and subjected to autoradiography. For competition experiments, a 100- or 300-fold molar excess of the unlabeled double-stranded probe was added before the addition of the labeled probe. The serum-free culture supernatant of CHO-K1 cells secreting recombinant sFasL was used as an agent for triggering Fas expressed on a human diploid fibroblast cell line, GM6112. The apoptosis-inducing activity of the sFasL preparation was previously confirmed in T cells (23Kim S. Kim K.-A. Hwang D.-Y. Lee T.H. Kayagaki N. Yagita H. Lee M.-S. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2931-2936Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 24Lee Z.H. Lee S.E. Kwack K. Yeo W. Lee T.H. Bae S.S. Suh P.-G. Kim H.-H. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 69: 490-496PubMed Google Scholar). In experiments testing Fas sensitivity of GM6112 cells, we observed that even after 48 h of treatment with medium containing 10% (v/v) sFasL preparation (a concentration that killed >50% Jurkat T cell after treatment for 16 h), less than 1% of cells showed morphological signs of rounding and shrinking. However, combined treatment with sFasL and CHX (5 μg/ml) led to extensive cell death, indicating that Fas expressed on GM6112 cells was active in delivering a death signal. When the cells were serum-starved by maintaining confluent cultures in low serum-containing medium (0.25% FCS) for 48 h, the number of cells undergoing apoptotic cell death increased significantly after sFasL exposure for 16 h (more than 10% cells showing signs of rounding and shrinking), indicating that serum starvation sensitizes cells to Fas-activated apoptosis (data not shown). We determined whether sFasL treatment of serum-starved GM6112 cells leads to an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins. Lysates from the serum-starved cultures treated with sFasL for various periods were analyzed by immunoblotting with a rabbit polyclonal α-PY(ab-1) antibody specific for phospho-tyrosine residues. As can be seen in Fig. 1 A, the α-PY(ab-1) antibody identified a transient increased phosphorylation of 42- and 44-kDa proteins, whose characteristic molecular sizes correspond to ERK2 and ERK1, respectively. An increase in the phosphorylation of the 42- and 44-kDa proteins peaked after a 15-min incubation of cells with sFasL and decreased to the basal level after a 60-min incubation. The magnitude of the increased phosphorylation detected after sFasL treatment for 15 min was comparable with that seen when the fibroblasts were exposed to TNF (10 ng/ml) for the same time. In addition, concomitantly with the increased phosphorylation of the 42- and 44-kDa proteins after sFasL treatment, a tyrosine-phosphorylated band at the position of ∼200-kDa was also detected (marked by an asterisk in Fig. 1 A). The activation of the high molecular weight protein was sFasL-specific because TNF treatment did not lead to phosphorylation of this protein. ERK1/2 activation after exposure of GM6112 cells to sFasL, anti-Fas antibody CH11, and TNF for 15 min was confirmed by Western analysis using an ERK antibody recognizing phosphorylated tyrosine 204 of p42 and p44 MAPK (Fig. 1 B). When GM6112 cells were preincubated with 50 μm PD098059 for 2 h, an activation inhibitor of ERK1/2, the ERK1/2 phosphorylation by sFasL, CH11, or TNF was completely inhibited, indicating that signals leading to ERK1/2 activation are MEK1- and -2-dependent. Next we assayed for sFasL-induced p38 and JNK activation, since previous studies show a role of these kinases in the regulation of Fas-mediated apoptosis (29Juo P. Kuo C.J. Rreynolds S.E. Konz R.F. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Biemann H.-P. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 24-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 30Toyashima F. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1005-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 31Lenczowski J.M. Dominguez L. Eder A.M. King L.B. Zacharchuk C.M. Ashwell J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 170-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). When the same lysates were examined for p38 MAPK activation by Western analysis with the anti-phospho-p38 MAPK antibody specific for phosphorylated tyrosine 182 of p38 MAPK, no phosphorylated p38 MAPK was detected in sFasL-treated lysates (middle panel in Fig. 1 A). JNK activity in the lysates was determined by phosphorylation of GST-c-Jun-(1–79). Fig. 1 A (bottom panel) shows that stimulation with sFasL did not result in JNK activation, whereas TNF treatment led to a strong activation of JNK. To analyze early signaling events coupled to ERK1/2 activation by sFasL, we examined the contribution of the phorbol ester-sensitive protein kinase C isotypes to the sFasL-mediated ERK1/2 activation. Confluent cultures of GM6112 cells were treated with a high concentration (200 ng/ml) of PMA for 24 h to desensitize PMA-sensitive protein kinase C and followed by stimulation with sFasL, anti-Fas antibody CH11, TNF, or a low dose of PMA for 15 min. As shown in Fig. 2, a brief stimulation of naive GM6112 cells with a low concentration (10 ng/ml) of PMA caused ERK1/2 activation. In cells pretreated with the high dose of PMA, further treatment of PMA did not lead to ERK1/2 activation, indicating desensitization of the protein kinase C pathway. However, protein kinase C desensitization did not influence the ability of sFasL, CH11, and TNF to activate ERK1/2. Therefore, PMA-sensitive protein kinase C isoforms are not involved in the activation of ERK1/2 by sFasL. It is interesting to note that TNF, which is mitogenic for serum-starved GM6112 cells (data not shown), also activated ERK1/2 in a PMA-sensitive protein kinase C-independent manner. These results suggest that sFasL and TNF may use a common pathway leading to ERK activation and that ERK activation by sFasL is not linked to the apoptosis-signaling pathways. Fas-mediated activation of non-apoptotic signaling in GM6112 cells was further explored by examining gene induction by sFasL. At first we examined whether sFasL induces IL-8 gene expression in cells maintained in complete medium containing 10% FCS. Northern blot analysis revealed that sFasL treatment alone did not lead to an increase in the level of IL-8 mRNA in cells maintained in complete medium, whereas TNF or the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin (Anis) (1 μg/ml) alone induced IL-8 gene expression (Fig. 3 A,left panel). Simultaneous treatment with sFasL and Anis for 3 h showed a stronger induction than Anis alone. As the treatment time increased, IL-8 mRNA level diminished because of the cytotoxic effect of the combined treatment with sFasL and Anis on GM6112 cells, as judged by a concomitant reduction in the level of the reference mRNA (pHe7). A synergistic induction by sFasL and Anis was also seen with low concentrations of Anis (10 or 50 ng/ml) that were incapable of IL-8 gene induction by themselves (Fig. 3 A, right panel). When confluent GM6112 cultures were serum-starved in medium containing 0.25% FCS for 4 days, the addition of sFasL alone clearly induced gene activation. As shown in Fig. 3 B, sFasL alone induced both IL-6 and IL-8 gene expression in serum-starved cells at levels similar to those induced by TNF. In the presence of a suboptimal concentration (50 ng/ml) of Anis, levels of IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA expression were further enhanced. These results indicate that serum starvation sensitizes cells toward Fas-mediated gene induction. Other experiments showed that IL-6 and IL-8 gene induction in GM6112 fibroblasts by sFasL alone was observed when cells were maintained in 0.25% FCS-containing medium for at least 3 days. Induction of IL-6 gene expression by various stimuli is primarily dependent on NF-κB activation (32Zhang Y.H. Lin J.X. Vilcek J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3818-3823Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Because our data demonstrated that in serum-starved cells, IL-6 gene can be activated by sFasL alone, we examined whether NF-κB is activated by sFasL under such conditions. We performed EMSA with nuclear extracts of sFasL-treated cells that were either serum-starved or maintained in medium containing 10% FCS. As a probe, we used a NF-κB binding element from the promoter of the cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 2 (c-IAP2) gene (27Hong S.-Y. Yoon W.-H. Park J.-H. Kang S.-G. Ahn J.-H. Lee T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10822-10828Google Scholar), because preliminary experiments consistently demonstrated higher NF-κB binding affinity than with the NF-κB site derived from the promoter of IL-6. As shown in Fig. 4, left panel, 30 min of sFasL treatment of GM6112 cells serum-starved for 4 days resulted in the appearance of a shifted band, which decreased after 1 h and disappeared after a 2-h treatment. However, no band was visible in EMSA with a nuclear extract from sFasL-treated cells that were not serum-starved. Combined treatment with sFasL and CHX (5 μg/ml) led to a stronger induction of NF-κB DNA binding activity in serum-starved cells than in cells maintained in complete medium, showing a correlation with the observed gene induction in Fig. 3. Because sFasL induced IL-6 gene expression when cells were serum-starved for at least 3 days, we examined the kinetics of the sFasL-induced NF-κB DNA binding activity in GM6112 cells maintained in serum-starved condition for various periods. As shown in Fig. 4,right panel, sFasL-induced NF-κB binding activity gradually increased as cells were serum-starved for 1, 2, or 4 days. Competition assays using a 100- or 300-fold excess of unlabeled c-IAP2 NF-κB or IL-6 NF-κB oligonucleotides, respectively, resulted in the disappearance of radioisotope-labeled bands, confirming the binding specificity of the nuclear proteins induced by sFasL. To search for the mechanism that may be responsible for sensitizing NF-κB-dependent gene activation in the serum-starved fibroblasts, we attempted to determine if there were any changes in the expression level of proteins that are part of the Fas signaling such as Fas, FADD, caspase-8, and cFLIP. As shown in Fig. 5, a significant reduction of FADD and caspase-8 expression levels, but no change in the cFLIP level, was seen in cells that were serum-starved by maintaining confluent cultures in 0.25% FCS-containing medium for 4 days. Thus, FADD and caspase-8 expression may be prone to degradation under low metabolic conditions relative to other proteins tested. When the expression level of p21, which is known to be up-regulated by growth arrest (33Wang J. Walsh K. Science. 1996; 273: 359-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar), was examined, no significant increase was found after serum starvation (data not shown). In addition, cells arrested at G1/S transition by hydroxyurea treatment for 1 day did not show a significant change in the expression levels of FADD, caspase-8, and cFLIP. Rather, the level of Fas expression was enhanced. Because IL-6 gene induction by sFasL was not observed in either hydroxyurea-treated cells or cells starved for 2 days in low serum-containing medium (data not shown), a simple cell cycle arrest either at G1 or G0stage may not be sufficient to sensitize cells to Fas-mediated NF-κB activation. To establish whether a causal relationship exists between the reduction of FADD and caspase-8 expression levels in serum-starved fibroblasts and the sensitization to NF-κB activation by sFasL, we down-regulated endogenous FADD or caspase-8 levels by the expression of their antisense RNAs and examined sFasL-induced NF-κB-dependent reporter gene activation. As a reporter plasmid, we used an NF-κB-inducible luciferase construct comprising four copies of the IL-6 NF-κB binding site (pIL-6-kB-luc). As shown in Fig. 6 A, in GM6112 cells transfected with various doses of antisense FADD plasmid, sFasL-induced reporter gene activation could not be observed. However, considerable NF-κB reporter gene activation by sFasL (3.5-fold induction) was detected in cells transfected with a dose of 2.5 μg of antisense caspase-8 plasmid. As the amount of transfected DNA increased, the luciferase activities decreased, suggesting that a high level expression of antisense caspase-8 RNA was inhibitory to the sFasL-induced NF-κB activation.

Inactivation of this highly conserved repair pathway leads to greatly elevated mutation rates and is the underlying defect in hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer and familial colorectal cancer (reviewed in Refs. 1Kolodner R.D.

Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1340) Google Scholar and 4Harfe B.D. Jinks-Robertson S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2000; 34: 359-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). MutS protein encoded by a single gene specifically recognizes I/D mismatches of 1–3 nucleotides as well as 7 of 8 possible base-base mismatches, C-C mismatches being refractory to repair by this pathway. The binding affinity of MutS for a particular mismatch roughly correlates with the efficiency of repair in vivo (5Su S.S. Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6829-6835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of ATP, MutL is recruited to the mismatch and a third protein, MutH, a latent endonuclease, is activated. MutH nicks the transiently unmethylated daughter strand at hemimethylated GATC sequences thereby conferring strand specificity. Excision repair spanning the nick and the mismatch completes the process. Eukaryotes possess multiple MutS and MutL homologues. ThreeMutShomologues, MSH2-MSH6 (MutSα) and MSH2-MSH3 (MutSβ), function as heterodimers with the former recognizing base-base and small I/D mismatches and the latter preferentially repairing larger I/D mismatches (reviewed in Ref.4Harfe B.D. Jinks-Robertson S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2000; 34: 359-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Recently co-crystal structures of homodimeric Thermus aquaticus (Taq) and E. coli MutS bound to heteroduplex DNA containing an unpaired T or G-T mismatch, respectively, have been determined (6Obmolova G. Ban C. Hsieh P. Yang W. Nature. 2000; 407: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 7Lamers M.H. Perrakis A. Enzlin J.H. Winterwerp H.H.K. de Wind N. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Remarkably, interactions with the I/D and base-base mismatch are quite similar (reviewed in Ref.8Hsieh P. Mutat. Res. 2001; 486: 71-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The structures reveal the existence of a composite mismatch binding site in which the DNA is kinked at the mismatch by about 60° toward the major groove. Interestingly, a Phe-X-Glu motif at the N terminus of MutS from only one of the two subunits directly contacts the mismatch thereby rendering the protein functionally heterodimeric (see Fig. 1 A). The conserved Phe residue (Phe36in E. coli, Phe39 in Taq) stacks upon the unpaired T or the T in the G-T mispair. The importance of this residue was demonstrated in previous photocross-linking and mutational studies in bacterial MutS proteins (9Malkov V.A. Biswas I. Camerini-Otero R.D. Hsieh P. J. Biol.

The structural data reveal for the first time that Glu38 in E. coli and Glu41 inTaq contact the mismatched T via a hydrogen bond between the carboxyl oxygen of the Glu side chain and the N3 position of T. In this study, we probe the importance of hydrogen bonding in mismatch recognition by MutS. Relative binding affinities of E. coliand Taq MutS are reported using DNA duplexes in which hydrogen bonding involving the mismatch base is disrupted via the substitution of Watson-Crick bases with the non-hydrogen-bonding base analogues difluorotoluene, a shape mimic of T, and 4-methylbenzimidazole, a shape mimic of A (reviewed in Ref. 14Kool E.T. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2001; 30: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). In a second approach, Glu38 of E. coli MutS and Glu41 of Taq MutS are mutated to Ala, and the abilities of these proteins to carry out MMR in vivo and bind DNA in vitro are examined. Taq MutS protein encoded by pETMutS and E. coli His6-tagged MutS protein encoded by pTX412 were purified as described previously (15Schofield M.J. Nayak S. Scott T.H. Du C. Hsieh P. J. Biol.

The TaqMutS-E41A and E. coli E38A mutants were constructed by converting the Glu GAG codon to an Ala GCG codon using QuikChange (Stratagene) and verified by DNA sequencing. Deoxyoligonucleotides were synthesized, purified by denaturing gel electrophoresis, and 5′-32P-end-labeled as described previously (15Schofield M.J. Nayak S. Scott T.H. Du C. Hsieh P. J. Biol.

The 2,4-difluorotoluene (F) and 4-methylbenzimidazole (Z) phorphoramidites were synthesized as described previously (16Ren R.X.-F. Chaudhuri N.C. Paris P.L. Rumney IV S. Kool E.T. J. Am. Chem.

The homoduplex A-T substrate was made by annealing top and bottom strands.

Error bars represent S.D. values of triplicate measurements. pET-15b (Novagen), pTX412, or pE38A were transformed into TX2929 (CC106 mutS 201:: Tn5; Kanr) (18Feng G. Winkler E.W.

The relative affinities of E. coli andTaq MutS for a series of “homoduplex” DNAs containing normal Watson-Crick bases or nonpolar shape analogues of adenine, 4-methylbenzimidazole (Z), and thymidine, difluorotoluene (F) (see Fig.1, B and C) were measured in DNA gel mobility shift assays (Fig.2, TableI). The mismatch specificity of E. coli MutS was poor. The apparent K D for homoduplex DNA (A-T) was 20-fold higher than that for the best mismatch (ΔT), but only severalfold higher than the K D values of most other mismatches, a result consistent with earlier DNase I footprinting experiments (5Su S.S. Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6829-6835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies of eukaryotic MutS homologues also indicated relatively poor mismatch specificity (20Alani E. Mol. Cell.

In contrast, Taq MutS exhibited a roughly 1000-fold greater affinity for I/D mismatch (e.g. ΔT) heteroduplexes than for homoduplexes (see below). However, the very large preference ofTaq MutS for I/D mismatches was not apparent for base-base (e.g. G-T) mismatches as reflected in the much lower affinities for base-base mismatches. Thus, discrimination between homoduplex and base-base mismatches was, as in the case of E. coli, relatively poor (this study). 2T. H. Scott and P.

Interestingly, both E. coli and Taq MutS exhibited a small but reproducible preference for homoduplexes containing the nonpolar mimics F and Z as compared with homoduplexes containing Watson-Crick (A-T) base pairs. Duplexes containing F-A, T-Z, and F-Z base pairs were bound by E. coli MutS with apparent affinities (K D = 9.3, 16, and 10 nm, respectively) reflecting a 2–3.5-fold increase over the affinity for the corresponding Watson-Crick homoduplex (K D = 34 nm). For Taq MutS, the affinity for the F-A duplex (apparent K D = 3000 nm) was essentially unchanged from that of the normal homoduplex (apparent K D = 3800 nm), whereas the affinity for the F-Z duplex was marginally improved (apparent K D = 2100 nm). However, binding to the T-Z duplex was significantly enhanced (apparentK D = 780 nm). Previous studies of duplex stabilities as determined by thermal denaturation experiments revealed that duplexes in which T is replaced by F have lowered stability compared with normal duplexes on the order of 3.6 kcal/mol due to loss of hydrogen bonding and the cost of desolvation of the A opposite F (24Moran S. Ren R.X.-F. Kool E.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10506-10511Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The observed preference of MutS for F- and Z-containing duplexes is consistent with an induced fit mode of mismatch binding in which intrinsically destabilized duplexes containing mismatches (or nonpolar base mimics) are preferred substrates for MutS-mediated kinking. To assess the role of hydrogen bonding in mismatch recognition, we determined the relative affinities of E. coli and Taq MutS for I/D heteroduplex DNAs in which the single, unpaired base was T or A or, alternatively, the F and Z nonpolar analogues (Fig. 2; Table I). The F analogue lacks hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, i.e. N3 and O4 of T (see Fig. 1), implicated in hydrogen bonding with the Oε2 of Glu38 or Glu41 in crystal structures of E. coli andTaq MutS-mismatch complexes. Although we cannot prove that the F- and Z-containing heteroduplexes are recognized via the same Phe-X-Glu binding site, the data presented below are most consistent with an interaction involving the canonical mismatch binding site of MutS. The unpaired ΔT substrate and the unpaired ΔF substrate were bound by E. coli MutS with relative affinities corresponding toK D = 1.4 nm and 8.3 nm, respectively. This reduced affinity for the ΔF substrate, corresponding to a ΔΔG°bind of ∼1.0 kcal mol−1, was consistent with the loss of hydrogen bonding between Glu38 and the unpaired F analogue and any accompanying desolvation of Glu38. Interestingly, there was only a 2-fold difference in the relative affinities of MutS for ΔA compared with ΔZ, K D = 5.7 nm versus 11 nm. Thus, the relative contribution of the hydrogen bond between Glu38 and an I/D mismatch was not as significant for ΔA as for ΔT. A possible caveat is one of sequence context; the A/Z mismatches are on the C-rich bottom strand, whereas the T/F mismatches are on the G-rich top strand. Qualitatively similar results were obtained with Taq MutS. Substitution of ΔF for ΔT resulted in a 7-fold decrease in the apparent binding affinity, K D = 16 nm versus 2.2 nm. Again, loss of hydrogen bonding resulting from the substitution of ΔZ for ΔA had no effect on relative affinities, K D = 83 nm for ΔZversus 75 nm for ΔA. This was not unexpected given the relatively poor intrinsic affinity of Taq MutS for ΔA. These results suggest that hydrogen bonding may play a small role in binding to the high affinity ΔT substrate, but is unlikely to be a factor in binding to ΔA. This is in sharp contrast to the role of the aromatic ring stack involving Phe36/39 as mutation of Phe to Ala reduced mismatch binding affinities for both Taq andE. coli by a 1000-fold (9Malkov V.A. Biswas I. Camerini-Otero R.D. Hsieh P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23811-23817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 10Yamamoto A. Schofield M. Biswas I. Hsieh P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3564-3569Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Consistent with the small effect of hydrogen bonding on binding to I/D mismatches, substitution of Watson-Crick bases with Z or F analogues in base-base mismatches did not reveal striking effects on mismatch binding by E. coli or Taq MutS. The largest change resulted from alteration of a C-A mismatch to a C-Z mismatch yielding a 4-fold decrease in relative affinities for E. coli MutS, K D = 4.3 nm versus 19 nm. In the case of TaqMutS, changing a T-G mismatch to an F-G mismatch resulted in a 3-fold decrease in relative affinity, from a K D = 310 nm to 960 nm. However a change from T-T to F-T resulted in a 3-fold increase in affinity, from a K D = 2.3 μm to 800 nm. Although no clear trends were apparent, in most cases, substitutions of nonpolar analogues for normal bases in base-base mismatches resulted in only small changes in binding affinity. While these observations are most simply interpreted as confirming the absence of a major role for hydrogen bonding in mismatch recognition, we cannot rule out the possibility that the result is attributable to two relatively modest opposing forces. One is the destabilization of DNA duplexes by the F and Z analogues that would favor binding by MutS. Opposing this is the loss of hydrogen bonding by Glu38 (E. coli) or Glu41(Taq) that would destabilize mismatch binding. Although determination of binding affinities is imprecise at protein concentrations in the micromolar range, the data clearly reveal the relatively poor binding of base-base mismatches by Taq MutS compared with E. coli MutS. The relatively minor role of hydrogen bonding involving Glu and the mismatch base is at odds with the highly conserved nature of the Glu38/41 residue. To further probe the role of this amino acid residue in mismatch recognition, we replaced the Glu residue with Ala. The relative binding affinities of E. coli E38A and Taq E41A MutS for the high affinity ΔT substrate were unchanged (Table II). Thus, consistent with results presented above, hydrogen bonding by Glu38/41is not required for heteroduplex DNA binding, suggesting that the essential role of Glu lies elsewhere. Information regarding the critical nature of this amino acid was revealed when binding to several other DNA substrates by the mutant proteins was examined. The replacement of the acidic Glu with a neutral Ala restored high affinity binding to the ΔF heteroduplex such that it was now indistinguishable from the affinity of wild type MutS for the favored ΔT mismatch,K D values in the 1–2 nm range. In fact, the E38A and E41A mutant proteins exhibited enhanced binding for several mismatch and homoduplex substrates relative to wild type MutS protein (Table II). Strikingly, the E38A mutation in E. coliMutS substantially narrowed the gap in affinities for a mismatchversus a perfectly paired homoduplex.Table IIEffect on DNA binding of a glutamic acid to alanine mutationSubstrateE. coliTaqWild typeK DE38A K DWild typeK DE41A K DΔT1.4 ± 0.50.9 ± 0.52.2 ± 2.12.8 ± 0.6ΔF8.3 ± 2.11.5 ± 0.116 ± 2.82.0 ± 0.06ΔA5.7 ± 2.16.0 ± 1.075 ± 266.6 ± 0.6ΔZ11 ± 0.65.9 ± 0.583 ± 1429 ± 4.6T-G5.0 ± 1.73.5 ± 0.8310 ± 73240 ± 30T-A34 ± 6.19.2 ± 4.23800 ± 3602200 ± 290K D values in nm were measured using a polyacrylamide gel retardation assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Errors are calculated by S.D. values of triplicate measurements. Open table in a new tab K D values in nm were measured using a polyacrylamide gel retardation assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Errors are calculated by S.D. values of triplicate measurements. Taken together, these results indicate that Glu38/41functions in the discrimination between mismatch-containingversus perfectly paired DNA as opposed to making a critical hydrogen bond to the mismatch base. As a corollary, the data suggest that charge neutralization of an acidic residue (or removal of an unfavorable contact) in the mismatch binding site can have a significant effect on mismatch discrimination by MutS. This finding is consistent with the structural data of Taq and E. coli MutS-mismatch complexes that predict electrostatic repulsion of Glu with the phosphate backbone of a normal DNA duplex (6Obmolova G. Ban C. Hsieh P. Yang W. Nature. 2000; 407: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 7Lamers M.H. Perrakis A. Enzlin J.H. Winterwerp H.H.K. de Wind N. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Supporting evidence for the role of acidic residues in enhancing substrate selectivity stems from studies of Glu and Asp residues in the tRNA and DNA binding sites of E. coli methionyl-tRNA synthetase and E. coli RuvA, respectively (25Schmitt E. Meinnel T. Panvert M. Mechulam Y. Blanquet S. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 615-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 26Ingleston S.M. Sharples G.J. Lloyd R.G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6266-6274Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Alteration of the charge by amino acid substitution resulted in increased binding of noncognate tRNAs by methionyl-tRNA synthetase and duplex DNA by RuvA. The ability of the E. coli E38A MutS protein to carry out mismatch repair was assessed in vivo in a general mutator assay measuring the frequency of mutation to rifampicin resistance.E. coli TX2929 (CC106 mutS 201:: Tn5; Kanr) (18Feng G. Winkler E.W. BioTechniques. 1995; 19: 956-965PubMed Google Scholar) was transformed with pTX412 encoding wild typemutS, pE38A mutS, or pET15b vector alone, and relative frequencies of rifampicin-resistant colonies were scored. The mutation frequency of pE38A transformants was similar to that of pET15b vector controls (mutation frequencies of 340 ± 180 × 10−9 and 150 ± 80 × 10−9, respectively) and 2 orders of magnitude higher than transformants harboring pTX412 (0.7 ± 1.1 × 10−9). The DNA binding studies described above suggest that the mismatch repair defect of the E38A mutant protein is attributable at least in part to the loss of mismatch specificity and not to the loss of DNA binding per se. The following conclusions stem from the findings presented here. First, the data support an induced fit mode of mismatch binding in which duplexes destabilized by mismatches are preferred substrates for deformation by MutS. Second, although hydrogen bonding between Glu38/41 of the Phe-X-Glu motif and a mismatched base may contribute in some cases to binding, its relative contribution is marginal and significantly smaller than that of the aromatic ring stack involving Phe. Third, Glu38/41contributes to mismatch discrimination. Charge neutralization of this conserved acidic residue leads to an increased affinity for homoduplex DNA and loss of mismatch discrimination that may account for the mismatch repair defect of the E. coli E38A mutant protein. Our findings are consistent with the idea that Glu38/41promotes DNA kinking by MutS, because kinking reduces or eliminates unfavorable interactions between the Glu side chain and DNA."

The use of pharmacologic inhibitors and a degradation-resistant mutant IκB-α demonstrated that the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is necessary for cytokine-induced AT1 up-regulation. The increase in AT1 mRNA with TNF-α treatment is slow, reaching significance by 6–12 h and peaking by 24–48 h. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that NF-κB nuclear translocation was maintained for ≥24 h with a single dose of TNF-α. Since prolonged NF-κB activation appeared necessary to maximize AT1up-regulation, the mechanism of persistent NF-κB activation was studied further. Stimulation with TNF-α induced a >10× increase in IκB kinase (IKK) activity that quickly diminished by 20 min. IκB-α and IκB-β proteins were degraded during this time, and IκB-α was resynthesized subsequently by NF-κB-dependent transcription. However, IκB isoforms and IKK activity did not return completely to unstimulated values during a 12-h time course. These results suggest that low but persistent IKK activity and IκB degradation lead to prolonged NF-κB nuclear translocation and maximal AT1 up-regulation in the continued presence of TNF-α.

Since prolonged NF-κB activation appeared necessary to maximize AT1up-regulation, the mechanism of persistent NF-κB activation was studied further. Stimulation with TNF-α induced a >10× increase in IκB kinase (IKK) activity that quickly diminished by 20 min. IκB-α and IκB-β proteins were degraded during this time, and IκB-α was resynthesized subsequently by NF-κB-dependent transcription. However, IκB isoforms and IKK activity did not return completely to unstimulated values during a 12-h time course. These results suggest that low but persistent IKK activity and IκB degradation lead to prolonged NF-κB nuclear translocation and maximal AT1 up-regulation in the continued presence of TNF-α.

However, the mechanisms responsible for this up-regulation are not understood. Only a few agents such as dexamethasone and growth hormone have been shown to increase AT1 levels transcriptionally (18Guo D.F. Uno S. Ishihata A. Nakamura N. Inagami T. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 19Wyse B. Sernia C. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4176-4180Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Furthermore, most studies of AT1 regulation have been performed using vascular smooth muscle cells or kidney cells, and little is known about AT1 regulation in cardiac fibroblasts. We have demonstrated previously that AT1 mRNA and protein is up-regulated in cultured neonatal rat cardiac fibroblasts by TNF-α and IL-1β but not by other endogenous mediators found in the post-MI heart (20Gurantz D. Cowling R.T. Villarreal F.J. Greenberg B.H. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 272-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). These studies showed that AT1 mRNA increases were sustained for at least 24–48 h following a single application of TNF-α and that increased gene transcription was likely involved. Proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1β are increased in the rat heart following experimental MI (21Ono K. Matsumori A. Shioi T. Furukawa Y. Sasayama S. Circulation. 1998; 98: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 22Irwin M.W. Mak S. Mann D.L., Qu, R. Penninger J.M. Yan A. Dawood F. Wen W.H. Shou Z. Liu P.

Cardiol. 1999; 31: 1949-1959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Since cytokines could be responsible for post-MI increases in AT1 receptor density, we sought to determine the mechanisms and signaling pathways involved in AT1 up-regulation by TNF-α and IL-1β. The transcription factor NF-κB is a known regulator of genes that control apoptosis, inflammation, and cell division. It is composed of homodimers and heterodimers of the NF-κB/Rel family of proteins but often consists of a heterodimer of p65 and p50. In unstimulated cells, NF-κB is retained in the cytoplasm bound to a family of inhibitory IκB proteins. Of these, IκB-α and IκB-β predominate in a variety of cell types. Stimulation of cells with cytokines such as TNF-α or IL-1β leads to rapid activation of the IκB kinases (IKK1 and IKK2 of which the latter seems to be indispensable) that then phosphorylate IκB on serine residues (Ser32 and Ser36 on human IκB-α). Phosphorylation leads to ubiquitination of IκB on lysine residues (Lys21 and Lys22 on human IκB-α) and degradation by the 26 S proteasome. After removal of IκB, free NF-κB can translocate to the nucleus and affect transcription by binding consensus DNA sequences (for reviews, see Refs. 24Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4627) Google Scholar, 25Mercurio F. Manning A.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 226-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 26Karin M. Ben Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4104) Google Scholar). We now provide evidence that NF-κB activation is required for increased expression of the AT1gene by the cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β in cultured neonatal rat cardiac fibroblasts. In addition, a single dose of TNF-α persistently activates cardiac fibroblast signaling pathways that sustain NF-κB nuclear translocation for at least 24 h and maximize AT1 mRNA up-regulation. Oligodeoxyribonucleotides were synthesized by GENSET Oligos (La Jolla, CA). Pharmacologic inhibitors were purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp. Enzymes for molecular biology were from Life Technologies, Inc. GST-IκB-α-(1–54) was a generous gift from the Signal Research Division of Celgene (San Diego, CA). Primary antibodies for immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Radioisotopes were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences Inc. Neonatal rat cardiac fibroblasts were isolated from the hearts of 1–2-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats as described previously (27Kim N.N. Villarreal F.J. Printz M.P. Lee A.A. Dillmann W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: E426-E437PubMed Google Scholar). Second passage cells were used for all experiments. Fibroblasts were grown on tissue culture plates in medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium high glucose, Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin/Fungizone (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 10% CO2. Prior to initiating experiments (except those involving adenovirus), cells were grown to confluence then equilibrated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 0.5% fetal bovine serum for 24 h. Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RNA concentration was determined by absorbance at 260 nm. Six micrograms of RNA was diluted into water, denatured by heating at 70 °C for 10 min, and then chilled on ice. An equal volume of 20× SSC (3 m NaCl, 0.3 msodium citrate (pH 7.0)) was then added. Samples were slotted onto a nylon membrane (MagnaGraph, Micron Separations, Westborough, MA) using the Bio-Dot SF Microfiltration Apparatus (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Slots were washed once with 10× SSC. The membrane was removed from the apparatus, washed in 10× SSC, and allowed to air-dry. RNA was fixed to the membrane by heating at 80 °C for 2 h in a desiccating oven. Membranes were incubated at 42 °C in prehybridization solution (50% formamide, 5× saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, 15 μg/ml sheared, heat-denatured salmon DNA) for several hours in roller bottles. Heat-denatured 32P-labeled probe (radiolabeled using the Multiprime DNA labeling system, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) was added, and the hybridization was allowed to proceed overnight. Membranes were washed thrice at low stringency (2× SSC, 0.1% SDS; 42 °C; 20 min per wash) and thrice at high stringency (0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS; 65 °C; 20 min per wash). Damp membranes were exposed to a Storage Phosphor Screen and then visualized on the Storm 860 fluorescent scanner (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Signal intensities were quantified using the software supplied with the scanner (ImageQuant). The probe for AT1 mRNA was the ∼1.4 kbp EcoRI fragment of plasmid ATIIR/pG4z (provided by Dr. David Pribnow, Oregon Health Sciences University). To standardize loading between slots, membranes were stripped and reprobed with a cDNA representing nucleotides 2837–4436 of human 28 S rRNA. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, placed on ice, lysed with cytoplasmic extraction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.4% Igepal CA-630, 1 mmdl-dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 kallikrein inhibitory units/ml aprotinin, 0.1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 5 min and scraped from the plate. The mixture was microcentrifuged at 2500 rpm for 3 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant (cytoplasmic extract) was collected. The pellet was washed by gentle resuspension in cytoplasmic extraction buffer and centrifuged again. Nuclear extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 420 mm NaCl, 25% glycerol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 kallikrein inhibitory units/ml) was added to the pellet and vortexed for 1 min. The mixture was allowed to stand on ice for 10 min and then microcentrifuged at maximum speed for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (nuclear extract) was collected. If phosphoproteins were to be analyzed, extraction buffers also contained 0.5 mmsodium orthovanadate and 5 mm β-glycerophosphate to inhibit phosphatases. Protein concentrations of extracts were quantified with a Bio-Rad protein assay (catalog no. 500-0006). Equal amounts of protein were electrophoresed on a Bio-Rad Mini-PROTEAN II apparatus using the discontinuous SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis system of Laemmli (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207509) Google Scholar). Resolved proteins were transferred electrophoretically to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore) in 192 mm glycine, 25 mm Tris, 10% methanol. The membrane was allowed to air-dry, then wetted in methanol, and floated in distilled water for 1–2 min. At this point, protein bands could be seen as “shiny” areas on a dull membrane background to verify equal loading between lanes. The rewetted membrane was immunoblotted using ECF Western blotting Reagent Packs (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) following the instructions of the manufacturer. Fluorescent bands were visualized on the Storm 860 scanner in blue fluorescence mode with a photomultiplier tube voltage of 600–700. Band intensities were quantified using the software supplied with the scanner. Nuclear extracts were prepared from cultured fibroblasts as described for Western blotting. Gel-shift assays for NF-κB were performed as described by Jobin et al. (29Jobin C. Haskill S. Mayer L. Panja A. Sartor R.B. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 226-234PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a double-stranded synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotide corresponding to the NF-κB consensus sequence in the B-cell κ light chain enhancer region (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′) (30Lenardo M.J. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 58: 227-229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar) was radiolabeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP and purified with a QIAquick Nucleotide Removal kit (Qiagen). Nuclear extract (2 μg of protein) was incubated with the radiolabeled probe. Bound probe and free probe were separated by electrophoresis on a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried and exposed either to film (Kodak BioMax MS) or to a Storage Phosphor Screen. Adenovirus expressing a degradation-resistant mutant of IκB-α (Ad-IκBαM) was a generous gift from Dr. Inder Verma of the Salk Institute (La Jolla, CA). Construction of the mutant has been described elsewhere (31Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2452) Google Scholar). An adenovirus containing a promoterless luciferase gene was used to determine the effect of adenoviral infection alone on cardiac fibroblasts. For this purpose, a promoterless luciferase gene was excised from the plasmid pGL3-Basic (Promega, Madison, WI) by digestion with BglII and BamHI and ligated into theNotI sites of the adenoviral shuttle vector pACCMV·pLpASR(−) using synthetic linker-adapters. A clone that had the luciferase gene inserted in a positive orientation with respect to the adenoviral genome was selected. Adenovirus was produced by recombination between this shuttle vector and the full-length adenovirus-5 vector pJM17 as described by Gómez-Foix et al. (32Gómez-Foix A.M. Coats W.S. Baque S. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25129-25134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fibroblasts were grown to confluence in 6-cm tissue culture plates. Two extra plates were seeded to determine cell number via hemacytometer counting. Fibroblasts were infected with adenovirus (at a multiplicity of infection of 5 plaque-forming units/fibroblast) in 3 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 2% fetal bovine serum (heat-inactivated at 65 °C for 15 min) for 18 h. The medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 0.5% fetal bovine serum, and the cells were allowed to recover for 6 h. Cells were then treated and processed according to the protocol of each experiment. Neonatal rat fibroblasts were assayed for IKK kinase activity as described previously (33Aupperle K.R. Bennett B.L. Boyle D.L. Tak P.P. Manning A.M. Firestein G.S. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 427-433PubMed Google Scholar, 34Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L., Li, J. Young D.B. Barbosa M. Mann M. Manning A. Rao A. Science. 1997; 278: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Immunoprecipitation was performed using a rabbit polyclonal antibody against IKKα/β (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., catalog no. sc-7607) on 200 μg of total extracted protein (determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay, catalog no. 500-0006). Kinase assays contained 2.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 2.5 μM cold ATP, and 1 μg GST-IκB-α-(1–54) (34Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L., Li, J. Young D.B. Barbosa M. Mann M. Manning A. Rao A. Science. 1997; 278: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar). Polyacrylamide gels were fixed in 50% methanol, 10% acetic acid for 2 h and then soaked overnight in several changes of water. Dried gels were exposed to a Storage Phosphor Screen and visualized on the Storm 860 fluorescent scanner. Signal intensities were quantified using the software supplied with the scanner. Data were collected from at least three independent experiments. Quantitative data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined by one-way analysis of variance followed by multiple comparison testing using GraphPad Prism software (version 3.00, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). We have demonstrated previously that TNF-α increases the steady state levels of AT1 mRNA in cultured neonatal rat cardiac fibroblasts. AT1 mRNA up-regulation peaked at 24–48 h with an EC50 of 4.6 ng/ml (0.26 nm) TNF-α. The stability of AT1 mRNA was unchanged by treatment with TNF-α, which suggested that increased transcription was responsible for the up-regulation (20Gurantz D. Cowling R.T. Villarreal F.J. Greenberg B.H. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 272-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). IL-1β also up-regulated AT1 mRNA, an effect that peaks at ∼12 h with an EC50 of 0.32 ng/ml (17 pm). 2D. Gurantz, R. T. Cowling, J. Alvergue, E. Fricovsky, and B. H. Greenberg, manuscript in preparation. TNF-α and IL-1β are known to affect numerous signaling pathways including those that activate NF-κB or mitogen-activated protein kinase and those that generate ceramide or nitric oxide (35Eder J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 319-322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 36Wallach D. Varfolomeev E.E. Malinin N.L. Goltsev Y.V. Kovalenko A.V. Boldin M.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 331-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the mechanism responsible for AT1 mRNA up-regulation pharmacologic compounds that are known to inhibit such signaling pathways were tested (Fig. 1). TNF-α and IL-1β produced similar profiles of pharmacologic inhibition. Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, an antioxidant/pro-oxidant, MG-132, a proteasome inhibitor, SB203580 and SB202190, both p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors, D609, a phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C inhibitor, and Ro-31-8220, a protein kinase C inhibitor, significantly reduced cytokine-induced AT1mRNA up-regulation (Fig. 1). SB202474, an inactive pyridinyl imidazole compound,N G-monomethyl-l-arginine, a nitric-oxide synthase inhibitor, indomethacin, a cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, fumonisin B1, a ceramide synthase inhibitor, and Z-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)-CH2F, a caspase inhibitor, had no significant effect on AT1 up-regulation (Fig. 1). When considered collectively, all of the compounds that inhibited AT1 up-regulation have been shown to inhibit NF-κB activity by inhibiting nuclear translocation, DNA binding, or transcriptional competency (37Bergmann M. Hart L. Lindsay M. Barnes P.J. Newton R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6607-6610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 38Brennan P. O'Neill L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1260: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 39Brennan P. O'Neill L.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 975-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 40Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1921) Google Scholar). In addition, the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor PD98059 increased AT1mRNA levels significantly with TNF-α treatment (Fig. 1). Funakoshi et al. (41Funakoshi M. Tago K. Sonoda Y. Tominaga S. Kasahara T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that cytokine-induced NF-κB activation can be augmented by PD98059 in T98G cells. Therefore, the screen of pharmacologic compounds suggested the involvement of NF-κB, but additional evidence using a more selective inhibitor was needed. To confirm the role of NF-κB, cultured cardiac fibroblasts were infected with an adenovirus-5 expressing a mutant (Ser32,36→ Ala32,36) IκB-α (Ad-IκBαM) that cannot be phosphorylated and degraded and thus sequesters NF-κB in the cytoplasm (31Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2452) Google Scholar). Ad-IκBαM completely blocked NF-κB nuclear translocation induced by IL-1β, while a negative control adenovirus (Ad-Less-Luc) had no effect (Fig.2 A, upper panel). In contrast, Ad-IκBαM did not affect phosphorylation of the transcription factors c-Jun and ATF-2, which is an indirect measure of mitogen-activated protein kinase activation (Fig.2 A, middle and lower panels). Thus, Ad-IκBαM appeared to specifically inhibit NF-κB activation in the fibroblasts. When tested on AT1 expression, Ad-IκBαM completely blocked IL-1β-induced AT1 mRNA up-regulation, while Ad-Less-Luc had no significant effect (Fig.2 B). Therefore, the use of the signaling mutant and pharmacologic inhibitors provides strong evidence that the transcription factor NF-κB is necessary for cytokine-induced up-regulation of AT1 mRNA. Gurantz et al. (20Gurantz D. Cowling R.T. Villarreal F.J. Greenberg B.H. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 272-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) demonstrated that AT1mRNA was elevated for 24–48 h in neonatal rat cardiac fibroblasts after a single administration of TNF-α to the culture medium. Assuming that the half-life of AT1 mRNA in these cells is ∼18 h (42Matsubara H. Kanasaki M. Murasawa S. Tsukaguchi Y. Nio Y. Inada M. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1592-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), NF-κB would need to be activated for at least 24 h to increase AT1 mRNA as observed. As shown in Fig. 3 A, nuclear translocation of NF-κB occurred within 1 h of a single dose of 50 ng/ml TNF-α and persisted for at least 24 h as measured by EMSA; NF-κB was barely detected in the nuclei of fibroblasts that were not stimulated with cytokine. To verify the identity of the band in Fig.3 A as NF-κB, it was competed with excess nonradiolabeled κB probe (Fig. 3 B, lane 3) and supershifted by an anti-p65 antibody (Fig. 3 B, lane 4). Nonspecific rabbit IgG was unable to supershift the complex (Fig. 3 B, lane 5). In the presence of TNF-α some cell types transiently activate NF-κB, while others maintain a persistent activation (43Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar, 44Krasnow S.W. Zhang L.Q. Leung K.Y. Osborn L. Kunkel S. Nabel G.J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 9825-9832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Neonatal rat cardiac fibroblasts belong to the latter group according to Fig. 3 A. To study the mechanism of persistent NF-κB activation in these cells, the protein levels of IκB isoforms α and β were analyzed by immunoblotting. During TNF-α treatment IκB-α was degraded and resynthesized rapidly, reaching a minimum by 15 min and then rebounding by 60 min (Fig. 4). In contrast IκB-β was degraded and resynthesized more slowly, reaching a minimum by 60 min and rising slightly over 12 h (Fig.4). Despite evidence of resynthesis, both IκB isoforms did not return to time 0 values during the 12-h time course (Fig. 4 B), an effect that required the continued presence of TNF-α. For example, after 6 h of treatment with TNF-α, IκB-α was 79.5% and IκB-β was 38.4% of that in untreated cells (Fig.5 A, lanes 3 and7). However, if TNF-α was removed from the medium after 1 h of the 6-h incubation, IκB-α was 136.4% and IκB-β was 70.7% (Fig. 5 A, lanes 4 and8). During this period of cytokine removal, p65 protein levels dropped in the nucleus as assessed by immunoblotting (Fig.5 B, compare lanes 11 and 12). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that sustained NF-κB activation is caused by a persistent degradation of IκB isoforms that depends on the continued presence of TNF-α. Sustained NF-κB activation appears necessary to maximize AT1 mRNA increases since removal of TNF-α during a 24-h incubation prevents AT1 mRNA up-regulation (Fig. 5 B).Figure 5The continued presence of TNF-α is required to suppress IκB levels, maintain p65 nuclear translocation, and up-regulate AT1 mRNA in cardiac fibroblasts.Confluent fibroblasts were stimulated with or without 50 ng/ml TNF-α for the indicated times. A, cytoplasmic IκB isoforms and nuclear p65. Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared and immunoblotted for IκB-α and IκB-β as described in Fig. 4. Nuclear extracts were also prepared and subjected to immunoblotting for p65 (2.5 μg of total protein loaded per lane; primary antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., catalog no. sc-372, used at 1:200 dilution).B, AT1 mRNA. Total RNA was isolated from the cells, and AT1 mRNA was quantified by slot-blotting as described under “Experimental Procedures.” All plots were derived from three independent experiments (mean ± S.E.).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To study further the mechanism of persistent IκB degradation, IKK kinase assays were performed. IKK is the proximal kinase that phosphorylates IκB, thus regulating IκB ubiquitination and degradation (25Mercurio F. Manning A.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 226-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Stimulation of neonatal rat cardiac fibroblasts with TNF-α increased IKK activity 10–15× during the first 5–15 min (Fig. 6, A and B). Kinase activity then rapidly diminished by 20 min (Fig. 6 A). However, IKK activity did not return completely to basal levels, remaining 2–4× that of unstimulated cells over a 12-h time course (Fig. 6 B). Low but persistently elevated IKK activity could continue to phosphorylate IκB, especially after it rebinds NF-κB in the nucleus. Phosphorylated IκB would be degraded, sustaining NF-κB nuclear translocation and preventing IκB isoforms from returning to control values. Most of the effects of angiotensin II that are involved in extracellular matrix remodeling are mediated by the AT1receptor whose density is increased in the hearts of experimental animals post-MI (15Lefroy D."

The human actin binding protein filamin-1 (hsFLNa, also known as ABP-280) participates in orthogonal actin network, cellular stress responses, signal transduction, and cell migration. Through a yeast two-hybrid system, an in vitro binding assay, and in vivo co-immunoprecipitations, we identified an interaction between BRCA2 and hsFLNa. The hsFLNa binding domain of BRCA2 was mapped to an internal conserved region, and the BRCA2-interacting domain of hsFLNa was mapped to its C terminus. Although hsFLNa is known for its cytoplasmic functions in cell migration and signal transduction, some hsFLNa resides in the nucleus, raising the possibility that it participates in DNA damage response through a nuclear interaction with BRCA2. Lack of hsFLNa renders a human melanoma cell line (M2) more sensitive to several genotoxic agents including γ irradiation, bleomycin, and ultraviolet-c light. These results suggest that BRCA2/hsFLNa interaction may serve to connect cytoskeletal signal transduction to DNA damage response pathways.

The BRCA2 gene encodes a 3418-amino acid protein with very little homology to other known proteins (1Wooster R. Bignell G. Lancaster J. Swift S. Seal S. Mangion J. Collins N. Gregory S. Gumbs C.

The overall identity of BRCA2 is 58–59% between rodents (rat and mouse) and human, which is an uncommonly low level of conservation for a tumor suppressor (8Sharan S.K. Bradley A. Genomics. 1997; 40: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 9McAllister K.A. Haugen-Strano A. Hagevik S. Brownlee H.A. Collins N.K. Futreal P.A. Bennett L.M. Wiseman R.W. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3121-3125PubMed Google Scholar). By comparing the amino acid sequences of mouse and human BRCA2, five highly conserved regions have been identified within BRCA2 and designated as Domain I through Domain V (8Sharan S.K. Bradley A. Genomics. 1997; 40: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It is expected that important functions of BRCA2 reside in these conserved regions. Domain I resides in amino acids (aa)1 1–100 and is a putative transcriptional activation domain (10Milner J. Ponder B. Hughes-Davies L. Seltmann M. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1997; 386: 772-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Domain II (aa 1001–1051 of human, aa 980–1030 of mouse) and Domain III (aa 1089–1138 of human, aa 1072–1120 of mouse) reside in exon 11 (8), which also contains the eight loosely conserved BRC motifs (11Bignell G. Micklem G. Stratton M.R. Ashworth A. Wooster R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) that mediate interaction with RAD51 (12Chen P.L. Chen C.F. Chen Y. Xiao J.

Domain IV (aa 2479–3157 of human; aa 2400–3075 of mouse) is coded by exons 14–24 (8Sharan S.K. Bradley A. Genomics. 1997; 40: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Domain V (aa 3267–3316 of human; aa 3190–3238 of mouse) is encoded by exon 27 and also mediates BRCA2/RAD51 interaction (14Sharan S.K. Morimatsu M. Albrecht U. Lim D.S. Regel E. Dinh C. Sands A. Eichele G. Hasty P. Bradley A. Nature. 1997; 386: 804-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). A putative nuclear localization signal also resides in exon 27 (15). Domain IV is the longest of the conserved domains, yet the least understood. In mouse, two mutations delete some of the BRC repeats (truncation at aa 1492 deleting BRC repeat 4–8 and truncation at aa 2014 deleting BRC repeat 8), together with conserved Domains IV and V. Both result in partial lethality of embryos and infertility, as well as enhanced expression of p21 and p53 (4Patel K.J., Yu, V.P. Lee H. Corcoran A. Thistlethwaite F.C. Evans M.J. Colledge W.H.

Grigorieva E. Tybulewicz V.L. Ashworth A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). However, truncation of mouse BRCA2 at aa 3140, which preserves all of the BRC repeats plus Domain IV and deletes only Domain V, results in no p21 and p53 induction (19Morimatsu M. Donoho G. Hasty P. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3441-3447PubMed Google Scholar). Mice with this truncation have much higher rate of viability and are fertile. 2P. Hasty, personal communication. The difference in phenotype between truncation at aa 2014 and truncation at aa 3140 indicates that important functions might reside in Domain IV and its flanking BRC8 repeat. Recently, a few protein interaction partners of Domain IV have been identified. A protein named DSS1 (Deleted inSplit hand/Split foot) interacts with aa 2472–2957 within Domain IV (20Marston N.J. Richards W.J. Hughes D. Bertwistle D. Marshall C.J. Ashworth A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4633-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The function of human DSS1 is uncertain. The yeast DSS1 homologue (also termed SEM) plays roles in cell growth and differentiation (21Jantti J. Lahdenranta J. Olkkonen V.M. Soderlund H. Keranen S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 909-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A second protein named hBUBR1 interacts with aa 2867–3176 of Domain IV and affects the phosphorylation status of BRCA2 (22Futamura M. Arakawa H. Matsuda K. Katagiri T. Saji S. Miki Y. Nakamura Y. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1531-1535PubMed Google Scholar). hBUBR1 and its yeast homologues contain a kinase domain, and may participate in mitotic checkpoint control (22Futamura M. Arakawa H. Matsuda K.

Cancer Lett. 2000; 158: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We have also identified a novel protein, designated BCCIPα (Brc a2, and cip1interacting protein) that interacts with Domain IV (25Liu J. Yuan Y. Huan J. Shen Z. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 336-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). BCCIPα is an evolutionarily conserved protein that may participate in the regulation of tumorigenesis (25Liu J. Yuan Y. Huan J. Shen Z. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 336-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Here, we report an interaction of the BRCA2-conserved Domain IV with the actin-binding protein hsFLNa (human nonmuscle filamin-1). hsFLNa (also known as ABP-280) is an actin cross-linking protein (26Gorlin J.B. Yamin R. Egan S. Stewart M. Stossel T.P. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1089-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) that participates in cytoskeletal remodeling, signal transduction, and protein nuclear translocation (for a review see Ref. 27Stossel T. Condeelis J. Cooley L. Hartwig J. Noegel A. Schleicher M. Shapiro S. Nat. Rev. Mol.

In addition, we report that hsFLNa-deficiency in human cells is associated with cellular sensitization to DNA-damage agents such as γ irradiation, bleomycin, and UV-C. These data suggest a functional affiliation of hsFLNa with the DNA damage response pathway. The yeast Matchmaker two-hybrid system (CLONTECH Laboratory, Palo Alto, CA) was used for a library screen as described in a previous publication (25Liu J. Yuan Y. Huan J. Shen Z. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 336-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In brief, BRCA2H (aa 2883–3053), a BRCA2 fragment, was cloned into the Gal4-DNA binding domain (Gal4-DB) vector (pAS2–1) to screen a library of human lymphocyte cDNAs fused to the Gal4-DNA activation domain (Gal4-DA) vector (pACT). MV103 cells were used as the host strain (34Vidal M. Bartel P. Fields S. The Yeast Two-hybrid System. Oxford University Press, Inc., New York1997: 109-147Google Scholar). An independent yeast host strain (SFY526) and vectors (pGBT9 and pGAD424) were used to confirm the interaction identified in the library screen. Yeast two-hybrid filter assays and liquid quantitative assays were performed according to the Matchmaker manual. pGBT9 and pGAD424 were used as negative controls. To express a His-tagged hsFLNa fusion protein, an hsFLNa C-terminal fragment (aa 2250–2647) was cloned into pET28a (Novagen) and transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). His/hsFLNa fusion protein expression and purification was performed as described previously (25Liu J. Yuan Y. Huan J. Shen Z.

To fuse glutathioneS-transferase (GST) with fragments of BRCA2, various coding regions of BRCA2 were amplified by PCR and cloned into pGEX-5X-1 or pGEX-5X-3. These plasmids were transformed into competent E. coli BL21, and the expression and purification of GST fusion proteins were performed as previously described (25Liu J. Yuan Y. Huan J. Shen Z.

GST or GST/BRCA2 fragments bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with 10 μg of purified His/hsFLNa (aa 2250–2647) in binding buffer (100 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 12.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol) for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times with wash buffer I (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 1 mmEDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) and three times with wash buffer II (200 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 1 mmEDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40). The beads were collected and resuspended in 2× sample buffer. Samples were boiled for 5 min and separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and co-precipitated His/hsFLNa proteins were detected by immunoblotting with anti-His antibody and anti-GST antibody (Santa Cruz). Proteinase inhibitor mixture (Sigma) was used in the lysis, binding, and washing buffers. Two BRCA2 fragments, BRCA2F (aa 2883–3418) and BRCA2B (aa 2883–3194), were cloned into pHA-CMV vector to tag them with the HA epitope. The C terminus of hsFLNa (aa 2250–2647) was cloned into pMyc-CMV vector to tag it with the Myc epitope. Plasmids were transfected into 293 human kidney cells using GenePorter transfection reagent (GeneTherapy Systems). Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were collected, treated with lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1× protease inhibitors (Boehringer)), sonicated, and centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 rpm. The supernatant (whole cell lysate) was used for immunoprecipitation. Forty microliters of anti-HA affinity matrix (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was incubated with 1 mg of whole cell lysate at 4 °C on a rocker for 20 min. The matrix was then washed six times in wash buffer (200 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1× protease inhibitors). Proteins retained on the beads were eluted with 2× SDS sample buffer by boiling for 5 min. Western blotting was performed using anti-HA polyclonal antibody (CLONTECH) and anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (CLONTECH). To precipitate endogenous BRCA2, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mmEDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40). Two milligrams of protein were incubated with 4 μg of BRCA2 antibody (Ab-1, Oncogene) for 1.5 h, protein A plus G beads (Santa Cruz) were added for an additional 2 h. Beads were collected and washed ten times in lysis buffer. Then 2× SDS sample buffer was added and heated at 55 °C for 10 min. Samples were resolved by 5% PAGE gel. Cells were cultured in chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International) for 12 h, fixed with PBS-buffered paraformaldehyde solution (3% paraformaldehyde, PBS, pH 7.4, 2% sucrose) for 30 min and permeabilized in permeabilization solution (0.5% Triton X-100, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 3 mmMgCl2, 300 mm sucrose) for 15 min. Slides were blocked by a 30-min incubation with 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS and then incubated with primary antibody (monoclonal anti-filamin antibody, Chemicon) at 4 °C overnight. Nonspecific mouse IgG was used as a negative control. The cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Pierce) for 30 min. The stained cells were mounted under coverslips with Vectashield mounting medium containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories). Immunofluorescence was recorded using the Zeiss confocal microscope LSD 510 with Ar/Kr and UV laser sources. To prepare whole cell protein extracts, HeLa cells were trypsinized, washed in ice-cold PBS, pelleted, resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mmEGTA, 0.1% Tween 20, 10% glycerol, 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmNaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO5, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin) and sonicated for 30 s. Insoluble debris was removed from extracts by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 8 min, and the soluble fractions were retained as whole cell extracts. To prepare nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts, HeLa cells were trypsinized, washed in PBS and then in buffer X (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1× protease inhibitors (Boehringer)), pelleted, and resuspended in buffer X containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 for 10 min on ice. The lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was taken as the cytoplasm/membrane fraction. The remaining nuclear pellet was washed with buffer X containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and resuspended in the same buffer containing 1× loading buffer. The samples were then sonicated and boiled before loading onto the SDS-PAGE gel. Human M2 and A7 cells were kindly provided by Drs. T. P. Stossel and Y. Ohta (Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Harvard Medical School). M2 is a human melanoma cell line lacking hsFLNa expression. The A7 cell line was derived from M2 by stably transfecting with a plasmid expressing full-length hsFLNa cDNA (37Cunningham C.C. Gorlin J.B. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. Janmey P.A. Byers H.R. Stossel T.P. Science. 1992; 255: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Cells were subcultured twice a week in minimum essential medium Eagle with Earle’s salt (EMEM) (M2) or EMEM with 0.5 mg/ml G418 (A7). MCF-7 cells and Capan-1 cells were obtained from ATCC and cultured as recommended. All media contained 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. The number of cells to be plated for each assay was determined by a pilot experiment so as to yield 50–100 surviving colonies per 100-mm plate. For radiation sensitivity assay, 18 h after the cells were plated cells were irradiated with a Cs-137 γ rays (dose rate: 1.05 Gray/min). For UV-C sensitivity assay, the UV-C exposure was achieved at 1.3 J/m2/s dose rate. For bleomycin sensitivity assay, exponentially growing cells were treated with bleomycin for 2 h, trypsinized, and plated. In all the assays, cells were incubated for 12–14 days for colony formation. The colonies were stained with crystal violet and counted to determine cell viability. The number of colonies was normalized to the number of cells plated to calculate the surviving fraction. A portion of BRCA2 Domain IV comprising amino acids 2883–3053 (designated BRCA2H) was used as “bait” for a yeast two-hybrid screen. BRCA2H is 77% identical between human and mouse, compared with the overall identity of 58–59% (8Sharan S.K. Bradley A. Genomics. 1997; 40: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Nine independent clones containing the C terminus of hsFLNa were isolated from a total of 4 × 105 independent clones. The interaction of these nine clones with BRCA2H was confirmed using a second, independent yeast two-hybrid system (SFY526 instead of MV103 as host yeast, pGBT9 instead of pAS2–1 and pGAD424 instead of pACT as vectors). To further map the region of hsFLNa required for interaction with BRCA2H, defined C-terminal portions of hsFLNa were tested in the yeast two-hybrid system. hsFLNa is an elongated homodimeric, Y-shaped structure (26Gorlin J.B. Yamin R. Egan S. Stewart M. Stossel T.P. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1089-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Each monomer consists of an N-terminal actin binding domain followed by 24 tandem repeats, each ∼96 amino acids in length. The last 65 amino acids of its C terminus contain a self-assembly sequence that allows dimerization. This repeat is separated from the previous 23 repeats by an ∼34-amino acid “hinge” domain. Ten hsFLNa constructs containing tandem repeats and/or the hinge region, as described in Fig. 1, were cloned into pGAD424. Each of the ten constructs was co-expressed with Gal4-DB/BRCA2H fusion protein in SFY526 cells and tested for interaction. The largest construct tested, comprising aa 2250–2647, represents the minimum region of hsFLNa required for interaction with BRCA2. This region is also known to interact with several other proteins (Fig. 1 B) (Please see Ref. 27Stossel T. Condeelis J. Cooley L. Hartwig J. Noegel A. Schleicher M. Shapiro S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 138Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar and citations therein). To map the hsFLNa binding domain in BRCA2, four BRCA2 fragments were constructed: BRCA2H (aa 2883–3053), BRCA2Q (aa 2883–3036), BRCA2S (aa 2883–3001), and BRCA2N (aa 2973–3053) (Fig.2 A). These constructs were tested for interaction with hsFLNa (aa 2250–2647) in a filter assay (Fig. 2 A). BRCA2H, BRCA2Q, and BRCA2S were also tested in a quantitative yeast two-hybrid assay (Fig. 2 B). Based on these data, the putative hsFLNa binding site can be assigned to a small region common to these constructs, namely aa 2973–3001 of BRCA2. Although the yeast two-hybrid assays demonstrate that hsFLNa and BRCA2 interact, it was not clear whether this interaction is a direct BRCA2/hsFLNa binding or mediated by other protein(s) in yeast. To further test whether hsFLNa directly binds to BRCA2, an in vitro protein-binding assay using purified recombinant proteins was performed. The BRCA2-interacting domain of hsFLNa (aa 2250–2647) was fused with a His6 tag. Various regions of BRCA2 were fused with GST and summarized in Fig.3 C. The BRCA2/GST fusion proteins were purified to near-homogeneity and used to precipitate His/hsFLNa (aa 2250–2647) fusion protein (Fig. 3, A and B). None of the negative controls bound to His/hsFLNa (aa 2250–2647) (Fig. 3, A and B, lanes 2,3). GST/BRCA2S (aa 2883–3001) and GST/BRCA2N (aa 2973–3053) co-precipitate His/hsFLNa (aa 2250–2647). Since aa 2973–3001 is the region shared by BRCA2N and BRCA2S, we conclude that BRCA2 (aa 2973–3001) is the minimal domain for interaction with hsFLNa, consistent with the yeast two-hybrid data. We noticed that BRCA2Q (aa 2883–3036) interacts with hsFLNa in the yeast two-hybrid system but fails to bind hsFLNa in vitro and that BRCA2P (aa 2973–3041) contains aa 2973–3001 but fails to bind hsFLNa in vitro (Fig. 3 C). This inconsistency may be caused by the different protein contexts of Gal4versus GST fusions or the folding of the recombinant GST/BRCA2Q and GST/BRCA2P proteins such that the interaction domain is covered. To confirm that complex formation between BRCA2 and hsFLNa occurs in vivo, Co-IP was performed in mammalian cells. Both exogenously expressed and endogenous proteins were tested. Because smaller fragments of BRCA2 (BRCA2H, BRCA2Q, BRCA2S, and BRCA2N) exhibited limited solubility when tagged with an HA epitope (data not shown), longer BRCA2 constructs, BRCA2B (aa 2883–3194) and BRCA2F (aa 2883–3418), were used for exogenously expressed proteins. Both of the latter contain the minimal hsFLNa-interacting domain of BRCA2, aa 2973–3001. A C-terminal hsFLNa fragment (aa 2250–2647) was tagged with a Myc epitope. Myc/hsFLNa (aa 2250–2647) was co-expressed in 293 human kidney cells with HA/BRCA2B or HA/BRCA2F, or with empty HA vector or a non-relevant protein, HA/BCCIPα (25Liu J. Yuan Y. Huan J. Shen Z. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 336-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), as negative controls. The HA-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA affinity matrix, and co-precipitated Myc/hsFLNa (aa 2250–2647) was detected by anti-Myc antibody. As shown in Fig. 4 (top panel), HA/BCCIPα (lane 6) or HA vector (lane 9) did not co-precipitate Myc/hsFLNa (aa 2250–2647). On the other hand, HA/BRCA2B (lane 7) and HA/BRCA2F (lane 8) co-precipitate Myc/hsFLNa (aa 2250–2647). These data suggest a stable complex between BRCA2 and hsFLNa in vivo. To investigate the endogenous protein complex, MCF-7 and Capan-1 cells were used. MCF-7 expresses the wild type BRCA2 protein, while Capan-1 cell contains the 6174delT mutation that produces an ∼230-kDa C-terminally truncated protein lacking the hsFLNa interaction domain. We used an anti-BRCA2 antibody (Ab-1, Oncogene) that reacts with both the full-length and the 230-kDa-truncated BRCA2 protein for immunoprecipitation. The immunoprecipitated BRCA2 protein complex was immunoblotted with anti-hsFLNa and anti-BRCA2. As shown in Fig.4 B, both the wild type BRCA2 from MCF-7 cells and the truncated BRCA2 from Capan-1 cells were precipitated with the anti-BRCA2 antibody (lanes 3 and 4 ofbottom panel). Both MCF-7 and Capan-1 cells express hsFLNa protein (lanes 1 and 2 of top panel). However, only the endogenous hsFLNa from MCF-7 was co-precipitated with BRCA2 (lane 3, top panel), but not from Capan-1 cells (lane 4, top panel). These further indicate that a stable complex exists in vivo between full-length BRCA2 and hsFLNa and that the C-terminal region deleted in Capan-1 cells is required for the interaction. BRCA2 has been described as a predominant nuclear protein (39Bertwistle D. Swift S. Marston N.J. Jackson L.E. Crossland S. Crompton M.R. Marshall C.J. Ashworth A. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5485-5488PubMed Google Scholar). hsFLNa is thought to execute most of its functions in the cytoplasm (26Gorlin J.B. Yamin R. Egan S. Stewart M. Stossel T.P. Kwiatkowski D.J.

Robson C.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1618-1626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It might be argued that the interaction between hsFLNa and BRCA2 is not physiologically relevant since they apparently reside in different cellular compartments. To address this issue, we performed immunostaining of hsFLNa in human skin fibroblast and HeLa cells to observe the distribution of hsFLNa with confocal microscopy, which detects fluorescent signals from a thin intersection of 0.5 μm within the cells. The majority of hsFLNa was seen in the cytoplasmic compartment of the cells (Fig. 5,B, C, E, F), which is consistent with previous reports (26Gorlin J.B. Yamin R. Egan S. Stewart M. Stossel T.P.

However, a moderate level of hsFLNa signal was seen in the nucleus as well, suggesting that a fraction of hsFLNa resides in the nucleus. To further demonstrate that hsFLNa exists in the nucleus, the cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins were extracted from HeLa cells and analyzed by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 5 G, hsFLNa protein was detected in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions. YY1 and paxillin are used as nuclear and cytoplasmic controls, respectively. The diverse interaction partners of hsFLNa suggest its multiple functions in different cellular processes (27Stossel T. Condeelis J. Cooley L. Hartwig J. Noegel A. Schleicher M. Shapiro S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 138Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). Characterization of these interacting proteins has provided major insights into the roles of hsFLNa. For instance, hsFLNa was related to integrin signaling pathways through its association with β1, β2, and β7 integrins (31Sharma C.P. Ezzell R.M. Arnaout M.A. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 3461-3470PubMed Google Scholar,32Loo D.T. Kanner S.B. Aruffo A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 1689-1698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The physiological significance of hsFLNa was suggested by the discovery of an X-linked dominant human disorder, periventricular heterotopia, caused by mutations in the hsFLNa gene. Mutations are embryonic lethal in males; in females, they are characterized by defects in the migration of cerebral cortical neurons and vascular abnormalities (45Critchley D.R. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 2000; 12: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 46Fox J.W. Lamperti E.D. Eksioglu Y.Z. Hong S.E. Feng Y. Graham D.A. Scheffer I.E. Dobyns W.B. Hirsch B.A. Radtke R.A. Berkovic S.F. Huttenlocher P.R. Walsh C.A. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1315-1325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with the previous observation that hsFLNa is essential for melanocyte migration in vitro (37Cunningham C.C. Gorlin J.B. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. Janmey P.A. Byers H.R. Stossel T.P. Science. 1992; 255: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar), suggesting that hsFLNa might be a key protein in cell migration. Similarly, hsFLNa was connected to the MAPK cascade through its associations with SEK-1 and TRAF2 (tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2) (33Marti A. Luo Z. Cunningham C. Ohta Y.

Franzoso G. Brown K. Siebenlist U. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 271-278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Taking the above examples together, the association of hsFLNa with BRCA2 suggests its involvement in BRCA2-mediated DNA damage response. BRCA2 plays important roles in DNA damage response, possibly by participating in homologous recombinational repair and/or by mediating signal transduction that affects other cellular responses to DNA damage. To evaluate whether hsFLNa is also involved in DNA damage response, we used the hsFLNa-deficient human M2 melanoma cell line and an isogenic hsFLNa-proficient derivative line, A7. M2 (hsFLNa−) cells have impaired locomotion and display circumferential blebbing of the plasma membrane. The hsFLNa expression has been restored to approximately normal level in A7 cells by stable transfection with an hsFLNa expression vector. A7 cells have restored translocational motility and reduced membrane blebbing (37Cunningham C.C. Gorlin J.B. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. Janmey P.A. Byers H.R. Stossel T.P. Science. 1992; 255: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 42Cunningham C.C. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1589-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). As confirmed in Fig. 6 A, A7 cells express hsFLNa, but M2 cells do not. Lack of hsFLNa does not affect the growth of M2 cells in culture (Fig. 6 B). A7 (hsFLNa+) and M2 (hsFLNa−) cells have similar plating efficiencies (50–70%). However, when treated with γ radiation, bleomycin, and UV-C light, M2 cells (hsFLNa−) were markedly more sensitive than A7 cells (hsFLNa+), as assessed in colony formation assays (Fig. 6, C–E). DNA double-strand break is the major damage caused by ionizing radiation, which is repaired by a variety of pathways including recombinational repair. Bleomycin is believed to generate oxygen radicals that damage DNA in a similar manner to ionizing radiation. Whereas pyrimidine dimer is the major damage caused by UV-C light, which is predominantly repaired by nucleotide excision repair. As the results shown, deletion of hsFLNa causes increased sensitivity to several distinct genotoxic agents, establishing that hsFLNa plays an essential role for cells to survive DNA damage. In summary, we have demonstrated an interaction between BRCA2 and hsFLNa by yeast two-hybrid analyses, an in vitro binding assay, and in vivo Co-IP. The interaction domains of BRCA2 and hsFLNa for this interaction have been mapped. The identified hsFLNa binding domain of BRCA2 resides in the conserved Domain IV of BRCA2 encoded by exons 14–24. This longest-conserved region of BRCA2 interacts with several other proteins as well, including DSS1 (20Marston N.J. Richards W.J. Hughes D. Bertwistle D. Marshall C.J. Ashworth A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4633-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), BCCIPα (25Liu J. Yuan Y. Huan J. Shen Z. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 336-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and hBUBR1 (22Futamura M. Arakawa H. Matsuda K. Katagiri T. Saji S. Miki Y. Nakamura Y. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1531-1535PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins are involved in a variety of cell functions, such as growth control, cell cycle regulation, and signal transduction. Therefore, Domain IV may be a particularly important region for the functions of BRCA2 in tumorigenesis. We have also found that deficiency of hsFLNa renders cells more sensitive to γ radiation, bleomycin, and UV-C light. The results suggest that the interaction between hsFLNa and BRCA2 may represent an important link between BRCA2-mediated DNA damage response and cytoskeletal signal transduction pathways.

Ohta (Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School) for generously providing the M2 and A7 melanoma cell lines, Jun Huan for an initial yeast two-hybrid analysis, Jingmei Liu for providing the BRCA2B and BRCA2F fragments, and Dr. Mark Brenneman for reviewing the manuscript."

One of the debated examples of horizontal gene transfer from animal to prokaryote is the fibronectin type III domain (FnIIID).

The structure of the domain shows significant similarity to FnIIIDs from animal proteins. Sequence comparisons with FnIIIDs from other soil bacteria proteins show that the core-forming residues are highly conserved and, thus, are under strong evolutionary pressure. Striking similarities in the tertiary structures of bacterial FnIIIDs and their mammalian counterparts may support the hypothesis that the evolution of the FnIIID in bacterial carbohydrases occurred horizontally. The total lack of surface-exposed aromatic residues also suggests that the role of this FnIIID is different from those of other bacterial β-sandwich domains, which function as carbohydrate-binding modules.

The functions of many FnIIIDs are still unclear. Each FnIIID comprises domain-intrinsic and domain-specific regions (13Bateman A. Jouet M. MacFarlane J. Du J.S. Kenwrick S. Chothia C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6050-6059Google Scholar). The former, made up of relatively conserved residues, are responsible for forming the FnIIID scaffold, which comprises a hydrogen-bond network and a hydrophobic core. The scaffold is common to all FnIIID structures and endows the domain with its the mechanical extensibility against tension and its high refolding speed (14Oberhauser A.F. Marszalek P.E. Erickson H.P. Fernandez J.M. Nature. 1998; 393: 181-185Google Scholar, 15Plaxco K.W. Spitzfaden C. Campbell I.D. Dobson C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10703-10706Google Scholar). By contrast, the domain-specific regions are formed by exposed residues that are not well conserved across the FnIIID family. These residues often form the recognition site for the FnIIID of an interacting partner protein (4Leahy D.J. Aukhil I. Erickson H.P. Cell. 1996; 84: 155-164Google Scholar, 9Main A.L. Harvey T.S. Baron M. Boyd J. Campbell I.D. Cell. 1992; 71: 671-678Google Scholar). FnIIIDs have also been found in a restricted set of carbohydrases from soil bacteria (16Watanabe T. Suzuki K. Oyanagi W. Ohnishi K. Tanaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15659-15665Google Scholar, 17Bork P. Doolittle R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8990-8994Google Scholar). It is well known that, unlike eukaryotes, bacteria acquire a significant proportion of their genetic diversity through foreign sequences from distantly related organisms (18Lawrence J.G. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 519-523Google Scholar, 19Ochman H. Lawrence J.G. Groisman E.A. Nature. 2000; 405: 299-304Google Scholar). In particular, soil bacteria are noted for their mosaic genomes that reflect extensive recombination (20Whittam T.S. Curr. Biol. 1992; 2: 676-678Google Scholar). The domains occur in different locations and in different in the carbohydrases of bacteria; in addition, the bacteria that possess FnIIIDs appear to be broadly distributed between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. As FnIIIDs appear sporadically in bacterial phylogenetic trees and have a high sequence similarity to those of animals, the presence of this domain in bacteria is regarded as the most convincing example of horizontal gene transfer from animal to prokaryote (17Bork P. Doolittle R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8990-8994Google Scholar, 21Little E. Bork P. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Evol. 1994; 39: 631-643Google Scholar). The first bacterial FnIIID to be reported was found in chitinase A1 from Bacillus circulans WL-12 (16Watanabe T. Suzuki K. Oyanagi W. Ohnishi K. Tanaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15659-15665Google Scholar), the structure of which is described in this paper. B. circulans WL-12 is a Gram-positive soil bacterium and was identified through its lysis of the cell walls of yeast and fungi. To hydrolyze chitin's β-1,4-glycosidic-linkages, this bacterium uses three enzymes, chitinase A1 (ChiA1), C1 (ChiC1), and D1 (ChiD1) (22Alam M.M. Mizutani T. Isono M. Nikaidou N. Watanabe T. J. Ferment. Bioeng. 1996; 82: 28-36Google Scholar). All three chitinases adopt multidomain structures. ChiA1 consists of an N-terminal catalytic domain, two FnIIIDs, and a C-terminal chitin-binding domain (Fig. 1); ChiD1 is made up of an N-terminal chitin binding domain, an FnIIID, and a C-terminal catalytic domain; ChiC1 comprises a catalytic domain and a C-terminal portion with no apparent sequence similarity to other known proteins. Among these, ChiA1 is known as the key enzyme of chitin degradation and exhibits the highest enzymatic activity for both insoluble and soluble chitin (23Watanabe T. Oyanagi W. Suzuki K. Tanaka H. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4017-4022Google Scholar). Except for the FnIIIDs, the tertiary structures of the domains of ChiA1 have been solved by x-ray crystallography and NMR. The crystal structure of the catalytic domain reveals an (α/β)8-TIM-barrel fold that is common to class 18 glycosyl hydrolases (24Matsumoto T. Nonaka T. Hashimoto M. Watanabe T. Mitsui Y. Proc. Jpn. Acad. 1999; 75: 269-274Google Scholar). Two exposed tryptophan residues (Trp-122 and Trp-134) of CatDChiA1 are thought to play an important role in the hydrolysis of crystalline chitin. We recently reported the solution structure of the chitin-binding domain of ChiA1 (ChBDChiA1), which can bind to chitin substrates in an insoluble or crystalline state (25Ikegami T. Okada T. Hashimoto M. Seino S. Watanabe T. Shirakawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13654-13661Google Scholar). Although the overall topology of ChBDChiA1 is similar to that of the cellulose-binding domain from a bacterial cellulase, the location of exposed hydrophobic residues that are proposed to be important for substrate binding differs between the chitin- and cellulose-binding domains, indicating a difference in the mode of substrate binding. The catalytic- and chitin-binding domains are tethered by two FnIIIDs (each comprising 86 residues). The N-terminal FnIIID (1FnIIIDChiA1; residues Ala-464 to Thr-549) and the other FnIIID (2FnIIIDChiA1; residues Ala-559 to Thr-644) are linked by a short sequence (9 residues) and share 74.4% sequence identity with each other. The highest sequence identity between 2FnIIIDChiA1 and an animal FnIIID is 34%. It has been reported that the deletion of2FnIIIDChiA1 has no impact on the chitin binding activity of ChiA1, but causes a significant decrease in the colloidal chitin hydrolyzing activity (26Watanabe T. Ito Y. Yamada T. Hashimoto M. Sekine S. Tanaka H. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4465-4472Google Scholar). The natural function of these FnIIIDs remains, however, unclear. Although there has been a rapid increase in the amount of structural and functional information on animal FnIIIDs during the past several years, the complete lack of three-dimensional structural information for bacterial FnIIIDs has obscured the evolutionary relationship of FnIIIDs. The precise structural organization of the FnIIID is crucial to our understanding of how the domain functions, as well as to the identification of evolutionary relationships. Here we report the solution structure of 2FnIIIDChiA1 solved by multidimensional NMR spectroscopy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an FnIIID structure from a bacterial protein. We also model the structure of 1FnIIIDChiA1 by using a homology modeling algorithm. These structures provide additional evidence in support of the hypothesis that the fibronectin type III domains of bacteria and animals may be related by a horizontal gene transfer process. Recombinant2FnIIIDChiA1 was obtained by expressing a His-tagged protein in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells, followed by affinity purification on a Ni2+ chelating column, cleavage with Factor Xa, and final purification by gel filtration. After cleavage with Factor Xa, vector-derived His and Met residues remain in the N terminus as His-557/Met-558-2FnIIIDChiA1. Uniform15N-labeling was achieved by growing the bacteria in M9 minimal medium containing 15NH4Cl as the sole nitrogen source; for uniform 15N- and13C-labeled samples, 13C6-glucose was used as the sole carbon source. Typical yields were 2 mg of pure protein/liter of bacterial culture. Most NMR experiments were performed with 1.0–1.5 mm2FnIIIDChiA1samples at 310 K and pH 6.5 (20 mm potassium phosphate, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm Pefabloc®) using H2O/D2O 9:1 (v/v) as the solvent. Homonuclear two-dimensional NOESY and TOCSY, and three-dimensional HCCH-TOCSY and1H-13C NOESY-HSQC spectra were obtained with samples dissolved in D2O. NMR spectra were acquired with a Bruker DMX500, DRX500, or DRX800 spectrometer equipped with a pulse-field-gradient triple resonance probe. Assignment of the1H, 15N, and 13C resonances of2FnIIIDChiA1 was obtained using two-dimensional TOCSY, NOESY, 1H-15N HSQC,1H-13C HSQC, 3D 1H-15N TOCSY-HSQC, and a series of triple-resonance experiments incorporating pulsed field gradients, water flip-back pulses, and sensitivity enhancement when amide protons were detected in the F3 dimension: CBCACOHN, CBCANH, HNCO, CCONH, HCCONH, and HCCH-TOCSY spectra (27Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer III, A.G. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy. Academic Press, San Diego1996Google Scholar). The two-dimensional NOESY (150-ms mixing time), three-dimensional1H-15N NOESY-HSQC (100- and 150-ms mixing times), and three-dimensional 1H-13C NOESY-HSQC (150-ms mixing time) spectra were also used to derive distance restraints for structure determination. To identify the hydrogen-bond pattern, a 3hJHNCO HNCO experiment was performed (28Cornilescu G. Hu J.-S. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 2949-2950Google Scholar). The data on DMX 500 and DRX 500 machines were acquired with 512*(HN) × 22*(N) × 54*(C) complex (*) points and 16 scans (CBCACONH); 512*(HN) × 22*(N) × 50*(C), 16 scans (CBCANH); 512*(HN) × 22*(N) × 105*(C), 8 scans (HNCO); 512*(HN) × 22*(N) × 64*(C), 32 scans (CCONH); 512*(HN) × 22*(N) × 40*(H), 32 scans (HCCONH); 512*(H) × 128*(H) × 30*(C), 8 scans (HCCH-TOCSY); 512*(HN) × 30*(N) × 100*(H), and 8 scans (3D 1H-15N TOCSY-HSQC). The data at DRX 800 were acquired with 1024*(HN) × 30*(N) × 35*(C), 32 scans (3hJHNCO HNCO); 1024*(HN) × 32*(N) × 135*(H), 8 scans (3D1H-15N NOESY-HSQC); 1024*(H) × 50*(C) × 128*(H), and 8 scans (3D 1H-13C NOESY-HSQC). All data were processed with the program NMRPipe (29Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Google Scholar) and analyzed with the program NMRView (30Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Google Scholar). Initially, structure calculation and NOE peak assignment were performed in an iterative and manual manner using the program DYANA (version 1.5) (31Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Google Scholar). NOE cross-peak intensities were classified as strong, medium or weak, and assigned to restraints of 1.8–3.0, 1.8–4.0, or 1.8–5.0 Å, respectively. On the base of3hJHNCO HNCO spectrum, hydrogen-bond restraints were applied as 2.5–3.3 Å for N-O pairs and 1.8–2.5 Å for HN-O pairs and used from the initial procedure. Backbone torsion angle restraints were derived from 3JHNHα of HMQC-J (27Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer III, A.G. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy. Academic Press, San Diego1996Google Scholar) and TALOS program (32Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biolmol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Google Scholar). The backbone φ angle restraints used were −65 ± 25° for 3JHNHα < 4.7 Hz, −120 ± 40° for 3JHNHα > 8.5 Hz and < 9.9 Hz, and −120 ± 20° for3JHNHα > 10.0 Hz. If the predicted TALOS φ angle was within the range of 3JHNHα, the TALOS-derived ϕ angle was used for restraints. The torsion angles χ1 of Tyr, Phe and Trp were estimated from3JC′Cγ and 3JNCγcoupling constants (33Hu J.-S. Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 1803-1804Google Scholar). Final refinement employing ambiguous NOE assignments and floating chirality assignments was performed using the program ARIA (version 1.0) and a CNS package as described (34Linge J.P. O' Donoghue S. Nilges M. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 339: 71-90Google Scholar). A total of 150 structures were refined in the last (ninth) iteration, and the 30 lowest energy structures were analyzed using MOLMOL (35Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 51-55Google Scholar), AQUA, and PROCHECK-NMR software (36Laskowski R.A. Rullmann J.A.C. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Google Scholar). The structure of1FnIIIDChiA1 was modeled using the2FnIIIDChiA1 structure as a template.1FnIIIDChiA1 shows 74.4% amino acid sequence identity with 2FnIIIDChiA1, and there are no gaps in the sequence. The MODELLER program (37Säli A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Google Scholar) was used for modeling, and the quality of the model was assessed using PROCHECK. Homologous bacterial sequences of 2FnIIIDChiA1 were obtained from the SMART (smart.embl-heidelberg.de) server (38Schultz J. Copley R.R. Doerks T. Ponting C.P. Bork P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 231-234Google Scholar). To date (July 2001), 135 bacterial FnIIIDs from 102 proteins are registered in the SMART server. Among these, we chose only FnIIIDs from the proteins whose functions are clearly identified as bacterial glycosyl hydrolases. Initially there were 83 FnIIIDs from 61 proteins. These sequences were filtered manually to get only one FnIIID sequence in the case of a protein with multiple FnIIIDs. Species redundancies were also considered. For comparison, three FnIIIDs from B. circulanswere added. Finally, 21 FnIIID sequences from 20 carbohydrases from 18 bacterial genera were used in multiple sequence alignments using ClustalW with default parameters (39Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Google Scholar). CHROMA software was used for analyzing and annotating the results from sequence alignments (40Goodstadt L. Ponting C.P. Bioinformatics. 2001; 9: 845-846Google Scholar). The sequence-specific NMR backbone assignment was obtained from CBCACONH and CBCANH spectra. Except for the signals from the vector-derived N-terminal His and Met residues, which were not observed in 1H-15N HSQC, all the backbone signals were assigned (Fig.2). Side-chain assignment was achieved using mainly CCONH, HCCONH, and HCCH-TOCSY spectra. Tyrosine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan side-chain chemical shifts were assigned from two-dimensional NOESY and TOCSY spectra. To help assignment, we used programs written in-house using the chemical shift statistics of the BioMagResBank data base (www.bmrb.wisc.edu) and the semi-automatic assignment module of NMRView. A nearly complete assignment of 2FnIIIDChiA1 was achieved. This result has been deposited in the BioMagResBank under accession no. 5178. To extract distance restraints, we used NOESY spectra with 100- and 150-ms mixing times. No severe spin diffusion effects were found in the spectrum with a 150-ms mixing time. We also measured3hJHNCO HNCO spectrum to get hydrogen-bond information directly. By comparing HNCO and3hJHNCO HNCO spectra, we identified 23 inter-hydrogen bonds between the β-strands (Fig.3). With 117 torsion angle restraints, these hydrogen-bond restraints (23*2) were applied from the initial step of structure calculation. Structure calculation with DYANA was repeated by adding distance information derived from NOE cross-peaks identified manually, until an ensemble of the calculated structures gave the global fold. When the calculated structure converged enough to identify the global fold, the ARIA procedure was employed for further refinement using ambiguous NOE cross-peaks. This procedure is essentially the same as that described previously (34Linge J.P. O' Donoghue S. Nilges M. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 339: 71-90Google Scholar).Figure 3Schematic diagram of the2FnIIIDChiA1β-sheets.

Of the 61 FnIIID-containing bacterial carbohydrases that were initially retrieved from SMART data base, 21 are from Streptomyces, and 16 are from Bacillus genera. For a comparison of FnIIIDs across genera, we selected only one FnIIID from each genus. As the sequences of FnIIIDs from the same enzyme tend to be more similar to each other than to FnIIIDs from other proteins, we also selected only one FnIIID sequence per enzyme. If all the FnIIID sequences were used in the alignment, then the apparent similarity between them and the proportion of those from Gram-positive bacteria increased.

The lengths of aligned sequences are nearly the same except for those of Erwinia chrysanthemi(PEHX_ERWCH) and O68975, which contain ∼20 more amino acids in their C′E loops in comparison with the others. A comparison of bacterial FnIIID sequences with animal FnIIID sequences indicates that the C-terminal 20 residues are more conserved in the bacterial sequences. The structure of2FnIIIDChiA1 is a canonical β-sandwich structure containing two antiparallel β-sheets that are packed face to face (Fig. 4B). One sheet is composed of three β-strands (A, B, and E), whereas the other is composed of four β-strands (C, C′, F, and G). Strand G is divided into two sections, G1 and G2, as in animal FnIIIDs. Three loops in the direction of N terminus (loops BC, C′E, and FG) and three in the direction of the C terminus (loops AB, CC′, and EF) connect the seven β-strands, respectively (Fig. 4B). The β-sandwich scaffold of 2FnIIIDChiA1 is stabilized by an extensive hydrogen-bond network between the β-strands, and by a hydrophobic core formed by inward-facing residues from the β-sheets. It is well known that animal FnIIIDs contain several β-bulge structures on the edge strands A, C′, and G. In2FnIIIDChiA1, three β-bulge structures at residues Asn-565/Leu-566 at the beginning of strand A, Thr-569/Ala-570 at middle of strand A, and Ala-601/Thr-602 within strand C′ could be unambiguously identified by the direct detection of hydrogen bonds through scalar couplings. This method naturally revealed the hydrogen-bond network that defines the strand topology, as shown in Fig. 3, demonstrating its utility. The hydrogen-bond network shows that strand G is divided into two segments, G1 and G2, as is commonly seen in animal FnIIIDs. The residues that are conserved in bacterial FnIIIDs and form the hydrophobic core are well defined in the final structures (Fig. 5). The following residues are totally buried in the core, with an solvent-accessible surface area of less than 7%: Pro-563, Ile-576, Leu-578, Trp-580, Ser-583, Tyr-592, Val-594, Ala-609, Ile-611, Phe-622, Val-624, Ala-626, Ser-637, and Val-642. The hydrophobic core is made up of two clusters in which three aromatic residues play a central role. One of the clusters contains Trp-580 and Tyr-592 surrounded by Pro-563, Ser-583, Val-594, Val-624, and Ala-626. These aromatic residues are nearly completely conserved, even in animal FnIIIDs, suggesting that this cluster is integral for maintaining the FnIIID fold. The other cluster is made up of Phe-662 surrounded by Ile-576, Leu-578, Ile-611, and Val-642. The hydrophobic properties of these residues are also highly conserved across bacterial and animal FnIIIDs (Figs. 5 and6). For animal proteins, some FnIIIDs display a variety of binding modes with other proteins using combinations of the loop regions. For example, human fibronectin binds to integrin through the RGD site on the FG loop and the PXSRN site on the C′E loop, which form interfacial surfaces (4Leahy D.J. Aukhil I. Erickson H.P. Cell. 1996; 84: 155-164Google Scholar, 9Main A.L. Harvey T.S. Baron M. Boyd J. Campbell I.D. Cell. 1992; 71: 671-678Google Scholar). The importance of the loop sequence for molecular recognition is also demonstrated by an artificially engineered FnIIID with altered sequences on the BC and FG loops that binds ubiquitin with high affinity (41Koide A. Bailey C.W. Huang X. Koide S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1141-1151Google Scholar). In bacterial FnIIIDs, the AB, EF, and FG loops are relatively well conserved in length and sequence. In contrast, the BC, CC′, and C′E loops are variable (Fig. 6). The BC loop is stabilized by a hydrogen bond between the main-chain HN group of Ser-583 on the loop and Oη of Tyr-592. In 28 of 30 final structures, this HN group and the Oη are located within 2.35 Å. This bond is also found in some animal FnIIIDs. In addition to the loop regions, some exposed residues in the β-sheets play a role in molecular recognition in some proteins. In human growth factor and human tissue factor receptor, the association of successive domains in the FnIIID-FnIIID segment creates charged surfaces around the domain boundaries, which serve as binding sites for their ligands (2de Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Google Scholar, 5Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Chene C. Winkler F.K. Guha A. Konigsberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Kirchhofer D. Nature. 1996; 380: 41-46Google Scholar). In contrast, the surface of2FnIIIDChiA1 is mostly surrounded by noncharged residues as shown in Fig. 7A.2FnIIIDChiA1 has only four negatively charged (Asp-585, Asp-593, Asp-617, and Asp-628) and three positively charged (Lys-625, Lys-627, and Lys-643) residues on the surface, which are sparsely"

Szent-Györgyi A. Studies from the Institute of Medical Chemistry University Szeged. II. S. Krager, Basel1942: 3-15Google Scholar) discovered actin as a contractile protein of skeletal muscle. He noted that actin exists in two forms (2Straub F.B. Szent-Györgyi A. Studies from the Institute of Medical Chemistry University Szeged. III. S. Krager, Basel1943: 23-28Google Scholar): monomer or globular (G) form and polymer or fibrous (F) form. The G → F transformation or polymerization of actin was catalyzed by the cations of muscle, at physiological concentration. The idea that G → F transformation of actin plays a functional role in muscle was further supported by the discovery of Straub and Feuer (3Straub F.B. Feuer G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1950; 4: 455-470Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar), that G-actin contains bound ATP (G-ATP) and F-actin contains bound ADP (F-ADP), and that during the G → F transformation of actin ATP is hydrolyzed to ADP and Pi. However, in subsequent years no evidence was obtained for a G-ATP → F-ADP + Pi transformation in skeletal muscles of live animals (4Martonosi A. Gouvea M.A. Gergely J. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 1707-1710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Mehta and Gunst (5Mehta D. Gunst S.J. J.

Physiol. 1999; 519: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) reported the presence of G-actin in smooth muscle, based on the method of DNase I inhibition and phalloidin staining, respectively. We attempted to get direct evidence for the existence of G-actin in smooth muscle. It is known that in vitro the bound ATP of G-actin exchanges with labeled ATP in the medium (7Martonosi A. Gouvea M.A. Gergely J. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 1700-1703Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Hayashi T. Tsuboi K.K. Fed. Proc. 1960; 19: 256Google Scholar, 9Strohman R.C. Samorodin A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 363-370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the bound ADP of F-actin does not exchange with either labeled ATP or ADP (7Martonosi A. Gouvea M.A. Gergely J. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 1700-1703Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When applying this information to intact muscle, one has to consider that in the ionic milieu of muscle G-actin is transformed into F-actin. Therefore, to detect a postulated G-actin intermediate the label on the G-actin must survive the hydrolysis of the bound-ATP coupled to the polymerization of actin. ATP double labeled with 32P in both the γ- and β-positions meets this requirement, G­ATP+[γ,β­32P]ATP↔G­[γ,β­32P]ATP+ATPEq. 1 G­[γ,β­32P]ATP→F­[β­32P]ADP+32PiEq. 2 These equations form the rationale of our work, which reveals a rapid exchange of the G-actin bound-ATP in intact smooth muscle. Such an exchange is very slow in skeletal muscle. Porcine carotid arteries were obtained from the local slaughterhouse from freshly killed pigs. The arteries were transported in ice-cold physiological salt solution (PSS),1 containing in mm: 130 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 1.2 MgSO4, 2.5 CaCl2, 0.03 CaEDTA, 14.9 NaHCO3, and 5.5 glucose, into the laboratory, cleaned, mounted in special chambers, and resting tension adjusted (10Bárány K. Ledvora R.F. Mougios V. Bárány M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7126-7130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The arterial muscles were regenerated by incubation in 70 ml of PSS, at 37 °C under 95% O2 and 5% CO2 for 2 h. The muscles were ∼4.5 cm long, 0.4–0.5 cm wide, and their wet weight was 0.4–0.5 g. At the end of the incubation, carrier-free inorganic [32P]orthophosphate (32Pi), 0.5–1.0 mCi, was added to the bath (containing 2 muscles) and32P labeling of the muscles was continued until the required time. 32Pi was removed from the extracellular space of the muscle by quick washings with PSS 15 times, each washing with 70 ml of PSS. Then the muscle was blotted gently, cut in the middle, one half was frozen in liquid nitrogen while the other half was dropped into 50% ethanol of 0 °C. Smooth muscles from pregnant uteri (rat and pig), urinary bladder (rabbit and pig), and stomach (rat and pig) were prepared as described (11Bárány M. Bárány K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and labeled with 32Pi by the same procedure as used for the arterial smooth muscle. After the 2-h recovery incubation, the PSS was exchanged for 70 ml of contracting solution containing either 0.1 mm histamine or a K+-stimulating solution (in mm: 35 NaCl, 100 KCl, 1.2 MgSO4, 2.5 CaCl2, 0.03 CaEDTA, 14.9 NaHCO3, and 5.5 glucose), and the muscle was allowed to develop tension for 10 min. Then the bath was exchanged for32Pi containing contracting solution and32P labeling was allowed to proceed for 20 min (cf. Fig. 5). The muscles were washed with 70 ml of contracting solution 15 times, then cut and fixed in liquid nitrogen or 50% ethanol solution. The frozen muscle was pulverized (10Bárány K. Ledvora R.F. Mougios V. Bárány M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7126-7130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the powder from 4 half-muscles was extracted with 25 ml of 1.5% PCA in an ice bath for 2 min. After a brief high-speed centrifugation, 0.5-ml aliquots, in duplicate, were taken from the supernatant for determination of the specific radioactivity of phosphocreatine (PCr) (12Kopp S.J. Bárány M. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 12007-12012Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), whereas the remainder of the extract was poured into an equivalent 10.0 n KOH solution to neutralize it to pH 7.5–8.0. After overnight standing in ice, the perchlorate precipitate was removed by centrifugation; the supernatant was concentrated by the SpeedVac and used for Dowex-1 chromatography. In the ethanol procedure, each 4 half-muscle was extracted with 40 ml of 50% ethanol in ice overnight. The next morning the muscles were cut with scissors, each half into 3 pieces, and extracted four more times, each extraction with 40 ml of 50% ethanol in ice bath with stirring for 1 h. The absorbance and radioactivity of each extract was followed; after the five extractions the absorbance and the radioactivity were essentially zero. Subsequently, the 4 half-muscle residues were extracted twice, with 25 ml of 1.5% PCA each time, in ice bath for 1 h. The absorbance and the radioactivity of each extract were recorded. The first PCA extract was neutralized with 10n KOH solution and prepared for Dowex-1 chromatography, as described before. The resin, AG-1 X8 200–400 mesh (Bio-Rad) in the chloride form, was recycled twice, with 1.0n NaOH and 1.0 n HCl, so that no UV absorbing material was eluted from the washed resin. The sample was dissolved in 1 ml of cold distilled water and clarified by high-speed centrifugation. The sample, containing 10–15 A260 units, was loaded slowly onto the column (5.5 × 1 cm), and eluted stepwise with 40 ml of 0.01 n HCl (elutes nucleosides, PCr, AMP, and other nucleotide monophosphates), 55 ml of 0.025 nHCl (elutes inorganic phosphate, ADP, and other nucleotide diphosphates), and 45 ml of 0.12 n HCl (elutes ATP and other nucleotide triphosphates) (modified from Ref. 13Pullman M.E. Eastabrook R.W. Pullman M.E. Methods in Enzymology, vol X, Oxidation and Phosphorylation. Academic Press, New York1967: 57-60Google Scholar). The flow rate was 0.75 ml per min, 3.0-ml fractions were collected and the absorbance was recorded at 260 and 280 nm. Since in the muscle adenine nucleotides are predominant, the column actually separates AMP, ADP, ATP, and Pi (Fig. 1). In addition to these compounds, the column also separates PCr. After the last extraction, the muscle residue in 1.5% PCA was stirred with 20 ml of 0.1n NaOH at room temperature for a day. By this procedure, all muscle proteins are solubilized with the exception of connective tissue proteins, mainly collagen (14Lilienthal Jr., J.L. Zierler K.L. Folk B.P. Buka R. Riley M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1950; 182: 501-508Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The noncollageneous proteins in the supernatant were quantified by the modified biuret procedure (15Bárány M. Bárány K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1959; 35: 293-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and converted in terms of gram muscle using the factor of 105.11 mg of protein/1 g wet weight of arterial muscle. This factor was determined by extracting known weight of arteries with 0.1 n NaOH under the same conditions. The 32Pi, added into the bath of the muscle, permeates into the intracellular water and condenses with ADP (produced by the basal metabolism), to synthesize [γ-32P]ATP, [P32Pi]+ADP→[γ­32P]ATPEq. 3 ADP is also produced through the creatine kinase catalyzed reaction, [γ­32P]ATP+Cr↔[32P]PCr+ADPEq. 4 This reaction is very fast and under all conditions the measured specific radioactivity of [γ-32P]ATP was equal to that of [32P]PCr. The ATP labeled at the γ-position is also labeled at the β-position, through the reaction catalyzed by the adenylate kinase, [γ­32P]ATP+AMP↔[β­32P]ADP+ADPEq. 5 2[β­32P]ADP↔[γ,β­32P]ATP+AMPEq. 6 and through the regular ATP synthesis, [P32Pi]+[β­32P]ADP→[γ,β­32P]ATPEq. 7 Labeling of ATP both at the γ- and β-positions is somewhat slower than labeling at the γ-position alone. We found complete double labeling after 2 h of incubation of the muscle with32Pi. Double labeling of ATP was evidenced by the ratio of 2.0 for the specific radioactivity of [γ,β-32P]ATP over the specific radioactivity of [32P]PCr. Under the conditions used here, the labeling of the α-phosphate of ATP was very slow. We have found 5–8% labeling in muscles incubated with 32Pi at 37 °C for 5 h. Labeling of α-phosphate of ATP was evidenced by isolating [32P] AMP with the Dowex-1 chromatography. Because in the intact muscle actin appears in the F-form with ADP as its bound nucleotide, the specific radioactivity of the β-phosphate of the cytoplasmic ATP is the reference for the exchange of the actin-bound ADP. Since shorter incubation of arterial muscle with 32Pi labels only the γ- and β-phosphates of ATP, the specific activity of the β-phosphate of the cytoplasmic ATP can be calculated from the specific activity of the double labeled ATP minus the specific radioactivity of [32P]PCr, namely the specific radioactivity of [32P]PCr equals that of the γ-phosphate of ATP (12Kopp S.J. Bárány M. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 12007-12012Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Thus, S.A.ofβ­phosphate of ATP=S.A.of[γ,β­32P]ATP−S.A.of[32P]PCrEq. 8 and the exchange of the actin-bound ADP is expressed as, Percentage exchange(ADP)=(S.A.of actin­bound ADP/S.A.ofβ­P of cytoplasmic ATP)×100Eq. 9 The specific radioactivity of ATP and ADP was calculated from the counts/min values of the top five fractions of their peaks in the Dowex-1 chromatograms (cf. Figs. 1 and 3) and the absorbance of these fractions at 260 nm, using a molar absorption coefficient of 14.2 × 103 for adenine nucleotides at acidic pH (16Cohn W.E. Colowick S.P. Kaplan N.O. Methods in Enzymology. III. Academic Press, New York1957: 724-743Google Scholar). As will be shown, the actin-bound phosphate also exchanges and the specific radioactivity of [32P]PCr is the reference for this exchange. Thus, the exchange of the actin bound [32Pi] is expressed as, Percentage exchange(Pi)=(S.A.of actin­bound Pi/S.A.of PCr)×100Eq. 10 The specific radioactivity of actin-bound Pi was calculated from the counts/min values of the top three fractions of its peaks in the Dowex-1 chromatograms (cf. Fig. 3) and the absorbance of the phosphomolybdate complex at 720 nm, determined according to Rockstein and Herron (17Rockstein M. Herron P.W. Anal. Chem. 1951; 23: 1500-1501Crossref Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Actin was prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle (15Bárány M. Bárány K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1959; 35: 293-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), polymerized with 0.1 m NaCl, and purified by ultracentrifugation at 105,000 × g for 3 h (modified from Ref. 18Mommaerts W.F.H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 188: 559-565Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The F-actin pellet was rinsed with distilled water twice, to remove salts, and dissolved by a Teflon-glass homogenizer in 0.4 mm ATP, pH 7.5, 10–12 mg of protein/ml, 0 °C. (By measuring the protein concentration of the actin solution before ultracentrifugation and of the supernatant after ultracentrifugation the protein content of the F-actin pellet could be estimated.) Upon prolonged homogenization (50–70 strokes) the actin was completely depolymerized and when centrifuged at 144,000 ×g for 1 h only a small sediment (presumably F-actin) appeared. When the concentrated G-actin was treated with 20 mg of AG 1-X8 200–400 mesh resin per ml of actin solution, 4 °C, for 5 min to remove unbound ATP, the G-actin polymerized. For this reason, no resin treatment was performed. The G-actin solution was divided into two parts, 1/10th volume of 1.0 m NaCl and 0.01m MgCl2 solution was added to one part to form F-actin, while the other part remained G-actin. After the preparation of G-actin and F-actin, the experiments started immediately and all treatments were carried out in an ice bath. Data were expressed as mean ± S.E. Radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting.32Pi was obtained from ICN. Verhoeven et al. (19Verhoeven A.J.M. Cook C.A. Holmsen H. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 174: 672-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) separated the free and actin-bound nucleotides of platelets in 56% ethanol containing 6.7 mm EDTA. Applying their procedure to arterial smooth muscle, we have found no need for EDTA and reduced the ethanol concentration to 50% to increase the solubility of nucleotides and inorganic salts of muscle in the aqueous ethanol. Fig. 2 shows the extraction of nucleotides and radioactivity from 32P-labeled arterial muscles upon treatments with 50% ethanol and subsequently with 1.5% PCA. In the first extract 46.1% of the total nucleotide absorbance at 260 nm and 58.8% of the total counts were solubilized. In the second extract these numbers decreased to 10.5 and 12.2%, respectively, and in the third extract they decreased to 3.0 and 3.6%, respectively. The remaining percentage absorbance was 0.5 in the fourth extract and zero in the fifth and sixth extracts; small amounts of counts were observable in these extracts, approaching the zero level. At this stage, the solvent was changed to 1.5% PCA; this resulted in the appearance of 30% of the total absorbance and 19.2% of the total counts, whereas the second PCA extraction yielded 9.9% of the absorbance and 4% of the counts. Accordingly, PCA extracted from the ethanol-washed muscle about 40% of the total absorbance at 260 nm and about 23% of the total counts. As will be described, this absorbance and counts belong to the actin-bound nucleotide and phosphate in the muscle. In comparing the percentage absorbance with the percentage counts extracted, it should be noted that all the absorbance refers to nucleotides, but the counts include compounds, which do not absorb in the U.V., e.g. the intermediates of glycolysis. Straub (1Straub F.B. Szent-Györgyi A. Studies from the Institute of Medical Chemistry University Szeged. II. S. Krager, Basel1942: 3-15Google Scholar) observed that actin could be precipitated with ethanol without loss of activity. In our experiments, 50% ethanol did not precipitate G-actin or F-actin, and after the ethanol was removed G-actin solutions retained their ability to polymerize and F-actin solutions remained viscous. In our attempt to measure the effect of 50% ethanol on the bound nucleotide content of actin, we rediscovered (7Martonosi A. Gouvea M.A. Gergely J. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 1700-1703Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that ATP does not permeate through standard dialysis membranes. Subsequently, the following protocol was used for studying the stability of the actin-bound nucleotide in 50% ethanol. To purified G-actin or F-actin, 10.5–11.5 mg/ml, in an ice bath, equal volume of cold absolute ethanol was added in small increments. The solutions were kept in the ice bath for 1 day. Control G-actin and F-actin solutions were prepared by adding an equal volume of cold distilled water to the actin solutions. Aliquots, 1 ml, were removed at time intervals of 3, 6, 12, and 24 h from the ethanol treated and control actin solutions and dialyzed against 15 liters of distilled water (G-actin) or 15 liters of 0.1 m NaCl and 1 mm MgCl2 solution (F-actin) in the cold room for 1 h. After the dialysis, the ethanol content of the treated samples was measured with alcohol dehydrogenase (Sigma ethanol diagnostic test) and it was reduced from the original 50% ethanol to less than 0.5% ethanol. To quantify their nucleotide content, the G-actin solutions were polymerized by the addition of 1/10th volume of 1.0 m NaCl and 0.01 m MgCl2solution and subjected to ultracentrifugation, along with the dialyzed F-actin samples, at 144,000 × g for 1 h. Virtually all the actin protein, 91–97%, was sedimented under these conditions. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was rinsed with distilled water; the pellet was dissolved by homogenization in 3.0 ml of 0.2 n NaOH, then the proteins precipitated with excess perchloric acid. After centrifugation, the absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 260 and 280 nm, the pellet was dissolved in 1.0 ml of 1.0 n NaOH and its protein content measured by the biuret method. The bound nucleotide content of the 50% ethanol-treated G-actin or F-actin did not differ from that of the untreated G-actin or F-actin. Furthermore, the bound nucleotide content did not decrease as a function of time during the 1-day incubation. The bound nucleotide content was in the range of 0.8–0.9 μmol of nucleotide per 42 mg of protein (n = 3). These results show that purified G-actin and F-actin retained their bound nucleotide during 1-day treatment with 50% ethanol. Fig.3 shows the Dowex-1 chromatography profile of actin-bound nucleotide, isolated from arterial muscle by ethanol treatment. There are two nucleotides present, ADP and ATP with an approximate ratio of 7 to 1. There are three radioactive peaks; the first comes from Pi, the second from ADP, and the third from ATP. (As described in the next paragraph, the Pi peak represents the actin-bound phosphate.) The specific radioactivity, in terms of cpm/μmol, was: 9.53 ± 0. 21 × 106for Pi, 9.76 ± 0.75 × 106 for ADP, and 20.10 ± 1.79 × 106 for ATP. The specific radioactivity of the cytoplasmic ATP, from the same muscle, was 19.85 ± 0.63 × 106, and that of PCr was 10.01 × 106. From the last two data, using Equation8, the specific radioactivity of β-phosphate of ATP was calculated to be 9.84 × 106 cpm/μmol. By comparing the specific radioactivity of actin-bound ADP with that of the β-phosphate of cytoplasmic ATP, and comparing the specific radioactivity of actin-bound ATP with that of the cytoplasmic ATP, it is evident that the actin-bound nucleotide was completely exchanged with the [γ,β-32P]ATP in the intracellular water. The data also show that during the 2-h incubation of the muscle with32Pi the specific radioactivity of β-phosphate of the cytoplasmic ATP reached the specific radioactivity of its γ-phosphate. Furthermore, the specific radioactivity of the actin-bound phosphate reached the specific radioactivity of PCr. The following data suggest the existence of actin-bound phosphate. The first 50% ethanol extract of arterial muscle (Fig. 2) is loaded with 32Pi, due to the complete hydrolysis of cytoplasmic [γ,β-32P]ATP. (This was shown by Dowex-1 chromatography.) Through the successive ethanol extractions, the32Pi is removed from the muscle completely (Fig. 2). However, when the residue is extracted with PCA the32Pi reappears (Fig. 3). In muscles incubated with 32Pi for a short time, the specific radioactivity of the actin-bound Pidiffered greatly from that of the actin-bound ADP. For instance, with 20 min incubation the specific radioactivity of actin-bound [32P]ADP was 1.87 × 106 cpm/μmol, the specific radioactivity of the actin-bound [32P]Pi was 5.01 × 106cpm/μmol, and the specific radioactivity of [32P]PCr was 5.79 × 106 cpm/μmol. Thus, the actin-bound Pi resembled PCr and not actin-bound ADP. Since the specific radioactivity of [32P]PCr equals that of [γ-32P]ATP, it appears that the [32P]Pi is liberated from the terminal phosphate of [γ,β-32P]ATP during the polymerization of actin (Equation 2). The concentration of the actin-bound Pi was 60–85% of that of the actin-bound ADP. In vitro studies showed that the actin-bound Pi dissociates slowly, whereas the actin-bound ADP does not dissociate in practical terms (21Carlier M.-F. Pantaloni D. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7789-7792Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 22Korn E.D. Carlier M.-F. Pantaloni D. Science. 1987; 238: 638-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 23Carlier M.-F. Pantaloni D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the reduced phosphate content of actin in the muscle, relative to its ADP content, can be explained by the slow dissociation of the phosphate from actin during the prolonged 50% ethanol washing of the arterial muscle. From the absorbance of the PCA extract and the protein content of the PCA residue, we calculated 1.11 ± 0.10 μmol of nucleotide/g of wet muscle weight (n = 35). All this nucleotide was fully exchanged when resting muscle was incubated with32Pi for 45–60 min. With a molecular mass of 42,000 daltons (20Hartshorne D.J. Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract, Second Edition. Raven Press, New York1987: 423-482Google Scholar), the actin content was 46.6 mg/g muscle in good agreement with the reported actin content of carotid arteries, 48.5 mg/g (20Hartshorne D.J. Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract, Second Edition. Raven Press, New York1987: 423-482Google Scholar). ADP comprised 85–88% of the bound nucleotide, while ATP amounted to 12–15%. Fig.4 shows the percentage exchange as a function of time for porcine carotid arterial smooth muscle and rat skeletal muscle. In the case of the smooth muscle, no reasonable measurements could be performed in the first 15 min of the32Pi incubation. During this period the32Pi permeates into the cytoplasm (a slow process), followed by the synthesis of 32P-labeled ATP, and only then can an exchange of the actin-bound ADP take place. At the 15-min incubation the exchange was 53%, raising to 81% at 20 min, and 95% at 30 min. Subsequently, the exchange remained at 100% level up to 3 h of incubation. In contrast to the rapid exchange in smooth muscle, the exchange in rat skeletal muscles was very slow. The exchange was followed in hourly intervals and reached about 15% after 3 h of incubation. Not shown are results with frog leg skeletal muscles, incubated at 25 °C (at 37 °C frog muscles denature) that also exhibited a slow exchange. These data are in good agreement with the results of Martonosi et al. (4Martonosi A. Gouvea M.A. Gergely J. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 1707-1710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) who discovered the slow exchange of the actin-bound nucleotide in skeletal muscles of live rabbits, rats, and pigeons. Two types of contracting solutions were used, 0.1 mm histamine and 100 mm K+, both elicited maximal force. Fig. 5 shows the experimental protocol. After adjusting the resting tension at 0 min, the PSS in the bath was exchanged for a solution containing 0.1 mm histamine in PSS, maximal force of the arterial muscle was reached in 10 min. The bath was exchanged for a solution containing32Pi in 0.1 mm histamine-PSS and32P labeling of the muscle was allowed for 20 min, then the muscle was washed 15 times with 0.1 mm histamine/PSS for a total time of 15 min. Note, the force remained maximal both during the labeling and subsequent washings. Table I compares the percentage exchange of actin-bound ADP and Pi, during 20 min, in 15 resting and contracting muscles (11 were contracted with 0.1 mmhistamine and 4 were contracted with 100 mmK+). The percentage exchange in resting muscle reached 81% for ADP and 80% for Pi, whereas in contracting muscle the exchange amounted to 59 and 57%, respectively. The difference in the exchangeability, between resting and contracting muscles, is apparently due to the interaction of actin with myosin that alters the rate of exchange. The 22–23% decrease in the exchangeability is in agreement with the data of Mehta and Gunst (5Mehta D. Gunst S.J. J. Physiol. 1999; 519: 829-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) which showed a 30% decrease in the G-actin content of stimulated canine tracheal musclesversus the unstimulated muscles.Table IExchange of actin-bound ADP and Pi in resting and contracting arterial musclesMusclePercentage exchangenADPPiResting81 ± 680 ± 515Contracting59 ± 757 ± 715Muscles were incubated in 70 ml of PSS, at 37 °C, for 2 h. Resting muscles were incubated with 32Pi (0.5 mCi per muscle) for 20 min, then quickly washed with PSS 15 times, each wash with 70 ml of PSS. Muscles were contracted either with 70 ml of 0.1 mm histamine in PSS or 100 mm KCl in the modified PSS for 10 min, then incubated with the contracting solution containing 0.5 mCi of 32Pi per muscle for 20 min, and quickly washed with 70 ml of the contracting solution 15 times. The workup of the muscles is described under “Experimental Procedures.” The percentage exchange for ADP and Pi was calculated with Equations 9 and 10, respectively. Open table in a new tab Muscles were incubated in 70 ml of PSS, at 37 °C, for 2 h. Resting muscles were incubated with 32Pi (0.5 mCi per muscle) for 20 min, then quickly washed with PSS 15 times, each wash with 70 ml of PSS. Muscles were contracted either with 70 ml of 0.1 mm histamine in PSS or 100 mm KCl in the modified PSS for 10 min, then incubated with the contracting solution containing 0.5 mCi of 32Pi per muscle for 20 min, and quickly washed with 70 ml of the contracting solution 15 times. The workup of the muscles is described under “Experimental Procedures.” The percentage exchange for ADP and Pi was calculated with Equations 9 and 10, respectively. The decrease in the exchangeability of the actin-bound ADP and Pi was found to be reversible. Muscles contracted with the 100 mm K+ solution were completely relaxed by repeated washings with PSS; the percentage exchange of both ADP and Pi in the relaxed muscle increased to 82% from its 58% value in the contracted muscle. If there is no ATP in the arterial muscle the actin-bound ADP does not exchange. This was demonstrated: 1) by incubating the muscles with 10 mm sodium azide and 50 μm iodoacetate in PSS at 37 °C for 2 h, and subsequently with 32Pi in PSS for 2 h. No ATP was found in the muscles, although they did contain32Pi. There was no radioactivity incorporated into the actin-bound ADP and Pi, indicating that32Pi alone in the cytoplasm is not enough for the exchange reaction to take place. 2) By using iodoacetamide treatment, after 2 h incubation in PSS, the muscles were incubated with 10 mm iodoacetamide in PSS for 90 min, followed by incubation with 32Pi in 10 mmiodoacetamide/PSS for 1 h. The [γ,β-32P]ATP content of the muscles was virtually zero, and there was no32P incorporation into the actin-bound ADP. 3) Substituting glucose with 2-deoxyglucose in PSS decreased the [γ,β-32P]ATP content of the muscles to 25% of the control muscles (24Barron J.T. Bárány K. Bárány M. Kopp S, J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1010: 278-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and the percentage exchange of the actin-bound ADP was decreased to 20%. These data show that when ATP synthesis is inhibited the exchange of the bound-ADP is also inhibited. It should be noted, that the actin-bound ADP was hardly affected in the poisoned muscles although the cytoplasmic ATP was degraded to AMP and IMP. Thus, in the three cases described before the bound nucleotide content was 0.88, 0.91, and 1.05 μmol of nucleotide/g of wet muscle weight. This proves the idea that the bound-ADP is not available to cytoplasmic enzymes, which participate in ATP turnover in muscle (3Straub F.B. Feuer G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1950; 4: 455-470Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Arterial muscles were incubated in Ca2+-free PSS, which contained in addition 1.0 mm EGTA, for 2 h and then with32Pi in Ca2+-free PSS and EGTA for 45 min. The labeled muscles were washed with Ca2+-free PSS and EGTA 7 times and with PSS 8 times. The actin-bound ADP and Pi were fully exchanged in such muscles, the same way as they exchanged in control muscles treated with normal PSS for the same time. Two major nucleotide peaks appeared on the Dowex-1 chromatography of the PCA extract from32P-labeled arterial muscle (Fig. 1), the first corresponded to ADP and the second to ATP. Because of the total ADP in PCA extract of smooth muscle (or any other muscle) is essentially the actin-bound ADP (25Kopp S.J. Barron J.T. Tow J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1055: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 26Dillon P.P. Bárány M. Biochemistry of Smooth Muscle Contraction. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1996: 393-404Crossref Google Scholar), from results of this Dowex-1 chromatography the percentage exchange of actin-bound ADP could be calculated. Thus, from the specific activities of cytoplasmic ATP, PCr, and actin-bound ADP, using Equations 8 and 9, the percentage exchange of the actin-bound ADP was found to be 94%. A similar value, 99%, was obtained for the other half of the same muscle, which was analyzed by the ethanol procedure. Table IIcompares the exchange of actin-bound ADP and Pi in arterial muscle with those of muscles from rat and porcine uterus (pregnant), from rabbit and porcine urinary bladder, and from rat and porcine stomach. The overall data show a complete or nearly complete exchange in each of these smooth muscles. The somewhat larger standard error for stomach and bladder muscles reflects the difficulties in preparing pure smooth muscle from these tissues in larger quantities.Table IIExchange of actin-bound ADP and Pi in various smooth musclesMusclePercentage exchangenADPPiCarotid artery, porcine102 ± 399 ± 53Uterus, pregnant, rat98 ± 999 ± 73Uterus, pregnant, porcine94 ± 896 ± 93Urinary bladder, rabbit89 ± 1287 ± 113Urinary bladder, porcine91 ± 1586 ± 103Stomach, rat71 ± 1672 ± 183Stomach, porcine76 ± 1979 ± 143Muscles were incubated in 70 ml of PSS, at 37 °C, for 2 h, followed by incubation in 32Pi-PSS for 1 h, then washed with 70 ml of PSS 15 times.

We confirm and extend the finding of Mehta and Gunst (5Mehta D. Gunst S.J. J. Physiol. 1999; 519: 829-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and Joneset al. (6Jones K.A. Perkins W.J. Lorenz R.R. Prakash Y.S. Sieck G.C. Warner D.O. J. Physiol. 1999; 519: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) on the existence of G-actin in smooth muscle. With 32P labeling we show that all actin molecules in porcine carotid artery readily exchange their bound ADP and Pi. Because of the tight coupling between actin-bound nucleotide and actin polymerization (3Straub F.B. Feuer G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1950; 4: 455-470Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar), the observed exchange reflects a polymerization-depolymerization-repolymerization cycle of actin. Applying the 32P method to uterine, urinary bladder, and stomach smooth muscles from various sources, we find a similar exchange of the actin-bound ADP and Pi. Under the same conditions, rat and frog skeletal muscles show only a small exchange. These data when combined with those of Mehta and Gunst (5Mehta D. Gunst S.J. J. Physiol. 1999; 519: 829-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and Jones et al. (6Jones K.A. Perkins W.J. Lorenz R.R. Prakash Y.S. Sieck G.C. Warner D.O. J. Physiol. 1999; 519: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) obtained on canine tracheal smooth muscle, suggest that the reversible polymerization of actin is a basic property of every smooth muscle. The present study establishes a new procedure for the separation of cytoplasmic nucleotides from actin-bound nucleotides at the level of intact smooth muscle using 50% ethanol. At this ethanol concentration, the muscle is readily permeabilized at 0 °C and thus releases all its free organic and inorganic constituents, while actin remains in its native state and thereby keeps its bound nucleotide. Purified G-actin and F-actin also retain their bound nucleotide upon prolonged ethanol treatment. On the other hand, myosin is irreversibly denatured even with 20% ethanol in muscle extract (27Szent-Györgyi A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 192: 361-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thus it seems unlikely that at the 50% ethanol concentration used in this work any nucleotide would have remained bound to myosin. Furthermore, smooth muscle contains only 100 nmol of myosin heavy chain (20Hartshorne D.J. Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract, Second Edition. Raven Press, New York1987: 423-482Google Scholar), as compared with 1,100 nmol of actin; therefore, myosin cannot be responsible for the exchange of 1,100 nmol of bound nucleotides, demonstrated in this study. The results of this work confirm the generally accepted view that actin is in the F-form in intact muscle, because liquid nitrogen frozen and subsequently PCA extracted arterial muscle yields ADP as the actin-bound nucleotide. The rapid equilibration of F-ADP with the cytoplasmic ATP in smooth muscle can be explained by the following, F­ADP+[γ,β­32P]ATP→G­[γ,β­32P]ATP+ADPEq. 11 G­[γ,β­32P]ATP→F­[β­32P]ADP+32PiEq. 12 The isolation of the G-[γ,β-32P]ATP intermediate from 32Pi-labeled smooth muscle (Fig. 3) supports this mechanism of the exchange. The scheme does not involve the two distinct steps found in vitro during the hydrolysis of ATP associated with actin polymerization (21Carlier M.-F. Pantaloni D. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7789-7792Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), namely the F-ATP and F-ADP·Pi intermediates. However, our data reveal the existence of F-[β-32P]ADP. [32Pi] intermediate in the muscle (Fig.3). These data indicate the dynamic state of actin in smooth muscle. They also support the suggestion of Mehta and Gunst (5Mehta D. Gunst S.J. J. Physiol. 1999; 519: 829-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) that contractile activation of smooth muscle is associated with enhanced polymerization of actin, a basic requirement for force generation in muscle. Furthermore, the data suggest that reversible polymerization of actin is part of the contraction-relaxation cycle of smooth muscle. Since smooth muscle contains over 1 μmol of actin per g, the reversible polymerization of actin coupled to ATP hydrolysis, followed by ATP resynthesis, has a considerable energy requirement. All evidence suggests that the actin protein itself generates the energy through the “mechanochemistry” of actin (3Straub F.B. Feuer G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1950; 4: 455-470Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Since the actin-bound nucleotide is not available for enzymes involved in ATP turnover, the transformation of the actin polymer to actin monomer may provide the energy for ATP synthesis (3Straub F.B. Feuer G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1950; 4: 455-470Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar). It seems likely that actin-binding proteins are controlling the actin dynamics in smooth muscle, well established in nonmuscle cells (28Pollard T.D. Blanchoin L. Mullins R.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 545-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar,29Pantaloni D. Clainche C.L. Carlier M.-F. Science. 2001; 292: 1502-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). The role of profilin, thymosin β4, in the control of actin nucleotide exchange has been described in vitro (30Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Furman M.I. Wachstock D. Safer D. Nachmias V.T. Pollard T.D.

Biol. 1999; 15: 185-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar), the Arp2/3 complex (33Welch M.D. DePace A.H. Verma S. Iwamatsu A. Mitchison T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 375-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), or leiomodin and tropomodulin (34Conley C.A. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 280: C1645-C1656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), may be regulators of actin filament assembly in animal cells including smooth muscle (34Conley C.A. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 280: C1645-C1656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Smooth muscle, unlike skeletal or cardiac muscle, contains a large excess of actin over myosin. The physiological role of this actin surplus is not known. Recent trends in smooth muscle research point to a functional role of the cytoskeleton, the main component of which is actin (35Morgan K.G. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 280: C1634-C1635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of 32P incorporation into the actin-bound nucleotide and phosphate in intact live muscle may help to find the role of actin in cytoskeleton function.

In addition to supporting rolling and stable arrest of leukocytes, there is increasing evidence that E-selectin functions in transmembrane signaling into endothelial cells during these adhesive interactions. We have previously shown that adhesion of HL-60 cells (which express ligands for E-selectin), or antibody-mediated cross-linking of E-selectin, results in formation of a Ras/Raf-1/phospho-MEK macrocomplex, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK1/2) activation, and c-fos up-regulation.

Here we demonstrate that tyrosine 603 in the cytoplasmic domain of E-selectin is required for the E-selectin-dependent ERK1/2 activation.

In addition to supporting the rolling and stable arrest of leukocytes on activated endothelium, there is increasing evidence that E-selectin can transduce outside-in signals (4Lorenzon P. Vecile E.

Recently our laboratory demonstrated that leukocyte adhesion to cell surface E-selectin-activated extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK1/2), formed a macrocomplex containing Ras/Raf-1/phospho-MEK, and resulted in the up-regulation of c-fos expression (7Hu Y. Kiely J.M. Szente B.E. Rosenzweig A. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2142-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In this study, we have investigated the molecular events occurring immediately upstream of Ras/Raf/phospho-MEK and downstream of cell surface E-selectin.The cytoplasmic domain of E-selectin has been implicated in transmembrane signaling (5Yoshida M. Westlin W.F. Wang N. Ingber D.E. Rosenzweig A. Resnick N. Gimbrone M.A.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 445-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 7Hu Y. Kiely J.M. Szente B.E. Rosenzweig A. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2142-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar); however, the molecular mechanisms involved have not been well defined. The cytoplasmic domain of E-selectin consists of 32 amino acids (1Bevilacqua M.P. Stengelin S. Gimbrone M.A.J. Seed B. Science. 1989; 243: 1160-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar), including two tyrosine residues. It has been well documented that phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domains of various types of receptors can play an important role in receptor-mediated transmembrane signal transduction, especially ERK1/2 activation. Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the two tyrosine residues on the cytoplasmic domain of E-selectin may be involved in the E-selectin-dependent ERK1/2 activation described by our laboratory (7Hu Y. Kiely J.M. Szente B.E. Rosenzweig A. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. J.

Semin. Cell Biol. 1993; 4: 419-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). SHP2 associates with tyrosine-phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor, the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (9Case R.D. Piccione E. Wolf G. Benett A.M. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G.

Moreover, SHP2 has been show to have a positive effect on ERK1/2 signaling pathway (15Oh E.S. Gu H. Saxton T.M. Timms J.F. Hausdorff S. Frevert E.U. Kahn B.B. Pawson T. Neel B.G. Thomas S.M. Mol.

These include tyrosine phosphorylation of E-selectin, association with SHP2, and assembly of the adapter proteins, Shc, Grb2, and Sos, to form a signaling complex, which then bridges SHP2 to the Ras·Raf-1·phospho-MEK macrocomplex, resulting in ERK1/2 activation.DISCUSSIONThere is ample evidence that transmembrane adhesion molecules can both physically bridge and biochemically transduce signals among interacting cells. The selectins, a family of adhesion molecules involved in leukocyte adhesion to activated vascular endothelium, are no exception. Binding to L-selectin has been shown to generate both inside-out and outside-in signals, such as the activation of the Ras pathway and potentiation of the oxidative burst of human neutrophils (20Brenner B.

P-selectin also has been shown to transduce signals across the plasma membrane, resulting in the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase and transient increases in intracellular Ca2+ (4Lorenzon P.

Our laboratory has demonstrated that adhesion of HL-60 cells, which expresses ligands for E-selectin, or monoclonal antibody (mAb)-mediated cell surface E-selectin cross-linking, can induce cytoskeletal linkage of E-selectin (5Yoshida M. Westlin W.F. Wang N. Ingber D.E. Rosenzweig A. Resnick N. Gimbrone M.A.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 445-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), dephosphorylation of serine residues in the cytoplasmic domain of E-selectin (6Yoshida M. Szente B.E. Kiely J.M. Rosenzweig A. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 933-941PubMed Google Scholar), and activation of ERK1/2, as well as the formation of a Ras·Raf·MEK macrocomplex (7Hu Y. Kiely J.M. Szente B.E. Rosenzweig A. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2142-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).In this study, we used E-selectin single-point mutants to demonstrate that one tyrosine residue, Tyr603, in the cytoplasmic domain of E-selectin plays an essential role in the association between E-selectin and SHP2, and in mediating the ERK1/2 activation induced by cross-linking cell surface E-selectin. A consensus sequence for SHP2 binding, Y(I/V)X (V/I/L/P), has been defined in several proteins, such as platelet-derived growth factor β-receptor and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule)-1 (33Ronnstrand L. Arvidsson A.K. Kallin A. Rorsman C. Hellman U. Engstrom U. Wernstedt C. Heldin C.H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3696-3702Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 34Masuda M. Osawa M. Shigematsu H. Harada N. Fujiwara K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domain of E-selectin does contain similar motifs around the Tyr603 (YQKP) and Tyr608 (YIL) residues. Upon cross-linking of cell surface E-selectin, SHP2 becomes associated with E-selectin in a time-dependent (Fig. 1 B) and dose-dependent (data not shown) manner; however, only Tyr603 appeared to play an essential role in this association. Furthermore, Tyr603 plays an important role in E-selectin-dependent ERK1/2 activation (Fig. 2). Although the basal level of the association between SHP2 and E-selectin mutated at Tyr608 appears to be slightly higher than the wild-type E-selectin (Fig. 1 C), this increased association does not result in any E-selectin-dependent ERK1/2 activation (Fig.2), suggesting a nonspecific effect. Cross-linking another endothelial cell surface heterodimer, the HLA class I molecule, which is present at comparable density on the surface of IL-1β-activated HUVEC, did not generate any changes in tyrosine phosphorylation on E-selectin (Fig.1 A). Our previously studies have indicated that antibody-mediated cross-linking can be utilized to mimic the specific clustering of cell surface E-selectin that presumably occurs during leukocyte adhesion, and results in activation of ERK1/2 (5Yoshida M. Westlin W.F. Wang N. Ingber D.E. Rosenzweig A. Resnick N. Gimbrone M.A.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 445-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 7Hu Y. Kiely J.M. Szente B.E. Rosenzweig A. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2142-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data strongly suggest the existence of an E-selectin-specific signaling pathway leading to the activation of ERK1/2 that includes Tyr603 in the cytoplasmic domain of E-selectin. Previously, our laboratory had shown that serine residues on the cytoplasmic domain of E-selectin became de-phosphorylated upon HL-60 adhesion (6Yoshida M. Szente B.E. Kiely J.M. Rosenzweig A. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 933-941PubMed Google Scholar). There have been reports that serine/threonine dephosphorylation may be involved in the subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation (35Artcanuthurry V. Grelac F. Maclouf J. Martin-Cramer E. Levy-Toledano S. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 1996; 22: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We are in the process of determining whether cross-linking-induced dephosphorylation on serine residues is required for the observed phosphorylation on tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain of E-selectin.It has been shown that overexpression of a catalytically inactive SHP2 can block ERK1/2 activation in response to insulin, platelet-derived growth factor (36Milarski K.L.

Cell. 1995; 80: 473-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), via a dominant-negative effect. In our system, COS-7 cells co-transfected with WT-E-selectin and catalytically inert SHP2 (dominant negative SHP2), showed significantly blunted E-selectin-dependent ERK1/2 activation (Fig. 3). This suggests that SHP2 is a positive effector upstream of E-selectin-dependent ERK1/2 activation. We have further observed that E-selectin-associated SHP2 can de-phosphorylate tyrosine-phosphorylated E-selectin in vitro (Fig. 4), however; the exact substrate(s) of SHP2 in the context of E-selectin-dependent signaling in vivo are yet to be determined.In other systems, tyrosine-phosphorylated SHP2 functions as an adapter protein with positive effects for downstream signaling (12Bennett A.M.

In our system, we demonstrate by co-immunoprecipitation that SHP2 itself becomes tyrosine phosphorylated and associates with Shc upon cross-linking of cell surface E-selectin (Figs. 5 and 6 A). This further results in the formation of an E-selectin-dependent signaling complex, which includes Shc, Grb2, and Sos (Fig. 6, B and C). These adapter proteins form a macromolecular complex to bridge SHP2 to downstream signals. Previously we had described, that upon cross-linking cell surface E-selectin, Ras was activated and became associated with Raf-1 and phospho-MEK (7Hu Y. Kiely J.M. Szente B.E. Rosenzweig A. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2142-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Here, we show that Sos becomes associated with Ras in an E-selectin-dependent manner (Fig. 6 D). This suggests that the E-selectin-dependent signaling complex, which includes SHP2, Shc, Grb2, and Sos, is physically related to the Ras/Raf-1/MEK/ERK1/2 pathway.In summary, we have shown that E-selectin can transduce signals across the endothelial cell cytoplasmic membrane, via the phosphorylation of a specific tyrosine residue in its cytoplasmic domain. This results in the association of the cytoplasmic domain of E-selectin with SHP2, a protein-tyrosine phosphatase. SHP2, in turn, acts as both a positive effector to the downstream E-selectin-dependent ERK1/2 activation and an adapter protein to bridge between E-selectin and a downstream adapter complex, comprised of Shc, Grb2, and Sos. These events thus outline a molecular mechanism by which cross-linking of E-selectin during leukocyte adhesive interactions on the surface of an activated endothelial cell, can initiate a transmembrane signaling cascade within that endothelial cell. The downstream consequences of these signaling events, including the modulation of endothelial gene expression, may have multifunctional implications for the pathology of inflammation. E-selectin is an inducible adhesion molecule that is expressed at relatively high density on the surface of cultured endothelial cells that have been activated by proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1b (IL-1β),1 tumor necrosis factor-α, or bacterial endotoxin. It is detectable in vivo at the sites of inflammation (1Bevilacqua M.P. Stengelin S. Gimbrone M.A.J. Seed B.

In addition to supporting the rolling and stable arrest of leukocytes on activated endothelium, there is increasing evidence that E-selectin can transduce outside-in signals (4Lorenzon P. Vecile E.

Immunol. 1998; 161: 933-941PubMed Google Scholar). Recently our laboratory demonstrated that leukocyte adhesion to cell surface E-selectin-activated extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK1/2), formed a macrocomplex containing Ras/Raf-1/phospho-MEK, and resulted in the up-regulation of c-fos expression (7Hu Y. Kiely J.M. Szente B.E. Rosenzweig A. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2142-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In this study, we have investigated the molecular events occurring immediately upstream of Ras/Raf/phospho-MEK and downstream of cell surface E-selectin. The cytoplasmic domain of E-selectin has been implicated in transmembrane signaling (5Yoshida M. Westlin W.F. Wang N. Ingber D.E. Rosenzweig A. Resnick N. Gimbrone M.A.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 445-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 7Hu Y. Kiely J.M. Szente B.E. Rosenzweig A. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2142-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar); however, the molecular mechanisms involved have not been well defined. The cytoplasmic domain of E-selectin consists of 32 amino acids (1Bevilacqua M.P. Stengelin S. Gimbrone M.A.J. Seed B. Science. 1989; 243: 1160-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar), including two tyrosine residues. It has been well documented that phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domains of various types of receptors can play an important role in receptor-mediated transmembrane signal transduction, especially ERK1/2 activation. Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the two tyrosine residues on the cytoplasmic domain of E-selectin may be involved in the E-selectin-dependent ERK1/2 activation described by our laboratory (7Hu Y. Kiely J.M. Szente B.E. Rosenzweig A. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2142-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 is a ubiquitously expressed cytosolic protein, which contains two amino-terminal tandem SH2 domains and a carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain (8Neel B.G. Semin. Cell Biol. 1993; 4: 419-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). SHP2 associates with tyrosine-phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor, the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (9Case R.D. Piccione E. Wolf G. Benett A.M. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G.

Moreover, SHP2 has been show to have a positive effect on ERK1/2 signaling pathway (15Oh E.S. Gu H. Saxton T.M. Timms J.F. Hausdorff S. Frevert E.U. Kahn B.B. Pawson T. Neel B.G. Thomas S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3205-3215Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), (16Yamauchi K. Milarski K.L. Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 664-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). In this study, we describe the molecular mechanisms involved in the initiation of transmembrane signaling by cross-linking of cell surface E-selectin. These include tyrosine phosphorylation of E-selectin, association with SHP2, and assembly of the adapter proteins, Shc, Grb2, and Sos, to form a signaling complex, which then bridges SHP2 to the Ras·Raf-1·phospho-MEK macrocomplex, resulting in ERK1/2 activation. DISCUSSIONThere is ample evidence that transmembrane adhesion molecules can both physically bridge and biochemically transduce signals among interacting cells. The selectins, a family of adhesion molecules involved in leukocyte adhesion to activated vascular endothelium, are no exception. Binding to L-selectin has been shown to generate both inside-out and outside-in signals, such as the activation of the Ras pathway and potentiation of the oxidative burst of human neutrophils (20Brenner B.

P-selectin also has been shown to transduce signals across the plasma membrane, resulting in the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase and transient increases in intracellular Ca2+ (4Lorenzon P.

Our laboratory has demonstrated that adhesion of HL-60 cells, which expresses ligands for E-selectin, or monoclonal antibody (mAb)-mediated cell surface E-selectin cross-linking, can induce cytoskeletal linkage of E-selectin (5Yoshida M. Westlin W.F. Wang N. Ingber D.E. Rosenzweig A. Resnick N. Gimbrone M.A.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 445-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), dephosphorylation of serine residues in the cytoplasmic domain of E-selectin (6Yoshida M. Szente B.E. Kiely J.M. Rosenzweig A. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 933-941PubMed Google Scholar), and activation of ERK1/2, as well as the formation of a Ras·Raf·MEK macrocomplex (7Hu Y. Kiely J.M. Szente B.E. Rosenzweig A. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2142-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).In this study, we used E-selectin single-point mutants to demonstrate that one tyrosine residue, Tyr603, in the cytoplasmic domain of E-selectin plays an essential role in the association between E-selectin and SHP2, and in mediating the ERK1/2 activation induced by cross-linking cell surface E-selectin. A consensus sequence for SHP2 binding, Y(I/V)X (V/I/L/P), has been defined in several proteins, such as platelet-derived growth factor β-receptor and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule)-1 (33Ronnstrand L. Arvidsson A.K. Kallin A. Rorsman C. Hellman U. Engstrom U. Wernstedt C. Heldin C.H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3696-3702Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 34Masuda M. Osawa M. Shigematsu H. Harada N. Fujiwara K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domain of E-selectin does contain similar motifs around the Tyr603 (YQKP) and Tyr608 (YIL) residues. Upon cross-linking of cell surface E-selectin, SHP2 becomes associated with E-selectin in a time-dependent (Fig. 1 B) and dose-dependent (data not shown) manner; however, only Tyr603 appeared to play an essential role in this association. Furthermore, Tyr603 plays an important role in E-selectin-dependent ERK1/2 activation (Fig. 2). Although the basal level of the association between SHP2 and E-selectin mutated at Tyr608 appears to be slightly higher than the wild-type E-selectin (Fig. 1 C), this increased association does not result in any E-selectin-dependent ERK1/2 activation (Fig.2), suggesting a nonspecific effect. Cross-linking another endothelial cell surface heterodimer, the HLA class I molecule, which is present at comparable density on the surface of IL-1β-activated HUVEC, did not generate any changes in tyrosine phosphorylation on E-selectin (Fig.1 A). Our previously studies have indicated that antibody-mediated cross-linking can be utilized to mimic the specific clustering of cell surface E-selectin that presumably occurs during leukocyte adhesion, and results in activation of ERK1/2 (5Yoshida M. Westlin W.F. Wang N. Ingber D.E. Rosenzweig A. Resnick N. Gimbrone M.A.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 445-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 7Hu Y. Kiely J.M. Szente B.E. Rosenzweig A. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2142-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data strongly suggest the existence of an E-selectin-specific signaling pathway leading to the activation of ERK1/2 that includes Tyr603 in the cytoplasmic domain of E-selectin. Previously, our laboratory had shown that serine residues on the cytoplasmic domain of E-selectin became de-phosphorylated upon HL-60 adhesion (6Yoshida M. Szente B.E. Kiely J.M. Rosenzweig A. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 933-941PubMed Google Scholar). There have been reports that serine/threonine dephosphorylation may be involved in the subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation (35Artcanuthurry V. Grelac F. Maclouf J. Martin-Cramer E. Levy-Toledano S. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 1996; 22: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We are in the process of determining whether cross-linking-induced dephosphorylation on serine residues is required for the observed phosphorylation on tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain of E-selectin.It has been shown that overexpression of a catalytically inactive SHP2 can block ERK1/2 activation in response to insulin, platelet-derived growth factor (36Milarski K.L.

In our system, COS-7 cells co-transfected with WT-E-selectin and catalytically inert SHP2 (dominant negative SHP2), showed significantly blunted E-selectin-dependent ERK1/2 activation (Fig. 3). This suggests that SHP2 is a positive effector upstream of E-selectin-dependent ERK1/2 activation. We have further observed that E-selectin-associated SHP2 can de-phosphorylate tyrosine-phosphorylated E-selectin in vitro (Fig. 4), however; the exact substrate(s) of SHP2 in the context of E-selectin-dependent signaling in vivo are yet to be determined.In other systems, tyrosine-phosphorylated SHP2 functions as an adapter protein with positive effects for downstream signaling (12Bennett A.M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 15862-15865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In our system, we demonstrate by co-immunoprecipitation that SHP2 itself becomes tyrosine phosphorylated and associates with Shc upon cross-linking of cell surface E-selectin (Figs. 5 and 6 A). This further results in the formation of an E-selectin-dependent signaling complex, which includes Shc, Grb2, and Sos (Fig. 6, B and C). These adapter proteins form a macromolecular complex to bridge SHP2 to downstream signals. Previously we had described, that upon cross-linking cell surface E-selectin, Ras was activated and became associated with Raf-1 and phospho-MEK (7Hu Y. Kiely J.M. Szente B.E. Rosenzweig A. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2142-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Here, we show that Sos becomes associated with Ras in an E-selectin-dependent manner (Fig. 6 D). This suggests that the E-selectin-dependent signaling complex, which includes SHP2, Shc, Grb2, and Sos, is physically related to the Ras/Raf-1/MEK/ERK1/2 pathway.In summary, we have shown that E-selectin can transduce signals across the endothelial cell cytoplasmic membrane, via the phosphorylation of a specific tyrosine residue in its cytoplasmic domain.

In our system, we demonstrate by co-immunoprecipitation that SHP2 itself becomes tyrosine phosphorylated and associates with Shc upon cross-linking of cell surface E-selectin (Figs. 5 and 6 A). This further results in the formation of an E-selectin-dependent signaling complex, which includes Shc, Grb2, and Sos (Fig. 6, B and C). These adapter proteins form a macromolecular complex to bridge SHP2 to downstream signals. Previously we had described, that upon cross-linking cell surface E-selectin, Ras was activated and became associated with Raf-1 and phospho-MEK (7Hu Y. Kiely J.M. Szente B.E. Rosenzweig A. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2142-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Here, we show that Sos becomes associated with Ras in an E-selectin-dependent manner (Fig. 6 D). This suggests that the E-selectin-dependent signaling complex, which includes SHP2, Shc, Grb2, and Sos, is physically related to the Ras/Raf-1/MEK/ERK1/2 pathway. In summary, we have shown that E-selectin can transduce signals across the endothelial cell cytoplasmic membrane, via the phosphorylation of a specific tyrosine residue in its cytoplasmic domain. This results in the association of the cytoplasmic domain of E-selectin with SHP2, a protein-tyrosine phosphatase. SHP2, in turn, acts as both a positive effector to the downstream E-selectin-dependent ERK1/2 activation and an adapter protein to bridge between E-selectin and a downstream adapter complex, comprised of Shc, Grb2, and Sos. These events thus outline a molecular mechanism by which cross-linking of E-selectin during leukocyte adhesive interactions on the surface of an activated endothelial cell, can initiate a transmembrane signaling cascade within that endothelial cell. The downstream consequences of these signaling events, including the modulation of endothelial gene expression, may have multifunctional implications for the pathology of inflammation.

Helper T-cell epitopes in bacteriophage T4 Hsp10 have been mapped by restimulation of splenocytes from CBA/J and C57BL/6J mice immunized in conjunction with mutant (R192G) heat-labile enterotoxin from <i>Escherichia coli</i>. Promiscuously immunogenic sequences were associated with unstable loops in the three-dimensional structure of T4 Hsp10. The immunodominant sequence lies on the N-terminal flank of the 22-residue mobile loop, which is sensitive to proteolysis in divergent Hsp10s. Several mobile loop deletions that inhibited proteolysis <i>in vitro</i> caused global changes in the helper T-cell epitope map. A mobile loop deletion that strongly stabilized the protein dramatically reduced the immunogenicity of the flanking immunodominant helper T-cell epitope, although the protein retained good overall immunogenicity. Antisera against the mobile loop deletion variants exhibited increased cross-reactivity, most especially the antisera against the strongly stabilized variant. The results support the hypothesis that unstable loops promote the presentation of flanking epitopes and suggest that loop deletion could be a general strategy to increase the breadth and strength of an immune response."

Different naturally occurring mutations in the CCR5 gene abolish receptor function, the most frequent being a 32-nucleotide deletion resulting in a truncated protein (Δ32) lacking the last three transmembrane domains (TM5–7). This mutant is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and exerts atrans-dominant negative (TDN) effect on the wild type, preventing its exit from this compartment. This TDN effect is often considered as evidence for the oligomerization of CCR5 during transport to the cell surface. Here we use a genetic approach to define the structural determinants of the TDN effect of the Δ32 mutant. It was abolished by certain deletions and by mutations of cysteine residues preventing formation of a disulfide link between the first and second extracellular loops, suggesting that conformation of Δ32 is important for its interaction with CCR5. To circumvent this problem, we used chimeric forms of the Δ32 and wild type CCR5, consisting in substitutions with homologous domains from the mouse CCR5. All chimeric full-length receptors were expressed at the cell surface and were functional for interaction with HIV-1 or with a chemokine ligand, when assayed. The TDN effect was only observed if both the TM3 domain in CCR5 and the TM4 domain in Δ32 were from human origin, whereas the rest of the proteins could be from either origin. This suggests that the TDN effect involves some form of interaction between these transmembrane domains. Alternatively, but less likely to us, substitutions in TM4 could affect the conformation of CCR5 in the endoplasmic reticulum but not at the cell surface. However that may be, it seems that the TDN effect of the Δ32 mutant has no bearing to the issue of CCR5 dimerization and to its possible role in the processing of the receptor to the cell surface.

Most chemokines can be classified in the CC or CXC subgroups depending upon the relative position of two conserved cysteines in their amino-terminal region, and the same terminology (CCR or CXCR) is used for their receptors. The presence of chemokine receptors at the surface of cells allows their infection by the human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1) or by related retroviruses. At least 10 chemokine receptors can confer permissivity to HIV-1 under experimental conditions (4Shimizu N. Soda Y. Kanbe K. Liu H.Y. Mukai R. Kitamura T. Hoshino H. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), but only two, CCR5 and CXCR4, seem to be used by HIV-1 in vivo (reviewed in Refs. 5Doms R.W. Moore J.P. J.

The interaction of CCR5 or CXCR4 with the HIV-1 surface envelope glycoprotein gp120 usually occurs after a prior contact of gp120 with another cell surface protein, CD4, leading to a view of chemokine receptors as CD4-associated HIV-1 co-receptors. The selectivity of HIV-1 strains for CCR5 or for CXCR4 determines biological properties, in particular cell tropism, and could also influence the evolution of infection in vivo. Indeed, viral strains able to use CXCR4 (termed X4) or both CCR5 and CXCR4 (R5X4 strains) usually emerge at later stages of infection, whereas strictly CCR5-dependent strains (R5) are present throughout infection (7Berger E.A. Murphy P.M. Farber J.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 657-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (1865) Google Scholar).

Spontaneously formed CXCR4 dimers have also been observed in macrophages and proposed to play a role in the resistance of these cells to infection by X4 HIV-1 strains (36Lapham C.K. Zaitseva M.B. Lee S. Romanstseva T. Golding H. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Here we have used a genetic approach to study thetrans-inhibitory effect of the Δ32 CCR5 mutant on the expression of the WT receptor. Our aim was to define the structural requirements for this effect and hence for the interaction of these forms of CCR5. Determinants for this interaction were located in different TM domains of the mutant and the WT receptor. A variant of CCR5 fully resistant to the trans-inhibitory effect was apparently processed normally to the cell surface and was functional for interaction with a chemokine ligand. This suggests that the interaction between the Δ32 mutant and the WT CCR5 does not mimic the formation of CCR5 homo-oligomers or that CCR5 oligomerization is not required for processing to the cell surface. All cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin). The HeLa-P4 (37Clavel F.

The MIP1-β chemokine was purchased from Peprotech, Inc. All WT and mutant chemokine receptors cDNAs were subcloned downstream to the cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter. Site-directed mutagenesis (42Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4881) Google Scholar) was performed on a single-stranded template corresponding to the human or the mouse CCR5 cDNA using oligonucleotides containing distinctive restriction sites (sequences are available upon request). Mutants were checked by sequencing the CCR5 open reading frame. The Δ32 deletion creates a frameshift after Tyr187 in the second extracellular loop (ECL2) with addition of 31 amino acids irrelevant to the CCR5 sequence. Mutants 1–100, 1–127, 1–176, and 1–183 corresponding to the corresponding amino acids of human CCR5 were obtained by insertion of a termination codon. Mutants Δ32ΔNT (amino-terminal deletion) and Δ32ΔTM1 correspond to deletions engineered in the CCR5 Δ32 context between Asp2 and Lys26 and between Gln27 and Asn56, respectively. The Δ32 mutants C101A and C178A correspond to alanine substitutions of the cysteine residues in ECL1(C101) and/or ECL2 (C178). Mutants 1–127/C101A and 1–176/C101A were obtained by substituting a blunt-ended fragment from C101A into the 1–127 and 1–176 mutants. Chimeric receptors B, C, E, and F corresponding to reciprocal exchanges between the human and mouse CCR5 have been described (43Picard L. Simmons G. Power C.A. Meyer A. Weiss R.A. Clapham P.R. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5003-5011Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other constructs (I, J, and K) were derived by ligating PCR fragments using aSacII restriction site created in ECL1. The MΔ32 mutant corresponds to residues 1–184 of the mouse CCR5, plus 31 irrelevant amino acids at the C terminus. The Δ32.A-F constructs were obtained by ligation of PCR fragments from the 5′ part of previously described chimeric CCR5s and from the 3′ part of Δ32 (junction at residue 184 in ECL2). The Δ32.G and Δ32.H constructs correspond to reciprocal substitutions between Δ32 and MΔ32 involving residues Val146 to Cys178. The FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) was inserted at the amino terminus of several mutants by PCR amplification using a 5′ oligonucleotide encoding the FLAG sequence. The green fluorescent protein (GFP) was expressed from the EGFP-N1 vector (CLONTECH). Flow cytometric analysis of CCR5 expression was performed as described (44Brelot A. Heveker N. Pleskoff O. Sol N. Alizon M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4744-4751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa-P4 cells in 6-well trays (5 × 105 cells/well) were transfected by a standard calcium phosphate method with plasmid vectors encoding GFP and WT or mutant CCR5 (the ratio of GFP vector to total transfected DNA was 1:6). The cells were detached with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1 mm EDTA 36 h after transfection, stained for 1 h at 4 °C with the 2D7 anti-CCR5 mAb (10 μg/ml in PBS with 2% fetal calf serum), then stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated secondary Ab, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and analyzed on an Epics Elite flow cytometer (Coultronics). Expression of CCR5 (red fluorescence) was assessed among GFP-positive cells. For confocal microscopy analysis, HeLa-P4 cells were grown and transfected on 1-cm glass coverslips. After 36 h, the cells were fixed in PBS, 1% paraformaldehyde (15 min), quenched in PBS, 0.1 m glycine (15 min) and permeabilized in PBS, 0.05% saponin, 0.2% bovine serum albumin (40 min) at room temperature. The cells were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the 2D7 mAb (10 μg/ml), then incubated for 1 h with fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled secondary Ab anti-mouse Ig, then mounted in 100 mg/ml mowiol, a powder used for the experiment, (Calbiochem), 30% (w/v) glycerol, 100 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.5), and examined under a confocal microscope (model MRC-1024; Bio-Rad). Immunoprecipitations of epitope-tagged (FLAG) CCR5 mutants were performed in HEK 293T cells 48 h after transfection. Approximately 107 cells were lysed for 1 h at 4 °C in 1 ml of 0.5% n-dodecyl-d-maltoside (Sigma), 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 140 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), suppplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Lysates (1 ml) clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 15 min were left in contact 4 h with 40 μl of agarose-conjugated M2 (anti-FLAG) mAb (Sigma) at 4 °C. Bound proteins were separated by SDS/PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Polyscreen; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for Western blot analysis using the M2 mAb (1 μg/ml) and a peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse antibody (0.5 μg/ml). The reaction was revealed with the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). HeLa-P4 and U373MG-CD4 cells in 6-well trays (5 × 105 cells/well) were transfected with expression vectors for WT or mutant chemokine receptors by calcium phosphate precipitation. Co-cultures were initiated 24 h after transfection by adding an equivalent number of freshly trypsinized HeLa-Env cells. After 24 h, the cells were washed, fixed in 0.5% glutaraldehyde, and stained for β-galactosidase activity with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal), as described (45Dragic T. Charneau P. Clavel F. Alizon M. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4794-4802Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Blue-stained foci were scored under 20× magnification. Cell counts >200 were obtained by extrapolation from randomly selected fields. Down-regulation of CCR5 cell surface expression after contact with chemokine ligand was assessed as described (46Amara A. Gall S.L. Schwartz O. Salamero J. Montes M. Loetscher P. Baggiolini M. Virelizier J.L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Briefly, 106 transfected HEK 293T cells were detached in PBS-EDTA, pelleted, and resuspended in 100 μl of PBS, 2% fetal calf serum with or without 10 nm MIP-1β. After 30 min at 37 °C, the cells were transferred to ice, washed with a buffer containing 50 mm glycine and 100 mm NaCl (pH 3.0), and then processed for analysis of CCR5 expression by flow cytometry, as previously described. The expression of CCR5 at the surface of transfected HeLa-P4 cells was analyzed by flow cytometry after staining with the 2D7 mAb directed against a conformational epitope formed at least in part by the second extracellular loop (ECL2) of the receptor (41Lee B. Sharron M. Blanpain C. Doranz B.J. Vakili J. Setoh P. Berg E. Liu G. Guy H.R. Durell S.R. Parmentier M. Chang C.N. Price K. Tsang M. Doms R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9617-9626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). As expected, the fraction of stained cells and mean fluorescence intensity were markedly reduced when cells were co-transfected with expression vectors for the WT CCR5 and the Δ32 mutant in equal amounts, relative to cells transfected with the WT CCR5 vector and a control plasmid (Fig. 1 A). Similar results were obtained using other cell types (COS, HEK, and U373MG-CD4 cells) or when cells were stained with the 3A9 mAb, which detects a conformation-independent epitope in the amino-terminal (NT) extracellular domain of CCR5 (data not shown). When cells co-transfected with the WT CCR5 and Δ32 vectors were stained with the 2D7 mAb, confocal microscopy revealed accumulation of CCR5 in a perinuclear compartment probably corresponding to the endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 1 B), in agreement with results obtained by Benkirane et al. (16Benkirane M. Jin D.Y. Chun R.F. Koup R.A. Jeang K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30603-30606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The level of expression of CCR5 at the surface of cells can be indirectly assessed from their relative permissivity to HIV-1 infection or to formation of syncytia with cells expressing the HIV-1 envelope proteins (Env). Fusion of U373MG-CD4 human astroglioma cells transfected with CCR5 vectors and HeLa-Env/ADA cells (R5 strain) can be readily detected and quantitated by means of a simple β-galactosidase assay (40Pleskoff O. Treboute C. Brelot A. Heveker N. Seman M. Alizon M. Science. 1997; 276: 1874-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The efficiency of fusion was markedly lower for U373MG-CD4 cells co-transfected with WT and Δ32 CCR5 vectors (1:1) relative to cells transfected with the same amount of the WT vector (∼35%; Fig. 2 A). There was no detectable fusion when cells were transfected only with the Δ32 vector. Also, co-transfection with this vector had no apparent effect on the expression of the CXCR4 chemokine receptor measured by its HIV-1 co-receptor activity (Fig. 2 B) or on the surface expression of a number of other markers, including CD4 (data not shown). These results seem to rule out an effect of the Δ32 mutant on the machinery responsible for the routing of proteins to the cell surface. The TDN effect of the Δ32 mutant on the HIV-1 co-receptor activity of CCR5 could be observed using different ratios between transfected expression vectors (Fig. 2 C), even when the WT CCR5 plasmid was in excess (5:1). Such an assay can be used to predict the stoichiometry of the interaction between a functional protein and a nonfunctional mutant, assuming a similar efficiency of expression for both plasmids, and assuming that the heterodimers are not functional (47Rosenberg A.R. Delamarre L. Pique C. Le Blanc I. Griffith G. Dokhelar M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 48Boulay F. Doms R.W. Webster R.G. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 629-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). With these assumptions, the co-receptor activity curve was very close to the profile predicted in the case of a 1:1 interaction between the WT CCR5 and Δ32 (Fig. 2 C). Overall, these initial experiments confirmed the view that the Δ32 mutant and the WT CCR5 form complexes unable to reach the plasma membrane. We next engineered a series of deletions in the Δ32 mutant and assessed their effects on the surface expression of CCR5, judged from the ability of cells to engage fusion with Env+ cells (Fig. 3). There was a similar decrease in the efficiency of cell fusion when U373MG-CD4 cells were co-transfected with expression vectors for WT CCR5 and either the Δ32 or the 1–184 mutant (1:3 ratio), indicating that the 31 carboxyl-terminal residues irrelevant to the CCR5 sequence do not contribute to the TDN effect of the Δ32 mutant. Also, the TDN activity was not affected by the complete deletion of the NT domain (residues 2–26) and was therefore apparently dispensable to the interaction with WT CCR5. Using a yeast two-hybrid selection assay, Benkirane et al. (16Benkirane M. Jin D.Y. Chun R.F. Koup R.A. Jeang K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30603-30606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) found that the complete CCR5 (residues 1–352) interacted with itself or with a Δ32 mutant (residues 1–187) but not with an NT-deleted CCR5 (residues 58–352) and concluded that the NT domain participated in the interaction. The apparent discrepancy between these results and ours likely results from the use of very different experimental settings. The type of interaction that occurs in yeast between forms of CCR5 fused to heterologous proteins may not correspond to what occurs in human cells between native proteins. The in-frame deletion of the TM1 domain (deletion of residues 27–56) reduced but did not abolish the TDN effect of the Δ32 mutant, which was the case upon truncation at the level of ECL1 (mutant 1–100), TM3 (mutant 1–127), or ECL2 (mutant 1–176). The result seen with the last mutant was unexpected, because it only differed from the 1–184 mutant by a few residues in an extracellular loop. To rule out the possibility that the lack of TDN effect was due to inefficient expression, HEK 293T cells were transfected with epitope-tagged forms of the Δ32 mutant and derivatives, corresponding to in-frame insertion of a FLAG sequence at their N terminus. Immunoprecipitations with anti-FLAG antibodies showed a similar level of expression for the Δ32, 1–178, and 1–100 CCR5 mutants in cell lysates (Fig. 4). We were therefore led to consider that the integrity of the ECL2, or in fact its initial nine residues, was required for the TDN effect of the Δ32 mutant. The first and second extracellular loops of 7TM receptors contain conserved cysteine residues (Cys101 and Cys178in t"

We screened 53 single mutants within the region Val700–Arg712in the polymerase active-site motif A. Only replacement of Ile709 yielded mutator polymerases, with substitution of Met, Asn, Phe, or Ala increasing the β-lactamase reversion frequency 5–23-fold. Steady-state kinetic analysis of the I709F polymerase revealed reductions in apparent K m values for both insertion of non-complementary nucleotides and extension of mispaired primer termini. Abolishment of the 3′–5′ exonuclease activity of wild-type pol I increased mutation frequency 4-fold, whereas the combination of I709F and lack of the 3′–5′ exonuclease yielded a 400-fold increase. We conclude that accurate discrimination of the incoming nucleotide at the polymerase domain is more critical than exonucleolytic proofreading for the fidelity of pol I in vivo. Surprisingly, the I709F polymerase enhanced mutagenesis in chromosomal DNA, although the increase was 10-fold less than in plasmid DNA.

DNA polymerase I exonuclease-deficient 3′–5′ exonuclease-deficient DNA polymerase III DNA polymerases catalyze chain elongation reactions guided by complementary base pairings opposite a single-stranded DNA template. These reactions are highly accurate, exhibiting error rates of about one base substitution error per 104 to 107nucleotides polymerized (1Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 497-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). However, errors made by the polymerase, if not subsequently excised, can become fixed as mutations during subsequent rounds of replication. As a result, errors by DNA polymerases can be a major source of spontaneous mutagenesis and can contribute to the multiplicity of mutations found in cancer cells (2Loeb L.A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3230-3239PubMed Google Scholar,3Loeb K.R. Loeb L.A. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 379-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Many DNA polymerases have intrinsic or associated 3′–5′ exonucleases that preferentially hydrolyze non-complementary nucleotides immediately after formation of the phosphodiester bond and contribute from a few- to 100-fold to the fidelity of DNA synthesis (4Brutlag D. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 241-248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Muzyczka N. Poland R.L. Bessman M.J. J. Biol.

In addition, errors introduced by DNA polymerases are subsequently corrected by a mismatch repair system, which contributes an additional 2–3 orders of magnitude to the accuracy of DNA replication (7Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6597-6600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, base selection at the polymerase active site during both the nucleotide insertion and subsequent extension reactions, including Watson-Crick base pair formation between complementary bases and a conformational change of the active site during each incorporation step, is likely the most significant contributor to the fidelity of DNA polymerization (1Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 497-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar, 8Pham P.T. Olson M.W. McHenry C.S. Schaaper R.M. J. Biol.

We have investigated the relationships between structure and function at the active site of DNA polymerases by substituting random sequences for nucleotides that encode residues at the active site and monitoring the effects of these substitutions on the fidelity of DNA synthesis (11Suzuki M. Avicola A.K. Hood L. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11228-11235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar,12Patel P.H. Kawate H. Adman E. Ashbach M. Loeb L.A. J. Biol.

Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I (pol I)1 is involved in DNA replication, DNA repair, and genetic recombination (13Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992Google Scholar); it is the most extensively studied of all DNA polymerases. Evidence indicates that pol I functions in DNA replication by removal of RNA primers and resynthesis of the resulting gaps between Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand (14Kuempel P.L. Veomett G.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1970; 41: 973-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 15Okazaki R. Arisawa M. Sugino A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 2954-2957Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In addition, pol I participates in DNA repair by filling gaps resulting from the excision of damaged bases (16Boyle J.M. Paterson M.C. Setlow R.B. Nature. 1970; 226: 708-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 17Cooper P.K. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 1156-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Moreover, pol I is required for the initiation of synthesis at the origin of replication in certain plasmids (13Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992Google Scholar, 18del Solar G. Giraldo R. Ruiz-Echevarrı́a M.J. Espinosa M. Dı́az-Orejas R. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 434-464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the Klenow fragment of pol I (which lacks the 5′–3′ exonuclease domain) reveals an architecture that is common among DNA polymerases and has been likened to a human right hand, with a fingers subdomain (which binds the incoming dNTP and interacts with the single-stranded DNA template), a thumb subdomain (which binds double-stranded DNA), and a palm subdomain (which harbors the catalytic amino acids and also interacts with the incoming dNTP) (19Ollis D.L. Brick P. Hamlin R. Xuong N.G. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1985; 313: 762-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 20Steitz T.A. J. Biol.

Several mutant forms of the Klenow fragment of pol I (in which single amino acid substitutions have been introduced into the active-site fingers or palm subdomain (21Carroll S.S. Cowart M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 24954-24961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar)) that exhibit altered fidelity in DNA synthesis in vitro have been investigated. Although many such mutant enzymes exhibit reduced fidelity in vitro, none has been shown to alter accuracyin vivo. In a recent study, we examined the mutability of motif A, extending from Val700 to Arg712, in the palm subdomain ofE. coli pol I using random mutagenesis and a genetic complementation system (25Shinkai A. Patel P.H. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18836-18842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We established a library of 500,000 transfectants and sequenced 232 of 37,500 mutants that were active in the complementation assay. E. coli strains harboring the active mutants were fit to replicate repetitively, and the mutant polymerases, when purified, displayed 20–190% of the wild-type specific activity. Thus, motif A is highly mutable while preserving wild type-like DNA polymerase activity in vitro and in vivo. The ease of substitutability of motif A residues revealed in this work, yielding highly functional variants, stands in sharp contrast to the marked conservation of the motif A sequence observed among prokaryotic DNA polymerases (26Astatke M. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 147-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 27Patel P.H. Suzuki M. Adman E. Shinkai A. Loeb L.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 823-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we also found that certain substitutions of Ile709 permit more efficient utilization of rNTPs as substrates in vitro. In this study, we screened 53 mutations in motif A for infidelity of DNA synthesis in vivo and found that mutant enzymes harboring Ile709 substitutions exhibited less accurate DNA replication. The mutator phenotype was enhanced when the Ile709 substitutions were combined with deficiency of 3′–5′ exonucleolytic proofreading activity. In subsequent in vitro experiments, we determined that the I709F substitution increased both insertion of non-complementary nucleotides as well as extension from primers with mismatched 3′-OH termini. To our knowledge, this is the first analysis of the effects of mutation in the polymerase active site of E. coli pol I on the fidelity of DNA synthesis both in vitro and in cells. The wild-type and mutant E. coli pol I genes were inserted into pHSG576 (28Takeshita S. Sato M. Toba M. Masahashi W. Hashimoto-Gotoh T. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 61: 63-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar), placing them under the control of the lactose promoter. pHSG576 is low copy number plasmid that has a pol I-independent origin. To modify the gene, the wild-type pol I gene of E. coli DH5α was amplified by colony polymerase chain reaction and inserted into pHSG576 to create pECpol I as described previously (25Shinkai A. Patel P.H. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18836-18842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on pECpol I to introduce an A-to-C transversion at position 1271, thus changing Asp424 to Ala and inactivating the 3′–5′ exonuclease activity (29Derbyshire V. Freemont P.S. Sanderson M.R. Beese L. Friedman J.M. Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. Science. 1988; 240: 199-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), to construct pECpol I-3′exo−, which carries the 3′–5′ exonuclease-minus pol I gene. Plasmids pECI709M, pECI709N, pECI709F, and pECI709A, which carry Ile709 mutant pol I genes, were isolated from a mutant pol I library by genetic selection as described previously (25Shinkai A. Patel P.H. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18836-18842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Plasmids pECI709M-3′exo−, pECI709N-3′exo−, pECI709F-3′exo−, and pECI709A-3′exo− were constructed by substituting the 1.1-kb SacI-EcoRI fragment of pECpol I-3′exo− for the corresponding fragment of pECI709M, pECI709N, pECI709F, and pECI709A, respectively. The reporter plasmids for measuring the reversion frequency of the β-lactamase gene were constructed by modifying plasmid pGPS3 (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA), which contains a ColE1-type origin derived from pUC19. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on pGPS3 to introduce a G-to-T transversion at position 76 of the β-lactamase gene, changing the codon GAA for Glu26 to the ochre codon TAA. The resulting plasmid was designated pLA2800. The mutant β-lactamase gene containing its own promoter was amplified by polymerase chain reaction with the synthetic oligonucleotides 5′-GCACCCGACATACATGTCCTATTTGTTTATT-3′ and 5′-AAACTTGGTCGGATCCTTACCAATGCTTAATC-3′ as primers and pLA2800 as a template, and the amplified fragment was cloned into pCRII (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The 1-kb AflIII-KpnI fragment containing the mutant β-lactamase gene was excised and cloned into the AflIII-KpnI site ∼60 bp distant from the origin of pGPS3ΔLA (see below) to create pLA230. Plasmid pGPS3ΔLA was constructed by replacing the 1.2-kbBglII-BglI fragment of pGPS3 with the synthetic oligonucleotides 5′-GATCTGATCGCCCTTC-3′ and 5′-GGGCGATCA-3′. A schematic representation of the reporter plasmids pLA230 and pLA2800 is shown in Fig. 1 A. A schematic representation of this assay is shown in Fig. 1 B.

The recombinant strains were cultured at 30 °C for 16 h in nutrient broth containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin, 12.5 μg/ml tetracycline, and 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol. A 0.01 volume of the pre-cultured broth was inoculated into fresh medium; cultured at 37 °C until an A 600 of ∼1.0 was attained; and then plated onto LB agar plates supplemented with 50 μg/ml kanamycin, 12.5 μg/ml tetracycline, and 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol in the presence or absence of 80 μg/ml carbenicillin. After incubation at 37 °C for 16 h, colonies were counted, and reversion frequencies were calculated as the ratio of carbenicillin-resistant to total colonies. Plasmids prepared from revertants were re-transformed into E. coli BL21 and selected on LB plates containing 50 μg/ml carbenicillin. The plasmids were prepared from the recombinant BL21 strain, and the nucleotide sequence of the entire β-lactamase gene was determined. The Trp+reversion assay was performed basically following the method of Washington et al. (32Washington S.L. Yoon M.S. Chagovetz A.M. Li S.-X. Clairmont C.A. Preston B.D. Eckert K.A. Sweasy J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1321-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). E. coli JS200 was transformed with plasmids pECpol I, pECpol I-3′exo−, pECI709F, and pECI709F-3′exo−, as indicated. The transfectants were cultured at 30 °C for 16 h in nutrient broth supplemented with 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol and 12.5 μg/ml tetracycline. A 0.01 volume of each culture was inoculated into fresh medium, cultured at 37 °C until an A600 of ∼1.0 was attained, and then plated onto M9 minimum agar plates supplemented with 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol in the presence or absence of 40 μg/ml tryptophan. After incubation at 37 °C for 20 h, colonies were counted, and the frequency of appearance of the Trp+ strain was calculated. The trpE gene in JS200 and in Trp+revertant strains was amplified by colony polymerase chain reaction with 5′-CCATGCGTAAAGCAATCAGATACCC-3′ and 5′-TTATCGAGCAGCAGAATGTCAGCCA-3′ as primers, and the amplified fragment was cloned into pCRII; the nucleotide sequence of the entiretrpE gene was then determined. Steady-state kinetic analysis of misincorporation frequency was performed based on the method of Boosalis et al. (33Boosalis M.S. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14689-14696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 47-mer template (3′-GCGCGGCTTAAGGGCGATCGTTATAGCTTAAGGCCTTTAAAGGGCCC-5′; the relevant template bases are underlined) was hybridized with a32P-5′-end-labeled 23-mer primer (5′-CGCGCCGAATTCCCGCTAGCAAT-3′) for analysis of misinsertion efficiency opposite dT and with a 25-mer primer (5′-CGCGCCGAATTCCCGCTAGCAATAT-3′) for analysis opposite dG. Primer-template (5 nm) was incubated for 5 min at 37 °C in a reaction mixture containing limiting amounts of purified recombinant Klenow (exo−) protein (5 nm) prepared as described previously (25Shinkai A.

The ranges of nucleotide substrate concentrations used for measuring incorporation opposite template dT were 0.5–7.5 nm dATP, 0.5–50 μm dGTP, and 10–300 μm dCTP and dTTP for the wild-type enzyme and 0.5–7.5 nm dATP, 0.05–5 μm dGTP, 2–14 μm dCTP, and 1–7 μm dTTP for the I709F mutant enzyme. The concentrations of the nucleotide substrates opposite template dG were 10–70 μm dATP, 1–50 μmdGTP, 2–30 nm dCTP, and 10–300 μm dTTP for the wild-type enzyme and 0.1–5 μm dATP, 0.1–5 μm dGTP, 2–30 nm dCTP, and 0.1–30 μm dTTP for the I709F mutant enzyme. Following termination of the reaction by addition of 2.5 μl of formamide solution, the products were analyzed by 14% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and quantified by phosphor image analysis (34Patel P.H.

Mismatch extension frequency was determined using a similar protocol, except that the sequence of the 24-mer primer was 5′-CGCGCCGAATTCCCGCTAGCAATX-3′ (where X was A, G, C, or T). Reaction mixtures contained dTTP, i.e. the correct dNTP for insertion opposite the next template base. The efficiency of dTTP incorporation opposite template dA was measured for each primer-template construct. The concentrations of the dTTP substrate were 0.5–3.5 nm for the T:A matched pair, 5–1000 nm for the T:G and T:C mismatches, and 0.025–14 μm for the T:T mismatch. To measure errors in DNA synthesis by pol I in vivo, we established a two-plasmid system. The reporter plasmid pLA230 (Fig. 1 A) contains a β-lactamase gene harboring an ochre mutation near the 5′ terminus. Since evidence indicates that pol I is involved in initiation of DNA synthesis in ColE1-type plasmids (13Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H.

Rev. 1998; 62: 434-464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we introduced the ochre mutation ∼230 bp from the ori sequence. The reporter plasmid, together with a second plasmid encoding the wild-type or mutant pol I gene, was transfected into E. coli JS200 (30Sweasy J.B. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1407-1410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Witkin E.M. Boegner-Maniscalco V. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4166-4168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a strain that contains a temperature-sensitive pol I. The reversion frequency at the β-lactamase locus was determined by measuring colony formation in the presence and absence of carbenicillin (Fig. 1 B). The pol I gene encoded by the second plasmid corresponds to the intact enzyme and hence encodes both 5′–3′ and 3′–5′ exonuclease activities as well as DNA polymerase activity (13Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992Google Scholar). To identify amino acids in active-site motif A that affect the fidelity of DNA synthesis, we tested 53 different single motif A mutations within the segment spanning Val700–Arg712 (25Shinkai A. Patel P.H. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18836-18842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Representative reversion frequencies obtained for mutants containing substitutions at each of the positions analyzed are shown in Table I. The reversion frequency observed for wild-type pol I was ∼1 × 10−7, as was that for all the mutants tested except the four with substitutions at position 709. Substitution of Met, Asn, Phe, or Ala for Ile709 yielded 5.3–23 times higher reversion frequencies than that for wild-type pol I (Tables I and II). We analyzed the nucleotide sequence of the β-lactamase reporter gene from five independent revertants harboring I709F mutant pol I and confirmed that the ochre mutation was converted twice to TTA, twice to TCA, and once to CAA. The enhanced mutagenesis observed for the Ile709 mutants provides new evidence thatE. coli DNA polymerase I is involved in plasmid replication by copying nucleotides near the ori sequence and demonstrates that Ile709 is critical for accurate plasmid replication in vivo.Table IReversion frequency at an ochre codon in the β-lactamase gene in E. coli expressing wild-type and mutant pol Ipol I1-aThe polymerases listed exhibited the highest reversion frequencies observed among mutants at each position in motif A.No. of colonies × 10−8/ml (−carbenicillin)No. of colonies/ml (+carbenicillin)Reversion frequency × 107Wild-type8.7901.0V700I101401.4I701N9.41201.3V702A9.4700.7S703R8.5901.1A704S8.81101.3Asp7051-bAsp705 is immutable (25).Y706F9.0600.7S707A8.6700.8Q708H9.2800.9I709N9.1210023E710D8.6300.3L711V8.91601.8R712S9.6800.81-a The polymerases listed exhibited the highest reversion frequencies observed among mutants at each position in motif A.1-b Asp705 is immutable (25Shinkai A.

Open table in a new tab To analyze the contribution of the 3′–5′ exonuclease (“proofreading”) activity of pol I to the fidelity of plasmid replication, we mutated the 3′–5′ exonuclease in the wild-type enzyme and in the Ile709 variants by substituting Ala for Asp at position 424 in the exonuclease domain. When introduced into the wild-type construct, the D424A substitution enhanced the reversion frequency of the β-lactamase gene by 4.4-fold (Table II). Larger increases (up to 22-fold) were observed for specific amino acid substitutions of Ile709, indicating that discrimination at the active site can be more important for fidelity than exonucleolytic proofreading. Abolishment of the 3′-exonuclease activity in the mutants harboring the I709M, I709N, I709F, or I709A substitution resulted in a 29–416-fold increase in mutation frequency relative to the wild-type enzyme. For each of the mutants, the increase in reversion frequency associated with inactivation of the exonuclease was greater than that observed for the wild-type enzyme. In the case of I709F, the increase was substantially greater than multiplicative, suggesting a functional interaction between the exonuclease domain and motif A.Table IIReversion frequency of the β-lactamase gene in E. coli expressing wild-type and mutant DNA pol I lacking 3′–5′ exonuclease activitypol IReversion frequency2-aValues represent means ± S.D. obtained by plating three independent clones.Relative frequencyWild-type(1.2 ± 0.7) × 10−713′ exo−(5.3 ± 1.6) × 10−74.4I709M(6.3 ± 3.2) × 10−75.3I709M/3′ exo−(3.5 ± 0.3) × 10−629I709N(2.6 ± 0.6) × 10−622I709N/3′ exo−(3.3 ± 1.5) × 10−5280I709F(1.6 ± 0.1) × 10−613I709F/3′ exo−(5.0 ± 0.1) × 10−5416I709A(1.5 ± 0.2) × 10−613I709A/3′ exo−(1.2 ± 0.1) × 10−51002-a Values represent means ± S.D. obtained by plating three independent clones. Open table in a new tab To further evaluate the mutant polymerases, we measured the reversion frequency of the same β-lactamase gene on another plasmid, pLA2800 (Fig. 1 A and Table III). In this construct, the β-lactamase gene is located ∼2.8 kb downstream of the origin of replication and thus is ∼10-fold more distant from the origin than in pLA230. Introduction of the 3′exo−mutation into the wild-type construct or substitution of Met, Asn, Phe, or Ala for Ile709 in separate constructs resulted in at most a 1.8-fold increase in reversion frequency. In contrast, pol I harboring both the 3′exo− mutation and an Ile709 substitution showed 10–87-fold higher reversion frequency than wild-type pol I; the elevations were not as large, however, as those observed for pLA230 (Table II and III). These results suggest that DNA synthesis by pol I is not necessarily limited to nucleotides near the origin, but can occur much farther downstream.Table IIIReversion frequency of the β-lactamase gene located distally from the origin of plasmid replicationpol IReversion frequency3-aValues represent means ± S.D. of three determinations.Relative frequencyWild-type(1.5 ± 0.4) × 10−713′ exo−(1.3 ± 0.9) × 10−70.9I709M(1.0 ± 0.1) × 10−70.7I709M/3′ exo−(1.0 ± 0.5) × 10−66.7I709N(2.7 ± 1.1) × 10−71.8I709N/3′ exo−(5.2 ± 0.9) × 10−635I709F(1.4 ± 0.6) × 10−70.9I709F/3′ exo−(1.3 ± 0.4) × 10−587I709A(1.9 ± 0.7) × 10−71.3I709A/3′ exo−(2.9 ± 1.0) × 10−6193-a Values represent means ± S.D. of three determinations. Open table in a new tab E. coli JS200 cannot grow in the absence of tryptophan since it carries the trpE65 (ochre) allele in the host chromosome. We investigated the effects of the mutant polymerases on the reversion frequency at the trpE locus (Table IV). The reversion frequency observed for wild-type pol I was 2.0 × 10−8. Neither the 3′exo− mutation nor the I709F substitution significantly increased this frequency. In contrast, the mutant pol I with both the 3′exo− mutation and the I709F substitution exhibited a 40-fold increase in reversion frequency. We analyzed the nucleotide sequence of the trpE gene from three independent revertants and determined that the ochre mutation was converted once to TAC and twice to TCA. These results indicate that the mutant pol I bearing both an Ile709 substitution and the 3′exo− mutation participates in replication of theE. coli genome with less accuracy than the wild-type enzyme. However, the effect of the mutator activity on chromosomal DNA synthesis was less than on plasmid DNA synthesis. In all of thein vivo situations examined, specific mutations at the polymerase active site and inactivation of the proofreading activity acted synergistically to increase the mutator activity of pol I.Table IVReversion frequency at an ochre codon in the chromosomal trpE65 gene in E. coli expressing wild-type and mutant pol Ipol IReversion frequency4-aValues represent means ± S.D. obtained by analyzing three clones.Relative frequencyWild-type(2.0 ± 0.8) × 10−813′ exo−(3.0 ± 2.2) × 10−81.5I709F(2.3 ± 1.3) × 10−81.2I709F/3′ exo−(0.8 ± 0.2) × 10−6404-a Values represent means ± S.D. obtained by analyzing three clones. Open table in a new tab To establishin vitro correlates of the mutator phenotype of the Ile709 mutants, we purified the Klenow fragments of the wild-type and I709F exo− polymerases to apparent homogeneity (25Shinkai A. Patel P.H. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18836-18842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These fragments lack both 5′–3′ and 3′–5′ exonuclease activities. The 5′–3′ exonuclease could remove the 5′-label from the primer, and the 3′–5′ exonuclease could remove added nucleotides in extension experiments. We then analyzed the efficiency of misinsertion using a steady-state gel-based assay (33Boosalis M.S. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14689-14696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to measure the kinetics of single nucleotide addition opposite template dT or dG. The primer was a 23- or 25-nucleotide oligomer that was labeled at the 5′-end with 32P, and the 3′-terminal nucleotide was one residue upstream from the target. The wild-type and mutant enzymes showed typical Michaelis-Menten saturation kinetics when initial velocity was plotted against the concentration of each nucleotide (data not shown). Apparent kinetic parameters and relative insertion frequencies were determined for each dNTP (Table V). The I709F polymerase incorporated complementary nucleotides with a catalytic efficiency indistinguishable from that of the wild-type enzyme. However, the catalytic efficiency of misincorporation of the non-complementary nucleotides was 6–35 times greater than that of the wild-type enzyme; the enhancement was 6–23-fold for misinsertion opposite template T and 8–35-fold opposite template G. Increased misincorporation by the mutant enzyme was due almost exclusively to a lower K m for mispaired dNTPs. Notably, misincorporation opposite dT parallels our in vivo finding of A-to-C or A-to-T transversions among the plasmid-borne β-lactamase revertants.

We have engineered two model cellular systems expressing two different exogenous Tyk2-interacting receptors.

However, a dose-dependent interference with signal transduction via the endogenous Ifnar complex was found for STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, Tyk2, and Jak1 activation, for gene induction, and for antiviral activity. In a similar approach, cells expressing the β1 chain of the interleukin-12 receptor showed a reduced transcriptional response to IFN-α as well as reduced STAT and kinase activation.

These receptors and their ligands are part of the complex intercellular communication network regulating essential functions, including host defense, hematopoiesis, and metabolism. The cytokine receptor subunits are composed of an extracellular ligand-binding domain containing evolutionarily conserved receptor module(s), one transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic region (1Uzé G. Lutfalla G. Mogensen K.E. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1995; 15: 3-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 2Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6934-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (1879) Google Scholar). The mode of receptor complex formation is very heterogeneous and can be either homomeric or heteromeric. Examples of the former are the receptors for erythropoietin (Epo),1 growth hormone, and leptin. Alternatively, ligands may induce the assembly of heteromeric receptor complexes, which are often characterized by the use of shared components: βc for the IL-3/IL-5/granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor group and γc or gp130 for the IL-2 and IL-6 families, respectively (3Kishimoto T. Taga T. Akira S. Cell. 1994; 76: 253-262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1248) Google Scholar). More complex patterns of receptor clustering have also been reported, though there is no evidence so far for receptor complexes composed of both class I and class II subunits. Cytokine receptors lack intrinsic kinase activity, but the ligand-induced clustering or reorganization of the subunits leads to trans-phosphorylation and activation of the associated tyrosine kinases of the Jak family (4Yeh T.C. Pellegrini S. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1523-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 5Kotenko S.V. Pestka S. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2557-2565Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). These latter kinases phosphorylate tyrosine residues in the receptor tails, allowing recruitment and activation of signaling molecules. Among these, STATs (signal transducers and activators of transcription) play an essential role in the transmission of signals to the nucleus (6Schindler C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar). Class I and class II cytokine receptors emerged in evolution after the tyrosine kinase receptors, as is apparent from the analysis of theCaenorhabditis elegans genome (7Ruvkun G. Hobert O. Science. 1998; 282: 2033-2041Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this receptor family showed a very rapid expansion during recent evolution. To date, over 40 distinct members have been described. The rapid growth of this gene family was, however, not accompanied by a parallel expansion of the Jak family. In fact, only four Jaks (Jak1, Jak2, Jak3, and Tyk2) have been found in mammals and in fish (8Leu J.H. Yan S.J. Lee T.F. Chou C.M. Chen S.T. Hwang P.P. Chou C.K. Huang C.J. DNA Cell Biol. 2000; 19: 431-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and a single Jak protein, the product of the Hopscotch gene, appears to exist in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. This is in line with the proposed tetraploidization events during early vertebrate development: two successive chromosome duplications giving rise to four gene copies derived from the single ancestral jakgene. Also, in line with this markedly different evolutionary pattern, a higher degree of sequence conservation is observed for the Jaks as compared with the class I and II cytokine receptors. Consequently, different cytokine receptor complexes utilize common Jak family members. This is true not only for receptor complexes with shared subunits but also for different receptor systems belonging to the class I and class II families. Studies of Jak-deficient cell lines and Jak knock-out mice have demonstrated the dedicated and non-redundant role of each Jak protein in specific cytokine signaling pathways (reviewed in Ref. 4Yeh T.C. Pellegrini S. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1523-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Despite intensive efforts, the structural determinants and the molecular forces governing the specificity of the Jak/receptor interaction remain still to be defined. Whether other signaling, chaperone, or scaffolding molecules sustain such complexes, modulate the affinity, or regulate the partitioning of the kinases among receptors is not known. The shared use of Jak proteins, which are physically associated to diverse receptors, could lead to cross-competition and interfere with downstream signaling. Thus, the central notion of Jak sharing in cytokine signaling predicts that, under certain circumstances, receptor complexes converging onto the same Jak protein could compete with each other. This competition could be evoked if, for example, the local supply of available Jak becomes limiting following up-regulation of a cognate receptor subunit. To investigate whether cross-competition among receptors can occur, we focused on two heterodimeric cytokine receptor systems that associate with and require the Tyk2 kinase for signal transmission. One is the interferon (IFN)- α/β receptor, which is composed of two class II chains: Ifnar1 and Ifnar2c (also referred to as IFNaR2–2) (9Mogensen K.E. Lewerenz M. Reboul J. Lutfalla G. Uzé G. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1999; 19: 1069-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The other is the interleukin-12 receptor (IL-12R), composed of two class I chains: β1 and β2, which are finely regulated during T helper cell differentiation (10Gately M.K. Renzetti L.M. Magram J. Stern A.S. Adorini L. Gubler U. Presky D.H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 495-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). Each of these four receptor chains interacts with a Jak protein. Indeed, both Ifnar1 and β1 interact with Tyk2 via their cytoplasmic domains (11Colamonici O. Yan H. Domanski P. Handa R. Smalley D. Mullersman J. Witte M. Krishnan K. Krolewski J. Mol. Cell.

We studied potential interference on the function of the endogenous IFN-α/β receptor in cells overexpressing an EpoR/Ifnar1 chimera in which the Ifnar1 ectodomain is replaced by the ectodomain of the EpoR. We extended the analysis to cells expressing the IL-12Rβ1 chain. By monitoring the IFN-α2- and the IFN-β-induced signaling events and biological effects in these model cellular systems, we demonstrate that regardless of ligand engagement by these exogenous receptors, the IFN-α signaling circuitry via the endogenous IFN receptors is impaired. We provide evidence supporting a mechanism whereby the exogenous Tyk2-interacting receptor can sequester and titer out the kinase away from the endogenous Ifnar1 receptor chain, corrupting its normal functioning.

Levy, anti-STAT1 and anti-STAT2 were from New England Biolabs and Upstate Biotechnology, and anti-STAT3 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies. To measure luciferase activity, cells were treated for 6 h with increasing doses of IFN-α2 and IFN-β ranging from 1 to 100 pm. Cells were lysed, and the luciferase activity was quantified in a luminometer (EG&E Berthold) as described in Ref. 15Uzé G. Di Marco S. Mouchel-Vielh E. Monneron D. Bandu M.T.

The activity in cells stimulated with an excess of IFN (1.5 nm) was considered as 100% and that in untreated cells was considered as 0% activity. Statistical analysis for the comparison of mean doses inducing 50% luciferase activity in transfected clones with the mean doses inducing 50% activity in HL116 cells was carried out with the use oft tests according to Ref. 22Bailey N.T.J.

Surface IL-12Rβ1 and -β2 expression was monitored by staining cells with 5 μg/ml purified rat anti-huIL-12Rβ1 mAb (2B10) (23Wu C.Y. Warrier R.R. Carvajal D.M. Chua A.O. Minetti L.J. Chizzonite R.

After washing in phosphate-buffered saline, 3% serum, cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml biotinylated polyclonal anti-rat IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) and with streptavidin-phycoerythrin (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). In Fig. 7 A, surface Ifnar1 levels were analyzed by incubating cells with 5 μg/ml EA12-AF4 mAb followed by staining with 3 μg/ml R-phycoerythrin goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes). In Fig. 7 B, Ifnar1 levels were monitored by incubating cells with 10 μg/ml AA3 mAb followed by incubation with 10 μg/ml biotinylated anti-mouse IgG antibody and streptavidin-phycoerythrin. Anti-human Ifnar1 mAbs were a gift of L. Runkel (25Goldman L.A. Zafari M. Cutrone E.C. Dang A. Brickelmeier M. Runkel L. Benjamin C.D. Ling L.E. Langer J.A. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1999; 19: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The anti-human Ifnar2 mAb (MMHAR-2) was purchased from PBL (Biochemical Laboratories). Cells were analyzed with a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson). Total RNA from IFN-treated cells was purified using the High Pure RNA Isolation Kit from Roche Diagnostics GmbH. Reverse transcriptions were primed with oligo(dT) and performed using the MuLv Reverse Transcriptase from Life Technologies, Inc. Quantitative PCR assays were done using the SYBR Green I technology on a LightCycler (Roche Diagnostics GmbH). The primer pairs used were: GAPDH forward: 5′-ACAGTCCATGCCATCACTGCC-3′, reverse: 5′-GCCTGCTTCACCACCTTCTTG-3′; 6–16 forward: 5′-CATGCGGCAGAAGGCGGTAT-3′, reverse: 5′-CGACGGCCATGAAGGTCAGG-3′; and 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetase (69 kDa) forward: 5′-AACTGCTTCCGACAATCAAC-3′, reverse: CCTCCTTCTCCCTCCAAAA-3′. Quantification standard curves were obtained using PCR products diluted in 10 μg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA. The specificity of PCR products was checked by melting curve analysis and DNA sequencing. Cells were treated with increasing doses of IFN-α2, IFN-β, or Epo for 16 h. Medium was removed, and cells were challenged with the virus at a multiplicity of infection of 1. The cytopathic effect was scored 20 h after infection by staining living cells with a crystal violet solution (0.5% crystal violet (w/v), 3% formaldehyde, 30% ethanol, and 0.17% NaCl (w/v)). Staining was quantified by solubilizing in 30% acidic acid and measured in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader (Dynatech Laboratories Inc., Chantilly, VA) at 590 nm. All experiments were performed in triplicate. The extracellular domain of the human EpoR was fused to the transmembrane and intracellular regions of the human Ifnar1 receptor subunit (Fig. 1 A). Stable 2fTGH clones expressing the EpoR/Ifnar1 receptor were selected. The expression level of the chimeric receptor in different clones was determined by Scatchard plot analysis using iodinated Epo. Two clones were chosen for further studies: the EpoR/Ifnar1 cl.6 and cl.12, expressing 35,000 and 3,500 chimeric receptors, respectively, on their cell surface. To assess whether the chimeric receptor, in addition to binding the ligand, was also competent to interact with Tyk2, we measured Tyk2 phosphorylation in response to Epo. As shown in Fig. 1 B, inducible phosphorylation of Tyk2 could be detected in cl.6. This result indicates that the Ifnar1 portion of the chimeric receptor recruits Tyk2 and suggests that the Epo-driven dimerization of the chimera may occur through a mechanism similar to the allosteric reorganization of the wild type EpoR that allows activation of the associated Jak (26Remy I. Wilson I.A. Michnick S.W. Science. 1999; 283: 990-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Despite Tyk2 activation, Epo treatment of cells expressing the EpoR/Ifnar1 receptor did not evoke any detectable IFN-type response. In a cell survival assay, up to 100 pm Epo failed to lower the cytopathic effects of either VSV or EMCV (Fig. 2). Remarkably, however, the expression of the EpoR/Ifnar1 chimera reduced the survival of IFN-α2-treated cells challenged with viruses. The extent of this effect correlated with the expression level of the chimeric receptor as it was more pronounced in cl.6 than in cl.12. Protection against VSV infection was more affected than protection against EMCV (Fig. 2). Conversely, the survival of IFN-β-treated cells was not significantly altered by the expression of the chimera. These results demonstrate an interference by the chimeric receptor on the antiviral activity of IFN-α2 via the endogenous IFN receptor complex. The IFN-α/β transcriptional response of 2fTGH cells expressing different levels of EpoR/Ifnar1 was compared by measuring the mRNA levels of two prototypic ISGF3-dependent genes, 6–16and the 69-kDa 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetase (27Decker T. Kovarik P. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1535-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), by a quantitative RT-PCR approach. The ratios of each mRNA level to the GAPDH mRNA level are represented in Fig. 3 as a function of IFN doses, whereby IFN was added for 6 h to the cells. Cl.6, but not cl.12, showed a clear reduction of sensitivity to IFN-α2 as compared with the parental 2fTGH cells (Fig. 3, A and C). Conversely, similar mRNA induction profiles were obtained upon IFN-β treatment of the parental 2fTGH and the EpoR/Ifnar1-expressing clones (Fig. 3, B and D). Having shown that the overexpression of the cytoplasmic domain of Ifnar1 impairs the IFN response, we set out to analyze the potential effect of another cytokine receptor that interacts with Tyk2,i.e. the β1 chain of the IL-12R. We used as a recipient the fibrosarcoma HL116 cells, which contain a luciferase reporter gene under the control of the 6–16 promoter (15Uzé G. Di Marco S. Mouchel-Vielh E. Monneron D. Bandu M.T. Horisberger M.A. Dorques A. Lutfalla G. Mogensen K.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We derived HL116 clones that stably expressed at their cell surface the human IL-12Rβ1, the IL-12Rβ2, or both chains. Clones were regularly monitored by FACS analysis to assess maintenance of the exogenous receptor chain(s) (data not shown). The reconstitution of a functional IL-12 receptor in β1β2-expressing clones was confirmed by the detection of a robust Tyk2 phosphorylation in response to as little as 1 ng/ml IL-12 (data not shown). The IFN-α2 and the IFN-β sensitivity of seven β1-expressing clones (HLβ1), three β2-expressing clones (HLβ2), five β1β2-expressing clones (HLβ1β2), and seven control clones (HL) were measured in a luciferase activity assay following a 6-h treatment with increasing doses of IFN-α2 or IFN-β (Fig. 4 A, left panel). At least five experiments were performed with each clone, using the HL116 cells as wild type standard (see “Experimental Procedures”). Although the IFN-α2 sensitivity of the β2-expressing clones and of the control HL clones was similar to that of HL116 cells, the IFN-α2 sensitivity of the β1-expressing clones or of the β1β2-expressing clones was 2-to-6-fold lower than that of the HL116 cells. On the other hand, the IFN-β sensitivity was not significantly down-modulated by the expression of the β1 chain (Fig. 4 A, right panel) or of both the β1 and β2 chains (data not shown). Further analyses were carried out on a control clone (HL-cl.3) and a β1-expressing clone (HLβ1-cl.6) whose level of surface β1 expression is shown in Fig. 7 B. The IFN-α2 and IFN-β sensitivities of these cells were compared by measuring the induction of the 6–16 and 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetase mRNA by quantitative RT-PCR. A reduced response to IFN-α2 was observed in the β1-expressing clone compared with the control clone, whereas the IFN-β sensitivity appeared not to be affected (Fig. 4, Band C). Having shown that the ectopic expression of the EpoR/Ifnar1 chimera or of the IL-12Rβ1 chain interfered with the IFN-α2-induced transcriptional response, it was of interest to determine whether the activation of Jak/STAT pathway components was concomitantly affected. For this, the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1, STAT2, and STAT3 was monitored in the clones expressing the EpoR/Ifnar1 chimera with respect to the parental cells (Fig. 5 A). In EpoR/Ifnar1 cl.6 treated with IFN-α, a marked reduction of phosphorylation of the three STAT proteins was observed. In EpoR/Ifnar1 cl.12, the reduction was less pronounced. Although a reduction of phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 by IFN-β was observed in cl.6 and in cl.12 (Fig. 5 A), the residual activated fraction is likely to account for the normal transcriptional response of these cells to IFN-β (see Fig. 3, B and D). Interestingly, the more drastic reduction was consistently observed for STAT3. A similar analysis was performed with two β1-expressing clones and the control clone. As shown in Fig. 6 A, STAT3, STAT1, and to a lesser extent, STAT2 phosphorylation was reduced in the β1 clones treated with IFN-α. The reduction was most evident in HLβ1-cl.6 (at 100 pm IFN-α, 5-fold and 2-fold reduction for STAT1 and STAT2, respectively). Conversely, in cells treated with IFN-β, the only consistent reduction in phosphorylation was observed for STAT3. Altogether, these results demonstrate that in the presence of either the Epo/Ifnar1 chimera or the IL-12Rβ1 chain, the IFN-α signaling pathway is less competent as a result of interference at the level of STAT activation. Next, we analyzed the extent of Tyk2 and Jak1 activation by IFN-α in cells expressing the exogenous receptors. In EpoR/Ifnar1 clones, a dose-dependent reduction of Tyk2 and Jak1 phosphorylation was observed with respect to 2fTGH cells. Consistently, the effect was more marked for cl.6 (Fig. 5 B). Similar results were obtained with the IL-12Rβ1-expressing clones compared with the control clone (Fig. 6 B). Interestingly, the non-induced level of phosphorylated Tyk2 was augmented in β1-expressing cells, most likely as a consequence of its constitutive association with the IL-12Rβ1 chain. These results demonstrate that the interference observed is due to a reduced level of activation of the Jak kinases associated with the IFN receptor. In human cells, Tyk2 has been shown to contribute to IFN-α signaling not only as a tyrosine kinase but also as an intrinsic component of the IFN-α receptor complex involved in sustaining the level of Ifnar1 and ensuring the high affinity binding of IFN-α (18Gauzzi M.C.

Fellous M. Pellegrini S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24723-24729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). On this basis, we asked whether the presence of the EpoR/Ifnar1 chimera or of the IL-12Rβ1 (via their interaction with Tyk2) could affect the level of the endogenous Ifnar1 protein. Indeed, FACS analysis showed a reduced surface Ifnar1 level in the EpoR/Ifnar1 cl.6 with respect to the EpoR/Ifnar1 cl.12 and the parental cells, whereas the Ifnar2 levels were unchanged (Fig. 7 A). Ifnar1 surface levels were also analyzed in the two β1-expressing clones and the control clone. An average 2-fold reduction of Ifnar1 was detected in the β1-expressing clones as compared with the control clone. Ifnar1 staining was higher in the control clone (HL-cl.3 in Fig. 7 B) as compared with 2fTGH (Fig. 7 A) because of the use of a more reactive mAb (25Goldman L.A. Zafari M. Cutrone E.C. Dang A. Brickelmeier M. Runkel L. Benjamin C.D. Ling L.E. Langer J.A. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1999; 19: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and a biotin-streptavidin amplification step (see “Experimental Procedures”). Since Tyk2 is the only element shared among the endogenous IFN receptor, the Epo/Ifnar1 chimera, and the IL-12Rβ1 chain, the observed cross-interference may result from titration of the kinase. To verify this hypothesis, we tested whether stable overexpression of Tyk2 in β1-expressing cells (HLβ1-cl.6) could relieve the defect. Two clones, T1 and T6, expressing a 4.5-fold higher Tyk2 level than control C1 and C2 clones (Fig. 8 A), were tested for their IFN-α sensitivity and for the level of surface Ifnar1. As shown in Fig. 8 B, a significant increase in luciferase inducibility was observed in T1 and T6 with respect to the control clones or to the parental HL116. The level of surface Ifnar1 was increased approximately 2-fold, whereas the level of Ifnar2 was left unchanged (Fig. 8 C). Thus, an increase in the Tyk2 level appears to relieve the impairment of IFN-α signaling caused by the presence of the IL-12Rβ1 receptor. Integration of signals emanating from cytokine receptors is critical to the coordinate regulation of the complex cytokine network. A number of molecular mechanisms have been described to date. The existence of shared subunits among heteromeric-type receptors represents a major source of cross-competition between different ligands (3Kishimoto T. Taga T. Akira S.

Dendritic cells (DC), central players of the immune system, express several aspartic proteases that are important for DC function. In the present study, we demonstrate that all of the HIV-1 protease inhibitors tested affect DC maturation. In addition, saquinavir had a strong inhibitory effect on the T-cell stimulatory capacity of mature DC. In contrast, indinavir had only a slight effect on DC induced T-cell proliferation and allowed efficient transduction of DC with a replication-incompetent HIV-1 vector designed for DC-based immunotherapy. HIV-1 protease inhibitors that have little or no effect on DC function may be preferable for combination with immunotherapy for HIV/AIDS."

Besides the DNA-binding domain, Fos and Jun contain a leucine zipper motif, consisting of a heptad repeat, denoted (abcdefg)n, with hydrophobic residues at positionsa and d involved in the dimer interface with five Leu residues spaced periodically along the polypeptide chain at every seventh position (3McLachlan A.D.

This heptad repeat motif has received considerable attention over the past decade because of its fundamental role in determining the activity of eukaryotic transcription factors. The binding orientation of the Fos/Jun heterodimer to palindromic AP-1 regulator elements is believed to be controlled by indirect recognition of differences in DNA structure between flanking sequences on opposite sides of the AP-1 site (5Ramirez-Carrozzi V.R.

Nature. 1995; 373: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar) studies have shown that the leucine zipper is formed from two parallel coiled-coil α-helices, which wrap around each other with a slightly left-handed super-helical twist. The presence of Leu at positiond is highly conserved among leucine zippers (11Harbury P.B. Zhang T. Kim P.S. Alber T. Science. 1993; 262: 1401-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar). Other amino acid residues, such as Glu and Lys, at positions e andg are capable of forming inter-helical salt bridges, whereas residues at position b, c, and f are distal to the dimer interface and solvent-exposed (12Yu Y.H. Monera O.D. Hodges R.S. Privalov P.L. J. Biophys. Chem. 1996; 59: 299-314Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 13Kohn W.D. Kay C.M. Hodges R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 1039-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The hydrophobic effect provides one of the primary forces in the formation of coiled-coil polypeptides. Electrostatic interactions between solvent-exposed surface regions of the polypeptide are usually weak and contribute little to stability (14Pace C.N. Laurents D.V. Thomson J.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2564-2572Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Inter-helical salt bridges, as found in Fos/Jun heterodimers, can contribute to the coiled-coil stability (9O'Shea E.K. Rutkowski R. Stafford W.F.D. Kim P.S. Science. 1989; 245: 646-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 10Glover J.N.M. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). However, this structural contribution depends on the hydrophobicity of the amino acid residues in the microenvironment of these charge interactions. Partially non-aqueous solvent conditions favor salt bridge formation with leucine zippers, with salt bridges tending to reduce further the solvent accessibility of the hydrophobic core. The e and g positions of the Fos leucine zipper mainly contain negatively charged residues, whereas at these positions the Jun leucine zipper contains positively charged residues. Because the Fos/Jun heterodimer exhibits higher stability compared with the Fos/Fos or Jun/Jun homodimers, electrostatic attractions have been proposed (9O'Shea E.K. Rutkowski R. Stafford W.F.D. Kim P.S. Science. 1989; 245: 646-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 15O'Shea E.K. Rutkowski R. Kim P.S. Cell. 1992; 68: 699-708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) as the primary driving force for the in vivo heterodimerization of these polypeptides. However, recent NMR studies (7Junius F.K. Weiss A.S. King G.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 8Junius F.K. O'Donoghue S.I. Nilges M. Weiss A.S. King G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13663-13667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) have shown that at acidic pH values intermolecular electrostatic interactions in the homodimer are largely ablated; yet stable dimers still form. Furthermore, at acidic pH values the Tm value for the Fos/Jun heterodimer actually increases (15O'Shea E.K. Rutkowski R. Kim P.S. Cell. 1992; 68: 699-708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). In this investigation, the stability in non-polar environments of several recombinant polypeptides, corresponding to the leucine zipper regions of human c-Fos (residues Leu161–Ala199) and c-Jun (residues Arg276–Asn314), has been investigated, allowing the role of interfacial hydrophobic residues in the stabilization of leucine zipper structures to be studied further. With these r1-Fos and r-Jun leucine zipper (LZ) mutant polypeptides, a two Gly residue insert (to allow for greater flexibility) and a Cys residue (to permit disulfide bond formation) were introduced at the N terminus to enable the extent of monomer/dimer formation in different solvent systems to be controlled. For example, the r-JunLZ dimer is known (7Junius F.K. Weiss A.S. King G.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) to adopt a symmetrical coiled-coil structure of parallel α-helices in aqueous solutions. These structures are expected to be stabilized further by the presence of low to intermediate concentrations of acetonitrile (16Kovrigin E.L. Potekhin S.A. Biophys. Chem. 2000; 83: 45-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 17Purcell A.W. Aguilar M.I. Hearn M.T.W. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 2440-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 18Monera O.D. Zhou N.E. Kay C.M. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19218-19227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The introduction of the additional non-native (Gly)2-Cys residues at the N terminus of these recombinant mutants is unlikely to affect α-helix formation but was expected to permit stabilization of the coiled-coil structure. Leucine zipper homodimers containing either small or large hydrophobic residues in positions a or d can produce packing defects at the interface of the two helices, and this can potentially destabilize the coiled-coil structure. If complementary positions on both helices have small hydrophobic residues, these residues cannot interact with each other and result in an increased solvent-accessible region at the hydrophobic interface. Analysis of the tertiary structure of the r-JunLZ homodimer has shown (8Junius F.K. O'Donoghue S.I. Nilges M. Weiss A.S. King G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13663-13667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) that a cavity forms at the dimer interface because of the parallel arrangement of the side chains of the two associating Ala298 residues, resulting from their orientation away from the dimer interface. It has also been found (19Bains N.P.S. Wilce J.A. Heuer K.H. Tunstall M. Mackay J.P. Bennet M.R. Weiss A.S. King G.F. Lett. Pept. Sci. 1997; 4: 67-77Google Scholar) that substitution of the Ala298 residue by Val in the hydrophobic core of the Jun leucine zipper polypeptide can reduce this “packing defect” and thus can significantly affect the oligomerization state of the polypeptide. Mutants in which Ala298 is replaced with a bigger hydrophobic residue,e.g. Val, Ile, or Leu, consequently have higher stability as shown by their thermal melt profiles in CD spectroscopy (20Bains N.P.S. Wilce J.A. Mackay J.P. King G.F. Lett. Pept. Sci. 1999; 6: 381-390Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that the packing defect evident with the Ala298–Jun/Jun homodimer has the biological function to allow fast strand exchange in vivo and to allow the basic domain leucine zipper dimerization to be under kinetic rather than thermodynamic control (8Junius F.K.

All thermometric measurements were performed on a Agilent HP1090 instrument and HP Chemstation (Agilent, Waldbronn, Germany) with polypeptide detection at 215 nm. Acetonitrile (HPLC grade) was obtained from Biolab Scientific Pty. Ltd. (Sydney, Australia) and trifluoroacetic acid from Auspep Pty. Ltd. (Melbourne, Australia). Water was distilled and deionized in a Milli-Q system (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Recombinant polypeptides corresponding to the LZ domain of human c-Jun (Arg276–Asn314; r-JunLZ), c-Fos (residues Leu161–Ala199; r-FosLZ), and the r-JunLZ mutant containing the single amino acid substitution Ala298→ Ile, r-JunA298I LZ, were prepared and purified as described previously (19Bains N.P.S.

The leucine zipper domains contained an additional N-terminal hexapeptide GSMCGG and a non-native C-terminal Tyr residue, whereby the CGG linker facilitated disulfide bond formation of the dimers 2The nomenclature used in this paper for the r-FosLZ and r-JunLZ leucine zipper homo- and heterodimers follows previous literature on disulfide-linked coiled coils where two monomeric coils dimerize to form the stabilized coiled coil and can be contrasted to higher order oligomer formation. and the Tyr residue facilitated UV detection at 280 nm during purification of the recombinant polypeptides. Monomers or dimers of r-FosLZ and r-JunLZ were prepared by incubating the polypeptide at a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml in either (i) 30% ACN, 0.09% trifluoroacetic acid, 69.91% water (v/v/v); (ii) the monomerization buffer (0.2 m DTT, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.3); or (iii) the dimerization buffer (1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mTris-HCl, pH 8.3 (19Bains N.P.S.

An aliquot of 30 μl of the incubates was taken, and the polypeptides were analyzed using a Waters 600/486 analytical HPLC system with TSK-ODS-120 T columns (150 × 4.6 mm inner diameter, Tosoh Corp., Yamaguchi, Japan), packed with 5 μm of octadecyl-silica. The eluents employed were as follows: eluent A, 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in water; eluent B, 0.09% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in 60% (v/v) acetonitrile/water, with a linear gradient of 0–100% B over 60 min. UV detection at 214 nm and a flow rate of 1 ml/min were used. The major peak was collected and analyzed for the monomer/dimer state by ESI-MS. Electrospray mass spectra were generated by using a Micromass platform (II) quadrupole MS with electrospray source and Masslynx NT version 3.2 software (Micromass, Cheshire, UK). The r-FosLZ and r-JunLZ polypeptides in 1:1 (v/v) ACN/water with 3% (v/v) formic acid were infused into the instrument at a speed of 10 μl per min. The ESI-MS data for the r-Fos/r-Jun polypeptides were acquired at 70 °C at 55/50 V for the monomers and at 70/60 V for the dimers, respectively.

Temperature was controlled by immersing these columns in a thermostated column coolant jacket coupled to a recirculating cooler (Colora Messtechnik GmbH, Lorchwutt, Germany). Solutions of the polypeptides were prepared at a concentration between 0.5 and 1 mg/ml in 0.09% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid/water. The sample size varied between 2–25 μg, depending on the k′ value. All data points were derived from at least duplicate measurements. The relative standard deviations of the replicates for the k′ measurements were ≤ ±1%. Similarly, the precision in the temperature measurements was the ≤ ±0.5 K over the studied temperature range.

Metacresol was employed as a low molecular weight standard to ensure that reproducibility and stability of the two-phase system occurred over the complete range of temperatures investigated throughout the duration of the experiments. According to Nernst's law, for a reversible, equilibrium interaction between a polypeptide/protein and an immobilized ligand(s) supported on an inert matrix, the relationship between the equilibrium association constant,Ka, and the mass of the polypeptide in the bound (mS) and free (mM) states can be expressed as shown in Equation 1, Ka=mSVMmMVSEquation 1 where VS and VM are the volume of the immobilized ligand/support material and the volume of the bulk solution, respectively. For a two-phase system, the ratioVS/VM can be represented as the phase ratio, Φ, whereas the ratiomS/mM for a calibrated system of known VS andVM values corresponds to the unitless parameter,k′ (25Hearn M.T.W.

When measured with solid/liquid two-phase systems at equilibrium, k′ can also be expressed in terms ofKa, and thus k′ can be related to the Gibbs free energy change (due to association of the polypeptide Pi with the immobilized non-polar ligands), Δ G a0, for a polypeptide-ligand interaction as shown in Equation 2,k′=Ka×VSVM=Ka×Φ=e(−ΔGa0/RT)×ΦEquation 2 where R is the universal gas constant, andT is the absolute temperature in degrees Kelvin. Similarly, the dependence of the k′ of a polypeptide in association with a non-polar n-alkyl ligand(s) on the temperature,T, for a system of defined phase ratios at constant pressure and solvent composition can be described (25Hearn M.T.W.

At equilibrium, lnKe and lnk′ (where lnk′ is the logarithm of the unitless factor, k′) bear the same formal relationship to the variation in the standard free energy, Δ G a0, for these reversible polypeptide-non-polar ligand interactions. The contribution of the corresponding changes in enthalpy, Δ H a0, and entropy, Δ S a0, to Δ G a0 can moreover be quantitatively evaluated from Equation 4,ΔGa0=ΔHa0−TΔSa0Equation 4 Isothermic processes are expected for rigid organic molecules, amino acids, or small peptides, which have no well developed secondary structure and little or no possibility to change their hydrophobic contact areas in association with non-polar ligands at different temperatures. If the interaction of a polypeptide with the non-polar ligand(s) also involves a simple isothermic process, linear van't Hoff plots, i.e. linear plots of lnk′versus 1/T, are anticipated, with the change in heat capacity for the interaction Δ C p0 = 0, and independent ofT (25, 27, 32). On the other hand, for polypeptides and proteins that undergo conformational or self-association processes at high (or low) temperatures under specified conditions, homothermic or heterothermic processes (25Hearn M.T.W.

With highly stabilized polypeptides or globular proteins, such as cytochrome c, their binding behavior with immobilized non-polar ligands typically follows parabolic van't Hoff dependences (35Melander W.R.

In the current study, the role of interfacial hydrophobic residues in the stabilization of the Jun/Jun homodimer and Fos/Jun heterodimer was chosen for investigation using a new thermometric methodology that permits the interaction thermodynamics of such coiled-coil polypeptide structures to be evaluated. Changes in the secondary structure or dimer assembly of the Fos and Jun leucine zipper polypeptides will alter the hydrophobic contact area of these polypeptides, and this behavior was expected to be reflected in the lnk′ versus 1/Tplots. Prior to undertaking the thermodynamic analyses of the polypeptide-ligand interactions, r-FosLZ and r-JunA298ILZ (TablesI and II) were incubated in different solvent compositions to examine the effect of these conditions on the monomeric or dimeric states of these polypeptides. The incubated samples were then chromatographed under analytical gradient elution RP-HPLC conditions with fractions collected and immediately subjected to ESI-MS (TableIII). Monomeric species were obtained for r-FosLZ and r-JunA298ILZ incubated in the presence of DTT as shown in Fig. 1, A and C,respectively, whereas dimeric species were obtained (Fig. 1,B and D) for r-FosLZ and r-JunA298ILZ when incubated in a EDTA buffer and 30% (v/v) acetonitrile/water. For these leucine zipper polypeptides, the monomeric species eluted later than the dimeric species from the n-octylsilica sorbent, with characteristic retention time shifts toward shorter values following dimerization. For r-FosLZ and r-JunA298ILZ, the decrease in retention time on dimerization was 1.6 and 9.1 min, respectively, under the experimental conditions employed (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fo"

This study was undertaken to evaluate the functional properties of a novel, truncated glycogen-targeting subunit derived from the skeletal muscle isoform GM/RGl and to compare pathways of glycogen metabolism and their regulation in cells with overexpressed targeting subunits and GK. When overexpressed in hepatocytes, truncated GM/RGl (GMΔC) was approximately twice as potent as full-length GM/RGl in stimulation of glycogen synthesis, but clearly less potent than GK or two other native glycogen-targeting subunits, GL and PTG. We also found that cells with overexpressed GMΔC are unique in that glycogen was efficiently degraded in response to lowering of media glucose concentrations, stimulation with forskolin, or a combination of both maneuvers, whereas cells with overexpressed GL, PTG, or GK exhibited impairment in one or both of these glycogenolytic signaling pathways. 2H NMR analysis of purified glycogen revealed that hepatocytes with overexpressed GK synthesized a larger portion of their glycogen from triose phosphates and a smaller portion from tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates than cells with overexpressed glycogen-targeting subunits. Additional evidence for activation of distinct pathways of glycogen synthesis by GK and targeting subunits is provided by the additive effect of co-overexpression of the two types of proteins upon glycogen synthesis and a much larger stimulation of glucose utilization, glucose transport, and lactate production elicited by GK.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 210-214Google Scholar). Overexpression of these proteins in mammalian cells results in stimulation of glycogen synthesis (17Printen J.A. Brady M.J. Saltiel A.R. Science. 1997; 275: 1475-1478Google Scholar, 20Berman H.K. O'Doherty R.M. Anderson P. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26421-26425Google Scholar), but with differential potency and response to regulatory factors, as recently demonstrated in a study comparing the effects of overexpressed PTG, GL, and GM/RGl in isolated hepatocytes (21Gasa R. Jensen P.B. Berman H.K. Brady M.J. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26396-26403Google Scholar). Overexpressed GL was the most effective targeting subunit for stimulation of glycogen synthesis, consistent with its superior capacity to activate glycogen synthase, and cells with overexpressed PTG were least responsive to forskolin as a glycogenolytic stimulus. Interestingly, cells with overexpressed GM/RGlexhibited a modest increase in glycogen storage, but also responded to forskolin by lowering glycogen to levels similar to those of control cells. The relatively weak glycogenic effect of overexpressed GM/RGl may be related to structural differences between this targeting subunit and other family members, most notably its long C-terminal tail containing a putative sarcoplasmic reticulum-binding domain that is absent in other isoforms. The brisk response to forskolin in GM/RGl-overexpressing cells may occur via protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of a serine in its protein phosphatase-1-binding site; this protein kinase A consensus site is lacking in targeting subunits other than GM/RGl (14Newgard C.B. Brady M.J. O'Doherty R.M. Saltiel A.R. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1967-1977Google Scholar).Increased expression of GK in livers of normal rats results in lowering of blood glucose levels and increased glycogen deposition, but these are accompanied by a large increase in circulating triglycerides and fatty acids (8O'Doherty R.M. Lehman D. Telemaque-Potts S. Newgard C.B. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2022-2027Google Scholar). PTG overexpression in livers of normal rats also improves glucose tolerance, but in contrast to GK, does so without perturbing lipid homeostasis (22O'Doherty R.M. Jensen P.B. Anderson P. Jones J.G. Berman H.K. Kearney D. Newgard C.B. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 479-488Google Scholar). However, animals with increased hepatic PTG expression exhibit very high liver glycogen levels after an overnight fast (22O'Doherty R.M. Jensen P.B. Anderson P. Jones J.G. Berman H.K. Kearney D. Newgard C.B. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 479-488Google Scholar), consistent with the poor response of PTG-overexpressing hepatocytes to forskolin and glucagon (20Berman H.K. O'Doherty R.M. Anderson P. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26421-26425Google Scholar, 21Gasa R. Jensen P.B. Berman H.K. Brady M.J. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26396-26403Google Scholar). Furthermore, oral delivery of [13C]glucose to PTG-overexpressing animals and analysis of glycogen/glucose by NMR revealed that the majority of glycogen is synthesized by an indirect pathway (e.g. a pathway other than glucose → glucose-6-P → glucose-1-P → UDP-glucose → glycogen).This study was designed to address two fundamental questions raised by the foregoing work. First, is it possible to design a glycogen-targeting subunit of protein phosphatase-1 that has a potent stimulatory effect on glucose disposal and glycogen deposition while still allowing normal regulation of glycogenolysis in response to catabolic signals? Second, are there differences in the metabolic fate of glucose in cells with overexpressed glycogen-targeting subunits relative to cells with overexpressed GK? In answer to these questions, we show that a truncated form of GM/RGl lacking its long C-terminal tail has a significantly enhanced glycogenic effect compared with native GM/RGl, but with retention of effective glycogenolytic signaling. We have also evaluated pathways of glycogen synthesis in living cells via administration of2H2O and application of NMR (23Jones J.G. Solomon M.A. Cole S.M. Sherry A.D. Malloy C.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: E848-E856Google Scholar) to identify the 2H-labeled carbon atoms in the glucose molecules of purified glycogen. This analysis revealed that overexpression of glycogen-targeting subunits or GK in hepatocytes activates discrete and complementary pathways of glucose disposal.DISCUSSIONHepatic glycogen stores are depleted in all major forms of diabetes (1Magnusson I. Rothman D.L. Katz L.D. Shulman R.G. Shulman G.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1323-1327Google Scholar, 2Cline G.W. Rothman D.L. Magnusson I. Katz L.D. Shulman G.I. J. Clin.

Invest. 1996; 98: 1755-1761Google Scholar). For example, activity-lowering mutations in the glucokinase gene cause maturity-onset diabetes of youth type II, and patients experience a clear decline in liver glycogen stores (3Velho G. Petersen K.F. Perseghin G. Hwang J.H. Rothman D.L. Pueyo M.E. Cline G.W. Froguel P. Shulman G.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1755-1761Google Scholar). Animals with experimental suppression of GK expression in liver exhibit a similar deficit (33Postic C. Shiota M. Niswender K.D. Jetton T.L. Chen Y.J. Moates J.M. Shelton K.D. Lindner J. Cherrington A.D. Magnuson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 305-315Google Scholar). The potential role of glycogen-targeting subunits of protein phosphatase-1 in the pathogenesis of diabetes is less clear (see Ref. 14Newgard C.B. Brady M.J. O'Doherty R.M. Saltiel A.R. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1967-1977Google Scholar for review), in part because genetic analysis of all of the different members of the gene family has not yet been accomplished. However, overexpression of one family member, PTG, stimulates glycogen synthesis and improves glucose disposal without perturbation of lipid homeostasis in rodents (22O'Doherty R.M. Jensen P.B. Anderson P. Jones J.G. Berman H.K. Kearney D. Newgard C.B. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 479-488Google Scholar). Thus, this study continues a line of investigation in our laboratory in which GK and glycogen-targeting subunits are being evaluated as potential therapeutic targets for enhancing hepatic glucose disposal and lowering blood glucose levels in diabetes (14Newgard C.B. Brady M.J. O'Doherty R.M. Saltiel A.R. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1967-1977Google Scholar, 20Berman H.K. O'Doherty R.M. Anderson P. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26421-26425Google Scholar, 21Gasa R. Jensen P.B. Berman H.K. Brady M.J. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26396-26403Google Scholar, 22O'Doherty R.M. Jensen P.B. Anderson P. Jones J.G. Berman H.K. Kearney D. Newgard C.B. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 479-488Google Scholar).This study had two major goals. The first was to compare the metabolic and regulatory properties of hepatocytes overexpressing a truncated form of GM/RGl (GMΔC) with those of cells with overexpressed GK or native glycogen-targeting subunit isoforms. The second was to investigate the distinct pathways by which GK and glycogen-targeting subunits stimulate glycogen synthesis in liver cells. The accomplishment of these goals has led to the following key findings. 1) Cells with overexpressed GMΔC accumulate more glycogen than cells with overexpression of wild-type GM/RGl, but not as much as cells with overexpressed PTG, GL, or GK. 2) The molecules tested can be divided into three classes with regard to responses to glycogenolytic signals. Cells with overexpressed PTG or GLare poorly responsive to lowering of media glucose concentrations or addition of forskolin. GK-overexpressing cells exhibit an intermediate response, with brisk glycogenolysis in response to lowering of media glucose concentrations, but with a poor response to forskolin and no additive response to a combination of low glucose and forskolin. Finally, cells with overexpressed GMΔC are unique in that they activate glycogenolysis in response to lowering of media glucose concentrations, stimulation with forskolin, or a combination of both maneuvers. Thus, overexpression of GMΔC causes significant stimulation of glycogen deposition, but with retention of exquisite sensitivity to nutritional and pharmacological catabolic signals. 3) The difference in sensitivity to glycogenolytic agents of cells with overexpressed GMΔC relative to cells with overexpressed PTG is not reflective of stimulation of different pathways of glycogen synthesis. Thus, analysis of2H2O labeling of glycogen/glucose shows essentially identical patterns for cells with overexpressed GMΔC or PTG at either glucose concentration tested, with major contributions made by the direct pathway and flux from the level of the trichloroacetic acid cycle and a smaller contribution from the triose phosphates. 4) The labeling pattern just described for cells with overexpressed targeting subunits is clearly different from that for cells with overexpressed GK, with a larger contribution of flux from the triose phosphates apparent in GK-overexpressing cells at either glucose concentration. Additional evidence for activation of distinct and complementary pathways of glycogen synthesis by GK and targeting subunit overexpression is provided by the additive effect of the two types of proteins on glycogen synthesis and the much more dramatic stimulation of glucose utilization, glucose uptake, and lactate production caused by overexpression of GK.The mechanism underlying the enhanced glycogenic potency of GMΔC versus native GM/RGl is unknown. Possible explanations include the following. 1) Removal of the C-terminal domain alters the nature of interactions of GM/RGl with protein phosphatase-1 and/or with the protein phosphatase-1 substrates, glycogen synthase, phosphorylase kinase, and glycogen phosphorylase. 2) Removal of the C-terminal domain prevents interaction of GM/RGl with cellular membranes, allowing more of the protein to bind to glycogen. 3) A combination of these possibilities may be the explanation. Consistent with possibility 2, the C-terminal region of GM/RGl contains a patch of hydrophobic amino acids that may mediate binding of the native protein to membranes of the sarcoplasmic reticulum in muscle (34Hubbard M.J. Dent P. Smythe C. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1990; 189: 245-249Google Scholar). Glycogen particles accumulate around the sarcoplasmic reticulum in muscle, suggesting that targeting of key enzymes to this site may be facilitated/guided by GM/RGl. When the native GM/RGl protein is overexpressed in hepatocytes, which lack sarcoplasmic reticulum, this may cause “mistargeting” of GM/RGl to membranes or other cellular sites that are non-ideal environments for glycogen synthesis. In this model, removal of the C terminus of GM/RGl may allow the molecule to target mainly to glycogen, enhancing its stimulatory effect on deposition of the glucose polymer.Another interesting feature of cells with overexpressed GMΔC is their enhanced capacity for response to catabolic stimuli relative to cells with overexpression of other targeting subunits or GK. Native GM/RGl differs from other targeting subunits in that it has two serine-containing consensus sequences for protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation. Indeed, phosphorylation of one of these serines, residing within the known protein phosphatase-1-binding site (serine 67 in the human GM/RGl sequence), has been reported to be stimulated by glycogenolytic agents such as forskolin, resulting in disassociation of protein phosphatase-1 (35Dent P. Lavoinne A. Nakielny S. Watt P. Cohen P. Nature. 1990; 348: 302-308Google Scholar, 36Wu J. Kleiner U. Brautigan D.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13858-13864Google Scholar). Of note is the fact that truncated GMΔC and native GM/RGl share the consensus protein kinase A sites, and their overexpression in hepatocytes results in the same brisk responses to forskolin (Fig. 2). Whether phosphorylation of these sites is sufficient to explain the responses to both the nutritional and pharmacological glycogenolytic signals remains to be tested.This work clearly demonstrates that glycogen-targeting subunits and GK stimulate glycogen accumulation by distinct mechanisms. In the2H2O labeling experiments, the fundamental difference in the glycogen labeling pattern between these groups of cells was the relatively large contribution of carbon from the level of triose phosphates (indicated by labeling of carbon 3 of glucose) in GK-overexpressing cells, which was replaced by a larger portion of labeling from the level of trichloroacetic acid cycle intermediates (indicated by labeling of carbon 6) in cells with overexpressed targeting subunits. Based on these findings and the data of Figs. 6 and7 that demonstrate increased glucose consumption, glucose uptake, and lactate output in GK-overexpressing cells, we propose the following model to explain our results (see Fig.10 for schematic summary). In cells with overexpressed glycogen-targeting subunits, activation of glycogen synthase exerts a pull on the glucose 6-phosphate pool, which in turn activates gluconeogenesis from 2- and 3-carbon precursors and uptake of glucose. Since the medium contained little or no glycerol, fructose, or other immediate precursors of the triose phosphates, the main precursors used for glycogen synthesis under these conditions are likely to be those that pass through the mitochondrial compartment and the fumarase reaction on their way to glucose 6-phosphate,e.g. pyruvate, lactate, and amino acids, all of which are abundant in the culture medium. In cells with overexpressed GK, the glucose 6-phosphate pool is expanded by the increase in glucose phosphorylation (6Seoane J. Gomez-Foix A.M. O'Doherty R.M. Gomez-Ara C. Newgard C.B. Guinovart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23756-23760Google Scholar). A large portion of this glucose 6-phosphate is pushed directly into glycogen, facilitated in part by the known allosteric activation of glycogen synthase by this metabolic intermediate. However, an even larger percentage of the pool enters glycolysis, making the major contribution to the fall in media glucose concentration and the rise in lactate. A portion of this flux apparently represents metabolism of glucose 6-phosphate to the level of the triose phosphates, where labeling at carbon 3 occurs, followed by incorporation of these labeled precursors into glycogen. With the major contributions of the direct (hexose phosphates → glycogen) and modified direct (hexose phosphates → triose phosphates → hexose phosphates→ glycogen) pathways to glycogen synthesis in GK-overexpressing cells, gluconeogenesis from the level of trichloroacetic acid cycle intermediates is not stimulated.What, then, are the implications of our findings for whole animal physiology and diabetes therapy? First, our work establishes that most of the glucose 6-phosphate produced by GK overexpression enters glycolysis, with a far smaller portion contributing to glycogen synthesis. Thus, although GK overexpression will clearly lower circulating glucose concentrations, there will also be undesirable increases in lactate production and lipogenesis, consistent with our previous findings (8O'Doherty R.M. Lehman D. Telemaque-Potts S. Newgard C.B. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2022-2027Google Scholar). In previous studies, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of PTG in normal rats resulted in improved disposal of an oral glucose load relative to controls, with no perturbation of lipid homeostasis (22O'Doherty R.M. Jensen P.B. Anderson P. Jones J.G. Berman H.K. Kearney D. Newgard C.B. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 479-488Google Scholar). However, these animals did not lower their liver glycogen levels in response to fasting, in effect presenting with a phenotype of glycogen storage disease. In this study, we have described a novel, modified glycogen-targeting subunit (GMΔC) that appears to provide substantial stimulation of glycogen accumulation while also allowing the cells to remain sensitive to two different kinds of catabolic signals. It will be of interest to test this targeting isoform in the in vivo setting. Hepatic glucose production is poorly controlled in type II diabetes due to increased gluconeogenesis and impaired glycogen storage (1Magnusson I. Rothman D.L. Katz L.D. Shulman R.G. Shulman G.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1323-1327Google Scholar, 2Cline G.W. Rothman D.L. Magnusson I. Katz L.D. Shulman G.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2369-2376Google Scholar, 3Velho G. Petersen K.F. Perseghin G. Hwang J.H. Rothman D.L. Pueyo M.E. Cline G.W. Froguel P. Shulman G.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1755-1761Google Scholar). The glucose-phosphorylating enzyme glucokinase (GK)1 plays a key role in determining the balance between glucose disposal and production in the liver. Increased expression of GK in hepatoma cells (4Valera A. Bosch F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 533-539Google Scholar), isolated hepatocytes (5O'Doherty R.M. Lehman D.L. Seoane J. Gomez-Foix A.M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 22570-22575Google Scholar) potently affects glucose disposal and glycogen deposition. Conversely, overexpression of key components of the glucose-6-phosphatase enzyme complex, which catalyzes glucose 6-phosphate hydrolysis, causes a sharp reduction in glycogen storage in liver cells (11Seoane J. Trinh K. O'Doherty R. Gomez-Foix A.M. Lange A.J. Newgard C.B. Guinovart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26972-26977Google Scholar, 12Trinh K. O'Doherty R. Anderson P. Lange A.J. Newgard C.B. J. Biol.

Although the control strength of GK in hepatic glucose metabolism is substantial, it has become clear that it is also possible to stimulate glycogen synthesis by expression of proteins that function distal to the glucose phosphorylation step. In particular, recent studies have highlighted an important role for glycogen-targeting subunits of protein phosphatase-1 in spatial organization and regulation of glycogen metabolism (14Newgard C.B. Brady M.J. O'Doherty R.M. Saltiel A.R. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1967-1977Google Scholar). Four members of a gene family encoding these proteins are known. GM or RGl (hereafter referred to as GM/RGl) is expressed primarily in striated skeletal muscle (15Tang P.M. Bondor J.A. Swiderek K.M. DePaoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15782-15789Google Scholar); GL is expressed primarily in liver (16Doherty M.J. Moorhead G. Morrice N. Cohen P. Cohen P.T. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 294-298Google Scholar); and PTG (protein targeting toglycogen) (17Printen J.A. Brady M.J. Saltiel A.R. Science. 1997; 275: 1475-1478Google Scholar, 18Doherty M.J. Young P.R.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 210-214Google Scholar) are expressed in a wide range of tissues. These proteins bind to glycogen and protein phosphatase-1 and have differential capacities for binding to glycogen synthase, glycogen phosphorylase, and phosphorylase kinase (14Newgard C.B. Brady M.J. O'Doherty R.M. Saltiel A.R. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1967-1977Google Scholar, 15Tang P.M. Bondor J.A. Swiderek K.M. DePaoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol.

Several known protein products are encoded by these transcripts; however, no systematic analysis of protein expression in different normal tissues has yet been reported. Recently, two distinct ING1 homologs, one encoding a 33-kDa protein and the other a 5-kDa protein, have been identified in humans and mice, but much less is known about them compared withING1 (9, 19, 20; GenBankTM accession numberAJ006851). 2S.

The metamorphosis of the tadpole to a frog is absolutely dependent upon a substantial increase of endogenous levels of 3,5,3′-triiodothyronine (T3) from undetectable levels in the plasma (27Leloup J. Buscaglia M. C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris Ser. D. 1977; 284: 2261-2263Google Scholar, 28Regard E. Taurog A. Nakashima T. Endocrinology. 1978; 102: 674-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The other TH, thyroxine (T4), also increases, but it is the predominant form transported to target tissues where it is converted to the more active T3 form. Virtually every tissue in the tadpole is a target of TH, and these changes can be precociously induced by exogenous TH administration in vivo and in culture (29Helbing C.C. Gergely G. Atkinson B.G.

TRs have important roles as repressors and activators of gene transcription during Xenopus development (for review see Ref. 43Sachs L.M. Damjanovski S. Jones P.L. Li Q. Amano T. Ueda S. Shi Y.-B. Ishizuya-Oka A. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 2000; 126: 199-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In premetamorphic tadpoles, TRs function as repressors of TH-inducible genes in the absence of appreciable levels of TH thereby preventing precocious metamorphosis. When endogenous TH levels rise, they act as activators of these genes thereby initiating metamorphosis. Thus, the presence or absence of ligand plays a critical role in gene regulation. However, what still remains enigmatic is how TRs can promote the development of multiple cell fates such as proliferation, reprogramming, and apoptosis during metamorphosis. Several factors that modulate TR activity have been described and include HATs/HDACs and p53 (44–56), and it is postulated that tissue-specific factors may modulate the TH-induced outcome (for review see Ref. 43Sachs L.M. Damjanovski S. Jones P.L. Li Q. Amano T. Ueda S. Shi Y.-B. Ishizuya-Oka A. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 2000; 126: 199-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Herein, we describe the isolation, cloning, and initial characterization of the first frog ING2 gene (xING2 for Xenopus ING2) and provide evidence suggesting that xING2 is subject to alternative splicing. We demonstrate that transcript levels differentially increase in response to T3 treatment in tissues with different metamorphic fates. Western blots using an antibody directed against the highly conserved C-terminal end of ING proteins reveal a complex pattern of expression in adult Xenopus tissues. Although premetamorphic tadpole tissues show T3-induced accumulation of ING proteins in the tail, the levels in the leg are not affected. This T3-induced accumulation is also observed in serum-free tail organ cultures and is abrogated by inhibitors of tail apoptosis. Therefore, this work presents the first link between ING expression and a hormonally regulated nuclear transcription factor-mediated response. Because ING proteins appear to associate with chromatin (7Scott M. Boisvert F.-M. Vieyra D. Johnston R.N. Bazett-Jones D.P. Riabowol K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2052-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar),5 we speculate that ING family members may be involved with the modulation of thyroid hormone receptor activity and may be a link to tissue-specificity of the TH-induced response. Total RNA was isolated from various tissues using TRIzol (Life Technologies, Burlington, Ontario, Canada) following the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA libraries were made from poly(A)+ mRNA isolated from Xenopus tadpole brain and tail using the Marathon cDNA amplification kit for 5′ and 3′ RACE (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The initial RACE reactions used the AP1 primer supplied with the kit (5′-CCATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC) paired with either the H2 gene-specific primer (5′-CATAGGAGACCTGGTTGCACAGACAGT) from the human sequence that spans the beginning of the PHD finger domain for 5′ RACE or the reverse and complement, H1 (5′-ACTGTCTGTGCAACCAGGTCTCCTATG), for 3′ RACE. Primer design was accomplished using Primer Premier software (Premier Biosoft International, Palo Alto, CA). Touchdown PCR was performed for all the RACE-PCR reactions (five cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 72° for 3–6 min; five cycles at 94 °C for 30 s and 70 °C for 3–6 min; and 25 cycles at 94 °C for 20 s and 68 °C for 3–6 min) as per the manufacturer's instructions (CLONTECH). Different primers were used for the second round of amplification. For 3′ RACE, the frog primer (5′-CGTGTTTCGTATCGGTATTGCT-3′) and AP1 adaptor-specific primer were used at 20 pmol per reaction on theXenopus brain and tail cDNA libraries. The PCR cycling conditions were 5 min at 94 °C followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 62 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C, plus 10 min at 72 °C. For 5′ RACE, the frog primer (5′-GGTACTCCTCCACATAGCTCACCAGTT-3′) and AP1 adaptor-specific primer were used as above except 10 pmol per reaction was used. The PCR reactions were run on 1% agarose gels and transferred to Nytran Plus membrane (Mandel Scientific Co. Ltd., Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) using a VacuGene XL vacuum blotting apparatus (Amersham Biosciences, Inc., Baie d'Urfe, Quebec, Canada). The transfer was carried out as described in Protocol no. 1 supplied by the manufacturer, except that the membrane was UV cross-linked in a UV Stratalinker 2400 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) immediately after transfer to immobilize the DNA. The membranes were hybridized overnight with a human ING1 cDNA exon 2 fragment, and bands were detected with CDP-Star reagent using AlkPhos Direct Kit reagents (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Those PCR reactions found to be positive for frog INGsequences through Southern blotting were used directly in cloning or, in the case of 3′ RACE reactions, were first purified with a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). The TOPO TA Cloning Kit Dual Promoter System with PCR II-TOPO vector and TOP10 cells (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands) was used for ligation and bacterial transformation as suggested by the supplier using 2 μl of PCR products for the reaction. The potentially positive clones were picked for creation of liquid stocks in LB broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin (Sigma-Aldrich, Oakville, Ontario, Canada) and subsequently spotted onto nitrocellulose Trans Blot Transfer Medium (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). These membranes were placed on LB plates with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and grown overnight at 37 °C. The bacteria were then lysed on the membrane by placement on filter paper with 0.5 m NaOH for 5 min, 1 mTris-HCl, pH 8.0, for 5 min, and 0.5 m Tris (pH 8.0)/1.25m NaCl 5 min. The DNA was UV cross-linked to the nitrocellulose as described previously and then washed with 2× SSC/2% SDS followed by 2× SSC. The membranes were hybridized with humanING1 cDNA probe as described above but for only 1 h prior to the detection with CDP-Star reagent. Positive clones were used to inoculate 5-ml cultures of LB broth with 100 μg/ml ampicillin, which were grown overnight at 37 °C with shaking. Plasmids were harvested with a Qiaprep Spin Miniprep kit (Qiagen) and subsequently digested with EcoRI. A 1% agarose gel was used to separate the inserts from plasmid vector, and the products were Southern-blotted overnight as described previously. Positive clones were then sequenced. The DNA and derived amino acid sequences were aligned using ClustalW version 1.8 software (57Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55721) Google Scholar). Analyses of RNA transcripts was done according to the method described in a previous study (58Helbing C.C. Wellington C.L. Gogela-Spehar M. Cheng T. Pinchbeck G. Johnston R.N. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1491-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) using the frog ING2 ORF fragment or a human 300-bp ING1 PCR fragment from exon 2. This latter fragment has limited sequence identity to frog ING2 and under the hybridization conditions used, does not cross-hybridize with ING2 transcripts. To determine the relative expression levels of xING2 transcripts, RT-PCR analyses were performed. The primers spanning the putative exon 1/2 boundary (XB5/XB8) and within the putative exon 2 (XB9/XB10) are indicated below in Fig. 1 and yield amplicons of 635 and 253 bp, respectively. All reactions were determined to be in the linear range of amplification and normalized to L8 ribosomal protein transcript whose expression is not affected by T3 treatment (59Shi Y. Liang V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1217: 227-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). For amplification of control L8 ribosomal protein transcript, the sense primer (5′-CAGGGGACAGAGAAAAGGTG-3′) and antisense primer (5′-ACGACGAGCAGCAATAAGAC-3′) were used to generate a 700-bp amplicon. The levels of TRα and TRβ transcripts were determined by amplifying 480 and 342 bp amplicons, respectively. For TRα the sense primer (5′-CACTACCGCTGTATCACTTG-3′) and antisense primer (5′-GGGTGATTATCTTGGTGAACT-3′) were used (60Yaoita Y. Shi Y. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7090-7094Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). For TRβ the sense primer (5′-CCAGTGCCAAGAATGTCG-3′) and antisense primer (5′-GTAAACTGGCTGAAGGCT-3′) were used (60Yaoita Y. Shi Y. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7090-7094Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). All primers were used at 20 pmol in a typical 50-μl reaction containing 1.5 units ofTaq DNA polymerase (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), 10 nmol of dNTPs (Life Technologies), and 1.5 mm MgCl2. The PCR reaction was: 7 min at 94 °C, 35 cycles of 60 s at 94 °C, 60 s at 55 °C (for TRα, TRβ, and L8) or 54 °C (for xING2 primers), and 1 min at 72 °C. A final 10-min extension at 72 °C was done. The L8 reaction was the same except only 30 cycles were used. The amplified products were separated on 2% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Tissue samples were obtained fresh and homogenized immediately in 3 ml/g tissue of 50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 2.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 units/ml aprotinin, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, and 1 mm dithiothreitol and processed as described previously (58Helbing C.C. Wellington C.L. Gogela-Spehar M. Cheng T. Pinchbeck G. Johnston R.N. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1491-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Protein samples were resolved by electrophoresis through 5–15% gradient SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane as was previously described (58Helbing C.C. Wellington C.L. Gogela-Spehar M. Cheng T. Pinchbeck G. Johnston R.N. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1491-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Western blot analyses were performed using a rabbit polyclonal antibody generated using a human GST-ING1 C-terminal end fusion protein (1Garkavtsev I. Kazarov A. Gudkov A. Riabowol K. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) using methods described previously (58Helbing C.C. Wellington C.L. Gogela-Spehar M. Cheng T. Pinchbeck G. Johnston R.N. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1491-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, blocking was performed overnight at 4 °C in PBS containing 5% skim milk, 2% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies), and 0.1% v/v Tween 20 in PBS, pH 7.2. The polyclonal antibody was used at a 1:10,000 dilution in blocking buffer. The antibody incubation was carried out at room temperature for 1 h. Membranes were washed extensively in PBS with 0.1% v/v Tween 20 for 10 min and incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG polyclonal antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA). Peroxidase activity was detected by using an ECL kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Binding specificity was determined by comparison of unblocked antibody with antibody incubated with GST only or blocked with GST-p33ING1b. As a positive control, we have confirmed that this antibody can recognize bacterially expressed xING2 protein (data not shown). Premetamorphic (NF stage 50–54 (61Nieuwkoop P.D. Faber J. Normal Table of Xenopus laevis. North Holland Publishing, Amsterdam1956Google Scholar)) Xenopus laevis tadpoles were immersed in dechlorinated tap water at 25 °C to which 3,5,3′-triiodothyronine (T3; Sigma-Aldrich) was added at the indicated concentrations dissolved in Me2SO (ACP Chemicals Inc., St. Leonard, Quebec, Canada). Control animals had an equal volume of Me2SO added to their water. The tadpoles were sacrificed at the indicated times after treatment for the isolation of RNA or protein as described above. Tadpoles were anesthetized in 0.1% MS222 (Syndel Laboratories, Vancouver, BC) and quickly immersed (5 s each) in a series of sterile water, 70% ethanol, and two more beakers of sterile water. The tails were severed under aseptic conditions with a sterile scalpel and placed into culture dishes containing culture medium. The culture medium consisted of a 55% dilution of 1× alpha minimal essential medium (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Costa Mesa, CA), pH 7.2, supplemented with 14.5 mm NaCl, 1.1 mm Na2HPO4, 1.1 mmNaH2PO4, 2 mml-glutamine, 1 mml-methionine, 25 mm HEPES, 10 μg/ml fungizone, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin sulfate. The cultures were incubated at 25 °C under air, and the medium was changed daily. The tails were allowed to recover overnight before the addition of 100 nm T3 with or without 2 mm EGTA, pH 8.0 (Sigma-Aldrich), which has previously been shown to inhibit tail regression (62Phillips M.E. Platt J.E. Gen. Compar. Endocrinol. 1994; 95: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Using a gene-specific primer from the conserved region 5′ to the region encoding the PHD finger of human ING1, we isolated multiple clones fromX. laevis tadpole brain and tail that bear closest sequence homology to ING2 identified in human (19, 20; GenBankTM accession number AJ006851)2 and mouse (GenBankTM accession number A"
https://openalex.org/W2035472302,"Cα-formylglycine is the key catalytic residue in the active site of sulfatases. In eukaryotes formylglycine is generated during or immediately after sulfatase translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum by oxidation of a specific cysteine residue. We established an in vitro assay that allowed us to measure formylglycine modification independent of protein translocation. The modifying enzyme was recovered in a microsomal detergent extract. As a substrate we used ribosome-associated nascent chain complexes comprising in vitro synthesized sulfatase fragments that were released from the ribosomes by puromycin.

Only the serine but not the cysteine system involves an iron–sulfur protein, termed AtsB in K. pneumoniae (9Szameit C. Miech C. Balleininger M. Schmidt B. von Figura K. Dierks T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15375-15381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). It must still to be clarified whether AtsB represents the modifying enzyme or merely a specific cofactor.In eukaryotes, the modifying machinery is also unknown. FGly is generated by oxidation of a conserved cysteine residue encoded by the sulfatase genes. During synthesis of sulfatases this cysteine is incorporated into the nascent polypeptide (16Dierks T. Schmidt B. von Figura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11963-11968Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). It is converted to FGly during or shortly after protein translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), as could be shown in an in vitrotranslation/translocation system comprising import-competent dog pancreas microsomes (16Dierks T. Schmidt B. von Figura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11963-11968Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 17Dierks T. Lecca M.R. Schmidt B. von Figura K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 423: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The FGly modification is directed by an autonomous linear sequence motif (CXPSRXXX(L/M)TG(R/K/L)) that is located within the N-terminal 80–120 amino acid residues of the sulfatases,i.e. 60–100 residues downstream of the signal peptidase cleavage site (18Dierks T. Lecca M.R. Schlotterhose P. Schmidt B. von Figura K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2084-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Using ribosome-associated nascent chain complexes (RNCs) we could show that, in an arrested translocation intermediate, the cysteine 69 of ASA was accessible inside the microsomes, as evidenced by N-glycosylation of an engineered glycosylation site at position 87; however, FGly formation (and also signal peptide cleavage) was observed only after release of the nascent chain from the ribosome by puromycin (16Dierks T. Schmidt B. von Figura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11963-11968Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Thus, FGly modification occurs after or at a late stage of protein translocation. Short sulfatase sequences (16 residues) comprising the modification motif were sufficient for FGly generation even when inserted into a heterologous polypeptide background, indicating that the modification does not depend on folding of sulfatases but rather occurs as long as the newly synthesized polypeptide is largely unfolded (16Dierks T. Schmidt B. von Figura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11963-11968Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 17Dierks T. Lecca M.R. Schmidt B. von Figura K.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2084-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar).Until now FGly modification could only be studied in intact microsomal membranes, i.e. coupled to cotranslational protein translocation. Investigating FGly formation independent of translocation and, if possible, independent of intact ER membranes would be the first step toward a biochemical description of the enzymatic machinery involved and eventually could allow to identify this machinery after chromatographic purification. Here we describe the development of such an assay system and its application to elucidate basic aspects of FGly modification.DISCUSSIONThe aim of this study was to establish an in vitroassay system that makes possible the measurement of FGly formation independent of protein translation and translocation by using microsomal detergent extracts as a source for the FGly-generating activity. Such an assay system is the basis for a biochemical characterization and, eventually, identification of the modifying enzyme.Toward this goal we developed a suitable [35S]methionine-labeled sulfatase polypeptide substrate that was translated in vitro by an mRNA-programmed reticulocyte lysate. To uncouple FGly modification from translation we used RNC technology that allowed us to isolate nascent sulfatase polypeptides from the translation system by sedimentation of ribosomes through a high salt sucrose cushion. The polypeptides of these salt-washed RNCs could be successfully targeted to and translocated by intact microsomes, as evidenced by signal peptide cleavage and FGly modification after addition of puromycin (Fig. 2 A). FGly modification also was observed when microsomal membranes, carrying targeted RNCs, were treated with detergent prior to the puromycin chase (not shown). These findings showed that FGly formation may occur independent of translation and does not strictly require an intact microsomal membrane.To further exclude a possible role of the translocon we had to uncouple FGly modification from both translation and translocation. This was achieved when incubating salt-washed RNCs with a fully solubilized microsomal detergent extract. Upon addition of puromycin, highly efficient FGly modification was observed (Fig. 2 B). In fact the modification efficiency was about 4-fold higher than that observed in a coupled translocation/modification assay using intact microsomes. This indicates that a process upstream of FGly modification (e.g. protein translocation) is the limiting step in thein vitro system using intact microsomes.In intact microsomes we had been unable to temporally separate FGly formation from signal peptide cleavage (16Dierks T. Schmidt B. von Figura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11963-11968Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, using a detergent extract as an enzyme source, we found that FGly modification was independent of the presence of a signal sequence at the substrate's N terminus. Thus, the signal peptide, at least when microsomal membranes are solubilized, is not involved in maintaining a modification competent state of the adjacent mature polypeptide sequence. The cysteine to be modified in the employed substrate polypeptide is located only nine residues C-terminal of the signal peptide cleavage site. This finding does not rule out that the signal peptide plays a role in vivo by anchoring the N terminus in the membrane.The attachment of the sulfatase nascent chain to the ribosome via the C-terminal tRNA (non-released conditions, Fig. 3) largely impaired FGly formation, because the modification was mainly found in the ribosome-released polypeptides. Thus, non-released chains obviously are difficult to modify, albeit the cysteine 69, which has a distance of 89 residues to the C terminus, is accessible outside the ribosome (see the introduction and Ref. 16Dierks T. Schmidt B. von Figura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11963-11968Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This does not necessarily mean that FGly formation only occurs posttranslationally, i.e. after completion of translation/translocation, because we analyzed a translation intermediate artificially arrested at the ribosome after synthesis of only 30% of the entire sulfatase protein. On the other hand, FGly formation indeed occurred under strictly posttranslational conditions, when the detergent extract was incubated with ribosome-free substrate polypeptides, i.e. after their release from the ribosomes by puromycin and removal of ribosomes (Fig. 3). However, the modification efficiency was doubled, when the substrate polypeptides were released concomitant to the addition of the microsomal extract. Thus, FGly formation obviously is optimal immediately after releasing the nascent polypeptide from the ribosome, as may be the case in vivo at a late cotranslational or early posttranslational step of protein translocation. Hence, ribosome/translocon association may assist in maintaining a modification competent state of the sulfatase polypeptide.The FGly-modifying machinery consists of soluble component(s) of the ER lumen, as could be shown by differential extraction of microsomes with low concentrations of detergent. Under conditions that extract the luminal proteins but leave the membrane proteins in the membrane fraction, almost all FGly-forming activity was recovered in the soluble fraction. Accordingly, after reconstitution of membranes by detergent removal (dialysis) from a fully solubilized detergent extract, the FGly-generating activity was not associated with the membranes (proteoliposomes) but with the non-reconstituted soluble proteins.Kinetic characterization of the FGly-forming activity in the reticuloplasm revealed typical enzymatic properties with a characteristic temperature dependence (activation energy 61 kJ/mol) and strong inhibition by a synthetic peptide comprising the modification motif (IC50 135 nm). This IC50value may be taken as a figure of the enzyme's substrate affinity constant. A true K m value could not be determined by saturation studies, because we had to use in vitrosynthesized substrate polypeptides (≈0.15 nm). At this low substrate concentration pre-steady-state conditions may prevail with binding (and not catalysis) being the rate-limiting step. The slow kinetics observed (1% turnover in 20 min per equivalent of cow pancreas microsomes) may reflect this limitation or, alternatively, may indicate a very low abundance of the modifying machinery in the reticuloplasm.This machinery shows some characteristics that are not unexpected for an enzyme residing in the lumen of the ER. It is stimulated by calcium ions (Fig. 6) and is sensitive to the SH/SS-redox milieu (Table I). High concentrations of GSH but also moderate concentrations of GSSG inhibited FGly formation. Optimum conditions were observed at 2.5 mm GSH or dithiothreitol indicating that these thiols are required to prevent oxidation of the enzyme's cysteines. The substrate's cysteine obviously was not affected in these experiments, because only pretreatment of reticuloplasm with dithiothreitol led to stimulation of FGly modification activity, whereas pretreatment of RNCs with dithiothreitol had no or a partial inhibitory effect (not shown). Passing the reticuloplasm through a gel filtration column did not reduce its specific modifying activity (in the presence of dithiothreitol and Ca2+), suggesting that no diffusible low molecular weight cofactor is required for in vitro FGly formation. More specifically, a possible role of GSSG as a cofactor that is directly involved in cysteine oxidation is highly unlikely. However, we cannot definitely exclude that GSH/GSSG is required to maintain a redox potential favoring cysteine oxidation.The pH dependence of modification, however, was rather surprising. Its high alkaline pH optimum (10.0–10.5) is difficult to explain. It may reflect that OH− ions play a role, as could be envisaged if FGly formation occurs in two steps, namely an enzyme-mediated oxidation of the cysteine's thiol to a thioaldehyde group (–CH=S) that subsequently is spontaneously hydrolyzed to eliminate H2S and yield FGly (see also Refs. 5Schmidt B. Selmer T. Ingendoh A. von Figura K. Cell. 1995; 82: 271-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar and 8Dierks T. Miech C. Hummerjohann J. Schmidt B. Kertesz M.A. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25560-25564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The hydrolytic step may be stimulated by alkaline pH. Thus, the broad pH profile observed (Fig. 5 E) may represent a composite pH optimum curve of the oxidation and the hydrolytic step, the latter being rate limiting at low pH and the former being rate limiting at high pH. To test for this hypothesis, we chilled a 20 min/37 °C modification reaction on ice, shifted its pH from 7.5 to 10.5, and prolonged the incubation for another 20 min at 0 °C. This treatment, however, did not increase the modification efficiency as compared with non-shifted or non-prolonged control samples (data not shown). Thus, the OH−-stimulated step obviously requires 37 °C. Such a step theoretically could be a slow conversion of cysteine to dehydroalanine by H2S elimination. This reaction intermediate may be generated enzymatically at neutral and non-enzymatically at high alkaline pH. However, as conversion of dehydroalanine to FGly most likely would have to include serine as a second intermediate, a residue that in ASA-C69S can be modified neitherin vivo nor in vitro (11Recksiek M.

Schmidt B. von Figura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11963-11968Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 17Dierks T. Lecca M.R. Schmidt B. von Figura K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 423: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The FGly modification is directed by an autonomous linear sequence motif (CXPSRXXX(L/M)TG(R/K/L)) that is located within the N-terminal 80–120 amino acid residues of the sulfatases,i.e. 60–100 residues downstream of the signal peptidase cleavage site (18Dierks T. Lecca M.R. Schlotterhose P. Schmidt B. von Figura K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2084-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Using ribosome-associated nascent chain complexes (RNCs) we could show that, in an arrested translocation intermediate, the cysteine 69 of ASA was accessible inside the microsomes, as evidenced by N-glycosylation of an engineered glycosylation site at position 87; however, FGly formation (and also signal peptide cleavage) was observed only after release of the nascent chain from the ribosome by puromycin (16Dierks T. Schmidt B. von Figura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11963-11968Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Thus, FGly modification occurs after or at a late stage of protein translocation. Short sulfatase sequences (16 residues) comprising the modification motif were sufficient for FGly generation even when inserted into a heterologous polypeptide background, indicating that the modification does not depend on folding of sulfatases but rather occurs as long as the newly synthesized polypeptide is largely unfolded (16Dierks T. Schmidt B. von Figura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11963-11968Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 17Dierks T. Lecca M.R. Schmidt B. von Figura K.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2084-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Until now FGly modification could only be studied in intact microsomal membranes, i.e. coupled to cotranslational protein translocation. Investigating FGly formation independent of translocation and, if possible, independent of intact ER membranes would be the first step toward a biochemical description of the enzymatic machinery involved and eventually could allow to identify this machinery after chromatographic purification. Here we describe the development of such an assay system and its application to elucidate basic aspects of FGly modification. DISCUSSIONThe aim of this study was to establish an in vitroassay system that makes possible the measurement of FGly formation independent of protein translation and translocation by using microsomal detergent extracts as a source for the FGly-generating activity. Such an assay system is the basis for a biochemical characterization and, eventually, identification of the modifying enzyme.Toward this goal we developed a suitable [35S]methionine-labeled sulfatase polypeptide substrate that was translated in vitro by an mRNA-programmed reticulocyte lysate. To uncouple FGly modification from translation we used RNC technology that allowed us to isolate nascent sulfatase polypeptides from the translation system by sedimentation of ribosomes through a high salt sucrose cushion. The polypeptides of these salt-washed RNCs could be successfully targeted to and translocated by intact microsomes, as evidenced by signal peptide cleavage and FGly modification after addition of puromycin (Fig. 2 A). FGly modification also was observed when microsomal membranes, carrying targeted RNCs, were treated with detergent prior to the puromycin chase (not shown). These findings showed that FGly formation may occur independent of translation and does not strictly require an intact microsomal membrane.To further exclude a possible role of the translocon we had to uncouple FGly modification from both translation and translocation. This was achieved when incubating salt-washed RNCs with a fully solubilized microsomal detergent extract. Upon addition of puromycin, highly efficient FGly modification was observed (Fig. 2 B). In fact the modification efficiency was about 4-fold higher than that observed in a coupled translocation/modification assay using intact microsomes. This indicates that a process upstream of FGly modification (e.g. protein translocation) is the limiting step in thein vitro system using intact microsomes.In intact microsomes we had been unable to temporally separate FGly formation from signal peptide cleavage (16Dierks T. Schmidt B. von Figura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11963-11968Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, using a detergent extract as an enzyme source, we found that FGly modification was independent of the presence of a signal sequence at the substrate's N terminus. Thus, the signal peptide, at least when microsomal membranes are solubilized, is not involved in maintaining a modification competent state of the adjacent mature polypeptide sequence. The cysteine to be modified in the employed substrate polypeptide is located only nine residues C-terminal of the signal peptide cleavage site. This finding does not rule out that the signal peptide plays a role in vivo by anchoring the N terminus in the membrane.The attachment of the sulfatase nascent chain to the ribosome via the C-terminal tRNA (non-released conditions, Fig. 3) largely impaired FGly formation, because the modification was mainly found in the ribosome-released polypeptides. Thus, non-released chains obviously are difficult to modify, albeit the cysteine 69, which has a distance of 89 residues to the C terminus, is accessible outside the ribosome (see the introduction and Ref. 16Dierks T. Schmidt B. von Figura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11963-11968Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This does not necessarily mean that FGly formation only occurs posttranslationally, i.e. after completion of translation/translocation, because we analyzed a translation intermediate artificially arrested at the ribosome after synthesis of only 30% of the entire sulfatase protein. On the other hand, FGly formation indeed occurred under strictly posttranslational conditions, when the detergent extract was incubated with ribosome-free substrate polypeptides, i.e. after their release from the ribosomes by puromycin and removal of ribosomes (Fig. 3). However, the modification efficiency was doubled, when the substrate polypeptides were released concomitant to the addition of the microsomal extract. Thus, FGly formation obviously is optimal immediately after releasing the nascent polypeptide from the ribosome, as may be the case in vivo at a late cotranslational or early posttranslational step of protein translocation. Hence, ribosome/translocon association may assist in maintaining a modification competent state of the sulfatase polypeptide.The FGly-modifying machinery consists of soluble component(s) of the ER lumen, as could be shown by differential extraction of microsomes with low concentrations of detergent. Under conditions that extract the luminal proteins but leave the membrane proteins in the membrane fraction, almost all FGly-forming activity was recovered in the soluble fraction. Accordingly, after reconstitution of membranes by detergent removal (dialysis) from a fully solubilized detergent extract, the FGly-generating activity was not associated with the membranes (proteoliposomes) but with the non-reconstituted soluble proteins.Kinetic characterization of the FGly-forming activity in the reticuloplasm revealed typical enzymatic properties with a characteristic temperature dependence (activation energy 61 kJ/mol) and strong inhibition by a synthetic peptide comprising the modification motif (IC50 135 nm). This IC50value may be taken as a figure of the enzyme's substrate affinity constant. A true K m value could not be determined by saturation studies, because we had to use in vitrosynthesized substrate polypeptides (≈0.15 nm). At this low substrate concentration pre-steady-state conditions may prevail with binding (and not catalysis) being the rate-limiting step. The slow kinetics observed (1% turnover in 20 min per equivalent of cow pancreas microsomes) may reflect this limitation or, alternatively, may indicate a very low abundance of the modifying machinery in the reticuloplasm.This machinery shows some characteristics that are not unexpected for an enzyme residing in the lumen of the ER. It is stimulated by calcium ions (Fig. 6) and is sensitive to the SH/SS-redox milieu (Table I). High concentrations of GSH but also moderate concentrations of GSSG inhibited FGly formation. Optimum conditions were observed at 2.5 mm GSH or dithiothreitol indicating that these thiols are required to prevent oxidation of the enzyme's cysteines. The substrate's cysteine obviously was not affected in these experiments, because only pretreatment of reticuloplasm with dithiothreitol led to stimulation of FGly modification activity, whereas pretreatment of RNCs with dithiothreitol had no or a partial inhibitory effect (not shown). Passing the reticuloplasm through a gel filtration column did not reduce its specific modifying activity (in the presence of dithiothreitol and Ca2+), suggesting that no diffusible low molecular weight cofactor is required for in vitro FGly formation. More specifically, a possible role of GSSG as a cofactor that is directly involved in cysteine oxidation is highly unlikely. However, we cannot definitely exclude that GSH/GSSG is required to maintain a redox potential favoring cysteine oxidation.The pH dependence of modification, however, was rather surprising. Its high alkaline pH optimum (10.0–10.5) is difficult to explain. It may reflect that OH− ions play a role, as could be envisaged if FGly formation occurs in two steps, namely an enzyme-mediated oxidation of the cysteine's thiol to a thioaldehyde group (–CH=S) that subsequently is spontaneously hydrolyzed to eliminate H2S and yield FGly (see also Refs. 5Schmidt B. Selmer T. Ingendoh A. von Figura K. Cell. 1995; 82: 271-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar and 8Dierks T. Miech C. Hummerjohann J. Schmidt B. Kertesz M.A. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25560-25564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The hydrolytic step may be stimulated by alkaline pH. Thus, the broad pH profile observed (Fig. 5 E) may represent a composite pH optimum curve of the oxidation and the hydrolytic step, the latter being rate limiting at low pH and the former being rate limiting at high pH. To test for this hypothesis, we chilled a 20 min/37 °C modification reaction on ice, shifted its pH from 7.5 to 10.5, and prolonged the incubation for another 20 min at 0 °C. This treatment, however, did not increase the modification efficiency as compared with non-shifted or non-prolonged control samples (data not shown). Thus, the OH−-stimulated step obviously requires 37 °C. Such a step theoretically could be a slow conversion of cysteine to dehydroalanine by H2S elimination. This reaction intermediate may be generated enzymatically at neutral and non-enzymatically at high alkaline pH. However, as conversion of dehydroalanine to FGly most likely would have to include serine as a second intermediate, a residue that in ASA-C69S can be modified neitherin vivo nor in vitro (11Recksiek M.

In vitro, these deletions had little effect on cellular cholesterol efflux from macrophages but LCAT activation was reduced by 50 and 70% for the Δ1–43 and Δ1–65 apoA-I mutants, respectively, relative to wild-type (Wt) apoA-I. To further define the role of the N terminus of apoA-I in HDL maturation, we constructed recombinant adenoviruses containing Wt apoA-I and two similar mutants with deletions of residues 7–43 and 7–65 (referred to as Δ7–43 and Δ7–65 apoA-I, respectively). Residues 1–6 were not removed in these mutants to allow proper cleavage of the pro-sequence in vivo. Following injection of these adenoviruses into apoA-I-deficient mice, plasma concentrations of both Δ7–43 and Δ7–65 apoA-I were reduced 4-fold relative to Wt apoA-I. The N-terminal deletion mutants, in particular Δ7–65 apoA-I, were associated with greater proportions of preβ-HDL and accumulated fewer HDL cholesteryl esters relative to Wt apoA-I. Wt and Δ7–43 apoA-I formed predominantly α-migrating and spherical HDL, whereas Δ7–65 apoA-I formed only preβ-HDL of discoidal morphology. This demonstrates that deletion of the first class A amphipathic α-helix has a profound additive effect in vivo over the deletion of the globular domain alone (amino acids 1–43) indicating its important role in the production of mature α-migrating HDL. In summary, the combined in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate a role for the N terminus of apoA-I in lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase activation and the requirement of the first class A amphipathic α-helix for the maturation of HDL in vivo.

J. Lipid Res. 1968; 9: 155-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This pathway is accepted as a primary mechanism by which HDL exert their anti-atherogenic effects. Nascent HDL are secreted by hepatocytes, liberated from chylomicrons during triglyceride lipolysis, and are derived from HDL remodeling by hepatic lipase and cholesteryl ester transfer protein. The importance of phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) in the lipidation of this nascent HDL pool has recently emerged, because PLTP-deficient mice exhibit defective phospholipid transfer from triglyceride-rich lipoproteins to HDL, reduced HDL levels, and increased HDL catabolism (2Qin S. Kawano K. Bruce C. Lin M. Bisgaier C. Tall A.R. Jiang X. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 269-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Efflux of cholesterol and phospholipids from cells provide nascent HDL with lipid constituents. This step is important for steady-state concentrations of HDL, because efflux is a rate-limiting step in HDL maturation as heterozygous mutations in the ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) can cause familial HDL deficiency (3Marcil M. Brooks-Wilson A. Clee S.M. Roomp K. Zhang L.H. Yu L. Collins J.A. van Dam M. Molhuizen H.O. Loubster O. Ouellette B.F. Sensen C.W. Fichter K. Mott S. Denis M. Boucher B. Pimstone S. Genest J.

The combined actions of PLTP and ABCA1 generate larger discoidal preβ2 and preβ3-HDL from the nascent HDL pool, which are converted to spherical α-migrating HDL by the actions of lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) as newly synthesized cholesteryl esters partition to the HDL core. Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) is the predominant protein constituent of HDL, whose contribution to HDL metabolism has been subject to intense investigations (reviewed in Refs. 4Frank P.G. Marcel Y.L.

Lebowitz J. Datta G. Anantharamaiah G.M. Engler J.A. Brouillette C.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11714-11725Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 16Rogers D.P. Roberts L.M. Lebowitz J. Engler J.A.

Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Ray M.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 288-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and it was suggested that the deleted amino acids stabilize the lipid-free conformation of apoA-I. The x-ray crystal structure of this mutant suggests that apoA-I, when bound to HDL, wraps around the periphery of the particle perpendicular to the phospholipid fatty-acyl chains (18Borhani D.W. Rogers D.P. Engler J.A. Brouillette C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12291-12296Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Previous work also demonstrates that deletion of these residues confers a 2-fold decrease in the ability of apoA-I to activate LCAT suggesting functional properties of this mutant may be moderately affected, as well (17Rogers D.P. Brouillette C.G. Engler J.A. Tendian S.W. Roberts L. Mishra V.K. Anantharamaiah G.M. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Ray M.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 288-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The importance of helix 1 (aa 44–65) for association of apoA-I with phospholipids has been shown previously (15Rogers D.P. Roberts L.M. Lebowitz J. Datta G. Anantharamaiah G.M. Engler J.A. Brouillette C.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11714-11725Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 19Palgunachari M.N. Mishra V.K. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Adeyeye S.O. Alluri S. Anantharamaiah G.M. Segrest J.P. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 328-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Using synthetic peptides modeled after repeating 22-mer domains of apoA-I, Palgunachari and co-workers (19Palgunachari M.N. Mishra V.K. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Adeyeye S.O. Alluri S. Anantharamaiah G.M. Segrest J.P. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 328-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) demonstrated that only N- and C-terminal peptides corresponding to aa 44–65 and 220–241 of apoA-I were able to clarify dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine vesicles, implicating both the N and C termini in phospholipid binding. In addition, the characterization of an apoA-I deletion mutant lacking residues 1–65 suggests this protein has significantly less phospholipid binding affinity relative to wild-type and Δ1–43 apoA-I (15Rogers D.P. Roberts L.M. Lebowitz J. Datta G. Anantharamaiah G.M. Engler J.A. Brouillette C.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11714-11725Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, the contributions of this helix to cholesterol efflux and to LCAT activation and the in vivo maturation of HDL have not been fully characterized. To investigate structure-function relationships associated with the N terminus of apoA-I, we have compared wild-type apoA-I and two N-terminal deletion mutants both in vitro, using histidine-tagged proteins purified from Escherichia coli, and, in vivo, by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer. The results of the current in vitro and in vivostudies demonstrate a role for the N terminus of apoA-I in LCAT activation and the requirement of the first class A amphipathic α-helix for the maturation of HDL in vivo. Histidine (His)-tagged wild-type apoA-I (His-Wt apoA-I) (20Bergeron J. Frank P.G. Emmanuel F. Latta M. Zhao Y. Sparks D.L. Rassart E. Denefle P. Marcel Y.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1344: 139-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and the deletion mutant lacking residues 1–65 (His-Δ1–65 apoA-I) (15Rogers D.P. Roberts L.M. Lebowitz J. Datta G. Anantharamaiah G.M. Engler J.A. Brouillette C.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11714-11725Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) were generated as described previously. The apoA-I mutant in which residues 1–43 were deleted (His-Δ1–43 apoA-I) was generated by deletion mutagenesis using the Excite mutagenesis kit from Stratagene and the following oligonucleotides: 5′-PCATATGGTGATGGTGATGGTGCG-3′ (up- stream) and 5′-CTAAAGCTCCTTGACAACTGGGACAGCG-3′ (down- stream). The apoA-I mutant lacking residues 210–243 (His-Δ210–243 apoA-I) was generated by similar methods using the following oligonucleotides: 5′-GGGCTTGGCCTTCTCGCTGAGCG-3′ (upstream) and 5′-PTGAGGCGCCCGCCGCCCCCCTT C-3′ (downstream). J774 mouse peritoneal macrophages and 293 human embryonic kidney cells were maintained between passages in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and Eagles's minimal essential medium, respectively, supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 2 mm l-glutamine. Cell culture reagents and plastic ware were purchased from Sigma, Life Technologies, Inc. and Falcon. All recombinant His-tagged apoA-I proteins for these studies were expressed and purified in E. coli as described previously (20Bergeron J. Frank P.G. Emmanuel F. Latta M. Zhao Y. Sparks D.L. Rassart E. Denefle P. Marcel Y.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1344: 139-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) with some minor changes (21McManus D.C. Scott B.R. Franklin V. Sparks D.L. Marcel Y.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21292-21302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). After lyophilization, the proteins were solubilized in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline. Efflux assays were performed with cholesterol loaded J774 macrophages as described by Sakr et al. (22Sakr S.W. Williams D.L. Stoudt G.W. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) with several modifications. Cells were seeded in 12-well plates at a density of 2×104 cells/well and grown for 48 h before cholesterol loading. Cells were cholesterol loaded for 48 h in 1 ml of DMEM containing 1% fetal bovine serum and [1α,2α-3H]cholesterol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) (15 μCi/ml final concentration), which had been preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C with acetylated LDL (75 μg/ml final concentration). Subsequently, cells were washed 3× in DMEM containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and incubated in DMEM containing 0.2% BSA with or without 0.3 mm8-bromoadenosine 3′:5′-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) (Sigma Chemical Co.) for 12 h. Cells were then washed 3× in DMEM containing 0.2% BSA. For the efflux assay, cells were incubated for 0, 2, 6, and 24 h in 1 ml of DMEM containing 0.2% BSA with or without 0.3 mmcAMP containing 50 μg of His-Wt apoA-I or equivalent moles of each apoA-I deletion mutant. At the appropriate time point, media samples were removed and centrifuged at 1000 × g to remove floating cells. Cells were solubilized in 1 ml of 0.5 nNaOH for 24 h and assayed for cell protein content by the method of Markwell et al. (23Markwell M.A. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5345) Google Scholar). The radioactivity in all samples was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Cholesterol efflux was calculated as the percentage of initial cell radioactivity associated with the media as a function of time. Values were corrected at each time point for the efflux of cholesterol to medium not containing apoA-I. The percent stimulation of cholesterol efflux in response to cAMP treatment was calculated according to the following equation: [(efflux from J774 cells treated with cAMP − efflux from J774 cells in the absence of cAMP)/(efflux from J774 cells in the absence of cAMP)] × 100% (24Fournier N. Atger V. Paul J.L. Sturm M. Duverger N. Rothblat G.H. Moatti N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1283-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Reconstituted discoidal lipoproteins containing 2 molecules of apoA-I (Lp2A-I) were prepared by cholate dispersion/Bio-Bead removal protocol using initial molar ratios of 80:10:1 of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (PL) (Avanti Polar Lipids, Birmingham, AL), free cholesterol (FC) (Sigma) and His-apoA-I, respectively, as described elsewhere (25Sparks D.L. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25839-25847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Particle size and homogeneity were confirmed by 4–20% non-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PAGGE). Each particle contained 2 molecules of apoA-I as determined by cross-linking with dimethylsuberimidate, according to an established protocol (26Swaney J.B. O'Brien K.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 71: 636-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Enzymatic kits were used to determine the final PL (Wako Chemicals, Neuss, Germany) and FC (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) concentrations. The apoA-I content was measured according to the method of Markwellet al. (23Markwell M.A. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5345) Google Scholar) using a BSA standard. The stability of the Lp2A-Is was assessed by circular dichroism spectroscopy using a Jasco J41A spectropolarimeter. The change in molar ellipticity was determined at 222 nm with increasing concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride to calculate the standard free energy of denaturation (ΔGD0) (25Sparks D.L. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25839-25847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human LCAT was purified as described previously (27Albers J.J. Chen C.H. Lacko A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 129: 763-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Lp2A-Is were prepared containing [3H]cholesterol and His-Wt, His-Δ1–43, or His-Δ1–65 apoA-I. Two distinct types of experiments were performed. The time course assay was performed as described previously (21McManus D.C. Scott B.R. Franklin V. Sparks D.L. Marcel Y.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21292-21302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) by incubating 3.5 units of LCAT with Lp2A-I for 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 h at 37 °C at a final apoA-I concentration of 2.14 μm. In the second experiment, the rate constants Vmax and apparentKm (Km(app)) were determined by incubating Lp2A-Is at the concentrations indicated (expressed in micromolar apoA-I) for 10 min at 37 °C. In both cases, reactions were terminated by the addition of 2 ml of ethanol, and minimal substrate conversion was determined previously (28Sparks D.L. Anantharamaiah G.M. Segrest J.P. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5151-5157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The values indicated are the means ± S.E. of triplicate results and are representative of two independent experiments. One unit of LCAT is defined as the amount of enzyme required to convert 1 nmol of FC to cholesteryl ester (CE) per hour using a standard His-Wt Lp2A-I at a final concentration of 2.0 μm. The cDNAs for apoA-I deletion mutants lacking residues 7–43 (Δ7–43 apoA-I) and residues 7–65 (Δ7–65 apoA-I) were sub-cloned into the pCA13 vector (Microbix Biosystems Inc.). Recombinant adenoviruses (Δ7–43 apoA-I Ad5 and Δ7–65 apoA-I Ad5) were prepared as previously described for the wild-type apoA-I (Wt apoA-I) adenovirus (Wt apoA-I Ad5) (29McManus D.C. Scott B.R. Frank P.G. Franklin V. Schultz J.R. Marcel Y.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5043-5051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To verify efficient secretion of these deletion mutants, pulse-chase studies were performed using primary hepatocytes isolated from apoA-I-deficient mice (21McManus D.C. Scott B.R. Franklin V. Sparks D.L. Marcel Y.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21292-21302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). ApoA-I-deficient (apoA1tmlUnc) mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice were maintained on a 12-h light/12-h dark schedule and were fed a normal chow diet (Charles River rodent diet 5075, 18% protein and 4.5% fat). All experiments were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the University of Ottawa Animal Care Committee. Mice used for these studies were all 4- to 12-month-old males. Following adenovirus injections, plasma apoA-I levels were determined by quantitative Western blotting. Equivalent volumes of plasma were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot using a polyclonal anti-human apoA-I antibody raised in sheep. The concentrations of Wt apoA-I and the two N-terminal deletion mutants in mouse plasma samples were determined by densitometry and comparison to apoA-I standards of known concentrations using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). To eliminate the possibility that differential immunoreactivity may under- or overestimate the plasma levels of the mutant apoA-Is expressed in the mouse, we compared the immunoreactivity of His-Wt apoA-I with the two N-terminal deletion mutants, His-Δ1–43 and His-Δ1–65 apoA-I. Equivalent amounts of the purified histidine-tagged apoA-Is (determined by Markwell et al. (23Markwell M.A. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5345) Google Scholar)) were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot. A mass range of 0.2–5 μg was used, covering the range in apoA-I mass detected in plasma by this method. The relative intensity was then plotted versus the mass of apoA-I used for His-Wt, His-Δ1–43, and His-Δ1–65 apoA-I (data not shown). The plots were virtually identical, indicating that differential immunoreactivity is not a concern in this assay. Separation of mouse plasma by size exclusion chromatography (FPLC) was performed as described previously (29McManus D.C. Scott B.R. Frank P.G. Franklin V. Schultz J.R. Marcel Y.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5043-5051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, 500 μl of mouse plasma was loaded onto two Superdex 200 (analytical grade, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) columns connected in series. Separation was achieved at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min, and 5-ml fractions were collected. Each fraction was assayed for total cholesterol (TC) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN), FC, and PL content using standard enzymatic kits. 100 μl of each fraction was analyzed for apoA-I content by slot blot (Bio-Rad Bio-Dot SF unit) followed by Western blot analysis using a biotinylated A44 monoclonal antibody (biot-A44 mAb). ApoA-I-deficient mouse plasma samples were separated by discontinuous gradient ultracentrifugation as described previously (29McManus D.C. Scott B.R. Frank P.G. Franklin V. Schultz J.R. Marcel Y.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5043-5051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Samples were centrifuged for 18 h and 210,000 × g at 8 °C. 1-ml fractions were collected from top to bottom, and densities were determined by refractometer (Fisher Scientific, Nepean, Ontario, Canada) analysis. Aliquots of each fraction were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (0.025-μm filter disks, Millipore Corp.) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (below). Western blot analysis was performed using a polyclonal anti-human apoA-I antibody from sheep. Negative stain electron microscopy was performed as described by others (30Forte T.M. Nordhausen R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 442-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Briefly, discontinuous gradient samples were dialyzed against 0.125 m ammonium acetate, 2.6 mm ammonium carbonate, and 0.26 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, and concentrated to 100–200 μg/ml. Samples were mixed 1:1 with 2% sodium phosphotungstate, pH 7.4, before applying to carbon-coated Formvar grids (200 mesh) and visualized using a Hitachi H-7100 electron microscope at × 50,000 and × 70,000 magnifications. SDS-PAGE was performed using 12% acrylamide pre-cast Novex gels (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Non-denaturing PAGGE was done using 4–20% acrylamide pre-cast Novex gels, and samples were separated for 2000 V×h. Pre-β- and α-migrating HDL were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis (Beckman Lipogel, Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) followed by neutral lipid staining (Beckman) or Western blotting using the biot-A44 mAb. Samples were separated for 30 min at 100 V. Samples separated by 12% SDS-PAGE were transferred to nitrocellulose at 125 V for 1 h while those separated by 4–20% PAGGE were transferred at 125 V for 2 h. Membranes were probed either with the biot-A44 mAb directed against the central domain of apoA-I (aa 149–186), an anti-human apoA-I polyclonal from sheep (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), or an anti-mouse apoE polyclonal from rabbit (Biodesign International, Kennebunk, ME). Proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence following incubation with either streptavidin (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), donkey anti-sheep IgG (Sigma), or donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) coupled to horseradish peroxidase. The average ± standard error (S.E.) of a minimum of triplicate measurements is reported within. Statistical analysis was performed by Student's t test where indicated and values are considered to be statistically significant at p < 0.05 (two-tailed ttest). His-Wt, His-Δ1–43, His-Δ1–65, and His-Δ210–243 apoA-I were expressed and purified from E. coli and used to evaluate the potential contribution of the N terminus of apoA-I to cellular cholesterol efflux. Cells were first cholesterol-loaded for 48 h with acetylated LDL and subsequently equilibrated for 12 h in either the absence or presence of 0.3 mm cAMP. Medium containing 50 μg of His-Wt apoA-I or equivalent moles of His-Δ1–43, His-Δ1–65, and His-Δ210–243 apoA-I was then added, and the efflux to each acceptor was determined over time (Table I). In the absence of cAMP, efflux to His-Δ1–43 and His-Δ1–65 apoA-I was slightly, but significantly (p < 0.01), reduced relative to His-Wt apoA-I while efflux to His-Δ210–243 apoA-I was greatly reduced (2.2-fold) (p < 0.01) by comparison. In the presence of cAMP, which stimulates expression of ABCA1 (31Oram J.F. Vaughan A.M. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2000; 11: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), efflux to His-Δ1–43 and His-Δ1–65 apoA-I was not statistically different from His-Wt apoA-I. In contrast, efflux in the presence of cAMP for His-Δ210–243 apoA-I was significantly reduced (p < 0.01) relative to His-Wt apoA-I and the two N-terminal deletion mutants (1.5-fold).Table IThe rate of cholesterol efflux from J774 macrophages to His-Wt, His-Δ1–43, His-Δ1–65, and His-Δ210–243 apoA-IEffluxR2Stimulation with cAMP% cell cholesterol/h%His-Wt apoA-I −cAMP0.97 ± 0.020.99 ± 0.0187 ± 5 +cAMP1.83 ± 0.060.99 ± 0.01His-Δ1–43 apoA-I −cAMP0.88 ± 0.021-aValues statistically different (p < 0.01) relative to His-Wt apoA-I.0.99 ± 0.0178 ± 3 +cAMP1.66 ± 0.050.99 ± 0.01His-Δ1–65 apoA-I −cAMP0.86 ± 0.021-aValues statistically different (p < 0.01) relative to His-Wt apoA-I.1.00 ± 0.0191 ± 1 +cAMP1.77 ± 0.011.00 ± 0.01His-Δ210–243 apoA-I −cAMP0.45 ± 0.031-aValues statistically different (p < 0.01) relative to His-Wt apoA-I.,1-bValues statistically different (p < 0.01) for the C-terminal deletion mutant compared to the N-terminal deletion mutants.0.99 ± 0.0173 ± 1 +cAMP1.19 ± 0.021-aValues statistically different (p < 0.01) relative to His-Wt apoA-I.,1-bValues statistically different (p < 0.01) for the C-terminal deletion mutant compared to the N-terminal deletion mutants.0.99 ± 0.02Cholesterol efflux assays using J774 macrophages were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After cholesterol loading, cells were equilibrated for 12 h in the absence (−cAMP) and in the presence (+cAMP) of 0.3 mm cAMP.

In vector-transfected HEK293 cells (controls), thapsigargin (TG)-induced (capacitative Ca2+ entry (CCE)-mediated) intracellular Ca2+signals and Mn2+ entry were markedly suppressed by the NO donor 2-(N,N-diethylamino)diazenolate-2-oxide sodium salt (3 μm) or by authentic NO (100 μm). In cells overexpressing Trp3 (T3-9), TG-induced intracellular Ca2+ signals exhibited an amplitude similar to that of controls but lacked sensitivity to inhibition by NO. Consistently, NO inhibited TG-induced Mn2+ entry in controls but not in T3-9 cells. Moreover, CCE-mediated Mn2+ entry into T3-9 cells exhibited a striking sensitivity to inhibition by extracellular Ca2+, which was not detectable in controls. Suppression of mitochondrial Ca2+ handling with the uncouplers carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (300 nm) or antimycin A1 (-AA1) mimicked the inhibitory effect of NO on CCE in controls but barely affected CCE in T3-9 cells. T3-9 cells exhibited enhanced carbachol-stimulated Ca2+entry and clearly detectable cation currents through Trp3 cation channels. NO as well as carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone slightly promoted carbachol-induced Ca2+ entry into T3-9 cells. Simultaneous measurement of cytoplasmic Ca2+ and membrane currents revealed that Trp3 cation currents are inhibited during Ca2+ entry-induced elevation of cytoplasmic Ca2+, and that this negative feedback regulation is blunted by NO. Our results demonstrate that overexpression of Trp3 generates phospholipase C-regulated cation channels, which exhibit regulatory properties different from those of endogenous CCE channels. Moreover, we show for the first time that Trp3 expression determines biophysical properties as well as regulation of CCE channels by NO and mitochondrial Ca2+ handling. Thus, we propose Trp3 as a subunit of CCE channels. The role of Trp3 in cellular regulation of Ca2+ entry by NO was studied in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells.

Birnbaumer L. Mikoshiba K. Gill D.L. Science. 2000; 287: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). A direct gating by interaction with a specific cytosolic domain of the IP3 receptor has been demonstrated for cation channels derived by overexpression of Trp3 protein, and activation of this Trp channel was found to depend on IP3 (6Kiselyov K.

However, recent studies with cells lacking expression of all three types of IP3 receptors question a general role of IP3 in activation of CCE channels but confirm requirement of basal PLC activity (8Broad L.M.

Therefore, Trp species that are sensitive to PLC-derived signals such as IP3 and diacylglycerol appear as attractive candidates for proteins forming CCE channel complexes. Although heterologous overexpression of Trp3 or Trp6 clearly generates phospholipase C/IP3-dependent Ca2+ entry pathways (6Kiselyov K. Xu X. Mozhayeva G. Kuo T. Pessah I. Mignery G. Zhu X.

Gudermann T. Schultz G. Nature. 1999; 397: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar, 12Lintschinger B. Balzer-Geldsetzer M. Baskaran T. Graier W.F. Romanin C. Zhu M.X. Groschner K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 265: 27799-27805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (263) Google Scholar), these proteins fail to promote the classical CCE phenomenon upon overexpression (10Zhu X. Jiang M. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 133-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 12Lintschinger B. Balzer-Geldsetzer M. Baskaran T. Graier W.F. Romanin C. Zhu M.X. Groschner K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 265: 27799-27805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Thus, the cation channels derived by overexpression of Trp3 or Trp6 resemble native CCE channels in terms of their principle PLC dependence, but apparently lack the distinctive ability of CCE channels to sense the filling state of the Ca2+ stores. Nonetheless, Trp3 or Trp6 proteins may function as subunits of multimeric CCE channel complexes. This hypothesis has been put forward by the observation that Trp3 overexpression not only increases phospholipase C/IP3-dependent Ca2+ entry but in addition changes its pharmacological properties, leading to loss of sensitivity to block by Gd3+ (10Zhu X. Jiang M. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 133-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). These results were interpreted as the ability of Trp3 proteins to serve as functional subunits of CCE channel complexes (10Zhu X. Jiang M. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 133-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 13Wu X. Babnigg G. Villereal M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C526-C536Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present work was designed to test whether Trp3 interferes with the regulatory properties of CCE channels such as sensing local intracellular Ca2+ concentrations that are controlled by mitochondria (14Hoth M. Fanger C.M. Lewis R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 633-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Another important mechanism of CCE regulation is its inhibition by nitric oxide (NO), which has been proposed to promote refilling of the endoplasmic reticulum resulting in reduced CCE (15Trepakova E.S. Cohen R.A. Bolotina V.M. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). NO donors such as DEANO have been demonstrated to inhibit CCE into platelets (16Schaefer G. Wascher T.C. Kostner G.M. Graier W.F. Diabetologia. 1998; 41: 1-11Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar) and smooth muscle cells (15Trepakova E.S. Cohen R.A. Bolotina V.M. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 17Cohen R.A. Weisbrod R.M. Gericke M. Yaghoubi M. Bierl C. Bolotina V.M. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 210-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the lipophilic NO donor GEA3162 has been demonstrated to enhance CCE into mouse parotid acini (18Watson E.L. Jacobson K.L. Singh J.C. Ott S.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C262-C270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and to activate Ca2+ entry into human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells stably expressing Trp3 (19van Rossum D.B. Patterson R.L. Ma H.T. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28562-28568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears reasonable to speculate that variable NO sensitivity might exist among CCE channel complexes, depending on the subunit stoichiometry and contribution of specific Trp species. With this study, we demonstrate for the first time that the expression level of Trp3 affects two distinctly different Ca2+ entry pathways. Trp3 overexpression in HEK293 cells promotes a phospholipase C-dependent Ca2+ entry pathway and eliminates the sensitivity of classical CCE channels to inhibition by NO as well as mitochondrial Ca2+ handling. HEK293 cells were stably transfected cells with either the coding region of hTrp3 (GenBank™ accession no.U47050) (10Zhu X. Jiang M. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 133-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), designated as T3-9 cells, or with the neomycin resistance cassette, designated as HEKVT (controls). Cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 0.178 g/liter Geneticin. In case of control cells, different clones were pooled together and cultured as specified above. T3-9 cells were grown to confluence. Carbonate-extracted cell lysates were separated on discontinuous sucrose gradients, and fractions were collected after ultracentrifugation. 25% of the fraction was used for Bradford assay, and the remaining 75% of the fraction was used for Western blot analysis. The fraction was separated on SDS-PAGE (8 or 12% SDS gels; 50 min, 180 mV) and afterward transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (90 min, 200 mA) using the Bio-Rad Protean III and the Mini Transblot. The blots were incubated in TBST buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1% Bio-Rad Blocking reagent overnight at 4 °C. Antibodies were diluted in 1% blocking solution (anti-hemagglutinin, 1:1000), and blots were incubated for 2 h with the first antibody, washed with TBST buffer, followed by 60-min incubation with the second antibody (horseradish-conjugated anti-rabbit from Sigma). After washing the blot with TBST buffer, immunoreactivity was detected using the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Intracellular Ca2+ was measured with fura-2. fura-2/AM was initially dissolved in Me2SO at 2 mm and used at a final concentration of 2 μm. Confluent cells were harvested by enzymatic digestion (0.25% trypsin), suspended in 5 ml of culture medium (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium) without serum, and loaded with fura-2/AM for 60 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Thereafter, cells were washed once with Ca2+ containing Tris buffer (50 mm Tris, 2.5 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4), incubated for 20 min, and washed in Tris buffer without Ca2+ (50 mm Tris, 1 mmMgCl2, 100 μm EGTA, pH 7.4). Fluorescent measurements were carried out with a dual wavelength spectrofluorimeter (Hitachi F2000). Cells were maintained at 37 °C, and emission was collected at 510 nm at excitation of 340 and 380 nm, respectively. For store depletion 100 nm thapsigargin (TG) or 200 μm carbachol (CCh) were added, and extracellular Ca2+ was elevated subsequently by adding 1 mmCa2+ to induce Ca2+ entry. [Ca2+]i was determined from the fluorescence ratioF 340/F 380 according to Ref. 20Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar. The fluorescence after sequential addition of 0.1% Triton X-100 and 50 mm EGTA to the cells provided the maximum fluorescence ratio (R max) and the minimum fluorescence ratio (R min), respectively. [Ca2+]i was calculated using the formula shown in Equation 1. [Ca2+]i=(R−Rmin)/(Rmax−R)×β×KdEquation 1 β is the ratio of the emission fluorescence at 380 nm excitation in the presence of Triton X-100 and Triton X-100 plus EGTA, respectively. In experiments performed in the presence of DEANO, CCCP, or other agents that affect mitochondrial function, the compound was added 1 min prior to addition of TG or CCh. Alternative to fura-2 experiments, the intracellular free Ca2+ was determined by loading the cells with Fluo-3 AM (2 μm). Cell seeded on coverslips (6 × 6 mm; poly-l-lysine-coated) were loaded with Fluo-3 in DMEM without fetal calf serum and incubated at 37 °C under 5% CO2 for 60 min. Fluo-3 loaded cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and kept in DMEM without fetal calf serum. Coverslips were then transferred to the perfusion chamber mounted on the microscope stage (Nikon Diaphot 300). Experiments were performed at room temperature. The cells were excited with a Polychrome II at 488 nm, and the emission was collected at 535 nm. Fluo-3 fluorescence was monitored on with a CCD camera system (Sensicam) and analyzed using Axon Imaging Workbench 2.1 software. For Mn2+quench experiments, the cells were loaded with fura-2/AM in DMEM without serum as described above. Cells were washed once with Tris buffer with 2.5 mm Ca2+, incubated for 20 min, and washed again with nominally Ca2+-free TRIS buffer. The experiments were conducted either in nominally Ca2+-free or in extracellular Ca2+-chelated condition as specified. Mn2+-induced quench of fura-2 fluorescence was measured at 360 nm (isosbestic point), and Mn2+ entry was initiated by addition of 100 μm Mn2+ at 60 s. 3 μm DEANO or 300 nm CCCP was added 200 s before stimulation of Mn2+ entry by thapsigargin (100 nm). Control experiments were performed with vehicle only. Mn2+ quench was calculated by measuring the quench in fluorescence per second caused by Mn2+ entry and represented as change on fluorescence (F 360) per second. For measurements of intramitochondrial Ca2+, cells were seeded on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips (6 × 6 mm) and loaded with rhod-2/AM in DMEM without fetal calf serum, at a concentration of 2 μm for 45 min. at 37 °C. Cells were illuminated with a Polychrome II at 540 nm, and fluorescence emission was collected at 605 nm. The rhod-2 fluorescence was monitored on a Nikon Diaphot 300 microscope equipped with a CCD camera system (Sensicam) and analyzed using Axon Imaging Workbench 2.1 software. All patch-clamp experiments were performed using a extracellular solution containing (in mm) 50 Tris, 137 NaCl, 65 KCl, and 0.1 EGTA or 2.5 CaCl2, pH adjusted to 7.4 with HCl. The pipette solution for whole cell experiments contained (in mm) 145 potassium gluconate, 15 KCl, 15 HEPES, 5 MgCl2, pH adjusted to 7.4 withN-methyl-d-glucamine. For perforated patch recordings and simultaneous current/fluorescence measurement, amphotericin B was added to the pipette solution to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml (0.5% Me2SO). Measurement of Ca2+ in fluo-3-loaded cells was performed simultaneously with current measurements in voltage clamped cells as described above. Pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass (Clark Electromedical Instruments, Pangbourne, United Kingdom) and finally fire-polished. The pipette resistance (filled) was in the range of 2–5 megohms. Recordings were performed in a 200-μl bath chamber and with continuous perfusion by a gravity-driven system. Voltage clamp and current amplification was performed with a List EPC-7 (List, Darmstadt, Germany) patch-clamp amplifier. Voltage ramp protocols covering a voltage range from −100 to +80 mV with durations of 500 or 1000 ms were applied. Signals were low pass-filtered at 1 kHz and digitized with 5 kHz. Stimulation protocols and recordings were controlled by Axon pCLAMP software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) via an Axon Digidata 1200 computer interface. Chemicals were purchased from the following suppliers,: Tissue culture medium was from Life Technologies, Inc. (Vienna, Austria); fura-2/AM and rhod-2/AM were from Molecular Probes (Leiden, Netherlands); DEANO was from Alexis (Switzerland); and all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma (Vienna, Austria). All the individual experiments were averaged, and the mean of the time courses is represented as trace. Results obtained at specific time points were expressed as mean value ± S.E. Differences were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05 using Student’s t test for unpaired values. Fig. 1 shows a comparison of TG- and CCh-induced Ca2+ entry into vector-transfected (HEKVT) and Trp3-overexpressing HEK293 cells (T3-9) based on fura-2 fluorescence measurements in cell populations. Expression of the hemagglutinin-tagged Trp3 channel protein in the cells was verified by Western blot experiments, which demonstrated the presence of the ∼100-kDa hemagglutinin-tagged protein in membranes of T3-9 cells (data not shown). To activate the classical CCE pathway, we depleted intracellular stores with thapsigargin (100 nm) in Ca2+-free solution. Alternatively, carbachol (200 μm) was used to induce phospholipase C/IP3-mediated release of Ca2+from intracellular stores. Ca2+ entry was initiated by re-addition of extracellular Ca2+. As shown in Fig.1 A, elevation of extracellular Ca2+ induced a peak intracellular Ca2+ level of 1156 ± 36 nm (n = 6) in TG-stimulated cells, which was 3-fold higher than that measured in carbachol stimulated cells (373 ± 14 nm; n = 7). In Trp3-overexpressing cells, this relationship was distorted, in that TG-induced Ca2+ signals were slightly reduced (1064 ± 64 nm, n = 10) whereas Ca2+entry in carbachol-stimulated cells (750 ± 32 nm,n = 12) was enhanced as shown in Fig. 1 B. Thus, Trp3 overexpression clearly promoted or generated a phospholipase C-dependent Ca2+ entry pathway but not a classical CCE. Fig. 2(A–D) illustrates the effects of the NO donor DEANO (3 μm) on thapsigargin-induced CCE in HEKVT and T3-9 cells in suspension. CCE into HEKVT was markedly reduced in the presence of the NO donor DEANO (3 μm), resulting in a reduction of peak intracellular Ca2+ levels from 1156 ± 36 nm to 425 ± 41 nm(n = 6), as shown in Fig. 2 A. By contrast, thapsigargin-induced CCE into T3-9 cells was completely insensitive to DEANO (988 ± 223 nm, n = 8, Fig.2 B). Similar results were obtained with authentic NO at a concentration of 100 μm (data not shown). 8-Bromo-cGMP, a cell permeant cGMP analogue, did not mimic the effects of NO in respect to Ca2+ mobilization and inhibition of CCE (1146 ± 41 nm, n = 5), suggesting that the effect of NO was independent of cGMP. The action of NO was typically associated with a slight increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+ that was transient in nature and did not require extracellular Ca2+ (see Fig. 2 A). Fig. 2 (C and D) illustrates the effects of DEANO on TG-induced Mn2+ entry in HEKVT and T3-9 cells, respectively. DEANO clearly suppressed TG-induced Mn2+ entry into HEKVT cells (Fig.2 C) but not in T3-9 cells (Fig. 2 D). The observed lack of sensitivity to NO in T3-9 cells indicates that Trp3 is able to modify the regulatory property of CCE channels. Trp3-induced elimination of NO sensitivity of CCE was confirmed in single fluo-3-loaded HEK293 cells, as shown in Fig. 2 (E and F). Thapsigargin-stimulated Ca2+ entry was again markedly inhibited by the NO donor in vector-transfected controls but not in T3-9 cells. The Mn2+ quench experiments illustrated in Fig. 2 were performed in a buffer containing EGTA (100 μm), resulting in free Ca2+ levels below 1 μm. T3-9 cells exhibited reduced TG-induced Mn2+ quench in nominally Ca2+-free solutions. As shown in Fig.3, a clear dependence of TG-induced Mn2+ entry on extracellular Ca2+ was observed in T3-9 cells but not in HEKVT cells. Chelation of extracellular Ca2+ with EGTA restored Mn2+entry in T3-9 cells to a level comparable with that of controls, indicating that Mn2+ permeation through CCE channels is affected by overexpression of Trp3 in that the TG-sensitive Mn2+ entry pathway gained sensitivity to extracellular Ca2+. The inhibitory action of NO was mimicked by the mitochondrial uncoupler CCCP. TG-stimulated CCE into control cells (HEKVT) was reduced from 1156 ± 36 nm to 416 ± 38 nm in the presence of CCCP (300 nm; Fig. 4 A), corresponding to an inhibition of CCE by 64%. Similar to NO, CCCP by itself induced a modest, transient elevation of cytoplasmic Ca2+. CCE into T3-9 cells was less sensitive to inhibition by CCCP as compared with control cells (Fig. 4 B). CCCP-induced inhibition amounted to 28% in T3-9 cells. CCCP inhibited TG-induced Mn2+ entry into control as well as in T3-9 cells (Fig. 4, C and D). Nonetheless, inhibition of Mn2+ entry into T3-9 cells was less pronounced than in vector-transfected controls (41% versus 63%, respectively). Fig. 5 (A and B) illustrates the effects of the mitochondrial uncouplers antimycin A1 (2 μm) and oligomycin (6 μm) on TG-induced Ca2+ signals in single fluo-3-loaded cells. Interestingly, antimycin A1 which prevents the generation of mitochondrial H+ gradients and rapidly disturbs Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria (21David G. Barrett E.F. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7290-7296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was most effective as an inhibitor of CCE, whereas oligomycin, which primarily inhibits ATP synthase (22Rustenbeck I. Herrmann C. Grimmsmann T. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1305-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), failed to inhibit CCE significantly, indicating a key role for mitochondrial Ca2+ handling. Fig. 5 C compares the sensitivity of Ca2+ entry into HEKVT and T3-9 cells to inhibition by DEANO, CCCP, antimycin A1, and oligomycin. In T3-9 cells, the sensitivity of CCE to inhibition by the NO donor as well as by the mitochondrial uncouplers CCCP and antimycin A1 were strongly reduced or eliminated. The similarities between the effects of NO and those of mitochondrial uncouplers supported the hypothesis of mitochondria as a primary target of NO action. Therefore, we tested the effects of NO on Ca2+ handling by mitochondria. DEANO and CCCP induced a moderate rise in basal intracellular Ca2+ concentrations in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, as evident from the experiments shown in Figs. 2 and 4. The mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ by CCCP is known to result mostly from depolarization of mitochondria and the consequent depletion of mitochondrial Ca2+. To test whether NO mimics CCCP in modulation of mitochondrial Ca2+handling, we performed experiments with rhod-2 to measure changes in mitochondrial Ca2+. As shown in Fig.6 A, rhod-2 fluorescence was localized within the cells in discrete spots and increased upon stimulation with CCh (200 μm), whereas rhod-2 fluorescence decreased significantly upon administration of either DEANO (3 μm) or CCCP (300 nm). Moreover, CCh-induced increase in rhod-2 fluorescence was effectively prevented by both agents. Averaged time courses of mitochondrial rhod-2 fluorescence during exposure of cells to DEANO, CCCP, and CCh are given in Fig. 6 (C, F, and I), illustrating CCh-induced changes in rhod-2 fluorescence in the absence of drugs (n = 55) and in the presence of DEANO (n = 66) or CCCP (n = 59), respectively. Trp3 overexpression has been demonstrated previously to create a PLC- and IP3-dependent Ca2+ entry pathway (6Kiselyov K. Xu X. Mozhayeva G. Kuo T. Pessah I. Mignery G. Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. Muallem S. Nature. 1998; 396: 478-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). This function of Trp3 was again confirmed by the promotion of CCh-induced Ca2+ signaling observed in the present study (Fig. 1). Fig.7 illustrates that DEANO (3 μm) as well as CCCP (300 nm) slightly inhibited CCh-induced Ca2+ signaling in control cells (Fig.7, A and C) but promoted CCh-induced Ca2+ entry into T3-9 cells (Fig. 7, B and D). In T3-9 cells, DEANO (3 μm), authentic NO (100 μm; n = 4; data not shown) as well as CCCP (300 nm) increased the CCh-induced Ca2+entry signals measured in cell populations. Both NO as well as CCCP reduced the CCh-induced Ca2+ mobilization in Ca2+-free solution but augmented the Ca2+signals induced by subsequent Ca2+ entry. Promotion of CCh-induced Ca2+ entry into T3-9 cells was associated with a change in kinetics of the Ca2+ signals. In the presence of DEANO or CCCP Ca2+ entry-induced intracellular Ca2+ levels did not decline but remained elevated during prolonged rises in extracellular Ca2+. The concentration of Ca2+ measured at 200 s after initiation of Ca2+ entry was 475 ± 14 nm(n = 12) in the presence of vehicle and 758 ± 15 nm (n = 10) in the presence of DEANO. Similarly, CCCP promoted Ca2+ signals in T3-9 cells, resulting in significantly elevated intracellular Ca2+levels (968 ± 94 nm, n = 6, Fig.7 D) at 200 s after initiation of entry. Thus, the Trp3-derived PLC-regulated Ca2+ entry pathway and CCE were divergently regulated by NO. Because Trp3 channels were found previously to exhibit Ca2+-mediated negative feedback modulation similar to CCE channels, it was of interest to investigate the effects of NO on the relation between bulk cytoplasmic Ca2+ and Trp currents in single adherent HEK293 cells. Fig. 8 shows time courses of intracellular Ca2+ and membrane currents measured simultaneously in single T3-9 cells, which were stimulated with CCh in Ca2+-free solution and subjected to subsequent elevation of extracellular Ca2+ in the absence (Fig.8 A) and presence (Fig. 8 B) of DEANO (3 μm). The simultaneous recording of cytoplasmic Ca2+ and membrane currents in voltage-clamped T3-9 cells demonstrated a qualitatively similar relation between overall cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels and membrane conductances in the absence and presence of NO. CCh stimulated a membrane conductance in Ca2+-free extracellular solution, which was suppressed during re-addition of extracellular Ca2+. This CCh-stimulated membrane conductance was not detected in vector-transfected control cells (n = 3, data not shown). Two distinct modes of regulation of Trp3 channels were evident. (i) Trp3 channels were activated in response to stimulation of muscarinic receptors, a situation that is characterized by depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores and a transient rise in cytoplasmic Ca2+; and (ii) the channels were suppressed during subsequent elevation of extracellular Ca2+, which caused large rises in cytosolic Ca2+ via Ca2+entry. Fig. 9 shows a comparison of intracellular Ca2+ levels and current densities obtained in parallel experiments. In the absence of DEANO, Ca2+re-addition was associated with a substantial and significant reduction in membrane currents. This Ca2+ entry-induced suppression of Trp3 currents was less pronounced in the presence of DEANO. By contrast, Ca2+ entry-induced increments in cytoplasmic Ca2+ were significantly larger in the presence of the NO donor (ΔF 488 = 50 ± 2) as compared with controls (ΔF 488 = 36 ± 1). Thus, NO affects Ca2+-dependent autoregulation of PLC-regulated Trp3 channels in a manner oppositional to that of native CCE channels.Figure 9NO promotes Trp3-mediated membrane currents in the presence of extracellular Ca2+.

https://openalex.org/W1583479632,"It has been reported that the hyperinsulinism-hyperammonemia syndrome is caused by mutations in glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) gene that affects enzyme sensitivity to GTP-induced inhibition. To identify the GTP binding site(s) within human GDH, mutant GDHs at Tyr-266 or Lys-450 position were constructed by cassette mutagenesis. More than 90% of the initial activities were remained at the concentration of GTP up to 300 μmfor the Lys-450 mutant GDHs regardless of their size, hydrophobicity, and ionization of the side chains, whereas the wild type GDH and the Tyr-266 mutant GDHs were completely inhibited by 30 μmGTP. The binding of GTP to the wild type GDH or the mutant GDHs was further examined by photoaffinity labeling with 8-[γ-32P]azidoguanosine 5′-triphosphate (8-N3-GTP). Saturation of photoinsertion with 8-N3-GTP occurred apparent K d values near 20 μm for the wild type GDH or the Tyr-266 mutant GDH, and the photoinsertion of 8-N3-[γ-32P]GTP was significantly decreased in the presence of 300 μm GTP. Unlike the wild type GDH or the Tyr-266 mutant GDH, less than 10% of photoinsertion was detected in the Lys-450 mutant GDH, and the photoinsertion was not affected by the presence of 300 μm GTP. The results with cassette mutagenesis and photoaffinity labeling demonstrate selectivity of the photoprobe for the GTP binding site and suggest that Lys-450, but not Tyr-266, is required for efficient binding of GTP to GDH. Interestingly, studies of the steady-state velocity showed that both the wild type GDH and the Tyr-266 mutant GDHs were inhibited by ATP at concentrations between 10 and 100 μm, whereas less than 10% of the initial activities of the Lys-450 mutant GDHs were diminished by ATP. These results indicate that Lys-450, but not Tyr-266, may be also responsible for the ATP inhibition; therefore, ATP bound to the GTP site.

The results with cassette mutagenesis and photoaffinity labeling demonstrate selectivity of the photoprobe for the GTP binding site and suggest that Lys-450, but not Tyr-266, is required for efficient binding of GTP to GDH. Interestingly, studies of the steady-state velocity showed that both the wild type GDH and the Tyr-266 mutant GDHs were inhibited by ATP at concentrations between 10 and 100 μm, whereas less than 10% of the initial activities of the Lys-450 mutant GDHs were diminished by ATP. These results indicate that Lys-450, but not Tyr-266, may be also responsible for the ATP inhibition; therefore, ATP bound to the GTP site. glutamate dehydrogenase 8-azidoguanosine 5′-triphosphate base pair high performance liquid chromatography Glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH)1 has been isolated and sequenced from a number of varied sources and has an important role in nitrogen and carbon catabolism. GDH (EC 1.4.1.2–1.4.1.4) catalyzes the reversible deamination of l-glutamate to 2-oxoglutarate using NAD+ or NADP+ as coenzyme (1Smith E.L. Austen B.M. Blumenthal K.M. Nyc J.F. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. XI. Academic Press, Inc., New York1975: 293-367Google Scholar). The largest difference between mammalian and bacterial GDH is a long antenna domain formed by the 48-amino acid insertion extending from the top of the NAD domain and lying adjacent to the 3-fold axis of the hexamer (2Rice D.W. Baker P.J. Farrants G.W. Hornby D.P. Biochem. J. 1987; 242: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 3Knapp S. De Vos W.M. Rice D. Ladenstein R. J. Mol.

Biol. 2001; 307: 707-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and there is little identity between the 100 residues in the C terminus (6Wootton J. Chambers G. Holder A. Baron A. Taylor J. Fincham J. Blumenthal K. Moon K. Smith E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 4361-4365Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In contrast to the extensive allosteric homotrophic and heterotrophic regulation observed in mammalian GDH, bacterial forms of GDH are relatively unregulated. The recent atomic structure of bovine liver GDH suggests that the allosteric regulation and negative cooperativity observed in mammalian GDH may be facilitated by the subunit interactions within the antenna region (4Peterson P.E. Smith T.J. Structure (Lond.). 1999; 7: 769-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 5Smith T.J. Peterson P.E. Schmidt T. Fang J. Stanley C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 707-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). It was suggested that these allosteric regulations are performed by changing the energy required to open and close the catalytic cleft during enzymatic turnover (4Peterson P.E. Smith T.J. Structure (Lond.). 1999; 7: 769-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Mammalian GDH is strictly regulated by several allosteric effectors. GTP inhibits enzyme turnover over a wide range of conditions by increasing the affinity of the enzyme for the product, making product release rate-limiting under all conditions in the presence of GTP (4Peterson P.E. Smith T.J. Structure (Lond.). 1999; 7: 769-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar,5Smith T.J. Peterson P.E. Schmidt T. Fang J. Stanley C.A. J. Mol.

In contrast, ADP is a potent activator by decreasing product affinity (8Bailey J Bell E.T. Bell J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5579-5583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Plaitakis A Metaxari M. Shashidharan P. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1862-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Binding studies suggest that when NADH is used as a coenzyme, there are two GTP sites per subunit (10Jacobson M.A. Colman R.F. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2177-2186Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and GTP inhibition is agonized by synergistic binding between the second coenzyme and one of the GTP binding sites (11Koberstein R. Sund H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 36: 545-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). It also has been reported that mammalian GDH contains both an NADH-dependent and NADH-independent GTP binding site (7Pal P.K. Colman R.F. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 838-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, there are disagreements on whether there are two GTP sites (4Peterson P.E. Smith T.J.

Recently, Peterson and Smith (4Peterson P.E. Smith T.J. Structure (Lond.). 1999; 7: 769-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) report, based on their atomic structure studies, that a second GTP molecule binds into the region below the pivot helix that lies behind the NAD+ binding domain. Paradoxically, NAD+can also bind to the second GTP site but causes activation. Very recently, the strongest evidence that this was not a bound GTP molecule came from the same researchers (5Smith T.J. Peterson P.E. Schmidt T. Fang J. Stanley C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 707-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). It appears that the region below the pivot helix is the second coenzyme site rather than a second GTP site (5Smith T.J. Peterson P.E. Schmidt T. Fang J. Stanley C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 707-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The importance of the physiological nature of GDH has attracted considerable interest. The existence of the hyperinsulinism-hyperammonemia syndrome caused by mutations in a human GDH gene that affects enzyme sensitivity to GTP-induced inhibition highlights further the importance of GDH (14Fahien L.A.

Poncz M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 1353-1357Crossref Scopus (605) Google Scholar). The hyperinsulinism-hyperammonemia syndrome could be caused by excessive activity of GDH, since this would simultaneously increase the release of insulin by pancreatic beta cells. These observations demonstrate that allosteric regulation of GDH plays a crucial role in the regulation of insulin secretion and hepatic ureagenesis. The mutated residues responsible for this pathology were found to lie mainly around the GTP site (16Stanley C.A. Lieu Y.K. Hsu B.Y.L. Burlina A.B. Greenberg C.R. Hopwood N.J. Perlman K. Rich B.H. Zammarchi E. Poncz M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 1353-1357Crossref Scopus (605) Google Scholar). In the present work, we have expanded on the identification of GTP binding site(s) of human GDH using a cassette mutagenesis and photoaffinity labeling with 8-N3-GTP at two residues, Tyr-266 and Lys-450, that have been speculated as putative GTP binding sites by chemical modification studies (7Pal P.K. Colman R.F. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 838-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 12Shoemaker M.T. Haley B.E.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13907-13913Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and found to be involved in hyperinsulinism-hyperammonemia syndrome (16Stanley C.A. Lieu Y.K. Hsu B.Y.L. Burlina A.B.

Azidopurine photoprobes generate short-lived, very reactive nitrenes that will modify any residue placed near the generated nitrene by binding. The ability of the photoaffinity probes in the absence of activating light to mimic the native nucleotides as substrate and regulatory constituents further supports their specificity. Their selectivity and specificity have been successfully utilized to locate specific binding domains on mammalian GDH and other proteins (17Campbell S. Kim H. Doukas M. Haley B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1243-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 18Olcott M. Bradly M. Haley B.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11835-11941Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 19Gunnersen D.J.

Very recently, a 1557-base pair gene that encodes human GDH has been synthesized and expressed in Escherichia coli in our laboratory (23Cho S.-W. Yoon H.-Y. Ahn J.-Y. Lee E.-Y. Lee J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3205-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For the present study, the mutant human GDHs, containing Glu, Gly, Met, Ser, or Arg at the Tyr-266 site and Glu, Gly, Met, Ser, or Tyr at the Lys-450 site have been expressed in E. coli as a soluble protein, purified, and characterized. To our knowledge, this is the first report by site-directed mutagenesis showing that Lys-450, but not Tyr-266, is required for efficient binding of GTP and that the second GTP site, if any, is not required for binding of GTP to human GDH. NADP+, NAD+, NADH, NADPH, 2-oxoglutarate, ATP, ADP, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, GTP, l-glutamate, and l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin were purchased from Sigma. 8-N3-[γ-32P]GTP was synthesized by the method as previously described (12Shoemaker M.T. Haley B.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1883-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 13Cho S.-W. Ahn J.Y. Lee J. Choi S.Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13907-13913Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Human GDH gene (pHGDH) has been chemically synthesized and expressed inE. coli as a soluble protein in our laboratory as described elsewhere (23Cho S.-W. Yoon H.-Y. Ahn J.-Y. Lee E.-Y. Lee J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3205-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). All other chemicals and solvents were reagent grade or better. E. coli DH5α (24Hanahan D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 557-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8098) Google Scholar) was used as the host strain for plasmid-mediated transformations for cassette mutagenesis. E. coli PA340 (thr-1 fhuA2 leuB6 lacY1 supE44 gal-6 gdh-1 hisG1 rfbD1 galP63 Δ(gltB-F)500 rpsL19 malT1 xyl-7 mtl-2 argH1 thi-1 (kindly provided by Dr. Mary K. B. Berlyn, E. coli Genetic Stock Center, Yale University) lacked both GDH and glutamate synthase activities (25Teller J. Smith R.J. McPherson M.J. Engel P.C. Guest J.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and was used to test plasmids for GDH activity. E. coli BL21 (DE3) (26Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4772) Google Scholar) was used for high level expression of the recombinant human GDH. A series of single amino acid substitutions of Tyr-266 or Lys-450 was constructed separately by cassette mutagenesis of a synthetic human GDH gene, pHGDH (23Cho S.-W. Yoon H.-Y. Ahn J.-Y. Lee E.-Y. Lee J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3205-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For, the Tyr-266 site, plasmid DNA (5 μg) was digested with Stu I and Nsi I to remove a 42-bp fragment that encodes amino acids 260–273; this fragment was replaced with five 42-bp synthetic DNA duplexes containing a substitution on both DNA strands at positions encoding Tyr-266 to make Y266G, Y266S, Y266E, Y266M, and Y266R. For mutagenesis at the Lys-450 site, plasmid DNA was digested withNhe I and Tth 111I to remove a 15-bp fragment that encodes amino acids 447–451; this fragment was replaced with five 15-bp synthetic DNA duplexes containing a substitution on both DNA strand at positions encoding Lys-450 to make K450G, K450S, K450E, K450M, and K450Y. The Tyr-266 mutant GDHs and the Lys-450 mutant GDHs were identified by DNA sequencing using plasmid DNA as a template. Each of these mutants has been expressed in E. coli strain DE3, has been purified to homogeneity as described above, and has had its steady-state kinetic parameters determined. The gene expression levels of the Tyr-266 mutant GDHs and the Lys-450 mutant GDHs were examined by Western blot and compared with those of wild type GDH. Fresh overnight cultures of DE3/pHGDH were used to inoculate 1 liter of LB containing 100 μg of ampicillin/ml. DE3/pHGDH was grown at 37 °C until the A 600 reached 1.0, and then isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. After isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction, DE3/pHGDH was grown for an additional 3 h at 37 °C and then harvested by centrifugation. Cell pellets were suspended in 100 ml of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol and lysed with a sonicator. The wild type GDH and the mutant GDHs were purified by the method developed in our laboratory (23Cho S.-W. Yoon H.-Y. Ahn J.-Y. Lee E.-Y. Lee J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3205-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 27Cho S.-W. Lee J. Choi S.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 340-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Because the wild type GDH and the mutant GDHs were readily solubilized, no detergents were required throughout the entire purification steps. The purified GDHs were analyzed by SDS/PAGE and recognized by Western blot using monoclonal antibodies previously produced in our laboratory (28Choi S.Y. Hong J.W. Song M.-S. Jeon S.G. Bahn J.H. Lee B.Y. Ahn J.-Y. Cho S.-W. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 2162-2169Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) against the bovine brain GDH. Protein concentration was determined as described previously (27Cho S.-W. Lee J. Choi S.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 340-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). GDH activity was measured spectrophotometrically in the direction of reductive amination of 2-oxoglutarate by following the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm as described before (27Cho S.-W. Lee J. Choi S.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 340-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). All assays were performed in duplicate, and initial velocity data were correlated with a standard assay mixture containing 50 mm triethanolamine, pH 8.0, 100 mm ammonium acetate, 0.1 mm NADH, 10 mm 2-oxoglutarate, and 2.6 mm EDTA at 25 °C. Because E. coli only has an NADP(H)-dependent GDH (24Hanahan D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 557-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8098) Google Scholar, 29McPherson M.J. Wootton J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 5257-5266Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), the enzyme assay was performed with NADH as a coenzyme as described elsewhere (27Cho S.-W. Lee J. Choi S.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 340-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). One unit of enzyme was defined as the amount of enzyme required to oxidize 1 μmol of NADH/min at 25 °C. The effects of the wild type GDH and the mutant GDHs by allosteric regulators such as GTP, ADP, and ATP were examined by incubating the enzymes with the allosteric effectors at various concentrations in 50 mm triethanolamine, pH 8.0, at 25 °C. At intervals after the initiation with the effectors, aliquots were withdrawn for the assay of GDH activity. Photolabeling of the wild type GDH and the mutant GDHs were performed by the method of Shoemaker and Haley (12Shoemaker M.T. Haley B.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1883-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) with a slight modification. For saturation studies, 0.1 mg of human GDH in 10 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, were separately incubated with various concentrations of 8-N3-[γ-32P]GTP in Eppendorf tubes for 5 min with a hand-held UV lamp at a distance of 4 cm. For competition studies, 0.1 mg of GDHs were incubated with various concentrations of GTP for 10 min in the same buffer prior to the addition of 60 μm 8-N3-[γ-32P]GTP and then allowed to incubate with the photoprobe for 5 min as described above. The samples were then irradiated with a handhold 254-nm UV lamp for 90 s twice at 4 °C. The reaction was quenched by the addition of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (final 7%). The reaction mixtures were kept on ice bath for 30 min and then centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellets were washed and resuspended with 10 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0. The remaining free photoprobe, if any, was further removed from the protein by exhaustive washing using Centrifree (Amicon), and 32P incorporation into protein was determined by liquid scintillation counting. 1.0 mg of the wild type GDH and the mutant GDHs in 5 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, were separately incubated with 100 μm8-N3-[γ-32P]GTP for 2 min at 4 °C. The mixtures were irradiated for 90 s twice. The reaction was quenched by the addition of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (final 7%) and kept at 4 °C for 15 min. The protein was precipitated by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was resuspended in 75 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.5, containing 2 m urea. The resuspended sample was proteolysed by the addition of 15 μg of trypsin and kept at room temperature for 3 h, after which 15 μg of trypsin was added again. After 3 more h at room temperature, 15 μg of trypsin was added, and the digestion mixture was kept at 25 °C overnight. To validate that the isolated peptide(s) was specific for the GTP site and so could be protected by GTP from photomodification, GDH was photolysed in the presence of 300 μm GTP and proteolysed as described above. The photolabeled GDHs in the presence or absence of 300 μm GTP were applied to a Protein Pak DEAE-5PW (Waters) column on a Waters HPLC system equipped with a diode array spectral detector. The gradient for HPLC was 0–10 min, 0% NaCl; 10–60 min, 0–0.5 n NaCl; 60–70 min, 0.5 nNaCl at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The absorbance of the fractions was measured at 220 nm, and the photoincorporation was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The fractions containing photolabeled peptides were desalted, freeze-dried, resuspended in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and subjected to reversed-phase HPLC using a Waters C18column on the same HPLC system. The mobile system consisted of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid solution and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 80% acetonitrile solvent system. The gradient for HPLC was 0–10 min, 0% acetonitrile; 10–60 min, 0–80% acetonitrile; 60–70 min, 80% acetonitrile at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. HPLC fractions containing photolabeled peptides were sequenced by the Edman degradation method as described elsewhere (27Cho S.-W. Lee J. Choi S.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 340-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The 42-bp Stu I/Nsi I fragment and the 15-bp Nhe I/Tth 111I fragment in pHGDH were replaced with five 42- and 15-bp synthetic DNA duplexes containing a substitution on both DNA strands at positions encoding Tyr-266 and Lys-450, respectively. These substitutions created the mutant GDHs Y266G, Y266S, Y266E, Y266M, and Y266R at position 266 and K450G, K450S, K450E, K450M, and K450Y at position 450, respectively. These mutants were designed to have different size, hydrophobicity, and ionization of the side chains at each position. Analysis of crude cell extracts by Western blot showed that Tyr-266 or Lys-450 mutant plasmids encoding an amino acid substitution at position 266 or 450 directed the synthesis of a 56.5-kDa protein that interacted with monoclonal antibodies raised against GDH at almost identical levels for all mutant GDHs and wild type GDH (Fig. 1). These results indicate that the mutagenesis at Tyr-266 or Lys-450 site has no effects on expression or stability of the different mutant GDHs. Specific activities of the Tyr-266 mutant GDHs in the crude extracts were 0.25∼0.31 units/mg, compared with wild type value of 1.12 units/mg. This represent an ∼4-fold reduction in the activities of the Tyr-266 mutant GDHs compared with wild type GDH, suggesting that Tyr-266 is required for catalytic activity. A more detailed investigation of the catalytic activities of the mutant enzymes revealed essentially unchanged apparent K m values for 2-oxoglutarate but a 3.5-fold decrease for NADH (TableI) with an ∼4-fold decrease in the respective apparent V max values (Table I), suggesting that Tyr-266 may be located in the coenzyme binding domain. Unlike the Tyr-266 mutant GDHs, the Lys-450 mutant GDHs showed similar kinetic properties to those of the wild type GDH in terms of their specific activities, K m, and V max (Table I).Table IKinetic parameters of wild type GDH and mutant GDHs in crude extractsV maxaMean of duplicates.K maMean of duplicates.NADH2-Oxoglutarateμmol·min−1·mg−1μMmMWild type1.12 ± 0.0281 ± 11.21 ± 0.03K450G0.91 ± 0.0284 ± 31.30 ± 0.02K450S1.01 ± 0.0384 ± 11.28 ± 0.02K450E1.02 ± 0.0486 ± 31.31 ± 0.03K450M1.01 ± 0.0380 ± 21.40 ± 0.04K450Y0.98 ± 0.0288 ± 21.35 ± 0.02Y266G0.27 ± 0.03270 ± 31.54 ± 0.03Y266S0.25 ± 0.03276 ± 31.60 ± 0.02Y266E0.24 ± 0.02261 ± 21.49 ± 0.04Y266M0.31 ± 0.04265 ± 21.52 ± 0.03Y266R0.26 ± 0.04278 ± 31.61 ± 0.02a Mean of duplicates. Open table in a new tab The inhibitory effects of GTP on the Tyr-266 mutant GDHs and the Lys-450 mutant GDHs were examined and summarized in Fig. 2. There were significant differences between the Tyr-266 mutant GDHs and the Lys-450 mutant GDHs in their sensitivities to the inhibition by GTP (Fig. 2). Although the wild type GDH and the Tyr-266 mutant GDHs were completely inhibited by GTP at 30 μm, more than 90% of the initial activities remained at a GTP concentration up to 300 μm for the Lys-450 mutant GDHs regardless of their size, hydrophobicity, and ionization of the side chains (Fig. 2). These results suggest that the inhibition of GDH by GTP is mainly due to the binding of GTP to the Lys-450 residue and indicate that the Tyr-266 residue is not critically involved in the binding of GTP. The binding of GTP to the wild type GDH and the mutant GDHs was further examined by photoaffinity labeling with 8-N3-[γ-32P]GTP. To show that 8-N3-GTP could mimic the inhibitory properties of GTP, the photoanalogue should be able to reversibly inhibit GDH in the absence of activating light. When assayed with NADH as a coenzyme, 8-N3-GTP was able to inhibit the wild type GDH and the Tyr-266 mutant GDHs (Fig. 3). However, less than 10% of the inhibitions by 8-N3-GTP in the reaction of the Lys-450 mutant GDHs were observed. These results show that the azidonucleotide 8-N3-GTP is able to elicit almost the same biological effects on the wild type GDH and the mutant GDHs as the natural nucleotide, GTP. Because almost identical results were obtained among the five mutant GDHs at position of Tyr-266 or Lys-450, respectively, only one mutant GDH at each position (Y266M and K450Y) was homogeneously purified for the further studies. The purified Y266M or K450Y mutant GDH was estimated to be >97% pure by SDS/PAGE (Fig.4).Figure 3Inhibition of the wild type GDH and the mutant GDHs by 8-N3-GTP. The effects of 8-N3-GTP on the wild type GDH and the mutant GDHs were examined as described in Fig. 2 except that 8-N3-GTP was substituted for GTP. Because almost identical results were obtained among the five mutant GDHs at position of Tyr-266 or Lys-450, respectively, only the results with Y266M and K450Y are shown for clarity.

Under the experimental conditions described, saturation of photoinsertion with 8-N3-[γ-32P]GTP occurred at 55 and 70 μm photoprobe for the wild type GDH and the Y266M mutant GDH, respectively (Fig. 5). The apparentK d values of this interaction were 18 and 22 μm for the wild type GDH and the Y266M mutant GDH, respectively. However, the photoinsertion of 8-N3-[γ-32P]GTP into the K450Y mutant GDH was only 15% of the wild type GDH (Fig. 5). To demonstrate specific labeling of GDH, the enzymes were photolabeled with 8-N3-[γ-32P]GTP in the presence of increasing GTP concentrations. As shown in the results of the competition experiments (Fig. 6), increasing GTP concentration decreased the photolabeling of 60 μm 8-N3-[γ-32P]GTP. When 300 μm GTP was present with 100 μm8-N3-[γ-32P]GTP, 94 and 87% of photoinsertion were protected for the wild type GDH and the Y266M mutant GDH, respectively. For K450Y mutant GDH, there was a little effect of GTP on the photoinsertion of 8-N3-[γ-32P]GTP, but this was a decrease from an already very low starting level (Fig. 6). These results show the specificity and utility of 8-N3-GTP as a good candidate for determining the GTP site and suggest the involvement of Lys-450, but not Tyr-266, for the efficient binding of GTP to the human GDH.Figure 6Effect of GTP on photoinsertion of 8-N3-[γ-32P]GTP into the wild type GDH and the mutant GDHs.

However, insulin and ET-1 apparently regulate these processes via discrete signaling pathways. In addition to PI3-kinase independence, ET-1 and Gα11(Q209L), but not insulin, stimulate cortical F-actin polymerization and GLUT4 translocation through a mechanism that requires ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6) (9Bose A.

Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13289-13296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) or by treatment of cells with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (6Wu-wong J.R. Berg C.E. Wang J. Chiou W.J. Fissel B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8103-8110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, different sets of proteins are tyrosine-phosphorylated by ET-1 and insulin. In the case of insulin stimulation, many of these proteins have been identified, including the insulin receptor itself and insulin receptor substrate proteins (6Wu-wong J.R. Berg C.E. Wang J. Chiou W.J. Fissel B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8103-8110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), whereas the identity and the function of the tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in ET-1-treated cells have not yet been characterized. We identify here two such proteins, the Ca2+-sensitive protein tyrosine kinase PYK2 and its substrate paxillin, and show that PYK2 functions selectively in the ET-1 signaling pathway that leads to GLUT4 glucose transporter translocation to the plasma membrane.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo identify proteins that are tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to ET-1, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were left untreated or treated with either ET-1 or insulin, and then cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, 4G10. As shown in Fig.1 B, insulin and ET-1 stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of distinct sets of proteins. As expected, the major tyrosine-phosphorylated bands in the insulin-treated sample migrated at positions identical to those of insulin receptor substrates 1/2 (Fig. 1 B, IRS-1/2) and the insulin receptor (IR), whereas two major tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins with apparent molecular sizes of 120 and 70 kDa were immunoprecipitated from the lysates of ET-1-treated cells. The 120-kDa protein was clearly visible when the 4G10 immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining (Fig. 1 A). Upon tryptic digestion followed by mass spectrometry, the band was shown to contain a peptide (NLLDAVQAK) corresponding to the calcium-dependent protein tyrosine kinase PYK2/CADTK/RAFTK/CAKβ/FAK2 (15Avraham H. Park S. Schinkmann K. Avraham S. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar).Fig. 2 A shows that the PYK2 protein specifically immunoprecipitated with PYK2 antibody is indeed tyrosine-phosphorylated in 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with ET-1 but not in control cells. Insulin had little or no effect on PYK2 tyrosine phosphorylation in several experiments. PYK2 is activated mainly by autophosphorylation at the tyrosine residue Tyr402, which can be induced by intracellular calcium (16Yu H. Li X. Marchetto G.S. Dy R. Hunter D. Calvo B. Dawson T.L.

Tyrosine phosphorylation of PYK2 in intact cells has been reported in response to various stimuli, including G protein-coupled receptor ligands (16Yu H. Li X. Marchetto G.S. Dy R. Hunter D. Calvo B.

Chem. 1998; 273: 2384-2389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this protein kinase was also identified as the major protein tyrosine phosphorylated upon incubation of permeabilized 3T3-L1 adipocytes with GTPγS (12Elmendorf J.S Chen D. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13289-13296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), suggesting that GTPγS may also stimulate the PYK2 tyrosine phosphorylation via activation of Gα11.Figure 2Endothelin-1 stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of PYK2 and paxillin and causes recruitment of paxillin to F-actin-rich adhesion sites in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Serum-starved 3T3-L1 adipocytes were left untreated (−) or treated with 10 nm ET-1 and 100 nm insulin for 10 min. The cell lysates were immunoprecipiated (IP) with 4G10, anti-PYK2 (A), or anti-paxillin (B) antibodies, and the precipitates were immunoblotted (IB) with the indicated antibodies. C, cells were treated as above, fixed, and permeabilized. Paxillin was visualized by staining with anti-paxillin antibody and FITC-conjugated secondary antibody. Actin was visualized by staining with rhodamine-phalloidin. The right panel shows the merged images.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The protein migrating at 70 kDa (Fig. 1 B), selectively tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to ET-1 treatment of adipocytes, was not observed as a unique ET-1-specific band in the silver-stained gels (Fig. 1 A). Western blotting suggests that this tyrosine-phosphorylated protein undergoes a significant mobility shift upon stimulation with ET-1, perhaps because of chemical modifications such as tyrosine and serine/threonine phosphorylation. The reduced signal of the silver-stained band at 70 kDa supports this idea (Fig.1 A, lower asterisk). Paxillin, a 70-kDa adapter protein and regulator of the actin cytoskeleton, has been reported to be tyrosine-phosphorylated by PYK2 and displays a similar dispersed banding pattern on SDS-PAGE (20Li X. Earp H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14341-14348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether paxillin is tyrosine-phosphorylated by ET-1 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by immunoblotting paxillin precipitates with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Fig. 2 B shows that ET-1 but not insulin stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin in cultured adipocytes as detected with this method. The same result was obtained by blotting 4G10 immunoprecipitates with anti-paxillin antibody (Fig.2 B). The similarly smeared banding patterns of this protein in Figs. 1 B and 2 B further imply that the 70-kDa protein is paxillin.Based on these results, the localization of PYK2 and paxillin proteins in 3T3-L1 adipocytes were analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy, and their responses to ET-1 and insulin were investigated. Fig.2 C shows that endogenous paxillin displays a rather diffuse distribution near the cell surface of unstimulated cultured adipocytes, and little F-actin is observed. ET-1 treatment of the adipocytes caused a marked recruitment of paxillin to focal adhesions, where paxillin decorated the tips of ET-1-induced cortical F-actin seen at the bottom surface of the cells. In contrast, insulin caused the formation of very thin and shorter actin fibers, with no change in paxillin localization. Endogenous PYK2 could not be detected by immunofluorescence microscopy in 3T3-L1 adipocytes using commercial antibodies. However, when the Myc epitope-tagged protein was expressed in adipocytes, PYK2 also dramatically localized to focal adhesions in response to ET-1 but not insulin (Fig.3).Figure 3Dominant negative PYK2 ( CRNK ) selectively blocks ET-1 but not insulin action on F-actin formation. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were electroporated with pcDNA-PYK2-Myc (WT), pcDNA-PYK2(K457A)-Myc (KD), or pcDNA-CRNK-Flag (CRNK). Cells were starved and then left untreated or were treated with 10 nm ET-1 and 100 nm insulin and analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy. Cells were stained with rhodamine-phalloidin and either anti-Myc (for WT and KD) or anti-Flag (for CRNK) antibodies, which were visualized with FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To test whether PYK2 is involved in F-actin polymerization downstream of ET-1, two dominant inhibitory mutants were utilized. The kinase-deficient PYK2 (PYK2-KD) bears a point mutation (K457A) in the kinase domain and displays minimal tyrosine kinase activity (17Li X. Dy R.C. Cance W.G. Graves L.M. Earp H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8917-8924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). A second mutant (CRNK for CADTK-related non-kinase) contains only the C-terminal portion (Met865–Glu1009) of PYK2, which spans the putative focal adhesion targeting domain. The mutant lacks the major tyrosine phosphorylation site (Tyr402) but retains the ability to bind paxillin in vitro. CRNK expression has also been shown to effectively abolish the autophosphorylation of PYK2 in intact cells (17Li X. Dy R.C. Cance W.G. Graves L.M. Earp H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8917-8924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). When electroporated into 3T3-L1 adipocytes, the wild type PYK2, PYK2-KD, and CRNK all showed similar diffuse cytoplasmic localization in the basal state (Fig. 3). In response to ET-1 stimulation, PYK2-KD, like PYK2-WT, localized to focal adhesions and did not inhibit cortical F-actin formation. The cortical F-actin staining actually appeared to increase in the majority of cells expressing either the wild type or the kinase deficient mutant. Insulin had no effect on the localization of either PYK2 or PYK2-KD. Unlike the full-length proteins, CRNK distribution was mainly cytoplasmic even when cells were stimulated by ET-1. CRNK completely and specifically blocked cortical F-actin polymerization stimulated by ET-1, whereas it had no effect on F-actin formations in response to insulin (Fig. 3). In addition, focal adhesions were not observed in ET-1-treated adipocytes expressing CRNK.Taken together, the data in Fig. 3 show that ET-1 action in 3T3-L1 adipocytes mobilizes PYK2, independent of its kinase activity, to F-actin-rich adhesion sites at the surface membrane, whereas insulin stimulation does not. That PYK2 is actually required to mediate formation of F-actin in response to ET-1 but not insulin is indicated by the ability of dominant negative CRNK to block cortical F-actin polymerization by ET-1 but not by insulin. PYK2 expression does not itself cause F-actin formation in the basal state, suggesting that its tyrosine phosphorylation in response to ET-1 stimulation is necessary for F-actin formation.Recent work by our laboratory (9Bose A. Cherniack A.D. Langille S.E. Nicoloro S.M.C. Buxton J.M. Park J.G. Chawla A. Czech M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5262-5275Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 21Emoto M. Langille S.E. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10677-10682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) has demonstrated a requirement of intact F-actin for optimal GLUT4 recycling to the plasma membrane in response to either insulin or ET-1 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Because we observed that PYK2 is required for F-actin polymerization in response to ET-1 in the cultured adipocytes (Fig. 3), we tested the hypothesis that ET-1 signaling to GLUT4 requires PYK2-mediated F-actin formation. Adipocytes were electroporated with a GLUT4 construct tagged with both a C-terminal EGFP and a Myc epitope (13Zhen Y.J. Chawla A. Bose A. Way M. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; (in press)Google Scholar, 22Lampson M.A. Racz A. Cushman S.W. McGraw T.E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4065-4076Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Translocation of Myc-GLUT4-EGFP was then estimated by measuring the formation of cellular rims in two ways. First, cells with a clearly demarcated EGFP signal around the cell rims were counted (Fig.4, red bars). Second, the cell surface Myc signal was assessed with anti-Myc antibody in unpermeabilized cells (Fig. 4, blue bars). In the basal condition, Myc-GLUT4-EGFP was detected mostly in the perinuclear region in adipocytes, whereas the Myc staining was at a minimal background level. Expression of CRNK in the 3T3-L1 adipocytes had no effect on the intracellular distribution of Myc-GLUT4-EGFP in this condition. When cells were stimulated by insulin, Myc-GLUT4-EGFP rims at the plasma membrane were clearly visible in the majority of cells both by the EGFP signal and Myc staining (∼80%, Fig. 4). ET-1 also stimulated the translocation of Myc-GLUT4-EGFP to the plasma membrane, yet to a lesser extent than insulin in about 50% of the Myc-GLUT4-EGFP transfected cells. In both basal and insulin-stimulated conditions, CRNK expression exerted no effect on Myc-GLUT4-EGFP distribution or the numbers of cells with signal intensity at cell rims. In contrast, CRNK expression almost completely blocked Myc-GLUT4-EGFP translocation in response to ET-1 (Fig. 4). The inability of CRNK to repress insulin action on cortical F-actin formation and GLUT4 translocation indicates that the inhibitory effects of CRNK on ET-1 signaling are not due to nonspecific interference of cellular functions. Rather, these data support the hypothesis that PYK2 is required selectively for ET-1 but not insulin action and that cortical F-actin polymerized in response to insulin and ET-1 plays a crucial role in the membrane recycling of GLUT4.Figure 4Dominant negative PYK2 ( CRNK ) selectively inhibits ET-1 but not insulin action on GLUT4 translocation.3T3-L1 adipocytes were electroporated with Myc-GLUT4-EGFP and pcDNA-CRNK-Flag. Cells were either starved and left untreated or treated with 10 nm ET-1 and 100 nm insulin, fixed, and stained with anti-Myc monoclonal antibody and Alexa350-conjugated secondary antibody. Cells were then fixed, permeabilized, and stained with anti-Flag antibody and rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody. Cells (∼100 cells for each experiment) were counted for the percentage of cells expressing Myc-GLUT4-EGFP rims that displayed anti-Myc (red bars). In addition, the ratio of Myc signal/total EGFP (blue bars, 15∼20 cells each) was calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The graphs represent values from at least three independent experiments, and the error bars show standard deviations. *, p < 0.001 over ET-1-stimulated cells not expressing CRNKView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The findings reported here indicating a requirement for PYK2 in ET-1 action on GLUT4 are consistent with previous data suggesting PYK2 is itself a target of ET-1 signaling (23Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). A logical mechanism for such an effect of ET-1 is through its action on Gα11, which activates phospholipase C, leading to the release of intracellular Ca2+, a known activator of PYK2 (16Yu H. Li X.

The finding that kinase-deficient PYK2 does not interfere with ET-1 signaling to cortical F-actin (Fig. 3) is consistent with a role for phosphorylation of PYK2 by another kinase such as Src. It should also be noted that although ET-1 stimulates glucose transport in primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (8Wu-Wong J.R. Berg C.E. Kramer D. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 2000; 36: S179-S183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it appears to actually inhibit insulin-stimulated glucose transport in primary adipocytes (28Chou Y.C. Perng J.C. Juan C.C. Jang S.Y. Kwok C.F. Chen W.L. Fong J.C. Ho L.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 688-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus, the 3T3-L1 adipocyte system used here appears to be a good model for the cardiomyocyte response to ET-1 rather than the response of primary adipocytes.The present work solidifies our previous conclusion that two quite independent mechanisms account for the actions of insulinversus ET-1 on GLUT4 recycling. A previous component shown to be required specifically for GLUT4 regulation by ET-1 but not insulin action is ARF6 (9Bose A. Cherniack A.D. Langille S.E. Nicoloro S.M.C. Buxton J.M. Park J.G. Chawla A. Czech M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5262-5275Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), a GTPase involved in actin rearrangements (29Radhakrishna H. Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. J.

Here we implicate PYK2 and paxillin as unique targets of ET-1 in this signaling pathway, whereas insulin signaling to GLUT4 is independent of these proteins. Interestingly, recent reports identified a PYK2- and paxillin-binding protein family that contains an ARF-GAP (GTPase-activating protein) domain, linking PYK2 and paxillin functions to potential regulation of ARF6 (33Donaldson J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3792-3794Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). ARF6 has recently been shown to play a role in the acute synthesis of PtdIns(4,5)P2 in membrane ruffles through its ability to activate inositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase α (34Honda A. Nogami M.

ARF6 also activates phospholipase D, generating phosphatidic acid, another activator of inositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase α (35Massenburg D. Han J.S. Liyanage M. Patton W.A. Rhee S.G. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11718-11722Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). PtdIns(4,5)P2 in turn regulates multiple proteins involved in actin dynamics (36Shibasaki Y. Ishihara H. Kizuki N. Asano T. Oka Y. Yazaki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7578-7581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Thus, ARF6 may be downstream of PYK2 and paxillin in the ET-1 signaling pathway, perhaps causing cortical actin filament formation, thought to be required for optimal GLUT4 exocytosis (9Bose A. Cherniack A.D. Langille S.E. Nicoloro S.M.C. Buxton J.M. Park J.G. Chawla A. Czech M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5262-5275Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 21Emoto M. Langille S.E.

Further experiments will be required to test this important hypothesis and to clarify the molecular details related to the role of F-actin in GLUT4 exocytosis. Insulin acts through a receptor tyrosine kinase to stimulate the uptake of glucose in fat and muscle cells by a mechanism that involves the translocation of specialized intracellular vesicles containing GLUT4 glucose transporters to the plasma membrane (1Czech M.P.

Although the signaling mechanism by which insulin mobilizes GLUT4 is not clear, it requires the p85/p110 type phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase)1 and the 3′-polyphosphoinositide products it generates (3Sharma P.M.

GLUT4 translocation can also be elicited by PI3-kinase-independent pathways, as exemplified by the action of endothelin-1 (ET-1 (6Wu-wong J.R. Berg C.E. Wang J. Chiou W.J. Fissel B. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1990551939,"In human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), the tRNALys.3 primer and viral RNA template can form a specific complex that is characterized by extensive inter- and intramolecular interactions. Initiation of reverse transcription from this complex has been shown to be distinguished from subsequent elongation by early pausing events, such as at the +1 and +3 nucleotide positions. One major concern regarding the biological relevance of these results is that most kinetic studies of HIV-1 reverse transcription have been performed using tRNALys.3-viral (v) RNA complexes that were formed by heat annealing. In contrast, tRNALys.3 in viruses is placed onto the primer binding site by nucleocapsid (NC) sequences of the Gag protein. In this study, we have further characterized the initiation features of reverse transcription in the presence of HIV-1 NC protein. In contrast to results obtained with a heat-annealed tRNALys.3·vRNA complex, we found that polymerization reactions catalyzed by HIV-1 reverse transcriptase did not commonly pause at the +1 nucleotide position when a NC-annealed RNA complex was used, and that this was true regardless whether NC was actually still present during reverse transcription. This activity of NC required both zinc finger motifs, as demonstrated by experiments that employed zinc finger-mutated forms of NC protein (H23C NC and ddNC), supporting the involvement of the zinc fingers in the RNA chaperone activity of NC. However, NC was not able to help reverse transcriptase to escape the +3 pausing event. Mutagenesis of a stem structure within the tRNALys.3. vRNA complex led to disappearance of the +3 pausing event as well as to significantly reduced rates of reverse transcription. Thus, this stem structure is essential for optimal reverse transcription, despite its role in promotion of the +3 pausing event.

In addition to base pairing between the PBS sequence and the 3′-terminal region of tRNALys.3, the resulting tRNALys.3·vRNA binary complex is also characterized by other extensive but specific inter- and intramolecular interactions (1Isel C.

The initiation of (−) strand DNA synthesis from this complex represents a specific stage, during which reverse transcriptase (RT) shows distinct binding and kinetic properties from those of the subsequent elongation stage (4Isel C.

Using an in vitro reaction system, initiation of reverse transcription can be detected by the formation of short intermediate cDNA products after the tRNA primer is extended by 1, 3, or 5 nt (4Isel C.

However, in these studies, reverse transcription had been performed with tRNALys.3·vRNA complexes that were formed by heat annealing. In the virus, however, the tRNA primer is placed onto the viral RNA template by nucleocapsid (NC) sequences of the Gag protein. Therefore, it is important to compare the kinetic features of different RNA complexes that have been formed by either heat or NC annealing.The HIV-1 NC is a small basic protein that can bind to single-stranded nucleic acid. It has two zinc finger motifs, each of which contains zinc ion binding residues, i.e. CCHC, and forms a tight, rigid loop within the protein (8Darlix J.-L. Lapadat-Tapolsky M. de Rocquigny H. Roques B.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 523-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). NC protein exhibits nucleic acid chaperone activity in vitro; it catalyzes the rearrangement of nucleic acid molecules into a thermodynamically stable conformation (9Herschlag D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20871-20874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 10Rein A. Henderson L.E. Levin J.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 297-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). This activity enables NC to participate in reverse transcription at many steps and ensures that highly specific and efficient viral cDNA synthesis will occur. For example, the overall efficiency of negative strand strong-stop DNA ((−) ssDNA) synthesis can be increased in the presence of NC. NC was found to function in this process in two manners, i.e. by facilitating the formation of an active form of tRNALys.3·vRNA complex (11Rong L. Liang C. Hsu M. Kleiman L. Petitjean P. de Rocquigny H. Roques B.P. Wainberg M.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 9353-9358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or by transiently eliminating template secondary structures, at which the RT enzyme stalls (12Rodrı́guez-Rodrı́guez L. Tsuchihashi Z.

Henderson L.E. Copeland T.D. Gorelick R.J. Boche W.J. Rein A. Levin J.G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7132-7142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).To assess the roles of NC protein in initiation of reverse transcription, we employed NC to perform primer placement, and then removed it from the system by proteinase K digestion and phenol:chloroform treatment. This system allows reverse transcription to proceed from a NC-derived tRNALys.3·vRNA complex, while avoiding the direct involvement of NC in the reactions at the same time. These results showed that the tRNALys.3·vRNA complex that is formed by NC is already active, and can overcome +1 nt pausing during subsequent polymerization without the further involvement of NC. Therefore, NC, acting as an RNA chaperone, assists in the formation of a more functional RNA complex rather than a more thermostable one, as is obtained by heat annealing of tRNA primer onto the PBS. The zinc finger motifs of NC were found to be important in this regard, as indicated by experiments using H23C NC, which includes a point mutation within the first zinc finger structure, and ddNC, in which both zinc fingers are replaced by Gly-Gly linkages.We further studied the causes of the +3 pausing event either with or without NC protein in the reactions. To pursue this subject, systematic mutagenesis studies were performed to disrupt a stem structure that is formed by RNA template sequences within the tRNALys.3·vRNA complex. Finally, we have compared early pausing patterns of reverse transcription from tRNALys.3·vRNA complexes derived by heat annealing, NC-mediated annealing, and within virions. Our results show that, in contrast to the tRNALys.3·vRNA complexes formed by heat annealing, the RNA complexes that are either derived from virions or formed by NC annealing barely pause at the +1 stage during initiation of reverse transcription.DISCUSSIONHIV-1 NC is a small basic protein, containing two zinc finger motifs of the CX 2CX 4HX 4C form. NC has been demonstrated to function as an RNA-chaperone protein in a wide variety of cell-free systems. It promotes annealing of complementary nucleic acid sequences (36Dib-Hajj F. Khan R.

During the viral life cycle, NC has been shown to function at multiple steps, including viral RNA packaging and dimerization, virion assembly, reverse transcription, integration, and transcription (8Darlix J.-L.

Because of these features, it has become an attractive target for the design of potential anti-HIV compounds.Our studies focused on the RNA-chaperone activity of HIV-1 NC protein during the annealing of tRNALys.3 to viral RNA template containing the PBS. In a previous study, we found that the tRNALys.3·vRNA initiation complex, formed in the presence of NC, resulted in elevated efficiency of the switch from initiation to elongation in the subsequent synthesis of (−) ssDNA; the zinc finger motifs of NC were required for this activity (11Rong L. Liang C. Hsu M. Kleiman L. Petitjean P. de Rocquigny H. Roques B.P. Wainberg M.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 9353-9358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this work, we have shown that the role of NC during initiation of reverse transcription, i.e. the release of pausing from the +1 nt position, was also the result of the activity of NC during the tRNA annealing process. An intact zinc finger structure was indispensable for this specific activity.On the basis of these observations, the following conclusions regarding the RNA-chaperone activity of HIV-1 NC can be drawn. (i) An RNA complex with the most thermostable structure, i.e. that formed by heat annealing, may not always be the most functional. (ii) The RNA-chaperone mechanism to explain the formation of the most stable RNA complexes includes a transient base pair destabilization, followed by random re-pairing until the maximal number of base pairs is reached (9Herschlag D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20871-20874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar,10Rein A. Henderson L.E. Levin J.G. Trends Biochem.

Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6121-6126Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). However, in our system, NC was shown to assist in the formation of a functional RNA complex rather than a thermostable one. This shows that a random or nonspecific model does not fit well with our findings. (iii) Zinc finger motifs were found to be important; this provides further evidence that specific interactions between protein and RNA may involve in the proper folding of the tRNALys.3·vRNA complex. Therefore, the tRNALys.3·vRNA complex formed in the presence of HIV-1 NC protein is a specialized one, which may involve both nonspecific and specific interactions between the protein and the RNA.Previous studies have shown that it is the basic residues rather than the zinc finger motifs of NC protein that are essential for its RNA-chaperone activity (8Darlix J.-L. Lapadat-Tapolsky M. de Rocquigny H. Roques B.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 523-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 10Rein A. Henderson L.E. Levin J.G. Trends Biochem.

A. 1992; 89: 6472-6476Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In agreement, we found that mutations of the zinc fingers did not affect the tRNA primer annealing capability of NC protein (11Rong L. Liang C. Hsu M. Kleiman L. Petitjean P. de Rocquigny H. Roques B.P. Wainberg M.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 9353-9358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the tRNALys.3·vRNA binary complex that was formed in the presence of zinc finger mutated NC showed a lower efficiency of initiation of reverse transcription in this work; this is consistent with our previous data, which showed that such mutated NC was less efficient at mediating switch from initiation to elongation (11Rong L. Liang C. Hsu M. Kleiman L. Petitjean P. de Rocquigny H. Roques B.P. Wainberg M.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 9353-9358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar conclusions have been drawn from in vivo studies, in which sequences between the two Cys-His boxes of NC were found to be essential for packaging and placement of tRNALys.3, whereas mutations that showed the most deleterious effects in regard to initiation of reverse transcription were those that mapped to either of the two NC Cys-His boxes (49Huang Y. Khorchid A. Gabor J. Wang J. Li X. Darlix J.-L. Wainberg M.A. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 3907-3915Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The zinc finger-dependent nucleic acid chaperone activity of NCp7 has also been reported in other in vitro systems. For example, although NC (12–53) can promote the efficient annealing of tRNALys.3 to the PBS, modification of the first zinc finger in this truncated form of NC led to a large reduction in its primer annealing capacity (50Remy E. de Rocquigny H. Petitjean P. Muriaux D. Theileux V. Paoletti J. Roques B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4819-4822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Zn2+-binding residues were also found to play important roles during minus and plus strand transfer during HIV-1 reverse transcription, by promoting the unfolding of highly structured RNA and DNA strand transfer intermediates (51Guo J. Wu T. Anderson J. Kane B.F. Johnson D.G. Gorelick R.J. Henderson L.E. Levin J.G. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8980-8988Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The helix-coil transition of single DNA molecules has been measured through use of an optical tweezer instrument; intact zinc finger structures were shown to be indispensable for two essential activities of NC, i.e. to destabilize double-stranded DNA and to decrease the cooperativity of the helix-coil transition (47Williams M.C. Rouzina I. Wenner J.R. Gorelick R.J. Musier-Forsyth K. Bloomfield V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6121-6126Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Such prolonged intermediate states between the helix and coil induced by NC may provide an good environment for the specific recognition of nucleotides by zinc finger motifs, which may lead to formation of a reverse transcription competent tRNALys.3·vRNA complex, as shown both in this paper and in previous reports (11Rong L. Liang C. Hsu M. Kleiman L. Petitjean P. de Rocquigny H. Roques B.P. Wainberg M.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 9353-9358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In contrast to the +1 nt pausing event, the +3 nt position cannot be bypassed by the presence of NC protein during the annealing process. Similar differences in formation of the +1 and +3 nt pause sites were also observed in our previous studies. For example, initiation of reverse transcription paused at the +3 nt site, whenever tRNALys.3 or a DNA primer was employed; however, the +1 nt intermediate product disappeared when RT reactions were primed from an oligo DNA (7Liang C.

In vitro probing data have described the existence of a 8-base pair stem structure, located at the fourth nt position upstream of the PBS within the tRNALys.3·vRNA complex (1Isel C. Marquet R. Keith G. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25269-25272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Isel C. Ehresmann C. Keith G. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. J. Mol.

Accordingly, we reasoned that reverse transcription must have paused after the third nucleotide was incorporated to dissolve the base pairs of the stem structure. To prove this point, we introduced a series of mutations into the viral RNA template, such that the stem structure was deliberately destabilized. Our results show that reverse transcription of RNA templates containing these mutations no longer paused at the +3 nt position, regardless of whether a heat annealing or NC annealing method was employed.As stated, the arrest of RT reactions at the +3 nt stage is caused by the existence of the stem within the tRNALys.3·vRNA complex. In addition, the introduction of mutations that altered either the structure (N1, N2, N3, and N4) or the position (N7, N8) of the stem resulted in less efficient initiation of reverse transcription, as shown in Fig. 5 (A, B, and E); this effect was most pronounced in the case of the N2 and N8 mutated templates (Fig. 5, A and E). In contrast, the N5, N6, N9, and N10 templates represent constructs that preserved stem structure, whereas sequences within the stem were changed. The overall efficiency of initiation of RT reactions performed with these templates approached wild-type levels, although the switch from the +3 to the +5 stage was compromised. Therefore, as long as the stem structure was not disturbed, or the distance of the stem from the PBS remained unchanged, the tRNA·vRNA complex would remain functional, and an optimal initiation rate of reverse transcription would be achieved. Because of its special position within the tRNA·vRNA complex, the stem structure studied may help to promote efficient reverse transcription by stabilizing two adjacent intermolecular interactions between the primer and the template, i.e. the PBS/3′ end of tRNA and the A-rich loop/anti-codon loop of tRNA; both of these are essential for the efficient initiation of (−) ssDNA synthesis (4Isel C.

Virol. 1999; 73: 1818-1827Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Although its structure is key, the sequence of the stem can also affect the efficiency of reverse transcription. For example, the sequence of the right half of the stem structure was found to be important in the switch from the +3 nt pause site to a even later initiation intermediate at the +5 nt position. Reverse transcription of the N5 and N6 templates, which exchanged base pair sequences without disturbance of the stem structure, barely proceeded beyond the +3 stage, although the reaction was initiated in near normal fashion (Fig. 5 E). The fidelity of reverse transcription was also affected when sequences on the right half of the stem were mutated (Fig. 5 B).The sequence within/around the stem structure may also affect patterns of pausing during initiation of reverse transcription. For instance, in the experiments performed with the N7 and N8 templates, bands at the +5 and +8 nt positions were visible in addition to the expected pause sites at +6 and +9 (Fig. 5 F). The question that arises is whether it is the sequence or the stem structure that determines the +3 pause site. Fig. 5 (A and E) answers this because disruption of the stem structure in the RNA templates N1 and N2 eliminated pausing at the +3 site (Fig. 5 A). Restoration of stem base pairing by second-site mutations in the N5 and N6 RNA templates led to reappearance of the +3 pause site (Fig. 5 E). Thus, formation of the specific pause site at the +3 nt position is a result of the existence of the stem structure rather than of specific RNA sequences.This conclusion is further supported through experiments performed with constructs N9 and N10, in which the stem structure that had been destabilized by the N3 and N4 mutations was restored by second-site compensatory mutations (Fig. 6, A and B). The results of Fig. 6 C show that the +3 pause event that was eliminated in experiments performed with the N3 and N4 templates was reestablished when the N9 and N10 RNA templates were used (Fig. 6 C). Thus, the pause event at the +3 nt site is highly specific and is caused by the stem structure located at the fourth nucleotide upstream of the PBS, even though it is also true that other template sequences proximal to the PBS can affect patterns of pausing to a limited extent.In general, our mechanistic studies of early pausing events and the role of the NC protein in this process contribute further to an understanding of the initiation of reverse transcription. First, we have demonstrated that the +1 pausing event is a distinct rate-limiting step during initiation, because it can only be observed when RNA is used to prime reverse transcription (7Liang C. Rong L. Götte M. Li X. Quan Y. Kleiman L. Wainberg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21309-21315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and because the addition of NC protein containing intact zinc finger motifs can help RT to escape this pause site. Second, the presence of the +3 nt pausing event is solely a result of the specific secondary structure of the tRNALys.3·vRNA complex. Therefore, the mechanisms responsible for the formation of these distinct intermediate products during initiation of HIV-1 reverse transcription are different.Finally, early pause events at the +3 and +5 nt positions were observed when tRNALys.3·vRNA was prepared from virus particles, indicating that similar initiation events also transpire in the virus. However, comparison of relative amounts of each short cDNA product revealed that the initiation complex, isolated from the virus, more closely resemble that annealed by NC than that prepared by heat annealing (Fig. 8). This implies that NC protein plays an important role during initiation of reverse transcription both in vitro and in vivo. HIV-11 reverse transcription is initiated as its cognate primer tRNALys.3is annealed onto the primer binding site (PBS) of viral RNA template (vRNA). In addition to base pairing between the PBS sequence and the 3′-terminal region of tRNALys.3, the resulting tRNALys.3·vRNA binary complex is also characterized by other extensive but specific inter- and intramolecular interactions (1Isel C.

The initiation of (−) strand DNA synthesis from this complex represents a specific stage, during which reverse transcriptase (RT) shows distinct binding and kinetic properties from those of the subsequent elongation stage (4Isel C. Lanchy J.M. Le Grice S.F. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 917-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Using an in vitro reaction system, initiation of reverse transcription can be detected by the formation of short intermediate cDNA products after the tRNA primer is extended by 1, 3, or 5 nt (4Isel C.

However, in these studies, reverse transcription had been performed with tRNALys.3·vRNA complexes that were formed by heat annealing. In the virus, however, the tRNA primer is placed onto the viral RNA template by nucleocapsid (NC) sequences of the Gag protein. Therefore, it is important to compare the kinetic features of different RNA complexes that have been formed by either heat or NC annealing. The HIV-1 NC is a small basic protein that can bind to single-stranded nucleic acid. It has two zinc finger motifs, each of which contains zinc ion binding residues, i.e. CCHC, and forms a tight, rigid loop within the protein (8Darlix J.-L. Lapadat-Tapolsky M. de Rocquigny H.

Around 1975 and during the following years it was shown that these endogenous peptides and the opiates address the same receptor family (1Beeley N.R.A. Drug Discov.

In most cases, these agonists are based on a peptide backbone structure and contain unusual or modified amino acid side chains. Several of these agonists were developed on the basis of previously established antagonists for the same receptor. In earlier studies we had investigated the requirements for peptide binding by major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I)1 molecules (9Udaka K. Wiesmüller K.-H. Kienle S. Jung G. Walden P. J.

Biochem. 1996; 236: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). MHC molecules are peptide receptors that control antigen-specific immune responses by T cells. They bind peptides derived from proteins through limited proteolysis and present them at the surfaces of cells (11Barber L.D. Parham P. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 163-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). There are two classes of MHC molecules; the class I molecules (MHC-I) present peptides derived predominantly from internally expressed proteins, and the class II molecules present peptides derived mostly from endocytosed proteins. MHC-I molecules are heterodimers of a 45-kDa α-chain encoded by the polymorphic genes of the MHC and the non-covalently associated invariant 12-kDa β2-microglobulin (12Bjorkman P.J. Saper M.A. Samraoui B. Bennety W.S. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1987; 329: 506-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (2766) Google Scholar). The peptides are usually 8–10 amino acids long (13Falk K. Rötzschke O. Stevanovic S. Jung G. Rammensee H. Nature. 1991; 351: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (2132) Google Scholar) and are bound in a groove framed by two α-helices on top of a β-pleated sheet (14Fremont D. Matsumura M. Stura E. Peterson P. Wilson I. Science. 1992; 257: 919-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). They are bound in extended conformation with the C- and N-terminal charges compensated by complementary MHC residues. Extensive hydrogen bonding between the peptide main chain and MHC side chains contribute to sequence-independent binding, whereas peptide sequence-specific binding is controlled largely by polymorphic MHC side chains that form MHC allele-specific pockets inside the peptide binding groove that accommodate two dominant and several subdominant anchor amino acid side chains of the T cell epitopes (15Matsumura M. Fremont D.H. Peterson P.A. Wilson I.A. Science. 1992; 257: 927-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). The conformational stability of the MHC molecule largely depends on the presence of peptide, which, therefore, can be seen as an integral part of the protein (16Bouvier M. Wiley D.C. Science. 1994; 265: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The energy required for melting the protein structure is tripled by the incorporation of a suitable peptide (17Fahnestock M.L. Tamir I. Narhi L. Bjorkman P.J. Science. 1992; 258: 1658-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The structural requirements for peptide selection by MHC molecules follows rules that are reminiscent of the packing of the core of a typical globular protein rather than for typical receptor ligand interaction. On average, more than 80% of the molecular surface of the peptide is buried inside the MHC molecular structure, and less than 20% is exposed to the outside and accessible for binding by the antigen receptor (T cell receptor (TCR)) of MHC I-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Thus, MHC-dependent antigen recognition by T cells is based on a highly constrained one-ligand-two-receptors system that is focused on the constitutional elements of peptide structures. The complex composed of the ovalbumin-derived octapeptide SIINFEKL (18Rötzschke O. Falk K. Stevanovic S. Jung G. Walden P. Rammensee H.G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 2891-2894Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar) and the mouse MHC-I molecule H-2Kb has been dissected by various analyses on the protein chemical as well as crystallographic level (18Rötzschke O. Falk K. Stevanovic S. Jung G. Walden P. Rammensee H.G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 2891-2894Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Peptides, naturally presented by H-2Kb, are preferentially octapeptides with an amino acid with an aromatic side chain at position 5 and an aliphatic side chain at position 8 (13Falk K. Rötzschke O. Stevanovic S. Jung G. Rammensee H. Nature. 1991; 351: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (2132) Google Scholar). The binding of these motive amino acids into the binding pocket of the MHC molecules involves hydrophobic effects and π-stacking in the case of the aromatic side chain and hydrophobic interaction in the case of the aliphatic side chain (14Fremont D. Matsumura M. Stura E. Peterson P. Wilson I. Science. 1992; 257: 919-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar, 15Matsumura M. Fremont D.H. Peterson P.A. Wilson I.A. Science. 1992; 257: 927-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Positional scans done either by replacing the peptide amino acid with alanine or by using peptide libraries that carried a defined amino acid at one sequence position and randomized mixtures of the proteinogenic amino acids at all others have confirmed the importance of the anchor positions for peptide binding by H-2Kb (19Fremont D.H.

These positions were found to be relatively tolerant to amino acid variations, whereas anchor positions 5 and 8 were the most restrictive sites. At positions 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8, a preference for hydrophobic side chains was found. The crystal structures of H-2Kb in complex with three different peptides including SIINFEKL provided detailed information on the interactions of peptide and MHC residues and, again, confirmed the importance of the typical structural features of the peptide for its interaction with the MHC side chains (14Fremont D. Matsumura M. Stura E. Peterson P. Wilson I. Science. 1992; 257: 919-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar, 15Matsumura M. Fremont D.H. Peterson P.A. Wilson I.A.

Non-peptide mimetics of T cell epitopes with agonist properties and improved biostability and bioavailability might become useful for the development of vaccines and immune therapeutics. To explore the possibilities for such non-peptide TCR agonists, we had designed and synthesized a series of oligomers derived from the T cell epitope SIINFEKL by replacing the structurally most constrained C-terminal part of the peptide (positions 4–8) by a poly-N-acylated amine (PAA) spacer (21Bianco A. Brock C. Zabel C. Walk T. Walden P. Jung G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28759-28765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In these PAAs, the side chains branch off the amines of the main chain. Several defined oligomers and oligomer libraries were synthesized and assayed for binding to the MHC-I H-2Kb. In these experiments, first, the optimal binding geometry was determined by testing a series of 12 defined structures with different main chain variations. Second, based on the structure with the highest binding efficiency, randomized libraries with 26 different aromatic, heteroaromatic, and pseudoaromatic side chains at the central position (Fig. 1) and four different aliphatic side chains at position 8 were tested. Finally, the most potent library was deconvoluted to identify the best H-2Kb ligand. In the present study we used the ligands derived from the most active combinatorial oligomer library to identify TCR agonists that are recognized by and can stimulate the SIINFEKL-specific T cell clone 4G3 and that prime naive T cells in vivo. The solid phase synthesis of the poly-N-acylated amines was described in detail elsewhere (21Bianco A. Brock C. Zabel C. Walk T. Walden P. Jung G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28759-28765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly, all reagents, amino acids, and solvents were purchased from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland), Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI), Novabiochem (Läufelfingen, Switzerland), or Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Trityl chloride resin was obtained from PepChem (Tübingen, Germany). The oligomers were synthesized manually in small syringes fitted with a frit up until the introduction of the last three N-terminal amino acids; this was performed on a simultaneous multiple peptide synthesizer (SMPS 350, Zinsser Analytic, Frankfurt; Software Syro, MultiSynTech, Bochum, Germany), using Fmoc/tBu strategy. After the first C-terminal amino acid, the flexible spacer was introduced using a bromocarboxylic acid derivative and a free diamine. The latter was orthogonally protected with 2-acetyldimedone at the primary amino function (21Bianco A. Brock C. Zabel C. Walk T. Walden P. Jung G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28759-28765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Each PAA was acylated at the secondary amino group with the corresponding carboxylic acid building blocks (BB) (Fig. 1), preactivated with 1-hydroxybenzotriazole/diisopropylcarbodiimide in dimethylformamide for 30 min, and subsequently added to the resin. The products were analyzed by on-line HPLC-electrospray mass spectrometry. After being cleaved off the resin, the analytical RP-HPLC showed a purity of oligomers ranging from 60 to 81% with the exception of PAA17 with only 34% purity (Table I). The synthesis of PAA30 yielded a mixture of unidentified by-products. All of the compounds were tested without further purification. Also, the crude compounds PAA17 and PAA30 were used in the binding and cytolysis assays.Table IAnalytical data of the PAAs used in the presented studyCompoundsRT1-aRP-HPLC with a linear gradient of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water (A) and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile (B), 10–100% B in 45 min at 0.3 ml/min flow rate; detection at 214 nm.ESI-MSPurity1-bCrude products after the cleavage from the resin.CompoundsRT1-aRP-HPLC with a linear gradient of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water (A) and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile (B), 10–100% B in 45 min at 0.3 ml/min flow rate; detection at 214 nm.ESI-MSPurity1-bCrude products after the cleavage from the resin.min−1 %min−1%PAA619.2762.5 75PAA2516.8799.069PAA1317.5738.0 76PAA2619.5801.075PAA1414.7749.0 69PAA2718.3805.074PAA1516.1750.5 81PAA2816.5805.074PAA1618.2754.5 68PAA2919.9806.075PAA1714.9763.5 341-cA trifluoroacetylated compound (RT 19.6, molecular weight 859.5) was also present (34%).PAA30ND1-dND, not detected.NDNDPAA1819.5778.0 78PAA3121.7812.075PAA1917.0778.5 79PAA3222.4824.072PAA2019.8780.0 71PAA3320.3827.571PAA2120.5788.0 73PAA3422.0828.067PAA2219.3792.0 80PAA3520.2835.060PAA2319.1792.5 79PAA3622.9844.074PAA2419.9794.0 74PAA3722.6856.0681-a RP-HPLC with a linear gradient of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water (A) and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile (B), 10–100% B in 45 min at 0.3 ml/min flow rate; detection at 214 nm.1-b Crude products after the cleavage from the resin.1-c A trifluoroacetylated compound (RT 19.6, molecular weight 859.5) was also present (34%).1-d ND, not detected.

Kienle S. Jung G. Walden P. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 2097-2108Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The products were purified by reversed phase HPLC and their quality analyzed by analytical RP-HPLC and mass spectrometry. C57Bl10 mice were immunized by injecting into the peritoneum 20 μg of PAA mixed with 100 μg of lactate dehydrogenase as helper T cell-inducing antigen and 10 μg of the lipopeptide (Pam)3-Cys-Ser-(Lys)4 (where Pam means palmitoyl) as an adjuvant (22Borges E. Wiesmuller K.H. Jung G. Walden P. J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 173: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). After 9 days, the spleens were removed, and single spleen cell suspensions were prepared and incubated with 10 μg/ml PAAs and 100 μg/ml lactate dehydrogenase in α-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FCS) for 4 days at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 8% CO2. After this time, lymphoblasts were harvested and cultured for 10 more days in the same medium but without the antigens. These primed T cells were then re-stimulated with irradiated spleen cells that had been pulsed for 1 h at room temperature with the PAAs but without the helper antigen lactate dehydrogenase. The culture medium for this and subsequent re-stimulations was α-MEM with 10% FCS and 3% of a supernatant of concanavalin A-stimulated rat spleen cells, which corresponds to a final concentration of interleukin-2 in the culture medium of 50 units/ml. The cytolysis assays were done on days 4 or 5 after re-stimulation. The PAA6-specific line was cloned by limiting dilution yielding the CD8+ CTL clone AB3C used in this study. H-2Kb binding of the oligomers was tested by a stabilization assay as described in detail elsewhere (9Udaka K. Wiesmüller K.-H. Kienle S. Jung G. Walden P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24130-24134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) by making use of the dependence of the structural integrity of the MHC class molecules on the presence of ligand in their peptide binding groove. Briefly, the peptides and PAAs were incubated with the peptide transporter-deficient RMA-S cells, which then were tested for the expression of conformationally stable H-2Kbusing the conformation-sensitive monoclonal H-2Kb-specific antibody B8.24.3.

Open table in a new tab (20). The SIINFEKL-specific CTL clone 4G3 was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FCS and growth factor (supernatant of concanavalin A-stimulated rat spleen cells at a concentration of interleukin-2 in culture of 50 units/ml) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 8% CO2. The CTL were re-stimulated biweekly with the OVA transgenic thymoma cell line EG7.OVA. Tumor cells, RMA-S (H-2b), EG7.OVA (H-2b, OVA) and LB (H-2bxd) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% FCS. In the case of EG7.OVA, 100 μg/ml G418 was included in the medium to maintain the selection for the transgene. The indicated target cells were labeled with 51Cr and pulsed or not with the peptides or oligomers at the indicated concentrations in α-MEM, 0.1% bovine serum albumin. After 30 min the CTL were added in α-MEM, 20% FCS at the indicated effector to target ratios, and the cultures were continued at 37 °C for 5 h. Radioactivity released from the target cells was measured in solid scintillator plates using a 96-well plate β-counter (Packard Instrument Co.). The percent specific 51Cr release was calculated as follows: (experimental cpm − background cpm)/(total cpm − background cpm) × 100. The PAAs used in the present study were derived from the H 2Kb-restricted OVA T cell epitope SIINFEKL by replacing the backbone of the C-terminal part of the peptide including sequence positions 4–8 by a poly-N-acylated amine structure. To establish the optimal length of this new backbone, a series of oligomers had been synthesized previously and tested for binding to the MHC-I molecule H-2Kb. These new ligands were characterized by aromatic, heteroaromatic, and pseudoaromatic side chains (Fig.1) at a central position, a leucine residue at the C-terminal position, and polyamine spacer of different lengths and compositions between the two anchoring positions (21Bianco A. Brock C. Zabel C. Walk T. Walden P. Jung G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28759-28765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). PAA6 bound most efficiently to and stabilized H-2Kb. To then identify the optimal side chain constitution at the central and the C-terminal anchor position, a combinatorial library based on PAA6 was prepared by introducing a mixture of the building blocks BB6 and BB13–BB37 into the central and a mixture of the aliphatic protein amino acid side chains into the C-terminal position (21Bianco A. Brock C. Zabel C. Walk T. Walden P. Jung G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28759-28765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This doubly randomized oligomer library was deconvoluted by, first, establishing the optimal C-terminal side chain and, second, with a leucine residue at this position, testing the N-acylated side chains shown in Fig. 1 at the central anchor position. All of the resulting oligomers bound to and stabilized H-2Kb, however, with different levels of efficiency, as reported earlier (21Bianco A. Brock C. Zabel C. Walk T. Walden P. Jung G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28759-28765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In the present study these 26 oligomers, derived from the library de-convolution, were tested for their capacity to stimulate T cell responses. Prerequisite for such responses is the simultaneous binding of the oligomers by the MHC-I molecule H-2Kb and the antigen receptor of the T cell. 4G3, which was established by immunizing mice with the OVA-expressing EG7-OVA cells and which is specific for the T cell epitope SIINFEKL was employed for these initial analyses. To enhance the efficiency of MHC binding, RMA-S were used as target cells in these experiments (9Udaka K. Wiesmüller K.-H. Kienle S. Jung G. Walden P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24130-24134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 20Udaka K. Wiesmüller K.-H. Kienle S. Jung G. Walden P. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 2097-2108Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These cells lack the transporter associated with antigen processing and are, therefore, devoid of internal MHC-bound peptides. 51Cr release from radiolabeled target cells upon cytolysis by 4G3 was used as the read-out for T cell activation. The results of these analyses are shown in Fig. 2. The responses to the control peptides are shown in the first panel. SIINFEKL is the cognate peptide for the CTL clone 4G3 and induces a potent response. SIINFEDL is an antagonist of SIINFEKL and, as the independent VSV-derived epitope RGYVYQGL (23van Bleek G.M. Nathenson S.G. Nature. 1990; 348: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar), was not capable of inducing cytolysis by 4G3. Already the parental oligomer PAA6 stimulates 4G3 to lyse the target cells. It is, however, surpassed in its potency by the derivative PAA22. PAA13, -15, -17, -25, -27–30, -32, -33, and -36 also induce high levels of CTL responses, which are comparable with the activity found for PAA6. PAA19–23, -26, -31, and -34 induced only low levels of cytolysis at high concentrations. PAA14, -16, -18, -20, -24, -35, and -37 were completely inactive. To establish dose-response relationships for the oligomers, a more detailed titration of the concentrations required for the induction of cytolysis of RMA-S cells by 4G3 was done. The results are shown in Fig. 3 and Table II. PAA6 was chosen for these analyses as the original oligomer from which the others were derived. PAA22 was the most potent oligomer, PAA17 and PAA36 are representatives of the high efficiency ligands, PAA34 is a representative of the low efficiency group and PAA24 of the negative group. With concentrations between 0.289 and 12.3 nm required for half-maximal cytolysis of the target cells, the activity of the oligomers is in the same range found for many peptide agonists. Comparing PAA22 with the original PAA6, it was found to be ∼42-fold more efficient in inducing T cell responses. Because the MHC binding of these two PAAs differs only slightly, this increased efficiency is largely caused by an improved binding of the MHC-PAA22 complex by the 4G3 T cell receptor. PAA34 is ∼400-fold less efficient than PAA22 and is comparable with weak peptide agonists. PAA22 is about 46.000 times less efficient in inducing cytolysis by 4G3 than the cognate peptide SIINFEKL. Taking into account that H-2Kb binds this oligomer ∼5,200-fold less efficiently than SIINFEKL, the H-2Kb-PAA22 complex induces cytolysis by 4G3 ∼9-fold less efficiently than the corresponding complex with SIINFEKL. Competition experiments were done to test whether the PAA oligomers bind to the MHC molecules at the same site as known peptide ligands and whether the MHC-oligomer complex and conventional MHC-peptide complexes interact with the TCR in the same way (Figs.4 and 5). The VSV-derived T cell epitope RGYVYQGL, which binds to H-2Kb (23van Bleek G.M. Nathenson S.G. Nature. 1990; 348: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar) but is not recognized by the 4G3 T cell receptor, inhibits 4G3-mediated cytolysis of the RMA-S target cells induced by SIINFEKL and by PAA22 and PAA36, the two most efficient oligomers (Fig. 4). In a reverse setup, the oligomer PAA6 and the library SII-X–L (21Bianco A. Brock C. Zabel C. Walk T. Walden P. Jung G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28759-28765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) also compete with SIINFEKL for binding to H-2Kb and induction of 4G3 activity as shown in Fig. 5. The controls in this latter experiment were RGYVYQGL, as in the previous experiment, a variant of this peptide with tyrosine at the C terminus and SIINFEDL, which is a potent antagonist of SIINFEKL. SII-X–L is less potent as an inhibitor than PAA6. Because both oligomers are agonists (weak agonists when compared with SIINFEKL), the cytolysis observed is a balance of competition with SIINFEKL for MHC binding and their own agonist activity. The difference between the results for PAA6 and SII-X–L is in accordance with the less efficient MHC-binding capacity of the latter ((21), Table II, and Fig. 5).Figure 5Inhibition of the SIINFEKL-induced cytolysis by the peptide RGYVYQGL or its variant RGYVYQGY, SIINFEDL, PAA6, and SII-X–L.

The in vivo induced cytotoxic T cells that tested positive for CD8 (data not shown) were analyzed in vitro for their specificity using RMA-S cells as targets and PAA6 and -22 as antigens, as well as SIINFEKL and SIINFEDL as control peptides. As shown in Fig. 6, these cells lysed the target cells in the presence of PAA22. No cross-recognition of SIINFEDL was ever observed. Also, PAA6 and SIINFEKL were recognized by the PAA22-primed T cells, but the degree of cross-reactivity varied from experiment to experiment. Fig. 6 shows two representative experiments. PAA6 was itself a potent antigen in C57Bl/10 mice as shown in Fig. 7. In this case the mice were immunized as before but with PAA6 instead of PAA22. In contrast to the PAA22-primed cell lines, none of several established PAA6-induced CD8+ T cell lines cross-recognized SIINFEKL.Figure 7Priming of mice in vivo with PAA6. Mice were immunized with PAA6 as described for PAA22 (see legend for Fig. 6). The resulting PAA6-specific cytotoxic T cell line was cloned by limiting dilution, and the clones were expanded.

Fremont D.H. Peterson P.A. Wilson I.A. Science. 1992; 257: 927-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). MHC-I molecules bind the peptides in extended conformation by forming a number of molecular interactions with the terminal main chain charges, specific side chains, and the peptide bonds of the main chain. The peptide is thereby forged into a conformation that exposes only a few side chain residues to the outside of the complexes for interaction with the T cell receptor. The specificity of the T cell response depends on these few residues (9Udaka K. Wiesmüller K.-H. Kienle S. Jung G. Walden P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24130-24134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar,24Gundlach B.R. Wiesmuller K.H. Junt T. Kienle S. Jung G. Walden P. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 3645-3651PubMed Google Scholar). Despite these constraints, it is possible, as demonstrated by the data presented herein, to design non-peptide mimics that bind to MHC-I molecules and induce T cell responses. The dose-response analyses for these oligomers reveals that they are about six orders of magnitudes less efficient in inducing responses by the T cell clone 4G3 than its cognate ligand SIINFEKL (18Rötzschke O. Falk K. Stevanovic S. Jung G. Walden P. Rammensee H.G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 2891-2894Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). However, half-maximal T cell-induced cytolysis is achieved with nm concentrations of the oligomer, which is comparable with many T cell epitopes. A comparison of the peptide and PAA concentrations required for half-maximal saturation of the MHC molecule H-2Kb (21Bianco A. Brock C. Zabel C. Walk T. Walden P. Jung G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28759-28765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) shows that the reduced efficiency of the PAA for T cell stimulation is mainly due to their less efficient binding to the MHC-I molecule and to a lesser degree to the recognition of the resulting MHC-oligomer complex by the TCR. This observation is consistent with the high degree of rotational freedom of the PAA backbone compared with the more constrained peptide bonds. Once bound by the MHC molecule, PAAs seem to compare well with peptides in their capacity to stimulate T cell responses. The optimized PAAs are not only recognized by the established T cell clone 4G3 but can also induce primary T cell responses in vivo in mice. In extensive experiments using combinatorial peptide libraries, 4G3 had been found before to display a relatively high degree of degeneracy (25Walden P. Wiesmüller K.-H. Jung G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 678-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This finding might explain the relative ease and the relatively high yield of the identification of cross-recognized PAAs in the experiments presented herein. Analyses of the specificity of T cell lines and clones induced in mice with PAA6 and -22 show that these two oligomers address different T cell repertoires, which also differ from the repertoire induced by SIINFEKL. Divergent T cell repertoires addressed by sets of ligands defined with a single T cell clone have been shown and discussed before for a number of T cells and peptides (24Gundlach B.R. Wiesmuller K.H. Junt T. Kienle S. Jung G. Walden P. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 3645-3651PubMed Google Scholar). The mode of binding to the MHC-I molecules H-2Kb of the active PAA seems to be similar to the way in which peptides bind. This conclusion is supported by the observation that independent H 2Kb-binding peptides are competitive inhibitors of the PAAs and that the PAAs, in turn, suppress the T cell response to the cognate epitope of 4G3 SIINFEKL. However, comparing the constitution of the aromatic, heteroaromatic, and pseudoaromatic building blocks that induce T cell responses with those that are negative reveals no clearly identifiable structure-function relationship. Neither the bulkiness of these side chains, the numbers of aromatic rings, nor the presence or absence of polar groups or heteroatoms correlate with the biological activity. The most potent PAA carries a p-methoxybenzyl side chain (PAA22). The small furan side chain (BB13) is as active as the very bulky biphenyl side chain (BB32), whereas the small thiophene side chain (BB16) is inactive. Similarly, the difference in activity between BB6 (benzyl side chain) and BB22 (p-methoxybenzyl side chain), both potent T cell inducers, and BB19 (p-hydroxybenzyl side chain) and BB20 (p-fluorobenzyl side chain), which are either only very marginally active or completely negative, cannot be easily explained. If the PAAs bind to the MHC molecules in the same way as peptides, then all of these BBs should be inserted into the pocket for the central aromatic anchor amino acid side chain of peptides and thus point into the MHC-I molecule and away from the T cell receptor. Yet, the different BBs have strikingly different effects on the responses of the T cells. In an earlier study we were able to show that hydroxylation of one of the nitrogens of the peptide backbone of the SIINFEKL epitope, which is also hidden inside the MHC molecule, can affect T cell responses and, for instance, render an agonist peptide into an antagonist (26Hin S. Zabel C. Bianco A. Jung G. Walden P. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2363-2367PubMed Google Scholar). These two examples demonstrate that very subtle changes at epitope sites that are buried inside the MHC molecule and that are not accessible to the T cell receptor can result in differences in the binding of the complex by the receptor that translate into substantially different cellular responses. Even more striking with respect to structure-function relationships is the fact that PAAs induce specific reactions of the 4G3 T cell clone at all, although they lack side chains at the positions that correspond to the peptide sequence positions 4, 6, and 7. In SIINFEKL these three sequence positions carry asparagine, glutamate, and lysine, respectively, which are the most prominently exposed side chains and crucially important for the induction of T cell responses. Various experiments have shown that the replacement of one of these amino acids by alanine can abolish the T cell response. It thus appears that the TCR of 4G3 interacts differently with the MHC-PAA complex than with the MHC-SIINFEKL complex. The interaction of a single TCR with two very different MHC peptide complexes has been shown for the T cell clone 2C (27Brock R. Wiesmüller K.-H. Jung G. Walden P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13108-13113Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 28Speir J.A. Garcia K.C. Brunmark A. Degano M. Peterson P.A. Teyton L. Wilson I.A. Immunity. 1998; 8: 553-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In this case, an altered orientation of one of the complementarity-determining region loops of the TCR generates a different interaction surface with different binding properties. PAAs are readily synthesized on solid phase and thereby easily accessible (21Bianco A. Brock C. Zabel C. Walk T. Walden P. Jung G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28759-28765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Their resistance to proteolysis should result in an improved biostability, which might be very interesting for in vivo applications. Also the capacity of the optimized PAAs to exert biological activity at sub-nm concentrations supports the notion that they might constitute an interesting new class of T cells epitope mimetics suitable for in vivo applications. Moreover, these PAAs testify to the fact that it is possible to generate agonistic non-peptide analogues of ligands for peptide receptors.

https://openalex.org/W2007742585,"Although physicists, chemists, and engineers have long had their own salary surveys, no one until recently has tried to keep tabs on the sprawling biological research community. This summer the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), which publishes Science , filled that gap with the first-ever salary survey of its 70,000 life sciences members in the United States.

Members whose primary discipline is a life science make up 65% of the total U.S. AAAS membership. In addition to polling them on their level of compensation, the survey asked a series of questions about their jobs, their careers, and what guidance would be most helpful to the next generation of scientists.

The questionnaire was developed by the AAAS membership office in consultation with other AAAS staff members, salary survey experts, and Shugoll Research of Bethesda, Maryland. It was mailed in June to a sample of 19,000 members, including those with no discipline listed in the AAAS files. The population was limited to those 80 years or younger who are still active professionally. Some 8692 people completed the six-page questionnaire, including 3556 who responded electronically, for a response rate of 46%.

The answers, processed by ReData Inc. of Bethesda and analyzed by Shugoll, yield a wealth of information about how scientists view themselves and their duties as educators, researchers, and life sciences professionals. Although the data remain confidential, some respondents graciously agreed to be interviewed about the survey. We offer capsule descriptions of nine such scientists.

We invite your comments and suggestions on additional topics to be covered, as we plan to repeat this survey.
