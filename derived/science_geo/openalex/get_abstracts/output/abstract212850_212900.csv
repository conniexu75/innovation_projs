Various reports indicate that protein synthesis (particularly collagen)1, carbohydrate metabolism2,3 and fatty acid metabolism4 are impaired. Since these processes require energy, we have investigated, with histochemical methods, the activity of a number of dehydrogenases involved in metabolism."

A finding of considerable interest in their work was that yolk, although comprising only about one-third of the weight of the whole egg, contained most of the selenium in comparison with the white."

These facts suggest that the bond-energy of aryl glycosides may be higher than that of alkyl glycosides or oligosaccharides, so the failure of aryl glycoside formation from alkyl glycosides or oligosaccharides might be due to the insufficiency of the bond energy of the latter. For the biosynthesis of aryl glycoside the intervention of uridine diphosphate sugars has been shown to be needed2. In view of the comparatively high bond energy of sucrose it appeared not unlikely to carry out enzymatic transfer of fructosyl residue of sucrose to phenols leading to the formation of aryl fructoside. The present report describes the enzymatic formation of p-hydroxyphenyl Î²-D-fructo-furanoside from sucrose and hydroquinone and its characterization."

https://openalex.org/W2095241536,"ALTHOUGH the cytoplasm-modifying reaction on toxo-plasmosis as described by Sabin and Feldman1 is a very useful and reliable test, giving reproducible results, a great disadvantage is the necessity for a so-called activator serum of human origin, containing the accessory factor. Such a serum must combine the fact that, when it is mixed with a negative control, the percentage of modified extracellular parasites is low with the presence of accessory factor."
