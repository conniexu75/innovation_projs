https://openalex.org/W2898181981,"The development of whole slide scanners has revolutionized the field of digital pathology. Unfortunately, whole slide scanners often produce images with out-of-focus/blurry areas that limit the amount of tissue available for a pathologist to make accurate diagnosis/prognosis. Moreover, these artifacts hamper the performance of computerized image analysis systems. These areas are typically identified by visual inspection, which leads to a subjective evaluation causing high intra- and inter-observer variability. Moreover, this process is both tedious, and time-consuming. The aim of this study is to develop a deep learning based software called, DeepFocus, which can automatically detect and segment blurry areas in digital whole slide images to address these problems. DeepFocus is built on TensorFlow, an open source library that exploits data flow graphs for efficient numerical computation. DeepFocus was trained by using 16 different H&E and IHC-stained slides that were systematically scanned on nine different focal planes, generating 216,000 samples with varying amounts of blurriness. When trained and tested on two independent datasets, DeepFocus resulted in an average accuracy of 93.2% (± 9.6%), which is a 23.8% improvement over an existing method. DeepFocus has the potential to be integrated with whole slide scanners to automatically re-scan problematic areas, hence improving the overall image quality for pathologists and image analysis algorithms."
https://openalex.org/W2898236608,"Purpose To evaluate the prevalence of dehydration in occupational settings and contextualize findings to effects on performance in cognitively dominated tasks, simple and complex motor tasks during moderate and high heat stress. Methods The study included an occupational part with hydration assessed in five industries across Europe with urine samples collected from 139 workers and analyzed for urine specific gravity. In addition, laboratory experiments included eight male participants completing mild-intensity exercise once with full fluid replacement to maintain euhydration, and once with restricted water intake until the dehydration level corresponded to 2% bodyweight deficit. Following familiarization, euhydration and dehydration sessions were completed on separate days in random order (cross-over design) with assessment of simple motor (target pinch), complex motor (visuo-motor tracking), cognitive (math addition) and combined motor-cognitive (math and pinch) performance at baseline, at 1°C (MOD) and 2°C (HYPER) delta increase in body core temperature. Results The field studies revealed that 70% of all workers had urine specific gravity values ≥1.020 corresponding to the urine specific gravity (1.020±0.001) at the end of the laboratory dehydration session. At this hydration level, HYPER was associated with reductions in simple motor task performance by 4±1%, math task by 4±1%, math and pinch by 9±3% and visuo-motor tracking by 16±4% (all P<0.05 compared to baseline), whereas no significant changes were observed when the heat stress was MOD (P>0.05). In the euhydration session, HYPER reduced complex (tracking) motor performance by 10±3% and simple pinch by 3±1% (both P<0.05, compared to baseline), while performance in the two cognitively dominated tasks were unaffected when dehydration was prevented (P>0.05). Conclusion Dehydration at levels commonly observed across a range of occupational settings with environmental heat stress aggravates the impact of hyperthermia on performance in tasks relying on combinations of cognitive function and motor response accuracy."

The present paper offers a theoretical explication and empirical assessment of the concept of online vigilance, referring to users’ permanent cognitive orientation towards online content and communication as well as their disposition to exploit these options constantly. Based on four studies, a validated and reliable self-report measure of online vigilance was developed. In combination, the results suggest that the Online Vigilance Scale (OVS) shows a stable factor structure in various contexts and user populations and provides future work in communication, psychology, and other social sciences with a new measure of the individual cognitive orientation towards ubiquitous online communication."

The aim of this study is to isolate and to characterize the bacteriophages against Escherichia coli isolated from clinical samples. For isolation of bacteriophages, water samples were collected from the Ganges River, and phage enrichment method was followed for phage isolation. Microbiological, genomic and lyophilization experiments were carried out to characterize the bacteriophage. Galleria mellonella was used to study the potential of phages against E. coli infection. Escherichia phage myPSH1131 belonging to Podoviridae family and found to have broad host range infectivity (n = 31) to infect Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (n = 9), Enteropathogenic E. coli (n = 6), Enterotoxigenic E. coli (n = 3), Enteroaggregative E. coli (n = 3), Uropathogenic E. coli (n = 9) and one unknown E. coli. The genome size is 76,163 base pairs (97 coding regions) and their genes show high similarity to SU10 phage. Lyophilization studies showed that the use of 1M sucrose, 2% gelatin and the combination of both 0.5M sucrose plus 1% gelatin could restore phage viability up to 20 months at 4°C. For in vivo studies, it was observed that a single phage dose can reduce the E. coli infection but to achieve 100% survival rate the infected larvae should be treated with three phage doses (20 μL, 10(3) PFU/mL) at 6 hours interval. The characterized Escherichia phage myPSH1131 was found to have broad host range activity against E. coli pathogens and in vivo studies showed that multiple doses are required for effective treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2806238512,"The Niger Delta region is the oil producing area of Nigeria, which consists of highly diverse ecosystems that are supportive of numerous species of terrestrial and aquatic fauna and flora. Crude oil spills endanger fish hatcheries in coastal water and also contaminate valuable fish. This study examines the effects of oil spills on fish production in the Niger Delta of Nigeria from 1981-2015 using an estimable Cobb Douglas production function. The findings suggest that oil production and spills negatively affect fish production, while farm labour has a positive effect on fish production. On the other hand, fishery loan exerts a negative effect on fish production and this could be ascribed to the bottlenecks in accessing these loans. This study corroborates the findings in literature on the negative concomitance of oil spills and fish production and suggests a cautious approach to oil exploration activities for a sustainable development in the region."
https://openalex.org/W2898383881,"The usefulness of anthropometry to define childhood malnutrition is undermined by poor measurement quality, which led to calls for new measurement approaches. We evaluated the ability of a 3D imaging system to correctly measure child stature (length or height), head circumference and arm circumference. In 2016–7 we recruited and measured children at 20 facilities in and around metro Atlanta, Georgia, USA; including at daycare, higher education, religious, and medical facilities. We selected recruitment sites to reflect a generally representative population of Atlanta and to oversample newborns and children under two years of age. Using convenience sampling, a total of 474 children 0–5 years of age who were apparently healthy and who were present at the time of data collection were included in the analysis. Two anthropometrists each took repeated manual measures and repeated 3D scans of each child. We evaluated the reliability and accuracy of 3D scan-derived measurements against manual measurements. The mean child age was 26 months, and 48% of children were female. Based on reported race and ethnicity, the sample was 42% Black, 28% White, 8% Asian, 21% multiple races, other or race not reported; and 16% Hispanic. Measurement reliability of repeated 3D scans was within 1 mm of manual measurement reliability for stature, head circumference and arm circumference. We found systematic bias when analyzing accuracy—on average 3D imaging overestimated stature and head circumference by 6 mm and 3 mm respectively, and underestimated arm circumference by 2 mm. The 3D imaging system used in this study is reliable, low-cost, portable, and can handle movement; making it ideal for use in routine nutritional assessment. However, additional research, particularly on accuracy, and further development of the scanning and processing software is needed before making policy and clinical practice recommendations on the routine use of 3D imaging for child anthropometry."
https://openalex.org/W2898345296,"Background The absolute neutrophil count (ANC), absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), absolute monocyte count (AMC) and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) are known markers of inflammation. We evaluated whether ANC, ALC, AMC and NLR, both before and after treatment with nivolumab, are indicative markers of overall survival (OS) and evaluated change in NLR as a predictive marker of response in non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with nivolumab. Methods A total of 109 patients with advanced NSCLC treated with nivolumab were included. ANC, ALC, AMC and NLR were examined at initiation of nivolumab therapy and after two cycles. The prognostic role of ANC, ALC, AMC and NLR with OS and changes in NLR ratio were examined with Kaplan-Meier curves and proportional hazard model. Result Post-treatment NLR ≥5 after two cycles of nivolumab was associated with poor OS (median OS in NLR = <5 vs NLR = ≥5 was 29.1 (16.2–40.9) vs 24.2(16.1–36.2) months respectively, p<0.001). In addition NLR increased in non-responders after two cycles of nivolumab by 6.6±21.8 as compared to responders (p = 0.027). Conclusions Post-treatment ANC, ALC and NLR are independent prognostic factors in NSCLC patients treated with nivolumab. Changes in NLR can be an early biomarker for response in NSCLC patients treated with nivolumab."
https://openalex.org/W2898488020,"Understanding the burden and pattern of mental disorders as well as mapping the existing resources for delivery of mental health services in India, has been a felt need over decades. Recognizing this necessity, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, commissioned the National Mental Health Survey (NMHS) in the year 2014–15. The NMHS aimed to estimate the prevalence and burden of mental health disorders in India and identify current treatment gaps, existing patterns of health-care seeking, service utilization patterns, along with an understanding of the impact and disability due to these disorders. This paper describes the design, steps and the methodology adopted for phase 1 of the NMHS conducted in India. The NMHS phase 1 covered a representative population of 39,532 from 12 states across 6 regions of India, namely, the states of Punjab and Uttar Pradesh (North); Tamil Nadu and Kerala (South); Jharkhand and West Bengal (East); Rajasthan and Gujarat (West); Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh (Central) and Assam and Manipur (North East). The NMHS of India (2015–16) is a unique representative survey which adopted a uniform and standardized methodology which sought to overcome limitations of previous surveys. It employed a multi-stage, stratified, random cluster sampling technique, with random selection of clusters based on Probability Proportionate to Size. It was expected that the findings from the NMHS 2015–16 would reveal the burden of mental disorders, the magnitude of the treatment gap, existing challenges and prevailing barriers in the mental-health delivery systems in the country at a single point in time. It is hoped that the results of NMHS will provide the evidence to strengthen and implement mental health policies and programs in the near future and provide the rationale to enhance investment in mental health care in India. It is also hoped that the NMHS will provide a framework for conducting similar population based surveys on mental health and other public health problems in low and middle-income countries."
https://openalex.org/W2898552120,"Stress is proven to have detrimental effects on physical and mental health. Due to different tasks and study designs, the direct consequences of acute stress have been found to be wide-reaching: while some studies report prosocial effects, others report increases in antisocial behavior, still others report no effect. To control for specific effects of different stressors and to consider the role of social anxiety in stress-related social behavior, we investigated the effects of social versus physical stress on behavior in male participants possessing different levels of social anxiety. In a randomized, controlled two by two design we investigated the impact of social and physical stress on behavior in healthy young men. We found significant influences on various subjective increases in stress by physical and social stress, but no interaction effect. Cortisol was significantly increased by physical stress, and the heart rate was modulated by physical and social stress as well as their combination. Social anxiety modulated the subjective stress response but not the cortisol or heart rate response. With respect to behavior, our results show that social and physical stress interacted to modulate trust, trustworthiness, and sharing. While social stress and physical stress alone reduced prosocial behavior, a combination of the two stressor modalities could restore prosociality. Social stress alone reduced nonsocial risk behavior regardless of physical stress. Social anxiety was associated with higher subjective stress responses and higher levels of trust. As a consequence, future studies will need to investigate further various stressors and clarify their effects on social behavior in health and social anxiety disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2898454793,"Background Different studies have found that socioeconomic determinants influence the prevalence of chronic diseases in older people. However, there has been relatively little research on the incidence of how social isolation may affect them. We suggest that social isolation is a serious concern for people living with chronic illnesses. Method In this paper, we examine whether there is an increase in the propensity of being diagnosed with chronic illnesses because of a decrease in social relations for elderly Europeans. We have used a panel data for Waves 1–6 (2004–2015) of Survey on Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) and logistic regressions. Besides, we have studied three geographic macro-areas (Nordic, Continental and Southern). Being diagnosed with three or more chronic diseases is considered as a dependent variable, and as social control variables we have used three isolation proxies (living alone, providing help to family, friends or neighbours and participation-club activities). Other socio-demographic variables are included (gender, age, educational level, job situation, area of location and quality of life). Results Our results for the full sample indicate that people who participate in social activities have fewer probability of suffering from chronic diseases (OR = 0.70, 95% CI 0.54, 0.92). For people who live alone the reverse effect is observed (OR = 1.20, 95% CI 1.04, 1.39). Differences are shown by macro-areas, e.g. providing help (OR = 0.58, 95% CI 0.34, 0.97) isolation proxy is significant for the Nordic macro-area. Club-participation activities and living alone are significant for Continental and Southern macro-areas, respectively (OR = 0.65, 95% CI 0.55, 0.82; OR = 1.46, 95% CI 1.21, 1.77). Conclusions Social isolation increases the risk of being diagnosed with chronic illnesses. That is, people with greater social participation have lower risk of suffering from multiple chronic diseases. This risk linked to isolation, together with the traditional one associated with lifestyles, should be considered in the development of new public policies."
https://openalex.org/W2951206060,"Pearl millet plays a major role in food security in arid and semi-arid areas of Africa and India. However, it lags behind the other cereal crops in terms of genetic improvement. The recent sequencing of its genome opens the way to the use of modern genomic tools for breeding. Our study aimed at identifying genetic components involved in early drought stress tolerance as a first step toward the development of improved pearl millet varieties or hybrids. A panel of 188 inbred lines from West Africa was phenotyped under early drought stress and well-irrigated conditions. We found a strong impact of drought stress on yield components. This impact was variable between inbred lines. We then performed an association analysis with a total of 392,493 SNPs identified using Genotyping-by-Sequencing (GBS). Correcting for genetic relatedness, genome wide association study identified QTLs for biomass production in early drought stress conditions and for stay-green trait. In particular, genes involved in the sirohaem and wax biosynthesis pathways were found to co-locate with two of these QTLs. Our results might contribute to breed pearl millet lines with improved yield under drought stress."
https://openalex.org/W2898218150,"Emerald Basin on the Scotian Shelf off Nova Scotia, Canada, is home to a globally unique aggregation of the glass sponge Vazella pourtalesi, first documented in the region in 1889. In 2009, Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) implemented two Sponge Conservation Areas to protect these sponge grounds from bottom fishing activities. Together, the two conservation areas encompass 259 km2. In order to ascertain the degree to which the sponge grounds remain unprotected, we modelled the presence probability and predicted range distribution of V. pourtalesi on the Scotian Shelf using random forest modelling on presence-absence records. With a high degree of accuracy the random forest model predicted the highest probability of occurrence of V. pourtalesi in the inner basins on the central Scotian Shelf, with lower probabilities at the shelf break and in the Fundian and Northeast Channels. Bottom temperature was the most important determinant of its distribution in the model. Although the two DFO Sponge Conservation Areas protect some of the more significant concentrations of V. pourtalesi, much of its predicted distribution remains unprotected (over 99%). Examination of the hydrographic conditions in Emerald Basin revealed that the V. pourtalesi sponge grounds are associated with a warmer and more saline water mass compared to the surrounding shelf. Reconstruction of historical bottom temperature and salinity in Emerald Basin revealed strong multi-decadal variability, with average bottom temperatures varying by 8°C. We show that this species has persisted in the face of this climatic variability, possibly indicating how it will respond to future climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2898373755,"Gut microbial communities are critical for the health of many insect species. However, little is known about how gut microbial communities respond to anthropogenic changes and how such changes affect host-pathogen interactions. In this study, we used deep sequencing to investigate and compare the composition of gut microbial communities within the midgut and ileum (both bacteria and fungi) in Bombus terrestris queens collected from natural (forest) and urbanized habitats. Additionally, we investigated whether the variation in gut microbial communities under each habitat affected the prevalence of two important bumblebee pathogens that have recently been associated with Bombus declines (Crithidia bombi and Nosema bombi). Microbial community composition differed strongly among habitat types, both for fungi and bacteria. Fungi were almost exclusively associated with bumblebee queens from the forest habitats, and were not commonly detected in bumblebee queens from the urban sites. Further, gut bacterial communities of urban B. terrestris specimens were strongly dominated by bee-specific core bacteria like Snodgrassella (Betaproteobacteria) and Gilliamella (Gammaproteobacteria), whereas specimens from the forest sites contained a huge fraction of environmental bacteria. Pathogen infection was very low in urban populations and infection by Nosema was only observed in specimens collected from forest habitats. No significant relationship was found between pathogen prevalence and microbial gut diversity. However, there was a significant and negative relationship between prevalence of Nosema and relative abundance of the core resident Snodgrassella, supporting its role in pathogen defense. Overall, our results indicate that land-use change may lead to different microbial gut communities in bumblebees, which may have implications for bumblebee health, survival and overall fitness."
https://openalex.org/W2898299022,"Exoskeletons can influence human gait. A healthy gait is characterized by a certain amount of variability compared to a non-healthy gait that has more inherent variability; however which exoskeleton assistance parameters are necessary to avoid increasing gait variability or to potentially lower gait variability below that of unassisted walking are unknown. This study investigated the interaction effects of exoskeleton timing and power on gait variability. Ten healthy participants walked on a treadmill with bilateral ankle-foot exoskeletons under ten conditions with different timing (varied from 36% to 54% of the stride) and power (varied from 0.2 to 0.5 W∙kg-1) combinations. We used the largest Lyapunov exponent (LyE) and maximum Floquet multiplier (FM) to evaluate the stride-to-stride fluctuations of the kinematic time series. We found the lowest LyE at the ankle and a significant reduction versus powered-off with exoskeleton power (summed for both legs) of 0.45 W∙kg-1 and actuation timing at 48% of the stride cycle. At the knee, a significant positive effect of power and a negative interaction effect of power and timing were found for LyE. We found significant positive interaction effects of the square of timing and power for LyE at the knee and hip joints. In contrast, the FM at the ankle increased with increasing power and later timing. We found a significant negative effect of power and a positive interaction effect of power and timing for FM at the knee and no significant effects of any of the exoskeleton parameters for FM at the hip. The ability of the exoskeleton to reduce the LyE at the ankle joint offers new possibilities in terms of altering gait variability, which could have applications for using exoskeletons as rehabilitation devices. Further efforts could examine if it is possible to simultaneously reduce the LyE and FM at one or more lower limb joints."
https://openalex.org/W2950877249,"Rodent models are invaluable to understanding health and disease in many areas of biomedical research. Unfortunately, many models suffer from lack of phenotype reproducibility. Our laboratory has shown that differences in gut microbiota (GM) can modulate phenotypes of models of colon cancer and inflammatory bowel disease. We and others have also shown that a number of factors associated with rodent research, including vendor, cage system, and bedding can alter GM. The objective of this study was to expand these studies to examine the effect of additional bedding materials and methods of water decontamination on GM diversity and composition. To this end, Crl:CD1 (ICR) mice were housed on corn cob or compressed paper chip bedding and provided water that was decontaminated by four different methods: autoclaving with reverse osmosis, autoclaving with hydrochloric acid, autoclaving with sulfuric acid, and autoclaving alone. Feces was collected at day 0, and at day 28 (endpoint), fecal and cecal samples were collected. DNA was extracted from samples, amplified by PCR using conserved bacterial primer sets and subjected to next generation sequencing. Sequence data were analyzed using Qiime and groups were compared using principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA). Two factor PERMANOVA of cecal GM data revealed significant changes when comparing bedding and water decontamination methods, while no significant effects were noted in the fecal GM data. Subsequent PERMANOVA and PCoA of cecal data revealed that several combinations of bedding and water decontamination methods resulted in differing GM, highlighting the complexity by which environmental factors interact to modulate GM."
https://openalex.org/W2898099810,"Background The presence of plaque macrophages and microcalcifications are acknowledged features of plaque vulnerability. Experimental data suggest that microcalcifications promote inflammation and macrophages foster microcalcifications. However, co-localization of plaque macrophages and calcification (ColocCaMa) in coronary segments and its impact on plaque phenotype and lesion vulnerability is unexplored. Methods Plaque morphology including ColocCaMa of calcified coronary target segments in patients with stable coronary artery disease (n = 116) was analyzed using optical coherence tomography (OCT) prior to coronary intervention. Therefore we considered macrophages co-localized with calcification if their distance in an OCT frame was <100μm and OCT-defined microcalcifications with a calcium arc <22.5°. Results ColocCaMa was present in 29/116(25.0%) coronary segments. Calcium burden was greater (calcium volume index:1731±1421°*mm vs. 963±984°*mm, p = 0.002) and calcifications were more superficial (minimal thickness of the fibrous cap overlying the calcification 35±37μm vs. 64±72μm, p = 0.005) in the presence of ColocCaMa. Segments with ColocCaMa demonstrated a higher incidence of newly suggested features of plaque vulnerability, with a 3.5-fold higher number of OCT-defined microcalcifications (0.7±1.0 vs. 0.2±0.6, p = 0.022) and a 6.7-fold higher incidence of plaque inflammation (macrophage volume index:148.7±248.3°*mm vs. 22.2±57.4°*mm, p<0.001). Clinically, intima–media thickness (IMT) in carotid arteries was increased in patients with ColocCaMa (1.02±0.30mm vs. 0.85±0.18, p = 0.021). In a multivariate model, IMT (OR1.76 for 100μm, 95%CI 1.16–2.65, p = 0.007), HDL-cholesterol (OR0.36 for 10mg/dl, 95%CI 0.16–0.84, p = 0.017), calcium volume index (OR1.07 for 100°*mm, 95%CI 1.00–1.14, p = 0.049), macrophage volume index (OR5.77 for 100°*mm, 95%CI 2.04–16.3, p = 0.001) and minimal luminal area (OR3.41, 95%CI 1.49–7.78, p = 0.004) were independent predictors of ColocCaMa. Conclusion Plaque macrophages co-localize with calcifications in coronary target segments and this is associated with high-risk morphological features including microcalcifications and macrophage infiltration as well as with greater calcification burden. Our data may add to the understanding of the relationship between plaque macrophages, vascular calcification and their clinical impact."

Integrated information had a non-random structure as a function of the time lag over which it was computed. For most lags, it increased with age in early life, but even more so in infants exposed to Family Nurture Intervention (FNI), providing further evidence that FNI advances brain maturation in preterm infants. Also, it discriminated between conscious states (awake, REM sleep, NREM sleep), providing empirical support for the Integrated Information Theory of Consciousness in human infants."
https://openalex.org/W2951530971,"Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of age-related dementia. At least 15 mutations in the human gene PRESENILIN 2 (PSEN2) have been found to cause familial Alzheimer's disease (fAD). Zebrafish possess an orthologous gene, psen2, and present opportunities for investigation of PRESENILIN function related to Alzheimer's disease. The most prevalent and best characterized fAD mutation in PSEN2 is N141I. The equivalent codon in zebrafish psen2 is N140. We used genome editing technology in zebrafish to target generation of mutations to the N140 codon. We isolated two mutations: psen2N140fs, (hereafter ""N140fs""), causing truncation of the coding sequence, and psen2T141_L142delinsMISLISV, (hereafter ""T141_L142delinsMISLISV""), that deletes the two codons immediately downstream of N140 and replaces them with seven codons coding for amino acid residues MISLISV. Thus, like almost every fAD mutation in the PRESENILIN genes, this latter mutation does not truncate the gene's open reading frame. Both mutations are homozygous viable although N140fs transcripts are subject to nonsense-mediated decay and lack any possibility of coding for an active γ-secretase enzyme. N140fs homozygous larvae initially show grossly normal melanotic skin pigmentation but subsequently lose this as they grow while retaining pigmentation in the retinal pigmented epithelium. T141_L142delinsMISLISV homozygotes retain faint skin melanotic pigmentation as adults, most likely indicating that the protein encoded by this allele retains weak γ-secretase activity. Null mutations in the human PRESENILIN genes do not cause Alzheimer's disease so these two mutations may be useful for future investigation of the differential effects of null and fAD-like PRESENILIN mutations on brain aging."
https://openalex.org/W2898535519,"Programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) is an inhibitory immune checkpoint receptor that negatively regulates the functioning of T cell. Although the direct targets of PD-1 were not identified, its inhibitory action on the TCR signaling pathway was known much earlier. Recent experiments suggest that the PD-1 inhibits the TCR and CD28 signaling pathways at a very early stage ─ at the level of phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of TCR and CD28 receptors. Here, we develop a mathematical model to investigate the influence of inhibitory effect of PD-1 on the activation of early TCR and CD28 signaling molecules. Proposed model recaptures several quantitative experimental observations of PD-1 mediated inhibition. Model simulations show that PD-1 imposes a net inhibitory effect on the Lck kinase. Further, the inhibitory effect of PD-1 on the activation of TCR signaling molecules such as Zap70 and SLP76 is significantly enhanced by the PD-1 mediated inhibition of Lck. These results suggest a critical role for Lck as a mediator for PD-1 induced inhibition of TCR signaling network. Multi parametric sensitivity analysis explores the effect of parameter uncertainty on model simulations."
https://openalex.org/W2898574707,"Reactions of singing behavior of individual humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) to a specific shipping noise were examined. Two autonomous recorders separated by 3.0 km were used for the acoustic monitoring of each individual song sequence. A passenger-cargo liner was operated once per day, and other large ship noise was excluded given the remote location of the Ogasawara Islands, 1000 km south of Tokyo. In total, locations of between 26 and 27 singers were measured acoustically using time arrival difference at both stereo recorders on the ship presence and absence days, respectively. Source level of the ship (157 dB rms re 1μPa) was measured separately in deep water. Fewer whales sang nearby, within 500 m, of the shipping lane. Humpback whales reduced sound production after the ship passed, when the minimum distance to the whale from the ship trajectory was 1200 m. In the Ogasawara water, humpback whales seemed to stop singing temporarily rather than modifying sound characteristics of their song such as through frequency shifting or source level elevation. This could be a cost effective adaptation because the propagation loss at 500 m from the sound source is as high as 54 dB. The focal ship was 500 m away within several minutes. Responses may differ where ship traffic is heavy, because avoiding an approaching ship may be difficult when many sound sources exist."
https://openalex.org/W2950154625,"The fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) poses a major threat to amphibian populations. To assist efforts to address such threats, we examined differences in Bd host infection prevalence among amphibian species and its relations to both local environmental factors in breeding habitats and landscape variables measured at three scales (500, 2000 and 5000 m radii) around breeding sites in southernmost Sweden. We sampled 947 anurans of six species in 31 ponds and assessed their infection status. We then examined correlations of infection prevalence with canopy cover, pond perimeter and pH (treated as local-scale pond characteristics), and the number of ponds, area of arable land, area of mature forest, number of resident people and presence of sea within the three radii (treated as landscape variables). The Bd infection prevalence was very low, 0.5-1.0%, in two of the six anuran species (Bufo bufo and Rana temporaria), and substantially higher (13-64%) in the other four (Bombina bombina, Bufotes variabilis, Epidalea calamita, Rana arvalis). In the latter four species Bd infection prevalence was positively associated with ponds' pH (site range: 5.3-8.1), and negatively associated with areas of mature forest and/or wetlands in the surroundings. Our results show that the infection dynamics of Bd are complex and associated with host species, local pond characteristics and several landscape variables at larger spatial scales. Knowledge of environmental factors associated with Bd infections and differences in species' susceptibility may help to counter further spread of the disease and guide conservation action plans, especially for the most threatened species."
https://openalex.org/W2898188809,"The bacterial mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) normally functions as an emergency release valve discharging cytoplasmic solutes upon osmotic stress. Opening the large pore of MscL inappropriately is detrimental to the cell, and thus it has been speculated to be a potential antibiotic target. Although MscL is one of the best studied mechanosensitive channels, no chemical that influenced bacterial growth by modulating MscL is known. We therefore used a high-throughput screen to identify compounds that slowed growth in an MscL-dependent manner. We characterized 2 novel sulfonamide compounds identified in the screen. We demonstrated that, although both increase MscL gating, one of these compounds does not work through the folate pathway, as other antimicrobial sulfonamides; indeed, the sulfonamide portion of the compound is not needed for activity. The only mode of action appears to be MscL activation. The binding pocket is where an α-helix runs along the cytoplasmic membrane and interacts with a neighboring subunit; analogous motifs have been observed in several prokaryotic and eukaryotic channels. The data not only demonstrate that MscL is a viable antibiotic target, but also give insight into the gating mechanisms of MscL, and they may have implications for developing agonists for other channels.-Wray, R., Iscla, I., Kovacs, Z., Wang, J., Blount, P.

https://openalex.org/W2898443084,"Background High quality primary care is fundamental to achieving health for all. Research priority setting is a key facilitator of improving how research activity responds to concrete needs. There has never before been an attempt to identify international primary care research priorities, in order to guide resource allocation and to enhance global primary care. This study aimed to identify a list of top 10 primary care research priorities, as identified by members of the public, health professionals working in primary care, researchers, and policymakers. Methods We adapted the James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnership process, to conduct multiple rounds of stakeholder recruitment and prioritization. The study included an online survey conducted in three languages, followed by an in-person priority setting exercise involving primary care stakeholders from 13 countries. Findings Participants identified a list of top 10 international primary care research priorities. These were focused on diverse topics such as enhancing use of information and communication technology, and improving integration of indigenous communities’ knowledge in the design of primary care services. The main limitations of the study related to challenges in engaging an adequate diversity and number of appropriate stakeholders, particularly members of the public, in aggregating the diverse set of responses into coherent categories representative of the participants’ perspectives and in adequately representing the diversity of submitted responses while ensuring research priorities on the final list are sufficiently actionable to guide resource allocation. Conclusions The top 10 identified research priorities have the potential to guide research resource allocation, supporting funding agencies and initiatives to promote global primary care research and practice."
https://openalex.org/W2949674391,"Bacterial blight (BB) disease reduces the yield of rice varieties and hybrids considerably in many tropical rice growing countries like India. The present study highlights the development of durable BB resistance into the background of an elite maintainer of rice, DRR17B, by incorporating two major dominant genes, Xa21 and Xa33 through marker-assisted backcross breeding (MABB). Through two sets of backcrosses, the two BB resistance genes were transferred separately to DRR17B. In this process, at each stage of backcrossing, foreground selection was carried out for the target resistance genes and for non-fertility restorer alleles concerning the major fertility restorer genes Rf3 and Rf4, using gene-specific PCR-based markers, while background selection was done using a set of 61 and 64 parental polymorphic SSR markers respectively. Backcross derived lines possessing either Xa21 or Xa33 along with maximum genome recovery of DRR17B were identified at BC3F1 generation and selfed to develop BC3F2s. Plants harboring Xa21 or Xa33 in homozygous condition were identified among BC3F2s and were intercrossed with each other to combine both the genes. The intercross F1 plants (ICF1) were selfed and the intercross F2(ICF2) plants possessing both Xa21 and Xa33 in homozygous condition were identified with the help of markers. They were then advanced further by selfing until ICF4 generation. Selected ICF4 lines were evaluated for their resistance against BB with eight virulent isolates and for key agro-morphological traits. Six promising two-gene pyramiding lines of DRR17B with high level of BB resistance and agro-morphological attributes similar or superior to DRR17B with complete maintenance ability have been identified. These lines with elevated level of durable resistance may be handy tool for BB resistance breeding."
https://openalex.org/W2898146850,"Biogenic amines modulate a range of social behaviours, including sociability and mechanisms of group cohesion, in both vertebrates and invertebrates. Here, we tested if the biogenic amines modulate honey bee (Apis mellifera) sociability and nestmate affiliation. We examined the consequences of treatments with biogenic amines, agonists and antagonists on a bee's approach to, and subsequent social interactions with, conspecifics in both naturally hive-reared bees and isolated bees. We used two different treatment methods. Bees were first treated topically with compounds dissolved in the solvent dimethylformamide (dMF) applied to the dorsal thorax, but dMF had a significant effect on the locomotion and behaviour of the bees during the behavioural test that interfered with their social responses. Our second method used microinjection to deliver biogenic amines to the head capsule via the ocellar tract. Microinjection of dopamine and a dopamine antagonist had strong effects on bee sociability, likelihood of interaction with bees, and nestmate affiliation. Octopamine treatment reduced social interaction with other bees, and serotonin increased the likelihood of social interactions. HPLC measurements showed that isolation reduced brain levels of biogenic amines compared to hive-reared bees. Our findings suggest that dopamine is an important neurochemical component of social motivation in bees. This finding advances a comparative understanding of the processes of social evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2898089208,"High levels of uranium (U) exist in soil, water, and air in the Southwestern United States due, in part, to waste generated from more than 160,000 abandoned hard rock mines located in this region. As a result, many people living in this region are chronically exposed to U at levels that have been linked to detrimental health outcomes. In an effort to establish a relevant in vivo mouse model for future U immunotoxicity studies, we evaluated the tissue distribution of U in immune organs; blood, bone marrow, spleen, and thymus, as well as femur bones, kidneys, and liver, following a 60-d drinking water exposure to uranyl acetate (UA) in male and female C57BL/6J mice. Following the 60-d exposure, there was low overall tissue retention of U (<0.01%) at both the 5 and the 50 ppm (mg/L) oral concentrations. In both male and female mice, there was limited U accumulation in immune organs. U only accumulated at low concentrations in the blood and bone marrow of male mice (0.6 and 16.8 ng/g, respectively). Consistent with previous reports, the predominant sites of U accumulation were the femur bones (350.1 and 399.0 ng/g, respectively) and kidneys (134.0 and 361.3 ng/g, respectively) of male and female mice. Findings from this study provide critical insights into the distribution and retention of U in lymphoid tissues following chronic drinking water exposure to U. This information will serve as a foundation for immunotoxicological assessments of U, alone and in combination with other metals."
https://openalex.org/W2898526992,"Obesity and insulin resistance are primary risk factors for Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). NAFLD is generally exhibited by non-progressive simple steatosis. However, a significant subset of patient’s progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) that is defined by the presence of steatosis, inflammation and hepatocyte injury with fibrosis. Unfortunately, there are no approved therapies for NAFLD or NASH and therefore therapeutic approaches are urgently needed. Niclosamide is an U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved anthelmintic drug that mediates its effect by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation. Niclosamide and its salt forms, Niclosamide Ethanolamine (NEN), and Niclosamide Piperazine (NPP) have shown efficacy in murine models of diet induced obesity characterized by attenuation of the prominent fatty liver disease phenotype and improved glucose metabolism. While the exact mechanism(s) underlying these changes remains unclear, the ability to uncouple oxidative phosphorylation leading to increased energy expenditure and lipid metabolism or attenuation of PKA mediated glucagon signaling in the liver have been proposed. Unfortunately, niclosamide has very poor water solubility, leading to low oral bioavailability. This, in addition to mitochondrial uncoupling activity and potential genotoxicity have reduced enthusiasm for its clinical use. More recently, salt forms of niclosamide, NEN and NPP, have demonstrated improved oral bioavailability while retaining activity. This suggests that development of safer more effective niclosamide derivatives for the treatment of NAFLD and Type 2 Diabetes may be possible. Herein we explored the ability of a series of N-substituted phenylbenzamide derivatives of the niclosamide salicylanilide chemotype to attenuate hepatic steatosis using a novel phenotypic in vitro model of fatty liver and the high fat diet-fed mouse model of diet induced obesity. These studies identified novel compounds with improved pre-clinical properties that attenuate hepatic steatosis in vitro and in vivo. These compounds with improved drug properties may be useful in alleviating symptoms and protection against disease progression in patients with metabolic syndrome and NAFLD."
https://openalex.org/W2898171889,"Activation of Ras oncogene in human tumors is associated with radiation-associated metastatic potential. Although ionizing radiation is one important method of cancer treatments, it has been shown to enhance matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) activity and facilitates a more aggressive cancer phenotype. Our previous studies showed that andrographolide with lower dose rates of radiation could inhibit RAS-transformed cancer metastasis in vivo; however, the molecular mechanisms are not yet clear. In this study, we aimed to explore the anti-metastatic effect of andrographolide combined with radiation on Ras-transformed cells.RAS-transformed cells were treated with andrographolide in the presence or absence of irradiation (2-4 Gy) or angiotensin II to examine cell invasion. In vivo tumorigenesis assays were also performed. The MMP-2 activity was detected by using Gelatin zymography. Signal transduction of NF-κB subunit, p65 and phosphor-ERK 1/2, were examined by using Western blotting analysis.Treatment with andrographolide inhibited migration of Ras-transformed cells. Andrographolide treatment with radiation significantly inhibited cancer metastasis in vivo. We found that andrographolide exhibited anti-migration and anti-invasive ability against cancer metastasis via inhibition of MMP2 activity rather than affected MMP-9 and EMT. In addition, combined andrographolide with radiation appeared to be more effective in reducing MMP-2 expression, and this effect was accompanied by suppression of ERK activation that inhibits cancer cell migration and invasion.These findings suggest that andrographolide enhances the anti-metastatic effect of radiation in Ras-transformed cells via suppression of ERK-mediated MMP-2 activity."
https://openalex.org/W2898210000,"Background Chronic kidney disease (CKD)-mineral and bone disorder (MBD) is a systemic disorder that leads to vascular calcification and accelerated atherosclerosis. Uric acid has been shown to associate with vascular calcification and with carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and to suppress the 1 α-hydroxylase enzyme leading to lower 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D) and higher intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels. We hypothesized that lowering serum uric acid would reduce CIMT, calcification propensity, and circulating markers of CKD-MBD in CKD. Methods This is a post-hoc analysis of a randomized, double-blind study of 80 patients with stage 3 CKD and hyperuricemia who received allopurinol or placebo for 12 weeks. CIMT and T50 were measured as markers of vascular disease and serum calcification propensity, respectively. The following markers of CKD-MBD were measured: serum calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D metabolites, iPTH, and fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23). Expression of extra-renal 1α-hydroxylase was evaluated in endothelial cells of study participants. Findings Allopurinol successfully lowered serum uric acid levels compared to placebo with an estimate of -3.3 mg/dL (95% C.I. -4.1,-2.5; p < 0.0001). After 12 weeks, however, we found no significant change in CIMT or serum T50. There was not a significant change in vitamin D metabolites, iPTH, FGF-23, or the expression of endothelial 1α-hydroxylase. Conclusion These data suggest that factors other than uric acid may play a more important role in the regulation of CKD- MBD including vascular calcification and vitamin D metabolism in patients with CKD."
https://openalex.org/W2898353956,"Background Infection with Human Immunodeficiency Virus is a serious public health problem that threatens the lives of many people including health care workers. Health care workers are frequently exposed to occupational hazards throughout their careers. Health care workers are at risk of being infected by the virus when caring for patients in health care facilities. Utilization of HIV Post-exposure Prophylaxis (HIV PEP) is very vital once an individual is exposed. Aim The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of occupational exposure, knowledge of, availability and utilization of post exposure prophylaxis among health care workers in Singida District Council, Tanzania. Methods A descriptive cross sectional study was conducted from April to May 2013. Health care workers actively treating patients were enrolled from 18 heath facilities in Singida District Council. Data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire, and analysed using Stata version 12. Results Out of 239 participants, slightly more than half, 124 (52%) had inadequate overall knowledge of HIV PEP. Of the 239, 121(50.6%) participants experienced occupational exposure. Two leading types of exposure were blood splash 57(47.1%) and needle stick injuries 45 (37.2%),respectively. Among the 121 exposed participants, 83(68.6%) reported the exposure incident, 91(75.2%) had an HIV test, 32 (26.4%), started HIV PEP after testing, 28 (23.1%), completed HIV PEP, and 65 (53.7%) had a follow-up HIV test. About two thirds (159/239), of participants reported that HIV PEP services were available at the time the study was conducted, and 49 (20.5%), reported daily access to HIV PEP service. Conclusion The prevalence of occupational exposure among health care workers is high with low utilization of HIV PEP. The majority of healthcare workers had inadequate knowledge of HIV PEP. The findings highlight the need to improve the level of knowledge of HIV PEP and utilization of PEP among this at-high-risk-group in Singida."
https://openalex.org/W2898593450,"Single-fiber laser treatment of the prostate has been widely accepted in the clinic due to its minimal invasiveness and high controllability. However, for large tumors, multiple insertions of the laser probe would be needed to achieve full coverage of the tumor, increasing the complexity of the treatment and occasionally resulting in the incomplete killing of tumor cells due to a mismatch between the planned insertion location and the actual probe insertion location. Treatment with a dual-fiber laser results in greater lesion coverage following a single insertion of the probe, with the lesion coverage being even greater than the sum of the coverage of two sequential insertion of a single-fiber laser probe, potentially reducing treatment time and clinical complications. Both theoretical and experimental analyses have been performed to evaluate the proposed dual-fiber laser treatment. A finite element model was established to simulate the treatment process. The simulation results indicated that there is a clear difference between the ablation coverage created using dual-fiber laser ablation and that created using the superposition of sequential single-fiber laser ablation. In addition, the coverage is dependent on the spacing distance between the two fibers. Both ex vivo and in vivo canine prostate tissues were treated by dual-fiber laser ablation, with lesions analyzed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound imaging, and pathology. The results demonstrate that dual-fiber laser ablation can markedly increase the range of the ablation zone when compared with single-fiber modes. The safety and feasibility of dual-fiber laser treatment has been confirmed, and a treatment plan using dual-fiber laser ablation has also been proposed."
https://openalex.org/W2898274998,"The spatial response of epiphytic diatom communities to environmental stress was studied in a moderately saline wetland area located in the plain of Danube-Tisza Interfluve, Hungary. The area is characterised by World War II bomb crater ponds and can be regarded as an excellent ecological model system where the dispersion of species is slightly limited by distance. To study the effect of environmental variables on the communities, canonical correspondence analysis was applied. Salinity, pH, total suspended solids, total phosphorous and depth proved to be significant environmental drivers in this analysis. The ecological status of the ponds was assessed with Ziemann's halobity index, as the trophity-depending metric cannot be applied to these habitats (due to the naturally high phosphorus content). Ponds in ""good"" ecological status significantly differed from those appertaining to water quality category of ""not-good"" ecological status considering characteristic of natural astatic soda pans (e.g. salinity, pH, ammonium, total phosphorous concentration, nitrogen:phosphorous ratio and turbidity). The differences between epiphytic diatom communities inhabiting the ponds were detected using non-parametric multidimensional scaling. The samples formed three groups according to the types of ponds (""transparent"", ""transitional"" and ""turbid"") based on the width of the macrophyte belt around them. Indicator species related to the ecological status of the ponds and diatom communities contributing to the separation of groups of ponds were identified. One of the indicator species differed from species already described. Light and scanning electron microscopy features and phylogenetic analyses based on three genes (18S and 28S rRNA genes, rbcL) proved that it was a new species of Nitzschia genus, closely related to Nitzschia frustulum and Nitzschia inconspicua. Therefore, description of a new species, Nitzschia reskoi Ács, Duleba, C.E.Wetzel & Ector is proposed. We concluded that the increasing abundance of Nitzschia reskoi was a signal of the degradation of the intermittent saline wetlands."
https://openalex.org/W2898367930,"Attributes such as sex, age and pigmentation of individuals could correspond to the competitive skills they use to access resources and, consequently, determine their social status when a hierarchy of dominance is established. We analysed patterns of social dominance in relation to sex, age and, for the first time, according to face pigmentation in a large scavenger bird species, the Andean condor (Vultur gryphus). This species displays extreme sexual dimorphism, with males being up to 50% heavier than females. Associated to this, strong hierarchical relationships characterize foraging, roosting and breeding. We recorded agonistic interactions within condor groups while foraging through video recordings in experimental stations. We corroborated a strong despotism by the adult males to the rest of the categories. More interestingly we found this despotism was also expressed by most pigmented birds; juvenile females being completely subordinated and, at the same time, not expressing pigmentation. Importantly, when condors of equal sex and age category fought, the more pigmented individuals were successful. Our results highlight that pigmentation, besides sex and age, is an attribute that also corresponds with social status in the Andean condor, making its hierarchical system more complex."
https://openalex.org/W2949084348,"We utilized the event-related potential (ERP) technique to study neural activity associated with different levels of working memory (WM) load during simultaneous interpretation (SI) of continuous prose. The amplitude of N1 and P1 components elicited by task-irrelevant tone probes was significantly modulated as a function of WM load but not the direction of interpretation. Furthermore, the latency of the P1 increased significantly with WM load. The WM load effect on N1 latency, however, did not reach significance. Larger negativity under lower WM loads suggests that more attention is available to process the source message, providing the first electrophysiological evidence in support of the Efforts Model of SI. Relationships between the direction of interpretation and median WM load are also discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2896852412,"Human infants frequently acquire human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) through breastfeeding, resulting in persistent high-level viral shedding in saliva and urine and infectivity to others, including pregnant women. Thus, vaccination to interrupt postnatal HCMV transmission is an attractive strategy to prevent HCMV spread and congenital infection. Rhesus CMV (RhCMV) in nonhuman primates is a valuable model for the study of immune strategies to prevent CMV transmission. Although rhesus monkeys typically acquire RhCMV before 1 year of age, the timing and mode of natural infant RhCMV transmission remain unknown.We followed 5 RhCMV-seropositive dams and their infants from birth until weaning, approximately 6 months later. RhCMV DNA levels in plasma, breast milk, saliva, and urine were measured every 2 weeks by quantitative PCR. RhCMV-specific T cell responses in peripheral blood and breast milk were measured by interferon gamma ELISpot assays. Serum IgG antibody levels were measured by ELISA.Four of five postpartum RhCMV-seropositive mothers had intermittent, low-level RhCMV shedding in breast milk, whereas all had high-magnitude RhCMV shedding in saliva and urine. The kinetics of maternal blood RhCMV-specific T cell responses and viral shedding in urine and saliva did not strongly associate, though dams with consistently high systemic RhCMV-specific T cell responses tended to have undetectable RhCMV shedding in breast milk. All RhCMV-exposed infants had intermittent, low-level RhCMV shedding in saliva during the lactation period, with minimal systemic RhCMV-specific T cell responses.Despite exposure to RhCMV shedding in breast milk and other maternal fluids, postnatal mother-to-child RhCMV transmission appears to be less efficient than that of HCMV. A greater understanding of the determinants of RhCMV transmission and its usefulness as a model of HCMV mucosal acquisition may provide insight into strategies to prevent HCMV infections in humans."

Despite abundant sunlight, vitamin D deficiency is reported in many tropical countries. As vitamin D is a key modulator for intestinal calcium absorption, low vitamin D could contribute to low serum calcium leading to abnormalities of skeletal homeostasis. Therefore, present study was aimed to study the association of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), serum calcium and VDR polymorphisms in a selected Sri Lankan population.A case control study was conducted in 119 participants (cases = 51: controls = 68). Serum 25(OH)D levels were measured using ELISA. The VDR polymorphisms (Fok I and Taq I) were detected by polymerase chain reaction followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism.Findings indicated a significantly low (p = 0.000) 25(OH)D levels in cases (18.7±3.7 ng/mL) compared to controls(25.5±9.8 ng/mL) while 25(OH)D in both groups were below the reference range. Mean serum calcium levels in both groups were within normal reference range and was not significantly different among groups. Statistically significant association was not observed between VDR Fok I polymorphisms among cases and controls. Although Fok I polymorphism genotypes were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), Taq I genotypes in controls violated HWE.Present study confirms that insufficient serum 25(OH)D levels in cases have major contribution to LDH. VDR Fok I polymorphisms did not have any significant association with LDH in Sri Lankan ethnicity."
https://openalex.org/W2736716408,"We present insights and empirical results from an extensive numerical study of the evolutionary dynamics of the iterated prisoner’s dilemma. Fixation probabilities for Moran processes are obtained for all pairs of 164 different strategies including classics such as TitForTat, zero determinant strategies, and many more sophisticated strategies. Players with long memories and sophisticated behaviours outperform many strategies that perform well in a two player setting. Moreover we introduce several strategies trained with evolutionary algorithms to excel at the Moran process. These strategies are excellent invaders and resistors of invasion and in some cases naturally evolve handshaking mechanisms to resist invasion. The best invaders were those trained to maximize total payoff while the best resistors invoke handshake mechanisms. This suggests that while maximizing individual payoff can lead to the evolution of cooperation through invasion, the relatively weak invasion resistance of payoff maximizing strategies are not as evolutionarily stable as strategies employing handshake mechanisms."

Fecal volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have been found to differ in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome. Murine models of colitis offer an alternative to human studies in which diet can be controlled. We aimed to investigate fecal VOCs from mice in which acute and chronic colitis was induced. Groups of adult C57BL/6 mice underwent treatment with oral dextran sulfate sodium to induce colitis. Control mice received no treatment or had acute osmotic diarrhea induced with magnesium sulfate. Colitis was assessed clinically and by histology. Samples of feces and/or colon contents were collected and volatile compounds determined by solid phase microextraction–GC-MS. Statistics were performed using metabolomics tools. Acute colitis was associated with an increase in aldehydes and chronic colitis with one specific ketone. Osmotic diarrhea was associated with a significant reduction in VOCs, especially alcohols. We provide evidence that the identification of disease-associated VOC concentration ranges, combined with specific marker compounds, would potentially increase the likelihood of finding an inflammatory bowel disease–specific fecal VOC marker profile.—Reade, S., Williams, J.

https://openalex.org/W2898190729,"An animal's home-range can be expected to encompass the resources it requires for surviving or reproducing. Thus, animals inhabiting a heterogeneous landscape, where resource patches vary in size, shape and distribution, will naturally have home-ranges of varied sizes, so that each home-range encompasses a minimum required amount of a resource. Home-range size can be estimated from telemetry data, and often key resources, or proxies for them such as the areas of important habitat types, can be mapped. We propose a new method, Resource-Area-Dependence Analysis (RADA), which uses a sample of tracked animals and a categorical map to i) infer in which map categories important resources are accessible, ii) within which home range cores they are found, and iii) estimate the mean minimum areas of these map categories required for such resource provision. We provide three examples of applying RADA to datasets of radio-tracked animals from southern England: 15 red squirrels Sciurus vulgaris, 17 gray squirrels S. carolinensis and 114 common buzzards Buteo buteo. The analyses showed that each red squirrel required a mean (95% CL) of 0.48 ha (0.24--0.97) of pine wood within the outermost home-range, each gray squirrel needed 0.34 ha (0.11-1.12) ha of mature deciduous woodland and 0.035-0.046 ha of wheat, also within the outermost home-range, while each buzzard required 0.54 ha (0.35-0.82) of rough ground close to the home-range center and 14 ha (11-17) of meadow within an intermediate core, with 52% of them also relying on 0.41 ha (0.29-0.59) of suburban land near the home-range center. RADA thus provides a useful tool to infer key animal resource requirements during studies of animal movement and habitat use."
https://openalex.org/W2898139411,"Although anthrax is endemic in Lesotho, limited information is available on the patterns of the disease among livestock animals. This study investigated temporal patterns of anthrax outbreaks and cases among livestock animals in Lesotho.Secondary data of anthrax outbreaks reported to the Department of Livestock Services between January 2005 and December 2016 was used for this study. Proportions of anthrax outbreaks and cases, and their corresponding 95% confidence interval were calculated and compared across year, season, month and region using the Chi-square or Fisher's exact test. The autoregression model was used to evaluate annual trends of anthrax outbreaks and cases.A total of 38 outbreaks were reported in the Lowlands districts of Lesotho. District was significantly (p<0.0001) associated with outbreaks and cases, with the highest proportions of outbreaks (52.6%) and cases (70.2%) reported in Maseru. Significantly (p = 0.0004) higher proportions of anthrax outbreaks (78.9%) and cases (95.1%) were reported in the rainy-hot season compared to the dry-cold season. Five hundred and twenty-six (n = 526) anthrax cases were reported with significantly (p<0.0001) higher proportion of cases (70.3%) in cattle compared to other species. Higher proportion of anthrax cases (35.9%) were reported in 2008 and during the months of February (30.8%) and April (30.2%). There was no significant annual trend in anthrax outbreaks (r = 0.0282; p = 0.6213) and cases (r = 0.0873; p = 0.3512) over the study period.The burden of anthrax in Lesotho is significantly higher in cattle. Anthrax outbreaks occur only in the lowland districts and follow a seasonal pattern. Therefore, more effort should be targeted at curbing the disease in cattle and the lowlands districts. Furthermore, there should be heightened monitoring of cases in the rainy season to ensure that resultant carcasses are disposed of appropriately to minimise future outbreaks."
https://openalex.org/W2898555203,"Formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1) has been shown to be a key regulator of inflammation. However, its role in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) has not been delineated yet. We investigated whether FPR1 plays a pivotal role in regulating lung inflammation and injuries, and whether intratracheally transplanted mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) attenuate hyperoxic lung inflammation and injuries by down-regulating FPR1. Newborn wild type (WT) or FPR1 knockout (FPR1-/-) C57/BL6 mice were randomly exposed to 80% oxygen or room air for 14 days. At postnatal day (P) 5, 2×10(5) MSCs were intratracheally transplanted. At P14, mice were sacrificed for histopathological and morphometric analyses. Hyperoxia significantly increased lung neutrophils, macrophages, and TUNEL-positive cells, while impairing alveolarization and angiogenesis, along with a significant increase in FPR1 mRNA levels in WT mice. The hyperoxia-induced lung inflammation and lung injuries were significantly attenuated, with the reduced mRNA level of FPR1, in WT mice with MSC transplantation and in FPR1-/- mice, irrespective of MSCs transplantation. However, only MSC transplantation, but not the FPR1 knockout, significantly attenuated the hyperoxia-induced increase in TUNEL-positive cells. Our findings indicate that FPR1 play a critical role in regulating lung inflammation and injuries in BPD, and MSCs attenuate hyperoxic lung inflammation and injuries, but not apoptosis, with down regulating, but not direct inhibiting FPR1."
https://openalex.org/W2898562202,"Fatigue is a common and highly disabling symptom of multiple sclerosis. Patients experience an effort-independent general subjective feeling of fatigue as well as excessive fatigability when engaging in physical or mental activity. Previous research using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has revealed heterogeneous findings, but some evidence implicates the motor system. To identify brain correlates of fatigue, 44 mildly impaired patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and 25 age- and gender-matched healthy controls underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging at 3 Tesla, while they performed alternating blocks of rest and a non-fatiguing precision grip task. We investigated neural correlates of fatigue using the motor subscore of Fatigue Scale for Motor and Cognitive Functions (FSMCMOTOR) using the bilateral motor cerebellum, putamen, and dorsal premotor cortex as regions of interest. Patients and healthy controls performed the grip force task equally well without being fatigued. In patients, task-related activity in lobule VI of right motor cerebellum changed in proportion with individual FSMCMOTOR scores. In right dorsal premotor cortex, linear increases in activity across consecutive task blocks scaled with individual FSMCMOTOR scores in healthy controls, but not in patients. In premotor and dorsomedial prefrontal areas, patients were impaired at upscaling task-related activity the more they were affected by motor fatigue. The results support the notion that increased sensorimotor processing in the cerebellum contributes to the experience of motor fatigue and fatigability in multiple sclerosis. Additionally, downscaling of motivational input or sensorimotor processing in prefrontal and premotor areas may constitute an additional pathophysiological factor."
https://openalex.org/W2898120365,"With the deepening of the research on supply chain management, scholars have increasingly begun to investigate the impact of fairness on a supply chain, and many conclusions suggest that a simple wholesale price can coordinate a supply chain under specific conditions. However, the corresponding analysis and other optimization mechanisms that affect the situation in which the channel cannot be coordinated are either omitted or given little attention. In this paper, we constructed a dyadic supply chain with a single manufacturer and a single retailer; the manufacturer acts as a selfish leader, and the retailer acts as a follower with fairness concerns and sales efforts. For this setting, we derived the equilibrium strategy solution for a wholesale price contract and cost sharing of effort (CS-E) contract offered by the manufacturer, and the results indicated that both contracts achieved channel coordination with different requirements. Further, the profit of the manufacturer and the sales effort of the retailer under CS-E contracts were never less than those for the wholesale price contract, and there was an interval during which the retailer's profit and utility and supply chain efficiency were better than those under the wholesale price contract. In addition, we described situations in which a CS-E contract is unnecessary. These results should be a useful reference for managerial decisions and organizations."
https://openalex.org/W2898426576,"Although clinical guidelines exist, the management of patients with cutaneous melanoma (CM) is a complex process that may vary between different care providers with potential dysfunctions ultimately mirrored in the overall patient satisfaction. The aim of the present study was to investigate the CM management as related to lead times, surgical quality and diagnosis communication with the hypothesis that the care may differ between providers and disparities may impact patient satisfaction. Medical records of 181 patients were retrospectively analyzed with parallel patient satisfaction evaluation by telephone interviews. Overall mean lead times from initial diagnosis until completion of all surgery and histopathology reports were 80–100 days and delays occurred at every step of the process. General practitioners performed excision biopsies faster however this was mitigated by slower histopathology processing. University level CM care showed less lag time between excision biopsy, wide local excision for thick melanomas and histopathology confirmation. University level care operated with twice the surgical margin as compared to general practitioners and non-university level specialists. Male patients had larger excision biopsy margins and significantly shorter lead times than female patients. Patient satisfaction rates were generally higher in the academic hospitals as compared to general practitioners and non-university dermatology clinics. Surprisingly, there was no correlation between lead times and patient satisfaction. Taken together, CM show substantial variation and caution should be practiced when using patient satisfaction as a quality indicator."
https://openalex.org/W2898218381,"Digital learning is becoming the most commonly used portal for workplace learning, but its effectiveness is not clearly understood. We studied 99 employees on-site in a large company as they watched an already used and required training video. Employees were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: (1) a baseline condition of watching the video as in current practice; (2) a spontaneous discussion condition in which participants discussed the video with colleagues immediately after the video without any guidelines; (3) a structured discussion condition in which participants discussed the video with colleagues immediately after the video with an instructor guiding discussion topics; and (4) a testing condition in which test questions were interpolated throughout the video. Memory for the content of the video was measured on a recognition memory test completed 20-35 hours after watching the video. Employees who were in the interpolated-testing or structured discussion conditions had significantly superior memory for the video content (26% and 25% better respectively) relative to typical video viewing; spontaneous discussion did not enhance memory for content. These findings demonstrate that interpolated testing and structured discussion enhance information retention in the workplace and point to how learning science may accelerate workplace learning more generally."

The source of infection in many of these patients remains unclear. To address this clinical problem, the microbiome profile and host inflammatory response in bronchoalveolar lavage samples from the surgical intensive care unit were examined relative to clinical pathology diagnoses. The hypothesis was tested that clinical diagnosis of respiratory tract flora were similar to culture positive lavage samples in both microbiome and inflammatory profile. Bronchoalveolar lavage samples were collected in the surgical intensive care unit as standard of care for intubated individuals with a clinical pulmonary infection score of >6 or who were expected to be intubated for >48 hours. Cytokine analysis was conducted with the Bioplex Pro Human Th17 cytokine panel. The microbiome of the samples was sequenced for the 16S rRNA region using the Ion Torrent. Microbiome diversity analysis showed the culture-positive samples had the lowest levels of diversity and culture negative with the highest based upon the Shannon-Wiener index (culture positive: 0.77 ± 0.36, respiratory tract flora: 2.06 ± 0.73, culture negative: 3.97 ± 0.65). Culture-negative samples were not dominated by a single bacterial genera. Lavages classified as respiratory tract flora were more similar to the culture-positive in the microbiome profile. A comparison of cytokine expression between groups showed increased levels of cytokines (IFN-g, IL-17F, IL-1B, IL-31, TNF-a) in culture-positive and respiratory tract flora groups. Culture-positive samples exhibited a more robust immune response and reduced diversity of bacterial genera. Lower cytokine levels in culture-negative samples, despite a greater number of bacterial species, suggest a resident nonpathogenic bacterial community may be indicative of a normal pulmonary environment. Respiratory tract flora samples were most similar to the culture-positive samples and may warrant classification as culture-positive when considering clinical treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2898471069,"Learning to decipher acoustically distorted speech serves as a test case for the study of language-related skill acquisition in persons with developmental dyslexia (DD). Deciphering this type of input is rarely learned explicitly and does not yield conscious insights. Problems in implicit and procedural skill learning have been proposed as possible causes of DD. Here we examined the learning of time-compressed (accelerated) speech and its generalization to novel materials among young adults with DD compared to typical readers (TD). All participants completed a training session that involved judging the semantic plausibility of sentences, during which the level of time-compression was changed using an adaptive (staircase) procedure according to each participant's performance. In the test, phase learning (test on same items) and generalization (test on new items and same items spoken by a new speaker) were assessed. Both groups showed robust gains after training. Moreover, after training, the initial disadvantage of the DD group was no longer significant. After training, both groups experienced relative difficulties in deciphering learned tokens spoken by a different voice, though participants with DD were less able to generalize the gains to deciphering new tokens. Thus, DD individuals benefited from repeated experience with time-compressed speech no less than typical readers, but their evolving skill was apparently more dependent on the specific characteristics of the tokens. Atypical generalization, which indicates that perceptual learning is contingent on lower-level features of the input though does not necessarily point to impaired learning potential per se, may explain some of the contradictory findings in published studies of speech perception in DD."
https://openalex.org/W2898386959,"The intrinsic factors (IF) influencing visual attention performance (VAP) might cause potential human errors, such as ""error/mistake"", ""forgetting"" and ""omission"". It is a key issue to develop a systematic assessment of IF in order to distinguish the levels of VAP. Motivated by the Stimulus-Response (S-R) model, we take an interactive cancellation test-Neuron Type Test (NTT)-to explore the IF and present the corresponding systematic assessment. The main contributions of this work include three elements: a) modeling the IF on account of attention span, attention stability, distribution-shift of attention with measurable parameters by combining the psychological and statistical concepts; b) proposing quantitative analysis methods for assessing the IF via its computational representation-intrinsic qualities (IQ)-in the sense of computational model; and c) clustering the IQ of air traffic control (ATC) students in the feature space of interest. The response sequences of participants collected with the NTT system are characterized by three parameters: Hurst exponent, normalized number of decisions (NNoD) and error rate of decisions (ERD). The K-means clustering is applied to partition the feature space constructed from practical data of VAP. For the distinguishable clusters, the statistical inference is utilized to refine the assessment of IF. Our comprehensive analysis shows that the IQ can be classified into four levels, i.e., excellent, good, moderate and unqualified, which has a potential application in selecting air traffic controllers subject to reducing the risk of the inadequacy of attention performances in aviation safety management."
https://openalex.org/W2898563254,"Due to difficulties in accurately predicting the emergency timing and the magnitude of a disaster, operations for perishable emergency inventory planning often encounter expiration and shortage problems. In order to ease the expiration problem in emergency medicine preparation inventories, this paper investigates an emergency medicine closed-loop supply chain for returning unused items from an ERC (Emergency Reserve Center) to a hospital. To assure that the return strategy is meaningful, we propose a critical parameter that we term the latest return time, after which the remaining emergency medicine in the ERC cannot be returned to the hospital. In addition, the short lifetime of emergency products and uncertainty about demand time and demand quantity are also considered in this emergency inventory planning system. In analyzing the optimal ordering policies, we find that the two threshold values for the predefined return time, which affect the total costs, are not monotonous; rather, the direction of their effect is first down, then up, and then down again, which means that a better predefined value of the latest return time can be determined by minimizing total costs. By studying and comparing decentralized and centralized decisions, we find that the centralized decision system works better to control expiration and costs. Therefore, we design a coordination mechanism for the cooperation between the ERC and the hospital. Our analysis shows that we should not ignore the emergency uncertainty and perishability of emergency items."
