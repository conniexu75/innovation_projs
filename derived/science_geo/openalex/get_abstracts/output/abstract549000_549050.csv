https://openalex.org/W2220870060,"An electronic–photonic microprocessor chip manufactured using a conventional microelectronics foundry process is demonstrated; the chip contains 70 million transistors and 850 photonic components and directly uses light to communicate to other chips. The rapid transfer of data between chips in computer systems and data centres has become one of the bottlenecks in modern information processing. One way of increasing speeds is to use optical connections rather than electrical wires and the past decade has seen significant efforts to develop silicon-based nanophotonic approaches to integrate such links within silicon chips, but incompatibility between the manufacturing processes used in electronics and photonics has proved a hindrance. Now Chen Sun et al. describe a 'system on a chip' microprocessor that successfully integrates electronics and photonics yet is produced using standard microelectronic chip fabrication techniques. The resulting microprocessor combines 70 million transistors and 850 photonic components and can communicate optically with the outside world. This result promises a way forward for new fast, low-power computing systems architectures. Data transport across short electrical wires is limited by both bandwidth and power density, which creates a performance bottleneck for semiconductor microchips in modern computer systems—from mobile phones to large-scale data centres. These limitations can be overcome1,2,3 by using optical communications based on chip-scale electronic–photonic systems4,5,6,7 enabled by silicon-based nanophotonic devices8. However, combining electronics and photonics on the same chip has proved challenging, owing to microchip manufacturing conflicts between electronics and photonics. Consequently, current electronic–photonic chips9,10,11 are limited to niche manufacturing processes and include only a few optical devices alongside simple circuits. Here we report an electronic–photonic system on a single chip integrating over 70 million transistors and 850 photonic components that work together to provide logic, memory, and interconnect functions. This system is a realization of a microprocessor that uses on-chip photonic devices to directly communicate with other chips using light. To integrate electronics and photonics at the scale of a microprocessor chip, we adopt a ‘zero-change’ approach to the integration of photonics. Instead of developing a custom process to enable the fabrication of photonics12, which would complicate or eliminate the possibility of integration with state-of-the-art transistors at large scale and at high yield, we design optical devices using a standard microelectronics foundry process that is used for modern microprocessors13,14,15,16. This demonstration could represent the beginning of an era of chip-scale electronic–photonic systems with the potential to transform computing system architectures, enabling more powerful computers, from network infrastructure to data centres and supercomputers."

These TETs convert 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) in DNA, and high 5-hmC levels are associated with active transcription. The importance of the balance in these modified cytosines is emphasized by the fact that TET2 is mutated in several human cancers, including myeloid malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We characterize here the kinetic and inhibitory properties of Tets and show that the Km value of Tets 1 and 2 for O2 is 30 μm, indicating that they retain high activity even under hypoxic conditions. The AML-associated mutations in the Fe2+ and 2-oxoglutarate-binding residues increased the Km values for these factors 30–80-fold and reduced the Vmax values. Fumarate and succinate, which can accumulate to millimolar levels in succinate dehydrogenase and fumarate hydratase-mutant tumors, were identified as potent Tet inhibitors in vitro, with IC50 values ∼400–500 μm. Fumarate and succinate also down-regulated global 5-hmC levels in neuroblastoma cells and the expression levels of some hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) target genes via TET inhibition, despite simultaneous HIFα stabilization. The combination of fumarate or succinate treatment with TET1 or TET3 silencing caused differential effects on the expression of specific HIF target genes. Altogether these data show that hypoxia-inducible genes are regulated in a multilayered manner that includes epigenetic regulation via TETs and 5-hmC levels in addition to HIF stabilization.

These enzymes all share the same basic reaction mechanism, in which the substrate is hydroxylated by molecular oxygen in the presence of a divalent metal cofactor (most commonly Fe2+) and the 2-oxoglutarate cosubstrate is decarboxylated to succinate and CO2 (1McDonough M.A. Loenarz C.

The substrates for 2-OGDDs vary from proteins to DNA, RNA, and fatty acids (1McDonough M.A. Loenarz C. Chowdhury R. Clifton I.J. Schofield C.J.

Interestingly, a large number of 2-OGDDs act on the chromatin structure, most notably the ten-eleven-translocation 5-methylcytosine dioxygenases (TETs) and the Jumonji domain-containing histone demethylases (1McDonough M.A. Loenarz C.

The stability of the α subunit of the key regulator of the hypoxia response, the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), is also regulated by 2-OGDDs, namely the HIF-prolyl 4-hydroxylases (HIF-P4Hs), also known as PHDs and EglNs (1McDonough M.A. Loenarz C.

The TET enzymes convert the 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) in DNA sequentially to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC), 5-formylcytocine, and 5-carboxylcytocine, leading to DNA demethylation (3Vasanthakumar A.

The cells for the normoxic experiments were incubated under 21% O2 and 5% CO2, and the hypoxic experiments were conducted under 1% O2 and 5% CO2 in a Sci-tive hypoxia work station (Ruskinn). The cells for the diethyl fumarate (DEF) (Sigma) and dimethyl succinate (DMS) (Sigma) treatments were seeded 5–6 h prior to the initiation of the treatment at 35–45% confluence and treated with increasing concentrations of DEF or DMS (Sigma). The compounds were diluted in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The normoxic control cells and hypoxic cells were treated with an equivalent volume of DMSO. For the 48-h treatments, equal volumes and concentrations of the compounds were added every 24 h. Nuclear and cytosolic fractions were extracted from the cells using NEPER® Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagent Kit (Thermo Scientific). To extract organic acids, the supernatant containing the cytosolic fraction was subjected to an equal volume of ice-cold 8% perchloric acid and centrifuged. Similarly, the pellets containing the nuclear fractions were lysed in ice-cold 8% perchloric acid and centrifuged. The supernatants were neutralized by K2CO3 and analyzed using an UPLC-MS/MS method modified from a previous report (27Birkler R.I. Støttrup N.B. Hermannson S. Nielsen T.T. Gregersen N. Bøtker H.E.

The chromatographic separation was performed at 30 °C using an ACQUITY HSS C18 column (100 × 2.1 mm, Waters Corp.) equipped with a ACQUITY UPLC pre-column filter. The eluents were A: 0.2% formic acid (Optima LC/MS, Fischer Scientific) in ultrapure H2O (v/v) and B: 0.2% formic acid in LC/MS-grade methanol (LiChrosolv GG). The chromatographic system used was Waters ACQUITYTM UPLC system (Waters Corp.). Detection of succinate was carried out using a Waters XevoTM TQ-S triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer (Waters Corp.) with a Z-spray electrospray ionization source. The MS/MS reaction used for quantitation of succinate was m/z 117 > 73 and an additional MS/MS-reaction m/z 117 > 99 using 10 eV collision energy for both multiple reaction monitoring reactions. Total cell extracts were obtained by lysing the cells in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. The extracts were analyzed in SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions followed by Western blotting with polyclonal rabbit antibodies against human HIF-1α (Novus, NB100-479), HIF-2α (Novus, NB100-122), and IDH1 (Cell Signaling, number 3997), followed by ECL immunodetection. Western blotting for β-actin (Novus, NB600-501) was used as a loading control. Genomic DNA was extracted from the cells by lysing the cells with a buffer containing 0.1 m Tris (pH 8.5), 5 mm EDTA, 0.2% SDS, 0.2 m NaCl, and 0.1 mg/ml of Proteinase K and subjecting the lysates for phenol-chloroform extraction. Genomic DNA was hydrolyzed enzymatically to nucleosides and run on a Zorbax XDB-C18 2.1 × 50-mm column (1.8-mm particle size) attached to an Agilent 1200 Series liquid chromatography machine coupled to an Agilent 6410 Triple Quad Mass Spectrometer (13Mariani C.J.

Total RNA was isolated from the cells and purified using an EZNA total RNA kit (OMEGA Bio-Tek). Reverse transcription was performed with an iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) and qPCR was performed in a CFX96 Real-time System (Bio-Rad). TATA-binding protein (TBP) was used as a housekeeping gene. The sequences of the primers are presented in Table 1. SK-N-BE(2) neuroblastoma cells were transfected with TET1-targeting siRNA (Dharmacon ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool L-014635-03), TET3-targeting siRNA (Dharmacon ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool L-022722-02), or non-targeting control siRNA (Dharmacon ON-TARGETplus Non-targeting pool L001810) using Mirus TransIT-siQUEST transfection reagent (MIR 2114), according to the manufacturer's protocol 72 h before the initiation of treatment with DMSO, DEF, or DMS. The cells were passaged 48 h prior to the start of the treatment, and re-transfected with the siRNAs 16–18 h prior to the treatment. Student's two-tailed t test was used for comparisons between two groups.

The catalytic domains of the murine Tets 1–3 were expressed in insect cells as FLAG-tagged proteins and affinity-purified using anti-FLAG affinity chromatography (Fig. 1, A–C). The elution fractions were run on SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Tets 1 and 2 gave a higher yield on purification than did Tet3 (Fig. 1, A–C). The catalytic activities of Tets 1–3 were assessed by a method based on measurement of the hydroxylation-coupled stoichiometric release of 14CO2 from 2-oxo-[1-14C]glutarate using a double-stranded DNA fragment containing 5-mC as a substrate. Tets 1 and 2 showed significant activity under these conditions, whereas the yield and activity of Tet3 was low (Fig. 1, A–C). We therefore concentrated the kinetic analyses on Tets 1 and 2. The Km values of Tets 1 and 2 for the DNA substrate were 75 and 125 nm, respectively (Table 2). The Km values for iron for Tets 1 and 2 were 4.8 and 3.6 μm, respectively, being markedly higher than those for HIF-P4H-2, but in the range of those for the collagen prolyl 4-hydroxylase I (Table 2). The Km values of Tets 1–2 for 2-oxoglutarate were 55–60 μm, i.e. very similar to those for HIF-P4H-2 and slightly higher than those for the collagen prolyl 4-hydroxylase I (Table 2). Interestingly, the Km values of Tets 1 and 2 for oxygen were 30 μm (Fig. 1, D and E), in the same range of ∼40 μm as for the collagen prolyl 4-hydroxylase I but markedly lower than for HIF-P4H-2 (Table 2), indicating that Tets 1 and 2 also display significant activity under hypoxic conditions.TABLE 2Km values of Tets 1 and 2 by comparison with HIF-P4H-2 and collagen prolyl 4-hydroxylase I (C-P4H-I) for the substrate, cosubstrates and cofactorCompoundUnitTet1Tet2HIF-P4H-2aRefs. 26 and 38.C-P4H"
https://openalex.org/W2219311098,"Dysregulation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca(2+) homeostasis triggers ER stress leading to the development of insulin resistance in obesity and diabetes. Impaired function of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) has emerged as a major contributor to ER stress. We pharmacologically activated SERCA2b in a genetic model of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (ob/ob mice) with a novel allosteric activator, CDN1163, which markedly lowered fasting blood glucose, improved glucose tolerance, and ameliorated hepatosteatosis but did not alter glucose levels or body weight in lean controls. Importantly, CDN1163-treated ob/ob mice maintained euglycemia comparable with that of lean mice for >6 weeks after cessation of CDN1163 administration. CDN1163-treated ob/ob mice showed a significant reduction in adipose tissue weight with no change in lean mass, assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. They also showed an increase in energy expenditure using indirect calorimetry, which was accompanied by increased expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and UCP3 in brown adipose tissue. CDN1163 treatment significantly reduced the hepatic expression of genes involved in gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis, attenuated ER stress response and ER stress-induced apoptosis, and improved mitochondrial biogenesis, possibly through SERCA2-mediated activation of AMP-activated protein kinase pathway. The findings suggest that SERCA2b activation may hold promise as an effective therapy for type-2 diabetes and metabolic dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2237399873,"Truncating titin (TTN) mutations, especially in A-band region, represent the most common cause of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Clinical interpretation of these variants can be challenging, as these variants are also present in reference populations. We carried out systematic analyses of TTN truncating variants (TTNtv) in publicly available reference populations, including, for the first time, data from Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC). The goal was to establish more accurate estimate of prevalence of different TTNtv to allow better clinical interpretation of these findings.Using data from 1000 Genomes Project, Exome Sequencing Project (ESP) and ExAC, we estimated the prevalence of TTNtv in the population. In the three population datasets, 52-54% of TTNtv were not affecting all TTN transcripts. The frequency of truncations affecting all transcripts in ExAC was 0.36% (0.32% - 0.41%, 95% CI) and 0.19% (0.16% - 0.23%, 95% CI) for those affecting the A-band. In the A-band region, the prevalences of frameshift, nonsense and essential splice site variants were 0.057%, 0.090%, and 0.047% respectively. Cga/Tga (arginine/nonsense-R/*) transitional change at CpG mutation hotspots was the most frequent type of TTN nonsense mutation accounting for 91.3% (21/23) of arginine residue nonsense mutation (R/*) at TTN A-band region. Non-essential splice-site variants had significantly lower proportion of private variants and higher proportion of low-frequency variants compared to essential splice-site variants (P = 0.01; P = 5.1 X 10-4, respectively).A-band TTNtv are more rare in the general population than previously reported. Based on this analysis, one in 500 carries a truncation in TTN A-band suggesting the penetrance of these potentially harmful variants is still poorly understood, and some of these variants do not manifest as autosomal dominant DCM. This calls for caution when interpreting TTNtv in individuals and families with no history of DCM. Considering the size of TTN, expertise in DNA library preparation, high coverage NGS strategies, validated bioinformatics approach, accurate variant assessment strategy, and confirmatory sequencing are prerequisites for reliable evaluation of TTN in clinical settings, and ideally with the inclusion of mRNA and/or protein level assessment for a definite diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W2219901412,"Coronal mass ejections are solar eruptions driven by a sudden release of magnetic energy stored in the Sun's corona. In many cases, this magnetic energy is stored in long-lived, arched structures called magnetic flux ropes. When a flux rope destabilizes, it can either erupt and produce a coronal mass ejection or fail and collapse back towards the Sun. The prevailing belief is that the outcome of a given event is determined by a magnetohydrodynamic force imbalance called the torus instability. This belief is challenged, however, by observations indicating that torus-unstable flux ropes sometimes fail to erupt. This contradiction has not yet been resolved because of a lack of coronal magnetic field measurements and the limitations of idealized numerical modelling. Here we report the results of a laboratory experiment that reveal a previously unknown eruption criterion below which torus-unstable flux ropes fail to erupt. We find that such 'failed torus' events occur when the guide magnetic field (that is, the ambient field that runs toroidally along the flux rope) is strong enough to prevent the flux rope from kinking. Under these conditions, the guide field interacts with electric currents in the flux rope to produce a dynamic toroidal field tension force that halts the eruption. This magnetic tension force is missing from existing eruption models, which is why such models cannot explain or predict failed torus events."

For the limited number of autopsy reports, small animal models are urgently needed to study the mechanisms of MERS-CoV infection and pathogenesis of the disease and to evaluate the efficacy of therapeutics against MERS-CoV infection. In this study, we developed a transgenic mouse model globally expressing codon-optimized human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV. After intranasal inoculation with MERS-CoV, the mice rapidly developed severe pneumonia and multi-organ damage, with viral replication being detected in the lungs on day 5 and in the lungs, kidneys and brains on day 9 post-infection. In addition, the mice exhibited systemic inflammation with mild to severe pneumonia accompanied by the injury of liver, kidney and spleen with neutrophil and macrophage infiltration. Importantly, the mice exhibited symptoms of paralysis with high viral burden and viral positive neurons on day 9. Taken together, this study characterizes the tropism of MERS-CoV upon infection. Importantly, this hDPP4-expressing transgenic mouse model will be applicable for studying the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV infection and investigating the efficacy of vaccines and antiviral agents designed to combat MERS-CoV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2218703360,"Background Despite control efforts, salmonellosis continues to cause an estimated 1.2 million infections in the United States (US) annually. We describe the incidence of salmonellosis in the US and introduce a novel approach to examine the epidemiologic similarities and differences of individual serotypes. Methods Cases of salmonellosis in humans reported to the laboratory-based National Salmonella Surveillance System during 1996–2011 from US states were included. Coefficients of variation were used to describe distribution of incidence rates of common Salmonella serotypes by geographic region, age group and sex of patient, and month of sample isolation. Results During 1996–2011, more than 600,000 Salmonella isolates from humans were reported, with an average annual incidence of 13.1 cases/100,000 persons. The annual reported rate of Salmonella infections did not decrease during the study period. The top five most commonly reported serotypes, Typhimurium, Enteritidis, Newport, Heidelberg, and Javiana, accounted for 62% of fully serotyped isolates. Coefficients of variation showed the most geographically concentrated serotypes were often clustered in Gulf Coast states and were also more frequently found to be increasing in incidence. Serotypes clustered in particular months, age groups, and sex were also identified and described. Conclusions Although overall incidence rates of Salmonella did not change over time, trends and epidemiological factors differed remarkably by serotype. A better understanding of Salmonella, facilitated by this comprehensive description of overall trends and unique characteristics of individual serotypes, will assist in responding to this disease and in planning and implementing prevention activities."

Important structural transitions occurring during this cycle have been characterized from extensive crystallographic studies. However, the link between observed conformations and the allosteric regulation of binding events at distal sites critical for signaling through G proteins remain unclear. Here we describe molecular dynamics simulations, bioinformatics analysis, and experimental mutagenesis that identifies residues involved in mediating the allosteric coupling of receptor, nucleotide, and helical domain interfaces of Gαi. Most notably, we predict and characterize novel allosteric decoupling mutants, which display enhanced helical domain opening, increased rates of nucleotide exchange, and constitutive activity in the absence of receptor activation. Collectively, our results provide a framework for explaining how binding events and mutations can alter internal dynamic couplings critical for G protein function."
https://openalex.org/W2218364093,"Nematodes inhabiting benthic deep-sea ecosystems account for >90% of the total metazoan abundances and they have been hypothesised to be hyper-diverse, but their biodiversity is still largely unknown. Metabarcoding could facilitate the census of biodiversity, especially for those tiny metazoans for which morphological identification is difficult. We compared, for the first time, different DNA extraction procedures based on the use of two commercial kits and a previously published laboratory protocol and tested their suitability for sequencing analyses of 18S rDNA of marine nematodes. We also investigated the reliability of Roche 454 sequencing analyses for assessing the biodiversity of deep-sea nematode assemblages previously morphologically identified. Finally, intra-genomic variation in 18S rRNA gene repeats was investigated by Illumina MiSeq in different deep-sea nematode morphospecies to assess the influence of polymorphisms on nematode biodiversity estimates. Our results indicate that the two commercial kits should be preferred for the molecular analysis of biodiversity of deep-sea nematodes since they consistently provide amplifiable DNA suitable for sequencing. We report that the morphological identification of deep-sea nematodes matches the results obtained by metabarcoding analysis only at the order-family level and that a large portion of Operational Clustered Taxonomic Units (OCTUs) was not assigned. We also show that independently from the cut-off criteria and bioinformatic pipelines used, the number of OCTUs largely exceeds the number of individuals and that 18S rRNA gene of different morpho-species of nematodes displayed intra-genomic polymorphisms. Our results indicate that metabarcoding is an important tool to explore the diversity of deep-sea nematodes, but still fails in identifying most of the species due to limited number of sequences deposited in the public databases, and in providing quantitative data on the species encountered. These aspects should be carefully taken into account before using metabarcoding in quantitative ecological research and monitoring programmes of marine biodiversity."

PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 are conformational heterodimers, each composed of an (Eallo) and a catalytic (Ecat) monomer. Previous studies suggested that the binding to Eallo of saturated or monounsaturated fatty acids (FAs) that are not COX substrates differentially regulate PGHS-1 versus PGHS-2. Here, we substantiate and expand this concept to include polyunsaturated FAs known to modulate COX activities. Non-substrate FAs like palmitic acid bind Eallo of PGHSs stimulating human (hu) PGHS-2 but inhibiting huPGHS-1. We find the maximal effects of non-substrate FAs on both huPGHSs occurring at the same physiologically relevant FA/AA ratio of ∼20. This inverse allosteric regulation likely underlies the ability of PGHS-2 to operate at low AA concentrations, when PGHS-1 is effectively latent. Unlike FAs tested previously, we observe that C-22 FAs, including ω-3 fish oil FAs, have higher affinities for Ecat than Eallo subunits of PGHSs. Curiously, C-20 ω-3 eicosapentaenoate preferentially binds Ecat of huPGHS-1 but Eallo of huPGHS-2. PGE2 production decreases 50% when fish oil consumption produces tissue EPA/AA ratios of ≥0.2. However, 50% inhibition of huPGHS-1 itself is only seen with ω-3 FA/AA ratios of ≥5.0. This suggests that fish oil-enriched diets disfavor AA oxygenation by altering the composition of the FA pool in which PGHS-1 functions.

Vanilloid receptor-1 is essential for inflammatory thermal hyperalgesia.Nature. 2000; 405: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (1485) Google Scholar). During inflammation, the redox environment surrounding the cells changes due to rapid production of reactive oxygen species. Increased levels of reactive oxygen species are implicated in the etiology of inflammatory hyperalgesia (14Tominaga M. Caterina M.J. Malmberg A.B. Rosen T.A. Gilbert H. Skinner K. Raumann B.E.

Pharmacol. 2007; 374: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Importantly, TRPV1 was found to be responsible for long sustained thermal hypersensitivity in inflammatory hyperalgesia induced by increased levels of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (25Keeble J.E. Bodkin J.V. Liang L. Wodarski R. Davies M. Fernandes E.S. Coelho C. de F. Russell F. Graepel R. Muscara M.N. Malcangio M. Brain S.D.

It is, therefore, possible that oxidative stress triggers hyperalgesia, at least in part, through activation of TRPV1. There have been multiple hypotheses proposed for the regulation of TRPV1 by oxidation. We previously reported that oxidizing agents activate rat TRPV1 (rTRPV1) by modifying the extracellular Cys residues, where Cys modification acts as a “switch” for channel activation (7Yoshida T. Inoue R. Morii T. Takahashi N. Yamamoto S. Hara Y. Tominaga M. Shimizu S. Sato Y. Mori Y. Nitric oxide activates TRP channels by cysteine S-nitrosylation.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 596-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Another group alternatively hypothesized that H2O2 activates chicken TRPV1 (cTRPV1) via oxidizing multiple Cys residues located on the cytoplasmic side; each Cys residue contributing to the activation in a “graded” fashion (26Chuang H.H. Lin S. Oxidative challenges sensitize the capsaicin receptor by covalent cysteine modification.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 20097-20102Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The same group also claimed that C-terminal dimerization through disulfide bond formation is essential for oxidation-induced cTRPV1 activation (27Wang S. Chuang H.H. C-terminal dimerization activates the nociceptive transduction channel transient receptor potential vanilloid 1.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 40601-40607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, a unified view of how oxidizing agents activate the channel has not yet been achieved, although there is a consensus that oxidative modifications of multiple Cys residues are involved in this mode of TRPV1 activation. There are two crucial caveats in the above hypotheses that limit the elucidation of the mechanism underlying TRPV1 activation by oxidation. First, all of the studies concluding the involvement of oxidation of Cys residues in the activation mechanism are heavily based on site-directed Cys mutagenesis experiments, which are often regarded as an indirect approach to assess functional importance of specific residues. Second, most of these mechanistic models are built based on the simple assumption that Cys residues in TRPV1 have predominantly free thiols, both readily accessible and modifiable, at cellular conditions. Although this is a fair assumption based on studies implicating that the intracellular milieu is primarily reduced (28Hansen R.E. Roth D. Winther J.R. Quantifying the global cellular thiol-disulfide status.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 422-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), previous studies have implicated otherwise. For instance, TRPA1 was demonstrated to possess a disulfide bond between Cys residues facing the intracellular side (29Wang L. Cvetkov T.L. Chance M.R. Moiseenkova-Bell V.Y. Identification of in vivo disulfide conformation of TRPA1 ion channel.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 6169-6176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Moreover, TRPV1 has been hypothesized to possess stable structural disulfide bonds because a reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT) alters the cooperative binding of TRPV1-specific agonist resiniferatoxin to rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and regulates rTRPV1 activity when expressed in HEK293 cells (5Susankova K. Tousova K. Vyklicky L. Teisinger J. Vlachova V. Reducing and oxidizing agents sensitize heat-activated vanilloid receptor (TRPV1) current.Mol.

Here we address these two caveats for the previous approaches to understand the role of Cys residues by characterizing the oxidative status of Cys residues in differential redox environments and propose a refined mechanism of TRPV1 activation by oxidation. In particular, we focus on the activation mechanism of human TRPV1 (hTRPV1), which has not been characterized previously. DTT was purchased from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan). Capsaicin, cycloheximide, N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), and iodoacetamide were purchased from Sigma. Fura-2-AM ester, 5-nitro-2-pyridyl disulfide (5-nitro-2-PDS), and 2-pyridyl disulfide were purchased from Dojindo (Kumamoto, Japan). 3-Nitrophenyl disulfide and dipropyl disulfide, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), H2O2, and reduced glutathione were purchased from Wako (Osaka, Japan). 4-Chlorophenyl disulfide and 4-aminophenyl disulfide were purchased from Tokyo Chemical (Tokyo, Japan). NEM, iodoacetamide, cycloheximide, and reactive disulfides were prepared as stock solutions in DMSO and were diluted at working concentrations in aqueous solutions containing 0.01% or 0.1% DMSO. DTT and H2O2 were directly dissolved in aqueous solutions at working concentrations. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 and HEK293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 30 units/ml penicillin, and 30 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C under 5% CO2. HaCaT cells were culture in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 30 units/ml penicillin, 30 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamate at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Plasmids carrying hTRPV1 and rTRPV1 cDNA were prepared as previously described (7Yoshida T. Inoue R. Morii T. Takahashi N. Yamamoto S. Hara Y. Tominaga M. Shimizu S. Sato Y. Mori Y. Nitric oxide activates TRP channels by cysteine S-nitrosylation.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 596-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). TRPV1 and hTRPV1 Cys mutants were subcloned into pCI-neo vector (Promega Corp., Madison, WI), pEGFP-N (Clontech Laboratories, Mountain View, CA), or pCMV-Tag2 (Stratagene, Palo Alto, CA). HEK293 cells and HEK293T cells were transfected with recombinant plasmids using SuperFect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen), respectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions. For intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) measurement and electrophysiological measurements, recombinant plasmids were co-transfected with pEGFP-F and pEGFP-N1, respectively, and HEK293 cells with green fluorescence were analyzed. Transfected cells were grown for 30–40 h before [Ca2+]i measurement and electrophysiological measurements and were grown for 48 h before immunoprecipitation and Western blotting (WB). Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer containing the 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 20 mm NEM. Protein samples were fractioned by electrophoresis through 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE) and analyzed by WB with anti-TRPV1 (Santa Cruz, SC-12498), anti-β-actin (Sigma, A2228), and anti-α-tubulin (Sigma, T6074) antibodies. The chemiluminescence intensities of the bands were measured by Multigauge version 3.0 (Fuji film, Tokyo, Japan). Blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed according to the method of Schägger and co-workers with some modification (32Wittig I. Braun H.P. Schägger H. Blue native PAGE.Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 418-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells transfected with rTRPV1 or hTRPV1 were suspended in sucrose buffer (83 mm sucrose, 6.6 mm imidazole/HCl, 20 mm NEM, pH 7.0) and homogenized with 20–40 strokes using a Dounce homogenizer. The lysates were centrifuge at 15,000 × g, and the pellet was solubilized in 35 μl of solubilization buffer (50 mm NaCl, 50 mm imidazole/HCl, 6 aminohexanoic acid, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm NEM, pH 7.0). Subsequently, 5 μl of 20% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside was added and incubated for 10 min at 4 °C. The sample was then centrifuged at 15,000 × g, and supernatant was collected, mixed with 5 μl of 50% glycerol, and 2.5 μl of 5% Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250. The supernatant was aliquoted into four samples with increasing concentrations of SDS (0, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5%) and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The samples were then subjected to non-denaturing electrophoresis initially at 100 V until the samples were within the stacking gel and were continued with a voltage and current limited to 500 V and 15 mA at 4 °C. After separation, the gel was de-stained for 3 min with 100% methanol and electro-transferred to PVDF membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). After the transfer, the PVDF membrane was incubated in denaturing solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 2% SDS at 50 °C for 30 min. The blots were then analyzed by anti-TRPV1. HEK293 cells transfected with hTRPV1 were detached from the 6-mm dish using trypsin and washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The sample was aliquoted into three samples with the concentrations of disuccinimidyl suberate (Sigma) at final concentration of 0, 25, and 75 μm for 20 min at room temperature. The cross-linking reaction was quenched with 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and samples were mixed with SDS sample buffer and then analyzed by 3–18% polyacrylamide SDS-PAGE and WB with an antibody to TRPV1. The cell surface hTRPV1 was measured by biotinylation as previously described with some modifications (7Yoshida T. Inoue R. Morii T. Takahashi N. Yamamoto S. Hara Y. Tominaga M. Shimizu S. Sato Y. Mori Y. Nitric oxide activates TRP channels by cysteine S-nitrosylation.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 596-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Cells grown in 60-mm dishes were washed with HEPES-buffered saline (HBS) containing 107 mm NaCl, 6 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 2 mm CaCl2, 11.5 mm glucose, and 20 mm HEPES (pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH). After incubation of the cells with 10 mm DTT, dishes were washed with HBS twice and then incubated with sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA) for 30 min at 4 °C. The cells were washed with PBS containing 10 mm glycine 3 times to stop the biotinylation reaction. The cells were then lysed with 300 μl of RIPA buffer with 20 mm NEM and rotated for 2 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the supernatant was collected and incubated with NeutrAvidin-Plus beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 2 h at 4 °C. The proteins were washed with RIPA buffer containing 50 mm NEM 3 times and resuspended in SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and WB. HEK293 cells were transfected with hTRPV1 or hTRPV1 Cys mutants and cultured for 24 h. The cycloheximide was added to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml to culture media, and cells were washed twice with PBS and recovered with RIPA buffer after the indicated times. The samples were mixed with reducing sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and WB using antibody to TRPV1 and β-actin. Quantification of hTRPV1 expression was achieved by normalization with β-actin. DRG neurons were prepared from 4-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats as described previously (6Takahashi N. Mizuno Y. Kozai D. Yamamoto S. Kiyonaka S. Shibata T. Uchida K. Mori Y. Molecular characterization of TRPA1 channel activation by cysteine-reactive inflammatory mediators.Channels. 2008; 2: 287-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The DRG neurons were subjected to WB. All animal experiments were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of the Graduate School of Engineering, Kyoto University. Transfected HEK293 cells were subjected to [Ca2+]i measurement 3–16 h after plating onto poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips. The fura-2 fluorescence was measured in HBS. Fluorescence images of the cells were recorded and analyzed with the video image analysis system AQUACOSMOS (Hamamatsu Photonics, Shizuoka, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fura-2 measurements were carried out at room temperature in HBS. The 340:380-nm ratio images were obtained on a pixel-by-pixel basis and converted to Ca2+ concentrations by in vivo calibrations using 40 μm ionomycin (33Nishida M. Nagao T. Kurose H. Activation of Rac1 increases c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase activity and DNA fragmentation in a calcium-dependent manner in rat myoblast cell line H9c2.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). For electrophysiological measurements, coverslips with cells were placed in dishes containing bath solutions. Currents from cells were recorded at room temperature using patch-clamp techniques of whole-cell mode with EPC-10 (Heka Elektronik, Lambrecht/Pfalz, Germany) patch clamp amplifier as previously described (34Okada T.

Current signals were filtered at 2.9 kHz with a 4-pole Bessel filter and digitized at 10 kHz. Patchmaster (Heka Elektronik) software was used for command pulse control, data acquisition, and data analysis. The series resistance was compensated (50–70%) to minimize voltage errors. A holding potential of −80 mV was used for all experiments. The external solution contained 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm BaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 25 mm HEPES, and 30 mm glucose (pH 7.3 adjusted with NaOH, and osmolarity adjusted to 320 mosm with d-mannitol). The pipette solution contained 140 mm CsCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.3 adjusted with CsOH and osmolarity adjusted to 300 mosm with d-mannitol). For the DTT treatment, liquid junction potential was adjusted before each experiment. FLAG-hTRPV1or FLAG-hTRPV1 Cys mutants were transfected into HEK293T cells. After 48 h the cells were lysed with buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 2% SDS, 50 mm NEM, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate. The cell lysates were sonicated, centrifuged at 15,000 × g, and 10× diluted in RIPA buffer containing 50 mm NEM. FLAG-hTRPV1 was immunoprecipitated with M2 monoclonal antibody conjugated to protein A-agarose breads (Sigma) and rocked overnight at 4 °C. The complex was washed 8 times with RIPA buffer containing 50 mm NEM for 5 min at room temperature and resuspended into SDS sample buffer and rocked for 30 min. The protein samples were fractionated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE. The bands corresponding to the molecular weight of dimeric or monomeric FLAG-hTRPV1 were excised and reduced with 10 mm DTT, alkylated with 55 mm iodoacetamide, and digested in-gel by treatment with trypsin (12.5 ng/μl) or chymotrypsin (10 ng/μl) or glu-C (50 ng/μl) in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate for overnight at 37 °C as previously described (35Grønborg M.

The samples were analyzed by reverse phase liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry using a LTQ-orbitrap-XL hybrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) as follows. A capillary reverse phase HPLC-MS/MS system composed of an Agilent 1100 series gradient pump equipped with Valco C2 valves with 150-μm pots, and LTQ-orbitrap XL hybrid mass spectrometer equipped with an XYZ nano-electrospray ionization source (AMR, Tokyo, Japan) were employed. Samples were automatically injected using PAL system (CTC analytics, Zwingen, Switzerland) into a peptide L-trap column (Chemical Evaluation Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan) attached to an injector valve for desalinating and concentrating peptides. After washing the trap with water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 2% acetonitrile, the peptides were separated on a NTCC-360/100-3-123 column (100 μm diameter, 3 μm C18 particles, Nikkyo Technos Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) using a gradient of A (0.1% formic acid) and B (80% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid). The elution was carried out at 500 nl/min by running from 5% to 45% over 45 min (as shown in FIGURE 5., FIGURE 6.) or 25 min (as shown in FIGURE 8., FIGURE 9.), 95% for 6 min, 5% for 9 min for selected reaction monitoring (SRM) transitions for the peptide containing Cys-158, -258, -363, and -742. The elution was carried out from 25% to 80% over 20 min, 95% for 6 min, and 5% for 9 min for SRM transition for the peptides containing Cys-127 (as shown in Fig. 8). SRM was carried out with collision-induced dissociation (35% normal collision energy), 1 microscan, 100-ms ion time on LTQ linear ion trap.

However, the mechanism by which G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) signal to activate PI3K is poorly understood.

We report that in the absence of FSH, granulosa cells secrete a subthreshold concentration of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) that primes the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) but fails to promote tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1.

https://openalex.org/W2232741814,"Evidence of the short term relationship between maternal and fetal heart rates has been found in previous studies. However there is still limited knowledge about underlying mechanisms and patterns of the coupling throughout gestation. In this study, Transfer Entropy (TE) was used to quantify directed interactions between maternal and fetal heart rates at various time delays and gestational ages. Experimental results using maternal and fetal electrocardiograms showed significant coupling for 63 out of 65 fetuses, by statistically validating against surrogate pairs. Analysis of TE showed a decrease in transfer of information from fetus to the mother with gestational age, alongside the maturation of the fetus. On the other hand, maternal to fetal TE was significantly greater in mid (26-31 weeks) and late (32-41 weeks) gestation compared to early (16-25 weeks) gestation (Mann Whitney Wilcoxon (MWW) p<0.05). TE further increased from mid to late, for the fetuses with RMSSD of fetal heart rate being larger than 4 msec in the late gestation. This difference was not observed for the fetuses with smaller RMSSD, which could be associated with the quiet sleep state. Delay in the information transfer from mother to fetus significantly decreased (p = 0.03) from mid to late gestation, implying a decrease in fetal response time. These changes occur concomitant with the maturation of the fetal sensory and autonomic nervous systems with advancing gestational age. The effect of maternal respiratory rate derived from maternal ECG was also investigated and no significant relationship was found between breathing rate and TE at any lag. In conclusion, the application of TE with delays revealed detailed information on the fetal-maternal heart rate coupling strength and latency throughout gestation, which could provide novel clinical markers of fetal development and well-being."

Defined binding sites in human collagen for integrins, fibronectin, heparin, and MMP-1 have been introduced into the triple-helical domain of the bacterial collagen and led to the expected biological activities. The modular insertion of activities is extended here to the discoidin domain receptors (DDRs), which are collagen-activated receptor tyrosine kinases. Insertion of the DDR-binding sequence from human collagen III into bacterial collagen led to specific receptor binding. However, even at the highest testable concentrations, the construct was unable to stimulate DDR autophosphorylation. The recombinant collagen expressed in Escherichia coli does not contain hydroxyproline (Hyp), and complementary synthetic peptide studies showed that replacement of Hyp by Pro at the critical Gly-Val-Met-Gly-Phe-Hyp position decreased the DDR-binding affinity and consequently required a higher concentration for the induction of receptor activation. The ability of the recombinant bacterial collagen to bind the DDRs without inducing kinase activation suggested it could interfere with the interactions between animal collagen and the DDRs, and such an inhibitory role was confirmed in vitro and with a cell migration assay. This study illustrates that recombinant collagen can complement synthetic peptides in investigating structure-activity relationships, and this system has the potential for the introduction or inhibition of specific biological activities.

Yeast prions [URE3] and [PSI+] propagate as amyloid forms of Ure2 and Sup35 proteins, respectively. Here we find DnaJB6-protected yeast cells from polyglutamine toxicity and cured yeast of both [URE3] prions and weak variants of [PSI+] prions but not strong [PSI+] prions. Weak and strong variants of [PSI+] differ only in the structural conformation of their amyloid cores. In line with its anti-prion effects, DnaJB6 prevented purified Sup35NM from forming amyloids at 37 °C, which produce predominantly weak [PSI+] variants when used to infect yeast, but not at 4 °C, which produces mostly strong [PSI+] variants. Thus, structurally distinct amyloids composed of the same protein were differentially sensitive to the anti-amyloid activity of DnaJB6 both in vitro and in vivo. These findings have important implications for strategies using DnaJB6 as a target for therapy in amyloid disorders.

These findings have important implications for strategies using DnaJB6 as a target for therapy in amyloid disorders. In many mammalian diseases, including Alzheimer, Parkinson, and Huntington diseases, type 2 diabetes, and prion diseases, tissue pathology is associated with accumulation of amyloid, an insoluble, highly ordered fibrous protein aggregate. Elevating expression of protein chaperones, which help other proteins adopt and maintain their native conformations, reduces toxicity associated with amyloidogenic proteins in different model systems (1Nagai Y. Fujikake N. Popiel H.A. Wada K. Induction of molecular chaperones as a therapeutic strategy for the polyglutamine diseases.Curr. Pharm. Biotechnol. 2010; 11: 188-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In particular, Hsp70 and its Hsp40 (J-protein) co-chaperone partners provide broad protective effects. A major role of Hsp70 and Hsp40 is to prevent aggregation of misfolded proteins, but they also protect cells from toxicity caused by amyloid-forming proteins without preventing formation of aggregates (2Warrick J.M. Chan H.Y. Gray-Board G.L. Chai Y. Paulson H.L. Bonini N.M. Suppression of polyglutamine-mediated neurodegeneration in Drosophila by the molecular chaperone HSP70.Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 425-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar, 3Douglas P.M. Treusch S. Ren H.Y. Halfmann R. Duennwald M.L. Lindquist S. Cyr D.M. Chaperone-dependent amyloid assembly protects cells from prion toxicity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 7206-7211Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). These observations led to a view that toxicity is due to something other than amyloid itself, such as non-amyloid oligomeric aggregates, and that the chaperones might neutralize toxic effects by promoting incorporation of such aggregates into more benign amyloid fibers. J-proteins are defined by a signature J-domain that mediates physical interaction with the ATPase regulatory domain of Hsp70. J-proteins have amplified through evolution more than other chaperone families. For example, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and humans each encode about a dozen Hsp70s, but yeast encodes 22 J-proteins, whereas humans have roughly 50. This difference suggests that any additional roles for Hsp70 demanded by increases in cell complexity and differentiation were met in part by an expansion in the number and diversity of J-proteins that regulate Hsp70 activity (4Kampinga H.H. Craig E.A. The HSP70 chaperone machinery: J proteins as drivers of functional specificity.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 579-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar). Human J-proteins are categorized into DnaJA, DnaJB, and DnaJC families on the basis of structural similarities (4Kampinga H.H. Craig E.A. The HSP70 chaperone machinery: J proteins as drivers of functional specificity.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 579-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar). The two major cytosolic yeast Hsp40 J-proteins Ydj1 and Sis1 are most closely related to the DnaJA and DnaJB families, respectively. Elevating expression of DnaJB6b and DnaJB8, but not other DnaJ proteins, blocks aggregation and toxicity of Huntington related polyglutamine (polyQ) 4The abbreviations used is:polyQ, polyglutamine. in human cells (5Hageman J.

DnaJB6b is a cytosolic splice variant of the C-terminally extended DnaJB6a that is localized in the nucleus and does not block toxicity. Its protective effect does not depend on J-domain function, which reflects Hsp70-independent activity and is consistent with the inability of Hsp70 to confer similar protection (5Hageman J.

DNAJB6 is a peptide-binding chaperone which can suppress amyloid fibrillation of polyglutamine peptides at substoichiometric molar ratios.Cell Stress Chaperones. 2014; 19: 227-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and sub-stoichiometric amounts of DnaJB6 prevent both the nucleation of Aβ peptides into amyloid and the incorporation of Aβ into pre-existing amyloid fibers (8Månsson C. Arosio P. Hussein R. Kampinga H.H. Hashem R.M. Boelens W.C. Dobson C.M. Knowles T.P. Linse S. Emanuelsson C.

Chem. 2014; 289: 31066-31076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Thus, it has been proposed that DnaJB6 protects cellsfrom toxic effects of amyloid-forming proteins by binding to peptides and oligomers that have a high propensity to form amyloids and prevent their maturation into amyloid. This mechanism is distinct from those that relieve toxicity without preventing aggregation in that it neutralizes putatively toxic oligomers and blocks formation of amyloid that might continue to promote production of toxic species. Yeast prions provide a genetic model of pathogenic amyloids useful for investigating effects of chaperones on amyloid in vivo (9Reidy M. Masison D.C. Yeast prions help identify and define chaperone interaction networks.Curr. Pharm. Biotechnol. 2014; 15: 1008-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Stable propagation of prions in dividing yeast cells requires continued fragmentation of amyloid fibers into new propagons, or seeds, that are passed with cytoplasm to daughter cells (10Cox B. Ness F. Tuite M. Analysis of the generation and segregation of propagons: entities that propagate the [PSI+] prion in yeast.Genetics. 2003; 165: 23-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This fragmentation depends on the normal cellular functions of the protein disaggregation machinery that is driven by Hsp104 in cooperation with Hsp70 and its Sis1 and nucleotide exchange factor co-chaperones (11Chernoff Y.O. Lindquist S.L. Ono B. Inge-Vechtomov S.G. Liebman S.W.

Prokaryotic chaperones support yeast prions and thermotolerance and define disaggregation machinery interactions.Genetics. 2012; 192: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Different prions depend on this machinery to different degrees, so impairing disaggregation machinery function by altering the activity of these components can affect their propagation differently (9Reidy M. Masison D.C. Yeast prions help identify and define chaperone interaction networks.Curr. Pharm. Biotechnol. 2014; 15: 1008-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 19Sporn Z.A. Hines J.K. Hsp40 function in yeast prion propagation: amyloid diversity necessitates chaperone functional complexity.Prion. 2015; 9: 80-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For example, by competing with Sis1, elevating expression of Ydj1 efficiently cures cells of [URE3] prions, which are composed of Ure2 protein, but not [PSI+] prions composed of Sup35 (20Wickner R.B. Evidence for a prion analog in S. cerevisiae: the [URE3] non-Mendelian genetic element as an altered URE2 protein.Science. 1994; 264: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar, 21Moriyama H.

Biol. 2000; 20: 8916-8922Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), and elevating Hsp104 has the opposite effects on these prions (11Chernoff Y.O. Lindquist S.L. Ono B. Inge-Vechtomov S.G. Liebman S.W. Role of the chaperone protein Hsp104 in propagation of the yeast prion-like factor [psi+].Science. 1995; 268: 880-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar, 21Moriyama H.

Biol. 2000; 20: 8916-8922Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The general ability of DnaJB6 to interfere with the formation of amyloid composed of different proteins suggests it could act as an anti-prion factor in yeast but in a manner mechanistically distinct from the yeast chaperones. Indeed, we find here that expressing DnaJB6b in yeast cures cells of [URE3] prions in an apparently direct manner that is clearly distinct from that of curing by Ydj1. Importantly, DnaJB6b also cured “weak” variants of [PSI+], but it was ineffective against phenotypically stronger [PSI+] variants. Thus, anti-amyloid activity of DnaJB6b in vivo was limited by the structural characteristics of different amyloids composed of the same protein. We further show that this limitation is related to its ability to block formation of Sup35NM amyloid in vitro only under conditions that produce material that is thermodynamically similar to Ure2 amyloid and that generates weak [PSI+] prions when used to infect yeast. These findings provide further insight into the remarkable properties of DnaJB6b and raise important concerns regarding use of DnaJB6 as a target for therapies in amyloid diseases. Yeast strains used are isogenic to 1075 (MATa, kar1-1, PDAL5::ADE2, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1, trp1Δ63, ura3-52, SUQ5, [URE3]) (22Sharma D. Masison D.C. Functionally redundant isoforms of a yeast Hsp70 chaperone subfamily have different antiprion effects.Genetics. 2008; 179: 1301-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). 779-6A is the same but has ade2-1 in place of PDAL5::ADE2, is [ure-o], and has endogenous strong [PSI+] and [PIN+], both of uncertain origin. [PSI+] prion variants were cytoduced into a [rho°] version of 779-6A that had been cured of prions by passage on medium containing 3 mm guanidine-HCl to generate strains 1566, 1567, 1586, and 1587. Strains 1566 and 1567 were made using strains JW129 [PSI+]Sc4 (strong) and JW127 [PSI+]Sc37 (weak) as prion donors (23Tanaka M. Chien P. Naber N. Cooke R. Weissman J.S.

Similarly, strains 1586 and 1587 were made using L2892 [PSI+]W (weak, here designated SL[PSI+]W) and L2885 [PSI+]S (strong, here designated SL[PSI+]S) as prion donors (24Mathur V. Hong J.Y.

YPAD contains 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 400 mg/liter (excess) adenine and 2% dextrose. To monitor prion phenotypes cells were grown on 1/2YPD (0.5% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose), which contains a limiting but undefined amount of adenine. To maintain plasmids, cells were grown on minimal synthetic dextrose media, which contain 2% dextrose and 0.7% yeast nitrogen base supplemented with appropriate nutrients. SRaf is 2% raffinose and 0.7% yeast nitrogen base, and SGal is 2% galactose, 2% raffinose, and 0.7% yeast nitrogen base. Limiting adenine in selective media was 10 mg/liter.

Ure2 represses transcription of nitrogen catabolism genes, so depletion of soluble Ure2 into [URE3] prion aggregates results in activation of such genes, such as DAL5. Our strains have ADE2 controlled by the DAL5 promoter (PDAL5), so [URE3] cells are white on limiting adenine and Ade+, whereas [ure-o] cells are red and require exogenous adenine. Strains used for monitoring [PSI+] have ade2-1, a nonsense allele that is suppressed by [PSI+] in cells with SUQ5 due to the depletion of Sup35 into prion aggregates. Thus, [PSI+] cells are white or pink and Ade+, whereas [psi−] cells are red and require adenine. Strain 779-6A was transformed with plasmids encoding polyQ103GFP and human J-proteins under the control of the GAL1 promoter or empty vectors as indicated. After overnight growth in SRaf, cultures were diluted to an A600 of 0.25 and then serially diluted and spotted onto SRaf or SGal plates. The latter induce expression of human J-proteins and/or polyQ103GFP. Plates were scanned 3 days after incubation at 30 °C. For fluorescence microscopy, transformants grown in SRaf overnight were subcultured into SGal. Cells were imaged after 4 h of incubation at 30 °C using a Nikon Eclipse Ni microscope equipped with a Q-Imaging Retiga EXi digital camera, Plan APO VC 60× oil immersion differential interference contrast optics, and short-pass GFP filter. Cells were cured of prions by overexpression of J-proteins by either inducible (GAL1 promoter) or constitutive (GPD or TEF1 promoter) expression. For inducible expression, transformants were first grown overnight in synthetic dextrose then diluted into SGal supplemented with the appropriate nutrients. Aliquots were removed at the indicated time points and plated onto 1/2YPD plates. Percent red (non-sectored) colonies were scored as [prion−] and plotted as a function of the number of cell divisions. For constitutive expression, both red and sectored colonies that arose on primary transformation plates were scored as curing events (see “Results”). Plates were scored and scanned after 3–5 days of incubation at 30 °C. Sample preparation and Western blotting was performed as described (25Reidy M. Sharma R. Shastry S. Roberts B.L. Albino-Flores I.

Briefly, 10 absorption units of cells were lysed in 250 μl of SDS-PAGE loading dye (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 3% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, bromphenol blue) by vortexing with an equal volume of glass beads for 90 s followed by boiling for 5 min. Lysates were centrifuged for 5 min at 12,000 × g, and 5 μl of supernatant was loaded per lane onto 4–20% Criterion Tris-HCl TGX gels (Bio-Rad). c-Myc-tagged proteins were detected using rabbit anti-c-Myc (Abcam #ab9106) and goat anti-rabbit (Bio-Rad #170-6515) antibodies. Numbers of prion propagons per cell were determined using an established method (10Cox B. Ness F. Tuite M. Analysis of the generation and segregation of propagons: entities that propagate the [PSI+] prion in yeast.Genetics. 2003; 165: 23-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown until colonies were just visible on YPAD plates containing 4 mm guanidine-HCl, which inhibits Hsp104 and blocks replication of prions. Entire colonies were removed, suspended in water, and spread onto synthetic dextrose plates lacking adenine. The number of resulting Ade+ colonies is an estimation of the number of propagons in the cell that gave rise to the original colony. Sup35NM was expressed, and lysates were prepared as previously described (27Gorkovskiy A. Thurber K.R. Tycko R. Wickner R.B.

Purified Sup35NM was recovered using a batch purification method in the presence of 8 m urea. It was then concentrated to 2 mm using Amicon Ultra spin concentrators and followed by buffer exchange to 6 m guanidine-HCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate pH 7.5. Aliquots were stored at −80 °C until use.

The present study was undertaken to explore the circulating genotypes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) in this region. A total of 189 MTBC strains were collected from smear positive pulmonary tuberculosis cases from different designated microscopy centres (DMC) from various localities of Assam. All MTBC isolates were cultured on Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ) media and subsequently genotyped using spoligotyping and 24-loci mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units-variable number of tandem repeats (MIRU-VNTR) typing. Spoligotyping of MTBC isolates revealed 89 distinct spoligo patterns. The most dominant MTBC strain belonged to Beijing lineage and was represented by 35.45% (n = 67) of total isolates, followed by MTBC strains belonging to Central Asian-Delhi (CAS/Delhi) lineage and East African Indian (EAI5) lineage. In addition, in the present study 43 unknown spoligo patterns were detected. The discriminatory power of spoligotyping was found to be 0.8637 based on Hunter Gaston Discriminatory Index (HGDI). On the other hand, 24-loci MIRU-VNTR typing revealed that out of total 189 MTBC isolates from Assam 185 (97.9%) isolates had unique MIRU-VNTR profiles and 4 isolates grouped into 2 clusters. Phylogenetic analysis of 67 Beijing isolates based on 24-loci MIRU-VNTR typing revealed that Beijing isolates from Assam represent two major groups, each comprising of several subgroups. Neighbour-Joining (NJ) phylogenetic tree analysis based on combined spoligotyping and 24-loci MIRU-VNTR data of 78 Non-Beijing isolates was carried out for strain lineage identification as implemented by MIRU-VNTRplus database. The important lineages of MTBC identified were CAS/CAS1_Delhi (41.02%, n = 78) and East-African-Indian (EAI, 33.33%). Interestingly, phylogenetic analysis of orphan (23.28%) MTBC spoligotypes revealed that majority of these orphan isolates from Assam represent two new sub-clades Assam/EAI and Assam/CAS. The prevalence of multidrug resistance (MDR) in Beijing and Non-Beijing strains was found to be 10.44% and 9.01% respectively. In conclusion, the present study has shown the predominance of Beijing isolates in Assam which is a matter of great concern because Beijing strains are considered to be ecologically more fit enabling wider dissemination of M. tuberculosis. Other interesting finding of the present study is the discovery of two new clades of MTBC isolates circulating in Assam. More elaborate longitudinal studies are required to be undertaken in this region to understand the transmission dynamics of MTBC."
https://openalex.org/W2218730544,"Engineering of the central carbon metabolism of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to redirect metabolic flux towards cytosolic acetyl-CoA has become a central topic in yeast biotechnology. A cell factory with increased flux into acetyl-CoA can be used for heterologous production of terpenoids for pharmaceuticals, biofuels, fragrances, or other acetyl-CoA derived compounds. In a previous study, we identified promising metabolic engineering targets in S. cerevisiae using an in silico stoichiometric metabolic network analysis. Here, we validate selected in silico strategies in vivo.Patchoulol was produced by yeast via a heterologous patchoulol synthase of Pogostemon cablin. To increase the metabolic flux from acetyl-CoA towards patchoulol, a truncated HMG-CoA reductase was overexpressed and farnesyl diphosphate synthase was fused with patchoulol synthase. The highest increase in production could be achieved by modifying the carbon source; sesquiterpenoid titer increased from glucose to ethanol by a factor of 8.4. Two strategies predicted in silico were chosen for validation in this work. Disruption of α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase gene (KGD1) was predicted to redirect the metabolic flux via the pyruvate dehydrogenase bypass towards acetyl-CoA. The metabolic flux was redirected as predicted, however, the effect was dependent on cultivation conditions and the flux was interrupted at the level of acetate. High amounts of acetate were produced. As an alternative pathway to synthesize cytosolic acetyl-CoA, ATP-citrate lyase was expressed as a polycistronic construct, however, in vivo performance of the enzyme needs to be optimized to increase terpenoid production.Stoichiometric metabolic network analysis can be used successfully as a metabolic prediction tool. However, this study highlights that kinetics, regulation and cultivation conditions may interfere, resulting in poor in vivo performance. Main sites of regulation need to be released and improved enzymes are essential to meet the required activities for an increased product formation in vivo."

Tear samples were obtained from six healthy dogs, and one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (1D SDS-PAGE) was used as a first step to separate intact proteins into 17 bands. Each fraction was then trypsin digested and analysed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS/MS) to characterize the protein components in each fraction. In total, 125 tear proteins were identified, with MCA (Major Canine Allergen), Serum albumin, UPF0557 protein C10orf119 homolog, Collagen alpha-2(I) chain, Tyrosine -protein kinase Fer, Keratine type II cytoskeletal, Beta-crystallin B2, Interleukin-6 and Desmin occurring as the most confident ones with the highest scores.

https://openalex.org/W2201863950,"A network model for the determination of tumor metabolic fluxes from 13C NMR kinetic isotopomer data has been developed and validated with perfused human DB-1 melanoma cells carrying the BRAF V600E mutation, which promotes oxidative metabolism. The model generated in the bonded cumomer formalism describes key pathways of tumor intermediary metabolism and yields dynamic curves for positional isotopic enrichment and spin-spin multiplets. Cells attached to microcarrier beads were perfused with 26 mm [1,6-13C2]glucose under normoxic conditions at 37 °C and monitored by 13C NMR spectroscopy. Excellent agreement between model-predicted and experimentally measured values of the rates of oxygen and glucose consumption, lactate production, and glutamate pool size validated the model. ATP production by glycolytic and oxidative metabolism were compared under hyperglycemic normoxic conditions; 51% of the energy came from oxidative phosphorylation and 49% came from glycolysis. Even though the rate of glutamine uptake was ∼50% of the tricarboxylic acid cycle flux, the rate of ATP production from glutamine was essentially zero (no glutaminolysis). De novo fatty acid production was ∼6% of the tricarboxylic acid cycle flux. The oxidative pentose phosphate pathway flux was 3.6% of glycolysis, and three non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway exchange fluxes were calculated. Mass spectrometry was then used to compare fluxes through various pathways under hyperglycemic (26 mm) and euglycemic (5 mm) conditions. Under euglycemic conditions glutamine uptake doubled, but ATP production from glutamine did not significantly change. A new parameter measuring the Warburg effect (the ratio of lactate production flux to pyruvate influx through the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier) was calculated to be 21, close to upper limit of oxidative metabolism.

Cancer cells exhibit metabolic patterns that differ significantly from those of terminally differentiated adult tissues. They require rapid production of both energy and biosynthetic precursors to sustain a high rate of proliferation. The network of biochemical pathways underlying these processes is complex. Most of the individual enzymatic conversions involved in this network have probably already been identified, but a comprehensive and quantitative description of the fluxes involved is lacking. Methods to produce such descriptions will likely be very useful in the design of new therapeutics that specifically target the metabolic abnormalities of cancer as well as in clinical implementation of non-invasive methods for detection of cancer and its therapeutic response.

Modeling of tumor metabolic fluxes has been limited to steady-state analysis with dynamic measurements of glucose uptake and lactate production subsequently added to convert to absolute fluxes; none of these models has been validated. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first validated dynamic flux model of tumor intermediary metabolism based on 13C NMR isotope kinetic data. Mathematical models of 13C magnetic resonance spectroscopy data are based on measurement of positional isotopic enrichment and/or on isotopomer analysis, which takes into account spin-spin coupling of covalently bonded labeled carbon atoms. Bonded cumomer analysis includes both positional enrichment and isotopomer modeling and facilitates the formulation of kinetic differential equations. This method requires fewer equations than classical isotopomer analysis and is based on internal symmetry properties of metabolite isotopomers.

During NMR experiments, ∼5 × 108 cells were grown on the surface of non-porous microcarriers that had a mean diameter of 170 μm (SoloHill, Ann Arbor, MI). The surface of the microcarriers was coated with either collagen or ProNectinF® to enhance cell attachment and proliferation. The microcarriers were tightly packed inside a 20-mm NMR tube. They were perfused continuously with the system shown in Fig. 1A. A detailed description of the perfusion system, including flow rates, cell adhesion procedures, etc., has been presented previously (20Mancuso A. Beardsley N.J. Wehrli S. Pickup S. Matschinsky F.M. Glickson J.D. Real-time detection of 13C NMR labeling kinetics in perfused EMT6 mouse mammary tumor cells and βHC9 mouse insulinomas.Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2004; 87: 835-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A peristaltic pump (Masterflex, Cole Parmer, Chicago) was used to circulate medium through the microcarriers at a flow rate of 12 ml/min. Before entering the cell mass, the medium flowed through a gas exchange module where carbon dioxide was removed, and oxygen was added across a silicone membrane (thin-wall silicone tubing). Subsequently, the medium was warmed to 40 °C, and the oxygen level was measured continuously with a polarographic oxygen probe (Mettler-Toledo, Columbus, OH). The steady-state oxygen level of the medium at the inlet of the cell mass was maintained near air saturation. A second polarographic oxygen probe was used to detect the oxygen level of the medium coming out of the NMR tube so that the oxygen consumption rate of the culture could be determined continuously. A pH probe (Mettler-Toledo, Columbus, OH) was also used downstream of the outlet oxygen probe. The pH of the medium was controlled by adjusting the level of CO2 in the gas exchange module. The temperature of the medium entering the NMR tube was fine-tuned with a microstat-controller and an electrical resistance heater to 37 ± 0.2 °C. The glucose concentration in the recirculating medium was maintained at a constant level (clamped) by continuously feeding fresh medium and removing depleted medium from a recirculation bottle. The flow rate of fresh medium to the system was typically 24 ml/h, and the volume of recirculating medium was 120 ml. During the 13C experiments, 32 mm [1,6-13C2]glucose was introduced into the feed to the system, and the recirculating glucose level was clamped at 26 mm by adjusting the feed rate. 13C NMR spectra were acquired with standard 1H decoupled NOE 13C acquisition on a 9.4 tesla/89 mm vertical bore Varian spectrometer (Varian Inc., Palo Alto, CA). The acquisition parameters were as follows: 60° pulse angle, 1.2-s repetition rate, 25,000 Hz spectral width, 16,384 points, and 750 transients per spectrum. To ensure that 1H decoupling did not raise the temperature of the perfusate above 37.5 °C, the temperature of the medium leaving the NMR tube was continuously monitored with a thermocouple. Free induction decays were apodized by exponential multiplication (2 Hz) for signal to noise enhancement. Nuts NMR (Acorn NMR, Fremont, CA) was used to determine resonance peak areas. The cell number in the NMR tube was determined from the total NTP level as described previously (27Mancuso A. Fernandez E.J. Blanch H.W. Clark D.S. A nuclear magnetic resonance technique for determining hybridoma cell concentration in hollow fiber bioreactors.Biotechnology. 1990; 8: 1282-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). 31P spectral parameters were 60° pulse angle, 1-s repetition rate, 15,000 Hz, and 1200 transients. In this work, melanoma cells were initially studied under normoxic hyperglycemic conditions to enhance lactic acidosis (28Leeper D.B. Engin K. Thistlethwaite A.J. Hitchon H.D. Dover J.D. Li D.J.

Acid pH in tumors and its potential for therapeutic exploitation.Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4373-4384PubMed Google Scholar) and subsequently under euglycemic conditions to more closely simulate in vivo conditions. The effects of glucose concentration on flux through various pathways of tumor metabolism were evaluated. In the initial studies, the concentration of glucose in the perfusate was maintained at 26 mm, a value that we believe would be the upper limit for a therapeutic procedure. In subsequent studies, the glucose concentration was 5 mm. The kinetics of labeling in lactate, glutamate, and other metabolites was monitored over an ∼6-h time course. The results were used to estimate intracellular fluxes. The estimated TCA cycle flux was compared with the oxygen consumption flux to test the accuracy of the calculations. DB-1 cells were grown in T-150 flasks in α-minimal essential medium. At about 70% confluency of cells in the flask, the medium was replaced with DMEM with 5 mm [1,2-13C]glucose (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc., Cambridge, MA) and incubated for 8 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The cells were harvested by using 0.05% trypsin/EDTA (Invitrogen), rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 4 °C, and frozen. The cells were homogenized after adding 4 ml of 12 m perchloric acid and were spun at 13,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was neutralized with 3 m KOH, lyophilized, and dissolved in 0.6 ml of D2O. High resolution NMR spectra of the metabolites were generated using a 9.4-tesla spectrometer (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA) equipped with a 5-mm broadband probe. Proton-decoupled 13C spectra were acquired with the following parameters: sweep width = 20 kHz, number of points = 128,000, flip angle 30°, repetition time = 7.3 s, and number of average = 7000. The proton-observed carbon-edited NMR technique (30Fitzpatrick S.M. Hetherington H.P. Behar K.L. Shulman R.G. The flux from glucose to glutamate in the rat brain in vivo as determined by 1H-observed, 13C-edited NMR spectroscopy.J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1990; 10: 170-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) was employed to differentiate between the 13C-labeled and -unlabeled lactate signals in the proton spectra with the following parameters: sweep width = 5 kHz, number of points = 32,000, repetition time = 12 s, echo time = 1/J = 7.8 ms, and number of average = 64. Experiments were run in duplicate. iNMR software (Mestrelab Research, Spain) was used for spectral fitting and integration. DB-1 cells were grown on C104-1521 microcarriers (SoloHill) in uncoated T-75 flasks with α-minimal essential medium. At about 70% confluency of cells on the microcarrier beads, the medium was replaced with DMEM with 2 mm l-glutamine (U-13C5, 99%) (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc.). Two concentrations of glucose were used in the medium, 5 and 25 mm. After 8 h of incubation, the cells were carefully stripped from the microcarriers using mechanical agitation. Microcarriers were allowed to settle, and suspension containing cells was collected. Cells were rinsed twice with PBS at 4 °C and frozen until metabolite extraction. For fatty acid labeling, cells were grown, incubated, and harvested as above with the exception that the incubation was performed for 24 h and the label used was l-glutamine (13C5, 99%; 15N2, 99%) (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc.). The isotope-enriched cells were washed twice with PBS and resuspended in 700 μl of ice-cold methanol. Samples were pulse-sonicated for 30 s and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was then transferred to another tube and evaporated to dryness under nitrogen. Samples were resuspended in 100 μl of water and analyzed using an Agilent 1200 series HPLC system coupled to an Agilent 6460 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an ESI source operated in the negative ion mode. The injection volume was 10 μl. Analytes were separated by reverse-phase ion-pairing chromatography utilizing a Phenomenex Luna C18 column (150 × 2.00 mm, 3 μm particle size) at a flow rate of 200 μl/min and maintained at 45 °C. A two-gradient solvent system was used, with solvent A as 400 mm 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol and 10 mm diisopropylethylamine in water, and solvent B as 400 mm 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol and 10 mm diisopropylethylamine in methanol. The linear gradient conditions were as follows: 2% B at 0 min; 2% B at 4 min; 95% B at 9 min; 95% B at 11 min; and 2% B at 11.5 min, followed by a 3.5-min equilibration. The Agilent 6460 mass spectrometer operating conditions were as follows: gas temperature was set at 320 °C, and the gas flow was set to 8 liters/min. The sheath gas temperature was 400 °C, and the sheath gas flow was set to 10 liters/min. The capillary voltage was set to 3000 V, and the nozzle voltage was set to 1000 V. To calculate fluxes through key pathways of tumor energy metabolism from 13C isotopic labeling data, we have utilized a novel three-compartment metabolic network model with the bionetwork schematically depicted in Fig. 2 and applicable to Continuous Stirred Tank Bioreactor systems. The model includes medium, cytosolic and mitochondrial compartments interconnected with various transporters. The cytosolic membrane contains glucose (GLUT), monocarboxylic acid (MCT), and glutamine (GLN) transporters to the cytosolic compartment. Tumors generally express GLUT1 and GLUT3, but only GLUT1 is currently included in the model; similarly DB-1 contains MCT1 and MCT4 in approximately equal proportions (26Wahl M.L. Owen J.A. Burd R. Herlands R.A. Nogami S.S. Rodeck U. Berd D. Leeper D.B. Owen C.S. Regulation of intracellular pH in human melanoma: potential therapeutic implications.Mol. Cancer Ther. 2002; 1: 617-628PubMed Google Scholar), but because the Km value of MCT1 is ∼1/10th that of MCT4, we have only included MCT1 in the current model. We have included the GLN transporter (alanine-serine-cysteine (GLN) transporter 2) because of the critical role of glutamine in tumor energetics and metabolism. The BC model can readily be extended to incorporate other isoforms of MCT and GLUT as well as transporters for other amino acids and metabolites. The mitochondrial pyruvate carrier, which was recently identified in all mammalian cells (31Herzig S. Raemy E. Montessuit S. Veuthey J.L. Zamboni N. Westermann B. Kunji E.R. Martinou J.C.

A mitochondrial pyruvate carrier required for pyruvate uptake in yeast, Drosophila, and humans.Science. 2012; 337: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar), was included to permit access of pyruvate to the PDH complex for conversion to acetyl-CoA and incorporation into the TCA cycle. Pyruvate is also linked to the TCA cycle via pyruvate carboxylase. Citrate, glutamate, and malate are included in the cytosolic compartment with direct links through the mitochondria to the TCA cycle. As already noted, the mitochondrial compartment contains the complete TCA cycle with links to the cytosol for citrate and malate. α-Ketoglutarate is linked to glutamate via glutamate dehydrogenase (GLUD) and two aminotransferases, aspartate aminotransferase (GOT) and alanine aminotransferase (GPT). A constructed BC dynamic model adapted to perfusion bioreactor experiments was used to fit the 13C time courses of labeled lactate, glutamate, and fatty acids to determine the corresponding metabolic fluxes and the transport parameter for bidirectional lactate transport through the cell membrane. In the model, the perfused [1,6-13C2]glucose and glutamine (labeled in some experiments, see below) are transported from the extracellular medium to the DB-1 cells assuming that reversible non-steady-state Michaelis-Menten facilitative transport kinetics occurs through glucose (GLUT family) or glutamine (alanine-serine-cysteine (GLN) transporter 2) transporters as shown in Equation 1, Jitr=Jtrmax(MeiKmitr−MiKmitr)1+MeiKmiei+MiKmitr(Eq. 1) where Jitr is the net transport flux for boundary species i between media and cytosol or cytosol and mitochondria; Mei is the extracellular concentration for species i; Jtrmax is the maximal transport rate; Kmirtr is the Michaelis-Menten constant for transport. The labeled lactate from the cell is transported into the medium and obeys the same Michaelis-Menten kinetics through the mono-carboxylic acid transporter (MCT family). In this study, facilitated media-cell transport is assumed for glucose, lactate, and glutamine. The metabolic network includes glycolysis, TCA cycle, α-ketoglutarate-glutamate, and oxaloacetate-aspartate exchange through the following: malate-aspartate shuttle; anaplerosis through (a) pyruvate carboxylase activity, (b) at the succinyl-CoA level, and (c) glutaminolysis through mitochondrial glutaminases (GLS and GLS2); pyruvate recycling through cytosolic (NADP+-dependent ME1) and mitochondrial malic enzymes (NAD+-dependent ME2 and NADP+-dependent ME3); lactate dehydrogenase activity; and transport processes. In this study, PPP fluxes through oxidative and non-oxidative branches were included in the modeling analysis. The network also includes de novo lipogenesis and fatty acid oxidation. The model was expressed mathematically using two types of mass balance equations, i.e. for chemi"
https://openalex.org/W2275624278,"Gram positive mycobacteria with a high GC content, such as the etiological agent of tuberculosis Mycobacterium tuberculosis, possess an outer membrane mainly composed of mycolic acids (MAs), the so-called mycomembrane, which is essential for the cell. About thirty genes are involved in the biosynthesis of MAs, which include the hadA, hadB and hadC genes that encode the dehydratases Fatty Acid Synthase type II (FAS-II) known to function as the heterodimers HadA-HadB and HadB-HadC. The present study shows that M. smegmatis cells remain viable in the absence of either HadA and HadC or both. Inactivation of HadC has a dramatic effect on the physiology and fitness of the mutant strains whereas that of HadA exacerbates the phenotype of a hadC deletion. The hadC mutants exhibit a novel MA profile, display a distinct colony morphology, are less aggregated, are impaired for sliding motility and biofilm development and are more resistant to detergent. Conversely, the hadC mutants are significantly more susceptible to low- and high-temperature and to selective toxic compounds, including several current anti-tubercular drugs."

We have previously shown that it can promote the activation of the GTPase ARF6 in a heterologous overexpressing system.

Furthermore, how ARF6 coordinates the activation of complex cellular responses needs to be further elucidated. In this study, we demonstrate that Ang II receptors engage β-arrestin, but not Gq, to mediate ARF6 activation in HEK 293 cells. To further confirm the key role of β-arrestin proteins, we overexpressed β-arrestin2-(1–320), a dominant negative mutant known to block receptor endocytosis. We show that expression of this truncated construct does not support the activation of the GTPase nor cell migration. Interestingly, β-arrestin2 can interact with the ARF guanine nucleotide exchange factor ARNO, although the C-terminally lacking mutant does not. We finally examined whether receptor endocytosis controlled ARF6 activation and cell migration. Although the clathrin inhibitor PitStop2 did not impact the ability of Ang II to activate ARF6, cell migration was markedly impaired. To further show that ARF activation regulates key signaling events leading to migration, we also examined MAPK activation. We demonstrate that this signaling axis is relevant in smooth muscle cells of the vasculature.

https://openalex.org/W2232049923,"Yeast Pichia pastoris is a widely used system for heterologous protein expression. However, post-translational modifications, especially glycosylation, usually impede pharmaceutical application of recombinant proteins because of unexpected alterations in protein structure and function. The aim of this study was to identify glycosylation sites on recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor-BB (rhPDGF-BB) secreted by P. pastoris, and investigate possible effects of O-linked glycans on PDGF-BB functional activity. PDGF-BB secreted by P. pastoris is very heterogeneous and contains multiple isoforms. We demonstrated that PDGF-BB was O-glycosylated during the secretion process and detected putative O-glycosylation sites using glycosylation staining and immunoblotting. By site-directed mutagenesis and high-resolution LC/MS analysis, we, for the first time, identified two threonine residues at the C-terminus as the major O-glycosylation sites on rhPDGF-BB produced in P. pastoris. Although O-glycosylation resulted in heterogeneous protein expression, the removal of glycosylation sites did not affect rhPDGF-BB mitogenic activity. In addition, the unglycosylated PDGF-BBΔGly mutant exhibited the immunogenicity comparable to that of the wild-type form. Furthermore, antiserum against PDGF-BBΔGly also recognized glycosylated PDGF-BB, indicating that protein immunogenicity was unaltered by glycosylation. These findings elucidate the effect of glycosylation on PDGF-BB structure and biological activity, and can potentially contribute to the design and production of homogeneously expressed unglycosylated or human-type glycosylated PDGF-BB in P. pastoris for pharmaceutical applications."

Many prior papers have pinpointed several serine residues in the low complexity sequence I region of NS5A responsible for NS5A phosphorylation; however, the functions of specific phosphorylation sites remained obscure. Using phosphoproteomics, we identified three phosphorylation sites (serines 222, 235, and 238) in the NS5A low complexity sequence I region. Reporter virus and replicon assays using phosphorylation-ablated alanine mutants of these sites showed that Ser-235 dominated over Ser-222 and Ser-238 in HCV replication. Immunoblotting using an Ser-235 phosphorylation-specific antibody showed a time-dependent increase in Ser-235 phosphorylation that correlated with the viral replication activity. Ser-235 phosphorylated NS5A co-localized with double-stranded RNA, consistent with its role in HCV replication.

Understanding the hepatitis C virus life cycle paves the way for highly effective therapies.Nat. Med. 2013; 19: 837-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). The infection is often asymptomatic until development of severe liver diseases, including fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma, making chronic HCV infection the most common cause of liver transplant (2Thomas D.L. Global control of hepatitis C: where challenge meets opportunity.Nat. Med. 2013; 19: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). HCV is an enveloped virus with a positive, single-stranded RNA genome encoding three structural (core, E1, and E2) and seven non-structural (p7, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B) proteins (1Scheel T.K. Rice C.M. Understanding the hepatitis C virus life cycle paves the way for highly effective therapies.Nat. Med. 2013; 19: 837-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). The structural proteins together with the host membranes make up the viral particles, whereas the non-structural proteins are required for a complete life cycle. Already, there are several approved highly efficient HCV antivirals targeting non-structural proteins, including NS3/4A protease inhibitors (boceprevir, telaprevir, and simeprevir) and an NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor (sofosbuvir) (3Pawlotsky J.M. New hepatitis C therapies: the toolbox, strategies, and challenges.Gastroenterology. 2014; 146: 1176-1192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). However, their high costs prohibit their accessibility to most patients (4Hill A. Cooke G. Medicine: hepatitis C can be cured globally, but at what cost?.Science. 2014; 345: 141-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). New competitive alternatives are desirable. NS5A is a multitasking protein required for the HCV life cycle and thus a good antiviral target (5Reghellin V. Donnici L. Fenu S. Berno V. Calabrese V. Pagani M. Abrignani S. Peri F. De Francesco R.

NS5A interacts with many viral and host proteins and participates in various aspects of the viral life cycle (7Ross-Thriepland D. Harris M.

Most of the identifications centered around eight highly conserved serine residues in the LCS I region of NS5A. Among them, phosphorylation-ablated alanine mutation at Ser-229 or Ser-235 resulted in a profound reduction in the HCV genotype 2a activity (13Fridell R.A. Valera L. Qiu D. Kirk M.J. Wang C. Gao M.

Virol. 2014; 88: 7541-7555Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar); however, the alanine mutations at these two sites seemed to have different effects on the levels of NS5A hyperphosphorylation. Potentially, the above observations are due to the lack of phosphorylation site-specific antibodies that could distinguish the so-called hyperphosphorylated band (p58) of NS5A. Recently, an antibody against Ser-222 phosphorylation was developed (18Ross-Thriepland D. Harris M. Insights into the complexity and functionality of hepatitis C virus NS5A phosphorylation.J. Virol. 2014; 88: 1421-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), but the functions of Ser-222 phosphorylation remain unclear because alanine mutation at Ser-222 does not have an apparent phenotype (11Appel N. Pietschmann T. Bartenschlager R.

Moreover, whereas alanine mutation at Ser-225, Ser-229, Ser-232, and Ser-235 reduced HCV genotype 2a activity, the same mutations enhanced genotype 1b activity (11Appel N. Pietschmann T.

Hepatitis C virus NS5A: enigmatic but still promiscuous 10 years on!.J. Gen. Virol. 2015; 96: 727-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To discover HCV phosphoproteins in the conditions that resemble viral infection, we took advantage of the cell culture-derived infectious HCV system (20Wakita T. Pietschmann T. Kato T. Date T. Miyamoto M. Zhao Z. Murthy K. Habermann A. Kräusslich H.G. Mizokami M. Bartenschlager R. Liang T.J. Production of infectious hepatitis C virus in tissue culture from a cloned viral genome.Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 791-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (2409) Google Scholar) and identified three serine phosphorylation sites (Ser-222, Ser-235, and Ser-238) in the LCS I region of NS5A in the HCV (J6/JFH-1)-infected Huh7.5.1 liver cells using LC-MS/MS-based phosphoproteomics. Subsequent study using molecular virology and a phosphorylation site-specific antibody showed that Ser-235 is a CKIα phosphorylation site of NS5A responsible for enhancing genotype 2a HCV replication, probably via enhancing interaction with hVAP-A. Human hepatocarcinoma 7.5.1 cell line (Huh7.5.1) originated in Francis V. Chisari's laboratory in the Scripps Research Institute was used in most experiments (21Zhong J. Gastaminza P. Cheng G. Kapadia S. Kato T. Burton D.R. Wieland S.F. Uprichard S.L. Wakita T. Chisari F.V. Robust hepatitis C virus infection in vitro.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 9294-9299Crossref PubMed Scopus (1513) Google Scholar). The cells were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen, catalogue no. 12100-046) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Biological Industries, catalogue no. 040011B) without antibiotics. A rabbit antibody specific to Ser-235-phosphorylated NS5A was custom-made by GeneTex Corp. using a synthetic peptide (SQLpSAPSLKATC, where pS indicates phosphorylated serine). Antibodies against HCV NS5A (7B5 and 2F6) and NS3 (2E3) were obtained from BioFront Technologies. The double-stranded RNA antibody (J2-1402) was from English and Scientific Consulting Kft., the casein kinase Iα antibody (sc-6477) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., and the β-actin antibody (A5316) was from Sigma-Aldrich. The hVAP-A antibody (15275-1-AP) was from the Proteintech Group. DTT (catalogue no. 3483-12-3) and iodoacetamide (catalogue no. 144-48-9) were obtained from Thermo. Casein kinase inhibitor (D4476, catalogue no. D1944) and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (catalogue no. M2003) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. The lipid droplet was stained with BODIPY 493/503 (catalogue no. D-3922) from Life Technologies. The full HCV genome (J6/JFH-1, 5′C19Rluc2AUbi) construct and the subgenome replicon (JFH-1/SG-Neo) were kindly provided by Charles M. Rice (Rockefeller University). The replication defect replicon construct (pSGR-JFH-1) was a gift from Timothy Tellinghuisen (Scripps Research Institute). The cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter-driven NS3-NS5A expression construct was made via PCR amplification of an NS3-NS5A fragment from the full HCV genome (5′C19Rluc2AUbi) construct with the following primers: forward, 5′-AAGCTTATGGCTCCCA-3′ with a HindIII site at the 5′ end; reverse, 5′-TCTAGATCAGCAGCAC-3′ containing a stop codon and an XbaI site at the 3′ end. The NS3-NS5A fragment was first inserted into the pSTBlue-1 vector (Novagen, catalogue no. 70596). The NS3-NS5A fragment was then excised from the vector via HindIII and XbaI double digestion and ligated into the expression vector pcDNA3.1 (+) (Invitrogen, catalogue no. V790-20). The CMV-driven NS5A expression vectors were made using the Gateway system (Invitrogen). Briefly, the NS5A fragment was amplified with PCR and ligated into the entry vector using the pENTR directional TOPO cloning kits (catalog no. 2400-20). After a sequencing check, the NS5A insert was moved from the entry vector to the destination vector pcDNA-DEST40 (catalog no. 12274-015) using the Gateway LR Clonase II enzyme mix (catalog no. 11791-020). After transformation using the One Shot TOP10 chemically competent cells (catalog no. C4040-52, Invitrogen), the correct vectors were verified with DNA sequencing. Single or combinatory alanine mutations at Ser-222, Ser-235, and Ser-238 were made via site-directed mutagenesis using PCR (KOD hot start polymerase, Merck-Millipore, catalogue no. 71086-4) followed by DpnI (New England Biolabs, catalogue no. R0176L) digestion and transformation into DH5α competent cells. All plasmids were verified with DNA sequencing. Casein kinase Iα small hairpin RNA (shCSNK1A1) plasmid was obtained from the RNAi core facility at the Academia Sinica (Taipei, Taiwan). The target sequence is GCCACAGTTGTGATGGTTGTT. The control non-targeting shRNA sequence is CAAATCACAGAATCGTCGTAT. The procedures were described previously (22Rinschen M.M. Yu M.J. Wang G. Boja E.S. Hoffert J.D. Pisitkun T. Knepper M.A. Quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis reveals vasopressin V2-receptor-dependent signaling pathways in renal collecting duct cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 3882-3887Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Briefly, the Huh7.5.1 cells were infected with HCV (J6/JFH-1) for 72 h before being harvested in a lysis buffer containing 8 m urea, 75 mm NaCl, and 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0). The proteins were reduced with 10 mm DTT, alkylated with 55 mm iodoacetamide, and digested into peptides with trypsin. The tryptic peptides were then desalted using an OASIS HLB column (Waters, catalogue no. WAT094225). To enrich for phosphopeptides, strong cation exchange high performance liquid chromatography (polysulfoethyl A column, 200 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm, 200 Å, capacity: 4 mg of peptides, PolyLC) and immobilized metal affinity chromatography (Pierce IMAC spin column) were used. The conditions used for strong cation exchange were 100% solvent A (5 mm KH2PO4 in 25% acetonitrile, pH 2.6), 2 min; 86% solvent A, 14% solvent B (5 mm KH2PO4 and 500 mm KCl in 25% acetonitrile, pH 2.6), 15 min; 30% solvent A, 70% solvent B, 16 min; 100% solvent B, 11 min; 100% solvent A, 11 min. Phosphopeptide identification was performed on an LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer. Spectra were collected in a data-dependent mode with one full precursor MS1 scan in the Orbitrap followed by six-fragment MS2 scans in the LTQ. Collision-induced dissociation was done at 35% normalized energy level. Peptide peak lists were generated with the Bioworks software package (version 3.3.1, SP1 (23Eng J.K. McCormack A.L. Yates J.R. An approach to correlate tandem mass spectral data of peptides with amino acid sequences in a protein database.J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5420) Google Scholar)) using the following criteria: precursor mass range between 600 and 3500 atomic mass units, precursor tolerance 1.4 atomic mass units for grouping spectra, a total ion current of >1000 (arbitrary units)/spectrum, and a minimum of 15 peaks/spectrum. Peptide identifications were done using the Sequest search algorithm against a database containing protein sequences of Homo sapiens (34,942 entries, NCBI RefSeq) and HCV JFH1 isolate (10 entries, Uniprot Q99IB8) plus common protein contaminants: porcine (P00761) and bovine (P00760) trypsin and human keratins (P35908, Q01546, P04264, P12035, P08729, and P35527). The search parameters were as follows: precursor mass tolerance 20 ppm, product mass tolerance 1.0 atomic mass unit, 2 missed cleavages, fixed cysteine carboxyiodomethylation, variable modifications: methionine oxidation plus serine, tyrosine, and threonine phosphorylation. The target-decoy strategy based on reversed protein sequences was used to set a false discovery rate of <1% for identified peptides (24Elias J.E. Gygi S.P. Target-decoy search strategy for increased confidence in large-scale protein identifications by mass spectrometry.Nat. Methods. 2007; 4: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (2827) Google Scholar). Common contaminants were excluded. Phosphorylation site-specific identification confidence was based on the Ascore algorithm (25Beausoleil S.A. Villen J. Gerber S.A. Rush J. Gygi S.P. A probability-based approach for high-throughput protein phosphorylation analysis and site localization.Nat. Biotechnol. 2006; 24: 1285-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar). Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and resuspended in a lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.6) containing protease inhibitor (Calbiochem, catalogue no. 539134) and phosphatase inhibitor (Calbiochem, catalogue no. 524625). After centrifugation at 10,000 × g at 4 °C, the supernatant was collected and quantified using a BCA assay kit (BIOTOOLS, catalogue no. TAAR-ZBE6). 20 μg of total protein were separated on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel before being transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad, catalogue no. 162-0112). The membrane was blocked with TBS-T (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris plus 0.05% Tween 20 and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), pH 7.6) and incubated with primary antibodies followed by infrared dye-conjugated secondary antibodies (LI-COR, IRDye 680 or 800). The proteins of interest were quantified using the LI-COR Odyssey scanner and software. Monolayer cells were seeded at a subconfluent density on a coverglass inside a Petri dish. Before staining, the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min. The cells were treated with a permeabilization buffer (0.3% Triton X-100 and 0.1% BSA in PBS) for 30 min, followed by a blocking buffer (1% BSA, 0.05% saponin, and 0.2% gelatin) for 10 min three times. The cells were probed with primary antibody and then a fluorescence (Alexa 488, 568, or 594)-labeled secondary antibody (Invitrogen). The cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich, catalogue no. D9542). Immunofluorescence images were taken using a Leica SP5C spectral confocal laser-scanning microscope and software. HCV constructs were linearized with XbaI (New England Biolabs, catalogue no. R0145) digestion before being transcribed into viral RNAs using the Ambion MEGAscript T7 in vitro transcription kit (Invitrogen, catalogue no. AM1334). The viral RNA was purified using phenol/chloroform extraction and isopropyl alcohol precipitation. The quality and quantity of the RNA were assessed by gel electrophoresis and a Thermo NanoDrop spectrophotometer. Electroporation was performed using the Amaxa 4D-Nucleofector system and the Amaxa SF 4D-Nucleofector X solution kit from Lonza. Briefly, the Huh7.5.1 cells were subcultured 1–2 days before electroporation so that they reached between 80 and 90% confluence on the day of electroporation. Prior to electroporation, the cells were trypsinized, washed in PBS, and suspended in the SF solution at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml. A 100-μl aliquot of the cell suspension was mixed with 5 μg of the viral RNA and then transferred to a 100-μl cuvette for electroporation using the built-in program CM-137. The transfected cells were allowed to recover at room temperature for 10 min and then cultured in the DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. One day before the experiment, the Huh7.5.1 cells were seeded at a density so that they reached 80% confluence on the next day for transfection. The viral RNA was mixed with DMRIE-C (Invitrogen, catalogue no. 10459-014) at a ratio of 1 μg/3 μl and used to transfect the Huh7.5.1 cells. At various time points (4, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h) after transfection, the cells were lysed and subjected to luciferase assay using the luciferase assay kit (Promega, catalogue no. E1500). Active casein kinase Iα was purchased from SignalChem (catalogue no. C64-10G-10). Biotinylated synthetic peptides mapped to amino acids 216–243 of NS5A (101 peptide, biotin-RRLARGpSPPSEASSSVSQLSAPpSLRATC; 111 peptide, biotin-RRLARGpSPPSEASSSVSQLpSAPpSLRATC) were synthesized by GeneTex Corp. The active kinase was mixed with the 101 peptide on ice. ATP solution was then added to the mixture and incubated at 30 °C for 15 min prior to detection of phosphorylation using dot blotting. The Huh7.5.1 cells were infected with HCV virus (J6/JFH-1) for 72 h at a multiplicity of infection of 0.001. The infected cells were then seeded in a 6-well plate at a density of 5 × 106 cells/well for 24 h before kinase inhibition with D4476. One μl of D4476 was dissolved in 3 μl of lipid-based transfection reagent (Mirus Bio, TransIT-LT1, catalogue no. MIR 2304) plus 6 μl of serum-free DMEM before being added to the cells. The cells were incubated with the inhibitor for 24 h before immunoblotting. For small hairpin RNA-based kinase silencing, shRNA harboring lentivirus was prepared and used to infect the cells before they were harvested for RNA and protein measurements. The cells were lysed with the TRIzol LS reagent (Ambion, catalogue no. 10296-010), and the total RNA was isolated with the direct-zol RNA Mini Prep kit (ZYMO Research, catalogue no. R2052). The RNA concentrations were determined by the NanoDrop spectrophotometer. For absolute quantification, 10 ng of RNA were subjected to one-step quantitative analysis using the One-Step qRT-PCR kit (KAPA Biosystems, catalogue no. KK4660) and the StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystem). For relative quantification, 500 ng of RNA were subjected to reverse transcription using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, catalogue no. 18080-044) and 2 pm HCV gene-specific primer (5′-CACTCGCAAGCACCCTATCA-3′). qPCR was done using HCV-specific primers: sense, 5′-TCTGCGGAACCGGTGAGTA-3′; antisense, 5′-TCAGGCAGTACCACAAGGC-3′. Abundance of the 18S rRNA was used as an internal control. The primers were 5′-AAACGGCTACCACATCCAAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCTCCAATGGATCCTCGTTA-3′ (antisense). To identify phosphorylation sites of the HCV proteins, we analyzed the phosphoproteome of HCV (genotype 2a, J6/JFH-1)-infected Huh7.5.1 cells. 1,087 proteins with 1,773 phosphorylation sites were identified with high confidence (Ascore > 20; i.e. FDR < 0.01) (25Beausoleil S.A. Villen J. Gerber S.A. Rush J. Gygi S.P. A probability-based approach for high-throughput protein phosphorylation analysis and site localization.Nat. Biotechnol. 2006; 24: 1285-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 classifies the phosphorylation sites identified. Serine phosphorylation sites were the largest group, which was dominated by proline-directed sites, followed by acidophilic sites and then basophilic sites. The Phosphoproteome Database of HCV-infected Human Hepatocellular Carcinoma 7.5.1 Cells was established. NS5A was the only HCV phosphoprotein identified with three high confidence serine phosphorylation sites (Table 1, Ser-222, Ser-235, and Ser-238) in the LCS I region and conserved across major HCV strains (Fig. 2A). All three sites were identified individually in singly phosphorylated peptides (Table 1). Ser-235 and Ser-238 were identified in a doubly phosphorylated peptide. Three additional phosphorylation sites identified with lower confidence were Ser-225 (Ascore = 16.8), Ser-229 (8.6), and Ser-232 (5.1). Raw mass spectrometry data were deposited in the ProteomeXchange Consortium with the identifier PXD000988.TABLE 1Phosphopeptides identified for the HCV non-structural protein NS5APeptide sequenceMH+ChargeXcorrΔCnIonsAscoreSer-222Ser-235Ser-238GSPPSEASSSVSQLSAPSLR2,023.934.960.0941/11224.75GSPPSEASSSVSQLSAPSLR2,023.924.980.1732/5644.73GSPPSEASSSVSQLSAPSLR2,023.922.990.3122/5627.99GSPPSEASSSVSQLSAPSLR2,103.933.810.2645/14839.6345.69 Open table in a new tab To investigate roles of Ser-222, Ser-235, and Ser-238 phosphorylation sites, we made single, double, and triple mutations of the three sites to phosphorylation-ablated alanine in a full-length HCV reporter construct (Rluc-J6/JFH-1). Fig. 2B summarizes the reporter activity at various time points after the in vitro transcripts of the viral constructs were transfected into the Huh7.5.1 cells. As seen, the reporter activities of the serine-to-alanine mutants, either at Ser-222 (S222A) or Ser-238 (S238A), did not differ from that of the wild type. In contrast, the reporter activity of the S235A mutant was significantly suppressed, suggesting a crucial role of Ser-235 phosphorylation in the HCV activity. In fact, as long as Ser-235 was mutated in double or triple alanine mutation, the reporter activity remained significantly lower than that of the wild type virus (Fig. 2C), consistent with a predominant role of Ser-235 phosphorylation over Ser-222 and Ser-238 phosphorylation in the HCV"

Here, we found that deletion of ndhM caused inactivation of NDH-1-dependent cyclic electron transport around photosystem I and abolishment of CO2 uptake, resulting in a lethal phenotype under air CO2 condition. The mutation of NdhM abolished the accumulation of the hydrophilic subunits of the NDH-1, such as NdhH, NdhI, NdhJ, and NdhK, in the thylakoid membrane, resulting in disassembly of NDH-1MS and NDH-1MS′ as well as NDH-1L.

In the cytoplasm, the NDH-1 subcomplex assembly intermediates including NdhH and NdhK were seriously affected in the ΔndhM mutant but not in the NdhI-deleted mutant ΔndhI. In vitro protein interaction analysis demonstrated that NdhM interacts with NdhK, NdhH, NdhI, and NdhJ but not with other hydrophilic subunits of the NDH-1 complex.

Mutants defective in chloroplast development can display various color phenotypes including the intriguing virescence phenotype, which shows yellow/white coloration at the leaf base and greening toward the leaf tip. Through large scale genetic screens, we identified a series of new virescent mutants including virescent3-1 (vir3-1), vir4-1, and vir5-1 in Arabidopsis thaliana. We showed that VIR3 encodes a putative chloroplast metalloprotease by map-based cloning. Through site-directed mutagenesis, we showed that the conserved histidine 235 residue in the zinc binding motif HEAGH of VIR3 is indispensable for VIR3 accumulation in the chloroplast. The chloroplast localization of VIR3 was confirmed by the transient expression of VIR3-GFP in leaf protoplasts. Furthermore, taking advantage of transgenic lines expressing VIR3-FLAG, we demonstrated that VIR3 is an intrinsic thylakoid membrane protein that mainly resides in the stromal lamellae. Moreover, topology analysis using transgenic lines expressing a dual epitope-tagged VIR3 indicated that both the N and C termini of VIR3 are located in the stroma, and the catalytic domain of VIR3 is probably facing the stroma. Blue native gel analysis indicated that VIR3 is likely present as a monomer or part of a small complex in the thylakoid membrane.

https://openalex.org/W2205210167,"After significant injury, the liver must maintain homeostasis during the regenerative process. We hypothesized the existence of mechanisms to limit hepatocyte proliferation after injury to maintain metabolic and synthetic function. A screen for candidates revealed suppressor of cytokine signaling 2 (SOCS2), an inhibitor of growth hormone (GH) signaling, was strongly induced after partial hepatectomy. Using genetic deletion and administration of various factors we investigated the role of SOCS2 during liver regeneration. SOCS2 preserves liver function by restraining the first round of hepatocyte proliferation after partial hepatectomy by preventing increases in growth hormone receptor (GHR) via ubiquitination, suppressing GH pathway activity. At later times, SOCS2 enhances hepatocyte proliferation by modulating a decrease in serum insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) that allows GH release from the pituitary. SOCS2, therefore, plays a dual role in modulating the rate of hepatocyte proliferation. In particular, this is the first demonstration of an endogenous mechanism to limit hepatocyte proliferation after injury. After significant injury, the liver must maintain homeostasis during the regenerative process. We hypothesized the existence of mechanisms to limit hepatocyte proliferation after injury to maintain metabolic and synthetic function. A screen for candidates revealed suppressor of cytokine signaling 2 (SOCS2), an inhibitor of growth hormone (GH) signaling, was strongly induced after partial hepatectomy. Using genetic deletion and administration of various factors we investigated the role of SOCS2 during liver regeneration. SOCS2 preserves liver function by restraining the first round of hepatocyte proliferation after partial hepatectomy by preventing increases in growth hormone receptor (GHR) via ubiquitination, suppressing GH pathway activity. At later times, SOCS2 enhances hepatocyte proliferation by modulating a decrease in serum insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) that allows GH release from the pituitary. SOCS2, therefore, plays a dual role in modulating the rate of hepatocyte proliferation. In particular, this is the first demonstration of an endogenous mechanism to limit hepatocyte proliferation after injury."
https://openalex.org/W2247204372,"TMF/ARA160 is known to be a TATA element Modulatory Factor (TMF). It was initially identified as a DNA-binding factor and a coactivator of the Androgen receptor. It was also characterized as a Golgi-associated protein, which is essential for acrosome formation during functional sperm development. However, the molecular roles of TMF in this intricate process have not been revealed. Here, we show that during spermiogenesis, TMF undergoes a dynamic change of localization throughout the Golgi apparatus. Specifically, TMF translocates from the cis-Golgi to the trans-Golgi network and to the emerging vesicles surface, as the round spermatids develop. Notably, lack of TMF led to an abnormal spatial orientation of the Golgi and to the deviation of the trans-Golgi surface away from the nucleus of the developing round spermatids. Concomitantly, pro-acrosomal vesicles derived from the TMF-/- Golgi lacked targeting properties and did not tether to the spermatid nuclear membrane thereby failing to form the acrosome anchoring scaffold, the acroplaxome, around the cell-nucleus. Absence of TMF also perturbed the positioning of microtubules, which normally lie in proximity to the Golgi and are important for maintaining Golgi spatial orientation and dynamics and for chromatoid body formation, which is impaired in TMF-/- spermatids. In-silico evaluation combined with molecular and electron microscopic analyses revealed the presence of a microtubule interacting domain (MIT) in TMF, and confirmed the association of TMF with microtubules in spermatogenic cells. Furthermore, the MIT domain in TMF, along with microtubules integrity, are required for stable association of TMF with the Golgi apparatus. Collectively, we show here for the first time that a Golgi and microtubules associated protein is crucial for maintaining proper Golgi orientation during a cell developmental process."
https://openalex.org/W2199450037,"Heroin trafficking and consumption has increased steadily over the past decade in Tanzania, but limited information regarding HIV and drug use exists for the city of Mwanza. Our study investigates the epidemiology of drug use, and HIV risk behaviors among drug users in the northwestern city of Mwanza. Using a combination of targeted sampling and participant referral, we recruited 480 participants in Mwanza between June and August 2014. The sample was 92% male. Seventy-nine (16.4%) participants reported injecting heroin, while 434 (90.4%) reported smoking heroin. Unstable housing and cohabitation status were the only socioeconomic characteristics significantly associated with heroin injection. More than half of heroin injectors left syringes in common locations, and half reported sharing needles and syringes. Other risk behaviors such as lack of condom use during sex, and the use of illicit drugs during sex was widely reported as well. Among the study sample, there was poor awareness of health risks posed by needle/syringe sharing and drug use. Our results show that heroin use and HIV risk related behaviors are pressing problems that should not be ignored in Mwanza. Harm reduction programs are urgently needed in this population."
https://openalex.org/W2242713553,"Background We aimed to estimate the risk of ischemic stroke after intracranial hemorrhage in patients with atrial fibrillation. Materials and Methods Using discharge data from all nonfederal acute care hospitals and emergency departments in California, Florida, and New York from 2005 to 2012, we identified patients at the time of a first-recorded encounter with a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation. Ischemic stroke and intracranial hemorrhage were identified using validated diagnosis codes. Kaplan-Meier survival statistics and Cox proportional hazard analyses were used to evaluate cumulative rates of ischemic stroke and the relationship between incident intracranial hemorrhage and subsequent stroke. Results Among 2,084,735 patients with atrial fibrillation, 50,468 (2.4%) developed intracranial hemorrhage and 89,594 (4.3%) developed ischemic stroke during a mean follow-up period of 3.2 years. The 1-year cumulative rate of stroke was 8.1% (95% CI, 7.5–8.7%) after intracerebral hemorrhage, 3.9% (95% CI, 3.5–4.3%) after subdural hemorrhage, and 2.0% (95% CI, 2.0–2.1%) in those without intracranial hemorrhage. After adjustment for the CHA2DS2-VASc score, stroke risk was elevated after both intracerebral hemorrhage (hazard ratio [HR], 2.8; 95% CI, 2.6–2.9) and subdural hemorrhage (HR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.5–1.7). Cumulative 1-year rates of stroke ranged from 0.9% in those with subdural hemorrhage and a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 0, to 33.3% in those with intracerebral hemorrhage and a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 9. Conclusions In a large, heterogeneous cohort, patients with atrial fibrillation faced a substantially heightened risk of ischemic stroke after intracranial hemorrhage. The risk was most marked in those with intracerebral hemorrhage and high CHA2DS2-VASc scores."

Promyelocytic leukemia (PML) is a tumor suppressor and proapoptotic factor.

We have reported previously that PAX5-PML dominant-negatively inhibited PAX5 transcriptional activity and impaired PML function by disrupting PML nuclear bodies (NBs). Here we demonstrated the leukemogenicity of PAX5-PML by introducing it into normal mouse pro-B cells. Arrest of differentiation was observed in PAX5-PML-introduced pro-B cells, resulting in the development of acute lymphoblastic leukemia after a long latency in mice. Among the transactivation targets of PAX5, B cell linker protein (BLNK) was repressed selectively in leukemia cells, and enforced BLNK expression abrogated the differentiation block and survival induced by PAX5-PML, indicating the importance of BLNK repression for the formation of preleukemic state. We also showed that PML NBs were intact in leukemia cells and attributed this to the low expression of PAX5-PML, indicating that the disruption of PML NBs was not required for the PAX5-PML-induced onset of leukemia.

However, the oncogenicity of PAX5 mutations, including fusion genes, has yet to be demonstrated. PML is a potent growth suppressor and proapoptotic factor (14Wang Z.G. Delva L. Gaboli M. Rivi R.

In normal cells, the PML protein is localized in discrete subnuclear compartments called PML nuclear bodies (NBs) (16Ishov A.M. Sotnikov A.G. Negorev D. Vladimirova O.V. Neff N. Kamitani T. Yeh E.T.

In PML NBs, PML co-accumulates with more than 70 proteins that are involved in tumor suppression, apoptosis, regulation of gene expression, anti-viral responses, and DNA repair. PML has been suggested to exert its effects by regulating the functions of binding partners at the core of PML NBs (17Dellaire G. Bazett-Jones D.P. PML nuclear bodies: dynamic sensors of DNA damage and cellular stress.BioEssays. 2004; 26: 963-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). PML NBs have been found previously to be disrupted in human acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) by PML-RARα, an oncogenic fusion protein of PML and retinoic acid receptor (RAR) α, which is considered to be the underlying mechanism responsible for the anti-apoptotic effects of PML-RARα (18Dyck J.A.

These findings emphasize the importance of the integrity of PML NBs in tumor suppression. The fusion gene PAX5-PML has been detected in two cases of B-progenitor ALL with chromosomal translocation t(9;15)(p13;q24) (25Nebral K. König M. Harder L. Siebert R. Haas O.A. Strehl S.

We have demonstrated previously that PAX5-PML dominant-negatively inhibited PAX5 transcriptional activity in a luciferase reporter assay and suppressed the expression of PAX5 transactivation targets when expressed in a B lymphoid cell line. Furthermore, we have shown that the expression of PAX5-PML in a non-hematological tumor cell line induced the disruption of PML NBs and resistance to apoptosis and that ATO treatment induced the reconstitution of PML NBs and abrogation of apoptosis resistance. These findings suggested the possible involvement of this fusion protein in the leukemogenesis of B-ALL in a dual dominant-negative manner and the potential of ATO therapy for this type of ALL (11Kurahashi S.

These methods have been described previously (28Tsuzuki S. Seto M.

Briefly, B220+c-kit+ pro-B cells were collected from the fetal livers of 10-week-old BALB/c mice by FACS and then cultured on OP9 cells in OP9 culture medium supplemented with stem cell factor (10 ng/ml, Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ), flt3-ligand (10 ng/ml, Peprotech), interleukin 7 (10 ng/ml, Peprotech), and 2-mercaptoethanol (2 μm).

CD19-luc/pGL4 and BLNK-luc/pGL4 were used as the reporter genes for the luciferase assay. CD19-luc/pGL4 has been described previously (11Kurahashi S. Hayakawa F. Miyata Y. Yasuda T. Minami Y.

BLNK-luc/pGL4 was constructed by inserting a nucleotide fragment containing two copies of the high-affinity PAX5-binding site sequence in the BLNK promoter into the pGL4.20 vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The Renilla luciferase expression vector phRG-TK was from Promega. To investigate the leukemogenicity of PAX5-PML, we first attempted to transfect it into the hematopoietic progenitors of mice. Bone marrow cells were collected from BALB/c mice, transfected with a lentivirus vector expressing PAX5-PML and GFP, and transplanted into lethally irradiated BALB/c mice. B cells were not generated from GFP-positive cells in these mice, whereas ∼20% of GFP-positive cells expressed B220 in control mice (Fig. 1). Although the expression of PAX5-PML was expected to start at the pro-B cell stage, similar to PAX5, it appeared to begin in earlier hematopoietic progenitors in this system. We speculated that PAX5-PML prevented the development of or was toxic to lymphoid progenitors. Therefore, we established a new system to introduce PAX5-PML into pro-B cells. We transfected the bicistronic retroviral vector expressing PAX5-PML and GFP into B220+/kit+ pro B cells sorted from the fetal livers of BALB/c mice and transplanted these cells into half-lethally irradiated NOD/SCID mice. Control pro-B cells expressing GFP alone existed predominantly in the bone marrow until day 7 and differentiated into mature B cells, moved to the spleen until day 14, and then almost disappeared, possibly because of cell death, by day 21 (Fig. 2, A and C). On the other hand, PAX5-PML-introduced pro-B cells remained in the pro-B cell stage and stayed in the bone marrow for over 56 days, indicating the arrest of differentiation because of the introduction of PAX5-PML (Fig. 2, B and C).FIGURE 2.Introduction of PAX5-PML into pro-B cells caused differentiation arrest in mice. A, a B cell differentiation analysis of control cells. Bone marrow (BM) and spleen (Sp) cells were collected on the indicated days after the transplantation of pro-B cells transfected with an empty vector expressing only GFP. The expression of CD43 and B220 in cells was analyzed by FACS after gating for the GFP+, DAPI−, and lymphoid fraction (scatter). The rate of GFP+ cells in the DAPI-negative lymphoid fraction is presented at the top. Blue, green, and red squares indicated the pro-B, pre-B and immature B, and mature B cell fractions, respectively. Numbers are the rate (percent) of each fraction in GFP+ cells. B, differentiation arrest of PAX5-PML-introduced cells. Mice transplanted with pro-B cells transfected with an expression vector for PAX5-PML and GFP were analyzed as in A. C, the rate of GFP-positive cells. The averages of the GFP+ cell rates in A and B are plotted. Two mice per group were analyzed. The bar graphs are classified by color according to the rates of pro-B, pre-B and immature B, and mature B cells. Control pro-B cells differentiated into mature B cells, moved to the spleen (SP) on day 14, and disappeared until day 21, whereas PAX5-PML-introduced (P-P-introduced) pro-B cells maintained the pro-B cell phenotype and remained in the bone marrow (BM) 56 days after transplantation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) All eight mice transplanted with PAX5-PML-introduced pro-B cells died between days 63 and 158. A pathological examination revealed severe splenomegaly and a marked infiltration of leukocytes in the bone marrow and spleen (Fig. 3A). A flow cytometry analysis showed that these infiltrated leukocytes were GFP-positive and mainly had the pro-B cell phenotype (Fig. 3B), suggesting that these mice died because of ALL that developed from PAX5-PML-introduced cells. The leukemia cells obtained were transplanted serially into BALB/c mice. The mice died more rapidly with repetitions of transplantation; that is, mice that received second and third transplantations died between days 48 and 55 and between days 14 and 20, respectively (Fig. 3C). These results indicated that the introduction of PAX5-PML into pro-B cells caused ALL in mice. GFP-positive cells were collected from mice that received a fourth transplantation and then cultured with S17, a bone marrow stromal cell line, in 10% FBS and 2 μm 2-mercaptoethanol-containing DMEM. After a few repetitions to sort GFP-positive cells, the cells showed stable and exponential growth without the S17 co-culture (Fig. 4A). Cells were GFP-positive and had the pro-B cell phenotype (Fig. 4B). We designated this cell line P-PAL (PAX5-PML-induced ALL). The disruption of PML NBs by PML-RARα is known to be involved in the leukemogenesis of APL. ATO has been shown to induce apoptosis in APL cells through the reconstruction of PML NBs (see “Introduction”). We have previously demonstrated the disruption of PML NBs because of the overexpression of PAX5-PML and the reconstruction of the disrupted PML NBs by ATO in HeLa cells (11Kurahashi S. Hayakawa F. Miyata Y. Yasuda T. Minami Y. Tsuzuki S. Abe A. Naoe T. PAX5-PML acts as a dual dominant-negative form of both PAX5 and PML.Oncogene. 2011; 30: 1822-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Therefore, here we determined whether PML NBs were disrupted in PAX5-PML-induced leukemia cells. The disruption of PML NBs was not detected in PAX5-PML-induced leukemia cells (Fig. 5A) or P-PAL cells (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, ATO treatment did not significantly alter PML NBs, reduce the number of tumor cells, or improve the survival of leukemic mice (Fig. 5, A and B, and 6, A and B). These results indicated that PAX5-PML did not exert its dominant-negative effect on PML function in this system and that the inhibition of PML function was not necessary for the PAX5-PML-induced onset of leukemia. We examined the expression of PAX5-PML in P-PAL in an attempt to clarify why PAX5-PML did not disrupt PML NBs in PAX5-PML-induced leukemia cells. Although the mRNA expression of PAX5-PML was confirmed by RT-PCR (Fig. 5C), its protein expression was so weak that it could not be detected by immunoblotting using whole-cell lysates of P-PAL cells. The protein expression of PAX5-PML was confirmed by immunoblotting immunoprecipitates of the whole-cell lysate with an anti-PAX5 antibody or anti-PML antibody (Fig. 5D), indicating that PAX5-PML did not significantly disrupt PML NBs because of its weak expression in leukemia cells. PAX5 is known to have many target genes for transcriptional activation and regulates B cell differentiation. We have demonstrated previously that PAX5-PML had a dominant-negative effect on PAX5 transcriptional activity. PAX5-PML appeared to be involved in leukemogenesis through the differentiation block caused by the inhibition of PAX5 transactivity. To elucidate the mechanism underlying the differentiation block by PAX5-PML, we quantified the mRNA expression levels of PAX5 target genes such as CD19, CD79A, BLNK, and CD72 at the pro-B cell stage in PAX5-PML-induced leukemia cells. The expression of BLNK was repressed significantly in leukemia cells, whereas the repression of CD19, CD72, and CD79A was mild, suggesting the importance of BLNK repression for the differentiation block by PAX5-PML (Fig. 7A). We confirmed that BLNK protein expression was reduced in PAX5-PML-induced leukemia cells (Fig. 7B). In an attempt to determine whether this differential inhibition of PAX5 transactivity was intrinsic to PAX5-PML, we compared its DNA binding ability and inhibitory effects on transactivation by PAX5 between a CD19 promoter and BLNK promoter. No significant difference was observed in the DNA binding ability of PAX5-PML between the CD19 promoter and BLNK promoter in EMSA (Fig. 7C). Its DNA binding ability to both promoters was very weak. However, the DNA binding domain of PAX5 was maintained in PAX5-PML. These results were consistent with our previous findings and those of others (11Kurahashi S. Hayakawa F. Miyata Y. Yasuda T. Minami Y. Tsuzuki S. Abe A. Naoe T. PAX5-PML acts as a dual dominant-negative form of both PAX5 and PML.Oncogene. 2011; 30: 1822-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 31Qiu J.J. Chu H. Lu X. Jiang X. Dong S. The reduced and altered activities of PAX5 are linked to the protein-protein interaction motif (coiled-coil domain) of the PAX5-PML fusion protein in t(9;15)-associated acute lymphocytic leukemia.Oncogene. 2011; 30: 967-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and suggested that PAX5-PML had no preference of DNA binding between the two promoters. Although PAX5-PML exhibited a weak DNA binding ability, PAX5 transactivity on the BLNK promoter was inhibited dominant-negatively by PAX5-PML in the reporter gene assay, similar to that on the CD19 promoter. PAX5-PML did not show any preference of inhibition of PAX5 transactivity between the CD19 promoter and BLNK promoter (Fig. 7D). These results indicated that the selective suppression of BLNK was extrinsic to PAX5-PML. In these reporter gene assays, PAX5-PML almost completely inhibited PAX5 transactivity, even when its expression level was markedly weaker than that of PAX5 (Fig. 7D, lanes 4 and 10). Taken together with the DNA binding ability of PAX5-PML being markedly weaker than that of PAX5, these results suggested that the mechanism underlying the dominant-negative inhibition of PAX5 transactivity was not the occupation of promoters by PAX5-PML. We also determined whether the enforced expression of BLNK abrogated the differentiation block and survival to further establish the importance of BLNK repression for PAX5-PML-induced leukemia development. We transfected the bicistronic retroviral vector expressing PAX5-PML and GFP together with that expressing BLNK and hCD8 into mouse pro-B cells and transplanted them into mice. Only GFP+hCD8− cells, but not GFP+hCD8+ cells, could survive in the recipient mice on day 28 (Fig. 8A). On the other hand, control pro-B cells expressing PAX5-PML, GFP, and hCD8 but not BLNK could survive in the recipient mice, regardless of hCD8 positivity, when they expressed GFP (Fig. 8A). In addition, other control pro-B cells expressing GFP, hCD8, and BLNK but not PAX5-PML could not survive in the recipient mice (Fig. 8A). The remaining GFP+ cells in the bone marrow were mainly pro-B cells in both mouse groups transplanted with PAX5-PML-introduced pro-B cells (Fig. 8B). These results indicated that the enforced expression of BLNK abrogated the PAX5-PML-induced differentiation block and survival in mice. Although numerous types of PAX5 fusion genes have been identified to date, their oncogenicities have not yet been confirmed. Our mouse leukemia model is the first to be induced by the PAX5 fusion gene. The introduction of PAX5-PML caused a differentiation block in pro-B cells that may have been the result of the suppression of PAX5 transactivity by PAX5-PML. Our results demonstrated that the differentiation block by PAX5-PML did not require the suppression of all PAX5 target genes. The repression of CD19, CD72, and CD79A was not required for the differentiation block. In other words, the repression of BLNK was sufficient for the differentiation block caused by PAX5-PML. Abrogation of the PAX5-PML-induced differentiation block and initial survival by enforced BLNK expression further established its involvement in the formation of the preleukemic state induced by PAX5-PML (Fig. 8). BLNK is an adaptor protein that bridges B cell receptor-associated kinases with a multitude of signaling components and is essential for B cell differentiation but not proliferation. The ablation of Blnk in mice has been shown previously to cause a B cell differentiation block at the pro-B cell stage without reducing the number of bone marrow cells (32Pappu R. Cheng A.M. Li B. Gong Q. Chiu C. Griffin N. White M. Sleckman B.P. Chan A.C. Requirement for B cell linker protein (BLNK) in B cell development.Science. 1999; 286: 1949-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). On the other hand, CD79A and CD19 are known to be essential for differentiation and proliferation. CD79A is the main component of B cell receptor, the signal of which is required for the survival and differentiation of B cells. CD19 is a co-stimulatory molecule that amplifies B cell receptor signaling. Gene ablation of Cd19 and Cd79A in mice not only caused a differentiation block but also decreased the number of B cells (33Pelanda R. Braun U. Hobeika E. Nussenzweig M.C. Reth M. B cell progenitors are arrested in maturation but have intact VDJ recombination in the absence of Ig-α and Ig-β.J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 865-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 34Engel P. Zhou L.J. Ord D.C. Sato S. Koller B. Tedder T.F. Abnormal B lymphocyte development, activation, and differentiation in mice that lack or overexpress the CD19 signal transduction molecule.Immunity. 1995; 3: 39-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). These findings suggested that the escape of CD19 and CD79A from repression by PAX5-PML gave advantage to the development of leukemia by PAX5-PML and may be the reason for the selective repression of BLNK. A previous study has reported that leukemia cells of patients with PAX5-PML-positive ALL expressed CD19 and CD79A (25Nebral K. König M. Harder L. Siebert R. Haas O.A. Strehl S. Identification of PML as novel PAX5 fusion partner in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.Br. J. Haematol. 2007; 139: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), implying that escape from repression by PAX5-PML also occurred in human leukemia cells. The exact mechanism underlying selective BLNK repression has not yet been elucidated. No significant preference of the DNA binding of PAX5 was observed in the CD19 promoter and BLNK promoter, and PAX5-PML bound very weakly to both promoters (Fig. 7B). It currently remains unknown how PAX5-PML acts as dominant-negative inhibitor of PAX5 without DNA binding ability. We have demonstrated previously that PAX5-PML inhibited the transactivity of PAX5 by binding to PAX5 on the promoter (11Kurahashi S. Hayakawa F. Miyata Y. Yasuda T. Minami Y. Tsuzuki S. Abe A. Naoe T. PAX5-PML acts as a dual dominant-negative form of both PAX5 and PML.Oncogene. 2011; 30: 1822-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This model may explain the inhibition of PAX5 transactivity by PAX5-PML even when its expression was markedly lower than that of PAX5 (Fig. 7D, lanes 4 and 10) and that PAX5-PML may suppress the expression of BLNK despite its very weak expression in PAX5-PML-induced leukemia cells (Figs. 5D and 7A). No significant difference was observed in the dominant-negative effects of PAX5-PML on PAX5 transactivity between the two promoters (Fig. 7D). Therefore, the differential repression of PAX5 target genes appeared to be extrinsic to PAX5-PML. Transplanted pro-B cells usually die soon after they differentiate into mature B cells unless they are stimulated with a specific antigen, as shown in Fig. 2A. Therefore, transplanted pro-B cells remained in their recipient mice only when they succeeded in causing a differentiation block and resisted the growth-suppressive effects of PAX5-PML. Only cells that succeed in selectively suppressing BLNK may be able to pass through this selection and survive in recipient mice as preleukemia cells. Some feedback signals and/or cellular compensatory mechanisms may be involved in maintaining the expression of CD19 and CD79A. Although we demonstrated the involvement of BLNK repression in PAX5-PML-induced formation of the preleukemic state, it is not the only mechanism underlying the development of leukemia. The long latency to develop leukemia after the differentiation block by the introduction of PAX5-PML implies the requirement of additional genetic and/or epigenetic events. BLNK repression and PAX5-PML expression appear to be insufficient to induce autonomous proliferation. Target(s) of a second hit for the development of leukemia have not yet been identified. We performed microarray analyses to compare mRNA expression profiles between normal pro-B cells and PAX5-PML-induced primary leukemia cells but were unable to identify the gene expression change(s) responsible. PML exerts its function by forming PML NBs and is involved in tumor suppression and stress-induced apoptosis. PML-RARα has been suggested to contribute to the development of APL through a dominant-negative effect on RARα and the disruption of PML NBs. Therefore, PAX5-PML may also have contributed to the development of leukemia through the disruption of PML NBs. However, our results clearly demonstrated that PML NBs were not disrupted in PAX5-PML-induced leukemia cells, and this may have been due to the insufficient expression of PAX5-PML (Figs. 4D and 5A). Although we showed that PAX5-PML did not require the disruption of PML NBs for the development of leukemia in mice (Fig. 5A) and that ATO was not effective in the treatment of PAX5-PML-induced ALL (Fig. 6, A and B), these results denied neither the involvement of the disruption of PML NBs in the development of APL induced by PML-RARα nor the reconstruction of PML NBs in the mechanism of action of ATO in APL cells. It currently remains unclear whether ATO is effective for patients with PAX5-PML-positive ALL because the status of PML NBs in the leukemia cells of such patients has not yet been examined (25Nebral K. König M. Harder L. Siebert R. Haas O.A. Strehl S. Identification of PML as novel PAX5 fusion partner in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.Br. J. Haematol. 2007; 139: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In summary, here we demonstrated the leukemogenicity of PAX5-PML and partially elucidated the molecular mechanism underlying the development of leukemia. The genetic events leading to the development of leukemia during the long latency after a differentiation block need to be identified.

https://openalex.org/W2203601839,"Background Publication of clinical research findings in prominent journals influences health beliefs and medical practice, in part by engendering news coverage. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) should be most influential in guiding clinical practice. We determined whether study design of clinical research published in high-impact journals influences media coverage. Methods and Findings We compared the incidence and amount of media coverage of RCTs with that of observational studies published in the top 7 medical journals between 1 January 2013 and 31 March 2013. We specifically assessed media coverage of the most rigorous RCTs, those with >1000 participants that reported ‘hard’ outcomes. There was no difference between RCTs and observational studies in coverage by major newspapers or news agencies, or in total number of news stories generated (all P>0.63). Large RCTs reporting ‘hard’ outcomes did not generate more news coverage than small RCTs that reported surrogate outcomes and observational studies (all P>0.32). RCTs were more likely than observational studies to attract a journal editorial (70% vs 46%, P = 0.003), but less likely to be the subject of a journal press release (17% vs 50%, P<0.001). Large RCTs that reported ‘hard’ outcomes did not attract an editorial more frequently than other studies (61% vs 58%, P>0.99), nor were they more likely to be the subject of a journal press release (14% vs 38%, P = 0.14). Conclusions The design of clinical studies whose results are published in high-impact medical journals is not associated with the likelihood or amount of ensuing news coverage."
https://openalex.org/W2209329631,"Background Confusion between look-alike and sound-alike (LASA) medication names (such as mercaptamine and mercaptopurine) accounts for up to one in four medication errors, threatening patient safety. Error reduction strategies include computerized physician order entry interventions, and ‘Tall Man’ lettering. The purpose of this study is to explore the medication name designation process, to elucidate properties that may prime the risk of confusion. Methods and Findings We analysed the formal and semantic properties of 7,987 International Non-proprietary Names (INNs), in relation to naming guidelines of the World Health Organization (WHO) INN programme, and have identified potential for errors. We explored: their linguistic properties, the underlying taxonomy of stems to indicate pharmacological interrelationships, and similarities between INNs. We used Microsoft Excel for analysis, including calculation of Levenshtein edit distance (LED). Compliance with WHO naming guidelines was inconsistent. Since the 1970s there has been a trend towards compliance in formal properties, such as word length, but longer names published in the 1950s and 1960s are still in use. The stems used to show pharmacological interrelationships are not spelled consistently and the guidelines do not impose an unequivocal order on them, making the meanings of INNs difficult to understand. Pairs of INNs sharing a stem (appropriately or not) often have high levels of similarity (<5 LED), and thus have greater potential for confusion. Conclusions We have revealed a tension between WHO guidelines stipulating use of stems to denote meaning, and the aim of reducing similarities in nomenclature. To mitigate this tension and reduce the risk of confusion, the stem system should be made clear and well ordered, so as to avoid compounding the risk of confusion at the clinical level. The interplay between the different WHO INN naming principles should be further examined, to better understand their implications for the problem of LASA errors."
https://openalex.org/W2276408502,"Streptococcus pyogenes chromosomal island M1 (SpyCIM1) integrates by site-specific recombination into the 5’ end of DNA mismatch repair (MMR) gene mutL in strain SF370SmR, blocking transcription of it and the downstream operon genes. During exponential growth, SpyCIM1 excises from the chromosome and replicates as an episome, restoring mutL transcription. This process is reversed in stationary phase with SpyCIM1 re-integrating into mutL, returning the cells to a mutator phenotype. Here we show that elimination of SpyCIM1 relieves this mutator phenotype. The downstream MMR operon genes, multidrug efflux pump lmrP, Holliday junction resolution helicase ruvA, and DNA base excision repair glycosylase tag, are also restored to constitutive expression by elimination of SpyCIM1. The presence of SpyCIM1 alters global transcription patterns in SF370SmR. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) demonstrated that loss of SpyCIM1 in the SpyCIM1 deletion mutant, CEM1Δ4, impacted the expression of over 100 genes involved in virulence and metabolism both in early exponential phase, when the SpyCIM1 is episomal, as well as at the onset of stationary phase, when SpyCIM1 has reintegrated into mutL. Among these changes, the up-regulation of the genes for the antiphagocytic M protein (emm1), streptolysin O (slo), capsule operon (hasABC), and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin (speB), are particularly notable. The expression pattern of the MMR operon confirmed our earlier observations that these genes are transcribed in early exponential phase but silenced as stationary phase is approached. Thus, the direct role of SpyCIM1 in causing the mutator phenotype is confirmed, and further, its influence upon the biology of S. pyogenes was found to impact multiple genes in addition to the MMR operon, which is a novel function for a mobile genetic element. We suggest that such chromosomal islands are a remarkable evolutionary adaptation to promote the survival of its S. pyogenes host cell in changing environments."

Using a systematic process, the Important Bird and Biodiversity Area (IBA) network was designed to highlight areas of conservation significance for birds (i.e. IBA trigger species), and more recently general biodiversity. Land use activities that take place in IBAs are diverse, including consumptive and non-consumptive activities. Avitourism in Australia, generally a non-consumptive activity, is reliant on the IBA network and the birds IBAs aim to protect. However, companies tend not to mention IBAs in their marketing. Furthermore, avitourism, like other nature-based tourism has the potential to be both a threatening process as well as a conservation tool. We aimed to assess the current use of IBAs among Australian-based avitour companies' marketing, giving some indication of which IBAs are visited by avitourists on organised tours. We reviewed online avitour itineraries, recorded sites featuring in descriptions of avitours and which IBA trigger species are used to sell those tours. Of the 209 avitours reviewed, Queensland is the most featured state (n = 59 tours), and 73% feature at least one IBA. Daintree (n = 22) and Bruny Island (n = 17) IBAs are the most popular, nationally. Trigger species represent 34% (n = 254 out of 747) of species used in avitour descriptions. The most popular trigger species' are wetland species including; Brolga (n = 37), Black-necked Stork (n = 30) and Magpie Goose (n = 27). Opportunities exist to increase collaboration between avitour companies and IBA stakeholders. Our results can provide guidance for managing sustainability of the avitourism industry at sites that feature heavily in avitour descriptions and enhance potential cooperation between avitour companies, IBA stakeholders and bird conservation organisations."

The loudness dependence of auditory evoked potential (LDAEP) is known to reflect central serotonergic activity. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 5-HT3A serotonin receptor gene are associated with psychiatric disorders. This study aimed to investigate the effect between 5-HT3A receptor gene polymorphisms and childhood sexual trauma on the LDAEP as an electrophysiological marker in healthy subjects.A total of 206 healthy subjects were recruited and evaluated using the childhood trauma questionnaire (CTQ) and hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS). Peak-to-peak N1/P2 was measured at five stimulus intensities, and the LDAEP was calculated as the linear-regression slope. In addition, the rs1062613 SNPs of 5-HT3A (CC, CT, and TT) were analyzed in healthy subjects.There was a significant interaction between scores on the CTQ-sexual abuse subscale and 5-HT3A genotype on the LDAEP. Subjects with the CC polymorphism had a significantly higher LDEAP than T carriers in the sexually abused group. In addition, CC genotype subjects in the sexually abused group showed a significantly higher LDAEP compared with CC genotype subjects in the non-sexually abused group.Our findings suggest that people with the CC polymorphism of the 5-HT3A gene have a greater risk of developing mental health problems if they have experienced childhood sexual abuse, possibly due to low central serotonin activity. Conversely, the T polymorphism may be protective against any central serotonergic changes following childhood sexual trauma."
https://openalex.org/W2276323021,"Continuous parathyroid hormone (PTH) blocks its own osteogenic actions in marrow stromal cell cultures by inducing Cox2 and receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL) in the osteoblastic lineage cells, which then cause the hematopoietic lineage cells to secrete an inhibitor of PTH-stimulated osteoblast differentiation. To identify this inhibitor, we used bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) and primary osteoblasts (POBs) from WT and Cox2 knock-out (KO) mice. Conditioned medium (CM) from RANKL-treated WT, but not KO, BMMs blocked PTH-stimulated cAMP production in POBs. Inhibition was reversed by pertussis toxin (PTX), which blocks Gαi/o activation. Saa3 was the most highly differentially expressed gene in a microarray comparison of RANKL-treated WT versus Cox2 KO BMMs, and RANKL induced Saa3 protein secretion only from WT BMMs. CM from RANKL-stimulated BMMs with Saa3 knockdown did not inhibit PTH-stimulated responses in POBs. SAA added to POBs inhibited PTH-stimulated cAMP responses, which was reversed by PTX. Selective agonists and antagonists of formyl peptide receptor 2 (Fpr2) suggested that Fpr2 mediated the inhibitory actions of Saa3 on osteoblasts. In BMMs committed to become osteoclasts by RANKL treatment, Saa3 expression peaked prior to appearance of multinucleated cells. Flow sorting of WT marrow revealed that Saa3 was secreted only from the RANKL-stimulated B220(-) CD3(-)CD11b(-/low) CD115(+) preosteoclast population. We conclude that Saa3 secretion from preosteoclasts, induced by RANKL in a Cox2-dependent manner, inhibits PTH-stimulated cAMP signaling and osteoblast differentiation via Gαi/o signaling. The induction of Saa3 by PTH may explain the suppression of bone formation when PTH is applied continuously and may be a new therapeutic target for osteoporosis."
https://openalex.org/W2212251844,"Macropinosomes arise from the closure of plasma membrane ruffles to bring about the non-selective uptake of nutrients and solutes into cells. The morphological changes underlying ruffle formation and macropinosome biogenesis are driven by actin cytoskeleton rearrangements under the control of the Rho GTPase Rac1. We showed previously that Rac1 is activated by diacylglycerol kinase ζ (DGKζ), which phosphorylates diacylglycerol to yield phosphatidic acid. Here, we show DGKζ is required for optimal macropinocytosis induced by growth factor stimulation of mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Time-lapse imaging of live cells and quantitative analysis revealed DGKζ was associated with membrane ruffles and nascent macropinosomes. Macropinocytosis was attenuated in DGKζ-null cells, as determined by live imaging and vaccinia virus uptake experiments. Moreover, macropinosomes that did form in DGKζ-null cells were smaller than those found in wild type cells. Rescue of this defect required DGKζ catalytic activity, consistent with it also being required for Rac1 activation. A constitutively membrane bound DGKζ mutant substantially increased the size of macropinosomes and potentiated the effect of a constitutively active Rac1 mutant on macropinocytosis. Collectively, our results suggest DGKζ functions in concert with Rac1 to regulate macropinocytosis."

Germline genetic polymorphisms might also affect cancer risk and clinical outcomes. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays an important role in vasculogenesis and angiogenesis, but the combined effect of these factors on RCC remains unclear. In this study, we explored the association between the VEGF-A -2578C>A, -1498T>C, -1154G>A, -634G>C, and +936C>T gene polymorphisms and RCC. We also evaluated the combined effects of the VEGF-A haplotypes and urinary total arsenic levels on the prognosis of RCC. This case-control study was conducted with 191 RCC patients who were diagnosed with renal tumors on the basis of image-guided biopsy or surgical resections. An additional 376 age- and gender-matched controls were recruited. Concentrations of urinary arsenic species were determined by a high performance liquid chromatography-linked hydride generator and atomic absorption spectrometry. Genotyping was investigated using fluorescent-based TaqMan allelic discrimination. We observed no significant associations between VEGF-A haplotypes and RCC risk. However, the VEGF-A ACGG haplotype from VEGF-A -2578, -1498, -1154, and -634 was significantly associated with an increased recurrence of RCC (OR = 3.34, 95% CI = 1.03–10.91). Urinary total arsenic level was significantly associated with the risk of RCC in a dose-response manner, but it was not related to the recurrence of RCC. The combination of high urinary total arsenic level and VEGF-A risk haplotypes affected the OR of RCC recurrence in a dose-response manner. This is the first study to show that joint effect of high urinary total arsenic and VEGF-A risk haplotypes may influence the risk of RCC recurrence in humans who live in an area without obvious arsenic exposure."
https://openalex.org/W2275365536,"OXA-58 is a class D β-lactamase from the multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. We determined the crystal structure of OXA-58 in a novel crystal, and revealed the structure of the substrate-binding cleft in a closed state, distinct from a previously reported OXA-58 crystal structure with the binding cleft in an open state. In the closed state, the movement of three loops (α3–α4, β6–β7, and β8–α10) forms an arch-like architecture over the binding cleft through interaction between the Phe113 residues of α3–α4 and Met225 of β6–β7. This structure suggests the involvement of these flexible loops in OXA-58 substrate binding. In contrast to the mobile loops, the Ω-loop appeared static, including the conserved loop residues and their hydrogen bonds; the pivotal residue Trp169 within the Ω-loop, ζ-carbamic acid of the modified base catalyst residue Lys86, and nucleophilic residue Ser83. The stability of OXA-58 was enhanced concomitant with an increase in the hydrolytic activity catalyzed by NaHCO3-dependent ζ-carbamic acid formation, with an EC50 of 0.34 mM. The W169A mutant enzyme was significantly thermally unstable even in the presence of 100 mM NaHCO3, whereas the S83A mutant was stabilized with NaHCO3-dependent activation. The ζ-carbamic acid was shown to increase not only OXA-58 hydrolytic activity but also OXA-58 stability through the formation of a hydrogen bond network connected to the Ω-loop with Ser83 and Trp169. Thus, the static Ω-loop is important for OXA-58 stability, whereas the mobile loops of the substrate-binding cleft form the basis for accommodation of the various substituents of β-lactam backbone."
https://openalex.org/W2282871852,"The high degree of intra-tumor heterogeneity has meant that it is important to develop sensitive and selective assays to detect low-abundance KRAS mutations in metastatic colorectal carcinoma (mCRC) patients. As a major potential source of tumor DNA in the aforementioned genotyping assays, it was necessary to conduct an analysis on both the quality and quantity of DNA extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE). Therefore, four commercial FFPE DNA extraction kits were initially compared with respect to their ability to facilitate extraction of amplifiable DNA. The results showed that TrimGen kits showed the greatest performance in relation to the quality and quantity of extracted FFPE DNA solutions. Using DNA extracted by TrimGen kits as a template for tumor genotyping, a real-time wild-type blocking PCR (WTB-PCR) assay was subsequently developed to detect the aforementioned KRAS mutations in mCRC patients. The results showed that WTB-PCR facilitated the detection of mutated alleles at a ratio of 1:10,000 (i.e. 0.01%) wild-type alleles. When the assay was subsequently used to test 49 mCRC patients, the results showed that the mutation detection levels of the WTB-PCR assay (61.8%; 30/49) were significantly higher than that of traditional PCR (38.8%; 19/49). Following the use of the real-time WTB-PCR assay, the ΔCq method was used to quantitatively analyze the mutation levels associated with KRAS in each FFPE sample. The results showed that the mutant levels ranged from 53.74 to 0.12% in the patients analyzed. In conclusion, the current real-time WTB-PCR is a rapid, simple, and low-cost method that permits the detection of trace amounts of the mutated KRAS gene."
https://openalex.org/W2290673728,"The emergence of multidrug-resistant viruses compromises the efficacy of anti-human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) therapy and limits treatment options. Therefore, new targets that can be used to develop novel antiviral agents need to be identified. We previously identified a potential parent compound, hematoxylin, which suppresses the nuclear import of HIV-1 via the Vpr-importin α interaction and inhibits HIV-1 replication in a Vpr-dependent manner by blocking nuclear import of the pre-integration complex. However, it was unstable. Here, we synthesized a stable derivative of hematoxylin that bound specifically and stably to Vpr and inhibited HIV-1 replication in macrophages. Furthermore, like hematoxylin, the derivative inhibited nuclear import of Vpr in an in vitro nuclear import assay, but had no effect on Vpr-induced G2/M phase cell cycle arrest or caspase activity. Interestingly, this derivative bound strongly to amino acid residues 54-74 within the C-terminal α-helical domain (αH3) of Vpr. These residues are highly conserved among different HIV strains, indicating that this region is a potential target for drug-resistant HIV-1 infection. Thus, we succeeded in developing a stable hematoxylin derivative that bound directly to Vpr, suggesting that specific inhibitors of the interaction between cells and viral accessory proteins may provide a new strategy for the treatment of HIV-1 infection."
https://openalex.org/W2221300115,"The Lower Carboniferous (Visean) Granton Lagerstätte (Edinburgh, Scotland) is principally known for the discovery of the conodont animal, but has also yielded numerous crustaceans and other faunas. Here we report on small branching colonies, reaching 10 mm in length. They are small, erect, arborescent, and irregularly branched with predominant monopodial and dichotomous growth. They bud in a single plane. In one specimen the wall microstructure is well preserved and it is composed of evenly spaced, linear fibers, running parallel to the axis of the stems, and connected by transverse bars. We discuss possible biological affinities of these organisms; we consider algal, poriferan, hydrozoan and bryozoan affinities. The general pattern of branching, presence of fan-like structures (interpreted here as possible gonophores) and microstructure suggests affinity to Hydrozoa, affinity to non-calcifying algae is less likely. Assuming hydrozoan nature; the microstructure might suggest affinities with the extant family Solanderiidae Marshall, 1892 that possess an internal chitinous skeleton. The EDS analysis shows that fossils discussed here are preserved as phosphates. The skeletons were probably not mineralized, the presence of phosphorus suggests that the colonies were originally composed of chitin. We describe these organisms as Caledonicratis caridum gen. et sp. nov. (Solanderiidae?, Capitata?). Colonies of C. caridum gen et. sp. nov. sometimes encrust the exuviae of crustaceans, which very probably lived in fresh to brackish water thus indicating a likely habitat of Caledonicratis."
https://openalex.org/W2282946060,"To assess whether the x-ray attenuation of intra-arterial obstruction measured on non-contrast CT in ischemic stroke can predict response to thrombolysis and subsequent functional outcome.The Third International Stroke Trial (IST-3) was a multicenter randomized-controlled trial of intravenous thrombolysis (rt-PA) given within six hours of ischemic stroke. Ethical approval and informed consent were obtained. In a subgroup of 109 IST-3 patients (38 men, median age 82 years), a single reader, masked to all clinical and other imaging data, manually measured x-ray attenuation (Hounsfield Units, HU) on non-contrast CT at the location of angiographically-proven intra-arterial obstructions, pre-randomization and at 24-48 hour follow-up. We calculated change in attenuation between scans. We assessed the impact of pre-randomization arterial obstruction attenuation on six-month functional outcome.Most arterial obstructions (64/109, 59%) were hyperattenuating (mean 51.0 HU). Compared with control, treatment with rt-PA was associated with a greater, but non-significant, reduction in obstruction attenuation at follow-up (-8.0 HU versus -1.4 HU in patients allocated control, p = 0.117). In multivariable ordinal regression analysis controlled for patient age, stroke severity, location and extent of obstruction, time from stroke onset to baseline scan and rt-PA treatment allocation, the attenuation of pre-randomization arterial obstruction was not independently associated with six-month outcome (odds ratio = 0.99, 95% confidence interval = 0.94-1.03, p = 0.516).In ischemic stroke, the x-ray attenuation of the arterial obstruction may decline more rapidly from baseline to 24-48 hours following treatment with thrombolysis but we found no evidence that baseline arterial obstruction attenuation predicts six-month outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2203554222,"Pea crabs, Dissodactylus primitivus, inhabit multiple echinoid (heart urchin) hosts. Male and female crabs move among hosts in search for mates, and both sexes mate multiple times, creating opportunities for post-copulatory sexual selection. For such selection to occur, only a fraction of the males who succeed in mating can also succeed in siring progeny. Jossart et al. 2014 used 4 microsatellite loci to document parentage and mating frequencies of both sexes in D. primitivus. From these data we identified the mean and variance in female offspring numbers, as well as the proportions of the female population that were gravid and not bearing offspring. We next identified the proportions of the male population who had (1) mated and sired offspring, (2) mated but failed to sire offspring, and (3) failed to mate altogether. We used these results to estimate the opportunity for selection on males and females in terms of mate numbers and offspring numbers, and estimated the sex difference in the opportunity for selection (i.e., the opportunity for sexual selection) using both forms of data. We then partitioned the total variance in male fitness into pre- and post-copulatory components and identified the fraction of the total opportunity for selection occurring in each context. Our results show that the opportunity for selection on each sex was of similar magnitude (0.69-0.98), consistent with this polyandrogynous mating system. We also found that 37% of the total opportunity for sexual selection on males occurred within the context of post-copulatory sexual selection. However, the fraction of the total opportunity for selection that was due to sexual selection, estimated using both mate numbers and offspring numbers, was 9% and 23% respectively. Thus, we further reduced our estimate of the opportunity for post-copulatory sexual selection in D. primitivus to less than 10% of the total opportunity for selection (0.37 of 0.09 and 0.23 = 0.03 and 0.09). Our results provide the first estimate of the maximum possible strength of post-copulatory sexual selection in crustaceans using this approach."
