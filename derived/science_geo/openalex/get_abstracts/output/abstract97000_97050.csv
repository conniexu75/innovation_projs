https://openalex.org/W1974951723,"Inescapable foot shock in rats caused profound analgesia that was antagonized by naloxone or dexamethasone when shock was delivered intermittently for 30 minutes, but not when it was delivered continuously for 3 minutes. Thus, depending only on its temporal characteristics, foot-shock stress appears to activate opioid or nonopioid analgesia mechanisms. Certain forms of stress may act as natural inputs to an endogenous opiate analgesia system."
https://openalex.org/W2000841514,"Mice produce litters containing many pups, and the female fetuses that develop between male fetuses have significantly higher concentrations of the male sex steroid testosterone in both their blood and amniotic fluid than do females that develop between other female fetuses. These two types of females differ during later life in many sexually related characteristics. Thus, individual variation in sexual characteristics of adult female mice may be traceable to differential exposure to testosterone during prenatal development because of intrauterine proximity to male fetuses."
https://openalex.org/W1988756344,"Moderate chronic malnutrition has only a minor effect on fecundity (reproductive capacity), and the resulting effect on fertility (actural reproduction) is very small. Among the fecundity components examined here in noncontracepting populations, age at menarche and the duration of lactational amenorrhea appear to be the ones most affected by malnutrition. But from neither of those effects can a difference in fertility of more than a few percent be expected between poorly and well-nourished women in developing countries."
https://openalex.org/W1999075947,An experimental and theoretical investigation is made into the range and nature of the exposure of the nonsmoking public to respirable suspended particulates from cigarette smoke. A model incorporating both physical and sociological parameters is shown to be useful in understanding particulate levels from cigarette smoke in indoor environments. Observed levels of particulates correlate with the predictions of the model. It is shown that nonsmokers are exposed to significant air pollution burdens from indoor smoking. An assessment of the public health policy implications of these burdens is presented.
https://openalex.org/W2028296722,"When either taste or odor alone was followed by poison, rats acquired a strong aversion for the taste but not for odor, especially if poison was delayed. When odor-taste combinations were poisoned, however, odor aversions were potentiated, as if odor could gain the enduring memorial property of taste by associative contiguity."

https://openalex.org/W2002767706,"The connections between the spinal cord and lower leg muscles of the rat are significantly altered by repair of the intervening sciatric nerve. Muscles supplied by the peroneal branch of the sciatic are innervated by fewer motoneurons after sciatic repair. Many of these neurons originally innervated the peroneal muscles, and others formerly served the antagonistic tibial muscles. Perikarya in the size range of alpha motoneurons regained peripheral connections with greater frequency than those in the gamma range. There are thus postoperative defects in the extent and specificity of alpha reinnervation as well as in the degree of gamma control."
https://openalex.org/W1514385072,"The mechanism of Na+-dependent D-glucose transport was investigated by kinetic means in rabbit small intestinal and renal brush border membranes. The rate of glucose transport was measured under equilibrium exchange conditions as a function of its own concentration and of the Na+ concentration. Likewise, the rate of Na+ transport was measured as a function of the D-glucose concentration. Noteworthy characteristics of the Na+-dependent glucose transport system are: 1) linear dependence of the glucose transport rate on Na+ concentration up to 0.1 M (at constant ionic strength), indicating a 1:1 stoichiometry of Na+-D-glucose cotransport under net flux conditions; 2) virtual Na+ independence of the apparent affinity of the transport system for D-glucose; 3) a stimulation-inhibition pattern if the transport rate of either substrate (D-glucose, Na+) is measured as function of increasing concentrations of its co-substrate; 4) a varying flux ratio of D-glucose to Na+ which can be either above or below 1, depending on the concentration ratio of the two substrates; 5) a rate constant for translocation of the loaded carrier which is faster than that for the dissociation of Na+. Treating Na+-D glucose co-transport analogous to an enzyme reaction, these features are consistent with an iso-ordered-bi-bi kinetic model, whereby the first solute that binds to the transport system at one membrane interface is the one that is released first at the other interface (first-in-first-out characteristics). The kinetic model is explained by a gated pore mechanism, whereby the translocation of the transported solutes across the permeability barrier is achieved by a rocker-type conformational change of the transport system (presumed to be a protein) which moves the permeability barrier past the solutes."

Analysis of a reaction mixture of therapeutic concentrations of hydralazine with labeled thymidine reveals at least four labeled products. At higher concentrations, hydralazine reacts with labeled deoxycytidine to form at least three labeled products. Formation of these products is markedly enhanced by exposure to ultraviolet light. The reaction of hydralazine with thymidine and deoxycytidine may be in part responsible for initiating drug-induced systemic lupus erythematosus."

https://openalex.org/W1516129867,"Coproporphyrinogen oxidase (EC 1.3.3.3), which converts coproporphyrinogen III into protoporphyrinogen IX, was purified about 3,200-fold from bovine liver. The most purified preparation had a specific activity of 6,920 units/mg of protein, the highest value so far reported, and was homogeneous in the polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme was monomeric and its molecular weight was approximately 71,600. The purified enzyme was analyzed for the amino acid composition and shown to have an abundance of aromatic amino acid residues amounting to 12% of the total residues. Spectral examination did not reveal the presence of heme and flavin. No metals were detected by atomic absorption spectroscopy either. Sulfhydryl reagents, metals, and metal chelators did not affect the enzyme activity to any significant extent. On the contrary, the purified enzyme was activated by crude phospholipid extracts from liver mitochondria and commercially available phospholipids about 2- to 5-fold. An increase in Vmax by the phospholipid extract as well as phosphatidylethanolamine accompanied a decrease in Km for coproporphyrinogen III from 48 microM to 18 to 25 microM. Synthetic nonionic detergents also exhibited an activation effect, although ionic detergents diminished the activity."

https://openalex.org/W1989962844,"The patterns of the occurrence of breast cancer in 11 high-risk families were evaluated by segregation and linkage analysis. These patterns were consistent with the hypothesis that increased susceptibility to breast cancer was inherited as an autosomal dominant allele with high penetrance in women. The postulated susceptibility allele in these families may be chromosomally linked to the glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (E.C. 2.6.1.2, alanine aminotransferase) locus. Confirmation of this linkage in other families would establish the existence of a gene increasing susceptibility to breast cancer. Since there is no association in the general population between a woman's glutamate-pyruvate transaminase genotype and her cancer risk, the glutamate-pyruvate transaminase linkage cannot be used as a screening test for breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1565696662,"Natural abundance 13C NMR spectroscopy (at 67.9 MHz) is used to study an aqueous solution of the antifreeze glycoproteins 3 to 6 from the Antarctic cod. Assignments of resonances to specific carbons of the known Ala-Ala-[beta Gal-(1 leads to 3)-alpha-N-acetylgalactosamine]Thr repeating unit are presented. Some of the carbons of the proline residues of glycoprotein 6 are also identified. Spin-lattice relaxation times (at 30 degrees C), linewidths (at 35 degrees C), nuclear Overhauser enhancements (at 35 degrees C), and the temperature dependence of chemical shifts (from 0 degrees to 75 degrees C) all strongly suggest that these antifreeze glycoproteins are predominantly or entirely flexible random coil polymers."
https://openalex.org/W2025623695,"Phenobarbital administration to pregnant rats from day 12 to day 19 of gestation suppressed body weight gain and produced significant effects on reproductive function in their offspring. These effects included delays in the onset of puberty, disorders in the estrous cycle, and infertility. Moreover, the animals exposed to phenobarbital in utero showed altered concentrations of sex steroids, gonadotrophic hormones, and estrogen receptors. These findings suggest that phenobarbital treatment during prenatal development can produce permanent alterations in sexual maturation."
https://openalex.org/W2097948863,"Slices from various organs and tissues of 14-day-old chick embryos synthesize a novel class of glycoproteins containing sulfated oligosaccharide chains that are not released from the polypeptides under conditions that cleave O-glycosidically linked chains. Of the tissues examined, embryonic lung and liver were the most active in incorporating [35S]O4 into these oligosaccharide chains, which were analyzed as glycopeptides following Pronase digestion. These low molecular weight sulfated glycopeptides were resistant to several chemical and enzymatic treatments that degrade a variety of high molecular weight sulfated glycosaminoglycans. The incorporation of both [3H]glucosamine and [35S]O4 into the glycopeptides was inhibited by tunicamycin, an antibiotic which inhibits the N-glycosylation of proteins. These observations, coupled with the finding that these chains were resistant to beta elimination, suggest that this novel type of sulfated oligosaccharide is N-glycosidically linked to protein. The sulfated glycopeptides from chick embryonic lung were characterized as containing terminal fucose and sialic acid residues as well as O-sulfated N-acetylglucosamine residues. Comparable studies with slices of adult liver and lung indicated that they were far less active in the synthesis of this class of sulfated glycopeptides, even though these organs, like those from the embryo, actively synthesize sulfated glycosaminoglycans."

https://openalex.org/W1483332080,"Human bronchial glycoproteins from a patient suffering from chronic bronchitis were subjected to alkaline borohydride degradation and a heterogeneous mixture of reduced oligosaccharides and glycopeptides was obtained. The shortest neutral oligosaccharides were subsequently fractionated by DAX4 anion exchange chromatography into 12 fractions. Five major oligosaccharides were purified by preparative paper chromatography. Their structures were determined by using periodic oxidation, methylation analysis, gas liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and enzymatic degradation. Two oligosaccharides and three trisaccharides were characterized as galactose (Gal) beta 1 leads to 3 N-acetylgalactosaminitol (GalNActitol), N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) beta 1 leads to 3 GalNActitol, Gal 1 leads to 4 GlcNAc 1 leads to 3 GalNActitol, GlcNAc 1 leads to 3 Gal 1 leads to 3 GalNActitol and fucose alpha 1 leads to 2 Gal beta 1 leads to 3 GalNActitol."
https://openalex.org/W1579643632,"Abstract Incubation of rat red cells with liposomes containing radioactive glucosylceramide, together with unlabeled phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol, produced cells labeled with the glycolipid. Part of the bound could be removed by further incubation with unlabeled liposomes. Both processes, uptake and release, were stimulated by adding a preparation obtained from bovine spleen. The active material was purified partially by ammonium sulfate precipitation and gel permeation with a Sephadex G-75 column. The latter step indicated a molecular weight of about 22,000. The material lost much of its activity when treated with trypsin or N-ethylmaleimide, indicating that it is a protein. The cerebroside uptake was quite stable if stored in dithioerythritol at 4 degrees C. Tests with liposomes containing labeled phosphatidylcholine or cholesterol showed that the red cells took up these lipids as well, but the transfer protein exerted little effect on this. Ghosts prepared from rat red cells also took up the three lipids from the liposomes and here, as well, the uptake protein showed high specificity in facilitating the uptake of cerebroside. This appears to be the first demonstration of the existence of a glycolipid transfer protein. Possible physiological roles for the uptake protein in red cell metabolism and in the modulation of the glycosphingolipid composition of cell membranes are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2003383329,"The coagulant activity of partially purified and delipidated tissue factor (TF) (coagulation Factor III) has previously been recovered by dialysis of the apoprotein after addition of mixed brain lipids and deoxycholate. Inclusion of cadmium chloride in the relipidation mixture greatly increases the recovered activity of highly purified TF from human placenta by promoting incorporation of TF into phospholipid vesicles; TF that had not been incorporated into vesicles showed no coagulant activity. Thus, TF must be present in a lipid bilayer for expression of coagulant activity. In vitro, cadmium induces fusion of lipid vesicles and may contribute to the incorporation of proteins in membranes."
https://openalex.org/W2056647167,"Electromyographic studies of brachiation in the gibbon controvert deductions, based on dissection, about the purported functions of muscle chains in the hylobatid forelimb. Neither force conduction distally along the components of the chains nor simultaneity of muscular contraction occurs in brachiation. Rather, the unique structure of the forelimb is probably the result of evolved changes in the short head of biceps brachii to enhance its role as a forearm flexor."
https://openalex.org/W2043627567,"Intracavitary calcium phosphate deposits were observed in smooth, elastomeric blood pump sacs implanted in male calves for periods of 115 to 166 days. These deposits occurred predominantly on the flexing surface of the sacs. In contrast, similar pump sacs remained generally free of mineral deposits for up to 150 days in calves treated with the anticoagulant warfarin-sodium. These results implicate a vitamin K-dependent process in calcium phosphate deposition on elastomeric sacs."

https://openalex.org/W142075626,"Four fluorescent compounds present in solvent extracts of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens could serve as electron donors for the biohydrogenation of cis-9,trans-11-octadecadienoate in the presence of dithionite, which was itself inactive. One of the compounds was identified as alpha-tocopherolquinol and another as alpha-tocopherolquinone. A partially purified soluble enzyme preparation from B. fibrisolvens catalyzed the reduction of alpha-tocopherolquinone to alpha-tocopherolquinol in the presence of NADH with a stoichiometry of 1:1. The ratio of alpha-tocopherolquinone produced to fatty acid reduced was 2:1 when the tocopherol derivatives were extracted aerobically. When the extraction was carried out anaerobically, the ratio was 1. It is suggested that the oxidation of 2 molecules of alpha-tocopherolquinol, each to the semiquinone, provides the electrons required for the reduction of the cis-bond of the conjugated dienoic fatty acid. Although alpha-tocopherol, phylloquinol, and reduced menadione are inactive, ubiquinol-4, ubiquinol-10, and trimethylhydroquinone show about one-half the activity of alpha-tocopherolquinol. Plastoquinol and trimethylphytylbenzoquinol are as active as alpha-tocopherolquinol."
https://openalex.org/W2048576110,"Primary scientific literature seems not to be growing at a greater rate than the scientific community it serves. The impression of excessive proliferation arises mainly from the differentiation of journals to accomodate rapid expansion in specialized fields of research.

The direction in which objects appear to move, like their color and depth, can thus depend on a synthesis of unperceived components."
https://openalex.org/W1976557439,Magnitude estimation experiments show that perceived contrast for both sine and square waves is a linear function of stimulus contrast.

These findings imply a high degree of linearity in suprathreshold visual processing of contrast.
https://openalex.org/W2094975367,"Kittens were reared so that each eye received normal patterned vision on alternate days. If the eyes received equal periods of stimulation, the visual fields were normal. If one eye received much more experience than the other, the field of the less experienced eye was restricted to the temporal hemifield. This change, which differs from that observed when one or both eyes are deprived continuously of patterned input, suggests that an imbalance in the duration of stimulation can influence the outcome of the normal competitive interaction between pathways from the two eyes and can cause a selective suppression of a portion of the input from the less experienced eye. This suppression may involve the ipsilateral retino-geniculo-cortical pathways or it may involve the entire cortical pathway from the less experienced eye, leaving the colliculus to control responses to visual targets."

However, virtually all such animals (six out of seven) survived indefinitely if kept at an ambient temperature of 15 degrees C for 2 hours before and 10 to 12 hours after the lesions were made. Although these rats appeared otherwise healthy, they could not maintain normal both temperatures in short-term cold tests. In contrast, five of the nine rats kept at 25 degrees C died within 10 hours after the operation, and three more died within 5 days. Rats kept at 25 degrees C had a much higher incidence of cardiac arrhythmias than did rats kept at 15 degrees C, which may be responsible for their higher moratlity rates."
https://openalex.org/W2441485328,"2Two types of protein kinase inhibitors present in rat liver nuclei have been partially purified and characterized. They are specific for the nuclear enzymes, being inert toward the protein kinases in the cytosol. One inhibitor is a 150,000 dalton, heat-labile, acidic protein; the other is a family of two oligonucleotides. Inhibitory activity in crude extracts becomes measurable only after complete removal of protein kinase activity by affinity chromatography (Farron-Furstenthal, F., and Lightholder, J.R. (1977) FEBS Lett. 84, 313). Initial separation of the inhibitor protein from the oligonucleotide inhibitors was achieved by filtration through an Amicon pressure cell. Further purification of the inhibitor protein was obtained by chromatography on ion exchangers and Bio-Gel. The oligonucleotides were purified by DEAE-cellulose chromatography and paper electrophoresis. The effects of the two types of inhibitors are additive. The 170 to 200% recovery of protein kinase activity after removal of the inhibitors from the initial extracts suggests that the inhibitors contribute in a quantitatively significant measure to the regulation of nuclear protein phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W86092939,"Cycloheximide, frequently used as an inhibitor of protein synthesis in vivo and in vitro, has been found to cause a significant reduction of the synthesis of digitonin-precipitable sterols from acetate, but not from mevalonate, at a concentration of 1 mM in the 10,000 x g supernatant fraction of rat liver homogenate preparations. The results of studies of the metabolism of labeled leucine under the same conditions indicated that the effect of cycloheximide on sterol synthesis from acetate was not related to an effect of cycloheximide on protein synthesis. Preincubation of the 10,000 x g supernatant fraction of rat liver homogenates with cycloheximide (1 mM) caused a significant reduction in the levels of acetate thiokinase and hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase activities but not of acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase activity. Preincubation of the 100,000 x g supernatant fraction of rat liver homogenates with cycloheximide (1 mM or 0.3 mM) also caused a significant reduction of the levels of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase activity. When cycloheximide (1 mM) was preincubated with the 100,000 x g supernatant fraction, a reduction in the level of acetate thiokinase activity was observed. Preincubation of rat liver microsomes with cycloheximide (1 mM and 3 mM) had no effect on the level of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase activity. These results suggest that biological effects observed upon exposure of cells or tissues to high concentrations of cycloheximide may not be exclusively due to effects of the cycloheximide on the synthesis of protein."

It was previously shown by Lundgren and Hankins ((Lundgren, D.W, and Hankins, J. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 7130-7133) that slices of rat liver readily synthesized 2-pyrrolidone from putrescine. The unknown metabolite was partially purified by methanol/chloroform extraction, activated charcoal column chromatography, and two-dimensional thin layer chromatography on silica gel plates. The 2-pyrrolidone metabolite was derivatized with bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluroacetamide and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The mass of the molecular ion (245) and fragment ions suggests that the 2-pyrrolidone metabolite is 5-hydroxy-2-pyrrolidone. The mass spectrum of synthetic 5-hydroxy-2-pyrrolidone was identical to that of the unknown metabolite. Synthetic 5-hydroxy-2-[3H]pyrrolidone co-chromatographed on silica gel sheets with the unknown 2-[14C]pyrrolidone metabolite obtained directly from incubation media. Under appropriate conditions (pH 7.5, no acid treatment of medium), putrescine is metabolized to 5-hydroxy-2-pyrrolidone via 2-pyrrolidone. Several effector compounds, but not necessarily the same ones, inhibit or enhance, or both, the conversion of putrescine to 2-pyrrolidone and of 2-pyrrolidone to 5-hydroxy-2-pyrrolidone. This is the first demonstration of the biosynthesis of 5-hydroxy-2-pyrrolidone."
