https://openalex.org/W1558962636,"Mononuclear leukocytes preferentially accumulate in the central nervous system (CNS) during the course of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). To address factors that govern leukocyte trafficking in EAE, we monitored expression of mRNAs encoding IP-10 and JE/MCP-1, which are members of a family of chemoattractant cytokines. A transient burst of IP-10 and JE/MCP-1 mRNA accumulation in the CNS occurred, in close relation to the onset of histologic and clinical disease. In situ hybridizations showed, unexpectedly, that astrocytes were the major source of mRNAs encoding IP-10 and JE/MCP-1. These observations implicate astrocyte-derived cytokines as potential chemoattractants for inflammatory cells during EAE."
https://openalex.org/W2165639777,"Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I, which was cocrystallized with duplex DNA, positioned 11 base pairs of DNA in a groove that lies at right angles to the cleft that contains the polymerase active site and is adjacent to the 3′ to 5′ exonuclease domain. When the fragment bound DNA, a region previously referred to as the ""disordered domain"" became more ordered and moved along with two helices toward the 3′ to 5′ exonuclease domain to form the binding groove. A single-stranded, 3′ extension of three nucleotides bound to the 3′ to 5′ exonuclease active site. Although this cocrystal structure appears to be an editing complex, it suggests that the primer strand approaches the catalytic site of the polymerase from the direction of the 3′ to 5′ exonuclease domain and that the duplex DNA product may bend to enter the cleft that contains the polymerase catalytic site."
https://openalex.org/W1889871926,"A cDNA has been cloned from rabbit brain that is a new member of the emerging family of Na(+)-dependent plasma membrane transporters for several neurotransmitters and structurally related compounds. Functional expression of this cDNA in COS-7 cells identifies its product as a Na(+)- and Cl(-)-dependent creatine transporter with a Km of approximately 35 microM. Its creatine transporter activity is efficiently antagonized by 3-guanidinopropionate, a well characterized alternative substrate of creatine transport in several tissues, and by 4-guanidinobutyrate. More distant structural analogues of creatine are much less efficient or inactive as antagonists, indicating a high substrate specificity of the transporter. Northern blot hybridization detects the expression of its mRNA in most tissues tested, most prominently in kidney, heart, and muscle, but not in liver and intestine. A full-length cDNA clone was also isolated from a muscle cDNA library and found to contain the same coding sequence. Substrate affinity and specificity of the cloned transporter are very similar to the endogenous creatine transporter of the COS-7 cells and to the creatine transport activities of several cell types described in the literature. Moreover, its mRNA is most abundant in the tissues known to possess high creatine uptake capacity."
https://openalex.org/W1901926248,"Cells exposed to oxidative stress have been shown previously to exhibit both protein oxidation and increased proteolysis. Experiments conducted with purified proteins in vitro have indicated that oxidatively modified proteins may be selectively degraded by intracellular proteases, but a definitive cause-and-effect relationship has not been demonstrated previously in intact cells. Several investigators have proposed that oxidatively modified proteins are selectively degraded within cells, but the possibility that oxidants may activate intracellular proteases (directly or indirectly) to catalyze the indiscriminate degradation of undamaged proteins has not been discounted. Armed with the knowledge that dityrosine is a specific product of protein oxidation, we undertook a series of experiments to test the hypothesis that oxidized proteins undergo selective intracellular degradation. Our results demonstrate that dityrosine is produced in the hemoglobin molecule when red blood cells are exposed to a continuous flux of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The dityrosine so produced is only released from the hemoglobin by proteolysis and is stable to prolonged incubation with cell extracts. Inhibitors of proteolysis have no effect on dityrosine production but do effectively prevent dityrosine release. Proteasome (the 670-kDa multicatalytic proteinase complex, that we have previously called macroxyproteinase or MOP (Pacifici, R. E., Salo, D. C., and Davies, K. J. A. (1989) Free Radical Biol. & Med. 7, 521-526; Salo, D. C., Pacifici, R. E., Lin, S. W., Giulivi, C., and Davies, K. J. A. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 11919-11927; Pacifici, R. E., and Davies, K. J. A. (1991) Gerontology 37, 166-180) appears responsible for dityrosine release during the selective degradation of oxidatively modified proteins in red blood cells and red cell extracts. We conclude that the elevated rates of proteolysis observed in response to oxidative stress do, indeed, reflect selective degradation of oxidatively modified (damaged) proteins. Despite a relatively low production rate, dityrosine has a high fluorometric quantum yield and is, of course, a specific product of protein oxidation. As an apparently stable metabolic end product, dityrosine may prove to be an extremely valuable (cellular or urinary) marker or index of organismal oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2082178421,"A fundamental problem in the identification and isolation of tumor suppressor and other growth-inhibiting genes is the loss of power of genetic complementation at the subchromosomal level. A direct genetic strategy was developed to isolate subchromosomal transferable fragments (STFs) from any chromosome, each containing a selectable marker within the human DNA, that could be transferred to any mammalian cell. As a test of the method, several overlapping STFs from 11p15 were shown to cause in vitro growth arrest of rhabdomyosarcoma cells. This activity mapped between the β-globin and insulin genes."
https://openalex.org/W1542332509,"To assess directly the functional role of the integrin VLA-3 (alpha 3 beta 1), we transfected human alpha 3 cDNA into erythroleukemia (K562) cells and rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells. The resulting transfectants (KA3 and RA3) expressed alpha 3 beta 1 on the cell surface as confirmed using a panel of nine anti-alpha 3 monoclonal antibodies. Neither of the transfected cells exhibited increased adhesion to the extracellular matrix proteins fibronectin, laminin, and collagen. However, the KA3 transfectants did bind strongly to the extracellular matrix deposited by epidermal and carcinoma cell lines, allowing the cells to attach and spread. Binding to this cell-deposited ligand, probably containing epiligrin/kalinin, was specific to VLA-3 and could be inhibited by anti-alpha 3 antibodies and by EDTA, but not by RGD peptides. In marked contrast to other integrins (VLA-2 and VLA-4), VLA-3 showed high constitutive activity in K562 cells, but was minimally active in RD cells. Also contrasting with other beta 1 integrins, VLA-3 was minimally stimulated by the anti-beta 1 monoclonal antibody TS/216 under normal conditions. VLA-3-mediated adhesive function was well supported by either Mg2+ or Mn2+, but was almost completely abolished by the presence of 1 mM Ca2+. Surprisingly, this negative Ca2+ effect was completely overcome by the addition of the stimulatory anti-beta 1 monoclonal antibody TS2/16. Together, these results point to markedly distinct regulation for VLA-3 function compared to other beta 1 integrins. Also, all anti-VLA-3 antibodies were able to induce temperature-dependent homotypic cell aggregation of KA3 cells, but not K562 cells. However, this aggregation did not appear to be directly mediated by VLA-3 since it was not inhibited by EDTA. In addition, no enhancement of heterotypic cell-cell adhesion was observed in alpha 3-transfected cells."
https://openalex.org/W2135628348,"The endothelin (ET) family of peptides acts via two subtypes of G-protein-coupled heptahelical receptors termed ETA and ETB, which have distinct rank orders of affinity to endothelin receptor agonists and antagonists. To delineate which portions of the receptor molecules determine ligand selectivity, we have constructed a series of chimeras between human ETA and ETB receptors and characterized the chimeric receptors expressed in heterologous cell lines by competitive radioligand binding analysis and by measuring agonist-induced transients of intracellular Ca2+. We demonstrate that the binding determinant for the ETB-selective agonists ET-3, BQ3020, and IRL1620 residues within the region spanning the putative transmembrane helices IV-VI and the adjacent loop regions. In contrast, the transmembrane helices I, II, III, and VII plus the intervening loop regions specify the selectivity for BQ123, an ETA-selective antagonist. BQ123 exhibited no detectable agonistic activity in all wild-type and chimeric receptors tested. A chimeric receptor that has the transmembrane helices IV-VI (and adjacent loops) from the ETB receptor inserted into the remaining regions from the ETA receptor binds both the ETA- and ETB-selective ligands with high affinities. Moreover, BQ123 competitively inhibits the binding of the amino-terminally truncated ETB agonists, 125I-BQ3020 and 125I-IRL1620, to this chimeric receptor, suggesting that BQ123 is a mimic of the carboxyl-terminal linear portion of endothelins. These findings indicate that there are at least two separable ligand interaction subdomains within the endothelin receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1601798272,"The myristoylated protein-tyrosine kinase, p56lck, is expressed predominantly in T cells where it is believed to play a role in T cell activation. We observed a 56-kDa protein that became metabolically labeled in intact T lymphoid cells that were incubated with either [3H]myristate or [3H]palmitate. This protein was identified as p56lck based on its specific immunoprecipitation with polyclonal antisera to p56lck, by induction of a shift in its electrophoretic mobility following treatment of cells with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and by co-chromatography with p56lck on protamine-agarose. Characterization of the two acylation events revealed that, in contrast to the p56lck-associated radioactivity from [3H]myristate-labeled cells, the p56lck-associated radioactivity from [3H]palmitate-labeled cells was susceptible to cleavage by neutral hydroxylamine and was not blocked by inhibitors of protein synthesis. Pulse-chase analyses revealed that the labeling of p56lck with [3H]palmitate, but not [3H]myristate, was reversible. The presence of covalently attached palmitate on p56lck from [3H]palmitate-labeled cells was verified by thin-layer chromatography following acid hydrolysis of the acylated protein. 2-Hydroxymyristate, which is metabolically activated to form a potent inhibitor of protein myristoylation, specifically inhibited the acylation of p56lck with [3H]myristate without affecting its labeling with [3H]palmitate. These studies indicate that p56lck is both a cotranslationally myristoylated and post-translationally palmitoylated protein."
https://openalex.org/W87058663,"We here report that human lung fibroblasts respond to x-ray treatment (XRT) with release of interleukin (IL)-6. Synthesis of IL-6 upon ionizing radiation is preceded by an increase of IL-6 transcript levels resulting from transcriptional activation of the IL-6 gene. Analysis of deleted fragments of the IL-6 promoter indicated that transcriptional activation of the IL-6 promoter was due to enhanced binding activity of the transcription factor nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B. Although AP-1 did not participate in the rapid induction of the IL-6 promoter, its binding activity was also enhanced by XRT. In contrast to binding kinetics observed with NF-kappa B, AP-1 binding following XRT was biphasic with the second peak being dependent on de novo protein synthesis. In contrast, however, NF-IL-6 activity was not enhanced by XRT in fibroblasts. The introduction of both the NF-kappa B- and the AP-1 recognition sequence conferred inducibility by XRT to a heterologous promoter, with reporter gene activity being maximal 24 or 48 h following XRT, respectively. Sequential activation of two distinct transcription factors might thus contribute to synchronize transcriptional activation of different genes participating in the x-ray response."
https://openalex.org/W1529178114,"The predominant mechanism by which insulin activates glucose transport in muscle and adipose tissue is by affecting the redistribution of the facilitated hexose carriers, GLUT1 and GLUT4, from an intracellular site to the plasma membrane. A quantitative analysis of this process has been hampered by the lack of reliable determinations for kinetic constants catalyzed by each of these isoforms. In order to obtain such information, each transporter was expressed in Xenopus oocytes by the injection of mRNA encoding rat GLUT1 or GLUT4. Equilibrium exchange 3-O-methylglucose uptake was measured and the data fitted to a two-compartment model, yielding Km = 26.2 mM and Vmax = 3.5 nmol/min/cell for GLUT1 and Km = 4.3 mM and Vmax = 0.7 nmol/min/cell for GLUT4. Measurement of the abundance of cell surface transporters was accomplished by two independent protocols: photolabeling with the impermeant hexose analog 2-N-4-(1-azi-2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)benzoyl-1,3-bis(D-mannos-4 -yloxy)-2-propylamine and subcellular fractionation of oocytes. Data obtained by either technique revealed that the ratio of plasma membrane GLUT1 to GLUT4 was about 4; this paralleled the relative maximal velocities for hexose transport, indicating that the turn-over numbers for the two isoforms were the same. Moreover, measurement of the concentration of exofacially disposed transporters with 2-N-4-(1-azi-2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)benzoyl-1,3-bis(D-mannos-4 -yloxy)-2-propylamine allowed calculation of the turnover number to be about 20,000 min-1. These data indicate that, at low substrate concentrations, the catalytic efficiency of GLUT4 is significantly greater than GLUT1. Extrapolation to mammalian systems suggests that GLUT4 is responsible for virtually all of the hexose uptake in insulin-responsive targets, particularly in the presence of hormone."
https://openalex.org/W1603628987,"The present study characterizes the transport of nontransferrin (non-Tf) iron by K562 cells. Accumulation of radiolabel by cells incubated with 55Fe-nitrilotriacetate (NTA) is a saturable process that is time and temperature dependent (Ea approximately 20 kcal/mol). Initial rate analysis of iron influx yields values of Vmax = 855 fmol/min/10(6) cells and apparent Km = 0.54 microM. NHCL4 and chloroquine, agents that block cellular acquisition of iron from Tf, do not interfere with assimilation from FeNTA, demonstrating that uptake is truly independent of the Tf-mediated pathway. Furthermore, the inactivation of this transport mechanism by limited proteolytic digestion on ice indicates that specific cell surface proteins are involved. The extent of radiolabel incorporation into heme and ferritin is the same regardless of whether K562 cells acquire iron from 55FeNTA via the cell surface mechanism or from 55Fe-Tf via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Unlike other Tf-independent iron transport pathways that have been described, the K562 cell transport mechanism is not inhibited by divalent cations such as Ni2+, Co2+, or Mn2+. Uptake from 55FeNTA can be blocked by Cu2+ but at concentrations > 1500-fold molar excess. However, Cd2+ is a fairly specific inhibitor of 55Fe uptake by K562 cells (IC50 approximately 50 microM). Additionally, the K562 cell transport mechanism is not Ca2+ dependent and does not appear to be regulated by extracellular iron salts, in contrast to features noted for non-Tf iron uptake by fibroblasts (Sturrock, A., Alexander, J., Lamb, J., Craven, C. M., and Kaplan, J. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 3139-3145; Kaplan, J., Jordan, I., and Sturrock, A. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 2997-3004). These unique characteristics of the K562 cell uptake mechanism suggest that multiple transport systems function in Tf-independent iron assimilation."
https://openalex.org/W1586727171,"Factor IX is synthesized as a precursor polypeptide which requires proteolytic cleavage of the propeptide for functional activity. Expression of factor IX at high levels in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells results in the secretion of a mixture of profactor IX and mature factor IX. We have studied whether the processing of profactor IX may be mediated by the recently discovered subtilisin-like serine proteases PACE/furin and/or PACE4. Co-transfection of a PACE expression vector with a profactor IX expression vector resulted in the secretion of fully processed factor IX. In contrast, co-transfection of a PACE4 expression vector with a profactor IX expression vector did not increase processing of profactor IX to the mature form. A factor IX Arg-to-Thr mutation at the P1 position (residue 39) destroyed the ability for PACE to process profactor IX. Amino-terminal sequence analysis demonstrated that processing mediated by PACE occurred at the authentic site within profactor IX. The specificity of profactor IX processing by PACE was also evaluated by transfection of a vector encoding the serine protease inhibitor alpha 1-antitrypsin. Expression of wild-type alpha 1-antitrypsin, which does not inhibit PACE, did not influence processing of profactor IX mediated by co-expression of PACE. In contrast, the alpha 1-antitrypsin Pittsburgh mutant, which inhibits PACE, inhibited profactor IX processing activity mediated by transfected PACE as well as the endogenous CHO cell propeptide processing enzyme. Pulse-chase labeling indicated that PACE processed profactor IX late within the secretory pathway, although a secreted soluble mutant PACE was also capable of processing profactor IX in the conditioned medium. The results implicate PACE as a candidate for the enzyme that processes profactor IX in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2012196020,"The migration of postmitotic neurons away from compact, germinal zones is a critical step in neuronal differentiation in the developing brain. To study the molecular signals necessary for cerebellar granule cell migration in situ, precursor cells from the neurological mutant mouse weaver, an animal with phenotypic defects in migration, were implanted into the external germinal layer (EGL) of wild-type cerebellar cortex. In this region, labeled weaver precursor cells of the EGL progressed through all stages of granule neuron differentiation, including the extension of parallel fibers, migration through the molecular and Purkinje cell layers, positioning in the internal granule cell layer, and extension of dendrites. Thus, the weaver gene acts nonautonomously in vivo, and local cell interactions may induce early steps in neuronal differentiation that are required for granule cell migration."
https://openalex.org/W1506403129,"A membrane-associated sn-1,2(2,3)-diacylglycerol transacylase activity was purified 550-fold from the microsomes of rat intestinal villus cells. The enzyme was solubilized with the zwitterionic detergent 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate and was isolated and purified by sequential chromatography on hydroxylapatite, an anion exchanger, Affi-Gel heparin and Cibacron blue A-agarose. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed two major closely migrating polypeptides of apparent molecular mass of 50 and 52 kDa. Incubation of the isolated enzyme with sn-1,2(2,3)dioleoyl-[2-3H]glycerol yielded trioleoyl[2-3H]glycerol and 2-oleoyl[2-3H]glycerol. The synthesis of triacylglycerols was independent of acyl-CoA, as indicated by the absence of incorporation of radioactivity from [1-14C]oleoyl-CoA into mono-, di-, or triacylglycerols under these conditions. The transacylase did not hydrolyze triacylglycerols readily and was not affected by the acyltransferase inhibitors, N-ethylmaleimide and 4,4‘-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2‘-disulfonate, while the lipase/hydrolase inhibitors NaF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and diethyl p-nitrophenyl phosphate caused partial inactivation. The enzyme was specific toward 1(3)-positions of rac 1,2-diacylglycerols but did not utilize the -1,3-diacylglycerols or other neutral lipid esters effectively and was not capable of removing fatty acids from phosphatidylcholine or of transfer of fatty acids from X (unspecified enantiomer)-1,2-diacylglycerol to lysophosphatidylcholine. Since the diacylglycerol transacylation did not lead to accumulation of either sn-1,2- or sn-2,3-diacylglycerols during incubation with the racemates, it is concluded that both sn-1,2- and sn-2,3-s are utilized at similar rates."
https://openalex.org/W1486819379,"Binding to heparan sulfate governs many aspects of the physiological action and regulation of the lipolytic enzyme, lipoprotein lipase (LPL). In an attempt to identify the structural determinants which mediate this interaction, basic residues in three segments of the primary sequence of human LPL (residues 147-151, 279-282, and 292-304) were replaced with alanine, either singly or in various combinations, and variant proteins were subjected to affinity chromatography on heparin-Superose. Five basic residues in two distinct segments of the primary sequence were critical determinants of the high affinity for heparin manifested by the active enzyme (R279, K280, R282, K296, R297). By contrast, no such evidence could be detected for basic residues in the first cluster (K147, K148) or for other basic residues in the third cluster (K292, R294, K304), while the evidence for K300 was unresolved. The conformation of this heparin-binding domain can be inferred by reference to the three-dimensional structure of the homologous enzyme, pancreatic lipase (Winkler, F. K., D'Arcy, A., and Hunziker, W. (1990) Nature 343, 771-774). Affinity of the active enzyme for heparin could not be reduced below a threshold, suggesting that other heparin-binding determinants exist elsewhere in the molecule, as supported by recently published evidence (Davis, R. C., Wong, H., Nikazy, J., Wang, K., Han, Q., and Schotz, M. C. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 21499-21504)."
https://openalex.org/W1597584564,"Type IV collagen has recently emerged as a family composed of five known chains (alpha 1-alpha 5), each of which contains a carboxyl-terminal noncollagenous domain (NC1) of approximately 230 amino acids. The NC1 domain of the alpha 3(IV) chain is the probable target for autoantibodies in patients with Goodpasture syndrome (GP), as evidenced from studies employing bovine type IV collagen. In the present experiments, the specificity of GP antibodies for the five NC1 domains of human type IV collagen was determined by using recombinant NC1 domains as the antigen. cDNAs encoding each NC1 domain were expressed in E. coli as fusion proteins with a 6-histidine amino-terminal leader. The recombinant NC1 monomers r alpha 1(IV), r alpha 2(IV), r alpha 3(IV), r alpha 4(IV), and r alpha 5(IV) were purified by affinity chromatography to the fusion protein using a nickel resin column, and then characterized by electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis using chain-specific peptide antibodies. The specificity of GP antibodies from four patients to these recombinant proteins was then further evaluated by immunoblot analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay measurements. The GP antibodies reacted strongly with the r alpha 3(IV) NC1 domain but were not reactive when tested against the other four recombinant monomers. In contrast, neither antisera from patients with two other forms of autoimmune disease (anti-tubular basement membrane disease and Wegener's syndrome) nor normal control sera bound to any of the recombinant NC1 moieties. These results unambiguously establish that GP antibodies are specifically targeted to the NC1 domain of the alpha 3(IV) chain of human type IV collagen. The findings also establish a methodology for large scale preparation of r alpha 3(IV) NC1 domain for use in diagnostic tests and development of therapeutic procedures and offer a strategy for the elucidation of a more complete GP epitope by site-directed mutagenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1606799581,"Stimulation of mouse lacrimal acinar cells with submaximal concentrations of the muscarinic agonist, methacholine, resulted in an increase in intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i), which took the form of sinusoidal oscillations. These oscillations were relatively constant (approximately 4-5/min) regardless of the methacholine concentration, suggesting that the oscillations arise from an oscillating negative feedback in the signal transduction pathway. This negative feedback appears to involve oscillations in protein kinase C activity because the oscillations were prevented by activation, inhibition, or down-regulation of protein C. Activation of protein kinase C with phorbol esters inhibited the methacholine-induced [Ca2+]i signal and formation of the Ca2+ mobilizing messenger, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. [Ca2+]i signals elicited by intracellular introduction of inositol phosphates did not oscillate and were not affected by activators or inhibitors of protein kinase C. Thus, the constant frequency [Ca2+]i oscillations appear to result from a negative feedback loop involving inhibition of inositol trisphosphate production by protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W1690546964,"We have reinvestigated nucleotide binding to actin in order to resolve conflicts regarding the mechanism of nucleotide dissociation and exchange. We present evidence that supports a mechanism for nucleotide binding to actin in which the tightly bound divalent cation (Ca2+ or Mg2+) directly interacts with the bound nucleotide. The dissociation rates of ATP or ADP from actin are limited by the dissociation of the high affinity divalent cation from actin and vary inversely with free Ca2+ or free Mg2+ concentration. The divalent cation concentration range over which attenuation of the ATP dissociation takes place is about 100-fold greater for Mg2+ than that for Ca2+ due to the much slower association rate constant for Mg2+ compared with Ca2+. The relative affinity for ATP versus ADP is 200:1 for Ca-actin in 100 microM free [Ca2+], and 4:1 for Mg-actin in 100 microM free [Mg2+]. Actin without a tightly bound divalent cation has about a 3-fold greater affinity for ATP than ADP. At constant free divalent cation concentration, the rate of nucleotide exchange on actin is described by competitive binding kinetics."
https://openalex.org/W1539308941,"The carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain of the human poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) exhibits sequence homology with the NAD(P)(+)-dependent leucine and glutamate dehydrogenases. To clarify the role played by some conserved residues between PARP and NAD(P)(+)-dependent dehydrogenases, point mutations were introduced into the whole enzyme context. Non-conservative mutations of Lys-893 (K893I) and Asp-993 (D993A) completely inactivate human PARP, whereas conservative and nonconservative mutations of Asp-914 (D914E and D914A, respectively) and Lys-953 (K953R and K953I, respectively) partially alter PARP activity. The consequences of conservative substitution of Lys-893 and Asp-993 on the kinetic properties of human poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase enzyme and the polymer it synthesizes suggest that these 2 amino acids are directly involved in the covalent attachment of the first ADP-ribosyl residue from NAD+ onto the acceptor amino acid. In addition, the recent resolution of the three-dimensional structure of the NAD(+)-linked glutamate dehydrogenase from Clostridium symbiosum (Baker, P.J., Britton, K.L., Engel, P.C., Farrants, G.W., Lilley, K.S., Rice, D.W., and Stillman, T.J.

https://openalex.org/W1512983489,"The effect of human activated protein C (APC) on tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)-induced fibrinolysis was studied in cell free plasma and in a system of purified components. Clots were produced by adding plasma or a solution of fibrinogen and plasminogen to the wells of a microtiter plate containing small separated aliquots of Ca2+, thrombin, and tPA, plus and minus APC. Initial clotting and subsequent fibrinolysis were monitored continuously by turbidity. The lysis time of dialyzed normal human plasma (NHP) was longer than that of dialyzed barium citrate-adsorbed plasma (BAP). APC had no effect on the lysis time of BAP but shortened the lysis time of NHP to that of BAP. Two fractions were produced from material eluted from the barium citrate pellet by precipitation of selective components with polyethylene glycol 8000 (PEG). One fraction comprised materials which precipitated at 5% PEG (5% PF) and the other materials which precipitated between 5 and 40% PEG (5-40% PF). Both fractions together, but neither alone, prolonged the lysis time of BAP, an effect which could be reversed by APC. Fractionation of the 5% PF showed that the component with the required activity has properties of the procoagulant surface and can be replaced with vesicles of phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylserine (PCPS). In addition, the 5-40% PF can be replaced with either the combination of purified coagulation Factors II, IX, and X or Factor II plus the prothrombin activator Factor Xa. When Factor Xa was used as the activator in BAP plus PSPC vesicles, a dose-dependent saturable increase in lysis time was observed with a half-maximal increase occurring at 32 pM Factor Xa. This effect was eliminated by APC. In a system of purified components comprising PCPS vesicles, Factors V and II, protein S, plasminogen and fibrinogen; the prothrombin activators Factor Xa and ecarin both induced a prolongation of the lysis time. APC prevented prolongation by Factor Xa but not by ecarin. The time courses of the generation of thrombin and plasmin during fibrinolysis of clots produced from systems of purified components in the presence and absence of APC, and with Factor Xa as the prothrombin activator, were determined by standardized activity assays using chromogenic substrates. In the absence of APC the lysis time was 145 min, and prothrombin was quantitatively converted to thrombin. In the presence of APC, however, the lysis time was reduced to 100 min with no evidence for the activation of prothrombin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1540037942,"NIMA is the protein product of the nimA gene of the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans, required for progression of cells from G2 into mitosis. The protein kinase activity of NIMA, assayed by phosphorylation of beta-casein, varies during the nuclear division cycle, reaching a maximum in late G2 and M. To investigate the biochemical properties of this cell cycle-regulated protein kinase, we have expressed nimA cDNA that encodes full-length NIMA in Escherichia coli as a fusion product with glutathione S-transferase. Purified NIMA phosphorylated beta-casein, with a Km of 38 microM and Vmax of 156 nmol/min/mg. NIMA also demonstrated a Km of 69 microM for ATP. Both recombinant and cellular NIMA kinases behaved as oligomers on gel filtration chromatography, and their kinase activities were strongly inhibited by various salts. By using both protein and peptide substrates, NIMA demonstrated a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase activity. Cellular NIMA exists as a phosphoprotein, and bacterially expressed NIMA was also phosphorylated on multiple serine/threonine residues. Some of these phosphorylations appeared essential for NIMA activity as the enzyme could be dephosphorylated and inactivated in vitro by protein serine/threonine phosphatases. Use of a kinase-negative mutant of NIMA revealed that the NIMA enzyme undergoes autophosphorylation when expressed at high concentrations in bacteria. Taken together, these data suggest that cellular mechanisms may exist to regulate the phosphorylation state and activity of the NIMA protein kinase during the nuclear division cycle in A. nidulans."
https://openalex.org/W1550185278,"A slow, tight-binding inhibitor of thrombin with an apparent molecular mass of about 5 kDa has been isolated from Haemadipsa sylvestris, an Indian leech of the family of Haemadipsidae. The inhibitory activity, called haemadin, is thrombin specific since it does not inhibit other proteases like trypsin, chymotrypsin, factor Xa, or plasmin. NH2-terminal amino acid sequence analysis (residues 1-45) does not reveal any homology to known serine protease inhibitors, including the thrombin-specific inhibitor hirudin. The haemadin cDNA cloned by polymerase chain reaction techniques codes for a polypeptide of 57 amino acid residues preceded by 20 residues of a signal peptide sequence. A synthetic gene coding for the mature haemadin was expressed in Escherichia coli. Recombinant haemadin displays a similar inhibition constant and specific activity as its natural counterpart.

To evaluate the requirement for p56lck in the development of T cells that have gamma delta TCRs, which generally do not express CD4 or CD8, p56lck mutant mice were bred with TCR gamma delta transgenic mice. Few peripheral cells that carried the transgenes could be detected in p56lck-/- mice, although 70 percent of thymocytes were transgenic. Development of transgenic gamma delta+ thymocytes was blocked at an early stage, defined by interleukin-2 receptor alpha expression. However, extrathymic development of CD8 alpha alpha+ TCR gamma delta+ intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes appeared to be normal. Thus, p56lck is crucial for the thymic, but not intestinal, maturation of gamma delta T cells and may function in thymic development independently of CD4 or CD8."
https://openalex.org/W1516430535,"Lipoprotein(a) levels in the plasma are strongly correlated with atherosclerotic coronary artery disease. Although the mechanism of this effect is not known, the interaction of lipoprotein(a) with macrophages may be important. Previous work has shown that macrophages in culture internalize and degrade native lipoprotein(a) poorly. In the present study, the interaction of Lp(a) with mouse peritoneal and human monocyte-derived macrophages that were cholesterol-loaded, such as occur in atheromata, was investigated. 125I-Lp(a) degradation was increased 4-5-fold in macrophages that had been loaded with cholesterol by incubation with acetyl-LDL for 2-4 days. The enhanced degradation of Lp(a) by foam cells was chloroquine-sensitive and dependent upon the presence of calcium in the extracellular medium. Incubation of the macrophages with acetyl-LDL plus an inhibitor of acyl CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase, which increased the free cholesterol content and decreased the cholesteryl ester content of the cells, resulted in an even greater up-regulation of 125I-Lp(a) degradation (8-23-fold over control macrophages). The interaction of Lp(a) with cholesterol-loaded macrophages involved the apoprotein(a) moiety of Lp(a) since 125I-apoprotein(a), but not 125I-Lp(a-), was degraded to a much greater extent by foam cells compared to control macrophages. The uptake and degradation of Lp(a) in foam cells was not mediated by LDL, scavenger, LDL receptor-related protein (LRP), or plasminogen receptors. Thus, cholesterol loading of macrophages markedly enhances the internalization and lysosomal degradation of Lp(a) and apo(a) by a calcium-dependent receptor activity different from known lipoprotein receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1536635464,"Thapsigargin, previously reported to release Ca2+ from non-mitochondrial stores of different cell types, as well as nigericin, were found, when used at high concentrations, to release Ca2+ and collapse the membrane potential of Trypanosoma brucei bloodstream and procyclic trypomastigotes mitochondria in situ. At similarly high concentrations (> 10 microM), thapsigargin was also found to release Ca2+ and collapse the membrane potential of isolated rat liver mitochondria. These results indicate that care should be taken when attributing the effects of thapsigargin in intact cells to the specific inhibition of the sarcoplasmic and endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase family of calcium pumps. In addition, we have found no evidence for an increase in intracellular Ca2+ by release of the ion from intracellular stores by nigericin, measuring changes in cytosolic Ca2+ by dual wavelength spectrofluorometry in fura-2-loaded T. brucei bloodstream trypomastigotes or measuring Ca2+ transport in digitonin-permeabilized cells."
https://openalex.org/W1567174590,"The action of adenine and uracyl nucleotides on rat brain capillary endothelial cells was investigated. ATP, UTP, and adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotrisphosphate) activated phospholipase C and induced large increases in [Ca2+]i. ADP had a different action. At low concentrations ( 30 microM), ADP activated phospholipase C. The actions of ATP and ADP and of UTP and ADP were additive. Those of ATP and UTP were not. In the presence of ATP or UTP, the dose-response curve for ADP action on [Ca2+]i was monophasic and corresponded to the high affinity responses. Finally, we observed that ADP did not desensitize cells to the actions of ATP and UTP. In contrast, cross-desensitization of the actions of ATP and UTP were observed. It is concluded that two types of receptors account for the actions of nucleotides: (i) a nucleotide that recognizes ATP and UTP and that is positively coupled to phospholipase C; and (ii) an ADP-specific receptor that induces the mobilization of a thapsigargin-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ pool in a manner independent of the formation of inositol phosphates."
https://openalex.org/W1584074881,"Five members of the human growth hormone (GH) gene family are located at a single locus on chromosome 17. Growth hormone is expressed in the pituitary under the control of the tissue-specific factor Pit 1/GHF-1, and chorionic somatomammotropin (CS) -A, -B, and -L, as well as placental GH variant, are expressed specifically in the placental syncytiotrophoblast. Despite this specificity in vivo, the CS-A promoter can bind Pit 1/GHF-1 and allow CS-A promoter activity in pituitary tumor cells after gene transfer. We have identified and characterized PSF sequences associated with only the placental members in the GH/CS locus which repress placental promoter activity > 90% in transfected pituitary cells. These sequences do not significantly affect promoter function in placental cells after gene transfer. Repressor activity correlates with binding of protein at two sites (PSF-A and PSF-B) with pituitary, but not placental, nuclear extracts. Competition studies suggest an interaction between PSF and Pit 1/GHF-1 proteins. These results indicate that PSF protein can repress CS-A promoter activity in a tissue-specific manner in vitro and provide a possible mechanism by which expression of placental members of the GH family are inhibited in the pituitary in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1527719951,"Human tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) is a plasma protease inhibitor that consists of three tandem Kunitz-type inhibitor domains flanked by a negatively charged NH2 terminus and a positively charged COOH-terminal tail. Previous studies have shown that the first and second Kunitz-type domains in TFPI are involved in the inhibition of factor VIIa and factor Xa activity, respectively. In the present study, we have compared the inhibitory properties of full-length recombinant TFPI and a truncated form of TFPI lacking the third Kunitz-type domain and COOH-terminal tail (TFPI1-161) with respect to inhibition of factor VIIa-tissue factor complexes on the surface of a human bladder carcinoma cell line J82. Full-length TFPI and TFPI1-161 were kinetically indistinguishable with respect to neutralization of the proteolytic activity of preformed complexes of factor VIIa-tissue factor on the J82 cell surface in the absence of factor Xa. Equimolar amounts of factor Xa augmented the anticoagulant activity of both preparations of TFPI to the same extent, and both preparations of TFPI were equally effective in inhibiting factor VIIa-tissue factor amidolytic activity in solution phase. In addition, plasma concentrations of both forms of TFPI, in stoichiometric complex with factor Xa, inhibited cell surface factor VIIa-tissue factor proteolytic activity markedly faster than plasma levels of antithrombin III, even in the presence of 1 unit/ml heparin. The results of displacement studies suggested slight differences in the affinity of the two TFPI molecules for the cell surface in that approximately 5% of a VIIa.TF.Xa.TFPI1-161 quaternary complex on J82 cells was displaceable from the cell surface by high concentrations of factor VIIa (10-100 nM), whereas only 1-2% of a VIIa.TF.Xa.TFPI complex was displaceable under comparable conditions. Pretreatment of the cells with TFPI/Xa alone or together with R152E factor VII, followed by factor VIIa treatment, revealed significant differences in the two TFPI forms with respect to the degree with which offered factor VIIa could restore factor X activation on the cell surface. These differences notwithstanding, our collective findings indicate that the third Kunitz-type domain and/or COOH-terminal tail of TFPI is not essential for the inhibition of cell surface factor VIIa-tissue factor complexes and suggests that TFPI1-161 may be a useful therapeutic agent in the treatment of thromboembolic episodes."
https://openalex.org/W1564890854,"Protein synthesis elongation factor 2 (EF-2) is the target of the ADP-ribosylating activity of diphtheria toxin which is responsible for cell killing. Diphthamide, an unique post-translationally modified histidine residue, is both required for and the site of this ADP-ribosylation. Although present in the EF-2 of all eukaryotes and archaebacteria, the function of diphthamide is unknown. Here we describe the site-specific mutagenesis of the histidine precursor of diphthamide, histidine 699, in yeast EF-2. Plasmid-borne EFT was randomly mutagenized at the histidine 699 codon, and the technique of plasmid shuffling was utilized to select strains that were maintained by the mutant EFT. These mutants were screened for diphtheria toxin resistance. Sequence analysis of the EFT in 49 toxin-resistant isolates showed that histidine 699 had been replaced by 1 of 4 amino acids: asparagine, glutamine, leucine, or methionine. All 11 of the possible codons corresponding to these 4 amino acids were found. The growth rates of cells sustained by the mutant forms of EF-2 were slightly slower than those of isogenic wild-type cells. We conclude that despite its strict conservation and universal post-translational modification, the histidine precursor of diphthamide is not essential to the function of yeast EF-2 in protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1485516489,"Vitamin K-dependent carboxylase, purified from bovine liver, has properties similar to those reported for the carboxylase activity present in crude, solubilized microsomes. The purified carboxylase was found to possess the vitamin K epoxidase activity, believed to be essential for vitamin K-dependent carboxylation, but did not contain vitamin K epoxide reductase activity. Kinetic studies of the carboxylase done under defined conditions were complicated by the non-Michaelis-Menten kinetic behavior observed for reactions with two of the enzymes substrates, FLEEL and vitamin K1 hydroquinone. Initial rate experiments with the substrate FLEEL demonstrated behavior consistent with substrate inhibition and gave half-maximal activity at 1 mM FLEEL. Experiments with the substrate vitamin K1 hydroquinone also displayed non-Michaelis-Menten kinetics, as maximal activity was reached prematurely in relation to behavior at lower concentrations. Half-maximal activity was observed at 35 microM vitamin K1 hydroquinone. Initial rate experiments with varying NaH14CO3 concentration displayed Michaelis-Menten kinetics and gave a Km(app) of 0.29 mM. At cosubstrate concentrations chosen to obtain near-maximal activity, initial rate studies with varying NaH14CO3 concentration indicated a kcat near 1.0 s-1. Removal of the fourth substrate, oxygen, resulted in the loss of more than 99% of carboxylase activity. The sulfhydryl reagent N-ethylmaleimide inhibited carboxylase irreversibly, as did the anticoagulant warfarin."
https://openalex.org/W2101176389,"Isolated rat primary hepatocytes were cultured between two layers of gelled collagen in a sandwich configuration that reinstates the cellular polarity necessary for long-term function in vitro. Maintenance of hepatocyte function, as measured by the secretion of albumin, was shown to be dependent on both the sandwich gel configuration and the continued presence of L-proline in the culture media. Cis-hydroxyproline, an analog of proline known to prevent the proper folding of triple helical collagen molecules, inhibited the response of sandwiched hepatocytes to proline in a dose-dependent and reversible manner. The addition of cis-hydroxyproline to cultures established for 7 days also resulted in the inhibition of hepatocyte function. These data support the hypothesis that continued collagen synthesis by hepatocytes is critical for hepatocyte function in the sandwich gel configuration."
https://openalex.org/W1503936652,"The regulation of specific gene expression by nitrate in Escherichia coli is mediated by the NarX/NarQ-NarL system. Based on sequence homologies with a family of two-component regulatory systems in bacteria, NarL has been identified as a putative response regulator while NarX and NarQ were proposed to be alternative membrane-associated sensors that activate NarL in the presence of nitrate. To investigate the interaction of NarX and NarL in vitro, both proteins were purified from overproducing strains. Purified NarX was rapidly labeled when incubated with [gamma-32P] ATP but not with [alpha-32P]ATP in a reaction that required Mg2+ but was unaffected by nitrate. Incubation of the labeled NarX with purified NarL resulted in the transient phosphorylation of NarL. Both the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of NarL required Mg2+, and neither reaction was affected by the presence of nitrate. NarL-phosphate, stabilized by the addition of EDTA, ran as a monomer on gel filtration. Dephosphorylation of the isolated NarL-phosphate required the addition of both Mg2+ and the NarX protein. The relative stabilities of the phosphorylated forms of the two proteins at different pH values were consistent with the proposal that, in analogy to other related two-component regulatory systems, NarX and NarL were phosphorylated on specific histidine and aspartate residues, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1527544106,"This study provides valuable insights into the functions of the lysine residue that forms an internal aldimine with pyridoxal phosphate in the beta subunit of tryptophan synthase from Salmonella typhimurium. Our spectroscopic and kinetic studies demonstrate that a mutant alpha 2 beta 2 complex having beta subunit lysine 87 replaced by threonine forms external aldimines with several amino acids including L-serine, beta-chloro-1-alanine, L-tryptophan, and D-tryptophan. Because the rates of aldimine formation are very slow, we conclude that one role of lysine 87 in the wild type enzyme is to facilitate formation of external aldimines by transimination. Lysine 87 is an essential catalytic residue because the mutant alpha 2 beta 2 complex has no measurable activity in reactions catalyzed by the beta subunit and does not convert external aldimines to products. The mutant enzyme carries out two slow partial beta-elimination reactions: the conversion of beta-chloro-L-alanine and L-serine to enzyme-bound aminoacrylate. The reaction with L-serine is catalyzed by ammonia, which partially replaces the deleted epsilon-amino group. Lysine 87 is important for substrate and product release because L-serine, L-tryptophan, and aminoacrylate dissociate very slowly from the mutant alpha 2 beta 2 complex. Our ability to prepare very stable derivatives of the mutant alpha 2 beta 2 complex containing tightly bound aldimines with a substrate, a product, or a reaction intermediate provides valuable materials for ongoing x-ray crystallographic investigations and future kinetic analyses of the allosteric activation of the alpha subunit by beta subunit ligands."
https://openalex.org/W1491401080,"Many functions of the 70-kDa heat-shock proteins (hsp70s) appear to be regulated by bound nucleotide. In this study we examined the nucleotide binding properties of purified bovine brain uncoating ATPase, one of the constitutively expressed members of the hsp70 family. We found that uncoating ATPase purified by ATP-agarose column chromatography retained one ADP molecule bound per enzyme molecule which could not be removed by extensive dialysis. Since this bound ADP exchanged rapidly with free ADP or ATP, the inability to remove the bound nucleotide was not due to slow dissociation but rather to strong binding of the nucleotide to the uncoating ATPase. In confirmation of this view, equilibrium dialysis experiments suggested that the dissociation constants for both ADP and ATP were less than 0.1 microM. Schmid et al. (Schmid, S. L., Braell, W. A., and Rothman, J. E. (1985) J. Biol. Chem 260, 10057-10062) suggested that the uncoating ATPase had two sites for bound nucleotide, one specific for ATP and one binding both ATP and ATP analogues but not ADP. In contrast, we found that enzyme with bound ADP did not bind further adenosine 5'-(beta,gamma-imino)triphosphate or dATP, nor did more than one ATP molecule bind per enzyme even in 200 microM free ATP. These results strongly suggest that the enzyme has only one binding site for nucleotide. During steady-state ATP hydrolysis, 85% of the bound nucleotide at this site was determined to be ATP and 15% ADP; this is consistent with the rate of ADP release determined in the exchange experiments noted above, where ADP release was found to be six times faster than the overall rate of ATP hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1508505082,"Involvement in catalysis of a histidyl residue of Syrian hamster 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase was suggested by the ability of diethyl pyrocarbonate to abolish catalytic activity, accompanying spectral changes, and reactivation by hydroxylamine. The 7 histidines present in the catalytic domain of the hamster enzyme were changed to glutamine (His474, His487, His634, His751, His860, and His865), lysine (His865), or tyrosine (His868). Overexpression in Escherichia coli yielded six soluble mutant proteins, one insoluble protein (H634Q), and one which was degraded in vivo (H487Q). Following purification to homogeneity, mutant enzymes H474Q, H751Q, H860Q, and H868Y had essentially wild-type catalytic activity, while mutant enzymes H865K and H865Q had less than 0.6% wild-type activity. The low activity of mutant enzymes H865K and H865Q is unlikely to reflect altered structural integrity since both chromatographed on affinity supports like wild-type enzyme and had Km values for (S)-HMG-CoA (31 and 16 microM) and for NADPH (60 and 24 microM) close to those for wild-type enzyme (31 and 52 microM for (S)-HMG-CoA and NADPH, respectively). His865 of hamster HMG-CoA reductase, the histidine of the consensus Leu-Val-Xaa-Ser-His-Met-Xaa-Xaa-Asn-Arg-Ser motif and the only histidine conserved among the catalytic domains of all HMG-CoA reductases, thus appears to be a general acid/base functional in catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1608040024,"Abstract In our prior studies on lipoprotein stimulation of apolipoprotein E (apoE) secretion in HepG2 cells, it became clear that a proportion of the newly synthesized apoE was degraded intracellularly (Ye, S. Q., Olson, L. M., Reardon, C. A., and Getz, G. S. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 21961-21966). The present study was designed to determine the nature of the proteases and the intracellular sites involved in newly synthesized apoE degradation. The effect of seven protease inhibitors on total apoE levels was examined. Only N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal (ALLN), a cysteine protease inhibitor, significantly blocked apoE degradation in HepG2 cells. The amount of total apoE from cells chased with ALLN for 4 h was increased by 1.58 +/- 0.05-fold relative to the controls (n = 11, p < 0.01). ALLN extended the half-life of apoE from 2.61 h to 4.38 h (p < 0.01). This effect occurs in a post-Golgi compartment since in the presence of brefeldin A, ALLN had no effect on intracellular apoE levels. Chloroquine and NH4Cl significantly reduced apoE degradation; however, ALLN plus either of these reagents appear to have an additive effect. The amount of apoE in cells chased in Ca(2+)-free medium was significantly higher than that in cells chased in Ca(2+)-containing medium (1.70 +/- 0.07-fold, n = 6, p < 0.01). ALLN plus Ca(2+)-free medium had no additive effect. ALLN had no significant influence on the degradation of albumin but had a similar effect on transfected apoE in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Overall, these data suggest that apoE may be degraded in a post-Golgi compartment of HepG2 and Chinese hamster ovary cells by lysosomal enzymes and cytosolic Ca(2+)-dependent cysteine proteases. ALLN inhibits the latter."
https://openalex.org/W1518779620,"Detailed study of mammalian mitochondrial transcriptional and replicative mechanisms is currently limited to in vitro analyses, requiring isolation and reassembly of functional components to mimic the in vivo process. To complement these studies and begin understanding the intracellular function of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) regulatory regions, we developed in organello footprinting to investigate protein-DNA interactions within the mitochondrion. Using a methylation protection technique and mitochondria isolated from bovine brain tissue, we analyzed five domains believed critical for regulating mtDNA function. Near equivalent protein-DNA interactions were seen upstream of both light and heavy strand RNA start sites at positions consistent with those observed for human mitochondrial transcription factor 1 DNA binding in vitro. Downstream of the 16 S rRNA gene, a high level of protein occupancy was detected within the bovine homologue of the human tridecamer sequence required for attenuation of transcription in vitro. Immediately upstream of the origin of heavy strand replication, a novel site of protein-mtDNA interaction was observed within conserved sequence block 1, suggesting its potential as a regulatory element involved in initiation of heavy strand DNA synthesis. Unlike regions associated with the origin of heavy strand replication, protein-mtDNA interaction was not detected at the origin of light strand replication or within flanking tRNA genes."
https://openalex.org/W1495366495,"Coagulation factor IX has the modular composition Gla-(EGF)2-SP, where Gla, EGF, and SP represent the gamma-carboxy-Glu-rich, epidermal growth factor-like, and serine protease modules, respectively. The protein melts in two distinct temperature regions. The SP module melts at lower temperature between 42 and 55 degrees C, depending on the pH, with irreversible loss of esterolytic activity. The endotherm corresponding to this transition is readily described by a two-state transition indicating the melting of a single cooperative unit. A thrombin-generated 12-kDa fragment representing the COOH-terminal half of the SP module and a 45-kDa fragment containing the NH2-terminal half of the SP module and the rest of the molecule can be separated by exclusion chromatography in 3 M urea and recombined in its absence. Both fragments retain a compact structure as evidenced by melting transitions near 60 degrees C at neutral pH. This indicates that the SP module contains two independently folded domains that strongly interact with each other and seem to merge into one cooperative unit in the intact protein. At low pH at high temperature a second peak appears which is also observed in a 19-kDa fragment containing the EGF modules. Thermodynamic analysis of this second peak showed that the two EGF modules are independently folded and provided evidence for a weak interaction between them. Fluorescence and CD measurements indicated that the secondary structure of the isolated 6-kDa Gla fragment is substantially increased in the presence of Ca2+. The Ca2+-loaded Gla fragment undergoes a sigmoidal unfolding transition as revealed by fluorescence and CD measurements. This same transition in a 25-kDa Gla-(EGF)2 fragment was stabilized by more than 10 degrees C, indicating a strong interaction between the Ca(2+)-loaded Gla and EGF domains. Thus, factor IX consists of five independently folded interacting domains."
https://openalex.org/W1527817990,"We have demonstrated that the 17-kDa N-terminal matrix protein (p17gag) of HIV-1 Pr55gag is a substrate for protein kinase C (PKC). Phosphorylation of p17gag and Pr55gag was studied in vivo by infecting COS-7 cells with a recombinant vaccinia virus containing the HIV-1 gag-pol gene. Basal gag protein phosphorylation was inhibited up to 75% with the PKC inhibitor, H-7, and stimulated 3-4-fold with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. In experiments using MCF-7 cell lines, p17gag and Pr55gag were dramatically phosphorylated only in clones with high PKC activity. Bacterially expressed and purified non-myristoylated and N-myristoylated p17gag were efficiently phosphorylated in a Ca2+ and phosphatidylserine-dependent manner by purified PKC. The N-myristoylated p17gag exhibited an apparent Km = 4 microM for PKC phosphorylation. Both in vitro and in vivo phosphorylated p17gag yielded identical V8 protease digestion phosphopeptide maps, indicating identical PKC phosphorylation sites. Phosphoamino acid analysis of the in vitro phosphorylated p17gag revealed only phosphoserine. These data are consistent with the identification of a highly conserved consensus PKC phosphorylation site motif in the HIV-1 gag protein at Ser111 and suggests that PKC phosphorylation plays an important role in gag protein function."
https://openalex.org/W1530517811,"Tentoxin, a cyclic tetrapeptide produced by the fungus Alternaria tenuis, is a potent inhibitor of the chloroplast coupling factor 1 from certain sensitive species of plants. We have shown that the beta subunit is at least partly responsible for conferring sensitivity to the toxin. This was confirmed by Avni et al. (Avni, A., Anderson, J.D., Holland, N., Rochaix, J-D., Gromet-Elhanan, Z., and Edelman, M. (1992) Science 257, 1245-1247) who demonstrated the importance for tentoxin sensitivity of an acidic amino acid residue at position 83 in the beta subunit sequence. In this paper we show that the Ca(2+)-ATPase and Mg(2+)-ATPase activities of CF1 lacking the delta and epsilon subunits, CF1(-delta epsilon), were fully sensitive to tentoxin, even after the gamma subunit is cleaved by trypsin into several smaller fragments. We also show that the isolated reconstitutively active beta subunit of CF1 does not effectively compete with CF1(-delta epsilon) for tentoxin binding. The results suggest that tight tentoxin binding requires the presence of at least the alpha and beta subunits but is independent of the delta and epsilon subunits. Tentoxin inhibited the release of a tightly bound molecule of ADP from CF1, which was induced by the binding of the ATP analogue adenylyl-beta,gamma-imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP). AMP-PNP was shown previously (Shapiro, A.B., and McCarty, R.E. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 4340-4347) to cause two adenine nucleotide binding sites on CF1, sites 1 and 3, to switch their properties, possibly as part of an alternating site catalytic cooperativity mechanism (Boyer, P.D. (1989) FASEB J. 3, 2164-2178). It is proposed that the effect of tentoxin on catalytic cooperativity in CF1 results from tentoxin binding at an interface between alpha and beta subunits, preventing transfer of information between different nucleotide binding sites on the enzyme."

We isolated a genomic clone of type II hexokinase that contained five exons encoding the C-terminal region of type II hexokinase. The positions of intron insertions of the isolated clone were found to be identical with those of the glucokinase gene, indicating that the type II hexokinase gene arose from the glucokinase gene. Furthermore, we prepared two DNA fragments of the type II hexokinase gene amplified from total genomic DNA. The exons in these fragments were found to be constructed by linkage of the coding region of the last exon and second exon of the glucokinase gene, indicating that the hexokinase gene arose by fusion of two glucokinase genes. These results clearly show that the mammalian hexokinase gene evolved from the glucokinase gene by gene duplication and fusion with conservation of the gene organization."

(1990) Biopolymers 29, 29-38) to determine the degree of bending induced by the binding of the restriction endonuclease EcoRV to its recognition sequence (-GATATC-). A set of four calibration DNA fragments was constructed that contained zero, two, four, or six phased A-tracts in their centers and an EcoRV site at the 5'-end to account for the electrophoretic influence of the bound protein. The mobilities of these calibration molecules complexed with EcoRV were compared to that of a test DNA containing a central EcoRV site also complexed with EcoRV. The EcoRV-induced bend angle was found to be 44 degrees +/- 4 degrees. These experiments were performed with a catalytically inactive EcoRV mutant that still binds DNA specifically in the presence of Mg2+. In the absence of Mg2+, which is necessary for specific binding, there is no difference in the mobilities of the fragments with a peripheral or a central EcoRV site complexed with EcoRV, indicating that nonspecific binding on average does not lead to measurable DNA bending."
https://openalex.org/W1569240903,"Previous work has suggested that the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase D (GPI-PLD) purified from bovine serum is inhibited by phosphatidic acid (PA). In this study we report on the specificity and mechanism of this phenomenon using [3H]myristate-labeled variant surface glycoprotein dispersed in Nonidet P-40 as substrate. Inhibition of GPI-PLD by PAs (IC50 approximately 1 microM) was relatively independent of the length or degree of unsaturation of the fatty acyl chains. It was also observed that lysophosphatidic acid and several natural and synthetic lipid A preparations were inhibitory in the same concentration range. The inhibitory potency of PA, lysophosphatidic acid, and lipid A was dependent on the detergent concentration in the assay but in all cases this was in a large (i.e. > 100-fold) molar excess over the inhibitor. The inhibitory lipids did not affect substrate availability nor did they reduce hydrolysis of variant surface glycoprotein by a bacterial phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. Studies with a wide range of other lipids, detergents, and phosphate esters indicated that inhibition was specific for lipids containing a phosphomonoester group. The data suggest that inhibition is due to a direct interaction between PA (or lipid A) and the GPI-PLD rather than an indirect effect on the substrate particle."
https://openalex.org/W1539776437,"The 5'-flanking region of the human ADP-ribosylation factor 3 gene contains the features of a housekeeping gene. It lacks a TATA or CAAT box, has several GC boxes within a highly GC-rich region, and utilizes multiple transcription initiation sites. The cis-acting elements involved in regulating expression of the gene were identified by transient transfections of IMR-32 neuroblastoma cells. Reporter plasmids were modified to facilitate construction of defined promoter deletions linked to chloramphenicol acetyltransferase or luciferase using ligation-independent cloning. Transfection analyses indicated that sequences within 58 base pairs of the transcription initiation site were necessary for full expression, in particular a sequence containing the 10-base pair palindrome TCTCGCGAGA. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays performed with IMR-32 nuclear extracts demonstrated that a DNA-binding protein, termed TLTF, bound to an oligonucleotide containing this palindrome. Competition experiments showed that mutations within the core of the palindrome abolished in vitro binding and that the same protein bound to a 5'-proximal sequence. Expression of the promoter containing a mutated palindrome was reduced dramatically, consistent with the conclusion that this region functions in vivo to control expression of the ARF3 gene."
https://openalex.org/W1500528380,"The molecular basis of the ferrochelatase defects was investigated in two protoporphyric and partially heme-deficient yeast mutants. Ferrochelatase, a mitochondrial inner membrane-bound enzyme, catalyzes the incorporation of ferrous iron into protoporphyrin, the last step in protoheme biosynthesis. The mutant cells made normal amounts of normal-sized ferrochelatase, as detected by immunoblotting. The mutations were identified by sequencing the mutant hem15 alleles amplified in vitro from mutant strains genomic DNA. A single nucleotide change, causing an amino acid substitution, was found in each mutant. Substitution of the conserved Ser-169 by Phe caused a 10-fold increase in Vmax and a 45- and 35-fold increase in the KM for protoporphyrin and metal, respectively. Replacement of Ser-174 by Pro produced the same effects, but to a lesser degree. There was a good correlation between the ferrochelatase defects measured in vitro and the heme synthesis deficiencies estimated in vivo. The decreased in vivo heme synthesis is probably due to the lower affinity of the mutant enzymes for iron. We propose that the region identified by the two close mutations contributes to the binding domains of metal and protoporphyrin."

Maximal inhibition was evident within 7 min of incubation, followed by reversal of inhibition. In contrast, 10 microM GTP gamma S did not induce inhibition of PLC activity but rather produced a time-dependent stimulation of PLC activity. GTP gamma S-dependent inhibition of PLC activity was concentration-dependent with half-maximal inhibition at 1 nM. Inhibition was antagonized by guanosine 5-O-(2-thiodiphosphate (GDP beta S). Pertussis toxin delayed the onset of inhibition by GTP gamma S but did not prevent the inhibitory effect. alpha o-GTP gamma S or alpha o-GDP had little effect on PLC activity. alpha i-GTP gamma S and alpha i-GDP produced a 15% inhibition of PLC activity. Beta gamma subunits did not inhibit basal PLC activity but did attenuate the net degree of inhibition due to GTP gamma S. Inhibition was associated with a decrease in the Ca2+ sensitivity of PLC. Preincubation of membranes with anti-PLC-beta 1 antibody, but not anti-PLC-gamma 1 or anti-PLC-delta 1, prevented the GTP gamma S-mediated inhibition of PLC. These studies implicate PLC-beta 1 as an effector system that is under negative modulation by a G protein-dependent mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1525668932,"T-cell antigen receptor engagement results in suboptimal activation of protein kinase C and a prolonged increase in intracellular free calcium concentration. These signals, in combination with stimulation via accessory molecules usually supplied by the antigen presenting cell, activate expression of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and initiate autocrine growth. The lymphocyte-specific tyrosine kinase p56lck is physically associated with CD4 and is brought into close proximity of the intracellular domain of the antigen receptor by CD4 recognition of the major histocompatibility complex during antigen presentation. p56lck activation enhances and may be essential for antigen receptor signaling. We report that a constitutively active form of p56lck delivers a signal which contributes to IL-2 promoter activation. The signal substituted for a calcium-mobilizing signal in a Jurkat cell model of T-cell activation. The activation was sensitive to EGTA and cyclosporin A, indicating that p56lck functions at an early stage of the calcium-mediated pathway. The transcription factor NF-AT mediated, at least in part, the p56lck activation of IL-2 expression. In addition, activated p56lck synergized with constitutively active p21Ha-ras, which can replace protein kinase C activation, resulting in activation of NF-AT in the absence of external signals."
https://openalex.org/W1652458301,"Interactions of components of the fibrinolytic system with fibrin play a key role in localization and regulation of plasminogen activation at the clot surface. Although interaction of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) with fibrin is well established, the prevailing view is that urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) does not bind to fibrin. In this report, I show that although there is little or no interaction of single-chain urokinase (Sc-uPA), two-chain urokinase (Tc-uPA), or low molecular weight urokinase (LMW-uPA) with fibrin in the absence of divalent metal cations, Sc-uPA is effectively bound to fibrin in the presence of Zn2+. By comparison, Tc-uPA is poorly bound and LMW-uPA is not bound to fibrin in the presence of the metal ion. The Zn(2+)-mediated fibrin binding of Sc-uPA is reversible, specific, and saturable. The interaction involves a single class of binding site with dissociation constant of 0.3 microM and stoichiometry of 2.7. Lacking apparent affinity for fibrin, uPA has not been considered to play a role in physiological fibrinolysis. The present study conclusively shows that Sc-uPA possesses a latent affinity for fibrin that is expressed in the presence of Zn2+. These findings raise the possibility that Zn2+ plays a regulatory role in uPA-mediated fibrinolysis by promoting effective localization of Sc-uPA at the clot surface."
https://openalex.org/W1493673640,"Human plasma fibronectin is a plasma glycoprotein that plays an important role in many biological processes. It consists of two identical 230-250-kDa subunits that are joined by two disulfide bonds near their carboxyl termini. Each subunit contains various binding domains composed of three types of homologous repeats. Recent work has determined the three-dimensional structures of various repeat fragments, but little is known about the three-dimensional structure of the carboxyl-terminal region. A recent NMR study of a plasmin-digested carboxyl-terminal inter-chain disulfide-linked heptapeptide dimer has proposed that the two subunits are arranged in an antiparallel fashion (An et al. (1992) Biochemistry 31, 9927-9933). We have now determined the three-dimensional structure for a substantial portion of a trypsin-digested interchain disulfide-linked 52-residue (6 kDa) fragment of the carboxyl-terminal of human plasma fibronectin (which includes the above-mentioned heptapeptide dimer) using two-dimensional NMR methods and a new strategy for NMR-based protein structure determination. The NMR data requires that the two chains in the dimer be linked in a symmetric, antiparallel arrangement. The resulting monomer conformation consists of two twisted or coiled segments, Thr3-Asn6 and Ile9-Phe12, connected by the Cys7-Pro8 residues in extended conformations, with the two monomer chains cross-linked at residues Cys7 and Cys11. The conformation of the heptapeptide dimer region differs substantially from the conformation proposed by An et al."
https://openalex.org/W1571567433,"AMP nucleosidase (EC 3.2.2.4) from Escherichia coli and AMP deaminase (EC 3.5.4.6) from bakers' yeast are proposed to regulate cellular AMP levels under allosteric control of the activator ATP and the inhibitor, PO4. Both enzymes contain catalytic sites which bind AMP and regulatory sites which bind ATP. The deduced amino acid sequences of the proteins revealed only one region of homology in which six of eight amino acids are identical. A similar sequence is found in glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phoE, ras proteins, RNA polymerase, K(+)-ATPase, nucleolin, and other proteins expected to have nucleotide or phosphate binding properties. In the crystal structure of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, this sequence is part of the NAD(+)-binding site. The function of these amino acids was explored with a deletion mutant of AMP nucleosidase. The protein was over-produced in a pTZ construct using the AMP nucleosidase promoter which resulted in approximately 30% of the total protein as the desired enzyme. The mutation was characterized by DNA sequence analysis and by direct analysis of the peptides using high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Deletion of amino acids 128-135, corresponding to DGSELTLD, produced an enzyme with a 20-fold decrease in Vmax but with smaller changes in substrate saturation kinetics, activation by MgATP, inhibition by inorganic phosphate, and inhibition by the tight-binding inhibitor, formycin 5-phosphate. The deletion mutant of AMP nucleosidase exhibits hysteresis in establishing a steady-state rate of product formation which is most pronounced in the absence of MgATP. These results establish that the sequence DGSELTLD in E. coli AMP nucleosidase is not required for binding of AMP, MgATP, or inorganic phosphate. However, the mutant enzyme has a structural defect related to the polymerization state which delays the onset of catalysis and decreases the catalytic efficiency."
