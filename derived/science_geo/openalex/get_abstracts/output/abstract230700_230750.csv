https://openalex.org/W1983553517,"Dendritic spines of pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex undergo activity-dependent structural remodelling1,2,3,4,5 that has been proposed to be a cellular basis of learning and memory6. How structural remodelling supports synaptic plasticity4,5, such as long-term potentiation7, and whether such plasticity is input-specific at the level of the individual spine has remained unknown. We investigated the structural basis of long-term potentiation using two-photon photolysis of caged glutamate at single spines of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons8. Here we show that repetitive quantum-like photorelease (uncaging) of glutamate induces a rapid and selective enlargement of stimulated spines that is transient in large mushroom spines but persistent in small spines. Spine enlargement is associated with an increase in AMPA-receptor-mediated currents at the stimulated synapse and is dependent on NMDA receptors, calmodulin and actin polymerization. Long-lasting spine enlargement also requires Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. Our results thus indicate that spines individually follow Hebb's postulate for learning. They further suggest that small spines are preferential sites for long-term potentiation induction, whereas large spines might represent physical traces of long-term memory."

https://openalex.org/W2152134696,"A large body of evidence from the past decade supports the existence of functional microdomains in membranes of animal and yeast cells, which play important roles in protein sorting, signal transduction, or infection by pathogens. They are based on the dynamic clustering of sphingolipids and cholesterol or ergosterol and are characterized by their insolubility, at low temperature, in nonionic detergents. Here we show that similar microdomains also exist in plant plasma membrane isolated from both tobacco leaves and BY2 cells. Tobacco lipid rafts were found to be greatly enriched in a sphingolipid, identified as glycosylceramide, as well as in a mixture of stigmasterol, sitosterol, 24-methylcholesterol, and cholesterol. Phospho- and glycoglycerolipids of the plasma membrane were largely excluded from lipid rafts. Membrane proteins were separated by one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and identified by tandem mass spectrometry or use of specific antibody. The data clearly indicate that tobacco microdomains are able to recruit a specific set of the plasma membrane proteins and exclude others. We demonstrate the recruitment of the NADPH oxidase after elicitation by cryptogein and the presence of the small G protein NtRac5, a negative regulator of NADPH oxidase, in lipid rafts.

We demonstrate the recruitment of the NADPH oxidase after elicitation by cryptogein and the presence of the small G protein NtRac5, a negative regulator of NADPH oxidase, in lipid rafts. A new aspect of the lipid bilayer organization has arisen from biophysical and biochemical studies performed with animal cells for several years. Indeed, lipids are not uniformly miscible, but lateral separation of specific lipid species leads to the formation of specialized phase domains also called “lipid rafts” (1Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8117) Google Scholar). The main role in the process of domain organization is played by sterols and sphingolipids, these latter interacting together through weak interaction between aliphatic chains stabilized by the presence of saturated alkyl chains, voids between sphingolipids being filled by sterols (for a review, see Ref. 2Slotte J.P. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 102: 13-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The cholesterol-sphingolipid-enriched domain formation is also enhanced by the fact that sphingolipids have higher melting temperatures than phospholipids. Regions between rafts are occupied by phospholipids, with unsaturated fatty acids forming a liquid-crystalline phase, whereas lipid rafts that contain more saturated aliphatic chains form a liquid-ordered phase. In model and biological membranes, the formation of the liquid-ordered phase correlates with resistance to solubilization by nonionic detergent such as Triton X-100 at 4 °C and buoyancy at specific density in a sucrose gradient (3Brown D.A. London E. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 164: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). Thus, isolation of detergent-insoluble membranes (DIM) 1The abbreviations used are: DIM, detergent-insoluble membrane(s); DGDG, digalactosyldiacylglycerol; GC, gas chromatography; GluCer, glucosylceramide; HP-TLC, high performance thin layer chromatography; PM, plasma membrane(s); MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; TOF, time-of-flight; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; NtrbohD, NADPH oxidase. or detergent-insoluble glycolipid-enriched membrane domains is one of the most widely used methods for studying lipid rafts. In animal cells, these membrane domains act, for example, as sorting devices for the accumulation of acylated, glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored, palmitoylated signaling molecules that selectively locate in these domains. Tyrosine kinases of the Src family protein, heterotrimeric and small G-proteins, as well as phosphoinositides have been proved to be located in rafts. In addition, several transmembrane receptors are inductively recruited or stabilized within lipid rafts, including T and B cell receptors and interleukin-2/interleukin-15 receptors (4Garcia A. Cayla X. Fleischer A. Guergnon J. Alvarez-Franco Canas F. Rebollo M.P. Roncal F. Rebollo A. Biochimie. 2003; 85: 727-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This targeting of proteins to rafts might affect their function in two ways; the concentration of proteins in rafts could facilitate interactions between them, and the ordered lipid environment might directly modulate their activity, possibly by a modification of their conformation. The size of rafts seems to be a critical parameter; the small size of an individual raft may be important for keeping raft-bound signaling proteins in an inactive state. Upon stimulation, many rafts may have to cluster to form a larger platform where functionally related proteins can interact (4Garcia A. Cayla X. Fleischer A. Guergnon J. Alvarez-Franco Canas F. Rebollo M.P. Roncal F. Rebollo A. Biochimie. 2003; 85: 727-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In yeast and animal cells, the association of proteins with these specialized plasma membrane microdomains has emerged as an important regulator of signal transduction, protein and membrane polarized intracellular sorting, cytoskeletal reorganization, and entry of infectious organisms in living cells (for a review, see Refs. 1Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8117) Google Scholar and 5Bagnat M. Simons K. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 1475-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In plants, much biological evidence supports the existence of functional domains in the plasma membrane. For example, the extreme polarized growth of pollen tube and root hair could be explained by the presence of very specialized membrane domains at the end of the cell (6Kost B. Lemichez E. Spielhofer P. Hong Y. Tolias K. Carpenter C. Chua N.H. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 317-330Crossref Scopus (444) Google Scholar). The concomitant recruitment of the membrane phosphoinositide phosphoinositol (4,5)bisphosphate and the small G-protein RAC at the tip of the tobacco pollen tube is indeed consistent with such an hypothesis (6Kost B. Lemichez E. Spielhofer P. Hong Y. Tolias K. Carpenter C. Chua N.H. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 317-330Crossref Scopus (444) Google Scholar). More generally, the asymmetric growth of plant cells is probably due to an asymmetric distribution of membrane components. For example, the vectorial auxin flow has been postulated to arise from a polarized localization of efflux carriers, which could be also located within rafts (7Schindelman G. Morikami A. Jung J. Baskin T.I. Carpita N.C. Derbyshire P. McCann M.C. Benfey P.N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1115-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Therefore, isolating and examining lipid raft in plant membranes may provide new insights into the control of these crucial physiological processes but also of some other events that require the set up of a rapid and coordinate signal transduction pathway. Whereas very little attention has been paid to lipid rafts in plant membranes, one previous work evidenced that Triton X-100-insoluble membranes could be isolated from tobacco leaf plasma membranes (8Peskan T. Westermann M. Oelmuller R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6989-6995Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This work showed that membrane-bound heterotrimeric G-protein β-subunit and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins are located in a Triton X-100-insoluble fraction. In the present study, we fully characterized the structure and the lipid composition of plant Triton X-100-insoluble fraction and initiated a proteomic study of proteins enriched in the lipid rafts to decipher the physiological role(s) of plant membrane microdomains. We first determined the experimental conditions to isolate Triton X-100-insoluble fractions from tobacco plasma membrane, characterized their morphology by electron microscopy, and further analyzed their lipid composition using HP-TLC, GC, and mass spectrometry. We further studied by one- and two-dimensional electrophoresis the protein composition of lipid rafts versus plasma membrane. The results obtained confirm the presence of membrane domains with a lipid and protein composition distinct from the whole plasma membrane. Results are discussed in relation to their possible involvement in some plant physiological functions. Materials—Leaves were obtained from 8-week-old tobacco plants (Nicotiana tabacum cv. Xanthi) grown in a growth chamber at 25 °C under 16/8-h day/night conditions. BY2 cells (N. tabacum cv. Bright Yellow 2), wild type or transformed with a construct corresponding to the fusion of Ntrac5 (AJ250174) with an RGS-His tag (9Morel J. Fromentin J. Blein J.P. Simon-Plas F. Elmayan T. Plant J. 2004; 37: 282-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), were grown as previously described in Ref. 10Simon-Plas F. Elmayan T. Blein J.P. Plant J. 2002; 31: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar. A purified mouse monoclonal RGS-His6 antibody (0.2 mg·ml–1) was obtained from Qiagen (Courtaboeuf, France). Cryptogein was purified as described previously (9Morel J. Fromentin J. Blein J.P. Simon-Plas F. Elmayan T. Plant J. 2004; 37: 282-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and BY2 cells were treated at a final concentration of 50 nm. A polyclonal rabbit serum raised against amino acids 138–152 and 784–798 of the NADPH oxidase (NtrbohD) protein was obtained from Eurogentec (4102 Seraing-Belgium). IgG was purified according to the manufacturer's instructions and resuspended in distilled water at a concentration of 2 mg·ml–1. Preparation and Purity of Tobacco Plasma Membrane (PM)—All steps were performed at 4 °C. PM were obtained after cell fractionation according to Ref. 10Simon-Plas F. Elmayan T. Blein J.P. Plant J. 2002; 31: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar by partitioning in an aqueous polymer two-phase system with polyethylene glycol 3350/dextran T-500 (6.6% each). ATPase activity was measured according to Ref. 11Ames B.N. Methods Enzymol. 1966; 8: 115-118Crossref Scopus (3023) Google Scholar. Marker activities used to evaluate the contamination of the plasma membrane fraction were as follows: azide-sensitive ATPase activity at pH 9 for mitochondria; nitrate-sensitive ATPase activity at pH 6 for tonoplast; and antimycin-insensitive NADH cytochrome c reductase for endoplasmic reticulum (12Moore A.L. Proudlove M.O. Hall J.L. Moore A.L. Isolation of Organelles and Membranes from Plant Cells. Academic Press, London, UK1983: 153-184Google Scholar), analysis of chlorophyll (13Wintermans J.F. de Mots A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 109: 448-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar), and lipid monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (14Macala L.J. Yu R.K. Ando S. J. Lipid Res. 1983; 24: 1243-1250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) contents for chloroplasts (thylakoids and envelope, respectively). Preparation of DIM—PM (∼2 mg) were washed in 4 ml of TE buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 3 mm EDTA) to remove residual polyethylene glycol-dextran and then resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold TE buffer. Protein amount was determined according to Ref. 15Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Prechilled (4 °C) 10% Triton X-100 was added to the final amount indicated in the figures (in all cases 1% final concentration), and the membranes were solubilized at 4 °C for 30 min. After solubilization, the membranes were brought to a final concentration of 52% sucrose (w/w), overlaid with 3 ml of 35, 30, and 5% sucrose in TE buffer (w/w), and then spun for 16 h at 150,000 × g at 4 °C in TST41 rotor (SORVALL). DIM could be recovered below the 30–35% layers and washed in 4 ml of TE buffer to remove residual sucrose. The protein concentration was determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay kit (BCA) to avoid Triton X-100 interference, using bovine serum albumin as a protein standard. All buffers were ice-cold, and the final recovering buffer contained the following protease inhibitors: 0.5 mg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 mg/ml pepstatin, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Electron Microscopy—Purified tobacco PM and DIM of the sucrose gradient were pelleted at 100,000 × g. The pellets were covered with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 100 mm phosphate buffer for 2 h at 4 °C and then rinsed and treated with buffered 1% osmium tetroxide for 2 h at 4 °C. After several rinses, the samples were postfixed with 1% tannic acid (Mallinckrodt) for 30 min at 20 °C. The pellets were then stripped with a fine needle and embedded in droplets of low melting point agarose (Sigma). Hardened agarose blocks were then dehydrated with ethanol and epoxypropane and embedded in epon. Ultrathin sections, 45 nm thick, were collected on bare 600-mesh copper grids, stained with uranyl and lead, and observed with a Tecnai 12 electron microscope (FEI) operated at 80 kV. Analysis of Lipids by HP-TLC and Quantification—Lipids were extracted according to Ref. 16Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Med. Sci. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar. In Fig. 1B, lipids of PM and DIM were globally quantified from TLC plates by densitometric scanning (14Macala L.J. Yu R.K. Ando S. J. Lipid Res. 1983; 24: 1243-1250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For more precise quantification, individual polar lipids were purified from the extracts by monodimensional HP-TLC using the solvent system described by Ref. 17Vitiello F. Zanetta J.P. J. Chromatogr. 1978; 166: 637-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar. Lipids were then located by spraying the plates with a solution of 0.1% (w/v) primuline in 80% acetone, followed by visualization under UV light. Fatty acids of individual lipids were determined and quantified by gas chromatography after conversion to the corresponding methyl esters by hot methanolic H2SO4 according to Ref. 18Browse J. McCourt P.J. Somerville C.R. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 152: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar. The retention times of fatty acid methyl esters were determined by comparison with the standards. The mol % of polar lipid was determined by quantifying the amount of each fatty acid by gas chromatography. Sphingolipids were identified by mild alkaline hydrolysis of the total lipid extract for 1 h at 80 °C in methanolic 2.5 m KOH. Neutral lipids were separated by the solvent system described in Ref. 19Juguelin H. Heape A. Boiron F. Cassagne C. Brain Res. 1986; 390: 249-252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. For mass spectrometry analysis preparation, the sphingolipids were purified by HP-TLC. Recovered lipids were further purified through an Oasis C18 Waters® cartridge according to the manufacturer's instructions and analyzed by MALDI-MS (see below). Sterol Analysis—Free sterols from tobacco leaf PM and DIM were first purified by chromatography on silica gel plates developed in CH2Cl2 (two runs) and then quantified as acetate derivatives by GC. Analysis was carried out with a Varian GC model 8300 equipped with a flame ionization detector and a fused capillary column (WCOT; 30 m × 0.25 mm inner diameter) coated with DB1, with the following program: an initial rise of temperature from 60 to 220 °C at 30 °C/min, a rise from 220 to 280 °Cat2 °C/min, and a plateau at 280 °C for 10 min. Cholesterol was used as internal standard. Sterol acetates were identified by GC-MS according to Ref. 20Rahier A. Benveniste P. Nes W.D. Parish E. Analysis of Sterols and Other Significant Steroids. Academic Press, Inc., New York1989: 223-250Google Scholar. MALDI-MS Analysis of Lipid—MALDI-MS spectra were acquired using a TofSpec MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer from Micromass (Manchester, UK). The instrument was equipped with a pulsed N2 laser (337 nm, 4-ns pulse width) and a time-delayed extracted ion source. Spectra were recorded in the positive ion mode using the reflectron and with an accelerating voltage of 20 kV. Samples were dissolved in CHCl3/MeOH (2:1, v/v) at 10 mg/ml. The trihydroxyacetophenon matrix solution was prepared by dissolving 10 mg in 1 ml of CHCl3/MeOH (2:1, v/v). A methanolic solution of cationization agent (NaI; 10 mg/ml) was also prepared. The solutions were combined in a 10:1:1 volume ratio of matrix-to-sample-to-cationization agent. 1–2 μl of the obtained solution was deposited onto the sample target and vacuum-dried. Monodimensional Gel Protein Electrophoresis—Proteins from PM and DIM were separated by monodimensional electrophoresis at 4 °C on high resolution 100-mm/140-mm/1-mm, 10% polyacrylamide SDS gels. Molecular mass standards were prestained full range markers (Sigma). Bidimensionnal Electrophoresis—All steps were performed at room temperature. 100 μg of PM and DIM proteins were solubilized for 2 h under gentle shaking in 30 μl of a buffer containing 7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 2% (w/v) ASB14, and 0.2% (w/v) Triton X-100. After solubilization, 120 μl of the same buffer (7 m urea, 2 m thiourea) without detergents were added to reach a final volume of 150 μl suitable for rehydration of the IPG gel strips (ReadyStrip IPG Strip; 7 cm, pH 4–7; Bio-Rad). Finally, 0.6% carrier ampholytes 4–7 (Bio-Lyte 4–6 and 5–7 mixed; Bio-Rad) and 1% tributylphosphine (2 mm; Bio-Rad) were added. After passive rehydration (2 h) and active rehydration (12 h, 50 V), isoelectric focusing was performed with the following running conditions: 100 V for 1 h, 250 V for 1 h, 500 V for 1 h, 1000 V for 1 h, from 1000 to 4000 V for 2 h, and 4000 V to reach 35,000 V-h. After isoelectric focusing, the IPG gel strips were incubated at room temperature for 2 × 7 min in an equilibration buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 6 m urea, 30% glycerol (v/v), 2% SDS (w/v), 130 mm dithiothreitol. The second equilibration step was carried out two times for 8 min in the same buffer, except that dithiothreitol was replaced by iodoacetamide. The second dimension (SDS-PAGE) was carried out on 12% running gels without stacking: 25 V for 15 min and then 15 mA/gel for 1 h. The gels were stained with the Silver Staining Kit Protein (Amersham Biosciences). Proteomic Analysis, In-gel Protein Digestion—Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained proteins separated by monodimensional SDS-PAGE were excised and washed twice with ultrapure water. Spots were subsequently washed in H2O/MeOH/acetic acid (50:50:5) until complete destaining. The solvent mixture was removed and replaced by acetonitrile. After shrinking of the gel pieces, acetonitrile was removed, and gel pieces were dried in a vacuum centrifuge. Gel pieces were rehydrated in 12.5 ng/μl trypsin (Roche Applied Science) in 50 mm NH4HCO3 and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The supernatant was removed and stored at –20 °C, and the gel pieces were incubated for 15 min in 50 mm NH4HCO3 at room temperature under rotary shaking. This second supernatant was pooled with the previous one, and a H2O/acetonitrile/HCOOH (50:50:5) solution was added onto the gel pieces for 15 min. This step was repeated again twice. Supernatants were pooled and concentrated in a vacuum centrifuge to a final volume of 30 μl. Digests were finally acidified by the addition of 1.8 μl of acetic acid and stored at –20 °C. On-line Capillary HPLC Nanospray Ion Trap MS/MS Analyses— Peptide mixtures were analyzed by on-line capillary HPLC (LC Packings, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) coupled to a nanospray LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA). Peptides were separated on a 75-μm inner diameter × 15-cm C18 PepMapTM column (LC Packings). The flow rate was set at 200 nl/min. Peptides were eluted using a 5–50% linear gradient of solvent B in 30 min (solvent A was 0.1% formic acid in 5% acetonitrile, and solvent B was 0.1% formic acid in 80% acetonitrile). The mass spectrometer was operated in positive ion mode at a 2-kV needle voltage and a 30-V capillary voltage. Data acquisition was performed in a data-dependent mode consisting of, alternatively in a single run, a full scan MS over the range m/z 150–2000 and a full scan MS/MS in an exclusion dynamic mode. MS/MS data were acquired using a 2-m/z unit ion isolation window, a 35% relative collision energy, and a 5-min dynamic exclusion duration. Peptides were identified using SEQUEST (ThermoFinnigan, Torrence, CA) and the Swiss-Prot and NCBI data bases. Western Blot Analysis—All steps were performed at room temperature. After electrophoresis separation (1 h, 20 mA/gel), proteins were electro-blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane (20 min, 15 V; Trans-blot SD semidry transfer cell; Bio-Rad) in a buffer containing 30 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, and 20% methanol. Membranes were blocked for 1 h with 5% powdered milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS)-Tween (2 mm Tris, 15 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.6), washed for 7 min three times in TBS-Tween, and then incubated for 1 h with primary antibody. Antibodies were diluted in TBS-Tween as follows: anti-His6, 1:1000; anti-NtrbohD, 1:500. Blots were washed and then incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies: anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) at a concentration of 0.4 mg/ml (1:5000). After washing twice for 10 min in TBS-Tween and once for 10 min in TBS, probing and detection were performed as described in the ECL Western blotting detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Isolation of Detergent-insoluble Membranes from Tobacco Leaf and BY2 Cell Plasma Membrane—Animal and yeast raft membranes can be isolated on the basis of their insolubility in nonionic detergents such as Triton X-100 at low temperature (see Introduction). To determine whether similar membrane domains form in tobacco membranes, we tried to isolate DIM from purified PM. We selected the conventional phase partitioning procedure (21Larsson C. Sommarin M. Widell S. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 228: 451-459Crossref Scopus (203) Google Scholar) to obtain a highly enriched PM fraction either from tobacco leaves or from tobacco BY2 cells. Typical preparations were enriched by a factor of 5–8 in the PM marker, vanadate-sensitive ATPase activity, compared with the starting material consisting of a crude microsomal fraction. Biochemical characterization of this PM fraction (Table I and Supplemental Table I) revealed that mitochondrial membranes were virtually free of the PM fraction. Endoplasmic reticulum marker enzyme was depleted by a factor of 7–8 between microsomes and PM; tonoplast was depleted by a factor of 20 in BY2 PM fraction and by a factor of 5 in the leaf PM fraction. We assayed the chlorophyll amount for thylakoid contamination (chlorophyll not detected; data not shown) and the presence of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (less than 0.5 mol % of total lipid; data not shown) for envelope contamination. These results showed that we were able to obtain highly enriched plasma membrane fractions from both tobacco leaves and BY2 cells.Table IIdentification by liquid chromatography/MS/MS of the major proteins of tobacco leaf (top) and BY2 cell (bottom) detergent-insoluble membraneBand.MWth.MWapp.Sp.IdentityAccession no.Sub. locationPeptide no.Sequence coverage%Tobacco leaf1105.1102.3LePlasma membrane ATPase 1sw P22180PM86.8270.775.2LeHeat shock cognate protein 2sw P27322C/PM57.6368.570.3BvV ATP synthase Asw Q39442V35.3465.468.5AtDIMINUTO proteinsw Q39085ER58.0548.952.3AbRuBisCO large chainsw O78262C/S410.2649.351.1DcElongation factor 1-αsw P29521C/PM711.1730.745.2LeProbable aquaporin PIPsw Q08451PM411.921.7StRemorinsw P93788PM212.6821.738.2StRemorinsw P93788PM318.2934.531.0NtCarbonic anhydrasesw P27141S/C/PM517.428.6Nt14-3-3-like protein Asw P93342C/PM622.71034.528.0NtCarbonic anhydrasesw P27141S/C/PM817.41130.724.6LeProbable aquaporin PIPsw Q08451PM411.91230.723.5LeProbable aquaporin PIPsw Q08451PM37.7BY2A105.2∼114NpPlasma membrane ATPase 4sw Q03194PM2017.6B80.1∼88LeHeat shock cognate protein 80sw P36181C34.7C70.7∼70LeHeat shock cognate protein 2sw P27322C59.568.7BnV ATP synthase subunit Asw Q39291PM1319.168.2AtDynamin-like proteinsw P42697PM/C22.1D49.9∼50GmTubulin β-1 chainsw P12459C611.949.3DcElongation factor 1-αsw P29521C/PM69.6E21.7∼35StRemorinsw P93788PM317.729.9AtSyntaxin 71sw Q9SF29PM612.0F28.9∼30St14-3-3-like protein 16Rsw P93784C/PM39.3G30.7∼25LeProbable aquaporin PIPsw Q08451PM27.7H∼22Unidentified Open table in a new tab To isolate DIM, we first tested different ratios of Triton X-100 to protein using leaf PM, incubated for 30 min at 4 °C using 1% Triton X-100 final concentration (Fig. 1). DIM were further isolated from solubilized material by their ability to float through a sucrose density gradient. Except for the ratio 60, a white and opaque band was easily discernable at 1.14 g/cm3 (i.e. below the 30–35% interface) (data not shown). The gradient separation was highly reproducible between experiments. As expected, the amount of DIM recovered from the gradient decreased when the amount of detergent increased (Fig. 1A). DIM lipid composition analysis evidenced a correlated enrichment in sphingolipids and sterols and a decrease of phospho- and glycoglycerolipid amounts with respect to PM. The maximum level of enrichment of both sterols and sphingolipids was reached when a ratio of Triton X-100 to protein of 15 was being used (Fig. 1, B and C). At this ratio, 9.3 ± 2% of the PM proteins were recovered after detergent treatment. Beyond this ratio, the amount of DIM recovered decreased dramatically without any further overall change in the lipid composition (Fig. 1A). We therefore established that a Triton X-100 treatment for 30 min at 4 °C with a ratio of Triton X-100 to protein of 15 (1% Triton X-100 final concentration) was suitable for DIM isolation from tobacco leaf PM. We used with success these conditions to isolate DIM from BY2 cell PM, although less than 3.3 ± 1% of PM proteins were recovered after the procedure (data not shown). Morphological Analysis of Tobacco Leaf Detergent-insoluble Membranes Compared with Plasma Membrane—The DIM was recovered by high speed centrifugation, observed by electron microscopy (see “Experimental Procedures”), and compared with the PM fraction used to prepare the DIM (Fig. 2). The PM fraction mainly contained closed membrane vesicles (Fig. 2A). Higher magnifications showed that the membrane leaflets were highly contrasted and ∼7.5 nm thick (Fig. 2B), which corresponds to in situ observations of PM in intact tobacco leaf cells (not illustrated here). DIM did not appear as vesicles but as more or less parallel membrane sheets, with some particulate material enclosed inside (Fig. 2C). The length of the membrane profiles was very variable, ranging from a few nanometers to several micrometers. The longer ones were often tightly associated with each other, either by small contact zones or by longer adhesion areas (Fig. 2D). Many membrane profiles were running tilted along the section and appeared either as cross-sectioned or parallel to the section plane. In the latter case, it could be easily shown that isolated DIM areas were organized as a network of ribbon-like structures (Fig. 2E). The width of these flat membrane fragments did not exceed 100 nm. The smallest DIM fragments were often clumped as dense aggregates at the ends of longer membrane sheets (Fig. 2F). Lipid Characterization of Tobacco Detergent-insoluble Membranes: Glucosylceramide and Free Sterols Are the Major Lipids—We combined HP-TLC, GC, and mass spectrometry to compare the lipid composition of the whole PM and DIM (Figs. 3 and 4). We first separated by HP-TLC polar lipids and stained them with primuline (Fig. 3A). The lipid composition of the PM fraction from tobacco leaf and from BY2 cells was first determined. Results are consistent with previous works on PM lipid analysis (e.g. see Refs. 22Gronewald J. AbouKhalil W. Weber E. Hansin J. Phytochemistry. 1982; 21: 859-862Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar and 23Bohn M. Heinz E. Luthje S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 387: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Briefly, phospholipids in both membranes composed ∼50% of total lipids, with major phospholipids being phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine. We detected DGDG (identity confirmed by mass spectrometry; data not shown) in leaf and BY2 cell PM. DGDG was previously acknowledged to be an exclusive plastidial lipid (24Douce R. Joyard J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 173-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, experimental evidence has been presented for the presence of this lipid outside plastids (e.g. see Ref. 25Hartel H. Dormann P. Benning C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10649-10654Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) particularly in highly purified plant PM (26Andersson M.X. Stri"
https://openalex.org/W2029094183,"Wnt is a family of secreted signaling proteins that regulate diverse developmental processes. Activation of canonical Wnt signaling by Wnt10b inhibits differentiation of preadipocytes in vitro. To determine whether Wnt signaling blocks adipogenesis in vivo, we created transgenic mice in which Wnt10b is expressed from the FABP4 promoter. Expression of Wnt10b in adipose impairs development of this tissue throughout the body, with a decline of ∼50% in total body fat and a reduction of ∼60% in weight of epididymal and perirenal depots. FABP4-Wnt10b mice resist accumulation of adipose tissue when fed a high fat diet. Furthermore, transgenic mice are more glucose-tolerant and insulin-sensitive than wild type mice. Expression of Wnt10b from the FABP4 promoter also blocks development of brown adipose tissue. Interscapular tissue of FABP4-Wnt10b mice has the visual appearance of white adipose tissue but expresses neither brown (e.g. uncoupling protein 1) nor white adipocyte markers. Transgenic mice are unable to maintain a core body temperature when placed in a cold environment, providing further evidence that Wnt10b inhibits development of brown adipose tissue. Although food intake is not altered in FABP4-Wnt10b mice, oxygen consumption is decreased. Thus, FABP4-Wnt10b mice on a chow diet gain more weight than controls, largely because of an increase in weight of skin.

The program followed by preadipocytes as they differentiate into adipocytes has been well characterized (1Lane M.D. Tang Q.Q. Jiang M.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Whether preadipocytes remain quiescent, divide, or differentiate is influenced by both inhibitory and stimulatory factors (4MacDougald O.A. Mandrup S. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 13: 5-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). One of the endogenous factors proposed to repress adipogenesis is Wnt10b, which belongs to a large family of secreted, cysteine-rich proteins that regulate diverse cellular processes, including development. Although Wnt regulates cell fate through several signaling pathways (5He X. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 791-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 6Veeman M.T. Axelrod J.D.

Cell. 2003; 5: 367-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar), activation of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway is sufficient to inhibit differentiation and apoptosis of preadipocytes (7Ross S.E.

Biol. 2003; 23: 5366-5375Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A model for the canonical signaling pathway has arisen from extensive genetic and biochemical studies. In the absence of Wnt, glycogen synthase kinase-3 phosphorylates β-catenin, which targets this protein for ubiquitin-mediated degradation by the proteasome. In the presence of Wnt, activation of Frizzled receptors and low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein coreceptors disrupts the complex of proteins that contain glycogen synthase kinase-3 and β-catenin. Hypophosphorylated β-catenin then accumulates in the cytosol, translocates to the nucleus, and binds to T-cell factor/lymphoid-enhancing factor transcription factors to mediate the effects of Wnt on gene transcription (5He X. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 791-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).Expression of Wnt does not influence the rapid and transient induction of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ, but Wnt completely blocks subsequent induction of the master adipogenic transcription factors C/EBPα and PPARγ. Although the mechanism is still under investigation, alterations in cell cycle regulatory proteins may mediate some of the actions of Wnt (12Ross S.E. Erickson R.L. Gerin I. DeRose P.M. Bajnok L. Longo D.A. Misek D.E. Kuick R. Hanask S.M. Atkins K.B. Maehle S. Nebb H.I. Madsen L. Kristiansen K. MacDougald O.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5989-5999Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Spontaneous adipogenesis occurs when Wnt signaling is inhibited in preadipocytes, indicating that preadipocytes produce an endogenous Wnt that represses differentiation. A good candidate for the endogenous signal is Wnt10b, because its expression is high in dividing and confluent preadipocytes and it is rapidly suppressed on induction of differentiation. In addition, ectopic expression of Wnt10b stabilizes free cytosolic β-catenin and inhibits adipogenesis. During differentiation, down-regulation of Wnt signaling components desensitizes preadipocytes to paracrine Wnt signals (8Bennett C.N. Ross S.E. Longo K.A. Bajnok L. Hemati N. Johnson K.W. Harrison S.D. MacDougald O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30998-31004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Induction of PPARγ during differentiation further suppresses responsivity to Wnt signaling by stimulating degradation of β-catenin by the proteasome (10Moldes M. Zuo Y. Morrison R.F. Silva D. Park B.H. Liu J. Farmer S.R. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 607-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar).To determine the effects of Wnt10b on adipose tissue development, we created transgenic mice in which Wnt10b is expressed from the fatty acid-binding protein-4 (FABP4) promoter. Our results demonstrate that FABP4-Wnt10b mice have a 50% reduction in body fat and resist diet-induced obesity. Repression of adipose tissue development by Wnt10b does not lead to lipodystrophic diabetes; instead, FABP4-Wnt10b mice show improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Finally, expression of Wnt10b blocks brown adipose tissue development as characterized by greatly reduced expression of brown adipocyte genes and sensitivity to the cold.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimals—All studies were approved by the University Committee on Use and Care of Animals and were overseen by the Unit for Laboratory Animal Medicine (University of Michigan). Transgenic mice that express mouse Wnt10b (GenBank accession number NM_011718 (13Lee F.S. Lane T.F. Kuo A. Shackleford G.M. Leder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2268-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar)) under control of the FABP4 promoter were created by the transgenic core facility at the University of Michigan (Fig. 1). Similar expression patterns and phenotypes are observed in three founder lines; however, studies reported herein are from a single transgenic line. FABP4-Wnt10b founders (C57BL/6 X SJL)F2 were backcrossed to C57BL/6 inbred mice, and progeny in N2–N4 generations were used for experiments. Based on quantitative PCR analysis, the FABP4 promoter expresses Wnt10b at ∼50-fold higher levels than endogenous Wnt10b in adipose tissues (data not shown).Diets—Where indicated, 4-week old mice were assigned to receive a low fat diet (10% fat, D12450B, Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ) or a high fat diet (45% fat, D12451, Research Diets).Expression of RNA—RNA was isolated from tissues with RNA Stat 60 (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX). Expression of endogenous genes and Wnt10b transgene was measured with RNase protection assays as described previously (14MacDougald O.A. Hwang C.-S. Fan H. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9034-9037Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Where indicated, expression of RNA was analyzed by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR. After digestion with DNase I, cDNA was synthesized using the TaqMan system (Applied Biosystems) and random hexamer primers. Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. SYBR green I dye was used to monitor amplification of DNA on the I-Cycler thermal cycler and IQ real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). All primers were verified with RNA from 3T3-L1 preadipocytes at confluence (day 0) and 4 days after induction of differentiation (day 4). Primer sequences are available on request. 2O. A. MacDougald, personal communication.Immunostaining of White Adipose Tissue—Gonadal white adipose tissue was dissected, fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, and embedded in paraffin. Sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and microwaved in citrate buffer for antigen retrieval. Sections were incubated in blocking buffer (2% normal goat serum, 1% bovine serum albumin, 1% ovalbumin in phosphate-buffered saline) and then with monoclonal antibody against insulin receptor substrate-1. After washes, sections were incubated with Alexafluor488 goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). After final washes, sections were counterstained with 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole-blue and visualized using fluorescence microscopy.Glucose and Insulin Tolerance Tests—For glucose tolerance, mice were injected intraperitoneally with 1.5 mg of glucose/g body weight at 9:00 a.m., after a 16-h fast. Blood glucose was determined at the indicated times with samples of tail blood obtained using the OneTouch Ultra™ glucometer (Lifescan, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada). For insulin sensitivity, insulin (0.5 units/kg body weight) was administered intraperitoneally, and blood samples were collected at the indicated times after administration of insulin. Blood glucose concentrations were determined as above.Core Body Temperature—Mice were surgically implanted with precalibrated telemeters (model TA-F20, Data Sciences International, St. Paul, MN) under deep anesthesia. Mice were housed at 27 °C with a 12-h light and dark cycle for at least 2 weeks after surgery. Core body temperatures for each animal were then recorded at an environmental temperature of 27 °C for 24 h and then at 4 °C for 72 h or until internal body temperature reached 30 °C. Data acquisition and analysis were performed on ICE-LUS™ software (Mark J. Opp, University of Michigan).Blood Chemistry—For all experiments, blood was collected between 9 a.m. and noon. The glucose level was determined from ocular blood using a OneTouch Ultra glucometer (Lifescan) in wild type (n = 18) and transgenic (n = 18) mice random fed on a chow diet. Serum insulin was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (CrystalChem, Downers Grove, IL) for wild type (n = 12) and transgenic (n = 12) mice. Serum leptin was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (CrystalChem) for wild type (n = 15) and FABP4-Wnt10b (n = 14) mice. Serum adiponectin was evaluated by immunoblot with antisera kindly provided by Mitchell A. Lazar (University of Pennsylvania). Serum-free fatty acids for wild type (n = 17) and transgenic (n = 17) mice were determined with the half-micro test (Roche Applied Science). Differences between genotypes were evaluated with Student's t test.Energy Balance and Body Composition—Food intake of individually housed wild type (n = 6) and FABP4-Wnt10b (n = 6) mice was determined using computer-monitored feeding chambers (Ugo Basile, Comerio, Italy). Measurement of oxygen consumption (VO2) with indirect calorimetry was performed on 8–12-week old mice over 4 days with the Oxymax™ System (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH). Animals were fed standard lab chow and nectar fluid and maintained on 12-h light and dark cycles beginning at 6 a.m. and 6 p.m, respectively. Animals were acclimated in measuring chambers for 2 weeks prior to recording. Measurements of VO2 were made every 24 min for each animal over a period of 4 days. Body composition was estimated with dual energy x-ray absorptiometry as described previously (15Feely R.S. Larkin L.M. Halter J.B. Dengel D.R. Exp. Gerontol. 2000; 35: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) but with pDEXA® SABRE™ software.

To determine whether signaling by Wnt10b blocks adipogenesis in vivo, we examined adiposity of transgenic mice that express Wnt10b from the well characterized mouse FABP4 promoter (Fig. 1A) (16Graves R.A. Tontonoz P. Ross S.R. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 428-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). As expected, the Wnt10b transgene is overexpressed in both white and brown adipose tissues (Fig. 1B), although expression in bone marrow is also observed. Some founder lines also express the Wnt10b transgene in heart (not shown). We were surprised to find that FABP4-Wnt10b mice have increased body weight compared with wild type littermates (Fig. 2A). To evaluate the mechanism of weight gain, we examined energy balance within these mice. Metabolic analyses revealed that oxygen consumption is decreased by an average of 7.4% in FABP4-Wnt10b mice (Fig 2B) with no difference observed in daily food intake (Fig. 2C). Although oxygen consumption was normalized to total body weight in Fig. 2B, similar results were obtained when oxygen consumption was expressed relative to lean body mass (data not shown). Although FABP4-Wnt10b mice are heavier, in part because of small increases in weight of liver and pancreas (Fig. 3A), the major contributor is a 50% (∼2.1 g) increase in weight of skin and hair (Fig. 3B). Although the epidermis and muscle layers of skin appear grossly normal, a dramatic expansion of the dermal layer, particularly the subcutis, is observed in FABP4-Wnt10b mice (Fig. 2D). Thickening of dermis may result from effects of Wnt10b on cell proliferation, collagen secretion, and/or apoptosis (9Longo K.A. Kennell J.A. Ochocinska M.J. Ross S.E. Wright W.S. MacDougald O.A. J.

Notably, far fewer adipocytes are observed in the skin of FABP4-Wnt10b mice, suggesting that Wnt10b inhibits adipogenesis in this depot.Fig. 2Analysis of energy balance in FABP4-Wnt10b transgenic mice.A, male and female transgenic mice are heavier than their wild type littermates.

B, FABP4-Wnt10b mice have 7.4% lower oxygen consumption than wild type mice (p < 0.001). Measurement of oxygen consumption (VO2) with indirect calorimetry was performed on 8–12-week-old wild type (black line, n = 8) and FABP4-Wnt10b (red line, n = 8) mice over 4 days. Measurements of VO2 were made every 24 min for each animal over a period of 4–6 days. Data are presented as a 5-point moving trend line. Reduced oxygen consumption in FABP4-Wnt10b mice is observed when expressed relative to total body weight or lean body mass. C, food intake is similar between wild type and FABP4-Wnt10b transgenic mice. Powdered chow consumption in wild type (filled bar, n = 6) and transgenic (hatched bar, n = 6) mice was monitored for 4 days. D, increased dermis and decreased adipocytes in skin are shown from FABP4-Wnt10b mice.

To quantify differences in adiposity, control and FABP4-Wnt10b mice were placed on a low fat or high fat diet for 20 weeks, and total body lipid was determined non-invasively with dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. FABP4-Wnt10b mice have ∼50% less total body fat when fed either a low fat or high fat diet (Fig. 4B). Likewise, epididymal and perirenal adipose depots are smaller in FABP4-Wnt10b mice that are fed low fat or high fat diets (Fig. 4, C and D). A similar reduction in adipose depots is observed on a chow diet (Fig. 3A).Fig. 4Wnt10b inhibits body fat accumulation and improves glucose tolerance in FABP4-Wnt10b transgenic mice.A, dorsal view of skinned wild type and FABP4-Wnt10b transgenic mice (left panels) as well as isolated epididymal and perirenal fat pads (right panels) after 39 weeks on a high fat diet. Wild type and FABP4-Wnt10b transgenic mice were fed a low fat or high fat diet for the times indicated. B, FABP4-Wnt10b mice have reduced fat. Estimation of the percentage of body fat was obtained by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry in male wild type (Wt) and FABP4-Wnt10b (Tg) mice fed on a low fat (LF) or high fat (HF) diet for 20 weeks. Data are expressed as mean ± S.D. (n = 8). Differences between genotypes were evaluated by analysis of variance with post-hoc Bonferroni adjustment.

WAT, white adipose tissue.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Molecular and Histological Characterization of Adipose Tissue—Expression of mRNAs for adipocyte genes such as C/EBPα, PPARγ, and FABP4, fatty-acid synthase, fat specific protein-27, lipoprotein lipase, leptin, resistin, and adiponectin is slightly lower in adipose tissue from FABP4-Wnt10b mice when normalized to 18 S RNA (Fig. 5A). In contrast, expression of the preadipocyte marker Pref-1 is similar between genotypes (Fig. 5A). Although this could indicate that expression of adipocyte genes is decreased on a per adipocyte basis, we favor the hypothesis that adipocyte gene expression is similar and that the reduced adipocyte signal is the result of a higher proportion of preadipocytes and other stromal vascular cells (and their 18 S RNA) in FABP4-Wnt10b mice. Consistent with this idea, histological analyses indicate that the number of adipocytes/unit area is similar but that the total number of nuclei is increased almost 3-fold in FABP4-Wnt10b adipose tissue (Fig. 5, B and C). Given that the majority of cells within adipose tissue are stromal vascular cells, a higher proportion of preadipocytes and/or other cell types will dilute the observed adipocyte gene expression. Expression of endothelial markers (i.e. Tie-1 and Tie-2) suggests that there are also proportionately more vascular cells (data not shown), consistent with our observation that Wnt signaling increases expression of vascular endothelial growth factor-C in preadipocytes (9Longo K.A.

Decreased adipose tissue mass without differences in adipocyte density indicates that FABP4-Wnt10b mice have fewer total adipocytes.Fig. 5Molecular and histological analyses of adipose tissue from FABP4-Wnt10b mice.A, RNA was isolated from epididymal adipose tissue of wild type (filled bars) and FABP4-Wnt10b (hatched bars) mice on a high fat diet.

Consistent with this lack of ectopic lipid accumulation and the well established relationship between amount of adipose tissue and whole body insulin resistance (17Kahn B.B. Flier J.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (2410) Google Scholar), FABP4-Wnt10b mice on a chow diet have increased glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity at 8 weeks of age (Fig. 6). Moreover, FABP4-Wnt10b mice resist the glucose intolerance caused by feeding a high fat diet for 20 weeks (Fig. 4E) and are more glucose-tolerant than wild type mice on a low fat diet (Fig. 4E). Thus, expression of Wnt10b from the FABP4 promoter inhibits development of white adipose tissue and improves whole body insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism, even when mice are challenged with a high fat diet.Fig. 6FABP4-Wnt10b mice have improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Wild type (▪, n = 8) and transgenic (□, n = 8) mice were fasted overnight for 16–18 h with free access to water. On the next morning, each mouse was weighed, and the base-line blood glucose level was determined with tail blood samples obtained by a OneTouch Ultra glucometer (Lifescan). A, data are shown for a glucose tolerance test. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 1.5 mg of glucose/g body weight. Blood glucose concentration (mg/dl) was determined from tail blood at the indicated times after administration of glucose, and data are presented as mean ± S.D. B, data are shown for an insulin tolerance test. Insulin (0.5 units/kg body weight) was administered intraperitoneally, and blood samples were collected at the indicated times after administration of insulin. Data are presented as a percentage of initial blood glucose (mean ± S.D.).

Total serum adiponectin was decreased by ∼90% in FABP4-Wnt10b mice as assessed by immunoblot analysis. This observation was unexpected in light of the reported inverse relationship between the percentage of body fat and adiponectin (18Berg A.H. Combs T.P. Scherer P.E. Trends Endocrinol.

The programs of white and brown adipogenesis share central components, such as PPARγ and C/EBPα; however, expression of PGC-1α during brown adipogenesis appears to play an important role in the expression of the thermogenic protein UCP-1 (2Rosen E.D.

However, it is still unclear whether four human Atg4 homologues cleave the carboxyl termini of the three human Atg8 homologues, microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3), GABARAP, and GATE-16. Using a cell-free system, we found that HsAtg4B, one of the human Atg4 homologues, cleaves the carboxyl termini of these three Atg8 homologues. In contrast, the mutant HsAtg4BC74A, in which a predicted active site Cys74 was changed to Ala, lacked proteolytic activity, indicating that Cys74 is essential for the cleavage activity of cysteine protease. Using phospholipase D, we showed that the modified forms of endogenous LC3 and GABARAP are lipidated and therefore were designated LC3-PL and GABARAP-PL. When purified glutathione S-transferase-tagged HsAtg4B was incubated in vitro with a membrane fraction enriched with endogenous LC3-PL and GABARAP-PL, the mobility of LC3-PL and GABARAP-PL was changed to those of the unmodified proteins. These mobility shifts were not seen when Cys74 of HsAtg4B was changed to Ala. Overexpression of wild-type HsAtg4B decreased the amount of LC3-PL and GABARAP-PL and increased the amount of unmodified endogenous LC3 and GABARAP in HeLa cells. Expression of CFP-tagged HsAtg4B (CFP-HsAtg4B) and YFP-tagged LC3 in HeLa cells under starvation conditions resulted in a significant decrease in the punctate pattern of distribution of YFP-tagged LC3 and an increase in its cytoplasmic distribution. RNA interference of HsAtg4B increased the amount of LC3-PL in HEK293 cells. Taken together, these results suggest that HsAtg4B negatively regulates the localization of LC3 to a membrane compartment by delipidation.

Autophagy is the bulk degradation of proteins and organelles, essential for cellular maintenance and cell viability. In yeast, the Atg/Apg/Aut/Cvt (cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting) proteins involved in autophagy have been identified and characterized (1Ohsumi Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Atg8 conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine (Atg8-PE) is localized to autophagosomes under starvation conditions and to Cvt vesicles under nutrient-rich conditions, and the atg4 mutant shows defects in autophagy and the Cvt pathway (5Kirisako T.

Interestingly, expression of a mutant form of Atg8 that has a carboxyl-terminal Gly (Atg8-G) in an atg4 mutant results in significantly more accumulation of the lipidated form of Atg8 than is found in a wild-type strain (5Kirisako T.

Taken together, these findings suggest that Atg4 may be important for the delipidation of Atg8-PE as well as for the cleavage of the carboxyl-terminal region of Atg8. It has not been shown, however, whether Atg4 directly delipidates Atg8-PE to Atg8 or indirectly activates an as yet unidentified delipidating enzyme.

At least four human Atg4 homologues, HsAtg4A/HsApg4A/autophagin-2, HsAtg4B/HsApg4B/autophagin-1, HsAutl1/autophagin-3, and autophagin-4, have been reported (30Scherz-Shouval R. Sagiv Y. Shorer H.

Since the carboxyl-terminal regions of LC3, GABARAP, and GATE-16 are cleaved soon after translation, it is possible that one or more of these Atg4 homologues is the cysteine protease that cleaves these proteins.

The overexpression of HsAtg4B or HsAutl1 has been found to suppress the Atg– and Cvt– phenotypes of the atg4 mutant (32Marino G. Uria J.A. Puente X.S. Quesada V. Bordallo J. Lopez-Otin C. J. Biol.

Although HsAtg4A and HsAutl1 have been independently characterized as cysteine proteases, HsAtg4B has not yet been biochemically characterized, nor have its effects on LC3, GABARAP, and GATE-16 been determined, whereas HsAtg4B has specific interactions with the carboxyl termini of LC3, GABARAP, GATE-16, and Atg8L (29Hemelaar J.

It is not known if LC3-II and GABARAP-II are lipidated forms of their respective proteins in mammals; nor has it been shown whether Atg4 and human Atg4 homologues directly delipidate Atg8-PE, LC3-II, and GABARAP-II in yeast and mammals. We have therefore investigated whether HsAtg4B can cleave the carboxyl termini of LC3, GABARAP, and GATE-16 in a cell-free system. We also investigated whether LC3-II and GABARAP-II are phospholipase D-sensitive forms (i.e. lipidated forms of LC3 and GABARAP, respectively) and whether HsAtg4B has delipidating activity in vitro. We also determined whether overexpression of HsAtg4B affects endogenous LC3 modification and the localization of YFP-tagged LC3 (YFP-LC3) in HeLa cells and whether RNA interference of HsAtg4B affects LC3 modification. Strains, Media, and Materials—Escherichia coli strain JM109, the host for plasmids and protein expression, was grown in LB medium in the presence of antibiotics as required. The plasmid pGEM-T was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI); pCMV-Tag2B was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA); pEGFP-C1, pECFP-C1, and pEYFP-C1 were from BD Biosciences Clontech (Palo Alto, CA); and pGEX-4T-1 was from Amersham Biosciences. Plasmid Construction and Site-directed Mutagenesis—Based on the DNA sequence of HsATG4A and HsAUTL1 (GenBank™ accession numbers AB066214 and AJ320169, respectively), the open reading frame of each was amplified by high fidelity PCR with human brain Marathon-ready cDNA as template. The cDNA was synthesized from RNA extracted from a normal, whole brain of a 50-year-old Caucasian male. The primers were designed to introduce a BglII site 5′ to the start codon and a SalI site 3′ to the termination codon. Each resulting DNA fragment was cloned in pGEM-T, and the resulting plasmids were designated as pGEM-HsATG4A and pGEM-HsAUTL1, respectively. Similarly, based on the DNA sequence of HsATG4B/HsAPG4B (GenBank™ accession number AB066215), its open reading frame was amplified by high fidelity PCR with human brain Marathon-ready cDNA as template, with the primers designed to introduce a BamHI site 5′ to the start codon and a SalI site 3′ to the termination codon. The resulting DNA fragment was cloned in pGEM-T, and the resultant plasmid was designated as pGEM-HsAtg4B. To express CFP-HsAtg4A, CFP-HsAutl1, and CFP-HsAtg4B under the control of the CMV promoter in mammalian cells, the cloned DNA fragments of pGEM-HsATG4A, pGEM-HsAUTL1, and pGEM-HsATG4B were introduced into the mammalian expression vector, pECFP-C1 (BD Biosciences Clontech) and designated as pCFP-HsATG4A, pCFP-HsAUTL1, and pCFP-HsATG4B, respectively. To express FLAG-tagged proteins, the cloned DNA fragments of pGEM-HsATG4A, pGEM-HsAUTL1, and pGEM-HsATG4B were introduced into the vector, pCMV-Tag2B (Stratagene), and designated as pTag2B-HsATG4A, pTag2B-HsAUTL1, and pTag2B-HsATG4B, respectively. To express GST-tagged proteins in E. coli, the cloned DNA fragments of pGEM-HsATG4A, pGEM-HsAUTL1, and pGEM-HsATG4B were introduced into the vector, pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) and designated as pGEX-HsATG4A, pGEX-HsAUTL1, and pGEX-HsATG4B, respectively. The human Atg8 homologues LC3, GABARAP, and GATE-16 were fused with thioredoxin-His6 at the amino terminus and with the Myc epitope at the carboxyl terminus by introducing six His repeats into the amino-terminal region of each Atg8 homologue by high fidelity PCR and subsequently introducing the Myc epitope directly 3′ to each sequence. Each resultant DNA fragment was cloned in the vector pThioHisA (Invitrogen), and each construct was used to transform E. coli (Fig. 1B). To express YFP-LC3, a BglII-SalI fragment of pGEM-LC3 was introduced into the BglII-SalI site of the vector pEYFP-C1 (BD Biosciences Clontech), and the resulting construct was designated as pYFP-LC3. The Cys residue at amino acid 74 of HsAtg4B was replaced by Ala using the Gene-Editor in vitro site-directed mutagenesis system (Promega) and the oligonucleotide, 5′-CCCACCTCGGACACAGGCTGGGGCGGCCATGCTGCGGTGTGGACAGATGATCTTTGCCC-3′ (HsA-TG4BCA oligonucleotide), according to the manufacturer's directions. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 and HeLa cells obtained from the ATCC (Manassas, VA), were grown in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). Cells were transfected with the indicated constructs using LipofectAMINE 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 48 h, the cells were harvested for further analyses. Antibodies—Rabbits were immunized with GST-HsAtg4A, GST-HsAtg4B, and GST-HsAutl1 to obtain antisera against HsAtg4A, HsAtg4B, and HsAutl1, respectively. Each antibody was affinity-purified by chromatography on each thioredoxin (TRX)-linked antigen-Sepharose and designated as anti-HsAtg4A, anti-HsAtg4B, and anti-HsAutl1 antibodies, respectively. Anti-LC3 and anti-GABARAP antibodies were prepared as described previously. Anti-LC3 antibody shows little cross-reactivity with GABARAP and GATE-16. Anti-GABARAP antibody shows little cross-reactivity with LC3 and GATE-16. Anti-Myc antibody was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA), and anti-TRX antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Purification of Recombinant Proteins—The purification of GST fusion proteins from E. coli was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). The purification of LC3-Myc, GABARAP-Myc, and GATE-16-Myc, each with a His6 tag, was performed using TALON purification kits according to the manufacturer's protocol (BD Biosciences Clontech). Assay for Cleavage of the Carboxyl Terminus of LC3-Myc, GABARAP-Myc, and GATE-16-Myc by Human Atg4 Homologues—FLAG-tagged HsAtg4A/autophagin-2 (FLAG-HsAtg4A), FLAG-tagged HsAtg4B/autophagin-1 (FLAG-HsAtg4B), and FLAG-tagged HsAutl1/autophagin-3 (FLAG-HsAutl1) were expressed in HEK293 cells using pTag2B-HsAtg4A, pTag2B-HsAtg4B, and pTag2B-HsAutl1, respectively. Cells were lysed in phosphate-buffered saline-dithiothreitol buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing a Complete™ proteinase inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science), and supernatant was prepared from each lysate as described previously (34Nemoto T. Tanida I. Tanida-Miyake E. Minematsu-Ikeguchi N. Yokota M. Ohsumi M. Ueno T. Kominami E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39517-39526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Supernatant (0.4 μg) of each lysate was added to 3.6 μg purified LC3-Myc, GABARAP-Myc, or GATE-16-Myc in phosphate-buffered saline-dithiothreitol buffer containing a Complete™ proteinase inhibitor mixture tablet, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times (0, 30, and 60 min). To stop the reaction, Laemmli's sample buffer was added to the mixture, and the mixture was boiled for 5 min. Proteins were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Myc and anti-TRX antibodies. Preparation of a Pelletable Fraction Enriched with Modified Forms of LC3 (LC3-II) and GABARAP (GABARAP-II) as Substrates of the Delipidation Assay—Endogenous LC3 and GABARAP in HeLa cells were present as modified forms, even under nutrient-rich conditions. 2I. Tanida, T. Ueno, and E. Kominami, unpublished results. HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FCS in the presence of E64d (10 μg/ml) and pepstatin A (10 μg/ml) to enrich for LC3-II and GABARAP-II. The cells were lysed in phosphate-buffered saline by sonication, and total pellets were prepared by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The LC3-II- and GABARAP-II-enriched pellet fraction (TM fraction) was employed as substrates for treatment with phospholipase D and GST-HsAtg4B. Assay for Delipidation of LC3-II and GABARAP-II by Phospholipase D—Phospholipase D (from Streptomyces chromofuscus) was purchased from Sigma. LC3-II was solubilized from 45 μg of the TM fraction in TX solution (2% Triton X-100, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl), 10 units of phospholipase D were added, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times. To stop the reaction, Laemmli's sample buffer was added to the mixture, and the mixture was boiled for 5 min. Total proteins were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE, and LC3 was assayed by immunoblotting with an anti-LC3 antibody. Delipidation of LC3-II (membrane-bound form) was recognized as a change in mobility. To assay delipidation of GABARAP-II, the latter was solubilized from 90 μg of the TM fraction in NP solution (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl), and the sample was treated with phospholipase D as described above. GABARAP was assayed by immunoblotting with an anti-GABARAP antibody. Delipidation of GABARAP-II was recognized as a change in mobility. Assay for Delipidation of LC3-II and GABARAP-II by Purified GST-HsAtg4B—To assay delipidation of LC3-II and GABARAP-II by GST-HsAtg4B, 0.45 μg of GST-HsAtg4B was added in place of phospholipase Dto45 μg of the TM fraction, and the assay was performed as described above. Fluorescent Microscopy—HeLa cells expressing CFP-HsAtg4B and YFP-LC3 were fixed according to the manufacturer's protocol (BD Biosciences Clontech), and cyan and yellow fluorescences in HeLa cells were observed with a Zeiss Axioplan2 fluorescence microscope with filters XF114-2 and XF104-2. RNA Interference Analysis of HsAtg4B—Double-stranded RNAs of HsAtg4B were produced by a BLOCK-it™ Complete Dicer RNAi kit with a DNA template containing the region from start codon to 500 base of HsAtg4B cDNA as a template according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). For RNA interference of HsAtg4B, 2 μg of dsRNA of HsAtg4B/60-mm culture dish was transfected into HEK293 cells using LipofectAMINE 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 24 h, the cells were harvested for further analyses. For plasmid-based RNA interference of HsATG4B, two oligonucleotides, siT4 (5′-GATCCGAAGCTTGCTGTCTTCGATTTCAAGAGAATCGAAGACAGCAAGCTTCTTTTTTGGAAA-3′) and siB4 (5′-AGCTTTTCCAAAAAAGAAGCTTGCTGTCTTCGATTCTCTTGAAATCGAAGACAGCAAGCTTCG-3′), were synthesized. After annealing these oligonucleotides, the resultant fragment was introduced into a BamHI-HindIII site of pSilencer H1–3.0 (Ambion, Austin, TX), and the resulting construct was designated as pSi-HsATG4B. For RNA interference of HsA-tg4B, 6 μg of pSi-HsATG4B per 60-mm culture dish was transfected into HEK293 cells using LipofectAMINE 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen). After 24 h, the cells were harvested for further analyses. Other Techniques—Quantification of the images was performed using Aqua Lite (Hamamatsu Photonics, Tokyo, Japan) and NIH Image (Dr. W. Raeband, National Institutes of Health) programs on Endeavor (EPSON direct, Tokyo, Japan) and Macintosh G4 (Apple Computer, New York) computers, respectively. The Cys74 Residue in HsAtg4B Is an Authentic Active Site Cysteine Essential for the Ability of This Protein to Cleave the Carboxyl Termini of the Three Atg8 Homologues—Although the carboxyl termini of LC3, GABARAP, and GATE-16 are cleaved to expose a Gly soon after translation (21Kabeya Y.

However, the region containing a predicted active site Cys within HsAtg4B shows a significant homology with that within yeast Atg4 (Fig. 1A). Therefore, we focused on HsAtg4B and determined its proteolytic activity on the carboxyl termini of LC3, GABARAP, and GATE-16. FLAG-HsAtg4B was expressed in HEK293 cells, the cells were lysed, and the lysate was fractionated by ultracentrifugation, with the resulting supernatant used as enzyme mixture. HsAtg4B in the supernatant was recognized by immunoblotting with an anti-FLAG-antibody (Fig. 1B, pTag2B-HsATG4B wt, +). The substrates, LC3-Myc, GABARAP-Myc, and GATE-16-Myc with TRX-His6 at the amino terminus and with the Myc epitope at the carboxyl terminus were expressed in E. coli and affinity-purified by a nickel-chelating resin. We incubated FLAG-HsAtg4B with each Myc-linked Atg8 homologue and determined the carboxyl-terminal cleavage activity by immunoblotting using an anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 1C, WB: anti-Myc, HsAtg4B versus vector control). FLAG-HsAtg4B cleaved the carboxyl terminus of Myc conjugate LC3, GABARAP, and GATE-16 in a time-dependent manner. Using an anti-TRX antibody, we were able to confirm that the amino-terminal TRX tag within each substrate remains unchanged (Fig. 1C, anti-TRX), indicating that the carboxyl-terminal Myc tag itself was cleaved by HsAtg4B. Essentially the same results were obtained when purified GST-HsAtg4B, instead of the supernatant expressing FLAG-HsAtg4B, was incubated with Myc-linked Atg8 homologues (data not shown). The cleavage is sensitive to N-ethylmaleimide, but not to phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride or pepstatin A (data not shown). These results show that the HsAtg4B protease cleaves the carboxyl termini of all"

However, the molecular mechanism by which these mutations might lead to the disease is not understood. Here, we show that four of the FTDP-17 tau mutations, R406W, V337M, G272V, and P301L, result in tau proteins that are more favorable substrates for phosphorylation by brain protein kinases than the wild-type, largest four-repeat protein τ4L and τ4L more than τ3L. In general, at all the sites studied, mutant tau proteins were phosphorylated faster and to a higher extent than τ4L and τ4L > τ3L. The most dramatic difference found was in the rate and level of phosphorylation of τ4LR406W at positions Ser-396, Ser-400, Thr-403, and Ser-404. Phosphorylation of this mutant tau was 12 times faster and 400% greater at Ser-396 and less than 30% at Ser-400, Thr-403, and Ser-404 than phosphorylation of τ4L. The mutated tau proteins polymerized into filaments when 4–6 mol of phosphate per mol of tau were incorporated, whereas wild-type tau required ∼10 mol of phosphate per mol of protein to self-assemble. Mutated and wild-type tau proteins were able to sequester normal tau upon incorporation of ∼4 mol of phosphate per mol of protein, which was achieved at as early as 30 min of phosphorylation in the case of mutant tau proteins. These findings taken together suggest that the mutations in tau might cause neurodegeneration by making the protein a more favorable substrate for hyperphosphorylation.

Pathological tau aggregation in the form of filaments is increasingly recognized as a common denominator underlying a variety of dementias called tauopathies, which include Alzheimer disease (AD), 1The abbreviations used are: AD, Alzheimer disease; AD P-tau, abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau; FTDP-17, frontotemporal dementia with Parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17; PHF, paired helical filaments; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: AD, Alzheimer disease; AD P-tau, abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau; FTDP-17, frontotemporal dementia with Parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17; PHF, paired helical filaments; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. frontotemporal dementia with Parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17), amytrophic lateral sclerosis, cortical basal degeneration, dementia pugilistica, Pick disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, and tangle-only dementia. Despite their diverse topographic and phenotypic manifestations, these tauopathies are linked to the progressive accumulation of filamentous, hyperphosphorylated tau inclusions. The discovery of the co-segregation of certain mutations in the tau gene with the disease in inherited cases of FTDP-17 has confirmed that tau abnormalities that are seen in tauopathies as neurofibrillary degeneration are disease-causative (1Hutton M.

It is a family of six proteins derived from a single gene by alternative mRNA splicing (4Himmler A. Drechsel D. Kirschner M.W. Martin Jr., D.W. Mol. Cell.

They differ in whether they contain 3 (τ3L, τ3S, or τ3) or 4 (τ4L, τ4S, or τ4) tubulin binding domains/repeats (R) of 31 or 32 amino acids each near the C terminus and 2 (τ3L, τ4L), 1 (τ3S, τ4S), or no (τ3, τ4) inserts of 29 amino acids each in the N-terminal portion of the molecule. In AD, all six isoforms have been reported to be present in a hyperphosphorylated state in paired helical filaments (PHFs), which form neurofibrillary tangles (6Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Quinlan M.

Microtubules are required for axoplasmic transport, and in the tangle-bearing neurons of patients with AD, the microtubule system is destroyed and replaced by PHFs.In inherited FTDP-17 certain mutations in tau gene cosegregate with the disease. These mutations are missense, intronic, and deletions of single amino acids. The missense mutations result in the substitution of one amino acid, and it has been reported that these mutations compromise tau ability to promote microtubule assembly (9Hong M. Zhukareva V.

Like patients with AD, FTDP-17 patients show accumulations of hyperphosphorylated tau in the form of neurofibrillary tangles.

(i) The FTDP-17 mutations R406W, V337M, G272V, and P301L make tau more favorable for hyperphosphorylation, (ii) τ4L is a more favorable substrate for kinases than τ3L, (iii) the mutated tau proteins polymerize into filaments at lower levels of phosphate incorporation (4–6 mol of phosphate/mol of tau) than wild-type tau (∼10 mol of phosphate per mol of protein), and (iv) upon incorporation of ∼4 mol of phosphate per mol of protein, the hyperphosphorylated tau is able to sequester normal tau. These findings taken together suggest that mutations in tau might cause neurodegeneration through rendering a molecule that is a favorable substrate for kinases which polymerizes at lower levels of phosphorylation and that becomes “toxic” to the microtubule system by sequestering normal tau.MATERIALS AND METHODSAntibodies—The following phosphorylation-dependent tau antibodies were employed: Tau-1, 1:50,000 (Ser-195, Ser-198, Ser-199, or Ser-202 (7Grundke-Iqbal I.

The pET17b vector in combination with suitable Escherichia coli strains (DH5alfa for cloning and BL21DE3 for protein expression) represents an inducible T7-promotor expression system (30Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5987) Google Scholar).The pET17b plasmids carrying cDNA of the human genes for τ3L and τ4L isoforms were produced by PCR amplification of tau cDNAs from pRK172/τ3L or pRK172/τ4L vectors kindly provided by Dr. Michel Goedert. Specific primers, including translation initiation start (ATG) and stop (TGA) codons and NdeI and EcoRI-cloning restriction sites, were used.Four pET17b plasmids bearing genes for τ4L with FTDP17 point mutation G272V, P301L, V337M, or R406W (Fig. 1A) were produced. The numbering of amino acids refers to the longest human brain tau isoform τ441. Mutagenesis was achieved by inverse PCR amplification of the pET/tau vector with inverted primers, one of which bore the point mutation. Vent thermostable DNA polymerase was used because of its proofreading activity and production of blunt ends. Amplified linearized plasmids were gel-purified, and after treating with T4 polynucleotide kinase in T4 ligase ligation buffer for 30 min at 37 °C and religation (T4 ligase ligation buffer plus 5% polyethylene glycol and 10 mm dithiothreitol for 1 h at room temperature) were transformed in DH5alfa cells for screening and plasmid isolation (Qiaprep Miniprep kit, Qiagen). Each selected construct was verified by DNA sequencing with one primer in the middle of the tau gene and two primers complementary to vector sequences flanking the insert (BigDye Terminator Ready Reaction kit, ABI Prism377 Sequencer, PerkinElmer Life Sciences).Isolation of Recombinant Human Brain Tau Proteins—The tau constructs were subcloned, and recombinant human tau proteins were purified as described (31Singh T.J.

The reaction was carried out at 35 °C in 60 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 8 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm ATP, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 nm calyculin A, 1 mm 4-[2-aminoethylamino]-benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF, a serine protease inhibitor) and from 0.1–0.5 mg/ml tau protein and 0.25–0.5 mg/ml of brain extract. The brain extract was prepared fresh before the phosphorylation reaction. After 2 and 8 h of incubation NaF (17 mm) and ATP (2 mm), respectively, were added. The mol of 32P/mol of tau was calculated using [γ-32P]ATP of a known specific activity and, as control, the brain extract without exogenous tau. To determine the amount of radioactivity bound to tau, 2 μl of the incubation mixture was dotted on Whatman chromatographic paper prespotted with 5 μl of 20% trichloroacetic acid containing 2 mm ATP and 200 mm NaCl. The samples were subjected to ascending chromatography to separate the free 32P from protein-incorporated 32P. The latter was counted, and the mol of phosphate per mol of tau were calculated from the specific radioactivity after subtracting the corresponding value of the enzyme alone control.Mapping of Phosphorylation Sites with Phospho-dependent Antibodies to Tau—The sites phosphorylated in tau were mapped by using the phospho-dependent tau antibodies listed above by Western blots. A 5-μl sample of the phosphorylation reaction mixture was taken at 1.5, 3, 4.5, 6, 10, 20, and 22 h of incubation and subjected to SDS-PAGE (50 ng of tau per lane). The rate of phosphorylation was compared at Thr-181, Ser-199, Ser-202, Thr-205, Thr-212, Ser-214, Thr-217, Thr-231, Ser-235, Ser-262, Ser-396, Ser-404, and Ser-422 using specific phospho-dependent antibodies. Once we identified the specific sites that were differentially phosphorylated, we quantitated the specific differences. The phosphorylated proteins were dotted in different amounts (0.5, 1, 5, 10 ng per dot) on nitrocellulose membranes, blocked with bovine serum albumin, and developed with the phospho-dependent antibodies selected above. We employed a mixture of rabbit polyclonal antibodies, 92e, 134d, and 111e, against total tau to assay the levels of total tau. 125I-Labeled secondary antibodies were used to quantitate the immunoreactivity. The ratio between tau immunoreactivity with a phospho-dependent antibody to that of a phospho-independent antibody (92e, 134d, and 111e) was used to normalize the phosphorylation of tau at a particular site.Self-assembly of Tau—Wild-type and mutant tau self-assembly was induced by hyperphosphorylation, with the brain extract as a source of kinases as described above. The polymerization of mutated tau proteins phosphorylated by different kinases was compared by negative-stain electron microscopy. From the phosphorylation reaction mixture described above, 10 μl at different incubation times (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 22 h) were applied on a 300-mesh carbon-coated grid and negatively stained with 2% phosphotungstic acid as described previously (20Alonso A.delC.

Neurol. 1984; 43: 643-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The percentage of aggregated protein was determined by centrifuging an aliquot (10 μl) of the incubation mixture at 30,000 × g for 20 min in a Beckman TL-100 ultracentrifuge at different times to separate the aggregated from the soluble protein pool. The amount of tau in each fraction was quantified as above by radioimmuno dot blots developed with a mixture of three phospho-independent tau antibodies 92e, 134d, and 111e.Association of Normal Tau to the Hyperphosphorylated Tau—The binding of the in vitro hyperphosphorylated tau to normal tau was studied by a dot overlay assay (20Alonso A.delC. Zaidi T. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5562-5566Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 34Kremer L. Dominguez J.E. Avila J. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 175: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). For the dot overlay assay, in vitro hyperphosphorylated tau proteins (10–100 ng) were spotted on nitrocellulose and blocked with 5% fat-free dry milk in 100 mm Mes buffer, pH 6.7, for 1 h. After blocking, the membrane was overlaid with normal tau (3–6 μg/ml) for 3 h. The unbound tau was removed by washing the membrane, and the bound tau was fixed with 0.5% form-aldehyde. After fixation, the bound tau was detected with Tau-1 antibody, which recognizes tau unphosphorylated at Ser-195/198/199/202. Samples in which overlay with normal tau was substituted with bovine serum albumin were used to deduct any background binding of Tau-1 to the hyperphosphorylated tau.Immunoblots, Protein, and Tau Assays—Protein concentration was estimated by the method of Bensadoun and Weinstein (35Bensadoun A. Weinstein D. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 70: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2729) Google Scholar). Sample preparation and immunoblots were carried out as described previously (6Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Quinlan M. Tung Y.-C. Zaidi M.S. Wisniewski H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6084-6089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The levels of recombinant tau isoforms and AD P-tau were determined by the radioimmuno-slot blot method of Khatoon et al. (36Khatoon S. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 750-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) using a mixture of three phospho-independent tau antibodies, 92e, 134d, and 111e.RESULTSExpression and Isolation of τ4L, τ3L, and Mutant Tau τ4LR406W, τ4LV337M, τ4LG272V, and τ4LP301L—Four pET17b plasmids bearing genes for τ3L, τ4L, and τ4L with FTDP17 point mutation G272V, P301L, V337M, or R406W were produced (Fig. 1A). Each selected construct was verified by DNA sequencing with one primer in the middle of the tau gene and two primers complementary to vector sequences flanking the insert (data not shown). The tau proteins (Fig. 1A) were expressed and purified from E. coli. We previously showed that although tau is heat-and acid-stable, these treatments abolished its ability to self-polymerize into short PHF-like filaments (32Alonso A.delC. Zaidi T. Novak M. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6923-6928Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). For this reason, we purified recombinant proteins without any steps using heat or acid treatment. The isolation procedure yielded ∼5 mg of >95% pure protein per 500 ml of bacterial culture (Fig. 1B).The FTDP17 point mutations in recombinant tau40 protein did not cause any drastic property change compared with τ4L. The bacterial expression yield and behavior in the fast protein liquid chromatography purification were identical to those of normal tau. The point mutations did not increase toxicity for E. coli or different apparent thermostabilities of purified protein. All the FTDP-17 mutant tau proteins migrated to the same apparent molecular weight in SDS-PAGE, suggesting no apparent conformational change in the mutant versus the wild-type tau proteins, at least in the denaturing conditions (Fig. 1B).Comparison of Mutated τ4LR406W, τ4LV337M, τ4LG272V, and τ4LP301L with Wild-type τ4L and τ3L as Substrates for Hyperphosphorylation—We postulated that FTDP-17-mutated tau proteins are more favorable substrates than the wild-type tau for abnormal hyperphosphorylation. To test this hypothesis, we in vitro hyperphosphorylated recombinant wild-type and mutated tau proteins with normal rat brain extract as a source of kinases. Phosphorylation of τ4L with the brain extract resulted in ∼12 mol of phosphate per mol of the protein during ∼20 h, whereas the extent of phosphorylation was much higher for all the mutated tau proteins examined, i.e. ∼13–18 mol of phosphate per mol of τ4LR406W, τ4LV337M, τ4LP301L, and τ4LG272V (Fig. 2A). Not only the stoichiometry but also the kinetics of phosphorylation were more favorable for phosphorylation of the mutated tau proteins. The kinetics of phosphorylation was more favorable for τ4L than for τ3L, although the net levels of phosphorylation were only ∼10% less for τ3L. Phosphorylation is known to retard the mobility of tau in SDS-PAGE (7Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Tung Y.-C. Quinlan M. Wisniewski H.M. Binder L.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4913-4917Crossref PubMed Scopus (2816) Google Scholar). We analyzed the electrophoretic patterns of wild-type and mutant tau proteins as a function of the phosphorylation time by Western blots using antibodies against total tau (Fig. 2B). As the phosphorylation reaction progressed, there was an upward mobility shift of tau that corresponded to the higher levels of phosphorylation. For example, at 3 h of phosphorylation two bands were seen, and the proportion of the upper band was higher for mutant tau proteins (percentages calculated from scanning of the blots: 44% for τ4LR406W, 46% for τ4LV337M, 42% for τ4LP301L, and 51% for τ4LG272V as compared with 35% for τ4L and 27% for τ3L). These mobility shift data suggested that mutant tau proteins were probably phosphorylated more readily than τ4L and τ3L.Fig. 2A, time course of 32P incorporation into wild-type τ4L and τ3L and mutated τ4LR406W, τ4LV337M, τ4LG272V, and τ4LP301L. Wild-type τ4L and τ3L and mutated τ4LR406W, τ4LV337M, τ4LG272V, and τ4LP301L, 0.5 mg/ml, were incubated with rat brain extract as a source of brain kinases in the presence of ATP to induce hyperphosphorylation. Mutated τ4LR406W, τ4LV337M, τ4LG272V, and τ4LP301L incorporated more moles of phosphate per mole of tau than wild-type τ4L. B, Western blots of incorporation of phosphate into wild-type τ4L, τ3L and mutated τ4LR406W, τ4LV337M, τ4LG272V, and τ4LP301L. Aliquots of the above phosphorylation reaction mixtures were taken at different incubation times and analyzed by Western blots developed with a mixture of phosphorylation-independent polyclonal antibodies against tau.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The higher phosphorylation stoichiometry of mutant tau proteins compared with wild-type tau indicated an increase in phosphorylation of more than a single site. To identify the phosphorylation sites responsible for hyperphosphorylation, we studied tau phosphorylation at various sites. For each phospho-epitope, the immunoreactivity was determined at each time point of the phosphorylation reaction, and that amount was normalized to the total amount of tau present in the sample (specific immunoreactivity). The specific immunoreactivity was obtained for each antibody and each time point and plotted as a function of time. From these plots, three different parameters could be determined; they are the rate of phosphorylation at each particular site from the slope of the curve at the starting time (initial velocity), the highest amount of phosphorylation at that site (from the plateau of the same curve), and the time needed to reach 50% of the total phosphorylation of the particular site in τ4L. Because there are no standards for each antibody, only the relative level of phosphorylation, but not the absolute values, can be calculated. The values obtained for τ4L at each site were taken as 100%, and all the others were expressed relative to those of τ4L. The calculated rates of phosphorylation, average results of three to six independent experiments, are shown in Fig. 3A. In general τ4L was a more favorable substrate for kinases than τ3L, since the rate of phosphorylation at almost all the sites investigated was lower (less than 100%) for τ3L (Fig. 3A). The total level of phosphorylation was slightly lower for τ3L than for τ4L (from 70–90%, Fig. 3B) at most of the sites studied. All the mutant tau proteins investigated were found to be more favorable substrates for phosphorylation than τ4L in both the rate (Fig 3A) and the total level of phosphorylation (Figs. 2 and 3B). In general, τ4L was a more favorable substrate than τ3L, and the mutant tau proteins were more favorable than τ4L for phosphorylation.Fig. 3A, rate of phosphorylation (A) and total phosphorylation (B) at positions Thr-181, Ser-199, Ser-202, Thr-205, Thr-212, Thr-217, Ser-262, Thr-231, Ser-235, Ser-396, Ser-404, and Ser-422 of τ3L and mutant tau proteins (τ4LG272V, τ4LP301L, τ4LV337M, and τ4LR406W) compared with τ4L. τ4L, τ3L, τ4LG272V, τ4LP301L, τ4LV337M, and τ4LR406W were phosphorylated with rat brain extract as a source of kinases. The phosphorylation at each site was determined using phospho-dependent antibodies to specific sites. The rates of phosphorylation (A) were calculated from the slope of initial reaction of specific phosphorylation at each site as a function of time. The total phosphorylation level (B) was calculated from the saturation levels of phosphorylation as a function of time. Both values are expressed relative to τ4L (100% at each site). The positions of the amino acids phosphorylated are indicated on the x axis. The bar represents S.D.; *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.005; ***, p < 0.0005. C, time needed for each site of the tau indicated in each panel to achieve 50% of the maximal phosphorylation of that site in τ4L (open bars). At each position, the second bar (filled bars) represents the time for τ4L to achieve 50% of its maximal phosphorylation level. The bar represents S.D.; *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.005; ***, p < 0.0005.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To compare the rates of phosphorylation of tau at each site, we determined the time it took for each mutant and for τ3L (Fig. 3C) to achieve 50% of the phosphorylation level of τ4L at a particular site. These results suggested that mutations in tau induced conformational changes, making it a more favorable substrate for overall phosphorylation. The most remarkable change was the one induced by the R406W mutation. This mutation reduced the time for half-maximal phosphorylation at Ser-396 from ∼ 8 h in τ4L to ∼2 h in τ4LR406W (see panel τ4LR406W). The dramatic increase in the phosphorylation of τ4LR406W at Ser-396 (Fig. 3C) resulted in a marked decrease in phosphorylation at positions 400, 403 (data not shown), and 404 (Fig. 3C).Polymerization of Mutated Taus upon Hyperphosphorylation—We previously showed that p"
https://openalex.org/W2008962463,"The fasting-induced adipose factor (FIAF, ANGPTL4, PGAR, HFARP) was previously identified as a novel adipocytokine that was up-regulated by fasting, by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonists, and by hypoxia. To further characterize FIAF, we studied regulation of FIAF mRNA and protein in liver and adipose cell lines as well as in human and mouse plasma. Expression of FIAF mRNA was up-regulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) and PPARβ/δ agonists in rat and human hepatoma cell lines and by PPARγ and PPARβ/δ agonists in mouse and human adipocytes. Transactivation, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and gel shift experiments identified a functional PPAR response element within intron 3 of the FIAF gene. At the protein level, in human and mouse blood plasma, FIAF was found to be present both as the native protein and in a truncated form. Differentiation of mouse 3T3-L1 adipocytes was associated with the production of truncated FIAF, whereas in human white adipose tissue and SGBS adipocytes, only native FIAF could be detected. Interestingly, truncated FIAF was produced by human liver. Treatment with fenofibrate, a potent PPARα agonist, markedly increased plasma levels of truncated FIAF, but not native FIAF, in humans. Levels of both truncated and native FIAF showed marked interindividual variation but were not associated with body mass index and were not influenced by prolonged semistarvation. Together, these data suggest that FIAF, similar to other adipocytokines such as adiponectin, may partially exert its function via a truncated form.

Obesity, defined as excess body fat, is associated with numerous secondary ailments, including hypertension, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance, and is therefore an important health concern. As the prevalence of obesity is rising, there is an increasing interest in understanding the metabolic behavior of adipose tissue. Since the discovery of leptin in 1994 (1Zhang Y. Proenca R. Maffei M. Barone M. Leopold L. Friedman J.M. Nature. 1994; 372: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (11807) Google Scholar), it has become clear that fat tissue not merely serves to store excess energy but also has an important endocrine function (2Ahima R.S.

They have been implicated in a variety of different processes, ranging from blood pressure control to lipid metabolism and insulin sensitizing. Consequently, it has been tempting to attribute many of the clinical abnormalities associated with obesity, including insulin resistance, to altered secretion of particular adipocytokines. Recently, we and others identified a new gene encoding the secreted fasting-induced adipose factor (FIAF), also known as PGAR (for PPARγ angiopoietin-related protein), ANGPTL4 (for angiopoietin-like protein 4), or HFARP (for hepatic fibrinogen/angiopoietin-related protein) (15Kersten S.

Expression of FIAF is dramatically up-regulated during hypoxia in both endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes (18Belanger A.J. Lu H. Date T. Liu L.X. Vincent K.A. Akita G.Y. Cheng S.H. Gregory R.J.

Subsequently, it was found that FIAF is able to induce a strong proangiogenic response in the chicken chorioallantoic membrane assay (19Le Jan S. Amy C. Cazes A. Monnot C. Lamande N. Favier J.

FIAF has also been proposed to act as an apoptosis survival factor in vascular endothelial cells (16Kim I. Kim H.G. Kim H. Kim H.H. Park S.K. Uhm C.S. Lee Z.H. Koh G.Y. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 603-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The closest relative of FIAF is angiopoietin-like protein 3 (ANGPTL3). KK/Snk mice, a mutant strain of KK obese mice, carry a mutation in the gene for ANGPTL3, resulting in low plasma triglyceride and free fatty acid levels (20Koishi R. Ando Y. Ono M. Shimamura M. Yasumo H. Fujiwara T. Horikoshi H. Furukawa H. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The low plasma triglyceride levels are possibly due to elevated lipoprotein lipase activity, which was reported to be inhibited by ANGPTL3 in vitro, whereas the low plasma free fatty acid levels may be connected to the impaired stimulatory effect of ANGPTL3 on adipose tissue lipolysis (21Shimizugawa T. Ono M. Shimamura M. Yoshida K. Ando Y. Koishi R. Ueda K. Inaba T. Minekura H. Kohama T. Furukawa H. J. Biol.

Similar to ANGPTL3, there is evidence that FIAF also may inhibit lipoprotein lipase activity and hereby influence plasma levels of triglycerides (18Belanger A.J. Lu H. Date T. Liu L.X. Vincent K.A.

PPARα is mainly expressed in brown adipose tissue and liver and plays an important role in the hepatic fatty acid oxidation, whereas PPARγ is the master regulator of adipogenesis. However, it is still unclear whether FIAF is a direct PPAR target gene, with a functional PPAR response element in its promoter. In order to close in on the potential function of FIAF, we studied the regulation of FIAF mRNA and protein expression in vitro and in human blood plasma. Our main conclusions are that FIAF is a classical PPAR target gene in both humans and rodents and that FIAF protein is mainly present in blood plasma in a truncated form, whose levels show a large interindividual variability. Plasma levels of the truncated form of FIAF are increased by treatment with fenofibrate. Chemicals—Wy14643 was obtained from ChemSyn Laboratories. Rosiglitazone was from Alexis. Recombinant human insulin (Actrapid) was from Novo Nordisk. SYBR Green was from Eurogentec. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal calf serum, calf serum, and penicillin/streptomycin/fungizone were from BioWhittaker Europe (Cambrex Bioscience). Otherwise, chemicals were from Sigma. Primary Human Adipocyte Differentiation—Isolation of stromal vascular cells was done as follows. Subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissues were obtained during gastric restriction surgery. Adipose tissue was collected in phosphate-buffered saline and cut into 3 × 3-mm pieces with scissors. The 3 × 3-mm pieces were further processed with a scalpel. Next, the pieces of adipose tissue were digested in DMEM-high glucose containing 4% bovine serum albumin and 2 mg/ml collagenase. 1–2.5 g of adipose tissue was digested in 5 ml of this solution at 37 °C on a shaking platform for 2 h. Next, the digest was transferred to a 5-ml syringe and gently pressed over a 500-μm sterile pore size disposable nylon mesh. Stromal vascular cells were separated from adipose cells by centrifugation (1 min, 170 g). Adipose cells were removed, and the stromal vascular cells were precipitated by centrifugation (5 min, 350 g). Red blood cells were lysed by resuspending the cell pellet in 10 ml of red cell lysis solution (154 mm NH4Cl, 10 mm KHCO3, 0.1 mm EDTA). After 5 min, stromal vascular cells were spun down (5 min, 350 g) and resuspended in DMEM/F-12 containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 2 mm glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and further referred to as complete medium. Approximately 107 cells were plated in a 75-cm2 flask. After 48 h, the medium was replaced by differentiation medium consisting of complete medium (instead of 10% FCS, 2% FCS was used) plus 15 mm NaHCO3, 15 mm HEPES, 33 μm biotin, 17 μm panthothenate, 200 pm T3, 1 μm dexamethasone, 500 nm insulin, 4 μg/ml transferrin, and 10 μm cPGI2. After an average period of 30 days of differentiation, extraction of total RNA was performed. SGBS Cell Line Culture and Induction of Adipogenesis—The culture of the SGBS cells and their induction into mature human adipocytes were performed exactly as previously published (26Wabitsch M. Brenner R.E. Melzner I. Braun M. Moller P. Heinze E. Debatin K.M. Hauner H. Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. 2001; 25: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). 3T3-L1 Adipogenesis Assay—3T3-L1 fibroblasts were amplified in DMEM plus 10% calf serum and plated for final differentiation in DMEM plus 10% FCS. Two days after reaching confluence (which was day 0), the medium was changed, and the following compounds were added: isobutyl methylxanthine (0.5 mm), dexamethasone (1 μm), and insulin (5 μg/ml). On day 3, the medium was changed to DMEM plus 10% FCS and insulin (5 μg/ml). On day 6, the medium was changed to DMEM plus 10% FCS, which was changed every 3 days. Isolation of Total RNA and RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from cells or tissue with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) following the supplier's protocol. 3–5 μg of total RNA was treated with DNase I amplification grade (Invitrogen) and then reverse-transcribed with oligo(dT) using Superscript II RT RNase H (Invitrogen). Real Time Quantitative PCR—Primers were designed to generate a PCR amplification product of 100–200 bp. Only primer pairs yielding unique amplification products without primer dimer formation were subsequently used for real time quantitative PCR assays. The following primer pairs were used: mFIAF (forward), 5′-GTTTGCAGACTCAGCTCAAGC-3′; mFIAF (reverse), 5′-CCAAGAGGTCTATCTGGCTCTG-3′; hFIAF (forward), 5′-CGTACCCTTCTCCACTTGGG-3′; hFIAF (reverse), 5′-GCTCTTGGCGCAGTTCTTG-3′; mβ-Actin (forward), 5′-CTGACTGACTACCTCATGAAGATCCT-3′; mβ-Actin (reverse), 5′-CTTAATGTCACGCACGATTTCC-3′; hβ-Actin (forward), 5′-CTTCCTGGGCATGGAGTC-3′; hβ-Actin (reverse), 5′-GCCAGGGTACATGGTGGT-3′; rPPARα (forward), 5′-CACCCTCTCTCCAGCTTCCA-3′; rPPARα (reverse), 5′-GCCTTGTCCCCACATATTCG-3′; rPPARβ (forward), 5′-AACGAGATCAGCGTGCATGTG-3′; rPPARβ (reverse), 5′-TGAGGAAGAGGCTGCTGAAGTT-3′; rPPARγ (forward), 5′-ATGGAGCCTAAGTTTGAGTTTGCT-3′; rPPARγ (reverse), 5′-GGATGTCCTCGATGGGCTTCA-3′; hPPARα (forward), 5′-CTGGAAGCTTTGGCTTTACG-3′; hPPARα (reverse), 5′-TGTCCCCGCAGATTCTACAT-3′; hPPARβ (forward), 5′-ACAGCATGCACTTCCTTCCA-3′; hPPARβ (reverse), 5′-TCACATGCATGAACACCGTA-3′; hPPARγ (forward), 5′-GAGCCCAAGTTTGAGTTTGC-3′; hPPARγ (reverse), 5′-CAGGGCTTGTAGCAGGTTGT-3′. PCR was carried out using Platinum Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) and SYBR Green on an iCycler PCR machine (Bio-Rad). Expression was related to actin, which did not change under any of the experimental conditions studied. Transactivation Assay—A 350-nucleotide fragment surrounding the putative PPRE within intron 3 of the human or mouse FIAF gene was PCR-amplified from human or mouse genomic DNA (mouse strain C57/B6) and subcloned into the KpnI and BglII sites of pTAL-SEAP (Clontech). This reporter vector was transfected into human hepatoma HepG2 cells together with an expression vector for PPAR (mPPARα, mPPARβ/δ, or mPPARγ in pSG5) in the presence or absence of Wy14643 (50 μm), L165041 (5 μm), or rosiglitazone (5 μm), respectively. Transfections were carried out by calcium phosphate precipitation. A β-galactosidase reporter was co-transfected to normalize for differences in transfection efficiency. Secreted alkaline phosphatase activity was measured in the medium 48 h post-transfection via the chemiluminescent SEAP reporter assay (Roche Applied Science). β-Galactosidase activity was measured in the cell lysate by standard assay using 2-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside as a substrate. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—Pure-bred wild-type or PPARα null mice on a sv129 background were used. Mice were fed by gavage with either Wy14643 (50 mg/kg/day) or vehicle (0.5% carboxymethylcellulose) for 5 days. Alternatively, mice were fasted or not for 24 h. After the indicated treatment, mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. The liver was rapidly perfused with prewarmed (37 °C) phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min followed by 0.2% collagenase for 10 min. The liver was diced and forced through a stainless steel sieve, and the hepatocytes were collected directly into DMEM containing 1% formaldehyde. After incubation at 37 °C for 15 min, the hepatocytes were pelleted, and ChIP was done using mouse PPARα-specific antibodies as previously described (27Di Poi N. Tan N.S. Michalik L. Wahli W. Desvergne B. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 721-733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Sequences of primers used for PCR were 5′-TCTGGGTCTGCCCCCACTCCTGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GTGTGTGTGTGGGATACGGCTAT-3′ (reverse). Control primers used were 5′-AGTAACTTTGACAGGAACCAGGGGTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTTGGACTGGGAACTTAGCTTAGTTG-3′ (reverse). 3T3-L1 cells were differentiated as described above. After cell lysis and sonication, the supernatant was diluted 20-fold in re-chIP dilution buffer (1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 50 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X) prior to incubation with mouse PPARγ antibody. The remainder of the assay was carried out as described previously (27Di Poi N. Tan N.S. Michalik L. Wahli W. Desvergne B. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 721-733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Gel Shift—hRXRα and hPPARα proteins were generated from pSG5 expression vectors using the TnT coupled in vitro transcription/translation system (Promega). The following oligonucleotides were annealed: hFIAF-PPRE, 5′-TCGGGGAAAGTAGGGGAAAGGTCGTGG-3′ and 5′-CTGGGCCAGCGACCTTTCCCCTACTTTCCC-3′; mFIAF-PPRE, 5′-TCGGGGAAAGTAGGAGAAAGGTCACTGG-3′ and 5′-CTGGCCAGTGACCTTTCTCCTACTTTCCC-3′; for specific competition malic enzyme PPRE, 5′-TCGCTTTCTGGGTCAAAGTTGATCCA-3′ and 5′-CTGGTGGATCAACTTTGACCCAGAAAG-3′; for nonspecific competition ETS, 5′-TGGAATGTACCGGAAATAACACCA-3′ and 5′-TGGTGTTATTTCCGGTACATTCCA-3′. Oligonucleotides were annealed and labeled by Klenow filling (Roche Applied Science) using Redivue [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) (Amersham Biosciences). In vitro translated proteins (0.5–0.8 μl/reaction) were preincubated for 15 min on ice in 1× binding buffer (80 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol plus protease inhibitors) in presence of 2 μg of poly(dI·dC), 5 μg of sonicated salmon sperm DNA, and competitor oligonucleotides in a final volume of 20 μl. Then 1 ng (1 ng/μl) of radiolabeled oligonucleotide was added, and incubation proceeded for another 10 min at room temperature. Complexes were separated on a 4% polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide/bisacrylamide, 37.5:1) equilibrated in 0.5× TBE at 25 mA. Western Blot—The mouse polyclonal antibody used was directed against the epitope CQGPKGKDAPFKDSE located in the N-terminal part of the mouse FIAF protein. The human polyclonal antibody used was directed against the epitope CQGTEGSTDLPLAPE also located in the N-terminal part of the human FIAF protein. The peptide affinity-purified antibodies were generated in rabbit and ordered via Eurogentec's customized antibody production service. Western blotting was carried out using an ECL system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The primary antibody was used at a dilution of 1:1000 (mouse) or between 1:2000 and 1:5000 (human), and the secondary antibody (anti-rabbit IgG, Sigma) was used at a dilution of 1:8000. All incubations were performed in 1× Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.5, with 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% dry milk, except for the final washings, when milk was omitted. Human Subjects—In experiment 1, blood was taken from 16 young adults after an overnight fast. In experiment 2, blood was taken after an overnight fast from 28 subjects before and after a 4-week treatment with 250 mg of micronized fenofibrate daily. In experiment 3, blood was taken after an overnight fast from 20 men (body mass index ranging 22.7 to 39.8). Samples were from a published study (28Mars M. de Graaf C. van Rossum C.T. de Groot C.P. Seidell J.C. Kok F.J. Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. 2003; 27: 574-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In experiment 4, blood was taken after an overnight fast from 22 subjects before and after a 46-day semistarvation program (2.1 MJ/day). Samples were from a published study (29Hukshorn C.J. Westerterp-Plantenga M.S. Saris W.H. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2003; 77: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). All human experiments were approved by the medical ethics committee of Wageningen University, Maastricht University, or the University of Ulm. FIAF Expression Is Regulated by All Three PPARs—Previous studies have indicated that expression of FIAF/PGAR/ANGPTL4 is up-regulated by PPARα and PPARγ in mice. Several genes are known that are targets of PPARα in mice but not in humans (30Lawrence J.W. Li Y. Chen S. DeLuca J.G. Berger J.P. Umbenhauer D.R. Moller D.E. Zhou G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31521-31527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 31Hsu M.H. Savas U. Griffin K.J. Johnson E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27950-27958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). To investigate whether expression of FIAF is under control of PPARα in other species, rat hepatoma FAO cells were treated with the PPARα agonist Wy14643 (Fig. 1A). According to real time quantitative PCR, FAO cells express relatively high levels of PPARα as well as PPARβ/δ, whereas PPARγ mRNA was below our detection limit (Fig. 1B). Basal expression of FIAF in FAO cells was extremely low but was dramatically increased by Wy14643, either alone or in combination with the RXR agonist Lg100268 (Fig. 1A). The synthetic PPARβ/δ agonist L165041 also strongly increased FIAF mRNA, suggesting that PPARβ/δ stimulates FIAF gene expression too. Finally, the PPARγ agonist ciglitazone had little effect on rat FIAF gene expression, which may be explained by the low expression of PPARγ mRNA in these cells. To examine whether the human FIAF gene is also up-regulated by PPARs, human hepatoma HepG2 cells were treated with PPAR agonists (Fig. 1C). HepG2 cells express all three PPARs, with PPARβ/δ being the most abundant (Fig. 1D). Similar to what was observed in FAO cells, although with much more modest -fold inductions, FIAF mRNA was increased by Wy14643 and Lg100268, either alone or used in combination (Fig. 1C). The PPARβ/δ agonist L165041 also induced FIAF mRNA, but no additional effect of Lg100268 was observed. In contrast to PPARα and PPARβ/δ agonists, the PPARγ agonist ciglitazone reduced FIAF expression, which was maintained in the presence of Lg100268. Taken together, these results indicate that FIAF is up-regulated by PPARα and PPARβ/δ, but probably not by PPARγ, in human and rat hepatoma cells. To better examine regulation of human FIAF expression by PPARγ, we turned to primary human preadipocytes. Upon stimulation with a mixture of hormones, these cells can be differentiated into adipocytes. Stromal vascular cells from both subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue were isolated and induced to differentiate into adipocytes. Expression of FIAF was higher in adipocytes versus preadipocytes in all three subjects with cells from both subcutaneous and visceral origin (Fig. 2A). A similar induction of expression was observed for PPARγ, suggesting that FIAF is up-regulated by PPARγ during human adipocyte differentiation. In differentiated human SGBS adipocytes, both rosiglitazone and L165041 caused an induction of FIAF mRNA (Fig. 2, B and C, respectively), indicating that both PPARγ and PPARβ/δ regulate FIAF expression in human adipocytes. Together, these data suggest that FIAF is a PPARγ and possibly a PPARβ/δ target gene in human adipocytes. FIAF Is a Direct Target Gene of PPAR—To unequivocally determine FIAF as a direct target gene of PPARs, direct binding of PPAR to the FIAF promoter needs to be demonstrated. Comparative analysis of the hFIAF and mFIAF gene sequence upstream of the transcription start site did not reveal any conserved stretches of DNA that might harbor a PPRE. Transactivation studies with several kilobases of the immediate upstream sequence from both the mouse and human FIAF gene did not yield any significant activation of a reporter gene, suggesting that the responsive element may be located elsewhere. While scanning the FIAF gene sequence for PPREs, a putative PPRE was identified in a conserved region of intron 3 of the human and mouse FIAF gene (AGG(G/A)GAAAGGTC(G/A)) that differed little from the consensus PPRE (Fig. 3A). To determine whether this PPRE binds PPAR in vitro, gel shift experiments were carried out with in vitro translated/transcribed PPARα and RXRα. For both the human and mouse PPRE, a retarded complex was only observed in the presence of both PPARα and RXRα (Fig. 3B), indicating that this complex represents a PPARα/RXRα heterodimer. The complex disappeared in the presence of an excess of cold specific oligonucleotide but not nonspecific oligonucleotide. Similar results were observed for PPARγ (data not shown). These data indicate that PPAR is able to bind to the human and mouse PPRE within intron 3 in vitro. To assess whether the PPRE within intron 3 is able to mediate PPAR-dependent transactivation, a 350-nucleotide fragment surrounding the human or mouse PPRE was cloned in front of the thymidine kinase promoter followed by a SEAP reporter. In HepG2 cells, co-transfection of the reporter vector with a PPARα, PPARβ/δ, or PPARγ expression vector increased SEAP activity, which was further enhanced by the addition of ligand (Fig. 3C). In this assay, PPARα seemed to be the most potent activator, followed by PPARβ/δ and PPARγ. These data suggest that the PPRE identified in intron 3 of the FIAF gene is able to mediate PPAR-dependent transactivation. Finally, to find out whether PPARα and PPARγ are bound to this sequence in vivo, ChIP was performed using antibodies against PPARα or PPARγ. In human HepG2 cells, binding of PPARα to the sequence spanning the putative PPRE within intron 3 was enhanced by Wy14643 (Fig. 4A). No immunoprecipitation was observed with preimmune serum, and no amplification was observed for a control sequence. In mice, treatment with Wy14643 enhanced binding of PPARα to the PPRE sequence in liver, which was not observed in PPARα null mice (Fig. 4B). Similarly, fasting enhanced binding of PPARα to the PPRE sequence, which was not observed in the PPARα null mice (Fig. 4C). With respect to PPARγ, previous data had shown that FIAF is up-regulated during mouse 3T3-L1 adipogenesis (17Yoon J.C. Chickering T.W. Rosen E.D. Dussault B. Qin Y. Soukas A. Friedman J.M. Holmes W.E. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5343-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), indicating that it may be a direct PPARγ target gene. Using ChIP, we observed binding of PPARγ to the PPRE sequence in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes but not in preadipocytes (Fig. 4D). These data clearly demonstrate that PPARα and PPARγ bind to the intronic sequence harboring the PPRE in vivo. Thus, FIAF can be formally classified as a direct PPAR target gene in human and mouse.

We have found previously that 4-methylumbelliferone (MU) inhibits HA synthesis in human skin fibroblasts and in group C Streptococcus. In this paper, the inhibition mechanism in mammalian cells was investigated using rat 3Y1 fibroblasts stably expressing HA synthase (HAS) 2. Exposure of the transfectants to the inhibitor resulted in significant reduction of HA biosynthesis and matrix formation. The evaluation of HAS transcripts and analysis of cell-free HA synthesis demonstrated the post-transcriptional suppression of HAS activity by MU. Most interesting, the post-transcriptional suppression of HAS activity was also observed using p-nitrophenol, a well known substrate for UDP-glucuronyltransferases (UGT). We investigated whether the inhibition was exerted by the glucuronidation of MU using both high pressure liquid chromatography and TLC analyses. The production of MU-glucuronic acid (GlcUA) was consistent with the inhibition of HA synthesis in HAS transfectants. MU-GlcUA was also detected at a similar level in control cells, suggesting that the glucuronidation was mediated by an endogenous UGT. Elevated levels of UGT significantly enhanced the inhibitory effects of MU. In contrast, the inhibition by MU was diminished to the control level when an excess of UDP-GlcUA was added to the cell-free HA synthesis system. We propose a novel mechanism for the MU-mediated inhibition of HA synthesis involving the glucuronidation of MU by endogenous UGT resulting in a depletion of UDP-GlcUA.

Tanaka K. Saito Y. Endo M. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1997; 43: 263-268PubMed Google Scholar). Since then MU has been used as an inhibitor of HA synthesis in many studies on the functions of HA, although its precise mechanism has not been established in mammalian cells (10Kosaki R. Watanabe K. Yamaguchi Y. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1141-1145PubMed Google Scholar, 25Endo Y. Takagaki K. Takahashi G. Kakizaki I. Funahashi M. Yokoyama M. Endo M. Munakata A. Progress in Transplantation.

Cell. 2001; 12: 1859-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). For many years MU has been used safely in human medicine as a cholagogue by oral administration (27Takeda S. Aburada M. J. Pharmacobio-Dyn. 1981; 4: 724-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The clinical application of MU for controlling HA synthesis could potentially prevent malignant alteration of cancer cells and fibrosis of organs. It would therefore be helpful to clarify the inhibition mechanism of MU in mammalian cells. The information may also be useful in developing new compounds that are more effective inhibitors and/or display lower cytotoxicity than MU. A possible phospholipid-dependent inhibition mechanism of MU was found using group C Streptococcus in our previous paper (28Kakizaki I. Takagaki K. Endo Y. Kudo D. Ikeya H. Miyoshi T. Baggenstoss B.A. Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Kumari K. Nakane A. Weigel P.H. Endo M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5066-5075Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We suggested that MU treatment may inhibit HAS activity by altering the distribution of cardiolipin species surrounding HAS in the plasma membrane. However, the change in the distribution of cardiolipin cannot by itself account for the observed inhibition of HA synthesis. Furthermore, the proposed mechanism of inhibition involving cardiolipin might be specific for Streptococcus, because mammalian cells have low levels of cardiolipin in the plasma membrane. Indeed the effect of cardiolipin on enzymatic activity is distinct between mammalian HAS1 and streptococcal HAS (29Yoshida M. Itano N. Yamada Y. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 497-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), suggesting that the MU-mediated inhibition is quite complex. In this study we demonstrate a UGT-dependent inhibition mechanism for HA synthesis in mammalian cells using transfectants that express mouse HAS2. We propose the inhibition of HA synthesis is due, in part, to a depletion in the pool of UDP-GlcUA, a common substrate of HAS and UGT. Materials and Reagents—MU was purchased from Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan). p-Nitrophenol (pNP), pNP-sugars (pNP-Glc, pNPGlcUA, and pNP-GlcNAc), and MU-sugars (MU-Glc, MU-GlcUA, and MU-GlcNAc) were from Sigma. MU and MU-sugars were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO); pNP and pNP-sugars were dissolved in ethanol, and the final concentration of these vehicles in the culture medium and the reaction mixtures for the cell-free HA synthesis were adjusted to 0.1%. UDP-[14C]GlcUA (313 mCi/mmol) and [14C]pNP (70 mCi/mmol) were from ICN Biomedicals, Inc. (Irvine, CA) and American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc. (St. Louis, MO), respectively. UDP-GlcUA, dithiothreitol (DTT), and ATP were from Nakalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan). UDP-GlcNAc, bovine liver β-glucuronidase, and glutaraldehyde-stabilized sheep erythrocytes were from Sigma. Streptomyces hyaluronidase was obtained from Seikagaku Corp. (Tokyo, Japan). Hyaluronic acid “Chugai” quantitative test kit for the sandwich binding protein assay was purchased from Chugai Pharmaceutical (Tokyo, Japan) (30Chichibu K. Matsuura T. Shichijo S. Yokoyama M.M. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1989; 181: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Recombinant human UGT1A6 and UGT1A7 proteins were from Calbiochem, and their expression vectors were reported previously (31Ito M. Yamamoto K. Maruo Y. Sato H. Fujiyama Y. Bamba T. Eur. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 2002; 58: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfection—Stable transfectants were established by transfection of mouse HAS2 and control vector into rat 3Y1 cells as described previously (32Itano N. Sawai T. Yoshida M. Lenas P. Yamada Y. Imagawa M. Shinomura T. Hamaguchi M. Yoshida Y. Ohnuki Y. Miyauchi S. Spicer A.P. McDonald J.A. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25085-25092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). Cells were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and 400 μg/ml G418 at 37 °C. pFLAG-HAS2 and human UGT1A6 expression vector were transiently transfected into COS-1 cells by electroporation as described previously (32Itano N. Sawai T. Yoshida M. Lenas P. Yamada Y. Imagawa M. Shinomura T. Hamaguchi M. Yoshida Y. Ohnuki Y. Miyauchi S. Spicer A.P. McDonald J.A. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25085-25092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mml-glutamine at 37 °C. Particle Exclusion Assay—3Y1-HAS2 cells plated at 1 × 103 cells in a 35-mm dish were cultured for 2 days and then further cultured for a day with or without 300 μm MU. An aliquot of glutaraldehyde-stabilized sheep erythrocytes (3 × 108) in PBS was then added to the culture medium. After 15 min, the culture was observed using an inverted phase-contrast microscope (Olympus IMT-2) (33Knudson W. Knudson C.B. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 99: 227-235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Quantitative Analyses of the HAS Transcripts—The relative level of HAS expression in the HAS2 transfectants was determined by real time quantitative RT-PCR as described previously (11Itano N. Sawai T. Miyaishi O. Kimata K. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2499-2504PubMed Google Scholar). The gene-specific PCR primers and probes were designed from the mouse HAS2 and rat HAS sequences using the Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The sequences of the various oligonucleotides are as follows: the forward primer for mouse HAS2 was 5′-CCTCGGAATCACAGCTGCTTATA-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-CTGCCCATAACTTCGCTGAATA-3′; the probe for mouse HAS2 was 5′-TCGCATCTCATCATCCAAAGCCTCTTTG-3′; the forward primer for rat HAS1 was 5′-GGAGATGTGAGAATCCTTAACCCTC-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-TGCTGGCTCAGCCAACGAAGGAA-3′; the probe for rat HAS1 was 5′-CAGAGCTACTTTCACTGTGTGTCCTGCATC-3′; the forward primer for rat HAS2 was 5′-CCTCGGAATCACAGCTGCTTATA-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-CTGCCCATGACTTCACTGAAGA-3′; the probe for rat HAS2 was 5′-TCACACCTCATCATCCAAAGCCTCTTTG-3′; the forward primer for rat HAS3 was 5′-GGTACCATCAGAAGTTCCTAGGCAGC-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-GAGGAGAATGTTCCAGATGCG-3′; and the probe for rat HAS3 was 5′-TGGCTACCGGACTAAGTATACAGCACGCTC-3′. Total RNA was isolated from subconfluent rat 3Y1 cells expressing mouse HAS2 using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Two hundred nanograms of total RNA was used for real time RT-PCR and subsequent analysis. The reaction master mix was prepared to give final concentrations of 1× TaqMan EZ buffer, 0.3 mm dATP, 0.3 mm dCTP, 0.3 mm dGTP, 0.6 mm dUTP, 6 mm manganese acetate, 0.01 units/μl uracil N-glycosylase, 0.1 units/μl rTth DNA polymerase, 200 nm primers, and 100 nm TaqMan probe. The conditions for RT-PCR are as follows: 1 cycle at 50 °C for 2 min, 1 cycle at 60 °C for 30 min, 1 cycle at 95 °C for 5 min, 50 cycles at 95 °C for 20 s, and 60 °C for 1 min. Fluorescent signals generated during PCR amplifications were monitored in real time using the 7700 sequence detector system (Applied Biosystems) and analyzed with the sequence detector 1.7 program (Applied Biosystems). The relative amount of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA was measured using the TaqMan rodent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase detection reagents (Applied Biosystems). The amount of HAS mRNA was divided by the amount of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA in each sample. The normalized values were designated as the “relative expression coefficient” in this study. Standard curves were generated by serial dilution of total RNA isolated from HAS2 transfectants. Determination of the HA Concentration by ELISA-like Assay—Cells were plated at a density of 1 × 105 and 8 × 105 cells/well in a 6-well plate (defined as exponentially growing phase and confluent phase, respectively). The cells were cultured with various concentrations of MU for 24 h. HA released into the culture medium was quantified by an ELISA-like assay using HA-binding protein according to the manufacturer's instructions for the hyaluronic acid “Chugai” quantitative test kit (30Chichibu K. Matsuura T. Shichijo S. Yokoyama M.M. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1989; 181: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The quantity of HA was expressed per live cell number. The viability of cells was assessed by trypan blue staining. HA Synthase Assay—HAS activity was monitored in the cell-free HA synthesis system using UDP-[14C]GlcUA and UDP-GlcNAc as donors and a membrane-rich fraction of the transfectants as an enzyme source as described previously (32Itano N. Sawai T. Yoshida M. Lenas P. Yamada Y. Imagawa M. Shinomura T. Hamaguchi M. Yoshida Y. Ohnuki Y. Miyauchi S. Spicer A.P. McDonald J.A. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25085-25092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). Briefly, the HAS transfectants were washed, harvested, and disrupted by sonication in 10 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.1, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol containing 0.25 m sucrose. Suspensions of the disrupted cells were ultracentrifuged in a Beckman TLS rotor at 43,000 rpm for 1 h to give the high speed pellet. The crude membrane fractions prepared from HAS transfectants were resuspended with standard reaction mixture (0.1 ml of 25 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.1, 5 mm DTT, 15 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm UDP-GlcNAc, 2 μm UDP-GlcUA, and 0.2 μCi of UDP-[14C]GlcUA) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Depending on the type of experiment, MU, pNP, and their sugar derivatives were added to the reaction mixture. Alternatively, the membrane fractions were preincubated at 37 °C for 1 h with 300 μm MU or 300 μm MUGlcUA in the preincubation mixture (0.1 ml of 25 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.1, 5 mm DTT, 15 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm UDP-GlcUA), and then HA synthesis was initiated by adding 2 mm UDP-GlcNAc and 0.2 μCi of UDP-[14C]GlcUA. The reaction was terminated at the indicated time by addition of SDS to 2% (w/v). The mixtures were then spotted onto Whatman No. 3MM paper, and the paper was developed in 1 m ammonium acetate (pH 5.5) and ethanol (65:35 v/v) for 3 days. The origin, containing the synthesized polymers, was removed, and the amount of radioactivity in the high molecular mass HA was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Agarose Gel Electrophoresis of HA—The size distribution of radiolabeled HA synthesized in the cell-free reaction was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis (0.5% gel) as described previously (32Itano N. Sawai T. Yoshida M. Lenas P. Yamada Y. Imagawa M. Shinomura T. Hamaguchi M. Yoshida Y. Ohnuki Y. Miyauchi S. Spicer A.P. McDonald J.A. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25085-25092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). The synthesized HA was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with or without 1 turbidity reducing unit of Streptomyces hyaluronidase prior to loading on the gel. After drying the gel, the radioactive HA was detected using a BAS 5000 Bio-Imaging Analyzer (Fuji Film Co., Tokyo, Japan). HPLC Analysis of the MU-sugar Derivative—MU-sugar derivatives, from culture conditioned medium and from cell lysate, were analyzed by HPLC using a TSK gel ODS-120T (15 cm × 4.6 mm inner diameter) column. HPLC conditions were identical to those described by Zimmerman et al. (34Zimmerman C.L. Ratna S. Leboeuf E. Pang K.S. J. Chromatogr. 1991; 563: 83-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Eluted fractions were monitored by detecting fluorescence (excitation 325 nm, emission 380 nm) using a fluorescence spectrophotometer Hitachi F-1050 (Tokyo, Japan). Cells were washed with PBS three times and then disrupted in a solution of 2% SDS-PBS by sonication for 2 min (4 bursts of 30 s) using a sonifier (model UR-20P, Tomy Seiko, Tokyo, Japan). The cell lysate was then obtained by centrifugation at 105,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatants were used for HPLC analysis. For TLC analysis in Fig. 3 and for mass spectrometry, a peak corresponding to MU-GlcUA was collected by HPLC as described below. A fraction containing MU-GlcUA was prefractionated from culture supernatant using a Sep-Pac Plus C18 cartridge (Waters, MA) prior to HPLC. Briefly, the culture supernatant was loaded onto the cartridge, and the cartridge was then washed with water. Bound materials containing MU-GlcUA were eluted with 100% methanol, concentrated by using a vacuum evaporator centrifuge (Iwaki, Tokyo, Japan), and analyzed by HPLC. A peak of MU-GlcUA was collected and de-salted using a Sep-Pac Plus C18 cartridge. After drying, the residue was dissolved into methanol and analyzed by TLC or mass spectrometry. TLC Analysis of the MU-sugar or pNP-sugar Derivative—Radiolabeled MU-sugar or pNP-sugar derivatives produced in the cell-free HA synthesis system was treated with or without 2 units of β-glucuronidase at 37 °C for 1 h and then separated by TLC. TLC was performed on a Silica 60 TLC plate (Merck) using 1-butanol/ethanol/water (5:3:2, v/v/v) as the mobile phase (35Kamst E. Bakkers J. Quaedvlieg N.E. Pilling J. Kijne J.W. Lugtenberg B.J. Spaink H.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4045-4052Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). After drying the plate, radioactive spots were detected using a BAS 5000 Bio-Imaging Analyzer. The radiolabeled product derived from the incubation of pNP and UDP-[14C]GlcUA according to the standard assay method of UGT (36Kanou M. Saeki K. Kato T. Takahashi K. Mizutani T. Fundam. Clin. Pharmacol. 2002; 16: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) was used for determining the mobility of pNP-GlcUA. Fluorescent spots containing MU or MU-sugar were detected by ultraviolet irradiation using a transilluminator. Authentic MU-GlcUA was used as a standard. Mass Spectrum Measurements—Mass spectra were obtained on a PE-Sciex API-100 single-quadrupole mass spectrometer (Thornhill, Ontario, Canada) equipped with an atmospheric pressure ionization source described previously (37Takagaki K. Kojima K. Majima M. Nakamura T. Kato I. Endo M. Glycoconj. J. 1992; 9: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The mass spectrometer was operated in the negative mode. Samples dissolved in 50% 2-propanol were ionized by electrospray ionization and continuously infused into the electrospray ionization chamber at a flow rate of 5 μl min-1. Inhibitory Effect of MU on HA Production and HA Matrix Formation of the HAS2-expressing Cells—MU was originally found to inhibit HA synthesis and HA matrix formation of cultured human skin fibroblasts (23Nakamura T. Takagaki K. Shibata S. Tanaka K. Higuchi T. Endo M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 470-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 24Nakamura T. Funahashi M. Takagaki K. Munakata H. Tanaka K. Saito Y. Endo M. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1997; 43: 263-268PubMed Google Scholar). The recent discovery that MU inhibits HA synthesis of group C Streptococcus in a phospholipid-dependent fashion provided new insight into understanding the mechanism of inhibition (28Kakizaki I. Takagaki K. Endo Y. Kudo D. Ikeya H. Miyoshi T. Baggenstoss B.A. Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Kumari K. Nakane A. Weigel P.H. Endo M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5066-5075Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, the inhibition of HA synthesis by MU cannot be explained by this mechanism alone, particularly in mammalian cells. In this study, we examined the effects of MU on HA synthesis by using HAS2 overexpressing cells in order to clarify which step of HA synthesis is the target for the inhibition. The HAS2 overexpressing cells, named 3Y1-HAS2, were established from rat 3Y1 fibroblasts by transfection with HAS2 cDNA as described previously (32Itano N. Sawai T. Yoshida M. Lenas P. Yamada Y. Imagawa M. Shinomura T. Hamaguchi M. Yoshida Y. Ohnuki Y. Miyauchi S. Spicer A.P. McDonald J.A. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25085-25092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). Formation of pericellular HA matrices and HA production were significantly inhibited in 3Y1-HAS2 cells by treatment with MU as observed previously in cultured human skin fibroblasts (23Nakamura T. Takagaki K. Shibata S. Tanaka K. Higuchi T. Endo M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 470-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 24Nakamura T. Funahashi M. Takagaki K. Munakata H. Tanaka K. Saito Y. Endo M. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1997; 43: 263-268PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The formation of pericellular HA matrices was inhibited by ∼30% during exposure to 300 μm MU compared with the nontreated control. The level of inhibition was even more apparent at higher concentrations of MU (data not shown). HA accumulation in the conditioned medium was dose-dependently decreased by MU treatment both in the exponentially growing and confluent phases of 3Y1-HAS2 cells (Fig. 1E). Transcription of the mouse HAS2 transgene and the endogenous HAS genes in the transfectants was assessed by real time RT-PCR using mouse- and rat-specific HAS primers and probes. No obvious change in the transcriptional levels of these HAS genes was observed at the low or moderate concentrations of MU, whereas the level of the endogenous HAS2 gene was inhibited during exposure to a high dose of MU (Table I). These results suggest that MU inhibits HAS activity post-transcriptionally at the low or moderate concentrations of MU. In contrast, a high dose of MU inhibits HA synthesis by suppressing HAS functions both transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally.Table IRelative HAS expression in HAS2 transfectants after MU treatmentMUMouse HAS2Rat HAS2Rat HAS3μm%%%010010010010130.7 ± 19.794.7 ± 2598.5 ± 13.930129.1 ± 34.886.1 ± 10.793.1 ± 13.7100137.4 ± 11.6105.0 ± 2893.9 ± 10.330093.3 ± 29.677.1 ± 4.390.4 ± 2.11000104.8 ± 28.448.6 ± 8.297.4 ± 10.6 Open table in a new tab Effect of MU on HA Synthesis and Chain Elongation in a Cell-free HA Synthesis System—Cell-free HA synthesis was examined by using the membrane-rich fraction of 3Y1-HAS2 cells. As shown in Fig. 2A, HAS activity was inhibited by MU in a dose-dependent manner, and the inhibition reached to 50% of the nontreated control at 300 μm MU. The inhibitory effect was observed at an early stage of HA synthesis and reached a plateau 30 min after treatment with MU (Fig. 2B). The size distribution of HA synthesized in the cell-free system was also determined by agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2, C and D). The decrease in the molecular size of HA was caused by MU treatment in both a dose- and time-dependent manner. These data suggest MU inhibits HA synthesis by suppressing HAS function post-transcriptionally. Furthermore, the MU-mediated inhibition of HA synthesis may be caused by direct inhibition of HAS activity. MU has been used as a substrate to measure the activity of UGTs, which are involved in the detoxification of phenolic compounds in mammalian cells, particularly in the liver (38Hanioka N. Jinno H. Tanaka-Kagawa T. Nishimura T. Ando M. J. Pharm. Biomed. Anal. 2001; 25: 65-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Because HAS possesses a glycosyltransferase activity for UDPGlcUA within its polypeptide (17Weigel P.H. Hascall V.C. Tammi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13997-14000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar), we initially hypothesized that the enzyme is able to transfer GlcUA to MU from UDPGlcUA, and the glucuronidation of MU competitively inhibits chain elongation of HA. We therefore tested the effect of pNP, another acceptor for UGTs (39Ciotti M. Marrone A. Potter C. Owens I.S. Pharmacogenetics. 1997; 7: 485-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), on HAS activity. As shown in Fig. 2A, HAS activity was indeed inhibited by pNP. Production of MU-GlcUA in the Culture Medium and in the Reaction Supernatant of the Cell-free HA Synthesis—The effects of both MU and pNP prompted us to investigate whether the glucuronidation of these compounds is involved in the inhibition of HAS activity. The production of MU-GlcUA was analyzed by HPLC by using conditioned medium from 3Y1-HAS2 and 3Y1-Mock cells which were cultured for 24 h in the presence of various concentrations of MU. In the presence of MU,"

We cloned a novel cDNA (GenBank™ accession number AB057805) encoding THCA synthase by reverse transcription and polymerase chain reactions from rapidly expanding leaves of Cannabis sativa. This gene consists of a 1635-nucleotide open reading frame, encoding a 545-amino acid polypeptide of which the first 28 amino acid residues constitute the signal peptide. The predicted molecular weight of the 517-amino acid mature polypeptide is 58,597 Da. Interestingly, the deduced amino acid sequence exhibited high homology to berberine bridge enzyme from Eschscholtzia californica, which is involved in alkaloid biosynthesis. The liquid culture of transgenic tobacco hairy roots harboring the cDNA produced THCA upon feeding of cannabigerolic acid, demonstrating unequivocally that this gene encodes an active THCA synthase. Overexpression of the recombinant THCA synthase was achieved using a baculovirus-insect expression system. The purified recombinant enzyme contained covalently attached FAD cofactor at a molar ratio of FAD to protein of 1:1. The mutant enzyme constructed by changing His-114 of the wild-type enzyme to Ala-114 exhibited neither absorption characteristics of flavoproteins nor THCA synthase activity. Thus, we concluded that the FAD binding residue is His-114 and that the THCA synthase reaction is FAD-dependent.

This is the first report on molecular characterization of an enzyme specific to cannabinoid biosynthesis. Cannabinoids, which are found only in Cannabis sativa, are novel secondary metabolites consisting of alkylresorcinol and monoterpene groups. More than 60 cannabinoids have been isolated from marijuana or fresh Cannabis leaves, and their pharmacological properties have been extensively investigated (1Turner C.E. Elsohly M.A. Boeren E.G. J. Nat. Prod. (Lloydia). 1980; 43: 169-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Among them, Δ1-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) 1The abbreviations used are: THC, Δ1-tetrahydrocannabinol; BBE, berberine bridge enzyme; CBGA, cannabigerolic acid; 6-HDNO, 6-hydroxy-D-nicotine oxidase; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; THCA, Δ1-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid; THCAS, Δ1-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid synthase cDNA. 1The abbreviations used are: THC, Δ1-tetrahydrocannabinol; BBE, berberine bridge enzyme; CBGA, cannabigerolic acid; 6-HDNO, 6-hydroxy-D-nicotine oxidase; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; THCA, Δ1-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid; THCAS, Δ1-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid synthase cDNA. is the psychoactive component of marijuana (2Gaoni R. Mechoulam R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1964; 86: 1946-1947Google Scholar). In addition, this cannabinoid is shown to exert a variety of therapeutic activities such as the relief of nausea caused by cancer chemotherapy (3Guzman M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 745-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar) and the suppression of spasticity and pain associated with multiple sclerosis (4Baker D. Pryce G. Giovannoni G. Thompson A.J. Lancet Neurol. 2003; 2: 291-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Thus, because THC has attracted a great deal of attention, various chemical, pharmacological, and biosynthetic studies have been conducted on this cannabinoid (5Mechoulam R. Science. 1970; 168: 1159-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 6Mechoulam R. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2000; 6: 1313-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). THC usually accumulates at a quite low level in the fresh leaves of C. sativa and is considered to be derived artificially from the acidic cannabinoid Δ1-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA) by non-enzymatic decarboxylation during storage and smoking (7Yamauchi T. Shoyama Y. Aramaki H. Azuma T. Nishioka I. Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1967; 15: 1075-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 8Kimura M. Okamoto K. Experientia (Basel). 1970; 26: 819-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Our previous studies on the biosynthetic pathway of cannabinoids demonstrated that THCA, which had been believed to be formed through isomerization of cannabidiolic acid, was actually biosynthesized from cannabigerolic acid (CBGA) (9Taura F. Morimoto S. Shoyama Y. Mechoulam R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 9766-9767Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 10Taura F. Morimoto S. Shoyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17411-17416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Furthermore, we identified an oxidoreductase named THCA synthase, which catalyzes THCA biosynthesis in rapidly expanding leaves of C. sativa (Mexican strain) (9Taura F. Morimoto S. Shoyama Y. Mechoulam R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 9766-9767Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The activity of this enzyme was not detected in a nonpsychoactive Cannabis strain (CBDA strain) (10Taura F. Morimoto S. Shoyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17411-17416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 11Shoyama Y. Yagi M. Nishioka I. Yamauchi T. Phytochemistry. 1975; 14: 2189-2192Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar), which contains cannabidiolic acid as a major cannabinoid and only a trace amount of THCA, indicating that THCA synthase is an important enzyme controlling the psychoactivity of C. sativa. We also demonstrated that THCA synthase catalyzes a unique biosynthetic reaction. THCA synthase oxidatively cyclizes the monoterpene moiety of CBGA to form THCA (9Taura F. Morimoto S. Shoyama Y. Mechoulam R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 9766-9767Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Similar reactions are often found in monoterpene biosynthesis, where biosynthetic enzymes (monoterpene cyclases) cyclize geranyl pyrophosphate into various monoterpenes (12Croteau R. Chem. Rev. 1987; 87: 929-954Crossref Scopus (465) Google Scholar), but these reactions are not accompanied by oxidation, contrary to the THCA synthase reaction. Because of the novel catalytic property, it is of interest to know the primary structure of THCA synthase, although we revealed no structural information on this enzyme except for the N-terminal sequence containing 15 amino acid residues (9Taura F. Morimoto S. Shoyama Y. Mechoulam R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 9766-9767Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have not unequivocally determined which subclass this oxidoreductase belongs to, because the coenzyme or cofactor required for the oxidocyclization of CBGA was not identified (9Taura F. Morimoto S. Shoyama Y. Mechoulam R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 9766-9767Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Thus, the mechanism of the THCA synthase reaction has remained largely unclear. To obtain a more precise knowledge about the structure and reaction mechanism of THCA synthase, in the present study we cloned and characterized a THCA synthase cDNA (THCAS). Surprisingly, we found that the primary structure deduced from the nucleotide sequence of THCAS exhibited high homology to that of the berberine bridge enzyme (BBE) (13Dittrich H. Kutchan T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9969-9973Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), which is involved in the biosynthesis of benzophenanthridine alkaloids. Based on the biochemical properties of THCA synthase, we established that this enzyme is a flavinylated oxidase that requires molecular oxygen for the oxidation of the substrate. We report here the structural characteristics and reaction mechanism of THCA synthase. Moreover, we attempted the expression of the active THCA synthase in tobacco hairy roots. Interestingly, the transformed tobacco hairy roots produced THCA on exogenous addition of the biosynthetic precursor CBGA. We also describe the development of THCA-producing tobacco. Plant Materials and Reagents—C. sativa plants (Mexican strain) (11Shoyama Y. Yagi M. Nishioka I. Yamauchi T. Phytochemistry. 1975; 14: 2189-2192Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar) were cultivated in the herbal garden of the Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kyushu University. Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum cv. Xanthi) plants were cultured on Gamborg B5 medium (14Gamborg O.L. Miller R.A. Ojima K. Exp. Cell Res. 1968; 50: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (7502) Google Scholar) solidified with agar at 25 °C under 16 h of illumination. Reagents for molecular biological procedures were purchased from Amersham Biosciences and Toyobo (Osaka, Japan). Chemical and biochemical reagents were purchased from Sigma, Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan), and Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan). THCA was purified from the dried leaves of C. sativa as described previously (15Taura F. Morimoto S. Shoyama Y. Phytochemistry. 1995; 39: 457-458Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). CBGA was chemically synthesized by a two-step procedure, condensation of olivetol and geraniol to synthesize cannabigerol (16Mechoulam R. Yagen Y. Tetrahedron Lett. 1969; 10: 5349-5352Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar) followed by carboxylation of cannabigerol with methyl magnesium carbonate (17Mechoulam R. Ben-Zvi Z. J. Chem. Soc. D. 1969; 1969: 343-344Crossref Google Scholar). Purification of THCA Synthase—THCA synthase was purified from rapidly expanding leaves of C. sativa (Mexican strain) as reported previously (9Taura F. Morimoto S. Shoyama Y. Mechoulam R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 9766-9767Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The purity of the enzyme was confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Microsequencing of THCA Synthase—Purified THCA synthase (20 μg) was resolved by SDS-PAGE (12.5% acrylamide gel) and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The N-terminal amino acid sequence was analyzed on an Applied Biosystems 473A protein sequencer. Peptide fragments to determine internal sequences were prepared by two different procedures (proteinase Glu-C digestion and cyanogen bromide cleavage). In-gel proteinase digestion (19Cleveland D.W. Fischer S.G. Kirschner M.W. Laemmli U.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1102-1106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was carried out by incubating purified THCA synthase (20 μg) and endoproteinase Glu-C (1 μg) for 30 min in polyacrylamide gels. For cyanogen bromide digestion, purified enzyme (20 μg) was dissolved in 70% (v/v) formic acid containing 1% (w/v) cyanogen bromide and incubated at 30 °C for 10 h in the dark. The resulting peptide fragments were separated by SDS-PAGE (15% acrylamide gels), electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and sequenced as described above. RNA Extraction and Reverse Transcription—Total RNA was extracted from rapidly expanding leaves of C. sativa by the acid-guanidinium-phenol-chloroform method (20Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar), and three cDNA pools were prepared. cDNA pools 1 and 2 were synthesized by reverse transcription of the above RNA solution using an oligo-dT primer (5′-(T)17-3′) and oligo-dT primer possessing an adapter (5′-GACTCGTCTAGAGGATCCCG(T)17-3′), respectively. Both reactions were carried out with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturer's protocol (Toyobo). cDNA pool 3 was prepared by attaching poly-dA tails to cDNA pool 1 using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase according to the manufacturer's protocol (Takara). Cloning and Sequencing of THCAS—The following oligonucleotide primers were used in this study: degenerate primers a (5′-CGGAATTCTTYCCIGARYTIGGNAT-3′), b (5′-CGGGATCCGTRTACCAIARYTCRTA-3′), and c (5′-GGGGTACCAAYCCIMGIGARAAYTTYYTIAA-3′), designed from peptide sequences of THCA synthase, FPELGI, YELWYT, and NPREAFLK, respectively; gene-specific primers d (5′-CGGGATCCCACCACTGTAGAAGATGGTTG-3′), e (5′-GAAGATGTAGGAGCTGGGATG-3′), f (5′-GGGGTACCGGAGGAGATTTCAGAATCAGC-3′), g (5′-GGTTTTGGGGTTGTATCAGAG-3′), h (5′-GGGGTACCGTCGTGTTGAGTGTATACGAG-3′),i(5′-CGGGATCCATGAATTGCTCAGCATTTTC-3′), and j (5′-CTAGCTGAGCTCTTAATGATGATGCGGTG-3′) and adapter primers k (5′-GACTCGTCTAGAGGATCCCG(T)17-3′) and l (5′-GACTCGTCTAGAGGATCCCG-3′). All cDNA fragments were amplified in 50-μl reaction mixtures consisting of primers (degenerate primer, 1 μm; gene-specific or adapter primer, 0.2 μm), 0.2 mm dNTPs, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), and Taq DNA polymerase (1 unit). Amplifications of cDNA fragments of THCA synthase were performed as follows. The core cDNA fragment (∼350 bp) was obtained by PCR with degenerate primers a and b in the presence of cDNA pool 1 as template (30 cycles of 1 min each at 94, 37, and 72 °C). The cDNA fragment encoding the 5′-upstream region up to the protein N terminus (∼1000 bp) was amplified with primers c and d (30 cycles of 1 min each at 94, 50, and 72 °C). The 3′-terminal and 5′-terminal regions were amplified by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) method (21Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4314) Google Scholar). 3′-RACE was performed with a subsequent nested PCR. The first round of PCR was conducted with gene-specific primer e, adapter primer l, and cDNA pool 2 as template (30 cycles of 1 min each at 94, 55, and 72 °C). The ∼650-bp 3′-RACE product was amplified with gene-specific primer f, adapter primer l, and the first round PCR product as template (30 cycles of 1 min each at 94, 55, and 72 °C). The 5′-RACE product (∼200 bp) was obtained as follows. The first round of PCR was performed with gene-specific primer g and adapter primer k in the presence of template cDNA pool 3 (5 cycles of 1 min each at 94, 50, and 72 °C and then 30 cycles of 1 min each at 94, 55, and 72 °C). The second round of PCR (30 cycles of 1 min each at 94, 55, and 72 °C) was performed with gene-specific primer h, adapter primer l, and the PCR product from the first reaction. All PCR products were digested at restriction sites introduced via PCR primers, cloned into the vector pUC119, transformed into competent Escherichia coli Top10F′, and sequenced on an Applied Biosystems 310 genetic analyzer. The obtained sequences were combined using the SeqEd program (Applied Biosystems). Expression of the Recombinant THCA Synthase in Tobacco Hairy Roots—Full-length THCAS was amplified using gene-specific primers i and j in the presence of template cDNA pool 1 (30 cycles of 1 min each at 94, 55, and 72 °C) with KOD DNA polymerase according to the manufacturer's instructions (Toyobo). The amplified cDNA was ligated into the vector pUC119 and sequenced as described above to confirm that its nucleotide sequence was identical to that of THCAS. The cDNA was excised from pUC119/THCAS at BamHI and SacI sites and recloned into the expression vector pBI121 (Clontech). The resulting construct was introduced into Agrobacterium rhizogenes strain 15834 (22White F.F. Nester E.W. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 141: 1134-1141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by tri-parental mating (23Van Haute E. Joos H. Maes M. Warren G. Van Montagu M. Schell J. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The tobacco stems were infected directly with A. rhizogenes using needles and then cultured for 2 weeks at 25 °C on solidified Gamborg B5 media. Hairy roots generated from the infected sites were cultured on solidified B5 media containing cefotaxime and kanamycin to eliminate bacteria and select transformants. Adventitious shoots generated from hairy roots were cultured on the same media. Total soluble proteins were extracted from roots and shoots by homogenizing samples in buffer A (10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 3 mm mercaptoethanol). THCA synthase activity in protein samples was measured as described below. For the bioconversion of CBGA into THCA, ∼2-cm tips of the root expressing THCA synthase were inoculated in 30 ml of liquid B5 medium in 100-ml flasks and pre-cultured for 2 weeks at 25 °C with gentle shaking (90 rpm). Then 1 mg of CBGA was added to the medium, and the hairy roots were further cultured under the same conditions. The THCA produced in the hairy roots and culture medium was quantified using HPLC as previously described (9Taura F. Morimoto S. Shoyama Y. Mechoulam R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 9766-9767Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Expression of THCA Synthase in Insect Cell Culture—For baculoviral expression THCAS was excised from pUC119/THCAS at BamHI and SacI sites and recloned into the donor vector pFastBac1 (Invitrogen). Then THCAS was transposed into the bacmid DNA within E. coli DH10Bac (Invitrogen). The recombinant baculovirus harboring THCAS was prepared by transfection of Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cells with the bacmid using Cellfectin reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). For protein production, cells cultured in Sf-900 II medium (Invitrogen) were infected with the recombinant baculovirus. Total cellular proteins were extracted with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5) containing 3 mm mercaptoethanol and 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40. THCA synthase activity in the culture medium, and cell extract was measured as described below. For purification of the recombinant THCA synthase, a 1000-ml suspension culture of Sf9 cells (∼2.0 × 106 cells/ml) was infected with virus at a multiplicity of infection of 1.0. The culture was harvested 72 h after infection and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was directly applied to a hydroxylapatite column (1.0 × 10.0 cm) equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with three column volumes of the same buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with a 600-ml linear gradient of buffer A to 0.5 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 3 mm mercaptoethanol. Fractions containing THCA synthase activity were concentrated and dialyzed against buffer A. The dialysate was applied to another hydroxylapatite column (1.0 × 10.0 cm). The column was washed with three column volumes of the same buffer, and THCA synthase was eluted with a 600-ml gradient of NaCl (0-2 m) in buffer A. The most active fractions were concentrated, dialyzed against buffer A, and used for the following biochemical characterization. Spectroscopic Characterization of THCA Synthase and Its Peptide Fragment—For fluorescence analysis, the recombinant purified THCA synthase was dissolved in 100 mm sodium citrate buffer (pH 4.0) at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. The sample was irradiated at 450 nm, and the fluorescence emission spectrum was measured on a Hitachi Model F-2000 fluorometer. Flavin peptide was prepared and characterized as follows. 100 μg of THCA synthase was precipitated with 5% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid, resuspended in buffer A, and then incubated with trypsin and chymotrypsin (each 1 μg) at 37 °C for 5 h. Insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation after the addition of trichloroacetic acid (final concentration, 5%). The resulting flavin peptide solution was neutralized with 2 m KHCO3 and treated with phosphodiesterase at 37 °C for 30 min. Alternatively, the peptide solution was heated at 110 °C for 10 min. Fluorescence emission spectra of peptide samples before and after phosphodiesterase or heat treatment were analyzed as described above. The release of AMP from flavin peptide was detected enzymatically by using adenylate kinase as described by Barzu and Michelson (24Barzu O Michelson S. FEBS Lett. 1983; 153: 280-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For absorption measurements, the recombinant purified THCA synthase was dissolved in buffer A (3.5 mg/ml). The absorption spectrum was measured on a Hitachi Model U-2001 spectrophotometer. Construction of Mutant cDNAs—The mutant cDNAs were prepared by PCR-based mutagenesis as described by Higuchi et al. (25Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2080) Google Scholar). Briefly, two overlapping PCR fragments were generated incorporating the codon for the new amino acid, and then the second reaction amplified the full-length mutant cDNA. PCRs were conducted with KOD DNA polymerase. This procedure was used in the construction of all site-directed mutants (H92A, R108A, R110A, H114A, and H208A). The mutant oligonucleotides (sense) were: H92A, 5′-AAATAACTCCGCTATCCAAG-3′; R108A, 5′-GCTTGCAGATTGCAACTCGAAG-3′; R110A, 5′-GATTCGAACTGCAAGCGGTGGC-3′; H114A, 5′-AAGCGGTGGCGCTGATGCTGAG-3′; R208A, 5′-ATTGATGCAGCCTTAGTCAA-3′. The prepared mutant cDNAs were introduced into pFastbac1, and sequenced. The mutant enzymes were expressed by the baculovirus expression system as described above. THCA Synthase Assay—The standard reaction mixture consisted of 200 μm CBGA, 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100 and 100 mm sodium citrate buffer (pH 5.0) in a total volume of 500 μl. The reaction was started by adding 100 μl of enzyme solution, and the mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 2 h. After termination of the reaction with 600 μl of methanol, a 50-μl aliquot was subjected to analytical HPLC as described previously (9Taura F. Morimoto S. Shoyama Y. Mechoulam R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 9766-9767Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The Km and Vmax values for CBGA were calculated from Lineweaver-Burk double-reciprocal plots of the velocity curves of the reaction with increasing concentrations of CBGA. To examine the molecular oxygen requirement of THCA synthase, the substrate and enzyme solutions were preincubated with glucose oxidase and catalase in the presence of glucose (26Fabian J. J. Bacteriol. 1965; 89: 921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The hydrogen peroxide generated after the THCA synthase reaction was quantified using a horseradish peroxidase reaction with 4-aminoantipyrin as substrate (27Green M.J. Hill H.A.O. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 3-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). cDNA Cloning and Structural Characteristics of THCA Synthase—The cloning of THCAS was carried out by reverse transcription and polymerase chain reactions. To design degenerate PCR primers, we first analyzed the partial amino acid sequences of the purified enzyme. Along with the N-terminal sequence containing 15 amino acid residues as previously revealed (9Taura F. Morimoto S. Shoyama Y. Mechoulam R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 9766-9767Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar), we determined a further 10 amino acid residues by optimizing the sequencing conditions (Table I). Concerning the internal sequences, the purified enzyme was treated with cyanogen bromide or endoproteinase Glu-C, and the resulting fragments (CNBr-1, CNBr-2, and Glu-C-1) were N-terminally sequenced (Table I).Table IN-terminal and internal amino acid sequences of THCA synthaseProtein/PeptideSequenceN terminusNPRENFLKXFSKHIPNNVANPKLVCNBr-1XKSFPELGIKKCNBr-2YELWYTASWEKQEDNGlu-C-1IXEXAIPFPHRA Open table in a new tab When PCR was carried out using the degenerate primers designed from CNBr-1 and CNBr-2, a ∼350-bp PCR product was obtained. We next amplified a cDNA fragment (∼1000 bp) using respective degenerate and gene-specific primers from the N-terminal sequence and the above PCR product. Furthermore, the amplification of cDNA fragments containing 3′- and 5′-end regions was achieved by 3′- and 5′-RACE respectively, and finally, the full-length THCAS was obtained using gene-specific primers from 3′- and 5′-RACE products. THCAS is the first gene involved in cannabinoid biosynthesis to be cloned. THCAS consisted of a 1635-nucleotide open reading frame encoding 545 amino acid residues (Fig. 2). The deduced primary structure contained all the amino acid sequences determined by N-terminal sequencing of the purified enzyme or its digestion products (CNBr-1, CNBr-2, and Glu-C-1). PSORT analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence indicated that the region containing 28 amino acid residues starting from the first methionine is a cleavable signal peptide, consistent with the result obtained by the N-terminal sequencing of the intact enzyme (Fig. 2). Hence, we concluded that mature THCA synthase consists of 517 amino acid residues. However, the theoretical molecular mass (58,597 Da) calculated from the amino acid composition of the deduced mature protein is apparently lower than the value (∼75 kDa) obtained by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the enzyme purified from C. sativa (9Taura F. Morimoto S. Shoyama Y. Mechoulam R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 9766-9767Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar). We assumed that in plants THCA synthase undergoes post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, since eight possible Asn glycosylation sites were confirmed to be present in mature THCA synthase (Fig. 2). An important finding regarding the structure of THCA synthase was obtained by comparing the primary structure with those of other proteins using the FASTA program. Surprisingly, THCA synthase catalyzing oxidocyclization of the geranyl moiety in CBGA had no similarity to the monoterpene cyclases, which cyclize geranyl pyrophosphate (28Colby S.M. Alonso W.R.

Biophys. 2003; 15: 267-276Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In contrast, THCA synthase showed high homology (40.2% identity in a 535-amino acid overlap) to BBE in Eschscholzia californica (13Dittrich H. Kutchan T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9969-9973Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) and ∼49% overall identity to hypothetical proteins in various plants such as Vigna unguiculata, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Helianthus annuus. Among these proteins, BBE is a well investigated oxidase that catalyzes the oxidative cyclization of (S)-reticulin into (S)-scoulerine (35Steffens P. Nagakura N. Zenk M.H. Phytochemistry. 1985; 24: 2577-2583Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Detailed biochemical characterization has demonstrated that BBE is a covalently flavinylated enzyme and that the flavin moiety is involved in the removal of electrons from the substrate (36Kutchan T.M. Dittrich H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24475-24481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a bacterial covalently flavinylated enzyme, 6-hydroxy-d-nicotine oxidase (6-HDNO) in Arthrobacter oxidans (37Brühmüller M. Möhler H Decker K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 29: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 38Brandsch R. Hinkkanen A.E. Mauch L. Nagursky H. Decker K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 167: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), also exhibited considerable homology (24.7% identity in a 466-amino acid overlap) with THCA synthase. These results implied an evolutionary relationship between THCA synthase and these flavoenzymes. In addition, motif analysis suggested that THCA synthase is also a flavinylated enzyme; the sequence (Arg-Ser-Gly-Gly-His), which is characteristic of flavin-binding sites in flavoproteins such as BBE and 6-HDNO (36Kutchan T.M. Dittrich H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24475-24481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 39Mauch L. Bichler V. Brandsch R. FEBS Lett. 1989; 257: 86-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), was confirmed in THCA synthase (Fig. 2).

https://openalex.org/W2020877995,"Animals sense various ranges of temperatures by cutaneous thermal stimuli. Transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) is a cation channel activated at a warm temperature (over 30 °C) in exogenously expressed cells. We found in the present study that TRPV4 is essential in thermal hyperalgesia at a warm temperature in vivo. TRPV4–/– and TRPV4+/+ mice exhibited the same latency of escape from 35–50 °C hotplates. Neuronal activity in the femoral nerve, however, revealed that the number and activity level of neurons decreased in response to a warm temperature in TRPV4–/– mice. TRPV4–/– mice displayed a significantly longer latency to escape from the plates at 35– 45 °C when hyperalgesia was induced by carrageenan without changes in foot volumes. TRPV4 therefore determines the sensitivity rather than the threshold of painful heat detection and plays an essential role in thermal hyperalgesia.

Sensation of warm to hot temperatures is an essential afferent neural activity in animals. An insight into the molecular basis of this sensation has been obtained by discovery of a capsaicin receptor, transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) 1The abbreviations used are: TRPV, transient receptor potential vanilloid; ANOVA, analysis of variance.1The abbreviations used are: TRPV, transient receptor potential vanilloid; ANOVA, analysis of variance. (1Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D. Nature. 1997; 389: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (6875) Google Scholar). TRPV1 encodes a nonselective cation channel protein originally identified as the receptor for capsaicin, the principal pungent constituent in hot peppers. In addition to capsaicin and related vanilloid compounds, this channel is activated by acidic pH or by painfully hot temperatures. Responses to noxious heat are diminished in mice lacking TRPV1 (2Caterina M.J. Leffler A. Malmberg A.B. Martin W.J. Trafton J. Petersen-Zeitz K.R. Koltzenburg M. Basbaum A.I. Julius D.

Therefore, TRPV1 plays an essential role in the detection of hot temperature. However, a significant component of heat responsiveness remains in TRPV1-knock-out mice and in skin-nerve preparations explanted from them (2Caterina M.J. Leffler A. Malmberg A.B. Martin W.J.

The mechanisms by which mammals detect innocuous warm temperatures are even less well understood than the mechanism underlying noxious thermosensation. A subset of sensory nerve fibers responsive to heat ranging from 30 to 42 °C has been identified in vivo in a number of mammalian species (4Hensel H. Iggo A. Witt I. J. Physiol. (London). 1960; 153: 113-126Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 5Iggo A. J. Physiol. (London). 1969; 200: 403-430Crossref Scopus (234) Google Scholar), although the heat transduction mechanisms accounting for such responsiveness have not been clarified. Recently, it has been reported that two TRPV1-related ion channel proteins, TRPV3 and TRPV4, can be activated by mild temperature elevations exceeding ∼30–35 °C (6Peier A.M. Reeve A.J. Andersson D.A. Moqrich A. Earley T.J. Hergarden A.C. Story G.M. Colley S. Hogenesch J.B. McIntyre P. Bevan S. Patapoutian A. Science. 2002; 296: 2046-2049Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar, 7Watanabe H.

TRPV3 and TRPV4 are located in cultured keratinocytes and play an essential role in the detection of warm temperatures and hypoosmolarity in vitro (8Chung M.K. Lee H. Mizuno A. Suzuki M. Caterina M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21569-21575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). We previously found that TRPV4 might be a mediator of sensory neuron responsiveness to hypoosmolarity as well as a contributor to mechanical nociception (9Alessandri-Haber N. Yeh J.J. Boyd A.E.

However, the role of TRPV4 in the detection of warm temperatures in vivo remains obscure. The mice lacking TRPV1 showed impairment in detection of chemically induced inflammatory pain when tested on hot-plates over 50 °C (3Davis J.B. Gray J. Gunthorpe M.J. Hatcher J.P. Davey P.T. Overend P. Harries M.H. Latcham J. Clapham C. Atkinson K. Hughes S.A. Rance K. Grau E. Harper A.J. Pugh P.L. Rogers D.C. Bingham S. Randall A. Sheardown S.A. Nature. 2000; 405: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (1463) Google Scholar). Carrageenan is a widely used reagent known for the ability to induce an acute inflammation. Carrageenan is a sulfated polysaccharide extracted mainly from an alga. When injected into the hind paw of a rat, foot volume had increased at 3 h after injection, the gain of which was used as an indicator of the inflammation or as an assay to test anti-inflammatory drugs (12DiRosa M.J. J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 1972; 24: 89-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). In the first 1.5 h of the early phase of inflammation, thermal hyperalgesia is observed without remarkable edema. Thus use of such inflammatory agents may amplify the role of TRPV4 in thermal sensation in vivo. We thus examined the contribution of TRPV4 to the detection of warm temperatures and to chemically induced hyperalgesia using TRPV4-knock-out mice. Animals—Mice were maintained on ad libitum diet chow and tap water for drinking. TRPV4-knock-out mice were backcrossed into a C57BL/6J inbred strain (Clea Japan Inc., Tokyo) to 4–5 generations. The male TRPV4 null (TRPV4–/–) mice and the wild type (TRPV4+/+) mice were used at 8–12 weeks of age for hotplate tests and at 10–24 weeks of age for recordings of neuronal discharges. Foot volumes before and after injection of capsaicin, carrageenan, or a vehicle were measured by immersion of the foot in water. The Animal Experiment Committee at the Jichi Medical School approved all of the experimental procedures used in this study. Hotplate Test—The hotplate test was performed by a conventional method. A mouse placed on a thermal plate jumped over a fence (13 cm in height) to escape from the temperature. The duration (s) until escape was measured. The test was performed in triplicate for each mouse. Acute Inflammatory Responses—Injections of chemical reagents were performed under brief anesthesia with ether inhalation. For carrageenan hypersensitivity, carrageenan (20 mg/ml, Sigma) was suspended in an isotonic saline solution and injected into the plantar surfaces of both hind paws in a volume of 20 μl by using a 26-gauge needle under brief anesthesia with ether. After 20 min, mice were tested for thermal sensitivity by the hotplate test. For capsaicin hypersensitivity, capsaicin (20 mg/ml, Sigma) in an isotonic saline solution containing 10% ethanol and 0.5% Tween 20 was injected into both hind paws in a volume of 20 μl. After 20 min, thermal sensitivity was tested as described above. Recording and Analysis—Recordings were performed under anesthesia with urethane (1 g/kg, intraperitoneal). To apply thermal stress immediately, an aluminum pipe perfused with temperature-controlled water was attached to the hind paw of the mouse. The temperature on the surface of the hind paw was measured with a thermometer. Frequency of discharges in vivo from the hind limbs was electrically measured with a DAM-8 amplifier (World Precision Instruments, Inc., Sarasota, FL) using a method described previously (11Suzuki M. Mizuno A. Kodaira K. Imai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22664-22668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Femoral neural signals recorded over a period of 15 s were stored on a computer and analyzed. Signal-to-noise ratios greater than 3 were stored, and the rates of discharges were determined using the burst analysis program in pSTAT (Axon Instruments, Inc., Union City, CA). This method enables simultaneous detection of a few neuronal activities. We measured activations of three neurons at most in the same recording when they were discriminated by magnitudes of amplitude. The data were analyzed using Student's t test or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. With a rise in hotplate temperature over 35 °C, a significant decrease in the latency of response was observed compared with the latency of response observed at room temperature. An increase in the temperature of the hotplate decreased the latency of response regardless of the genotype (Fig. 1). We next examined responses of neurons in the hind paw to warm temperature by recording femoral nerve activities. We measured neuronal discharges of several levels through a microelectrode located in the extracellular space. Two representative levels of neuronal discharge are shown in Fig. 2a. In TRPV4+/+ mice, we found that the activity level with higher amplitude increased when the temperature of the hind paw was increased to 40 °C within 15 s. Mean count of discharges in the following 15 s were expressed as frequency (Hz). Neurons with discharges that increased by at least 1 Hz in response to the high temperature were regarded as sensitive neurons. About 80% (46 of the 56 trials) of the neurons in TRPV4+/+ mice were sensitive to a temperature of 40 °C. The number of sensitive neurons was much less (19 of the 129 trials) in TRPV4–/– mice, the difference between the numbers of sensitive neurons in TRPV4–/– and TRPV4+/+ mice being statistically significant (Fig. 2b, chi-square test). With a rise in foot temperature, warmth-sensitive neuronal activity began at about 33 °C in TRPV4+/+ mice. Neuronal activity in TRPV4–/– mice hardly began until over 40 °C. Although the threshold of temperature was not exactly calculated, we observed that temperature-sensitive neuronal activity began at about 33 °C in TRPV4+/+ mice and at about 40 °C in TRPV4–/– mice. Most of the neuronal activities in TRPV4–/– mice were high threshold-type (Fig. 2c). We observed another type of activity in TRPV4–/– mice. This activity was greatest around 30 °C and then decreased during the rise in temperature. We also observed a time-dependent rundown when the foot was maintained at 40 °C in TRPV4–/– mice. The activity levels of neurons in TRPV4–/– mice and in TRPV4+/+ mice at 40 °C were defined as the base-line activity. The rundown in activity could be observed for the next 1 min in which the activity level decreased similarly in TRPV4+/+ mice and in TRPV4–/– mice (Fig. 2d). Reproduction of the temperature-evoked discharge was examined in the same nerve. It took at least 30 min for recovery of the discharge in response to the high temperature. We therefore did not obtain an exact magnitude of discharge at 50 °C when we measured it after recording at 40 °C. We therefore independently examined the response of femoral nerve activity to heat (50 °C) on the hind paw. Surprisingly, the populations of heat-sensitive neurons in TRPV4+/+ mice (13 of 32 trials) and TRPV4–/– mice (22 of 42 trials) were not different. The frequencies of discharge by the warmth (to 40 °C) and heat (to 50 °C) are summarized in Fig. 3a. Discharge was obtained 3–5 times in each mouse. At temperatures from 25 to 40 °C, the mean frequency of discharge in TRPV4+/+ mice increased significantly (from 4.3 ± 0.7 to 7.2 ± 1.0 Hz, n = 56, p < 0.01, paired t test), whereas the mean frequency of discharge in TRPV4–/– mice was not altered (from 3.6 ± 0.5 to 3.1 ± 0.4 Hz, n = 129). At temperatures from 25 to 50 °C, the mean frequencies of discharge in TRPV4+/+ and TRPV4–/– mice increased significantly. The frequency of heat-responsive discharge in TRPV4+/+ mice increased from 4.1 ± 0.7 to 10.0 ± 1.2 Hz (n = 32), and the mean frequencies of discharge in TRPV4–/– mice increased from 3.4 ± 0.4 to 8.1 ± 1.3 Hz (n = 42). The magnitudes of basal levels were significantly different. Based on the data above, temperature-sensitive activities were analyzed separately (Fig. 3b). There were 19 nerves capable of response to warm temperatures (from 2.9 ± 1.0 to 5.5 ± 1.0 Hz) in TRPV4–/– mice. The warmth-sensitive nerves in TRPV4+/+ mice were activated from 3.3 ± 0.6 to 8.8 ± 1.0 Hz (n = 46). The increments of discharges were analyzed by two-way ANOVA, and the result indicated a significant difference (p < 0.001). The magnitude (5.6 ± 0.8 Hz) of evoked activity in TRPV4+/+ mice was significantly different from the magnitude (2.6 ± 0.5 Hz) of evoked activity in TRPV4–/– mice. Therefore, both the numbers and magnitudes of evoked activity of 40 °C-sensitive neurons in TRPV4–/– mice were decreased in comparison with the numbers and magnitudes of evoked activity in TRPV4+/+ mice. At temperatures from 25 to 50 °C, the mean frequencies of discharge in TRPV4+/+ and TRPV4–/– mice increased significantly. The frequency of heat-responsive discharge in TRPV4+/+ mice increased from 7.0 ± 0.9 to 11.9 ± 1.24 Hz (n = 13), and the frequency of heat-responsive discharge in TRPV4–/– mice increased from 1.7 ± 0.4 to 7.4 ± 1.3 Hz (n = 22). The basal levels were significantly different. In contrast to the warmth-sensitive activity, neuronal discharge evoked by heat in TRPV4–/– mice was not significantly different from neuronal discharge evoked in TRPV4+/+ mice (two-way ANOVA). The magnitude (5.0 ± 1.4 Hz) of evoked activity in TRPV4+/+ mice was not significantly different from the magnitude (5.6 ± 1.1 Hz) of evoked activity in TRPV4–/– mice. Therefore, the number of heat-sensitive neurons in TRPV4–/– mice was the same as that in TRPV4+/+ mice, and the magnitude of evoked activity of the neurons in TRPV4–/– mice was not significantly different from the magnitude of evoked activity of the neurons in TRPV4+/+ mice. Hyperalgesic response to thermal stimuli associated with inflammation was tested by injecting carrageenan into the hind paw and subsequent stimulation by a hotplate. We examined the recovery time of escape latency because brief anesthesia with ether was used for the injection. Twenty min was required to reproduce the same latency. The hind paw did not appear to be swollen during this procedure. Analysis of the carrageenan-induced hind paw inflammation showed that there were no significant differences between the volumes of the lower legs in TRPV4–/– and TRPV4+/+ mice either before or after injection of the irritants (0.26 ± 0.03 g before injection, 0.27 ± 0.03gat20 min after injection, 0.25 ± 0.03 g at 4 h after injection, n = 12, p > 0.1, ANOVA). At 20 min after carrageenan injection, TRPV4+/+ mice at 40 °C exhibited a significant decrease in latencies compared with base-line pre-inflammation responses (n = 10, paired t test, p < 0.001), whereas TRPV4–/– mice did not exhibit a difference in latencies compared with base-line pre-inflammation responses (n = 10) (Fig. 4a). Significant differences between carrageenan-injected TRPV4+/+ and TRPV4–/– mice were found at all temperatures tested except 50 °C (Fig. 4b). To investigate the neuronal response to carrageenan, we identified warmth-sensitive neurons and then injected carrageenan. We observed that carrageenan-induced discharges were quite different in magnitude from the discharges of the warmth-sensing neurons (n = 20). Nonetheless, the threshold of warmth-sensitive neuronal activity was lowered at 20 min after injection of carrageenan in TRPV4+/+ mice. On the other hand, warmth-sensitive neurons of the high threshold-type (n = 7) or of the low threshold-type, possessing peak activity in 30 °C (n = 2), remained unchanged in TRPV4–/– mice. We could find one neuron in TRPV4–/– activated at 29 °C like that in TRPV4+/+ after injection of carrageenan. Thus, knockout of TRPV4 eliminated the generation of the carrageenan-induced thermal hyperalgesic response of the femoral neurons. We also injected capsaicin and found no significant swelling in our experimental setting (leg volumes, 0.26 ± 0.03 before injection, 0.27 ± 0.02 at 20 min after injection, and 0.27 ± 0.02 at 4 h after injection). In contrast to carrageenan injection, 2 of the 20 warmth-sensitive neurons showed sensitivity to capsaicin. Hotplate tests revealed significant differences between latencies at all temperatures tested, including 50 °C, in capsaicin-injected TRPV4+/+ and TRPV4–/– mice (Fig. 5). TRPVs are multisensitive cation channels that are potentiated by temperature (TRPV1, > 42 °C (1Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D. Nature. 1997; 389: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (6875) Google Scholar); TRPV2, > 52 °C (13Caterina M.J. Rosen T.A. Tominaga M. Brake A.J. Julius D. Nature. 1999; 398: 436-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar), TRPV3, > 31 °C (6Peier A.M. Reeve A.J. Andersson D.A. Moqrich A. Earley T.J. Hergarden A.C. Story G.M. Colley S. Hogenesch J.B. McIntyre P. Bevan S. Patapoutian A. Science. 2002; 296: 2046-2049Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar), TRPV4 > 25 °C (7Watanabe H. Vriens J. Suh S.H. Benham C.D. Droogmans G. Nilius B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47044-47051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar)) in heterogeneously expressed cells. The present results suggested that TRPV4 plays a major role in the detection of a warm temperature rather than a hot temperature in vivo. TRPV4 plays a major role in determining temperature sensitivity. The range of temperatures activating TRPV4 in vitro is compatible with the present findings. The number and discharge frequency of warmth-sensitive neurons in TRPV4–/– mice were clearly decreased, whereas the number and discharge frequency of heat-sensitive neurons in TRPV4–/– mice, presumably possessing TRPV1, were not different in activity and in number (Fig. 3). In TRPV1-knock-out mice, escape latency in the hotplate test (over 50 °C) after injection of carrageenan was not changed, whereas escape latency at warm temperatures has not been tested (2Caterina M.J. Leffler A. Malmberg A.B. Martin W.J. Trafton J. Petersen-Zeitz K.R. Koltzenburg M. Basbaum A.I. Julius D. Science. 2000; 288: 306-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (2845) Google Scholar). It is therefore reasonable to assume that TRPV1-containing neurons play a major role in heat detection by determining the threshold of pain when exposed to harmful heat. TRPV3 is another warm temperature-sensitive channel that has been proposed to form a heterogeneous multimer with TRPV1 in sensory neurons (14Smith G.D. Gunthorpe M.J. Kelsell R.E. Hayes P.D. Reilly P. Facer P. Wright J.E. Jerman J.C. Walhin J.P. Ooi L. Egerton J. Charles K.J. Smart D. Randall A.D. Anand P. Davis J.B. Nature. 2002; 418: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). Thus, whether TRPV3 plays a role in the detection of hot or warm sensations in vivo will remain unclear until experiments using TRPV3-knock-out mice are performed. The sigmoid relation of neuronal activity against temperature was shifted to the left in TRPV4+/+ mice (Fig. 4) by injection of carrageenan, whereas neurons with high and low threshold-type activities were still observed in TRPV4–/– mice. Neurons with high threshold-type activities exhibited the sigmoid relation and may contain TRPV1/TRPV3. The activity of this type at warm temperature is not influenced by carrageenan-induced inflammation. Neurons with low threshold-type activities exhibited a decrease in activity at over 35 °C and may detect temperatures lower than 30 °C because maximum activity was observed at around 30 °C. Molecules that detect this range of temperatures have not been identified in vitro or in vivo. Such molecules might be detected in the future by using TRPV4–/– mice. Warm temperature-sensitive neurons, which are apparently different from pain-sensitive neurons, are found in various species, including humans and monkeys (15Hardy J.D. Goodell H. Wolf H.G. Science. 1951; 114: 149-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 16LaMotte R.H. Campbell J.N. J. Neurophysiol. 1978; 41: 509-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Warmth-sensitive neurons were not sensitive to carrageenan and only 10% of them were sensitive to capsaicin in the present study. Warm temperature-sensitive neurons have been shown to possess mechanosensitive and chemosensitive units (16LaMotte R.H. Campbell J.N. J. Neurophysiol. 1978; 41: 509-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 17Adelson D.W. Wei J.Y. Kruger L. J. Neurophysiol. 1997; 77: 2989-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These findings are in accordance with the characteristics of TRPV4–/– mice, which exhibit impaired responses to pressure and acetic acid irritation (11Suzuki M. Mizuno A. Kodaira K. Imai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22664-22668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). In TRPV4–/– mice, inflammatory and thermal hyperalgesia induced by capsaicin and carrageenan was remarkably suppressed at a warm temperature. The contribution of TRPV4 to hyperalgesia has been suggested in a situation in which hypotonicity increases the TRPV4-mediated current in primary afferent nociceptive nerve fibers through prostaglandin E2 (9Alessandri-Haber N. Yeh J.J. Boyd A.E. Parada C.A. Chen X. Reichling D.B. Levine J.D. Neuron. 2003; 39: 497-511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). We injected isotonic solution as a vehicle and did not find significant swelling of the hind paw at 20 min after the injection of the chemical irritants. Mouse foot swelling does not occur even 4 h after the injection (3Davis J.B. Gray J. Gunthorpe M.J. Hatcher J.P. Davey P.T. Overend P. Harries M.H. Latcham J. Clapham C. Atkinson K. Hughes S.A. Rance K. Grau E. Harper A.J. Pugh P.L. Rogers D.C. Bingham S. Randall A. Sheardown S.A. Nature. 2000; 405: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (1463) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined the direct influence of chemical irritants rather than the indirect effect of swelling that caused mechanical stress to induce neural discharges. In this situation, many factors in addition to prostaglandin E2 play roles in hyperalgesia. Mechanisms of hyperalgesia have been investigated with reagents and various knock-out mice lacking receptors (18Wu W.P. Hao J.X. Halldner-Henriksson L. Xu X.J. Jacobson M.A. Wiesenfeld-Hallin Z.

Neuroscience. 2003; 120: 847-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), mediators (21Zhang L. Hoff A.O. Wimalawansa S.J. Cote G.J. Gagel R.F. Westlund K.N. Pain. 2001; 89: 265-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and ion channels (22Chen C.C. Zimmer A. Sun W.H. Hall J. Brownstein M.J. Zimmer A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8992-8997Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 3Davis J.B. Gray J. Gunthorpe M.J. Hatcher J.P. Davey P.T. Overend P. Harries M.H. Latcham J. Clapham C. Atkinson K.

It is interesting that carrageenan-induced hyperalgesia is blocked by activation of cannabinoid receptors (23Quartilho A. Mata H.P. Ibrahim M.M. Vanderah T.W. Porreca F. Makriyannis A. Malan Jr., T.P. Anesthesiology. 2003; 99: 955-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 24Nackley A.G. Makriyannis A. Hohmann A. Neuroscience. 2003; 119: 747-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). On the other hand, anandamide, a second messenger of cannabinoid receptors, activates TRPV4 in vascular endothelial cells (25Watanabe H. Vriens J. Prenen J. Droogmans G. Voets T. Nilius B. Nature. 2003; 424: 434-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). Mechanisms other than the cannabinoid pathway should be considered for the activation of TRPV4 under the condition of carrageenan-induced hyperalgesia. It was recently suggested from the results of a study using antisense oligonucleotides that TRPV4 may play a role in the detection of taxol-induced inflammation at room temperature (26Alessandri-Haber N. Dina O.A. Yeh J.J. Parada C.A. Reichling D.B. Levine J.D. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4444-4452Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The results suggesting the importance of TRPV4 in chemically induced inflammation are compatible with the present findings. Furthermore, they have suggested that activation of TRPV4 by taxol depends on the Src tyrosine kinase. Thus there are at least two pathways to activate TRPV4, the anandamide-arachidonic and the Src tyrosine kinase pathways. Although mediators and second messengers of chemical-induced inflammation may communicate by a complex mechanism, TRPV4 is one of the final pathways for sensing inflammation at a warm temperature. There are several sites and cells that sense warm temperature. In addition to neurons, keratinocytes possess TRPV4 and TRPV3 and outward cation currents are evoked by a temperature of 42 °C. Most keratinocytes from a TRPV4–/– mouse lacked the ability to respond to a warm temperature, although the current based on TRPV3 partially remained (8Chung M.K. Lee H. Mizuno A. Suzuki M. Caterina M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21569-21575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Thus, TRPV4 in keratinocytes also plays an important role in the mechanism of thermal hyperalgesia. Thermosensitive channels can be targets of drugs to relieve pain. Acid-sensing cation channel 3 (22Chen C.C. Zimmer A. Sun W.H. Hall J. Brownstein M.J. Zimmer A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8992-8997Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) and TRPV1 (3Davis J.B. Gray J. Gunthorpe M.J. Hatcher J.P. Davey P.T. Overend P. Harries M.H. Latcham J. Clapham C. Atkinson K. Hughes S.A. Rance K. Grau E. Harper A.J. Pugh P.L. Rogers D.C. Bingham S. Randall A. Sheardown S.A. Nature. 2000; 405: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (1463) Google Scholar) have been reported to play important roles in thermal hyperalgesia. The importance of these channels has been indicated by results of an experiment using carrageenan-injected hind paws subjected to a temperature of > 50 °C by a highly intensified beam. However, the contribution of these channels in thermal hyperalgesia from moderate temperatures (35–45 °C) is negligible in vivo. The absence of warmth-sensitive neurons in TRPV4–/– mice was caused from knock-out of this gene. We have made mice lacking TRPV4 by insertion of a neomycin-resistant gene into the 4th exon. Thus, full-length mRNA was not detected in our TRPV4–/– mice. However, a part of the product of TRPV4 could be detected in our TRPV4–/– mice because an N-terminal spliced form of TRPV4 (amino acids 314 to end) might be produced in wild mice. This spliced form, if present, was not functionally active when exogenously expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells (27Suzuki M. Mizuno A. Hirao A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51448-51453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) or when endogenously detected in cultured keratinocytes (8Chung M.K. Lee H. Mizuno A. Suzuki M. Caterina M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21569-21575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Interestingly, others have independently constructed mice lacking TRPV4 in which the resistant gene disrupted an exon near the C-terminal region (28Liedtke W. Friedman J.M. Proc. Natl. Sci. Acad. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13698-13703Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). If their phenotype differs from ours, the difference may be because of the spliced form of TRPV4. We conclude from the results of this study that TRPV4 plays a major role in the detection of warmth in the sensory system and will become a novel target for treatment of inflammatory and thermal hyperalgesia.

https://openalex.org/W2026662955,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) is a nuclear hormone receptor that is critical for adipogenesis and insulin sensitivity. Ligands for PPARγ include some polyunsaturated fatty acids and prostanoids and the synthetic high affinity antidiabetic agents thiazolidinediones. However, the identity of a biologically relevant endogenous PPARγ ligand is unknown, and limited insight exists into the factors that may regulate production of endogenous PPARγ ligands during adipocyte development. To address this question, we created a line of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes that carry a β-galactosidase-based PPARγ ligand-sensing vector system. In this system, induction of adipogenesis resulted in elevated β-galactosidase activity that signifies activation of PPARγ via its ligand-binding domain (LBD) and suggests generation and/or accumulation of a ligand moiety. The putative endogenous ligand appeared early in adipogenesis in response to increases in cAMP, accumulated in the medium, and dissipated later in adipogenesis. Organically extracted and high pressure liquid chromatography-fractionated conditioned media from differentiating cells, but not from mature adipocytes, were enriched in this activity. One or more components within the organic extract activated PPARγ through interaction with its LBD, induced lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells as efficiently as the differentiation mixture, and competed for binding of rosiglitazone to the LBD of PPARγ. The active species appears to be different from other PPARγ ligands identified previously. Our findings suggest that a novel biologically relevant PPARγ ligand is transiently produced in 3T3-L1 cells during adipogenesis.

Most of these natural ligands bind PPARγ with relatively low affinity compared with the affinity of most bona fide ligands for nuclear receptors. Additionally, they are weak agonists and exist at concentrations in vivo that may be below the levels needed for biological relevance. For these reasons, their physiological significance and role as true endogenous activators for PPARγ have been uncertain.Adipogenesis is a complex process associated with coordinated changes in gene expression, cell morphology, and hormone sensitivity (18Rosen O.M. Smith C.J. Hirsch A. Lai E. Rubin C.S. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1979; 35: 477-499PubMed Google Scholar). Several transcription factors influence these processes, among which PPARγ and CCAAT enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBPs) have been extensively studied (19Umek R.M. Friedman A.D. McKnight S.L. Science. 1991; 251: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 20Wu Z. Xie Y. Bucher N.L. Farmer S.R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2350-2363Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Early gain-of-function studies showed that forced expression of PPARγ in cultured fibroblasts followed by treatment with exogenous ligands results in their efficient differentiation to mature adipocytes (9Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3093) Google Scholar).

Despite conclusive knowledge about the pivotal role that PPARγ plays in adipogenesis, surprisingly little is known about the production, regulation, and identity of endogenous ligands that activate PPARγ in specific cell types. It is possible, of course, that the receptor may respond solely to one or more nutritionally supplied lipid ligands and that no high affinity regulatory ligand is produced during adipogenesis. Even so, it would be critical to know the net effective concentration of intracellular ligands under a variety of situations and in cells such as adipocytes, where PPARγ activation plays a major role. To address this fundamental question, we have developed an autoregulated inducible reporter system to monitor production of PPARγ ligand activity during adipogenesis in vitro. Here, we present evidence that 3T3-L1 cells produce and release into the medium a hydrophobic ligand(s) specific for PPARγ. This activity is most abundant in the early stages of differentiation, is produced in response to a cAMP signal, and does not appear to be a previously described agonist. Our findings suggest that an as yet unidentified pathway for PPARγ ligand generation exists in 3T3-L1 cells. Activation of this pathway results in production of an endogenous PPARγ ligand that, along with the receptor itself, is likely to be a critical mediator of the adipogenic program.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Methylisobutylxanthine (MIX), insulin, dexamethasone, oil red O, 8-bromo-cAMP, forskolin, thyroid hormone, 17β-estradiol, trypsin, ethyl acetate, acetone, and a Lichrosorb SI-60 column were all purchased from Sigma. All-trans-retinoic acid, 9-cis-retinoic acid, baicalein, and WY-14643 were from BIOMOL Research Labs Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Acyl-, oleoyl-, myristoyl-, hexanoyl-, and palmitoyl-LPAs were from Avanti (Alabaster, AL). The Galacto-light kit was from Tropix Inc. (Foster City, CA); charcoal dextran-stripped fetal bovine serum (FBS) was from Hyclone Laboratories (Logan, UT); [35S]methionine (1175 Ci/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences; and rosiglitazone was from GlaxoSmithKline.Plasmid Construction—The pCMV-Gal4-PPARγ LBD and GST-PPARγ LBD plasmids were constructed by inserting the mouse PPARγ LBD cDNA (amino acids 163–476) into the pFA-CMV (Stratagene, L Jolla, CA) and pGEX2-TK (Amersham Biosciences) vectors, respectively. To generate the negative control β-galactosidase-monitoring system vector (C-MSV), UAS5 from pFR-Luc (Stratagene) and the hsp68 promoter fragments from pKS-hsp-lacZ (a gift from J. Rossant) were subcloned into pβGal-Basic (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). To generate the PPARγ-monitoring system vector MSVγ, the Gal4 DNA-binding and PPARγ LBDs from pCMV-Gal4-PPARγ were subcloned downstream of the UAS5-hsp68 promoter in C-MSV, replacing the lacZ coding region. Then, this plasmid was fused together with the C-MSV reporter plasmid to create the final MSVγ version. The pG5E1b-Luc and pGal4-TK-Luc reporter plasmids and the pCMX-βGal, pT7-TIF2 RID, pGal4-TIF2 RID, and pT7-RXR plasmids have been described previously (25Tzameli I. Pissios P. Schuetz E.G. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2951-2958Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar).In Vitro Interactions—GST protein purification and pull-down assays have been described previously (25Tzameli I. Pissios P. Schuetz E.G. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2951-2958Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 26Pissios P. Tzameli I. Kushner P. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 245-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Briefly, for the pull-down assay, GST-PPARγ LBD was bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated with 35S-labeled TIF2 RID for 20 min on ice. Then, 1 μm rosiglitazone and increasing amounts (0.25–1 μl) of organically extracted and concentrated control (C100×) or conditioned (CM100×) medium were added, and the reactions were incubated overnight at 4 °C. The next day, the beads were washed, and the bound proteins were eluted with 15 mm glutathione, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography. For the protease digestion assay, 2 μl of in vitro translated and 35S-labeled PPARγ was incubated with 2 μl of in vitro translated RXR. The complex was allowed to dimerize for 10 min on ice before EtOH, 1 μm rosiglitazone, or increasing amounts of C100× or CM100× were added. After a 30-min incubation, 250 ng of trypsin was added to the indicated tubes, and protein digestion was performed at room temperature for 7 min. Reactions were analyzed on a 15% SDS gel, after which the gel was dried and exposed to film. For the ligand binding competition assay, 100 μg of GST-PPARγ fusion protein was bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated at 4 °C in buffer containing 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 50 mm KCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 1–500 nm [3H]rosiglitazone (specific activity of 50 Ci/mmol; American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO) in the presence or absence of unlabeled rosiglitazone, control medium, conditioned medium, or medium from mature adipocytes (day 8 medium). At the end of the incubation, the protein pellets were washed extensively with buffer containing 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 75 mm KCl, 15% glycerol, 0.05% Triton X-100, and 0.5 mm EDTA to separate bound from free radioactivity. Bound radioactivity was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting.Cell Culture—3T3-L1 preadipocytes (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were plated in 12-well dishes and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) containing 10% calf serum. Differentiation was induced as described previously (27Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1975; 5: 19-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar). Briefly, at day 0 (2 days after confluence), the medium was changed to DMEM supplemented with 10% charcoal dextran-stripped FBS, 1 μm dexamethasone, 0.5 mm MIX, and 5 μg/ml insulin. 2 days later, the medium was replaced with DMEM supplemented with 10% charcoal dextran-stripped FBS and only 5 μg/ml insulin for an additional 2 days and then changed to DMEM supplemented with 10% charcoal dextran-stripped FBS without insulin. The medium was replenished every 2 days. At day 10, the lipid content was determined by staining the cells with oil red O. The stable cell lines of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes expressing either MSVγ or C-MSV were established by cotransfection of each vector with pWL-neo using a mammalian transfection kit from Stratagene. G418-resistant clones were selected and tested for β-galactosidase activity. Positive clones were propagated and maintained in DMEM containing 10% calf serum and 600 μg/ml G418.Transient Transfections and Reporter Assays—CV-1 cells were plated and maintained at 37 °C in DMEM with 10% FBS (Hyclone Laboratories) and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). For transient transfections, cells were plated in 24-well plates and maintained in DMEM with 10% charcoal dextran-stripped FBS for the duration of the experiment. All transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In some sets of experiments, cells were transfected with pCMV-Gal4-PPARγ LBD, a pCMV-Gal4-βGal as a reporter, and pTK-Luc (Stratagene) as a control for normalization. For mammalian one-hybrid assays, the cells were transfected with pGal4-TK-Luc as a reporter, pCMV-Gal4-PPARγ LBD, and pCMV-βGal as a control. For mammalian two-hybrid assays, pVP16-TIF2 RID was added to the transfection mixture. The next morning, the medium was changed, and ligands (organically extracted and 3× concentrated 3T3-L1 day 2 control medium (C3×) or 3T3-L1 day 2 conditioned medium (CM3×)) were added and incubated overnight. Cells were assayed for luciferase (Promega, Madison, MI) or β-galactosidase (Tropix Inc.) activity 24 h later according to the manufacturers directions. Similar results were obtained from at least four independent experiments. For some experiments, the relative β-galactosidase reporter activity was normalized to luciferase control activity, whereas for other experiments, the relative luciferase reporter activity was normalized to the β-galactosidase control activity.Organic Phase Extraction—Conditioned media from 3T3-L1 cells collected at days 0, 2, and 8 after initiation of differentiation and day 2 control medium were acidified with 0.1 n HCl and mixed with ethyl acetate/acetone (1:1, v/v). The mixture was vortexed and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min. The upper phase containing molecules soluble in organic solvents was transferred to a new tube, washed twice with saturated NaCl, and evaporated in a SpeedVac. For transfection assays, evaporated extracts were reconstituted in DMEM containing 10% charcoal dextran-stripped FBS (3× concentrated), and for in vitro interaction assays, extracts were reconstituted in EtOH (100× concentrated).Total RNA Extraction and Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—RNA from day 4 differentiating 3T3-L1 cells was extracted using an RNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA) and treated with DNase I (QIAGEN Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PPARγ, aP2, lipoprotein lipase, and GLUT4 mRNAs were quantitatively measured using a Stratagene MX 4000 Multiplex quantitative PCR system and a Stratagene single step quantitative reverse transcription-PCR kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was diluted in the range of 0.1–100 ng and used to establish standard curves for each individual gene. The quantitation of each mRNA was further normalized by the corresponding cyclophilin mRNA measurement.Prostaglandin J2Analysis—Organic extracts of conditioned media were subjected to micro-high performance thin layer chromatography for separation of lipid classes and confronted to the prostaglandin J2 standard. Samples were evaporated to dryness under nitrogen and resuspended in an equal volume of chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v). Aliquots were spotted on Whatman Silica Gel 60A plates and subjected to two consecutive developments in chloroform/ethanol/triethylamine/water (30:34:30:8, v/v/v/v) and hexane/ether (100:4.5, v/v). The positions and intensities of bands were determined by copper sulfate charring and spectrodensitometric analysis at 400 nm in a Shimadzu CS-9000U scanner in the reflectance mode.HPLC Fractionation—Organically extracted conditioned medium was vacuum-dried using an ATR vacuum centrifuge (Appropriate Technical Resources, Inc., Laurel, MD), resuspended in chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), and microdispersed in a Branson sonication bath. 50-μl aliquots were injected in a Waters HPLC using a Lichrosorb normal-phase column and a binary solvent system. Solvent A consisted of 100% chloroform, and solvent B was a mixture of chloroform/methanol/water (50:44.5:5.5). The separation method included 5 min of isocratic 100% solvent A and a linear gradient from 100% solvent A to 100% solvent B over 35 min, followed by 10 min of isocratic 100% solvent B and reconstitution of the original conditions. The flow rate was 1 ml/min, and fractions were collected on a time basis every 6 min.RESULTSGeneration of a PPARγ Ligand-monitoring System in 3T3-L1 Cells—PPARγ is a ligand-regulated nuclear hormone receptor that is indispensable in the process of adipogenesis both in vivo and in vitro (23Rosen E.D. Sarraf P. Troy A.E. Bradwin G. Moore K. Milstone D.S. Spiegelman B.M. Mortensen R.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1627) Google Scholar). It is therefore reasonable to hypothesize that a specific ligand is produced to activate PPARγ upon conversion of preadipocytes to mature lipid-containing adipocytes. To monitor the presence of such a ligand during adipogenesis, we developed and stably integrated ligand-inducible MSVγ in 3T3-L1 cells. The vector carries the Gal4 DNA-binding domain fused to the PPARγ LBD, located upstream of the β-galactosidase reporter gene. Both the PPARγ fusion protein and the β-galactosidase reporter are under the control of five Gal4-specific binding sites (UAS5) and the hsp68 minimal promoter (MSVγ) (Fig. 1A). The combination of UAS5 with the hsp68 minimal promoter and a receptor LBD has been successfully used previously in studies on reporter gene constructs both in vitro and in vivo (24Mata De Urquiza A. Solomin L. Perlmann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13270-13275Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We also generated a second reporter construct containing just the β-galactosidase gene driven by the UAS5-hsp68 minimal promoter to use independently as a negative control vector (C-MSV) (Fig. 1A). The two vectors were transfected in CV-1 cells to test for their ability to respond to the synthetic PPARγ ligand rosiglitazone. As shown in Fig. 1B, the ligand-monitoring system vector MSVγ responded well to 250 nm rosiglitazone in CV-1 cells, whereas the negative control vector C-MSV did not.The two vectors were then stably transfected in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, and two clones were selected for further experiments: the ligand-sensing effector clone 5B2 and the negative control clone UH12. Both cell lines showed normal lipid accumulation after induction of differentiation by standard protocols (Fig. 1C). Line 5B2 expressed PPARγ and C/EBPα at normal levels compared with the parental 3T3-L1 cells, and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake following induction of differentiation was also normal (data not shown). The data suggest that the 3T3-L1-based monitoring system line retains all the biological properties of adipocytes.PPARγ Ligand Production during Adipogenesis—Next, we tested for increases in β-galactosidase activity after induction of differentiation of 5B2 and UH12 cells. Cells were maintained in 10% charcoal dextran-stripped FBS for this and all subsequent experiments. 2 days after confluence (day 0), cells were induced to differentiate using the standard adipogenic mixture of MIX, insulin, and dexamethasone. At the indicated time points, cells were lysed and assayed for β-galactosidase activity. As shown in Fig. 2A, no changes in β-galactosidase activity were observed in the negative control line UH12 up to 12 days after initiation of differentiation. On the other hand, a robust increase in activity was observed in line 5B2 as early as 24 h after induction (day 1). The activity remained high for another 24 h, gradually decreased to basal levels by day 4, and remained low up to day 12 after differentiation.Fig. 2Production of a putative PPARγ ligand early in adipogenesis.A, at the indicated times after induction of differentiation with insulin, dexamethasone, and MIX, 5B2 and UH12 cells were assayed for β-galactosidase activity. B, 3T3-L1 cells were induced to differentiate by the standard adipogenic mixture at day 0 in the presence or absence of the specific PPARγ antagonist PD068235 (PD; 30 μm). 0–2 indicates addition of the antagonists for the first 2 days, and 2–4 indicates addition of the antagonists from days 2 to 4. At day 10, cells were fixed and stained with oil red O to visualize lipid content.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)If a PPARγ ligand required for adipogenesis is produced during a specific time window early in adipogenesis, then use of a highly specific PPARγ antagonist during the corresponding time frame should effectively block adipogenesis. Indeed, when 3T3-L1 cells were induced to differentiate in the presence of 30 μm PD068235, subsequent lipid accumulation was completely blocked. As shown in Fig. 2B, the presence of the antagonist from days 0 to 2 during differentiation effectively blocked adipogenesis, whereas addition of the antagonists after day 2 had no effect. Collectively, these data suggest that generation and/or accumulation of a ligand activity takes place between days 0 and 2 after induction of adipogenesis, the same time frame during which activation of the ligand-sensing system, through the LBD of PPARγ, was observed.Next, we designed experiments to assess the potential contribution of molecules present within serum to the activation of the monitoring system vector. For this, 5B2 cells were incubated in serum-free medium containing rosiglitazone, differentiation mixture (DIM), or its different components and then assayed for β-galactosidase activity. As shown in Fig. 3A, the β-galactosidase activity increased in a serum-independent manner. Treatment with either rosiglitazone or DIM increased activity by 3.5- and 4-fold, respectively. Interestingly, one of the adipogenic mixture components, MIX, had an effect similar to that of the complete mixture because it increased β-galactosidase activity 4-fold. MIX is generally assumed to exert its proadipogenic effects by inhibiting phosphodiesterases that break down cAMP, but data exist to suggest that it may work though other mechanisms as well (28Wong W.T. Nick H.S. Frost S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C91-C97Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore treated cells with forskolin, which increases cAMP via the activation of adenylate cyclase, or with the non-hydrolyzable analog 8-bromo-cAMP. Forskolin and 8-bromo-cAMP both increased β-galactosidase activity to levels similar to those achieved by MIX (Fig. 3B). In addition, transient transfection experiments in CV-1 cells showed that neither the adipogenic mixture nor its components separately or in combination activated the PPARγ LBD under conditions in which robust activation was observed by rosiglitazone (data not shown). Of note, previous work has demonstrated a similar requirement of cAMP signaling pathways in the adipogenic process (29Hamm J.K. Park B.H. Farmer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18464-18471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). It was shown that preadipocytes exposed to dexamethasone and insulin alone fail to differentiate and that addition of exogenous PPARγ ligands bypasses the defect and promotes adipogenesis in the absence of MIX (29Hamm J.K. Park B.H. Farmer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18464-18471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Collectively, these data suggest that production of the PPARγ ligand activity requires cAMP signaling pathways, is specific to preadipocytes and not other cell types, and is independent of pre-existing serum-derived activities.Fig. 3Increases in β-galactosidase activity under different conditions.A, 5B2 cells were plated in serum-free medium and stimulated with solvent (-); 500 nm rosiglitazone (R); DIM; or its components, dexamethasone (D), MIX (M), MIX + insulin (MI), insulin (I), and MIX + dexamethasone (MD), for 24 h.

In a search for 5-HT2A receptor-interacting proteins, we discovered that caveolin-1 (Cav-1), a scaffolding protein enriched in caveolae, complexes with 5-HT2A receptors in a number of cell types including C6 glioma cells, transfected HEK-293 cells, and rat brain synaptic membrane preparations. To address the functional significance of this interaction, we performed RNA interference-mediated knockdown of Cav-1 in C6 glioma cells, a cell type that endogenously expresses both 5-HT2A receptors and Cav-1. We discovered that the in vitro knockdown of Cav-1 in C6 glioma cells nearly abolished 5-HT2A receptor-mediated signal transduction as measured by calcium flux assays. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of Cav-1 also greatly attenuated endogenous Gαq-coupled P2Y purinergic receptor-mediated signaling without altering the signaling of PAR-1 thrombin receptors. Cav-1 appeared to modulate 5-HT2A signaling by facilitating the interaction of 5-HT2A receptors with Gαq. These studies provide compelling evidence for a prominent role of Cav-1 in regulating the functional activity of not only 5-HT2A serotonin receptors but also selected Gαq-coupled receptors. 5-Hydroxytryptamine 2A (5-HT2A) serotonin receptors are important for a variety of functions including vascular smooth muscle contraction, platelet aggregation, and the modulation of perception, cognition, and emotion.

Kroeze W.K. Sheffler D.J. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2004; 3: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). As with other GPCRs, elucidating the mechanisms of signal transduction and regulation for 5-HT2A receptors is likely to be of great relevance for the rational design of novel medications (6Gray J.A. Roth B.L. Science. 2002; 297: 529-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 7Raymond J.R. Mukhin Y.V. Gelasco A. Turner J. Collinsworth G. Gettys T.W. Grewal J.S. Garnovskaya M.N. Pharmacol.

In particular, one point where the regulation of GPCR signaling converges is the endocytic pathway (8Sorkin A. Von Zastrow M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 600-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, 9Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar), and therefore, this pathway is likely to play a role in various functions involving the 5-HT2A receptor.Prototypically, GPCRs are internalized via an integrated process involving arrestins and G-protein receptor kinases, a process that has been most elegantly elucidated for the β-adrenergic receptor (10Pierce K.L. Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 639-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (2064) Google Scholar), although many other proteins are also involved in the intracellular trafficking of GPCRs (6Gray J.A. Roth B.L. Science. 2002; 297: 529-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 11Whistler J.L. Enquist J. Marley A. Fong J. Gladher F. Tsuruda P. Murray S.R. Von Zastrow M. Science. 2002; 297: 615-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). For example, we have uncovered a cell type-specific, arrestin-independent, dynamin-dependent mechanism of 5-HT2A receptor regulation (12Bhatnagar A. Willins D.L. Gray J.A. Woods J. Benovic J.L. Roth B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8269-8277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 13Gray J.A. Sheffler D.J. Bhatnagar A. Woods J.A. Hufeisen S.J. Benovic J.L. Roth B.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1020-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In light of recent studies demonstrating that β-adrenergic receptors, in particular, are associated with caveolae and caveolin in their native milieu (14Rybin V.O. Xu X. Lisanti M.P. Steinberg S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41447-41457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 15Xiang Y. Rybin V.O. Steinberg S.F. Kobilka B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34280-34286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that 5-HT2A receptors might also be associated with caveolae-enriched membrane specializations and that this interaction might functionally modulate 5-HT2A-mediated signal transduction.Caveolae are small flask-shaped invaginations of the plasma membrane (16Anderson R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10909-10913Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar) containing high levels of cholesterol and glycosphingolipids and are initially characterized by the presence of the protein Cav-1 (17Rothberg K.G. Heuser J.E. Donzell W.C. Ying Y.S. Glenney J.R. Anderson R.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 673-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1853) Google Scholar). Caveolae differ biochemically from other specialized subdomains of the plasma membrane (16Anderson R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10909-10913Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). A family of caveolin proteins has been identified that includes caveolin-1, caveolin-2, and caveolin-3 (Cav-1, -2, and –3, respectively (18Razani B. Woodman S.E. Lisanti M.P. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 431-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar)), with Cav-1 and Cav-2 being expressed ubiquitously. Caveolae function is critically dependent on Cav-1 because caveolae are not formed in Cav-1 knockout mice (19Drab M. Verkade P. Elger M. Kasper M. Lohn M. Lauterbach B. Menne J. Lindschau C. Mende F. Luft F.C. Schedl A. Haller H. Kurzchalia T.V. Science. 2001; 293: 2449-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar); conversely, caveolin-deficient cells acquire caveolae when transfected with Cav-1 (20Fra A.M. Williamson E. Simons K. Parton R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8655-8659Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar).In prior studies, we found that caveolae were not normally required for the membrane targeting of 5-HT2A receptors heterologously expressed in either NIH 3T3 (21Berry S. Shah M. Khan N. Roth B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 306-313PubMed Google Scholar) or HEK-293 (12Bhatnagar A. Willins D.L. Gray J.A. Woods J. Benovic J.L. Roth B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8269-8277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) cells, although a recent study (22Dreja K. Voldstedlund M. Vinten J. Tranum-Jensen J. Hellstrand P. Sward K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 1267-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) indirectly implicated caveolae in 5-HT2A-mediated signal transduction in vascular smooth muscle cells. Even though prior studies have not implicated Cav-1 as a modulator of 5-HT2A receptor signaling, Cav-1 has been indirectly implicated as a regulator of GPCR signaling via unknown mechanisms (19Drab M. Verkade P. Elger M. Kasper M. Lohn M. Lauterbach B. Menne J. Lindschau C. Mende F. Luft F.C. Schedl A. Haller H. Kurzchalia T.V. Science. 2001; 293: 2449-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar).Here we report that both transiently transfected 5-HT2A receptors associate with Cav-1 in HEK-293 cells and endogenously expressed 5-HT2A receptors associate with Cav-1 in C6 glioma cells and rat brain synaptic membrane preparations. We also report that the RNAi-mediated knockdown of Cav-1 has profound functional consequences for 5-HT2A-mediated signal transduction in C6-glioma cells, a cell type that endogenously expresses both Cav-1 and 5-HT2A receptors. Most importantly, screening of C6 glioma cells for other Gαq-coupled receptors showed that knockdown of Cav-1 modulated the signaling of purinergic receptors but not of PAR-1 thrombin receptors in C6 glioma cells, suggesting that only a subset of Gαq-coupled receptors is regulated by Cav-1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDUREScDNA Constructs and Reagents—The construct coding for FLAG-tagged wild type (wt) rat 5-HT2A receptor (FLAG-5-HT2A) (12Bhatnagar A. Willins D.L. Gray J.A. Woods J. Benovic J.L. Roth B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8269-8277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) was modified by addition of an amino-terminal and cleavable signal peptide sequence (MKTIIALSYIFCLVFA; see Ref. 23Guan X.M. Kobilka T.S. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21995-21998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from influenza hemagglutinin and has been described elsewhere (24Xia Z. Gray J.A. Compton-Toth B.A. Roth B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21901-21908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The caveolin-1-myc cDNA was a gift from Gary Landreth (Case Western Reserve University), and the constitutively active Gαq mutant (Q229L) was from David Siderovski (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill). Thrombin receptor-activating peptide (TRAP) was a gift from Paul Di Corleto (Lerner Research Institute, Case Western Reserve University). All constructs containing inserts in the appropriate orientation were verified by automated sequencing (Cleveland Genomics, Cleveland, OH). 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) creatinine sulfate, ATP, and chlorpromazine were acquired from Sigma. [3H]Ketanserin and myo-[3H]inositol were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences.Transfection of HEK-293 Cells and C6 Glioma Cells—Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK-293) cells and C6 glioma cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 mg/ml) (Invitrogen) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Transient transfection of HEK-293 cells with FuGENE 6™ (Roche Applied Science) using a FuGENE to DNA ratio of 5:1 was performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations. A total of 6 μg of DNA was used in each co-transfection, 3 μg of which were FLAG-5-HT2A receptor or constitutively active G-protein (Gαq*) and 3 μg of which were DNA encoding cav-1-myc or GFP. In case of triple transfections with FLAG-5-HT2A receptor, cav-1-myc, Gαq, and/or GFP, 2 μg of each plasmid DNA was used. C6 glioma cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE2000 (Invitrogen). A total of 24 μg of DNA was used with 60 μl of LipofectAMINE as recommended by the manufacturer.Immunocytochemistry, Agonist-mediated Internalization, and Image Quantification—Dual-labeling immunocytochemistry was performed essentially as described before (12Bhatnagar A. Willins D.L. Gray J.A. Woods J. Benovic J.L. Roth B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8269-8277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and images of cells treated with vehicle and or agonist 5-HT (10 μm) were acquired digitally using a Zeiss 410 confocal microscope (Oberkochen, Germany) without saturation of pixel intensities. Images were subsequently analyzed for percent receptor internalization using MetaView software (Universal Imaging) as detailed previously (24Xia Z. Gray J.A. Compton-Toth B.A. Roth B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21901-21908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar).Co-immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot—Co-immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed essentially as detailed previously (24Xia Z. Gray J.A. Compton-Toth B.A. Roth B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21901-21908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 25Gray J.A. Bhatnagar A. Gurevich V.V. Roth B.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For visualization and immunoprecipitation of Cav-1, a polyclonal Cav-1 antibody (1:2000) (BD Transduction Laboratories) was used, and a monoclonal M2-anti-FLAG antibody preconjugated to agarose beads was used to immunoprecipitate FLAG-tagged 5-HT2A receptors. Wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) preconjugated to agarose beads (Sigma) was used to concentrate native 5-HT2A receptors from C6 glioma cells after solubilization in 1.5% CHAPS. A rabbit polyclonal FLAG antibody (1:1500) (Sigma) was used to detect FLAG-5-HT2A receptors. A monoclonal mouse Cav-1 antibody and protein A/G-agarose were used to co-immunoprecipitate native receptor and Cav-1 from C6 glioma cells and rat brain synaptic membrane preparation. Rat brain synaptic membranes were prepared from rat frontal cortex as described previously (26Roth B. Laskowski M. Coscia C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 10017-10023PubMed Google Scholar). The native 5-HT2A receptor was detected by using a polyclonal 5-HT2A carboxyl-terminal antibody (27Backstrom J.R. Sanders-Bush E. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1997; 77: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), a gift from Jon Backstrom (Vanderbilt University). The Gαq in immunoprecipitates, the constitutively active Gαq* mutant, and the endogenous wt Gαq in cell lysates were detected by a rabbit polyclonal Gαq antibody (1:2000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The immunoblots shown are representative of at least three independent experiments.RNAi-mediated Knockdown of Cav-1—A DNA vector-based siRNAi was designed to stably knock down the expression of Cav-1 in C6 glioma cells by Genscript. Briefly, a commercial algorithm for designing a specific siRNA was used (www.genscript.com/ssl-bin/app/rnai). The length of the siRNA target, GC % range, and the rat cDNA sequence of Cav-1 were entered into the algorithm and potential siRNA targets generated. The ranking of siRNA candidates was based on the commercial algorithm. The target sequence CACACAGTTTCGACGGCATCT (52.38% GC content) was cloned into pRNA-U6.1/neo under the control of U6 promoter and neomycin selection marker, which was used to select stable lines. This insert-containing vector was then transfected into C6 glioma cells, as described above, and the subsequent isolation of Cav-1-depleted C6 glioma cells was done after selection of stable individual clones by using 0.6 mg of geneticin/liter of cell culture medium. Forty eight clones were individually picked and expanded in selection medium. After passaging the cells a minimum of three times, lysates were prepared as described above. To evaluate the stable knockdown of expression of Cav-1, 10 μg of protein lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis probing for Cav-1. The clones, which showed maximal knockdown, were then maintained in the selection media containing 0.6 mg of geneticin/liter for further study. Lysates prepared from the clone with maximal knockdown of Cav-1 was also probed with rabbit polyclonal RSK1 (1:1000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse monoclonal Cav-2 (1:500) (BD Transduction Laboratories), and polyclonal rabbit Gαq antibodies.Microarray Analysis of C6 Glioma Cells—Nearly confluent plates of C6 cells were harvested using RNase-free conditions, and a sample preparation was done by the Gene Expression Array Core Facility at Case Western Reserve University (www.geacf.net), following methods recommended by Affymetrix (see Supplemental Material for full details). Briefly, total RNA was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen) followed by RNA clean up using Qiagen columns that were used to clean up cDNA and/or RNA as required using the manufacturer's protocol. This was followed by cDNA synthesis using an oligo(dT) primer coupled to T7 RNA polymerase promoter. Reverse transcription of RNA was done using Superscript II reverse transcriptase in a 20-μl reaction at 42 °C for 1 h. Second strand synthesis was carried out immediately in the presence of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I, RNase H, and DNA ligase. The reaction mixture was incubated for 2 h at 16 °C and an additional 5 min in the presence of T4 DNA polymerase. The reaction was terminated by addition of EDTA followed by cDNA clean up using Qiagen columns and storage overnight at –20 °C. In vitro transcription was used to generate cRNA by using a Bioarray High Yield ENZOkit (Affymetrix) followed by clean up of RNA samples. Purified in vitro transcribed cRNA was subjected to fragmentation at 94 °C for 35 min using 1× fragmentation buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.1, 100 mm KOAc, 30 mm MgOAc) and then placed on ice. Preconditioning for hybridization was done in 1× hybridization mixture (100 mm MES, 1 m [Na+], 20 mm EDTA, 0.01% Tween 20). Herring sperm and acetylated bovine serum albumin were added to a final concentration of 0.1 and 0.5 mg/ml, respectively. A 15-μl aliquot of a 20× mixture of in vitro transcripts of bacterial genes bioB, bioC, bioD, and cre were added to the mixture to give final concentrations of 1.5, 5, 25, and 100 pm, respectively. Control oligonucleotide was added to a final concentration of 50 pm. The amount of fragmentation reaction containing 15 μg of cRNA was added to the mixture, and the remaining volume was made up with molecular biology grade water. Preconditioning of the array chip was done in 1× hybridization buffer for 10–15 min at 45 °C with rotation (45 rpm). The preconditioning buffer was then removed from the chip chamber. Sample hybridization mixture was added to the chip and hybridized overnight (16 h) at 45 °C with rotation (45 rpm). For post-hybridization washing and staining, samples were recovered from the chips and stored in their original vials, and the hybridization chamber was filled with Buffer A (nonstringent, 6×), and hybridization was overnight (16 h) at 45 °C with rotation (45 rpm) in the sample hybridization mixture. For post-hybridization washing and staining samples were recovered from the chips and stored in their original vials. The hybridization chamber was filled with Buffer A (nonstringent, 6× SSPE (3 m NaCl, 0.2 m NaH2PO4, 0.02 m EDTA), 0.01% Tween 20). Modules in the Fluidics Station 400 were primed according to the Affymetrix protocol.Samples were loaded into the modules, and washing and staining were done in stringent buffer B (10 mm MES, 0.1 n [Na+], 0.01% Tween 20), which was also used in the protocol. The streptavidin/phycoerythrin stain mixture was as follows: 50 mm MES, 0.5 m [Na+], 0.025% Tween 20, 2 mg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin, 10 μg/ml streptavidin phycoerythrin.The amplification (antibody) solution mixture was as follows: 50 mm MES, 0.5 m [Na+], 0.025% Tween 20, 2 mg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mg/ml normal goat IgG, 3 μg/ml biotinylated antibody. All Chips were scanned twice. For data analysis, images obtained were converted into Microsoft Excel format using MAS5.0 software (Affymetrix). All chips were scaled to mean target intensity of 1500. Affymetrix present and absent calls were used. For comparisons between chips, genes with 2-fold differences in expression compared with controls were considered to be significantly differentially expressed.Radioligand Binding and Second Messenger Studies—Phosphoinositide hydrolysis assays with the constitutively active Gαq* were performed as described previously (24Xia Z. Gray J.A. Compton-Toth B.A. Roth B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21901-21908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Kinetic binding parameters (Bmax and Kd) were determined from binding assays with [3H]ketanserin, and the results were replicated in at least three separate experiments as detailed previously (24Xia Z. Gray J.A. Compton-Toth B.A. Roth B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21901-21908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Phosphoinositide hydrolysis data were analyzed by nonlinear regression using Prism 3.0 software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA), and saturation-binding data were analyzed by using GraphPad Prism. Measurements of p42/44 ERK phosphorylation were performed as described previously by using total p42/44 ERK for normalization (28Setola V. Hufeisen S.J. Grande-Allen K.J. Vesely I. Glennon R.A. Blough B. Rothman R.B. Roth B.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 1223-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Measurements of intracellular calcium mobilization on a Molecular Devices Flexstation were performed essentially as described recently (29Rothman R.B. Vu N. Partilla J.S. Roth B.L. Hufeisen S.J. Compton-Toth B.A. Birkes J. Young R. Glennon R.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 307: 138-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), with response normalized to the maximum with each agonist (5-HT, ATP, and/or TRAP).Statistical Analysis—Statistical significance for all studies was determined using a Student t test, and statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05.RESULTS5-HT2A Receptors Interact with Cav-1—We initially investigated whether 5-HT2A receptors and cav-1-myc can associate in vitro by co-transfecting HEK-293 cells with FLAG-tagged 5-HT2A receptors (FLAG-5-HT2A) and Myc-tagged Cav-1 (Cav1-myc). As shown in Fig. 1, A–C, FLAG-5-HT2A and Cav-1 were co-localized on both the cell surface of HEK-293 cells and in Cav-1-enriched intracellular vesicles. Most interestingly, following agonist administration to induce internalization, little additional 5-HT2A receptor internalization was induced in cells co-expressing Cav-1 (Fig. 1, D–F; see Fig. 1G for quantification).We next performed co-immunoprecipitation studies in HEK-293 cells co-transfected with FLAG-5-HT2A and Cav-1 to determine whether 5-HT2A receptors and Cav-1 interact. As can be seen, FLAG-tagged 5-HT2A receptors were co-immunoprecipitated robustly with Cav-1 (Fig. 2, 9th to 12th lanes), indicating that 5-HT2A receptors and Cav-1 associate with each other and are present in a complex in vitro. To establish the specificity of the interaction, we showed that cells co-transfected with Cav-1 and empty vector yielded minimal pull-down of Cav-1 (Fig. 2, 3rd and 4th lanes). Furthermore, no Cav-1 was pulled down from untransfected cells (Fig. 2, 1st and 2nd lanes) or from cells co-expressing 5-HT2A receptors and GFP (Fig. 2, 5th and 6th lanes). The interaction of FLAG-5-HT2A and Cav-1 was unaffected by agonist exposure (Fig. 2, compare 9th to 12th lanes). These findings demonstrated that Cav-1 forms a complex with 5-HT2A receptors in an agonist-independent fashion.Fig. 2Cav-1 interacts with native 5-HT2A receptors in HEK-293 cells. For these experiments, HEK-293 cells were either untransfected (1st and 2nd lanes) or transiently co-transfected with Cav-1 (3rd and 4th lanes), FLAG-5-HT2A + GFP (5th and 6th lanes; treated with vehicle), FLAG-5-HT2A + GFP (7th and 8th lanes; treated with 10 μm 5-HT for 5 min), FLAG-5-HT2A+ Cav-1 (9th and 10th lanes; treated with vehicle), and FLAG-5-HT2A + Cav-1 (11th and 12th lanes; treated with 10 μm 5-HT for 5 min). FLAG-tagged native 5-HT2A receptors were immunoprecipitated (IP) by a monoclonal FLAG antibody conjugated to Sepharose beads. A polyclonal Cav-1 antibody detected Cav-1myc, and a polyclonal FLAG antibody on Western blots detected FLAG-5-HT2A. A polyclonal Gαq antibody was used to probe for G-protein as lysate control. Representative immunoblots (IB) from a single experiment that has been replicated three times with equivalent results are shown. A and B, immunoblots from immunoprecipitates. C and D, immunoblots from cell lysates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We also examined whether 5-HT2A receptors and Cav-1 are associated in a milieu in which both 5-HT2A receptors and Cav-1 are endogenously expressed. Several cell lines reported to express 5-HT2A receptors were tested including an aortic smooth muscle cell line (A7R5 (30Doyle V.M. Creba J.A. Ruegg U.T. Hoyer D. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1986; 333: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar)), NIH 3T3 cells (31Saucier C. Albert P.R. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1998-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and C6 glioma cells (13Gray J.A. Sheffler D.J. Bhatnagar A. Woods J.A. Hufeisen S.J. Benovic J.L. Roth B.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1020-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). As controls, we also examined HEK-293 cells, which express little Cav-1, and GF-62 cells, which we have demonstrated previously (21Berry S. Shah M. Khan N. Roth B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 306-313PubMed Google Scholar) express little Cav-1. We found that C6 glioma cells expressed the highest levels of Cav-1, and these were therefore chosen for further study.Co-immunoprecipitation studies were then performed in C6 glioma cells and rat brain synaptic membrane preparations wherein endogenous Cav-1 was immunoprecipitated, and the immunoprecipitates were probed for endogenous 5-HT2A-like immunoreactivity. Fig. 3B shows that 5-HT2A receptors were co-immunoprecipitated with Cav-1 in C6 glioma cells, and Fig. 3C shows co-immunoprecipitation of native 5-HT2A receptors by Cav-1 from solubilized rat brain synaptic membrane preparations. As controls to verify the specificity of the interaction, 5-HT2A receptors were immunoprecipitated with protein-A/G beads conjugated to agarose in the absence (–) and/or presence of a monoclonal Cav-1 antibody (+). Fig. 3B, top panel, 1st lane, shows no immunoreactivity to 5-HT2A receptor antibody, and the 2nd lane shows that 5-HT2A receptors were co-immunoprecipitated with Cav-1. The 2nd panel from the top of Fig. 3B shows the 1st lane with minimal Cav-1 immunoreactivity (e.g. negative control lane), and the 2nd lane shows a large amount of Cav-1 was detected when Cav-1 was immunoprecipitated (e.g. positive control lane). The 3rd panel from the top of Fig. 3B shows representative immunoblots from cell lysates to detect total Cav-1. The bottom panel of Fig. 3B shows 5-HT2A-like immunoreactivity in C6 glioma lysates.Fig. 3Cav-1 interacts with native 5-HT2A receptors in C6 glioma cells and rat brain homogenates. For these experiments cell lysate was prepared from various cell lines, and equivalent amounts of protein were loaded for all sets in duplicate. Representative immunoblot from a single experiment that has been replicated three times with equivalent results shows the expression of Cav-1 in HEK-293 cells, C6 glioma cells, A75R5, 3T3, and a 3T3 cell line stably expressing 5-HT2A receptors (GF62; A). B, 5-HT2A receptors were immunoprecipitated (IP) with Cav-1 in C6 glioma cells. The top panel shows that 5-HT2A receptors were immunoprecipitated by monoclonal Cav-1 antibody (2ndlane) preconjugated to protein-A/G beads. The 2nd panel from the top shows robust Cav-1 detection in the immunoprecipitate in the presence of Cav-1 antibody (2nd lane (+)). The 3rd and 4th panels from the top represents the immunoblots used to detect Cav-1 and 5-HT2A receptor proteins, respectively, in the total C6 cell lysate. C, 5-HT2A receptors were immunoprecipitated with Cav-1 from rat brain synaptic membrane preparations. Top panel shows 5-HT2A receptors were co-immunoprecipitated with Cav-1 antibody and protein A/G-agarose (2nd lane)"

Depletion of membrane cholesterol by methyl-β-cyclodextrin resulted in reduced Na+-dependent glutamate uptake in primary cortical cultures. Glial glutamate transporter EAAT2-mediated uptake was more sensitive to this effect. Cell surface biotinylation and immunostaining experiments revealed that the loss of cholesterol significantly altered the trafficking of EAAT2 to the plasma membrane as well as their membrane distribution. These effects were also observed in neuronal glutamate transporter EAAT3 but to a lesser extent. Furthermore, the treatment of mouse brain plasma membrane vesicles with methyl-β-cyclodextrin resulted in a significant reduction in glutamate uptake, suggesting that cholesterol depletion has a direct effect on the function of the glutamate transporters. Plasma membrane cholesterol is localized within discreet microdomains known as lipid rafts. Analyses of purified lipid raft microdomains revealed that a large portion of total EAAT2 and a minor portion of total EAAT1, EAAT3, and EAAT4 were associated with lipid rafts. Artificial aggregation of lipid rafts in vivo resulted in the formation of larger EAAT2-immunoreactive clusters on the cell surface. The purified lipid raft-associated fractions were capable of Na+-dependent glutamate uptake. Our data suggest that the glutamate transporters, especially EAAT2, are associated with cholesterol-rich lipid raft microdomains of the plasma membrane and that the association with these cholesterol-rich microdomains is important for excitatory amino acid transporter localization and function.

Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter used in the mammalian nervous system. Na+-dependent excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) 1The abbreviations used are: EAAT, excitatory amino acid transporter; biotin-CTXβ, biotinylated cholera toxin β subunit; chol-MeβCD, cholesterol complexed with MeβCD; conA, concanavalin A; dbcAMP, dibutyryl cyclic AMP; DHK, dihydrokainic acid; DRM, detergent-resistant microdomain; GTRAP, glutamate transporter-associated protein; mAb, monoclonal antibody; MeβCD, methyl-β-cyclodextrin; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; pAb, polyclonal antibody; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PMV, plasma membrane vesicle; BSA, bovine serum albumin; SNARE, soluble NSF attachment protein receptors. 1The abbreviations used are: EAAT, excitatory amino acid transporter; biotin-CTXβ, biotinylated cholera toxin β subunit; chol-MeβCD, cholesterol complexed with MeβCD; conA, concanavalin A; dbcAMP, dibutyryl cyclic AMP; DHK, dihydrokainic acid; DRM, detergent-resistant microdomain; GTRAP, glutamate transporter-associated protein; mAb, monoclonal antibody; MeβCD, methyl-β-cyclodextrin; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; pAb, polyclonal antibody; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PMV, plasma membrane vesicle; BSA, bovine serum albumin; SNARE, soluble NSF attachment protein receptors. are responsible for the uptake of glutamate as well as aspartate into the cell. Five mammalian Na+-dependent excitatory amino acid transporters have been cloned to date: EAAT1 (GLAST), EAAT2 (GLT-1), EAAT3 (EAAC1), EAAT4, and EAAT5 (1Danbolt N.C. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 1-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3672) Google Scholar). Within the nervous system, EAAT1 and EAAT2 are found primarily on astrocytes, whereas EAAT3 and EAAT4 are found principally on neurons (2Rothstein J.D. Martin L. Levey A.I. Dykes-Hoberg M. Jin L.

Neurosci. 1997; 9: 1902-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). EAAT5 is expressed primarily in the retina (5Arriza J.L. Eliasof S. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4155-4160Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). How are the expression and function of these transporters regulated? Stimulation of mouse cortical primary astrocyte cultures with glutamate increases the surface expression of EAAT1 (6Duan S. Anderson C.M. Stein B.A. Swanson R.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10193-10200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expression and function of glutamate transporters can be regulated by activation of intracellular signaling molecules (7Davis K.E.

Chem. 2000; 275: 5228-5237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The function of glutamate transporters can also be modulated by interactions with other proteins. GTRAP3–18 interacts with and negatively modulates EAAT3-mediated glutamate transport (9Lin C.G. Orlov I. Ruggerio A.M. Dykes-Hoberg M. Lee A. Jackson M. Rothstein J.D. Nature. 2001; 410: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 10Butchbach M.E.R. Lai L. Lin C.G. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 292: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). GTRAP41 (β-spectrin-3) and GTRAP48 (RhoGEF-11) significantly increase EAAT4-mediated glutamate uptake (11Jackson M. Song W. Liu M.Y. Jin L. Dykes-Hoberg M. Lin C.G. Bowers W.J. Federoff H.J. Sternweis R.C. Rothstein J.D. Nature. 2001; 410: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Plasma membrane organization may be another means of regulating glutamate transporter function. Lipid rafts are lipid-protein microdomains of the plasma membrane that are enriched cholesterol and glycosphingolipids (12Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5059) Google Scholar). These lipid raft microdomains have been implicated in regulating the trafficking and clustering of membrane-associated proteins as well as their intracellular signaling molecules. Lipid rafts are present on the surfaces of neurons as well as glial cells; many proteins of diverse functions including nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (13Brusès J.L. Chauvet N. Rutishauser U. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 504-512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propanoic acid-type glutamate receptors (14Suzuki T. Ito J. Takagi H. Saitoh F. Nawa H. Shimizu H.

A. 2001; 98: 5619-5624Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) have been shown to be associated with lipid rafts. Are glutamate transporters associated with these lipid raft microdomains? Proteoliposome reconstitution experiments have shown that cholesterol is required for Na+-dependent [3H]glutamate uptake (20Shouffani A. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6002-6008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, we have previously reported that Na+-dependent [3H]glutamate uptake is significantly reduced by long term treatment with the cholesterol-depleting agent methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MeβCD) (21Butchbach M.E.R. Guo H. Lin C.G. J. Neurochem. 2003; 84: 891-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These results suggest that membrane cholesterol is important for the function of glutamate transporters. In this study, we investigated the role of membrane cholesterol in the function of glutamate transporters. We found that glutamate transporters are partially associated with novel cholesterol-rich, lipid raft-containing microdomains of the plasma membrane. EAAT2 is more strongly associated with these types of lipid rafts than the other glutamate transporters expressed in the brain. Furthermore, the association with these cholesterol-rich microdomains is important for EAAT localization and function. Reagents—Methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MeβCD; mean degree of substitution = 10.5–14.7), cholesterol complexed with MeβCD (chol-MeβCD; 44 mg cholesterol/g solid), and biotinylated cholera toxin β subunit (biotin-CTXβ) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Brij-58 (Surfact-Amps 58), EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin, immobilized NeutrAvidin, Coomassie Plus Protein Assay, and SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate were obtained from Pierce.

The mouse anti-β-actin mAb was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, the mouse antiflotillin-1 mAb was from BD Biosciences (San Diego, CA), the mouse anti-transferrin receptor mAb was from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA), and the rabbit pAbs directed against EAAT1, EAAT2, and EAAT4 as well as GTRAP41 and GTRAP48 were generously provided by Dr. Jeffrey D. Rothstein. Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti chicken IgG, Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-chicken IgG, Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-rabbit IgG, Alexa Fluor 488 avidin, and Amplex Red cholesterol assay kit were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Unless otherwise stated, all other reagents were obtained from standard commercial sources. Rat Primary Cortical Cultures—Neurons and astrocytes were cultured from newborn (12–24 h) rat cortices. The cortices were dissected out of the brains, incubated in activated papain for 30 min at 37 °C, triturated by repeated pipetting with a small bore pipette, and plated onto poly-d-lysine-coated (1 mg/ml) plastic culture dishes or glass slides. These cultures were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (Invitrogen) containing 25 mm glucose, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 19.4 μm pyridoxine hydrochloride, 2 mm glutamine, 0.5% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), and 1% B-27 supplement (Invitrogen). Plasma Membrane Vesicle Isolation—Adult male mouse forebrains were homogenized in 10 volumes homogenization buffer (320 mm sucrose in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) using a Dounce homogenizer (20 passes with a type B pestle) followed by a 23-gauge needle (5 passes). The homogenates were then centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resultant supernatant (S1) was then centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The plasma membrane vesicle (PMV) pellet (P2) was then resuspended in Na+-containing or Na+-free Kreb's buffer. Discontinuous Sucrose Density Gradient Centrifugation—Adult male mouse brains were homogenized in 10 volumes of buffer A (150 mm NaCl, Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in 25 mm MES, pH 6.5, or buffer B (150 mm choline chloride, Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in 25 mm MES, pH 6.5) using a Dounce homogenizer (20 passes with a type B pestle) followed by a 23-gauge needle (5 passes). For the high salt fractionations, the concentration of NaCl in buffer A was adjusted to 1 m. The homogenates (diluted to 3 mg/ml protein) were then incubated with 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1% (v/v) Brij-58, or 1% (v/v) Lubrol WX for 60 min at 4 °C, after which sucrose was added to the samples to give a final concentration of 40% (w/v). 1 ml of each sample was overlaid with 1.8 ml of 30% (w/v) sucrose followed by 1.2 ml of 5% (w/v) sucrose and centrifuged for 16 h at 175,587 × g at 4 °C using a SW60 rotor (Beckman Coulter) and a L8-M Ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter). Ten 400-μl fractions were taken from each sample, and the pellet was resuspended in 400 μl of buffer (fraction 11). Cellular Cholesterol Assay—The cells were lysed in reaction buffer (5 mm cholic acid, 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, pH 7.4) for 30 min at 4 °C and then sonicated. The membrane cholesterol was measured using the Amplex Red cholesterol assay kit according to the manufacturer's directions except that cholesterol esterase was omitted from the reaction mixture. Fluorescence was measured with a GENios microplate reader (Tecan Company; λex = 545 nm, λem = 610 nm). The protein concentrations of the samples were determined using a Coomassie Plus protein assay according to the manufacturer's directions. The membrane cholesterol levels are expressed as specific fluorescence/mg protein. Glutamate Uptake Assay—Uptake of radiolabeled glutamate was monitored in cells as described previously (10Butchbach M.E.R. Lai L. Lin C.G. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 292: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Briefly, cultured cells grown on six-well plates were washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl and 320 mm sucrose, pH 7.4, and then incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with 10.2 nM l-[3H]glutamate (0.5 μCi; Amersham Biosciences) in either Na+-containing or Na+-free Kreb's buffer supplemented with 40 μm unlabeled glutamate. The cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and then lysed in 1 mm NaOH. To distinguish dihydrokainic acid (DHK)-sensitive [3H]glutamate uptake from DHK-insensitive uptake, samples were incubated with 300 μm DHK (Sigma-Aldrich) 30 min prior to uptake. For measuring the uptake of [3H]glutamate into PMVs, P2 fractions were resuspended in either Na+-containing or Na+-free Kreb's buffer, and 40 μg of synaptosomal protein sample were used in each assay. The samples were incubated in an equal volume of Na+-containing or Na+-free Kreb's buffer containing 10 μm l-glutamate supplemented with 2.04 nm l-[3H]glutamate (0.1 μCi/ml) for 4 min at 37 °C and then rapidly chilled on ice. The chilled samples were passed through Whatman glass microfiber filters, and the filters were then washed twice with ice-cold PBS. The filters were then placed into scintillation mixture (ScintiSafe Econo 1; Fisher) and incubated overnight with shaking prior to counting. [3H]glutamate uptake into DRMs and non-DRMs was accomplished as described above for uptake into PMV preparations except that 200 μl of each fraction was used per assay. The amount of radiolabeled glutamate was measured using a Beckman Coulter LS6500 multi-purpose scintillation counter (Beckman Instruments). The conversion of scintillation counts to fmol [3H]glutamate has been described previously (10Butchbach M.E.R. Lai L. Lin C.G. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 292: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Na+-dependent [3H]glutamate uptake was calculated by subtracting Na+-independent [3H]glutamate uptake (in Na+-free Kreb's buffer or buffer B for DRMs/non-DRMs) from the total [3H]glutamate uptake (in Na+-containing Kreb's buffer or buffer A for DRMs/non-DRMs). The protein concentrations of the samples were determined using a Coomassie Plus protein assay according to the manufacturer's directions. Na+-dependent [3H]glutamate uptake was expressed as fmol [3H]glutamate/mg protein/min. Lipid Raft Clustering—Cells grown on glass coverslips were incubated with 100 μg/ml biotin-CTXβ in PBS with 1% BSA for 60 min at 4 °C and then with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated avidin (1:100) in PBS with 1% BSA for 60 min at 4 °C. The cells were then fixed and processed for immunofluorescence. Immunofluorescence—Cells that were grown on glass coverslips were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, 50 mm sucrose, 400 mm CaCl2 in 100 mm phosphate buffer for 30 min at room temperature followed by thorough rinsing with PBS+ (0.1% saponin, 0.02% sodium azide in PBS). The coverslips were then blocked with PBS with BSA (10 mg/ml BSA in PBS+) for 30 min at room temperature and then incubated with primary antibody solution (chicken anti-GTRAP3–18 pAb (1:500), rabbit anti-EAAT2 pAb (1:500), or rabbit anti-EAAT3 pAb (1:500) in PBS with BSA) overnight at room temperature. After rinsing, the coverslips were then incubated with secondary antibody solution (Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti chicken IgG (1:1000), Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-chicken IgG (1:1000), or Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000) in PBS with BSA) for 60 min at room temperatures. The coverslips were then rinsed and mounted onto glass slides with ImmuMount (Shandon Lipshaw). Microscopy and Image Analysis—The images were obtained using a Zeiss 510 META Laser Scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NY) using either a 40× (NA = 1.3) or 100× (NA = 1.4) oil objective. A zoom factor of 6 was used for the images obtained with the 40× objective, whereas those obtained with the 100× objective were obtained with a zoom factor of 2. Optical sections were taken through the z axis of each cell at a thickness of 300 nm/section. For quantitative analysis of cluster characteristics, the images were obtained from an Axioskop 2 (Carl Zeiss) inverted microscopy with a 40× objective (numerical aperture, 0.75) using AxioVision 3.1. A collection of 20 slices (0.5 μm/slice) through the z plane were obtained for each image and were deconvolved using the regularized inverse filter algorithm. The following parameters were measured from the images: number of clusters, sectional area of the cell (μm2), area of the clusters (μm2), and intensity of the clusters (gray). Cluster density is defined by the following equation: cluster density (clusters/μm2) = (number of clusters)/(sectional area). Unit cluster area is defined by the following equation: unit cluster area (μm2/cluster) = (mean cluster area)/(number of clusters). Unit cluster intensity is defined by the following equation: unit cluster intensity (gray/μm2) = (mean cluster intensity)/(mean cluster area). Cell Surface Biotinylation—Labeling of proteins on the plasma membrane was accomplished by cell surface biotinylation as described previously (23Daniels G.M. Amara S.G. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 296: 307-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The cells were washed twice with PBS/CaMg (100 μm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 in PBS, pH 7.4) at room temperature and then incubated with biotinylation buffer (1 mg/ml EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin in PBS/CaMg) for 20 min at 4 °C with constant shaking. The cells were then incubated with quenching buffer (100 mm glycine in PBS/CaMg) for 45 min at 4 °C with constant shaking and then incubated with lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100 and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) in PBS, pH 7.4) for 30 min at 4 °C with constant shaking. The biotinylated proteins were recovered by incubation with 100 μl of immobilized NeutrAvidin (50% slurry) at 4 °C overnight with end-over-end rotation. The avidin beads were recovered by centrifugation (12,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C) and then washed four times with Lysis buffer. After washing, the beads were resuspended in 1×SDS-PAGE sample loading dye (1.7% SDS, 6% glycerol, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 0.002% bromphenol blue in 50.3 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8). Immunoblot Analysis—SDS-PAGE and electrotransfer of protein extracts was completed as described previously (10Butchbach M.E.R. Lai L. Lin C.G. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 292: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-EAAT1 pAb (1:200), rabbit anti-EAAT2 pAb (1:2000), rabbit anti-EAAT3 pAb (1:300), rabbit anti-EAAT4 pAb (1:200), chicken anti-GTRAP3–18 pAb (1:2500), rabbit anti-GTRAP41 pAb (1:200), rabbit anti-GTRAP48 pAb (1:100), mouse anti-β-actin mAb (1:500), mouse anti-transferrin receptor mAb (1:2000), or mouse anti-flotillin-1 mAb (1:250). The immunoreactive bands were detected using the SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate according to the manufacturer's directions. Band intensities were measured using the Scion Image release Beta 4.0.2 (Scion Corporation, Frederick, MD). Data Analysis and Statistical Analysis—The quantitative data are expressed as the means ± S.E. One-way analysis of variance was performed using Microsoft Excel 2002. Linear regression analysis was performed using SigmaPlot 2000 for Windows version 6.00 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Depletion of Membrane Cholesterol Results in Reduced Glutamate Uptake in Primary Cortical Cultures—We previously found that Na+-dependent [3H]glutamate uptake was significantly reduced by treatment with 252 μm MeβCD, a cholesterol-depleting agent, for 4 days (21Butchbach M.E.R. Guo H. Lin C.G. J. Neurochem. 2003; 84: 891-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To further investigate the role of cholesterol in the function of glutamate transporters, we examined the effect of transient exposure to 10 mm MeβCD. This dosage has been often used in cholesterol depletion experiments (24Li X. Galli T. Leu S. Wade J.B. Weinman E.J. Leung G. Cheong A. Louvard D. Donowitz M. J. Physiol. 2001; 537: 537-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Rat primary cortical cultures were used in this study. Our cultures primarily contained neurons, which expressed EAAT3, and type II astrocytes, which expressed EAAT2, as determined by immunostaining (data not shown). The cultures were treated with10 mm MeβCD for 3 and 30 min and then assessed for changes in [3H]glutamate uptake and membrane cholesterol content. The cultures were also treated with an equivalent amount of MeβCD complexed with cholesterol (chol-MeβCD; 1.5 mm cholesterol in 10 mm MeβCD) so as to determine whether the observed MeβCD-induced effects would be the result of cholesterol depletion. The cell number and the cell morphology were not visibly altered after these treatments. Na+-dependent [3H]glutamate uptake was significantly reduced by 64.5 ± 2.5% (n = 3; p = 0.00035) and 98.2 ± 0.1% (n = 3; p = 0.000029) in cultures exposed to MeβCD for 3 and 30 min, respectively; however, there was no significant change in the chol-MeβCD-treated cultures at 3 min, and [3H]glutamate uptake was increased by 23.1 ± 11.8% (n = 3; p = 0.071) at 30 min as compared with vehicle (Fig. 1A). Membrane cholesterol levels were significantly reduced in the MeβCD-treated cultures (60.5 ± 1.3% decrease at 3 min (n = 3; p = 0.000004) and 88.2 ± 2.0% decrease at 30 min (n = 3; p = 0.0004)) and were increased in the chol-MeβCD-treated cultures (13.9 ± 10.2% increase at 3 min (n = 3; p = 0.057) and 16.4 ± 11.6% increase at 30 min (n = 3; p = 0.076)) as compared with vehicle (Fig. 1B). Regression analysis revealed a linear relationship (R2 = 0.9434) between membrane cholesterol levels and Na+-dependent [3H]glutamate uptake upon exposure to MeβCD. To examine the effect of cholesterol depletion on different glutamate transporter subtypes, DHK (300 μm) was used to distinguish EAAT2-mediated glutamate uptake from uptake mediated by the other EAATs because DHK has a higher affinity for EAAT2 (25Arriza J.L. Fairman W.A. Wadiche J.I. Murdoch G.H. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5559-5569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that DHK-sensitive uptake was more profoundly affected by cholesterol depletion (reduced by 47.1 ± 10.1% n = 3; p = 0.040) than DHK-insensitive uptake (reduced by 17.4 ± 1.5%, n = 3; p = 0.011) after 3 min of exposure to MeβCD. These results indicated that depletion of membrane cholesterol results in reduced Na+-dependent glutamate transport, and EAAT2-mediated glutamate uptake appears more sensitive to this effect. Depletion of Membrane Cholesterol Alters the Membrane Distribution of EAAT2 and EAAT3—What are the mechanisms responsible for the decrease in Na+-dependent glutamate uptake observed in MeβCD-treated cortical cultures? We examined total EAAT2 and EAAT3 protein levels by immunoblot analyses. There was no change in EAAT2 protein level. For unknown reasons, EAAT3 protein could not be detected in these cell extracts by immunoblot analysis, but immunostaining showed no visible change in total intensity (see below). We then examined whether MeβCD alters the cell surface EAAT2 level using cell surface biotinylation assays. As shown in Fig. 2A, there was a decrease in the amount of surface (i.e. biotinylated) EAAT2 levels and a coordinate increase in the amount of nonsurface (i.e. nonbiotinylated) EAAT2 levels in the cultures treated with 10 mm MeβCD in a time-dependent manner as revealed by immunoblot analysis. MeβCD did not affect the amount of the membrane protein transferrin receptor protein present on the cell surface (Fig. 2A). As a specificity control, the intracellular protein β-actin was only found in the nonsurface fractions. Quantitative analysis of immunoreactive bands (i.e. EAAT2 band intensities normalized to those for β-actin) revealed that MeβCD reduced surface EAAT2 expression by 58.4 ± 1.8% (n = 3, p = 0.0000012) and 76.7 ± 1.8% (n = 3, p = 0.00000038) after 3 and 30 min of exposure, respectively (Fig. 2B). MeβCD-induced reduction in surface EAAT2 may result from increased endocytosis of EAAT2 present on the cell surface. We examined the effect of inhibition of receptor internalization on the MeβCD-induced reduction in surface EAAT2 by co-treating primary cortical cultures with 10 mm MeβCD and 250 μg/ml concanavalin A (conA), a nonspecific inhibitor of receptor internalization (26Toews M.L. Waldo G.L. Harden T.K. Perkins J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11844-11850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), for 30 min. The amount of surface EAAT2 protein is greater in cells treated with MeβCD and conA than those treated with MeβCD alone (Fig. 2C), suggesting that receptor-mediated endocytosis may be involved in the MeβCD-induced reduction in surface EAAT2. Immunostaining followed by confocal microscopy was performed to examine the effect of MeβCD on the localization of EAAT2 and EAAT3. As shown in Fig. 3, EAAT2 was primarily localized on the plasma membrane in discreet clusters in vehicle-treated astrocytes; however, the clusters appeared to disperse in the astrocytes treated with 10 mm MeβCD for 3 min (compare EAAT2 surface micrographs). Furthermore, a reduction in the intensity of EAAT2 staining on the cell surface with an increase in intracellular EAAT2 immunolabeling was observed (compare EAAT2 cross-micrographs). Quantitative analysis of cluster characteristics using deconvolution microscopy and image analysis showed a 26.4 ± 4.4% reduction (p = 0.014) in cluster number, a 21.2 ± 4.5% reduction (p = 0.025) in cluster size, and a 61"

Here we investigate the regulation of TTP expression in the mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7. We show that TTP mRNA is expressed in a biphasic manner following stimulation of cells with lipopolysaccharide and that the second phase of expression, like the first, is dependent on mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38. MAPK p38 acts through a downstream kinase to stabilize TTP mRNA, and this stabilization is mediated by an adenosine/uridine-rich region at the 3′-end of the TTP 3′-untranslated region. Hence TTP is post-transcriptionally regulated in a similar manner to several proinflammatory genes. We also demonstrate that TTP is able to bind to its own 3′-untranslated region and negatively regulate its own expression, forming a feedback loop to limit expression levels.

Many of the cytokines, chemokines, and other proteins involved in the inflammatory response to infection or injury are encoded by relatively short-lived mRNAs (1Kracht M. Saklatvala J. Cytokine. 2002; 20: 91-106Google Scholar, 2Clark A. Arthritis Res. 2000; 2: 172-174Google Scholar). These transcripts typically possess adenylate/uridylate-rich 3′-untranslated regions that contain multiple, often overlapping copies of the motif AUUUA (3Bevilacqua A. Ceriani M.C. Capaccioli S.

Saklatvala J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39470-39476Google Scholar). AREs contribute to transient patterns of proinflammatory gene expression by directing the rapid degradation of mRNAs following transient activation of transcription. Appropriate physiological responses to infection or injury may be dependent on this mechanism for tight regulation and constraint of cytokine expression. For example, the targeted deletion of a tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) ARE increases the stability of murine TNFα mRNA, prolonging the expression of this cytokine in response to inflammatory stimuli and resulting in a complex inflammatory disease (11Kontoyiannis D. Pasparakis M. Pizarro T.T. Cominelli F. Kollias G. Immunity. 1999; 10: 387-398Google Scholar). The half-lives of ARE-containing mRNAs are thought to be determined by their interactions with ARE-binding proteins that either promote or inhibit degradation (3Bevilacqua A. Ceriani M.C. Capaccioli S. Nicolin A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 195: 356-372Google Scholar, 4Brennan C.M. Steitz J.A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 266-277Google Scholar, 5Guhaniyogi J. Brewer G. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 265: 11-23Google Scholar). Several ARE-binding proteins have been described; however, clear evidence for a role in the regulation of mRNA stability exists in only a few cases. Promotion of mRNA decay is a property of the three mammalian members of the TIS11 family: TIS11 itself, also known as tristetraprolin (TTP); TIS11b, also known as butyrate response factor 1 (BRF1); and TIS11d, also known as butyrate response factor 2 (BRF2) (12Blackshear P.J.

These proteins possess a highly conserved central domain containing two repeats of the sequence YKTELC and two unusual Cys3-His zinc fingers but are otherwise not closely related. The conserved central domain mediates interactions with ARE sequences (18Blackshear P.J. Lai W.S. Kennington E.A. Brewer G. Wilson G.M. Guan X. Zhou P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19947-19955Google Scholar) and is also present in Caenorhabditis elegans (19Tabara H. Hill R.J. Mello C.C. Priess J.R. Kohara Y.

Thorn J.M. Goldsworthy S.M. Liu X. Blackwell T.K. Blackshear P.J. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 228: 133-145Google Scholar) proteins. Hence the TIS11 proteins may be members of an evolutionarily ancient family of post-transcriptional regulatory factors. They can function by promoting the deadenylation of mRNAs to which they bind and/or by enhancing the recruitment of the exosome (8Chen C.Y. Gherzi R. Ong S.E. Chan E.L. Raijmakers R. Pruijn G.J.

TTP mRNA is expressed with a characteristic immediate early pattern, peaking rapidly and then returning to near basal levels within 2–4 h following stimulation of 3T3 cells with growth factors or phorbol myristate acetate (23DuBois R.N.

TTP destabilizes TNFα mRNA; hence the induction of TTP gene expression by proinflammatory stimuli tends to limit the expression of TNFα (13Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1001-1005Google Scholar). Mice lacking TTP display increased TNFα mRNA stability, overexpression of the cytokine, and a chronic inflammatory disease similar to that caused by deletion of the TNFα ARE (13Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1001-1005Google Scholar, 29Taylor G.A. Carballo E. Lee D.M. Lai W.S. Thompson M.J. Patel D.D. Schenkman D.I. Gilkeson G.S. Broxmeyer H.E. Haynes B.F. Blackshear P.J. Immunity. 1996; 4: 445-454Google Scholar). Overexpression of granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and overexpression of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) are additional consequences of the TTP knockout (30Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Blood. 2000; 95: 1891-1899Google Scholar, 31Phillips K. Kedersha N. Shen L. Blackshear P.J. Anderson P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2011-2016Google Scholar). Less direct evidence suggests that other post-transcriptional targets of TTP may include interleukin 2 (IL-2) (26Raghavan A. Robison R.L. McNabb J. Miller C.R. Williams D.A. Bohjanen P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47958-47965Google Scholar), IL-3 (32Stoecklin G. Ming X.F. Looser R. Moroni C. Mol. Cell.

In a fibrosarcoma cell line BRF1 is essential for the destabilization of a reporter mRNA containing the IL-3 ARE (17Stoecklin G. Colombi M. Raineri I. Leuenberger S. Mallaun M. Schmidlin M. Gross B. Lu M. Kitamura T. Moroni C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4709-4718Google Scholar). The members of the TIS11 family are differentially regulated in a number of cell types (25Varnum B.C. Ma Q.F. Chi T.H. Fletcher B. Herschman H.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1754-1758Google Scholar, 34Maclean K.N. McKay I.A. Bustin S.A. Br. J. Biomed. Sci. 1998; 55: 184-191Google Scholar). 2T. Santalucia and A. R. Clark, unpublished observations. However, until knockouts of BRF1 and BRF2 are described, it will remain unclear what the physiological targets of these proteins are and to what extent the functions of the TIS11 family members overlap. It is now recognized that transient gene expression during inflammatory responses may involve not only the transient transcription of unstable mRNAs but also the dynamic regulation of mRNA stability (35Shim J. Karin M. Mol. Cells. 2002; 14: 323-331Google Scholar). For example IL-2 mRNA is stabilized by a JNK-dependent pathway in activated T cells (36Chen C.Y. Gherzi R. Andersen J.S. Gaietta G. Jurchott K. Royer H.D. Mann M. Karin M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1236-1248Crossref Google Scholar, 37Chen C.Y. Del Gatto-Konczak F. Wu Z. Karin M. Science. 1998; 280: 1945-1949Google Scholar), and GM-CSF mRNA is stabilized by an ERK-dependent pathway in TNFα-stimulated eosinophils (38Esnault S. Malter J.S. Blood. 2002; 99: 4048-4052Google Scholar). Furthermore the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 is strongly activated by many proinflammatory stimuli and brings about the stabilization of several proinflammatory mRNAs (39Clark A.R. Dean J.L. Saklatvala J. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 37-44Google Scholar, 40Frevel M.A. Bakheet T. Silva A.M. Hissong J.G. Khabar K.S. Williams B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 425-436Google Scholar). Stabilization of COX-2, IL-6, and IL-8 mRNAs is ARE-dependent and is mediated by MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 (MK2), a kinase that is phosphorylated and activated by p38 itself (41Neininger A. Kontoyiannis D. Kotlyarov A. Winzen R. Eckert R. Volk H.D. Holtmann H. Kollias G. Gaestel M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3065-3068Google Scholar, 42Lasa M. Mahtani K.R. Finch A. Brewer G. Saklatvala J.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4969-4980Google Scholar). The p38 pathway stabilizes target mRNAs by preventing their ARE-directed deadenylation (10Dean J.L. Sarsfield S.J. Tsounakou E. Saklatvala J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39470-39476Google Scholar). Beyond this, the mechanistic link between p38 and ARE function is not well understood. We reported previously that the expression of TTP in LPS-treated RAW264.7 mouse macrophage cells was dependent upon MAPK p38, providing the first clear evidence of a connection between this signaling pathway and a known ARE-binding protein (44Mahtani K.R. Brook M. Dean J.L. Sully G. Saklatvala J. Clark A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6461-6469Google Scholar). Here we report that MAPK p38 regulates TTP gene expression at least in part by stabilizing TTP mRNA. This post-transcriptional response is mediated by a distal region of the TTP 3′-UTR that contains three dispersed AUUUA motifs. This region is able to bind to TTP itself and also mediates p38-independent mRNA destabilization by TTP in transfected cells, suggesting a highly complex interplay between TTP and the MAPK p38 pathway in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Materials—Rabbit polyclonal antisera against TTP were described previously (44Mahtani K.R. Brook M. Dean J.L. Sully G. Saklatvala J. Clark A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6461-6469Google Scholar), as were vectors for the generation of β-globin and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase riboprobes and vectors expressing constitutively active MKK6 or dominant negative MK2 (42Lasa M. Mahtani K.R. Finch A. Brewer G. Saklatvala J. Clark A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4265-4274Google Scholar). A rabbit polyclonal antiserum to the N terminus of MKK6 was raised against the synthetic peptide MELGRGAYGVVEKMR. A mouse monoclonal antibody against HuR was from Molecular Probes Inc. Rabbit polyclonal antisera against total and phosphorylated ERK were from Cell Signaling, and a mouse monoclonal antibody against the c-Myc epitope was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. A mouse monoclonal antibody against tubulin was from Sigma. RNA was prepared from LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells, and a TTP cDNA was generated by reverse transcription-PCR using the primers TTPF51 and TTPF31. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and subcloned into pFLAGCMV2 (Sigma) that had been linearized with EcoRI, generating pFLAGCMV-TTP. TTP 3′-UTR fragments were generated by PCR from mouse genomic DNA using primers TTPU51 and TTPU31 (full-length), TTPU51 and TTPU32 (537-bp fragment), and TTPU52 and TTPU31 (178-bp fragment). To generate doxycycline-regulated reporter constructs, PCR products were digested with BglII and subcloned into pTetBBB (45Xu N. Loflin P. Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 558-565Google Scholar) that had been linearized by BglII digestion. To generate in vitro transcription vectors the same PCR products were subcloned into pBluescript KS+ that had been linearized by BamHI digestion. Constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Sequences of oligonucleotides used were as follows: TTPF51, 5′-GCGGAATTCTCTCTGCCATCTACGAGAGCCTC-3′; TTPF31, 5′-GCGGAATTCTCACTCAGAGACAGAGATACGATTGAAGATG-3′; TTPU51, 5′-TATGGATCAGCTAGATCTCAAAGAGAGGGC-3′; TTPU52, 5′-GGAGATCTCCCTTTATTTATGACGACTTTATTTATTG-3′; TTPU31, 5′-GCGAGATCTAATTCCAACCCCCCCCAAAAAATAGACTTG-3′; and TTPU32, 5′-GGAGATCTCCCACTGGTTGGGGGAGAAG-3′. Cell Culture—RAW264.7 cells and HeLa-TO cells (Clontech) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Labtech) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Labtech) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. In the case of HeLa-TO cells, G418 (100 μg/ml; Invitrogen) was also added to the culture medium. Preparation of RAW264.7 Cell Extracts—RAW264.7 cells grown to 80–90% confluence in T150 flasks were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped in 10 ml of the same buffer. Cells were pelleted at 500 × g for 5 min and resuspended in 500 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 3 mm MgCl2, 40 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, protease inhibitors (4 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μm E-64, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μm microcystin)). The lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min to pellet the nuclei. The supernatant (cytoplasmic fraction) was collected, aliquoted, and stored at –20 °C. Bradford protein assays were used to determine the protein concentration of the extracts obtained. Transfection of HeLa-TO Cells—HeLa-TO cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells/well. The following day cells were transfected using Superfect reagent (Qiagen). Carrier DNA (pBluescript; Stratagene) was added to keep the total amount of transfected DNA constant within experiments. 24 h after transfection, doxycycline was added to the cell medium at a final concentration of 500 ng/ml, and cells were harvested at various time points using 100 μl of Ambion lysis buffer. Lysates were passed through shredder columns (Qiagen) and stored frozen at –20 °C. In Vitro Transcription—Template DNAs were linearized by digestion with HindIII and purified using Qiagen DNA extraction kits. Typically 1 μg of DNA template was used/reaction. Transcription reactions were performed in the presence of 1× T7 RNA polymerase buffer, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm each ATP, GTP, and CTP, 12.5 μm UTP, 20 units of recombinant RNase inhibitor (RNasin, Promega), 50 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci mmol–1; Amersham Biosciences), and 20 units of T7 RNA polymerase (Epicenter Technologies). Reactions were stopped by addition of 1 unit of RNase-free DNase I (Promega). Phenol-chloroform extraction was performed, and unincorporated nucleotides were removed using S-200 spin columns (Amersham Biosciences) as specified by the manufacturer. Specific activities of probes were determined by scintillation counting. Ribonuclease Protection Assay—Ribonuclease protection assays were performed using Ambion Direct Protect ribonuclease protection assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Riboprobes were synthesized as described above (under “In Vitro Transcription”). Protected RNA fragments were resolved by electrophoresis on denaturing 5% polyacrylamide gels and visualized and quantified by phosphorimaging (Fuji FLA 2000). Northern Blotting—RNA was purified from RAW264.7 cells using QIAamp RNA blood kits (Qiagen). Typically for each experimental time point between 10 and 20 μg of RNA was denatured using a mix of formamide and formaldehyde prior to loading on denaturing 4% formaldehyde gel. 18 S and 28 S ribosomal RNAs were visualized by staining with SYBR Green II (Molecular Probes) and quantified by phosphorimaging (Fuji FLA 2000). RNAs were capillary-transferred onto a nylon membrane (Hybond XL; Amersham Biosciences) prior to blotting. The probe was a 1-kb full-length murine TTP cDNA fragment labeled using the ReadyToGo DNA labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences) in the presence of 50 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci mmol–1; Amersham Biosciences). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay and Antibody Supershifts— RAW264.7 cell extracts were incubated with the labeled RNA probe in bandshift buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 3 mm MgCl2, 20 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol) for 15 min on ice in the presence of 5 mg ml–1 (final concentration) of heparin sulfate. RNase T1 (Roche Applied Science) was then added to a final concentration of 50 units ml–1, and the reaction mixture was incubated for a further 5 min on ice. RNA-protein complexes were resolved by electrophoresis (150 V for 4 h at 4 °C) on non-denaturing 0.5× Tris-borate-EDTA, 4% acrylamide gel and visualized and quantified by phosphorimaging (Fuji FLA 2000). For antibody supershift experiments, the appropriate antibody was mixed with the cell extract prior to addition of the bandshift buffer, probe, and heparin sulfate, and the reaction mixture was left on ice for 30 min before addition of the RNase T1. Western Blotting—HeLa-TO cells were harvested by lysis in SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and lysates were run on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride. Western blotting was performed by standard methods, using appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Dako) and enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Note that the constitutively active MKK6 was expressed with a hemagglutinin tag; however, the epitope tag appeared to be masked. We therefore used an anti-MKK6 antiserum, which detected both endogenous and exogenous MKK6. LPS Stimulation of RAW264.7 Cells Induces TTP mRNA Expression in a Biphasic and p38-dependent Manner—LPS stimulation of the mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7 caused the induction of TTP gene expression, as detected by Northern blotting, Western blotting, or electrophoretic mobility shift assays using a TNFα 3′-UTR probe (44Mahtani K.R. Brook M. Dean J.L. Sully G. Saklatvala J. Clark A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6461-6469Google Scholar). Expression of TTP protein remained strong 4 h after the stimulus, and the LPS-induced RNA-protein complex was detectable up to 16 h after the stimulus. This contrasted with the highly transient expression of TTP mRNA reported in several cell types, including myeloid cells (13Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1001-1005Google Scholar, 27Ogawa K. Chen F. Kim Y.J. Chen Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30373-30381Google Scholar, 46Suzuki K. Nakajima H. Ikeda K. Maezawa Y. Suto A. Takatori H. Saito Y. Iwamoto I. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1717-1727Google Scholar). We therefore examined the time course of TTP mRNA expression in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. In untreated cells TTP mRNA was almost undetectable (Fig. 1A). Stimulation with LPS led to a strong and rapid induction of TTP mRNA with a first peak of expression observed 1 h after the addition of the stimulus. At 2–3 h, TTP mRNA decreased toward basal level. However, TTP mRNA levels increased again at about 4 h, and a prolonged second phase of TTP mRNA expression was consistently observed. Levels of TTP mRNA during the second phase of expression ranged from 50 to 110% of those observed during the initial peak (data not shown). Like the initial peak (44Mahtani K.R. Brook M. Dean J.L. Sully G. Saklatvala J. Clark A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6461-6469Google Scholar), the accumulation of TTP mRNA in the second phase was significantly inhibited by 1 μm SB203580 (Fig. 1B), suggesting that both phases of gene expression are dependent upon MAPK p38. Induction of TTP mRNA by LPS Is Independent of ERK Activation—The involvement of ERK and JNK pathways in the regulation of TTP expression was not explored previously. As described previously (47Dziarski R. Jin Y.P. Gupta D. J. Infect. Dis. 1996; 174: 777-785Google Scholar), stimulation of RAW264.7 cells with 10 ng/ml LPS resulted in a strong activation of the ERK pathway, which was almost completely inhibited by 1 μm U0126 (Fig. 2A). At this dose the induction of TTP mRNA was not significantly inhibited (Fig. 2B). A low specificity inhibitor of the JNK pathway (48Bennett B.L. Sasaki D.T. Murray B.W. O'Leary E.C. Sakata S.T. Xu W. Leisten J.C. Motiwala A. Pierce S. Satoh Y. Bhagwat S.S. Manning A.M. Anderson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13681-13686Google Scholar, 49Bain J. McLauchlan H. Elliott M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 199-204Google Scholar) did not affect the induction of TTP protein by LPS. 3M. Brook, unpublished observations. The role of the JNK pathway in TTP gene expression was not studied further. These observations suggest a specific role for MAPK p38 in the regulation of TTP mRNA expression. MAPK p38 Controls TTP mRNA Stability—To determine whether p38 regulated TTP expression at the level of mRNA stability, actinomycin D chase experiments were performed (Fig. 3). RAW264.7 cells were stimulated for 1 h with 10 ng/ml LPS, and transcription was then blocked by addition of actinomycin D in the presence of 1 μm SB203580 or vehicle control (0.1% Me2SO). The decay of TTP mRNA was assessed by Northern blotting over the following hour. TTP mRNA was significantly destabilized by 1 μm SB203580, demonstrating that p38 activity is required for the stabilization of the TTP transcript. Under these conditions the degradation of the TTP mRNA body was preceded by a delay of a few min; therefore, half-lives were calculated from the 10-min time point. On this basis the TTP mRNA half-life was 17 min in the absence and 6 min in the presence of 1 μm SB203580. As a negative control, 1 μm U0126 was shown to have no impact on the stability of TTP mRNA (Fig. 3, A, right-hand lanes, and B, right-hand graph). The TTP 3′-UTR Mediates mRNA Stabilization by the MAPK p38 Signaling Pathway—The 3′-UTRs of cyclooxygenase 2, TNFα, IL-6, IL-8, and GM-CSF mediate mRNA stabilization by the MAPK p38 pathway; all contain multiple repeats of the RNA-destabilizing pentameric motif AUUUA that are implicated in p38 responses (42Lasa M. Mahtani K.R. Finch A. Brewer G. Saklatvala J. Clark A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4265-4274Google Scholar, 43Winzen R. Kracht M. Ritter B. Wilhelm A. Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Muller M. Gaestel M. Resch K. Holtmann H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4969-4980Google Scholar, 50Brook M. Sully G. Clark A.R. Saklatvala J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 483: 57-61Google Scholar). The mouse TTP 3′-UTR, containing only three dispersed AUUUA motifs, is not typical of known p38-responsive sequences. To further investigate the regulation of TTP gene expression we used a doxycycline-regulated mRNA stability assay. In this system reporter mRNAs are transcribed under the control of a doxycycline-responsive promoter in HeLa-TO cells, which stably express a doxycycline-repressible transcription factor. Following addition of doxycycline to the tissue culture medium, synthesis of the reporter mRNA is rapidly and specifically switched off, and its decay can subsequently be assessed by ribonuclease protection assay. A cDNA fragment corresponding to the TTP 3′-UTR was inserted downstream of the β-globin coding region in the doxycycline-responsive reporter construct pTetBBB. The resulting construct (pTetBBB-TTP) was transiently transfected into HeLa-TO cells, with or without a vector expressing a constitutively active form of MKK6, the upstream activator of p38. 24 h after transfection, the transcription of the reporter construct was stopped by addition of 500 ng/ml doxycycline, and the cells were harvested at the indicated intervals (Fig. 4). Both chimeric β-globin-TTP and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNAs were quantified by ribonuclease protection assay, the latter as an internal control for gel loading (Fig. 4). As shown in Fig. 5, a β-globin reporter mRNA (without insert) was highly stable, with little or no decay observed during a 4-h time course. Insertion of the TTP 3′-UTR led to a strong destabilization of the β-globin transcript, the chimeric reporter mRNA decaying with a half-life of 48 min (Fig. 4, A and B). In the presence of MKK6, β-globin-TTP mRNA was significantly stabilized, decaying with a half-life of 108 min. This stabilization was reversed if the p38 inhibitor SB202190 was added to cells shortly before the addition of doxycycline. SB202190 did not affect the expression of MKK6 (Fig. 4C).Fig. 5MAPK p38-regulated mRNA decay is conferred by the distal 178 nt of the TTP 3′-UTR.A, schematic of the TTP 3′-UTR showing the location of AUUUA motifs (vertical bars) and the derivation of 537- and 178-nt fragments.

https://openalex.org/W1988656176,"The transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) belongs to the family of nuclear hormone receptors and consists of two isotypes, PPARγ1 and PPARγ2. Our earlier studies have shown that troglitazone (TZD)-mediated activation of PPARγ2 in hepatocytes inhibits growth and attenuates cyclin D1 transcription via modulating CREB levels. Because this process of growth inhibition was also associated with an inhibition of β-catenin expression at a post-translational level, our aim was to elucidate the mechanism involved. β-Catenin is a multifunctional protein, which can regulate cell-cell adhesion by interacting with E-cadherin and other cellular processes via regulating target gene transcription in association with TCF/LEF transcription factors. Two adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)-dependent proteasomal degradation pathways, one involving glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) and the other involving p53-Siah-1, degrade excess β-catenin in normal cells. Our immunofluorescence and Western blot studies indicated a TZD-dependent decrease in cytoplasmic and membrane-bound β-catenin, indicating no increase in its membrane translocation. This was associated with a reduction in E-cadherin expression. PPARγ2 activation inhibited GSK3β kinase activity, and pharmacological inhibition of GSK3β activity was unable to restore β-catenin expression following PPARγ2 activation. Additionally, this β-catenin degradation pathway was operative in cells, with inactivating mutations of both APC and p53. Inhibition of the proteasomal pathway inhibited PPARγ2-mediated degradation of β-catenin, and incubation with TZD increased ubiquitination of β-catenin. We conclude that PPARγ2-mediated suppression of β-catenin levels involves a novel APC/GSK3β/p53-independent ubiquitination-mediated proteasomal degradation pathway.

In the adipose tissue, PPARγ plays a key role in regulating differentiation of pre-adipocytes into mature adipocytes (20Brun R.P. Kim J.B. Hu E. Altiok S. Spiegelman B.M. Curr. Opin.

Diabetes. 1998; 47: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar), which involves cross-talk with the Wnt-signaling pathway. This is evident from the fact that PPARγ-mediated adipocyte differentiation is associated with an extensive down-regulation of β-catenin expression coincident with terminal differentiation (22Moldes M. Zuo Y. Morrison R.F. Silva D. Park B.H. Liu J. Farmer S.R. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 607-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Additionally, activation of the Wnt-signaling pathway in the adipocytes antagonizes adipogenesis, inhibition of which results in spontaneous adipogenesis (23Ross S.E. Hemati N. Longo K.A.

These results indicated that PPARγ pathway functions via antagonism of the β-catenin pathway. β-Catenin is involved in mediating two major functions in a normal cell: (a) in the cell membrane, as part of the E-cadherin/catenin adherens complex and regulating cell-cell adhesion and (b) in the cytoplasm and nucleus as a mediator of the proliferating signal through the Wingless/Wnt pathway (25Peifer M.

Free pools of β-catenin are tightly regulated via two major pathways involving the tumor suppressor protein adenomatous polyposis coli (APC). In one pathway, in the presence of axin and functionally active APC, the serine-threonine kinase glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) phosphorylates β-catenin at critical serine and threonine residues in its N terminus. N-terminal phosphorylated β-catenin is recognized by the F box protein βTrCP and targeted toward ubiquitination-mediated proteasomal degradation (28Hart M. Concordet J.P. Lassot I.

Activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase or Wnt-signaling pathways as well as signals originating from adhesion of cells to extracellular matrices can affect β-catenin stabilization and signaling via regulating GSK3β activity.

Pradeep A. Pestell R.G. Rana B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16927-16938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), which involved modulation of CREB. In those studies PPARγ2-mediated attenuation of hepatocyte growth was also associated with a corresponding inhibition of β-catenin expression as reported in other systems (22Moldes M. Zuo Y.

Because the mechanism involved in this process of β-catenin degradation is still unclear, we designed studies to elucidate the pathway by which activation of PPARγ2 inhibited β-catenin expression. Our results indicated that PPARγ2 inhibited β-catenin expression via an APC-GSK3β- and APC-p53-independent pathway. This novel mechanism of β-catenin regulation, however, involved a ubiquitination-mediated proteasomal degradation pathway. Reagents and Plasmids—DMEM-F12 and DMEM medium, fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin-streptomycin, trypsin, LipofectAMINE, and β-galactosidase assay kits were obtained from Invitrogen; insulin-transferrin-sodium selenite media supplement and dexamethasone were obtained from Sigma; cycloheximide, GSK3 inhibitor, TZD, and lactacystin were from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA), MG-132 was from BIOMOL Research Laboratory (Plymouth Meeting, PA), Tau protein was from Panvera (Madison, WI). The antibodies used were obtained from the following sources: actin from Sigma, PPARγ from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), E-cadherin and total GSK3β from BD Transduction Laboratories (Franklin Lakes, NJ), Phospho-β-catenin (Ser33/37/Thr41) and Phospho-GSK3β (Ser9) from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA), HA.11 from BabCO (Richmond, CA), β-catenin from Zymed Laboratories (San Francisco, CA), APC from Oncogene (San Diego, CA), and 9E10 as described earlier (45Sathyanarayana P.

Cell Culture—Stable AML-12 hepatocyte cell lines ectopically expressing PPARγ2 (Pγ cells) or the empty control retroviral vector (control cells) were generated following standard retroviral transfection and obtained from the laboratory of Dr. Stephen Farmer as described previously (43Sharma C. Pradeep A. Pestell R.G. Rana B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16927-16938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Subconfluent Pγ or control hepatocytes were maintained in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 10% FBS, insulin-transferrin-sodium selenite media supplement, and dexamethasone at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The stable Pγ-wt-β-catenin and Pγ-S37A-β-catenin hepatocytes were generated via stable transfection of the wild type or S37A mutant β-catenin, respectively, in the Pγ hepatocytes (43Sharma C. Pradeep A. Pestell R.G. Rana B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16927-16938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Generation of β-Catenin Constructs—Full-length and deletion constructs of β-catenin were prepared in pcDNA 3.1 Myc/His expression vector between BamH1 and NotI sites. The HA-tagged-wild type β-catenin clone was used as a template for PCR amplification of these constructs. The primers used were as follows: 5′-CGGGATCCGCCATGGCTACTCAAGCTGATTTGATG-3′ and 5′-ATAGTTTAGCGGCCGCCATCTGTGATGGTTCAGCCAA-3′ for N-terminal β-catenin (1–131 amino acids), 5′-CGGGATCCGCCATGCTGAAACATGCAGTTAAC-3′ and 5′-ATAGTTTAGCGGCCGCCAGGTCAGTATCAAACCAGGC-3′ for C-terminal β-catenin (131–781 amino acids) and 5′-CGGGATCCGCCATGGCTACTCAAGCTGATTTGATG-3′ and 5′-ATAGTTTAGCGGCCGCCAGGTCAGTATCAAACCAGGC-3′ for full-length β-catenin (1–781 amino acids). Following subcloning of the β-catenin fragments in the pcDNA 3.1 Myc/His vector, plasmid DNA was purified and sequences were verified by DNA sequencing. Luciferase Reporter Assays—These assays were performed as described previously (43Sharma C. Pradeep A. Pestell R.G. Rana B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16927-16938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells plated at a density 0.15 × 106 cells/well of a 6-well plate were allowed to adhere overnight followed by transient transfection with the respective luciferase vectors along with a β-galactosidase vector using LipofectAMINE. The cells were recovered in serum-containing medium and then treated with either Me2SO or TZD. Luciferase assays were performed using a Microplate Luminometer LB 96V (EG&G Berthhold, Bad Wilbad, Germany), and β-galactosidase assays were performed using a platereader. Each assay was performed in duplicate, and each transfection was repeated at least six to nine times. The results obtained were calculated as the ratio of relative light units to the β-galactosidase values (relative light units/β-galactosidase) and expressed as the percent increase of luciferase activity considering those obtained from the TZD untreated controls as 100%. Western Blot Analyses—For Western analysis, total cellular or nuclear protein was extracted from the cells at different time intervals according to the procedures described previously (50Rana B. Xie Y. Mischoulon D. Bucher N.L. Farmer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18123-18132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of total cellular or nuclear protein were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes, and blotted with the respective antibodies. In the experiments with inhibitors, cells were pretreated with the respective inhibitors prior to the addition of TZD. In the cycloheximide experiments, TZD treatment was performed for 48 h before incubation of the cells with cycloheximide. The Triton-soluble and Triton-insoluble cell extracts were prepared according to the protocol described previously (51Hugh T.J. Dillon S.A. O'Dowd G. Getty B. Pignatelli M. Poston G.J. Kinsella A.R. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 82: 504-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Briefly, Triton-soluble fraction was isolated by extracting cells in lysis Buffer A containing 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 140 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, and proteinase inhibitors. The supernatant obtained following centrifugation of these extracts was termed Triton-soluble extracts. The pellet obtained following extraction with Buffer A was further extracted in lysis Buffer B containing 1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, and proteinase inhibitors. The supernatant obtained following extraction with Buffer B was termed “Triton-insoluble extracts.” Immunoprecipitation Studies—For immunoprecipitation studies cell extracts were prepared in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, 2 mm EGTA, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm vanadate, and 0.04 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors. Equal amounts of cell extracts were incubated with specific antibodies, which were pre-adsorbed previously on protein A-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Following a 2-h incubation at 4 °C the antibody-protein complex was purified by centrifugation of the beads and washing twice with ice-cold lysis buffer and once with 1× PBS. Finally SDS sample buffer was added to the pellets, and the denatured protein was resolved on SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. To determine any interaction between PPARγ2 and β-catenin, an in vivo cross-linking of the proteins using dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate) (Pierce, IL) was performed prior to immunoprecipitation as described earlier (52Xiao J.H. Ghosn C. Hinchman C. Forbes C. Wang J. Snider N. Cordrey A. Zhao Y. Chandraratna R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29954-29962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Pulse-chase Analysis—Subconfluent populations of Pγ hepatocytes grown in growth medium were first treated in the absence or presence of TZD for ∼48 h. At the end of this incubation the cells were washed in methionine-, cysteine-, and glutamine-free DMEM (Invitrogen), starved for 1 h in the same medium and pulse-labeled using 500 μCi of Tran35S-label (ICN) for 1 h. The cells were then washed twice with the amino acid-free medium and then chased in complete growth medium for different lengths of time in the presence or absence of TZD. At the end of the chase, total protein was harvested and 35S-labeled β-catenin was immunoprecipitated. The immunoprecipitates were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred on PVDF membranes, and subjected to autoradiography. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA extracted from cells grown in the presence or absence of TZD for different lengths of time were subjected to Northern blot analysis, as described (53Rana B. Mischoulon D. Xie Y. Bucher N.L. Farmer S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5858-5869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using a β-catenin cDNA as probe or an 18 S ribosomal RNA DECAprobe (Ambion, TX) as control. Immunofluorescence Analysis—Immunofluorescence assays were carried out according to a modification of the protocol described (54Singh U.S. Erickson J.W. Cerione R.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15863-15871Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated on double well chamber slides (0.125 × 106 cells per well) and treated with TZD (10 μm) for the indicated periods of time. They were fixed in 4% methanol-free formaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4, at 4 °C for 25 min and permeabilized in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100. This was followed by two washes in PBS and incubation with a monoclonal antibody against β-catenin (Zymed Laboratories Inc., CA) in 1% bovine serum albumin-TBST for 2 h at room temperature. Following five washes with TBST, cells were incubated with rhodamine-conjugated anti-murine secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at room temperature, washed, and mounted in Antifade (Molecular Probes, OR). Images were acquired using an OlymPix 2000 RGB camera and OlymPix 2000 software (1280 × 1024 pixels/image). In Vitro Kinase Assay—The in vitro kinase assays were performed according to the protocol described elsewhere (55Barthwal M.K. Sathyanarayana P. Kundu C.N. Rana B. Pradeep A. Sharma C. Woodgett J.R. Rana A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3897-3902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of total protein lysate, extracted from cells treated as indicated, were immunoprecipitated by an antibody against GSK3β pre-adsorbed to protein A-Sepharose beads. This was followed by washing of the protein A-Sepharose beads twice with lysis buffer and twice with assay buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% Triton X-100). Kinase assays were carried out by incubating the sample beads in 40 μl of kinase buffer (containing 2 mm cold ATP and 10 mm MgCl2) in presence of Tau recombinant protein (as GSK3β substrate) and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, for 30 min at 30 °C. Samples were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. 32P incorporation into Tau was quantified using a PhosphorImager (Storm Scanner model 860 and ImageQuaNT 5.2 software, Amersham Biosciences). PPARγ2 Inhibited Expression of Endogenous and Ectopic β-Catenin in AML-12 Hepatocytes—To determine the effect of PPARγ2on β-catenin expression, we utilized the AML-12 hepatocytes (56Wu J.C. Merlino G. Fausto N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Luciferase assays designed with a PPARγ-responsive luciferase reporter (tk-PPREx3-luc) indicated a significant activation of the reporter activity following transient overexpression of PPARγ2 (Fig. 1A, lane 3). This activity was further enhanced following activation of PPARγ2 with an exogenous ligand TZD (lane 4). These results indicated that PPARγ-mediated pathway was functional in these hepatocytes. To study the effect of PPARγ2 on β-catenin expression in hepatocytes, β-catenin levels were estimated following transient expression and activation of PPARγ2 in the AML-12 hepatocytes. Results from these studies indicated a dramatic decrease in the expression of β-catenin in AML-12 cells (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 4), coincident with PPARγ expression and activation. To confirm the effect of PPARγ2 in attenuating β-catenin expression, we also utilized the control, Pγ, and Pγ-wt-β-catenin hepatocytes, stably overexpressing either an empt"

The West Nile domain III structure is a β-barrel structure formed from seven anti-parallel β-strands in two β-sheets. One anti-parallel β-sheet consists of β-strands β1 (Phe299-Asp307), β2 (Val313-Tyr319), β4 (Arg354-Leu355), and β5 (Lys370-Glu376) arranged so that β2 is flanked on either side by β1 and β5. The short β4 flanks the end of the remaining side of β5. The remaining anti-parallel β-sheet is formed from strands β3 (Ile340-Val343), β6 (Gly380-Arg388), and β7 (Gln391-Lys399) arranged with β6 at the center. Residues implicated in antigenic differences between different West Nile virus strains (and other flaviviruses) and neutralization are located on the outer surface of the protein. Characterization of the binding of monoclonal antibodies to WN-rED3 mutants, which were identified through neutralization escape experiments, indicate that antibody neutralization directly correlates with binding affinities.

(family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus) was responsible for the largest outbreak of arthropod-borne encephalitis recorded in the Western hemisphere. In that year, 4156 human infections and 284 deaths were reported in the United States (1Zeller H.G. Schuffenecker I. Eur. J. Clin. Microbiol. Infect. Dis. 2004; 23: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). In 2003, the WNV epidemic continued with large numbers of human and animal disease across North America, and it was detected for the first time in Mexico and Central America (e.g. Refs. 2Estrada-Franco J.G.

The objective of this study was to solve the solution structure for the putative envelope (E) protein, the receptor-binding domain of WNV with the long term goal of using these findings for the development of structure-based vaccines or antiviral agents. Currently, there are no approved vaccines for WNV or therapeutic treatments for West Nile encephalitis. The flaviviruses are small, enveloped, positive-sense RNA viruses that are transmitted primarily by either mosquitoes or ticks. The translation of the single open reading frame within the viral genome, followed by co- and posttranslational cleavage, results in ten viral proteins, three structural proteins (core, membrane, and E) and seven non-structural proteins. The non-structural proteins are involved in viral replication and pathogenesis, whereas the three structural proteins are assembled into the mature virus particle. The E protein is the major surface protein of the flavivirus virions. The E protein is also the primary immunogen and plays a central role in virus attachment and entry to cells via membrane fusion. The x-ray crystallographic structures of the E protein ectodomains of both the tick-borne central European encephalitis virus (5Rey F.A. Heinz F.X. Mandl C. Kunz C. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar) and the mosquito-borne dengue-2 virus (6Modis Y. Ogata S. Clements D. Harrison S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Both proteins contain three distinct structural domains (domains I, II, and III) that correspond to previously characterized antigenic domains (7Mandl C.W. Guirakhoo F. Holzmann H. Heinz F.X. Kunz C. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 564-571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Domain III (D3) of the E protein was initially proposed as the likely receptor-binding domain of the flaviviruses because of its structural characteristics. These include an IgC-like fold and a four-amino-acid loop that contains an RGD integrin-binding motif in several of the mosquito-borne flaviviruses (5Rey F.A. Heinz F.X. Mandl C. Kunz C. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar). More recent studies have shown that D3 is directly associated with binding of dengue-2 virus (DEN2V) (8Hung J.-J. Hsieh M.-T. Young M.-J. Kao C.-L. King C.-C. Chang W. J.

Science. 2003; 302: 248Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) of the mosquito-borne WNV, DEN2V, and yellow fever virus have found that the E protein is arranged in dimeric form on the virus surface. Located at the 5- and 3-fold axes of symmetry, D3 projects slightly above the virion surface, allowing access to potential receptor molecules and antibodies. The 5-fold axis is arranged such that there is a “pore” between the D3 molecules. When the flaviviruses bind to a target cell, they are internalized into an endosome that is acidified. The drop in pH causes a dramatic conformational shift in the E protein that exposes the viral fusion peptide (12Modis Y. Ogata S. Clements D. Harrison S.C. Nature. 2004; 427: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar), allows the endosomal and viral membranes to fuse, and provides for the release of the viral RNA into the cell cytoplasm. The role of the flavivirus E-D3 in virus-receptor binding makes it an attractive target for the development of vaccines, antiviral agents, and/or diagnostic antigens. The solution structure of the WN-rED3 described here, along with that of the closely related Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) (13Wu K.-P. Wu C.-W. Tsao Y.-P. Kuo T.-W. Lou Y.-C. Lin C.-W. Wu S.-C. Cheng J.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46007-46013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), provides fundamental knowledge for the development of structure-based vaccines and antiviral agents to protect against and treat diseases caused by WNV and related flaviviruses. Protein Expression and Purification—Uniformly 13C,15N-labeled recombinant WN-rED3 from neuroinvasive lineage 1 West Nile virus strain 385-99 was overexpressed as a maltose-binding protein fusion using the pMAL-c2X vector as described previously (9Beasley D.W.C. Barrett A.D.T. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 13097-13100Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), and the 115-residue WN-rED3 was purified using size-exclusion chromatography. Residues Leu6-Ser112 of the 115-residue protein align with residues Leu297-Ser403 of the 385-99 envelope protein. Residues 1-5 and 113-115 were included in this construct to increase protein solubility. In addition, the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to derive E-D3 fusion proteins encoding mutations at K307R or T330I. These mutations had been shown previously to affect neutralization of WNV by monoclonal antibodies (9Beasley D.W.C. Barrett A.D.T. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 13097-13100Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Monoclonal Antibody Neutralization and Binding Assays—Neutralization assays with four WNV-specific neutralizing antibodies, designated 7H2, 5H10, 5C5, and 3A3 (Bioreliance), against WNV NY99 and variants monoclonal antibody (MAb)R-5H10 and -5C5 were performed with MAbs at 10 nm concentration as described elsewhere (9Beasley D.W.C. Barrett A.D.T. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 13097-13100Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The binding characteristics of the four MAbs to recombinant NY99 E-D3 and the K307R and T330I mutant E-D3 MBP fusion proteins were investigated using a titration enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay similar to that described by Lin and Wu (15Lin C.W. Wu S.C. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 2600-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Briefly, wells of 96-well enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates were coated overnight at 4 °C with 60 ng/well purified fusion protein (equivalent to ∼11 ng of E-D3). After blocking in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Tween 20 (phosphate-buffered saline-Tween) and 3% bovine serum albumin, serial dilutions of MAbs from 100 to 0.003 nm were dispensed into replicate wells and incubated at room temperature (25 °C) for 60 min. After washing three times with phosphate-buffered saline-Tween, horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse Ig antiserum was added to each well, and the plates were incubated again, prior to washing and addition of TMB substrate. Color development was for 15 min, after which the reactions were stopped with 3 m HCl, and absorbance values were read at 450 nm. Binding curves and Kd values were determined using Sigmaplot (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). NMR Spectroscopy and Generation of Restraints—The NMR sample contained 0.7 mm protein in 50 mm K2HPO4 (pH 6.8), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaN3, and 0.1 mm EDTA in 90% H2O, 10% D2O. All NMR experiments were acquired on Varian UnityPlus 600 or 750 MHz spectrometers at 25 °C. Sequence-specific chemical shifts for the backbone atoms were obtained from three-dimensional HNCA, HNCACB (16Sattler M. Schleucher J. Griesinger C. Prog. NMR Spectrosc. 1999; 34: 93-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1399) Google Scholar), and HNCO (17Ikura M. Bax A. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 9020-9022Crossref Scopus (169) Google Scholar) experiments. The backbone assignments were verified through sequential NH-NH and NH-Hα nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs) in a 150-ms mixing time 15N-edited three-dimensional nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy-heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectrum (18Marion D. Kay L.E. Sparks S.W. Torchia D.A. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 1515-1517Crossref Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Side chain chemical shifts were obtained from three-dimensional H(CCO)NH-total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY) (19Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 249-363Google Scholar), CC(CO)NH-TOCSY, TOCSY-HSQC{1H,15N}, and HCCHTOCSY (20Vuister G.W. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1992; 98: 428-435Google Scholar) experiments. The CC(CO)NH-TOCSY experiment also aided in the assignments of the C-α and C-β carbons in cases of degeneracy in the HNCACB experiment and in the assignments of the Asn and Gln side chain amide groups. Aromatic chemical shifts were assigned based on a CT-1H,13C-HSQC spectrum, NOE data, and a HCCHTOCSY spectrum with the carbon frequency centered on the aromatic carbons. Spectra were processed using VNMR v6.1b (Varian, Inc.) or Felix98 (MSI, Inc.) software. The program SANE (21Duggan B.M. Legge G.B. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 19: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) was used to facilitate the assignment of some NOE cross-peaks and for the generation of restraints. Within the SANE program, chemical shift, distance cutoff, and secondary structure filters were used. The NOE restraints were separated into three bins based on their volumes, and the upper distance limits of the restraints were set to 2.8, 3.8, and 5.5 Å. The 1239 NOE-based restraints (see Table I) consist of 299 intra-residue, 433 sequential, 104 medium range, and 403 long range NOE restraints.Table ISummary of structure constraints and statisticsTotal restraints1859NOE restraints1239Intra-residue299Sequential433Medium range104Long range403TALOS ϕ/ψ dihedral angles192Hydrogen bonds41Chiral/ω angle restraints387Structural statisticsNOE violations > 0.3 Å6 ± 2Dihedral angle violationsaA 20°-limit for restraint errors was used due to the small error bars used on the TALOS derived distance restraints, which were as small as ± 3° and were less than ± 20° for 75% of the dihedral restraints. > 20°8 ± 1r.m.s.d. from ideal geometryBond lengths (Å)0.013Bond angles (°)2.2Restraint error r.m.s.d.Distance restraints (Å)0.0156 ± 0.0017Angular restraints (°)1.60 ± 0.06Atomic r.m.s.d. for residues 13-108Backbone atoms (Å)bCalculated for residues 13-108.0.65 ± 0.12All heavy atoms (Å)bCalculated for residues 13-108.0.98 ± 0.17Ramachandran statisticsMost favored regions (%)76.8Additionally allowed (%)21.2Generously allowed (%)0.7Disallowed (%)1.2a A 20°-limit for restraint errors was used due to the small error bars used on the TALOS derived distance restraints, which were as small as ± 3° and were less than ± 20° for 75% of the dihedral restraints.b Calculated for residues 13-108. Open table in a new tab The program TALOS (22Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar) was used to derive ϕ/ψ angle restraints. After two rounds of preliminary molecular dynamics calculations, those dihedral angles inconsistent with the NOE data were removed or changed to the ϕ/ψ angle exhibited by fewer of the proteins in the TALOS data bank. Additionally, ω dihedral angle and chiral angle restraints were also used. Restrained Molecular Dynamics Calculations—One hundred random structures were generated by annealing the protein at 1500 K, obtaining the coordinates every 5 ps, and minimizing the structures obtained. During the annealing process, chiral restraints were applied to maintain the correct chirality for all amino acids. Each of these structures was then subjected to 15 ps of restrained molecular dynamics with the following protocol. During the first 5 ps, the restraints were increased linearly from 0 to 20 kcal/mol Å2, the non-bonded interactions (electrostatic, van der Waals, and hydrogen bonding terms) were set to 10% of their normal values, and the temperature was increased from 100 to 700 K. During the next 5 ps the non-bonded interactions were increased linearly from 10 to 100%, while the temperature remained set to 700 K. During the final 5 ps, the temperature was decreased linearly from 700 to 100 K while the full force constants of the restraints and the non-bonded interactions were applied. Each of the structures obtained was subsequently subjected to 2000 steps of energy minimization. Fifteen structures with low restraint penalties were then chosen for the structural ensemble. All calculations were done with the SANDER module within AMBER6 (23Case D.A. Pearlman D.A. Caldwell J.W. Cheatham III, T.E. Rose W.S. Simmerling C.L. Darden K.M. Merz R.V. Stanton A.L. Cheng J.J.

Atomic coordinates for fifteen structures have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank (PDB ID 1S6N) and the chemical shifts have been deposited at the BioMagResBank under accession code 6046 (25Volk D.E.

The final structures had 6 ± 2 distance restraint violations over 0.3 Å, and 8 ± 1 dihedral angle violations over 20° (Table I). The dihedral angle restraints used were very restrictive in angular space; the tightest restraint was ±3°, and 75% of the dihedral angles were restricted to less than ±20° from the target angle. Therefore, a violation cutoff of 20° is reasonable for the restraints used. The r.m.s.d. restraint error was 0.0156 ± 0.0017 Å, and the r.m.s.d. angle restraint error was 1.60 ± 0.06°. The structural ensemble has an average pairwise atomic r.m.s.d. of 0.65 ± 0.12 Å for the backbone atoms and 0.98 ± 0.17 Å for all heavy atoms for residues 13-108 of the protein. The program PROCHECK (14Laskowski R.A. Rullman J.A.C. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (4474) Google Scholar) was used to analyze the quality of the ensemble of structures. Ramachandran analysis of the non-glycine, non-proline residues indicated 98% of the residues are in the two most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot. Specifically, 76.8% are in the most favored region, 21.2% are in the additionally allowed region, 0.7% are in the generously allowed region, and 1.2% are in the disallowed region. Ser400 is in the disallowed region in two of the fifteen structures, whereas Lys307, which is near the disulfide bond between Cys305 and Cys336, is in the disallowed region in every structure. Interaction of WNV-specific Neutralizing Monoclonal Antibodies with E-D3—Previously we have described the preliminary determination of in vitro neutralization characteristics of four WNV-specific MAbs that bound to WNV E-D3 (9Beasley D.W.C. Barrett A.D.T. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 13097-13100Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). To better characterize the interactions of these MAbs with E-D3 and the relationship between MAb binding and virus neutralization we titrated the specific binding of each MAb with the WN-rED3 MPB fusion protein in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Based on these titrations (Fig. 2A), the calculated Kd values for each MAb were comparable, ranging between 0.1 and 0.2 nm. Interestingly, the maximal binding of MAb 7H2 was 20% higher than those of the other MAbs (Fig. 2), which was consistent with the greater neutralizing activity of this Mab against WNV NY99 (Fig. 2, Table II).Table IINeutralization of wild-type NY99 or neutralization escape variants by anti-domain III monoclonal antibodies at 10 nm concentrationVirus strainNeutralization indexaNeutralization index is log10 reduction in virus titer in the presence of MAb compared with a “No MAb” control. for MAb7H25H105C53A3NY993.72.82.62.7MAbR-5C5 (K307R)2.70.30.00.1MAbR-5H10 (T330I)2.60.82.30.6a Neutralization index is log10 reduction in virus titer in the presence of MAb compared with a “No MAb” control. Open table in a new tab Neutralization escape variants selected with MAbs 5C5 (designated MabR-5C5) or 5H10 (MAbR-5H10) encoded mutations at K307R or T330I, respectively (9Beasley D.W.C. Barrett A.D.T. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 13097-13100Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). When mapped onto the DEN2 E protein dimer structure, the WNV E-D3 NMR structure clearly shows that these residues are surface-exposed and located spatially near to each other on the upper outside face of E-D3 (Fig. 3B). To better quantify the effects of these mutations on the epitopes recognized by the anti-WNV MAbs, the ability of all four MAbs to bind to recombinant E-D3 proteins that encoded the K307R or T330I mutations was assessed. Despite the close proximity of residues 307 and 330 on the E-D3 surface (Fig. 1), significantly different mutation effects were observed in the binding of the four MAbs (Fig. 2B). The maximal binding of MAb 7H2 (at 100 nm concentration) to either mutant protein was ∼2-fold lower than its binding to the wild-type WNV NY99 ED3. In contrast, either mutation resulted in ∼5-10-fold reductions in the binding of either the 5H10 or 3A3 MAbs to levels that were only slightly higher than the background. The binding of MAb 5C5 was affected differently by the two mutations. At concentrations up to and including 100 nm, binding to the K307R protein was not detected, whereas only an ∼2-fold reduction in peak binding occurred with the T330I mutant. In general, the binding data were consistent with neutralization data obtained for the four MAbs against the MAbR-5C5 and -5H10 variant strains (Table II). The data also confirmed our previous hypothesis that distinctly different binding interactions can occur at this surface despite the relatively small E-D3 surface area available for antibody binding. NMR studies of the binding of a JEV-specific neutralizing MAb binding to JEV E-D3 have indicated that multiple interactions occur with residues across the entire upper surface of E-D3 (13Wu K.-P. Wu C.-W. Tsao Y.-P. Kuo T.-W. Lou Y.-C. Lin C.-W. Wu S.-C. Cheng J.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46007-46013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, escape from neutralization by that JEV-specific MAb was primarily associated with mutations at the outside edge of E-D3 in the β2-β3 loop (15Lin C.W. Wu S.C. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 2600-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This region is homologous to the location of the antigenically significant mutations that we have reported in WNV (9Beasley D.W.C. Barrett A.D.T. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 13097-13100Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In JEV-rED3, the positively charged K307 of WN-rED3 is replaced by a negatively charged glutamic acid, and residues T330 and T332 are replaced by serines. This suggests that the upper edge of domain III formed by the loop linking β2 and β3 represents an important antigenic determinant for both WNV and JEV. The fact that none of these mutations have been associated with viability or virulence changes in either JEV (15Lin C.W. Wu S.C. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 2600-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) or WNV (9Beasley D.W.C. Barrett A.D.T. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 13097-13100Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) suggests that other surface-exposed residues in E-D3 may represent critical receptor binding elements and determinants of tropism and virulence for these viruses. The solution structure of domain III from the envelope protein of the West Nile virus represents the first high-resolution structure from the immunogenically important E protein of this medically important virus. The structure is similar to the domain III structures of both the DEN2V and the JEV but has significant differences that most likely contribute to the antigenic and tropism differences between these mosquito-borne flaviviruses. A number of E-D3 residues in WNV lineage 1 strains that are different from those in some WNV lineage 2 strains, JEV, and/or DEN2V strains are located near the top of the β-barrel (Fig. 1B). Among them are Lys307 and Thr330, which affect antibody binding and escape from neutralization (see below). In addition, residues Thr332, Tyr329, Leu312, and Ala369 are also solvent-exposed, may play a role in the determination of antigenic specificities, and serve as additional starting points for mutation studies. Comparison with Domains III of the Dengue-2 and Japanese Encephalitis Virus E Proteins—Although the WN-rED3 structure is similar to domain III from both DEN2V (6Modis Y. Ogata S. Clements D. Harrison S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6986-6991Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar) and the JEV (JEV-rED3) (13Wu K.-P. Wu C.-W. Tsao Y.-P. Kuo T.-W. Lou Y.-C. Lin C.-W. Wu S.-C. Cheng J.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46007-46013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) E proteins, there are significant differences. When aligning the backbone atoms of the six major β-strands present in domain III of all three proteins, WN-rED3 has an atomic r.m.s.d. of 2.5 and 2.8 Å versus the domain III of DEN2V and JEV, respectively. Small differences do exist between the sheet structures of the three proteins (Table III). The first two β-strands of WN-rED3, spanning Phe309-Asp317 and Val323-Tyr329, are identical in length to strands β1 and β2 in the both the JE-rED3 and the DEN2 domain III structures. Strand β3 of WN-rED3, spanning Ile340-Val343, is one residue shorter on the C-terminal end compared with the analogous strands β3 (Ile339-Ale343) in JE-rED3 and β4 (Phe337-Met340) in DEN2V. The two-residue strand β4 of WN-rED3 (Arg354-Leu355) coincides with the last two residues of the DEN2 twisted β-strand β5 (Val347-Leu351). The β5 strand of DEN2V appears to be two sequential β-strands that are three and two residues long, twisted ∼90° relative to each other. An analogous β-strand is not present in the JE-rED3 structure. Strand β5 (Lys370-Glu376) of WN-rED3 is one residue longer than β4 of JE-rED3 (Lys369-Met374) on the C-terminal end, and it is one residue longer than β7 (Val365-Glu370) of DEN2 on the N-terminal end. β-Strands β6 (Gly380-Arg388) and β7 (Gln391-Lys399) of WN-rED3 are each two residues longer than the analogous strands, β8 (Gly374-Ile380) and β9 (Leu387-Lys393), in DEN2V. The analogous strands β5 (Ser381-Gly386) and β6 (Gln391-Trp396) in JE-rED3 are each one residue shorter than those of the DEN2V and three residues shorter than those of WN-rED3. Two short interacting β-strands that are present in DEN2V domain III, β3 (Cys333-Lys334) and β6 (Ile357-Val358), are not observed in either the WN-rED3 or JE-rED3 solution structures. The two β-strands not present in the JEV and WNV domain III solution structures are near the top of the DEN2V β-barrel. As previously suggested (13Wu K.-P. Wu C.-W. Tsao Y.-P. Kuo T.-W. Lou Y.-C. Lin C.-W. Wu S.-C. Cheng J.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46007-46013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), the absence of these two strands may be because of the lack of dimeric head-to-tail interactions between domain III and domains I and II, which are not part of the present protein studied or the JEV domain III solution structure.Table IIIComparison of β-strands in domain III of the envelope proteins from the dengue-2, West Nile, and Japanese encephalitis virusesDEN2VWNVJEVβ-strandResiduesβ-strandResiduesβ-strandResiduesβ1Phe306-Glu314β1Phe309-Asp317β1Phe308-Asp316β2Ile320-Tyr326β2Val323-Tyr329β2Val322-Tyr328β3Cys333-Lys339β4Phe337-Mel340β3Ile340-Val348β3Ile339-Ala343β5Val397-Leu351β4Arg359-Leu355β6Ile357-Val359β7Val365-Glu370β5Lys370-Glu376β4Lys369-Met374β8Gly374-Ile380β6Gly380-Arg388β5Ser381-Gly386β9Leu387-Lys393β7Gln391-Lys399β6Gln391-Trp396 Open table in a new tab Although the secondary structures and global folds of the West Nile, Japanese encephalitis, and dengue-2 virus domain III proteins are similar, the protein surfaces presented as antigens or targets for potential therapeutic drugs are significantly different (Fig. 4). Domain III forms a pentameric pore in the virion, and the residues near this interface are shown in Fig. 4, at the top. For WN-rED3, residues Thr332, Ala365, Thr366, and Asn368 form a small pocket at this site. The width of the pocket between residues Thr332 and Thr366 is 6.85 Å. A similar but wider pocket is present in the JEV-rED3 structure. In the JEV-rED3 structure, the pocket is formed by residues Ser330, Asp331, Pro333, Ser363, Ser364, and Asn366. The width across the pocket between residues Ser330and Ser364, which are analogous to Thr332 and Thr366 in WN-rED3, is 8.95 Å. Thus, in the West Nile virus, this pocket is about 2 Å narrower. In addition, the pocket in the JEV-rED3 structure involves more residues, including the negatively charged Asp331. In the West Nile structure, the side chain of the analogous residue Asp333 is situated away from this pocket. The electrostatic charges are also significantly different near these pockets and on the face of the proteins. The electrostatic surface formed in WN-rED3 by residue Lys307 sandwiched between two negatively charged residues, Asp333 and Glu390 (Fig. 4A, top right), is very different from that formed by JEV-rED3 (Fig. 4B, top right). In the JEV-rED3 structure, the negatively charged residue Asp388 is situated between two positive residues, Lys306 and Lys389. On the central face of the structures shown in Fig. 4, Asp326 and Lys370 of WN-rED3 align well with residues Glu324 and Lys368 of JE-rED3. However, in the WN-rED3 structure an additional positively charged residue, Lys310, is just above and to the right of these residues, whereas in the JEV-rED3 structure an additional positively charged residue, Lys311, is directly under the aforementioned residues. These subtle structural changes are responsible for protein surfaces that interact differently with ligands such as antibodies, potential drugs, and possibly cell surface proteins. As an example, the rings of positive lysines in each of the proteins, such as Lys307, Lys310, Lys370, and Lys337 in WN-rED3, serve as attractive targets for nucleic acid-based aptamer strategies. Thus, the WN-rED3 structure provides direction for future drug development and mutation effect studies and provides insight in the analysis of current mutation studies. Antibody neutralization experiments indicate mutations K307R and T330I have differential effects with respect to the antibody used in the experiment. At 100 nm concentration, which is 50-100-fold greater than the Kd for binding of each MAb to wild-type NY99 rE-D3, an ∼2-fold reduction in binding was observed for MAb 7H2 to either the K307R or T330I mutants, relative to the NY99 protein. MAbs 5H10 and 3A3 exhibited a 5-10-fold reduction in binding to either of the mutants. However, MAb 5C5 binding was decreased >10-fold to the K307R mutant but was decreased only 2-fold to the T330I mutant. These differences in binding correlated with differences in the ability of these MAbs to neutralize WNV strains encoding those mutations and confirmed that, despite the relatively small size of E-D3, distinctly different binding interactions can occur at its upper surface. In addition, the clustering of antigenically significant mutations at the upper outside edge of E-D3 in both WNV and JEV suggest that other surface-exposed residues may represent critical receptor binding determinants. Accordingly, these solvent-exposed residues represent potentially important targets for rational design of vaccines or therapeutic agents to control WNV disease. This high-resolution structure of the WN-rED3 provides significant insight toward understanding the immunological differences between a mosquito-borne flavivirus, in general, and members of the JEV serocomplex, more specifically. These subtle structural differences, particularly in areas that constitute virus-specific neutralizing epitopes, may provide the basis for the lack of significant immunological cross-protection between viruses such as WNV, JEV, and DEN2V, despite the antigenic cross-reactivity that exists between them. The structural differences and variability of surface exposed residues of the putative receptor-binding domain III may also contribute to differences in host cell tropism and to subsequent disease pathogenesis of a particular flavivirus (e.g. neurotropic WNV and JEV versus DEN). The identification of conserved and variable structures and surface residues provides potential targets for the development of structure-based antiviral agents that are targeted against WNV infection, or potentially, infection by all flaviviruses.

To determine whether αvβ3 regulates transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) 1-induced responses, we investigated the interaction between αvβ3 and TGFβ type II receptor (TGFβIIR) in primary human lung fibroblasts. We report that TGFβ1 up-regulates cell surface and mRNA expression of αvβ3 in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Co-immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy showed that TGFβRII associates and clusters with αvβ3, following TGFβ1 exposure. This association was not observed with αvβ5 or α5β1. We also used a novel molecular proximity assay, bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET), to quantify this dynamic interaction in living cells. TGFβ1 stimulation resulted in a BRET signal within 5 min, whereas tenascin, which binds αvβ3, did not induce a substantial BRET signal. Co-exposure to tenascin and TGFβ1 produced no further increases in BRET than TGFβ1 alone. Cyclin D1 was rapidly induced in cells co-exposed to TGFβ1 and tenascin, and as a consequence proliferation induced by TGFβ1 was dramatically enhanced in cells co-exposed to tenascin or vitronectin. Cholesterol depletion inhibited the interaction between TGFβRII and αvβ3 and abrogated the proliferative effect. The cyclic RGD peptide, GpenGRGDSPCA, which blocks αvβ3, also abolished the synergistic proliferative effect seen. These results indicate a new interaction partner for the αvβ3 integrin, the TGFβIIR, in which TGFβ1-induced responses are potentiated in the presence αvβ3 ligands. Our data provide a novel mechanism by which TGFβ1 may contribute to abnormal wound healing and tissue fibrosis.

Our data provide a novel mechanism by which TGFβ1 may contribute to abnormal wound healing and tissue fibrosis. Acute inflammation is a beneficial response of tissue injury and generally results in repair and restoration of normal tissue architecture and function. These processes are spatially and temporally controlled by local signals generated by a plethora of growth factors as well as the immediate extracellular micro-environment. However, chronic airway inflammation and associated aberrant repair, which often occurs in asthma and pulmonary fibrosis can lead to abnormal airway structure and function.

Integrins are membrane-spanning glycoproteins consisting of a heterodimer of non-covalently linked α and β subunits (4Hynes R.O.

Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 697-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (2485) Google Scholar). Considerable attention has focused on the αvβ3 integrin, because it appears to play a major role in several processes relevant to remodeling, such as binding and activation of matrix metalloproteinases (7Meerovitch K.

We have shown that vitronectin (VN) and its receptors, including αvβ3, can dramatically modulate the phenotype and function of human lung fibroblasts via integrin-specific intracellular signaling pathways (11Scaffidi A.K.

Whereas it is clear that interactions between integrins and the ECM play fundamental roles in the response of a tissue to injury, it is apparent that expression of integrins is dynamically regulated throughout the various stages of repair by a variety of cytokines and growth factors. TGFβ1 is produced by a variety of cells and controls multiple processes involved in wound repair (15Riedy M.C. Brown M.C. Molloy C.J. Turner C.E. Exp.

Its role in inducing proliferation is unclear, although it is thought to be a relatively weak mitogen for fibroblasts (20McAnulty R.J. Hernandez-Rodriguez N.A. Mutsaers S.E. Coker R.K. Laurent G.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 639-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). TGFβ1 elicits its biological effects by interacting with the constitutively active serine/threonine kinase TGFβ type II receptor (TGFβIIR), which recruits and activates TGFβ type I receptor (21Weis-Garcia F. Massague J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 276-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 22Chen R.H. Derynck R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22868-22874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TGFβ1 has been shown to modulate the expression of integrins, although these effects are particularly dependent on cell type (23Sheppard D. Cohen D.S. Wang A. Busk M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17409-17414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Kumar N.M. Sigurdson S.L. Sheppard D. Lwebuga-Mukasa J.S. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 221: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Whether TGFβ1 effects αvβ3 transcription and synthesis in normal human lung fibroblasts is yet to be determined. Several reports indicate that cell adhesion to the ECM influences growth factor-induced responses, which suggests the existence of coordinated mechanisms between integrin and growth factors in the control of cellular functions. Of these studies, αvβ3 has been shown to associate with receptor tyrosine kinases such as platelet-derived growth factor β receptor (25Schneller M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5600-5607Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) and insulin-like growth factor receptor, and its cognate ligand, VN, enhanced the mitogenic responses of platelet-derived growth factor and insulin-like growth factor (26Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1994; 266: 1576-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). However, the potential for integrins to interact with non-receptor tyrosine kinases such as those for TGFβ has not been investigated. Although there is evidence to suggest that integrin-mediated signaling may converge with TGFβ signaling pathways (27Bhowmick N.A. Zent R. Ghiassi M. McDonnell M. Moses H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46707-46713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 28Thannickal V.J. Lee D.Y. White E.S. Cui Z. Larios J.M. Chacon R. Horowitz J.C. Day R.M. Thomas P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12384-12389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), data showing interactions involving TGFβIIR and αvβ3 have not been described. In this study we have examined the interaction between TGFβIIR and αvβ3 integrins in normal human lung fibroblasts. We found that TGFβ1 induces transcription of the β3 subunit and cell surface expression of αvβ3 integrins. Immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation studies suggest that αvβ3 associates with TGFβIIR following exposure to TGFβ1. Using a novel biophysical method, BRET, we have shown that these receptors cluster and functionally interact in living cells in a TGFβ1-specific manner. As a consequence of this interaction, fibroblast proliferation and adhesion induced by TGFβ1 was significantly amplified when cells were co-exposed with the αvβ3 ligands, TN and VN. Materials—Normal diploid human fetal lung fibroblasts (HFL-1) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Culture media, l-glutamine, penicillin, gentamicin, anti-αvβ5 (clone P1F6), and LipofectAMINE Plus were purchased from Invitrogen (Victoria, Australia). TGFβ1, VN, CN IV, laminin (LM), methyl-β-cyclodextrine (MCD), and protease inhibitor mixture were obtained from Sigma (New South Wales, Australia). The rabbit polyclonal anti-TGFβIIR antibody, anti-TGFβIIR antibody conjugated to agarose beads, and protein A-Sepharose were purchased from Santa Cruz Bio-technology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Enhanced chemiluminescence and the BrdUrd incorporation proliferation assay were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. The β3 plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. D. A. Cheresh (Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA), and the TGFβIIR plasmid was generously provided by Dr. J. Freeman (University of Texas Health Science Centre, San Antonio, TX). The RNeasy mini columns and OneStep RT-PCR kit were purchased from Qiagen (Victoria, Australia). Coelenterazine (h form) 488, anti-mouse IgGs conjugated to Alexa-546, and goat anti-rabbit IgGs conjugated to Alexa-488 were from Molecular Probes (Leiden, Netherlands). 96-well white optiplates were obtained from Packard instruments (Berthold, Australia). The peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was obtained from DAKO (New South Wales, Australia). The cyclic RGD peptide, Gpen-GRGDSPCA was purchased from Bachem (Bubendorf, Switzerland). The RGD peptide, GRGDNP, and TN were obtained from Calbiochem. Polyclonal antibodies against cyclin D1, α5β1, and monoclonal αvβ3 (clone LM609) were obtained from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Cell Culture—HFL-1 cells were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, penicillin, and gentamicin. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting was performed as previously described (11Scaffidi A.K. Moodley Y.P. Weichselbaum M. Thompson P.J. Knight D.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3507-3516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were stimulated with TGFβ1 for various periods of time and lysed for 20 min in Nonidet P-40 buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10% glycerol) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture. One milligram of protein was immunoprecipitated for 12 h at 4 °C with integrin-specific antibodies. The protein-antibody complex were then precipitated with protein A-agarose, separated on a 4-15% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel, electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and probed with anti-TGFβIIR antibody. This was followed by detection of bound antibodies with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). In some experiments, reverse immunoprecipitation was performed. For these studies, 1 mg of total cell protein was immunoprecipitated for 12 h at 4 °C with anti-TGFβIIR antibodies conjugated to agarose beads. For experiments examining the effects of cholesterol depletion, cells were treated with 2% solution of MCD for 1 h and then washed twice with PBS, prior to TGFβ1 (10 ng/ml) exposure for 5 min. β3/EYFP, β3/Rluc, TGFβIIR/EYFP, and TGFβIIR/Rluc Constructs—The human β3/Rluc, β3/EYFP, TGFβIIR/Rluc, and TGFβIIR/EYFP cDNA constructs in pcDNA3 were generated by PCR amplification from the human β3 or TGFβIIR cDNA without their stop codons using sense and antisense primers containing HindIII and EcoRV sites, respectively. The fragment was then cloned in-frame into the Rluc or EYFP vector constructed by insertion of the Rluc or EYFP coding region into pcDNA3 as previously described (29Kroeger K.M. Hanyaloglu A.C. Seeber R.M. Miles L.E. Eidne K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12736-12743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Transient Transfection—Lung fibroblasts were seeded in 6-well tissue culture plates, and transient transfections were performed the following day using 4 μg of DNA and LipofectAMINE plus as per the manufacturer's instructions. Flow cytometry was used to measure expression level of EYFP-tagged receptors. BRET Assay—Forty-two hours post-transfection cells were detached with 0.05% trypsin/EDTA and washed twice in PBS. Cells were resuspended in PBS, and ∼5 × 104 cells were distributed to each well of 96-well white Optiplates and incubated in the presence or absence of TGFβ1 or ECM protein for the specified times at 37 °C. Coelenterazine (h form) 488 was added to a final concentration of 5 μm, and readings were taken immediately, unless otherwise specified. Repeated readings were taken for at least 5-30 min using a custom-designed BRET instrument, which allows sequential integration of the signals detected in the 440- to 500-nm (bioluminescence signal-Rluc) and 510- to 590-nm (fluorescence signal-EYFP) windows. The BRET ratios for the co-expression of the TGFβIIR/Rluc and β3/EYFP constructs were normalized against the BRET ratio for the TGFβIIR/Rluc expression construct alone. The BRET ratio is defined as: [(emission at 510-590) - (emission at 440-500) × cf]/(emission at 440-500), where cf corresponds to (emission at 510-590)/(emission at 440-500) for the Rluc construct expressed alone in the same experiment. Proliferation Assay—Cells were seeded onto 96-well tissue culture plates at a density of 7000 cells/well. Cells were stimulated with TGFβ1 and/or ECM proteins for 24 and 48 h. For experiments using RGD peptides, cells were exposed to either the RGD peptide GRGDNP, or the cyclic RGD peptide GpenGRGDSPCA 30 min prior to TGFβ1 and ECM protein stimulation. A BrdUrd incorporation proliferation assay was utilized as per the manufacturer's protocol. Cyclin D1 Flow Cytometry—Fibroblasts were placed in serum-free medium and stimulated with TGFβ (0.5 ng/ml) and/or TN (5 μg/ml) for 8 h. Cells were harvested and permeabilized in 0.25% Triton X-100 for 3 min followed by incubation with anti-cyclin D1 antibodies for 30 min at 4 °C. Following multiple washings, cells were incubated with a rabbit anti-mouse phyco-erythrin-conjugated secondary antibody. Labeled cells were analyzed by flow cytometry as described above. 10,000-30,000 events were collected for analysis. Positive fluorescence was expressed as channel number mean fluorescence intensity. For experiments examining the effects of cholesterol depletion, cells were treated with 2% MCD for 30 min and then washed twice with PBS, prior to stimulation. Confocal Microscopy—Transfected fibroblasts were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde and mounted using fade resistance aqueous mounting medium 48 h post-transfection. For co-localization experiments utilizing non-transfected cells, fibroblasts were incubated with TGFβ1 (10 ng/ml) or left unstimulated. Cells were fixed and incubated with anti-αvβ3 and anti-TGFβIIR antibodies. Z-series projections of fluorescent images of αvβ3 or TGFβIIR were obtained using a Bio-Rad MRC 1000 confocal laser-scanning microscope using COMOS software, as previously described (11Scaffidi A.K. Moodley Y.P. Weichselbaum M. Thompson P.J. Knight D.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3507-3516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RNA Extraction and Real-time PCR—Fibroblasts were treated with TGFβ1 (10 ng/ml) for the indicated times and lysed using RNeasy mini columns. PCR reactions were carried out using OneStep RT-PCR kit, including the SYBR Green reporter molecule. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis for β3 and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) was performed using the icycler I Q Multi-Color real-time PCR detection system. After determination of the CT (defined as the number of cycles for the amplification of a sample to reach a point where fluorescent intensity exceeded the threshold) the amount of mRNA in the sample was calculated from the CT of the sample relative to the standard curve, which correlates with the amount of starting material present. The obtained quantity was normalized to the amount of HPRT, and all the values for experimental samples are expressed as -fold differences between the stimulated mRNA sample and the stimulated mRNA sample. Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. of at least four experiments. Statistical comparisons of mean data were performed using one-way analysis of variance and Student's t test with Bonferroni correction performed post-hoc to correct for multiple comparisons. A p value of <0.05 was regarded as statistically significant. TGFβ1 Enhances Cell Surface Expression αvβ3—Flow cytometry was used to determine whether TGFβ1 altered cell surface expression of αvβ3 on human lung fibroblasts. Cells were treated with varying concentrations of TGFβ1 for 24 or 48 h. Fibroblasts stimulated with TGFβ1 at concentrations greater than 500 pg/ml demonstrated increased cell surface expression of αvβ3 by 24 h (Table I). Maximal increases in integrin expression were observed with 100 ng/ml TGFβ1, which produced a 40% increase in mean fluorescent intensity over control levels (19.6 ± 5.6 versus 13.0 ± 4.4 for unstimulated fibroblasts; Fig. 1A). Increased αvβ3 expression was also observed at 48 h, although levels of expression at this time were lower than seen at 24 h (Table I).Table IUp-regulation of αv β3 integrin expression on lung fibroblasts following TGFβ 1 treatmentTreatmentControlTGFβ11 pg/ml5 pg/ml500 pg/ml10 ng/ml100 ng/ml24-h13.0 ± 4.414.6 ± 5.814.4 ± 6.016.8 ± 6.2aValues are expressed as mean fluorescence intensity of four separate experiments ± S.E.; *p < 0.05 compared with control.18.2 ± 6.2aValues are expressed as mean fluorescence intensity of four separate experiments ± S.E.; *p < 0.05 compared with control.19.6 ± 5.6aValues are expressed as mean fluorescence intensity of four separate experiments ± S.E.; *p < 0.05 compared with control.48-h13.3 ± 4.212.8 ± 5.011.2 ± 3.214.9 ± 4.617.0 ± 4.517.1 ± 4.3a Values are expressed as mean fluorescence intensity of four separate experiments ± S.E.; *p < 0.05 compared with control. Open table in a new tab TGFβ1 Increases β3 mRNA Expression in Lung Fibroblasts—Because TGFβ1 increased cell surface expression of αvβ3, we determined whether this effect correlated with enhanced transcription of β3 mRNA. Real-time PCR was conducted on RNA harvested from fibroblasts after incubation with TGFβ1 (10 ng/ml), for varying lengths of time (0, 3, 6, and 24 h). Fig. 1B illustrates that TGFβ1 significantly increased transcription of β3 mRNA to a maximum of 2.4-fold over untreated cells after 6-h incubation. This effect of TGFβ1 was maintained for up to 24 h. TGFβIIR and αvβ3 Co-localize in Lung Fibroblasts—To determine whether TGFβIIR and αvβ3 co-localize, we performed confocal microscopy on cells stimulated by TGFβ1 or left untreated. Fig. 2A shows that TGFβIIR and αvβ3 exhibit distinct staining patterns and only weakly associate in the absence of TGFβ1. However as shown in Fig. 2B, a 5-min exposure to TGFβ1 (10 ng/ml) results in an overlapping staining pattern of the receptors (intense yellow staining), which indicates co-localization. This was particularly apparent along the cell membrane and at sites of focal contacts. The results obtained by confocal microscopy were confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation. Cell lysates were obtained from fibroblasts treated with TGFβ1 for various periods of time. Isolated proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-αvβ3 antibodies and immunoblotted with antibodies against TGFβIIR. As shown in Fig. 3A, TGFβIIR co-immunoprecipitates with αvβ3, indicating that these receptors form a complex. Moreover, this association was enhanced when fibroblasts were stimulated with TGFβ1 (10 ng/ml) with maximal effects seen following 5-min exposure. Immunocomplex formation remained elevated over basal levels with TGFβ1 stimulation for 40 min, and by 60 min the interaction began to diminish. Because cholesterol is essential for the maintenance of lipid rafts and integrin signaling complexes, we investigated the involvement of lipid rafts in the interaction between TGFβRII and αvβ3. Fig. 3B shows that cholesterol depletion from fibroblasts significantly impaired the TGFβ1-induced interaction between TGFβRII and αvβ3. The specificity of the interaction between the TGFβRII and αvβ3 was next investigated. We examined whether αvβ5 or α5β1, known to be expressed on fibroblasts, also partner TGFβRII. Fig. 3C shows that these integrins do not co-immunoprecipitate with TGFβRII following exposure to TGFβ1, suggesting the interaction is specific for αvβ3. BRET Occurs between TGFβIIR and αvβ3 Integrins in an Agonist-dependent Manner—Visualization of αvβ3-TGFβIIR co-localization by confocal microscopy does not measure direct association of the two receptor complexes, nor does it allow for the detection of low level protein interaction, and even though co-immunoprecipitation does have the ability to measure direct receptor interactions, it does not quantify this dynamic interaction in living cells. Therefore, we used the novel technique of BRET to investigate whether a biophysical interaction occurs between TGFβIIR and αvβ3 in fibroblasts in real-time. The TGFβIIR and αvβ3 cDNA were fused at the carboxyl-terminal with either Renilla luciferase (Rluc) or enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP). When the Rluc and EYFP moieties are <100 Å apart and ceolenterazine is added, energy transfer by Rluc to EYFP results in emission of a fluorescent signal. We compared the distribution of exogenously administered tagged receptors with endogenous forms of the receptors by using confocal microscopy. Comparison was made between fibroblasts expressing either the β3/EYFP or TGFβIIR/EYFP fusion protein with immunofluorescence staining of cells following binding of antibodies against β3 or TGFβIIR. TGFβIIR and β3 appeared to be diffusely expressed on the cell surface with some staining also appearing intracellularly. A similar distribution pattern was evident with the TGFβIIR/EYFP and β3/EYFP constructs (Fig. 4, A-D). BRET measurements performed on cells co-transfected with the TGFβIIR/Rluc and β3/EYFP showed that TGFβ1 induced an increase in the relative BRET ratio compared with untreated cells when readings were taken from 0 to 10 min as well as from 20 to 30 min (Fig. 5A). However, the latter time point showed a decline in the BRET ratio compared with 0-10 min treatment with TGFβ1. The basal BRET signal (cells treated with PBS) was not different from the signal generated by cells transfected with the TGFβIIR/Rluc construct alone. These data demonstrate that the two receptors functionally interact in an agonist-dependent manner and that the interaction was sustained over at least a 30-min time frame. In addition, stimulation of fibroblasts with an irrelevant stimulus, oncostatin M (OSM), which binds to the gp130 receptor and induces proliferation (30Scaffidi A.K. Mutsaers S.E. Moodley Y.P. McAnulty R.J. Laurent G.J. Thompson P.J. Knight D.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 136: 793-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), did not induce an increase in the BRET ratio. Slight increases in BRET seen with OSM are likely to be due to small fluctuations of nonspecific interactions between Rluc and EYFP moieties. The specificity of this interaction was further confirmed by the lack of BRET signal detected when cells were co-transfected with TGFβIIR/Rluc and the EYFP vector (at similar expression levels to that of the TGFβIIR/Rluc and β3/EYFP co-transfected cells), which had been stimulated with TGFβ1 (Fig. 5A). To determine whether TN enhanced the interactions between TGFβIIR and αvβ3 above that seen with TGFβ1, fibroblasts were exposed to either TN alone or TGFβ1 and TN. Following exposure to TN, a slight increase in the BRET ratio was seen. When cells were co-exposed to TGFβ1 and TN the BRET signal was not greater than that seen with TGFβ1 alone (Fig. 5B).Fig. 5Agonist-dependent interaction between TGFβIIR and αvβ3.A, BRET was measured in fibroblasts transfected with cDNAs encoding the TGFβIIR and β3 receptors fused at the carboxyl termini to Rluc or EYFP as indicated. Energy transfer was initiated with the addition of coelenterazine (5 μm) either directly after treatment (white bars) or 20 min post-treatment (black bars), and BRET reading were taken immediately over a 10-min time frame. The values were corrected by subtracting the background signal detected when TGFβIIR/Rluc was expressed alone. Data represents the mean ± S.E. of four to six independent experiments. B, BRET ratio measurements were performed in response to TN, TGFβ, and TN plus TGFβ1. Coelenterazine was added directly after treatment. Data represent the mean ± S.E. generated from four independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) TGFβ1 Potentiates the Proliferative Effects of Fibroblasts Exposed to αvβ3Ligands, VN and TN—Having established that TGFβIIR interacts with αvβ3 following exposure to TGFβ1, we next examined the functional consequences of this complex formation.

TGFβ1 had little effect on fibroblast proliferation over a 48-h period, increasing BrdUrd incorporation to a maximum of 20% above unstimulated levels (Fig. 6A). Similarly exposin"

They are best known for their role in growth cone guidance, although they also are widely expressed outside the nervous system. Plexins are thought to control axon guidance by modifying the growth cone cytoskeleton, and Rho GTPases have been strongly implicated in this response. However, the exact contribution of Rho proteins is unclear. Sema3A/Plexin-A1-induced growth cone collapse, for example, requires Rac activity, which is a surprising result given that this GTPase is usually associated with membrane protrusions. We show here that Sema3A-induced collapse of COS-7 cells expressing Plexin-A1 also requires Rac but not Rho activity and that the cytoplasmic tail of Plexin-A1 interacts directly with activated Rac. However, collapse induced by a constitutively activated version of Plexin-A1 does not require Rac. We propose a novel function for Rac, namely that it acts upstream of Plexin-A1 during semaphoring-induced collapse, to regulate the activity of the receptor.

Plexins are a family of transmembrane receptors characterized by the presence of a conserved intracellular domain of ∼600 amino acids known as the sex and plexins domain (1Maestrini E. Tamagnone L. Longati P. Cremona O. Gulisano M. Bione S. Tamanini F. Neel B.G. Toniolo D. Comoglio P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The sex and plexins domain is strikingly conserved across the plexin family (57-97% similarity) and consists of two blocks of high sequence conservation separated by a variable linker. Together with their co-receptors neuropilins, plexins act as functional receptors for members of the semaphorin family of growth cone guidance molecules (2He Z. Tessier-Lavigne M.

Rho GTPases are important modulators of cytoskeletal assembly, and they have been strongly implicated in the regulation of axon growth, guidance, and motility (14Luo L. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). The best-characterized Rho family members, Rho, Rac and Cdc42, regulate the formation of contractile actin-myosin filaments (15Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3809) Google Scholar), lamellipodia (16Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A.

Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3714) Google Scholar) respectively. Rho GTPases function as molecular switches, cycling between an “active” GTP-bound and an “inactive” GDP-bound conformation (18Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). Active GTPases interact directly with target proteins (also known as effectors) to trigger a downstream response (19Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1666) Google Scholar), and one of the major criteria used to identify putative effectors is that the protein interacts preferentially with the active (GTP-bound) form of the GTPase. In dorsal root ganglia and spinal motor neurons, Sema3A-induced collapse has been shown to require Rac activity (20Jin Z. Strittmatter S.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6256-6263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Kuhn T.B. Brown M.D. Wilcox C.L. Raper J.A. Bamburg J.R. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1965-1975Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Vastrik I.

This is a surprising observation, since in other cell types and even in neuronal-like cell lines, Rac mediates membrane protrusion. This result has been observed by several groups, and in addition, plexins co-localize with Rac and F-actin in growth cones following stimulation with Sema3A (23Fournier A.E. Nakamura F. Kawamoto S. Goshima Y. Kalb R.G. Strittmatter S.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 411-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Sema3A-induced collapse has also been reported to require Cdc42 activity in motor, but not dorsal root ganglia, neurons (20Jin Z. Strittmatter S.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6256-6263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Kuhn T.B. Brown M.D. Wilcox C.L. Raper J.A. Bamburg J.R. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1965-1975Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, Rac·GTP interacts directly with a member of the B-family of plexins, Plexin-B1, through a partial CRIB motif (24Vikis H.G. Li W. He Z. Guan K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Marton T.F. Goodman C. Neuron. 2001; 32: 39-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 28Vikis H.G. Sequin L. Guan K.-L. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 836-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that stimulation of Plexin-B1 by its ligand, Sema4D, induces local sequestration of Rac, thereby inhibiting signaling to its effector pathways. In this study, we show that Sema3A-induced collapse of COS-7 cells co-expressing Plexin-A1 and NP-1 requires both Rac and Cdc42 activity. We find that Rac·GTP associates directly with Plexin-A1 and that Rac is activated following Sema3A stimulation. Rho and Rho kinase (ROCK) are not required for this response, indicating that collapse is not a consequence of excessive contractile forces as has been shown for ephrin-A5-induced growth cone collapse mediated by the Eph family of tyrosine kinase receptors (29Wahl S. Barth H. Ciossek T. Aktories K. Mueller B.K. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Finally, a constitutively activated version of Plexin-A1 no longer requires Rac activity. Our results support a novel role for Rac, namely that it acts upstream of Plexin-A1 during semaphorin-induced collapse and is required for receptor activation.

All of the constructs prepared were sequenced fully. Cell Culture and Transfections—COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% complete fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). The Chinese hamster ovary K1 cell line was cultured in DME-Ham's F-10 medium plus l-glutamate (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% γ-globulin-free fetal calf serum (Ultrapure FCS, Sigma) and 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cell lines were grown at 37 °C in 10% CO2 and passaged at 80-90% confluency. Cells were seeded in 6-well plates (1.5 × 105 cells/well) containing glass coverslips 16-24 h prior to transfection (1.5 μg of DNA/transfection) using the Genejuice™ reagent (Novagen). For collapse assays, Sema3A-Fc (2 μg/ml in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) was used to stimulate transfected cells for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then fixed in cold 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. Immunofluorescence—Fixed cells were quenched in 2.7 mg/ml NH4Cl/PBS for 10 min, permeabilized if required in 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS for 5 min, and blocked in 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA)/PBS for 20 min. For immunostaining, cells were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in 2% BSA/PBS for 1 h. Fluorescent conjugated secondary antibodies or rhodamine-phalloidin diluted in 2% BSA/PBS were applied to cells for 30 min at room temperature. Coverslips were mounted in Mowiol mountant (Calbiochem), and images were captured using a Bio-Rad MRC 1000 confocal microscope. Yeast Two-hybrid Interaction Assays—A cDNA-encoding Plexin-A1(cyt) fused to the sequence encoding the GAL4 DNA-binding domain of the pYTH9 vector was stably integrated into the genome of the yeast strain Y190. Plexin-A1(cyt)::Y190 cells were transformed with cDNA encoding wild-type dRac, dRho, or dCdc42 fused to the sequence encoding the GAL4 activation domain in the pACTII vector. Putative interactions were assessed by growth on 3-AT-selective medium (33Aspenstrom P. Olson M.F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 228-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Slot Blot in Vitro GTPase Binding Assays—A nitrocellulose membrane was equilibrated in buffer A (50 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2) plus 0.1 mm DTT and placed into a slot blot apparatus (Bio-Rad). GST alone, GST-PAK/CRIB, or GST-Plexin-A1(frag) (10 μg/protein, prepared according to Sander et al. (34Sander E.E. ten Klooster J.P. van Delft S. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1009-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar)) was made up to 50 μl of total volume using binding buffer (1× 20 mm Tris-HCl (from a 1 m stock, pH 7.6) and 0.1 mm DTT) containing 1 mm MgCl2. These proteins were applied to the membrane and washed 3× in buffer A plus 0.1 mm DTT and then blocked in 1 m glycine, 5% marvel, 5% fetal calf serum, and 1% ovalbumin for 2 h at room temperature. Recombinant GTPases (35Self A. Hall A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) (5 μg/reaction, diluted with binding buffer containing 1 mm MgCl2) were loaded with GTP by incubation for 10 min at 30 °C in 0.84× binding buffer containing 5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mg/ml BSA, and 1 μl of [γ-32P]GTP (10 μCi/μl, 6000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and then placed on ice. The reactions were stopped by the addition of MgCl2 to 10 mm. To reduce background exposure levels, DTT was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. After blocking, the membrane was washed twice with buffer A containing 0.1 mm DTT and then incubated in buffer A containing 1 mm GTP, 1 mg/ml BSA, 0.1 mm DTT, and [γ-32P]GTP-loaded GTPase and agitated gently for 10 min at 4 °C. The membrane was washed 3× in TBS-T (20 mm Tris-HCl (from a 1 m stock, pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% v/v Tween 20), and bound radiolabeled GTPases were visualized using autoradiography. Immunoprecipitations—Cells were transfected 24 h prior to immunoprecipitation. Cells were washed in ice-cold buffer A containing 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate and lysed at 4 °C in radioimmune precipitation buffer (1% v/v Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris-HCl (from a 1 m stock, pH 7.5), 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and one complete protease inhibitor tablet) per well. Post-nuclear supernatants were prepared by centrifugation, and aliquots were removed to assess total protein levels. Lysates were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with specific antibodies, and protein G-Sepharose and immunoprecipitates were harvested by centrifugation and washed three times in ice-cold radioimmune precipitation buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted using SDS-sample buffer and analyzed by 10 or 15% SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. GTPase Pull-down Assays—COS-7 cells were serum-starved 10 h post-transfection. After an additional 14 h, cells were stimulated for 0, 10, 20, 30, or 60 min with fresh medium, either alone or supplemented with 2 μg/ml Sema3A-Fc. GTP-bound Rac was affinity-purified using GST-PAK/CRIB coupled to glutathione-agarose beads. Proteins were eluted using SDS-sample buffer, and Rac·GTP levels were assessed by 15% SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using mouse anti-Rac1 (36Patel J.C. Hall A. Caron E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1215-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Sema3A-Fc-induced Collapse Requires Rac and Cdc42 but Not Rho or p160ROCK—A COS-7 collapse assay was used to investigate the involvement of Rho GTPases in Sema3A-Fc-mediated collapse. Cells were co-transfected with vsv-Plexin-A1 and NP-1 with or without a dominant negative GTPase mutant (Myc-N17Cdc42, Myc-N17Rac1, or Myc-N19RhoA). After 18 h, cells were stimulated with 2 μg/ml Sema3A-Fc and labeled using a goat anti-hFc antibody and either a mouse anti-Myc antibody or phalloidin. In each experiment, 100 cells positive for both Myc and Sema3A-Fc staining were counted and classified as either collapsed or not collapsed. Dominant negative Cdc42 (Myc-N17Cdc42) completely inhibited Sema3A-Fc-induced collapse as only 30% of expressing cells collapsed in comparison to 70% of control cells (see Fig. 1, a-d and j). Dominant negative Rac (Myc-N17Rac1) also inhibited collapse with 45% of expressing cells collapsed in comparison to 70% of control cells (see Fig. 1, a, b, e, f, and j). This may be an underestimate of the true inhibition of collapse, because cells expressing dominant negative Rac showed a higher background of spontaneous collapse (40%) compared with control cells (20%). Western blot analysis was used to confirm that the inhibitory effects produced by GTPase mutants were not the result of changes in the expression levels of vsv-Plexin-A1 or NP-1 (Fig. 1i). Furthermore, the inhibitory effects observed were not a consequence of decreased surface expression of vsv-Plexin-A1 and NP-1, because Sema3A-Fc binds as efficiently with or without the dominant negative constructs (data not shown). Dominant negative Rho (Myc-N19RhoA) did not inhibit Sema3A-Fc-induced collapse (see Fig. 1, a, b, g, h, and j). To confirm that collapse is not a consequence of actin/myosin-induced cell contraction, Y-27632, a small molecule inhibitor of the serine-threonine kinase p160ROCK, was added and this also had no effect on collapse (Fig. 1j). Sema3A-Fc Induces Rac Activation—To determine whether Rac is activated in response to Sema3A-Fc, a GTPase pull-down assay was used. Cells were transfected with empty vector, NP-1, or vsv-Plexin-A1 and NP-1 and stimulated for 30 min with Sema3A-Fc, and Rac·GTP was precipitated from lysates using GST-PAK/CRIB bound to Sepharose beads. In COS-7 cells alone or cells expressing NP-1 only, the levels of Rac·GTP were almost undetectable following stimulation, whereas in cells expressing vsv-Plexin-A1 and NP-1, Sema3A-Fc induced a significant increase in the levels of active Rac (see Fig. 2). Additional experiments revealed modest activation 10 min after Sema3A-Fc stimulation, and maximum activation was seen at 30 min (see Fig. 2). Rac Acts Upstream of Plexin-A1 to Regulate the Activity of the Receptor—Takahashi and Strittmatter (31Takahashi T. Strittmatter S. Neuron. 2001; 29: 429-439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) demonstrate that mutants of Plexin-A1 lacking either the Sema domain (Plexin-A1ΔSEM) or the whole extracellular region (Plexin-A1ΔECT) are constitutively active when introduced into COS cells (31Takahashi T. Strittmatter S. Neuron. 2001; 29: 429-439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). To test whether this response is still Rac-dependent, COS cells were transfected with Myc-Plexin-A1ΔSEM or Myc-Plexin-A1ΔECT, either alone or in combination with green fluorescent protein or dominant negative Rac (FLAG-N17Rac1). When expressed alone, Myc-Plexin-A1ΔECT and Myc-Plexin-A1ΔSEM induced collapse in 70 and 65% of cells, respectively (see Fig. 3, a, b, and d). However, dominant negative Rac was unable to inhibit collapse induced by constitutively active Plexin-A1 mutants (see Fig. 3, c and d). We conclude that Rac does not participate directly in the pathway leading from Plexin-A1 to the collapse response but it is required for Sema3A-induced collapse. Since Plexin-B1 has been shown to directly interact with Rac, we examined whether Rac might also interact directly with Plexin-A1. First, DNA encoding the 620 amino acid cytoplasmic tail of Plexin-A1 was subcloned into the yeast two-hybrid bait vector, pYTH9 (see Fig. 4a). The construct produced, hemagglutinin-Plexin-A1(cyt), was subsequently integrated into the genome of the yeast strain Y190, and Western blot analysis confirmed that the protein was expressed. Y190::Plexin-A1(cyt) yeast were then transformed with wild-type Rac, Rho, or Cdc42, and as shown in Fig. 4b, an interaction with Rac was clearly observed. To confirm this observation, a fragment of the cytoplasmic tail of Plexin-A1 was subcloned into the Escherichia coli expression vector, pGEX-4T2 (see Fig. 4a). The fragment chosen corresponded to the 149 amino acid stretch of Plexin-B1 previously defined as the minimal region sufficient for interaction with Rac (26Driessens M.H. Hu H. Nobes C.D. Self A. Jordens I. Goodman C.S. Hall A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 339-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The GST fusion protein (GST-Plexin-A1(frag)) was used in a slot blot in vitro GTPase binding assay using [γ-32P]GTP-bound Rac. GST-PAK/CRIB was used as a positive control. As shown in Fig. 4, c and d, Rac·GTP interacts with the cytoplasmic tail of Plexin-A1. vsv-Plexin-A1-GGA Is unable to Mediate Collapse but Still Activates Rac following Sema3A-Fc Stimulation—Plexin-A1 does not contain an obvious CRIB motif (24Vikis H.G.

Li W. He Z. Guan K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12457-12462Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Cells expressing NP-1 together with either vsv-Plexin-A1 or vsv-Plexin-A1-GGA were stimulated with Sema3A-Fc. In cells expressing NP-1 and vsv-Plexin-A1-GGA, only 7% of cells with bound Sema3A-Fc collapsed compared with 85% of cells expressing NP-1 and vsv-Plexin-A1 (see Fig. 5, b-d). This effect was not a consequence of vsv-Plexin-A1-GGA failing to reach the cell surface as unpermeabilized cells displayed a strong staining of vsv-Plexin-A1-GGA and efficient interaction with Sema3A-Fc (data not shown).Fig. 5Rac activation by Sema3A-Fc occurs independently of the collapse response.a, schematic showing the vsv-Plexin-A1-GGA mutant prepared by site-directed mutagenesis. b-d, cells expressing vsv-Plexin-A1-GGA and NP-1 were stimulated 24 h post-transfection for 30 min with 2 μg/ml Sema3A-Fc.

Cells were transfected with NP-1, either alone or in combination with vsv-Plexin-A1 or vsv-Plexin-A1-GGA. These experiments demonstrated that Sema3A-Fc was able to induce Rac activation in cells expressing NP-1 and vsv-Plexin-A1-GGA (see Fig. 5e). Potential Autoinhibitory Interactions within the Cytoplasmic Tail of Plexin-A1—The discovery that Plexin-B1 and Plexin-A1 interact with Rac·GTP raises the possibility that these receptors may be targets of Rac. A characteristic feature of many Rho GTPase effector proteins, e.g. WASP or p65PAK, is the presence of an autoinhibitory interaction (38Rohatgi R. Ho H.Y. Kirschner M.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1299-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 39Prehoda K.E. Scott J.A. Mullins R.D. Lim W.A.

J. Biol.

The possibility that a similar interaction might occur within the cytoplasmic tail of Plexin-A1 was explored using immunoprecipitation experiments. Fragments of Plexin-A1 and Plexin-B1 were subcloned into the mammalian expression vectors, pRK5FLAG or pRK5Myc (see Fig. 6a), and cells were transfected with various combinations. Immunoprecipitations were performed using mouse anti-Myc or mouse anti-FLAG antibodies, and precipitated proteins were assessed by Western blot analysis. Blots were probed with mouse anti-Myc and mouse anti-FLAG antibodies. A strong interaction could be seen between the N-terminal (PH1a) and C-terminal (PH2a) cytoplasmic sequences of Plexin-A1 (see Fig. 6, b and c). Similar interactions could be seen using the corresponding fragments of Plexin-B1 (Fig. 6, b and c). This finding demonstrates the potential for an intramolecular interaction within the cytoplasmic tail of Plexin family members or an intermolecular interaction between homodimerized receptors. The GGA triple point mutation prevents Plexin-A1 from mediating Sema3A-Fc-induced collapse and inhibits Rac binding to Plexin-B1 (24Vikis H.G. Li W. He Z. Guan K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12457-12462Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). To determine whether this affects the proposed intra/intermolecular interactions, the PH2a segment of Plexin-A1 was co-expressed with a PH1a-GGA segment. As seen in Fig. 6d, PH1a-GGA still interacted with Myc-Plexin-A1 PH2a, although the level of this interaction was reduced. The Rac-binding region of Plexin-B1 has been mapped to the very end of the fragment corresponding to PH1a shown in Fig. 6a. The fragments lacking this region (PH1aΔRBD) were made from Plexin-A1 and Plexin-B1 (28 and 24 amino acid deletions, respectively) and co-expressed with fragment PH2a. As seen in Fig. 6e, the PH2a fragment of Plexin-A1 was unable to associate with PH1aΔRBD. A similar result was found with the corresponding Plexin-B1 fragments (Fig. 6f). In addition, to examine whether the cytoplasmic regions of Plexin-A1 can interact through an intermolecular interaction, the cytoplasmic tail was subcloned into pRK5FLAG and pRK5Myc (see Fig. 6a). As seen in Fig. 6g, after co-transfection, FLAG-Plexin-A1(cyt) can be efficiently co-precipitated with Myc-Plexin-A1(cyt). Finally, to determine whether or not active GTPases influence the proposed intra/intermolecular interactions, the PH1a and PH2a segments of Plexin-A1 were co-expressed with either constitutively activated Cdc42 (FLAG-L61Cdc42) or Rac (FLAG-L61Rac1). The presence of FLAG-L61Cdc42 had no affect on the interaction between Plexin-A1 PH1a and PH2a, whereas the addition of FLAG-L61Rac1 significantly reduced the amount of FLAG-Plexin-A1 PH1a precipitated (see Fig. 7). It has been reported previously that Rac plays a role in signaling downstream of Sema3A in the growth cone collapse assay of primary neurons (20Jin Z. Strittmatter S.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6256-6263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Kuhn T.B. Brown M.D. Wilcox C.L. Raper J.A. Bamburg J.R. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1965-1975Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Vastrik I. Eickholt B.J. Walsh F.S. Ridley A. Doherty P. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 991-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Here we show that Rac activity is required during Sema3A-induced collapse of COS-7 cells expressing the Plexin-A1 and NP-1 co-receptors and furthermore that Rac is activated following Sema3A stimulation. Intriguingly, however, collapse induced by constitutively active Plexin-A1 does not require Rac activity. Therefore, it appears that Rac is not required for receptor-induced collapse per se but is required for a ligand-induced collapse. One possible way to account for this is that Plexin-A1 is a Rac target and that Rac is required for receptor activation. This explanation fits well with our observations that (i) the cytoplasmic tail of Plexin-A1 interacts directly with Rac·GTP, (ii) the cytoplasmic region of Plexin-A1 can form intramolecular or intermolecular interactions through sequences located in the N- and C-terminal parts of the tail that overlap with the region required for Rac binding, and (iii) constitutively activated Rac can inhibit this intra/intermolecular interaction. Many of the characterized Rho GTPase targets such as p65PAK, WASp, and mDia are known to form autoinhibitory intramolecular interactions, which can be relieved upon binding of an active GTPase. Therefore, we propose that the binding of Rac·GTP relieves an autoinhibitory conformation of the cytoplasmic tail of Plexin-A1. The requirement for Rac but not Rho or p160ROCK downstream of Sema3A suggests that the collapse we observe in COS cells is not a consequence of excessive actin/myosin contractile forces driven by Rho. Others have reached the same conclusion using neurons (43Arimura N. Inagaki N. Chihara K. Menager C. Nakamura N. Amano M. Iwamatsu A. Goshima Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23973-23980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). To date, many of the ideas surrounding neuronal morphogenesis such as growth cone collapse and neurite extension have assumed that Rho acts antagonistically to Rac/Cdc42, the former producing contraction/retraction responses and the latter producing protrusive/extension processes (14Luo L. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar, 45Dickson B.J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 46Patel B.N. Van Vactor D.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Thus lysophosphatidic acid-induced neurite retraction is mediated by Rho (47Jalink K. van Corven E.J. Hengeveld T. Morii N. Narumiya S. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar) as is ephrin-A5-induced growth cone collapse (29Wahl S. Barth H. Ciossek T. Aktories K. Mueller B.K. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The observation that Sema3A-induced collapse requires active Rac suggests that this simple model may be an oversimplification. Indeed, Fan et al. (48Fan X. Labrador J.P. Hing H. Bashaw G.J. Neuron. 2003; 40: 113-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) have provided in vivo evidence that Rac is required in slit-mediated midline repulsion in Drosophila, whereas Jurney et al. (49Jurney W.M. Gallo G. Letourneau P.C. McLoon S.C. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6019-6028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Marston et al. (50Marston D.J. Dickinson S. Nobes C.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 879-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) demonstrate the involvement of Rac in ephrin-A2- and ephrin-B2-induced repulsive responses, respectively. It appears that growth cone guidance may be a more complicated process than a simple Rho/Rac antagonism at the level of the actin cytoskeleton. The activation of Rac by Sema3A that we describe here is in contrast to reports by others that stimulation of another plexin family member, Plexin-B1, by its ligand Sema4D does not result in Rac activation (51Swiercz J.M. Kuner R. Behrens J. Offermans S. Neuron. 2002; 35: 51-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). In addition, others (24Vikis H.G. Li W. He Z. Guan K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12457-12462Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 25Rohm B. Rahim B. Kleiber B. Hovatta I. Puschel A.W.

Neurosci. 2002; 22: 471-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have failed to detect an association of Rac with Plexin-A1. The reasons for these discrepancies are not known. Through the use of the Plexin-A1-GGA mutant, we do know that Rac activation is not a consequence of the collapse-induced response. As for the direct interaction between Plexin-A1 and Rac, this is clearly much more difficult to detect than the interaction of Rac with some of its better-characterized targets such as PAK. However, in our hands it is comparable to the interaction seen between Rac and Plexin-B1. Sequence analysis demonstrates that unlike Plexin-B1, Plexin-A1 does not contain a recognizable CRIB motif. However, three critical amino acids (LVP) within the CRIB region of Plexin-B1 are conserved at a similar location in Plexin-A1. These residues have previously been shown to be required for the association between Plexin-B1 and Rac (24Vikis H.G. Li W. He Z. Guan K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12457-12462Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Mutation of these residues in Plexin-A1 (Plexin-A1-GGA) produces a receptor that is unable to mediate Sema3AFc-induced collapse, although it can still activate Rac. Since this GGA mutant is still capable of participating in intramolecular interactions within the cytoplasmic tail, this would be consistent with this mutant existing in an inactive conformation that is no longer responsive to activation by Rac. However, the situation may be yet more complicated since other GTPases have been reported to interact with Plexin-B1 but not with the GGA mutant, including Rnd1 (44Oinuma I. Katoh H. Harada A. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25671-25677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and RhoD (32Zanata S.M. Hovatta I. Rohm B. Puschel A.W. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 471-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whether or not all of these putative GTPase interactions play a role in vivo downstream of Plexin-A1 will require further analysis.

However, the FGF signaling mechanisms controlling osteoblast function are poorly understood. Here, we identified a role for the Src family members Lyn and Fyn in osteoblast differentiation promoted by constitutive activation of FGF receptor-2 (FGFR2). We show that the overactive FGFR2 S252W mutation induced decreased Src family kinase tyrosine phosphorylation and activity associated with decreased Lyn and Fyn protein expression in human osteoblasts. Pharmacological stimulation of Src family kinases or transfection with Lyn or Fyn vectors repressed alkaline phosphatase (ALP) up-regulation induced by overactive FGFR2. Inhibition of proteasome activity restored normal Lyn and Fyn expression and ALP activity in FGFR2 mutant osteoblasts. Immunoprecipitation studies showed that Lyn, Fyn, and FGFR2 interacted with the ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl and ubiquitin. Transfection with c-Cbl in which the RING finger was disrupted or with c-Cbl with a point mutation that abolishes the binding ability of the Cbl phosphotyrosine-binding domain restored Src kinase activity and Lyn, Fyn, and FGFR2 levels and reduced ALP up-regulation in mutant osteoblasts. Thus, constitutive FGFR2 activation induces c-Cbl-dependent Lyn and Fyn proteasome degradation, resulting in reduced Lyn and Fyn kinase activity, increased ALP expression, and FGFR2 down-regulation. This reveals a common Cbl-mediated negative feedback mechanism controlling Lyn, Fyn, and FGFR2 degradation in response to overactive FGFR2 and indicates a role for Cbl-dependent down-regulation of Lyn and Fyn in osteoblast differentiation induced by constitutive FGFR2 activation.

Ligand binding induces dimerization of the receptor, resulting in activation of intrinsic tyrosine kinase and of multiple downstream signaling processes that contribute to the regulation of cell growth and differentiation in several tissues (2Basilico C.

Activation of these receptors causes phosphorylation of Src family kinases and increases their intrinsic activity. Src family kinase activity is also controlled by binding of multiple proteins to SH2 or SH3 domains. The proto-oncogene c-cbl has been shown to associate with the SH3 domain in some Src family kinases and thereby may control their kinase activity (22Sanjay A. Horne W.C. Baron R. Science's STKE. 2001; (http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sigtrans;2001/110/pe40)PubMed Google Scholar). c-Cbl can interact with several members of the Src kinase family, including c-Src, Fyn, Lyn, Yes, and Syk (23Howlett C.J.

The molecular mechanisms by which c-Cbl exerts this negative regulation involve c-Cbl recruitment and polyubiquitination of activated receptors (38Joazeiro C.A. Wing S.S. Huang H. Leverson J.D.

The important domains of c-Cbl involved in the negative regulation of EGF and PDGF receptors were found to be the phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain, which is involved in c-Cbl binding to the activated receptor, and the RING finger, which directs recruitment of the ubiquitin system (40Waterman H.

Las I. Li A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6684-6689Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Although intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity induced by gain-of-function FGFR mutations is associated with increased FGFR2 down-regulation (43Bresnick S. Schendel S. J. Craniofac. Surg. 1998; 9: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), it is unknown if c-Cbl plays a role in FGFR2 degradation induced by overactive FGFR2 mutations.Given that c-Src was found to be a negative regulator of osteoblast differentiation in mice (44Marzia M. Sims N.A. Voit S. Migliaccio S. Taranta A. Bernardini S. Faraggiana T. Yoneda T. Mundy G.R. Boyce B.F. Baron R. Teti A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that constitutive activation of FGFR2 induced by FGFR2 mutations in human osteoblasts may result in alterations in recruitment and degradation of Src family kinases, which may contribute to premature osteoblast differentiation. In this work, we show that the activating FGFR2 S252W mutation enhances c-Cbl-dependent down-regulation of Lyn and Fyn and subsequent inhibition of their kinase activity. This effect is biologically relevant in that it reduces the alkaline phosphatase up-regulation induced by the activating FGFR2 mutation in human osteoblasts. Moreover, we show that, in addition to Lyn and Fyn down-regulation, the activating FGFR2 mutation induces c-Cbl-dependent ubiquitination of FGFR2. This study reveals a common Cbl-dependent mechanism controlling Lyn, Fyn, and FGFR2 down-regulation in response to overactive FGFR2 and indicates a role for Cbl-dependent down-regulation of Lyn and Fyn in the increased osteoblast differentiation induced by constitutive FGFR2 activation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines and Culture—Normal and FGFR2 mutant human calvaria cells obtained from Apert and control fetuses were immortalized by transfection with the origin-defective large T antigen of the SV40 oncogene as described previously and called Apert and control cells (11Lomri A. Lemonnier J. Hott M. de Perseval N. Lajeunie E. Munnich A. Renier D. Marie P.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 1310-1317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Apert mutant cells display increased expression of osteoblast marker genes such as ALP, COLIA1, and osteocalcin and increased in vitro osteogenic capacity compared with normal control cells, a phenotype that is similar to the pathological features observed in fetal Apert coronal sutures in vivo (12Lemonnier J. Hott M. Delannoy P. Lomri A. Modrowski D. Marie P.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 158-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 292 mg/liter glutamine, 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin.Stimulation of Src Kinase Activity—Src kinase activation is an early event shown to be involved in activation of signaling pathways induced by the G protein-coupled lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptor (47Yuan J. Slice L.W. Gu J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4882-4891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). LPA receptor activation is coupled to several heterotrimeric G proteins such as Gi, which activate Src tyrosine kinases (48Maschberger P. Bauer M. Baumann-Siemons J. Zangl K.J. Negrescu E.V. Reininger A.J. Siess W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19159-19166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). One mechanism involves LPA-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 and c-Src activation (49Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). To determine the role of the decreased Src family kinase activity in the osteoblast phenotype induced by FGFR2 activation, confluent control and Apert osteoblasts were treated with LPA (10 μm; Sigma) or the selective α2A-adrenergic receptor agonist UK 14,304 (10 μm; Sigma), which can activate Src family kinases (49Dikic I.

Apert and control cells were treated for 24 h, and then total Src kinase activity was determined as described below. After 24 h of treatment, ALP activity, an early marker of osteoblast differentiation that is constitutively increased in FGFR2 human mutant osteoblasts compared with control cells (11Lomri A.

Investig. 1998; 101: 1310-1317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Inhibition of Proteasome Activity—Lactacystin is a specific proteasome inhibitor that acts by binding covalently to the active-site N-terminal threonine residue in certain proteasome β-subunits (51Fenteany G. Schreiber S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8545-8548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). To determine whether Lyn, Fyn, and FGFR2 are degraded by the proteasome in FGFR2 mutant osteoblasts, FGFR2 mutant cells were treated with lactacystin (10 μm; Calbiochem) for 24 h, and Lyn, Fyn, and FGFR2 protein levels were determined by Western blot analysis as described below.In Vitro Kinase Assay—Total Src activity was determined using an assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. and Euromedex, Mundolsheim, France) designed to measure the phosphotransferase activity of all Src kinases. The assay kit is based on measurement of phosphorylation by Src family kinases of a specific substrate peptide (KVEKIGEGTYGVVYK) using the transfer of the γ-phosphate of [5′-32P]ATP. Proteins (10 μg) were diluted in reaction buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 125 mm MgCl2, 25 mm MnCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 250 μm sodium orthovanadate, and 2 mm dithiothreitol) with 10 μl of manganese/ATP mixture (1 mCi/100 μl) and incubated for 10 min at 30 °C with agitation. Proteins were precipitated with 20 μl of 40% trichloroacetic acid at room temperature for 5 min, and 25 μl of the final solution were spotted onto phosphocellulose P-81 paper squares, which were washed five times with 0.75% phosphoric acid. After 3 min in acetone, the assay squares were transferred to a scintillation vial containing 5 ml of scintillation mixture and measured in a scintillation counter.Transient Transfection—All cells were plated at 2500 cells/cm2 the day before transfection. The cells were cotransfected with the plasmid (2.5 μg/3-cm dish) and pSV-β-galactosidase control vector (50 ng of β-galactosidase; Promega) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 1% fetal calf serum. Cells were incubated with empty vector (pcDNA3) or Lyn, Fyn, 70Z-Cbl, or Cbl G306E vector and Exgen (Euromedex) according to the manufacturer's directions. Efficiency of transfection was controlled by determination of β-galactosidase activity (β-galactosidase reporter gene assay; Roche Applied Science). The number of β-galactosidase-positive cells was counted 24 h post-transfection.Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR Analysis—The levels of lyn, fyn, ALP, and COLIA1 mRNAs were analyzed by RT-PCR. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with Extract-All reagent (Eurobio) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Three μg of total cellular RNA from each sample were reverse-transcribed, and the cDNA samples were then divided and amplified by PCR using specific primers for ALP, COLIA1, fyn, lyn, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). The primer sequences used for fyn were 5′-TTGGAGGTGTGAACTCTTCG-3′ (sense) and 5′-TGCCTGGATAGAGTCAACTGG-3′ (antisense), and those for lyn were 5′-CATCATCACCGAGTACATGGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-TTCTTCCGCTCGATGTATGC-3′ (antisense). The primers for ALP, COLIA1, and GAPDH were as described (14Lemonnier J. Haÿ E. Delannoy P. Lomri A. Modrowski D. Caverzasio J. Marie P.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 832-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Southern blotting was performed by running aliquots of amplified cDNA on 1.2% agarose gel, followed by transfer onto nylon membrane according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). Autoradiographic signals were quantified using a scanner densitometer (Transydine General Corp., Ann Arbor, MI), and the signal for each gene was related to that of GAPDH.Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Cell proteins were extracted in lysis buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 nm calyculin A, 50 nm microcystin LR, and 2 mm Na3VO4 (45Lemonnier J.

Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and protein content of the supernatants was determined using the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). For Western blot analysis, equal aliquots (80 μg) of protein lysates were electrophoresed on 6–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gels. Electrophoresed proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Hybond-P, Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were then reacted with either anti-phospho-Src antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), which recognizes all Src family members phosphorylated at Tyr416; with anti-Lyn or anti-Fyn antibody (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); or with anti-actin antibody (1:200; Sigma) and then incubated for 1 h with the appropriate affinity-purified anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.), probed with peroxidase-coupled specific secondary antibodies, and visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence detection kits (Amersham Biosciences). The levels of proteins were measured by scanning densitometry and corrected for actin.For immunoprecipitation analysis, equal aliquots (300 μg) of protein lysates were immunoprecipitated using 2.5 μg of specific antibody (anti-FGFR2, anti-Cbl, anti-Lyn, anti-Fyn, or anti-ubiquitin; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and incubated overnight at 4 °C in a rotating device. After 24 h, 20 μl of protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were then collected by centrifugation at 1200 × g for 3 min, and the pellets were washed four times with lysis buffer and resuspended in 50 μl of running buffer. Aliquots were then subjected to electrophoresis as described above, and membranes were reacted with anti-Lyn, anti-Fyn, anti-Cbl, anti-ubiquitin, or anti-FGFR2 antibody. Immunoblots were probed with peroxidase-coupled specific secondary antibodies and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence.For analysis of the kinase activity of specific Src family members, we used the Sam68 protein, which functions as a substrate for Src tyrosine kinases. Sam68 phosphorylation by Src family members reflects tyrosine kinase activity. Equal amounts of lysate proteins were immunoprecipitated for 18 h at 4 °C with the following antibodies (2 μg/ml): monoclonal anti-Src60 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), monoclonal anti-Fyn, polyclonal anti-Yes (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), polyclonal anti-Fgr (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), or polyclonal anti-Lyn (BD Biosciences). Sepharose beads (20–30 μl) were added during the last hour of incubation. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with kinase reaction buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm MgCl2, and 1.0 mm dithiothreitol and incubated with 10 μm [32P]ATP (50 μCi/ml) and 2.5 μg of Sam68 (p68) tyrosine kinase substrate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of 2× buffer, and the products were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The incorporation of [32P]phosphate was visualized by autoradiography.Data Analysis—Experiments were repeated two to four times, and the results presented are representative of all experiments. The results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. and were analyzed using the statistical package super-ANOVA (Macintosh, Abacus Concepts, Inc., Berkeley, CA). Differences between mean values were evaluated with a minimal significance of p < 0.05.RESULTSThe Overactive FGFR2 S252W Mutation Reduces Src Kinase Activity in Osteoblasts—To assess whether activation of FGFR2 induced by the gain-of-function S252W mutation alters total Src activity in mutant osteoblasts, we assessed the phosphorylation state of Src family kinases by Western blot analysis using a substrate that is phosphorylated by all Src family members. As shown in Fig. 1A, we observed a significant decrease in phosphorylation of Src family kinases at the tyrosine corresponding to Try416 in cells bearing the activating S252W mutation compared with control cells (Fig. 1A). The kinase assay confirmed that total Src kinase activity was reduced by ∼2-fold in mutant osteoblasts compared with control cells (Fig. 1B). Consistently, the in vitro kinase assay performed in FGFR2 mutant osteoblasts revealed decreased kinase activity of several Src kinase family members. Notably, the kinase activity of Lyn and Fyn was markedly decreased in mutant cells compared with control cells (Fig. 1C). Western blot analysis was then performed to investigate whether the observed decreased Lyn and Fyn kinase activity resulted from a decreased amount of Lyn and Fyn proteins. As shown in Fig. 1D, the amount of Lyn and Fyn proteins was markedly reduced in FGFR2 mutant osteoblasts compared with control cells. In contrast, RT-PCR analysis showed a similar amount of lyn or fyn transcripts in FGFR2 mutant cells compared with control cells (Fig. 1E). These results show that the overactive FGFR2 S252W mutation reduces the amount of Lyn and Fyn, resulting in decreased Lyn and Fyn kinase activity, which contributes to the decreased total Src kinase activity in mutant osteoblasts.Both Pharmacological Activation of Src Kinases and Overexpression of Lyn and Fyn Reduce ALP Up-regulation Induced by Overactive FGFR2—To determine whether the reduced Src family kinase activity may contribute to the premature osteoblast differentiation induced by the overactive FGFR2 mutation, we examined the effect of LPA, a known activator of Src ki"

Consistent with the resemblance of the Ser-4 phosphorylation site to the Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) consensus recognition sequence, inhibition of Plk1 by a kinase-defective mutation (K82M) abrogated B23 Ser-4 phosphorylation, whereas activation of Plk1 by a constitutively active mutation (T210D) enhanced its phosphorylation following in vivo transfection and in vitro phosphorylation assays.

Our findings provide insights into the biochemical mechanism underlying the role of Plk1 in mitosis regulation through the identification of Ser-4 in B23 as a major physiological substrate of Plk1. The onset of mitosis is executed through a series of extensive morphological reorganizations of the cellular architecture, including nuclear envelope breakdown, bipolar mitotic spindle formation, chromosome condensation, and segregation, to ensure the faithful partitioning of genetic and cytoplasmic components. It is known that these changes are carried out through a number of reversible phosphorylation events on relevant substrate proteins, catalyzed by their respective upstream protein kinases.

Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2923) Google Scholar), there is emerging evidence for the involvement of yet other protein kinases in the regulation of cell cycle progression (2Nigg E.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar).Polo-like kinases (Plks) are a conserved family of protein-serine/threonine kinases that have emerged as pivotal components of the cell cycle regulation machinery over the past few years (3Glover D.M.

They are structural and functional homologues of POLO from Drosophila melanogaster, characterized by the conservation of the polo box domains in their C termini, which are required to localize the kinases to subcellular structures such as mitotic spindle, centrosomes, and the midbody in dividing cells (5Lee K.S.

Despite a growing list of its physiological substrates such as Cdc25, Myt1, cyclin B, NudC, cohesin, and TCTP (translationally controlled tumor protein) that has been uncovered in recent studies, the signaling pathway through which Plk1 regulates microtubule dynamics such as bipolar mitotic spindle formation remains to be elucidated (12Toyoshima-Morimoto F.

Dysregulation of the centrosome cycle has been implicated in the formation of aneuploid cells that are commonly found in human tumors as a result of chromosome missegregation (18Duensing S. Munger K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1471: M81-M88Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 19Meraldi P. Nigg E.A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 521: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). As one of the major components in the pericentriolar material, B23/nucleophosmin (also called NPM, numatrin, or NO38) has been identified recently (20Okuda M. Horn H.F. Tarapore P. Tokuyama Y. Knudsen E.S. Hofmann I.A. Snyder J.D. Bove K.E. Fukasawa K. Cell. 2000; 103: 127-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar) as a substrate of CDK2/cyclin E. Phosphorylation of Thr-199 on B23 by CDK2/cyclin E at late G1 phase is a prerequisite for centrosome duplication (21Tokuyama Y. Horn H.F. Kawamura K. Tarapore P. Fukasawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21529-21537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Moreover, a number of additional putative recognition sites for various protein kinases can also be found in B23. However, whether these phosphorylation events actually occur in vivo, how each phosphorylation affects the physiological roles of B23, and the identities of respective upstream kinases still remain to be answered.Although both Plk1 and Plk3 have been implicated in regulating centrosomal functions (22Dai W. Wang Q. Traganos F. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6195-6200Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. In the present study, we have identified Ser-4 as a novel mitotic phosphorylation site on B23 by characterizing a cross-reacting signal with an antibody raised against a phosphorylation site epitope in Mek1/2, the upstream kinases of Erk1/2 identified through a Kinetworks™ phosphoprotein analysis. Detailed characterization of this phosphorylation event through employment of Plk1 mutants and RNA interference revealed that Plk1 is the major kinase directly responsible for B23 Ser-4 phosphorylation during mitosis. Interfering with Ser-4 phosphorylation of B23 in HeLa cells by overexpression of its mutants carrying point mutations at this phosphorylation site leads to abnormalities in centrosome duplication, chromosome segregation, and cytokinesis. Our results indicate that Plk1 exerts its roles in M-phase event regulation in part through its phosphorylation of B23 Ser-4.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines and Culture Conditions—HeLa (human cervical carcinoma), HEK 293 (human embryonic kidney cells), MCF-7 (human breast carcinoma), and A549 (human lung carcinoma) were maintained in either Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium or minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The culture dishes used for HEK 293 were coated with 2% poly-l-lysine (Sigma) for 20 min prior to each use.Antibodies and Chemicals—Anti-phospho-Mek1/2 (Ser-217/Ser-221), phospho-CDK1 (Thr-161), phospho-B23 (Thr-199), and anti-HA rabbit polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA). Anti-human B23 goat polyclonal antibody, anti-cyclin A, anti-cyclin B1 mouse monoclonal antibodies, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-CDK1 antibody was from Biosource International (Camarillo, CA). Anti-Plk1 and Plk3 (Fnk) antibodies were from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (South San Francisco, CA) and Abgent (San Diego, CA), respectively. Anti-FLAG mouse monoclonal antibody and anti-γ-tubulin rabbit polyclonal antibody were from Sigma. Protein kinase inhibitors including olomoucine, SB203580, PD98059, DRB, and LY294002 and calf intestine alkaline phosphatase were from Calbiochem. Active CDK1/cyclin B1 was expressed from baculovirus (Upstate Biotechnolgy, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). Dephosphorylated form of α-casein and other chemicals were purchased from Sigma, unless otherwise stated.Plasmid Constructs—Plasmid pGEX-4T-B23 wild-type (WT) was kindly provided by Dr. Kenji Fukasawa (University of Cincinnati). B23 gene was amplified by PCR, and a FLAG tag was incorporated into the C-terminal coding sequence. The resulting product was then subcloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). pcDNA3-B23-S4A-FLAG and -B23-S4E-FLAG were constructed using PCRs by replacing Ser-4 with Ala and Glu, respectively. B23-S4E-FLAG and B23-S4A-FLAG were re-inserted into pGEX-4T to generate GST-B23-S4E and -S4A constructs. The resulting mutant constructs were then confirmed by DNA sequencing. HA-tagged Plk1 constructs, pcDNA3-Plk1 wild-type (Plk1-WT), dominant-negative mutant (Plk1-K82M), and constitutively active mutant (Plk1-T210D) were provided by Dr. Raymond Erikson (Harvard University).Transient Transfection—At 40–60% confluency, cells were transiently transfected with plasmids indicated in the text using LipofectAMINE transfection reagent from Invitrogen according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfection medium was removed, and cells were incubated in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium for 48 h before harvesting or overnight prior to nocodazole treatment for 24 h.Kinetworks™Phosphoprotein Analysis—Total cell lysates were prepared as described previously (23Zhang H. Shi X. Hampong M. Blanis L. Pelech S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6905-6908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, scraped in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and sonicated for 15 s. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 100,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213510) Google Scholar). For the phosphoprotein screen from Kinetworks™, 300 μg of total protein were resolved on a 13% single lane SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. By using a 20-lane multiblotter from Bio-Rad, the membrane was incubated with different mixtures of up to three antibodies per lane that react with a distinct subset of at least 33 known phosphorylated cell signaling proteins of distinct molecular masses. After further incubation with a mixture of relevant horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), the blots were developed using ECL Plus reagent (Amersham Biosciences), and signals were quantified using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). The panel of target phosphoproteins detected by the Kinetworks™ KPSS 1.2 screen are listed in Fig. 1. Detailed information and protocols of the Kinetworks™ analysis have been published previously (25Pelech S. Sutter C. Zhang H. Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 218: 99-111Google Scholar) and can also be found at the Kinexus Bioinformatics Corp. website (www.kinexus.ca).Phospho-B23 (Ser-4) Purification and LC-MS and MS/MS Analyses—One hundred twenty milligrams of total protein from HeLa cells treated with 100 ng/ml nocodazole for 20 h were used as starting material for purification. The purification scheme included DEAE-Sephacel, phenyl-Sepharose, Mono Q, and Mono S. At each step, the protein signal was monitored by Western blotting analysis using anti-phospho-Mek1/2 (Ser-217/Ser-221) antibody. The Mono S fractions enriched for a 40-kDa immunoreactive protein were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration. The sample was then subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by Coomassie Blue staining of the gel. The 40-kDa immunoreactive protein band was excised and digested in-gel with trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI). A mass spectrometry sample was prepared according to the protocol described by Kinter and Sherman (26Kinter M. Sherman N.E. Protein Sequencing and Identification Using Tandem Mass Spectrometry. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2000: 147-160Google Scholar). LC-MS, MS/MS, and data search were performed by the Protein Chemistry Center of the University of Victoria (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada).Small Interference RNA—For Plk1 depletion, plasmid pSilencer™3.1-H1 vector from Ambion (Austin, TX) was constructed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Plk1 siRNA targeting human Plk1 sequence, GGGCGGCTTTGCCAAGTGCTT, corresponding to nucleotides 183–203 relative to the start codon, was synthesized. A scrambled sequence supplied by the manufacturer was used as a negative control. The resulting siRNA vectors were transfected into HEK 293 cells. Forty eight hours post-transfection, lysates were prepared, and the levels of both Plk1 and B23 Ser-4 phosphorylation were examined by immunoblotting.Immunoprecipitations, Kinase Assays, and GST-B23 Pull-down— For all immunoprecipitations, protein A-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were pre-incubated with 5 μg of antibodies for 4 h, followed by incubation with total cell lysates as indicated overnight at 4 °C.For CDK1 activity assay, 5 μg of active CDK1/cyclin B1 were incubated with 5 μg of histone H1 or GST-B23 (WT) in 50 μl of CDK1 assay buffer (25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 20 mm MOPS, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.25 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 μm β-methyl aspartic acid, pH 7.2) at 30 °C for 90 min followed by the addition of SDS sample buffer to stop the reaction.For Plk1 activity assay, Plk1 was either immunoprecipitated with anti-Plk1 antibody from 500 μg of untransfected cell lysates or anti-HA antibody from 500 μg of Plk1-transfected cell lysates. Immunocomplexes were then subjected to in vitro kinase assays with α-casein or GST-B23 as substrate, as described by Zhou et al. (15Zhou T. Aumais J.P. Liu X. Yu-Lee L. Erikson R.L. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 127-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) at 30 °C for 1 h. Reaction mixtures were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography or immunoblotting with the phospho-Mek1/2 antibody. His6-Plk3-A (active form of Plk3) was expressed in insect cells, and Plk3 activity assay was performed as described by Ouyang et al. (27Ouyang B. Pan H. Lu L. Li J. Stambrook P. Li B. Dai W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28646-28651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).For GST-B23 pull-down assay, GST-B23 absorbed on the beads was incubated with cell lysates in the Plk1 kinase assay buffer, followed by extensive washes with lysis buffer. The bound proteins were detected by immunoblotting using Plk1 antibody.Immunofluorescence Microscopy—B23-S4A- and -S4E-transfected HeLa cells grown on coverslips for 48 h after transfection were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature followed by extensive washes in PBS. After being permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min, cells were stained with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (1:250) and anti-γ-tubulin polyclonal (1:200) antibody in 3% bovine serum albumin for 2 h at room temperature followed by incubation with Alexa488-labeled anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (1:1000) and Alexa564-labeled anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 1 h in the dark. Nuclei were counterstained with 2 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for 10 min. Vector-transfected cells were used as a control. Cells were observed under a Nikon fluorescence microscope, and images were captured and analyzed using Northern Eclipse image software (Enpix, Ontario, Canada).RESULTSA Phospho-Mek1/2 (Ser-217/Ser-221) Antibody Recognizes a Mitotic-specific Phosphorylated Form of B23—To better understand phosphorylation events occurring during M-phase in mammalian cells, we employed the Kinetworks™ phosphoprotein analysis. This screen utilizes 31 phosphorylation site-specific antibodies to track changes systematically in the phosphorylation states of 33 known signaling proteins in mitotic HeLa cells induced by exposing exponentially growing cells to 100 ng/ml nocodazole for 20 h. Although a number of phosphorylation changes such as increased phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein Ser-780, Ser-807/Ser-811, and c-Jun Ser-73 were observed as expected, an ∼40-kDa phosphoprotein (pp40) was consistently detected by an antibody that was supposed to recognize phospho-Mek1/2 (Ser-217/Ser-221), with at least three times higher intensity in nocodazole-treated cells compared with Me2SO control cells (Fig. 1). The small size of pp40 precluded itself from being one of the original targets of the antibody, Mek1 and Mek2, which are ∼45-kDa proteins.To determine whether pp40 was a nocodazole-specific or a mitosis-associated protein, we monitored the level of pp40 in synchronized HeLa cells by releasing serum-starved cells from G0/G1 block with serum addition. A maximum level of pp40 was seen at 24 h after serum addition, coinciding with the time when cyclin B1 was maximally expressed and CDK1 was maximally phosphorylated at its Thr-161 activation site, followed by a gradual decrease (Fig. 2). Similarly, pp40 was also detected in HEK 293, A549, and MCF-7 cells by the same antibody with higher abundance in mitotic cells than interphase cells (data not shown), indicating that the increase of pp40 was generally associated with mitosis and was not a stress response to nocodazole treatment.Fig. 2pp40 is a mitosis-associated protein. Twenty four hours after serum starvation, serum was added back to the medium to induce HeLa cells to enter the cell cycle synchronously. At various time points after serum addition, cells were harvested, and total lysates were prepared. The pp40 signal was detected by immunoblotting with anti-phospho-Mek1/2 antibody (A), and the progression of the cell cycle was monitored by immunoblotting with anti-cyclin A (B), cyclin B1 (C), and phospho-CDK1 (Thr-161) antibodies (D). FBS, fetal bovine serum.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Because the phospho-Mek1/2 antibody was initially raised against a phosphopeptide corresponding to the sequences surrounding Ser-217/Ser-221 of Mek1, it seemed likely that pp40 shares a similar epitope with Mek1/2 and potentially represented a new class of Mek-like kinases, as suggested by Okano and Rustgi (28Okano J. Rustgi A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19555-19564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To reveal the molecular identity of pp40, we partially purified it from the total lysate of nocodazole-treated HeLa cells by sequential liquid chromatography over DEAE-Sephacel, phenyl-Sepharose, Mono Q and Mono S. These columns were developed with linear or step NaCl gradients. The elution profile of pp40 was monitored by immunoblotting with the phospho-Mek1/2 antibody at each step. Following Mono S chromatography, the fractions enriched for pp40 were pooled and separated on a SDS-PAGE gel. The band corresponding to pp40 was excised after Coomassie Blue staining and digested in-gel with trypsin. The sample was then subjected to LC-mass spectrometry. Five tryptic peptides from LC-MS were further characterized with tandem MS (MS/MS). A Mascot data base search revealed that pp40 was human B23/nucleophosmin (Fig. 3A).Fig. 3pp40 corresponds to the nucleolar protein B23/nucleophosmin. Purified pp40 from nocodazole-treated HeLa lysate was digested in-gel with trypsin, and the eluted fragments were subjected to LC-mass spectrometry followed by tandem MS of five tryptic peptides. Mascot data base search indicated that p40 is human B23/nucleophosmin (A). Reciprocal immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-B23 or phospho-Mek1/2 antibody from nocodazole-treated HeLa lysate further supported assignment of pp40 as B23 (B). WB, Western blot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The molecular identity of pp40 was further supported by reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation data. B23 was detected in phospho-Mek1/2 antibody immunoprecipitates by immunoblotting with a B23 antibody. Conversely, pp40 was found in anti-B23 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3B). Immunofluorescence microscopy with the phospho-Mek1/2 antibody revealed a signal exclusively localized within the nucleolus in interphase and translocated into cytoplasm during M-phase, consistent with the behavior of B23 (data not shown).B23 Is Phosphorylated at Ser-4 —Because the phospho-Mek1/2 antibody only reacts with the Ser-217/Ser-221-phosphorylated forms of Mek1 and Mek2, it was likely that pp40 might represent a phosphorylated form of B23. This was further supported by the fact that the increase of pp40 signal in response to nocodazole treatment was not due to the change in B23 protein level, as indicated by immunoblotting of nocodazole-treated and untreated HeLa lysates with a B23 antibody (Fig. 4, A and B). Treatment of lysates from nocodazole-treated HeLa, MCF-7, and A549 cells with 35 units of alkaline phosphatase for 4 h at 37 °C resulted in the disappearance of pp40, whereas the B23 protein level remained relatively constant, indicating the phospho-Mek1/2 antibody recognized a phospho-epitope on B23 (Fig. 4, C and D).Fig. 4pp40 is Ser-4-phosphorylated B23. Immunoblotting of HeLa lysates treated with nocodazole or Me2SO (DMSO) with anti-phospho-Mek1/2 (A) and B23 (B) antibodies revealed that the increase of pp40 was not due to a change in B23 protein level. Treating total lysates of nocodazole-treated HeLa, A549, and MCF7 cells with 35 units of alkaline phosphatase resulted in the disappearance of pp40 (C), whereas no effect was seen on the B23 level (D), indicating that pp40 is a phosphorylated form of B23. Sequence alignment between the antigenic peptide of anti-phospho-Mek1/2 antibody and B23 N terminus (residues 1–22) revealed the limited similarity in sequences around Ser-4 of B23 (E). Incubation of nocodazole-treated HeLa cell lysate with bacterially expressed GST-tagged B23 in vitro resulted in phosphorylation of B23-WT and B23-S4A at Thr199 (G), but only B23-WT at the site recognized by the phospho-Mek1/2 antibody (F). Me2SO-HeLa lysate was included as a control. The amount of GST-B23 proteins in the assays was shown by immunoblotting with anti-B23 antibody (H). Anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates from B23-WT-FLAG or B23-S4A-FLAG-transfected HEK 293, treated with nocodazole or Me2SO, were immunoblotted with phospho-Mek1/2 antibody (I) and anti-FLAG antibody (J).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To identify the phospho-epitope on B23 recognized by the phospho-Mek1/2 antibody, we aligned the human B23 full-length sequence with the antigenic phosphopeptide of the antibody using ClustalW algorithm (29Chenna R. Sugawara H. Koike T. Lopez R. Gibson T.J. Higgins D.G. Thompson J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3497-3500Crossref PubMed Scopus (4014) Google Scholar), and we found that only the flanking sequences of Ser-4 on B23 shared limited similarity with the antigenic peptide of the antibody (Fig. 4E). Three consecutive residues including Ser-4 (B23)/Ser-217 (Mek1) and two adjacent residues (Asp at -1 and Met at +1 positions) were identical between these two sequences.To test whether Ser-4 of B23 is the phosphorylation site recognized by the antibody, we constructed a nonphosphorylatable mutant of B23 (B23-S4A) by replacing Ser-4 with Ala and expressed B23 wild-type (B23-WT) and B23-S4A in Escherichia coli as GST fusion proteins. The ability of nocodazole-treated HeLa cell lysates to phosphorylate GST-tagged B23-WT and B23-S4A was tested through in vitro phosphorylation assays. As shown in Fig. 4, F–H, whereas B23-WT could be phosphorylated by HeLa lysate in response to nocodazole treatment, as determined by immunoblotting with anti-phospho-Mek1/2 antibody, the Ser-to-Ala substitution in B23 completely eliminated this phosphorylation event, indicating that Ser-4 phosphorylation might be targeted by the phospho-Mek1/2 antibody. The failure of B23-S4A phosphorylation by nocodazole-treated cell lysate could not be attributed to potentially incorrect folding of the bacterially expressed protein caused by Ser-4 mutation, as both B23-WT and -S4A could be readily phosphorylated by cell lysate at Thr-199 (Fig. 4G), a CDK2/cyclin E phosphorylation site (21Tokuyama Y. Horn H.F. Kawamura K. Tarapore P. Fukasawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21529-21537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), as detected by immunoblotting with an antibody against phospho-B23 (Thr-199).To verify the above results in vivo, we transfected HEK 293 cells with either a FLAG-tagged B23-S4A or B23-WT construct. After 20 h of nocodazole treatment, the overexpressed FLAG-tagged B23-WT or -S4A proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with anti-FLAG or anti-phospho-Mek1/2 antibody. As can be seen in Fig. 4, I and J, although the expression levels of B23-WT and B23-S4A were similar, the phospho-Mek1/2 antibody recognized two bands in B23-WT-transfected cell lysates, but only the lower band was detected in B23-S4A-transfected cell lysates. The differential immunoreactivities of the two bands with anti-FLAG and B23 antibodies indicated that the upper band corresponded to the overexpressed FLAG-tagged B23 proteins, whereas the lower band corresponded to endogenous B23. The disappearance of the upper band upon replacing Ser-4 with Ala confirmed that Ser-4 was the phosphorylation site recognized by the phospho-Mek1/2 antibody. The presence of the endogenous phospho-Ser-4 B23 in anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates might be due to the formation of oligomers between overexpressed B23 and endogenous B23 proteins. This is supported by the previous finding that the oligomeric forms are the major functional entities of B23 in cells (30Chan P.K. Chan F.Y. Biochim. Bi"

We have shown previously that PRH contains two domains that can independently bring about transcriptional repression. The PRH homeodomain represses transcription by binding to TATA box sequences, whereas the proline-rich N-terminal domain of PRH can repress transcription when attached to a heterologous DNA-binding domain. The Groucho/transducin-like enhancer of split (TLE) family of proteins are transcriptional co-repressors that interact with a number of DNA-bound transcription factors and play multiple roles in development. Here we demonstrate that the proline-rich N-terminal domain of PRH binds to TLE1 in vitro and in yeast two-hybrid assays. We show that PRH and TLE proteins are co-expressed in hematopoietic cells and interact in co-immunoprecipitation assays. We demonstrate that TLE1 increases repression by PRH in transient transfection assays and that titration of endogenous TLE proteins by co-expression of Grg5, a natural trans-dominant negative protein, alleviates transcriptional repression by PRH. Finally, we show that a mutation in the PRH N-terminal domain that blocks the PRH-TLE1 interaction in vitro eliminates co-repression.

Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6764-6773Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 12Hansen G.M. Justice M.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6531-6539Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In mice transplanted with bone marrow transduced with a PRH-expressing retrovirus, PRH can act as an oncogene and cause T-cell-derived lymphomas (11George A. Morse III, H.C. Justice M.J. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6764-6773Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 12Hansen G.M. Justice M.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6531-6539Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, PRH also acts as a tumor suppressor in some hematopoietic lineages. PRH can inhibit oncogenic transformation by the translation initiation factor eIF4E by disruption of the mRNA transport activity of eIF4E through a direct interaction with eIF4E in the nucleus (13Topisirovic I. Culjkovic B. Cohen N. Perez J.M. Skrabanek L. Borden K.L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 689-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Disruption of the nuclear localization of PRH is associated with the loss of this key regulatory function in a subset of myeloid leukemias (14Topisirovic I. Guzman M.L. McConnell M.J. Licht J.D. Culjkovic B. Neering S.J. Jordan C.T. Borden K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8992-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Thus, the effects of PRH on growth and differentiation are both dose-dependent and context-dependent. PRH also has an important role in the regulation of early embryonic patterning (4Thomas P.Q. Brown A. Beddington R.S. Development. 1998; 125: 85-94PubMed Google Scholar, 15Brickman J.M. Jones C.M. Clements M. Smith J.C. Beddington R.S.

Indeed, it plays a central role in the formation of the vertebrate head and the formation of many endoderm-derived organs such as liver and thyroid (5Bogue C.W. Ganea G.R. Sturm E. Ianucci R. Jacobs H.C. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 219: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). PRH functions as a transcriptional repressor in hematopoietic, liver, thyroid, and embryonic stem cells (15Brickman J.M. Jones C.M. Clements M. Smith J.C. Beddington R.S.

However, it has also been reported to activate transcription of its own gene in thyroid cells (20Puppin C. D'Elia A.V. Pellizzari L. Russo D. Arturi F. Presta I. Filetti S. Bogue C.W. Denson L.A. Damante G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 1845-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). PRH represses transcription in hematopoietic cells by binding to TATA box sequences and the TATA box binding protein using the PRH homeodomain. In addition, however, the proline-rich PRH N-terminal repression domain can repress transcription independently of the DNA binding activity of the homeodomain by as yet unidentified mechanisms (19Guiral M. Bess K. Goodwin G. Jayaraman P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2961-2970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Although the PRH N-terminal repression domain is known to bind to PML, eIF4E, and the proteosome subunit C8, these interactions have not been shown to influence transcriptional repression in vivo (7Topcu Z. Mack D.L. Hromas R.A. Borden K.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7091-7100Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 13Topisirovic I. Culjkovic B. Cohen N. Perez J.M. Skrabanek L. Borden K.L.

The TLE proteins are members of a family of co-repressor proteins that includes the murine Grg proteins and the Drosophila Groucho protein. Groucho/TLE family proteins are involved in many developmental decisions, including neuronal and epithelial differentiation, segmentation and sex determination, and differentiation of hematopoietic, osteoblast, and pituitary cells (23Courey A.J. Jia S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2786-2796PubMed Google Scholar, 24Dasen J.S. Barbera J.P. Herman T.S. Connell S.O. Olson L. Ju B. Tollkuhn J. Baek S.H. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11590-11595Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Members of the Groucho/TLE family do not have DNA binding activity but are instead recruited to DNA by interactions with DNA-binding proteins. In general, these proteins use a C-terminal region known as the WD repeat domain to interact with DNA-binding proteins (28Chen G. Courey A.J. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 249: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 29Pickles L.M. Roe S.M. Hemingway E.J. Stifani S. Pearl L.H.

Some members of the TLE family of proteins, such as Grg5, lack the WD repeat regions but retain the oligomerization Q domain. Overexpression of Grg5 can relieve TLE-mediated corepression, presumably because this protein retains the ability to tetramerize with full-length TLE proteins (32Ren B. Chee K.J. Kim T.H. Maniatis T.

Once recruited to a promoter, the Groucho/TLE proteins can bring about transcriptional repression by recruiting histone deacetylases (35Chen G. Fernandez J. Mische S. Courey A.J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 26604-26610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) or with the basal transcriptional machinery (39Yu X. Li P. Roeder R.G. Wang Z. Mol. Cell.

Here we show that the PRH N-terminal repression domain can interact with TLE1 in vitro and in vivo using a short sequence of amino acids that corresponds to an Engrailed homology (Eh-1) motif. Moreover, we demonstrate that the interaction between TLE1 and PRH is required for enhanced repression of transcription by PRH. Furthermore, we show that titration of endogenous TLE proteins by Grg5 decreases repression by PRH. Thus, TLE proteins co-repress transcription with PRH. Bacterial Expression Plasmids—A GST-tagged avian PRH N terminus (GST-PRHN1–141) expression vector has been described previously (19Guiral M. Bess K. Goodwin G. Jayaraman P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2961-2970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). PCR fragments encoding amino acids 1–125 or 61–141 of avian PRH and flanked by 5′ SalI and 3′ SpeI restriction sites were cloned into pGEX20T (Amersham Biosciences) downstream of the GST moiety to create pGEX-PRHN61–141 and pGEX-PRHN1–125. The GST-tagged human PRH N terminus expression vector pGEX-MycPRHN1–132 was created as follows. Briefly, a DNA sequence encoding the Myc-tagged human PRH N terminus (amino acids 1–132) was cloned as a BamHI-StuI fragment from pMUG1-MycPRH (see below) into pGEX20T (Amersham Biosciences). The PRH fragment was inserted between the unique BamHI site and the XbaI site in the vector by first modifying the XbaI restriction site with Klenow enzyme to blunt the XbaI restriction site. The pGEX-MycPRH F32EN1–132 plasmid that expresses the PRH N terminus carrying the F32E mutation was created exactly as described above except that the PRH N-terminal fragment was obtained from pMUG1-MycPRH F32E (see below). The DNA sequence of these plasmids and the plasmids described below were verified by DNA sequencing. Mammalian Expression and Reporter Plasmids—The pTK-PRH and pTK-GAL reporter plasmids have been described previously (19Guiral M. Bess K. Goodwin G. Jayaraman P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2961-2970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). pSV-β-galactosidase control vector (pSV-lacZ) was obtained from Promega. pBSK II-HPRH is a vector carrying the full-length human PRH cDNA and was a gift from Dr. G. Manfioletti (University of Trieste). The mammalian expression plasmid pFLAG-Grg5 (pCMV-Tag1-AES) expresses the Grg5 protein tagged with the pFLAG epitope and has been described previously (41Tetsuka T. Uranishi H. Imai H. Ono T. Sonta S. Takahashi N. Asamitsu K. Okamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4383-4390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and was a gift from Dr. T. Okamoto (Nagoya University). The mammalian expression plasmid pCMV2-FLAGTLE1 contains the TLE1 coding sequence in frame with the FLAG epitope. The FLAGTLE1 construct was generated by first digesting a pBluescript-TLE1 plasmid with BanII, followed by removal of protruding ends with T4 DNA polymerase and recovery of a 1.6-kb fragment encoding the N-terminal region of TLE1. This fragment was subcloned into pCMV2-FLAG digested with EcoRV. A second pBluescript-TLE1 restriction fragment obtained after digestion with SmaI and encoding the remaining half of TLE1 was then ligated in frame into the first ligation product to generate pCMV2-FLAGTLE1 expressing full-length TLE1. The mammalian expression plasmid pMUG1-MycPRH expresses full-length human PRH and was created as follows. pUHD15-1 (42Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4268) Google Scholar) was modified by replacing the sequence between the unique BamHI and EcoRI sites with a linker that destroys these two restriction sites and contains a multiple cloning sequence (MCS). The sequence of the linker is as follows: 5′-A ATT GGA TCC ATG GGA ATT CGA GGT CGA CAG TGA-3′. The linker contains a translational start signal (boldface type) and BamHI, NcoI, EcoRI, and SalI restriction sites. The resulting pMUG1 plasmid contains the CMV promoter with an MCS downstream. A BamHI-SmaI double-stranded oligonucleotide encoding a Myc tag (Myc 9E10 epitope) (5′-GATCCATGGAACAAAAACTCATCTCAGAAGAGGATCTG-3′) and a SmaI-EcoRI fragment from pBSK-HPRH carrying the human PRH coding sequence from amino acid 7 was inserted between the BamHI and EcoRI sites in pMUG1. This results in an expression construct where the PRH coding sequence was placed in frame with the Myc tag and the ATG in the MCS. Yeast Plasmids—pACT2 contains the GAL4 activation domain upstream of a MCS (Clontech). To create pACT2-HPRH, a SmaI-EcoRI fragment from pBSK-HPRH carrying the PRH coding sequence from amino acid 7 was ligated into pACT2 between the BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites. The BamHI site in pACT2 was filled in using Klenow enzyme to allow blunt end ligation with the PRH SmaI site. pGBT9-TLE1 contains the TLE1 cDNA in frame with the GAL4 DNA binding domain and has been described previously (31Grbavec D. Lo R. Liu Y. Stifani S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 43Grbavec D. Lo R. Liu Y. Greenfield A. Stifani S. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). pAS2-1 contains the GAL4 DNA binding domain upstream of a MCS (Clontech). To create pAS2-1-PRHN1–132, an EcoRI-StuI fragment from pBSK-HPRH encoding the N-terminal 132 amino acids of PRH was ligated between the EcoRI and SmaI sites of pAS2-1. An oligonucleotide was inserted between the EcoRI site in pAS2-1 and the internal SmaI site in HPRH to achieve the correct reading frame (5′-CATGCAGTACCCGCACCCC-3′). To create the deletion mutant pAS2-1-PRHN1–98, the pAS2-1-PRHN1–132 construct was digested with BamHI and partially digested with ApaI. An ApaI-BamHI oligonucleotide (5′-CGCCGCGCCCACG-3′) was then ligated between the ApaI site located at amino acid 98 within the PRH amino acid sequence and the unique BamHI site in the vector pAS2-1. pGAD424-TLE1 contains the full-length TLE1 coding sequence and expresses a GAL4-TLE1 fusion protein. pGAD424-TLE1Q-SP and pGAD424-TLE1WD contain the Q (amino acids 1–135), Q-SP (amino acids 1–435), and WD (amino acids 444–770) domains of TLE1, respectively. These plasmids have all been described previously (31Grbavec D. Lo R. Liu Y. Stifani S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 43Grbavec D. Lo R. Liu Y. Greenfield A. Stifani S. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—The two-hybrid assay (44Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar) was carried out in yeast strain MaV203 (Clontech). The two-hybrid assay and β-galactosidase assays in liquid culture were performed as described by Fields and Song (44Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar) and the Clontech manual. Colony lift assays were performed by transferring yeast colonies onto 3MM filter paper. The yeast were then lysed by rapidly freeze thawing in liquid nitrogen and then placed on filter paper saturated with Z-buffer (60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2,50 mm β-mercaptoethanol) containing X-gal indicator (0.32 mg/ml). The blue color for each transformant was compared after incubation of the filter at 37 °C for 3 h. Mutagenesis—The QuikChange kit (Stratagene) was used for the mutagenesis of pMUG1-MycPRH to PRH F32E and was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting mutant was fully sequenced to confirm the sequence change. Expression and Purification of Tagged PRH Proteins—The human and avian GST-PRH fusion proteins were expressed in BL21 pLysS cells (Novagen). Fusion protein expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were harvested and lysed by incubation with 100 μl of lysozyme (1 mg/ml) for 20 min followed by sonication in PBS plus 1% Triton X-100. GST-PRHN fusion proteins were purified over glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Aliquots of these proteins were eluted with 10 mm glutathione and assayed for purity by SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Blue. Proteins were quantified using the Bio-Rad phosphoric acid protein assay. In Vitro Binding Assays—The plasmid used for the in vitro transcription and translation of TLE1, pcDNA3-TLE1, has been described previously (27Levanon D. Goldstein R.E. Bernstein Y. Tang H. Goldenberg D. Stifani S. Paroush Z. Groner Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11590-11595Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 43Grbavec D. Lo R. Liu Y. Greenfield A. Stifani S. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Transcription and translation was carried out using a TNT kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Approximately 20 μg of each of the GST fusion proteins or an equimolar amount of GST protein as judged by Coomassie staining was bound to 50 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To assay for specific interactions, 10 μl of [35S]methionine-labeled in vitro translated protein was added and incubated in binding buffer (20 mm Hepes pH 7.8, 200 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 ng/μl bovine serum albumin) with gentle agitation for 60 min at 4 °C. The beads were then washed six times with 1 ml of binding buffer. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling the beads in protein sample buffer containing 1% SDS and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Pull-downs and Western Blotting—Whole cell extract from 2 × 108 K562 cells was made as follows. The cell pellet was washed in PBS twice and then resuspended in 1 ml of high salt lysis buffer (500 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% Nonidet P-40). The cell suspension was drawn up and down six times with a 3× Monojet needle (1.1 × 50 mm, 19 gauge 2 inches) and then incubated on ice for 5 min. The extract was centrifuged at maximum speed for 5 min at 4 °C in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge. Whole cell extract was added to ∼10 μg of GST-HPRHN protein or 10 μg of GST protein bound to glutathione resin. After 2 h at 4 °C with tumbling, the resin was collected by centrifugation in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge, washed three times in 1 ml of wash buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% Nonidet P-40), and then resuspended in 50 μl of 2× SDS loading buffer. All operations were carried out at 4 °C and in the presence of protease inhibitors. After SDS-PAGE, the proteins were immunoblotted onto Immobilon-P membrane (Sigma). TLE proteins were detected using a rat monoclonal pan TLE antibody raised against the conserved carboxyl-terminal WD40 domain of Groucho/TLEs (25Dehni G. Liu Y. Husain J. Stifani S. Mech. Dev. 1995; 53: 369-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 45Stifani S. Blaumueller C.M. Redhead N.J. Hill R.E. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Nat. Genet. 1992; 2: 343Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) and an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). HC8 was detected with a mouse monoclonal antibody (Affiniti). Immunofluorescence—K562 cells were grown to a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml. 10 ml of cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 1 ml of PBS. Glass slides were coated with poly-l-lysine (Sigma) for 10 min at 20 °C and then washed with water. The washed K562 cells were incubated on the coated slide for 10 min at 20 °C and then washed in PBS. The cells were fixed in paraformaldehyde for 30 min and then rinsed twice in PBS and permeabilized by incubation in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. The cells were then rinsed with PBS and incubated with PBSA (3% bovine serum albumin in PBS) for 20 min to block nonspecific antibody binding. After rinsing in PBS, antibody staining was performed with a 1:10 dilution of a rat monoclonal pan-TLE antibody and a 1:10 dilution of a mouse polyclonal anti-PRH antibody for 1 h at 20 °C. The cells were rinsed in PBS twice and in PBSA twice and then incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h at 20 °C. PRH was detected with a TRITC donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody (Stratec) that had been preadsorbed for immunoreactivity against rat antibodies. MycPRH was detected with a monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). TLE was detected with a 1:100 dilution of a biotinylated rabbit anti-rat secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories Inc.) and a 1:100 dilution of a fluorescein-labeled goat anti-Biotin tertiary antibody (Vector Laboratories). Immunostained cells were viewed on a Leica DM IRBE confocal microscope and imaging performed using Leica confocal software version 2.00. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection Assays—K562 cells were grown in glutamine-added Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum to a density of ∼1 × 106 cells/ml. The cells were then collected by centrifugation and then resuspended in medium plus 10% fetal calf serum to a density of 5 × 107 cells/ml. 5 μg of the luciferase reporter plasmid with 5 μg of the β-galactosidase reporter plasmid and the amount of expression plasmids indicated under “Results” were electroporated into 1 × 107 cells using a Bio-Rad Genepulser (200 V, 975 microfarads). The cells were rested for 10 min and then incubated overnight in 10 ml of supplemented medium. After 24 h the cells were harvested, and luciferase activity was assayed using the Promega luciferase assay system according to the manufacturer's instructions. β-Galactosidase assays were performed as an internal control for transfection efficiency. After subtraction of the background, the luciferase counts were normalized against the β-galactosidase value. Co-immunoprecipitation Assays—K562 cells (2 × 107) were co-transfected with 2 μg of pMUG1-MycPRH and either 2 μg of pCMV2-FLAGTLE1 or 2 μg of pCMV-FLAG-Grg5 as described above. Five transfections were pooled (1 × 108 cells) to make the nuclear extract for each co-immunoprecipitation. Nuclear extracts were made by the method of Dignam et al. (46Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar) with modifications described by Dorn et al. (47Dorn A. Benoist C. Mathis D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 312-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were incubated with 4 μl of a monoclonal anti-Myc9E10 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 30 min at 4 °C. 100 μl of a 50% slurry of Protein G beads (Sigma) was then incubated with the nuclear extracts for a further 90 min at 4 °C. After this time, the resin was collected by centrifugation in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge (13,000 rpm for 1 min), washed three times in 1 ml of wash buffer B (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.2% Nonidet P-40), and then resuspended in 50 μl of 2× SDS loading buffer. All operations were carried out at 4 °C and in the presence of protease inhibitors. After SDS-PAGE, the proteins were immunoblotted onto Immobilon-P membrane, and TLE and Grg5 proteins were detected using anti-FLAG antibodies (Sigma). Approximately 10% of the nuclear extract (200 μg of protein) was used for Western blotting experiments as described above. PRH and TLE1 Interact in Yeast—PRH contains two motifs that could be involved in an interaction with TLE proteins. Amino acids 30–39 (TPFYIEDILG) contain a sequence that matches the Eh-1 motif (FXIXXIL) identified originally in the Drosophila homeodomain proteins Engrailed and Goosecoid and shown to mediate the interaction of both these proteins with Groucho (48Tolkunova E.N.

https://openalex.org/W2134741924,"A serine proteinase cascade in insect hemolymph mediates prophenoloxidase activation, a defense mechanism against pathogen or parasite infection. Little is known regarding its initiating proteinase or how this enzyme is activated in response to invading microorganisms. We have isolated from the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, a cDNA encoding a modular protein designated hemolymph proteinase 14 (HP14). It contains five low density lipoprotein receptor class A repeats, a Sushi domain, a unique Cys-rich region, and a proteinase-catalytic domain. The HP14 mRNA exists in fat body and hemocytes of the naive larvae, and its level increases significantly at 24 h after a bacterial challenge. We expressed proHP14 with a carboxyl-terminal hexahistidine tag in a baculovirus/insect cell system and detected the recombinant protein in two forms. The 87-kDa protein was primarily intracellular, whereas the 75-kDa form was present in the medium. Interaction with peptidoglycan resulted in proteolytic processing of the purified zymogen and generation of an amidase activity. Supplementation of hemolymph with proHP14 greatly enhanced prophenoloxidase activation in response to Micrococcus luteus. These data suggest that proHP14 is a pattern recognition protein that binds to bacteria and autoactivates and triggers the prophenoloxidase activation system in the hemolymph of M. sexta.

These data suggest that proHP14 is a pattern recognition protein that binds to bacteria and autoactivates and triggers the prophenoloxidase activation system in the hemolymph of M. sexta. Similar to other invertebrates, insects lack an adaptive immune system and rely solely on their innate immune mechanisms to fight against invading microorganisms (1Gillespie J.P. Kanost M.R. Trenczek T. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1997; 42: 611-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar, 2Lavine M.D. Strand M.R. Insect Biochem. Mol.

These defense mechanisms are mediated by hemocytes (e.g. phagocytosis and encapsulation), fat body (e.g. induced synthesis of antimicrobial peptides), and plasma factors (e.g. hemolymph coagulation and melanization). Accumulating evidence indicates that a complex serine proteinase network in insect hemolymph coordinates some of these responses (4Jiang H. Kanost M.R. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 30: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The prophenoloxidase (proPO) 1The abbreviations used are: proPO and PO, prophenoloxidase and phenoloxidase, respectively; PRP, pattern recognition protein; HP14 and proHP14, M. sexta hemolymph proteinase 14 and its proenzyme; LDLr, low density lipoprotein receptor; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight. 1The abbreviations used are: proPO and PO, prophenoloxidase and phenoloxidase, respectively; PRP, pattern recognition protein; HP14 and proHP14, M. sexta hemolymph proteinase 14 and its proenzyme; LDLr, low density lipoprotein receptor; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight. activation cascade is probably composed of several serine proteinases that are sequentially activated in response to microbial infection and lead to the proteolytic activation of proPO to phenoloxidase (PO). PO catalyzes the formation of quinones that are reactive intermediates for melanin synthesis (5Ashida M. Brey P.T. Brey P.T. Hultmark D. Molecular Mechanisms of Immune Responses in Insects. Chapman & Hall, London1998: 135-172Google Scholar, 6Nappi A.J. Vass E. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2001; 484: 329-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Quinones are also involved in cuticle sclerotization, wound healing, and sequestration of parasites or pathogens.Although the physiological importance of the proPO activation in insect immune system has been appreciated for many years, the molecular characterization of the cascade components was reported only recently. We isolated three proPO-activating proteinases from cuticular extract or hemolymph of M. sexta prepupae, and they all required a protein cofactor for proPO activation (7Jiang H. Wang Y. Kanost M.R.

Similar results were obtained from the beetles Holotrichia diomphalia and Tenebrio molitor (11Lee S.Y. Kwon T.H. Hyun J.H. Choi J.S. Kawabata S. Iwanaga S. Lee B.L. Eur. J.

In contrast, the silkworm proPO-activating enzyme does not appear to need any auxiliary factor for proPO activation (14Satoh D. Horii A. Ochiai M. Ashida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7441-7453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Limited by substrate availability, current biochemical research is focused on the components at the end of this pathway and little is known regarding its initiating enzyme.Prophenoloxidase activation is triggered by recognition of conserved molecular patterns on the surface of microorganisms such as peptidoglycan, lipopolysaccharide, lipoteichoic acid, and glucans (4Jiang H. Kanost M.R. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 30: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 5Ashida M. Brey P.T. Brey P.T. Hultmark D. Molecular Mechanisms of Immune Responses in Insects.

Several groups of pattern recognition proteins (PRPs) isolated from insect hemolymph bind to such microbial cell wall components and stimulate proPO activation (16Yu X.-Q. Zhu Y. Ma C. Fabrick J.A. Kanost M.R. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 32: 1287-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). These include peptidoglycan-binding proteins, glucanase-like proteins, and C-type lectins. Unlike horseshoe crab coagulation factor C or G (17Iwanaga S. Kawabata S. Muta T. J. Biochem. 1998; 123: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), insect PRPs known so far do not contain a proteinase domain. The lectin-mediated pathway for complement activation in mammals demonstrates that association of a PRP (mannose-binding protein) and a proteinase (mannose-binding protein-associated serine proteinase) can trigger a serine proteinase cascade (18Fujita T. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 346-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). However, it has never been established whether this mode of pathway initiation applies for the proPO activation system in any insects.To elucidate the proPO activation system in M. sexta, we have isolated over twenty serine proteinase cDNAs from the fat body and hemocytes. We report in this paper the molecular cloning and characterization of M. sexta HP14, a pattern recognition serine proteinase. This protein consists of several regulatory domains and a proteinase-catalytic domain. Its synthesis is induced upon bacterial challenge. The purified HP14 zymogen interacts with peptidoglycan to become active. We also provide evidence suggesting that it is an initiating proteinase for the proPO activation system in M. sexta.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESInsect Rearing and Induction—M. sexta eggs were originally purchased from Carolina Biological Supplies, and larvae were reared on an artificial diet (19Dunn P. Drake D. J. Invertebr. Pathol. 1983; 41: 77-85Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Fifth Instar day 2 larvae were injected with 2 × 108Escherichia coli cells suspended in 100 μl of Sf900-II serum-free medium (BD Biosciences). Hemolymph samples were collected at 24 h after the bacterial challenge.cDNA Isolation and Sequencing—λ-Phage DNA samples (0.1 μg) from cDNA libraries of hemocyte and fat body from naive and bacteria-induced M. sexta larvae were used as templates in separate polymerase chain reactions to amplify serine proteinase cDNA fragments. The degenerate primers were designed based on conserved regions in the chymotrypsin family of serine proteinases: TAAHC (j659, 5′-GTA TCG ATA CVG CSG CNC AYT G-3′) and GDSGGP (j601, 5′-ATC AAC GTT GGR CCR CCR GAR TCN CC-3′). The thermal cycling conditions were 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s; 50 °C for 40 s; and 72 °C, 40 s followed by incubation at 72 °C for 5 min. After agarose gel electrophoresis, DNA products between 400 and 600 bp were recovered and cloned into pGem-T vector (Promega). The resulting transformants were randomly picked for plasmid preparation, restriction digestion, and sequence analysis. Once confirmed to encode unknown serine proteinases, the cDNA fragments were recovered and used as probes for isolating corresponding full-length clones from the cDNA libraries. Complete nucleotide sequences of the HP14 cDNA inserts were determined using BigDye Terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit (PE Applied Biosystems) and oligonucleotide primers designed from known sequences. Sequence assembly and data base searching were performed using MacVector 6.5 (Genetics Computer Group). Domain organization and comparison were carried out using reverse position-specific-BLAST and CDART (the conserved domain architecture retrieval tool) at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov (20Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59182) Google Scholar).Antiserum Preparation and Immunoblotting—The cDNA fragment encoding the mature proHP14 was amplified by PCR using the longest cDNA clone as a template. Primer j494 (5′-CCC CCATGG CAG TGT TGA AAG-3′) corresponds to nucleotides 169–190 of the cDNA, and primer j480 (5′-CGT CCA TTT TCG AGC TAG-3′) is the reverse complement of nucleotides 2531–2548 in the 3′-noncoding region. The PCR product was digested with NcoI and nondirectionally cloned into the same site in H6pQE60 (21Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 146-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). After the orientation and sequence of the inserted cDNA were verified, the resulting plasmid was used for producing recombinant proHP14 in E. coli. A rabbit polyclonal antiserum was prepared against the protein purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography and preparative SDS-PAGE (22Ji C. Wang Y. Ross J. Jiang H. Protein Express. Purif. 2003; 29: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis was carried out using HP14 antiserum (1:1000 diluted in Tris-buffered saline containing 1% nonfat dry milk, 0.1% Spodoptera frugiperda Sf21 cell lysate, and 0.1% E. coli lysate) as the first antibody.Expression Analysis by Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—Fat body and hemocyte total RNA samples of both naive and bacteria-induced M. sexta larvae were prepared (23Wang Y. Willott E. Kanost M.R. Insect Mol. Biol. 1995; 4: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using 2–4 μg of total RNA, 10 pmol of oligo(dT)17, and 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 1 h. The M. sexta ribosomal protein S3 cDNA was used as an internal standard to adjust the template amounts in a preliminary PCR experiment. Relative levels of HP14 cDNA in the normalized DNA pools were determined in a duplex PCR using j481 (5′-TCC GGC CAG TAT GTT TG-3′) and j480 (5′-CGT CCA TTT TCG AGC TAG-3′) for HP14 and k504 (5′-CGC GAG TTG ACT TCG GT-3′) and k501 (5′ GCC GTT CTT GCC CTG TT 3′) for ribosomal protein S3. The thermal cycling conditions were 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 45 s. The PCR products were subjected to electrophoretic analysis on a 1.5% agarose gel.Production of ProHP14 in a Baculovirus System—For the expression of HP14 zymogen, a recombinant baculovirus was constructed using the Bac-to-Bac system (Invitrogen). The HP14 cDNA was first amplified by PCR using Advantage cDNA polymerase mixture (BD Biosciences) and the following primer pair: j517 (5′-ATT GAATTC CAA TGT GTA CGG A-3′) and j503 (5′-ACT CTCGAG ATA CTC GTC GGT CCA-3′), which correspond to nucleotides 116–137 and 2110–2133 (reverse complement), respectively. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and XhoI, separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and inserted to the same sites in the vector pFH6 (22Ji C. Wang Y. Ross J. Jiang H. Protein Express. Purif. 2003; 29: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) to generate proHP14/pFH6. The resulting plasmid was examined by sequence analysis to confirm the correct junctions. Generation of the recombinant virus and optimization of expression conditions were performed as described previously (22Ji C. Wang Y. Ross J. Jiang H. Protein Express. Purif. 2003; 29: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Sf21 cells (2 × 106cells/ml) in 1000 ml of Sf900-II serum-free medium were infected with the recombinant baculovirus stock at a multiplicity of infection of 5–10 and grown at 27 °C for 96 h with gentle agitation. The recombinant proHP14 in the conditioned medium was enriched by ammonium sulfate precipitation at 50% saturation and then purified by nickel affinity chromatography. The protein precipitate collected by centrifugation was dissolved in 100 ml of sterilized endotoxin-free buffer A (pH 7.8, 50 mm sodium phosphate, 0.3 m NaCl, and 1 mm benzamidine) and incubated with 5.0 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) for 30 min on ice with gentle agitation. The suspension was packed into a column, and the resin was then washed with buffer A containing 20 mm imidazole. The bound proHP14 was eluted with 200 mm imidazole in the same buffer. Prior to functional analysis experiments, the purified protein was passed through a Sephadex G25 gelfiltration column equilibrated with pH 7.5, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, and 2 mm MgCl2 to remove benzamidine.Peptide Mass Fingerprint Analysis—The purified recombinant proHP14 (0.5 μg) was separated by SDS-PAGE under the reducing condition. After Coomassie Blue staining, the bands of interest were excised from the gel and washed with 50% acetonitrile and 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, to remove the stain. The gel slices were dehydrated in 100% acetonitrile, dried in a SpeedVac, and incubated with sequencing-grade trypsin (20 μl, 10 ng/μl) at 37 °C for 20 h. Peptides extracted from the gel twice with 30 μl of 50% acetonitrile and 5% trifluoroacetic acid were dried to near-completion. The samples were mixed 1:1 (v/v) with saturated α-cyano-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid, spotted onto a plate for MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, and analyzed using a positive-ion reflector mode and external peptide standards. Calculated masses of the trypsinolytic peptides of HP14 were compared with those of observed monoisotopic peaks to locate their positions in the protein sequence.Effect of Peptidoglycan on ProHP14 Activation—Peptidoglycan from Staphylococcus aureus (Sigma) was reacted with 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride overnight at room temperature, heated for 1 h at 95 °C, and thoroughly washed with H2O. Peptidyl-p-nitroanilides were used as amidase substrates to confirm that the treated peptidoglycan did not contain any active proteinase. Purified proHP14 (4 ng/μl, 10 μl) and CaC12 (100 mm, 1 μl) were incubated with 1 μl of peptidoglycan (1 μg/μl) at 37 °C for different periods of time. The reaction mixtures were then treated with SDS sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol, separated by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by silver staining or immunoblotting with HP14 antibodies. For detecting possible amidase activity, the recombinant proHP14 (40 μl, 4 ng/μl in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mm NaCl, pH 7.8) was mixed with peptidoglycan (1 μl, 10 μg/μl), CaCl2 (5 μl, 100 mm), Tween 20 (1 μl, 0.1%), and bovine serum albumin (1 μl, 10 μg/μl). The negative controls of proHP14 (40 μl) and peptidoglycan (1 μl) were individually mixed with the same amounts of CaCl2, Tween 20, and bovine serum albumin. Volumes of the mixtures were adjusted to 50 μl using 20 mm Tris-HCl and 20 mm NaCl, pH 7.8. After incubation at 37 °C for varying amounts of time, amidase activity was assayed using 150 μl of 100 μmN-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Leu-p-nitroanilide (Sigma) in 0.1 m Tris-HCl and 0.1 m NaCl, pH 7.5. Absorbance at 405 nm was monitored continuously using a microplate reader (Molecular Devices), and 1 unit of activity is tentatively defined as ΔA405/min = 0.001.Role of ProHP14 in ProPO Activation—Purified proHP14 (0.1 mg/ml, 10 μl) was mixed with M. luteus (1 × 109 cells/ml, 10 μl) and induced hemolymph (2 μl), diluted to 100 μl with 0.1 m Tris-HCl, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.2, and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. An aliquot of the reaction mixture (10 μl) then was incubated with purified proPO (10 μg/ml, 10 μl) in a microplate well at room temperature for 1 h. As negative controls, one or two of the reaction components, M. luteus, proHP14, and induced hemolymph, were treated similarly. After the activation reactions, PO activity was assayed using dopamine as a substrate (8Jiang H. Wang Y. Yu X.-Q. Kanost M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3552-3561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar).RESULTSTo explore a putative immune signaling system in M. sexta hemolymph, we have isolated serine proteinase cDNA clones from fat body and hemocytes. The longest one encompasses a 4989-nucleotide cDNA with a complete open reading frame spanning nucleotides 127–2124 (Fig. 1). The 3′-noncoding region is unusually long (2.9 kb) and does not end with a poly(A) tail. The deduced amino acid sequence contains 666 residues including a predicted 17-residue signal peptide. The mature protein, designated HP14, has a calculated mass of 71,769 Da. A typical chymotrypsin-like serine proteinase domain (residues 388–666) is located at the carboxyl terminus of the polypeptide including the conserved His-Asp-Ser-catalytic triad. Based on a sequence comparison with other serine proteinases, 2H. Jiang, Y. Wang, Y. Gu, X. Guo, F. Scholz, Z. Zou, T. Trenczek, and M. Kanost, unpublished data. Gly585, Ala616, and Thr630 may be important constituents of the primary substrate binding pocket that could accommodate bulky hydrophobic residues such as Phe or Leu. Leu387, the residue preceding the predicted cleavage activation site, fits well with the predicted specificity, suggesting that HP14 could be an enzyme that activates by autoproteolysis. There are eight potential N-linked glycosylation sites (Asn-X-(Thr/Ser)) in the sequence, three of which appeared to be unmodified in the trypsinolytic peptide mass fingerprint analysis.HP14 is a mosaic protein consisting of several putative regulatory domains. Five LDLr class A repeats are found at the amino terminus. Four of them are characterized by positional conservation of six cysteine residues and a highly conserved cluster of negatively charged residues. Three disulfide bonds are expected to form between Cys1 and Cys3, Cys2 and Cys5, and Cys4 and Cys6. The fourth LDLr class A repeat is atypical. It lacks Cys1 and Cys3, even though other structural features are well conserved. Three RXR motifs were identified in the interdomain regions of the first four repeats. This arginine-rich segment is essential for high affinity bacterial binding by a macrophage scavenger receptor (24Brannstrom A. Sankala M. Tryggvason K. Pikkarainen T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 1462-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Following the LDLr class A repeats is a Sushi domain, which contains the conserved cysteine residues and other essential residues. Between the Sushi and serine proteinase-catalytic domains lies another Cys-rich region. It contains seven cysteine residues, which could form a separate domain stabilized by three disulfide bonds. The remaining cysteine residue may be linked to a cysteine residue (Cys510) in the catalytic domain.The BLAST searches indicated that M. sexta HP14 is orthologous to two other insect serine proteinases, AgCP12488 from the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae and AY118964 from the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster. Their domain organization is nearly identical to that of HP14 with the only difference occurring at the amino terminus where the two dipteran proteins contain 4 instead of 5 LDLr class A repeats (Fig. 2). Using reverse position-specific-BLAST and CDART, we identified all of the Sushi domain serine proteinases in GenBank, most of which are initiating enzymes of their corresponding proteinase cascades. These include complements C1r and C1s, mannose-binding protein-associated serine proteinase-1 and -2, and horseshoe crab-clotting factor C (17Iwanaga S. Kawabata S. Muta T. J. Biochem. 1998; 123: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 18Fujita T. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 346-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar).Fig. 2Domain organization of M. sexta HP14 and other Sushi domain serine proteinases. HP14 is orthologous to A. gambiae AgCP12488 and D. melanogaster DmAY118964. The 7C region between the Sushi and proteinase domains contains seven cysteine residues, one of which may link to the catalytic domain via a disulfide bridge. LDLa, LDLr class A repeat; Tryp-SPc, trypsin-like serine proteinase catalytic domain; EGF-Ca, Ca2+-binding epidermal growth factor domain; CLECT, C-type lectin domain; MASP, mannose-binding protein-associated serine proteinase; vWA, von Willebrand factor type A domain. CUB domain was initially identified in complement 1r/s, Uegf, and Bmp1, whereas LCCL stands for a conserved region first found in limulus factor C, Coch-5b2, and Lgl.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We examined the transcriptional regulation of proHP14 in response to a bacterial challenge (Fig. 3). An expected 0.85-kb reverse transcriptase-PCR fragment was amplified from fat body and hemocytes of the naive larvae. The HP14 mRNA level became more abundant in fat body at 24 h after bacterial injection. A marked induction was also observed in the hemocytes, although the transcript level was still much lower than that in induced fat body. Based on relative band intensity, the PCR product from induced hemocytes after 25 cycles was ∼20% of that from induced fat body after 20 cycles of amplification. This indicates that proHP14 is an immune-responsive protein mainly synthesized in fat body. Immunoblot analysis using HP14-specific antibodies revealed a protein doublet in the hemolymph whose level also increased significantly after a bacterial injection.Fig. 3Induced expression of HP14 in M. sexta larvae after bacterial injection. Fifth Instar day 2 larvae were injected with 10 μl of H2O or M. luteus cells (10 μl, 10 μg/μl). A, hemocytes (lanes 1 and 2) and fat body (lanes 3 and 4) were collected from the treated larvae 24 h later. Total RNA samples from the control (lanes 1 and 3) or bacteria-challenged insects (lanes 2 and 4) were isolated for reverse transcriptase-PCR and gel electrophoretic analysis. The M. sexta ribosomal protein S3 (rpS3) was used as an internal standard to normalize the templates. Lanes 1 and 2, 25 cycles; lanes 3 and 4, 20 cycles. B, hemolymph samples (1 μl/lane) from control (C) and induced (I) larvae were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis using HP14 antibodies. Due to hemolymph storage proteins (80 kDa, highly abundant), the 75-kDa proHP14 in the hemolymph migrated to a lower position. M, molecular weight standards.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To elucidate the function of HP14 during immune responses, we expressed the protein in its precursor form in a baculovirus/insect cell system. Two forms of recombinant proHP14 were present in the conditioned medium. The predominant one has an apparent Mr of 75,000 (Fig. 4). The other form is nearly identical in electrophoretic mobility to the intracellular proHP14 (87 kDa). Nickel-affinity chromatography removed the other proteins in the medium, but we have not yet been able to further separate the two forms of proHP14 by other methods without a loss of its biological activity. To characterize them, the corresponding protein bands were excised from an SDS-PAGE gel and digested with trypsin, and their peptide mass fingerprints were compared by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. 24 of the 46 predicted trypsinolytic fragments from the mature protein were apparent on the mass spectra. The recombinant proenzymes contained the hexahistidine tag at the carboxyl terminus. The trypsinolytic fragment closest to the amino terminus corresponds to residues 34–58 in the 87-kDa proHP14 (Fig. 1). The 75-kDa proHP14 was truncated at the amino terminus, and it started before or at residue 68. We failed to get molecular weights from the purified protein sample by MALDI mass spectrometry, and neither did the Edman degradation yield any amino-terminal sequence from the 87- or 75-kDa bands.Fig. 4SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analysis of M. sexta proHP14 from a baculovirus-infected cell culture. The recombinant proHP14 purified from medium (lane 1, 0.1 μg) and cell lysate (lane 2, 0.2 μg) was subjected to electrophoresis on a 10% polyacrylamide gel followed by silver staining. The size and position of the molecular weight markers (lane M) are indicated on the left. The apparent molecular weights of the two forms of proHP14 are marked on the right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To investigate whether a pathogen-associated molecular pattern could trigger the autoprocessing of proHP14, we incubated the purified protein with peptidoglycan and examined the reaction mixtures by immunoblot analysis. Several new bands with lower molecular weights appeared in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 5). We also detected the appearance of an amidase activity using a chromogenic substrate, AAPLpNA (N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Leu-p-nitroanilide). This activity was absent in the control of peptidoglycan or proHP14. It considerably increased in the beginning, peaked at 30 min, and then gradually decreased. In addition, because we detected the amidase only in the insoluble fraction, proHP14 and active HP14 probably had associated with peptidoglycan. No processing or appearance of activity occurred when proHP14 was incubated with the other pathogen-associated molecular patterns tested. 3C. Ji and H. Jiang, unpublished data. Fig. 5Proteolytic processing of M. sexta proHP14 after exposure to peptidoglycan.A, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” purified recombinant proHP14 (40 ng) was incubated with peptidoglycan (1 μg) at 37 °C for 0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min. The reaction mixtures and peptidoglycan (–control) were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining (left panel) or immunoblot analysis (right panel). The size and position of the Mr markers are indicated on the right. B, in similar reactions, peptidoglycan, proHP14, or both were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and amidase activity in the samples was measured using AAPLpNA as a substrate and plotted in the bar graph (left panel). The time course of proHP14 activation and distribution of HP14 activity were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After incubation and centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 s, the amidase activity in 40 μl of supernatants (□ - - - □) and 10 μl of peptidoglycan suspensions (• ——— •) was measured and plotted (right panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We examined a possible role of HP14 during proPO activation in the induced hemolymph (Fig. 6).

To gain a better understanding of the mechanism regulating the activation of PKD in response to GPCR stimulation, we investigated the role of its rapid plasma membrane translocation on its activation loop phosphorylation and identified the endogenous PKC isozyme that mediates that event in vivo. We had found that the activation loop of a PKD mutant, with reduced affinity for diacylglycerol and phorbol esters, was only phosphorylated upon its plasma membrane association. We also found that the activation loop phosphorylation and rapid plasma membrane dissociation of PKD were inhibited either by preventing the plasma membrane translocation of PKCϵ, through abolition of its interaction with receptor for activated C kinase, or by suppressing the expression of PKCϵ via specific small interfering RNAs. Thus, this study demonstrates that the plasma membrane translocation of PKD, in response to GPCR stimulation, is necessary for the PKCϵ-mediated phosphorylation of the activation loop of PKD and that this event requires the translocation of both kinases to the plasma membrane. Based on these and previous results, we propose a model of GPCR-mediated PKD regulation that integrates its changes in distribution, catalytic activity, and multisite phosphorylation.

There are multiple related PKC isozymes, i.e. the conventional PKCs (α, βI, βII, and γ), which are regulated by Ca2+, diacylglycerol (DAG), and phospholipids; the novel PKCs (δ, ϵ, η, and θ), which are regulated by DAG and phospholipids; and the atypical PKCs (ζ and λ), which have been proposed to be regulated by D-3 phosphoinositide (2Newton A.C.

In unstimulated cells, PKD has been localized to the cytosol and to several intracellular compartments including Golgi and mitochondria (48Storz P. Hausser A. Link G. Dedio J. Ghebrehiwet B.

Upon GPCR stimulation, PKD is phosphorylated at Ser-744 and Ser-748 within its activation loop by a mechanism that requires PKC activity and coincides with its reversible translocation from the cytosol to the plasma membrane (21Waldron R.T. Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9224-9230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 26Waldron R.T. Rey O. Iglesias T. Tugal T. Cantrell D. Rozengurt E. J.

Physiol. 2003; 196: 483-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, whether the translocation of PKD from the cytosol to the plasma membrane in response to GPCR stimulation is a prerequisite for its PKC-mediated phosphorylation is unknown. Furthermore, no data are available identifying endogenous PKC isozymes that mediate the activation loop phosphorylation of PKD in vivo. The experiments presented here were designed to determine whether the plasma membrane translocation of PKD is necessary for its activation loop phosphorylation in response to GPCR stimulation and to identify the endogenous PKC that mediates that phosphorylation in vivo. We had found that the activation loop of a PKD with a single point mutation that reduced its affinity for DAG/phorbol esters was only phosphorylated upon its plasma membrane association. We also found that the activation loop phosphorylation and rapid plasma membrane dissociation of PKD were inhibited either by preventing the plasma membrane translocation of PKCϵ, through abolition of the RACK interaction, or by down-regulating the expression of PKCϵ via small interfering RNA (siRNA). In addition, this study shows that the activation loop phosphorylation and rapid plasma membrane dissociation of PKD2, in response to GPCR activation, could be blocked by the PKCϵ RACK pseudosubstrate. Thus, this study elucidates two key events in the GPCR-mediated activation of PKD: (a) the translocation of PKD to the plasma membrane is a prerequisite for its activation loop phosphorylation, and (b) in vivo PKCϵ mediates that phosphorylation when it translocates to the plasma membrane. Based on these and previous results, we propose a model of PKD regulation, in response to GPCR stimulation, that integrates the dynamic distribution of PKD with the changes in its catalytic activity and activation loop phosphorylation. Cell Culture and Transfections—Stock cultures of Swiss 3T3 were maintained at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified atmosphere containing 10% CO2 and 90% air. For immunocytochemistry, the cells were plated in 33-mm dishes at 8 × 104 cells/dish and transfected with 1 μg of DNA/33-mm dish using LipofectAMINE PLUS (Invitrogen) according to the conditions suggested by the manufacturer. Transfected cells were incubated for 18–20 h before analysis, a time we that previously found optimal to detect very low levels of fluorescent-tagged protein expression (50Rey O. Rozengurt E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). For experimental purposes, the cells were allowed to grow until they became confluent and quiescent (6–7 days). The Swiss 3T3-PKD2.GFP cell line was established utilizing the same strategy used to generate Swiss 3T3-PKD.GFP cells (53Zhukova E. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40298-40305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Briefly, Swiss 3T3 cells were transduced with a retrovirus encoding PKD2 and green fluorescent protein (GFP) as two separate proteins under the control of a single promoter. Cells were collected and sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting to select the GFP-positive ones. The GFP-positive cells were propagated and multiple aliquots frozen. The PKD2 protein overexpressed in Swiss 3T3-PKD2.GFP retains, in response to bombesin stimulation, PKC-dependent regulation by multisite phosphorylation, resulting in enhanced kinase catalytic activity like endogenous PKD2 (data not shown). A fresh batch of cells was restarted every 2 months. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified atmosphere containing 10% CO2 and 90% air. cDNA Constructs—The vectors encoding the fusion proteins between the GFP and wild type or mutant PKD (pGFP-PKD, pGFP-PKD.P287G) have been described previously (51Rey O. Young S.H. Cantrell D. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32616-32626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 54Matthews S. Iglesias T. Cantrell D. Rozengurt E.

Commun. 2003; 302: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Indirect Immunofluorescence—Indirect immunofluorescence was performed in 10% buffered formalin phosphate-fixed/0.3% Triton X-100-PBS-permeabilized cultures. After extensive PBS washing, fixed cells were incubated for 18 h at 25 °C in blocking buffer (PBS, 1% gelatin, 0.05% Tween 20) and then stained at 25 °C for 60 min with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against PKCβII, PKCζ, or PKCϵ. After several PBS plus 0.05% Tween 20 washes, the samples were incubated with anti-rabbit Texas Red-conjugated antibodies at 25 °C for 60 min, washed, and subsequently mounted with a gelvatol-glycerol solution containing 2.5% 1,4-diazobicyclo[2.2.2]octane (51Rey O. Young S.H. Cantrell D. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32616-32626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The samples were examined with an epifluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axioskop, Carl Zeiss Inc., Jena, Germany) and a Zeiss oil immersion objective (Plan-Apochromat 40X/1.0, Carl Zeiss Inc.). Images were captured as uncompressed 24-bit TIFF files with a SPOT cooled (–12 °C) single CCD color digital camera (three pass method) driven by SPOT version 2.1 software (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc., Sterling Heights, MI). GFP and Texas Red signals were observed with HI Q filter from Chroma Technology (Brattleboro, VT). The selected cells displayed in the appropriate figures were representative of 70% of the population of positive cells. The obtained results are representative of at least three independent experiments. Live Cell Imaging—To maintain a constant selected temperature during the experimental procedures, cells grown on the 15-mm glass coverslips and subsequently mounted in a perfusion chamber (RC-25, Warner Instrument Corp., Hamden, CT) were perfused with medium warmed to 37 °C by a SH-27B in-line solution heater (Warner Instrument Corp.). The medium was supplemented with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2. The perfusion chamber was mounted on an epifluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axioskop, Carl Zeiss Inc.) and cell images captured as previously described (18Rey O. Yuan J. Young S.H. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23773-23785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Thirty cells were analyzed per experiment, and each experiment was performed twice. The selected cells displayed in the appropriate figures were representative of 80% of the population of GFP-positive cells. Western Blot Analysis—Samples of cell lysates were directly solubilized by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Following SDS-PAGE on 10% gels, proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) and blocked by overnight incubation with 5% nonfat dried milk in PBS, pH 7.2. Membranes were incubated at room temperature for 3 h with the primary antiserum diluted in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG and enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). The obtained results are representative of three independent experiments. Cell Fractionation—Cytosolic and membrane fractions of Swiss 3T3 cells were prepared according to the method of McKenzie, as previously described (51Rey O. Young S.H. Cantrell D. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32616-32626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were resuspended in ice-cold 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5 (TE buffer), containing protease inhibitors (leupeptin (10 μg/ml) and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (5 mm)) and homogenized by 20 strokes in a glass Potter-Elvehjem type homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 500 × g for 15 min to pellet nuclei and unbroken cells, leaving a membrane-containing supernatant. Membranes were collected by centrifugation of the supernatant for 30 min at 40,000 × g. The plasma membrane-containing pellet was washed with TE buffer and re-centrifuged for 30 min at 40,000 × g. Proteins in the resulting supernatant fractions were pooled and precipitated with ice-cold acetone. Pellets corresponding to the cytosolic and plasma membrane fraction were resuspended in 2× SDS-PAGE and subsequently analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Materials—Murine monoclonal anti-tubulin and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. PKCβII, PKCζ, PKCϵ, and anti-GFP antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The anti-PKCμ (clone C20) antibody, which recognizes PKD and PKD2, was also obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. The phospho-PKD/PKCμ antibody (anti-pS744/pS748), which recognizes the phosphorylated state of the equivalent serines within the activation loop of PKD and PKD2 (PKD: Ser-744/Ser-748; PKD2: Ser-706/Ser-710) (26Waldron R.T.

The peptide was removed from the resin with trifluoroacetate, purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography, and each fraction characterized by high performance capillary electrophoresis. The fractions with the highest purity were pooled, lyophilized, and characterized by mass spectral analysis in the UCLA Pasarow Mass Spectrometry Laboratory. The murine PKCϵ-specific siRNA populations and their negative control obtained from SuperArray Bioscience Corp. (Frederick, MD) were used as suggested by the manufacturer.

PKD Activation Loop Phosphorylation Requires Translocation to the Plasma Membrane—The translocation of PKD from the cytosol to the plasma membrane in response to GPCR stimulation and its affinity for phorbol esters and DAG are mediated by its CRD (23Iglesias T.

Chem. 2001; 276: 32616-32626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We previously generated a PKD mutant, PKD.P287G, containing a proline to glycine substitution within the second cysteine-rich motif of the CRD that greatly reduces the affinity of PKD for phorbol esters/DAG (23Iglesias T. Matthews S. Rozengurt E. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used this mutant to test whether plasma membrane translocation of PKD is necessary for its activation loop phosphorylation. To examine in live cells the dynamic distribution of PKD and to facilitate its unambiguous detection from other PKD isozymes, we expressed PKD as a chimeric protein fused to GFP. As we previously reported, the GFP moiety did not produce any detectable effect on the basal catalytic activity, phorbol ester binding, or GPCR-mediated activation of PKD (51Rey O. Young S.H. Cantrell D. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32616-32626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 54Matthews S. Iglesias T. Cantrell D. Rozengurt E.

Cultures of Swiss 3T3 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding GFP-PKD or GFP-tagged PKD.P287G (GFP-PKD.P287G), and the redistribution of the fusion proteins in response to bombesin or PDBu stimulation was monitored by real-time imaging of live cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, GFP-PKD was distributed evenly throughout the cytosol and excluded from the nucleus with very little fluorescent signal localized to the plasma membrane in unstimulated Swiss 3T3 cells. We also detected that in some cells, in addition to its cytosolic localization, some GFP-PKD fluorescence was more pronounced at the perinuclear area consistent with a partial localization of this protein to the Golgi compartment as formerly reported (49Prestle J. Pfizenmaier K. Brenner J. Johannes F.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1401-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 50Rey O. Rozengurt E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Bombesin stimulation resulted in a rapid and dramatic translocation of GFP-PKD from the cytosol to the plasma membrane, as revealed by a localized fluorescence at the cell periphery (Fig. 1A, arrows), without any substantial redistribution of GFP-PKD to the Golgi compartment as previously observed (50Rey O. Rozengurt E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 51Rey O. Young S.H. Cantrell D. Rozengurt E. J. Biol.

The reverse translocation of GFP-PKD from the plasma membrane to the cytosol was complete within 10 min of bombesin stimulation. Stimulation with 50 or 200 nm PDBu also promoted the plasma membrane translocation of GFP-PKD. In contrast to wild type GFP-PKD, addition of either bombesin or 50 nm PDBu did not induce any detectable plasma membrane translocation of GFP-PKD.P287G (Fig. 1A), as a result of its reduced affini"

However, the desirable pharmacological features gained by protein PEGylation become irrelevant if conjugates are inactivated or cannot reach their target tissues. Here we describe the design and synthesis of MAL-FMS-OSU. This bifunctional agent enables PEG chains to be linked to peptides and proteins through a slowly hydrolysable chemical bond. PEG-FMS-peptide/protein conjugates thus formed undergo spontaneous hydrolysis at a slow rate upon incubation at pH 8.5, 37 °C with a t½ value of 8–14 ± 2 h, generating the unmodified parent molecule. The validity of this approach was studied with exendin-4 and human growth hormone. A single subcutaneous administration of PEG40,000-FMS-exendin-4 facilitated a prolonged and stable reduction in glucose levels in mice (t½ = 30 ± 2 h) and exceeded the effect obtained by the same dose of the native hormone by 7–8 times.

Berthold W. Pharm. Sci. Technol. Today. 1996; 1: 352-356Crossref Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Apparently, covalent binding of PEG to proteins produces steric interference, protecting conjugates from proteolysis and decreasing their rate of clearance from the circulation system via intracellular uptake and kidney filtration (2Katre N.V. Adv. Drug Delivery Sys. 1993; 10: 91-114Crossref Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 6Nucci M.L. Shorr R. Abuchowski A. Adv.

To achieve these desired pharmacological features, several low molecular weight PEG chains or a single high molecular weight PEG must be linked to a protein (8Fung W.-J. Porter J.E. Bailon P. Polymer Prepr. 1997; 38: 565-566Google Scholar). However, this often drastically decreases the biological or pharmacological potency of the protein (4Reddy K.R. Ann. Pharmacother. 2000; 34: 915-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 5Veronese F.M. Biomaterials. 2001; 22: 405-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Therefore, to maximize protection while minimizing reductions in bioactivity, PEGylation is usually applied to higher molecular weight proteins that are less likely to be inactivated by the procedure. However even such modification may lead to marked reduction in activity. For example, a currently used 40-kDa PEG-interferon-α2a exhibits only 7% of the activity of the native cytokine, thus necessitating the administration of higher doses (9Bailon P. Palleroni A. Schaffer C.A. Spence C.L. Fung W.-J. Porter J.E. Ehrlich G.K. Pan W. Xu Z.X. Modi M.W. Farid A. Berthold W. Graves M. Bioconjugate Chem. 2001; 12: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in contrast to its parent protein this 40-kDa PEG-interferon-α2a does not readily penetrate all target tissues, as it is restricted to the blood and interstitial fluid (10Reddy R.K. Modi M.W. Pedder S. Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 2002; 54: 571-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Several attempts to overcome these obstacles through reversible protein/peptide PEG-assisted delivery (e.g. by employing detachable PEG chains) have been reported (11Greenwald R.B. Choe Y.H. Conover C.D. Shum K. Wu D. Royzen M. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 475-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 12Lee S. Greenwald R.B. McGuire J. Yang K. Shi C.

Walker II, J.A. Mullah N. Quinn Y.P. Huang S.K. Bioconjugate Chem. 1999; 10: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). They suffer, however, from major disadvantages including their dependence on enzymatic hydrolysis as the rate-determining step of PEG-parent molecule dissociation (11Greenwald R.B. Choe Y.H. Conover C.D. Shum K. Wu D. Royzen M. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 475-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 12Lee S. Greenwald R.B. McGuire J. Yang K. Shi C.

Chem. 1999; 42: 3657-3667Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), potentially making the behavior of the molecules unpredictable and their utilization impractical because of steric considerations and inappropriate enzyme availability. An additional disadvantage is the nonspecific PEGylation of undesired protein/peptide functional moieties (e.g. hydroxyls, imidazole, thiols (14German A.J. Kalindjian S.B. FEBS Lett. 1987; 223: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar)), potentially causing post-PEGylation interand intramolecular reactions (14German A.J. Kalindjian S.B. FEBS Lett. 1987; 223: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 15Zalipsky S. Qazen M. Walker II, J.A. Mullah N. Quinn Y.P. Huang S.K. Bioconjugate Chem. 1999; 10: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) that could generate complex mixtures and immune-related risks. In view of these issues, we tested a novel approach for designing PEG-peptide/protein conjugates from which PEG is released by spontaneous chemical hydrolysis. Reversible PEG-protein conjugation permits time-dependent reactivation of inactive PEGylated molecules. An appropriate conjugate would have to undergo slow and spontaneous hydrolysis under physiological conditions to yield the intact parent molecule (16Gershonov E. Shechter Y. Fridkin M.

Our contributions are brought here in detail, using the anti-diabetic peptide exendin-4 and human growth hormone (hGH) as in vivo and in vitro models, respectively. Materials—Exendin-4 (HGEGTFTSDLSKQMEEEAVRLFIEWLKNGGPSSGAPPPS-NH2) and a non-lysine-containing synthetic peptide of 27 amino acids (AEISGQLSYVRDVNSWQHIWTNVSIEN) were synthesized by the solid phase method using a multiple peptide synthesizer, AMS 422 (Abimed Analyser Technik, GmbH). An Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) strategy was employed throughout the peptide chain assembly. α-Lactalbumin, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), reduced glutathione, and trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid were purchased from Sigma. PEG40,000-OSu (mPEG2-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester) was purchased from Shearwater (Huntsville, AL). All other materials used in this study were of analytical grade. A Centricon-50 ultrafiltration device for aqueous solutions was purchased from Millipore S.A. Ultraviolet spectra were obtained by using a Beckman DU 7500 spectrophotometer in 1-cm path length UV cuvettes. Mass spectra were determined using MALDI-TOF and ESMS techniques (Bruker-Reflex-Reflectron model and VG-platform-II electrospray single quadropole mass spectrometer, Micro Mass, respectively). HPLC analyses were performed using a Spectra-Physics SP8800 liquid chromatography system equipped with an Applied Biosystems 757 variable wavelength absorbance detector and a Spectra-SYSTEM P2000 liquid chromatography system equipped with a Spectra-SYSTEM AS100 autosampler and a Spectra-SYSTEM UV1000, all controlled by a ThermoQuest chromatography data system (ThermoQuest Inc., San Jose, CA). The column effluents were monitored by UV absorbance at 220 nm. Analytical reverse phase-HPLC was performed using a pre-packed Chromolith™ Performance RP-18e column (4.6 × 100 mm, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). The column was eluted with a binary gradient of 10–100% solution B over 10 min with a flow rate of 3 ml/min (solution A was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O and solution B was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile:H2O; 3:1, v/v). PEGylated compounds were analyzed using an RP-4 column (250 × 4 mm, 5-μm bead size, Vydac, Hesperia, CA) with a binary gradient of 10–100% solution B for 50 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Preparative separations were performed with pre-packed Vydac RP-18 or RP-4 columns (250 × 22 mm). The column was eluted with 10–100% solution B over 60 min (12 ml/min). MAL-FMS-OSu—9-Hydroxymethyl-2-amino fluorene was synthesized with an 84% yield as described elsewhere (20Albericio F. Cruz M. Debethune L. Eritja R. Giralt E. Grandas A. Marchan V. Pastor J.J. Pedroso E. Rabanal F. Royo M. Synth. Commun. 2001; 31: 225-232Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Conditions were as follows: TLC, chloroform:methanol, 9:1 (v/v); RF = 0.38; calculated ESMS = 211.26 Da, and found ESMS for [M+H]+ = 212.10 Da. 3-Maleimidopropionic Anhydride—3-Maleimidopropionic acid (1 g, 5.9 mmol) and N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (0.69 g, 2.95 mmol) were dissolved in 10 ml of N,N-dimethylformamide and incubated for 4 h. Dicyclohexylurea was filtered out, and the anhydride formed was kept at 4 °C. 9-Hydroxymethyl-2-amino fluorene (0.4 g, 1.9 mmol) and NaHCO3 (0.74 g, 8.85 mmol) were dissolved in water and 3-maleimidopropionic anhydride in N,N-dimethylformamide (12 ml, 2.95 mmol) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred for 40 min, and product formation was monitored by analytical HPLC on a Chromolith column (Rt = 4.46 min, 10–100% solution B in 10 min, 3 ml/min). The crude product was purified using preparative HPLC (RP-18 column, 10–100% acetonitril: water (75:25; v/v), 60 min, 12 ml/min). The yield was 57%, 1.08 mmol, 0.39 g; calculated ESMS = 362.38 Da, and found ESMS = 362.42 Da. Pyridine (0.167 ml, 2 mmol) was added dropwise to a stirred solution of 9-hydroxymethyl-2-(amino-3-maleimidopropionate)fluorene (0.37g, 1.02 mmol) and triphosgene (0.425 g, 1.43 mmol) in dry tetrahydrofuran (10 ml). After 20 min the precipitated pyridine hydrochloride salt was filtered out, and the tetrahydrofuran was removed by vacuum. The oil obtained was dissolved in 10 ml of dry tetrahydrofuran with N-hydroxysuccinimide (0.61g, 5.3 mmol). Pyridine (0.26 ml, 3.2 mmol) was then added, and the solution was stirred for 20 min. Some additional precipitated pyridine hydrochloride salt was filtered out, and the tetrahydrofuran was removed by vacuum. The oil obtained was dissolved in chloroform (100 ml) and washed with an aqueous NaHCO3 solution (0.5 n, 3 × 50 ml), HCl (0.1 n, 3 × 50 ml), water (2 × 50 ml), and brine. The chloroform was removed by vacuum, and the product was desiccated. Conditions were as follows: yield was 89%, 0.9 mmol, 0.45 g; HPLC (Chromolith column) Rt = 5.7 min (10–100% solution B in 10 min, 3 ml/min). Calculated ESMS = 503 Da, found ESMS for [M+Na]+ = 526.38 Da, and found ESMS for [M+K]+ = 542.30 Da. 9-Hydroxymethyl-2-(amino-3-maleimidopropionate)-7-sulfofluorene N-Hydroxysuccinimide—To a solution of 9-hydroxymethyl-2-(amino-3-maleimidopropionate)-fluorene N-hydroxysuccinimide (0.2 mmol, 0.1 g) in trifluoroacetic acid (10 ml), chlorosulfonic acid (0.5 ml) was added. After 15 min, cold ether (90 ml) was added, and the precipitated product was washed three times with ether and desiccated. Conditions were as follows: yield: 95%, 0.11 g, 0.19 mmol; HPLC (Chromolith column) Rt = 2.65 min (10–100% solution B in 10 min, 3 ml/min). The calculated ESMS = 583 Da; found ESMS for [M-H]+ = 582.24 Da, for [M+H]+ = 584.52 Da, and for [M+Na]+ = 606.47 Da. PEG40,000-SH—PEG40,000-OSu was dissolved at a concentration of 40 mg/ml in an aqueous solution of cystamine-di-HCl (1 m) and brought to pH 8.5 with NaHCO3. Reaction was carried out for 2 h at 25 °C. The product thus obtained was dialyzed overnight against 0.1 m NaHCO3, treated with 30 mm dithiothreitol (25 °C, 1 h), and redialyzed against 0.01 m HCl. PEG40,000-SH was obtained with a 93% yield. It contained 1 mol sulfhydryl moiety per mol of PEG40,000 as determined with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) in the presence of ascorbate. Preparation of PEG5000-2-Sulfo-9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl N-Hydroxysuccinimide—MAL-FMS-OSu (1.8 mg, 3 μmol) was added to a solution of PEG5000-SH (15 mg, ∼3 μmol) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (0.5 ml, pH 7.4), and the reaction solution was stirred for 30 min. The product PEG5000-FMS-OSu was purified by HPLC on an RP-4 column and lyophilized. PEG5000-FMS-Exendin-4—PEG5000-FMS-OSu (2.3 mg, ∼0.42 μmol) was added to a solution of exendin-4 (1.6 mg, 0.4 μmol) in PBS (0.5 ml, pH 8), and the reaction solution was stirred for 2 h. The product PEG5000-FMS-exendin-4 was purified by HPLC on an RP-4 column and lyophilized. Preparation of PEG40,000-FMS-Exendin-4—To a stirred solution of exendin-4 (1 mg in 1.0 ml of 0.1 m phosphate buffer, 2 mm ascorbate, pH 7.2, 0.239 mm) was added 280 μg of MAL-FMS-OSu (28 μl from a fresh solution of MAL-FMS-OSu in N,N-dimethylformamide, 10 mg/ml, 2.0 molar excess over the peptide). After 7 min, solid PEG40,000-SH was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm (2.1 molar excess over the peptide). The reaction was carried out for 1 h, dialyzed overnight against H2O, and then further filtered through Centricon with a molecular mass cutoff of 50 kDa to remove any residual exendin-4 or MAL-FMS-exendin-4 that had not linked to PEG40,000-SH. The concentration of the conjugate was determined by amino acid analysis according to the content of aspartic acid (two residues), alanine (two residues) and valine (one residue), or calculated from the absorbance of the conjugate at 280 nm. The calculated extinction coefficient at 280 nm was 26,940 ± 100, a value that is the additive absorbance of exendin-4 (ϵ280 = 5740) and PEG40,000-FMS (ϵ280 = 21,200). A solution of 20 μm PEG40,000-FMS-exendin had A = 0.51. Thus the conjugate had a 1:1 PEG40,000-FMS/exendin stoichiometry. Preparation of PEG40,000-Exendin-4—Exendin-4 (0.3 mg, 75 nmol) was dissolved in PBS, pH 7.5, and reacted with PEG40,000-OSu (20 mg, 470 nmol) for 3 h, filtered (7 times) through Centricon (cut off, 50 kDa), and characterized by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (found: 48,074 Da). PEG40,000-FMS-peptide 27 was prepared as described for PEG40,000-FMS-exendin-4. MAL-FMS-OSu (280 μg) was added to a solution of hGH (4.5 mg, 0.225 μmol) in 0.5 ml of PBS, pH 7.4. After 10 min PEG40,000-SH (10 mg) was added, and the reaction mixture was stirred for 1 h and dialyzed overnight against water. An hGH displacement assay was performed as described elsewhere (21Tsushima T. Sasaki N. Imai Y. Matsuzaki F. Friesen H.G. Biochem. J. 1980; 187: 479-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Glucose-lowering Assay of PEG40,000-FMS-Exendin-4—Three groups of CD1 mice (n = 6 per group) subcutaneously received saline, native exendin-4 (4 μg/mouse), or PEG40,000-FMS-exendin-4 (4 μg of peptide/mouse). Circulating glucose levels were measured with a glucose analyzer (Beckman Instruments) by the glucose oxidase method. Blood samples for the blood glucose analyses were taken from the tail veins. The level of glucose in normal healthy CD1-mice was 140 ± 7 mg/dl (7.77 mm). Glucose-lowering Assay of Released Exendin-4—PEG40,000-FMS-exendin-4 (0.36 mg containing 30 μg of exendin-4) was incubated for 24 h at pH 8.5, 37 °C. The released peptide was separated from the PEG40,000-sulfodibezofulvene using HPLC on a Chromolith column (10–100% solution B in 10 min, 3 ml/min), and the peptide solution was lyophilized. The peptide concentration was determined by its absorbance at 220 nm. Native exendin-4 and the released exendin-4 were dissolved in saline and administered subcutaneously at identical doses to five groups of CD1 mice (n = 3 per group). Circulating glucose levels were then determined as described above. We have designed, synthesized, and characterized MAL-FMS-OSu, Fig. 1A). This is a water-soluble heterobifunctional reagent consisting of a sulfonated fluorenyloxycarbonyl N-hydroxysuccinimide ester that reacts with peptide and protein amino groups. A maleimide group was attached to the fluorenyl backbone to enable coupling to sulfhydryl-containing PEG-SH (Fig. 1B). At 320 nm, where peptides or proteins absorb negligibly, MAL-FMS-OSu (either free or covalently bound to proteins) absorbs with a molar extinction coefficient (ϵ320) of 16,100 ± 150 mol–1 cm–1. Degree of MAL-FMS Incorporation as a Function of the Spacer Added—In Fig. 2, samples of α-lactalbumin (1 mg/ml) were modified with increasing concentrations of MAL-FMS-OSu in 0.1 m PBS, pH 7.2, for 30 min at 25 °C. That is, under experimental conditions where the maleimide-alkylating capacity of the spacer remains nonmodified (see the next paragraph). About 1 mol of MAL-FMS was incorporated into α-lactalbumin per 2.1 mol of reagent added, up to a 14 molar excess over the protein (Fig. 2). Stability of the MAL Function in Aqueous Solutions—Fig. 3 demonstrates the potency of the reaction of MAL-FMS-OSu with reduced glutathione as a function of time at different pH values. MAL-FMS-OSu was found fully stable at pH 4–6 over a period of a day or two, and at pH 7.2 it is stable over a period of several hours. At pH 8.5 the maleimido moiety is destroyed at an accelerated rate (t½ = 2.7 ± 0.3 h, Fig. 3). Two possible pathways for the related PEGylation of target peptides, proteins, and small molecules are suggested (Fig. 1B). One involves attaching MAL-FMS-OSu to the amine component of the target and then substituting PEG-SH for the maleimide moiety. The second option involves preparing PEG-FMS-OSu, which then reacts with the amine component of the target (Fig. 1B). This pathway is suitable for sulfhydryl- or disulfide-containing peptides and proteins. Rate of Hydrolysis of PEG-FMS Conjugates—Four PEG-FMS conjugates and one MAL-FMS conjugate were prepared using the described pathways (see Table I and “Experimental Procedures”). The hydrolysis rates and reaction orders of PEG5000-FMS-4-nitro-phenethylamine, PEG5000-FMS-exendin-4, PEG40,000-FMS-exendin-4, and PEG40,000-FMS-hGH were evaluated at pH 8.5, 37 °C (Table I). The hydrolysis rate at pH 8.5 is equivalent to the hydrolysis rate in serum as shown previously (16Gershonov E. Shechter Y. Fridkin M.

The release of 4-nitro-phenethylamine, exendin-4, and hGH was monitored by reverse phase-HPLC and was determined to be a first order reaction (Table I and Figs. 4 and 5). As shown (Fig. 4 and Table I), the peptides and protein were released from the conjugates in a slow homogenous fashion, with t½ of 9.4, 13.8, 11.9, and 11.8 h. Exendin-4 was fully released from the PEG40,000 conjugate after 48 h of incubation.Table IStructures and half-lives of PEG-FMS conjugates Open table in a new tab Fig. 4The rate of hydrolysis of PEG-FMS conjugates upon incubation at pH 8.5, 37 °C is shown in A. Solutions of PEG40,000-FMS-exendin-4 (right, ○), PEG5000-FMS-exendin-4 (left, ○), and PEG5000-FMS-4-nitro-phenethyl amine (left, □) were incubated in PBS at pH 8.5, 37 °C. At the indicated time points, aliquots (50 μl) were analyzed using HPLC on an RP-4 column. Results are expressed as percent of the maximal peak area of released exendin-4 and 4-nitrophenethylamine as a function of time. B, the concentration of PEG40,000-FMS-exendin-4 (○) and PEG40,000-FMS-hGH (□) was determined for each time point by HPLC. The linear plot obtained indicates that the rate of hydrolysis is of first order reaction. The half-life time of the conjugates was calculated from t½ = ln 2/k, when k is the slope of the linear plot (h–1).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 5Time course of reactivation of PEG40,000-FMS-hGH upon incubation at pH 8.5, 37 °C. PEG40,000-FMS-hGH (1 mg/ml) was incubated in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, 0.6% bovine serum albumin, and 2 mm NaN3 at 37 °C. Aliquots were withdrawn at the indicated time points and analyzed for their potencies in displacing 125I-hGH from enriched hGH receptor preparation extracted from rabbit liver plasma membranes. Native hGH displaces 125I-hGH in this assay half-maximally at a concentration of 0.3 ± 0.03 nm. An hGH derivative exhibiting half-maximal displacement in this assay at a concentration of 3.0 ± 0.3 nm is considered to have 10% of the binding potency of the native receptor. The rate of release of hGH from PEG40-FMS-hGH upon incubation at pH 8.5, 37 °C is shown in the inset. PEG40,000FMS-hGH (1 mg of protein) was incubated as described above.

Upon incubation, recognition of the released hGH by the native hGH receptor was preserved (Fig. 5). Exendin-4 is an insulinotropic glucagon-like peptide-1 agonist that associates with β-pancreatic cells, elevates endogenous cAMP levels, enhances secretion of insulin, and lowers circulating glucose levels (22Eng J.

Peptides. 1994; 15: 453-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A profound pharmacological advantage of this glucagon-like peptide-1 agonist is that (following administration at any dosage) the circulating blood glucose level never falls below a threshold that in non-diabetic healthy CD1 mice is 74 ± 7 mg/dl (26Shechter Y. Tsubery H. Fridkin M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 305: 386-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Fig. 6 shows the glucose-lowering profile of subcutaneously administered native exendin-4 and of PEG40,000-FMS-exendin-4 at a dose of 4 μg of peptide/mouse relative to a saline-treated group of mice. With the native peptide, blood glucose level declined 26–28% (from 140 to 104–101 mg/dl) with the largest percent change in blood glucose level occurring 0.5–1 h after administration. Glucose concentrations then returned to their initial levels with a t½ of 3.7 ± 0.3 h. Following the subcutaneous administration of PEG40,000-FMS-exendin-4, the decrease in blood glucose level took place at a more moderate rate. Circulating glucose reached its lowest concentration 8–12 h after administration (92 mg/dl, 33%). Stable, low circulating glucose concentrations were then maintained for a further 12 h. Return to initial glucose levels took place with a t½ of 30 ± 2 h, which is 7.5 times longer than that obtained by the same dose of the native hormone. Irreversibly conjugated PEG40,000-exendin-4 has only ≤1% of the activity of native exendin-4 (IC50 = 250 ± 30 pmol/mouse versus IC50 = 2.5 ± 0.24 pmol/mouse for the native exendin-4, not shown). Biological Potency of Exendin-4 that Was Released from PEG40,000-FMS-Exendin-4 Conjugate—Fig. 7 shows the glucose-lowering pattern of exendin-4 released from the PEG40,000-FMS-exendin-4 conjugate by incubation at pH 8.5, 37 °C for 24 h. The glucose-lowering pattern of the released exendin-4 was indistinguishable from that obtained by the native peptide; both reduced blood glucose levels by 30 and 50% 1 h after subcutaneous administration of 0.1 and 1 μg of peptide/mouse, respectively. PEGylation's previously mentioned side effect of drastically decreasing drug bioactivity has meant that only a limited number of such conjugates have found clinical application (5Veronese F.M. Biomaterials. 2001; 22: 405-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). This happens despite the profound advantages that steric protection confers in elongating the lifetimes of the drugs in vivo, protecting them from proteolysis and shielding them from the immune system (4Reddy K.R. Ann. Pharmacother. 2000; 34: 915-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 5Veronese F.M. Biomaterials. 2001; 22: 405-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar, 6Nucci M.L. Shorr R.

Theoretically, decreased bioactivity can be overcome by linking the PEG chains via a chemical bond sensitive to mild alkaline and/or acid hydrolysis or enzymatically able to be cleaved by serum proteases or esterases. Obviously, an inconsistent rate of hydrolysis would render such an approach impractical. A prerequisite condition is therefore that the hydrolysis of the PEG chains from the conjugate takes place at a slow rate and in a homogenous fashion under the strictly homeostatic pH and temperature conditions of the mammalian circulatory system (27Benet L.Z. Mitchell T.R. Scheiner L.B. Goodman L. Gilman A.E. Rall T.W. Nies A.S. Taylor G.M. The Pharmalogical Basis of Therapeutics. Pergamon Press, New York1990: 3-32Google Scholar). Previously, we prepared FMS-OSu (17Gershonov E. Goldwaser I. Fridkin M. Shechter Y. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 2530-2537Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 18Shechter Y. Patt L.P. Schreiber G.

Drugs Future. 2001; 26: 669-676Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar) as a reversible protein modifier. Protein-linked FMS moieties undergo slow and spontaneous hydrolysis under physiological conditions, generating the unmodified parent molecule. Hydrolysis of FMS-protein conjugates at 37 °C in normal human serum, in aqueous buffers of pH 8.5, or in the circulatory system in vivo takes place with a t½ of 5–7 h. Using the FMS moiety as the scaffold for the suggested reversible PEGylation technology enables the hydrolysis rates of various PEG-FMS-protein conjugates to be predicted. The t½ for the hydrolysis of modified small molecules and PEG-conjugated polypeptides and proteins falls within a relatively narrow range of 8–14 h (Table I). The constant hydrolysis rate for PEG-FMS-protein conjugates is caused by the β-elimination reaction, which occurs at position 9 of the fluorenyl moiety (Fig. 1B) and is solely dependent on the pH of the surrounding medium. Thus, in contrast to what occurs in studies based on enzymatic hydrolytic bond cleavage, similar PEG-FMS hydrolysis rates are expected from all conjugates regardless of the identity of the protein/peptide moiety conjugated. Using the present approach one can further control the hydrolysis rate by substituting the fluorenyl moiety with electron-withdrawing or electron-inducing groups that increase or decrease, respectively, the hydrolysis rate. The number of PEG-FMS chains attached to a drug should also affect the rate at which the native drug is released. Exendin-4 contains one His Nα amino function and two Lys Nϵ amino groups, enabling modification at these three positions. Indeed, N-terminal amino acid sequencing revealed that, although the PEG40,000-FMS-exendin-4 product eluted as a single peak on HPLC, it was actually a mixture containing primarily the Nα-modified hormone. Similarly, hGH contains several amino functions that may be conjugated. However, in view of the reversibility of the PEGylation reaction, which regenerate the native peptide and protein hormones, this point deserves only minor consideration. Calculations based on the hydrolysis rates of FMS-exendin-4 and PEG40,000-FMS-exendin-4 at 37 °C in normal sera and PBS, pH 8.5, respectively, revealed that ∼4% of exendin-4 is released from the conjugate each hour in vivo (19Shechter Y. Goldwaser I. Lavon I. Gershonov E. Mester B. Mironchik M. Patt L.P. Fridkin M. Drugs Future. 2001; 26: 669-676Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We further hypothesized that this release rate if combined with prolonged maintenance of the conjugate in the circulatory system prior to exendin-4 hydrolysis should yield a long lasting glucose-lowering signal in mice, as indeed is found following a single subcutaneous administration of PEG40,000-FMS-exendin-4 conjugate (Fig. 6). It should be noted that the covalently linked exendin-4 is fully active following its release from PEG40,000-FMS-exendin-4 by incubation (Fig. 7), suggesting that the conjugation per se does not lead to irreversible modification and/or denaturation of the peptide. The sulfonated fulvene moiety is not toxic as previously shown (19Shechter Y. Goldwaser I. Lavon I. Gershonov E. Mester B. Mironchik M. Patt L.P. Fridkin M. Drugs Future. 2001; 26: 669-676Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). High molecular weight PEG is known to be safe in terms of toxicity and immunogenicity and is widely used in the food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries (28Working P.K. Newman M.S. Johnson J. Cornacoff J.B. Harris J.M. Zalipsky S. Poly(ethylene glycol) Chemistry and Biological Applications. ACS Books, Washington, D. C.1997: 45-57Google Scholar, 29Roberts M.J. Bentley M.D. Harris J.M. Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 2002; 54: 459-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). In summary a conceptual approach termed “reversible PE-Gylation” was implemented here with low molecular weight polypeptides and proteins. This novel approach enables the desirable pharmacological features associated with PEGylation to be conferred on low molecular weight peptide and protein drugs that would otherwise have been fully or partially inactivated by this technique. A pharmacologically “silent” conjugate that is “trapped” in the circulatory system releases the covalently linked parent peptide or protein with a desirable pharmacokinetic profile. This new development is expected to extend the lifetime, bioavailability, and efficacy of existing peptide drugs and to extend the same in peptide drug candidates that may yet be discovered by genomics and proteomics.

https://openalex.org/W2082858453,"Lon belongs to a unique group of proteases that bind to DNA and is involved in the regulation of several important cellular functions, including adaptation to nutritional downshift. Previously, we revealed that inorganic polyphosphate (polyP) increases in Escherichia coli in response to amino acid starvation and that it stimulates the degradation of free ribosomal proteins by Lon. In this work, we examined the effects of polyP on the proteolytic and DNA-binding activities of Lon. An order-of-addition experiment suggested that polyP first binds to Lon, which stimulates Lon-mediated degradation of ribosomal proteins. A polyP-binding assay using Lon deletion mutants showed that the polyP-binding site of Lon is localized in the ATPase domain. Because the same ATPase domain also contains the DNA-binding site, polyP can compete with DNA for binding to Lon. In fact, an equimolar amount of polyP almost completely inhibited DNA-Lon complex formation, suggesting that Lon binds to polyP with a higher affinity than it binds to DNA. Collectively, our results showed that polyP may control the cellular activity of Lon not only as a protease but also as a DNA-binding protein.

Inorganic polyphosphate (polyP) 1The abbreviations used are: polyP, inorganic polyphosphate; MBP, maltose-binding protein. is a linear polymer of many hundreds of orthophosphate residues linked together by ATP-like high energy phosphoanhydride bonds. This polymer naturally occurs in microbes, fungi, plants, and animals (1Kornberg A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, the level of polyP is very low in the exponential phase, but it increases up to 1000-fold in response to amino acid starvation and during the onset of the stationary phase (2Rao N.N. Kornberg A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1394-1400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Kuroda A. Murphy H. Cashel M. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21240-21243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). We demonstrated previously that polyP forms a complex with the ATP-dependent Lon protease, an enzyme that degrades intracellular proteins during nutritional downshift (4Kuroda A. Nomura K. Ohtomo R. Kato J. Ikeda T. Takiguchi N. Ohtake H. Kornberg A. Science. 2001; 293: 705-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). We further showed that most of the proteins degraded by the polyP-Lon were free ribosomal proteins. Thus, it appears that polyP helps mediate adaptation to nutritional downshift by directing the degradation of ribosomal proteins. PolyP also binds to ribosomal proteins, suggesting that its interaction with the substrate may be important for the stimulation of degradation (4Kuroda A. Nomura K. Ohtomo R. Kato J. Ikeda T. Takiguchi N. Ohtake H. Kornberg A. Science. 2001; 293: 705-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). However, whether polyP first binds to Lon or to the ribosomal proteins has not been established. Lon is a highly conserved enzyme present in Archaea and eubacteria as well as in the mitochondria of eukaryotes. The Lon monomer includes an N terminus of unknown function, a central ATPase containing a typical ATP-binding motif, and a C-terminal proteolytic domain with a catalytically active residue at Ser-679 (5Chin D.T.

The N-terminal region also contains a “basic-acid-basic” region (9Ebel W. Skinner M.M. Dierksen K.P. Scott J.M. Trempy J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2236-2243Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A “sensor and substrate discrimination” domain has been identified between the ATPase and protease domains (10Smith C.K. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6678-6682Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Purified sensor and substrate discrimination domain binds to known Lon substrates (10Smith C.K. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6678-6682Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), suggesting that it plays a role in substrate recognition. Although E. coli Lon is thought to be a homo-tetramer or -octamer, recent structural analysis of the proteolytic domain of Lon revealed that it assembles into hexameric rings (11Botos I. Melnikov E.E. Cherry S. Tropea J.E. Khalatova A.G. Rasulova F. Dauter Z. Maurizi M.R. Rotanova T.V. Wlodawer A. Gustchina A. J. Biol.

Lon contributes to the regulation of several important cellular functions, including radiation resistance, cell division, filamentation, capsular polysaccharide production, lysogeny of certain bacteriophages (reviewed in Refs. 12Goldberg A.L.

Science. 2001; 293: 705-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). E. coli Lon is known to bind nonspecifically to DNA (15Charette M.F. Henderson G.W. Doane L.L. Markovitz A. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 158: 195-201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, human Lon binds specifically to a single-stranded GT-rich DNA sequence of human mitochondrial DNA (16Fu G.K. Markovitz D.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1905-1909Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In addition, Fu et al. (17Fu G.K. Smith M.J. Markovitz D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 534-538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) showed that the E. coli Lon binds to a TG-rich site (pets) of the human immunodeficiency virus type2 enhancer. Whether E. coli Lon has a specific binding site on the E. coli chromosome is unclear. It has been suggested that the basic-acid-basic domain is involved in DNA binding (5Chin D.T. Goff S.A. Webster T. Smith T. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11718-11728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another report speculated that the protease domain is involved in DNA binding, because the amino acid sequence of this domain is similar to that of the DNA-binding protein LexA (18Rotanova T.V. Vopr. Med. Khim. 2002; 48: 541-552PubMed Google Scholar). In both cases, the DNA-binding sites of Lon were predicted from its amino acid sequence. Here, our experimental data suggested that both the polyP- and DNA-binding sites of Lon are localized in the ATPase domain. This explains why polyP competes with DNA for binding to Lon. Finally, based on these findings, we discuss the regulatory effects of polyP on the proteolytic and DNA-binding activities of Lon. Protein Purification—Lon protease fused with maltose-binding protein (MBP-Lon) was expressed in E. coli (pMal-Lon) and purified using amylose resin as described by Sonezaki et al. (19Sonezaki S. Kondo A. Oba T. Ishii Y. Kato Y. Nakayama H. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1994; 42: 313-318PubMed Google Scholar). MBP-Lon was further purified by Hi Trap Q anion exchange chromatography (Amersham Biosciences). MBP-Lon was eluted from the Hi Trap Q column with a linear gradient of 0–1 m NaCl in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 20% glycerol). Lon was purified after the cleavage of proteolytic removal of MBP as described previously (19Sonezaki S. Kondo A. Oba T. Ishii Y. Kato Y. Nakayama H. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1994; 42: 313-318PubMed Google Scholar). The proteolytically inactive mutant, Lon-S679A, was also expressed as a fusion with MBP (a gift from Dr. S. Sonezaki (Toto Ltd., Kitakyushu, Japan)). MBP-SulA was purified as described previously (20Sonezaki S. Ishii Y. Okita K. Sugino T. Kondo A. Kato Y. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1995; 43: 304-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Ribosomal proteins were purified from isolated ribosomes as follows. Ribosomes were isolated from E. coli MG1655 by ultracentrifugation (21Wickstrom E. Laing L.G. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 164: 238-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Ribosomal proteins were extracted by incubating the purified ribosomes for 20 h at 4 °C with 4.5 m LiCl and 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol (22Cachia C. Flamion P.J. Schreiber J.P. J. Chromatogr. 1991; 539: 343-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). After precipitating the ribosomal RNAs by centrifugation (5000 × g, 5 min), the supernatant containing ribosomal proteins was dialyzed against buffer B (50 mm ammonium acetate, pH 5.6, 10% glycerol, and 0.15 m NaCl). The supernatant was applied to a carboxymethyl cation exchange column (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA), and ribosomal proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 150–750 mm NaCl in buffer B over 15-column volumes. Some ribosomal proteins were further purified by gel filtration chromatography with Superdex 75 (Amersham Biosciences) in buffer A containing 150 mm NaCl. Degradation of Ribosomal Proteins by Lon—Ribosomal proteins (5 μg) and Lon (1.5 μg) were incubated in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 4 mm ATP, and 5 mm Mg2+ in the presence and absence of 1.4 μm polyP700 as a polymer at 37 °C and then separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE. PolyP700 was synthesized by polyP kinase with ATP as a substrate as described previously (4Kuroda A. Nomura K. Ohtomo R. Kato J. Ikeda T. Takiguchi N. Ohtake H. Kornberg A. Science. 2001; 293: 705-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, ribosomal proteins were stained with SYPRO Orange (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and then visualized with a Typhoon image analyzer (Amersham Biosciences). Construction of Deletion Mutants of Lon—To construct deletion mutants of Lon fused to MBP, a DNA fragment corresponding to Lon 1–713 was amplified using primers F1 and R713 and pMal-Lon (S679A) as the template. The amplified DNA fragment was digested with EcoRI and then inserted into XmnI and EcoRI-digested pMal-c-2x (New England BioLabs, Ontario, Canada). Lon 1–302, Lon 136–784, Lon 272–784, Lon 320–784, Lon 181–302, Lon 272–437, Lon 320–437, Lon 472–616, and Lon 618–775 were constructed with using primers F1 and R302, F136 and R784, F272 and R784, F320 and R784, F181 and R302, F272 and R437, F320 and R437, F472 and R616, and F618 and R775, respectively.

Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were collected by centrifugation and suspended in SDS sample buffer (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). After boiling for 5 min, samples were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE. Separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were washed twice with an incubation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.1% Triton X-100) and incubated for 12 h at 37 °C in the same buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin. PolyP700 (10.3 pmol) labeled with 32P (4Kuroda A. Nomura K. Ohtomo R. Kato J. Ikeda T. Takiguchi N. Ohtake H. Kornberg A. Science. 2001; 293: 705-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) was added, and the mixture was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. The membranes were washed twice with the incubation buffer and then exposed to a film (Bas-IP, Fujifilm, Kanagawa, Japan). The exposed film was analyzed using the Typhoon image analyzer (Amersham Biosciences). PolyP- and DNA-binding Assays—Deletion mutants of Lon fused with MBP were purified using amylose resin. Purified proteolytically inactive MBP-Lon (S679A) or its deletion mutants (35 pmol) and [32P]polyP (1 pmol) were mixed for 5 min at room temperature in 50 μl of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm ATP. The mixture was applied to a nitrocellulose filter (0.45 μm), and the free [32P]polyP was washed off under a vacuum with a solution of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 5 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm NaCl (4Kuroda A. Nomura K. Ohtomo R. Kato J. Ikeda T. Takiguchi N. Ohtake H. Kornberg A. Science. 2001; 293: 705-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The radioactivity remaining on the filter, corresponding to the amount of polyP-protein complex, was measured by scintillation counting. For the DNA-binding experiment, a DNA fragment (722 bp) coding leuC (514–1189 bp from the translational initiation site) was amplified using CAGGTCGACTCTAGAGGATC and CAGTGAATTCGAGCTCGGTA as primers and pUC-leuC as a template, and then labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The DNA-binding activity of Lon was assessed as described above except using 32P-labeled DNA instead of polyP. The radioactivity remaining on the filter was measured by scintillation counting. Sequencing of DNA Extracted from DNA-Lon Complex—Proteolytically inactive Lon fused with MBP was expressed in E. coli harboring pMal-Lon(S679A). After the E. coli cells were disrupted, a lysate containing MBP-Lon-DNA complexes was applied to the immobilized amylose column. The column was washed with five volumes of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.25% Tween 20 and then washed with five volumes of the same buffer containing 200 mm NaCl. After free DNA was completely eluted from the column, MBP-Lon was eluted with the same buffer containing 10 mm maltose. The fraction containing MBP-Lon was extracted twice with the same volume of phenol-chloroform, after which DNA was precipitated with ethanol. The DNA was dissolved with water, inserted into the SmaI site of pUC119, and then used to transform E. coli. Inserted DNAs obtained from 21 individual recombinants were sequenced (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Gel-shift Assay—LeuC DNA (0.5 pmol) and Lon (S679A) (1 μg) were incubated for 5 min at room temperature in the presence or absence of polyP. The reactions were then mixed with loading dye and separated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). After staining with ethidium bromide, DNA was visualized under UV light. Double-stranded pets DNA (GATCCAGCTATACTTGGTCAGGGCGAATTCTAACTA) (17Fu G.K. Smith M.J. Markovitz D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 534-538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) was synthesized and used as a competitor. PolyP Affects the Substrate Specificity of Lon—In the presence of polyP, Lon degrades most LiCl-extracted ribosomal proteins (4Kuroda A. Nomura K. Ohtomo R. Kato J. Ikeda T. Takiguchi N. Ohtake H. Kornberg A. Science. 2001; 293: 705-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). We purified several ribosomal proteins of the large subunit (L1, L3, L6, L9, L13, L15, L17, L18, and L24) and subjected them to Lon-mediated degradation in the presence or absence of polyP. Lon degraded L1, L3, L6, and L24 in the presence but not in the absence of polyP (Fig. 1A). PolyP also stimulated the degradation of purified L9, L13, and L17 but not L15 and L18 (data not shown). Lon is known to be responsible for the rapid turnover of regulatory proteins, including SulA, a cell division inhibitor produced in response to DNA damage. Therefore MBP-SulA was subjected to degradation by Lon in the presence and absence of polyP. In contrast to the ribosomal proteins tested, the degradation of the MBP-SulA protein was slightly inhibited in the presence of 1.4 μm polyP (Fig. 1B). Therefore, our results showed that polyP does not always stimulate Lon-mediated protein degradation and that polyP affects the substrate specificity of Lon. PolyP-Lon Complex Formation Is Important for the Stimulation of Ribosomal Protein Degradation—Most ribosomal proteins bind to polyP and are degraded by Lon in the presence of polyP (4Kuroda A. Nomura K. Ohtomo R. Kato J. Ikeda T. Takiguchi N. Ohtake H. Kornberg A. Science. 2001; 293: 705-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The MBP-SulA protein does not bind to polyP, indicating that polyP binding is necessary for the polyP stimulation of Lon-mediated proteolysis. However, not all polyP-binding proteins are degraded by Lon in the presence of polyP. For example, polyP kinase, L15, and L18 can bind to polyP, but they are not degraded by Lon in the presence of polyP. Therefore, it is likely that polyP binding is necessary but not sufficient for the polyP stimulation of Lon-mediated proteolysis. Lon also binds polyP (4Kuroda A. Nomura K. Ohtomo R. Kato J. Ikeda T. Takiguchi N. Ohtake H. Kornberg A. Science. 2001; 293: 705-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Does polyP first bind to Lon and then the polyP-Lon complex degrades the ribosomal proteins? Alternatively, does polyP bind to ribosomal proteins and then Lon recognizes the polyP-ribosomal protein complex for degradation? In the latter case, polyP may function as a molecular tag, much like ubiquitin in eukaryotic cells (reviewed in Refs. 24Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6900) Google Scholar, 25Baumeister W. Walz J. Zuhl F. Seemuller E. Cell. 1998; 92: 367-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar, 26Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar), to identify ribosomal proteins for degradation by proteases. To answer these questions, we examined the effect of the order of addition on L24 cleavage (Fig. 2). We found that Lon efficiently degraded L24 when Lon and polyP were mixed together prior to the addition of L24, whereas there was little degradation of L24 when L24 was first mixed with polyP before the addition of Lon (Fig. 2). This indicated that polyP-Lon complex formation is important for the stimulation of protein degradation and that polyP does not act as a tag for Lon-mediated degradation. PolyP- and DNA-binding Sites of Lon Are Localized within the ATPase Domain—Lon consists of basic-acid-basic, ATPase, sensor and substrate discrimination, and proteolytic domains (Fig. 3A). To determine the polyP-binding site of Lon, we generated proteins containing deletion mutants of Lon fused to the C terminus of MBP. These proteins were expressed and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Fig. 3B). PolyP blotting was performed using [32P]polyP (Fig. 3B). The results of this experiment showed that the polyP-binding site is localized on Lon between amino acids 272 and 437. Because Lon 320–784 also bound to polyP, the polyP-binding site is presumably restricted to the region between amino acids 320 and 437. Therefore, polyP binding appears to be mediated by the ATPase domain. We examined this further using purified Lon deletion mutants. The fusion proteins were purified by amylose chromatography and then used in a polyP-binding assay (Fig. 3C). We found that the binding activity of the purified Lon 272–437 was almost same as that of intact Lon. This supports the idea that the polyP-binding site is localized in the ATPase domain of Lon. Although Lon was originally identified as a DNA-binding protein (5Chin D.T. Goff S.A. Webster T. Smith T. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11718-11728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Charette M.F. Henderson G.W. Doane L.L. Markovitz A. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 158: 195-201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the location of the DNA-binding site has not been determined. We therefore performed a DNA-binding assay using the purified Lon deletion mutants. We used 32P-labeled E. coli leuC DNA as a probe because, as shown below, a leuC DNA fragment was co-purified with MBP-Lon. Fig. 3C shows that the DNA-binding site also appears to be localized in the ATPase domain of Lon. Lon Binds to polyP More Strongly than to DNA—Because the ATPase domain contains both polyP- and DNA-binding sites, polyP may compete with DNA for the binding to Lon. To examine this possibility, we determined the effect of polyP on the DNA-Lon complex using a gel-shift assay (Fig. 4). DNA (leuC) formed a complex with Lon, but in the presence of an equimolar amount of polyP, formation of the DNA-Lon complex was almost completely inhibited. This suggested that polyP binds to Lon more strongly than to DNA. To further confirm that the DNA-Lon complex is inhibited in the presence of polyP, we examined the effect of polyP on MBP-Lon binding to a DNA-cellulose column. MBP-Lon was not eluted from the column by a buffer alone, but was eluted when the buffer contained polyP (Fig. 5). This result suggested that polyP can bind to Lon at the same site as DNA (Fig. 5).Fig. 5Elution of Lon from DNA-immobilized column with polyP. MBP-Lon (50 μg) was applied to a DNA-cellulose (Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 50 mm NaCl. After washing with two volumes of the same buffer, MBP-Lon was eluted from the column with the buffer containing 0.14 μm polyP as a polymer. Each fraction was separated by SDS-PAGE, and MBP-Lon was visualized by sliver staining. M, molecular marker.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) During the course of the studies using amylose chromatography, we observed that purified MBP-Lon contains bound DNA. This bound DNA was lost when the MBP-Lon was further purified using an anion-exchange column. Interestingly, when the E. coli cells were subjected to nutritional downshift, which increases polyP level as much as 1000-fold (2Rao N.N. Kornberg A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1394-1400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Kuroda A. Murphy H. Cashel M. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21240-21243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), we found a significant amount of polyP associated with the amylose resin-purified MBP-Lon (data not shown). Together, our results showed that although Lon can form a complex with DNA in vitro and in vivo, Lon forms a complex with polyP when it is present. Lon Binds Nonspecifically to E. coli Chromosomal DNA— Although Fu et al. (17Fu G.K. Smith M.J. Markovitz D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 534-538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) showed that the E. coli Lon binds to a TG-rich pets site of the human immunodeficiency virus type2 enhancer, it is unclear whether Lon binds to specific sites on the E. coli genome. To examine this in greater detail, we cloned and sequenced the DNA fragments that were co-purified with the amylose resin-purified Lon. Twenty-one DNA clones were randomly selected for analysis. Their DNA sequences corresponded to 382–1009-bp fragments containing b0899, b2324, ftsJ, leuC, lon, lpdX, malE, rhsE, secD, yacK, yafA, ybbC, yecA, yejB, yfhK, ygcU, and ymfE, and 496–679-bp fragments containing the intercistronic regions between b2973 and b2972, cynS and cynX, rplM and rpsI, and yecS and yecC (Table II). There was no significant similarity among the sequences of these DNA fragments. Thus, in agreement with Charette et al. (15Charette M.F. Henderson G.W. Doane L.L. Markovitz A. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 158: 195-201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it appears that Lon binds nonspecifically to E. coli chromosomal DNA.Table IIDNA fragments co-purified with MBP-LonGenePositionaNucleotide number from the start site of translation is indicated.b0899893 to 1363b2324-45 to 964b29732200 to 2806cynS204 to 700ftsJ-84 to 546leuC514 to 1189lon845 to 1616lpdX686 to 1071malE313 to 932rhsE1006 to 1864rplM162 to 664secD-67 to 673yacK118 to 675yafA703 to 1417ybbC31 to 413yecA72 to 605yecS393 to 1072yejB-23 to 512yfhK430 to 1033ygcU375 to 861ymfE15 to 498a Nucleotide number from the start site of translation is indicated. Open table in a new tab We also examined the relative affinities of leuC and the pets DNA. We used synthesized 36-bp TG-rich pets DNA as a competitor in the LeuC DNA-binding experiment. The leuC DNA-Lon complex was still observed in the presence of a 100-fold molar excess of the pets DNA (data not shown), suggesting that the pets DNA has lower affinity toward Lon than the LeuC DNA. PolyP Regulates the Proteolytic Activity of Lon by Forming a polyP-Lon Complex—Regulatory proteolysis is generally quite specific, and the features of proteins that target them for degradation are well known in eukaryotic cells. Specifically, conjugation of proteins with ubiquitin (ubiquitination) targets them to the proteasome and is essential for the degradation of many proteins in eukaryotic cells (24Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6900) Google Scholar, 25Baumeister W. Walz J. Zuhl F. Seemuller E. Cell. 1998; 92: 367-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar, 26Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar). In bacteria, the SsrA-mediated tagging and degradation system provides a unique mechanism for the destruction of abnormal proteins produced by inappropriate translation termination (27Karzai A.W. Roche E.D. Sauer R.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Therefore, we suspected that polyP acts as a tag to direct Lon-mediated protein degradation. However, our current order of addition experiments suggested that polyP first binds to Lon rather than to the targeted ribosomal proteins, suggesting that polyP does not function as a tag for Lon-mediated degradation. We recently found that based on gel chromatography, the polyP-Lon complex is very large (>2000 kDa). 2K. Nomura, J. Kato, N. Takiguchi, H. Ohtake, and A. Kuroda, unpublished observation. Furthermore, dynamic light scattering measurements indicated a molecular mass of ∼8750 kDa (data not shown). Because one molecule polyP binds to approximately four molecules of Lon (4Kuroda A. Nomura K. Ohtomo R. Kato J. Ikeda T. Takiguchi N. Ohtake H. Kornberg A. Science. 2001; 293: 705-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), it might be considered that the polyP-Lon complex is a multiple of the Lon hexamer. Additional studies must be performed to more precisely determine the structure of the polyP-Lon complex. PolyP Affects the DNA-binding Activity of Lon—Analysis of polyP and DNA binding by Lon mutants indicated that the polyP- and DNA-binding sites of Lon are localized in the ATPase domain. Also, polyP bound to Lon more strongly than DNA, which allows polyP to displace the Lon-associated DNA in vitro as well as in vivo. The ATPase domain is thought to be involved in the important chaperon activity (10Smith C.K. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6678-6682Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), and DNA has been reported to stimulate the ATPase activity of Lon (15Charette M.F. Henderson G.W. Doane L.L. Markovitz A. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 158: 195-201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, we have shown previously that polyP slightly inhibits the ATPase activity of Lon in the absence of substrates (4Kuroda A. Nomura K. Ohtomo R. Kato J. Ikeda T. Takiguchi N. Ohtake H. Kornberg A. Science. 2001; 293: 705-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). It is a bit puzzling that both of the polyP-Lon and DNA-Lon complexes show ATPase activities if polyP and DNA persistently cover the ATPase domain. It might be possible that polyP and DNA binding to the ATPase domain are dynamic rather than static. Regulatory Effects of polyP on the Proteolytic and DNA-binding Activities of Lon—Goff and Goldberg (28Goff S.A. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem.,. 1987; 262: 4508-4515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that overproduction of Lon causes the proteolysis of normal proteins in cells and is lethal to the host cells. We also observed that E. coli growth stopped immediately when Lon was overproduced (data not shown). Excess Lon is unfavorable to cells under normal conditions. Sonezaki et al. (29Sonezaki S. Okita K. Oba T. Ishii Y. Kondo A. Kato Y. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1995; 44: 484-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) speculated that Lon is normally localized in the multiprotein-DNA complex (nucleoid), which might restrict its ability to access and degrade proteins under normal conditions. They also showed that MBP-Lon was dissociated from DNA in the presence of denatured but not native bovine serum albumin and that treatment of MBP-Lon at 47 °C reduced its DNA-binding ability but does not affect its protease activity. These findings suggested that exposure to heat shock causes a release of Lon from DNA allowing it to degrade denatured proteins. Similarly our data suggested that when the levels of polyP increase in response to nutritional downshift, the polyP-Lon complex is released from DNA whereupon it can access and degrade free ribosomal proteins. It is also possible that Lon binds to DNA at a site adjacent to a regulatory protein-binding site, thus leading to enhanced degradation of the regulatory protein. In agreement with this model, some early studies have suggested that Lon controls the level of mRNA transcription from the E. coli gal operon (30Hua S.S. Markovitz A. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 122: 510-517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this case, polyP may modulate the function of Lon in transcriptional regulation. However, like Charette et al. (15Charette M.F. Henderson G.W. Doane L.L. Markovitz A. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 158: 195-201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we suspected that E. coli Lon is a DNA-binding protein with low specificity. Further investigations are required to clarify the role of Lon in transcriptional regulation. It remains unclear whether the main role of the DNA-binding ability of Lon is to prevent it from accessing and degrading substrate proteins or to mediate enhanced degradation of regulatory proteins. In any event, the drastic change in intracellular polyP levels that occurs during nutritional downshift can affect the DNA-binding ability of Lon and its regulation of cellular functions."
https://openalex.org/W1969959095,"Development of normal colon epithelial cells proceeds through a systematic differentiation of cells that emerge from stem cells within the base of colon crypts. Genetic mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene are thought to cause colon adenoma and carcinoma formation by enhancing colonocyte proliferation and impairing differentiation. We currently have a limited understanding of the cellular mechanisms that promote colonocyte differentiation. Herein, we present evidence supporting a lack of retinoic acid biosynthesis as a mechanism contributing to the development of colon adenomas and carcinomas. Microarray and reverse transcriptase-PCR analyses revealed reduced expression of two retinoid biosynthesis genes: retinol dehydrogenase 5 (RDH5) and retinol dehydrogenase L (RDHL) in colon adenomas and carcinomas as compared with normal colon. Consistent with the adenoma and carcinomas samples, seven colon carcinoma cell lines also lacked expression of RDH5 and RDHL. Assessment of RDH enzymatic activity within these seven cell lines showed poor conversion of retinol into retinoic acid when compared with normal cells such as normal human mammary epithelial cells. Reintroduction of wild type APC into an APC-deficient colon carcinoma cell line (HT29) resulted in increased expression of RDHL without affecting RDH5. APC-mediated induction of RDHL was paralleled by increased production of retinoic acid. Investigations into the mechanism responsible for APC induction of RDHL indicated that β-catenin fails to repress RDHL. The colon-specific transcription factor CDX2, however, activated an RDHL promoter construct and induced endogenous RDHL. Finally, the induction of RDHL by APC appears dependent on the presence of CDX2. We propose a novel role for APC and CDX2 in controlling retinoic acid biosynthesis and in promoting a retinoid-induced program of colonocyte differentiation.

Colon cancer arises from distinct genetic events that initiate and promote tumor formation. An inherited colon cancer predisposition, familial adenomatous polyposis, results from mutations in a single gene known as adenomatous polyposis coli (APC). 1The abbreviations used are: APC, adenomatous polyposis coli; RA, retinoic acid; RT, reverse transcription; TGF, transforming growth factor; RDH5, retinol dehydrogenase 5; RDHL, retinol dehydrogenase L; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; RSV, Rous sarcoma virus; TCF, T cell factor; LEF, lymphoid enhancer factor; TTNPB, 4-(E-2-(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-5,5,8,8-tetramethyl-2-naphthalenyl)-1-propenyl)benzoic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: APC, adenomatous polyposis coli; RA, retinoic acid; RT, reverse transcription; TGF, transforming growth factor; RDH5, retinol dehydrogenase 5; RDHL, retinol dehydrogenase L; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; RSV, Rous sarcoma virus; TCF, T cell factor; LEF, lymphoid enhancer factor; TTNPB, 4-(E-2-(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-5,5,8,8-tetramethyl-2-naphthalenyl)-1-propenyl)benzoic acid. This syndrome is characterized by the appearance of hundreds to thousands of colon adenomas in affected individuals. Recent investigations have generated a model describing downstream events controlled by APC. In the current model, APC regulates the activity of a transcriptional pathway that may control colonocyte proliferation (for a review, see Refs. 1Morin P.J. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 1021-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar and 2Polakis P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). It does so by regulating the levels of β-catenin, a protein found initially to function as a link between extracellular adhesion molecules and the cytoskeleton. It appears, however, that β-catenin also regulates transcription through a partnership with TCF/LEF transcription factors. In cells expressing functional APC, APC acts to repress β-catenin levels through regulation of ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. Low levels of β-catenin prevent activation of TCF/LEF. In cells harboring mutated APC, β-catenin accumulates. This accumulation allows assembly of β-catenin·TCF/LEF complexes and activation of the transcriptional capabilities of TCF/LEF (1Morin P.J.

In addition to sustained cell proliferation, colonocytes within adenomas and carcinomas display differentiation defects (9Potten C.S. Booth C. Pritchard D.M. Int. J. Exp. Pathol. 1997; 78: 219-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 10Karam S.M. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: D286-298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Wright N.A. Int. J. Exp.

Hasebe T. Fukushima S. Esumi H. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4743-4746PubMed Google Scholar), one of the three predominant, terminally differentiated cell types seen within normal colon crypts. Although APC/β-catenin pathway target genes such as c-myc and cyclin D1 offer mechanistic insights into disregulation of colonocyte proliferation, few of the current APC pathway target genes have easily identifiable roles in cellular differentiation.Retinoids are a class of small lipid mediators derived from vitamin A that have important roles in vision, cell growth, and embryonic development (15Noy N. Nau H. Blaner W.S. Retinoids: The Biochemical Basis of Vitamin A and Retinoid Action. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1999: 3-24Google Scholar, 16De Luca L.M. Darwiche N. Celli G. Kosa K. Jones C. Ross S. Chen L.C. Nutr. Rev. 1994; 52: S45-S52Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A number of studies implicate retinoids in normal colonocyte function and in the development of colon neoplasms. For example, vitamin A-deficient animals display abnormalities in many epithelial tissues, including colon (17Narisawa T. Reddy B.S. Wong C.Q. Weisburger J.H.

At a molecular level, vitamin A-deficient rats showed diminished expression of TGF-β2 in certain epithelial tissues, including intestinal mucosa (24Glick A.B. McCune B.K. Abdulkarem N. Flanders K.C. Lumadue J.A. Smith J.M. Sporn M.B. Development. 1991; 111: 1081-1086PubMed Google Scholar). Systemic administration of retinoic acid (RA) induced the expression of TGF-β2 and TGF-β3 in these animals. In other studies, retinoid analogs have proven effective in preventing 5-azoxymethane-induced colon carcinoma formation in rats (17Narisawa T. Reddy B.S. Wong C.Q. Weisburger J.H. Cancer Res. 1976; 36: 1379-1383PubMed Google Scholar, 25Zheng Y. Kramer P.M. Olson G. Lubet R.A. Steele V.E. Kelloff G.J.

Retinoids also induce markers of differentiation, inhibit cell growth, increase cell adhesion, reduce colony formation, block anchorage-independent growth, and suppress invasiveness in colon cancer cells (29Niles R.M.

Commun. 1999; 261: 572-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Finally, recent studies have demonstrated that RA can not only inhibit the transcriptional activity of β-catenin (33Easwaran V. Pishvaian M. Salimuddin Byers S. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1415-1418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but can also independently promote the translocation of β-catenin from the cytoplasm to the membrane (34Shah S. Pishvaian M.J. Easwaran V. Brown P.H. Byers S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25313-25322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These effects of RA on β-catenin function are thought to inhibit proliferation and promote differentiation, respectively (34Shah S. Pishvaian M.J. Easwaran V. Brown P.H. Byers S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25313-25322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Although these studies offer evidence supporting a role for retinoids in colonocyte function, the specific cellular controls governing retinoid response pathways remain undefined in colon tissues.In addition to the nuclear hormone receptors, retinoid responsiveness within cells is governed by retinoid availability (35Blaner W.S. Piantedosi R. Sykes A. Vogel S. Nau H. Blaner W.S. Retinoids: The Biochemical Basis of Vitamin A and Retinoid Action. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1999: 117-144Google Scholar, 36Vogel S. Gamble M.V. Blaner W.S. Nau H. Blaner W.S. Retinoids: The Biochemical Basis of Vitamin A and Retinoid Action. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1999: 31-84Google Scholar). For the most part, cells acquire retinoids in the form of retinol, an inactive precursor. Tissues must, therefore, convert retinol into RA in order to activate the network of nuclear receptors required to evoke retinoid transcriptional responses. The enzymes that catalyze these conversions fall into three distinct classes that include the alcohol dehydrogenases, the short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases, and the aldehyde dehydrogenases. Alcohol dehydrogenases and short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase enzymes convert retinol into the aldehyde, retinal. Further conversion of retinal into RA is carried out by the aldehyde dehydrogenase enzyme family. Enzymes in each class have broad substrate specificities and can oxidize or reduce many physiologically important alcohols or aldehydes including ethanol, steroids, and retinoids. The actions of RA, in turn, can be limited by catabolism via cytochrome P450 enzymes (35Blaner W.S. Piantedosi R. Sykes A. Vogel S. Nau H. Blaner W.S. Retinoids: The Biochemical Basis of Vitamin A and Retinoid Action. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1999: 117-144Google Scholar, 36Vogel S. Gamble M.V. Blaner W.S. Nau H. Blaner W.S. Retinoids: The Biochemical Basis of Vitamin A and Retinoid Action. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1999: 31-84Google Scholar). Although the biochemistry of these retinoid biosynthetic and metabolic enzymes is emerging, little is known about the regulation of these enzymes within tissues or specific cell types.In order to define the molecular pathways that may govern APC-dependent differentiation of colonocytes, we have analyzed gene expression profiles in colon adenomas and carcinomas compared with normal colon. Our analyses revealed that colon adenomas and carcinomas show consistent down-regulation of the RA biosynthetic enzymes retinol dehydrogenase 5 (RDH5) and retinol dehydrogenase-like (RDHL). Given that loss of RA biosynthetic genes may contribute to the lack of differentiation observed in colon adenomas and carcinomas, we investigated the regulatory mechanisms that control the expression of RDH5 and RDHL. We found in a survey of normal human tissues that, whereas both RDHL and RDH5 were expressed in the colon, RDHL expression appears relatively restricted to the colon. Reintroduction of APC into APC-deficient colon cancer cells induced RDHL expression. Furthermore, the intestinal specific transcription factor, CDX2, targets RDHL and acts synergistically with APC in the induction of RDHL. Since RA holds known differentiation properties, our data create a model wherein APC controls RA biosynthesis as a potential mechanism for regulating colonocyte differentiation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMicroarray Analysis—Microarray analyses were performed as described previously (37Karpf A.R. Peterson P.W. Rawlins J.T. Dalley B.K. Yang Q. Albertsen H. Jones D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14007-14012Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA was extracted from surgically excised and microdissected colon tissue samples using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Poly(A) RNA was selected using an Oligotex Kit (Qiagen). First-strand cDNA probes were generated by reverse transcription of 1 μg of purified mRNA with SuperScript II (Invitrogen) after the addition of Cy3-dCTP or Cy5-dCTP (Amersham Biosciences). Probes were purified and reconstituted in 30 μl of 5× SSC, 0.1% SDS, 0.1 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 50% formamide. After denaturation at 94 °C, the hybridization mix was deposited onto the slide under a coverslip.Hybridizations were performed overnight at 42 °C in a humidified chamber on glass slides displaying 4608 human genes in duplicate. In every case, RNA from adenoma or carcinoma tissue was compared with a pool of normal tissue RNA from six separate donors. Since RNA availability of most samples was limiting, most samples were only surveyed on our first slide (containing 4608 genes), which contained the RDH5 gene but not the RDHL gene. Since some of the samples (numbers 3, 6, 18, 22, and 25) contained plentiful RNA, we were able to survey their gene expression on our entire gene set (totaling 38,000 genes and including the RDHL gene). Following hybridization, slides were washed for 10 min in 1× SSC, 0.2% SDS and then for 20 min in 0.1× SSC, 0.2% SDS. Slides were dipped in distilled water and dried with compressed air, and the fluorescent hybridization signatures were captured using the “Avalanche” dual laser confocal scanner (Amersham Biosciences). Fluorescent intensities were quantified using ArrayVision 4.0 (Imaging Research). Differentially expressed genes were selected when the Log2 (Cy5 signal/Cy3 signal) exceeded 1.85-fold. This cut-off was selected based on the control comparisons examining normal colon versus normal colon samples. This value exceeds the variability seen in these control comparisons. Differential expression was determined using Student's t test for each gene in each comparison. The p value must not have exceeded 0.05.Quantitative RT-PCR—For colon samples, total RNA was isolated from 10 matched sets of frozen normal and adenoma or carcinoma tissue samples using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen). For HT29 APC- and LacZ-inducible cell lines, total RNA was harvested using Trizol (Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of total RNA using Superscript III (Invitrogen). PCR was performed using the Roche Light Cycler instrument and software, version 3.5 (Roche Applied Science). Intron-spanning primers (RDHL, forward (5′-TGGAAACTTGGCAGCCAGAA-3′) and reverse (5′-CCAGAGACCTTTCTCCCCAA-3′); RDH5, forward (5′-TTCTCTGACAGCCTGAGGCG-3′) and reverse (5′-TGCGCTGTTGCATTTTCAGG-3′); APC, forward (5′-AAAACGAGCACAGCGAAGAATAGC-3′) and reverse (5′-TCGTGTAGTTGAACCCTGACCAT-3′); 18 S rRNA, forward (5′-GGTGAAATTCTTGGACCGGC-3′) and reverse (5′-GACTTTGGTTTCCCGGAAGC-3′)) were designed to amplify 200-bp products and spanned at least one intron in order to rule out amplification from genomic DNA.PCR was performed in duplicate (or triplicate for 18 S rRNA) with a master mix consisting of cDNA template, buffer (500 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 2.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 30 mm MgCl2), dNTPs (2 mm), TaqStart antibody (Clontech), Biolase DNA polymerase (Bioline), gene-specific forward and reverse primers (10 μm), and SYBR Green I (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). The PCR conditions are as follows: 35 cycles of amplification with 1-s denaturation at 95 °C and 5-s annealing at 54 °C for RDHL, 58 °C for RDH5, 60 °C for cyclin D, and 53 °C for 18 S rRNA. A template-free negative control was included in each experiment.The copy number was measured by comparing gene amplification with the amplification of standard samples that contained 103 to 107 copies of the gene or 105 to 109 for 18 S rRNA. The relative expression level of each gene was calculated by averaging the replicates and then dividing the average copy number of gene X by the average copy number of 18 S rRNA. The S.E. value of the ratios was calculated using a confidence interval.Cell Culture and Drug Treatments—HT29, HCT116, and RKO colon adenocarcinoma cells were cultured as recommended by the American Type Culture Collection. HT29 APC-inducible and LacZ-inducible cells were kindly provided by Dr. Bert Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Baltimore, MD).Transfections and Luciferase Assays—Fugene 6 (Roche Applied Science) and LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) were used to transfect HCT116 cells and RKO cells, respectively, according to the manufacturers' protocols. Cells were seeded at a density of 100,000 cells/well in 12-well plates and transfected the next day. Transfections were performed using 0.6 μg of DNA (including 0.06 μg of normalization vector, 0.12 μg of reporter vector, and 0.42 μg of expression vector), and, in the absence of further treatment, cells were harvested 24 h after the start of transfection. In certain experiments, medium containing charcoal-stripped serum as well as either RA mixture (see above) or ethanol vehicle was added to cells 24 h after transfection, and cells were harvested 24 h after medium change. Luciferase values were analyzed using a Dual Luciferase Assay System (Promega). Transfection efficiencies were normalized by dividing the firefly luciferase activity by the Renilla luciferase activity for each sample. Data in each experiment are presented as the mean ± S.D. of duplicates from a representative experiment. All experiments were performed at least three times.Plasmids—Regions spanning –2228 to +1071 (in reference to the translational start site) of the RDHL promoter and –1637 to +83 of the RDH5 promoter were PCR-amplified from normal human genomic DNA (Clontech) using specific primers (RDHL, forward (5′-GAAGATACACTTGGGTAGAAG-3′) and reverse (5′-ACACCAGTTCCCATTTCCTACTC-3′); RDH5, forward (5′-GCTGCCTCCAGTCAGGTTAC-3′) and reverse (5′-TTACCTCTCTGTGGCGAAAGC-3′)). PCR products were then inserted upstream of the firefly luciferase gene in the pGL3basic vector (Promega) to create RDHL:LUC and RDH5:LUC, respectively. PRL:LUC contains –36 to +36 of the prolactin gene driving expression of the luciferase gene and was kindly provided by Dr. Andrew Thorburn (Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, NC). The CDX1 and CDX2 expression vectors were constructed by RT-PCR from normal colon RNA using specific primers (CDX1, forward (5′-GCGCGGATCCATGTATGTGGGCTATGTGC-3′) and reverse (5′-GCGCGAATTCCTATGGCAGAAACTCCTCT-3′); CDX2, forward (5′-GCGCGGATCCATGTACGTGAGCTACCTC-3′) and reverse (5′-GCGCGAATTCTCACTGGGTGACGGTGG-3′)). The RT-PCR products were then cloned into a pCDNA3.1 His C vector (Invitrogen). The β-catenin S37A and DN-LEF expression vectors were kindly provided by Dr. Donald Ayer (University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT). For luciferase assays, RDH5:LUC or RDHL:LUC reporters were co-transfected with a Rous sarcoma virus (RSV)-Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid that was used to normalize transfection efficiencies.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—22-Mer oligonucleotides representing –338 to –359 in the RDHL promoter containing putative CDX2 sites were annealed and 5′-end-labeled with [α-32P]ATP using T4 kinase (MBI Fermentas). The labeled oligonucleotides were then purified over a micro Bio-spin 6 column (Bio-Rad) to remove unincorporated nucleotides. For binding reactions, 6 μg of extract from 293 cells overexpressing CDX2 were incubated with 1 μl (50,000–200,000 cpm) of 32P-labeled probe in a 10-μl final volume of 1× binding buffer (20% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 250 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 0.25 mg/ml poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC)). For competition and supershift assays, a 10- or 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide or 2 μg of anti-His tag antibody or anti-CDX2 antibody were added 15 min prior to the addition of labeled oligonucleotide. Complexes were separated on a 6% acrylamide gel in 1× TBE at 250 V for 3 h. The gel was then dried and exposed to a phosphor screen and visualized on a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences).Northern Blotting—Total RNA was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen) followed by poly(A) RNA selection using a Poly(A) Tract mRNA Isolation kit (Promega). Poly(A) RNA was fractionated through formaldehyde-containing agarose gels and transferred onto nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Probes were generated using the Rediprime II random prime labeling system (Amersham Biosciences) supplemented with [α-32P]dCTP. Hybridizations with 32P-labeled probes were carried out using ULTRAhyb buffer (Ambion) as recommended by the manufacturer.RA Extraction and HPLC Analysis—Cells were treated with 100 nmol ATROL at 80–90% confluence for 12 h. Medium was removed, and cells were scraped into PBS for protein quantification. After the addition of 100 nmol of internal standard TTNPB, the medium was acidified with 6 n HCl (0.03× volume) and extracted with an equal volume of hexane containing 0.1 mg/ml butylated hydroxytoluene. The resulting solution was mixed vigorously and spun down at 11,500 rpm for 20 min. Following centrifugation, the organic phase was transferred to a glass vial, dried under nitrogen, and reconstituted in 100 μl of 1:1 Me2SO/MeOH for HPLC analysis. Extracted RA is expressed as pmol of RA/mg of protein/mmol of TTNPB.Retinoid analysis and quantification was performed using a reversed phase Phenomenex Luna C18, 4.6 × 250 mm, 5μ particle size analytical column. Retinoids were eluted with a gradient starting at 80% acetonitrile, 20% ammonium acetate, pH 5.0, to 100% acetonitrile in 40 min, with a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min at 350 nm. Identification of retinoid peaks from the extracts was done by comparing elution positions with matching retinoid standards. Quantification of extracted retinoids was performed by relating the area of the peak to areas obtained by the analysis of known quantities of retinoid standards.RESULTSRetinol Dehydrogenases Are Down-regulated in Neoplastic Colon—In order to identify signaling pathway alterations in neoplastic colon, we performed microarray expression analyses on colon adenomas and carcinomas in comparison with a pool of normal colon tissue. A striking feature of our colon tumor progression data was that ∼80% of the differentially expressed genes were down-regulated in adenoma and carcinoma tissues as compared with normal (data not shown). Two genes in particular showing down-regulation in colon adenomas and carcinomas caught our attention. The first gene encoded RDH5, an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of retinol into retinal. The second gene encoded RDHL, a recently described, novel retinol dehydrogenase (described by Soref et al. (38Soref C.M. Di Y.P. Hayden L. Zhao Y.H. Satre M.A. Wu R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24194-24202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), but referred to as hRDH-TBE). Each of these genes was down-regulated at least 2-fold in ∼70% of both adenoma and carcinoma tissues relative to normal (Fig. 1A).Due to small tissue sizes and correspondingly low yields of mRNA samples, we obtained limited data on RDHL by microarray (see “Experimental Procedures”). We thus used quantitative RT-PCR to assess the expression levels of RDH5 and RDHL in an additional 10 patient-matched normal and carcinoma colon tissues. Fig. 1B shows that expression of RDHL was decreased at least 2-fold in 9 of 10 carcinoma samples in comparison with the matched, normal appearing colon tissue, whereas RDH5 was decreased in 6 of 10 samples examined. As a positive marker for distinguishing colon carcinoma from normal, cyclin D1 expression levels were increased in each of the carcinoma samples relative to normal (data not shown) (39Bartkova J. Lukas J. Strauss M. Bartek J. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 58: 568-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 40Arber N. Hibshoosh H. Moss S.F. Sutter T. Zhang Y. Begg M. Wang S. Weinstein I.B.

We also noted the loss of tags corresponding to RDHL in two colon carcinoma sample data sets deposited into the SAGE (serial analysis of gene expression) data base, an observation recently reported by Buckhaults et al. (41Buckhaults P. Rago C. St. Croix B. Romans K.E. Saha S. Zhang L. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W.

Here, we present comparative proteomic analyses of Leishmania major parasites that have been either shocked with or selected in vitro for high level resistance to the model antifolate drug methotrexate. Numerous differentially expressed proteins were identified by these experiments. Some were associated with the stress response, whereas others were found to be overexpressed due to genetic linkage to primary resistance mediators present on DNA amplicons. Several proteins not previously associated with resistance were also identified. The role of one of these, methionine adenosyltransferase, was confirmed by gene transfection and metabolite analysis. After a single exposure to low levels of methotrexate, L. major methionine adenosyltransferase transfectants could grow at high concentrations of the drug. Methotrexate resistance was also correlated to increased cellular S-adenosylmethionine levels. The folate and S-adenosylmethionine regeneration pathways are intimately connected, which may provide a basis for this novel resistance phenotype.

Leishmania, a protozoan parasite transmitted by the bite of a sandfly, can cause a species-dependent spectrum of disease ranging from cutaneous lesions (Leishmania major) to potentially fatal visceral infections (Leishmania donovani). With an estimated 12 million cases of leishmaniasis worldwide and 1.5-2 million new cases reported each year (1Herwaldt B.L. Lancet. 1999; 354: 1191-1199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar), this parasite has a significant impact on human populations. Leishmania is transmitted to the host as a motile, elongated promastigote, whereupon it is engulfed by a macrophage and transforms into a round, non-motile amastigote able to spread within the host. The parasite is primarily found in South America, Asia, southern Europe, and Africa, but recent reports have confirmed the visceral form of the disease in dogs in 21 U. S. states and in Canada (2Gaskin A.A. Schantz P. Jackson J. Birkenheuer A. Tomlinson L. Gramiccia M. Levy M. Steurer F. Kollmar E. Hegarty B.C. Ahn A. Breitschwerdt E.B. J. Vet. Intern. Med. 2002; 16: 34-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Antimony-containing compounds are by far the most commonly prescribed antileishmanial therapies, but in some regions up to 80% of cases exhibit clinical resistance to these drugs (3Sundar S. Trop.

The folate biosynthetic and reduction pathways in Leishmania contain several elements not found in mammalian cells and are under intense scrutiny for drug development. Antifolates, such as the folate analogue methotrexate (MTX), 1The abbreviations used are: MTX, methotrexate; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; DHFR-TS, dihydrofolate (DHF) reductase-thymidylate synthase; MAT, methionine adenosyltransferase; SAM, S-adenosylmethionine; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; DIG, digoxigenin; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; PGFS, Prostaglandin F synthase. have been successful in the treatment of several diseases as well as some cancers (for review, see Ref. 4Ouellette M. Leblanc E. Kundig C. Papadopoulou B. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1998; 456: 99-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) but have not yet been successful against Leishmania. One of the reasons for this is the ease with which the parasite is able to manipulate expression of its genes. Leishmania strains insensitive to MTX display a variety of primary resistance mechanisms. These include amplification of the dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase (DHFR-TS) gene (5Coderre J.A.

The 34-megabase genome of the human pathogen L. major Friedlin has been sequenced by a consortium of laboratories (www.genedb.org). Many of its genes have no homologues in other organisms, and these may yield Leishmania-specific drug targets. Because of the number of unique open reading frames found in this organism as well as the complexity of the mechanisms of resistance exhibited by the parasite, a global analysis of the phenomenon of drug resistance is warranted. In a previous preliminary study we used a comparative proteomic approach to show increased levels of PTR1 in a L. major strain selected for MTX resistance in vitro (13Drummelsmith J. Brochu V. Girard I. Messier N. Ouellette M. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2003; 2: 146-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This was the first identification of a primary resistance mechanism using a proteomic approach and as such validated the use of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis in further studies of resistance. Here we describe the results of detailed proteomic analyses of MTX exposure and resistance in L. major. Through these studies we have found altered expression of proteins involved in the stress response and in primary resistance mechanisms but also of proteins with less easily predicted roles in resistance. One of these corresponds to the methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT) protein, which is overexpressed both in sensitive cells shocked with MTX as well as in mutants resistant to the drug. We present evidence that the MAT protein and its product, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), play previously unappreciated roles in MTX resistance. Cell Culture—L. major LV39, mutants MTX60.2 (13Drummelsmith J. Brochu V. Girard I. Messier N. Ouellette M. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2003; 2: 146-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and MTX60.4 (14Guimond C. Trudel N. Brochu C. Marquis N. El Fadili A. Peytavi R. Briand G. Richard D.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 5886-5896Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and transfectants were grown in M199 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Wisent) and 5 μg/ml hemin (ICN). Where appropriate, MTX, paromomycin (Sigma), SbIII, and/or zeocin (Invitrogen) were added. Cultures were incubated at 25 °C. Two Dimensional Sample Preparation and Electrophoresis—Cultures were grown to late log phase as determined by optical density at 600 nm. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2500 × g, washed twice in HEPES-NaCl buffer, and resuspended in two-dimensional lysis buffer (7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 40 mm Tris, 4% CHAPS, 0.1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysis was allowed to proceed for 2 h at room temperature, and samples were centrifuged to remove insoluble material. Protein concentration was assayed using the 2D Quant Kit (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were separated into aliquots and stored at -80 °C. In the first dimension samples were run on 18-cm Immobiline Dry-Strips (Amersham Biosciences) on an IPGPhor isoelectric focusing system as recommended by the manufacturer. Strips were equilibrated in equilibration buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.8, 6 m urea, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS, trace of bromphenol blue) containing 10 mg/ml dithiothreitol for 15 min and then in equilibration buffer containing 25 mg/ml iodoacetamide for 15 min and sealed to 12% acrylamide gels using 0.5% agarose in standard Tris-glycine electrophoresis buffer. Second dimension SDS-PAGE was run in a Hoefer DALT apparatus (Amersham Biosciences) at 40 mA/gel and 15 °C until the tracking dye was run off the gel. Gel Staining, Imaging, and Image Analysis—Proteins were visualized by Sypro Ruby fluorescence (Molecular Dynamics). Gels were fixed overnight in 40% methanol, 7% acetic acid. Gels were stained overnight and then destained in 10% methanol, 7% acetic acid for 3 × 1 h. Gels were imaged with the ProXpress scanner (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 100-μm resolution using 480-nm excitation and 620-nm emission filters. Two-dimensional gels of four independent samples per strain or condition were averaged and compared using Progenesis software (Non-linear Dynamics). Significance of differences observed were determined by the Student's two-tailed t test in Microsoft Excel. Mass Spectrometry—Gel plugs containing the proteins of interest were excised manually and sent for peptide mass fingerprinting (Eastern Quebec Proteomics Centre, Centre Hospitalier de l'Université Laval, Québec). Samples were prepared as described previously (13Drummelsmith J. Brochu V. Girard I. Messier N. Ouellette M. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2003; 2: 146-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Mass spectra were acquired on a Voyager-DE PRO MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) operating in the positive-ion reflector delayed-extraction mode. Protein identifications were obtained using MASCOT (MatrixScience) and searching for matching peptide mass fingerprints in a protein data base (Leishpep 300104) generated by annotation of L. major Friedlin sequence information, available through the GeneDB website (www.genedb.org). The search criteria used were complete carboxamidomethylation of cysteine, partial methionine oxidation, and mass deviation smaller than 60 ppm. A score of greater than 51 was considered significant (p < 0.05). Peptide tandem mass spectra were obtained by capillary liquid chromatography coupled to an LCQ DecaXP (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA) quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer with a nanospray interface as described previously (13Drummelsmith J. Brochu V. Girard I. Messier N. Ouellette M. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2003; 2: 146-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The resulting peptide MS/MS spectra were interpreted using the SEQUEST algorithm (15Eng J.K. McCormack A.L. Yates III, J.R. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5472) Google Scholar) and searched against proteins in the Leishpep data base. Partial carboxamidomethylation of cysteine and oxidation of methionine were considered in the search. A protein was considered a good match if at least two peptides were confidently identified. Confident identification of a peptide required a cross-correlation score of 1.9, 2.5, and 3.7 for singly, doubly, and triply charged peptides, respectively. Each peptide identification was confirmed by manual inspection of the spectrum. DNA Methods—Genes of interest were amplified by PCR from L. major LV39 genomic DNA using the proofreading polymerase Pwo (Roche Applied Science). Primers used were: for MAT, JD6, 5′-CCT TCC GCA CTA GTC ACA GTC C-3′, and JD7, 5′-CGG CAC ACC TCG AATTCG AT-3′; for ARGG, JD 17, 5′-ACA CTT CCC CAT TTC TAG ACT CC-3′, and JD 18, 5′-GGG CGC AAG CTT TGT AAG TAG T-3′; for PGFS, JD15, 5′-CGC GAG CTT GTT GAA AGC TTA A-3′, and JD16, 5′-TCC CTT TTC TAG AAT CGT TGA CTG-3′; for MORN, JD19, 5′-CTG TCC CTC CTC TAG ATC CCT ATT T-3′, and JD20, 5′-GCG ACC GAT GAT AAA GCT TGA G-3′; for acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, LmjF06.0880F, 5′-CGC CAA GGA GAA GAT GAT CC-3′, and LmjF06.0880R, 5′-CAT CTT GGA GCC GTT GAT GA-3′. Nucleotides that have been altered to incorporate restriction sites are underlined. The products MAT, PGFS, and MORN were cloned into the Leishmania expression vector pSPαNEOα, encoding paromomycin/G418 resistance (6Papadopoulou B. Roy G. Ouellette M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3601-3608Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), or pSPαZEOα, encoding zeomycin resistance. The resulting plasmids were transfected into L. major LV39 by electroporation as described previously (6Papadopoulou B. Roy G. Ouellette M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3601-3608Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) and maintained with 1 mg/ml paromomycin or 5 μg/ml zeocin. Transfections were confirmed by Southern hybridization. Southern and Northern Hybridization—Genomic DNA was prepared from Leishmania cells using DNAzol (Invitrogen). DNA was digested with appropriate restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's recommendations, and the resulting fragments were separated on a 0.7% agarose gel using digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled DNA Molecular Weight Marker II (Roche Applied Science) as a size standards. RNA for northern blotting was run on denaturing agarose gels containing formaldehyde and formamide. RNA samples were prepared from Leishmania cells using RNAzol (Invitrogen) and were denatured at 65 °C for 15 min and chilled on ice before loading. Probes were generated by PCR and random prime-labeled with DIG-High Prime (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's directions. The gels were blotted to positively charged nylon membrane (Roche Applied Science), UV-cross-linked using a Spectrolinker XL-1000 cross-linker (Spectronics), hybridized with the appropriate probe, detected with anti-DIG-AP Fab fragments and CDP-Star (Roche Applied Science), and exposed to x-ray film, all according to the manufacturer's directions. Blots to be reprobed were stripped by pouring boiling 0.1% SDS on the membranes and shaking at room temperature for 10 min. Membranes were rinsed and stored wet. SAM Extraction and HPLC Analysis—Leishmania cultures were harvested in late log phase and washed in HEPES-NaCl. Three independent cultures were grown for each condition. Cell pellets were weighed, resuspended in 2 volumes of 0.4 m HClO4, and incubated on ice for 20 min. Supernatants were passed through a 0.45-μm filter, separated into aliquots, and stored at -80 °C. Metabolites were separated by HPLC by a modification of the method of Wang et al. (16Wang W. Kramer P.M. Yang S. Pereira M.A. Tao L. J. Chromatogr. B. Biomed. Appl. 2001; 762: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) using a Schimadzu HPLC system and Prevail C18 column (250 × 4.6-mm inner diameter, 5-μm particle size; Alltech) and detected at 254 nm. The mobile phase consisted of two solvents: solvent A, 8 mm octanesulfonic acid and 25 mm NaH2PO4, pH 3.0; solvent B, 100% HPLC-grade methanol. Solvents were passed through a 0.45-μm filter before use. The column was equilibrated at 72% solvent A, 28% solvent B before use. Samples (20 μl) were injected, and conditions were held at 28% solvent B for 3 min. Then, solvent B was increased to 35% over 3 min and held there for 19 min before initial conditions were re-established. SAM was identified by co-chromatography with a SAM standard. A standard curve for quantitation was achieved by integration of peak areas of known quantities of SAM, and experimental peak areas were compared with this curve to determine pmol of SAM/mg of wet cell weight. Differences were analyzed using either parametric or non-parametric Student's 2-tailed t tests, the choice of which was determined by the F-test for equality of variances. Comparative Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis Analysis of L. major LV39 Wild Type and in Vitro-derived MTX-resistant Mutants—Two independent mutants of L. major, MTX60.2 and MTX60.4, were selected for resistance to MTX. These strains were able to grow in 60 μm MTX, whereas the EC50 for the wild type strain is 0.05-0.1 μm. Initial two-dimensional gel electrophoresis analysis identified one highly overexpressed protein in mutant MTX60.2 that corresponded to PTR1, a known primary MTX resistance mechanism (6Papadopoulou B. Roy G. Ouellette M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3601-3608Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 7Callahan H.L. Beverley S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24165-24168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The success of these initial analyses prompted us to perform a more detailed comparison of these mutants using narrow-range IPG strips. Gels of four independent samples were run and averaged and compared using the two-dimensional gel analysis software package Progenesis. Representative gels of two different pH ranges analyzed, pH 4.5-5.5 and 5.0-6.0, are shown in Fig. 1A. Fig. 1B shows a difference found using gels of pH range 3-10. Differences of greater than 2-fold identified by the software were individually validated and are marked. Spots of interest were excised from the gels and identified by mass spectrometry, and the results are listed in Table I. Quantitative differences in mutant strains are mostly due to protein overexpression as opposed to down-regulation. Only spot 1173 decreased in the mutants (Table I, Fig. 1A). Also, several of the proteins identified, such as chaperonins, antioxidants, and heat-shock proteins may have been involved in response to stress induced by drug selection. Finally, some proteins, such as PTR1 or the argininosuccinate synthase ARGG, are exclusively found in the mutant MTX60.2, whereas acyl-CoA dehydrogenase is expressed only in MTX60.4. However, most of the differences noted such as MAT and enolase are found in both strains, indicating that even in cases where distinct primary resistance mechanisms have evolved, other responses to MTX are conserved.Table IProteins differentially expressed in LV39 mutants resistant to MTX versus the sensitive parent as identified by MALDI-TOF or MS/MSMS IDMr (exp/pred)pI (exp/pred)IDAccession no.No. peaks /% coverageMASCOT score-Fold change60.260.4116066/605.2/5.3Cpn60LmjF36.203012/23766.3 (p < 0.003)5.5 (p < 0.020)116150/815.0/5.1Hsp83-1, N-terminal fragmentLmjF33.036010/1542aAlthough these scores are below the cut-off, this can be accounted for by modification and/or in vivo proteolytic fragmentation (note the differences between the experimental and predicted Mr).4.5 (p < 0.012)6.2 (p < 0.011)116235/?5.1/?No ID2.2 (p < 0.268)5.8 (p < 0.135)116335/215.1/6.4Thiol-specific antioxidantLmjF15.11404/24622.4 (p < 0.037)4.2 (p < 0.017)116417/504.7/4.7α-Tubulin fragmentLmjF13.02803/1931aAlthough these scores are below the cut-off, this can be accounted for by modification and/or in vivo proteolytic fragmentation (note the differences between the experimental and predicted Mr).3.1 (p < 0.185)4.1 (p < 0.043)116566/725.3/5.7Mitochondrial HSP70LmjF30.247019/28803bThese identifications were obtained by MS/MS.8.2 (p < 0.038)4.9 (p < 0.050)66/695.3/5.4Paraflagellar rod protein 2CLmjF16.143010/19459bThese identifications were obtained by MS/MS.116646/445.6/5.6MAT (AdoMetS)LmjF30.352012/351062.9 (p < 0.014)2.2 (p < 0.217)116746/475.6/5.6EnolaseLmjF14.116012/351175.4 (p < 0.006)3.8 (p < 0.059)116845/475.6/5.6ARG GLmjF23.026016/5316316.2 (p < 1e-4)1.3 (p < 0.639)116940/505.3/4.7β-tubulinLmjF21.186013/291343.8 (p < 0.010)2.9 (p < 0.034)117040/415.1/5.3MORNLmjF30.33105/15167bThese identifications were obtained by MS/MS.10.4 (p < 0.016)6.6 (p < 0.016)117134/325.9/5.9Prostaglandin F2-α synthaseLmjF31.2150c8/27814.0 (p < 0.011)3.7 (p < 0.001)117231/725.1/5.3HSP70 fragmentLmjF28.277010/15781.5 (p < 0.307)3.4 (p < 0.002)117326/?5.4/?No ID3.0 (p < 0.015)−1.6 (p < 0.067)117445/475.5/5.6Argininosuccinate synthaseLmjF23.026010/2890ucu, unique spot.Not present198545/487.2/8.0Acyl-CoA dehydrogenaseLmjF06.088012/1864Not presentu894dIdentified in Drummelsmith et al.

Open table in a new tab Analysis of the Initial Responses of L. major to MTX by Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—The above analysis of MTX-resistant mutants raised the possibility that several of the differences noted could in fact be due to exposure to MTX as opposed to resistance per se. Such changes in protein expression could also represent initial steps in the acquisition of resistance or perhaps an early protective response that allows time for the parasite to express an effective resistance mechanism. To visualize these changes two analyses were carried out. In the first, wild type cultures were grown to mid-log phase and then exposed to 1000× the EC50 of MTX (100 μm) for 24 h. In the second proteins were extracted from wild type cells grown in the presence of 1× the EC50 of MTX (100 nm MTX). In both cases samples were compared with proteins extracted from wild type cells grown in the absence of drug exposure. Because this exposure to drug causes a decrease in growth rate, care was taken to attempt to harvest cells from the same phase of growth. Representative gels (spanning pH 4-6.7) from this analysis are shown in Fig. 2. Several differences between spots that had been identified in previous analyses (Hsp70, Cpn60) were noted (Fig. 2). Spots whose identity was unknown or whose positions made matches uncertain were excised from the gels and subjected to mass spectrometric identification and are shown in Table II. No trace of PTR1 was seen in these gels, suggesting that although this is a primary resistance mechanism, it is not involved in the initial response to MTX. Expression levels for most of the spots altered in these analyses showed the same trends in both treatments, although this was not always the case. Interestingly, several of the protein changes noted in this analysis were the same as those seen in the analysis of resistant mutants (Table I). This was expected in the case of stress response proteins such as heat-shock proteins, antioxidants, and chaperonins but was somewhat unexpected in the case of MAT.Table IIProteins differentially expressed in LV39 wild type cells either shocked with high levels of MTX (shock) or grown in the EC50 of the drug (growth) as identified by MALFI-TOF MSMS IDMr (exp/pred)PI (exp/pred)IDAccession no.No. peaks/%coverageMASCOT score-Fold changeGrowthShock136955/475.8/5.6EnolaseLmjF14.116016/421292.6 (p<0.005)2.6 (p < 0.003)137050/425.5/5.4Actin aLmjF04.123011/34852.0 (p < 7.5e−4)−1.2 (p < 0.496)50/955.5/5.8Elongation factor 2 fragmentLmjF36.018013/1562137147/436.2/5.6MAT (AdoMetS)LmjF30.352011/241123.6 (p < 1.8e−4)2.4 (p < 0.016)137245/426.2/6.0Aldose-1-epimeraseLmjF35.09707/2355uu137345/455.2/6.5Succinyl-CoA ligase, β-subunit, putativeLmjF36.295014/29123uNot present137538/?5.3/?No ID−2.8 (p < 2.3e−6)−1.4 (p < 0.033)137633/?5.7/?No ID2.1 (p < 0.011)2.3 (p < 0.028)137731/?5.2/?No ID4.0 (p < 0.001)2.5 (p < 0.032)137830/295.2/5.5Hypothetical predicted proteinLmjF36.67607/3155−1.8 (p < 0.148)−4.3 (p < 0.076)137930/256.1/6.1GTP-binding protein, putativeLmjF25.1420c10/4587uu138028/225.7/6.3Thiol-specific antioxidantLmjF15.11605/33702.3 (p < 0.003)1.6 (p < 0.006)138128/?4.8/?No ID−3.2 (p < 0.039)−2.2 (p < 0.071)138227/226.0/6.3Thiol-specific antioxidantLmjF15.11605/33582.4 (p < 0.002)1.9 (p < 0.078)138422/225.7/6.3Thiol-specific antioxidantLmjF15.10805/33582.0 (p < 0.030)−1.4 (p < 0.408)138522/?5.0/?No ID−7.0 (p < 8.7e−4)−3.7 (p < 0.003) Open table in a new tab Overexpression by Gene Amplification and Linkage to Resistance Mediators—ARGG (spots 1168 and 1174) catalyzes the penultimate step in arginine biosynthesis. This protein is highly overexpressed in mutant MTX60.2 but not in mutant MTX60.4 (Table I). Leishmania often uses gene amplification to respond to drug pressure (17Beverley S.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1991; 45: 417-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 18Borst P. Ouellette M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1995; 49: 427-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Southern hybridization revealed that the ARGG gene was greatly amplified in strain MTX60.2 compared with the wild type (Fig. 3A). The PTR1 protein overexpression observed in MTX60.2 is also correlated to amplification of the gene (Fig. 3B). This raised the possibility that there are multiple amplicons in strain 60.2. However, it has been known for a long time that ARGG and PTR1 are physically linked in Leishmania tarentolae (19Ouellette M. Papadopoulou B. Parasitol. Today. 1993; 9: 150-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Sequencing of the L. major genome indicated that ARGG and PTR1 genes are also closely linked on chromosome 23 in this species and are in fact separated by a segment of only 4.4 kilobases. Therefore, ARGG is most likely overexpressed due to the proximity of its structural gene to that of PTR1 and, thus, its inclusion on the same DNA amplicon. Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase overexpression is seen solely in mutant MTX60.4 (Table I). This overexpression is also correlated to gene amplification (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, in L. major this gene is 4.6 kilobases downstream of DHFR-TS on chromosome 6 (www.genedb.org). The DHFR-TS gene, coding for the primary target of MTX, was also found to be amplified in this mutant (Fig. 3D). Prostaglandin F Synthase, MAT, MORN, and Enolase Are Overexpressed in Both Resistant Mutants—Several proteins were found to be overexpressed in both independent MTX mutants studied. One of these, enolase, is part of the glycolytic pathway. Overexpression of several glycolytic enzymes, including enolase, has been observed to result from various stresses such as heat shock or osmotic stress (20Prasad J. McJarrow P. Gopal P. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 69: 917-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 21Forsthoefel N.R. Cushman M.A. Cushman J.C.

Cell Death Differ. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), and thus, its presence is probably not related specifically to MTX resistance. There were also several proteins whose presence could not be accounted for by stress responses. Prostaglandin F synthase (PGFS) activity has only recently been described in Leishmania (23Kabututu Z.

The mechanisms behind regulation of TLR2 protein expression are still not well understood. By using a newly developed monoclonal antibody against mouse TLR2, we detected TLR2 protein expression on macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells. Endogenous macrophage TLR2 localized mostly to the cell membrane, with particular accumulation around phagosomes containing zymosan. Treatment of macrophages with the TLR2 antibody diminished cellular response to lipoproteins and down-regulated membrane TLR2. Marked up-regulation of surface TLR2 was observed on macrophages in response to whole bacteria, lipoproteins, lipopolysaccharide, poly(I-C) (double-stranded RNA), R848, and CpG DNA, and this up-regulation appeared to be a very sensitive marker for the presence of microbial products. Up-regulation of TLR2 in response to stimuli correlated with an increased response to secondary lipoprotein exposure following a low concentration of primary lipoprotein challenge. By comparison, exposure to a larger primary challenge induced a hyporeactive state. Most interestingly, lipopolysaccharide- and double-stranded RNA-induced up-regulation of surface TLR2 in macrophages was found to be MyD88-independent, whereas the up-regulation in response to lipoproteins, R848, and CpG DNA was absent in MyD88-deficient cells. We conclude that complex mechanisms regulate expression and signaling via TLR2. Up-regulation of TLR2 in the presence of low, yet clinically relevant amounts of microbial products may be an important mechanism by which the immune system boosts its response to a beginning infection.

Ingalls R.R. Crit. Care Med. 2002; 30: S1-S11Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Thirteen toll-like receptors, TLR1-13, have been identified to date. These are transmembrane proteins, consisting of an extracellular leucine-rich repeat domain, and a cytoplasmic domain sharing homology with the mammalian IL-1 receptor (4Rock F.L. Hardiman G.

TLR4 recognizes enterobacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (6Poltorak A. He X.L. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Van Huffel C. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M.

Genes Immun. 2003; 4: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). TLR3 recognizes double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and the viral dsRNA mimic, synthetic polyinosine-polycytidylic acid (poly(I-C)) (8Alexopoulou L. Holt A.C. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Nature. 2001; 413: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (4875) Google Scholar), and TLR5 initiates responses toward flagellin (9Hayashi F. Smith K.D. Ozinsky A. Hawn T.R. Yi E.C. Goodlett D.R. Eng J.K.

Viral single-stranded RNA and the antiviral compounds imiquimod and resiquimod are ligands for TLR7 and TLR8, whereas bacterial DNA and synthetic unmethylated oligonucleotides containing CpG-dinucleotides (CpG) are recognized by TLR9 (10Hemmi H.

Recently, mouse TLR11 was identified as a participant in defense against uropathogenic bacteria (11Zhang D.K. Zhang G.L. Hayden M.S. Greenblatt M.B. Bussey C. Flavell R.A. Ghosh S. Science. 2004; 303: 1522-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). The ligands for human TLR10 (12Chuang T.H. Ulevitch R.J. Biochim. Biophys.

TLR signaling via the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) mainly involves the shared Toll-IL-1R resistance (TIR) domain, which recruits an adapter molecule, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), initiating a signaling cascade leading to activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and inhibitors of κB kinase (IKKα-β-γ). NF-κB is subsequently translocated to the nucleus, leading to expression of TNF, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 and maturation of antigen-presenting cells (14Barton G.M. Medzhitov R. Science. 2003; 300: 1524-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). TLR3 and TLR4 are, however, capable of signaling via MyD88-independent pathways, involving the adapter molecules TRIF (for TLR3 and TLR4) and TRAM (for TLR4) (15Lien E. Golenbock D.T. Nat. Immun. 2003; 4: 1162-1164Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). TLR2 displays particular broad ligand recognition, initiating responses toward Gram-positive bacteria and bacterial components such as peptidoglycan, lipoteichoic acid, and lipoproteins (16Yoshimura A.

Optimal response toward diacylated lipoproteins, such as the 2-kDa macrophage-activating lipoprotein (MALP-2), requires heterodimerization of TLR2 with TLR6, whereas heterodimerization of TLR2/TLR1 enhances responses toward triacylated lipopeptides such as Pam3-Cys-Ser-Lys4 (22Takeuchi O.

Other ligands recognized by TLR2 include zymosan, glycolipids from spirochetes, lipoarabinomannan, porins from Neisseria, and certain nonenterobacterial LPS, among others (3Lien E. Ingalls R.R. Crit.

Although several studies have been performed with respect to TLR2 expression in mice, the results have been based on detection of mRNA. We generated a unique anti-mouse TLR2 mAb and used it to characterize the expression and regulation of TLR2. We found surface expression of TLR2 primarily on mouse macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells, and the expression of TLR2 was significantly up-regulated in response to challenge with several TLR ligands. Of note was our observation that LPS- and poly(I-C)-induced up-regulation of TLR2 was found to be MyD88-independent.

Mouse-specific immunostimulatory synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides containing CpG dinucleotide motifs on a phosphorothioate backbone were purchased from TIB Molbiol, Adelphia, NJ (oligo 1668), or from Coley Pharmaceuticals, Wellesley, MA (oligo 1826). Stock solutions of stimulants were made up with endotoxin-free PBS to concentrations of 1-2 mg/ml. Lipopeptides, poly(I-C), R848, and CpG displayed similar stimulatory abilities toward wild type- and TLR4-deficient macrophages, indicating absence of contaminating LPS. Furthermore, LPS-induced cellular activation was not reduced in TLR2-/- macrophages compared with wild type cells, suggesting the absence of TLR2 ligands such as lipoproteins and peptidoglycan in the LPS preparations (not shown).

All CHO transfectants were cultured at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 20 μg/ml gentamicin and hygromycin B (400 units/ml). CHO/CD14/huTLR2, CHO/moTLR2, and CHO/CD14/moTLR2 additionally received G418 (0.5 mg/ml).

Generation of a Monoclonal Antibody Recognizing Mouse TLR2—Female Lewis rats (120-149 g), purchased from Møllergaard Breedings (Denmark), were immunized intraperitoneally with 2 × 106 CHO/moTLR2 cells in PBS on day 0, 14, and 30. Serum samples were collected, and the rat with the highest amount of antibodies binding CHO/moTLR2 cells was boosted with two intraperitoneal immunizations before removal of the spleen (3 days after the last immunization). Hybridomas were produced by fusing spleen cells and NSO/1 myeloma cells (a gift from Z. Eshhar, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel) and exposing cells to hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine selection. Hybridomas were screened for Ab production and specific binding to CHO/moTLR2 cells by flow cytometry. A selected hybridoma (clone 6C2) was subjected to two rounds of limiting dilution to secure monoclonality. The resulting 6C2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) was iso-typed as a rat IgG2bκ light chain, using reagents from Zymed Laboratories Inc.

Specific binding was detected with a PE-conjugated goat anti-rat secondary antibody (Caltag, Burlingame, CA). Alternatively, cells were stained directly with A488-conjugated 6C2- or A488-conjugated rat IgG. RAW 264.7 cells were also exposed to zymosan A (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) (roughly 10 yeast particles/cell), in 20% A+ human serum/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 5 min at 37 °C, 8% CO2, prior to intracellular staining as described. Cells were observed by confocal microscopy using an Axiovert 100-M inverted microscope (Zeiss), equipped with an LSM 510 laser-scanning unit and a ×63 1.4-NA plan Apochromat oil-immersion objective (Zeiss). Staining was visualized using a 488-nm argon laser line and the appropriate filters. Flow Cytometry Analysis—All steps were performed on ice. Adherent CHO transfectants were detached with trypsin/EDTA, washed in FACS buffer (PBS, 1% FCS), and labeled with the 6C2 mAb or control rat IgG antibody (5 μg/ml) for 30 min on ice. The cells were washed and stained with goat anti-rat phycoerythrin (PE) (10 μg/ml in PBS) for 30 min on ice. Unspecific binding of RAW 264.7 and primary mouse cells was blocked with Fc block (10 μg/ml) and unspecific rat IgG (50-100 μg/ml) for 15 min, followed by 30 min of incubation with specific primary antibodies (5 μg/ml). When biotin-labeled primary antibodies were used, cells were washed once before a 30-min incubation with SA-A633 (2 μg/ml). A final wash was performed before cells were subjected to flow cytometric analysis on a Coulter or BD-LSR instrument. Mice—Wild type C3H/HeN mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Germany), whereas wild type C57BL/6 mice were from The Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice genetically deficient in TLR2, TLR4, or MyD88 (43Takeuchi O. Hoshino K. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Takada H. Ogawa T. Takeda K. Akira S.

The genotype for each animal was verified by PCR. For comparisons, cells from sex- and age-matched animals (in general, less than 20 weeks of age) were used. Isolation of Mouse Primary Cells and Regulation Studies—Peritoneal macrophages were isolated after injecting 3 or 4% thioglycollate (Difco or Remel, Lenexa, KS) intraperitoneally (2 ml). Peritoneal exudate was collected 3-4 days later by washing the peritoneal cavity with ice-cold RPMI medium, followed by plating. After 2 h, cells were washed three times with PBS, and adherent cells were typically >95% F4/80 positive macrophages. Peritoneal neutrophil suspensions were harvested by lavage 4-5 h after intraperitoneal injection of thioglycollate (1.5 ml). Cells were typically 60-75% granulocytes (Gr-1 high), 15-25% macrophages (F4/80 positive), and the remaining were mostly B-cells (CD19 positive). Blood was collected by cardiac puncture using a heparin-containing syringe. Suspensions of thymus and spleen cells were filtered through 30-50-μm filters to remove cell clumps. Red cells were lysed by using an ammonium chloride-based buffer. Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells were generated by incubating femur and tibia bone marrow cells for 9 days in RPMI, 10% FCS, ciprofloxacin, 1× nonessential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.0004% 2-mercap-toethanol, and 10 ng/ml granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ). Medium was replaced every 3 days. For stimulation of peritoneal macrophages or dendritic cells, the cells were plated in 24- (4 × 105 cells/well) or 12-well (7 × 105 cells/well) dishes and stimulated as indicated. Antibody-induced Down-regulation of TLR2—RAW 264.7 cells (2.5 × 104 cells/well in 96-well plates) were pretreated with the 6C2 mAb, rat IgG2b isotype control, or medium for 20 h prior to stimulation with Pam3Cys (10 ng/ml) and LPS (50 ng/ml) for 6 h in triplicate. Cells were stained indirectly with 6C2, followed by secondary staining with PE-conjugated goat anti-rat Ab. Surface TLR2 expression was analyzed by flow cytometry. Supernatants were harvested and analyzed for TNF. Correlation of TLR2 Expression to Macrophage Responsiveness—Peritoneal macrophages were incubated with primary stimuli in triplicates for 18 h, followed by three washes with PBS. Cells were then either subjected to flow cytometry as indicated above or exposed to secondary stimuli for 10 h before supernatants were harvested and subjected to TNF ELISA. Generation of an Antibody against Mouse TLR2—Mouse models are important for the understanding of many disease processes. Despite being a central receptor in the immune response to infectious pathogens, information on TLR2 protein distribution and regulation in the mouse is scarce. In order to analyze TLR2 expression, we generated a monoclonal antibody against mouse TLR2. A clone called 6C2 (rat IgG2bκ) producing an antibody that stained CHO/moTLR2 cells but not parental CHO cells, was selected for further characterization. Flow cytometry studies showed that the 6C2 mAb stained CHO/CD14/moTLR2 cells but not CHO/CD14/huTLR2 cells, and it also stained the mouse macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 (Fig. 1A). Permeabilization of the macrophage cells had minimal influence on the antibody binding (not shown). Hence, 6C2 is a monoclonal antibody that recognizes endogenous and transfected mouse TLR2 and does not cross-react with human TLR2. The specificity of the Ab was further tested by immunoprecipitation. Lysates of 35S-labeled CHO/moTLR2 and CHO cells were immunoprecipitated with 6C2 or isotype control. The results (Fig. 1B) revealed a strong band slightly larger than 97 kDa in the lysate of CHO/moTLR2, which was not present in the lysate of parental CHO reporter cells or when CHO/moTLR2 lysate was immunoprecipitated with the isotype control. Immunoprecipitation of endogenous TLR2 in 35S-labeled RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages with 6C2 (Fig. 1B), indicat"
https://openalex.org/W1965650923,"Controversy surrounds the metal-dependent mechanism of H-N-H endonucleases, enzymes involved in a variety of biological functions, including intron homing and DNA repair. To address this issue we determined the crystal structures for complexes of the H-N-H motif containing bacterial toxin colicin E9 with Zn2+, Zn2+·DNA, and Mg2+·DNA. The structures show that the rigid V-shaped architecture of the active site does not undergo any major conformational changes on binding to the minor groove of DNA and that the same interactions are made to the nucleic acid regardless of which metal ion is bound to the enzyme. The scissile phosphate contacts the single metal ion of the motif through distortion of the DNA brought about by the insertion of the Arg-96-Glu-100 salt bridge into the minor groove and a network of contacts to the DNA phosphate backbone that straddle the metal site. The Mg2+-bound structure reveals an unusual coordination scheme involving two H-N-H histidine residues, His-102 and His-127. The mechanism of DNA cleavage is likely related to that of other single metal ion-dependent endonucleases, such as I-PpoI and Vvn, although in these enzymes the single alkaline earth metal ion is coordinated by oxygen-bearing amino acids. The structures also provide a rationale as to why H-N-H endonucleases are inactive in the presence of Zn2+ but active with other transition metal ions such as Ni2+. This is because of coordination of the Zn2+ ion through a third histidine, His-131. “Active” transition metal ions are those that bind more weakly to the H-N-H motif because of the disengagement of His-131, which we suggest allows a water molecule to complete the catalytic cycle.

Homing endonucleases have played a key role in the evolution of genomes. Normally encoded within introns and inteins, these ubiquitous enzymes promote integration of mobile genetic elements into intronless or inteinless alleles (1Chevalier B.S. Stoddard B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3757-3774Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Homing enzymes are classified into four groups based on active site consensus motifs; LAGLIDADG, GIY-YIG, His-Cys box, and H-N-H. Over the last decade, the metal-dependent mechanisms of all but the H-N-H family have been largely resolved (2Galburt E.A. Stoddard B.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13851-13860Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Not confined to just homing endonucleases, hundreds of H-N-H enzymes, including DNA repair enzymes and the apoptotic endonuclease CAD, have been identified across the three biological kingdoms (3Malik H.S. Henikoff S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 414-418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 4Walker D.C. Georgiou T. Pommer A.J. Hemmings A.M. Moore G.R. Kleanthous C. James R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3225-3234Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We present the first structural analysis of metal binding to an H-N-H motif containing endonuclease in the context of DNA, focusing on the enzyme, colicin E9. Colicins are plasmid-encoded protein antibiotics made by Escherichia coli during times of stress (5James R. Penfold C.N. Moore G.R. Kleanthous C. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These potent toxins parasitize nutrient uptake pathways to deliver a cytotoxic domain into the cell by first binding to an outer membrane receptor and then contacting proteins in the periplasm. Together, these associations promote uptake of the toxin into the cell. Colicin E9 is a 61-kDa endonuclease toxin that kills cells through degradation of bacterial DNA. This is accomplished through the action of a C-terminal, 15-kDa DNase domain (the E9 DNase) that has an H-N-H motif as its catalytic core (6Kleanthous C. Kühlmann U.C. Pommer A.J. Ferguson N. Radford S.E. Moore G.R. James R. Hemmings A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Homing endonucleases are sequence-specific enzymes that recognize long, degenerate consensus sequences (1Chevalier B.S. Stoddard B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3757-3774Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). They also tend to be dimeric, cutting both strands of dsDNA 1The abbreviations used are: dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; Im, immunity protein. simultaneously. However, not all enzymes that contain homing endonuclease motifs are involved in homing. The nuclease from Serratia marescens, for example, is a nonspecific endonuclease that shares active site similarity with the His-Cys family of enzymes, such as I-PpoI from Physarum polycephalum (7Freidhoff P. Franke I. Meiss G. Wende W. Krause K. Pingoud A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 112-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Similarly, colicin E9 is a monomeric, nonspecific DNase that hydrolyzes single- and double-stranded DNA and is recognizable as an H-N-H enzyme through a 34-amino acid motif (6Kleanthous C. Kühlmann U.C. Pommer A.J. Ferguson N. Radford S.E. Moore G.R. James R. Hemmings A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). It shares many enzymological characteristics with other H-N-H enzymes, such as a requirement for high concentrations of Mg2+ or Ca2+ ions for activity against dsDNA, the ability to utilize some transition metal ions for catalysis, and cleavage products that have 3′-OH and 5′-phosphate termini (8Pommer A.J. Wallis R. Moore G.R. James R. Kleanthous C. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 9Pommer A.J. Cal S. Keeble A.H. Walker D. Evans S.J. Kuhlmann U.C. Cooper A. Connolly B.A. Hemmings A.M. Moore G.R. James R. Kleanthous C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 735-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Crystal structures for the related colicins, E7 and E9, have been reported. The structure for the E9 DNase is that of the enzyme bound to its cognate immunity protein, Im9 (6Kleanthous C. Kühlmann U.C. Pommer A.J. Ferguson N. Radford S.E. Moore G.R. James R. Hemmings A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Immunity proteins are inhibitors of colicin DNases that bind with high affinity to an exosite on the enzyme (10Kleanthous C. Walker D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 624-631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Structures for the E7 DNase in the free and Im7-bound forms and, more recently, bound to dsDNA have been published, the latter in the absence of divalent cations (11Ko T.-P. Liao C.-C. Ku W.-Y. Chak K.-F. Yuan H.-S. Structure. 1999; 7: 91-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 12Sui M.-J. Tsai L.-C. Hsia K.-C. Doudeva L.G. Ku W.-Y. Han G.W. Yuan H.S.

Structure. 2004; 12: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). An inherent assumption of the homing endonuclease field has been that the four recognizable active site motifs have arisen independently and represent distinct architectures. It was a surprise, therefore, when Kühlmann et al. (14Kühlmann U.C. Moore G.R. James R. Kleanthous C. Hemmings A.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 463: 1-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) discovered that the H-N-H motif of colicin E9 DNase is structurally related to the His-Cys active sites of I-PpoI and Serratia nuclease. This “ββα-Me” motif, composed of two β-strands, an α-helix, and a metal ion, has been found in other endonucleases such as Vvn from Vibrio vulnificus (15Li C.-L. Hor L.-I. Chang Z.-F. Tsai L.-C. Yang W.-Z. Yuan H.S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4014-4025Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and points to a common nuclease ancestor that has diverged into the distinct families we now recognize as H-N-H and His-Cys enzymes. Indeed, these families have diverged to such an extent that they share only 2 active site residues, a histidine that acts as a general base (His-103 E9 DNase/His-98 I-PpoI) and an arginine that is involved in phosphate binding (Arg-5 E9 DNase/Arg-61 I-PpoI) (14Kühlmann U.C. Moore G.R. James R. Kleanthous C. Hemmings A.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 463: 1-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The identity of the biologically active metal ion for His-Cys enzymes such as I-PpoI is known to be magnesium (16Galburt E.A. Chevalier B. Tang W. Jurica M.S. Flick K.E. Monnat Jr., R.J. Stoddard B.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 1096-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), whereas this issue remains enigmatic for H-N-H enzymes. This is because of the four histidine residues of the motif, all of which are required for catalytic activity (4Walker D.C. Georgiou T. Pommer A.J. Hemmings A.M. Moore G.R. Kleanthous C. James R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3225-3234Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In the absence of DNA, the H-N-H motif binds transition metals directly, with no detectable binding of magnesium (17Pommer A.J. Kühlmann U.C. Cooper A. Hemmings A.M. Moore G.R. James R. Kleanthous C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27153-27160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This is borne out by crystal structures for the E7 and E9 DNases where Zn2+ and Ni2+, respectively, have been observed bound to the motif histidines (6Kleanthous C. Kühlmann U.C. Pommer A.J. Ferguson N. Radford S.E. Moore G.R. James R. Hemmings A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 11Ko T.-P. Liao C.-C. Ku W.-Y. Chak K.-F. Yuan H.-S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1670-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) have also reported that the E7 enzyme is a zinc-dependent enzyme. By contrast, we have been unable to detect Zn2+ activity for any colicin DNase (E2, E7, E8, or E9), with Zn2+ tending to be inhibitory (8Pommer A.J. Wallis R. Moore G.R. James R. Kleanthous C. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 9Pommer A.J. Cal S. Keeble A.H. Walker D. Evans S.J. Kuhlmann U.C. Cooper A. Connolly B.A. Hemmings A.M. Moore G.R. James R.

Chem. 1999; 274: 27153-27160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, colicins are able to utilize some first row transition metal ions such as Co2+ and Ni2+ to cleave DNA (we have speculated that apparent Zn2+ activity may be because of Ni2+ contamination) (19Keeble A.H. Hemmings A.M. James R. Moore G.R. Kleanthous C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10234-10244Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These differences are related to the kinetics and thermodynamics of transition metal binding. Zn2+ association includes an additional step that traps the enzyme in a high affinity but inactive state (Kd ∼ nm) (19Keeble A.H. Hemmings A.M. James R. Moore G.R. Kleanthous C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10234-10244Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Active transition metals are those that bind with weaker affinities (Kd ∼ μm). Through mutagenesis of H-N-H residues, Walker et al. (4Walker D.C. Georgiou T. Pommer A.J. Hemmings A.M. Moore G.R. Kleanthous C. James R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3225-3234Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) have established that Mg2+ ions are the preferred metal for dsDNA cleavage by the E9 DNase, and this is consistent with the metal requirements for other H-N-H enzymes such as I-CmoeI and LtrA from Chlamydomonas moewussi and Lactococcus lactis, respectively (20Drouin M. Lucas P. Otis C. Lemieux C. Turmel M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4566-4572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Filippo J.S. Lambowitz A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 933-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To understand the mechanism by which these enzymes hydrolyze nucleic acid, in the present work we have used crystallography to address how Mg2+ ions bind to the histidine-rich H-N-H motif of the E9 DNase domain in the context of dsDNA. We have also rationalized why Zn2+ is inactive within the H-N-H motif, whereas other transition metals such as Ni2+ endow the motif with activity. The H103A E9 DNase was expressed and purified as described (4Walker D.C. Georgiou T. Pommer A.J. Hemmings A.M. Moore G.R. Kleanthous C. James R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3225-3234Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 8Pommer A.J. Wallis R. Moore G.R. James R. Kleanthous C. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Apo-H103A E9 DNase was obtained after treatment with 5 mm EDTA and dialysis against 200 mm NaCl followed by dialysis against water and lyophilization (17Pommer A.J. Kühlmann U.C. Cooper A.

The absence of metal in the H-N-H motif of purified protein was monitored routinely by fluorescence spectroscopy as described by Pommer et al. (17Pommer A.J. Kühlmann U.C. Cooper A. Hemmings A.M. Moore G.R. James R. Kleanthous C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27153-27160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Crystals of the H103A E9 DNase in complex with Zn2+ were obtained by hanging drop vapor diffusion against 26% w/v polyethylene glycol MME 2000, 100 mm KSCN, and 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.8, at a protein concentration of 30 mg/ml. Crystals were flash-cooled in Paraton-N and data collection performed at 100 K using the beamline ID14.1 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble). In the preparation of H103A E9 DNase in complex with dsDNA, 8-mer palindromic DNA (5′-GCGATCGC-3′) was first denatured at high temperature and then annealed by slow cooling. Bases are numbered in the text as 1–8 for one strand and 9–16 for the complementary strand. A stoichiometric amount of duplex was added to the protein to form the complex (final concentration, 40 mg/ml). Crystals of the Zn2+ complex were grown by hanging drop vapor diffusion against 18% v/v polyethylene glycol 400, 100 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7, and 6 mm ZnCl2, whereas 15% v/v polyethylene glycol 400, 100 mm cacodylate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 100 mm MgCl2 was used for the Mg2+ complex. Crystals were flash-cooled in mother liquor containing 28% v/v polyethylene glycol 400. X-ray diffraction data for both complexes were collected at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble) beamline ID14.1. All data sets were integrated and scaled using MOLSFLM (22.Leslie, A. G. W. (1992) Joint CCP4 and ESF-EAMCB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography, No. 26Google Scholar) and SCALA (23Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19796) Google Scholar), with the final statistics presented in Table I. Crystals of the H103A E9 DNase·Zn2+ complex belong to the space group P212121 and have two molecules of the complex in the asymmetric unit, with a Matthews coefficient of 2.4. Crystals of complexes with DNA bound belong to the space group C2221 and have four molecules of complex in the asymmetric unit, giving a Matthews coefficient of 2.0. Structures were solved by molecular replacement using the program AmoRe (24Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

All the structures were refined without non-crystallographic symmetry restraints using REFMAC (23Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Structure Determination and Description—To obtain structures of the E9 DNase bound to metal ions, we focused on an inactive mutant in which His-103, the putative general base, was substituted for alanine. The H103A mutant shows wild type binding of transition metals but is unable to catalyze DNA hydrolysis (4Walker D.C. Georgiou T. Pommer A.J. Hemmings A.M. Moore G.R. Kleanthous C. James R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3225-3234Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Structures of three complexes of H103A E9 DNase were obtained in which the H-N-H motif was bound with (i) Zn2+, (ii) Zn2+·dsDNA, and (iii) Mg2+·dsDNA. The dsDNA used in crystallization experiments was an 8-mer palindromic sequence. Hsia et al. (13Hsia K.-C. Chak K.-F. Liang P.-H Cheng Y.-S. Ku W.-Y. Yuan H.S. Structure. 2004; 12: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) used the same DNA duplex in their recent structure of the apo-E7 DNase bound to dsDNA. The three E9 DNase complexes were crystallized and their structures solved by molecular replacement using the coordinates for the wild type E9 DNase (see “Materials and Methods”) (6Kleanthous C.

Moore G.R. James R. Kleanthous C. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 1163-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The resolution for each of the structures of H103A E9 DNase bound to Zn2+, Zn2+·dsDNA, and Mg2+·dsDNA was 2.0, 2.4, and 2.9 Å, respectively. The refinement statistics for each complex are presented in Table I. In the case of the H103A E9 DNase bound to a single Zn2+ ion, two molecules of the metal-bound complex were present in the asymmetric unit, whereas in both DNA·metal complexes the enzyme was bound to a single 8-mer duplex and a single metal ion, with four copies in each asymmetric unit. The E9 DNase domain is known to exhibit substantial conformational heterogeneity around residues 20–25 and 65–72, regions that are not part of the enzyme active site but are in close proximity to each other. This has been observed by heteronuclear NMR for the unbound protein as two slowly inter-converting conformers (31Whittaker S.B-M. Boetzel R. MacDonald C. Lian L.-Y. Pommer A.J. Reilly A. James R. Kleanthous C. Moore G.R. J. Biomol. NMR. 1998; 12: 145-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), with this heterogeneity persisting in the Im9-bound form (32Whittaker S.B-M. Czisch M. Wechselberger R. Kaptein R. Hemmings A.M. James R. Kleanthous C. Moore G.R. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 713-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and for the E9 DNase·Im9 complex crystallographically by virtue of the high B-factors for these regions relative to the rest of the structure (30Kühlmann U.C. Pommer A.J. Moore G.R. James R. Kleanthous C. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 1163-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The temperature factors for the same regions are also high in the present structures of H103A E9 DNase bound to Zn2+ and the enzyme·DNA complex bound to either Zn2+ or Mg2+. In addition, the N-terminal 3–6 residues of all monomers in both protein·DNA complexes have high B-factors. Moreover, monomer A in the H103A E9 DNase·dsDNA·Zn2+ complex shows higher B-factors than the other monomers, particularly in the conformationally flexible regions. Finally, residues 35–47 and 66–75 were not well defined in the electron density and so were not included in the final model for this monomer only. In summary, the complexes of H103A E9 DNase bound to metal ions and dsDNA display several disordered regions, most of which have been documented previously. These affect the general quality of the model, reflected in the slightly high R factor/Rfree (Table I). The overall structure for the Mg2+-bound dsDNA complex of H103A E9 DNase is shown in Fig. 1A, with representative electron density for this complex presented in Fig. 1B. As reported previously, the E9 DNase is a mixed α/β protein, with its 34-amino acid H-N-H motif located at the extreme C terminus of the enzyme (Fig. 1A, dark green) (6Kleanthous C. Kühlmann U.C. Pommer A.J. Ferguson N. Radford S.E. Moore G.R. James R. Hemmings A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 30Kühlmann U.C. Pommer A.J. Moore G.R. James R. Kleanthous C. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 1163-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The H-N-H motif (residues 100–134), along with residues 94–100 that are part of a preceding loop, forms the principle contacts with the DNA although other regions of the protein, at positions 5, 51, and 54, also interact with the nucleic acid. The structure for H103A E9 DNase bound to Zn2+ in the present work is very similar to that of the Ni2+-bound wild type enzyme (the root mean square deviation for Cα atoms is 0.7 Å). Binding of dsDNA to the H103A E9 DNase, loaded with Zn2+ or Mg2+ in the H-N-H motif, also only resulted in small structural changes to the enzyme with the root mean square deviations for Cα atoms relative to the Zn2+-bound enzyme being 0.6 and 0.8 Å, respectively. This is in stark contrast to the DNA bound at the active site, the minor groove of which is distorted relative to B-DNA of the same sequence (Fig. 1A). In addition to the changes induced in the DNA by binding to the H-N-H motif of the E9 DNase, packing of the protein monomers within the asymmetric unit disrupts the base pairing at one end of the bound DNA duplex (Fig. 2). This results in the flipping-out of the terminal bases of both strands to yield final conformations that are stabilized by contacts with neighboring monomers. These changes, although most likely linked to the distortions induced by binding to the H-N-H motif and the destabilization of the duplex that ensues, are unlikely to be mechanistically relevant. Protein-Nucleic Acid Contacts between the Metal-bound H103A E9 DNase and dsDNA—A direct consequence of the unyielding nature of the V-shaped active site is that in order for a scissile phosphate of B-DNA to reach the metal center of the H-N-H motif it must undergo some distortion; this is borne out by the current structures (Fig. 1A). The α-helix (and accompanying metal ion) of the E9 DNase H-N-H motif is positioned parallel to the helical axis of the DNA minor groove, with residues from the preceding six amino acids inserted into the groove itself. Together, these regions contact predominantly the phosphate backbone and cause a significant bend toward the major groove and widening of the minor groove (from 5.9 to ∼9 Å; see Fig. 1A). We note that in the case of the E7 DNase binding to the same DNA sequence (13Hsia K.-C. Chak K.-F. Liang P.-H Cheng Y.-S. Ku W.-Y. Yuan H.S. Structure. 2004; 12: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) this central distortion is essentially equivalent to that induced by the E9 DNase, demonstrating that it is independent of metal ion binding and is an intrinsic property of the H-N-H motif itself. This also emphasizes that the frayed end of the duplex seen in the present structures (but not seen in the E7 structure) is due to crystal packing forces. One of the striking observations from a comparison of the Zn2+ and Mg2+ structures for dsDNA bound to H103A E9 DNase is the similarity of interactions made by the enzyme to the nucleic acid. In both the Mg2+ and Zn2+ H103A E9 DNase complexes the same scissile phosphate oxygen atom (P6) between T5 and C6 is coordinated by the metal ion, with the same hydrogen-bonding interactions being made toward the surrounding phosphates (Fig. 3). Hence, although Mg2+ ions, but not Zn2+ ions, support DNA cleavage by the E9 DNase the global features of their respective complexes with nucleic acid are essentially identical. However, subtle differences do exist between the two complexes that explain the differing activities of the metal ions, which are largely restricted to the vicinity of the metal ion. We return to this issue below. Given the poorer resolution (2.9 Å) of the data for the Mg2+-bound complex the following is a summary of the main contacts to dsDNA in the Zn2+ complex (2.4 Å). A total of ∼700 Å2 of protein surface area is buried on complexation. The distortion of the DNA is because of the insertion of the Arg-96-Glu-100 salt bridge into the minor groove of the DNA, causing it to bend and widen appreciably. This conformation is stabilized by a network of hydrogen bonds between the DNA and residues Arg-5, Arg-54, and Asp-51 that straddle the scissile phosphodiester at P6 (Fig. 3). The E7 DNase makes a similar set of interactions to dsDNA, although interestingly these are centered around a different scissile bond (P4). Arg-5 and Arg-54 make three hydrogen bonds to DNA phosphates P6 and P7. Arg-96 forms a hydrogen bond to the hydroxyl of a base on the opposing strand"

Evidence is presented that WRN helicase behaves similarly to E. coli RecQ with respect to optimal Mg2+:ATP ratio for DNA unwinding but displays distinct differences with respect to the effects of free Mg2+ ion and ATP concentrations on DNA unwinding activity. The ability of other divalent metals to substitute for magnesium in the WRN helicase reaction is metal-specific, and certain metal ions potently inhibited WRN helicase activity or stimulated WRN exonuclease activity. These results indicate that DNA metabolic processing by WRN helicase or exonuclease activities can be modulated by the availability of free metal ions.To better understand the WRN helicase mechanism, we utilized a fluorometric assay to monitor helicase-catalyzed unwinding of duplex DNA (38Bjornson K.P. Amaratunga M. Moore K.J. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14306-14316Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This assay uses the principle of fluorescence resonance energy transfer to observe the unwinding of duplex DNA in real time. A forked duplex DNA substrate, the preferred B-form DNA structure of WRN helicase (24Brosh Jr., R.M. Waheed J. Sommers J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23236-23245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) with fluorescein (F) 1The abbreviations used are: F, fluorescein; HF, hexachlorofluorescein; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; nt, nucleotide(s). 1The abbreviations used are: F, fluorescein; HF, hexachlorofluorescein; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; nt, nucleotide(s). covalently attached to the 3′ blunt end and hexachlorofluorescein (HF) attached to the 5′ blunt end of the duplex DNA molecule, was used for the kinetic analyses (Fig. 1). F is excited at a wavelength of 492 nm and emits a wavelength of 520 nm, which lies in the excitation spectrum of HF (Fig. 1A). Fluorescence resonance energy transfer occurs between F (donor) and HF (acceptor) when both are in close proximity during the duplex state of the substrate. However, upon helicase-catalyzed unwinding of the duplex and separation of the complementary strands, F and HF are no longer in close proximity, and the fluorescence emission from F excitation can be detected by a photosensor (Fig. 1B). This method of measuring helicase-catalyzed unwinding of duplex DNA using fluorescence stopped-flow instrumentation is valuable for kinetic analyses where data are collected continuously throughout the reaction in real time.We applied fluorescence resonance energy transfer technology to study the kinetics of WRN helicase activity under presteady state conditions in which the enzyme is saturated with an excess of DNA substrate (39Nanduri B.

The results from presteady state kinetic studies were used to determine the initial burst kinetics of DNA unwinding, enabling us to determine the rate of DNA unwinding by WRN under the assigned reaction conditions. Mechanistic information on the WRN helicase reaction was determined from these analyses and provides the first kinetic parameters of a human RecQ unwinding reaction based on real time measurements.MATERIALS AND METHODSProteins—Recombinant hexahistidine-tagged full-length WRN proteins (wild-type WRN or the exonuclease point mutant WRN-E84A) were overexpressed using a baculovirus/Sf9 insect system and purified as described previously (40Sharma S.

FLAP26 and TSTEM25 with F and HF, respectively, were obtained from Proligo. DNA substrates were prepared as described previously (24Brosh Jr., R.M. Waheed J. Sommers J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23236-23245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) with the exception that DNA substrates used for fluorometric assays were not 5′-32P end-labeled.Fluorometric Helicase Kinetic Assays—Fluorescence stopped-flow kinetic experiments were performed using Applied Photophysics SX.18MV stopped-flow reaction analyzer. The instrument was equipped with a 150-watt xenon lamp, and the monochromator was set to a slit width of 1 mm. Fluorescein was excited at a wavelength of 492 nm, and the fluorescence emission was monitored at wavelengths greater than 520 nm with the 51300 cut-on filter from Oriel Corp. Experiments were carried out in the two-syringe mode where WRN and ATP were preincubated at 37 °C in one syringe for 1 min, while the DNA substrate was preincubated at 37 °C in the second syringe. Each syringe contained 30 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 5% glycerol, 40 mm KCl, the indicated concentration of MgCl2, and 100 ng/μl bovine serum albumin. Concentrations of WRN, ATP, and DNA fork substrate in the syringe were double that of the indicated final concentration in the reaction. Equal volumes (60 μl) of sample from both syringes were mixed to initiate the reaction, which took place at 37 °C. One thousand data points were collected from monitoring 20 μl of each kinetic time course reaction. For converting the output data from volts to percent unwinding, a time course with the same set up was performed except with only the fluorescein oligonucleotide instead of the fluorescent forked duplex substrate. Data were then normalized by defining the voltage obtained with the fluorescein oligonucleotide as 100% unwinding.Radiometric Helicase Assays—Helicase assay reactions (20 μl) contained 30 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 5% glycerol, 40 mm KCl, 100 ng/μl bovine serum albumin, 0.8 nm DNA fork substrate, and the indicated concentrations of MgCl2 and/or specified metal, ATP, and WRN. For time course assays imitating the fluorometric assay, WRN and ATP were preincubated in a tube together, while DNA was preincubated separately at 37 °C for 1 min. Reactions were initiated by mixing the contents of both tubes together, and 20-μl samples were quenched at the indicated times. For metal inhibition or substitution assays, the metal and WRN were preincubated on ice for 3 min before the initiation of a 15-min reaction at 37 °C by adding DNA fork substrate. Reactions were quenched with 20 μl of stop buffer (35 mm EDTA, 0.6% SDS, 25% glycerol, 0.04% bromphenol blue, 0.04% xylene cyanol) containing a 10-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide of the same sequence as the labeled strand of the DNA fork substrate. The products of the helicase reactions were resolved on nondenaturing 12% polyacrylamide gels. Radiolabeled DNA species in polyacrylamide gels were visualized using a PhosphorImager and quantitated using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). The percent helicase substrate unwound was calculated by the formula: percent unwinding = 100 × (P/(S + P)) where P is the product and S is the residual substrate. The values of P and S have been corrected after subtracting background values in controls having no enzyme and heat-denatured substrate, respectively. Helicase data represent the mean of at least three independent experiments with mean ± S.D. shown by error bars.Radiometric Exonuclease Assays—Exonuclease assay reactions (20 μl) contained the same components as the radiometric helicase assays except that Zn2+ was substituted for Mg2+ where indicated. The metal was preincubated with WRN for 3 min on ice before initiating the 15-min reaction at 37 °C with radiolabeled fork substrate. Each reaction was quenched with 10 μl of stop buffer (80% formamide, 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA, 0.1% xylene cyanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue) and heated at 95 °C for 10 min. Products were resolved on denaturing 14% polyacrylamide gels and visualized by a PhosphorImager.RESULTSTo better understand the catalytic functions of the Werner syndrome protein and how they may be important in DNA metabolism, we investigated the cofactor requirements for WRN helicase and exonuclease activities. In addition, we examined the kinetics of WRN-catalyzed DNA unwinding to better understand its helicase mechanism.Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer for Measuring WRN Helicase Unwinding of Duplex DNA—To begin to understand the mechanism of duplex DNA unwinding catalyzed by the WRN helicase, we performed kinetic analyses of the unwinding reaction using a fluorometric helicase assay and a more traditional gel-based assay that uses a radiolabeled DNA substrate. The advantage of the fluorometric assay is that helicase activity can be measured in real time, enabling one to determine kinetic parameters that rely on fast kinetic analysis in the millisecond scale. The conventional gel-based assay enabled us to conveniently determine optimal divalent cation and ATP concentrations for WRN helicase activity using smaller amounts of enzyme and to substantiate our helicase data from fluorescence assays to verify that we were, in fact, measuring DNA unwinding. Combining these approaches enabled us to investigate the kinetics of WRN helicase activity under optimized reaction conditions.The DNA substrate that we elected to use for these studies was based on our previous work (24Brosh Jr., R.M. Waheed J. Sommers J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23236-23245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) that defined the minimal length requirements for the 5′ and 3′ single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) tails of forked duplex substrates required by WRN for efficient unwinding. Based on these results, we examined WRN helicase activity on an optimal forked DNA substrate with a 19-bp duplex flanked by tail lengths of 25 nucleotides (3′) and 26 nucleotides (5′). As shown in Fig. 1, F was positioned on the 3′ blunt end, whereas HF was positioned on the 5′ blunt end. Since the 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity of WRN can attack the 3′ blunt end of a forked duplex DNA molecule (42Opresko P.L. Laine J.P. Brosh Jr., R.M. Seidman M.M. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44677-44687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), it was a concern to optimize WRN helicase activity while minimizing or obstructing its exonuclease activity. Under conditions of DNA unwinding (presence of ATP), the DNA oligonucleotides of the helicase substrate lacking the F and HF moieties were not appreciably degraded by WRN exonuclease activity as judged by quantitation of DNA products resolved on denaturing gels (24Brosh Jr., R.M. Waheed J. Sommers J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23236-23245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, it was possible that a minimal amount of fluorescent signal may have been attributed to a small population of DNA helicase substrates whose fluorescein molecules had been removed by WRN exonuclease activity. Denaturing gel analysis of WRN reaction products from a radiolabeled helicase substrate possessing the F and HF moieties demonstrated that WRN exonuclease activity was completely blocked from attacking the DNA substrate even in the absence of ATP (data not shown). From these results, we were able to conclude that the F/HF conjugates on the blunt end of the helicase substrate effectively blocked WRN exonuclease activity. Hence we did not have to be concerned about the interference of any fluorescent signal attributed to the incision of the F label on the 3′ blunt end by WRN exonuclease activity.To substantiate the fluorescence-based helicase assay, we collected and compared data from fluorometric and radiometric assays. This was accomplished by performing WRN helicase reactions under identical conditions using either assay and then comparing the results from fluorescence measurements with those from native gel analysis of radiolabeled products obtained by chemical quench at specific time points throughout the 200-s time course. For the radiometric assay, the fluorescent DNA substrate (with covalently attached F and HF moieties) was 5′-32P end-labeled. Throughout the fluorescence-based time course, we observed the output voltage signal increase with time that was presumably due to the increase in the number of excited F molecules that were no longer in close proximity to HF upon unwinding of the duplex substrate by WRN. The fluorescence data were normalized by defining the voltage obtained with only the F-labeled single-stranded oligonucleotide as 100% unwinding of the substrate (43Xu H.Q. Zhang A.H. Auclair C. Xi X.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 1-7PubMed Google Scholar). This enabled us to convert the voltage output data to percent unwinding. The results from these parallel kinetic experiments using 0.8 nm DNA substrate and 12 nm WRN are shown in Fig. 2A. Helicase data points from the radiometric assay (large filled circles) were overlaid on the normalized fluorometric helicase data and found to agree well. This comparison substantiated the fluorometric assay for measuring WRN helicase activity.Fig. 2Kinetic analyses of DNA unwinding by WRN helicase using a fluorometric stopped-flow assay. Helicase reaction mixtures contained 0.8 nm forked DNA substrate, 2 mm ATP, 8 mm MgCl2, and the indicated concentrations of WRN helicase.

A representative gel of the radiometric time course assay is shown: lane 1, no enzyme (NE) control; lanes 2–14, reaction time points quenched at 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160, and 180 s, respectively; lane 15, heat-denatured substrate control. B, fluorometric unwinding data as a function of WRN protein concentration.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Next we examined WRN helicase activity using the fluorometric assay at a fixed concentration of forked duplex DNA substrate (0.8 nm) and a range of WRN protein concentrations. At each WRN concentration, fluorescence data were obtained for a time course of 200 s. For each WRN protein concentration, the fluorescent signal (voltage) increased with respect to time. At lower WRN concentrations (0.6 and 3 nm), output voltage continued to increase throughout the time course, whereas a signal plateau was approached by 100 s in reactions containing higher WRN concentrations (16 or 32 nm). The fluorescent traces from reactions containing 16 and 32 nm WRN were superimposable, suggesting that the DNA substrate was saturated with WRN enzyme at these concentrations. The data were normalized and converted to percent unwinding with respect to time as shown in Fig. 2B. Initial rates of unwinding were determined for each time course and are listed in Table I. As WRN protein concentration increased, initial rates of unwinding also increased. However, this increase in initial rates was seen only up to the saturation point (i.e. 16 nm WRN).Table IKinetics of WRN-catalyzed DNA unwinding as a function of WRN protein concentration[WRN]Initial rate of unwindingnmnm bp/s0.60.0197630.167260.2128120.3648160.5624320.5624 Open table in a new tab Optimal ATP-Mg2+Concentration for WRN Helicase Activity—Before initiating a kinetic analysis using the fluorometric assay, we were interested in optimizing the reaction conditions for WRN helicase activity, which had not been done previously. Since the ATP-Mg2+ complex is the source of chemical energy for helicase-catalyzed unwinding and therefore a critical component of the helicase reaction, we focused our efforts to determine optimal concentrations of Mg2+ and ATP for WRN helicase activity. Initially we sought to determine an estimated ratio between ATP and Mg2+ where the greatest initial rate of WRN unwinding would be detected and then to determine the optimal ATP-Mg2+ concentration. For these purposes, we used the radiometric assay because significantly smaller reaction volumes can be used compared with the fluorometric assay. The optimal Mg2+:ATP ratio was determined by maintaining ATP at a fixed concentration of 2 mm and titrating in various concentrations of MgCl2. A 20-s time course was performed at each MgCl2 concentration, and the initial rates of unwinding were plotted as a function of the [Mg2+]: [ATP] ratio (Fig. 3). WRN helicase activity increased fairly linearly with Mg2+:ATP ratios up to 1; greater Mg2+:ATP ratios of up to 4 did not significantly further increase or decrease WRN unwinding. A Mg2+:ATP ratio of 1 was determined to be optimal for WRN helicase activity. This was confirmed by carrying out the same set of experiments using 5 mm ATP, which gave a profile similar to that obtained with 2 mm ATP (Fig. 3). Each set of data was best fit to a sigmoidal curve, which displayed the optimum at a Mg2+:ATP ratio of 1.Fig. 3Dependence of WRN helicase activity on Mg2+ ion concentration. Helicase reaction mixtures contained 0.8 nm forked DNA substrate, 5 nm WRN, and 2 mm ATP with increasing concentrations of MgCl2 from 0 to 8 mm (closed circles) or 5 mm ATP with increasing concentrations of MgCl2 from 0 to 20 mm (open circles). The radiometric assay was used to measure initial rates of WRN helicase activity with quench points at 6, 10, 15, and 20 s. Initial rates of unwinding (mean value of three independent experiments with S.D. indicated by error bars) are plotted as a function of [Mg2+]:[ATP] (mm:mm) ratio. Each data set was best fit to a sigmoidal curve as shown with a solid line for 2 mm ATP and a dashed line for 5 mm ATP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We next performed experiments to determine the optimal concentration of ATP-Mg2+ for WRN helicase activity. Twenty-second time courses were performed for a series of WRN helicase reactions in which the ATP-Mg2+ complex, maintained at a 1:1 ratio, was increased. As shown in Fig. 4, initial rates of WRN helicase activity increased with an initial hyperbol"
https://openalex.org/W2093890030,"Telomere homeostasis, a process that is essential for continued cell proliferation and genomic stability, is regulated by endogenous telomerase and a collection of associated proteins. In this paper, a protein called KIP (previously reported as a protein that binds specifically to DNA-dependent protein kinase), has been identified as a telomerase-regulating activity based on the following pieces of evidence. First, complexes between KIP and the catalytic subunit of telomerase (hTERT) were identified using the yeast two-hybrid technique. Second, antibodies specific to KIP immunoprecipitate human telomerase in cell-free extracts. Third, immunolocalization experiments demonstrate that KIP is a nuclear protein that co-localizes with hTERT in cells. Fourth, KIP binds to hTERT both in vitro and in vivo in the absence of human telomerase RNA or telomeric DNA, thus defining the catalytic subunit of telomerase as the site of physical interaction. Fifth, co-immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that KIP-hTERT complexes form readily in cells and that overexpression of KIP in telomerase-positive cells increases endogenous telomerase activity. Finally, continued overexpression of KIP (60 population doublings) resulted in cells with elongated telomeres; thus, KIP directly or indirectly stimulates telomerase activity through hTERT and contributes to telomere lengthening. The collective data in this paper suggest that KIP plays a positive role in telomere length maintenance and/or regulation and may represent a novel target for anti-cancer drug development."

These observations indicate that H+-PPase plays an important role as an energy source for secondary active transport systems and as a scavenger of cytoplasmic PPi produced as a by-product of a variety of metabolic processes.In addition to its physiological significance, H+-PPase is an excellent model for research on the coupling between PPi hydrolysis and active H+ transport, because the enzyme consists of a single protein of ∼80 kDa with 14–16 transmembrane domains (2Drozdowicz Y.M.

Three highly conserved hydrophilic segments have been shown to be involved in the binding and hydrolysis of the substrate (3Nakanishi Y. Saijo T. Wada Y. Maeshima M. J. Biol.

In addition, a few acidic residues such as Glu305, Glu427, and Asp504, have been reported to be essential for PPi hydrolysis and energy coupling (18Zhen R.G. Kim E.J. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22340-22348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Two triple glycine motifs in the Rhodospirillum rubrum H+-PPase are thought to form flexible hinge regions supporting a conformational change mechanism (19Schultz A. Baltscheffsky M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1607: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been proposed that the presence of a lysine versus an alanine residue in the conserved GNXX(K/A) motif of a cytoplasmic segment is a useful criterion for distinguishing type I and type II H+-PPases (16Belogurov G.A. Lahti R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49651-49654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).Despite the simple structure of H+-PPases, little information is available as to how the enzyme couples the hydrolysis of PPi with the active transport of protons across the membrane. To approach this question, we focused on the tertiary structure of the enzyme and determined the membrane topology of the H+-PPase of S. coelicolor by a combination of cysteine-scanning mutagenesis and the use of sulfhydryl reagents.

It is an extremely useful bacterium because it is responsible for producing most of the natural antibiotics that are used in human and veterinary medicine. In addition, bacterial enzymes can be efficiently expressed in Escherichia coli, which is an essential requirement for mutational analysis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of an Artificially Synthesized ScPP DNA and an Expression Plasmid—The S. coelicolor H+-PPase gene (scpp), which was obtained by sequencing the laboratory strain, differed by eight bases from the reported sequence as follows: T/C845; C/G921; G/A1149; T/C1593; G/A1803; G/A1833; G/A188; and T/C2049 (the nucleotide left of the slant bar is from the reported sequence, the nucleotide right of the slant bar is from this study; numbering is from the first ATG of the open reading frame). The amino acid sequence is consistent with the DNA data base (20Wakabayashi S. Pang T. Su X. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7942-7949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) (DDBJ/GenBank™/EBI accession number AL645882) with the exception of Phe282 (Ser in the data base). We designed an artificial ScPP DNA (sScPP) with a GeneSynthesizer program (MacPerl script) and synthesized it without changing the amino acid sequence. We selected synonymous codons at random for each residue to produce a GC content similar to the codon usage of E. coli throughout the full sequence, avoiding rare codons such as ATA, CTA, CCC, CGG, CGA, AGA, and AGG. Sites for the restriction enzymes NdeI, SacII, MunI, PstI, and XhoI were introduced into the DNA for gene manipulation. As a first step, 32 oligonucleotides (numbers 1–32) of ∼100 bases were chemically synthesized in accordance with the designed sequence (Fig. 1). PCR was then carried out, and the gene was synthesized as described in Fig. 1. The PstI site of plasmid pET23 (Novagen) was modified (pYN309) and used as a plasmid vector. sScPP was inserted into the NdeI and XhoI sites of pYN309 to obtain an expression plasmid for ScPP (pYN315). An expression plasmid for ScPP-His was constructed in a similar way (pYN316).Mutagenesis of ScPP—Mutant derivatives were generated from sScPP with a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the method of Kirsh and Joly (27Kirsch R.D. Joly E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1848-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The identity of the mutated nucleotides was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cysteine-less mutants of ScPP and ScPP-His were generated by replacing the four endogenous cysteine residues (Cys178, Cys179, Cys253, and Cys621) with serine, serine, alanine, and valine, respectively. Single cysteine mutants were then generated from the His6-tagged cysteine-less ScPP. The E. coli plasmid pLysS (Novagen) was modified by replacing Lys128 with isoleucine, and the E. coli strain BLR(DE3) carrying this plasmid (pLysS K128I) was used to express the individual cysteine mutants.Protein Expression and Isolation of Crude Membranes—Each ScPP construct was introduced into E. coli strain BLR(DE3)pLysS (Novagen) or its derivative harboring pLysS K128I by transformation and selection for antibiotic resistance on Luria-Bertani plates containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Cells derived from a single transformant colony were grown in Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with antibiotics for 16 h at 37 °C and then diluted 50-fold in the same medium. After 4 h at 37 °C (OD660 = 0.7), isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.4 mm. The cells were incubated for a further 2 h, harvested by centrifugation at 3,500 × g for 10 min, suspended in a one-twentieth volume of 50 mm Mes/Tris, pH 7.2, 0.15 m sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, 75 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA/Tris, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and disrupted by sonication. Following centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 5 min, the supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the pellet was suspended in 10 mm Mes/Tris, pH 7.2, 0.15 m sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, 75 mm KCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol and used for the enzyme assay.Protein and Enzyme Assays—Protein content was determined using the Bradford method with a Bio-Rad assay kit (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213288) Google Scholar). PPi hydrolysis was measured at 30 °C as described previously (29Maeshima M. Yoshida S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20068-20073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with the exception that the reaction mixture contained 10 mm Mes/Tris, pH 7.2, 0.15 m sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, 75 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.35 mm K4PPi. PPi-dependent H+-transport activity was measured at 25 °C as described previously (29Maeshima M. Yoshida S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20068-20073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but in a reaction medium containing 10 mm Mes/Tris, pH 7.2, 0.15 m sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, 75 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 μm acridine orange. The enzyme reaction was initiated by adding 0.35 mm K4PPi.Immunoblotting—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% gels and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.) using a semidry blotting apparatus. Immunoblotting was carried out using polyclonal antibodies against the peptide DVGADLVGKVEC (16Belogurov G.A. Lahti R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49651-49654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) together with horseradish peroxidase-linked protein A and ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences).Cysteine-labeling Assay—Cysteine-scanning analysis of ScPP with sulfhydryl reagents was conducted using the method described previously (22Zhu Q.

Mutant ScPPs were expressed by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and the cells were washed with 150 mm KCl and 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5. AMS (Molecular Probes) was added to the cell suspension (100 μl) to a final concentration of 0.2 mm. After incubating for 10 min at 30 °C, 2 μl of 25 mm BM (Molecular Probes) was added, and the reaction was stopped after 10 min by adding 1 ml of the same buffer containing 5 mmN-ethylmaleimide. The cells were washed with this buffer, suspended in 200 μl of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 300 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mmN-ethylmaleimide, and 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and sonicated. After centrifuging at 1,500 × g for 5 min to remove cell debris, the supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 5 min, and the membrane fraction obtained was suspended in 0.1 ml of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 300 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm imidazole, and 5 mmN-ethylmaleimide. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 15 min, the supernatant was mixed with 50 μl of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with gentle shaking. The agarose resin was collected by flash centrifugation and washed with 1 ml of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 300 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, and 50 mm imidazole. The washed resin was treated with 10 μl of 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 5% SDS, 5% mercaptoethanol, 15% glycerol, and 20 mm EDTA, at 70 °C for 10 min prior to SDS-PAGE. The separated proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and biotinylated proteins were detected by the ECL method using a streptavidin-biotinylated horseradish peroxidase complex (Amersham Biosciences). After the analysis, the labels on the membrane were removed by incubation in 100 mm mercaptoethanol, 62.5 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, at 50 °C for 30 min, and the membrane was probed with polyclonal antibody to H+-PPase.RESULTSConstruction of a Synthetic Gene for S. coelicolor H+-PPase and Its Expression in E. coli—The native H+-PPase gene of S. coelicolor (scpp) has repeat sequences in the open reading frame (794 amino acids), and its GC content is extremely high (69.5%). Because these properties are not suitable for gene manipulation by PCR, we designed and constructed a synthetic ScPP gene (sScPP) as described under “Experimental Procedures” without changing the amino acid sequence (Fig. 1).Fig. 2 shows an alignment of the sequences of three H+-Ppases, i.e. ScPP, Vigna radiata type I H+-Ppase, and Arabidopsis thaliana type II H+-PPase. A long tail at the C terminus is a distinctive feature of ScPP, and the hydropathy analysis predicted 17 TMs (Fig. 2). Cys178 and Cys179 were positioned in the fourth TM, and Cys253 and Cys621 were in the hydrophilic loops. As described under “Experimental Procedures,” the cysteine residues were replaced with serine, and wild-type and mutant ScPPs expressed in E. coli were detected by immunoblotting with the antibody to the conserved sequence DVGADLGKVE. The bands of ScPP and ScPP-His were 69 and 72 kDa, respectively (Fig. 3A). When all of the cysteine residues were replaced with serine, both PPi hydrolysis and H+-transport activities were completely lost (Fig. 3, B and C). To determine which cysteine residues were essential for enzymatic activity, we replaced each of the four residues individually with serine; mutants C178S and C179S retained activity, whereas mutants C253S and C621S lost it.Fig. 2Sequence alignment of H+-PPases and sites of amino acid replacement in ScPP. The H+-PPases of S. coelicolor (ScPP), A. thaliana (AtVHP2, type II), and V. radiata (VrVHP1, type I) are aligned. Identical residues are marked by asterisks (*), conserved residues with a high degree of similarity are marked with colons (:), and conserved residues with a low degree of similarity are marked with points (.). The 17 TM domains of ScPP are represented by cylinders, and the positions of the 42 single cysteine mutants examined in this study are indicated on the bar.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 3Expression and enzymatic activities of ScPP mutants with substitutions of the endogenous cysteine residues. Crude membranes were prepared from E. coli cells expressing vacant vector (Vector), wild-type ScPP (WT), and ScPP mutants with replacements of endogenous cysteine residues as indicated. The His6-tagged wild-type ScPP (WT-His) and His6-tagged cysteine-less mutant (C-less-His) were expressed in the E. coli strain BLR(DE3) in plasmid pLysS pK128I (K128I), and the other mutants and controls were expressed in normal pLysS (BLR(DE3)pLysS). A, immunoblot with anti-H+-PPase antibody of membranes (10 μg) from E. coli cells expressing ScPP mutants; arrowheads indicate bands at 69 and 72 kDa corresponding to ScPP and ScPP-His6, respectively. B,PPi-hydrolyzing activity of membranes from cells harboring mutant ScPPs. C, PPi-dependent H+ transport by membrane vesicles (200 μg). D, representative data for fluorescence quenching of acridine orange by PPi-dependent H+ pump activity. The membrane permeable cation NH4+ was added at 4 min to collapse the pH gradient. The data in B and C are presented as the mean ± S.D. of duplicate assays.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Cys253 and Cys621 were therefore replaced by alanine or valine, as most homologues of ScPP have alanine or valine at positions equivalent to Cys253 and Cys621. As shown in Fig. 3, B and C, two of the mutant ScPPs (C178S/C179S/C253A/C621A and C178S/C179S/C253A/C621V) had relatively high activity; the latter in particular had 70% of wild-type activity and retained activity when a His6 tag was added to the C terminus. Fig. 3D shows the PPi-dependent H+-translocating activity of the cysteine-less ScPP-His. The pH gradient generated was collapsed by the addition of the membrane-permeable ammonium ion, confirming the occurrence of electrogenic H+ transport in the membrane vesicles. We therefore concluded that this cysteine-less ScPP-His mutant retains its structure and activity in E. coli. This mutant (C178S/C179S/C253A/C621V) was used for the cysteine-scanning analysis.It should be noted that we expressed cysteine-less ScPP-His, in an E. coli strain containing plasmid pLysS K128I in which the Lys128 of the T7 lysozyme gene had been substituted by isoleucine. T7 lysozyme is a bi-functional enzyme that inhibits T7 RNA polymerase and cuts the amide bond between alanine residues and N-acetylmuramic acid in the peptidoglycan layer of the cell wall (32Cheng X. Zhang X. Pflugrath J.W. Studier F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4034-4038Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The enzyme could leak out of the cell and cause cell lysis via its amidase activity during experiments with a sulfhydryl reagent and damage the integrity of the E. coli plasma membrane, which is essential for membrane topology analysis by cysteine labeling. By contrast, the mutated T7 lysozyme (K128I) retains its inhibitory activity against T7 RNA polymerase but has lost its amidase activity and has no detrimental effect on cysteine-less ScPP-His expression (Fig. 3). We therefore used E. coli containing the plasmid pLysS K128I in subsequent experiments.Enzymatic Activity of Single Cysteine Mutants—We generated 39 single cysteine mutants from cysteine-less ScPP-His to determine the membrane topology of the hydrophilic regions. The residues depicted in Fig. 2 cover all of the hydrophilic loops and the C- and N-terminal tails. The wild-type ScPP-His and all of the single cysteine mutants, except S609C, were uniformly expressed in E. coli as shown by immunoblotting (Fig. 4A). Thirty-five of the 39 mutants had relatively high PPi hydrolysis and H+-transporting activities (Fig. 4, B and C) and were used in subsequent experiments. The other four mutant enzymes (S263C, S402C, S609C, and S694C) had lost all activity, indicating that the four substituted serine residues are involved in the catalytic function or the correct folding of ScPP. It is reasonable that the activity of the A253C mutant should be the highest of the single cysteine mutants, because cysteine is the original residue at this position in the wild-type enzyme.Fig. 4Activity and expression of single cysteine ScPP mutants. Membrane vesicles were prepared from single cysteine mutants generated from the cysteine-less ScPP mutant (C178S/C179S/C253A/C621V). A, immunoblots with the anti-H+-PPase antibody of membranes (10 μg) prepared from E. coli expressing mutant ScPPs. B, PPi hydrolysis by wild-type (WT-His), cysteine-less ScPP-His (C-less-His), and single cysteine mutants of ScPP-His. C, The PPi-dependent H+-pumping activity of membrane vesicles (250 μg). The data in B and C are presented as the mean ± S.D. of duplicate assays. Horizontal lines in B and C show the background activity of the vacant vector transformant. Cys253 of wild-type ScPP-His was substituted by alanine to prepare the cysteine-less ScPP-His; for this experiment this alanine was replaced by cysteine (A253C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Accessibility of the Cysteine Residues in the Mutants to BM—In the cysteine-scanning test, cells are treated with AMS followed by BM. After the enzyme is purified from E. coli membrane, biotinylated residues are detected with streptavidin as described under “Experimental Procedures.” AMS is a membrane-impermeable sulfhydryl reagent that reacts with cysteine residues on the external face of the cells. BM is membrane-permeable and binds covalently to the sulfhydryl group of cysteines in hydrophilic regions but not in transmembrane domains or hydrophobic spaces. ScPP-His and its derivatives were detected in all cases by immunoblotting, but the extent of biotinylation with BM varied (Fig. 5). The level was extremely low or undetectable in nine mutants (S101C, V183C, A253C, S282C, R308C, L438C, S545C, S740C, and S768C), which were removed from the cysteine-scanning analysis. Nevertheless, this result indicates that the nine residues are located in transmembrane domains or hydrophobic spaces because, as repor"

DNA topoisomerases regulate the level of DNA supercoiling in all DNA transactions. Reverse gyrase is a peculiar DNA topoisomerase, specific to hyperthermophilic microorganisms, which contains a helicase and a topoisomerase IA domain that has the unique ability to introduce positive supercoiling into DNA molecules. We show here that reverse gyrase of the archaean Sulfolobus solfataricus is mobilized to DNA in vivo after UV irradiation. The enzyme, either purified or in cell extracts, forms stable covalent complexes with UV-damaged DNA in vitro. We also show that the reverse gyrase translocation to DNA in vivo and the stabilization of covalent complexes in vitro are specific effects of UV light irradiation and do not occur with the intercalating agent actinomycin D. Our results suggest that reverse gyrase might participate, directly or indirectly, in the cell response to UV light-induced DNA damage. This is the first direct evidence of the recruitment of a topoisomerase IA enzyme to DNA after the induction of DNA damage. The interaction between helicase and topoisomerase activities has been previously proposed to facilitate aspects of DNA replication or recombination in both Bacteria and Eukarya.

In all living cells the induction of DNA damage activates an extremely complex network of events involving every cell process from DNA replication and transcription to cell division, protein synthesis and degradation, and, eventually, cell death (1Eckardt-Schupp F. Klaus C. Biochimie (Paris). 1999; 81: 161-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A major challenge in cell biology is elucidating how these events are regulated and connected. Archaea are helpful model systems for studying pathways of DNA transactions (replication, transcription, recombination, and repair) that are thought of as simplified and ancient versions of the eukaryal ones (reviewed in Refs. 2Bell S.D. Jackson S.P. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2001; 4: 208-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar and 3Ciaramella M. Pisani F.M. Rossi M. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 2002; 81: 85-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, to date the response to DNA damage has been poorly investigated in Archaea. Genome sequencing has revealed the presence of archaeal genes homologous to components of the eukaryal nucleotide excision repair pathway, which is involved in the repair of UV-induced DNA lesions (4Aravind L. Walker D.R. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1223-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 5White M.F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 690-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that the exposure of Sulfolobus solfataricus to UV light and the intercalating agent actinomycin D elicits a DNA damage response with features essentially conserved in all three domains of life, including growth arrest and transcriptional induction of nucleotide excision repair genes. UV light and actinomycin D also regulate the genes encoding two DNA-binding proteins affecting DNA conformation, namely Sul7d and Smj12 (6Salerno V. Napoli A. White M.F. Rossi M. Ciaramella M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 6127-6138Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Sul7d is an abundant chromosomal protein that induces DNA bending, compaction, and negative supercoiling (7Napoli A. Zivanovic Y. Bocs C. Buhler C. Rossi M. Forterre P. Ciaramella M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2656-2662Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In contrast, Smj12 induces positive supercoiling (8Napoli A Kvaratskelia M. White M.F. Rossi M. Ciaramella M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10745-10752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Although the reasons for this regulation are currently only matters of speculation, these results support the notion that DNA damage and repair are linked intimately with the structural and dynamic properties of chromatin (9Thoma F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6585-6598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and prompted us to investigate the involvement of DNA topoisomerases in maintaining genome integrity in S. solfataricus. Three topoisomerases have been characterized in S. solfataricus as follows: (i) a type II enzyme called Topo 1The abbreviations used are: Topo, topoisomerase; CCA, covalent complex assay; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. VI, which is homologous to Spo11, the initiator of recombination in eukaryotes (10Bergerat A. de Massy B. Gadelle D. Varoutas P.C. Nicolas A. Forterre P. Nature. 1997; 386: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar); (ii) a type III topoisomerase (11Dai P. Wang Y. Ye R. Chen L. Huang L. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 5500-5507Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar); and (iii) reverse gyrase. This latter is a peculiar enzyme, specific to thermophilic microorganisms, that induces positive supercoiling (reviewed in Refs. 12Duguet M. Eckstein F. Lilley D.M.J. Nucleic Acids and Molecular Biology. IX. Springer-Verlag, Berlin-Heidelberg1995: 84-114Google Scholar and 13Champoux J.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 369-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar). Consistent with the presence of this enzyme, the DNA of hyperthermophiles is relaxed or positively supercoiled in vivo (14Forterre P. Bergerat A. Lopez-Garcia P. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 18: 237-248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in contrast to that of mesophiles, which is negatively supercoiled. Positive supercoiling is considered a mechanism of adaptation to high temperature, and, indeed, reverse gyrase is the only hyperthermophile-specific gene (15Forterre P. Trends Genet. 2002; 18: 236-237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The enzyme contains a N-terminal helicase and a C-terminal Topo IA-type domain that cooperate to introduce positive supercoiling in an ATP-dependent reaction (16Declais A.C. Marsault J.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Although reverse gyrase is unique in its activity, type IA topoisomerases are essential enzymes ubiquitous in Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. Moreover, there are multiple examples of interaction between helicase and topoisomerase activities that are involved in different aspects of DNA metabolism (18Duguet M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1345-1350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, type IA Topo III enzymes associate physically and functionally with helicases of the RecQ family, forming an evolutionary conserved complex that has essential functions in the maintenance of genome stability (19Wu L.

Genetic defects in human homologs of the RecQ helicase are associated with the Bloom and Werner syndromes, which are characterized by high incidences of chromosomal rearrangements and cancer (reviewed in Ref. 23Watt P.M. Hickson I.D. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 265-267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We show here that S. solfataricus reverse gyrase is specifically recruited to DNA in vivo after exposure to UV light. In vitro UV lesions inhibit the positive supercoiling activity of reverse gyrase and stabilize covalent enzyme-DNA complexes. In contrast, actinomycin D inhibits reverse gyrase activity without stabilizing covalent complexes in vitro or affecting its localization in vivo. DNA Manipulations—Reactions were performed according to standard techniques. The oligonucleotides (Qiagen) used were as follows: RGA, 5′GGCTGTCGACGAAGATAGAGGACTTAATCGATATC (top strand) and 5′GGGATATCGATTAAGTCCTCTATCTTCGTCGACAG (bottom strand); and SA, 5′GGCTGTCGATATTCATTACTTCTTATCGATATC (top strand) and 5′GGGATATCGATAAGAAGTAATGAATATCGACAG (bottom strand). 3′-End labeling was obtained with [α-32P]dCTP and the Klenow enzyme after the annealing of complementary strands. 5′-End labeling was obtained with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase, followed by annealing and filling in the 3′-ends with the Klenow enzyme and cold dCTP. Cell Growth, Irradiation, and Extract Preparation—S. solfataricus P2 cultures were grown and irradiated as described previously (6Salerno V. Napoli A. White M.F. Rossi M. Ciaramella M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 6127-6138Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Controls were mock-treated following exactly the same procedure but were protected from UV light irradiation. Aliquots of irradiated and control cultures were collected after different durations of recovery at 80 °C, chilled quickly, spun, and resuspended in one-five hundredth of the initial volume of cold PBST (0.08 m Na2HPO4, 0.02 m NaH2PO4, 0.1 m NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100). Cells were lysed by three freeze-thaw cycles (5 min on dry ice and 5 min at 37 °C for each cycle), and lysates were mixed gently to avoid a vortex. An aliquot was removed (total extracts), and the remaining lysates were spun at 13,200 rpm at 4 °C for 15 min. Supernatants were stored, and pellets were resuspended in half of the initial volume of PBST. If needed, total extracts were either treated with DNase I (500 units/ml) during the lysis step or subjected to sonication (three cycles of 0.5 min each) and then centrifuged as described above to obtain a supernatant and a pellet fraction. Total extracts and pellets were sheared by passing repeatedly through a 1-ml syringe needle. The protein concentration of each fraction was determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Actinomycin Treatment—Cultures were grown as described above until the exponential phase; actinomycin D was added to half of the culture, and the rest was used as a control. Incubation continued for different duration at 80 °C; aliquots were withdrawn and used for extract preparation as described above. Western Blot—Total and fractionated extracts were analyzed using the Amersham Biosciences ECL Plus kit and a ChemiDoc apparatus (Bio-Rad). Polyclonal antibodies were against reverse gyrase (24Nadal M. Jaxel C. Portemer C. Forterre P. Mirambeau G. Duguet M. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 9102-9108Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and Ssb (gift of M. F. White, University of St. Andrews, St. Andrews, Scotland, UK). 2Richard, D. J., Bell, S. D., and White, M. F. (2004) Nucleic Acids Res.32, 1065-1074. Samples were run in 4-12% gradient gels in MES buffer (Bio-Rad). The QuantityOne software (Bio-Rad) was used for quantitation. Reverse Gyrase Assays—Assays were performed at 70 °C as reported (7Napoli A. Zivanovic Y. Bocs C. Buhler C. Rossi M. Forterre P. Ciaramella M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2656-2662Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) using either cell extracts or reverse gyrase purified from Sulfolobus shibatae B12 as described previously (25Nadal M. Couderc E. Duguet M. Jaxel C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5255-5263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Incubations were for 10 min. at 70 °C with plasmid pGEM3 (Promega). Samples were run on agarose gels as described (7Napoli A. Zivanovic Y. Bocs C. Buhler C. Rossi M. Forterre P. Ciaramella M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2656-2662Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), stained with ethidium bromide (1 μg/ml), and analyzed and quantified under UV light with a ChemiDoc apparatus and the QuantityOne software (Bio-Rad). The fluorescence of each band was measured and used to calculate the actual total amount of DNA, the total products, and the unprocessed substrate. For quantitative comparisons, the relative amount of products versus the total amount of DNA in each reaction was reported; values were expressed as a fraction of the relative amount of products in the control supernatant, which was designated 100%. Covalent Complex Assay (CCA)—Purified reverse gyrase or cell extracts were preincubated for 10 min. at 70 °C in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol (final volume of 40 μl). End-labeled oligonucleotides (3 ng; ∼2 × 105 cpm) were added, and incubation continued for 10 min at 70 °C. Reactions were blocked by quickly chilling on ice and adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were denatured and loaded on 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Radioactivity was determined with a Storm PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Effect of UV Radiation on the Amount and Intracellular Localization of Reverse Gyrase—Exponential S. solfataricus cultures grown at 80 °C were UV light-irradiated at room temperature with two different UV fluences that were shown previously to elicit a transcriptional response without inducing massive cell death (6Salerno V. Napoli A. White M.F. Rossi M. Ciaramella M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 6127-6138Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Aliquots of cultures were withdrawn after different durations of recovery at 80 °C and analyzed. Because the cultures undergo rapid temperature changes during the experiment and it has been shown that DNA topology is affected by temperature shock in Sulfolobales (26Lopez-Garcia P. Forterre P. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 1267-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), in each experiment an aliquot of the culture was routinely mock-treated exactly in the same way as samples, but not irradiated. A protocol for the preparation and fractionation of cell extracts was set up; briefly, cells were lysed by the addition of a nonionic detergent while taking care to minimize the times of manipulation and the mechanical shearing. The lysate was centrifuged to obtain a supernatant and a pellet. The majority of the total cellular protein remained in the supernatant as soluble protein, whereas the pellet contained genomic DNA with tightly associated chromosomal proteins as well as cell debris (data not shown). We analyzed the amount and distribution of reverse gyrase in cell extracts by Western blotting using a polyclonal antibody directed against the protein purified from S. shibatae (25Nadal M. Couderc E. Duguet M. Jaxel C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5255-5263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). In total cell extracts, the level of reverse gyrase was not affected by UV irradiation. However, the distribution of the protein between supernatants and pellets was dramatically different in controls and UV light-irradiated cells; in controls the protein was found in the soluble fraction but was almost absent in the pellet. Two hours after UV exposure, the protein was reduced in supernatants in a UV light dose-dependent manner, and consistently, it increased in pellets. As a control, we probed the same filter with an antibody directed against the single-stranded binding protein Ssb (27Wadsworth R.I. White M.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 914-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B); the protein was equally distributed between supernatants and pellets, and neither the amount or the distribution were affected by UV light irradiation. Reverse gyrase was quantified in multiple independent experiments (Fig. 1C). Whereas in controls 90% of the protein was found in the soluble and 10% in the insoluble fraction, at the highest UV dose used the ratio was reversed, with ∼40% of the protein in the supernatant and 60% in the chromatin fraction. These results showed that, in control cells, reverse gyrase is present almost exclusively in the soluble fraction, suggesting either that it is mostly cytoplasmic or that it is associated with the chromatin less tightly than are Ssb and the other DNA-binding proteins that were copurified in significant amounts with our pellet fraction (Fig. 1B and data not shown). If total cell extracts were first subjected to digestion with DNase I and then fractionated, most of the reverse gyrase present in the pellet was solubilized, and the distribution of the protein in UV light-irradiated cells became similar to that in controls (Fig. 1D). We conclude that UV light radiation does not affect the global reverse gyrase amount but induces its translocation from the supernatant to the chromatin fraction, where it is associated with genomic DNA. Effects of UV Exposure on Reverse Gyrase Activity—To test whether the change in the fractionation properties of reverse gyrase following UV light irradiation is associated with changes in its activity, we assayed positive supercoiling activity in cell extracts. We used two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis to separate positive and negative topoisomers (Fig. 2A). When a highly negatively supercoiled DNA plasmid (Fig. 2B) was incubated at 70 °C with total cell extracts, highly positive topoisomers were produced; such activity was unchanged in extracts prepared 2 h after exposure to UV light regardless of the dose used (data not shown). However, the distribution of the activity between supernatants and pellets was different in controls and UV light-irradiated cells (Fig. 2C); in controls, activity was found almost all in the supernatants but was barely detectable in pellets. In soluble extracts prepared 2 h after exposure to 200 J/m2, the activity was reduced, and the reduction was much more pronounced at 650 J/m2. Consistently, the opposite was found in pellets; positive supercoiling activity increased in UV light-irradiated cells in a dose-dependent manner. A quantitative comparison of reverse gyrase activity was obtained by calculating the relative amount of total products in each sample (Fig. 2D). Enzyme activity calculated in this way was in good agreement with the distribution of the polypeptide shown in Fig. 1C. We have shown in Fig. 1D that reverse gyrase can be solubilized from pellets by digestion with DNase I. In a similar experiment, we tested whether positive supercoiling activity could also be rescued in supernatants of UV light-irradiated cells (Fig. 3A). Because DNase I treatment would digest the substrate during the assay, extracts were prepared from aliquots of the same culture and either treated in the usual manner (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 2) or sonicated before the separation of supernatants and pellets (Fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 4). Because sonication solubilizes most protein, sonicated and nonsonicated extracts cannot be directly compared. Whereas in supernatants prepared from UV light-irradiated cells the reverse gyrase activity was reduced (Fig. 3A, compare lane 2 with lane 1), this difference was no longer observed in sonicated extracts (Fig. 3A, compare lane 4 with lane 3). Indeed, quantitation of results showed that, after sonication, the supernatants of control and UV light-irradiated cells showed similar efficiencies of product formation (Fig. 3B). From these data we concluded that the distribution of positive supercoiling activity was consistent with the distribution of the protein as determined by Western blotting. Analysis of Reverse Gyrase Cleavage Activity—The results shown in the previous paragraph suggest that the enzyme in pellets of UV-irradiated cells is fully active. However, crude extracts contain, in addition to reverse gyrase, other factors that regulate DNA topology (Topo III and Topo VI, DNA-binding proteins). Therefore, in our assay the observed topology might be the result of different (and opposite) activities. Moreover, positive supercoiling activity itself is a complex reaction (17Rodriguez A.C. Stock D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The catalytic cycle of topoisomerases can be dissected into four steps as follows: (i) DNA binding; (ii) cleavage; (iii) strand passage; and (iv) religation of the DNA ends (reviewed in Refs. 13Champoux J.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 369-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar and 28Wang J.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar). A covalent DNA-protein complex is formed as a transient intermediate; in particular, type IA topoisomerases form a phosphodiester bond between a DNA 5′-end and the catalytic tyrosine. It has been shown previously that covalent complexes between DNA and purified reverse gyrase can be trapped if reactions are performed in the absence of ATP and quickly blocked with detergents (29Jaxel C. Duguet M. Nadal M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and that the efficiency of covalent complex formation can be used as a measure of the cleavage activity of reverse gyrase (30Rodriguez A.C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5993-6004Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We set up a CCA to evaluate the efficiency of covalent complex formation as an independent direct measure of reverse gyrase activity. We incubated fractionated extracts with endlabeled oligonucleotides under the conditions described (29Jaxel C. Duguet M. Nadal M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar); complexes were visualized as radioactive protein bands in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4). Because reverse gyrase shows a certain degree of sequence preference (29Jaxel C. Duguet M. Nadal M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), we first screened several sequences for covalent complex formation (data not shown). We selected RGA, a 35-bp oligonucleotide, which was more effective than the previously characterized SA oligonucleotide (29Jaxel C. Duguet M. Nadal M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). When 3′-but not 5′-end-labeled RGA was incubated with purified reverse gyrase, radioactivity was found associated with the protein (which is ∼120 kDa), showing that reverse gyrase forms a covalent complex with a DNA 5′-end (Fig. 4B, lanes 2 and 4). A band of similar molecular weight was obtained incubating soluble cell extracts with 3′-but not 5′-end-labeled RGA (Fig. 4B, lanes 1 and 3). If, after complex formation, the reactions were incubated again at 70 °C, the complex disappeared in a few minutes, showing that it corresponds to a rapidly processed reaction intermediate (Fig. 4C). We then analyzed by CCA the effects of UV light irradiation on covalent complex formation in cell extracts. In soluble fractions, 30 min after irradiation the complex was formed with the same efficiency as in controls, regardless of the UV light dose used. However, 2 h after irradiation it was strongly reduced if 200 J/m2 were used and completely absent at 650 J/m2 (Fig. 5A). In contrast, complexes were formed more efficiently in pellets of UV light-irradiated cells than in controls (Fig. 5B). Exact quantitation of the efficiency of covalent complex formation was impaired by the transient nature of the intermediate and the lack of any possible internal control; the experiments were repeated several times with five independently prepared extracts and always confirmed that CCA-forming activity was reduced in supernatants and increased in pellets of UV light-irradiated cells. Taken together, our data strongly suggest that UV irradiation affects the localization but not the activity of reverse gyrase. Because no relocalization of reverse gyrase was observed until 30 min after UV light irradiation (Fig. 5A), it is possible that some intermediate events are involved in the recruitment of reverse gyrase onto DNA. However, pre-treatment with puromycin, an antibiotic that blocks protein synthesis in S. solfataricus (31Hjort K. Bernander R. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), did not prevent the UV light-dependent translocation of the covalent complex-forming activity, thus suggesting that it does not require the synthesis of new protein factors (data not shown). Effect of UV Light-induced DNA Lesions on Reverse Gyrase Activity—It has been shown that in vivo eukaryotic Topo I (a type IB enzyme) is rapidly mobilized to the genome after DNA damage and that in vitro Topo I-DNA covalent complexes are stabilized by DNA-damaging agents, including UV light (32Lanza A. Tornaletti S. Rodolfo C. Scanavini M.C. Pedrini A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6978-6986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 33Subramanian D. Rosenstein B.S. Muller M.T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 976-984PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the activity of Micrococcus luteus DNA topoisomerase I (a type IA enzyme) is also inhibited by UV light-induced lesions in vitro (34Pedrini A.M. Ciarrocchi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1787-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We analyzed the activity of reverse gyrase on DNA substrates exposed previously to UV light in vitro (Fig. 6A). Positive supercoiling activity of the enzyme, either purified or in supernatants, was strongly reduced by the presence of UV lesions; interestingly, the negative substrate was completely processed, but a nicked form accumulated, suggesting that the reaction was blocked after the cleavage and before the ligation step. We then analyzed directly by CCA the effect of UV lesions on the in vitro formation of reverse gyrase-DNA covalent complexes (Fig. 6B). Complexes were formed more efficiently when irradiated DNA was used as compared with controls. This effect is not sequence-specific, because the same result was obtained with either RGA or SA. These results indicated that it is the presence of UV lesions that stabilizes the covalent complexes. Effect of Actinomycin D on Reverse Gyrase Localization and Activity—Actinomycin D is an intercalating drug that induces a dual effect, i.e. direct DNA damage and a block of transcription. We have shown previously that, in S. solfataricus, actinomycin D, although blocking general transcription, induces specific transcriptional regulation of the same nucleotide excision repair and chromatin genes that are also regulated by UV light radiation (6Salerno V. Napoli A. White M.F. Rossi M. Ciaramella M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 6127-6138Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), thus suggesting that both UV light- and actinomycin D-induced DNA damage may elicit a similar response and be transduced by the same mechanism. We tested whether actinomycin D might affect reverse gyrase activity and/or distribution in vivo. Exponential cultures were treated with actinomycin D, and extracts were prepared and fractionated as described above. The dose used (10 μg/ml) and the duration of treatment (2 h) were shown previously to induce a DNA damage response in S. solfataricus (6Salerno V. Napoli A. White M.F. Rossi M. Ciaramella M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 6127-6138Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Aliquots of the same culture untreated with the drug were always used as controls. Level and distribution of reverse gyrase (Fig. 7A) and positive supercoiling activity (Fig. 7B) between supernatants and pellets of actinomycin D-treated cultures were similar to those in controls. Therefore actinomycin D, unlike UV light, does not induce translocation of reverse gyrase from the soluble to the insoluble fraction. We then tested directly the effect of actinomycin D addition on positive supercoiling activity (Fig. 7C). When added to reactions containing purified reverse gyrase or cell extracts, the drug inhibited positive supercoiling activity. However, it did not result in the accumulation of nicked plasmid, as was observed for UV-damaged substrates; rather, the substrate was left negatively supercoiled, suggesting that actinomycin D impairs early step(s) of the reaction before strand cleavage. Indeed, actinomycin D prevented the formation of the reverse gyrase-oligonucleotide covalent complex (Fig. 7D). This result strongly suggests that reverse gyrase inhibition by UV and actinomycin D follows a different mechanism. Actinomycin D inhibits type IB and II topoisomerases; however, whereas at low concentration it stimulates topoisomerase-induced cleavage, at higher concentrations it suppresses enzyme-mediated DNA cleavage (35Wassermann K. Markovits J. Jaxel C. Capranico G. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 38: 38-45PubMed Google Scholar). To our knowledge, this is the first report of an actinomycin D effect on a type IA topoisomerase. Using three independent techniques, we have shown that UV light radiation induces the translocation of reverse gyrase to DNA in vivo without affecting its total amount or activity (both strand cleavage and positive supercoiling). In vitro, reverse gyrase is blocked after the cleavage step by the presence of UV light-induced lesions. In contrast, actinomycin D, which has effects similar to UV light irradiation on gene expression in Sulfolobus (6Salerno V. Napoli A. White M.F. Rossi M. Ciaramella M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 6127-6138Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), does not induce translocation of reverse gyrase in vivo or stabilization of covalent complexes in vitro, thus showing that those effects are UV light-specific. Under the conditions used here, Sulfolobus genomic DNA contains a high number of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (6Salerno V. Napoli A. White M.F. Rossi M. Ciaramella M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 6127-6138Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar); although our experiments do not directly prove that this is the mechanism of reverse gyrase recruitment in vivo, the simplest explanation of our results is that UV light-induced lesions trap reverse gyrase onto DNA, forming relatively stable covalent complexes. Both UV light and actinomycin D have been reported to induce translocation of human Topo I (a type IB enzyme) to DNA in situ and to stabilize DNA-Topo I covalent complexes in vitro (32Lanza A. Tornaletti S. Rodolfo C. Scanavini M.C. Pedrini A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6978-6986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 33Subramanian D. Rosenstein B.S. Muller M.T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 976-984PubMed Google Scholar, 36Trask D.K. Muller M.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1417-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 37Mao Y. Okada S. Chang L.S. Muller M.T. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4538-4543PubMed Google Scholar, 38Mao Y Muller M.T. DNA Repair. 2003; 2: 1115-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The activity of M. luteus DNA topoisomerase I (which, like the topoisomerase domain of reverse gyrase, is a type IA enzyme) is also inhibited by UV light-induced lesions in vitro (34Pedrini A.M. Ciarrocchi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1787-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), but its association with DNA in vivo has not been tested. Actinomycin D is known to induce positive supercoiling of DNA and could inhibit reverse gyrase activity for this reason; however two lines of evidence suggest that this is not the case. First, ethidium bromide, which also induces positive supercoiling, does not inhibit the enzyme. 3A. Napoli and M. Ciaramella, unpublished observations. Second, actinomycin D prevents the cleavage of a linear substrate (Fig. 7D). No data have been reported so far on the effects of actinomycin D on type IA enzymes; the different behavior of reverse gyrase and eukaryal Topo I suggests that the effect of different DNA-damaging agents might be enzyme-specific. Several hypotheses can be made to explain the biological meaning of our results. Reverse gyrase recruited to DNA might assist repair, either directly or by signaling lesions and/or recalling repair factors. Interestingly, reverse gyrase N-terminal domain contains a RecA-type fold also found in the Escherichia coli nucleotide excision repair protein UvrB, and both proteins show non-processive strand displacement activity (17Rodriguez A.C. Stock D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). One attractive hypothesis is that the N-terminal part of reverse gyrase might work on UV light-irradiated DNA like UvrB. On the other hand, if UV lesions stabilize covalent complexes between reverse gyrase and DNA, such complexes might amplify the damage, exacerbating the cell response. Indeed, Topo I and Topo II cleavage complexes can be stabilized by enzyme-specific inhibitors, including potent anticancer drugs that induce DNA damage and checkpoint response (39Pommier Y. Redon C. Rao V.A. Seiler J.A. Sordet O. Takemura H. Antony S. Meng L. Liao Z. Kohlhagen G. Zhang H. Kohn K.W. Mutat. Res. 2003; 532: 173-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). No such drug is known for reverse gyrase (or other type IA topoisomerases). However, eukaryal Topo I is also blocked at UV light-damaged sites where it has been shown to interact with p53, suggesting a role for Topo I in the decision between repair and apoptosis (37Mao Y. Okada S. Chang L.S. Muller M.T. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4538-4543PubMed Google Scholar). A third possibility is that reverse gyrase engagement on DNA is a mechanism to reduce its activity, which might be needed to allow repair. Indeed in E. coli DNA lesions located on positively supercoiled regions are not repaired in vivo (40Park J.Y. Ahn B. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). However the actual topology of the DNA substrate in vivo during repair reaction is unknown, and studies on the effect of DNA topology on the activity of archaeal repair factors are lacking. Although further studies are required to distinguish among these hypothesis, we have shown that the chromatin-bound reverse gyrase is active, suggesting a functional recruitment of the enzyme rather that an inactivation mechanism. Although its function in vivo has never been demonstrated, reverse gyrase has been associated with adaptation to high temperature; we have shown that it is involved, directly or indirectly, in DNA damage response in Archaea. Moreover, our results might have more general implications. In several systems, the combination of helicase and topoisomerase activities has been shown to facilitate aspects of DNA replication or recombination by either introducing supercoiling or by helping to resolve replication or recombination intermediates (19Wu L. Karow J.K. Hickson I.D. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R518-R520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 20Chakraverty R.K. Kearsey J.M. Oakley T.J.

Immunolocalization of Topo III in fission yeast and human cells showed that, after the induction of DNA damage, these proteins form distinct nuclear foci that colocalize with the RecQ helicase homologs Rhq1 and BLM, respectively. Foci formation is stimulated by DNA damage (UV light or ionizing radiations) (42Bischof O. Kim S.H. Irving J. Beresten S. Ellis N.A. Campisi J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 367-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 43Laursen L.V. Ampatzidou E. Andersen A.H. Murray J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3692-3705Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Moreover, in mitotic cells BLM is dephosphorylated and translocated to DNA after γ-ray irradiation; however, whether the chromatin-bound BLM is also associated with Topo III has not been determined (44Dutertre S. Sekhri R. Tintignac L.A. Onclercq-Delic R. Chatton B. Jaulin C. Amor-Gueret M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6280-6286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Our observations that reverse gyrase (consisting of a helicase and a topoisomerase domain) is translocated to DNA after the induction of DNA damage raises the possibility that helicases like RecQ might be recruited to damaged DNA through their association with topoisomerases.

Expression of SREBP-1 is enhanced by insulin; however, the actual insulin-signaling cascades employed are yet unclear. We determined the roles of the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase-dependent pathways in the effect of mediating insulin on SREBP-1 in L-6 skeletal muscle cells and 3T3 L1 adipocytes, using wortmannin or LY294002 to inhibit the PI 3-kinase pathway, and PD98059 to inhibit the MAP kinase-dependent pathway. In myocytes, insulin increased SREBP-1 protein in a dose-dependent manner. 1 and 10 nm insulin significantly increased expression of total cellular SREBP-1 protein at 24 and 48 h, nuclear SREBP-1 protein at 24 h, and SREBP-1a mRNA at 24 h. Although wortmannin and LY294002 had no effect on this aspect of insulin action, PD98059 completely blocked each of these responses. Transfection of a dominant negative mutant of Ras similarly blocked the insulin effect on SREBP-1. In contrast, in adipocytes, the insulin effect on SREBP-1 was mediated via the PI 3-kinase and not the MAP kinase pathway. In conclusion, although insulin increases skeletal muscle SREBP-1 expression in a dose-dependent fashion via the MAP kinase-dependent signaling pathway, insulin action on adipocyte SREBP-1 is mediated via the PI 3-kinase signaling pathway. In the state of insulin resistance, characterized by selective inhibition of the PI 3-kinase pathway, the usual stimulation of lipogenesis by insulin in adipocytes may be inhibited, whereas intramyocellular lipogenesis via the MAP kinase pathway of insulin may continue unabated.

Dyslipidemia, high levels of free fatty acids, and ectopic fat deposition are frequently associated with insulin resistance, but the mechanisms of these associations are incompletely understood. However, the pathways regulating the production of such lipids are beginning to be unraveled. Expression of the genes involved in the production and uptake of cholesterol, fatty acids, triglycerides, phospholipids, and the low density lipoprotein receptor is regulated by a group of membrane-bound transcription factors called sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) 1The abbreviations used are: SREBP, sterol regulatory element-binding protein; PI, phosphatidylinositol; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; WT, wortmannin; LY, LY294002; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, MAP kinase/ERK kinase. 1The abbreviations used are: SREBP, sterol regulatory element-binding protein; PI, phosphatidylinositol; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; WT, wortmannin; LY, LY294002; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, MAP kinase/ERK kinase. (1Horton J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 1125-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (3632) Google Scholar). There are three isoforms of SREBP, designated SREBP-1a, SREBP-1c, and SREBP-2. Although SREBP-1a can stimulate all SREBP-responsive genes, SREBP-1c preferentially activates fatty acid synthetic genes, and SREBP-2 activates mainly cholesterol synthesis genes (2Brown M. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2918) Google Scholar). Expression of SREBP-1 is enhanced by insulin in all three major insulin target tissues: liver, fat, and skeletal muscle (3Foretz M. Guichard C. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1035-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Similarly, levels of SREBP-1 are increased in the presence of hyperinsulinemia (7Boizard M. Le Liepvre X. Lemarchand P.

A. 2000; 97: 8536-8541Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Conversely, insulin deficiency leads to a decrease in SREBP-1 (6Sewter C. Berger D. Considine R.V. Medina G. Rochford J. Ciaraldi T. Henry R. Dohm L. Flier J.S. O'Rahilly S. Vidal-Puig A.J. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1035-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). For example, in insulin-deficient streptozotocin-treated rats, hepatic SREBP-1c mRNA levels fall and can be rescued by insulin injection (10Shimomura I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13656-13661Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Streptozotocin also decreases muscle SREBP-1 and specifically SREBP-1c mRNA in rats (4Guillet-Deniau I. Mieulet V. Lay S.L. Achouri Y. Carre D. Girard J. Foufelle F. Ferre P. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1722-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Hepatic SREBP-1c is similarly inhibited by glucagon and by fasting, which lower insulin production and increase glucagon levels (11Foretz M. Pacot C. Dugail I. Le Marchand P. Guichard C. Le Liepvre X. Berthelier-Lubrano C. Spiegelman B. Kim J.B. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 3760-3768Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 12Horton J. Bashmakov Y. Shimomura I. Shimano H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5987-5992Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Refeeding stimulates hepatic nuclear SREBP-1c expression, presumably by restoring insulin secretion (10Shimomura I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13656-13661Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). In vivo results from the human state of insulin resistance are complex. Base-line skeletal muscle SREBP-1 mRNA levels are similar in lean and obese subjects (6Sewter C. Berger D. Considine R.V. Medina G. Rochford J. Ciaraldi T. Henry R. Dohm L. Flier J.S. O'Rahilly S. Vidal-Puig A.J. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1035-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In contrast, adipose tissue expression of SREBP-1 is decreased in obese versus lean subjects and further reduced in obese diabetic subjects (6Sewter C. Berger D. Considine R.V. Medina G. Rochford J. Ciaraldi T. Henry R. Dohm L. Flier J.S. O'Rahilly S. Vidal-Puig A.J. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1035-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 13Ducluzeau P. Perretti N. Laville M. Andreelli F. Vega N. Riou J.P. Vidal H. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1134-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Therefore, the pathways used by insulin to stimulate SREBP-1 expression may not be the same in adipocytes and skeletal muscle. The mechanism of insulin action involves at least two pathways of intracellular signaling. The phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase-dependent pathway controls most, if not all, metabolic aspects of insulin action, whereas the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase-dependent pathway controls the mitogenic effects of insulin (14Okada T. Kawano Y. Sakakibara T. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3568-3573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Kim S. Kahn C.R. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 621-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Insulin resistance is accompanied by various degrees of impairment in PI 3-kinase signaling, causing impaired utilization of glucose, hyperglycemia (16Miyake K. Ogwa W. Matsumoto M. Nakamura T. Sakaue H. Kasuga M. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 1483-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and compensatory hyperinsulinemia. In contrast, the MAP kinase pathway does not appear defective in the presence of insulin resistance (17Cusi K. Maezono K. Osman A. Pendergrass M. Patti M.E. Pratipanawatr T. DeFronzo R.A. Kahn C.R. Mandarino L.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar, 18Jiang Z.Y. Lin Y.W. Clemont A. Feener E.P. Hein K.D. Igarashi M. Yamauchi T. White M.F. King G.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 447-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Conceivably, compensatory hyperinsulinemia may continue to activate the MAP kinase pathway, which is left intact in insulin resistance (19Carlson C. Sciotti R.J. Poccard G.B. Rondinone C.M. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 634-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 20Montagnani M. Golovchenko I. Kim I. Koh G.Y. Goalstone M.L. Mundhekar A.N. Johansen M. Kucik D.F. Quon M.J. Draznin B. J.

Cell. 2000; 6: 77-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). This could increase products downstream of the MAP kinase pathway, despite insulin resistance in the PI 3-kinase pathway. If the mechanism of insulin action on SREBP-1 involves predominately the MAP kinase pathway in skeletal muscle, then insulin-stimulated expression of SREBP-1 would remain intact in the insulin-resistant state or even enhanced in the presence of compensatory hyperinsulinemia. In contrast, if insulin stimulates SREBP-1 via the PI 3-kinase pathway in adipocytes, SREBP-1 expression would not increase during insulin resistance. Together, decreased lipid deposition in adipocytes and increased lipogenesis in skeletal muscle may partly explain the ectopic lipid deposition seen in insulin resistance. We assessed this possibility in L-6 skeletal muscle cells and 3T3 L1 adipocytes grown in culture and subjected to insulin and inhibitors of the insulin signaling pathways. Materials—The L-6 muscle cell line, derived from rat thigh muscle tissue, was originally obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Fetal bovine serum was purchased from Gemini Bio-Products (Woodland, CA). The cell culture medium used was 1× Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium from Cellgro (Herndon, VA). LY294002, phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase antibody, and p44/42 MAP kinase antibody were obtained from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA), and PD 98059 was from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). The spectrophotometer was the DU 640 by Beckman (Fullerton, CA). The densitometer was the Flour-S MultiImager from Bio-Rad, using the Quantity One version 4.1.1 software. Also from Bio-Rad were the 12% Tris-HCl gel, the Kaleidoscope prestained standards, the polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, the iCycler system for quantitative real time PCR, and the SYBR Green Supermix for real time PCR. The Speedvac Concentrator was from Savant (Holbrook, NY). The nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagent kit was from Pierce, and the protease inhibitor mixture used with the nuclear protein extraction kit was from Sigma. The MagicMark Western Standard and the SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System for real time PCR reagents used for cDNA synthesis were from Invitrogen. The SREBP-1 antibody was a monoclonal IgG from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The ECL Western blotting analysis system was from Amersham Biosciences. The l-α-phosphatidylinositol used in the PI 3-kinase assay was from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). The TLC plates were from Fisher. RNA STAT-60 was from Tel-Test B, Inc (Friendswood, TX). The SREBP-1c primer sequence was 5′-GGAGCCATGGATTGCACATTGGCCCGGGAAGTCACTGT-3′ (22Yang J. Goldstein J.L. Hammer R.E. Moon Y.A. Brown M.S. Horton J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13607-13612Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). The dominant negative mutant of Ras adenovirus was obtained from James De Gregori, Ph.D. (University of Colorado Health Sciences, Denver, CO). All other reagents and chemicals including insulin and wortmannin were from Sigma. Cell Culture—L-6 muscle cells (passages 2–6) were grown in a 75-mm flask at 37 °C in medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 4.5 gm/liter l-glutamine, 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, and 4.5 g/liter glucose, supplemented with 112 ml/liter fetal bovine serum, 88 units/ml penicillin, and 88 μg/ml streptomycin. At 60% confluence, the cells were subcultured to individual plates (60 mm for total cellular protein extraction, 150 mm for nuclear protein extraction) and grown again to 60% confluence. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were grown to confluence at 37 °C in fibroblast growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5.5 mm glucose, 10% fetal calf serum, 50 μg/ml gentamycin, 0.5 mm glutamine, and 0.5 μg/ml fungizone). Differentiation was initiated by the addition of medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mm glutamine, 500 μm isobutylmethylxanthine, 1 μm dexamethasone, and 1 μg/ml insulin. After 2 days, the cells were transferred to adipocyte growth medium containing 25 mm glucose, 50 μg/ml gentamycin, 0.5 mm glutamine, and 1 μg/ml insulin and refed every 2 days. All of the cells were then incubated for 24 h in serum-free medium and then treated with either no additions as a control, 1 nm insulin, 10 nm insulin, 100 nm wortmannin (WT; a PI 3-kinase inhibitor), 50 μm LY294002 (LY; a structurally distinct inhibitor of the PI 3-kinase pathway), or 20 mm PD 98059 (PD; a specific MAP kinase-kinase inhibitor), in various combinations. To create the insulin dose-response curve, L-6 muscle cells were incubated for 24 h in serum-free medium and then treated for 24 h with 0, 0.1, 1, 5, 10, or 100 nm insulin. To create the time course, L-6 muscle cells were incubated for 24 h in serum-free medium and then harvested for protein and mRNA immediately (time 0), at 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 h after the addition of 10 nm insulin. In experiments using the dominant negative mutant of Ras, green fluorescent protein-labeled adenoviral-dominant negative Ras construct, green fluorescent protein-labeled adenovirus, or adenovirus alone as controls were added to the L-6 cells or differentiated 3T3 L1 adipocytes, 24 h prior to serum starving. Preparation of Total Cellular Extracts—For the preparation of total cellular protein, the cells were incubated with the respective treatments for 24 or 48 h. The media and treatments were refreshed every 24 h. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed on ice in lysis buffer (containing 50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 0.05% SDS, 10 μg/ml aprotonin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, pH 7.5), scraped, sonicated for 20 s, and then centrifuged. The supernatant was retained, and protein concentration was quantified using a bicinchoninic acid standard curve on a DU 640 spectrophotometer. 100 μg of each sample was dried by the Speedvac Concentrator, reconstituted in Laemmli Buffer, and stored at –20 °C. Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—After 24 h of treatment, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, lifted with Trypsin-EDTA, centrifuged, and washed again. Nuclear protein was prepared with the Pierce nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction kit according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The final nuclear extract was assayed for protein concentration as above. 100 μg of each sample was dried by the Speedvac Concentrator, reconstituted in Laemmli Buffer, and stored at –80 °C. PI 3-Kinase Activity Measurements—Total cellular extracts (500 ng of protein) were mixed with PI 3-kinase buffer, water, sonicated lipid (l-α-phosphatidylinositol dried and sonicated in sonication buffer), and [32P]ATP mix. After stopping the reaction with stop solution, the organic layer was extracted with chloroform and dried by Speedvac. The pellet was reconstituted in chloroform/methanol and spotted on TLC plates, which were run overnight in TLC tank with running buffer. The TLC plates were then exposed to x-ray film, and spot density was determined by densitometry. Western Blotting—The total cellular and nuclear extracts were boiled for 10 min, and 25 μg of protein/lane was resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12% Tris-HCl gel). MagicMark and Kaleidoscope standards were used to identify the molecular weight. The protein was then electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using the standard Western blotting technique (100 V for 1 h). The membranes were prehybridized with nonfat powdered milk (or bovine serum albumin for phospho-p44/42 and p/44/42 MAP kinase antibodies) and hybridized with mouse monoclonal anti-SREBP-1 antibody or rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase antibody or rabbit polyclonal anti-p44/42 MAP kinase antibody in a 1:500 dilution. The membranes were then incubated with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase in a 1:1000 dilution, and protein was detected by chemiluminescence with the ECL Western blotting analysis system. The hybridized membranes were exposed to x-ray film, and the band intensity was measured with the densitometer. Preparation of RNA Extracts—Cells were grown and treated as described for 24 h. Total RNA was then prepared with RNA STAT-60, a suspension of guanidinium thiocyanate and phenol. Chloroform was added to extract the RNA and isopropanol to precipitate the RNA. The resulting pellet was washed with 75% ETOH, air-dried, reconstituted with RNase-free sterile water, diluted 1:10 with sodium phosphate, and the concentration was measured on the DU 640 spectrophotometer. The samples were denatured for 5 min at 65 °C and electrophoresed in a 1.2% agarose denaturing gel containing 1× MOPS, 6% formaldehyde, and diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water (75 volts for 1–2 h) for quality assessment. Total RNA was reverse-transcribed using the SuperScript first strand synthesis system kit for real time PCR, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The samples were incubated at 65 °C for 5 min and then on ice for at least 1 min, followed by the addition of 10× reverse transcription buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm KCl, pH 8.4), 25 mm Mg Cl2, 0.1 m dithiothreitol, and RNaseOUT recombinant ribonuclease inhibitor. After incubation at 25 °C for 2 min, SuperScript II H– Reverse Transcriptase (50 units/μl) was added, and the samples were incubated at 25 °C for 10 min, 42 °C for 50 min, and 70 °C for 15 min. To remove the RNA, 1 μl of Escherichia coli RNase H (2 units/μl), was added to the cDNA product. The cDNA was then quantified using quantitative real time reverse transcriptase PCR. The PCR contained the newly generated cDNA template, iQ SYBR Green Supermix, sterile water, and forward and reverse SREBP-1c primers. Real time PCR was performed with the iCycler system (one cycle of 95 °C for 90 s, 40 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, followed by 60 °C for 60 s, and one cycle of 95 °C for 60 s). A melt curve of 80 cycles, starting at 55 °C and increasing by 0.5 degrees every 10 s, was done to determine primer specificity. Expression levels were calculated by the relative method, by comparing the target and amount of 18 S RNA subunit, according to the manufacturer. Data Analysis—Between 7 and 18 individual experiments were performed in duplicate for the total and nuclear protein experiments, 3 individual experiments in duplicate for real time PCR, and 2 in duplicate for adenoviral transfection of the dominant negative Ras. The results are expressed as the means ± the standard error of the mean. An unpaired t test, with a p value of <0.05 was used to determine statistical significance. Insulin Dose-Response Curve in L-6 Skeletal Muscle Cells— Insulin increased SREBP-1 protein in nuclear extracts in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 1). SREBP-1 expression was enhanced 50% of maximum at 0.5 nm insulin and 100% of maximum at 100 nm insulin. Therefore, subsequent experiments were performed at 1 and 10 nm to represent hyperinsulinemia. Effectiveness of Inhibitors—To verify the effectiveness of the inhibitors used in this study, we measured PI 3-kinase activity and the phosphorylation of p44/42 ERK (MAP kinases) in control and insulin-treated cells incubated with WT, LY, or PD compounds. Insulin significantly stimulated PI 3-kinase activity in control and PD-treated cells. As expected, there was a 75–90% inhibition of the PI 3-kinase activity with WT and LY in L-6 myocytes (Fig. 2A), and a 70–75% inhibition with WT and LY in 3T3 L1 adipocytes (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2Inhibition of PI 3-kinase activity by wortmannin and LY294002 compounds. PI 3-kinase activity was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures,” in control cells, and in cells treated with insulin (10 nm) either alone or in the presence of WT, LY, or PD. A, a representative experiment performed in L-6 skeletal muscle cells in duplicate is shown. Overall, there was 75–90% inhibition of the PI 3-kinase activity with WT and LY in L-6 cells. B, a representative experiment performed in 3T3 L1 adipocytes in duplicate is shown. There was 70–75% inhibition of the PI 3-kinase activity with WT and LY in 3T3 L1 cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Insulin significantly stimulated ERK phosphorylation in control and WT- and LY-treated L-6 skeletal muscle cells (Fig. 3). In contrast, inhibition of MAP kinase activity reached 80% in the presence of PD (Fig. 3). Abundance of p44/42 ERK isoforms was identical in all L-6 cells (Fig. 3). In subsequent experiments we examined the roles of the PI 3-kinase and MAP kinase-dependent signaling pathways in insulin-mediated SREBP-1 expression. Total Cellular SREBP-1 Protein in L-6 Skeletal Muscle Cells—Insulin (1 nm) significantly increased the expression of total cellular SREBP-1 protein at 24 h (p < 0.03) (Fig. 4A) and 48 h (p = 0.02) (Fig. 4B). This response was dose-dependent, with insulin (10 nm) further increasing total cellular SREBP-1 at 24 h (p < 0.0001) and 48 h (p = 0.001) (Fig. 4). WT, blocking the PI 3-kinase pathway, had no effect on the ability of insulin to increase total cellular SREBP-1 at either 24 or 48 h (Fig. 4). LY, a structurally distinct inhibitor of the PI 3-kinase pathway, similarly had no effect on insulin stimulation of SREBP-1 at 24 h (not shown). In contrast, PD, blocking the MAP kinase pathway, completely inhibited insulin-induced increases in total cellular SREBP-1 at 24 h in response to 1 nm (p < 0.0001) and 10 nm insulin (p < 0.0001) (Fig. 4A). PD continued to block insulin-induced increases in SREBP-1 at 48 h in response to 1 nm (p < 0.01) and 10 nm insulin (p < 0.001) (Fig. 4B). Neither WT, LY, nor PD compounds alone had any effect on SREBP-1 expression at either time point (data not shown). To confirm the role of the Ras-MAP kinase pathway in mediating insulin effect on SREBP-1 in skeletal muscle, the mycoytes were transduced with adenovirus containing a dominant negative mutant of Ras. Expression of the dominant negative Ras completely blocked the ability of insulin to stimulate SREBP-1 expression in the absence or presence of WT (Fig. 5). Nuclear SREBP-1 Protein in L-6 Skeletal Muscle Cells— SREBP exhibits its action in the cell nucleus. Therefore, we determined the effect of insulin on expression of nuclear SREBP-1, which may better reflect physiologically relevant aspects of insulin action on SREBP-1. Insulin significantly increased the expression of nuclear SREBP-1 protein at 24 h (p < 0.001 and p < 0.0001 at 1 and 10 nm, respectively) (Fig. 6). WT had no effect on the ability of insulin to increase SREBP-1 nuclear protein (Fig. 6). However, PD blocked insulin-stimulated increases in nuclear SREBP-1 protein at 1 nm (p < 0.0001) and 10 nm insulin (p = 0.0001) (Fig. 6). As with the total cellular SREBP-1, neither WT nor PD compound alone had any effect on SREBP-1 protein expression in the nucleus (not shown). mRNA in L-6 Skeletal Muscle Cells—We then assessed the effect of insulin on SREBP-1 expression at the mRNA level. Quantitative real time PCR analysis showed an increase in SREBP-1c mRNA expression with the addition of 10 nm insulin at 24 h (p < 0.05) (Fig. 7). The addition of WT had no effect on stimulation of SREBP-1c mRNA by insulin (Fig. 7). However, in concert with the results observed at the protein level, the addition of PD blocked the ability of insulin to stimulate SREBP-1c mRNA expression in L-6 cells (p < 0.04) (Fig. 7). Insulin Time Course in L-6 Skeletal Muscle Cells—To examine the effect of insulin on SREBP-1 expression at earlier time points, we measured the amounts of total cellular SREBP-1 protein and SREBP-1c mRNA at 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 h. Insulin (10 nm) increased both SREBP-1 total cellular protein (Fig. 8A) and SREBP-1c mRNA (Fig. 8B) in a time-dependent manner. Levels of SREBP-1 plateaued at 12 h and remained relatively stable and insignificantly different between 12 and 24 h in both protein and mRNA. Insulin Effect on SREBP-1 in 3T3 L1 Adipocytes—To better understand the physiological implications of insulin action on SREBP-1, we compared the results obtained in L-6 muscle cells with those in 3T3 L1 adipocytes. 1 and 10 nm insulin increased SREBPB-1 protein expression in total cell lysates (Fig. 9). In contrast to L-6 muscle cells, both inhibitors of the PI 3-kinase pathway (WT and LY) completely blocked the effect of insulin on SREBP-1 expression (Fig. 9; p < 0.01) in 3T3 L1 adipocytes. Blockade of the MAP kinase signaling pathway with PD did not alter the effect of insulin on SREBP-1 in these cells. To confirm the role of the Ras-MAP kinase pathway in mediating insulin effect on SREBP-1 in adipocytes, the cells were transduced with adenovirus containing a dominant negative mutant of Ras. Expression of the dominant negative Ras had no effect on insulin stimulation of SREBP-1 protein (Fig. 5), but the insulin effect was still blocked by WT. Insulin resistance is a condition in which maintenance of normal blood glucose values requires higher than normal insulin concentrations (23Olefsky J. Nolan J.J. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1995; 61: 980S-986SCrossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), resulting in hyperinsulinemia. A critical unresolved question is whether compensatory hyperinsulinemia is merely a marker of insulin resistance or has direct detrimental effects. Insulin exerts its action through two major signaling pathways. The PI 3-kinase-dependent pathway controls most, if not all, of the metabolic actions of insulin (14Okada T. Kawano Y. Sakakibara T. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3568-3573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the MAP kinase-dependent pathway regulates the mitogenic aspects of insulin action (15Kim S. Kahn C.R. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 621-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that if the hyperinsulinemia of insulin resistance in skeletal muscle is due to a selective impairment of PI 3-kinase, insulin regulation of SREBP-1 by MAP kinase would increase SREBP-1. Secondarily, increased SREBP-1 would up-regulate known downstream targets, increasing lipid synthesis and deposition in skeletal muscle. In contrast, insulin regulation of SREBP-1 by PI 3-kinase in adipocytes would decrease lipid deposition in adipocytes. Thus, although the term insulin resistance implies global impairment, the existence of selective resistance would paradoxically cause a combination of decreased insulin action (hyperglycemia and decreased fat deposition in adipocytes) and increased insulin action (ectopic lipid deposition in skeletal muscle) in one person. The results reported here support this hypothesis, by demonstrating three critical points. First, SREBP-1 is up-regulated in a dose-dependent fashion by insulin in L-6 skeletal muscle cells (Fig. 1) and is similarly up-regulated in 3T3 L1 adipocytes (Fig. 9). Second, the dose-dependent stimulatory effect of insulin on SREBP-1 expression in myocytes remains intact in the presence of PI 3-kinase i"
https://openalex.org/W2171787464,"Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a bile acid sensor that regulates the expression of a number of genes the products of which control bile acid and cholesterol homeostasis; however, the role of DRIP205 in FXR-mediated gene regulation remains unexplored. In this study we demonstrate that DRIP205 binds FXR in a ligand-dependent manner in vitro and in vivo. Glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays showed that DRIP205 binds FXR in response to bile acid ligands in a dose-dependent fashion and that the potency of this interaction is associated with the ability of the ligand to activate FXR. In addition, the FXR-DRIP205 interaction required the presence of an intact LXXLL nuclear receptor box 1 (N-terminal) motif of DRIP205. In gel shift assays FXR was also able to recruit DRIP205 in the context of a DNA-bound FXR/RXR (retinoid X receptor) heterodimer. In transient transfection assays, DRIP205 efficiently enhanced a bile acid-activated FXRE-driven reporter gene in a dose-dependent manner in cells overexpressing FXR/RXR, demonstrating that DRIP205 enhances FXR-mediated transactivation. By contrast, an FXRW469A mutant in the activation function 2 domain that does not bind to DRIP205 was unable to activate ligand-stimulated FXR transcription, indicating that DRIP205 is recruited to activation function 2 of FXR. Requirement for the FXR/RXR heterodimer in the DRIP205-FXR interaction was evaluated using an RXR heterodimerization-deficient FXR mutant (FXRL433R). FXRL433R was not able to bind to DRIP205 and failed to enhance an FXRE-driven reporter gene. In addition, DRIP205 was unable to induce FXR-mediated transactivation in the absence of RXR overexpression, indicating that FXR heterodimerization with RXR is required for coactivation by DRIP205. Finally, in HepG2 cells, overexpression or reduction of DRIP205 levels modulated the induction of endogenous FXR target gene mRNA expression by ligand. Together, these results demonstrate that DRIP205 acts as a bona fide coactivator of FXR and underscore the importance of DRIP205 in modulating the bile acid response of FXR target genes.

Bile acids serve a number of important physiological functions, including the solubilization of cholesterol, fat-soluble vitamins, and other lipids in the intestine. In liver, conversion of cholesterol to the primary bile acids, cholic acid (CA) 1The abbreviations used are: CA, cholic acid; FXR, farnesoid X receptor; RXR, retinoid X receptor; AF, activation function; CDCA, chenodeoxycholic acid; DCA, deoxycholic acid; FXRE, farnesoid X response element; GR, glucocorticoid receptor; IR, inverted repeat; VDR, vitamin D receptor; TR, thyroid hormone receptor; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; RAR, retinoid acid receptor; ER, estrogen receptor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; aa, amino acid; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; NR, nuclear receptor; SRC-1, steroid receptor coactivator-1; BSEP, bile salt export pump; siRNA, small interfering RNA; AR, androgen receptor; UGT2B4, uridine 5′-diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase 2B4 gene promoter; cds, charcoal-dextran-stripped. and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), involves the so-called neutral and acidic pathways, respectively (1Vlahcevic Z.R. Pandak W.M. Stravitz R.T. Gastroenterol. Clin. North Am. 1999; 28: 1-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). CDCA and CA can be further modified by intestinal bacteria to secondary bile acids, principally deoxycholic acid (DCA) and lithocholic acid. More than 95% of all bile acids are present as glycine or taurine conjugates. Conjugation of bile acids increases their solubility while prohibiting free movement of bile acids across cell membranes, and thus tissues involved in the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids harbor transporters to facilitate bile acid uptake and efflux (2Love M.W. Dawson P.A. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1998; 9: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Because of their intrinsic toxicity, bile acids must be tightly regulated. This is accomplished by transcriptionally regulating genes encoding proteins involved in bile acid biosynthesis, uptake, intracellular transport, export, and metabolism. The farnesoid X receptor (FXR, NR1H4) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors that has been described as a master regulator of bile acid and cholesterol metabolism and plasma triglyceride concentrations (3Chiang J.Y. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 443-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). FXR is expressed in tissues exposed to bile acids, including the liver and intestine, and in kidney and adrenal cortex (4Forman B.M. Goode E. Chen J. Oro A.E. Bradley D.J. Perlmann T. Nooman D.J.

FXR can also be activated by DCA, CA, and lithocholic acid and their conjugated derivatives, albeit to a lesser extent. FXR is activated by bile acids and regulates transcription by binding as a heterodimer with RXR to response elements (FXREs) within the regulatory regions of target genes (3Chiang J.Y. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 443-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Most FXREs consist of an inverted repeat of the canonical hexanucleotide core motif AGGTCA spaced by one base pair (IR-1). However, the FXR/RXR heterodimer can also bind to other response elements both in vitro (9Laffitte B.A. Kast H.R. Nguyen C.M. Zavacki A.M. Moore D.D. Edwards P.A. J. Biol.

In addition, FXR can bind as a monomer to induce the uridine 5′-diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase 2B4 gene promoter (UGT2B4) (14Barbier O. Torra I.P. Sirvent A. Claudel T. Blanquart C.

FXR acts as a bile acid sensor inducing the transcription of a cohort of genes involved in the reduction of bile acid concentrations within the hepatocyte. Activation of FXR also results in the repression of crucial genes in the bile acid biosynthetic pathway, namely CYP7A1 and CYP8B1 (3Chiang J.Y. Endocr.

This class of coactivators is thought to function, at least in part, via nucleosome remodeling by its intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activities, which allows in turn the recruitment of the general transcriptional machinery and subsequent formation of a functional preinitiation complex (27Rachez C. Freedman L.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 274-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). A distinct coactivator, the vitamin D receptor (VDR)-interacting protein (DRIP)/thyroid hormone receptor (TR)-associated protein complex, is composed of at least 15 different subunits, does not possess intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity, and appears to link the receptor directly to the core promoter and the general transcription factor machinery (27Rachez C. Freedman L.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 274-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). This complex is anchored to nuclear receptors mostly in a ligand-dependent manner by a single component referred to as PPAR-binding protein/DRIP205/TRAP220 (with the exception of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) (28Hittelman A.B.

A more recent study describing the partial rescue of embryos by tetraploid aggregation demonstrates that DRIP205 plays a critical role in both normal placental function and cardiovascular development before embryonic day 11.5 and is also essential in hepatic development thereafter (44Landles C.

Furthermore, mouse primary embryonic fibroblasts devoid of DRIP205 show an impaired cell cycle regulation and a defective TR transcriptional activity, although transcriptional regulation by other regulators that also bind DRIP205, such as RAR, VP-16, and p53, remains unaltered in those cells (42Ito M. Yuan C.X. Okano H.J. Darnell R.B. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 683-693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). DRIP205-null cells also exhibit defective adipogenesis and PPARγ-dependent activation, which can be rescued by ectopic DRIP205 expression (45Ge K. Guermah M. Yuan C.X. Ito M. Wallberg A.E. Spiegelman B.M. Roeder R.G. Nature. 2002; 417: 563-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). In an effort to define the molecular determinants of FXR transcriptional activity we investigated whether DRIP205 plays a functional role in FXR-mediated gene expression. In the present study we demonstrate that DRIP205 binds FXR in response to bile acids in a bile acid- and dose-dependent fashion. In transient transfection assays, the ligand-activated activity of an FXRE-driven reporter gene is efficiently enhanced by DRIP205 in a way that requires an intact AF2 domain in FXR. Using an RXR heterodimerization-deficient FXR mutant (FXRL433R) we observe that FXR heterodimerization with RXR is required for coactivation by DRIP205. Finally, in HepG2 cells, overexpression or reduction of DRIP205 levels modulates the induction of FXR target gene mRNA expression by CDCA. In concert, these data demonstrate that DRIP205 acts as a bona fide coactivator of FXR and underscore the role of DRIP205 in modulating the bile acid response of FXR target genes.

Equal amounts of proteins used in pull-down and electrophoretic mobility shift assays were ensured by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue staining of the proteins. GST Pull-down Assays—GST fusion proteins, GST-SRC1 (aa 613–773), GST-DRIP205 (aa 527–774), GST-DRIP205 (aa 527–974), GST-DRIP205-mutNR1, and GST-DRIP205-mutNR2 immobilized in glutathione-Sepharose beads were preincubated in binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 170 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm dithiothreitol) in the presence of ligands or vehicle for 30 min to 1 h at 4 °C. In vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled (TnT transcription/translation system, Promega) full-length human FXR, the mutated FXRL433R (pcDNA3-FXR and pcDNA3-FXRL433R), or the mutated FXRW469A (pCMX-FXRW469A) was incubated with the immobilized fusion proteins for 4 h to overnight at 4 °C. Beads were then washed four times in binding buffer containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Each assay was performed at least twice with similar results. Cell Culture and Transient Transfections—COS-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells were seeded on 24-well plates at a density of 4 × 104 and cells were transfected in phenol red-free, serum-free medium using the cationic polymer Exgen 500 (MBI Fermentas) following the manufacturer's instructions as described (12Pineda Torra I. Claudel T. Duval C. Kosykh V. Fruchart J.C. Staels B. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 259-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). After transfection, medium was supplemented with CDCA and 10% FBS, and luciferase activity was assayed 36 h later. Luciferase units were normalized to the protein content in each well as determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay. HepG2 cells were grown at 37 °C in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mm glutamine, and 0.1 mm non-essential amino acids in dishes coated with 0.1% gelatin. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—In vitro translated FXR and RXRα (TnT transcription/translation system, Promega) were incubated in the presence of CDCA (100 μm) in binding buffer (12Pineda Torra I. Claudel T. Duval C. Kosykh V. Fruchart J.C. Staels B. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 259-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) for 30 min at 4 °C. Then equal amounts of purified cofactors as GST fusion proteins and a γ-[32P]ATP radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide encompassing the consensus IR-1 response element were added sequentially. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature reactions were loaded on a 6% polyacrylamide nondenaturing gel and separated in 0.25× Tris-borate-EDTA buffer at 4 °C. Gels were dried prior to autoradiography. RNA Interference—A pool of four small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes with UU overhangs and a 5′ phosphate on the antisense strand specific for human DRIP205 (SMARTpool-DRIP205) was designed and synthesized (Dharmacon Research, Lafayette, CO) using the SMART selection and SMARTpooling technologies. As a control a nonspecific pooled duplex control (D-001206-13) was employed. For experiments where endogenous expression of DRIP205 was inhibited HepG2 cells were plated in 6-well plates at 50–60% confluency the day before transfection. Cells were transfected twice with a 20-h interval with 300 pmol of siRNA duplexes (150 nm final concentration) using Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After the second transfection, medium was replaced by fresh phenol red-free DMEM supplemented with 10% charcoal-dextranstripped FBS (cds-FBS) (Hyclone) for 4 h. Thereafter, medium was changed to phenol red-free DMEM with 0.5% cds-FBS supplemented with 50 μm CDCA, and cells were harvested for RNA extraction 24 h later. For experiments where ectopic expression of DRIP205 was inhibited HepG2 cells were cultured as described above and cotransfected with 500 ng of pcDNA3-DRIP205 and 200 pmol of siRNA duplexes using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen). After 4 h, the medium was changed to fresh phenol red-free DMEM supplemented with 10% cds-FBS for 16 h. Then, medium was changed to phenol red-free DMEM with 0.5% cds-FBS supplemented with 50 μm CDCA, and cells were harvested for RNA extraction 36 h later. Western Blot Analysis—HepG2 cells were transfected with 300 pmol of siRNA duplexes using Oligofectamine, and cells were subsequently incubated with CDCA for 24 h as described above. Whole cell extracts were prepared by lysing cells in SKL lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm NaF, 25 mm ZnCl2, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem), and 1 mm benzamidine) for 30 min at 4 °C. After preclearing the lysates by centrifugation, protein concentration was measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay, and 25 μg of cell extracts were boiled in SDS sample buffer. Protein extracts were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon membrane, and probed with a mouse monoclonal antibody against DRIP205 generated against bacterially expressed human DRIP205. Real Time PCR mRNA Quantification—Total RNA from HepG2 cells was extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. cDNA specific for each gene was subsequently synthesized using the enhanced avian reverse transcriptase (Sigma) and random primer hexamers (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's instructions. cDNAs were amplified using the SYBR green quantitative PCR kit (Sigma) on a LightCycler (Roche Applied Science). Reactions were carried out in a 20-μl reaction containing a 500 nm concentration of each primer and the SYBR Green Taq ReadyMix for quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (Sigma) as recommended by the manufacturer with the following conditions: 95 °C for 2 min followed by 42 cycles of 5 s at 95 °C, 5 s at 55 °C, and 10 s at 72 °C. DRIP205, DRIP150, and kininogen mRNA levels were normalized to 28 S expression. All reverse transcriptase-PCR products were analyzed in a post-amplification fusion curve to ensure that a single amplicon was obtained. The primers used were as follows: kininogen, 5′-GGCTGTGTGCATCCTATATCAACGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CGGTATCACCATTCCAAAGGGAC-3′ (antisense); DRIP205, 5′-AAACCATTCAAGCCGAC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CGTTCCCTGTGATTTGC-3″ (antisense) (259 bp); and DRIP150, 5′-TCCATACCTACCATCCTCAC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGACTAAGAGCTACTCTGC-3′ (antisense) (379 bp). Primers used to amplify 28 S have been described elsewhere (47Bonazzi A. Mastyugin V. Mieyal P.A. Dunn M.W. Laniado-Schwartman M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2837-2844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The Nuclear Receptor Coactivator DRIP205 Binds FXR in Response to Bile Acids—To determine whether DRIP205 interacts with FXR in response to ligand, pull-down assays were performed using in vitro translated full-length FXR and a bacterially expressed fragment of DRIP205 (aa 527–774, containing the two described LXXLL motifs or NR boxes (46Rachez C. Gamble M. Chang C.-P.B. Atkins G.B. Lazar M.A. Freedman L.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2718-2726Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar)) as a GST fusion protein (GST-DRIP205) or GST alone. The ability of SRC-1 (aa 613–773), which has been previously reported to bind FXR in a bile acid-inducible manner (6Makishima M. Okamoto A.Y. Repa J.J. Tu H. Learned R.M. Luk A. Hull M.V. Lustig K.D.

Metab. 2000; 71: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), was also examined. In the presence of increasing concentrations of CDCA, DRIP205 bound FXR in a dose-dependent manner to a similar extent as SRC-1 (Fig. 1A). In contrast, GST alone did not interact with FXR even at the highest concentration of CDCA tested. Thus, like the p160 coactivators, DRIP205 is recruited to FXR in a ligand-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2068600128,"Recycling of endocytosed G-protein-coupled receptors involves a series of molecular events through early and recycling endosomes. The purpose of this work was to study the role of neuron-enriched endosomal protein of 21 kDa (NEEP21) in the recycling process of neurotensin receptors-1 and -2. Here we showed that suppression of NEEP21 expression does not modify the internalization rate of both receptors but strongly inhibited the recycling of the neurotensin receptor-2. In contrast, overexpression of NEEP21 changes the behavior of the neurotensin receptor-1 from a non-recycling to a recycling state. Recycling of the neurotensin receptor-2 involves both the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and the recycling endosome pathways, whereas recycling of the neurotensin receptor-1 induced by overexpression of NEEP21 only occurs by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent pathway. Taken together, these results confirm the essential role of NEEP21 in the recycling mechanism and show that this protein acts at the level of early endosomes to promote sorting of receptors toward a recycling pathway.

G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; EE, early endosome; RE, recycling endosome; Tf, transferrin; SNARE, soluble NSF attachment protein receptors; NT, neurotensin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; AS, antisense. activated by their agonists are sequestrated into intracellular compartments as ligand-receptor complexes. Complexes are then routed to early endosomes in which vesicular acidification dissociates the ligand from the receptor. At the level of early endosomes (EEs), receptors and/or ligands are sorted either to the degradation or to the recycling pathways (1von Zastrow M. Life Sci. 2003; 74: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 2Trejo J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 307: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Molecular events leading to the choice of the sorting pathway are still unknown despite their importance in the regulation of cellular responses to various stimuli. The degradation pathway always uses the late endosome network to deliver receptors into lysosomes. By contrast, receptor recycling to the plasma membrane can be achieved either directly from early endosomes or through tubular vesicular recycling endosomes (REs) (3Gruenberg J. Maxfield F.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 552-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). These two recycling pathways can be distinguished by their recycling rate, by their sensitivity to different drugs, and by the involvement of various small Rab GTPases. Each Rab GTPase interferes with a particular trafficking step (4Sonnichsen B. De Renzis S. Nielsen E. Rietdorf J. Zerial M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 901-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar) and can be used as a specific endosomal marker. Recently, neuron-enriched endosomal protein of 21 kDa (NEEP21) has been shown to be involved in receptor recycling. NEEP21 is strongly expressed during neuronal maturation (5Sutcliffe J.G. Milner R.J. Shinnick T.M. Bloom F.E. Cell. 1983; 33: 671-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 6Steiner P. Floyd Sarria J.C. Glauser L. Magnin S. Catsicas S. Hirling H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1197-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and is able to form a complex with the SNARE protein syntaxin 13 (6Steiner P. Floyd Sarria J.C. Glauser L. Magnin S. Catsicas S. Hirling H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1197-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), which is bound to EE and RE membranes. Syntaxin 13 plays an essential role in the fusion of EE vesicles (7McBride H.M. Rybin V. Murphy C. Giner A. Teasdale R. Zerial M. Cell. 1999; 98: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) as well as in transferrin (Tf) receptor recycling (8Prekeris R. Klumperman J. Chen Y.A. Scheller R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 957-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), because antibodies blocking syntaxin 13 inhibited both events. Syntaxin 13, the Rab5 effector protein EEA1, and Rabaptin-5 are part of the multiprotein complex that is necessary for membrane fusion between various vesicles (7McBride H.M. Rybin V. Murphy C. Giner A. Teasdale R. Zerial M. Cell. 1999; 98: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). NEEP21, as well as syntaxin 13, is localized in the membrane receptor recycling structures and particularly in the Rab4-containing vesicles (6Steiner P. Floyd Sarria J.C. Glauser L. Magnin S. Catsicas S. Hirling H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1197-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of NEEP21 expression leads to an important delay of recycling for both the Tf and AMPA receptors (6Steiner P. Floyd Sarria J.C. Glauser L. Magnin S. Catsicas S. Hirling H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1197-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Although NEEP21 has been shown to be crucial in the recycling of transferrin and glutamate receptors nothing is known about its role on the GPCR internalization/recycling processes. In the present study, we used the two receptors of the neuropeptide neurotensin (NT) belonging to the GPCR family, namely the NTSR1 and NTSR2. These two receptors can be distinguished by their different affinities for NT. Moreover, although both receptors are internalized upon NT activation, only the NTSR2 is able to recycle back to the plasma membrane (9Botto J.M. Chabry J. Sarret P. Vincent J.P. Mazella J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 585-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 10Martin S. Vincent J.P. Mazella J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 165-173PubMed Google Scholar), with the NTSR1 being targeted to lysosomes (11Vandenbulcke F. Nouel D. Vincent J.P. Mazella J. Beaudet A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2963-2975Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (for review see Ref. 12Vincent J.P. Mazella J. Kitabgi P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 302-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). NTSR1 and NTSR2 constitute good models to measure the effects of variation of NEEP21 expression on the different intracellular behaviors of receptors following ligand-induced sequestration. We showed here that overexpression of NEEP21 had no influence on the internalization rates of both receptors but differentially regulated their recycling properties. Indeed, NEEP21 overexpression not only slightly accelerated NTSR2 recycling but also transformed the non-recycling NTSR1 into a recycling receptor. We also demonstrated that down-regulation of NEEP21 strongly attenuated NTSR2 recycling. Finally, we showed that endogenous NEEP21-dependent NTSR2 recycling and NEEP21-forced NTSR1 recycling take different intracellular pathways. Materials—Neurotensin was purchased from Peninsula Laboratories. [125I-Tyr3]NT was prepared and purified as described previously (13Sadoul J.L. Mazella J. Amar S. Kitabgi P. Vincent J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commum. 1984; 120: 812-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The pcDNA3 expression vector was from Invitrogen. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was from Invitrogen, gentamycin, 1–10-phenanthroline, brefeldin A, Mowiol, and paraformaldehyde were from Sigma France, and fetal calf serum was from Roche Diagnostics. Lysotracker DS Red was from Molecular Probes. The polyclonal antibody directed against NEEP21 and monoclonal anti-EE antibody have been characterized previously (6Steiner P. Floyd Sarria J.C.

Anti-NTR1, mouse monoclonal anti-actin, and the rabbit polyclonal anti-green fluorescent protein (GFP) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. NTR Expression—Transient transfections were performed with 1–5 μg of recombinant pcDNA3-NEEP21-EE, pcDNA3-GFP-antisense-NEEP21 (6Steiner P. Floyd Sarria J.C. Glauser L. Magnin S. Catsicas S. Hirling H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1197-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) or pcDNA3-NTR1, and pcDNA3-NTR2 expression vector by the DEAE-dextran precipitation method (15Cullen B.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 684-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Binding, internalization and recycling assays were performed on cells plated in 12-mm cell culture dishes ∼60 h after transfection as described previously (16Chabry J. Botto J.-M. Nouel D. Beaudet A. Vincent J.-P. Mazella J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2439-2442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Membranes from non-transfected COS-7 cells were totally devoid of specific [125I-Tyr3]NT binding. Binding Studies—Binding experiments were carried out on freshly prepared cell membrane homogenates as described previously (15Cullen B.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 684-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Cell membranes (10–50 μg of protein) were incubated in 250 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (binding buffer) with 0.4 nm [125I-Tyr3]NT (2000 Ci/mmol) and various concentrations of unlabeled NT. After 20 min at 25 °C, incubation media were filtered through cellulose acetate filters (Sartorius). Filters were rinsed twice with 3 ml of ice-cold binding buffer and counted in a Packard γ-counter (counting efficiency, 80%). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm unlabeled NT and represented less than 5% of the total binding. Internalization and Recycling Studies on Whole Transfected Cells, Internalization Experiments—Internalization experiments were performed on cells plated in 12-mm well culture dishes. Briefly, cells were preincubated at 37 °C in an Earle's buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 3.6 mm MgCl2) for 30 min. Cells were then incubated with 0.1–0.3 nm [125I-Tyr3]NT for various times and washed twice with 0.5 ml of equilibration buffer (neutral wash) or with 0.5 ml of the same buffer (pH 4) containing 0.5 m NaCl for 3 min to remove non-sequestrated radioactivity (acid-NaCl wash). Cells were harvested with 1 ml of 0.1 n NaOH and counted in a γ-counter. Non-specific internalization was determined in the presence of 1 μm unlabeled NT. Recycling Experiments—Cells were first preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the absence of drug or with 1 μm wortmannin or 10 μg/ml brefeldin A in the Earle's buffer. Then the cells were incubated in the presence or in the absence of drug with 100 nm unlabeled NT for 15 min at 37 °C to induce internalization. The peptide remaining on the cell surface was removed by a series of ice-cold washes, three with the Earle's buffer, two with 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm acetic acid, and three with the Earle's buffer. Fresh Earle's buffer was added, and cells were incubated at 37 °C for various times in the presence or in the absence of drugs. The amount of cell-surface receptor was then measured in binding assays carried out with 0.5–2 nm [125I-Tyr3]NT for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of the internalization blocker PheAsO. The nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm unlabeled NT. There was no significant increase in cell surface binding sites for the NTR1 or the NTR2 after 30 min, indicating that de novo synthesis was negligible during the time course of the experiment. The total number of NTR1 binding sites at the cell surface, upon persistent NT stimulation, was measured as described for the human β1-adrenergic receptor down-regulation (17Liang W. Austin S. Hoang Q. Fishman P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39773-39781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells transfected with NTR1 alone, with NTR1 plus NEEP21, or with NTR1 plus antisense (AS)-NEEP21 were plated in 24-well plates and exposed at 37 °C to 100 nm NT for increasing times up to 24 h. The plates were rapidly washed several times with the Earle's buffer and incubated with 0.5–2 nm [125I-Tyr3]NT for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of the internalization blocker PheAsO. Radioactivity remaining that was associated with cells was counted as described above. Western Blot Experiments—Proteins from cells transfected with various constructs were denatured by boiling at 95 °C for 3 min using 2× or 6× Laemmli sample buffer, resolved using 10% acrylamide gels, and subsequently electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked and incubated with primary antibody either overnight at 4 °C or for 2–4 h at room temperature. The bound antibody was visualized using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse followed by chemiluminescence reagents. Confocal Microscopy Experiments—Cells were transfected with plasmids coding either for NTR1 alone or for NTR1 and NEEP21 and grown on 12-mm coverslips. After preincubation for 10 min at 37 °C in Earle's buffer, cells were incubated with 100 nm NT at 37 °C for 40 min in the presence of 500 nm Lysotracker red DND-99. After a rapid washing step, cells were fixed with 4.5% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 20 min at room temperature, washed twice in PBS, then incubated with 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS for 10 min to quench excess free aldehyde groups. Fixed cells were permeabilized by incubation in PBS containing 10% horse serum and 0.05% Triton X-100 for 20 min at room temperature, then incubated with a 1:250 dilution of a rabbit polyclonal anti-NTR1 antibody in PBS buffer containing 5% horse serum and 0.05% Triton X-100 for 1 h. Cells were rinsed three times in PBS buffer and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody diluted 1:600 in PBS containing 5% horse serum and 0.05% Triton X-100 for 45 min. After two washes with PBS and one wash with water, coverslips were mounted on glass slides with Mowiol for confocal microscopy examination. Labeled cells were visualized under a Bio-Rad laser scanning confocal microscope (MCR 1024) equipped with a DM-IRBE inverted microscope and an argon-krypton laser. Samples were scanned under both 488 and 647 nm wavelength excitation. Images were acquired as single transcellular optical sections by the accumulation of photons. The degree of NTR1 localized into the lysosomal compartment was calculated from seven cells for each condition using the Lasersharp 3.2 processing software. The values obtained corresponded to the proportion of NTR1-positive vesicles costained with the lysosomal marker Lysotracker. NEEP21 Is Expressed in COS-7 Cells—We first assessed the endogenous expression of NEEP21 in COS-7 cells. Western blot analysis of cell extracts using the anti-NEEP21 antibody reveals a detectable but weak expression of a protein of 21 kDa (Fig. 1A). This protein corresponds to NEEP21, because cell extracts from COS-7 cells transfected with the pcDNA3-antisense-NEEP21 plasmid (AS-NEEP21) showed no expression (Fig. 1A). Then we tested the expression of exogenous NEEP21 and AS-NEEP21 following transient transfection into COS-7 cells. As shown in Fig. 1B, homogenates from cells transfected with pcDNA3-NEEP21-EE vector express a single protein of 21 kDa revealed by the monoclonal anti-EE antibodies. Western blot analysis using anti-GFP antibodies detected a protein band of 29 kDa only in homogenates from cells transfected with the GFP-AS-NEEP21 expression vector (Fig. 1C). Therefore, we could use these different experimental conditions to measure the influence of NEEP21 suppression or overexpression on trafficking of NTRs. Effect of the Overexpression of NEEP21 on NTR1 and NTR2 Binding Properties—We measured the influence of cotransfection of plasmids coding for NEEP21-EE with either the NTR1 or the NTR2 on the NT binding properties. Saturation experiments carried out on membrane preparation from COS-7 cells transfected with NTR1 alone or with NTR1 and NEEP21 show identical maximal binding capacity (Bmax) and a slightly modified Kd value (from 0.3 to 0.5 nm) when NEEP21 is overexpressed (Table I). Similarly, overexpression of NEEP21 does not modify the Bmax of NTR2 but changes its Kd value for NT from 3.5 to 4.5 nm (Table I).Table IBinding parameters of NTR1 and NTR2 in the absence or in the presence of overexpression of NEEP21NTR1NTR1 + NEEP21NTR2NTR2 + NEEP21Kd (nm)0.3 ± 0.170.5 ± 0.23.5 ± 0.14.5 ± 0.3Bmax (fmol/mg)1020 ± 45993 ± 6583 ± 1790 ± 11 Open table in a new tab Effect of the Variation of NEEP21 Expression on NTR1 and NTR2 Internalization/Recycling Properties—The effect of overexpression or suppression of NEEP21 on the ability of NTR1 and NTR2 to internalize NT was studied using the cotransfection of plasmids expressing NT receptors and NEEP21, or GFP-AS-NEEP21. Neither suppression nor overexpression of NEEP21 had any effect on the internalization properties of both receptors (Fig. 2, A and B), confirming previous results analyzing glutamate receptor internalization (6Steiner P. Floyd Sarria J.C. Glauser L. Magnin S. Catsicas S. Hirling H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1197-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The internalization rates were comparable with control levels, with about 60% for the NTR1 and 35–40% for the NTR2. Using identical experimental conditions, we observed that although overexpression of NEEP21 does not modify the recycling rate of the NTR2, suppression of NEEP21 expression prevented NTR2 recycling to the cell surface (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, overexpression of NEEP21 completely changes the intracellular behavior of the NTR1, which became able to recycle after NT-induced sequestration (Fig. 3A). Overexpression of NEEP21 Changes the Cellular Location of the Sequestered NTR1—The ability of the NTR1 to recycle when NEEP21 is overexpressed allowed us to study its cellular location after NT-induced internalization. We demonstrated previously by confocal microscopy that after 40 min of incubation at 37 °C with NT, the internalized NTR1 was recovered in a Lamp1-positive lysosomal compartment (11Vandenbulcke F. Nouel D. Vincent J.P. Mazella J. Beaudet A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2963-2975Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Confocal imaging experiments were again carried out in the present work to locate the NTR1 after NT-induced internalization under normal conditions (i.e. when NTR1 is expressed alone) and under the influence of NEEP21 (i.e. when NTR1 is cotransfected with NEEP21). As observed in Fig. 4, in the absence of an excess of NEEP21, part of the NTR1 immunoreactivity is detected in Lysotracker-positive lysosomes (Fig. 4, A–F). When NEEP21 is overexpressed, although the NTR1 is detected in punctuate intracellular compartments, no colocalization is observed with the Lysotracker (Fig. 4, G–L) indicating that in this case NTR1 is not routed to lysosomes. This qualitative inspection was also verified by image analysis. The degree of localization of NTR1 into lysosomes was quantified. In control cells 69 ± 5% (n = 7) of pixels in NTR1-positive vesicles were labeled with Lysotracker, this colocalization dropped to 8.4 ± 1.5% (n = 7) following overexpression of NEEP21. We also examined the effect of NEEP21 overexpression or NEEP21 suppression on NTR1 and NTR2 down-regulation during prolonged incubation of cells with 100 nm NT. In control cells, persistent NT stimulation reduced the level of NTR1 on the cell surface by 60–70% between 1 and 3 h, followed by a reappearance after 24 h to ∼60% of initial values (Fig. 5, closed circles). Overexpressing NEEP21 cells showed the same behavior as control cells (Fig. 5, closed squares). By contrast, the partial recovery of surface NTR1 was completely inhibited upon suppression of NEEP21 (Fig. 5, open squares). When identical experiments were carried out for NTR2, an increase in the amount of cell surface receptors was observed in control cells (not shown) suggesting an up-regulation of the receptor under persistent exposure to NT. For this reason, we were unable to examine the effect of NEEP21 on down-regulation. Cellular Pathways of NTR2 and NEEP21-induced NTR1 Recycling—To determine the pathways of NTR2 and NEEP21-induced NTR1 recycling, we used either wortmannin to block receptor recycling from early endosomes or brefeldin A to inhibit recycling through tubular vesicular REs. Fig. 6A clearly shows that the NEEP21-induced NTR1 recycling is altered by brefeldin A but not by wortmannin. By contrast, both drugs inhibit the recycling of NTR2 (Fig. 6B). These results indicate that at least part of NTR2 does not take the same recycling pathway as that of the NEEP21-induced NTR1 recycling. Recently, Steiner et al. (6Steiner P. Floyd Sarria J.C. Glauser L. Magnin S. Catsicas S. Hirling H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1197-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) reported that NEEP21, also called 1A75/p21 (5Sutcliffe J.G. Milner R.J. Shinnick T.M. Bloom F.E. Cell. 1983; 33: 671-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), is necessary for correct recycling of the Tf and AMPA receptors (6Steiner P. Floyd Sarria J.C. Glauser L. Magnin S. Catsicas S. Hirling H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1197-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, nothing is known about its implication in the recycling processes of GPCRs internalized after activation by their ligands. In the present work, by using the two identified NT receptors coupled to G-proteins as a model of recycling and non-recycling receptors, we established a crucial role for NEEP21 in the modulation of the intracellular behavior of both receptors. NEEP21, which interacts with syntaxin 13, has been proposed to localize mainly to Rab-4-positive domains on EE involved in transport to RE or to the plasma membrane (6Steiner P. Floyd Sarria J.C. Glauser L. Magnin S. Catsicas S. Hirling H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1197-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The endosomal NEEP21 is strongly expressed in neurons, and its highest level of expression correlates with that of AMPA receptors during postnatal development (6Steiner P. Floyd Sarria J.C. Glauser L. Magnin S. Catsicas S. Hirling H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1197-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 18Zhu J.J. Esteban J.A. Hayashi Y. Malinow R. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1098-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), suggesting a role of NEEP21 during synaptogenesis. However, as shown in this study, NEEP21 is also expressed in COS-7 cells, and although its expression level is relatively low (Fig. 1), the amount of protein present in COS-7 cells appears sufficient to fulfill a functional role, because variation of NEEP21 expression strongly influences GPCRs trafficking. Indeed, although neither overexpression nor down-regulation of NEEP21 affects the internalization process of NTR1 and NTR2, its down-regulation strongly delays NTR2 recycling, whereas its overexpression allows the non-recycling NTR1 to return to the plasma membrane. The implication of NEEP21 on GPCR trafficking is in line with its role previously demonstrated on the modulation of the Tf receptor and AMPA receptor recycling. The difference is that overexpression of NEEP21 accelerates Tf internalization (6Steiner P. Floyd Sarria J.C. Glauser L. Magnin S. Catsicas S. Hirling H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1197-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) but not the sequestration of both NTR1 and NTR2 (shown in this work). Interestingly, the intracellular pathways taken by the natural NTR2 recycling or the NEEP21-induced NTR1 are clearly distinct. Indeed, the cellular process that mediates the recycling of the NTR2 uses both the rapid phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (wortmannin-sensitive) and the juxtanuclear (brefeldin A-sensitive) recycling compartments. As previously described for the Tf receptor (19van Dam E.M. ten Broeke T. Jansen K. Spijkers P. Stoorvogel W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48876-48883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), the first recycling route bypasses RE and involves a direct transfer from EE to the plasma membrane. The second pathway involves the passage through RE by an unknown mechanism. These two pathways could contribute to the rapid recycling observed for the NTR2 in several studies (9Botto J.M. Chabry J. Sarret P. Vincent J.P. Mazella J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 585-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 10Martin S. Vincent J.P. Mazella J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 165-173PubMed Google Scholar). The recycling process of the NTR2 resembles that observed for the angiotensin receptor-1 in that it takes both phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-sensitive and -in-sensitive pathways (20Hunyadi L. Baukal A.J. Gaborik Z. Olivares-Reyes J.A. Bor M. Szaszak M. Lodge R. Catt K.J. Balla T. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1211-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Because the NTR2 is poorly expressed to the plasma membrane (9Botto J.M. Chabry J. Sarret P. Vincent J.P. Mazella J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 585-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), this process could be of importance to maintain its functionality. By contrast, with the NTR1 being strongly expressed at the cell surface, its recycling would not be crucial to preserve its activity. Indeed, the absence of recycling for the NT-induced internalized NTR1 has been clearly established (9Botto J.M. Chabry J. Sarret P. Vincent J.P. Mazella J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 585-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 11Vandenbulcke F. Nouel D. Vincent J.P. Mazella J. Beaudet A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2963-2975Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in the presence of an excess of NEEP21, the NTR1 becomes able to recycle as rapidly as the NTR2. Two mechanisms could explain this behavior. The first possible mechanism is that an excess of NEEP21 could lead to an inhibition of transfer of the receptor from EE to late endosome or from late endosome to lysosomes, because NTR1 is no longer localized in lysosomes in these conditions (Fig. 4). Further characterization of the cellular localization of internalized NTR1 when NEEP21 is overexpressed remains to be performed. The second hypothesis could be that NEEP21 is capable of driving GPCRs to the recycling pathway and that its overexpression can force these receptors to take this route. It will be of interest to analyze whether NEEP21 can associate with GPCR. However, the fact that the NEEP21-induced recycling of the NTR1 is sensitive only to brefeldin A suggests that NEEP21 can favor this recycling pathway, thus preventing the sorting of the receptor by lysosomes. According to this scheme, the function of NEEP21 would be well correlated with its localization in Rab-4-positive vesicles (6Steiner P. Floyd Sarria J.C. Glauser L. Magnin S. Catsicas S. Hirling H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1197-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and must be upstream to the molecular events responsible for the targeting of receptors to the degradation process. From these results, we could predict an effect of over/underexpression of NEEP21 on the down-regulation of NT receptors. Unfortunately, only NTR1 levels are decreased on the cell surface after persistent stimulation with NT. In fact, the NTR2 is slightly up-regulated upon prolonged stimulation. The recovery of part of the NTR1 binding sites after 24 h of NT treatment has been observed already (21Hermans E. Vanisberg M.-A. Geurts M. Maloteaux J.M. Neurochem Int. 1997; 21: 291-299Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, overexpression of NEEP21 alters neither the initial down-regulation nor the second phase recovery of NTR1, only the blocking of NEEP21 expression is able to inhibit the receptor recovery. Overexpression of NEEP21 can modify NTR1 trafficking from a non-recycling to a recycling behavior but does not change the overall amount of NTR1 upon prolonged exposure to NT. This might be explained by an incomplete rerouting of NTR1 from the degradation pathway to the recycling pathway leading to an overall decrease in the receptor level. An alternative explanation could be that the internalization rate in continuous presence of a saturating NT concentration is so high that efficient sorting of NTR1 to the recycling pathway by NEEP21 overexpression cannot increase receptor surface levels above the 60% level observed in control cells. In any case, NEEP21 apparently plays a role in the long term recovery of the receptor, because this process is inhibited by blocking its expression. The fact that underexpression of NEEP21 strongly reduced NTR1 levels during prolonged stimulation might suggest that de novo synthesized receptors might also be routed by a NEEP21-dependent pathway. In conclusion, NEEP21 is an endosomal protein that can act on the recycling mechanism of a wide range of membrane proteins including type I and channel receptors as well as GPCRs. The action of this protein occurs essentially at the level of the early endosomal pathway both in neuronal and non-neuronal cells. We thank Anne Cantereau (Poitiers) for help in confocal microscopy."

The virus encodes a homolog of eukaryotic ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) that was previously demonstrated to be capable of decarboxylating l-ornithine. However, the active site of this enzyme contains a key amino acid substitution (Glu for Asp) of a residue that interacts with the δ-amino group of ornithine analogs in the x-ray structures of ODC. To determine whether this active-site change affects substrate specificity, kinetic analysis of the PBCV-1 decarboxylase (PBCV-1 DC) on three basic amino acids was undertaken. The kcat/Km for l-arginine is 550-fold higher than for either l-ornithine or l-lysine, which were decarboxylated with similar efficiency. In addition, α-difluoromethylarginine was a more potent inhibitor of the enzyme than α-difluoromethylornithine. Mass spectrometric analysis demonstrated that inactivation was consistent with the formation of a covalent adduct at Cys347. These data demonstrate that PBCV-1 DC should be reclassified as an arginine decarboxylase. The eukaryotic ODCs, as well as PBCV-1 DC, are only distantly related to the bacterial and plant arginine decarboxylases from their common β/α-fold class; thus, the finding that PBCV-1 DC prefers l-arginine to l-ornithine was unexpected based on evolutionary analysis. Mutational analysis was carried out to determine whether the Asp-to-Glu substitution at position 296 (position 332 in Trypanosoma brucei ODC) conferred the change in substrate specificity. This residue was found to be an important determinant of substrate binding for both l-arginine and l-ornithine, but it is not sufficient to encode the change in substrate preference.

The N-terminal domain forms a β/α-barrel, and the C-terminal domain is folded into a β-barrel structure.

However, a bacterial enzyme from this fold type has been described that has activity on both lysine and ornithine (Lys/Orn decarboxylase (DC)) and that shares extensive sequence similarity (∼35%) with eukaryotic ODCs (33Takatsuka Y. Yamaguchi Y. Ono M. Kamio Y. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6732-6741Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The decarboxylase identified in chlorella virus (PBCV-1 DC) contains nearly 40% sequence identity to the family of eukaryotic ODCs (3Morehead T.A. Guron J.R. Adams B. Nicerson K.W. Fitzgerald L.A. Van Etten J.L. Virology. 2002; 301: 165-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Phylogenetic analysis indicates that PBCV-1 DC branches with the eukaryotic ODCs and with the bacterial Lys/OrnDCs (Fig. 2). Consistent with this grouping, the recombinant PBCV-1 enzyme was characterized and found to have activity on l-ornithine as a substrate. However, it was inhibited more strongly by α-difluoromethylarginine (DFMA) than by α-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), suggesting that it might have unusual substrate specificity. Alignment of the primary amino acid sequence of this enzyme with the x-ray structures for mammalian and trypanosome ODCs reveals a key amino acid substitution in the substrate-binding pocket that is predicted to alter the substrate specificity (Fig. 1). The structures of T. brucei ODC (TbODC) in complex with several substrate and product analogs demonstrate that the δ-nitrogen of l-ornithine forms salt bridge interactions with Asp361 from the C-terminal domain and with Asp332 from the N-terminal domain across the subunit boundary (Fig. 1A) (24Grishin N.V.

To investigate the substrate preference of PBCV-1 DC, we performed steady-state kinetic analysis on a range of basic amino acids. We show here that, although PBCV-1 DC contains detectable activity with l-ornithine, its activity with l-arginine is significantly higher; therefore, this enzyme should be reclassified as an ADC. The fact that it is closer in amino acid sequence to the enzymes with specificity for l-ornithine and l-lysine than to the ADCs from bacteria and plants suggests that PBCV-1 DC represents a new activity within the clade of the ornithine-specific enzymes.

Cladistics. 1989; 5: 164-166Google Scholar) from the alignment of the displayed sequences constructed with the PCMA program (35Pei J. Sadreyev R. Grishin N.V. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 427-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). PSI-BLAST was used to identify eukaryotic ODC homologs in the GenBank™ Data Bank (Version 2.2.8) and to generate a local alignment. A total of 53 eukaryotic sequences that had published sequence data were included. (Hypothetical proteins were excluded from the analysis.) Protein Expression and Purification—PBCV-1 DC was produced in Escherichia coli from the expression plasmid for PBCV-1 DC, termed pODCTM9, which was described previously (3Morehead T.A. Guron J.R. Adams B. Nicerson K.W. Fitzgerald L.A. Van Etten J.L. Virology. 2002; 301: 165-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This vector directs the expression of N-terminally His-tagged PBCV-1 DC from a pET-15b plasmid containing the cDNA corresponding to open reading frame A207R present in the PBCV-1 genome. Two sources of PBCV-1 were used in these studies. 1) A protein with the wild-type sequence was used in the 14CO2 release assay (see Table I) and for DFMO and DFMA inactivation studies (see Fig. 4, A and B); and 2) a protein containing a Thr-to-Ala substitution at position 142 was used for the spectrophotometric analysis and as the background for the E296D mutant (see Figs. 3 and 5 and Table II). This change was generated during cloning, but has no effect on the activity or substrate specificity of the enzyme. PBCV-1 DC, PBCV-1 DC E296D, TbODC, and TbODC D332E were expressed and purified as described previously for TbODC using Ni2+-agarose column chromatography and Sephadex 200 (36Osterman A.L.

Radiolabel Release-based Enzymatic Assays—ODC and ADC activities were determined by measuring the release of 14CO2 from the enzymatic decarboxylation of l-[1-14C]ornithine or l-[U-14C]arginine (37Pegg A.E. McGill S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 568: 416-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The 14CO2 released was trapped in a center well containing Hyamine hydroxide and counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry as described previously (37Pegg A.E. McGill S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 568: 416-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Kinetic constants were measured under two conditions using either 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.2) at 37 °C or 50 mm CAPSO (pH 9) at 42 °C. All reaction mixtures contained 0.04 mm PLP and 2.5 mm dithiothreitol. The concentration of l-ornithine was varied from 5 to 250 mm and that of l-arginine from 0.05 to 5 mm. Protein was determined by the Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The molar ratios of CO2 formed from the labeled substrate were confirmed to be equivalent to the product by analyzing the products by reverse-phase HPLC using a standard system for separation of polyamines (38Pegg A.E. Wechter R. Poulin R. Woster P.M. Coward J.K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8446-8453Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) with a Canberra Packard A140 Radiomatic detector as described previously (39Coleman C.S. Hu G. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 849-855Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). l-[2,3-3H]Ornithine was used to detect the formation of putrescine, and l-[U-14C]arginine was used to detect the formation of agmatine. Authentic [U-14C]agmatine and [2,3-3H]putrescine were used as markers. Spectroscopy-based Enzymatic Assays—The steady-state kinetics of the decarboxylation of l-ornithine (1–25 mm), l-arginine (0.5-l6 mm), or l-lysine (1–50 mm) by PBCV-1 DC, TbODC, PBCV-1 DC E296D, or TbODC D332E were measured spectrophotometrically at 37 °C using a Sigma diagnostics carbon dioxide detection kit as described previously (36Osterman A.L. Grishin N.V. Kinch L.N. Phillips M.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13662-13667Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Assays were conducted with 100 μm PLP. The Sigma kit couples decarboxylation of substrate to the oxidation of NADH (λmax = 340 nm) using phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and malate dehydrogenase. HPLC Analysis of Reaction Products—The products of an enzymatic reaction with l-arginine and wild-type PBCV-1 DC and TbODC D332E were analyzed by HPLC using an AccQ-Tag kit (Waters) in 5% sodium tetraborate and labeling reagent (6-aminoquinolyl-n-hydroxysuccinimidyl in acetonitrile) as described previously (24Grishin N.V. Osterman A.L. Brooks H.B. Phillips M.A. Goldsmith E.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15174-15184Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). PBCV-1 DC or TbODC D332E was incubated with l-arginine (20 mm for wild-type PBCV-1 DC and 170 mm for the TbODC mutant) in 15 mm KPO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.15 mm PLP at 37 °C for 2.5, 5.0, and 10.0 min. Enzyme concentrations of 475 and 950 nm for PBCV-1 DC and 100 and 200 μm for TbODC D332E were used in the reactions. Enzymatic reactions were terminated by the addition of trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 6%. Labeled samples (5 μl) were injected onto an AccQ-Tag column using the buffers and gradient described previously (24Grishin N.V. Osterman A.L. Brooks H.B. Phillips M.A. Goldsmith E.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15174-15184Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The column was calibrated with known amounts of the following derivatized reagents: agmatine (retention time = 27.8 min), cadaverine (40.1 min), l-ornithine (34.8 min), putrescine (44.5 min), and l-arginine (21.1 min). Inactivation of PBCV-1 DC with DFMO or DFMA—The His-tagged PBCV-1 DC protein in 50 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 8), 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, 0.04 mm PLP, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (3Morehead T.A. Guron J.R. Adams B. Nicerson K.W. Fitzgerald L.A. Van Etten J.L. Virology. 2002; 301: 165-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) was dialyzed to remove dithiothreitol and imidazole before passing over a Talon metal affinity column (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) to remove bovine serum albumin. After elution and further dialysis, an aliquot of PBCV-1 DC protein (104 μg in 50 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 8), 0.04 mm PLP, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) was incubated in the absence or presence of 10 mm DFMO or 1 mm DFMA for 2 h at 37 °C in a total volume of 250 μl. Aliquots (5 μl) of each reaction were removed at the times indicated and diluted accordingly to monitor inactivation of the protein. Preparation of Samples of PBCV-1 DC Protein for MALDI-TOF Analysis—MALDI analyses were performed at the Mass Spectrometry/Proteomics Core Facility of the Pennsylvania State College of Medicine. Reactions containing 4.2 μg (∼100 nmol) of untreated or DFMO- or DFMA-inactivated PBCV-1 DC protein in a total volume of 100 μl were subjected to tryptic or endoproteinase Glu-C digestion using a protease/protein ratio over the range 1:84 to 1:21 (w/w) as indicated. Samples were digested with modified trypsin in 50 mm NH4HCO3 (pH 8) containing 10% (v/v) acetonitrile for 16 h, stopped by the addition of 4 μl of glacial acetic acid, and stored frozen until analyzed by MALDI-TOF. Samples were digested with Glu-C in 25 mm NH4HCO3 (pH 7.8) containing 10% (v/v) acetonitrile for 2–16 h at 25 °C, stopped by the addition of glacial acetic acid, and stored frozen until analysis by MALDI-TOF using an Applied Biosystems 4700 Proteomics Analyzer. Digested samples were evaporated and resuspended three times in 200 μl of deionized water to remove volatile digestion buffers (NH4HCO3), which can interfere with subsequent binding to strong cation exchange resins. The final resuspension was evaporated to ∼10 μl, and then 0.11 volume of 1.0% trifluoroacetic acid was added to bring the final trifluoroacetic acid concentration to 0.1%. Using a BioHit Multipipettor, ZipTip SCX tips were equilibrated with 3 × 10 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and then the sample aliquots were pipetted up and down across the resin 15 times to bind and concentrate peptides. The bound peptides were washed with 5 × 10 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid to remove salts, followed by elution of the bound peptides by carefully pipetting 2 μl of freshly prepared 5% NH4OH and 30% MeOH up and down four to five times. The droplet containing the eluted peptides was deposited onto a polished stainless steel MALDI target plate (Applied Biosystems) and allowed to dry. After drying, each spot was overlaid with 0.6 μl of freshly prepared matrix (5 mg/ml recrystallized α-cyanohydroxycinnamic acid, 2 mg/ml NH4H2PO4, 50% acetonitrile, and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). Analysis of PBCV-1 DC Substrate Preference and Activity— Decarboxylation of l-ornithine or l-arginine by PBCV-1 DC was measured by following 14CO2 release from l-[1-14C]ornithine or l-[U-14C]arginine (Table I). In studies carried out in Tris-HCl (pH 8.2) at 37 °C, the protein was highly active on l-arginine, with a Km of 0.45 mm and a kcat of 15 s-1. It also had detectable activity on l-ornithine; however, although the kcat was only slightly lower, the Km was ∼400 times higher (Km = 180 mm) (Table I), giving an overall difference in substrate preference of 550-fold for kcat/Km. These results contrast with a previous report of a Km of 0.78 mm for l-ornithine (3Morehead T.A. Guron J.R. Adams B. Nicerson K.W. Fitzgerald L.A. Van Etten J.L. Virology. 2002; 301: 165-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The previously reported assays were conducted in CAPSO (pH 9) at 42 °C. The assays were therefore repeated using these conditions, and the ability to decarboxylate l-ornithine was slightly improved (Km = 46 mm) (Table I). However, even under these conditions, the protein still preferred l-arginine as a substrate, with a Km 2 orders of magnitude lower than for l-ornithine. The products of the reaction were identified by HPLC (38Pegg A.E. Wechter R. Poulin R. Woster P.M. Coward J.K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8446-8453Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 39Coleman C.S. Hu G. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 849-855Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) after the protein had acted upon either l-[U-14C]arginine or l-[2,3-3H]ornithine. As expected, [14C]agmatine was found in stoichiometric amounts with 14CO2 when l-[U-14C]arginine was decarboxylated, and [3H]putrescine was formed in equivalent amounts when l-[2,3-3H]ornithine was the substrate. The substrate preference of PBCV-1 DC was also characterized using a coupled NADH spectrophotometric assay. Steady-state decarboxylation was measured for l-arginine, l-ornithine, and l-lysine over a wide range of concentrations (Fig. 3). The relative substrate preferences for l-arginine over l-ornithine were similar to those observed by the 14CO2 release assay; however, the kcat/Km for both substrates was 8-fold lower under the conditions of the spectrophotometric assay (Table II). l-Lysine was also a substrate for the reaction and was decarboxylated with similar efficiency compared with l-ornithine (F"

Each of the six proteins MCM2, MCM3, MCM4, MCM5, MCM6, and MCM7 has a counterpart in yeast, and each is highly conserved throughout eukaryotes. Deletion of genes encoding any one of these six are lethal in S. cerevisiae or Schizosaccharomyces pombe (3Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev.

These proteins have been co-isolated as a single complex, and complexes of various combinations of these proteins have been implicated in licensing DNA for initiation of replication in Xenopus egg extracts (7Chong J.P.

Nature. 1995; 375: 421-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Another MCM protein, MCM10, is reportedly required for phosphorylation of components of the MCM2–7 complex prior to initiation (9Lee J.K. Seo Y.S. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2334-2339Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and has also been implicated in the transition from initiation to replication (10Kawasaki Y. Hiraga S. Sugino A. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 975-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Preceding initiation of replication, and at a point near the end of mitosis (11Tanaka T. Knapp D. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1997; 90: 649-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), assembly of the MCM proteins into a prereplication complex (pre-RC) occurs dependent on coordinated function of the origin recognition complex (ORC) (12Bell S.P. Stillman B. Nature. 1992; 357: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar) and proteins Cdc6 (5Aparicio O.M. Weinstein D.M. Bell S.P.

Nature. 2000; 404: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Initiation then depends upon activation by cyclin-dependent kinases (14Zou L. Stillman B. Science. 1998; 280: 593-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) and the Dbf4-dependent kinase Cdc7 (15Sclafani R.A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2111-2117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence derived from temperature-sensitive MCM protein degradation during S-phase (16Labib K. Tercero J.A. Diffley J.F. Science. 2000; 288: 1643-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar) and from measurements of MCM protein distribution in chromatin (5Aparicio O.M. Weinstein D.M. Bell S.P. Cell. 1997; 91: 59-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar) suggests that in S. cerevisiae, upon transition from initiation to elongation, the MCM2–7 complex distributes with replication forks. MCM presence at replication forks remains controversial, however, because no data directly colocalizes an MCM protein with fork proteins. Although there is evidence that MCM proteins play an important role in DNA replication in mammalian cells, evidence regarding an essential role for any individual MCM protein or a functional role for any potential MCM complex remains elusive. Studies of distribution of MCM proteins in chromatin during the cell cycle indicate certain similarities with the yeast model regarding formation of a potential pre-replication complex. MCM proteins 2, 3, 4, and 5 have been reported to enter chromatin late in mitosis, and the MCM proteins alternate between soluble and chromatin-bound forms (17Mendez J. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8602-8612Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). A subset of the MCM2–7 complex, consisting of MCMs 4, 6, and 7 (hereafter referred to as “MCM4,6,7”), has been reported to possess DNA helicase activity (18Lee J.K. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 54-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 19Ishimi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24508-24513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). As isolated from HeLa cells, helicase activity of the MCM4,6,7 complex could be inhibited by Cdk-dependent phosphorylation of MCM4 (20Ishimi Y. Komamura-Kohno Y. You Z. Omori A. Kitagawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16235-16241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 21Ishimi Y. Komamura-Kohno Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34428-34433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The MCM4,6,7 complex can be visualized by electron microscopy as a double heterotrimeric ring structure, similar to ring structures of other known helicases, including one of an MCM-like protein from archaebacteria (22Chong J.P. Hayashi M.K. Simon M.N. Xu R.M. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1530-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The helicase activity of an MCM4,6,7 complex, reconstituted from recombinant S. pombe proteins, reportedly requires the presence of forked DNA structures (18Lee J.K. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 54-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Although results taken together suggest that the MCM4,6,7 complex could represent a major replicative helicase, there is little direct evidence for this. In particular, it is not known whether this complex selectively assembles at initiation zones of DNA replication in mammalian cells. Recent reports have dealt with cell cycle distribution of MCM proteins in chromatin in the hamster DHFR locus (23Alexandrow M.G. Ritzi M. Pemov A. Hamlin J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2702-2708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 24Schaarschmidt D. Ladenburger E.M. Keller C. Knippers R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4176-4185Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), but these did not specifically address MCM4,6,7 localization or requirements for pre-RC assembly proteins. Another recent paper has examined the cell cycle levels of ORC proteins during the HeLa cell cycle, finding that ORC1 undergoes dynamic changes while the other ORC proteins remain at constant levels (25Ohta S. Tatsumi Y. Fujita M. Tsurimoto T. Obuse C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41535-41540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This study did not examine MCM protein locations. Recent reports indicate that certain MCM proteins (26Dziak R. Leishman D. Radovic M. Tye B.K. Yankulov K. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 25408-25416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), may play a role in transcription. In this study we assess the localization and distribution of components of the MCM4,6,7 complex, their clamp-loading partner Cdc6, and their partner in the pre-RC complex, ORC1, in a well characterized initiation zone centered upstream of the c-MYC gene during the HeLa cell cycle. This zone was originally mapped in this laboratory (29Vassilev L. Johnson E.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4899-4904Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and subsequently refined in a variety of studies (30Berberich S. Trivedi A. Daniel D.C. Johnson E.M. Leffak M. J. Mol.

We report a highly selective localization of MCM proteins on chromosomal DNA in a particular segment of this zone together with Cdc6 and ORC1 in late G1-phase. During ensuing S- and G2-phases MCM7, an integral component of this complex, remains at the initial site while Cdc6 together with MCM7, but not ORC1, distribute to distant sites, indicating a recruitment of additional MCM proteins to chromatin during and after replication. Cell Culture and Cell Cycle Synchrony—HeLa cells were maintained in spinner culture in Eagle's Minimal Essential Medium for suspension cultures (with l-glutamine and without calcium and magnesium, Cellgro Mediatech) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air. Cell cycle synchrony was achieved using a double thymidine block, exactly as described previously (34Karn J. Johnson E.M. Vidali G. Allfrey V.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 667-677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By this method cells are blocked at the beginning of S-phase. Cell cycle progression was verified by FACS analysis (Fig. 1A), and timing of mitosis was verified by microscopic determination of the mitotic index. To specifically examine time points at mitosis the double thymidine block was employed in conjunction with the microtubule disrupter, nocodazole. Eight hours after release from the double thymidine block, the HeLa cells were treated with nocodazole (methyl-[5-(2-thienylcarbonyl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl] carbamate, 100 ng/ml, Sigma-Aldrich) for 4 h. This treatment blocks the already synchronized cells at the G2-M boundary (35Luduena R.F. Roach M.C. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 49: 133-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). At that time the cells were released from nocodazole into new medium, and time points were taken for analysis at 1-h intervals. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and Re-precipitation (reChIP) to Detect Proteins Bound to DNA Sequences Upstream of the c-MYC Gene—Approximately 2 × 107 HeLa cells were collected every 2 or 2.5 h after release from double thymidine block (34Karn J. Johnson E.M. Vidali G. Allfrey V.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 667-677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chromatin immunoprecipitation was done using a modification of the procedure of Kuo and Allis (36Kuo M.H. Allis C.D. Methods. 1999; 19: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated for 15 min in medium containing 1% formaldehyde at room temperature, and cross-linking was quenched by adding glycine to 125 mm. Cells were washed with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6) three times. Cell pellets were resuspended in 500 μl of lysis buffer (0.1% deoxycholic acid, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin), and cells were disrupted on ice with 20 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer. Sonication was performed by pulsing three times for 15 s, incubating on ice for 2 min between each pulse, followed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min to remove cell debris. Gel electrophoresis indicates that a substantial fraction of DNA fragments at this stage are from 0.3 to 3.0 kb in length. Centrifugation was then performed for another 15 min to obtain cleared cell lysate. ChIP was performed on the cell lysate by overnight incubation at 4 °C with 4 μg of primary antibody followed by incubation with protein G Plus-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h. The beads were rinsed four times sequentially with lysis buffer 500 (0.1% deoxycholic acid, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100), LiCl/detergent solution (0.5% deoxycholic acid, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm LiCl, 0.5% Non-idet P-40, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), and TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). The beads were then incubated for 10 min at 65 °C with elution buffer (10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) to elute the precipitates. For re-ChIP, re-ChIP elution buffer (10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.7 m NaCl) was used to elute. The elution buffer was diluted to 1/5, and re-ChIP was performed using a second primary antibody as for the first ChIP. To reverse the cross-linking and purify the DNA, precipitates were incubated in a 65 °C incubator overnight and then incubated with proteinase K solution (40 μg/ml glycogen and 0.4 mg/ml proteinase K stock containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm CaCl2 in TE buffer, pH 7.6) for 2 h at 37 °C. DNA samples were then purified using LiCl and phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol. DNA was precipitated by adding ethanol to 70%, and precipitates were washed with 75% ethanol, air-dried, and resuspended in TE buffer. PCR Amplification of DNA Sequences Obtained by ChIP—-The following primers were employed to amplify genomic sequences upstream of the human c-MYC gene. Locations of the primers are specified by distances from the HindIII site at 2325 nt upstream of exon I specified by P1 promoter. myc5F 198, 5′-AAGCTGAATTGTGCAGTGCATC-3′ (528–549, 22-mer); myc3R 198, 5′-CTCACCCAAAGGCATTTTAAG-3′ (725–705, 21-mer); myc5F 350, 5′-CCTCTTCTTTGATCAGAATCG-3′ (1052–1072, 21-mer); myc3R 350, 5′-CCAATTTCTCAGCCAGGTTTC-3′ (1401–1381, 21-mer); myc5F segment a, 5′-CCTCCAGTAACTCCTCTTTC-3′ (175–195, 20-mer); myc3R segment a, 5′-CTCTACTGGCAGCAGAGATC-3′ (373–354, 20-mer); myc5F segment b, 5′-CATGGTGAACCAGAGTTTCATC-3′ (4845–4866, 22-mer); myc3R segment b, 5′-CTCAGATCCTGCAGGTACAAG-3′ (5063–5043, 21-mer); myc5F segment c, 5′-CAAAAGGACCATAGCAGAGAC-3′ (-3780–3760, 21-mer); myc3R segment c, 5′-CATACCTCCAGCTTGGCCTTC-3′ (-3598–3578, 21-mer); myc5F segment d, 5′-GTTGCCTCATCTATCTTGAGTG-3′ (62426–62447, 22-mer); myc3R segment d, 5′-GAGAACTCCTCCTTTCCAGTG-3′ (62605–62625, 21-mer); myc5F segment e, 5′-CGTTGTCATTTCCTATGTCCC-3′ (-61351–61331, 21-mer); and myc3R segment e, 5′-GTCCTTCTTATGTTCCAGGCAC-3′ (-61170–61149, 22-mer). PCRs were performed as previously described (37Johnson E.M. Kinoshita Y. Daniel D.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2915-2925Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Reactions were carried out with 0.2 mm of each dNTP, 0.3 μm primer/each, 10× PCR buffer with Mg2+, and 1.75 unit of Enzyme mix of the High Fidelity PCR System (Roche Applied Science). Hot-start PCR reactions were carried out for either 34 or 42 cycles as indicated. PCR reactions were analyzed by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels stained with SYBR Gold nucleic acid gel stain (Molecular Probes). Immunoblotting, Immunoprecipitation, and Detection of Proteins— Total HeLa cell lysates were produced by Dounce homogenization in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, in PBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm potassium chloride, 4.2 mm sodium phosphate, and 1.5 mm potassium phosphate)). Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation. SDS-PAGE and immunoblot transfers of proteins to Immobilon-P membranes were performed as described previously (38Daniel D.C. Wortman M.J. Schiller R.J. Liu H. Gan L. Mellen J.S. Chang C.F. Gallia G.L. Rappaport J. Khalili K. Johnson E.M. J. Gen. Virol. 2001; 82: 1543-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 39Barr S.M. Johnson E.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 81: 621-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The Supersignal chemiluminescence system (Pierce) was used for detection. Antibodies for MCM2 (N-19 goat polyclonal), MCM3 (N-19 goat polyclonal), MCM4 (K-18 goat polyclonal), MCM6 (C-20 goat polyclonal), MCM7 (141.2 mouse monoclonal), and ORC1 (N-17, R-15 goat polyclonal) were all obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-Cdc6 (Ab-3 mouse monoclonal) was obtained from Oncogene. Immunoprecipitation of MCM proteins from HeLa cell lysates was performed as described previously (37Johnson E.M. Kinoshita Y. Daniel D.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2915-2925Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemistry of MCM7 in Tissue Sections—Paraffin sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in 100% ethanol, 90% ethanol, and water. To quench endogenous peroxidase activity, slides were incubated for 20 min with 3% hydrogen peroxide. Antigen retrieval was performed by heating the sections in 0.1 m citrate buffer, pH 6.0, for 3 min. Sections were briefly rinsed with PBS. Slides were then incubated with primary antibody, mouse monoclonal anti-MCM7, in blocking solution (milk and goat serum in PBS) overnight at room temperature. Prior to addition of biotinylated secondary antibody and streptavidin peroxidase (BioGenex) complex for 5 min at 37 °C, sections were rinsed in PBS three times and blocked in milk/PBS. Sections were then rinsed in 0.5% Triton X-100/PBS for 10 min. The peroxidase activity was visualized using diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB kit, Vector). Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated, and mounted. Timing of Specific Localization of MCM7 in c-MYC Chromatin During the HeLa Cell Cycle—We sought a method by which we could compare simultaneous localization of a given protein at multiple points over an extended genomic sequence region. Real-time PCR was not considered practical here, because, although it provides excellent quantitation of sequence representation in a chromatin sample obtained by ChIP, the method becomes cumbersome when applied to multiple sequence locations in multiple cell cycle time points. The high degree of synchrony achieved by the double thymidine block method is shown in Fig. 1A. The adaptation of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) detailed in Fig. 1B allows assessment of the presence of a given MCM protein at two locations upstream of the c-MYC gene and, simultaneously, on an extended region between the two locations throughout the cell cycle. Fig. 1C shows the positions of two primer sets used to amplify the three indicated PCR segments. The 198-bp segment is near the center of the replication initiation zone originally mapped upstream of c-MYC (29Vassilev L. Johnson E.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4899-4904Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). It contains a prominent site of DNA bending and a purine-rich recognition element for the single-stranded DNA-binding protein, Purα (40Bergemann A.D. Johnson E.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1257-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 41Bergemann A.D. Ma Z.-W. Johnson E.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5673-5682Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The 350-bp segment is located nearer to the c-MYC transcription start site and contains various promoter elements. The sequence between these two segments contains an extensive A-T-rich region with multiple potential DNA-unwinding sites and an element for binding another single-stranded DNA-binding protein, FBP (42Duncan R. Bazar L. Michelotti G. Tomonaga T. Krutzsch H. Avigan M. Levens D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 465-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 43Bazar L. Meighen D. Harris V. Duncan R. Levens D. Avigan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8241-8248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The 876-bp segment includes the other two segments. It should be noted, however, that due to the presence of annealed primers in the amplifying region, the 876-bp segment is not amplified as efficiently as either the 198 or 350-bp segments. We hypothesized that, because the 198-bp segment is very near the center of the reported zone of initiation, proteins known to be involved in formation of the pre-initiation complex could be located there after commitment to replication, in late G1, and prior to the onset of replication, in S-phase. The cell cycle kinetics of the double thymidine block-synchronized HeLa cells has been thoroughly documented in previous publications (34Karn J. Johnson E.M. Vidali G. Allfrey V.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 667-677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We initially focused on MCM7, because it is an essential initiation component in yeast and a component of a potential helicase complex in mammalian cells. It can be seen in Fig. 1B that the presence of MCM7 differs among the three indicated PCR segments during the cell cycle. Anti-MCM7 highly selectively precipitates sequences from the 198-bp segment at 2 h (early S-phase) and 16 h (mid-to-late G1-phase) after release from the double thymidine block. At all time points tested MCM7 can be detected on this 198-bp segment. The peak of mitosis in the cell cycle of Fig. 1B occurs at ∼11.5 h. Mitosis, however, occurs very quickly relative to the scale at which time points are harvested (34Karn J. Johnson E.M. Vidali G. Allfrey V.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 667-677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the presence of MCM7 on the 198-bp segment at the 10- and 12-h points may reflect the presence of cells both pre- and post-mitosis. The detection of the 350- and 876-bp segments at 12 and 14 h suggests that some MCM7 may be present after mitosis, although the presence of a small percentage of G2 cells may contribute to this. Data to be presented later in this report indicate that there is actually a short window of time at mitosis when MCM7 is not present on the chromatin. Several aspects of the data in Fig. 1B require comment. The 0-time point was taken immediately after removal of thymidine and, thus, represents the status of the cells during blockage. Cells taken in the presence of thymidine yield similar results. At 2 and 16 h after release, when localization of MCM7 on chromatin is highly specific for the 198-bp segment, there is only slight presence of the 876-bp band. Because the larger segment includes the sequence of the smaller segment, one might expect the larger segment to be represented in the PCR products at least equally to that of the smaller one. Its lower representation reflects in part the fact that the 876-bp segment is less effectively amplified than are the two smaller segments due to steric hindrance from primers for the smaller segments. Clearly these data rely on certain controls that would attest to the quantitation of the immunoprecipitation of DNA sequences and the PCR method used to detect them. Certain of these controls, presented at the right in Fig. 1B, show that no chromatin segments are precipitated with beads alone (B), from lysate with no additions (L), or with irrelevant antibodies (a-GFP, a-GST). Additional controls are required to rule out the possibility that the size of the PCR-amplified segments could affect their amplification efficiency due to the DNA shearing during preparation. These controls are presented later in this report. The data of Fig. 1B indicate a dynamically changing distribution of MCM7 during the cell cycle, beginning with a selective localization in late G1 and early S. Note that even as MCM7 distributes to distant sites in late S and G2, it remains at its initial site on the 198-bp segment. Details of this observation will be considered under “Discussion.” ChIP of DNA Segments at Different Distances from the Initiation Zone Reveal a Dissemination of MCM7 throughout S- and G2-phases—If the presence of MCM7 is expanding outward from an initial assembly point during ongoing replication, then PCR segments that are the same size as the initial segment, but distally located, should yield results similar to those of the 350- and 876-bp segments when analyzed over the cell cycle, and the appearance of MCM7 in the more proximal segments should occur earlier than in the more distal segments. Fig. 2 shows that there is a dissemination of MCM7 to distal chromatin sites, but that dissemination is not a simple progression from a central point. Five segments have been used (a–e), all of which are at different sites from the segments used for Fig. 1. The positions of these segments are indicated in the two maps at the bottom of Fig. 2. It appears that there is increasing distribution to the segments a–d during S and G2, similar to those seen with the 350- and 876-bp segments of Fig. 1. MCM7 appears, however, in segments b and d earlier than it does in segment a, which is much closer to the 198-bp site of initial appearance. The segments closest to the initiation zone center, a–c, show the sharpest peaks of MCM7 location, from 6 to 10 h. Segments b and c are each about 4 kb from the 198-bp segment of Fig. 1, and their patterns are quite similar to that of the 350-bp segment of Fig. 1. This similar peaking may be anticipated if there is outward progression from a central segment, but the timing of MCM7 appearance is much slower than expected. Mammalian replication forks are believed to progress at >100 nt/s. Aspects of the rates of distribution of MCM7 to these segments will be considered in the discussion. Segment e shows a pattern similar to that of the 198-bp segment in Fig. 1. This segment is nearly 60 kb away from the center of the 198-bp segment and may be in or near another replicon. The patterns observed with segments a–d indicate that there is dissemination of MCM7 to multiple chromatin sites during DNA replication. If this dissemination involves progression, however, that must be coupled with an alternate, and slower, form of recruitment.

https://openalex.org/W2122122875,"We investigated the role of 14-3-3σ protein in insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptor signaling. It has been previously shown that 14-3-3σ negatively regulates cell cycle especially in response to p53-sensitive DNA damage. In this study we demonstrated that 14-3-3σ is a positive mediator of IGF-I receptor-induced cell proliferation. Treatment with IGF-I increased 14-3-3σ mRNA and protein levels about 4-fold, in a time-dependent manner in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Preincubation with the phosphoinositide 3′-kinase inhibitor LY294002 significantly reduced the effects of IGF-I on 14-3-3σ gene expression in these cells, suggesting that this effect of IGF-I occurs via the phosphoinositide 3′-kinase pathway. 14-3-3σ is induced by IGF-I in MCF-7 cells, which express wild-type p53, as well as in MCF-7 cells transfected with a small interference RNA targeting duplex that reduced p53 expression levels. These results suggest that IGF-I induces 14-3-3σ expression in a manner that is independent of p53. Using the small interference RNA strategy, we demonstrated that a 70–75% reduction of 14-3-3σ mRNA levels resulted in a similar decrease in the effects of IGF-I on cell cycle progression and proliferation in MCF-7 cells. This effect was also associated with a reduction in IGF-I-induced cyclin D1 expression. Taken together, these results suggest that 14-3-3σ positively mediates IGF-I-induced cell cycle progression.

Cells that lack the IGF-IR cannot be transformed by most oncogenes, with the exception of v-Src (1Baserga R. Exp.

Following ligand-induced autophosphorylation of the IGF-IR, the receptor forms a complex with the Shc protein (3Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Grignani F. McGlade J. Cavallo F. Forni G. Nicoletti I.

This leads to activation of two main signaling events: the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, which is implicated in receptor-mediated mitogenesis and transformation, and the phosphoinositide 3′-kinase (PI3K) pathway. Although the PI3K pathway has been implicated in the transmission of cell survival signals (8Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22628) Google Scholar, 9Samani A.A. Brodt P. Surg. Oncol. Clin. N. Am. 2001; 10: 289-312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it may also be important for IGF-I-induced progression of the cell cycle (10Dufourny B. Alblas J. van Teeffelen H.A. van Schaik F.M. van der Burg B. Steenbergh P.H. Sussenbach J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31163-31171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The progression of a cell through the G1 phase of the cell cycle is regulated by the sequential expression and degradation of G1 cyclins and the resulting activation and inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). The activity of CDKs is also influenced by the concentration of specific protein molecules known as cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (e.g. p27). Cyclin D1 is the regulatory subunit of CDK4/6, which catalyzes the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (pRb). Phosphorylated pRb fails to bind and inactivate E2F, an S phase transcription factor (11Hunter T. Pines J. Cell. 1994; 79: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2160) Google Scholar). Cyclin D1 overexpression plays an essential, albeit subsidiary, role in the transition between the G1 and S phase in proliferating cells. It has been reported that the accumulation of cyclin D1 in cyclin D1-overexpressing tumors (12Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4986) Google Scholar) accelerates the cell cycle by decreasing the duration of the G1 phase (13Quelle D.E. Ashmun R.A. Shurtleff S.A. Kato J.Y. Bar-Sagi D. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1559-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). IGF-I has been shown to regulate both the expression and the activity of various molecules involved in progression of the cell cycle. Several studies have reported that IGF-I induces cyclin D1 expression in a number of tumor cell lines, including breast cancer cells (14Dupont J. Karas M. LeRoith D. J. Biol.

The idea that regulation of cyclin D1 plays an essential role in the mitogenic actions of IGF-I is consistent with studies showing that expression of antisense cyclin D1 in human pancreatic cells abolished the ability of IGF-I to stimulate proliferation of these cells (16Kornmann M.

IGF-I also induces the expression of cyclin E, which is involved in late G1 phase, in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells (19Lai A. Sarcevic B. Prall O.W. Sutherland R.L. J. Biol.

In MCF-7 cells, IGF-I induces the expression of p21 via the PI3K pathway to inhibit UV-induced cell death (21Murray S.A. Zheng H. Gu L. Jim Xiao Z.X.

The 14-3-3 proteins are a family of highly conserved acidic proteins that includes at least seven different mammalian isoforms (α, β, δ, ϵ, γ, η, and σ) (22Wang W. Shakes D.C. J. Mol.

These proteins are a part of an emerging family of proteins and protein domains that bind to serine and/or threonine-phosphorylated residues in a context-specific manner, analogous to the Src homology 2 and phosphotyrosine-binding domains (23Tzivion G.

It was originally identified as a p53-inducible gene that is responsive to DNA-damaging agents (35Hermeking H. Lengauer C. Polyak K. He T.C. Zhang L. Thiagalingam S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 3-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar). 14-3-3σ apparently sequesters the mitotic initiation complex, cdc2-cyclinB1, within the cytoplasm after DNA damage. This prevents cdc2-cyclin B1 from entering the nucleus, where it would normally initiate mitosis. In this manner, 14-3-3σ induces G2 arrest and allows the repair of damaged DNA (35Hermeking H.

In this study, we have investigated the effects of IGF-I on regulation of 14-3-3σ and the role of this protein in IGF-I-induced mitogenesis in MCF-7 cells. Reagents and Antibodies—The radionuclide [α-32P]dCTP (6000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Recombinant human IGF-I was obtained from Genentech (San Francisco, CA). The PI3K-specific inhibitor LY294002 was purchased from Sigma. The MEK1/2-specific inhibitor UO126 was from Calbiochem (La Jolla, Ca), and the JNK1/2-specific inhibitor SP600125 was from Biomol Research Laboratories Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, MA). The siRNA duplexes and p53 siGENE SMART pool were purchased from Dharmacon Research (Lafayette, CO). The TransIT-TKO Transfection Reagent was from Mirus (Madison, WI). The CycleTEST Plus DNA kit was purchased from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA). Antibodies were obtained from various companies, as follows: 14-3-3σ, NeoMarkers (Fremont, CA); phospho-Akt (Ser473), Akt, phospho-MAPK (ERK1/2) (Thr202/Tyr204), MAPK, phospho-JNK1/2(Thr183/Tyr185), JNK1, and p53 polyclonal antibodies, Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA); cyclin D1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, California); actin (Ab-1) kit, Oncogene (Cambridge, MA); and anti-rabbit IgG and anti-mouse IgG secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies, Amersham Biosciences. Enhanced chemiluminescence reagents were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Cell Culture—MCF-7 human breast cancer cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). MCF-7 cells were cultured in IMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (100 IU/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). The cells were cultured in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The cells were split before they reached confluence, except as indicated. Western Blotting—Total cell lysates were prepared on ice with lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 5% glycerol, 10 mm NaF, 0.3 mm NaMo, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 0.5 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride) containing various protease inhibitors (2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, and 10 mg/ml aprotinin). The lysates were centrifuged for 20 min at 4 °C, and the insoluble fraction was discarded. The total protein concentration in the soluble lysates was measured using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Samples containing 50 or 100 μg of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen). The blots were blocked and probed with the various antibodies, as indicated in the figure legends. After extensive washing, immunoreactivity was detected with specific secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase followed by enhanced chemiluminescence. Densitometry was performed by scanning the radiographs and then analyzing the bands with Mac Bas V2.52 software (Fuji Photo Film). Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from cells by using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). Five micrograms were resolved on 1.5% agarose/formaldehyde gels and transferred to a nylon filter by using standard methods (Gene Screen; DuPont). A 375-bp 14-3-3σ-specific probe was generated by using MCF-7 cDNA as a template and the primers 5′-ACAGGGGAACTTTATTGAGAGG-3′ and 5′-AAGGGCTCCGTGGAGAGGG-3′ (35Hermeking H. Lengauer C. Polyak K.

To test for uniform loading of the samples, blots were stripped and reprobed with pTRI RNA 18S-Human or pTRI-GAPDH-Human (Ambion, Austin, TX). 14-3-3σ siRNA—The siRNA duplexes were 21 base pairs. They were selected from within the open reading frames of 14-3-3σ. We chose the following three siRNA duplexes: 117, 5′-GAGCGAAACCUGCUCUCAG-3′; 371, 5′-GGGUGACUACUACCGCUAC-3′; and 641, 5′-AGACAGCACCCUCAUCAUG-3′. The control siRNA was si-GFP: 5′-GACCCGCGCCGAGGUGAAGdTdT-3′ (37Cortez D. Guntuku S. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1713-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). For transient transfections, MCF-7 cells were seeded at a density of 50–70% in 60-mm-diameter plates in IMEM containing 10% FBS. The following day, transfections were performed by using TransIT-TKO Transfection Reagent. MCF-7 cells maintained in IMEM containing 10% FBS were incubated with Trans IT-TKO transfection reagent and 25–100 nm siRNA oligonucleotides for 24 h, according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol. Northern blot analysis was used to determine transfection efficiency. From this experiment, we chose the most effective 14-3-3σ siRNA 117 (see Fig. 4). We checked the GenBank™ data base, and found that siRNA 117 is 14-3-3σ-specific. Cell Proliferation Assays—The cells were transiently transfected with 100 nm of either GFP siRNA or 14-3-3σ siRNA. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were transferred to 24-well tissue culture plates (4 × 104 cells/well) in IMEM with 10% FBS. After 15 h of incubation, the medium was switched to IMEM containing 1% FBS for 16 h. The cells were then cultured in IMEM containing 1% FBS in the presence or absence of 50 nm IGF-I. At the indicated times, the cells were harvested by trypsinization and counted with a hemacytometer. Flow Cytometric Analysis—The cells were seeded at a density of 60 to 70% in 100-mm-diameter plates in IMEM containing 10% FBS for 24 h. The cells were then switched to serum-free and phenol red-free IMEM for 16 h. For cell cycle analysis, the CycleTEST PLUS DNA reagent kit (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, CA) was used. After 16 h of serum starvation, the cells were cultured in FBS-free and phenol red-free IMEM in the presence or absence of 50 nm IGF-I. At the indicated times, the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and collected. According to the manufacturer's protocol, 1 × 106 cells were washed three times with buffer solution from the kit. The cell pellets were then resuspended in 1 ml of buffer solution and were frozen at –80 °C until further analysis. According to the manufacturer's protocol, isolate, and stain cell nuclei from frozen cell suspensions, the samples were then filtered using a 35-μm cell strainer (Fisher), and the DNA content was stained and determined by flow cytometry. All analyses were carried out on a FACSCalibur using CellQuest Software (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). IGF-I Increases 14-3-3σ Expression—It is well known that the IGF-IR plays an important role in cell proliferation and survival. We therefore examined whether the biological function of 14-3-3σ, which is known to negatively regulate cell cycle progression, is linked to IGF-I function. To determine the 14-3-3σ mRNA levels after IGF-I stimulation, serum-starved MCF-7 cells were treated with 50 nm IGF-I for 2–8 h. 14-3-3σ mRNA levels were then determined by Northern blot. As shown in Fig. 1A, IGF-I treatment increased 14-3-3σ mRNA levels in a time-dependent manner. 14-3-3σ mRNA levels were elevated ∼4-fold after 8 h of exposure to IGF-I. To examine 14-3-3σ protein levels, MCF-7 cells were starved in IMEM containing 0.2% FBS, and then the cells were treated with 50 nm IGF-I for 6–18 h. 14-3-3σ protein levels were determined by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 1B, IGF-I treatment increased 14-3-3σ protein levels in a time-dependent manner. 14-3-3σ protein levels were elevated ∼4-fold after 12 h of exposure to IGF-I. Inhibition of PI3K Blocks IGF-I-induced 14-3-3σ Expression—It is well established that IGF-I receptor activation results in the initiation of the MAPK, PI3K/AKT, and JNK1/2 signaling pathways. To identify which of the above the pathway(s) is involved in the regulation of 14-3-3σ expression, we used specific pharmacological inhibitors corresponding to each of these three pathways (U0126, LY294002, and SP600125 for MAPK, PI3K/AKT, and JNK1/2 pathways, respectively). Serum-starved cells were treated with the various inhibitors for 1 h prior to stimulation with IGF-I (50 nm). The use of phospho-specific antibodies in Western blot analysis revealed that U0126, LY294002, and SP600125 inhibited IGF-I-induced activation of ERK1/2, Akt, and JNK1/2, respectively, as shown in Fig. 2A. The total levels of ERK1/2, Akt, and JNK1 immunoreactivity were similar among the samples, indicating that these effects were not due to differences in the total amounts of these proteins. Fig. 2B indicates that neither U0126 (a MAPK pathway inhibitor) nor SP600125 (a JNK1/2 pathway inhibitor) affected IGF-I-induced expression of 14-3-3σ. However, we found that the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (50 μm) reduced IGF-I-induced 14-3-3σ mRNA levels under conditions that blocked Akt phosphorylation. Thus, the IGF-I-induced expression of 14-3-3σ in MCF-7 cells is mediated specifically through the PI3K pathway. p53 Is Not Involved in the Up-regulation of 14-3-3σ by IGF-I— Because 14-3-3σ is a downstream target of p53 in DNA damage, the IGF-I-induced up-regulation of its expression may be mediated through the action of p53. Thus, we first examined the expression of p53 in MCF-7 cells. IGF-I increased p53 protein levels following 2 and 6 h of stimulation (Fig. 3A). We then investigated the role of p53 in the effects of IGF-I on 14-3-3σ by reducing p53 levels by 80% in MCF-7 cells using the siGENE p53 SMART pool (Fig. 3B). We found that IGF-I-induced increases in 14-3-3σ levels were equivalent in si-p53 cells and in control si-GFP cells (Fig. 3C). Thus, the IGF-I-induced up-regulation of 14-3-3σ is p53-independent. Development of an Effective siRNA Targeting 14-3-3σ—To determine the biological function of 14-3-3σ expressed in response to IGF-I, we used the siRNA technique to specifically reduce 14-3-3σ levels in MCF-7 cells. We designed siRNAs with a sequence located within the open reading frame of human 14-3-3σ. After transient transfection into MCF-7 cells, Northern blot analysis was used to evaluate the effects of siRNA expression (Fig. 4A). We chose the most effective siRNA duplex, 117, at its most effective concentration (100 nm), to use in further experiments to diminish 14-3-3σ gene expression. To confirm the specificity of 117 siRNA for 14-3-3σ, we examined the 14-3-3σ gene expression either in parental MCF-7 cells or in cells transfected with either GFP siRNA (si-GFP) or 14-3-3σ siRNA (si-σ). We found that 14-3-3σ levels were similar in parental and si-GFP MCF-7 cells. In contrast, 14-3-3σ levels were reduced in si-σ MCF-7 cells. These data demonstrate that 117 siRNA specifically targets 14-3-3σ (Fig. 4B). Growth Inhibition of MCF-7 Cells in Response to IGF-I by Knockdown of 14-3-3σ Using siRNA Targeting 14-3-3σ—To understand the role of 14-3-3σ in the mitogenic effects of IGF-I, we transiently transfected either si-GFP (as a control) or si-σ into MCF-7 cells (Fig. 5A). We then compared the effects of IGF-I on the cellular proliferation rates of si-σ cells with that of si-GFP cells. The cells were plated at a density of 4 × 104 cells/well in 24-well plates and incubated in the presence or absence of IGF-I (50 nm) for 42, 60, or 90 h. IGF-I-induced cell growth was reduced by 40% in si-σ cells, as compared with si-GFP cells (Fig. 5B). Thus, a reduction in the expression of 14-3-3σ decreases IGF-I-induced cell proliferation in MCF-7 cells. 14-3-3σ Is Important for IGF-I-induced Cell Cycle Progression—We next examined whether 14-3-3σ is important in IGF-I induced cell cycle progression. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis was used to determine the effects of IGF-I on the distribution of si-GFP and si-σ MCF-7 cells in the various phases of the cell cycle. The cells were serum-starved for 16 h after transfection and stimulated with IGF-I (50 nm) for the indicated times. Representative results are shown in Table I. After 18 h of IGF-I stimulation, 30% of si-GFP cells and 19% of si-σ cells progressed to the S phase. After 24 h of IGF-I stimulation, 55% of si-GFP cells and 45% of si-σ cells progressed to the S phase. Thus, the decrease in proliferation rate in response to IGF-I in si-σ cells correlates with an increase in the proportion of cells in G1, suggesting that these cells exhibit a delay in progression from G1 to S. These data show that 14-3-3σ expression is specifically required in IGF-I-induced cell cycle progression. We used Northern blot analysis to examine the expression of 14-3-3σ in si-σ and si-GFP cells. These experiments showed that 14-3-3σ mRNA levels were reduced by 75% in si-σ cells, as compared with si-GFP cells (Fig. 6).Table IDNA content analysis by fluorescence-activated cell sorting in MCF-7 si-GFP and si-σ transfection cells in response to IGF-I (50 nm)Time of stimulationCellsCells in cell cycleG0-G1SG2-M%0 hsi-GFP9091si-σ8712118 hsi-GFP68302si-σ7919224 hsi-GFP43552si-σ53452 Open table in a new tab Expression of Cyclin D1 in Response to IGF-I Is Reduced in si-σ MCF-7 Cells—To determine why G1 to S progression is delayed in MCF-7 14-3-3σ siRNA cells in response to IGF-I, we transiently transfected either si-GFP (as a control) or si-σ into MCF-7 cells (Fig. 7A). We then examined the levels of cyclin D1, which is essential for progression through G1 phase (11Hunter T. Pines J. Cell. 1994; 79: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2160) Google Scholar, 38Filmus J. Robles A.I. Shi W. Wong M.J. Colombo L.L. Conti C.J.

Twenty-four hours after transfection, the si-GFP and si-σ cells were serum-starved for 16 h and then stimulated with IGF-I (50 nm) for 8 h. As shown in Fig. 7B, cyclin D1 immunoreactivity in response to IGF-I is reduced by 65% in si-σ cells, as compared with the si-GFP cells. Thus, the delay in G1 to S progression in response to IGF-I in si-σ MCF-7 cells is associated with a reduction in the expression of cyclin D1. We also examined the expression of cyclin D1 in the si-GFP and si-σ cells without IGF-I stimulation at 8 h. They have similar cyclin D1 expression levels (data not shown). The 14-3-3 protein is induced under various biological conditions, including cell cycle arrest, differentiation, and apoptosis (23Tzivion G. Shen Y.H. Zhu J.

Bioessays. 2001; 23: 936-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). 14-3-3σ has been described as a negative cell cycle regulator in HCT116 cells, because it is induced in response to DNA damage and leads to G2/M arrest (43Chan T.A. Hermeking H. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1999; 401: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). Cells that lack 14-3-3σ are defective in the maintenance of G2 arrest (43Chan T.A. Hermeking H. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1999; 401: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). 14-3-3σ has also been described as a potent inhibitor of cell proliferation in many breast cancer cell lines. For example, in MDA-MB-361, MCF-7, and HER-18 breast cancer cells, overexpression of 14-3-3σ blocks cell growth and entry into the S phase of the cell cycle (28Laronga C. Yang H.Y. Neal C. Lee M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23106-23112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). 14-3-3σ also can bind to and inhibit various cyclin-dependent kinases, CDK2, CDC2, and CDK4, which regulate cell cycle progression and cell proliferation, and represent a novel class of CDK inhibitors (28Laronga C. Yang H.Y. Neal C. Lee M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23106-23112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). We have now evaluated the effects of IGF-I on 14-3-3σ mRNA and protein levels and found that the PI3K signaling pathway plays a critical role in stimulating 14-3-3σ gene expression in response to IGF-I. Binding of IGF-I to its receptor is followed by a rapid phosphorylation of several protein substrates that leads to the activation of the PI3K and MAPK signaling pathways. The MAPK pathway is closely associated with gene expression and cell proliferation. IGF-I has also been shown to strongly activate MAPK in MCF-7 and T47D breast cancer cells (44Hermanto U. Zong C.S. Wang L.H. Cell Growth & Differ. 2000; 11: 655-664PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway has been shown to be important for cell survival, because Akt can directly phosphorylate and modulate a set of protein substrates that are critical for apoptosis, including BAD (45Datta S.R.

Brodt P. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 974-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) reported that IGF-I up-regulates MT1-MMP (the membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase) via the PI3K/Akt pathway. It was also reported that IGF-I induces vascular endothelial growth factor expression through the PI3K pathway in human osteoblast-like MG63 cells (54Akeno N. Robins J. Zhang M. Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. Clemens T.L. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 420-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Activation of the PI3K pathway is important not only for cell survival but also for cell proliferation (10Dufourny B. Alblas J. van Teeffelen H.A. van Schaik F.M. van der Burg B. Steenbergh P.H. Sussenbach J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31163-31171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 20Chakravarthy M.V. Abraha T.W. Schwartz R.J. Fiorotto M.L. Booth F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35942-35952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). It has previously been reported that 14-3-3σ is induced by p53 in response to γ irradiation and other DNA-damaging agents (35Hermeking H. Lengauer C. Polyak K. He T.C. Zhang L. Thiagalingam S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 3-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Akt has been shown to directly phosphorylate and regulate several components in the p53 pathway, including p21 and MDM2 (21Murray S.A. Zheng H. Gu L. Jim Xiao Z.X. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1703-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, in this study, we showed that IGF-I-induced expression of 14-3-3σ persisted even when p53 expression was reduced by siRNA in MCF-7 cells. Although 14-3-3σ is induced in response to IGF-I in MCF-7 cells, which express wild-type p53, the up-regulation of 14-3-3σ in response to IGF-I appears to be p53-independent. In a previous study, we showed that IGF-I reduces p53 expression by inducing MDM2-dependent degradation of p53 via the p38 MAPK pathway in response to 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide-induced DNA damage in NIH3T3 cells (55Heron-Milhavet L. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15600-15606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, in this study, we found that IGF-I increases p53 expression in MCF-7 cells. It has also been reported that IGF-I increases p53 expression in response to UV-induced DNA damage in MCF-7 cells (21Murray S.A. Zheng H. Gu L. Jim Xiao Z.X. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1703-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In different cells, with different signaling systems, the IGF-IR may trigger different cellular tumor surveillance machinery. In MCF-7 cells, it is possible that IGF-I may activate p14ARF, which in turn activates p53 (21Murray S.A. Zheng H. Gu L. Jim Xiao Z.X. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1703-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Because p53 functions as a gatekeeper against abnormal cell growth and genomic instability, it is conceivable that abnormal proliferation signals, such as high levels of IGF-I, may activate the p53 pathway, which restrains the abnormal cell proliferation. In MCF-7 cells, Dufourny et al. (10Dufourny B. Alblas J. van Teeffelen H.A. van Schaik F.M. van der Burg B. Steenbergh P.H. Sussenbach J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31163-31171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) showed that certain stimulatory effects of IGF-I on cell cycle progression, such as the accumulation of cyclin D1 and hyperphosphorylation of pRb, were blocked by the specific PI3K inhibitor LY294002. From these results, they suggested that PI3K activity, but not MAPK activity, was required for transduction of the mitogenic IGF-I signal in these cells. In a previous study, we showed that IGF-I induced p21 expression through the MAPK pathway is involved in the mitogenic effects of IGF-I (56Dupont J. Karas M. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37256-37264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Thus, both PI3K and MAPK are important signaling pathways involved in the effects of IGF-I on cell cycle progression in MCF-7 cells. In HCT116 cells, 14-3-3σ might block entry into mitosis by anchoring the cdc2/cyclin B1complex in the cytoplasm after treatment with adriamycin, which causes DNA damage (43Chan T.A. Hermeking H. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1999; 401: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). In MCF-7 cells, in contrast, we show for the first time that IGF-I induces 14-3-3σ through the PI3K/Akt pathway and that this is involved in the mitogenic effects of IGF-I, because abrogation of 14-3-3σ expression by transient transfection of siRNA targeting 14-3-3σ in MCF-7 decreased the mitogenic effects of IGF-I by 40%. Moreover, we show that this reduction in mitogenic activity is correlated with a delay in G1/S progression. This indicates that, at least in MCF-7 cells, 14-3-3σ plays a positive role in growth factor-induced mitogenesis. Here, we have shown for the first time that a reduction in 14-3-3σ gene expression in MCF-7 cells is associated with a decrease in IGF-I-induced cyclin D1 expression. These data probably explain the reduction in the cell proliferation and the delay in cell cycle progression. Cyclin D1 plays an important role in controlling the cell cycle in mammary tissue, and clinical studies of human breast cancer have confirmed its importance. For example, overexpression of cyclin D1 was observed in about 50% of human mammary carcinomas that were evaluated (57Bartkova J. Lukas J. Muller H. Lutzhoft D. Strauss M. Bartek J. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 57: 353-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 58Gillett C. Fantl V. Smith R. Fisher C. Bartek J. Dickson C. Barnes D. Peters G. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1812-1817PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that deregulated cyclin D1 expression may play an important role in canine mammary carcinogenesis and that canine malignant mammary tumors exhibiting high levels of cyclin D1 expression show higher rates of proliferation than cyclin D1-negative tumors (59Sfacteria A. Bertani C. Costantino G. Del Bue M. Paiardini M. Cervasi B. Piedimonte A. De Vico G. J. Comp. Pathol. 2003; 128: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In summary, we have delineated the molecular mechanisms by which 14-3-3σ expression is increased in response to IGF-I in MCF-7 cells. We showed that IGF-I up-regulation to 14-3-3σ is independent of p53. Using siRNA to specifically reduce 14-3-3σ expression, we demonstrated that 14-3-3σ is a key positive regulator in IGF-I-induced cell proliferation. Moreover, we showed for the first time that a reduction in 14-3-3σ gene expression is associated with a decrease in the cyclin D1 expression in MCF-7 cells. Future studies will focus on further characterizing the interaction between the IGF-IR, 14-3-3σ, and cyclin D1. We thank Dr. Joelle Dupont for helpful suggestions."
https://openalex.org/W2045862161,"The inhibition of phorbol ester activation of phospholipase D1 (PLD1) by protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors has been considered proof of phosphorylation-dependent activation of PLD1 by PKCα. We studied the effect of the PKC inhibitors Ro-31-8220 and bisindolylmaleimide I on PLD1 activation and found that they inhibited the activation by interfering with PKCα binding to PLD1. Further studies showed that only unphosphorylated PKCα could bind to and activate PLD1 and that both inhibitors induced phosphorylation of PKCα. The phosphorylation status of either PLD1 or PKCα per se did not affect PLD1 activation in vitro. Immunofluorescence studies showed that PLD1 remained in the perinuclear region after phorbol ester treatment, whereas PKCα translocated from cytosol to both plasma membrane and perinuclear regions. Both Ro-31-8220 and bisindolylmaleimide I blocked the translocation of PKCα to the perinuclear region but not to the plasma membrane. Studies with okadaic acid suggested that phosphorylation regulated the relocation of PKCα from the plasma membrane to the perinuclear region. It is proposed that localization and interaction of PKCα with PLD1 in the perinuclear region is required for PLD1 activation and that PKC inhibitors inhibit this through phosphorylation of PKCα, which blocks its translocation."
https://openalex.org/W2053646056,"Although basic calcium phosphate (BCP) crystals are common in osteoarthritis, the crystal-induced signal transduction pathways in human fibroblasts have not been fully comprehended. We have previously demonstrated that the induction of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) 1 and 3 by BCP crystals follows both the calcium-dependent protein kinase C (PKC) pathway and the calcium-independent p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p44/42 MAPK) pathway. Although we showed that the calcium-dependent PKC pathway was characterized by calcium-dependent PKCα, here we show that the calcium-independent p44/42 MAPK pathway is mediated by calcium-independent PKCμ. Inhibition of PKCμ synthesis and activity by antisense oligodeoxynucleotides and H-89 (N-(2-[p-bromocinnamylamino]ethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide), respectively, results in the inhibition of p44/42 MAPK activation, thus demonstrating that p44/42 MAPK activity is dependent upon PKCμ. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting also show that inhibition of PKCμ results in the inhibition of MMP-1 and MMP-3 mRNA and protein expression as a result of p44/42 MAPK inhibition. These results now lead us to the conclusion that BCP crystal activation of human fibroblasts follows two pathways: 1) the calcium-dependent PKC pathway characterized by PKCα and 2) the calcium-independent p44/42 MAPK pathway mediated by PKCμ, which operate independently leading to an increase in mitogenesis and MMP synthesis and ultimately complementing each other for the efficient regulation of cellular responses to BCP crystal stimulation of human fibroblasts.

They frequently occur in the joints of osteoarthritis patients and can be phlogistic (1Ryan L.M. Cheung H.S. Rheum. Dis. Clin. N. Am. 1999; 25: 257-267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 2Halverson P.B. Koopman W.J. Arthritis and Allied Conditions. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2001: 2371Google Scholar). There is compelling evidence that these crystals engender multiple biological effects that promote joint degeneration. The presence of BCP crystals correlates strongly with radiographic evidence of cartilaginous degeneration and synovial thickening and is associated with larger joint effusions when compared with joint fluid from osteoarthritis knees where BCP crystals are absent (3Halverson P.B. McCarty D.J. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1986; 45: 603-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 4Schumacher H.R. Arthritis Rheum. 1968; 11: 426-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Conversely, osteoarthritis is both more common and more severe in patients with calcium-containing crystals. We have demonstrated that BCP crystals stimulate the proliferation and synthesis of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in cultured human foreskin and synovial fibroblasts (5McCarty G.M. Mitchell P.G.

The addition of BCP crystals to the growth medium yielded an immediate 10-fold rise in the intracellular calcium level and a second rise starting at 60 min and lasting for 3 h. This second rise in the intracellular calcium level is probably because of the intracellular dissolution of phagocytosed crystals, which may activate a variety of calcium-dependent signals and induce sustained cell proliferation and MMP synthesis (10Halverson P.B. Greene A. Cheung H.S. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 1998; 6: 324-329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To date, BCP crystal-induced signal transduction has not been fully comprehended. We have previously demonstrated that the induction of human MMP-I and MMP-3 expression by BCP crystals, in part, follows the p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p44/42 MAPK) signal transduction pathway (11Sun Y. Wenger L. Brinkerhoff C.E. Misra R.R. Herman H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1544-1552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 12Brogley M.A. Cruz M. Cheung H.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 180: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We have also shown that BCP crystal stimulation of MMP-1 and MMP-3 mRNA and protein expression in human fibroblasts are mediated, in part, through the calcium-dependent protein kinase C (PKC) signal transduction pathway and that the PKCα isozyme is specifically involved in the pathway (13Reuben P.M. Brogley M.A. Sun Y. Cheung H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 277: 15190-15198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We found that these two pathways operate independently since the p44/42 MAPK inhibitors, PD098058 and U0126, had no effect on the BCP crystal stimulation of PKC and the PKC inhibitors, staurosporine, bisindolylmaleimide I, and Gö6979, had no effect on the BCP crystal activation of p44/42 MAPK (13Reuben P.M. Brogley M.A. Sun Y. Cheung H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 277: 15190-15198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, the possibility that a PKC isozyme that was not sensitive to the PKC inhibitors might be required for the BCP crystal activation of the p44/42 MAPK signal transduction could not be ruled out. Therefore, we undertook the current study to identify all of the PKC isozymes involved in the BCP crystal activation of human fibroblasts and to further examine the interrelationship between the PKC and the p44/42 MAPK signal transduction pathways involved in the process. Activation of p44/42 MAPK in response to various agonists can occur via mechanisms that may be PKC-dependent (14Todico A. Takeuchi Y. Urumov A. Yamado J. Stepan V.M. Yamada T. Am. J. Physiol.

Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 296-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Even in the same cell type, p44/42 MAPK activation can be PKC-dependent or PKC-independent depending upon the stimulus presented and the corresponding cellular response (19Buscher D. Hipskind R.A. Krautwald S. Reimann T. Baccarini M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 466-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the PKC family of isozymes consists of three subfamilies: the conventional, the novel, and the atypical isozymes. Whereas the conventional isozymes (α, βI, βII, and γ) require calcium, phospholipid, and 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol (DAG) for their activities, the novel isozymes (δ, ϵ, η, and θ) require only DAG and phorbol ester and the atypical isozymes (ζ, ι, and λ) require neither calcium nor DAG for their maximal activities (20Cohen R.I. Molina-Holgado E. Almazan G. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 43: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 21Larocca J.N. Almazan G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 50: 743-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Human PKCμ and its murine analog, protein kinase D (PKD), form a distinct class (22Johannes F.-J. Prestle J. Eis S. Oberhagemann P. Pfizenmaier K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6140-6148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Van Lint J. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar) and are activated by DAG in the absence of calcium (23Van Lint J. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1455-1461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 25Johannes F.-J. Prestle J. Dietrich S. Oberhagemann P. Link Pfizenmaier K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Recently, this class has been named the PKD family, which comprises three isoforms: PKCμ/PKD1; PKD2; and PKD3 (26Rykx A. Kimpe L.D. Mikhalap S. Vantus T. Seufferlein T. Vandenheede J.R. Lint J.V. FEB Lett. 2003; 546: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In contrast to other PKC isozymes, PKCμ has a hydrophobic N terminus, a transmembrane domain, a regulatory C1 domain with an extended spacing of two cysteine clusters, and an additional 270 amino acid sequence that separates the protein kinase domain from the regulatory C1 domain, resulting in an unusually large isozyme with an apparent molecular mass of 115 kDa (22Johannes F.-J. Prestle J. Eis S. Oberhagemann P. Pfizenmaier K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6140-6148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Johannes F.-J. Prestle J. Dietrich S. Oberhagemann P. Link Pfizenmaier K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In addition, PKCμ contains a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that may exert an inhibitory effect on its kinase activity and also lacks the C2 domain that is responsible for the calcium sensitivity of the conventional PKC subgroup, thereby making it calcium-unresponsive (22Johannes F.-J. Prestle J. Eis S. Oberhagemann P. Pfizenmaier K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6140-6148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the lack of a pseudosubstrate sequence present in the other PKC family members, PKCμ also displays a distinct inhibitor and substrate specificity (27Gschwendt M. Dieterich S. Rennecke J. Kittstein W. Mueller M.-J. Johannes F.-J. FEB Lett. 1996; 392: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar, 28Rennecke J. Johannes F.-J. Richter K.H. Kittstein W. Marks F. Gschwendt M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 428-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In our previous work, only the PKC isozymes in the conventional subfamily were examined (13Reuben P.M. Brogley M.A. Sun Y. Cheung H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 277: 15190-15198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In this work, we extended our study to include other PKC isozymes in the novel, atypical, and PKD subfamilies to determine their expression and potential involvement in the BCP crystal-induced activation of the p44/42 MAPK signal transduction pathway in the human fibroblasts (HF). We also further examined the relationship between the BCP crystal-induced PKC and p44/42 MAPK signal transduction pathways. Materials—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), phosphate-buffered saline, fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin, streptomycin, fungizone, protein A-agarose, ThermoScript RT-PCR system, and TRIzol reagent were obtained from Invitrogen. Phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu), l-α-phosphatidyl-l-serine, DAG, N-(2-[p-bromocinnamylamino]ethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide (H-89), leupeptin, and aprotinin were obtained from Sigma. U0126 and monoclonal antibodies against MMP-1 and MMP-3 were from Calbiochem. Concentrated serum-free medium containing MMP-1 and MMP-3 control proteins was from Chemicon International Inc. (Temecula, CA). Monoclonal phospho-p44/42 MAPK antibody and polyclonal p44/42 MAPK antibody were from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Polyclonal antibodies against PKC α, βI, βII, γ, δ, ϵ, η, and ζ were from Pan Vera (Madison, WI). Monoclonal antibody against PKCα, polyclonal antibodies against PKCθ, PKCι, and PKCμ, rat brain extract, rat thymus, NIH 3T3, and K-562 whole cell lysates were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate and Anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate were from Promega (Madison, WI). SuperSignal WestPico chemiluminescent substrate was from Pierce. Cell Culture—HF were established from explants and transferred as described previously (29Cheung H.S. J. Tissue Cult. Methods. 1980; 6: 39-40Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). They were grown and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS containing 1% penicillin, streptomycin, and fungizone. All of the cultures were third or fourth passage cells. All of the experiments were performed on confluent monolayers that had been rendered quiescent by removing the medium, washing the cells with DMEM alone, and subsequently incubating the cells in the same medium containing 0.2% FBS for 24 h. This medium then was removed, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and serum-free DMEM was added to the cells and allowed to equilibrate before being used for the experiments. For the inhibition experiments, the cells were pretreated with the appropriate concentrations of the inhibitors for 30 min, unless otherwise stated, before being stimulated with the required concentrations of the agonists and for the indicated length of time. Synthesis of BCP Crystals—BCP crystals were synthesized by a modification of previously published methods (30Evans R.W. Cheung H.S. McCarty D.J. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1994; 36: 645-650Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These crystals have a calcium/phosphate ratio of 1.59 and contain partially carbonate-substituted hydroxyapatite mixed with octacalcium phosphate as indicated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The crystals were crushed and sieved to yield 10–20-μm aggregates, which were sterilized and rendered pyrogen-free by heating at 200 °C for at least 90 min. RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated using the TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. 1 μg of each sample then was reverse-transcribed at 60 °C for 60 min followed by enzyme inactivation at 85 °C for 5 min using the ThermoScript RT-PCR system. PCR primers for MMP-1, MMP-3, and β-actin were designed and synthesized as described previously (13Reuben P.M. Brogley M.A. Sun Y. Cheung H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 277: 15190-15198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (58) Google Scholar). PCR primers for PKCμ were as follows: sense, 5′-GAGATATCTCTGTGAGTATTTCAG-3′, corresponding to positions 1908–1931, and antisense, 5′-ACACATTTTCTGGTTTGAGGTCAC-3′, corresponding to positions 2349–2372 of the nucleotide sequence of the human PKCμ and giving a PCR product of 465 bp (22Johannes F.-J. Prestle J. Eis S. Oberhagemann P. Pfizenmaier K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6140-6148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Amplifications were carried out as previously described (13Reuben P.M. Brogley M.A. Sun Y. Cheung H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 277: 15190-15198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (58) Google Scholar) with the exception that MMP-1 was done at 25 cycles while PKCμ and MMP-3 were done at 30 cycles. The PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. Cell Lysis—After the experiment, the cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and the plates were drained. 1 ml of cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1% Triton X-100) then was added to each 100-mm plate and placed on ice with occasional shaking. The cells were then scraped into 1.5-ml Microfuge tubes and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes, and the protein concentrations were determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent (Hercules, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The lysates were either used immediately or stored at –70 °C. Immunoprecipitation—Following an experiment, the cells were lysed and aliquots of the lysates were incubated with the appropriate antibodies on ice for 4 h to allow formation of the immune complexes. Protein A-agarose gel was added to each mixture and gently rotated overnight at 4 °C to allow the immune complexes to bind by adsorption of the antibody to protein A. The unbound proteins were removed by washing the solid phase several times with the lysis buffer by centrifugation, leaving the immune complexes bound to the agarose gel. The purified immune complexes were ready for further analysis by gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting after adding an equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer and boiling for 5 min, or the immune complexes were used for enzyme activity studies. Expression of PKC Isozymes in HF—HF cells were grown on 100-mm plates to confluency in DMEM containing 10% FBS and then washed with phenol red-free DMEM containing 0.2% FBS and starved in the same medium for 24 h. This medium then was replaced with serum-free and phenol red-free DMEM and allowed to equilibrate in that medium before the cells were treated with or without BCP crystals for 15 min. After removing the medium and washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were lysed and total proteins were extracted using the mammalian protein extraction reagent or M-PER obtained from Pierce according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein concentrations in the extracts were determined as described before. Aliquots of the extracts with equal protein concentrations were electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and subjected to Western blotting. Western Blotting—Aliquots of cell lysates were electrophoresed through a 10 (PKC) or 12% (p44/42 MAPK) SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then transferred onto Immobilon-P polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). After the transfer, the membranes were incubated for 4 h at room temperature in the blocking buffer TBST (20 mm Tris, 136 mm NaCl, 0.1% and Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat dry milk to eliminate nonspecific binding. The membranes were washed several times and then incubated in TBST containing 5% bovine serum albumin at 4 °C overnight with the following antibodies: a monoclonal antibody against MMP-1 or MMP-3; a phosphospecific monoclonal MAPK antibody recognizing p44/42 MAPK phosphorylated at Tyr-204 and Thr-202; or a polyclonal p44/42 MAPK antibody or a polyclonal antibody against each of the PKC isozymes (α, βI, βII, γ, δ, ϵ, η, ζ, θ, ι, and μ). The membranes were washed again several times with TBST and incubated with the appropriate anti-mouse or anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody in TBST with 5% bovine serum albumin for 30 min at room temperature. Finally, the membranes were washed in TBST and Tris-buffered saline, and the protein bands were detected with the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent substrate according to the manufacturer's instructions and exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR films. Down-regulation of PKC with TPA—Cultured HF cells in 100-mm plates were starved and pretreated with or without TPA (1 μm) for 24 h to down-regulate PKC. They were treated with or without BCP crystals (50 mg/ml) for 15 min. The cells were also treated with PDBu (200 nm) and DAG (1 mm), both of which were used as positive controls for the BCP crystal stimulation of PKC. After cell lysis, aliquots of the lysates with equal protein concentrations were electrophoresed through a 10 (for PKC) or 12% (for phospho-p44/42) SDS-polyacrylamide gel, subjected to Western blotting, and probed with antibodies against PKCα, PKCμ and phospho-p44/42. Treatment of HF Cells with Sense and Antisense Oligodeoxynucleotides—An 18-base-long phosphorothioated antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) against PKCμ mRNA and its corresponding sense ODN were synthesized by Sigma. The antisense sequence for PKCμ was 5′-GACCGGAGGGGCGCTCAT-3′ based on the start codons (ATG) plus the 15 additional downstream bases in the human PKCμ sequence (22Johannes F.-J. Prestle J. Eis S.

L. 1998; 333: 719-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The corresponding sense sequence, 5′-ATGGCTGACGTTTACCCG-3′, was used as the control. As previously reported (31Fleming I. MacKenzie S.J. Vernon R.G. Anderson N.G. Houslay M.D. Kilgour E. Biochem. L. 1998; 333: 719-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), semi-confluent HF cells in 100-mm plates were treated with or without 20 μm ODN, 20 μg/ml Lipofectin for 6 h at 37 °C. The cells then were washed, and the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 2 mm glutamine and 10% heat-inactivated FBS and in the presence or absence of 20 μm ODN and without Lipofectin at 37 °C for 72 h. After these steps, the cells were treated with or without BCP crystals (50 μg/ml) for 15 min (for PKCμ and phospho-p44/42) and 24 h (for MMP-1 and MMP-3). The lysates then were assessed for immunoreactive PKCμ, phospho-p44/42, MMP-1, and MMP-3 protein levels by Western blotting and for PKCμ, MMP-1, and MMP-3 mRNA levels by RT-PCR. Inhibition of BCP Crystal-induced PKCμ and Phospho-p44/42 Activation—HF cells were cultured, starved, and preincubated with or without PKCμ inhibitor H-89 (100 μm) and phospho-p44/42 inhibitor U0126 (10 μm) for 30 min before the addition of BCP crystals (50 mg/ml) and PDBu (200 nm), which was used as a positive control for PKCμ activation. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti PKCμ, and the immune complex was used to determine PKCμ activity by autophosphorylation assay. Autophosphorylation of PKCμ—After cell lysis and immunoprecipitation with anti-PKCμ, the immune complexes were washed several times with the lysis buffer and then with the phosphorylation buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Autophosphorylation was started by adding 30 μl of the phosphorylation buffer containing 0.3 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (5000 Ci/mmol and 10 mCi/ml) and l-α-phosphatidyl-l-serine (100 μg/ml) to the immunocomplexes and incubating at 37 °C for 20 min (23Van Lint J.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The reactions were terminated by adding an equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer to each one. The proteins were released by boiling for 5 min, resolved by electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. The 32P-labeled proteins were visualized after a 4-hour exposure to autoradiography. p44/42 MAPK Activation—Following experimental treatments, cell lysis, and immunoprecipitations, aliquots of the cell lysates or immunoprecipitates were subjected to 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting with a monoclonal antibody specific for the activated and phosphorylated p44/42 MAPK (phospho-p44/42) and a polyclonal antibody specific for the constitutive and nonactivated p44/42. Statistics—Statistical analysis was performed with the Student's t test in Sigma Plot scientific graphing software, and p < 0.05 was considered significant. Data were expressed as the means ± S.E. Expression of PKC Isozymes in HF—Because the expression and interactions of the PKC isozymes are cell type-specific (33Jaken S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), we sought to determine the specific PKC isozymes expressed in HF upon BCP crystal (50 μg/ml) stimulation. By Western blotting, we show in Fig. 1 that, of all the conventional isozymes (A–D), only the α isozyme (A) is expressed as previously reported (13Reuben P.M. Brogley M.A. Sun Y. Cheung H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 277: 15190-15198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (58) Google Scholar). None of the novel (E–H) or atypical (I–J) isozymes is expressed. However, of the PKD family, PKCμ is highly expressed (K). These results indicate that both PKCα and PKCμ may have specific and distinct functions in the HF. The concentration of BCP crystals (50 μg/ml) used in these studies is consistent with our previously established optimal range of 50–100 μg/ml in vitro and is consistent with the in vivo concentration in articular joint fluids isolated from osteoarthritic patients, which range from 10 to 20 μg/ml, depending on the severity of the disease (34Cheung H.S. Ryan L.M. Woessner J.F. Howell D.S. Joint Cartilage Degradation: Basic and Clinical Aspects. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1993: 209-223Google Scholar). Role of PKC in the BCP Crystal Stimulation of Phospho-p44/42—Down-regulation of PKC is often used to determine its role in MAPK activation. Pretreatment of αT3-1 cells with TPA had been shown to down-regulate PKCα and PKCϵ with no effects on ERK 1 (p44) (35Sundaresan S. Colin I.M. Pestell G. Jameson J.L. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 304-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To determine the roles of PKCα and PKCμ in the BCP crystal activation of phospho-p44/42 in HF, the cells were pretreated with TPA (1 μm) for 24 h to down-regulate the PKCs before stimulation with BCP crystals (50 μg/ml). Fig. 2 shows that pretreatment with TPA (+) completely depleted PKCα (A) but affected neither the expression of PKCμ (B) nor the stimulation of phospho-p44/42 by BCP, PDBu, and DAG (C) in lanes 5–8 compared with their respective controls that were not pretreated with TPA (–) in lanes 1–4. These results were further proof of our previous work that the PKCα and the p44–42 MAPK signal transduction pathways in response to BCP crystal stimulation in HF are independent of each other (13Reuben P.M. Brogley M.A. Sun Y. Cheung H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 277: 15190-15198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, the results do not exclude the fact that PKCμ and phospho-p44/42 may share a common pathway in which the stimulation of phospho-p44/42 may be dependent upon the expression and/or activation of PKCμ. BCP Crystal Stimulation of Phospho-p44/42 Is Dependent upon PKCμ—Since it was suggested in Fig. 2 that PKCμ and phospho-p44/42 might share a common signal transduction pathway, the ideas that the two pathways were indeed related and/or one pathway was dependent upon the other were tested by treating the BCP crystal and PDBu-stimulated cells with the inhibitors of the two pathways in Fig. 3. The PKCμ inhibitor used, H-89, is a competitive ATP antagonist previously regarded as a highly specific inhibitor of protein kinase A (36Chijiwa T. Mishima A. Hagiwara M. Sano M. Hayashi K. Inoue T. Naito K. Toshioka T. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5267-5272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it had been reported that PKCμ had an ∼60-fold higher sensitivity to H-89 than the other PKCs and that it required 60 μm H-89 to inhibit PKCμ autophosphorylation in A549 carcinoma cell line (25Johannes F.-J.

We have previously demonstrated that the efficiency of the protective effect of MT-III against the DNA degradation from oxidative damage was much higher than that of MT-I/II. As an extension of the latter investigation, this study aimed to assess the ability of MT-III to suppress 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG), which is one of the major base lesions formed after an oxidative attack to DNA and the mutant frequency of the HPRT gene in human fibroblast GM00637 cells upon exposure to γ-rays. We found that human MT-III expression decreased the level of 8-oxoG and mutation frequency in the γ-irradiated cells. Using an 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1)-specific siRNAs, we also found that MT-III expression resulted in the suppression of the γ-radiation-induced 8-oxoG accumulation and mutation in the OGG1-depleted cells. Moreover, the down-regulation of MT in human neuroblastoma SKNSH cells induced by MT-specific siRNA led to a significant increase in the 8-oxoG level, after exposure to γ-irradiation. These results suggest that under the conditions of γ-ray oxidative stress, MT-III prevents the γ-radiation-induced 8-oxoG accumulation and mutation in normal and hOGG1-depleted cells, and this suppression might, at least in part, contribute to the anticarcinogenic and neuroprotective role of MT-III.

Bull. 2001; 15: 133-145Crossref Scopus (363) Google Scholar). In both mice and humans, there are four classes of quite similar MT proteins, MT-I to MT-IV. MT-I and MT-II are widely expressed in all tissues, whereas MT-III and MT-IV are expressed mainly in the central nervous system and the squamous epithelia, respectively (3Waalkes M.P. Klaassen C.D.

Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5844-5857Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas much is known about the chemical properties and genetic regulation of MT, the actual physiological role of MT is largely unknown. The first recognized function of MT is the detoxification of heavy metals such as cadmium and mercury (8Kagi J.H.R. Vallee B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 3460-3465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Durnam D.M. Palmiter R.D. Experientia Suppl. 1987; 52: 457-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Subsequently, a number of cellular functions have been proposed for MT, including regulating essential metal homeostasis (10Jacob C. Maret W. Vallee B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), and protecting against radiation and oxidative damage (14Cai L. Satoh M. Tohyama C. Cherian M.G.

Interact. 1998; 111–112: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The role of MT in oxidative damage has been aggressively investigated, and the vast majority of studies show that MT is a potent antioxidant that protects against various oxidative damage from reactive oxygen species (ROS) in vitro and in vivo because of their multiple cysteines. In vitro up-regulation of MT has been correlated with resistance to cytotoxicity induced by various hydroxyl radical generators, and the rate constant of MT for a reaction with hydroxyl radicals is more than 100× higher than that of glutathione (16Chubatsu L.S. Meneghini R. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 17Mello-Filho A.C. Chubatsu L.S. Meneghini R. Biochem.

In addition, MT is 50× more effective in protecting DNA from hydroxyl radicals than glutathione on a molar basis (22Miura T. Muraoka S. Ogiso T. Life Sci. 1997; 60: 301-309Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In vivo, the induction of MT expression by different stress associated with oxidative injury is consistent with MT functioning as an antioxidant (23Shiraishi N. Yamamoto H. Takeda Y. Kondoh S. Hayashi H. Hashimoto K. Aono K. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1986; 85: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 24Koropatnick J. Leibbrand M. Cherian M.G. Radiat.

Pharmacol. 1991; 110: 347-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). MT-III, the brain-specific member of MT family, was discovered as an inhibitory neuronal growth factor that appeared at lower levels in Alzheimer's disease brains (4Uchida Y. Takio K. Titani K. Ihara Y. Tomonaga M. Neuron. 1991; 7: 337-347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, 26Yu W.H. Lukiw W.J. Bergeron C. Niznik H.B. Fraser P.E. Brain Res. 2001; 894: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of this inhibition and the physiological significance of MT-III are not clear. MT-III regulation has been studied in a number of animal models of brain damage (27Hozumi I. Inuzuka T. Hiraiwa M. Uchida Y. Anezaki T. Ishiguro H. Kobayashi H. Uda Y. Miyatake T. Tsuji S. Brain Res. 1995; 688: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 28Yamada M. Hayashi S. Hozumi I. Inuzuka T. Tsuji S. Takahashi H. Brain Res. 1996; 735: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar); such studies have suggested that this MT isoform is involved in reparative and/or protective processes in the brain. Moreover, it has been recently shown that mice deficient in MT-III are more susceptible to seizures induced by kainic acid and exhibit greater neuronal injury than normal mice, and transgenic mice containing elevated levels of MT-III were more resistant to neuronal injury (29Erickson J.C. Hollopeter G. Thomas S.A. Froelick G.J. Palmiter R.D. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1271-1281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that MT-III could play a neuroprotective role; however, the mechanisms underlying such a protective role have not been fully known. In view of the proposed protective role of MT as a free radical scavenger, MT may also have relevance in brain neurological diseases. Therefore, MT-III, which is a unique protein, requires further study to define its antioxidant nature and its involvement in neuroprotection. ROS-induced damage to cellular macromolecules has been implicated in the etiology of cancer and aging as well as in other human diseases (30Hogg N. Semin. Reprod. Endocrinol. 1998; 16: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Among the oxidative lesions, 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) is one of the major base lesions formed after an oxidative attack to DNA (31Cadet J. Berger M. Douki T. Ravanat J.L. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 131: 1-87PubMed Google Scholar). Relatively large quantities of 8-oxoG are produced in mammalian cells, either as a byproduct of the normal oxidative metabolism or as a result of the exogenous sources of ROS, such as ionizing radiation (32Wood M.L. Dizdaroglu M. Gajewski E. Essigmann J.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7024-7032Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). 8-oxoG preferentially mispairs with adenosine during replication and thereby gives rise to G:C to T:A transversion mutations (33Cheng K.C. Cahill D.S. Kasai H. Nishimura S. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 166-172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the relative abundance and potent mutagenicity, 8-oxoG is believed to represent a major source of ROS-induced mutagenesis in all aerobic cells. The cellular damage caused by radiation is mainly oxidative damage as a result of the formation of several types of ROS including hydroxyl radicals and superoxide radicals by the radiolysis of water in cells (34Chapman J.D. Reuvers A.P. Borsa J. Greenstock C.L. Radiat. Res. 1973; 64: 291-306Crossref Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 35Roots R. Okada S. Radiat. Res. 1975; 64: 306-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). DNA is the presumed target of attack of either the primary radiolysis products of ionizing radiation such as hydroxyl radicals or secondary radicals, which are derived from the reactions of hydroxyl radicals with species in close proximity to the DNA (36Burkitt M.J. Gilbert B.C. Free Radic. Res. Commun. 1990; 10: 265-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). A number of reports have demonstrated that MT can protect against radiation-induced DNA damage (14Cai L. Satoh M. Tohyama C. Cherian M.G. Toxicology. 1999; 132: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Therefore, MT may be one of the most important defense mechanisms against ROS-induced mutagenesis, particularly those produced by irradiation. Supporting this hypothesis, several groups have found that a correlation exists between the elevated MT levels and the decreased number of mutations after exposure to oxidative stress (37Rossman T.G. Goncharova E.I. Mutat. Res. 1998; 402: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 38Rossman T.G. Goncharova E.I. Nadas A. Dolzhanskaya N. Mutat. Res. 1997; 373: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that the MT-III-expressing cells are highly protected from the ROS-induced DNA damage (39You H.J. Lee K.J. Jeong H.G. FEBS Lett. 2002; 521: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and that purified MT-III has the most efficient protective effect against hydroxyl radical-induced DNA single-strand breaks compared with that of MT-I/II (40You H.J. Oh D.H. Choi C.Y. Lee D.G. Hahm K.S. Moon A.R. Jeong H.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1573: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Based on these considerations, this study evaluated the protection provided by MT-III in γ-irradiated human fibroblast GM00637 cells. Attempts were made to determine whether or not MT-III expression could modulate the γ-irradiation-induced 8-oxoG accumulation and mutagenesis. The amount of 8-oxoG accumulation was determined using HPLC combined with an electrochemical detector, and the mutant frequency was determined by measuring the mutation frequency of the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) gene locus. This study demonstrates that MT-III expression can effectively inhibit the accumulation of 8-oxoG as well as suppress the mutant frequency of the HPRT gene after exposure to γ-irradiation in GM00637 cells. Most notably, this study demonstrates that MT-III expression leads to a reduction in the level of γ-ray-induced 8-oxoG formation and mutation in 8-oxoguanosine DNA glycosylase (OGG1)-depleted cells, which is the major repair enzyme of 8-oxoG. Finally, this study shows that a decrease in MT expression levels lead to a significant increase in 8-oxoG accumulation after exposure to γ-irradiation in human neuroblastoma SKNSH cells. These findings suggest that MT-III plays a critical role in the protection of γ-irradiation-induced 8-oxoG accumulation as well as in γ-irradiation-induced mutation in normal and hOGG1-depleted cells. Maintenance of Cell Lines—The human fibroblast GM00637 cells (Coriell Institute for Medical Research) and human neuroblastoma SKNSH cells (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in Earle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units of penicillin/ml, and 100 μg of streptomycin/ml (Invitrogen). Cells were maintained in 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C in a humidified incubator. Preparation of Constructs and Clones—Constructs of the human MT-III, MT-I, and MT-II are described elsewhere (39You H.J. Lee K.J. Jeong H.G. FEBS Lett. 2002; 521: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 40You H.J. Oh D.H. Choi C.Y. Lee D.G. Hahm K.S. Moon A.R. Jeong H.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1573: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Human OGG1 (hOGG1) cDNA, was amplified by RT-PCR using the hOGG1 oligo primer (5′-ATGCCTGCCCGCGCGCTTCTGCC-3′, 5′-CTAGCCTTCCGGCCCTTTGGAAC-3′) from human fibroblast GM00637 cells. After confirming the DNA sequence, the hOGG1 cDNA was cloned into a pcDNA3 mammalian expression vector, which was driven by the CMV promoter (Invitrogen). The transfections were performed using the LipofectAMINE method (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After transfection, cells were incubated with complete medium containing 400 μg/ml G418 for 5 weeks. The cell clones resistant to G418 were isolated and analyzed. Irradiation of Cells with γ-Rays—Cells were seeded into 100-mm diameter tissue culture dishes and allowed to attach for a period of 16.24 h at 37 °C. Cells were then irradiated on ice with various γ-ray doses (0–100 Gy) using a γ cell irradiator (Clonac 600C; Linac) at a dose rate of 0.96 Gy/min. The control cells were subjected to a similar treatment but without the irradiation. After irradiation, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested for the various measurements. LDH Activity Measurement—After cells were irradiated on ice with 50 or 100 Gy of γ-rays, culture medium was collected. Total LDH activity was determined by spectrophotometry using the LDH kit (Sigma). A total of 100 μl of supernatant were used to estimate LDH activity by measuring the oxidation of NADH at 340 nm. Extinction was recorded at 340 nm for 2 min. The results were expressed as international units of enzyme activity per liter of medium (units/liter). Production and Purification of the Human Metallothionein-III Antibody—Polyclonal antibodies were produced by immunizing New Zeal- and White rabbits with conjugated with bovine serum albumin and a synthetic peptide (CKGEEGAKAEAE) corresponding to residues 51–62 of human MT-III. A cysteine residue was attached to the N terminus of the peptide to introduce an SH group for coupling. Approximately 500 μg of the conjugated peptide in Freund's complete adjuvant (Sigma) were intradermally injected into two New Zealand White rabbits, followed by boosting the conjugate in Freund's incomplete adjuvant (Sigma) four times at 2-week intervals. Two weeks after the final boost, the serum was harvested, the immunoglobulin was purified using protein A-agarose (Oncogene), and serum was collected. Specific antibodies were prepared from the antiserum by affinity column chromatography using the peptide antigen (CKGEEGAKAEAE) coupled to SulfoLink Coupling Gel (Pierce). Western Blotting—Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed at 0 °C for 30 min in a lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 2 mm EGTA, 50 mm glycerol phosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μ/ml aprotinin, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 5 mm NaF). The protein content was determined using a dye-binding microassay (Bio-Rad), and 20 μgof protein per lane were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels after boiling for 5 min in a Laemmli sample buffer. The proteins were blotted onto Hybon ECL membranes (Amersham Biosciences). The markers (MBI) were used as size standards. After electroblotting, the membranes were blocked with Tris-buffered saline with Tween-20 (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20) containing 5% milk, and were incubated with the anti-hOGG1, α-tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and MT-I/II (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) and MT-III antibodies diluted in a blocking buffer for 4 h. The primary antibody dilutions were those recommended by the manufacturer. The membranes were then washed, incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies (1:4,000) in a blocking buffer for 2 h, and repeatedly washed again. The blotted proteins were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (iNtRON Biotech, Seoul, Korea). Semiquantative Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction— RNA extraction was conducted using the RNA-STAT-60 according to the manufacturer's instructions (TEL-TEST, Inc., Friendswood, TX). Briefly, after homogenizing cells in the RNA STAT-60, the homogenate was mixed with chloroform (5:1, v/v), shaken vigorously for 15 s, and then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The RNA present in the upper colorless aqueous phase was precipitated by adding isopropyl alcohol, which was washed twice with 70% ethanol and then air-dried for 10 min. The RNA was then resuspended in DEPC. 10-μl RNA aliquots were prepared and stored at –70 °C until needed. 2 μg of the total RNA was reverse-transcribed using a M-MLV cDNA synthesis system (Promega), and the reverse-transcribed DNA was subjected to PCR. The profile of the replication cycles was denaturation at 94 °C for 50 s, annealing at 58 °C for 50 s, and polymerization at 72 °C for 1 min. In each reaction, the same amount of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as the internal control. The primers used for the PCR are as follows: hOGG1 forward, 5′-CTG CCT TCT GGA CAA TCT TT-3′; hOGG1 reverse, 5′-TAG CCC GCC CTG TTC TTC-3′ designed to amplify a 551-bp region; hMT-III forward, 5′-TCA CTG GCA GCA GCT GCA CTT CTC-3′; hMT-III reverse, 5′-ATG GAC CCT GAG ACC TGC CCC TGC-3′ designed to amplify a 207-bp region; hMT-I forward, 5′-ATG GAT CCC AAC TGC TCC TG-3′; hMT-I reverse, 5′-ACT TCT CCG ATG CCC CTT-3′ designed to amplify a 227-bp region; hMT-II forward, 5′-ATG GAT CCC AAC TGC TCC TG-3′; hMT-II reverse, 5′-AGC TGC ACT TGT CCG ACG-3′ designed to amplify a 175-bp region; GAPDH forward, 5′-CCA TGG AGA AGG CTG GGG-3′; and GAPDH reverse 5′-CAA AGT TGT CAT GGA TGA CC-3′ designed to amplify a 194-bp region (total number of cycles: 26). The PCR products were resolved on 1% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide, and then photographed. siRNA—Sequence information regarding the human OGG1 and MT-III mRNA was extracted from the NCBI Entrez nucleotide data base. Three target sites within the human OGG1 and MT-III genes were chosen from the human OGG1 and MT-III mRNA sequences (GenBank™ accession no. AF003595 and NM_005954, respectively). Following selection, each target site was searched with NCBI BLAST to confirm specificity only to the human OGG1 and MT-III. The sequences of the 21-nucleotide sense and antisense RNA are as follows: hOGG1-siRNA1, 5′-GUAUGGACACUGACUCAGAUU-3′ (sense) and 5′-UCUGAGUCAGUGUCCAUACUU-3′ (antisense) for the hOGG1 gene (nt 185–205); hOGG1-siRNA2, 5′-GUACUUCCAGCUAGAUGUUUU-3′ (sense) and 5′-AACAUCUAGCUGGAAGUACUU-3′ (antisense) for the hOGG1 gene (nt 292–312); human MT-siRNA, 5′-AUGCACCCUCCUGCAAGAAGUU-3′ (sense) and 5′-CUUCUUGCAGGAGGGUGCAUUU-3′ (antisense) for the human MT gene (nt 148–168); LacZ siRNA, 5′-CGUACGCGGAAUACUUCGAUU-3′ (sense), 5′-AAUC GAAGUAUUCCGCGUACGUU-3′ (antisense) for the LacZ gene. These siRNAs were prepared by a transcription-based method using a Silencer siRNA construction kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions. LacZ siRNA was used as a negative control. Cells were transfected with the siRNA duplexes by using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). 8-oxoG Glycosylase Activity Assay—Cells at the exponential phase were centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min. The cell pellets (106 cells per each assay) were then suspended in 2 volumes of a homogenization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, and 0.05% 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5) and homogenized. The homogenates were mixed with streptomycin (final concentration: 1.5%) to remove nucleic acids. The supernatants obtained by centrifugation were dialyzed extensively against the homogenization buffer and used as cell extracts for the endonuclease nicking assay. 8-oxoG-containing the 21-mer with the sequence 5′-CAGCCAATCAGTXCACCATTC-3′ (X = 8-oxoG) and its complementary strand were chemically synthesized (The Midland Certified Reagent Co., Midland, TX). The oligonucleotides were 3′-end-labeled using terminal transferase and [α-32P]ddATP (Amersham Biosciences, 3000 Ci/mmol). The end-labeled oligomer was annealed with its complementary oligonucleotide, and the resulting duplex DNA was used as the assay substrate. The duplex substrate DNA (20 pmol) was incubated with the cell extracts (10 μg of protein) at 37 °C for 1 h in 1 ml of the reaction mixture (50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm KCl, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5). The reaction was terminated by heating at 90 °C for 3 min. The reaction products were electrophoresed on 20% denaturing (7 m urea) polyacrylamide gels (DNA sequencing gel). The gels were wrapped in saran wrap and exposed to film (Kodak) for visualization. Analysis of 8-oxoG in the Cellular DNA—The 8-oxoG levels in the DNA of cells were measured using a slight modification of a method described elsewhere (41Lee M.R. Kim S.H. Cho H.J. Lee K.Y. Moon A.R. Jeong H.G. Lee J.S. Hyun J.W. Chung M.H. You H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9857-9866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cellular DNA was isolated using a DNA extractor WB kit (Wako, Osaka, Japan). 50 μg of the isolated DNA were digested with 2 units of nuclease P1 (Roche Applied Science) in a 100-μl solution containing 1 mm EDTA and 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.5). The nucleotide solution was filtered with an Ultrafree-Probind filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and a 20-μl aliquot of the sample was injected into an HPLC column (YMCPack ODS-AM, 5 m, 4.6 × 300 mm) equipped with an electrochemical detector (ECD) (Coulochem II; ESA, Chelmsford, MA) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The mobile phase consisted of 12.5 mm citric acid, 25 mm sodium acetate, 30 mm NaOH, and 10 mm acetic acid containing 3% methanol. dG (Sigma) and 8-oxoG (Cayman Chemical Co., Ann Arbor, MI) were used as standards. The 8-oxoG level in the DNA was expressed as 8-oxoG/107 dG. Antioxidant Determinations—The cell lysates were prepared by repetitive freeze-thaw in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, and the proteins were extracted by successive freezing and thawing. The enzymatic measurements were performed on the 17,000 × g supernatant. The spectrophotometric catalase assay was performed using a slight modification of a procedure described elsewhere (42Beers R.F. Sizer I.W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1952; 195: 133-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Monitoring at a wavelength of 240 nm indicated a consumption of 20 mm H2O2 (25 °C). One unit is defined as 1 μmol of H2O2 consumed/min. The activities were normalized to the cell protein content. The data are reported as mean ± S.D. of triplicates. The total SOD (MnSOD and Zn/CuSOD) activity was measured by the ferricytochrome c assay according to a procedure derived from that described by Mccord and Fridovich (43Mccord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 224: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Briefly, the reduction rate of 20 μm ferricytochrome c was monitored at a wavelength of 550 nm in the presence of 100 μm hypoxanthine, 0.35 units of catalase and xanthine oxidase whose activity was adjusted to yield an absorbance change of <0.015/min in the absence of SOD (25 °C). One SOD unit is defined as the amount that reduces the ferricytochrome c reduction rate by 50%. The data, which were normalized to the cell protein content, represent the mean ± S.D. of triplicates. The glutathione peroxidase activity was assayed according to a slight modification of the procedure described elsewhere (44Flohe L. Gunzler W.A. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 114-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (4052) Google Scholar). The consumption rate of 0.15 mm NADPH at 37 °C was monitored at 340 nm in the presence of 0.07 units of glutathione reductase, 4 mm GSH, and 0.57 mmtert-BuOOH. One unit is defined as 1 μmol of NADPH consumed/min. The activities were normalized to the cell protein content. γ-Ray-induced HPRT Mutation Assay—The method used to determine the frequency of the γ-ray-induced HPRT mutants has been described (45Glaab W.E. Tindall K.R. Skopek T.R. Mutat. Res. 1999; 427: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were cultured in HAT medium (EMEM + 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μm hypoxanthine, 0.4 μm aminopterin, 16 μm thymidine) for at least 14 days to remove the existing HPRT mutants and were plated at 5 × 104 per 100-mm diameter dish. After γ-irradiation, cells were allowed another 12–14 days to express the HPRT mutants before plating in selective medium containing 30 μm 6-thioguanine (6-TG, Sigma). A separate set of cells was plated at a cloning density in a medium lacking 6-TG that was used to determine the cloning efficiency of cells at the time of selection. The mutant colonies were stained with 0.5% crystal violet in 50% methanol and scored after 12–14 days. For each dose and for the untreated control, the frequency of the mutants was calculated from the number of 6-TG-resistant colonies formed divided by the number of cells selected. This frequency was corrected for the cloning efficiency of cells at the time of selection. The induced frequencies were calculated by subtracting the background frequencies in the control population. MT-III Suppresses the Level of γ-Ray-induced 8-oxoG—In order to identify the potential role of MT-III in the accumulation of 8-oxoG, human MT-III was subcloned into the pcDNA3 vector, to form pcDNA3-MT-III. This construct was transfected into the human fibroblast GM00637 cells. Twelve stable transfected cell lines were established after selection using G418 for 5 weeks. Semiquantitative RT-PCR and Western blot analysis revealed that the MT-III expression levels in the three individual MT-III-transfected cells were significantly higher than that of the empty vector-transfected cells (Fig. 1, A and B). We also made MT-1- and MT-II-expressing cells to compare the inhibitory effect of MT-III on γ-radiation-induced 8-oxoG accumulation with MT-I and MT-II (Fig. 1, C and D). The effect of MT-III on γ-radiation-induced cellular toxicity was initially evaluated. Cells were exposed to 50 or 100 Gy of γ-rays. 12 h after treatment, the medium f"

The synthetic sphingolipid-like compound FTY720 is an immunomodulating agent in clinical trials for transplant graft maintenance. In this report, we compare the effects of the natural yeast sphingolipid phytosphingosine with FTY720 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that the multicopy suppressor genes that induce growth resistance to FTY720 also confer resistance to growth-inhibitory concentrations of phytosphingosine. In addition, mutants for ubiquitination pathway proteins are shown to be resistant to the growth-inhibiting effect of both FTY720 and phytosphingosine. We observe fewer similarities between sphingosine and FTY720 than between FTY720 and phytosphingosine as revealed by genetic studies. Yeast cells lacking the specific sphingosine kinase LCB4 are sensitive to phytosphingosine and FTY720 but resistant to sphingosine, suggesting that FTY720 and phytosphingosine have a more related mechanism of action. Gene expression profile comparisons of sensitive and resistant yeast cells exposed to FTY720 and phytosphingosine highlight a number of similarities. In response to treatment with these compounds, ∼77% of the genes that are regulated >2-fold by FTY720 also respond to phytosphingosine in the same direction in the parent strain. In addition, a close inspection of TAT1 and TAT2 transporters following exposure to phytosphingosine indicates that TAT1 protein is degraded in a similar fashion upon treatment with FTY720 and phytosphingosine. There were differences, however, with respect to the TAT2 protein level and the expression profiles of a subset of genes. The genetic, transcriptional, and biochemical data together indicate that FTY720 and phytosphingosine influence similar pathways in yeast cells. These findings offer further insights into the physiological pathways influenced by these compounds in all eukaryotic cells and help us to understand the therapeutic consequences of FTY720 in humans.

FTY720 is a synthetic compound attracting significant interest in the field of immune suppression. It is derived by chemical synthesis from myriocin, a natural metabolite isolated from the fungus Isaria sinclairii. Myriocin was shown previously to interfere with a key step of the sphingolipid biosynthesis pathway (1Horvath A. Sutterlin C. Manning-Krieg U. Movva N.R. Riezman H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3687-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), whereas FTY720 does not share this mechanism of action (2Chen J.K. Lane W.S. Schreiber S.L. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 221-235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In synergy with several conventional immunosuppressive drugs, FTY720 has shown strong graft protection in several animal models of transplantation (3Chiba K. Hoshino Y. Suzuki C. Masubuchi Y. Yanagawa Y. Ohtsuki M. Sasaki S. Fujita T. Transplant. Proc. 1996; 28: 1056-1059PubMed Google Scholar, 4Hoshino Y. Suzuki C. Ohtsuki M. Masubuchi Y. Amano Y. Chiba K. Transplant.

FTY720 treatment causes sequestration of circulating lymphocytes to the secondary lymph nodes and Peyer's patches (6Pinschewer D.D. Ochsenbein A.F. Odermatt B. Brinkmann V. Hengartner H.

Hengartner H. Zinkernagel R.M. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5761-5770Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Specific cellular mechanisms by which FTY720 may be mediating its effects are beginning to be elucidated. It was shown that the active in vivo metabolite of FTY720 is FTY720-phosphate (8Brinkmann V. Davis M.D. Heise C.E. Albert R. Cottens S. Hof R. Bruns C. Prieschl E. Baumruker T. Hiestand P. Foster C.A. Zollinger M. Lynch K.R. J. Biol.

FTY720-phosphate shares some structural homologies with mammalian sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) 1The abbreviations used are: S1P, sphingosine 1-phosphate; DHS, dihydrosphingosine; DMS, N,N-dimethylsphingosine; PHS, phytosphingosine.1The abbreviations used are: S1P, sphingosine 1-phosphate; DHS, dihydrosphingosine; DMS, N,N-dimethylsphingosine; PHS, phytosphingosine. and binds with high affinity to four of the five mammalian sphingosine 1-phosphate receptors (8Brinkmann V.

These receptors belong to the family of seven transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors. S1P is derived from the parent compound sphingosine through the action of sphingosine kinases in vivo. The precise mechanisms by which FTY720 or its metabolite FTY720-P mediates immunomodulation or associated effects are not known. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae produces a homolog to mammalian sphingosine called phytosphingosine (PHS), which is derived from the precursor dihydrosphingosine (DHS). Both PHS and DHS can be phosphorylated in S. cerevisiae by the sphingosine kinases LCB4 and LCB5 (10Nagiec M.M. Skrzypek M. Nagiec E.E. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19437-19442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The sphingoid base PHS has initially been demonstrated to be a specific inhibitor of yeast growth (11Skrzypek M.S. Nagiec M.M. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2829-2834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and the transport of several amino acids such as tryptophan, leucine, histidine, and uracil (12Chung N. Mao C. Heitman J. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35614-35621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). A full prototrophic strain was more resistant to PHS than a tryptophan auxotrophic strain (11Skrzypek M.S. Nagiec M.M. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2829-2834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). PHS was shown later to be involved in heat stress signaling via a mechanism involving a ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis in which the target for degradation was the uracil permease FUR4, and the ubiquitin enzymes were RSP5 and DOA4 (13Chung N. Jenkins G. Hannun Y.A. Heitman J. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17229-17232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). PHS was also demonstrated to be crucial for the internalization step of endocytosis in yeast, as indicated indirectly by a reduced uptake of radiolabeled α factor due to the internalization of the corresponding receptor after ubiquitination (14Zanolari B. Friant S. Funato K. Sutterlin C. Stevenson B.J. Riezman H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2824-2833Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that auxotrophic yeast strains are more sensitive to FTY720-mediated growth inhibition as compared with prototrophic strains. S. cerevisiae auxotrophic strains expressing multiple copies of tryptophan transporter genes such as TAT1 and TAT2 and the genes UBP5 and UBP11 (which specify proteases in the protein ubiquitination cascade) as well as the heat shock protein homolog gene CAJ1 are resistant to yeast growth inhibition mediated by FTY720 (15Welsch C.A. Hagiwara S. Goetschy J.F. Movva N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26976-26982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In addition, loss-of-function mutations in the ubiquitin structural protein UBI4, a reduction of ubiquitin ligase protein RSP5, the deletion of RSP5-binding protein BUL1, and a mutation of the glutamine transporter gene GNP1 also confer resistance to FTY720-mediated growth inhibition. We propose a model in which FTY720 influences the protein ubiquitination pathway and enhances specific protein degradation. Our observations indicate that FTY720 and PHS share multiple common properties and that amino acid transporters and the ubiquitin pathway play a significant role in reversing the growth inhibition mediated by these compounds. Because effectors of resistance to FTY720 also mediate resistance to PHS, we compared the gene expression profiles of yeast in response to these two compounds. We report that up to 535 of 705 (∼75%) open reading frames up-regulated by FTY720 are also up-regulated by PHS, and 415 of 521 (∼80%) down-regulated open reading frames are also in common. This indicates that PHS and FTY720 similarly affect the transcription of a broad set of genes. We have also measured the effects of N,N-dimethylsphingosine (DMS) and sphingosine on yeast strains and compared these with the effects mediated by PHS and FTY720. We show that, although the cellular responses to FTY720 and PHS are remarkably similar, there are significant differences between the effects of sphingosine and DMS. Overall, these results shed light onto the mechanism of action of FTY720 and highlight the differences and similarities between FTY720 and the endogenous mammalian and yeast sphingolipid molecules. Strains and Plasmids—The strains used in this study (listed in Table I) are isogenic to JK9-3d. All plasmids are as described previously (15Welsch C.A. Hagiwara S. Goetschy J.F. Movva N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26976-26982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Strains were maintained according to standard laboratory procedure (16Adams A. Gottschling D.E. Kaiser C. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998Google Scholar). Cultivation and maintenance of cells were carried out in YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% dextrose) medium or synthetic minimal medium supplemented with the appropriate nutrients for plasmid maintenance.Table IList of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains that were used in this study and their genotypeStrainGenotypeSource/ref.JK9-3dαhis4 leu2 trp1 ura3 MATα15Welsch C.A.

For solid medium, sphingolipid derivatives were added at the indicated concentration to the medium that had been autoclaved and cooled down to 50 °C together with 0.05% Tergitol (Nonidet P-40; Sigma) to increase the distribution of lipids in solid agar. Nourseothricin (Werner BioAgents) was solubilized to 200 mg/ml in water. Sensitivity Assay of Yeast Strains—To test the sensitivity of our strains to the different compounds, a small amount of cells from a single fresh colony was streaked using three different toothpicks. Plates were incubated for 2–3 days at 30 °C. The resistance of the strain was assessed by the formation of colonies in the presence of the compound. The growth inhibitory concentration of FTY720 had to be readjusted from 30 to 15 μm when we changed the batch of YPD medium (Difco). The concentration of 15 μm corresponds, as in our previous work (15Welsch C.A. Hagiwara S. Goetschy J.F. Movva N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26976-26982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), to the concentration at which the growth of JK9-3d parent strain is inhibited and the bul1Δ mutant is growth-resistant. Construction of Mutant Strains—The mutants were constructed using the PCR-based method as described (17Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2217) Google Scholar) with the pFA6a (G418) (17Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2217) Google Scholar), pAG25 (nourseothricin), and pAG32 (hygromycin) (18Goldstein A.L. McCusker J.H. Yeast. 1999; 15: 1541-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1340) Google Scholar) resistance-conferring plasmids. The oligonucleotides used for the PCRs were chosen 200–300 nucleotides upstream of the the start codon and ∼100 nucleotides beyond the stop codon of the different genes. Immunoblotting—The parent strain JK9-3d and the mutants JK9-3d bul1Δ, MH272-1d bul2Δ, and JK9-3d ubi4Δ were transformed with the vector pRS426 containing the HA-tagged TAT1 (pCAW15) or TAT2 (pAS55) gene. Transformed cells were grown to an early logarithmic phase and treated with 25 μm PHS for 1 h. Total proteins were extracted and quantified using a protein microassay (Pierce). 15 μg of total protein was loaded per well, and immunoblotting was performed as described previously (15Welsch C.A. Hagiwara S. Goetschy J.F. Movva N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26976-26982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The protein loading was checked by Coomassie Blue staining followed by quantitation. Tagged proteins were detected using a mouse anti-hemagglutinin antibody (clone 16B12; Covance). RNA Preparation and DNA Microarrays—Cells were grown overnight and adjusted to an A600 nm of 0.1 in 50 ml of YPD medium. They were then grown at 30 °C to an A600 nm of 0.4–0.5 and split into 7-ml aliquots. Each sample was performed in duplicate. Samples were incubated with either 15 μm FTY720 or 25 μm PHS for 1 h. In the control cultures, the compound was replaced by an equivalent volume of Me2SO. Total RNA was extracted from ∼4 × 107 total cells (duplicate of JK9-3d, duplicate of JK9-3d + FTY720, duplicate of JK9-3d + PHS, duplicate of bul1, duplicate of bul1 + FTY720, and duplicate of bul1 + PHS) using the RNeasy Mini kit from Qiagen following the manufacturer's instructions for the enzymatic lysis protocol. This procedure was repeated independently on two different days, and purified RNA was pooled. RNA quality was analyzed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. cDNA was synthesized from mRNA using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and a T7 oligo(dT)24 primer. Second strand cDNA synthesis was performed by incubating the cDNA product at 16 °C for 2 h with Escherichia coli DNA polymerase and an E. coli DNA ligase in the presence of E. coli RNase H (Invitrogen). cDNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol and precipitated with ammonium acetate. cRNA was synthesized from the double strand purified cDNA in the presence of a mixture of unlabeled ATP, GTP, CTP, UTP, and biotin-labeled UTP and CTP using the Enzo BioArray™ high yield RNA transcript-labeling kit and T7 RNA polymerase. Samples were purified using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). To prevent nonspecific binding, biotin-labeled cRNAs were fragmented by metal-induced hydrolysis. Fragmented cRNA was mixed with a hybridization mixture containing herring sperm DNA, control cRNAs, and bovine serum albumin. The hybridization mixture was hybridized to the S98 yeast chip from Affymetrix for 16 h with constant agitation. The yeast chips were washed three times and then stained. The signal was amplified with a streptavidin phycoerythrin antibody amplification step. Quality Control and Data Analysis—Hybridized chips were scanned with the Affymetrix scanner, and probe level fluorescence intensities were calculated with Microarray Suite version 5 software (Affymetrix). MAS5 data were uploaded into the Novartis proprietary data base DEMON. The Affymetrix quality control values for each chip were downloaded from DEMON. The quality of our gene chips was controlled using a set of parameters. A simplified table with summary statistics of Affymetrix quality features is presented (Table II).Table IIAffymetrix microarray quality informationMicroarrayJK9-3d (1)JK9-3d (2)JK9-3d + F (1)JK9-3d + F (2)JK9-3d + P (1)JK9-3d + P (2)bul1 (1)bul1 (2)bul1 + F (1)bul1 + F (2)bul1 + P (1)bul1 + P (2)AverageStddevNoise1.791.581.751.511.731.711.731.541.611.561.611.321.620.13Scaling factor0.810.840.460.560.60.470.420.530.520.490.480.790.580.15Background52.3447.0149.9644.2150.2552.9848.2344.4545.5648.3344.7639.5547.33.85Absent calls (A)1593140114131429158614021338142913371382131515121428.0891.52Present calls (P)760878047826777976157836787477837898784179067710779099.41Marginal calls (M)1341309612713497123123100112114113116.9213.81(P + M)/all calls (%)82.9484.9984.8684.6983.0184.9885.6784.6985.6885.285.9183.884.70.98BioB-3_at95.80 (P)90.70 (P)54.00 (P)55.10 (P)74.20 (P)83.50 (P)58.10 (P)128.30 (P)85.90 (P)114.70 (P)67.60 (P)94.60 (P)83.5423.3BioB-M_at166.00 (P)138.60 (P)77.90 (P)67.40 (P)89.90 (P)112.60 (P)97.00 (P)178.60 (P)100.50 (P)129.60 (P)86.10 (P)121.70 (P)113.8234.5BioB-5_at56.30 (P)56.10 (P)33.10 (P)36.30 (P)46.30 (P)40.00 (P)35.00 (P)64.50 (P)43.20 (P)58.10 (P)41.50 (P)54.60 (P)4710.55Ratio: 3′/5′ of BioB-X_at1.71.621.631.561.62.091.661.991.991.971.631.731.7650.188Ratio: 3′/M of BioB-X_at0.5770.6540.6930.8180.8250.7420.5990.7180.8550.8850.7850.7770.7440.099BioC-3_at175.80 (P)178.50 (P)95.60 (P)67.40 (P)112.80 (P)111.10 (P)104.30 (P)177.80 (P)123.40 (P)130.90 (P)103.30 (P)124.10 (P)125.4235.28BioC-5_at203.60 (P)192.50 (P)96.10 (P)78.70 (P)115.80 (P)114.20 (P)104.20 (P)211.80 (P)133.40 (P)151.40 (P)115.00 (P)143.10 (P)138.3243.64Ratio: 3′/5′ of BioC-X_at0.8630.9270.9950.8560.9740.97310.8390.9250.8650.8980.8670.9150.059BioDn-3_at1087.00 (P)1218.20 (P)685.20 (P)607.80 (P)918.50 (P)807.60 (P)794.50 (P)1148.10 (P)1069.50 (P)1138.20 (P)809.70 (P)989.20 (P)939.46198.22BioDn-5_at263.60 (P)284.70 (P)143.60 (P)114.30 (P)157.60 (P)165.20 (P)154.20 (P)228.00 (P)188.50 (P)209.90 (P)153.00 (P)189.60 (P)187.6850.78Ratio: 3′/5′ of BioDn-X_at4.124.284.775.325.834.895.155.045.675.425.295.225.0840.509CraX-3_at2937.40 (P)2826.80 (P)1472.10 (P)1566.80 (P)1937.80 (P)1974.40 (P)1907.40 (P)2467.10 (P)1766.40 (P)2424.90 (P)1628.00 (P)2182.50 (P)2090.97483.12CraX-5_at4411.70 (P)3664.90 (P)1645.10 (P)1264.60 (P)1595.30 (P)1844.30 (P)1712.90 (P)2883.70 (P)1512.60 (P)1926.40 (P)1292.10 (P)2033.00 (P)2148.88990.2Ratio: 3′/5′ of CraX-X_at0.6660.7710.8951.241.211.071.110.8561.171.261.261.071.0490.204 Open table in a new tab The first quality feature is the noise, which is a measure of the pixel to pixel variation on the array. Noise values are commonly seen between 1.5 and 3 for antibody amplified arrays. In the above set of experiments, the noise level is very low (∼1.5) and is consistent from array to array. A second quality feature is the scaling factor, which is the factor by which the average intensity of the array is multiplied to adjust it to a user-defined arbitrary intensity. In this study the scaling factors were consistent and very low (<1), indicating a good signal intensity. The background value indicates the background fluorescence, which is subtracted from all probe set intensities. The values of the above chips were consistently <50 (usually values should be <200). Finally, the percentage of the Affymetrix-defined present calls (compared with absent calls) was very high (∼80%) and very consistent between the different chips. The markers BioB, BioC, BioDn, and CreX (Table II) are spiked into the hybridization solution in increasing amounts, with BioB being the lowest, and, in general, the sensitivity of the array detection is considered good as long as BioC, BioDn, and CreX are detected as present. In the above set of experiments, BioB was already detected (present calls), suggesting a very good sensitivity. The absence of RNA degradation was checked by analyzing the fluorescence signal from probe sets against the 3′ or 5′ (or middle region) of the markers. Ratios (3′ to 5′ and 3′ to M) <3 are generally good. In this case, the ratios between the different probe sets were mostly ∼1, which is perfect. Data were exported pre-normalized (trimmed mean (top and bottom 2%) set to a constant value = 150) from DEMON (MAS5 normalized option), including flags and p values. The data file was analyzed with the program GeneSpring version 5.0 (SiliconGenetics). A cut-off of 80 was set on raw data to eliminate low signal values that are hard to distinguish from the background but for which it is easy to have a high fold change. The GeneSpring default per chip normalization to the 50th percentile was applied to the fluorescence values. Microarray data were analyzed by comparing the expression values obtained from treated samples with values from untreated samples. Data were filtered based on the fold change between the samples with a fold change factor set to 2 combined with a Welch t test with a p value <0.005. Validation of Gene Chips Results by Real Time PCR—21 genes from the gene chips analysis were selected for confirmation by reverse transcription PCR (including seven from the supplementary data available on the on-line version of this article). Genes were selected from all experimental samples. In all cases, the nature of the changes (increase, decrease, or no change) was confirmed by real time PCR (Table III). We have used two different RT-PCR methods as described below. In one set of experiments, 1 μg from each total RNA sample was reverse transcribed with 0.05 μg/ml oligo(dT) (Pierce) using the Oligoscript kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. TaqMan PCR was performed in triplicate as described in the user's manual (Applied Biosystems) using 20 ng of template cDNA, 900 nm primers, 225 nm probes, and 2× TaqMan Universal PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems). The housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as internal reference to normalize for the amount of total RNA in each sample. Alternatively, 500 ng to 1 μg from each total RNA sample was reverse transcribed using a high capacity cDNA archive kit (Applied Biosystems) following the manufacturer's instructions. SYBR Green PCR was performed in duplicate following the manufacturer's protocol using 10–20 ng of cDNA, 900 nm primers, and SYBR Green PCR core reagents (Applied Biosystems). 18 S ribosomal RNA was used as endogenous control. Each sample was run with the ABI 7900 (Applied Biosystems). The following calculation, shown in Equation 1, was used to determine relative expression.Table IIIReal time PCR confirmation of gene expression changes observed by Affymetrix microarray analysesGenesSamplesExpression tendencyFold change gene chipsFold change RT-PCRAGP2JK9-3d FTY720/PHSUp-regulated+2.5+4.6AMS1Bul1 ± PHSUp-regulated+6.0+4.9BEM2JK9-3d FTY720/PHSDown-regulated-1.3-2.6BRX1JK9-3d ± PHSDown-regulated-3.3-2.1CCT2Bul1 ± FTY720Down-regulated-2.3-25.8CHA1JK9-3d ± FTY720Unchanged+1E-01+6E-02COX5BJK9-3d ± PHSUp-regulated+7.1+13.5ERV25JK9-3d FTY720/PHSDown-regulated-1.3-4.0GCD7JK9-3d ± FTY720Unchanged-8E-02-2E-03GDH3JK9-3d ± FTY720Up-regulated+2.1+2.5GDH3JK9-3d ± PHSUp-regulated+2.3+8.0GIC2JK9-3d FTY720/PHSDown-regulated-2.1-3.8HOC1Bul1 ± PHSDown-regulated-3.3-1.9IMD3JK9-3d ± FTY720Down-regulated-2.8-4.3LCB1JK9-3d ± FTY720Down-regulated-2.3-3.9RME1JK9-3d ± FTY720Up-regulated+4.5+11.0RSA3JK9-3d ± FTY720Down-regulated-4.2-2.5SHR3Bul1 + FTY720/PHSUnchanged-6E-02+8E-02SIP18Bul1 ± FTY720Up-regulated+13.6+44.0UBP11Bul1 ± FTY720Down-regulated-3.4-1.4URA7JK9-3d ± FTY720Down-regulated-4.7-3.8VSP33JK9-3d FTY720/PHSDown-regulated-1.3-3.0 Open table in a new tab Other Methods—Yeast was transformed using a LiOAc procedure (19Gietz R.D.

Here we show that each of these overexpressing strains and mutants are also resistant to a 25 μm concentration of PHS (Figs. 1 and 2).

https://openalex.org/W2099454617,"Previous studies using whole-cell recording methods suggest that human B lymphocytes express an amiloride-sensitive, sodium-permeable channel. The present studies aim to determine whether this channel has biophysical properties and a molecular structure related to the α, β, and γ subunits of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and Northern blots showed that human B lymphocytes express messages for both α- and β- but not γ-ENaC. Western blots showed that both α- and β- but not γ-ENaC proteins are expressed and strongly reduced by antisense oligonucleotides. Patch clamp experiments demonstrated that lymphocyte sodium channels are not active in cell-attached patches. However, membrane stretch can activate a 21-pS nonselective cation channel. The frequency of observance of this channel was significantly reduced by antisense oligonucleotide against α-ENaC but not by antisense oligonucleotide against β-ENaC, indicating that only the α subunit of ENaC is necessary to form stretch-activated cation channels. Aldosterone (1.5 μm) reduced the frequency of observance of 21-pS α-ENaC channels and simultaneously induced the appearance of spontaneously active 10-pS channels. Antisense oligonucleotide experiments showed that this 10-pS channel is formed from α- and β-ENaC. After expression of exogenous γ-ENaC, aldosterone again reduced the frequency of observance of the 21-pS α-ENaC channel but induced the appearance of a 5-pS channel, presumably a αβγ-ENaC channel. In the absence of aldosterone, the α subunit forms an α-cryptic channel that is activated by stretch, and in the presence of aldosterone, β and α subunits together form an active channel that is modulated by aldosterone.

ENaC, itself, is usually associated with sodium transport across the apical membrane of a variety of epithelia including the colon, lung, and kidney. Since 1994, when ENaC was initially cloned from rat colon (1Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1994; 367: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar), the biophysical properties and molecular structure of ENaC have been studied extensively. Several lines of evidence suggest that ENaC, including human ENaC (hENaC), is typically composed of three subunits, α, β, and γ, and that all three subunits are required to form a functional αβγ-ENaC channel complex (1Canessa C.M.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 344-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). In heterologous expression systems, maximal expression of the hENaC channel requires co-expression of all three subunits (7McDonald F.J. Price M.P. Snyder P.M. Welsh M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1157-C1163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8McDonald F.J. Snyder P.M. McCray Jr., P.B. Welsh M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: L728-L734Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and in oocytes, expression of α-ENaC cRNA alone produces little expression of any amiloride-sensitive currents. However, in other cell types, expression of the exogenous α-ENaC subunit alone can form a stretch-activated nonselective cation channel (9Kizer N. Guo X.L. Hruska K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1013-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), and a similar nonselective cation channel has also been described in native lung epithelial alveolar type II cells (10Jain L. Chen X.J. Brown L.A. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: L475-L484PubMed Google Scholar, 11Marunaka Y. Niisato N. O'Brodovich H. Eaton D.C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 515: 669-683Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 12Yue G. Russell W.J. Benos D.J. Jackson R.M. Olman M.A. Matalon S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8418-8422Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This lung cation channel appears to be formed from α-ENaC alone and is equally permeable to Na+ and K+, is sensitive to steroid hormones, and has a higher unit conductance (21 pS) than that of αβγ-ENaC (4-5 pS) (13Jain L. Chen X.J. Malik B. Al-Khalili O. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L1046-L1051Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Jain L. Chen X.J. Ramosevac S. Brown L.A. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: L646-L658Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggest that the α-ENaC subunit alone under the correct conditions is able to form a channel. But the biophysical properties of this channel are different from those of the ENaC channel complex formed by all three subunits, α-, β-, and γ-ENaC. Results from whole-cell recordings show that an amiloride-sensitive conductance is expressed in human B lymphocytes (15Achard J.M. Bubien J.K. Benos D.J. Warnock D.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C224-C234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Bradford A.L. Ismailov I. Achard J.M. Warnock D.G. Bubien J.K. Benos D.J. Am. J.

However, whether this channel is related to ENaC remains to be determined by single-channel and biochemical experiments. Therefore, in the present study, cell-attached recordings were performed in human B lymphocytes to characterize the amiloride-sensitive, Na+-permeable channel at a single-channel level. Reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR, Northern blotting, and Western blotting experiments were also carried out to determine whether human B lymphocytes express ENaC subunits. Thereafter, antisense oligonucleotide methods were used to determine which ENaC subunit was involved in forming the lymphocyte Na+-permeable channel. In addition, we determined how steroid hormones regulate the expression of this channel. We found that human B lymphocytes express a stretch-activated channel apparently formed from α-ENaC alone. When the cells were exposed to aldosterone, the frequency of observance of this channel decreased, and the frequency of observance of a 10-pS channel increased. The 10-pS channel was apparently composed of α and β subunits. When exogenous γ-ENaC subunit was transfected into lymphocytes, aldosterone induced a 5-pS channel which appeared to be composed of α, β, and γ subunits and was indistinguishable from the channels in sodium-transporting epithelial tissues. Cell Culture—Human B lymphocytes (the Daudi cell line) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. The cells were continuously cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) by incubator in which the temperature was set at 37 °C with a constant CO2 of 5%. Patch Clamp Techniques—Immediately before use, human B lymphocytes were thoroughly washed with NaCl bath solution (see “Chemicals and Solutions” below) and transferred into the patch recording chamber mounted on the stage of a Leitz inverted microscope. Whole-cell and cell-attached configurations were established with polished micropipettes with a tip resistance of 2.5-5 megohms. Only patches with a seal resistance above 10 gigohms were used for the experiments. In whole-cell recordings, a voltage-ramp protocol from -120 mV to +60 mV at a holding potential of -60 mV was used to quickly obtain the current-voltage relationship. After the characterization of macroscopic currents by whole-cell recordings, single-channel analysis was also done in the cell-attached mode. For cell-attached experiments, the fraction of patches with channel activity was used to estimate the channel density as described previously (13Jain L. Chen X.J. Malik B. Al-Khalili O. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L1046-L1051Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Jain L. Chen X.J. Ramosevac S. Brown L.A. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: L646-L658Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RT-PCR and Northern Blotting—RT-PCR of total RNA obtained from human B lymphocytes was carried out with subunit-specific primers designed according to published sequences for human ENaC. PCR reactions were run in the linear range of amplification with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase amplified as the standard for comparison and to establish equal starting amounts of message. These primers amplified a single fragment of the expected size for each RNA (346 bp for the α subunit of human ENaC (α-hENaC), 520 bp for β-hENaC, or 624 bp for γ-hENaC). The PCR products were not seen in control reactions without RNA. The primers specific for each subunit did amplify plasmid DNA for the target subunit but did not amplify plasmid DNA for any other subunits. The sequences of the amplified fragments were identical to the published sequences. To confirm the results from RT-PCR, Northern blotting experiments were also performed using subunit-specific probes for α-, β-, and γ-hENaC subunits. Preparation of Antisense and Sense Oligonucleotides to α-, β-, and γ-hENaC—Oligonucleotides either complementary (for antisense) or identical (for sense) to α- (first 22), β- (first 23), and γ-hENaC (first 23) sequences beginning with the initiation codon AUG were synthesized as the phosphothiorate oligonucleotides by the Emory University Micro-chemical Facility. The sequences were: α sense, 5′-TAC CAG GTC TCA TGG AGG GGA A-3′; α antisense, 5′-TTC CCC TCC ATG AGA CCT GGT A-3′; β sense, 5′-CAG GTG CCA CTA TGC ACG TGA AG-3′; and β antisense, 5′-CTT CAC GTG CAT AGT GGC ACC TG-3′. A BLAST search of the GenBank™ data base revealed no similarity of these oligonucleotide sequences with sequences of other Na+ channels and only limited similarity of these oligonucleotides between each ENaC subunit. The cells were pretreated with serum-free medium containing either 10 μm antisense or sense oligonucleotides to either the α- or β-ENaC subunit for 24 h. In some experiments, the culture medium contained 10% fetal bovine serum plus aldosterone to determine the effect of aldosterone. In those experiments, the oligonucleotides were repeatedly added into the culture medium every 6 h to ensure that they remained present at a significant concentration. Transfection of Human B Lymphocytes with γ-ENaC—The rat γ-ENaC in the pSport vector, provided by Dr. Bernard C. Rossier (University of Lausanne, Switzerland), was subcloned into pcDNA3.1 vector. The cells were transiently transfected with this plasmid DNA of rat γ-ENaC by using LipofectAMINE™ plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's specifications. The day before transfection, the cells were split into 25-cm2 flasks with a resulting density of 106 cells in each flask on the next day. γ-ENaC DNA was diluted with serum-free medium (1 μg of DNA/50 μl of medium), mixed with Plus™ reagent, and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. LipofectAMINE™ reagent was then diluted with serum-free medium (1 μl of LipofectAMINE™/25 μl of medium), mixed with the DNA/Plus™ reagent, and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The transfection solution containing DNA, Plus™ reagent, and LipofectAMINE™ reagent was added to the cells. After incubation of the cells at 37 °C for 6 h, the transfection solution was replaced with regular medium, and the cells were incubated for 24-48 h before patch clamp experiments. Chemicals and Solutions—Chemicals were obtained from Sigma and Research Biochemicals International. The NaCl bath solution for cell-attached experiments contained (in mm): 145 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, and 10 HEPES, at a pH of 7.4. The KCl bath solution contained (in mm): 145 KCl, 5 NaCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, and 10 HEPES, at a pH of 7.4. The pipette solution for whole-cell recordings contained: 140 mm KCl, 5 mm NaCl, 50 nm free Ca2+ (after titration with 2 mm EGTA), 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm K2-ATP, and 10 mm HEPES, at a pH of 7.2. For cell-attached recordings, NaCl bath solution without or with 100 μm quinine (a K+ channel blocker) was used for filling patch pipettes. Statistical Analysis—Data were reported as mean values ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed with SigmaPlot and SigmaStat software (Jandel Scientific). Paired or unpaired t tests were used to determine the statistical significance between the two groups. Analysis of variance was used for multiple comparisons. For comparing proportions (e.g. the fraction of patches expressing cation channels in the presence or absence of antisense oligonucleotides), we used a z test. Results were considered significant if p < 0.05. There Is No Spontaneously Active Na+-permeable Channel Activity in Human B Lymphocytes—Previous studies from whole-cell experiments suggest that human B lymphocytes, especially from patients with Liddle's syndrome, appear to express an amiloride-sensitive, sodium-permeable conductance (17Bubien J.K. Watson B. Khan M.A. Langloh A.L. Fuller C.M. Berdiev B. Tousson A. Benos D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8557-8566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 18Bubien J.K. Warnock D.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C1175-C1183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the amiloride-sensitive whole-cell current exhibited substantial fluctuations and was observed only when the cell membrane was strongly hyperpolarized. However, in single-channel recordings, there has been no evidence for channels consistent with these properties; therefore, the exact nature of the amiloride-sensitive, rapidly fluctuating whole-cell currents observed in human B lymphocytes remains unclear. The apparent increase in whole-cell current in Liddle's syndrome and the amiloride sensitivity of the current have suggested to some investigators that the lymphocyte current might be related to epithelial sodium channels (ENaC); however, the observation that the biophysical characteristics are so different from the properties of ENaC in epithelial cells or when ENaC subunits are expressed in oocytes has cast doubt on this hypothesis. In the present study, both whole-cell and single-channel recordings were performed in human B lymphocytes to detect any possible ENaC activity. Consistent with our previous report (19Zhou Z.H. Unlap M.T. Li L. Ma H. J. Membr. Biol. 2002; 188: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), only outward K+ currents (but not any inward currents) were recorded as shown by a representative whole-cell recording from a total of 118 experiments (Fig. 1A). Although flickery inward currents were occasionally observed when the cell membrane was hyperpolarized to -140 mV or below, the flickery inward currents were never observed at any membrane potential above -140 mV. Consistent with the results from whole-cell experiments, single-channel recordings also demonstrated that no inward channel events were observed in 98 of 106 cell-attached patches. A representative cell-attached recording is shown in Fig. 1B. Only eight cell-attached patches had inward single-channel events. However, the channel events appeared only immediately after patch formation and disappeared within 30 s. Although the patch membrane was stretched when forming a patch, we hypothesized that these channel events, which were observed in less than 10% of cell-attached patches, might be activated by stretch. Membrane Stretch Activates a 21-pS Nonselective Cation Channel—To test the above hypothesis that human B lymphocytes express a stretch-activated channel, a negative pressure was applied to the patch pipette in the cell-attached mode, which was usually established immediately after releasing the gentle positive pressure (1-2 cm H2O) applied to the patch pipette before the pipette was lowered into the bath. In some cases, a very gentle negative pressure (<2 cm H2O) was required to form a good seal, which was immediately released after forming the cell-attached mode, and these patches were allowed a few minutes for the patch membrane to recover from the stretch that was applied to form the seal. We found that application of negative pressure to the patch pipette induced significant inward channel events in cell-attached patches when the patch pipette contained 145 mm Na+. To determine ion selectivity, ion substitution experiments were performed. The replacement of Na+ with NMDG+ in the pipette eliminated the channel events, indicating that the channel is a cation channel (Fig. 2A). However, the channel events remained when Na+ in the patch pipette was replaced with K+, and the replacement did not shift the reversal potential, suggesting that this cation channel is nonselective for Na+ over K+ (PNa/PK = 1/1). Similar to stretch-activated channels observed in other tissues, the channel had a linear I-V relationship with a unitary conductance of ∼21 pS (Fig. 2B). However, the channel activity was blocked with 10 μm amiloride (Fig. 2C). Human B Lymphocytes Express the Messages for the α and β Subunits of ENaC—Previous studies have demonstrated that expression of exogenous α-ENaC results in a stretch-activated cation channel (9Kizer N. Guo X.L. Hruska K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1013-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, we hypothesized that α-ENaC may be involved in forming the stretch-activated cation channel observed in human B lymphocytes. To test whether human B lymphocytes express α-, β-, and γ-ENaC subunits, RT-PCR experiments were performed by using subunit-specific primers, which amplify ENaC subunits from human kidney. Similar to observation by others (17Bubien J.K. Watson B. Khan M.A. Langloh A.L. Fuller C.M. Berdiev B. Tousson A. Benos D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8557-8566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), the data demonstrated that α (346 bp) and β (520 bp), but not γ (624 bp), were amplified in human B lymphocytes (Fig. 3A), indicating that messages for α- and β-ENaC subunits was present in human B lymphocytes. To further confirm the results from RT-PCR experiments, Northern blotting experiments were performed using subunit-specific probes for ENaC subunits. Consistent with the results from RT-PCR experiments, the data demonstrated that α- and β-ENaC subunits were detected as multiple bands, but γ is undetectable (Fig. 3B). Human B Lymphocytes Express α- and β-ENaC Subunit Protein, and Antisense Oligonucleotides Can Knock Down the Expression of the Subunits—Fig. 4 shows that lymphocytes contain detectable amounts of α- and β-ENaC subunit protein. There is, however, no detectable γ-ENaC. Fig. 4 also shows that the expression of both α- and β-ENaC protein can be inhibited with appropriate antisense oligonucleotides but is unaffected by sense oligonucleotides. Antisense Oligonucleotide against α-ENaC Eliminates the Stretch-activated Cation Channel—In lung alveolar type II cells, 21-pS nonselective cation channels are formed from α subunit protein alone or in combination with some subunit other than β and γ (13Jain L. Chen X.J. Malik B. Al-Khalili O. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L1046-L1051Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Jain L. Chen X.J. Ramosevac S. Brown L.A. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: L646-L658Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To further determine whether the 21-pS stretch-activated cation channel in lymphocytes is formed by α-ENaC alone or α-ENaC in combination with β-ENaC, human B lymphocytes were treated with antisense or sense oligonucleotides to either α- or β-ENaC sequences (see “Materials and Methods”). The experiments were performed in three sets; each set contained five groups in which the cells were under control conditions or treated with antisense or sense oligonucleotides to either α- or β-ENaC, respectively. Under control conditions, the 21-pS stretch-activated channel was recorded in ∼75% of cell-attached patches (n = 23). After treatment with antisense oligonucleotide to α-ENaC, only 33% of cell-attached patches (n = 2) contained the stretch-activated channel. In contrast, 69% of cell-attached patches (n = 13) contained the stretch-activated channel when the cells were treated with sense oligonucleotide to α-ENaC. The cation selectivity of the 21-pS channel in these experiments was also determined by ion substitution experiments as described in the legend to Fig. 2, showing that PNa/PK is 1/1. Compared with either control experiments or sense treatment, antisense oligonucleotide to α-ENaC significantly reduced the frequency of observance of the stretch-activated channel (p < 0.01). In other words, the channel density in the cell membrane was decreased after treatment with antisense oligonucleotide to α-ENaC, indicating that α-ENaC is necessary to form the stretch-activated channel. However, the frequency of observance of the stretch-activated channel was unaffected by treatments with either antisense (n = 16) or sense oligonucleotide (n = 14) to β-ENaC. Representative cell-attached recordings from each group experiment are shown in Fig. 5A. The summary percentages of each group from three sets of experiments are also shown in Fig. 5B. These data together suggest that α-ENaC (but not β-ENaC) is necessary to form the 21-pS stretch-activated cation channel in human B lymphocytes. Aldosterone Activates a 10-pS Sodium-permeable Channel, Which Can Be Blocked by Antisense Oligonucleotides to Both α- and β-EnaC—The above experiments suggest that α-ENaC (but not β-ENaC) is necessary to form the 21-pS stretch-activated cation channel in human B lymphocytes despite the fact that RT-PCR and Northern blotting experiments suggest that β-ENaC message is present in human B lymphocytes. However, in epithelial cells, β-ENaC appears to act as an auxiliary subunit to regulate ENaC activity and trafficking to the plasma membrane (20McDonald F.J. Yang B. Hrstka R.F. Drummond H.A. Tarr D.E. McCray Jr., P.B. Stokes J.B. Welsh M.J. Williamson R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1727-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 21Cui Y. Su Y.R. Rutkowski M. Reif M. Menon A.G. Pun R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9962-9966Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 22Awayda M.S. Tousson A. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1889-C1899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the data from other investigators have shown that aldosterone has no chronic effect on the expression of β-ENaC in rat kidney (22Awayda M.S. Tousson A. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1889-C1899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Masilamani S. Kim G.H. Mitchell C. Wade J.B. Knepper M.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar), our results have shown that aldosterone stimulates expression of β-ENaC in A6 cells (24Malik B. Schlanger L. Al-Khalili O. Yue G. Eaton D.C. FASEB J. 2002; 16 (abstr.): A477Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that the α-ENaC channel in human B lymphocytes is regulated by aldosterone via expression of the β subunit. Human B lymphocytes were treated with 1.5 μm aldosterone for 6 h before performing cell-attached recordings. As we described in Figs. 1 and 2, under control conditions in the absence of aldosterone, there was no apparent spontaneous 21-pS α-ENaC-associated channel activity in Daudi B cells, even though nonselective channel activity was observed after application of stretch in 17 of 23 patches (74%). Interestingly, in 20 patches on aldosterone-treated lymphocytes, the stretch-activated 21-pS α-ENaC channel was not observed; however, in 12 of the 20 patches (60%), aldosterone induced a 10-pS channel that spontaneously opened and closed without requiring stretch activation. This channel activity was also blocked by 5 μm amiloride. Therefore, we hypothesized that this 10-pS channel might be related to the stretch-activated α-ENaC channel. To test this hypothesis, human B lymphocytes were treated with antisense and sense oligonucleotides to α-ENaC to determine whether the treatments affect the aldosterone-induced channel activity. Under control conditions, the 10-pS channel induced by aldosterone was observed in ∼60% of cell-attached patches (n = 20). Treatment with antisense oligonucleotide to α-ENaC significantly reduced the frequency of observance of the 10-pS channel from 50% (sense control, n = 15) to 14% (antisense, n = 15) (p < 0.05), indicating that α-ENaC is not only necessary to form the stretch-activated 21-pS α-ENaC channel but is also necessary to form the aldosterone-induced 10-pS channel. Interestingly, the frequency of observance of the 10-pS channel in cell-attached patches was also significantly reduced after treatment with antisense oligonucleotide to β-ENaC from 55% (sense control, n = 13) to 20% (antisense, n = 20), suggesting that β-ENaC is also necessary to form the aldosterone-induced, 10-pS channel. Representative cell-attached recordings of each type of experiment are shown in Fig. 6A. Fig. 6B shows that the 10-pS channel had a linear I-V relationship. To determine cation selectivity of the 10-pS channel, ion substitution experiments were performed. The replacement of Na+ with NMDG+ in the pipette eliminated the channel events, indicating that the channel is a cation channel. The replacement of Na+ with K+ in the pipette shifted the reversal potential from 61 mV to 34 mV. Using the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation, the calculated sodium-to-potassium permeability ratio PNa/PK was 3.2/1. After treatment with antisense oligonucleotides to β-ENaC, the frequency of observance of the channels was reduced; however, the selectivity and conductance of the channels that remained were unaffected; i.e. they were still 10 pS with a selectivity of about 3 to 1. This implied to us that even though α-ENaC protein was still present, the cells did not express at measurable levels the 21-pS α-only channels (although we could not rule out the possibility of low level expression or the possibility that we would have to stretch the membranes to observe the channel). This selectivity is similar to that for a 10-pS amiloride-sensitive channel originally described in a renal cell line, A6 (25Hamilton K.L. Eaton D.C. Membr. Biochem. 1986; 6: 149-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The summary percentages of each group from three sets of experiments are shown in Fig. 6C. Aldosterone Induces a 5-pS Amiloride-sensitive Sodium Channel after Expression of Exogenous γ-EnaC—Epithelial cells that express all three ENaC subunits, α, β, and γ, usually express a 5-pS highly selective amiloride-sensitive channel. In contrast, B lymphocytes that do not normally express the γ subunit, as one might expect, do not express such channels. However, because lymphocytes express the α subunit and, in the presence of aldosterone, the β subunit, we thought that if we expressed the exogenous γ subunit in lymphocytes, we might observe the 5-pS αβγ-ENaC channel. Therefore, we transfected human B lymphocytes with the γ subunit of rat ENaC. Unfortunately, expression of exogenous γ-ENaC in the absence of aldosterone failed to induce any spontaneous ENaC-like channel activity. However, in the presence of 1.5 μm aldosterone, exogenous γ-ENaC induced spontaneous inward single-channel events (Fig. 7A). The I-V relationship inwardly rectified and had a unitary conductance of 5 pS when the cell membrane was hyperpolarized (Fig. 7B). To determine ion selectivity, ion substitution experiments were performed. The replacement of Na+ with NMDG+ in the pipette eliminated the channel events, indicating that the channel is a cation channel. The replacement of Na+ with K+ in the pipette shifted the reversal potential to the left. This shift implies that the 5-pS channel has PNa/PK > 20:1; i.e. that the 5-pS channel is highly selective for Na+ over K+. The mean open time was reduced by 1 μm amiloride (Fig. 7C) from 512 ± 126 ms to 76 ± 14 ms (p < 0.01) (Fig. 7D). It has been known for a number of years that under whole-cell recording conditions, human B lymphocytes have an amiloride-sensitive Na+ current (15Achard J.M. Bubien J.K. Benos D.J. Warnock D.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C224-C234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Bradford A.L. Ismailov I. Achard J.M. Warnock D.G. Bubien J.K. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C601-C611Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Bubien J.K. Watson B. Khan M.A. Langloh A.L. Fuller C.M. Berdiev B. Tousson A. Benos D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8557-8566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 18Bubien J.K. Warnock D.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C1175-C1183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the molecular basis for the current remains controversial because the whole-cell currents rapidly fluctuate in a manner unlike ENaC currents in other cells, and they are detectable only when the lymphocyte membrane is strongly hyperpolarized. To address this issue, in the present study we performed both whole-cell and cell-attached experiments. In whole-cell recordings, as we expected, we did not observe any inward currents in cells that were not strongly hyperpolarized (Fig. 1A). We did observe inward currents when the cells were repeatedly stimulated with a hyperpolarizing stimulus of -140 mV or below (data not shown). Similar to the current observed by others (18Bubien J.K. Warnock D.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C1175-C1183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), this hyperpolarization-associated current contains large rapidly fluctuating currents. Therefore, it is likely that the open state of the “cryptic” Na+-permeable channel in human B lymphocytes is not very stable but is activated by hyperpolarization. Although it can also be activated by physical stretch, the ratio of “cytoplasmic” (patch pipette) osmolarity versus “extracellular” (bath) osmolarity may affect the channel as well and may explain the discrepancy between our work and some previous reports. Consistent with our whole-cell data, single-channel recordings showed that there was no spontaneous Na+-permeable channel activity in cell-attached patches (Fig. 1B). Although a nonselective cation channel was observed after stretching the patch membrane, the channel was equally permeable to Na+ or K+ with a unitary conductance of 21 pS (Fig. 2). Despite the fact that a nonselective cation channel rather than the more typical highly selective 5-pS ENaC channel was observed, we speculated that one or more ENaC subunits might form the molecular basis for the nonselective cation channel. Consistent with another report (17Bubien J.K. Watson B. Khan M.A. Langloh A.L. Fuller C.M. Berdiev B. Tousson A. Benos D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8557-8566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), our results from RT-PCR, Northern blotting, and Western blotting experiments suggest that human B lymphocytes do contain the messages and protein for α- and β-ENaC subunits (Fig. 3 and 4). Using antisense oligonucleotide methods, we found that only α-ENaC but not β-ENaC is necessary to form the stretch-activated 21-pS Na+-permeable channel (Fig. 5). Further investigation will be required to determine why the β-ENaC subunit is not involved. Recent studies have demonstrated that ENaC is regulated by Nedd4, a ubiquitin protein ligase (26Debonneville C. Flores S.Y. Kamynina E. Plant P.J. Tauxe C. Thomas M.A. Munster C. Chraibi A.

Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 809-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In A6 cells, a proteosome inhibitor strongly increases the cellular amount of β-ENaC but only causes a slight increase in α-ENaC protein (31Malik B. Schlanger L. Al-Khalili O. Bao H.F. Yue G. Price S.R. Mitch W.E. Eaton D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12903-12910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). These results suggest the possibility that degradation of the plasma membrane β-ENaC might be much faster than that of α-ENaC in human B lymphocytes; thus, leading to a situation in which, although there is message and protein for both α- and β-ENaC, only α-ENaC is present in the membrane at a high enough concentration to be the predominant channel-forming subunit. More experiments will be required to show how β-ENaC is regulated and trafficked in human B lymphocytes. One interesting finding of the present study was that aldosterone can induce 10-pS channels in human B lymphocytes. Unlike the 21-pS, presumably an α-only channel present in the absence of aldosterone, the aldosterone-induced channel spontaneously opens and closes at the resting membrane potential in cell-attached patches and was blocked by antisense oligonucleotides to either α- or β-ENaC (Fig. 6). These results suggest that the aldosterone-induced channel consists of, at least, α and β subunits. Another steroid, dexamethasone, is known to increase expression of β- and γ-ENaC protein levels in lung epithelial cells (32Lazrak A. Samanta A. Venetsanou K. Barbry P. Matalon S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C762-C770Crossref Google Scholar). Our earlier studies also suggest that aldosterone increases the mRNA level of β-ENaC and the protein level of γ-ENaC in A6 distal nephron cells (24Malik B. Schlanger L. Al-Khalili O. Yue G. Eaton D.C. FASEB J. 2002; 16 (abstr.): A477Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The concentration of aldosterone we used was high enough that it could have activated both mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptors. Regardless of the steroid receptor, we suggest that steroids like aldosterone may promote loss of the stretch-activated 21-pS α-ENaC channel and appearance of the 10-pS αβ-ENaC channel by increasing the membrane expression of β-ENaC protein. Our speculations about the nature of the channels were confirmed by the expression of exogenous γ-ENaC, which led to the formation of a “traditional” ENaC channel, at least in the presence of aldosterone. Interestingly, in the absence of aldosterone, only a 21-pS stretch-activated channel composed of α-ENaC alone was observed regardless of whether γ-ENaC was expressed. In conclusion, the single-channel properties and molecular structure of an amiloride-sensitive channel in human B lymphocytes are different from those of amiloride-sensitive channels in many epithelial cells. First, the channel is not spontaneously active. Second, it can be directly activated by membrane stretch unlike ENaC, which requires special conditions for stretch activation (33Ma H.P. Li L. Zhou Z.H. Eaton D.C. Warnock D.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: F501-F505Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Third, it has distinctive biophysical characteristics: a 21-pS unit conductance rather than 4-6-pS and no selectivity for Na+ over K+ rather than a Na:K selectivity of >40 to 1. These differences arise because the channel appears to be formed from α-ENaC subunits alone (or α-ENaC together with some other unidentified protein) rather than α, β, and γ subunits. Fourth, it has a lower sensitivity to amiloride than ENaC. These properties are consistent with a nonselective cation channel that has been described previously in lung epithelial alveolar type II cells (13Jain L. Chen X.J. Malik B. Al-Khalili O. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L1046-L1051Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Jain L. Chen X.J. Ramosevac S. Brown L.A. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: L646-L658Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in a cell expression system (9Kizer N. Guo X.L. Hruska K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1013-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Although lymphocytes do not transport Na+, the fact that the channel is silent under resting conditions may have physiological significance for maintaining lymphocytes in an inactive state. When lymphocytes are exposed to hypotonicity (to induce stretch) or steroid hormones, the channels can be activated. This characteristic may have pathophysiological significance for activating lymphocytes in either inflammatory or immunosuppressive states. Alternatively, steroids are often elevated (naturally or pharmacologically) under states when lymphocytes are activated, suggesting the possibility that the transition to the alternative channel presumably formed from α and β subunits of ENaC may be important in this process. Originally, amiloride-sensitive channels in lymphocytes were examined as a possible indicator of excessive ENaC activity that might be predictive of abnormalities in total body sodium balance and hypertension (15Achard J.M. Bubien J.K. Benos D.J. Warnock D.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C224-C234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Bradford A.L. Ismailov I. Achard J.M. Warnock D.G. Bubien J.K. Benos D.J. Am. J.

With the failure to easily observe amiloride-sensitive channels at a single-channel level in lymphocytes, some of the impetus for this approach was lost. However, the current work demonstrates the conditions under which channels associated with at least the α and β subunits of ENaC can be observed in lymphocytes. Therefore, the possibility of using lymphocytes as a diagnostic tool to examine functional mutations in α or β subunits that could lead to hypertension can be reconsidered."

Located on the mitochondrial inner membrane, this rate-limiting enzyme is also implicated in the production of reactive oxygen species under chemical/oxidative stress conditions and during ischemia/reperfusion injury (1Lee I.

The oligomeric complex consists of three large primarily catalytic subunits encoded by the mitochondrial genome and 10 smaller subunits encoded by nuclear genes (5Capaldi R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 569-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). The nuclear encoded subunits are thought to modulate enzyme function, although the precise structural or biochemical details remain unclear. The nuclear encoded COX Vb is a ubiquitously expressed subunit of the complex, although its level of expression in different tissues varies markedly, ranging from very low levels in liver to very high levels in skeletal and cardiac muscle. A previous study has shown that expression of the COX Vb mRNA is increased by 5–7-fold during myogenesis of C2C12 skeletal and H9C2 cardiac myocytes (6Basu A. Lenka N. Mullick J. Avadhani N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5899-5908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Recent studies also suggest a role for the COX Vb subunit in modulating the kinetic properties of the enzyme complex (4Vijayasarthy C. Damle S. Prabu S.K. Otto C.M. Avadhani N.G. Eur. J.

The structural organization and transcription regulation of a number of nuclear encoded COX genes from different mammalian sources have been characterized (8Suske G. Enders C. Schlerf A. Kadenbach B. DNA (N. Y.). 1988; 7: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 9Basu A. Avadhani N.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1087: 98-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 10Basu A.

Acta. 1991; 1089: 283-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). A common emerging theme among these and other mitochondrially destined oxidative phosphorylation genes is that a majority of them are positively regulated by transcription factors NRF1 and NRF2, the latter also known as GA-binding protein (13Thompson C.C. Brown T.A. McKnight S.L. Science. 1991; 253: 742-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), although some are modulated by more general factors such as YY-1 and Sp1 (14Evans M.J. Scarpulla R.C.

The regulation of murine COX Vb gene expression is particularly interesting since it involves an array of transcription factors, including tissue-specific or tissue predominant factors (10Basu A.

Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 380-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). First, the COX Vb mRNA shows extensive 5′ heterogeneity due to transcription initiation at multiple sites. Region –8 to +40 of the promoter contains at least five sites for protein binding, each functioning as a putative transcription start site. The initiation of RNA at position +1 has been shown to depend on YY-1 factor binding, and the site at position +17 is dependent on Ets family factor NRF2 binding (17Basu A. Park K. Atchison M.L. Carter R.S. Avadhani N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4188-4196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Sucharov C. Basu A. Carter R.S. Avadhani N.G. Gene Expr. 1995; 5: 93-111PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, expression of the COX Vb gene is subject to regulation by NRF1 and NRF2, which bind to the immediate upstream regions of the promoter (20Virbasius J.V. Virbasius C.A. Scarpulla R.C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 380-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Although the COX Vb gene is constitutively expressed, its transcription is induced 5–7-fold during induced differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts into myotubes (6Basu A. Lenka N. Mullick J. Avadhani N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5899-5908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Another characteristic of the COX Vb gene is the transcription suppressor activity of a DNA motif spanning sequence –481 to –320 of the promoter (6Basu A. Lenka N. Mullick J. Avadhani N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5899-5908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This sequence consists of four putative protein-binding motifs, including a G-rich motif (designated GTG), a motif showing partial consensus to YY-1 factor-binding sites Nuclear Factor E1′, a newly identified CAT-rich motif (designated CATR) showing no significant homology to previously described transcription factor-binding DNA motifs, and a cryptic serum response factor-binding CArG motif (ψCArG). Although the precise nature of individual protein-binding motifs is not known, a previous study from our laboratory showed that the suppressor region DNA binds to nuclear factors and yields multiple bands in gel mobility shift assays (6Basu A. Lenka N. Mullick J. Avadhani N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5899-5908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Furthermore, discrete differences in the antibody supershifts of DNA-bound complexes with nuclear extracts from undifferentiated and differentiated C2C12 myocytes and a markedly reduced repressor activity of the transcription suppressor motif in C2C12 myotubes suggest a role for this DNA motif in modulating transcription activity during myogenesis (6Basu A. Lenka N. Mullick J. Avadhani N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5899-5908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In this study, using a combination of mutational analysis and protein purification by DNA affinity chromatography, we found that the GTG motif and the downstream CATR motif are critical for the function of the transcription suppressor and for modulating its activity during myogenesis. The GTG motif bound a ubiquitously expressed 95-kDa factor (BERF-1/ZBP-89), whereas the downstream CATR motif bound either YY-1 or hnRNP-D (a homolog of the human JKTBP1 protein) exclusive of each other. Interestingly, a high negative modulation of COX Vb promoter activity in undifferentiated myocytes involved physical interaction of CATR motif-bound YY-1 with adjacently bound BERF-1/ZBP-89. In differentiated myotubes, the suppressor activity was reversed by hnRNP-D/hJKTBP1 protein binding to this site in place of YY-1 and its physical interaction with BERF-1/ZBP-89. These results show a new mechanism of transcription factor switching during induced skeletal myogenesis. COX Vb Promoter Constructs and cDNA Constructs—The mouse COX Vb promoter constructs used in this study were derived from the –481/+40 chloramphenicol acetyltransferase promoter DNA (6Basu A. Lenka N.

Lenka N. Mullick J. Avadhani N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5899-5908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded in 6-well culture plates 24 h prior to transient transfection. A ratio of 1 μg of DNA to 3 μl of FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) was used in all transfections. Cells were transfected in triplicates with wild-type or mutant COX Vb-luciferase reporter constructs (2.5 μg/well) and the pRL-SV40 plasmid (0.2 μg/well; Promega Corp.), which expresses Renilla luciferase, as an internal control. The luciferase activity was normalized by comparison with Renilla luciferase activity, which was used as an internal control. In cotransfection experiments YY-1, ZBP-89, and hJKTBP1 cDNA expression plasmids (0.5 μg each) were used along with different mutant or wild-type COX Vb promoter constructs. The cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer (0.1 m potassium phosphate (pH 7.8), 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mm EDTA) by continuous shaking at 4 °C for 15 min. The cell lysate was centrifuged in a microcentrifuge for 20 s to pellet large membranes and cell debris. Luciferase activity was measured using the Dual Luciferase assay system (Promega Corp.). Luciferase assays were performed with 10 μl of cell lysate in 100 μl of assay buffer. The luminometer was set for a 30-s integration period at high gain. Luciferase activities were normalized to Renilla luciferase activity, which was used as an internal control. The transcription rates are presented as relative luciferase activities. Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—Miniprep nuclear extracts were prepared from transfected C2C12 cells by the method of Schreiber et al. (23Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419-6424Crossref PubMed Scopus (3902) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Transfection was done using 1–2 μg of effector plasmid DNA/plate. Cells from five different plates (∼7–10 × 106 cells) were used to prepare nuclear extracts. Pooled cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in ice-cold buffer A (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm pepstatin, and 1 mm leupeptin). The cells were allowed to swell on ice for 15 min, lysed with 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and centrifuged. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and rocked on a mixer at 4 °C for 15 min. The nuclear extract was centrifuged, and the supernatant was frozen in aliquots and stored at –70 °C. Large-scale nuclear extracts from differentiated and undifferentiated C2C12 myoblasts were prepared by the method of Dignam et al. (24Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (9131) Google Scholar). Purification and Characterization of Negative Enhancer-binding Proteins—Nuclear extract (∼600 μg of protein) from fully differentiated C2C12 myocytes was subjected to (NH4)2SO4 fractionation. Protein fraction precipitating between 25 and 50% (NH4)2SO4 was enriched for DNA-binding proteins by heparin agarose chromatography (25Camasamudram V. Fang J.-K. Avadhani N.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1128-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 ml of heparin-agarose (Sigma) pre-equilibrated with buffer B (5 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 30 mm KCl, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 15% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml antipain) was mixed with extract in the same buffer by gentle rocking at 4 °C for 1 h. The mixture was poured into a 1-ml column, and unbound proteins were eluted by washing with 15 ml of buffer B. Protein fraction eluted with buffer B containing 0.5–1 m KCl (∼135 μg of protein) was pooled, dialyzed against buffer B, and used for DNA affinity chromatography. Region –481 to –391 of the negative enhancer DNA (∼40 μg) was conjugated to CNBr-activated Sepharose using a standard procedure (26Min C. Verdine G.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3806-3810Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The protein in 3 ml of buffer B containing 5% glycerol was incubated with 1 ml of DNA resin at 4 °C for 2 h by gentle rocking on a mixer, and the mixture was poured into a 0.8-cm diameter column. The column was washed with 20 ml of buffer B and the last 5 ml of wash was collected, concentrated, and used for analysis. The bound proteins were eluted sequentially with 3 ml each of loading buffer containing 200 mm, 400 mm, 600 mm, and 1 m KCl. The eluates were concentrated by centrifugation through Centricon filters (Amicon, Inc.) and used for electrophoresis. DNA-Protein Binding by Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Binding assays were carried out as described (27Singh H. Sen R. Baltimore D. Sharp P.A. Nature. 1986; 319: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar) using 5 μg of nuclear protein extract and 0.4 ng (10,000 cpm) of 32P-labeled gap-filled DNA probe. Competition for DNA binding was carried out as described (19Carter R.S. Bhat N.K. Basu A. Avadhani N.G. J. Biol.

Competitor DNA was preincubated with the reaction mixture for 15 min at 25 °C prior to the addition of the labeled DNA probe. Binding reactions were carried out for 25 min at 25 °C. For antibody supershift assays, 1–2 μg of preimmune IgG or antibody specific for YY-1, the GTG motif, or hJKTBP1 (hnRNP-D) was added to the reaction mixture and incubated for 20 min at 25 °C, followed by incubation with the added DNA probe as described above. Samples were electrophoresed on 4% polyacrylamide gels in 0.25× Tris/glycine/EDTA (1× Tris/glycine/EDTA = 25 mm Tris base, 100 mm glycine, and 1 mm EDTA) or 0.25× Tris/boric acid/EDTA (1× Tris/boric acid/EDTA = 89 mm Tris base, 89 mm boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA) at 160 V for 1.5 h. Gels were dried under vacuum and exposed to x-ray film overnight at –80 °C with intensifying screens. Preparation of Antibody to JKTBP1, the Human Homolog of Mouse hnRNP-D—The partially characterized expressed sequence tag cDNA clone encoding the human JKTBP1 protein was obtained from the Genome Systems Inc., fully sequenced, and submitted to the NCBI Protein Database (accession number AY453824). The 301-amino acid-long reading frame with an N-terminally added His8 tail was cloned into the pET-28a(+) vector (Novagen), expressed in Escherichia coli cells, and induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The protein was purified by affinity binding to Ni2+ chelate resin (29Porath J. Carlsson J. Olsson I. Belfrage G. Nature. 1975; 258: 598-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1733) Google Scholar) and used for raising polyclonal antibody in rabbits. Details of immunization, blood sampling, and titer determination were as described previously (30Parham P. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 92: 110-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The IgG-rich fraction was isolated by (NH4)2SO4 fractionation of serum proteins, and monospecific antibody was purified by affinity adsorption to Sepharose-conjugated hJKTBP1. Antibody Pull-down Assays—For testing the in vitro interaction, YY-1, ZBP-89, and hJKTBP1 cDNA constructs were used as templates for generating 35S-labeled in vitro translation products in a TnT coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega Corp.). The extent of 35S incorporation and the integrity of the translation products were verified by electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, followed by autoradiography. Co-immunoprecipitation was carried out as described by Anderson and Blobel (31Anderson D.J. Blobel G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Briefly, both ZBP-89 and YY-1 translation products were incubated in 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) at 30 °C for 20 min. The reaction mixture was then incubated with 2 μl (1 mg/ml) of anti-ZBP-89 antibody overnight at 4 °C. The immune complex was precipitated using protein A-agarose beads. The beads were washed five times (1 ml/wash) with 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.02% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 10 units/ml Nonidet P-40 and suspended in 2× Laemmli buffer. The proteins were identified by Western blotting using anti-YY-1, anti-hJKTBP1, and anti-ZBP-89 antibodies. For testing the in vivo interaction, co-immunoprecipitation was carried out as described (31Anderson D.J. Blobel G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) with nuclear extracts from transfected cells. The nuclear extract was also analyzed for the ectopic expression of ZBP-89, hJKTBP1, YY-1, and its mutants by Western blot analysis. Immunoblot Analysis—Proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking with 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline (20 mm sodium phosphate buffer) containing 0.3% Tween 20, the blots were incubated with the desired polyclonal antibody and developed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence using a Super-Glo chemiluminescence kit (Pierce) and visualized with a Bio-Rad VersaDoc chemiluminescence imager. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—Chromatin immunoprecipitation was carried out as described (32Orlando V. Strutt H. Paro R. Methods. 1997; 11: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Briefly, C2C12 myoblasts as well as myotubes (2 × 107 cells each) were cross-linked in growth medium (1.1% (v/v) formaldehyde, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)), and cross-linking was terminated with 0.125 m glycine. Nuclei were prepared and sonicated as described by Orlando et al. (32Orlando V. Strutt H. Paro R. Methods. 1997; 11: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar) with 15 pulses of 30 s each at 4 °C to obtain an average length of ∼0.5 kilobase pairs of DNA. Chromatin samples (0.6 units each at A260 nm) were subjected to immunoprecipitation with primary antibodies (2.5 μg of IgG); the antigen-antibody complexes were separated using protein A-coated beads; and both the immunoprecipitates and supernatant fractions were collected. Chromatin fractions were incubated at 65 °C for 16 h to reverse the cross-links, and DNA was extracted from both immunoprecipitated and non-precipitated supernatant fractions. DNA samples (20 ng in each case) were subjected to PCR amplification using the suppressor region-specific primers 5-GTTCGAGACTGCAGACAGCT-3′ (sense) and 5′-AACAGAGTGGAGGAGGGAAT-3′ (antisense). The PCR products were analyzed on 2% agarose gels. Mutational Analysis of the Upstream Negative Enhancer Region of the COX Vb Promoter—In our previous study, we showed that region –481 to –320 of the mouse COX Vb gene suppresses the transcription activity of a heterologous thymidine kinase-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase promoter (6Basu A. Lenka N. Mullick J. Avadhani N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5899-5908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This region is also responsible for the nearly 7-fold lower activity of the COX Vb promoter in undifferentiated myoblasts. Sequence comparison and protein binding properties of the ∼160-bp DNA from this region indicated the occurrence of four possible protein-binding motifs (designated upstream NFE1′, GTG, CATR, and ψCArG) (Fig. 1A). In this study, the role of these individual motifs in modulating the transcription activity of the promoter during myogenesis was tested by mutational analysis. As shown before (6Basu A. Lenka N. Mullick J. Avadhani N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5899-5908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), the transcription activity of the promoter construct increased by ∼7-fold in C2C12 cells induced to differentiate into myotubes compared with the activity in uninduced myocytes. Mutations targeted to the upstream NFE1′ and downstream ψCArG sites affected neither the activity of the promoter in uninduced myoblasts nor the inducibility of promoter activity in differentiated myotubes. However, mutations targeted to the GTG element reduced the promoter activity in both undifferentiated and differentiated myocytes, suggesting a functional role for this motif in modulating promoter activity. Mutations targeted to the CATR site caused a 2-fold increased activity in undifferentiated myoblasts, but a reduction in the overall transcription activity in myotubes. These results suggest that the CATR site may augment the suppressor activity in undifferentiated myocytes, whereas it may have an activator function in differentiated myotubes. These data suggest that the GTG and CATR sites are important for the differential activities of the suppressor element during myogenesis. The suppressor region DNA will hereafter be referred to as GTG/CATR DNA. Purification and Characterization of the Nuclear Proteins That Bind to GTG/CATR DNA—A previous study from our laboratory using a combination of gel mobility shift analysis and methylation interference analysis showed that the CATR motif binds to purified YY-1 protein under low off-rate conditions (6Basu A. Lenka N. Mullick J. Avadhani N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5899-5908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the nature of the proteins that bind to GTG/CATR DNA by DNA affinity chromatography. Since mutations in the ψCArG region had no effect on the transcription activity of the promoter (Fig. 1B), we used a 105-bp DNA segment spanning sequence –376 to –481 (Fig. 1A) for conjugating to CNBr-activated Sepharose. The (NH4)2SO4-fractionated nuclear extract from differentiated myotubes was first enriched for DNA-binding proteins by heparin-agarose binding and used for protein purification by DNA affinity chromatography. As shown in Fig. 2A, the protein fraction that eluted from the column with buffer containing 0.2 m KCl contained four distinct protein bands with apparent molecular masses of 95, 50, 41, and 39 kDa. The fraction that eluted with 0.4 m KCl contained three proteins, two of which comigrated with the 41- and 39-kDa species present in the 0.2 m KCl fraction. This fraction also contained an additional protein band at ∼36 kDa that was not seen in proteins that eluted with the 0.2 m KCl-containing buffer. On the other hand, the fraction that eluted with 0.6 m KCl contained the 41- and 39-kDa proteins and lacked significant 36-kDa species. Finally, the faction that eluted with 1 m KCl did not show any stainable proteins. Although not shown, use of DNA carrying mutated GTG sequence for affinity purification abolished the binding of all the proteins except the 36-kDa protein. On the other hand, mutation of the CATR site selectively abolished purification of the 36-kDa protein. N-terminal microsequencing of all four bands from the 0.2 m KCl-eluted fraction, three bands from the 0.4 m KCl-eluted fraction, and two bands from 0.6 m KCl-eluted fraction was carried out to gain insight into the nature of the proteins that bind to the suppressor DNA. Sequencing results yielded an identical N terminus of MNIDDKLEGLFKL- for the 95-kDa protein as well as the 50- and 39-kDa proteins from the 0.2 m KCl, 0.4 m KCl, and 0.6 m KCl elutes. In repeated attempts, the 41-kDa protein in all three fractions did not yield detectable sequence, suggesting a blocked N terminus. The 36-kDa protein that eluted with 0.4 m KCl yielded an N-terminal sequence of MEDMNEYSNIEEF-. Protein data base searching revealed that the 95, 50, and 39-kDa proteins belong to a previously reported family of zinc finger proteins, termed BERF-1/ZBP-89 (33Merchant J.L. Iyer G.R. Taylor B.R.

This ubiquitous transcription factor is expressed as intact 95–115-kDa and C-terminally truncated forms of 64, 56, 49, and 32 kDa in different cell types and species (33Merchant J.L. Iyer G.R.

These functions have been based primarily upon identified HCF-1-protein interactions and upon the pleiotropic phenotypes of cells containing a temperature-sensitive mutation in the amino terminal kelch domain of the protein.

Eisenman R.N. Herr W. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 896-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar)) have suggested that HCF-1 may be involved in global transcriptional regulation. In addition, cells containing the HCF-1 temperature-sensitive mutation in this domain arrest in G0-G1 cell-cycle stage after prolonged incubation at the nonpermissive temperature (19Goto H. Motomura S. Wilson A.C. Freiman R.N. Nakabeppu Y. Fukushima K. Fujishima M. Herr W. Nishimoto T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 726-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, other than the HSV IE genes, the regulatory targets have not been identified. While various genetic systems could be utilized to address these issues, HCF-1 appears to be essential for cell viability, general transcription, and cell-cycle progression. Approaches such as the generation of dominant negative mutants, ts mutants, or RNA interference-mediated depletion have inherent problems for the analysis of essential proteins including the resulting cell toxicity, the time frame for phenotypic effects to become evident due to protein turnover rates, and the difficulties in determining the primary effects of the mutation or depletion. Therefore, a system was developed to inducibly alter the specific localization of HCF-1 by sequestering the protein in the cell cytoplasm. This approach is reflective of the specific cytoplasmic sequestering of HCF-1 in sensory neurons, the single exception to the nuclear localization pattern of the protein in most cell types (30Kristie T.M. Vogel J.L. Sears A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1229-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This system produces a regulated shift in the nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio of HCF-1, exhibits low toxicity, and allows for the delineation of events that are critically dependent upon the levels of nuclear HCF-1. Using this approach, cytoplasmic sequestering of HCF-1 inhibited HSV IE gene expression, indicating the potential of the system for analysis of essential protein functions. In addition, transcriptional regulatory targets were identified that may account for the pleiotropic effects of the protein and also defines HCF-1 as a critical transcriptional component with impact on many basic regulatory processes. Plasmids—pHA-actin was constructed by insertion of an HA epitope tag and start codon (ATG) into the NheI-BglII sites of pEGFP-actin (Clontech). pHA-TIF-Act and pHA-TIFEH were constructed by insertion of the coding sequences for the αTIF-HCF-1 interaction domain (AKLDSYSSFTTSPSEAVMREHAYSRARTKNNYGSTIEGLLD) or mutant domain (AKLDSYSSFTTSPSEAVMRAAAYSRARTKNNYGSTIEGLLD) between the HA tag and the actin coding sequences in pHA-actin. The coding regions from pHA-actin, pHA-TIF-Act, and pHA-TIFEH-Act were subsequently ligated into pMEP4 (Invitrogen) to generate the respective metallothionein promoter controlled expression vectors. Cell Culture and Virus—Cell lines expressing the actin fusion proteins under the control of a metallothionein promoter were generated by transfection of HeLa cells with pMEP4 plasmids (Invitrogen) expressing either the HA-TIF EHAY motif-actin fusion protein (T-Act), HA-TIF EHAY mutant motif-actin fusion protein (TEH-Act), or HA-actin fusion protein (Act). Hygromycin B-resistant colonies were pooled and used for all experiments. HSV-1 (F) viral stocks were produced and titered by infection of Vero cells according to standard procedures. Immunofluorescence—Cells were plated on glass coverslips and 4 μm CdSO4 was added for various defined time periods. The cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100. The expressed fusion proteins and HCF-1 were detected with anti-HA monoclonal antibody (mHA.11, Covance) and anti-HCF-1 antibody (Ab2131 (3Kristie T.M. Pomerantz J.L. Twomey T.C. Parent S.A.

Actin was detected using Texas Red-X phalloidin (Molecular Probes). Confocal images were obtained using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica TCS-SP2) equipped with a 63× PL Fluotar objective, a 488 nm argon-ion laser, and a 568 nm krypton-ion laser. The images from 488 and 568 nm channels were collected independently and merged using the accompanying software. For quantitation of the HCF-1 fluorescence, polygons were drawn around the entire cell and the nucleus using the accompanying Leica software and the fluorescence values of each were obtained. The HCF-1 fluorescence in the cell cytoplasm was determined by subtracting the nuclear fluorescence values from those of the entire cell. Immunoblot Analysis—Cells were lysed in buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate) and protein concentrations were determined by Bio-Rad assay (Bio-Rad). Equivalent amounts of protein were resolved in Tris-glycine gels, transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore), and probed with antibodies to ICP4 (HIA021, Virusys Corp.), HA (mHA.11, Covance), ELK1 (sc-355, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), MCM2 (sc-9839, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), c/EBPβ (sc-150, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), ARF6 (sc-7971, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), CASP9 (sc-17784, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or GAPDH (TRK5G4-6C5, Research Diagnostic Inc.). The blots were developed using the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and Pierce Super Signal West Pico (Pierce) chemiluminescent reagent. Protein bands were quantitated using a Kodak ID v6.3.1 imaging system (Kodak Scientific) and normalized to the levels of endogenous GAPDH. RNA and cDNA Preparation—Cells were harvested 32 h post-addition of CdSO4. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) followed by purification with an RNeasy midi-column (Qiagen) as directed by the manufacturer. RNA integrity and concentrations were assessed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Massy, France) and a Ultrospec 3000 spectrophotometer (Amersham Biosciences), respectively. Fluorescently labeled first strand cDNAs were prepared by direct incorporation of fluorescent nucleotide analogs during a reverse transcription reaction consisting of either 20 (Cy3 labeling) or 40 μg (Cy5 labeling) of total RNA, 2 μg of oligo(dT)20 primers, 0.25 mm each of dATP, dCTP, and dGTP, 0.025 mm dTTP, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 300 units of reverse transcriptase (Superscript II, Stratagene), and 2 nmol of either Cy3- or Cy5-dUTP (Amersham Biosciences). The cDNA probes were concentrated by filtering through Vivaspin 0.5-ml concentrators (Vivascience). For each microarray hybridization, the appropriate Cy3- and Cy5-labeled cDNA pools to be compared were mixed. Microarray Hybridization and Data Analysis—Microarray slides representing 14,000 human genes (NIAID Microarray Facility) were incubated for 1 h at 42 °C with prehybridization solution (1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% SDS, 5× SSC), washed two times in double-distilled H2O, washed once in isopropyl alcohol, and dried by centrifugation at 600 rpm for 3 min. Each microarray slide received 66 μl of hybridization solution containing the appropriate Cy3- and Cy5-labeled cDNA pools, 1 μg of poly(d(A))40-60, 10 μg of Cot-1 DNA, 4 μg of yeast tRNA, and 33 μl of hybridization solution (10× SSC, 50% formamide, 0.2% SDS). The mixtures were applied by capillary action under a coverslip (LifterSlip, Erie Scientific Co., Portsmouth, NH) placed over the microarray, and the assembly was incubated in a humidified hybridization chamber for 16 h at 42 °C. Microarray slides were washed twice in 1× SSC, 0.05% SDS for 2 min and twice in 0.1× SSC for 2 min and dried by centrifugation at 600 rpm for 3 min. The slides were immediately scanned and analyzed with a scanner/software package (Axon GenePix 4000B/GenePix Pro 4.0; Axon Instruments, Inc., Foster City, CA). For each microarray set, four replicate hybridizations were done including a dye-bias hybridization control. Microarray Analysis—The average signal intensity and local background measurements for each spot on the array were analyzed using custom mAdb software (developed by Center for Information Technology/BioInformatics & Molecular Analysis Section in collaboration with NCI/Center for Cancer Research & NIAID and available at madb.niaid.nih.gov/index.shtml). The local background was subtracted from the mean intensity value of each spot on the array. Spots were considered negative and eliminated from further analysis if the values for both channels were less than a threshold value defined as one S.D. above the background. The two channels were normalized with respect to the median values for the remaining set of spots. The Cy5/Cy3 fluorescence ratios were calculated from the normalized values and reflect the differential value. Three sets of microarray analyses were performed: T-Act versus TEH-Act, T-Act versus Act, and Act versus MEP (control). To ensure reproducibility in the cDNA preparation and hybridization steps, all experimental data were collected from the hybridization of four independent cDNA preparations from each RNA preparation. Luciferase Reporter Constructs and Assays—Luciferase reporter constructs contained the promoter domains for ELK1 (-500 to +34, NT_011568), c/EBPβ (-500 to +66, NT_011362), Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat (-303 to +23), and ubiquitin C (-333 to +877) in pGL3-Basic (Promega). pLG3FOR2 (gift of C. J. Ciudad, University of Barcelona) contained the Sp1 promoter (-217 to +44)-luciferase reporter (31Nicolas M. Noe V. Ciudad C.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For transfections, duplicate plates seeded with 4 × 104 tsBN67 cells per 1.9-cm2 well (19Goto H. Motomura S. Wilson A.C. Freiman R.N. Nakabeppu Y. Fukushima K. Fujishima M. Herr W. Nishimoto T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 726-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) were incubated at 31 and 40 °C for 24 h prior to transfection with DNA mixes containing various amounts of the promoter-luciferase reporter (25, 50, 100, 200, and 400 ng). The dishes were incubated at the appropriate temperatures for 24 h prior to the measurement of luciferase activity (dual luciferase assay system, Promega). In all cases, the firefly luciferase activity was normalized to the activity of a cotransfected Renilla control (pRL-TK), and the results of duplicate transfections were averaged. Development of a Cytoplasmic Sequestering System—In contrast to the predominantly nuclear localization of HCF-1 in most cell types, the protein is uniquely sequestered in the cytoplasm of sensory neurons. This localization has been hypothesized to regulate the transcriptional functions of HCF-1 and to be a major controlling determinant in the establishment of and reactivation from the latent state for herpes simplex virus (30Kristie T.M. Vogel J.L. Sears A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1229-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The phenomenon provided a concept for the development of an inducible cytoplasmic sequestering system for the analysis of the cellular functions of HCF-1. The sequestering system is dependent upon the inducible expression of an actin fusion protein containing a small, high affinity HCF-1 interaction motif derived from VP16 (7Wysocka J. Herr W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 294-304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 25Freiman R.N. Herr W. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3122-3127Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 26Lu R. Yang P. Padmakumar S. Misra V. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6291-6297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 1, incorporation of the expressed actin fusion protein into cytoplasmic actin filaments would act as a high affinity anchor by binding HCF-1 and preventing the normal nuclear transport of the protein. In this manner, the nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio of the endogenous HCF-1 could be shifted in a regulated manner to allow modulation of HCF-1 localization without total ablation of the protein. Theoretically, this system would promote cell survival while affecting functions that are critically dependent upon the available nuclear pool of HCF-1. In developing this system, the high affinity HCF-1 interaction motif from VP16 or a control containing mutations in the critical EHAY core of the motif were fused to actin under the control of an inducible metallothionein promoter (Fig. 2A). Stable cell lines containing the transgenes were selected and analyzed by Western blot for the expression of the fusion proteins in the absence and presence of the inducer (CdSO4). As shown in Fig. 2B, both the wild-type fusion protein (T-Act) and the fusion protein containing the EHAY core mutations (TEHAct) were not detected in the absence of CdSO4 and were expressed at equivalent levels in the presence of the inducer. Furthermore, both fusion proteins exhibited immunofluorescent patterns indicating that they had been incorporated into cellular actin filaments (Fig. 2C). Cytoplasmic Sequestering of HCF-1—The effect of the expression of the actin fusion proteins upon the localization of endogenous HCF-1 was analyzed by quantitative immunofluorescent labeling (Fig. 3, top). T-Act, TEH-Act, and control cells containing the vector alone (MEP) were fixed at various times after induction with CdSO4. The cells were costained with anti-HA sera to detect the expressed actin fusion protein and anti-HCF-1 sera to determine the localization of HCF-1. As shown in Fig. 3(top), cells expressing the T-Act fusion protein exhibited a clear visual increase in the level of cytoplasmic HCF-1 over time as compared with control MEP (Fig. 3, right panels) or TEH-Act cells (data not shown). Quantitative assessment of the cytoplasmic/nuclear ratio of HCF-1 in each cell line confirmed the visual interpretation and demonstrated that the cytoplasmic/nuclear ratio of HCF-1 increased in T-Act cells to nearly 1.4, while MEP and TEH-Act cells maintained a stable ratio ranging from 0.3 to 0.5 (Fig. 3, bottom right). Sequestering of HCF-1 Inhibits the Expression of HSV IE Genes and Viral Replication—Induced T-Act cells exhibited a significant shift in the cytoplasmic to nuclear ratio of HCF-1. As in vitro data and studies using the ts-HCF-1 mutant have supported the model that HCF-1 is required for the regulated transcription of the HSV IE genes, T-Act, TEH-Act, and control cells expressing the HA-tagged actin (Act) were induced for 24 h and infected with HSV at either 0.01 or 0.1 pfu/cell. At 2 h post-infection, the expression of the viral IE protein ICP4 was determined by Western blot analysis of cell lysates. As shown in Fig. 4A (left panel), the level of ICP4 expression was significantly reduced in induced T-Act cells relative to those in TEHAct and Act cells (60% reduction, Fig. 4B). The levels of a second IE protein, ICP0, were similarly affected (data not shown). In contrast to this, infection of the T-Act cells at 0.1 pfu/cell resulted in expression of nearly wild-type levels of both IE proteins (Fig. 4A, right panel, ICP0 data not shown). The contrasting impacts of HCF-1 cytoplasmic sequestering on viral IE gene expression at 0.01 and 0.1 pfu/cell were likely due to the introduction of high levels of wild-type VP16 protein into the cells by the infecting viral particles (4Roizman B. Sears A.E. Fields B. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fundamental Virology. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia1996: 1043-1107Google Scholar) that would be expected to compete for the sequestered HCF-1 protein (see “Discussion”). The overall effect of sequestering HCF-1 on viral replication was also assessed. T-Act, TEH-Act, and Act cells were induced and infected with HSV at 0.01 or 0.1 pfu/cell. The resulting progeny virus was harvested at 17 h post-infection. As shown in Fig. 4C, infection of T-Act cells at 0.01 pfu/cell resulted in a significant decrease in the resulting viral yield relative to the TEH-Act and Act control lines. Surprisingly, a decrease in the viral yield was also observed after infection of T-Act cells at 0.1 pfu/cell. The less significant but reproducible decrease in viral yield at 0.1 pfu/cell in T-Act cells suggests that HCF-1 may also play additional roles later in the HSV viral lytic cycle (see “Discussion”). Cellular Regulatory Targets of HCF-1—While the role of HCF-1 in HSV IE gene expression has been well studied, little is known concerning the cellular HCF-1 functions or targets. The effect of sequestering of HCF-1 on HSV IE gene expression and viral replication demonstrated that this system could provide an approach to the analysis of HCF-1-dependent cellular transcriptional functions including those events that might account for the various phenotypic functions ascribed to the protein. Therefore, to identify targets that might be critically dependent upon HCF-1 nuclear function, human oligonucleotide microarrays were hybridized with mRNA isolated from the HCF-1 sequestering and control cell lines in three independent microarray sets: T-Act versus Act, T-Act versus TEH-Act, and Act versus MEP. The resulting microarray raw data were subjected to a series of successive criteria to ensure the validity of the final values and the selected gene list. As listed in Table I, the oligonucleotide microarrays represented 14,000 known and predicted human open reading frames. Those genes that were detected in an array set and that were represented in at least three of the four replicate array hybridizations were selected for further analysis. Genes identified in the T-Act versus Act array set and the control Act versus MEP set were then filtered for those with differential values ≤0.3 or ≥3.0 in at least one replicate hybridization. As the TEH-Act mutant control is not a null mutant and does have a limited sequestering phenotype (refer to Fig. 3), this array set was filtered less stringently for those genes with differential values ≤0.5 or ≥1.5 in at least two replicate hybridizations. From each of these array sets, genes represented in the filtered Act versus MEP array set were deleted to eliminate any impact of the overexpression of actin or fluctuations in the actin cytoskeleton. For those genes remaining in the T-Act versus Act and T-Act versus TEH-Act array sets, the values of the replicate hybridizations were averaged, and the gene list and values were compared between each independent array set. Only those genes that were represented in both the T-Act versus Act and T-Act versus TEH-Act arrays and whose values were consistent in both array sets were selected. Finally, the average of the replicate hybridizations of the T-Act versus Act and T-Act versus TEH-Act for each gene was filtered for a differential of ≤0.5 or ≥1.5. The final 188 selected genes are listed in Tables II, III, and IV.Table IMicroarray data analysis chartT-Act vs. ActT-Act vs. TEH-ActAct vs. MepRepresented on arrays14,00014,00014,000Detected in microarray hybridization845191578588Filtered for 75% representation in replicate sets699578167422Applied filters:≤0.3 or ≥3.0389276≤0.5 or ≥1.5500Deleted genes represented in Act vs. Mep3674470Compared average values from T-Act vs. Act to T-Act vs. TEH-Act1) Genes represented in both sets of arrays2) Array values consistent in both independent array sets3) Average of both array sets was ≤0.5 or ≥1.5Selected188 Open table in a new tab Table IIGenes affected by cytoplasmic sequestering of HCF-1UniGeneGeneCategory 2FunctionT-Act vs. TEH-ActT-Act vs. ActAverageHCF-1ApoptosisHs.1048KITLGUp-regulates Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, antiapoptotic0.220.190.21+Hs.122552GTSE1DNA damage responseControls p53-dependent apoptosis after DNA damage0.480.460.47+Hs.80019PDCD6T cell receptor-, Fas-, GR-induced apoptosis1.511.661.58−Hs.100641CASP9DNA damage responseInitiator caspase, UV-dependent1.651.681.66−Cell cycleHs.121028ASPMMitotic spindle function0.180.180.18+Hs.23348SKP2DNA damage responseG1-S, SCF ubiquitin ligase-reg c-Myc, p21, DNA repair0.320.390.35+Hs.152983HUS1DNA damage responseS-phase cell cycle checkpoint, DNA damage response0.430.480.46+Hs.82906CDC20Coactivator of anaphase-promoting complex1.601.501.55−Hs.423615CDC34Degrades CDK for DNA replication initiation1.531.721.62−Hs.256697HINT1TranscriptionAdenosine monophosphoramidase binds Cdk71.591.851.72−ChromatinHs.143042HIST1H3DHistone H3, nucleosome formation1.661."
https://openalex.org/W2052893878,"Cell migration plays key roles in physiological and pathological phenomena, such as development and oncogenesis. The adaptor proteins Grb2, CrkII, and Nck1 are composed of only a single Src homology 2 domain and some Src homology 3 domains, giving specificity to each signal transduction pathway. However, little is known about the relationships between their adaptor proteins and cell migration, which are regulated by the G protein-coupled receptor. Here we showed that Nck1, but not Grb2 or CrkII, mediated the inhibition of cell migration induced by the endothelin-1 and endothelin A receptor. The small interference RNA and dominant negative mutants of Nck1 diminished the endothelin-1-induced inhibition of cell migration. Although overexpression of wild-type Nck1 was detected in the cytosol and did not affect cell migration, expression of the myristoylation signal sequence-conjugated Nck1 was detected in the membrane and induced activation of Cdc42 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, inhibiting cell migration. Taken together, these results suggest that the endothelin A receptor transduces the signal of inhibition of cell migration through Cdc42-dependent c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation by using Nck1.

Cell migration plays key roles in development and oncogenesis. During development, organized cell migration is essential for proper tissue formation (1Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. Cell. 1996; 84: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3254) Google Scholar). However, unregulated cell migration is observed in pathological processes, such as oncogenesis, which involves, specifically, invasion and metastasis. The elucidation of the processes by which molecular signaling mechanisms positively and negatively regulate cell migration is critical in understanding both development and disease progression.In many cases of the migration process, cells show directed movement (called chemotaxis) toward soluble chemoattractants. A number of chemoattractants have been identified: chemokines, lipid mediators, growth factors, and cytokines (1Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. Cell. 1996; 84: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3254) Google Scholar, 2Sanchez-Madrid F. del Pozo M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar).

In contrast, we have only limited information about the inhibitors of chemotaxis, i.e. chemorepellents, which are also the ligands of GPCRs. These include bioactive lipids, thrombin, metastin, and μ-opioid peptide (7Okamoto H. Takuwa N. Yokomizo T. Sugimoto N. Sakurada S. Shigematsu H. Takuwa Y. Mol. Cell.

Bilfinger T.V. Stefano G.B. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 1323-1330PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which GPCRs inhibit migration is not fully understood so far.Adaptor proteins, such as Nck1, Grb2, and CrkII, consist primarily of a single Src homology (SH)2 domain and various numbers of SH3 domains and do not have other functional motifs (11Birge R.B. Knudsen B.S. Besser D. Hanafusa H. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 595-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 12Mayer B.J. Baltimore D. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 8-13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The SH2 domain recognizes tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, and the SH3 domain associates with the PXXP motif-containing proteins (13Schlessinger J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). These domains provide a site in which coupling of the distinct molecules to the core machinery regulates the cellular function and gives specificity to the signal transduction. Among them, Grb2 provides a well characterized example of how adaptor proteins of this group function to transduce signals. Grb2 constantly associates with a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Sos of Ras GTPases via the SH3 domains (14Sastry L. Lin W. Wong W.T. Di Fiore P.P. Scoppa C.A. King C.R. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1107-1112PubMed Google Scholar). Following growth factor stimulation, Grb2 binds to tyrosine-phosphorylated receptor kinases and/or other adaptor proteins such as Shc via its SH2 domain. As a result, Sos is translocated to the plasma membranes, leading to Ras-dependent activation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK), a subfamily of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) (15Li N. Batzer A. Daly R. Yajnik V. Skolnik E. Chardin P. Bar-Sagi D. Margolis B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1993; 363: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar, 16Rozakis-Adcock M. Fernley R. Wade J. Pawson T. Bowtell D. Nature. 1993; 363: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar).We demonstrated that the endothelin-1 (ET-1) and endothelin A (ETA) receptors activate Cdc42 of Rho GTPases, which in turn stimulate the signaling cascade of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), a subfamily of MAPKs (17Yamauchi J.

To further investigate the mechanism whereby the ETA receptor inhibits cell migration, the effects of various dominant negative mutants on cell migration were assayed on the transient transfection system using human epithelial 293T cells. Here we show that the Nck1, but not Grb2 or CrkII, is a critical regulator in the chemorepellent signaling pathway coupling the ETA receptor to Cdc42-dependent activation of JNK. Additionally, membrane-targeted Nck1 inhibited cell migration. These results suggest that Nck1 functions as a mediator of the chemorepellent signaling downstream of the ETA receptor.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Mouse monoclonal antibodies against active phosphorylated JNK (Thr183/Tyr185), active phosphorylated ERK (Thr202/Tyr204), and rabbit polyclonal antibodies against JNK and ERK were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc (Beverly, MA). A mouse monoclonal antibody against MBP and rabbit polyclonal antibodies against JNK1 and c-Src were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Mouse monoclonal antibodies against Cdc42 and Nck1 were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (San Jose, CA). A mouse antibody against Aequorea victoria green fluorescence protein (GFP) was obtained from Medical and Biological Laboratories (Nagoya, Japan). A mouse monoclonal antibody against tubulin was purchased from Sigma. Antimouse and anti-rabbit IgG antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. SP600125, U0126, SB203580, and PP1 were purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA), and Clostridium difficile toxin B was from Calbiochem-Novabiochem (San Diego, CA). ET-1 and epidermal growth factor (EGF) were purchased from the Peptide Institute, Inc. (Osaka, Japan) and Roche Diagnostics Co. (Indianapolis, IN), respectively.Plasmids—Wild-type Nck1, Grb2, and CrkII were amplified from a mouse brain cDNA library and subcloned into the mammalian MBP-tagged expression vector pCMV-MBP. Wild-type Nck1 was also ligated into the pEGFP-N3 (Clontech) to make pEGFP-Nck1-N3. To produce dominant negative mutants of Nck1 and CrkII, the conserved arginine residue of the FLVRES sequence in the SH2 domain was changed into lysine, making Nck1R308K and CrkIIR38K, or the first tryptophan residue of the characteristic tryptophan doublet of the SH3 domain was changed to lysine, creating Nck1W38K, Nck1W143K, Nck1W229K, CrkIIW169K, and CrkIIW275K. These residues are identified as being essential for binding to their ligands (19Lu W. Katz R. Gupta R. Mayer B.J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The amino acid substitutions were performed by the overlap extension method based on PCR with mutant oligonucleotides. These mutants were ligated into the pCMV-MBP. Mutations in all three Nck1 SH3 domains (designed SH3All in this paper) were carried out by sequentially repeating the above procedure. The fragments of Grb2ΔSH2 lacking the SH2 domain (amino acids 60–158) and Grb2ΔSH3 lacking the SH3 domain (amino acids 1–60 and 159–218) of Grb2 were inserted into pCMV-MBP. For the myristoylated products, the 14 amino acid c-Src myristoylation signal was first synthesized by PCR (19Lu W. Katz R. Gupta R. Mayer B.J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The PCR product was digested and cloned into pEGFP-N3 (Clontech) to make the pEGFP-myr-N3 plasmid. Nck1 was subcloned into pEGFP-myr-N3. pCMV-FLAG-RhoT19N, pCMV-FLAG-RacT17N, pCMV-FLAG-Cdc42T17N, and the Escherichia coli expression plasmid encoding the Cdc42-binding domain (CRIB) of αPak were constructed as described previously (20Yamauchi J.

The cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Plasmid DNAs were transfected into cells by the calcium-phosphate precipitation method (18Miyamoto Y. Yamauchi J. Itoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29890-29900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Transfection efficiency typically exceeded 80% using the pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) as a control plasmid in 293T cells. The final amount of transfected DNA for a 60-mm dish was adjusted to 15 μg by pCMV. The pME-ETA receptor EGFP (0.3 μg) was cotransfected with the dominant negative mutants of pCMV-MBP adaptor proteins (1–3 μg) or pCMV-FLAG-Rho GTPases (1 μg) into 293T cells. In some cases, the cells were transfected with 1 μg of pUSE-CA-Src, 1 μg of pEGFP-Nck1-N3, or 1 μg of pEGFP-myr-Nck1-N3. The medium was replaced 24 h after transfection, and the cells were starved in a serum-free medium. The cells were pretreated with SP600125 (100 nm, 45 min), U0126 (10 μm, 1 h), SB203580 (10 μm, 1 h), PP1 (1 μm, 16 h), or ToxinB (0.2 ng/ml, 16 h) before stimulation with ET-1 (100 nm, 20–30 min) or EGF (10 ng/ml, 10 min).siRNA Preparation and Transfection—RNA oligonucleotides were synthesized by Dharmacon, Inc. (Lafayette, CO). GFP siRNA was used as a negative control. The siRNAs were transfected into 293T cells using LipofectAMINETM 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's protocol.Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—After the addition of ET-1 or EGF, the cells were lysed in 600 μl of a lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 3 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethane sulfonylfluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) per 60-mm dish (18Miyamoto Y. Yamauchi J. Itoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29890-29900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation was carried out as described previously (18Miyamoto Y. Yamauchi J. Itoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29890-29900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates or the expressed proteins in the cell lysates were denatured and then separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The electrophoretically separated proteins were transferred to membranes, blocked, and immunoblotted as described previously (18Miyamoto Y. Yamauchi J. Itoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29890-29900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Images of protein bands in immunoblots were captured using Adobe Photoshop 5.0-J plug-in software and an EPSON GT-7300U scanner. The band intensity of kinases and Rho GTPases was semiquantified using NIH Image 1.61. The representatives of at least three separate experiments are shown in the figures.MAPK Assay—Immunoprecipitated JNK or cell lysates were immunoblotted with an anti-phosphorylated JNK antibody or anti-phosphorylated ERK antibody (23Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Della Rocca G.J. Lin F. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1999; 283: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar). To compare the total amounts of MAPKs in the lysates, the immunoblottings were also performed using an anti-JNK or anti-ERK antibody. The levels of phosphorylated forms were normalized to the total amounts of kinases using NIH Image 1.61. Approximately 10% of the total JNK were immunoprecipitated with anti-JNK antibody, and 20% of the immunoprecipitated JNK were phosphorylated after stimulation with ET-1. The representatives of four to six separate experiments are shown in the figures.Pull-down Assay—To detect endogenous active GTP-bound Cdc42 in the cell lysates, we performed pull-down assays using recombinant glutathione S-transferase-tagged αPakCRIB (18Miyamoto Y. Yamauchi J. Itoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29890-29900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The levels of active GTP-bound Cdc42 were normalized to the total amounts of Cdc42 proteins.Cell Migration Assay—Cell migration was measured using a 24-well Boyden chamber (Discovery Labware) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, the upper wells with polyethylene terephthalate filters (8-μm pore size) were coated with 10 μg/ml extracellular matrix E-C-L (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). Serum-starved cells (2 × 105 cells in 500 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/well) were loaded into the upper wells, which were immediately plated in a chamber containing 165 nm ET-1 (750 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/well). After incubation at 37 °C for 5 h, the upper filters were stained with a Diff-Quick staining kit (Biochemical Sciences Inc., Sterling Heights, MI). Using an optical microscope, the number of migrated cells was counted in at least three independent experiments.Crude Membrane Preparation—Briefly, the harvested cells were homogenized in an ice-cold buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 250 mm sucrose, and 1 mm MgCl2). Nuclei and unbroken cells were separated from the cell extract by a centrifuge (700 × g, 4 °C, 10 min). The supernatant was sonicated and centrifuged (150,000 × g, 4 °C, 30 min). The supernatant was used as the postnuclear cytosol fraction, and the pellet was used as the crude membrane fraction (24Awaji T. Hirasawa A. Kataoka M. Shinoura H. Nakayama Y. Sugawara T. Izumi S. Tsujimoto G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1099-1111PubMed Google Scholar).Statistical Analysis—Values shown in the figures represent the mean ± S.E. from at least three separate experiments. A Student's t test was carried out for intergroup comparisons with the control (*, p < 0.01).RESULTSThe ETA Receptor Induces the Inhibition of Cell Migration via Cdc42/JNK—Because we previously suggested that the ETA receptor inhibits cell migration through the JNK signaling pathway (17Yamauchi J.

Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29890-29900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), using the dominant negative mutant of JNK activator, MKK4K95R, we examined the effect of a JNK-specific inhibitor on cell migration. As shown in Fig. 1, A–C, ETA receptor-induced inhibition of cell migration was blocked only by SP600125 (JNK inhibitor) but not by U0126 (MEK1/2 inhibitor) or SB203580 (p38 MAPK inhibitor). Next, we investigated the involvement of Rho GTPases in this signaling pathway. As shown in Fig. 1D, the dominant negative mutant of Cdc42, but not of RhoA or Rac1, attenuated ETA receptor-induced inhibition, indicating that Cdc42 functions downstream of the ETA receptor. Taken together with previous data (18Miyamoto Y. Yamauchi J. Itoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29890-29900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), these results indicated that the Cdc42/JNK pathway plays a key role in the inhibition of cell migration induced by the ETA receptor.The ETA Receptor Induces the Inhibition of Cell Migration through Nck1 but Not through Grb2 or CrkII—A growing number of studies have suggested that adaptor proteins play an important role in mediating the signaling pathway from receptor tyrosine kinases to the Rho family-dependent regulation of the actin cytoskeleton (25Feller S.M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6348-6371Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 26Li W. Fan J. Woodley D.T. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6403-6417Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Cell migration is a complex cellular process that is regulated by a number of regulatory proteins and is driven by cytoskeletal reorganization. To explore the potential involvement of adaptor proteins in the ETA receptor-induced inhibition of cell migration, we transiently transfected the dominant negative mutants of these adaptor proteins into cells. The cells transfected with the plasmid encoding Grb2ΔSH2 or CrkIIR38K had no effect on the ETA receptor-induced inhibition of cell migration (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, various SH3 domain-deficient mutants (Nck1W38K, W143K, W229K, and SH3All) and an SH2-deficient mutant (Nck1R308K) of Nck1 rescued the negative effect (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that Nck1, but not Grb2 or CrkII, is necessary for the inhibition of cell migration induced by the ETA receptor.Fig. 2Involvement of adaptor protein Nck1 in the ETA receptor-induced inhibition of cell migration. Cells were transfected with the ETA receptor (A–C) and dominant negative mutants of Grb2 (A), CrkII (B), or Nck1 (C). After incubation for 5 h, the cells attached to the filters were stained and counted. Expression of the ETA receptor and the dominant negative mutants of adaptor proteins is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)JNK Activation Induced by an ETA Receptor Is Mediated by Nck1 but Not by Grb2 or CrkII—To examine whether an ETA receptor activates JNK through adaptor proteins, endogenous JNK was immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates and immunoblotted with an anti-phosphorylated JNK antibody, which recognizes the active state of JNK. As shown in Fig. 3A, ETA receptor-induced JNK activation was blocked by co-transfection with the dominant negative mutants of Nck1 (Nck1W38K, W143K, W229K, SH3All, and R308K). However, co-transfection with dominant negative mutants of Grb2 (Grb2ΔSH3 and ΔSH2) or CrkII (CrkllW169K, W275K, and R38K) had no effect on JNK activation elicited by the ETA receptor (Fig. 3, B and C). On the other hand, Grb2ΔSH3 inhibited EGF-induced ERK phosphorylation, and CrkIIR38K blocked EGF-induced JNK phosphorylation, in agreement with earlier findings (27Tanaka M. Gupta R. Mayer B.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6829-6837Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 28Dolfi F. Garcia-Guzman M. Ojaniemi M. Nakamura H. Matsuda M. Vuori K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15394-15399Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3, D and E). However, the dominant negative mutants of Nck1 had no effect on either EGF-induced JNK (Fig. 3F) and ERK (data not shown) activation. These results indicate that Nck1, but not Grb2 or CrkII, is a specific component of the signaling pathway from the ETA receptor to JNK.Fig. 3Nck1 is involved in ETA receptor-induced JNK activation. JNK activity (A–C, E, and F) and ERK activity (D) were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells co-transfected with the ETA receptor (A–C) and dominant negative mutants of Nck1 (A), Grb2 (B), or CrkII (C) were treated with ET-1 (100 nm, 20 min). Endogenous JNK was immunoprecipitated with anti-JNK antibody and blotted with anti-phosphorylated JNK antibody or anti-JNK antibody. The levels of JNK phosphorylation were quantified and normalized against the total immunoprecipitated JNK levels. D–F, cells transfected with the dominant negative mutants of adaptor proteins were treated with EGF (10 ng/ml, 10 min). The cell lysates were blotted with an anti-phosphorylated ERK or anti-ERK antibody. The levels of ERK or JNK phosphorylation were quantified and normalized against the total immunoprecipitated ERK or JNK levels. Expression of the ETA receptor (A–C) and the dominant negative mutants of adaptor proteins (A–F) is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The ETA Receptor Increases the GTP-bound Form of Cdc42 through Nck1 but Not through Grb2 or CrkII—Next, using a pull-down assay, we investigated whether the ETA receptor activates Cdc42 through adaptor proteins. Following stimulation with ET-1, the GTP-bound active form of Cdc42 was dramatically increased, and this effect was blocked by the dominant negative mutants of Nck1 (Fig. 4A). As shown in Fig. 4, B and C, the dominant negative mutants of Grb2 and CrkII had no effect on the ETA receptor-induced activation of Cdc42. Taken together, these results suggest that Nck1 mediates the ETA receptor-induced inhibition of cell migration involving Cdc42 and JNK.Fig. 4Nck1 mediates the ETA receptor-induced activation of Cdc42. Cells were co-transfected with the ETA receptor (A–C) and dominant negative mutants of Nck1 (A), Grb2 (B), or CrkII (C). The amount of GTP-bound Cdc42 was assessed after the addition of ET-1 (100 nm, 30 min) with the pull-down assay using αPAK-CRIB (A–C). The total Cdc42 in the cell lysates was immunoblotted with anti-Cdc42 antibody. Expression of the ETA receptor and the dominant negative mutants of adaptor proteins is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The Membrane-bound Form of Nck1 Stimulates the Inhibition of Cell Migration by Increasing the Activities of Cdc42 and JNK—To examine whether Nck1 can inhibit cell migration through the Cdc42/JNK signaling pathway, we made a membrane-bound mutant of Nck1. We fused the myristoylation signal sequence of c-Src to the N terminus of Nck1 (Fig. 5A). To verify the effectiveness of the myristoylation signal sequence, transfected cells were homogenized and fractionated into crude membrane, cytosol, and nucleus. Wild-type Nck1 was detected in the cytosol fraction, and myr-Nck1 was mainly found in the membrane fraction (Fig. 5A). As shown in Fig. 5B, myr-Nck1 significantly inhibited cell migration; however wild-type Nck1 did not. Additionally, myr-Nck1 increased the activities of JNK and the GTP-bound form of Cdc42 (Fig. 5, C and D). Taken together, these results suggest that Nck1 mediates the activation of Cdc42 and JNK and inhibits cell migration.Fig. 5Membrane-bound Nck1 induces the inhibition of cell migration.A, structure and expression of wild-type or myristoylation signal-tagged Nck1 (myr-Nck1). For the membrane-bound construct, the 14-amino acid c-Src myristoylation signal was linked to the N terminus of the wild type of Nck1. Lysates from the cells transfected with wild-type or myr-Nck1 were fractionated into crude membrane (m), cytosol (c), and nucleus (n). An equal amount (10 μg of proteins) of each fraction was blotted with an anti-Nck1 antibody. B, cells were transfected with wild-type or myr-Nck1. After incubation for 5 h, the cells attached to the filters were stained and counted. C and D, cells were transfected with wild-type or myr-Nck1. The amount of phosphorylated JNK (C) or GTP-bound Cdc42 (D) was measured after stimulation of ET-1. Data were evaluated using the Student's t test.

As shown in Fig. 6A, we designed a pair of oligonucleotides (siNck1–1 or siNck1–2) corresponding to the sequence of human Nck1. Transfection of siNck1–1 or siNck1–2 into the cells suppressed the expression of endogenous Nck1, but not tubulin, in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6A). Because we observed a prominent silencing effect of siNck1–1 on endogenous Nck1, we used siNck1–1 in the following experiments.Fig. 6Effects of siNck1 on the ETA receptor-induced inhibition of cell migration and Cdc42/JNK activation.A, sequence of the synthetic siRNA duplex targeting Nck1 (siNck1–1 or siNck1–2). The 2-nucleotide 3′ overhang of 2′-deoxythymidine is indicated as TT. The indicated amount of siRNAs was transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 into the cells. The cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti-Nck1 or anti-tubulin antibodies. B, cells were transfected with siNck1–1 or siGFP using LipofectAMINE 2000. The phosphorylated JNK was detected after the addition of ET-1. C, cells were transfected with siNck1–1 or siGFP.

By contrast, the evolutionarily related meprin β subunit retains the COOH-terminal domains during biosynthesis and travels to the plasma membrane as a disulfide-linked integral membrane dimer. Deletion of a unique 56-amino acid inserted domain (the I domain) of meprin α prevents COOH-terminal proteolytic processing and results in the retention of this subunit within the ER. To determine elements responsible for this retention versus transport to the cell surface, mutagenesis experiments were performed. Replacement of the meprin α transmembrane (αT) and cytoplasmic (αC) domains with their β counterparts allowed rapid movement of the α subunit to the cell surface. The meprin αT and αC domains substituted into meprin β delayed movement of this chimera through the secretory pathway. Replacement of glycines in the meprin αT domain GXXXG motif with leucine residues, alanine insertions in the meprin αT domain, and mutagenesis of basic residues within the meprin αC domain did not enhance the movement of the α subunit through the secretory pathway. By contrast, a mutant of meprin α (C320AαΔI) that did not form disulfide-linked dimers or higher order oligomers was transported through the secretory pathway, although more slowly than meprin β.

The glycines are positioned along one face of the transmembrane α helix, allowing for tight packing with a second transmembrane helix, thereby stabilizing the helix-helix interactions (see, for example, Fig. 4B) (17Treutlein H.R. Lemmon M.A. Engelman D.M. Brunger A.T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12726-12733Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Previous studies with glycophorin A and the VacA toxin have shown that mutation of the glycine residues disrupts dimerization and multimerization (21Lemmon M.A. Flanagan J.M. Treutlein H.R. Zhang J. Engelman D.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12719-12725Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 22McClain M.S. Iwamoto H. Cao P. Vinion-Dubiel A.D. Li Y. Szabo G. Shao Z. Cover T.L. J. Biol.

In addition, alanine scanning insertion mutagenesis disrupts the alignment of the glycine residues within the transmembrane α helix and thereby disrupts glycophorin A dimerization (23Mingarro I. Whitley P. Lemmon M.A. von Heijne G. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1339-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). It seemed possible that the transmembrane structure of meprin α is important for protein-protein interactions (multimerization or hetero-oligomerization) that could lead to retention of the subunit in the ER/cis-Golgi compartments and that mutation of the meprin αT domain by site-directed or alanine insertion mutagenesis could disrupt this retention. Therefore, this type of study was conducted with meprin α. There are two well characterized ER retention motifs found in the cytoplasmic region of ER-retained type I transmembrane proteins, a dilysine motif (KKXXCOOH) and an RXR motif (24Nilsson T. Warren G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 517-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 25Chang X.B. Cui L. Hou Y. Jensen T.J. Aleksandrov A.A. Mengos A. Riordan J.R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 137-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Basic residues in meprin αC domain (KXRXCOOH) share similarities with both motifs. For this reason, the basic residues of the meprin α COOH-terminal tail were modified, and the effects on retention or movement of meprin α out of the ER were determined. Reagents and Materials—[35S]Methionine/cysteine was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Pansorbin was from Calbiochem. The mammalian expression plasmid pcDNA3.1+, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, Opti-MEM, methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium were from Invitrogen. The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit was from Stratagene. Protein A-Sepharose was from Sigma. Endoglycosidase H (Endo H) and peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) were from New England Biolabs Inc. Complete mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablets were from Roche Applied Science. n-Octyl glucoside was from Fisher. Plasmid Construction and Mutagenesis—All cDNAs were cloned into the expression vector pcDNA3.1+. The full-length wild-type mouse meprin α subunit, the αΔI mutant, and the αΔI/βETC mutant were described previously (14Marchand P. Tang J. Johnson G.D. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5449-5456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Wild-type meprin α and αΔI were subcloned into pcDNA3.1+ by restriction digestion with HindIII and XbaI. The COOH-terminally His6-tagged wild-type meprin αΔI mutant was constructed by PCR amplification with an internal 5′-primer and a 3′-primer containing a Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser spacer, a His6 tag sequence, and an XhoI restriction site. This PCR fragment was restriction-digested with BspEI and XhoI and used to replace the corresponding region of the αΔI mutant. The COOH-terminally His6-tagged full-length wild-type meprin β subunit was constructed by Dr. Greg P. Bertenshaw (Pennsylvania State University). Briefly, the entire wild-type meprin β cDNA was PCR-amplified with a 5′-primer containing a KpnI restriction site and a 3′-primer containing a Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser spacer, a His6 tag sequence, and an XhoI restriction site. This PCR fragment was digested with KpnI and XhoI and cloned into pcDNA3.1+ digested with the same enzymes. The β/αTC and β/αC mutants were constructed by Dr. Petra Marchand by fusion PCR using primers designed to replace the T and C domains of meprin β with those of meprin α and to replace the C domain of meprin β with that of meprin α, respectively. These mutants were subcloned into pcDNA3.1+ by restriction digestion with HindIII and XhoI. The C320AαΔI mutant was constructed by replacing the NH2-terminal fragment containing Cys320 of αΔI with the corresponding region of the C320Aα mutant, described previously (26Marchand P. Volkmann M. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24236-24241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), by restriction digestion with HindIII and BspEI. The αΔI/βTC mutant was constructed by fusion PCR in which the wild-type βT and βC domains replaced the corresponding fragments of meprin α. Fusion PCR was also used to construct the β/αT/βC mutant, in which the T domain of meprin β was replaced with the corresponding region of meprin α, and the β/αETC mutant, in which the E, T, and C domains of meprin β were replaced with the corresponding domains of meprin α. The αΔI/βC mutant was constructed by restriction digesting the β/αT/βC mutant with PmlI and ApaI and cloning the αT/βC fragment into αΔI digested with the same enzymes. The αΔIAXAXCOOH mutant was created by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit and mutagenic primers designed to mutate KLRQCOOH in the meprin αC domain to ALAQCOOH. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—Human embryonic kidney 293 cells (CRL-1573, American Type Culture Collection) were cultured as described previously (12Tsukuba T. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35260-35267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Cells were transiently transfected with 10 μg of DNA/10-cm2 dish using the HEPES-buffered saline calcium phosphate-mediated transfection method (27Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1998: 9.1.8-9.1.10Google Scholar). Briefly, 500 μl of 2× HEPES-buffered saline (50 mm HEPES, 1.5 mm Na2HPO4, and 280 mm NaCl, pH 7.05) was added dropwise to 10 μg of DNA in 500 μl of 125 mm CaCl2. After DNA-containing precipitates were allowed to form for 30 min at 25 °C, the reaction mixtures were then added to the 293 cells and incubated overnight at 37 °C. If meprin expression in the culture medium was to be assayed, the culture medium was changed 16 h post-transfection to serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium or serum-free Opti-MEM. Transfection efficiencies were ∼10% for mutant and wild-type proteins. Transfected proteins had similar levels of expression as determined by Western blot analysis of media using similar volumes, antibody dilutions, and film exposure times. The results shown in Fig. 1, 2, and 4, 5, 6 are representative of at least three separate experiments.Fig. 2Endo H sensitivity of the wild-type meprin β subunit and meprin β/α chimeras.A, diagram of the meprin β/α chimeras.

Media samples were collected; the serine protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm) was added; and samples were subjected to centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min. Supernatant fractions were concentrated to 500 μl with Centriplus-50 concentrators (Millipore Corp.). Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), removed from the plate by scrapping using a plate scrapper in 2 ml of PBS, and centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min. Cell sediment was suspended in 500 μl of PBS containing 1× Complete mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablet mixture and sonicated for 30 s to disrupt the cells. Total membrane fractions were isolated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. Membranes were washed twice with PBS and solubilized in 200 μl of 1.0% n-octyl glucoside in 1× PBS and 1× Complete protease inhibitor tablet mixture. Azocaseinase activity was measured as described previously (28Wolz R.L. Bond J.S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 325-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—Concentrated media and solubilized total membrane fractions were subjected to electrophoresis in the presence of β-mercaptoethanol on 7.5% Ready gels (Bio-Rad) in SDS gel electrophoresis buffer and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The polyclonal antibody used to detect meprin α subunits was HMC14 (14Marchand P. Tang J. Johnson G.D. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5449-5456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies against meprin β were produced in rabbits using purified recombinant rat meprin β protein (PSU56). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) were detected by chemiluminescence using the SuperSignal Dura substrate (Pierce). Endoglycosidase Treatment—Proteins were prepared for deglycosylation using Endo H and PNGase F following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, protein samples were denatured by boiling in 1× denaturation buffer for 10 min. Deglycosylation buffers containing 1× Complete protease inhibitor tablet mixture were added, and proteins were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Deglycosylated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Pulse-Chase Experiments—Pulse radiolabeling was performed as described previously (12Tsukuba T. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35260-35267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were radiolabeled for 30 min with [35S]methionine/cysteine (100 μCi/ml/dish). The cells were washed once with serum-free medium and incubated for 0, 2, 4, and 8 h in the presence of 2 ml of serum-free Opti-MEM. Cells were washed thoroughly with PBS and lysed. Cell lysates were incubated with Pansorbin for 1 h at 4 °C and centrifuged at 6500 × g for 30 min. Supernatant fractions were incubated with anti-mouse meprin β antibodies (PSU56) for 10 min at 37 °C and then overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were immunoprecipitated with 40 μl of a 50% suspension of protein A-Sepharose for 3 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed, boiled in 1× denaturation buffer for deglycosylation for 5 min, and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in the presence or absence of Endo H. Following deglycosylation, samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Gels were dried, and the immunoprecipitated proteins were visualized by fluorography. Size Exclusion Chromatography of Membrane-bound Meprins—Total membrane fractions were prepared by a modification of the method of Booth and Kenny (29Booth A.G. Kenny A.J. Biochem. J. 1974; 142: 575-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Briefly, stably transfected 293 cell lines grown to confluency on 10-cm2 dishes were scraped and washed once with 10 ml of 1× PBS, pH 7.5. Cells were sedimented at 200 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. PBS was removed by aspiration, and the sediment was resuspended in 1 ml of 2 mm Tris and 10 mm mannitol, pH 7.0, and sonicated in an ice bath for 1 min. CaCl2 was added to a final concentration of 10 mm to precipitate the membranes. Membranes were sedimented at 16,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C; the supernatant fraction was removed; and precipitates were solubilized overnight in 25 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% n-octyl glucoside, pH 7.5, on a rotating platform at 4 °C. Unsolubilized membrane components were sedimented at 16,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant fraction was subjected to chromatography on a Superose 6 size exclusion column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 25 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% n-octyl glucoside, pH 7.5. Fractions (1 ml) were collected, and the presence of meprin protein was detected by Western blot analysis using HMC14 polyclonal antibodies. Western blots were analyzed by densitometry. The Transmembrane and Cytoplasmic Domains of the Meprin α and β Subunits Are Important for Transport of the Proteins through the Secretory Pathway—Chimeras of meprins αΔI and β were constructed to map the domains responsible for intracellular retention versus cell-surface expression (Fig. 1A). Endoglycosidase treatments allowed the determination of the steady-state subcellular localization of the meprin proteins. Endo H removes the high-mannose oligosaccharides that are found in the ER, whereas PNGase F removes both high-mannose and complex oligosaccharides that arise in the Golgi apparatus (15Ellgaard L. Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 1999; 286: 1882-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). Mutants susceptible to Endo H treatment (such as meprin αΔI) are not complex glycosylated, indicating retention within a compartment prior to the medial-Golgi compartment (i.e. ER or cis-Golgi). Secreted wild-type meprin α was resistant to Endo H, but sensitive to PNGase F (Fig. 1B), indicating that complex glycosylation occurred. The replacement of all three COOH-terminal αΔI domains with those of meprin β (αΔI/βETC) or the last two domains (αΔI/βTC) resulted in resistance of the protein to Endo H, indicating that the proteins effectively moved through the medial-Golgi compartment. The meprin βC domain alone (αΔI/βC) was partially effective in allowing movement of the protein out of the ER/cis-Golgi compartments, but a significant amount of Endo H sensitivity was observed, indicating high-mannose oligosaccharides were present in this chimeric protein. Thus, both the meprin βT and βC domains play roles in movement of the β subunit out of the ER/cis-Golgi compartments. Chimeras of meprin β containing meprin α COOH-terminal domains were then constructed and transfected into 293 cells (Fig. 2A). The Endo H/PNGase F profiles of these mutants indicated that the meprin β constructs containing meprin α COOH-terminal domains were primarily resistant to Endo H, indicating movement out of the ER, but showed varying degrees of high-mannose glycosylation (Fig. 2B). Untreated membrane fractions of all the meprin β mutants existed as two species (unlike wild-type meprin β) that most likely represent complex glycosylated (higher molecular mass) and high-mannose glycosylated (lower molecular mass) species. After deglycosylation with PNGase F, one band was usually observed. Occasionally, there appeared to be two bands that migrated very closely to each other. The two bands could result from incomplete"
https://openalex.org/W1997314137,"Nitric oxide (NO) plays many roles in the immune system. It has been known that NO rescues thymocytes from glucocorticoid (GC)-induced apoptosis. However, the downstream target of NO in the protection from GC-induced thymocyte apoptosis has yet to be identified. We previously reported that GC sensitivity of developing thymocytes is dependent on the expression level of SRG3. In the present report, we found that NO repressed the SRG3 expression in both primary thymocytes and 16610D9 thymoma cells. Specifically, NO down-regulated the transcription of SRG3 via the inactivation of the transcription factor Sp1 DNA-binding activity to the SRG3 promoter. In addition, overexpression of SRG3 by a heterologous promoter reduced NO-mediated rescue of thymocytes from GC-induced apoptosis. These observations strongly suggest that NO may be involved in protecting immature thymocytes from GC-induced apoptosis by repressing the SRG3 expression in thymus.

During the past decade, it has been recognized that NO plays many roles in the immune system as well as in other organ systems. It is involved in the pathogenesis and control of infectious diseases, tumors, autoimmune processes, and chronic degenerative diseases (1Bogdan C. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 907-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (2537) Google Scholar). NO and its reaction products can exert opposite effects on apoptosis on the cell systems and conditions involved (2Kim Y.M. Bombeck C.A. Billiar T. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 253-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). They induce apoptosis in a variety of cell types, including macrophages, dendritic cells, thymocytes, and neuronal cells (3Fehsel K. Kroncke K.D. Meyer K.L. Huber H. Wahn V. Kolb-Bachofen V. J.

Cell Immunol. 2001; 214: 72-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Because of its capacity to induce or inhibit apoptosis in thymocytes, it is thought that NO may play a crucial role as an effector molecule in the selection and development of thymocytes in the thymus (1Bogdan C. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 907-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (2537) Google Scholar). Involvement of NO in T cell development has been indicated by several observations. Many immune cells, including epithelial and dendritic cells in the corticomedullary junction and medullary region of the thymus, constitutively express inducible NO synthase (iNOS), which is further up-regulated after contact with self- or allo-antigens or with thymocytes activated by T cell-receptor (TCR) stimulation (1Bogdan C. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 907-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (2537) Google Scholar, 10Aiello S. Noris M. Piccinini G. Tomasoni S. Casiraghi F. Bonazzola S. Mister M. Sayegh M.H. Remuzzi G. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 4649-4658Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). After stimulation by TCR, double-positive (DP) thymocytes are highly sensitive to the killing by NO, whereas single-positive (SP) thymocytes remain viable upon exposure to NO (11Tai X. Toyo-oka K. Yamanoto N. Yashiro Y. Mu J. Hamaoka T. Fujiwara H. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4696-4708PubMed Google Scholar). This result suggests that NO released by iNOS-positive thymic stromal cells is one of the factors mediating deletion of DP thymocytes (1Bogdan C. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 907-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (2537) Google Scholar, 3Fehsel K. Kroncke K.D. Meyer K.L. Huber H. Wahn V. Kolb-Bachofen V. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2858-2865PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, NO is implied in T cell survival. Pretreatment with NO protects thymocytes from glucocorticoid (GC)-induced apoptosis (3Fehsel K. Kroncke K.D. Meyer K.L. Huber H. Wahn V. Kolb-Bachofen V. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2858-2865PubMed Google Scholar), in the same way that activation of TCR signaling antagonizes GC-induced apoptosis (12Ashwell J.D. Lu F.W. Vacchio M.S. Annu.

However, its exact role in transduction of anti-apoptotic signals to thymocytes in thymus is not well documented.GCs, which are produced in the thymus as well as in the adrenal gland (12Ashwell J.D. Lu F.W. Vacchio M.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 309-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar), are known to play complex roles during thymocyte development. The levels of endogenous GCs in normal (non-stressed) conditions directly regulate T cell pool size and the CD4+:CD8+ T cell ratio (16Pazirandeh A. Xue Y. Prestegaard T. Jondal M. Okret S. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 727-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and they contribute to kill DP thymocytes in times of stress (17Jeon S.H. Kang M.G. Kim Y.H. Jin Y.H. Lee C. Chung H.Y. Kwon H.

Meanwhile, it was reported that NO, one of the most versatile players in the immune system, inhibits GC-induced apoptosis of developing thymocytes (3Fehsel K. Kroncke K.D. Meyer K.L. Huber H. Wahn V. Kolb-Bachofen V. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2858-2865PubMed Google Scholar). However, the specific downstream target of NO signaling conferring a GC resistance on thymocytes remains unclear.We previously isolated SRG3, the murine homolog of yeast SWI3 and human BAF155, as a gene highly expressed in thymus but at a low level in peripheral lymphoid organs (17Jeon S.H.

Recently, we also found that the expression level of SRG3 is down-regulated right after positive selection and is critical in determining GC sensitivity in T cells (14Ko M. Jang J. Ahn J. Lee K.

Furthermore, TCR/CD3 and Notch1 signaling inhibit GC-induced apoptosis of developing thymocytes by down-regulating SRG3 expression (14Ko M. Jang J. Ahn J. Lee K. Chung H. Jeon S.H. Seong R.H. J.

In response to positively selecting signals, DP thymocytes may down-regulate SRG3 expression and thus become GC-resistant. Otherwise, DP thymocytes without survival signals may still express a high level of SRG3 and thus may be eliminated by GC-induced apoptosis (14Ko M. Jang J. Ahn J. Lee K. Chung H. Jeon S.H.

Here we show that NO repressed SRG3 expression of primary thymocytes and 16610D9 thymoma cells. As known in the previous results, pretreatment of NO inhibits GC-induced apoptosis of thymocytes in wild-type mice. However, thymocytes, in transgenic mice overexpressing SRG3, were not as efficiently rescued by NO. We also found that NO suppressed the SRG3 transcription by reducing the DNA-binding activity of transcription factor Sp1 on the SRG3 promoter. Taken together, these observations strongly suggest that NO may inhibit GC-induced apoptosis of immature thymocytes by down-regulating the SRG3 expression.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMice, Reagents, and Antibodies—C57BL/6 mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory and were maintained in animal facility in Seoul National University. Transgenic mice overexpressing SRG3 protein (CD2-SRG3+ transgenic mice) previously described (28Choi Y.I. Jeon S.H. Jang J. Han S. Kim J.K. Chung H. Lee H.W. Chung H.Y. Park S.D. Seong R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2001; 98: 10267-10272Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) were maintained in the C57BL/6 background. S-Nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP), 8-bromo-cGMP (cGMP), and dexamethasone (DEX) were obtained from Sigma. FITC-conjugated 53-6.72, PE-conjugated GK1.5, and anti-Lck antibodies were purchased from BD Pharmingen. Anti-Sp1 and anti-actin antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antiserum against SRG3 was raised from rabbits in our laboratory (28Choi Y.I. Jeon S.H. Jang J. Han S. Kim J.K. Chung H. Lee H.W. Chung H.Y. Park S.D. Seong R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2001; 98: 10267-10272Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).Plasmids—The pSRG3-luc reporter construct, for the measurement of the SRG3 promoter activity, was described previously (28Choi Y.I. Jeon S.H. Jang J. Han S. Kim J.K. Chung H. Lee H.W. Chung H.Y. Park S.D. Seong R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2001; 98: 10267-10272Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Deletion constructs of SRG3 promoter were generated by PCR and cloned into pGL3-Basic vector (Promega). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed with the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), and mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. Following are the sequences converted in the SRG3 promoter region: mYY1 (–902), GCTATCTCCATTTTTTTTT into GCTATCTTTATTTTTTTTT; m I (–437), GGGGGTGGGT into GGGATTAGGT; m II (–415), GGGGTGGGGTGGGGT into GGGGATAGGTATGGT; m III (–144), GGGGCGTGGC into GGTTCGTGGC; m IV (–107), TGGGCGGGGC into TGTTCGGGGC.Cell Culture, Transfections, and Reporter Assay—The murine thymoma cell line, S49.1, was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone). The murine DP thymoma cell line, 16610D9, was kindly provided by Dr. C. Murre (University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA) and cultured in Opti-Mem (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfections were performed using Gene Pulse-II RF (Bio-Rad). Luciferase reporter assays were performed with the luciferase assay system (Promega), and β-galactosidase activity was used to normalize results for luciferase activity.Western and Northern Blot Analyses—SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis were performed as described previously (17Jeon S.H. Kang M.G. Kim Y.H. Jin Y.H. Lee C. Chung H.Y. Kwon H. Park S.D. Seong R.H. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1827-1836Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For Northern analysis, total RNAs from 16610D9 were isolated with TRIzol (Invitrogen). Each RNA sample (10 μg) was electrophoresed, transferred to membrane, and then hybridized with specific probes. Probes were obtained as described previously (17Jeon S.H. Kang M.G. Kim Y.H. Jin Y.H. Lee C. Chung H.Y. Kwon H. Park S.D. Seong R.H. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1827-1836Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).Flow Cytometry—After mechanical disruption of thymic fragments from 3- to 4-week-old male mice, isolated cells were treated with 500 μm SNAP and/or 10–7m DEX for 12 h. Single-cell suspension of thymocytes were stained with FITC-conjugated 53-6.72 and PE-conjugated GK1.5. Stained cells were analyzed with the CellQuest™ software using a FACStarplus (BD Biosciences). One million cells of 16610D9 were stained with AnnexinV-FITC (BD Pharmingen) and propidium iodide and analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting.Nuclear Extracts Preparation and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Cultured cells were treated with reagents under different experimental conditions. Preparation of nuclear extracts was performed as described previously (29Garban H.J. Bonavida B. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Total nuclear protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) using Emax (Molecular Devices Corp.). Oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase and purified over a MicroSpin™ G-25 column (Amersham Biosciences). Nuclear extracts (5 μg) were incubated with the hot Sp1 probe (50,000 cpm) for 30 min at room temperature in binding buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, and 50 μg/ml poly(dI-dC)). For the antibody supershift experiments, 2 μg of anti-Sp1 was preincubated with nuclear extracts for 10 min at room temperature prior to addition of 32P-labeled Sp1 probe. Oligonucleotides (sense strand) used for EMSA were: Sp1 consensus binding sequence (Promega), 5′-ATT CGA TCG GGG CGG GGC GAG C-3′; III region (–144), 5′-TCC AGA AGG GGC GTG GCC GCG CCT-3′; IV region (–107), 5′-GGT TGG CTG GGC GGG GCT AGG AGG-3′.Analysis of GC Sensitivity of Thymocytes—Thymocytes were harvested and stained with anti-CD4-PE and anti-CD8-FITC monoclonal antibody, and 20,000 cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. A viable cell gate was used to count the number of viable DP cells. The percentage of relative survival was calculated according to the equation previously described (28Choi Y.I. Jeon S.H. Jang J. Han S. Kim J.K. Chung H. Lee H.W. Chung H.Y. Park S.D. Seong R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2001; 98: 10267-10272Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Relative survival of DP thymocytes (%) = 100 × A/B, where A is the survival rate of DP thymocytes (%) in medium supplemented with reagents and B is the survival rate of DP thymocytes (%) in medium alone.RESULTSThe Level of SRG3 Expression Is Down-regulated by NO—It has been independently reported that NO inhibits GC-induced apoptosis in developing thymocytes (3Fehsel K. Kroncke K.D. Meyer K.L. Huber H. Wahn V. Kolb-Bachofen V. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2858-2865PubMed Google Scholar) and that there is a clear correlation between GC sensitivity and the expression level of SRG3 in T cells (18Han S. Choi H. Ko M. Choi Y.I. Sohn J.K. Kim D.H. Shin D. Chung H. Lee H.W. Kim J.B. Park S.D. Seong R.H. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 28Choi Y.I. Jeon S.H. Jang J. Han S. Kim J.K. Chung H. Lee H.W. Chung H.Y. Park S.D. Seong R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2001; 98: 10267-10272Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Based on these results, we hypothesized that NO might inhibit GC-induced apoptosis by repressing the expression of SRG3 in thymocytes. To test this possibility, we analyzed the effects of NO on the expression of SRG3 in murine DP thymoma cell line 16610D9 and normal thymocytes. Cells were treated with SNAP, and SRG3 protein levels were measured by Western blot analysis. The SRG3 protein level was decreased in a time-dependent manner after addition of SNAP to the culture media (Fig. 1A). At 18 h of SNAP treatment, SRG3 protein expression was decreased to ∼40% of control in 16619D9 cells and 20% in thymocytes. Similar results were obtained by Northern blot analysis showing that the SRG3 mRNA level was decreased in a time-dependent manner after SNAP treatment in 16610D9 cells (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that the SRG3 expression is down-regulated by NO pathway at the transcription level. To examine the effects of NO on the SRG3 promoter activity, we used pSRG3-Luc reporter construct containing a 1.1-kb SRG3 promoter fragment described previously (28Choi Y.I. Jeon S.H. Jang J. Han S. Kim J.K. Chung H. Lee H.W. Chung H.Y. Park S.D. Seong R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2001; 98: 10267-10272Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). 16610D9 cells were transiently transfected with pSRG3-Luc by electroporation, treated with various concentrations of SNAP, and subjected to reporter activity assay. Treatment of the transfected cells with SNAP resulted in the suppression of the SRG3 promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1C). To eliminate the possibility that potential secondary metabolites other than NO derived from SNAP might effect the SRG3 expression, we used a SNAP solution that was allowed to fully decompose for 1 week and found that there was no significant effect on the SRG3 protein levels and promoter activity (data not shown). These results suggest that NO reduces the expression of SRG3 in 16610D9 cells and thymocytes by repressing its promoter activity.NO Inhibits the SRG3 Expression by Redox Regulation—A classic mechanism for NO-mediated gene regulation is the cGMP-dependent pathway. NO activates the soluble guanylyl cyclase to produce cGMP, which acts as a second messenger (30Chung H.T. Pae H.O. Choi B.M. Billiar T.R. Kim Y.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 1075-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 31Genaro A.M. Hortelano S. Alvarez A. Martinez C. Bosca L. J. Clin.

Cell. 1994; 79: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). However, it has also been found that many other targets (e.g. caspases, zinc finger proteins such as Sp1, EGR-1, mRNA-binding proteins) are affected by redox regulation of NO (31Genaro A.M. Hortelano S. Alvarez A. Martinez C. Bosca L. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1884-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated to determine in which pathways NO represses the SRG3 expression. For this, we analyzed the effects of SNAP and the cGMP analog, 8-bromo-cGMP, on the activity of the SRG3 promoter. The SRG3 promoter activity was significantly inhibited by SNAP treatment (49% of control), but this inhibitory effect was not notably observed in cells treated with the cGMP (Fig. 2A). Therefore, it appears that NO represses SRG3 promoter activity by a cGMP-independent mechanism. Meanwhile, It is well known that the reducing agent DTT effectively restores the thiol modification induced via redox regulation by NO (6Kim Y.M. Talanian R.V. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31138-31148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar, 29Garban H.J. Bonavida B. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). To determine whether the repression of SRG3 by NO is mediated by a redox control, 16610D9 cells were treated with SNAP (750 μm) for 5 h after transfection with pSRG3-Luc and then treated with 1 mm DTT. In these cells, the reduced SRG3 promoter activity caused by NO was significantly restored (SNAP, 49% versus SNAP/DTT, 78%) (Fig. 2A). However, the addition of Me2SO as control had no effect on the inhibition of SRG3 promoter activity by NO. Moreover, we analyzed SRG3 protein expression under the same conditions. In agreement with the reporter gene assays, the level of SRG3 protein was not reduced by cGMP treatment, and the repression of SRG3 expression by NO was restored when DTT was added after SNAP treatment (Fig. 2B). These observations suggest that the inhibition of SRG3 promoter activity by NO occurs through the redox regulation of NO.Fig. 2The expression of SRG3 is inhibited by redox regulation of NO.A, 16610D9 cells were transfected with the pSRG3-Luc reporter construct and were treated with vehicle alone (Me2SO (DMSO)), 750 μm SNAP, 1 mm 8-bromo-cGMP, or 1 m m DTT for 13 h. To test the effect of redox regulation, the cells were treated with SNAP for 5 h following addition of DTT and incubated for 8 h further. The results are from three independent experiments each in triplicate. B, 16619D9 cells were treated with SNAP, cGMP, or DTT as described in A. Each cell lysate was analyzed by Western blotting with anti-SRG3 and anti-Lck antisera. Results are plotted as relative density of SRG3 to Lck.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Repression of SRG3 Expression by NO Occurs through the Inhibition of Sp1 Binding in the SRG3 Promoter—A characteristic feature of many transcription factors is their remarkable redox sensitivity (31Genaro A.M. Hortelano S. Alvarez A. Martinez C. Bosca L. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1884-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Numerous studies have analyzed the regulatory effect of NO on mammalian transcription factors such as AP-1, NF-κB, Sp1, Egr-1, YY1, the vitamin D3 receptor, and the retinoid X receptor (30Chung H.T. Pae H.O. Choi B.M. Billiar T.R. Kim Y.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 1075-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 31Genaro A.M. Hortelano S. Alvarez A. Martinez C. Bosca L. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1884-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Because NO inhibited SRG3 expression by redox regulation (Fig. 2), it was assumed that NO might inhibit SRG3 promoter activity by modulating the activity of the transcription factors that bind to the SRG3 promoter. By sequence analysis of the 1.1-kb SRG3 promoter fragment, we found a potential binding site for YY1 and four putative sites for Sp1 zinc finger transcription factors (Fig. 3A). Zinc finger proteins have been suggested to be primary targets of NO-induced disruption of their functional structures (28Choi Y.I. Jeon S.H. Jang J. Han S. Kim J.K. Chung H. Lee H.W. Chung H.Y. Park S.D. Seong R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2001; 98: 10267-10272Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To investigate any specific roles played by these factors during the repression of the SRG3 promoter activity by NO, we performed a systematic deletion analysis of the SRG3 promoter, removing binding sites of these transcription factors as shown in Fig. 3A. D1 contains four Sp1 binding sites but lacks the YY1 binding site, and D2 contains only the two 3′ Sp1 binding sites. All DNA fragments were linked to"

When TBP is not bound to promoters, it sequesters its DNA binding domain through dimerization. Promoter assembly factors therefore might be required to dissociate TBP into productively binding monomers. Here we show that Saccharomyces cerevisiae Brf1 induces TBP dimers to dissociate. The high affinity TBP binding domain of Brf1 is not sufficient to promote TBP dimer dissociation but in addition requires the TFIIB homology domain of Brf1. A model is proposed to explain how two distinct functional domains of Brf1 work in concert to dissociate TBP into monomers.

In higher eukaryotes, there are two main pathways of assembling a pol III transcription complex, which are governed in large part by distinct promoter elements located either upstream or downstream of the transcriptional start site (1Willis I.M.

In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, one major assembly pathway exists, and it involves the binding of TFIIIC to promoter elements internal to tRNA genes.

It is a saddle shaped protein having aminoand carboxyl-terminal stirrups and a concave/convex surface (11Kim Y. Geiger J.H. Hahn S. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1993; 365: 512-520Google Scholar, 12Kim J.L. Nikolov D.B. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 365: 520-527Google Scholar). TBP binds to a TATA box promoter element when it is present. However, most pol III genes with an internal promoter lack a TATA box. TBP is delivered to the upstream region of these promoters by Brf1, and Brf1 is recruited by TFIIIC (13Huet J. Conesa C. Manaud N. Chaussivert N. Sentenac A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3433-3439Google Scholar, 14Chaussivert N. Conesa C. Shaaban S. Sentenac A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15353-15358Google Scholar, 15White R.J. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 1041-1053Google Scholar). The amino-terminal half of Brf1 is homologous to the pol II general transcription factor TFIIB (16Lopez-De Leon A. Librizzi M. Puglia K. Willis I.M. Cell. 1992; 71: 211-220Google Scholar, 17Colbert T. Hahn S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1940-1949Google Scholar, 18Buratowski S. Zhou H. Cell. 1992; 71: 221-230Google Scholar). TFIIB binds to TBP along its carboxyl-terminal stirrup, pinning it to DNA (19Nikolov D.B. Chen H. Halay E.D. Usheva A.A. Hisatake K. Lee D.K. Roeder R.G. Burley S.K. Nature. 1995; 377: 119-128Google Scholar). In contrast to TFIIB, the TFIIB homology domain of Brf1 has not been shown to independently bind TBP. Where or whether it interacts with TBP is largely unknown. Some evidence places it near the carboxyl-terminal stirrup of TBP (20Kassavetis G.A. Kumar A. Ramirez E. Geiduschek E.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5587-5599Google Scholar, 21Persinger J. Sengupta S.M. Bartholomew B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5218-5234Google Scholar). The amino-terminal domain of Brf1 interacts with the τ131 subunit of TFIIIC as well as the C34 subunit of pol III (14Chaussivert N. Conesa C. Shaaban S. Sentenac A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15353-15358Google Scholar, 22Khoo B. Brophy B. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2879-2890Google Scholar). This domain also plays an important role in open complex formation (23Hahn S. Roberts S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 719-730Google Scholar, 24Kassavetis G.A. Han S. Naji S. Geiduschek E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17912-17917Google Scholar), the stage at which the template and transcribed strands are separated in preparation for transcription initiation. The carboxyl-terminal half of Brf1 is unrelated to TFIIB but is conserved among Brf proteins. A portion of the carboxyl-terminal half (437–506) of Brf1 binds with high affinity to the convex surface of TBP, snaking along the “top” of TBP and down its amino-terminal stirrup (25Juo Z.S. Kassavetis G.A. Wang J. Geiduschek E.P. Sigler P.B. Nature. 2003; 422: 534-539Google Scholar). TBP self-associates into dimers and possibly higher order structures through its concave DNA binding surface and carboxyl-terminal stirrup (26Taggart A.K. Pugh B.F.

In vivo, TBP dimerization might play an important role in preventing unregulated expression of quiescent pol II genes (30Jackson-Fisher A.J. Chitikila C. Mitra M. Pugh B.F. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 717-727Google Scholar, 37Kou H. Irvin J.D. Huisinga K.L. Mitra M. Pugh B.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3186-3201Google Scholar, 39Kou H. Pugh B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20966-20973Google Scholar). Mutations in TBP that disrupt TBP dimerization cause increased expression of lowly expressed genes, suggesting that dimer dissociation is at least partly rate-limiting in the expression of these genes. Dimer dissociation does not appear to be rate-limiting at highly expressed genes, presumably because of direct or indirect alleviation of TBP auto-inhibition by transcription factors. Indeed, the pol II transcription factor TFIIA stimulates TBP/TATA interactions in part through dissociation of TBP dimers (29Coleman R.A. Taggart A.K.P. Burma S. Chicca II, J.J. Pugh B.F. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 451-457Google Scholar). Because TBP homodimerization is an intrinsic property of TBP, any polymerase system that utilizes TBP is expected to be endowed with an activity that dissociates TBP dimers. Here we explore the possibility that Brf1, the primary TBP-interacting protein within the pol III transcription system, inhibits TBP dimerization when it engages TBP. We explore the mechanism by which Brf1 affects TBP dimerization by examining which domains of Brf1 are important for this reaction and whether Brf1 can bind TBP dimers and induce their dissociation. Our results suggest that Brf1 binds to TBP dimers and induces their dissociation. The presence of this activity in Brf1 suggests that TBP dimers are a physiological target of the pol III transcription machinery. Construction of Brf1 Deletion Derivatives—Escherichia coli plasmids expressing polyhistidine-tagged Brf1 derivatives were created by PCR amplification of regions of the BRF1 gene encoding 1–596 (full length), 1–262, 263–596, and 263–431. For the 1–596 and 1–262 constructs, the 5′ primers contained an XhoI site and the 3′ primers contained a ClaI site at the ends of the amplified fragments. Restriction sites, which follow, are underlined. 1–596 and 1–262 utilized the following upstream primer (5′-AGCATAATCTCGAGATGCCAGTGTGTAAGA-3′) and downstream primers (5′-ATGATGATCGATTTACCTAAACAAACCGTCAA-3′ and 5′-AGCCTTATCGATTTAGAATTCGTTCAACCGTT-3′). 263–596 and 263–431 contained an NdeI site in the 5′ primer (5′-CGTGAGC TCATATGAAAAATACA AAGGCTGCTAA-3′). The 3′ primer contained a ClaI site at the ends of the amplified fragment and contained the following sequences: 263–596, 5′-CTGAGTGCATCGATTTACCTAAACAAACCG-3′ and 263–431, 5′-TGGGTCATCGATTTAAGAGTAACCATCAATGGCATCT-3′. The PCR-amplified deletions were inserted in frame with the polyhistidine coding sequence of pEt-16b. The integrity of the entire open reading frame was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Protein Purification—Polyhistidine-tagged yeast TBP, GST-180C, and GST-181C were purified as described (37Kou H. Irvin J.D. Huisinga K.L. Mitra M. Pugh B.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3186-3201Google Scholar). Untagged yeast TBP was purified as described (30Jackson-Fisher A.J. Chitikila C. Mitra M. Pugh B.F. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 717-727Google Scholar). Polyhistidine-tagged Brf1 derivatives were purified as follows. Recombinant E. coli (BL21) cells (1.5 liter) were grown in YT medium (15 g of bactotryptone, 15 g of yeast extract, 7.5 g of NaCl, 3 ml of 1 m NaOH) containing 0.2 g of ampicillin per liter at 37 °C to an optical density at 595 nm (OD595) of 0.7 and were induced with 20 mg of isopropylthio-β-d-galactoside per liter for 3 h at 37 °C. Additional ampicillin was added upon induction. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, resuspended in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm potassium chloride, 12.5 mm magnesium chloride, 10% glycerol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cells were thawed and mixed with 0.8 mg of lysozyme per ml for 10 min at 4 °C and with 0.2% IGEPAL CA-630 for 5 min. Extracts were sonicated to reduce viscosity and then centrifuged in an SS34 rotor (RC5C centrifuge) at 15,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were removed and pellets were transferred to a type A Dounce homogenizer and resuspended in H.35 buffer (20% glycerol, 2 mm magnesium chloride, 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 350 mm potassium chloride, 1% sodium hydroxide, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% IGEPAL CA-630) and centrifuged in an SS34 rotor (RC5C centrifuge) at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was again removed and the pellet was transferred to a type A Dounce homogenizer, washed with H.35 buffer, and centrifuged in an SS34 rotor (RC5C centrifuge) at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed and inclusion bodies containing Brf1 were extracted from the pellet with G6 buffer (6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 100 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, and 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and centrifuged in an SS34 rotor (RC5C centrifuge) at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was bound in a batch solution to TALON resin (Clontech) overnight at 4 °C. After incubation, the resin was washed in batch with G6 buffer. The resin was transferred to a column, and the protein was eluted in fractions with elution buffer (6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 500 mm imidazole, and 250 μl of protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)). Renaturation of the protein in solution was achieved through dialysis against 20 mm Tris acetate (80% cation), 200 mm potassium chloride, 2 mm magnesium chloride, 20% glycerol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1% IGEPAL CA-630 to lower the guanidine concentration to less than 0.1 m. Brf1 aliquots were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. Chemical Cross-linking Assay—Reactions were performed in buffer A (20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 4 mm magnesium chloride, 4 mm spermidine, 0.1 mm EDTA, 75 mm potassium glutamate, 50 pg/μl heparin, 0.025% IGEPAL CA-630, and 5% glycerol) in a volume of 10 μlat30 °C. The concentrations of protein and DNA are indicated in the figure legends. Reactions shown in Figs. 1 and 4 contained 10 mm Tris acetate pH 7.5, 1 mm magnesium chloride, 4 mm spermidine, 0.1 mm EDTA, 100 mm potassium chloride, 0.05% IGEPAL CA-630, and 10% glycerol. Reactions shown in Fig. 5 contained 20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 4 mm magnesium chloride, 4 mm spermidine, 0.1 mm EDTA, 60 mm potassium glutamate, 15 mm potassium chloride, 50 pg/μl heparin, 0.01% IGEPAL CA-630, 5% glycerol, and 110 nm bovine serum albumin. (These slightly different conditions reflect differences in component concentrations present in the protein preparations.) Cross-linking was initiated by the addition of 0.1 mm bis(maleimido)hexane (BMH) and 9% dimethylsulfoxide. Mock reactions contained only dimethyl sulfoxide. Reactions were quenched with 10 μl of 2× PSB (250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 6% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 20% glycerol, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue) 90 s after the addition of BMH.Fig. 4Brf1 binds to TBP dimers.A, yeast TBP was cross-linked into dimers using BMH, quenched with β-mercaptoethanol, and dialyzed to remove the β-mercaptoethanol. Cross-linked TBP (110 nm) was incubated for 1 h at 0 °C with nickel-Sepharose that either lacked (lane 2) or contained (lane 3) 100 nm Brf1, which was retained on the resin by virtue of its polyhistidine tag. The resin was washed and TBP was analyzed by immunoblotting. The input (25%) is shown in lane 1. B, yeast TBP (110 nm) was incubated for 1 h at 0 °C with nickel-Sepharose that either contained (lane 1) or lacked (lanes 2 and 3) 100 nm Brf1. The resins were then washed, treated with BMH, and then analyzed for TBP by immunoblotting. In lane 3, the wash step was omitted, and 25% of the sample was loaded. The migration of TBP dimers is denoted by XL and uncross-linked TBP by un-XL.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 5Brf1 induces TBP dimers to dissociate.A, 55 nm TBP was incubated with 110 nm of either mutant TATA (lanes 1 and 2) or TATA (lanes 3–13) oligonucleotide at 22 °C for the indicated time. Oligonucleotides were 28 base pairs and contained either a strong TATA box TATAAAAG or mutant version TAAGAAAG (43Shen Y. Kassavetis G.A. Bryant G.O. Berk A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1692-1700Google Scholar). Similar reactions were preformed in B except the DNA was replaced by either buffer (lanes 1 and 2) or 110 nm Brf1 (lanes 3–13). BMH (1 mm) was then added for 15 s at 30 °C and then quenched with 2× PSB. Cross-linked TBP dimers and uncross-linked TBP were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and TBP analyzed by immunoblotting. Representative data are shown with the uncross-linked TBP signal shown at a low autoradiographic exposure, which being in the linear response range was used for quantification.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In Fig. 5 the fraction of cross-linked TBP was determined from densitometric scans of autoradiographs. Local background was subtracted, and the data were normalized to total TBP recovered. Data from quadruplicate assays were plotted as a function of time and globally fit to the equation Sx = ΔSe–kt + Sbkd, using Kaleidagraph software. Sx is the normalized data. ΔS is the computer-fitted change in total signal during the reaction timecourse, and Sbkd is the computer-fitted background at equilibrium. The data were converted to a reaction coordinate by the algebraic equation: reaction coordinate = (Sx – Sbkd)/ΔS. GST Pull-down Assay—Reactions using GST-180C were performed in buffer A. Reactions using GST-181C contained 20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 3.25 mm magnesium chloride, 10.7% glycerol, 122 mm potassium chloride, 48 mm potassium glutamate, 0.05% IGEPAL CA-630, 0.038 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg heparin per ml, 97.7 μg bovine serum albumin per ml, and 4 mm spermidine. Brf1 derivatives, polyhistidine-tagged TBP, and GST-180C, GST-181C, or GST bound to glutathione-agarose resin were used at concentrations indicated in the legends to Fig. 1, C and D, and Fig. 3. All reactions were performed in a volume of 450 μl. Reactions were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with mixing. Resins were centrifuged briefly and supernatant was discarded. Resins were washed once with 500 μl of buffer A, and the resin was collected by centrifugation. Bound proteins were eluted with 2× PSB and nonspecific carrier protein and subjected to SDS-PAGE. TBP was probed by immunoblotting with TBP antibodies. Reactions were performed at least three times, and representative data are shown. Brf1-TBP Interaction Assay—Brf1 derivatives and polyhistidinetagged TBP were incubated together for 1 h on ice in 10 mm Tris acetate (80% cation, pH 8.0), 1 mm magnesium chloride, 10% glycerol, 100 mm potassium chloride, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 0.05 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.5 mm sodium metabisulfite, 2.5 mm benzamidine. The reaction mixture was then added to a 20-μl bed volume of nickel-Sepharose equilibrated to the same buffer, incubated at room temperature for 1 min, washed with 20 mm imidazole in cross-linking buffer, and eluted with 500 mm imidazole in 2× PSB. Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—S. cerevisiae strains LSF2, LSF4, and LSF6 strains were obtained from David Brow (University of Wisconsin, Madison) and are described elsewhere (41Eschenlauer J.B. Kaiser M.W. Gerlach V.L. Brow D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3015-3026Google Scholar). These strains carry plasmids pSE358 (vector only), yCpCCs6 (snr6ΔBB), and yCpCH6 (SNR6), respectively. All strains carry yCP50 containing Ψ-WT SNR6. The snr6::LEU2 locus in each strain was converted to snr6::kanMX via standard homologous recombination (42Guldener U. Heck S. Fielder T. Beinhauer J. Hegemann J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2519-2524Google Scholar) to create strains SJZ2, SJZ4, and SJZ6, respectively. This freed up the LEU2 marker to be used in selecting the TBP plasmids. The primers used for homologous recombination were 5′-GAGGGTGAAAAAGCCGCTACTGGATTTCATAAAACCGAGACTGATTCAGGCGCATAGGCCACTAGTGGATCTG-3′, corresponding to 50 bp downstream of SNR6 (+909 to –959 relative to start site), and 5′-GCGAGCATGATAGTTCTCAAGATGCAATAGCAACGATGGACGTTGTTAAA CAGCTGAAGCTTCGTACGC-3′, corresponding to 50 bp upstream of SNR6 (–999 to –949 relative to start site). Plasmids expressing “null,” V161R, and V161E derivatives of TBP under control of the GAL10 promoter are pCALF-T(M1stop)(GAL10), pCALF-T(V161R)(GAL10), and pCALF(V161E)(GAL10), respectively, and are described elsewhere (30Jackson-Fisher A.J. Chitikila C. Mitra M. Pugh B.F. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 717-727Google Scholar). Each was transformed into SJZ4. pCALF-T(M1stop)(GAL10) was also transformed into SJZ2 and SJZ6. 100-ml cultures were grown at 30 °C in complete synthetic medium-Leu-Trp-Ura plus 3% raffinose to an OD600 of ∼0.6, and then were either induced with 2% galactose or mock treated for 2 h. Following induction, cells were harvested and total RNA was extracted with hot acidic phenol. Approximately 5 μg of total RNA was treated with DNase I and then subjected to first strand cDNA synthesis for 2 h at 42 °C in 20-μl reactions with a primer (P1) common to Ψ-WT SNR6 and SNR6 or its derivative, snr6ΔBB. Following reverse transcription, 1, 0.1, and 0.01% of each cDNA sample was added to two separate reactions for PCR amplification using the common P1 primer and primer P2 (specific to Ψ-WT SNR6) or primer P3 (specific to SNR6 and snr6ΔBB). Primer sequences include the following: P1, 5′-AAAACGAAATAAATCTCTTTG-3′; P2, 5′-ATCTTCGGATCATTTGG-3′; P3, 5′-GAAGTAACCCTTCGTG-3′. PCR was performed for 25 cycles at 52 °C annealing temperature. Ψ-WT PCR reactions and test reactions were combined and electrophoresed onto 15% polyacrylamide Tris-acetate-EDTA gels. Bands were detected with ethidium bromide staining, and quantification was done with NIH Image software. Local background intensity was subtracted from each band intensity and normalized to Ψ-WT. Brf1 Inhibits TBP Dimerization—Previously we employed two distinct assays to measure TBP dimerization, chemical cross-linking and a GST pull-down assay (28Jackson-Fisher A.J. Burma S. Portnoy M. Schneeweis L. Coleman R.A. Mitra M. Chitikila C. Pugh B.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11340-11348Google Scholar, 31Coleman R.A. Pugh B.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7221-7226Google Scholar, 37Kou H. Irvin J.D. Huisinga K.L. Mitra M. Pugh B.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3186-3201Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A (lane 1), purified TBP cross-links into dimers in the presence of the cysteine-specific homobifunctional cross-linker BMH. However, increasing concentrations of purified recombinant Brf1 inhibited the cross-linking of yeast TBP dimers (lanes 2–4). Inhibition was observed at roughly equimolar concentrations of purified Brf1 and TBP. Nonspecific proteins failed to inhibit the cross-linking (not shown and Ref. 30Jackson-Fisher A.J. Chitikila C. Mitra M. Pugh B.F. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 717-727Google Scholar), indicating that Brf1 was not simply titrating out the cross-linker. In addition, we did not detect any cross-linking of TBP to Brf1, possibly reflecting that cysteines on Brf1 were at suboptimal distances from cysteines located on TBP. To address whether the inhibition was caused by Brf1 rather than some contaminant in the preparation, Brf1 was depleted with either Brf1 antibodies or mock depleted with nonspecific antibodies (Fig. 1B). As shown in lanes 5–7 of Fig. 1A, Brf1 depletion abolished the inhibitory effect, whereas the control depletion (lanes 8–10) gave the same level of inhibition as untreated Brf1. As a further control, TBP was titrated back into the inhibited reaction, restoring TBP dimerization (lanes 11–13), suggesting that Brf1 inhibition of TBP dimerization involved stoichiometric interactions. As a second measure of TBP dimerization, we used a GST pull-down assay in which the conserved DNA binding/dimerization core of TBP was fused to GST. Because we have found that human TBP tends to form more stable dimers in vitro than yeast TBP (37Kou H. Irvin J.D. Huisinga K.L. Mitra M. Pugh B.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3186-3201Google Scholar), the assay was performed with both the human (Fig. 1C) and yeast (Fig. 1D) core. In both cases, little or no full-length TBP was retained on the resin in the absence of the core TBP dimerization domain (Fig. 1, C and D) lane 1 versus 2). In both experiments, titration of purified Brf1 inhibited the pull down of TBP (Fig. 1, C and D, lanes 3 and 4), confirming that Brf1 inhibits TBP dimerization. Both the TFIIB Homology Domain and the Carboxyl-terminal Domain of Brf1 Are Required to Inhibit TBP Dimerization—To address the specificity of dimer inhibition by Brf1 and determine what structural domains on Brf1 are important, we constructed several previously described deletion mutants of Brf1 (Fig. 2A) (22Khoo B. Brophy B. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2879-2890Google Scholar). Region 1–262 corresponds to the TFIIB-homology domain, and region 263–596 corresponds to the TBP-binding carboxyl-terminal domain. A smaller region (263–431) with diminished affinity for TBP has also been described (22Khoo B. Brophy B. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2879-2890Google Scholar). These polyhistidine-tagged deletion derivatives of Brf1 were expressed and purified from recombinant E. coli (Fig. 2B). To verify their binding affinity for TBP, the Brf1 derivatives were immobilized on nickel-agarose resin and incubated with TBP. As shown in Fig. 2C, 263–596 had the highest affinity for TBP followed by full-length Brf1 and the other derivatives. This hierarchy of affinities is essentially identical to that described earlier (22Khoo B. Brophy B. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2879-2890Google Scholar). Next we addressed whether the various deletion derivatives of Brf1 could inhibit TBP dimerization. As shown in Fig. 3 using the human or yeast TBP core pull-down assay, we found that although full-length Brf1 inhibited TBP dimerization, none of the truncation mutants were inhibitory. Therefore, both the TFIIB-homology domain and the carboxyl-terminal TBP binding domain of Brf1 were required to inhibit TBP dimerization. We also mixed derivatives 1–262 and 263–596 and found that they did not inhibit TBP dimerization (data not shown). Thus, despite Brf1 (263–596) having a high affinity for TBP, it must be physically connected to the amino-terminal TFIIB-homology domain to inhibit TBP dimerization. The fact that individual or combined fragments of Brf1 failed to inhibit TBP dimerization indicated that the inhibitory effect of the full-length protein is unlikely to be caused by nonspecific binding of Brf1 to TBP. Brf1 Binds TBP Dimers—To explore the mechanism by which Brf1 might inhibit TBP dimerization, we first examined whether Brf1 could stably bind to TBP dimers or whether Brf1 binding and TBP dimerization were competitive events. Stabilization of TBP dimers was achieved by incubating full-length (and untagged) TBP with BMH, which covalently cross-links TBP into dimers. The quenched and dialyzed cross-linking reaction was then incubated with polyhistidine-tagged Brf1 bound to nickel-Sepharose. As shown in Fig. 4A, cross-linked (as well as uncross-linked) TBP bound to the Brf1 resin but not to resin alone, indicating that Brf1 binds TBP dimers. To verify that any Brf1 bound to TBP in this state (i.e. immobilized on a solid support) was still capable of inhibiting TBP dimerization, uncross-linked TBP was incubated with immobilized Brf1. The resin was washed to remove free TBP, and the proteins were subjected to BMH cross-linking. As shown in Fig. 4B (lane 1), TBP cross-linking was inhibited by Brf1 compared with a control reaction lacking Brf1 and omitting the wash step (lane 3). Taken together, these results suggest that Brf1 binds to TBP dimers and subsequently inhibits dimerization. Brf1 Induces TBP Dimer Dissociation—The second step in examining Brf1 inhibition of TBP dimerization was to determine whether Brf1 induces dimer dissociation or simply sequesters monomers as they dissociate. The intrinsic dissociation kinetics of TBP dimers was measured by incubating TBP with a 2-fold excess of a DNA oligonucleotide containing a TATA box as reported previously (28Jackson-Fisher A.J. Burma S. Portnoy M. Schneeweis L. Coleman R.A. Mitra M. Chitikila C. Pugh B.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11340-11348Google Scholar). At various times after addition of the TATA DNA, the dimerization state of TBP was assayed by BMH chemical cross-linking. Because the intrinsic rate of dimer dissociation is slow in comparison to the incubation time in a chemical cross-linker, the dimer dissociation rate can be measured accurately. As shown in Fig. 5A, TBP dimers dissociated with a t12 of ∼7 min. No net dissociation was observed in the presence of a mutant TATA oligonucleotide, indicating that the reaction was specific. The time course was then repeated in the presence of a 2-fold excess of Brf1. As shown in Fig. 5B, TBP dissociated with a t12 of ∼1 min, significantly faster than the intrinsic rate observed with the TATA oligonucleotide. This result suggests that Brf1 induces TBP dimer dissociation rather than simply trapping monomers. A Dimer Defective Mutant of TBP Is More Active on a Basal Pol III Promoter—Previously we have shown that a truncated pol II promoter lacking its upstream activating sequence and transcribed at a low basal level is stimulated by TBP dimer/DNA mutants (30Jackson-Fisher A.J. Chitikila C. Mitra M. Pugh B.F. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 717-727Google Scholar). In contrast, highly active promoters are inhibited by these mutants. The data suggest that TBP homodimerization contributes to transcriptional repression by blocking access of TBP to promoters. This inhibitory interaction is expected to be eliminated under conditions of activated transcription. A new rate-limiting step such as TBP/TATA stability might dictate transcriptional output, and this would be susceptible to mutations along the DNA binding surface of TBP, as was observed. To test whether TBP dimer dissociation is potentially relevant to pol III transcription in vivo, we examined the effect of a dimer/DNA defective mutant TBP(V161R) on transcription of the pol III-transcribed SNR6 gene. Like most pol III genes, SNR6 is highly transcribed in growing yeast cells, and so it is not expected to be stimulated by TBP(V161R). In an effort to mimic the basal pol II system that was stimulated by TBP(V161R), we used a variant of SNR6 that lacked one of its critical control elements, the B box (41Eschenlauer J.B. Kaiser M.W. Gerlach V.L. Brow D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3015-3026Google Scholar, 45Kaiser M.W. Brow D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11398-11405Google Scholar). snr6(ΔBB) is transcribed at ∼10% of the level of SNR6 and thus is significantly impaired in transcription. This allele does not support cell viability and thus must be accompanied by a wild type SNR6. The wild type SNR6 gene is modified (referred to as Ψ-WT) making it distinguishable in reverse transcriptase-PCR reactions from snr6(ΔBB) (41Eschenlauer J.B. Kaiser M.W. Gerlach V.L. Brow D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3015-3026Google Scholar, 45Kaiser M.W. Brow D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11398-11405Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6, when transcript levels are normalized to Ψ-WT, the presence of TBP(V161R) caused a modest but reproducible increase in expression of snr6(ΔBB). This level of increase was not reproduced in the presence of a different TBP mutant V161E, which shows defects in DNA binding but is less defective in dimerization than V161R (30Jackson-Fisher A.J. Chitikila C. Mitra M. Pugh B.F. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 717-727Google Scholar). The use of V161E helps control for effects caused by defects in DNA binding. This observation is consistent with the notion that although TBP dimer dissociation might not be rate-limiting for activated pol III transcription, potentially because of the activity of Brf1, it can be at least partially rate-limiting at pol III promoters when they are not activated. Through interactions with promoter-bound TFIIIC, Brf1 plays an important role in loading TBP onto the promoters of TATA-less tRNA and other pol III-transcribed small RNA-encoding genes. Inasmuch as TBP has a relatively high affinity for nonspecific DNA (46Coleman R.A. Pugh B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13850-13859Google Scholar) and in this capacity can assemble pol II transcription complexes, the cell is likely to employ a number of mechanisms to prevent this nonproductive and potentially detrimental assembly. Our previous studies (26Taggart A.K. Pugh B.F. Science. 1996; 272: 1331-1333Google Scholar, 30Jackson-Fisher A.J. Chitikila C. Mitra M. Pugh B.F. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 717-727Google Scholar, 37Kou H.

Irvin J.D. Basehoar A.D. Pugh B.F. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 871-882Google Scholar) suggest that TBP dimerization represents a physiologically important auto-inhibitory mechanism by which unregulated binding of TBP to DNA is prevented. If so, then there are likely to be mechanisms that dissociate TBP dimers as a prelude to productive binding. In the pol II system, we have found that TFIIA dissociates TBP dimers, thereby enhancing the binding of TBP to DNA (29Coleman R.A. Taggart A.K.P. Burma S. Chicca II, J.J. Pugh B.F. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 451-457Google Scholar). The regulation of TBP dimerization in the pol II system prompted us to examine whether the same was true in the pol III transcription machinery. Brf1 is a prime candidate to alleviate TBP dimerization because it directly binds TBP and is responsible for loading TBP onto pol III promoters. Our findings indicate that Brf1 binds to TBP dimers and accelerates the kinetics of dimer dissociation by a factor of at least seven. Strikingly, the high affinity carboxyl-terminal TBP binding domain of Brf1 is not sufficient to promote dimer dissociation but in addition requires that the TFIIB homology domain be attached. The carboxyl-terminal domain of Brf1 binds to the convex surface of TBP as defined by mutagenesis and x-ray crystallography (25Juo Z.S. Kassavetis G.A. Wang J. Geiduschek E.P. Sigler P.B. Nature. 2003; 422: 534-539Google Scholar, 43Shen Y. Kassavetis G.A. Bryant G.O. Berk A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1692-1700Google Scholar, 44Colbert T. Lee S. Schimmack G. Hahn S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1682-1691Google Scholar). The crystallographic structures of the Brf1 (437–506)-TBP-TATA and TBP dimer complexes indicate that TBP-Brf1 (437–506) interactions do not overlap with the TBP dimer interface. Brf1 (437–506) meanders along the upper convex and amino-terminal stirrup of TBP, whereas the TBP dimerization interface occupies its concave surface and carboxyl-terminal stirrup. Our finding that Brf1 (263–596) binds TBP but does not inhibit dimerization is consistent with these interactions. The carboxyl-terminal stirrup of TBP binds TFIIB within a TBP/DNA complex. Because TFIIB is homologous to the aminoterminal half of Brf1, it is possible that this portion of Brf1 binds TBP in a similar manner. Potential interactions of the TFIIB homology domain along the TBP carboxyl-terminal stirrup have been reported (30Jackson-Fisher A.J. Chitikila C. Mitra M. Pugh B.F. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 717-727Google Scholar, 37Kou H. Irvin J.D. Huisinga K.L. Mitra M. Pugh B.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3186-3201Google Scholar). Other studies, which demonstrate that the primary interactions of Brf1 are along the amino-terminal stirrup, did not address the location of the TFIIB homology domain (43Shen Y. Kassavetis G.A. Bryant G.O. Berk A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1692-1700Google Scholar, 44Colbert T. Lee S. Schimmack G. Hahn S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1682-1691Google Scholar). Fig. 7 illustrates one speculative mechanism by which Brf1 might induce TBP dimers to dissociate. Brf1 is proposed to make primary contact along the amino-terminal stirrup and convex surface of TBP dimers, away from the dimer interface. The amino-terminal TFIIB homology domain of Brf1 induces TBP dimers to dissociate through interactions that might overlap with the dimerization interface of TBP. One possible interaction site might be the TBP carboxyl-terminal stirrup if TFIIB is a precedent. Interactions of the TFIIB-homology domain anywhere near or along the concave surface of TBP, including the amino-terminal stirrup, could in principle dissociate dimers (illustrated as such in Fig. 7 for simplicity). This aspect of the model remains quite speculative because it is not known exactly where the TFIIB homology domain binds on TBP if it binds TBP at all. Any interactions of TFIIB along the concave surface would likely need to be removed upon DNA binding along this region. Potential release of the TFIIB-homology domain when TBP binds DNA could allow this domain to make contact with downstream DNA regions and facilitate open complex formation (23Hahn S. Roberts S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 719-730Google Scholar, 24Kassavetis G.A. Han S. Naji S. Geiduschek E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17912-17917Google Scholar).
