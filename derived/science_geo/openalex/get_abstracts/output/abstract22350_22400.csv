https://openalex.org/W2056025481,"L-glutamate, the principal excitatory transmitter in the brain, gates ion channels mediating fast neurotransmission. Subunit components of two related classes of glutamate receptor channels have been characterized by cDNA cloning and shown to carry either an arginine or a glutamine residue in a defined position of their putative channel-forming segment. The arginine residue in this segment profoundly alters, and dominates, the properties of ion flow, as demonstrated for one channel class. We now show that the genomic DNA sequences encoding the particular channel segment of all subunits harbor a glutamine codon (CAG), even though an arginine codon (CGG) is found in mRNAs of three subunits. Multiple genes and alternative exons were excluded as sources for the arginine codon; hence, we propose that transcripts for three subunits are altered by RNA editing. This process apparently edits subunit transcripts of the two glutamate receptor classes with different efficiency and selectivity."
https://openalex.org/W2028143521,"Serial human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) isolates were obtained from five individuals with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) who changed therapy to 2',3'-dideoxyinosine (ddI) after at least 12 months of treatment with 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (zidovudine, AZT). The in vitro sensitivity to ddI decreased during the 12 months following ddI initiation, whereas AZT sensitivity increased. Analysis of the reverse transcriptase coding region revealed a mutation associated with reduced sensitivity to ddI. When this mutation was present in the same genome as a mutation known to confer AZT resistance, the isolates showed increased sensitivity to AZT. Analysis of HIV-1 variants confirmed that the ddI resistance mutation alone conferred ddI and 2',3'-dideoxycytidine resistance, and suppressed the effect of the AZT resistance mutation. The use of combination therapy for HIV-1 disease may prevent drug-resistant isolates from emerging."
https://openalex.org/W2017830084,"Previously we demonstrated that transgenic mice expressing mutant basal epidermal keratin genes exhibited a phenotype resembling a group of autosomal dominant human skin disorders known as epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS). EBS diseases affect approximately 1: 50,000 and are of unknown etiology, although all subtypes exhibit blistering arising from basal cell cytolysis. We now demonstrate that two patients with spontaneous cases of Dowling-Meara EBS have point mutations in a critical region in one (K14) of two basal keratin genes. To demonstrate function, we engineered one of these point mutations in a cloned human K14 cDNA, and showed that a K14 with an Arg-125----Cys mutation disrupted keratin network formation in transfected keratinocytes and perturbed filament assembly in vitro. Since we had previously shown that keratin network perturbation is an essential component of EBS diseases, these data suggest that the basis for the phenotype in this patient resides in this point mutation."
https://openalex.org/W1999503127,"Dihydropyridine-sensitive voltage-dependent L-type calcium channels are critical to excitation-secretion and excitation-contraction coupling. The channel molecule is a complex of the main, pore-forming subunit α1 and four additional subunits: α2, δ, β, and γ (α2 and δ are encoded by a single messenger RNA). The α1 subunit messenger RNA alone directs expression of functional calcium channels in Xenopus oocytes, and coexpression of the α2/δ and β subunits enhances the amplitude of the current. The α2, δ, and γ subunits also have pronounced effects on its macroscopic characteristics, such as kinetics, voltage dependence of activation and inactivation, and enhancement by a dihydropyridine agonist. In some cases, specific modulatory functions can be assigned to individual subunits, whereas in other cases the different subunits appear to act in concert to modulate the properties of the channel."
https://openalex.org/W2006874202,"In a transgenic mouse model, dermal fibrosarcomas develop in a pathway comprised of at least three stages: mild fibromatosis, aggressive fibromatosis, and fibrosarcoma. The latter two stages are highly vascularized when compared with both the normal dermis and the initial mild lesion. Analysis of cell cultures derived from biopsies of these lesions has revealed that basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is synthesized in all three stages and in normal dermal fibroblasts derived from the same mice. Unexpectedly, there is a change in the localization of bFGF from its normal cell-associated state to extracellular release in the latter two stages, which is concomitant both with the neovascularization seen in vivo and with the tumorigenicity of these cell lines. Thus, in this multistep tumorigenesis pathway there appears to be a discrete switch to the angiogenic phenotype that correlates with the export of bFGF, a known angiogenic factor."
https://openalex.org/W2073084525,Bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) continues to be the only protein for which a detailed pathway of folding has been described. Previous studies led to the conclusion that nonnative states are well populated in the oxidative folding of BPTI. This conclusion has broadly influenced efforts to understand protein folding. The population of intermediates present during the folding of BPTI has been reexamined by modern separation techniques. It was found that all well-populated folding intermediates contain only native disulfide bonds. These data emphasize the importance of native protein structure for understanding protein folding.
https://openalex.org/W2073998635,"Functional maturation of B lymphocytes correlates with expression of the B lineage-specific cell surface glycoprotein CD22. Two CD22 polypeptides have been characterized and suggested to play a role in B cell-B cell interaction as well as in B cell adhesion to monocytes. In this work we provide evidence that CD22 is directly involved in the cognate interaction between B and T cells. One of the two CD22 polypeptides, CD22 beta, interacts with a specific ligand on a subpopulation of CD4+ T cells. Our results suggest that the T cell ligand of CD22 is CD45RO, an isoform of the leukocyte common antigen class of phosphotyrosine phosphatases associated with the helper T cell phenotype. We further demonstrate that CD22 recognizes a second ligand, CD75, expressed predominantly on activated B cells and shown to be a cell surface alpha 2-6 sialyltransferase."

https://openalex.org/W2037812623,"CD62, also called PADGEM protein, GMP-140, or P-selectin, is a granule membrane protein of endothelial cells and platelets that is mobilized to the plasma membrane following exposure to mediators such as thrombin, histamine, complement components, or peroxides. Data presented to date suggest that one ligand of CD62 includes CD15 (Lewis x determinant) and sialic acid. We show here that sulfatides, heterogeneous 3-sulfated galactosyl ceramides, are an apparently unrelated ligand of CD62. Sulfatides are expressed on the plasma membrane of, and are excreted by, granulocytes, and constitute the principal ligand for CD62 on the plasma membrane of some tumor cells. CD62 binds to sulfatides adsorbed to plastic as avidly as it binds to myeloid or tumor cells. We find that granulocytes excrete sulfatides at a rate predicted to allow them to be rapidly released from CD62 once they have exited the bloodstream."
https://openalex.org/W1523026250,"We have used the human Lewis blood group fucosyltransferase cDNA and cross-hybridization procedures to isolate a human gene that encodes a distinct fucosyltransferase. Its DNA sequence predicts a type II transmembrane protein whose sequence is identical to 133 of 231 amino acids at corresponding positions within the catalytic domain of the Lewis fucosyltransferase. When expressed by transfection in cultured cell lines, this gene determines expression of a fucosyltransferase capable of efficiently utilizing N-acetyllactosamine to form the Lewis x determinant (Gal beta 1—-4[Fuc alpha 1—-3]GlcNAc). By contrast, biochemical and flow cytometry analyses suggest that the enzyme cannot efficiently utilize the type II acceptor NeuNAc alpha 2—-3Gal beta 1—-4GlcNAc, to form the sialyl Lewis x determinant. In Chinese hamster ovary cells, however, the enzyme can determine expression of the alpha 2—-3-sialylated, alpha 1—-3-fucosylated structure known as VIM-2, a putative oligosaccharide ligand for ELAM-1. Cell adhesion assays using VIM-2-positive, sialyl Lewis x-negative transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells indicate that surface expression of the VIM-2 determinant is not sufficient to confer ELAM-1-dependent adhesive properties upon the cells. These results demonstrate that substantial structural similarities can exist between mammalian glycosyltransferases with closely related enzymatic properties, thus facilitating isolation of their cognate genes by cross-hybridization methods. The results further suggest that cell surface expression of the VIM-2 determinant is not necessarily sufficient to mediate ELAM-1-dependent cell adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W2003888232,"A human intestinal intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) T cell line was established from jejunum to characterize the structure and function of the alpha beta T cell antigen receptors (TCRs) expressed by this population. Single-sided polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification cloning and quantitative PCR amplification of the TCR chains from the cell line and from fresh IELs demonstrated that IELs were oligoclonal. The IEL T cell line exhibited CD1-specific cytotoxicity and a dominant IEL T cell clone was CD1c-specific. Thus, human jejunal intraepithelial lymphocytes are oligoclonal and recognize members of the CD1 gene family."
https://openalex.org/W2028536221,"Activation of kainate receptors causes Co2+ influx into neurons, type-2 astrocytes, and O-2A progenitor cells. Agonist-activated Co2+ uptake can be performed using cultured cells or fresh tissue slices. Based on the pattern of response to kainate, glutamate, and quisqualate, three functionally different kainate-activated ion channels (K1, K2, and K3) can be discriminated. Co2+ uptake through the K1 receptor was only activated by kainate. Both kainate and glutamate activated Co2+ uptake through the K2 receptor. Co2+ uptake through the K3 receptor was activated by all three ligands: kainate, glutamate, and quisqualate. Co2+ uptake occurred through a nonselective cation entry pathway permeable to Co2+, Ca2+, and Mn2+. The agonist-dependent activation of divalent cation influx through different kainate receptors could be correlated with expression of certain kainate receptor subunit combinations. These results are indicative of kainate receptors that may contribute to excitatory amino acid-mediated neurotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W1550465180,"Abstract Bullous pemphigoid antigens are defined as the autoantigens in a blistering skin disease, bullous pemphigoid. One of them, a 230-kDa protein (BPAG1), is associated with hemidesmosomes, attachment complexes at the basal keratinocyte-lamina lucida interface within the dermal-epidermal basement membrane zone. The precise functions and cellular compartmentalization of BPAG1 are unknown. In this study, a human keratinocyte lambda gt11 cDNA library was screened for clones corresponding to BPAG1. The composite of overlapping cDNAs delineated 8,930 base pairs of nucleotide sequences that contained an open reading frame encoding 2,649 amino acids. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences predicted a putative signal peptide of 43 amino acids and the presence of a membrane-associated sequence of 17 amino acids. Several potential sites for N-glycosylation, as well as for protein kinase C or cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinase-mediated phosphorylation were identified. Three peptide segments were predicted to be highly antigenic, potentially serving as epitopes for the formation of autoantibodies. Eight repeat segments of 38 residues each with a high degree of homology with sequences in desmoplakin I, a component of desmosomal cytoplasmic plaques, were detected in the carboxyl-terminal end of the molecule. In addition, the presence of three subdomains characterized by heptad repeats predicted an alpha-helical coiled coil dimer structure in the central portion of the protein. These data suggest that BPAG1 may be a membrane-associated protein that plays a role in the attachment of basal keratinocytes to the underlying basement membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1578799040,"Insulin rapidly lowers serum insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) levels in vivo. In studies reported here, HEP G2 cells were used as a model system to investigate how insulin achieves this effect. When HEP G2 cells were incubated with 100 nM insulin for 6, 14, or 24 h, IGFBP-1 protein levels in conditioned medium fell to approximately 50% of control values. This apparently was due to a fall in the rate of IGFBP-1 protein synthesis, since HEP G2 cells incorporated 46% less [35S]methionine into IGFBP-1 during a 4-h incubation with 100 nM insulin. IGFBP-1 mRNA levels were similarly affected by 100 nM insulin, falling to 45% of control values after 2 h, and to 9% of control values after 4 h of incubation with this hormone. The fall in IGFBP-1 mRNA level is consistent with data from nuclear transcription assays. HEP G2 nuclei isolated from cells that were incubated with 100 nM insulin for 2 h synthesized only approximately 1/3 the number of IGFBP-1 transcripts as did control nuclei. Further evidence that insulin decreases IGFBP-1 gene transcription comes from transient transfections using chimeric IGFBP-1 promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene constructs. IGFBP-1 promoter activity fell to approximately 50% of control values when HEP G2 cells transfected with a construct containing the first 1205 base pairs of the IGFBP-1 promoter were incubated with 100 nM insulin for 6, 14, or 24 h. Insulin lowered both IGFBP-1 protein levels and promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner. A half-maximal effect was found at approximately 1 nM insulin and a maximal effect was found at approximately 10 nM insulin in each instance. Transfections with constructs containing smaller IGFBP-1 promoter fragments showed that the region spanning from 103 to 529 base pairs 5' to the IGFBP-1 mRNA cap site was necessary to demonstrate the inhibitory effect of insulin. These studies indicate that insulin lowers IGFBP-1 protein levels, at least in part, by rapidly decreasing the rate of IGFBP-1 gene transcription, and suggest that this insulin-mediated fall in transcription is conferred through a specific region of the IGFBP-1 promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1503847195,"The expression of the cystic fibrosis (CF) gene on its introduction into nonepithelial somatic cells has recently been shown to result in the appearance of distinctive low conductance chloride channels stimulated by cyclic AMP (Kartner, N., Hanrahan, J.W., Jensen, T.J., Naismith, A.L., Sun, S., Ackerley, C.A., Reyes, E.F., Tsui, L.-C., Rommens, J.M., Bear, C.E., and Riordan, J.R.

Since Xenopus oocytes provide a powerful system for ion channel characterization, we have examined whole cell and single channel currents in them after injection of cRNA to program the synthesis of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). This has enabled the direct demonstration that the cyclic AMP activation is mediated by protein kinase A and that CFTR is without effect on the endogenous calcium-activated chloride channels of the oocyte, which have been well characterized previously and widely used as reporters of the expression of G-protein-coupled receptors. These findings strengthen the argument that the CF gene codes for a novel regulated chloride channel rather than a regulatory protein which can modulate separate chloride channel molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1977609618,"Several growth factors originally characterized and named for their action on a variety of cells have more recently been suggested to be importantly involved in the development and maintenance of the nervous system. Acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) is a member of a family of seven structurally related polypeptide growth factors. The cells responsible for expression of aFGF in the nervous system of adult rats have been identified using an affinity-purified antibody to aFGF in immunohistochemical studies and synthetic oligonucleotide probes for in situ hybridization studies. High levels of aFGF expression were observed in motoneurons, primary sensory neurons, and retinal ganglion neurons. Glial cells did not express detectable amounts of aFGF. Confocal and electron microscopic analysis suggested that a large portion of aFGF immunoreactivity was associated with the cytoplasmic face of neuronal membranes, consistent with the hypothesis that aFGF is a sequestered growth factor."
https://openalex.org/W2083510837,Three-dimensional (3-D) structural models of RNA are essential for understanding of the cellular roles played by RNA. Such models have been obtained by a technique based on a constraint satisfaction algorithm that allows for the facile incorporation of secondary and other structural information. The program generates 3-D structures of RNA with atomic-level resolution that can be refined by numerical techniques such as energy minimization. The precision of this technique was evaluated by comparing predicted transfer RNA loop and RNA pseudoknot structures with known or consensus structures. The root-mean-square deviation (2.0 to 3.0 angstroms before minimization) between predicted and control structures reveal this system to be an effective method in modeling RNA.

Protoplasts from germ tubes of this fungus, when examined with patch-clamp electrodes, displayed the activities of a 600-picosiemen mechanosensitive ion channel. This channel passes a variety of cations, including Ca2+, and is blocked by Gd3+ at 50 micromolar. This channel could transduce the membrane stress induced by the leaf topography into an influx of ions, including Ca2+, that may trigger differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2018277025,"In order to understand how the hair cell's mechanoelectrical transduction channels are gated during mechanical stimulation, it is essential to determine their location with respect to the hair bundle's constituent stereocilia. We localized the transduction channels by focally blocking receptor currents with iontophoretically ejected gentamicin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic that acts as a reversible channel blocker. The drug was most effective when directed at the top of a hair bundle, whereas application at the bundle's bottom or at the cuticular plate had little or no effect. Computer simulations of blocking agreed with experimental data only when the transduction channels were hypothesized to occur near the bundle's top. These results confirm that the hair cell's transduction channels are located near the stereociliary tips."
https://openalex.org/W1545433620,"CD40/Bp50 B-cell receptor has been implicated as having an important function for the regulation of human B-cell growth and maturation as well as antigen-driven selection of tonsillar B-cells in germinal centers. The purpose of the present study was to examine the biochemical events triggered by the engagement of the CD40 receptor in human B-lineage lymphoid cells corresponding to discrete developmental stages of human B-cell ontogeny. The engagement of the CD40 receptor on pro-B-, pre-pre-B-, pre-B-, or activated mature B-cells but not on resting mature B-cells with the agonistic anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody G28-5 resulted in enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of four distinct phosphoproteins with molecular masses of 67, 72, 96, and 113 kDa and induced a rapid increase in the production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. Further, we have identified five electrophoretically distinct renaturable CD40-regulated serine/threonine-specific protein kinases (PK120, PK93, PK76, PK55, and PK48) that showed markedly increased in vitro activity after CD40 stimulation. Protein kinase C inhibitor 1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (H7) abrogated the stimulation of the in vitro activity of PK120, PK93, PK55, and PK48 and attenuated the stimulation of the in vitro activity of PK76 in response to the engagement of the CD40 receptor but did not influence the enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular substrates after CD40 stimulation. Notably, genistein and herbimycin A, two potent inhibitors of tyrosine-specific protein kinases, not only abrogated the CD40-induced enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation on the 67-, 72-, 96-, and 113-kDa substrates, but they also inhibited the CD40-induced stimulation of phosphoinositide turnover as well as the CD40-induced increase of the in vitro activity of renaturable serine/threonine-specific protein kinases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1520572979,"The 70-kDa neurofilament protein subunit (NF-L) is phosphorylated in vivo on at least three sites (L1 to L3) (Sihag, R. K. and Nixon, R. A. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 457-464). The turnover of phosphate groups on NF-L during axonal transport was determined after the neurofilaments in retinal ganglion cells were phosphorylated in vivo by injecting mice intravitreally with [32P]orthophosphate. Two-dimensional phosphopeptide maps of NF-L from optic axons of mice 10 to 90 h after injection showed that radiolabel decreased faster from peptides L2 and L3 than from L1 as neurofilaments were transported. To identify phosphorylation sites on peptide L2, axonal cytoskeletons were phosphorylated by protein kinase A in the presence of heparin. After the isolated NF-L subunits were digested with alpha-chymotrypsin, 32P-peptides were separated by high performance liquid chromatography on a reverse-phase C8 column. Two-dimensional peptide mapping showed that the alpha-chymotrypsin 32P-peptide accepting most of the phosphates from protein kinase A migrated identically with the in vivo-labeled phosphopeptide L2. The sequence of this peptide (S-V-R-R-S-Y) analyzed by automated Edman degradation corresponded to amino acid residues 51-56 of the NF-L sequence. A synthetic 13-mer (S-L-S-V-R-R-S-Y-S-S-S-S-G) corresponding to amino acid residues 49-61 of NF-L was also phosphorylated by protein kinase A. alpha-Chymotryptic digestion of the 13-mer generated a peptide which contained most of the phosphates and co-migrated with the phosphopeptide L2 on two-dimensional phosphopeptide maps. Edman degradation of the phosphorylated 13-mer identified serine residue 55 which is located within a consensus phosphorylation sequence for protein kinase A as the major site of phosphorylation. Since protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation influences intermediate filament assembly/disassembly in vitro, we propose that the phosphopeptide L2 region is a neurofilament-assembly domain and that the cycle of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of Ser-55 on NF-L, which occurs relatively early after subunit synthesis in vivo, regulaaes a step in neurofilament assembly or initial interactions during axonal transport."
https://openalex.org/W1600203168,"We have recently described the identification, isolation, and characterization of a factor, termed stem cell factor (SCF), which acts on primitive hematopoietic progenitors of the marrow. A soluble form of the factor was isolated from the conditioned medium of a rat cell line (Zsebo, K. M., Wypych, J., McNiece, I. K., Lu, H. S., Smith, K. A., Karkare, S. B., Sachdev, R.

A., Leslie, I., Wen, D., Lin, C.-H., Cupples, R. L., and Zsebo, K. M. (1990) Cell 63, 203-211). The cDNAs encode amino acids C-terminal to those found in the isolated natural form, including a putative transmembrane domain. This paper describes the structural characterization of soluble forms of recombinant human SCF purified from Escherichia coli (unglycosylated) and from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (glycosylated). Fluorescence emission spectra indicate that the single Trp residue is present in a hydrophobic environment. Circular dichroism and infrared spectroscopy indicate considerable secondary structure, including both alpha-helix and beta-sheet. Molecular weight determinations by sedimentation equilibrium show that the molecules are dimeric (noncovalently associated), and gel filtration analyses are consistent with this conclusion. The CHO cell-derived SCF is about 30% carbohydrate by weight, with both N-linked and O-linked sugar. The presence or absence of the carbohydrate does not influence the results of the various structural analyses."
https://openalex.org/W1527658233,"Na,K-ATPase and H,K-ATPase are the only members of the P-type ATPases in which a glycosylated beta-subunit is part of the purified active enzyme. In this study, we have followed the synthesis and the posttranslational processing of the beta-subunit of H,K-ATPase (beta HK) in Xenopus oocytes injected with beta HK cRNA and have tested whether it can act as a surrogate for the beta-subunit of Na,K-ATPase (beta NaK) to support the functional expression of Na,K-pumps. In Xenopus oocytes, beta HK is processed from an Endo H-sensitive 51-kDa coreglycosylated form to an Endo H-resistant 71-kDa fully glycosylated form. Similar to beta NaK, beta HK can stabilize and increase the trypsin resistance of alpha-subunits of Na,K-ATPase (alpha NaK). Finally, expression of beta HK together with alpha NaK leads to an increased number of ouabain binding sites at the plasma membrane accompanied by an increased Rb+ uptake and Na,K-pump current. Our data suggest that beta HK, similar to beta NaK, can assemble to alpha NaK, support the structural maturation and the intracellular transport of catalytic alpha NaK, and ultimately form active alpha NaK-beta HK complexes with Na,K-pump transport properties."
https://openalex.org/W1483353862,"It is recognized that insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) are bound to specific high-affinity insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins (IGFBPs). The role of IGFBPs in bone metabolism is not well established. The effect of recombinant human [Cys281]IGFBP-2 ([Cys281]rhIGFBP-2) on bone formation in 21-day-old fetal rat calvariae was investigated. [Cys281]rhIGFBP-2 was expressed in and purified from conditioned medium of a clonal Chinese hamster ovary cell line. IGF-I-stimulated cell proliferation was inhibited dose dependently by [Cys281]rhIGFBP-2, with half-maximal inhibition observed at 2 x 10(-8) M. Suppression of the IGF-I-stimulated DNA synthesis was observed at an apparent dose ratio of 1:10. [Cys281]rhIGFBP-2 (10(-6) M) also inhibited the basal incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA by up to 45%. Insulin-stimulated cell proliferation was not affected in the presence of the binding protein. In addition, [Cys281]rhIGFBP-2 inhibited bone collagen synthesis under basal and IGF-I-stimulated conditions. In contrast, [Cys281]rhIGFBP-2 did not alter the parathyroid hormone-stimulated bone cell proliferation rate. In conclusion, binding of hIGF-I to rhIGFBP-2 results in an inhibition of the actions of free IGF-I on bone cell replication and matrix synthesis. Parathyroid hormone-stimulated cell proliferation is not mediated by an increase in free IGFs."
https://openalex.org/W1493930141,"The inner membrane of liver and heart mitochondria possesses an anion uniport pathway, known as the inner membrane anion channel (IMAC). IMAC is inhibited by matrix Mg2+, matrix H+, N,N'-dicyclohexycarbodiimide, mercurials and amphiphilic amines such as propranolol. Most of these agents react with a number of different mitochondrial proteins and, therefore, more selective inhibitors have been sought. In this paper, we report the discovery of a new class of inhibitors, triorganotin compounds, which block IMAC completely. One of the most potent, tributyltin (TBT) inhibits malonate uniport via IMAC 95% at 0.9 nmol/mg. The only other mitochondrial protein reported to react with triorganotins, the F1F0ATPase, is inhibited by about 0.75 nmol/mg. The potency of inhibition of IMAC increases with hydrophobicity in the sequence trimethyltin much less than triethyltin much less than tripropyltin less than triphenyltin less than tributyltin; which suggests that the binding site is accessible from the lipid bilayer. It has long been established that triorganotins are anionophores able to catalyze Cl-/OH- exchange; however, TBT is able to inhibit Cl- and NO3- transport via IMAC at doses below those required to catalyze rapid rates of Cl-/OH- exchange. Consistent with previous reports, the data indicate that about 0.8 nmol of TBT per mg of mitochondrial protein is tightly bound and not available to mediate Cl-/OH- exchange. We have also shown that the mercurials, p-chloromercuribenzene sulfonate and mersalyl, which only partially inhibit Cl- and NO3- transport can increase the IC50 for TBT 10-fold. This effect appears to result from a reaction at a previously unidentified mercurial reactive site. The inhibitory dose is also increased by raising the pH and inhibition by TBT can be reversed by S2- and dithiols but not by monothiols."
https://openalex.org/W1675084991,"A novel compositional overlap between membranes of exocrine and endocrine granules, synaptic vesicles, and a liver Golgi fraction has been identified using a monoclonal antibody (SG7C12) raised against parotid secretion granule membranes. This antibody binds secretory carrier membrane proteins with apparent Mr 31,000, 33,000 and 35,000 (designated SCAMPs 31, 33, 35). The proteins are nonglycosylated integral membrane components, and the epitope recognized by SG7C12 is on the cytoplasmic side of the granule membrane. SCAMP 33 is found in all secretory carrier membranes studied so far while SCAMP 35 is found in exocrine and certain endocrine granules and liver Golgi membranes and SCAMP31 only in exocrine granules. They are not related to other similar-sized proteins that have been studied previously in relation to vesicular transport and secretion. Immunocytochemical staining shows that these SCAMPs are highly concentrated in the apical cytoplasm of exocrine cells. Antigens are present not only on exocrine granules and synaptic vesicles but also on other smooth membrane vesicles of exocrine and neural origin as revealed by immunolocalization in subcellular fractions and immunoadsorption to antibody-coated magnetic beads. The wide tissue distribution and localization to secretory carriers and related membranes suggest that SCAMPs 31-35 may be essential components in vesicle-mediated transport/secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1480117801,"Ricin B chain (RTB) is an N-glycosylated galactose-specific lectin which folds into two globular domains. Each domain binds one galactoside. The x-ray crystallographic structure has shown that the two binding sites are structurally similar and contain key binding residues which hydrogen bond to the sugar, and a conserved tripeptide, Asp-Val-Arg. We have used oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis to change either the binding residues or the homologous tripeptide in one or other or in both of the sites. The 5' signal sequence and RTB coding region were excised from preproricin cDNA and fused in frame to generate preRTB cDNA. Transcripts synthesized in vitro from wild-type or mutant preRTB cloned into the Xenopus transcription vector pSP64T using SP6 RNA polymerase, were microinjected into Xenopus oocytes. The recombinant products were segregated into the oocyte rough endoplasmic reticulum and core-glycosylated, and the N-terminal signal peptide was removed. Mutating sugar binding sites individually did not abrogate the lectin activity of RTB. When both sites were changed simultaneously, RTB was produced which was soluble and stable but no longer able to bind galactose. Changing the Asn residues of the two RTB N-glycosylation sites to Gln showed that oligosaccharide side chains were essential for both the stability and biological activity of recombinant RTB."

Biol. 9, 1212-1223) is very tightly linked with other small RNA genes coding for tRNA(ACGArg), tRNA(CUULys), and a approximately 275-nucleotide RNA (RNA X) of unknown function. A similar genomic organization is found at the U6 snRNA locus, where the U6 gene is linked to tRNA(CGUThr) and tRNA(GUATyr) genes. The tRNA(Lys) and tRNA(Arg) genes are members of a multigene family, whereas the tRNA(Thr) and tRNA(Tyr) genes are single copy. Two additional tRNA(CUULys) genes and one tRNA(UUULys) gene were also isolated and sequenced and, together with a sequence previously published (D. A. Campbell (1989) Nucleic Acids Res. 17, 9479), appear to represent the entire gene family. Probes for tRNA(Lys), tRNA(Arg), tRNA(Thr), and tRNA(Tyr) were found to hybridize with mitochondrial and cytoplasmic tRNAs but not with mitochondrial DNA. This supports the hypothesis that mitochondrial tRNAs may be nuclear-encoded and imported from the cytosol into the mitochondrion."
https://openalex.org/W1560947670,"We have isolated the gene encoding the neuronal intermediate filament protein alpha-internexin using low stringency hybridization conditions and an NF-M (neurofilament middle molecular weight subunit) cDNA probe. This gene consists of three exons and two introns. The sequence data and the exon-intron organization of the gene establish its classification as a type IV intermediate filament gene. Transient transfection experiments showed that up to 5 kilobases of the alpha-internexin promoter region transcribed equally well in both the alpha-internexin-expressing and -nonexpressing cell lines. The results also demonstrated that the region from -77 to +73 relative to the transcription start site was sufficient for accurate basal transcription, but inclusion of the -254 to -78 region was required for efficient transcription. Sequence analysis shows that the -254 to -78 region contains several potential positive regulatory elements."
https://openalex.org/W1539421932,"We characterized cDNA clones specific for the extracellular matrix glycoprotein undulin. Two sets of cDNA clones were isolated from a human placental lambda gt11 expression library and from a rhabdomyosarcoma cell line encoding two partially identical carboxyl-terminal polypeptides of 843 (Un1) and 443 (Un2) amino acids suggesting differential splicing of a single gene transcript. Northern blot analysis of human rhabdomyosarcoma cell poly (A) RNA with cDNA specific for Un1 identified transcripts of approximately 4.2, 6.5, and 8.5 kilobases, whereas a probe specific for Un2 detected a single mRNA of approximately 5 kilobases. Since a monoclonal antibody that is reactive with a sequence encoded by Un1 and not by Un2 detects the bands considered characteristic for undulin in Western blots, the mRNAs related to Un1 may code for the major part of the undulin molecule. The protein sequences deduced from Un1 and Un2 reveal an amino-terminal differentially spliced von Willebrand factor A domain, characteristic of proteins that interact with interstitial collagens, which is linked to fibronectin-like type III homology units by a unique sequence of 57 amino acids. Whereas Un2 encodes two complete and one incomplete type III homologies followed by a unique acidic carboxyl-terminal domain of 118 amino acids, Un1 codes for seven complete and one truncated type III homologies, followed by a short proline-rich carboxyl-terminal segment of 23 amino acids. Considering the 298 amino acids occurring in identical segments, the 989 different amino acid positions deduced from clones Un1 and Un2 represent an estimated 40% of the overall undulin sequence. In the context of 1) rotary shadowing electron microscopy data showing undulin as a structure composed of nodules that are interconnected by flexible rods of varying size, 2) the presence of three major bands of Mr 270,000, 190,000, and 180,000 in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, with 3) common antigenic epitopes and similar peptide maps (Schuppan, D., Cantaluppi, M.C., Becker, J., Veit, A., Bunte, T., Troyer, D., Schuppan, F., Schmid, M., Ackermann, R., and Hahn, E.G. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 8823-8832), our finding of differentially spliced type III homology units, as found in tenascin and fibronectin, suggests that undulin is another member of the fibronectin-tenascin family of extracellular matrix glycoproteins. Furthermore, as in fibronectin and tenascin, undulin bears an additional subset of interactive domains tailored to specific structural and functional roles in development and differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1504229842,"We have investigated the characteristics of platelet-activating factor (PAF)-stimulated protein tyrosine phosphorylation in rabbit platelets and its relationship to pp60c-src. 32P-Labeled platelets were challenged with PAF (10(-7) M) for 15 s, the reaction was killed by lysis at 4 degrees C, and samples were loaded onto a phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (Tyr(P)-mAb)-agarose column. The column was eluted with 10 mM phenyl phosphate, and the fractions were collected. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by autoradiography of the column fractions, showed that PAF increased the radioactivity of about a dozen protein bands with predominant ones of approximate molecular masses of 50, 60, 71, 82, and 300 kDa. When Tyr(P)-mAb-agarose column fractions were subjected to immunoblotting with pp60v-src mAb, it was observed that PAF treatment increased the reactivity of 50- and 60-kDa protein species. Immunoprecipitation with pp60v-src mAb further confirmed that PAF treatment increased phosphorylation of the 60- and 50-kDa proteins. Polyclonal antibody to G-protein (alpha-subunit) did not exhibit any reactivity to the column fractions and thus ruled out this protein as substrate for the tyrosine kinase. We next attempted to localize the pp60c-src. Platelet membrane particulate and cytosol fractions were separated from control and PAF-treated platelets, and it was observed that the immunoreactivity to pp60v-src mAb dramatically increased in the particulate membrane fraction from PAF-treated platelets. A concomitant decrease in the immunoreactivity in the cytosol fraction of PAF-treated platelets was also noted. It is concluded that PAF stimulates phosphorylation of pp60c-src tyrosine kinase and causes its rapid translocation from cytosol to membranes in rabbit platelets."
https://openalex.org/W1512525871,"Gunn rats lack UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UDPGT) activity toward bilirubin. In addition, a UDPGT isoform which is active toward 4-nitrophenol and is induced by 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MC) in normal rats, is produced in a nonfunctional truncated form in Gunn rats due to the deletion of a single guanosine residue in the coding region of its mRNA. The hepatic concentration of bilirubin-UDPGT mRNA was lower in Gunn rats than in congeneic normal rats. However, bilirubin-UDPGT mRNA was of apparently normal length and was induced by clofibrate, a known inducer of bilirubin-UDPGT activity. 3' regions of bilirubin- and 3-MC-inducible UDPGT mRNAs have identical nucleotide sequences; the single base deletion in the 3-MC-inducible UDPGT in Gunn rats occurs within this region. Using oligonucleotide primers corresponding to the identical and unique regions of the two mRNAs, and polymerase chain reaction, we amplified segments of mRNAs for the bilirubin- and 3-MC-inducible UDPGTs from normal and Gunn rat livers. Both amplified DNAs in Gunn rats lacked the restriction site for BstNI. Nucleotide sequence determination revealed that bilirubin- and 3-MC-inducible UDPGT mRNAs in Gunn rats contain an identical frame-shift deletion of a single guanosine residue within the common region of their coding sequences."

In addition, these RNA molecules contained hairpin loops, interior loops, and nonstandard base triplets [C+(or C).AT, U.GC, G.GC, and A.AT] at various positions. Affinity cleavage experiments confirmed the ability of selected sequences to bind specifically to the target DNA. Systematic variation in both the target DNA sequence and buffer components should provide increased insight into the molecular interactions required for triple-helix-mediated recognition of natural DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1536350035,"The alpha chain of the vitronectin receptor, alpha v, has been found in association with the integrin subunits beta 1, beta 3, or beta 5 on different cell types. We show here that cultured embryonic fibroblasts simultaneously display alpha v beta 3, alpha v beta 1, and alpha v in association with two other beta subunits, one of which is probably beta 5. Polymerase chain reaction analysis of single cells isolated by micromanipulation identified mRNA for alpha v, beta 1, beta 3, and beta 5 in six of eight clones. Immunoprecipitation of iodinated cell surface proteins with a monoclonal antibody to alpha v indicated that the relative proportions of the different beta chains in association with alpha v varied, particularly between two different cell lines. The cytokines platelet-derived growth factor, transforming growth factor beta 1, and tumor necrosis factor alpha did not appear to alter this ratio although tumor necrosis factor alpha increased the surface expression of the alpha v-associated integrins; but overnight culture in basic fibroblast growth factor caused a lower expression of alpha v beta 1 and alpha v beta 5 with no reduction in alpha v beta 3 expression. When the cell cultures were grown to complete confluence, surface expression of beta 3 was abolished, and the expression of an unknown beta chain (beta u) became more prominent. This effect was not overcome by culturing confluent cells with basic fibroblast growth factor. Affinity column chromatography showed that alpha v beta 5 bound to vitronectin but alpha v beta 1 did not, whereas alpha v beta 1 but not alpha v beta 5 bound to fibronectin. These results suggest that, on individual cells, the beta subunits found in association with alpha v may vary according to the proliferative capacity of the cell and that the promiscuous beta 3 subunit is progressively replaced by beta subunits of individual ligand specificity."
https://openalex.org/W1565391027,"Eukaryotic cells respond to various stimuli by an increase or decrease in levels of phosphoproteins. Phosphotyrosine levels on eukaryotic cellular proteins are tightly regulated by the opposing actions of protein-tyrosine kinases and protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases, EC 3.1.3.48). Studies on permeabilized mast cells suggest that the enabling reaction for exocytosis might involve protein dephosphorylation. In the present studies, a recombinant form of rat brain PTPase (rrbPTP-1) has been used to examine the potential role of PTPases in Ca(2+)-dependent amylase secretion from permeabilized rat pancreatic acini. Additionally, the concentrations and subcellular distributions of endogenous PTPase activity in rat pancreas were determined. The results from these experiments indicate that addition of exogenous PTPase stimulated Ca(2+)-dependent amylase secretion from pancreatic acinar cells and that endogenous PTPase activity was associated with the postgranule supernatant, zymogen granules, and in particular zymogen granule membranes. Our data suggest that protein tyrosine dephosphorylation is potentially involved in regulated secretion at a site(s) distal to receptor-mediated elevation of intracellular second messengers."
https://openalex.org/W1552234482,"Escherichia coli rho protein facilitates transcription termination by a mechanism that involves rho binding to the nascent RNA, activation of rho's RNA-dependent ATPase activity, and release of the mRNA from the DNA template. The initial step, formation of a rho-RNA complex, is mediated primarily by an RNA binding domain included within the amino-terminal 151 amino acids of rho protein. We have now identified one specific portion of this region that is involved in RNA binding, by photocross-linking and by site-directed mutagenesis. UV irradiation of rho-RNA complexes results in covalent attachment of the RNA to a single peptide in rho that apparently spans amino acids 45-100. Within this peptide is a ribonucleoprotein (RNP1) consensus sequence, Gly-Phe-Gly-Phe, that is present in many RNA-binding proteins. Mutagenesis of the phenylalanine residues in this consensus to leucine or alanine results in mutant proteins that are defective for RNA binding and have altered ATPase and RNA-DNA helicase activities. The weakened affinity but increased salt sensitivity of RNA binding by the mutant proteins suggests that they have lost more than just a set of nonionic interactions and are consistent with a change in the conformation of the RNA binding site. Whatever the changes, they appear localized primarily to the RNA binding domain because the mutants retain much of their RNA-dependent ATPase activity. We infer that the Phe residues themselves do not play a substantial role in the activation of ATP hydrolysis. Our results indicate that several different components of RNA interaction are required for rho activity and support a role for the RNP1 consensus region of rho in at least one specific aspect of RNA binding."
https://openalex.org/W1524153003,"Cys-cdc2(8-20), a synthetic peptide derived from p34cdc2, was previously reported to be a specific and efficient substrate of a pp60c-src-related tyrosine kinase isolated from bovine spleen (the spleen tyrosine kinase) (Litwin, C.M.E., Cheng, H.-C., and Wang, J.H. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 2557-2566). The longer peptide, cdc2(1-24), was found to be phosphorylated by the kinase with similar efficiency, and Tyr15 was the only amino acid residue phosphorylated. This indicated that the amino acid sequence of cdc2(8-20) peptide, EKI-GEGTYGVVYK, contained the structural features important for protein tyrosine kinase substrate activity. A stepwise procedure using synthetic peptides was employed to investigate such structural features. First, a computer search of protein sequences homologous to cdc2(8-20) uncovered five protein kinases containing homologous sequence with tyrosine at a position corresponding to Tyr15 of p34cdc2. Second, a peptide derived from ribosomal S6 protein kinase (rsk(436-456] was synthesized. The rsk(436-456) peptide contained a segment, ETIGVGSYSVCKR, which is highly homologous to that of cdc2(8-20). It was found to be a very poor substrate of the spleen tyrosine kinase. Third, peptide analogs of cdc2(6-20) with single substitutions of amino acid residues Lys9, Glu12, Thr14, Gly16, Val18, and Tyr19 by amino acid residues at corresponding positions of rsk were synthesized and tested as spleen tyrosine kinase substrates. Only Glu12 and Thr14 substituted peptide analogs showed decreased substrate activities. (The substrate activity of a peptide is the ability of the peptide to serve as the substrate of the spleen tyrosine kinase. It was determined of the spleen tyrosine kinase. It was determined either by the kinetic parameters (Km and Vmax) of phosphorylation of the peptide or by the initial phosphorylation rate of the peptide by the spleen tyrosine kinase.) An analog with double substitution at Glu12 An analog with double substitution at Glu12 and Thr14 was found to be almost as poor a substrate as the rsk peptide. In addition, peptide analogs with Tyr15 substituted by Phe or D-Tyr had poor substrate activities as well as weak inhibitory activities. Thus, Glu12, Thr14, and Tyr15 residues of p34cdc2 contained structural components essential for the efficient phosphorylation of the peptides derived from p34cdc2 by the pp60c-src-related spleen tyrosine kinase."

The association of 2'-deoxynucleoside 5'-triphosphates with the enzyme results in a decrease in the intensity of the tryptophan emission spectrum, which can be used to calculate apparent dissociation constants. The Kd values determined for binding of the four natural 2'-deoxynucleoside 5'-triphosphates to the free enzyme range from 36.7 +/- 1.8 microM for dTTP to 47.3 +/- 3.9 microM for dATP. The 5'-triphosphate of zidovudine has a Kd of 54.1 +/- 1.3 microM. The enzyme shows no preference for purine or pyrimidine nucleotides. Hill coefficients and the results of dual ligand titration experiments demonstrate that the free enzyme possesses a single dNTP binding site for which the four natural substrates and the 5'-triphosphate of zidovudine compete. The presence of homopolymeric template-primers does not result in selective binding of the complementary 2'-deoxynucleoside 5'-triphosphate, indicating that Watson-Crick base pairing is not involved in the initial binding reaction. The major force driving the association of the ligands with the binding site is hydrophobic. Approximately 14% of the binding energy is derived from electrostatic interactions. Although Mg2+ is required for catalytic activity, it is not absolutely required for initial binding."

Biochem. 172, 451-457), has been purified to near homogeneity and assayed for its ability to phosphorylate the synthetic peptides EDNEYTA and EPQYQPA reproducing the two conserved phosphoacceptor sites of pp60c-src (Tyr-416 and Tyr-527). While EPQYQPA was phosphorylated with low efficiency (Km = 16.7 mM, Kcat = 14.4), EDNEYTA is an excellent substrate displaying a Km value of 58 microM and a Kcat value of 31.2. The single substitution, in the latter peptide, of the glutamic acid adjacent to the tyrosine by alanine to give EDNAYTA caused a 6-fold increase in the Km. The positive influence on the phosphorylation of the acidic residues at -3 and -4 relative to the tyrosine is indicated by comparison of the kinetic constants for peptides EDAAYAA (Kcat = 4.6, Km 0.325 mM) and QNAAYAA (Kcat 2.4, Km 1.7 mM). Furthermore, when residues in the peptide NEYTA were replaced by alanine, the phosphorylation of the peptides NAYTA and AAYAA, was almost negligible (in terms of Kcat/Km ratio). However, AEYTA, NEYAA and AEYAA were still phosphorylated, albeit less efficiently than NEYTA. The probability that these peptides will adopt a beta-turn is EDNAYTA = EDNEYTA, NAYTA greater than NEYTA, and no predicted beta-turn for AEYTA, NEYAA, and AEYAA. Therefore these results support the concept that an amino-terminal acidic residue(s) is strictly required by TPK-IIB, irrespective of peptide conformation, although a beta-turn may enhance the phosphorylation of those peptides that satisfy this requirement. Two other spleen tyrosine kinases, TPK-I/lyn and TPK-III, both related to the src family, also have a far greater preference for the peptide EDNEYTA over EPQYQPA. However, they can be distinguished from TPK-IIB by their lower affinity for the peptides EDNEYTA and NEYTA and by their different specificity towards the substituted derivatives of NEYTA. TPK-I/lyn, accepts most of the substitutions that are detrimental to TPK-IIB, the triply substituted peptide AAYAA being actually preferred over the parent peptide NEYTA. The substitution of glutamic acid by alanine is also tolerated by TPK-III, although, in contrast to TPK-IIB, the phosphorylation efficiency is drastically decreased by the substitution of the asparagine at position -2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1578230004,"Chimeric proteins composed of acidic fibroblast growth factor (acidic FGF) and several forms of Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE) that cannot bind to the PE receptor have been produced in Escherichia coli by expressing chimeric genes in which DNA encoding acidic FGF is fused to various mutant forms of PE. These acidic FGF-PE fusion proteins were found to be cytotoxic to a variety of tumor cell lines including hepatocellular (PLC/PRF/5 and HEPG2), prostatic (LNCaP), colon (HT29), and breast (MCF-7) carcinomas at concentrations of 1-70 ng/ml. The cytotoxic effects of acidic FGF-PE were FGF-receptor specific as demonstrated by competition with excess acidic FGF and by showing that acidic FGF-PE bound to the FGF receptor with the same affinity as acidic FGF. Furthermore, the cell-killing activity of acidic FGF-PE was toxin-mediated, as an acidic FGF-PE mutant, which does not possess ADP-ribosylation activity, failed to kill cells. These findings demonstrate that acidic FGF-PE is a potent cytotoxic molecule that can be targeted to FGF receptor-bearing cells. Because acidic FGF is a potent angiogenic molecule, cytotoxic acidic FGF-PE chimeras may have utility as anti-angiogenic agents. These molecules could be helpful in determining the functional role of FGF receptors in cellular processes."

Acta 831, 99-105), from a cDNA library of rabbit small intestine mucosa by using synthetic DNA fragment by the polymerase chain reaction, as a hybridization probe. The cDNA with a 1,829-base pair insert encodes a polypeptide of 501 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence contains all of the sequences of the NH2-terminal and 14 tryptic fragments from purified P-450ib. As the NH2-terminal methionine was not found in the sequence from the purified protein, the apoprotein of P-450ib is composed of 500 amino acids with a molecular weight of 57,193. P-450ib shows 35-41% sequence similarity with several members of 8 subfamilies in the P-450 II family, whereas it has a less than 30% sequence similarity with other P-450 families, suggesting that this P-450 is the first member of a novel subfamily within the P-450 II family. RNA blot analysis shows that mRNA hybridized to the cDNA is expressed in the small intestine, but not significantly in other tissues including liver, colon, kidney, lung, spleen, brain, stomach, and cecum, indicating that P-450ib is a P-450 specific to the small intestine. The protein expressed in COS-7 cells using the cDNA in an expression vector, pKCRH2, shows benzphetamine N-demethylase activity and gives a band identical with that of P-450ib in its mobility on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis."
https://openalex.org/W1494388590,"The products generated by the reaction of Limulus alpha 2-macroglobulin with trypsin were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. Unreacted Limulus alpha 2-macroglobulin had a subunit molecular mass of 185 kDa. Trypsin-reacted samples contained two prominent peptides smaller (85 and 100 kDa) and three peptides larger (200, 250, and 300-350 kDa) than the unreacted subunit. Reaction of methylamine-treated Limulus alpha 2-macroglobulin with trypsin resulted in the same two prominent reaction products smaller than 185 kDa, but all of the reaction products larger than 185 kDa were absent. The covalent binding of biotinylated trypsin with Limulus alpha 2-macroglobulin was detected by probing Western blots with horseradish peroxidase-avidin. Surprisingly, the only reaction products that contained trypsin were bands at 100 and 120 kDa. The staining of these bands with horseradish peroxidase-avidin was weak: most of the biotinylated trypsin that remained associated with alpha 2-macroglobulin during gel filtration chromatography was located at the dye front following reducing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The reaction products larger than 185 kDa did not contain trypsin. Methylamine-reacted Limulus alpha 2-macroglobulin failed to bind any biotinylated trypsin. In contrast to the reaction of trypsin with Limulus alpha 2-macroglobulin, all high molecular mass bands generated by the reaction of human alpha 2-macroglobulin with biotinylated trypsin stained intensely with horseradish peroxidase-avidin. Thus, Limulus alpha 2-macroglobulin forms thiol ester-dependent, high molecular mass products involving isopeptide bonding between trypsin-generated fragments, without the incorporation of trypsin into the complexes. Most of the alpha 2-macroglobulin-associated trypsin is non-covalently trapped rather than covalently cross-linked."

The cross-linked adducts showed enhanced activity in systems where LFA-3 has been shown to (i) block LFA-3/CD2 interactions in a rosetting assay and (ii) provide through the CD2 on peripheral blood lymphocytes a trigger for T-cell proliferation. The level of increase was directly related to the valency state of the multimers. In the rosetting assay, the dimers, trimers, and tetramers, by weight, exhibited 15-, 150-, and 430-fold increases in activity over monomeric LFA-3. In the proliferation assay, the tetramer produced a 6-fold increase in thymidine incorporation at 0.06 micrograms/ml, the trimer was 100 times less active than the tetramer, and the dimer and monomer were inactive. The LFA-3 multimers were generated using a three-step cross-linking chemistry that was targeted at the carbohydrates on LFA-3. With this procedure over 60% of the starting protein was converted into multimers with no effect on function. The cross-linking approach should be applicable to other surface antigens, providing a simple method for analyzing multivalent interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1533585579,"Brefeldin A (BFA) is a novel agent with the unique property of effecting a rapid increase of Golgi cisternae volume and subsequent loss of a recognizable Golgi apparatus in treated cells. Although a receptor-mediated mechanism has been proposed, the molecular basis of BFA action remains unknown (Lippincott-Schwartz, J., Glickman, J., Donaldson, J. G., Robbins, J., Kreis, T. E., Seamon, K. B., Sheetz, M. P., and Klausner, R. D. (1991) J. Cell Biol. 112, 567-577). Since a variety of ionophores distort Golgi architecture by initially causing osmotic swelling of the cisternae (Mollenhauer, H. H., Morre, D. J., and Rowe, L. D. (1990) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1031, 225-246), Golgi membrane permeabilization by BFA seemed possible. We examined the effects of BFA on the conductance of planar lipid bilayers bathed in several aqueous salt solutions. Addition of BFA (1 microgram/ml) quickly augmented alkali cation conductance (K+ greater than Na+ much greater than Li+) but not anion conductance of the bilayer. Lower concentrations (1 ng/ml) indicated that BFA formed discrete, cation-selective channels in these bilayers. Given that Golgi cisternae volume increases immediately upon treatment with BFA, these findings suggest that alteration of ion gradients or Golgi membrane potential followed by an influx of water may be the mechanism by which BFA initiates disruption of Golgi structural integrity. Subsequent functional perturbations may then ensue either as a consequence of these initial structural changes or by a combination of several distinct mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1529580689,"Platelets contain exceptionally high levels of pp60c-src and, thus, provide a convenient system for investigating the physiological function of this protein-tyrosine kinase. We have employed chemical cross-linking of myristylated amino-terminal peptides of pp60c-src to platelet membranes in order to identify platelet membrane components that interact with pp60c-src to regulate or mediate its activity. We detected specific binding of radioiodinated peptides to platelet membrane proteins of 32, 50, 92, and 105 kDa. The 32-kDa protein may be related to the putative src receptor component recently identified in fibroblast membranes. The most reactive platelet protein, however, is the 50-kDa protein, which is either absent or nonreactive in fibroblast membranes. Binding of src peptides to this protein was saturable, and we estimate the presence of approximately 1 x 10(6) of the 50-kDa binding sites per platelet. The specificity of the peptide binding to the 50- and 32-kDa platelet proteins was analyzed by competition with different peptides. The binding sites displayed an absolute requirement for an N-myristoyl moiety and a strong preference for pp60c-src amino-terminal sequences. The identification of these src-interacting proteins may help to decipher the biochemical pathways in which platelet pp60c-src is involved."
https://openalex.org/W1533142093,"Members of the heat-stable family of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), MAP 2, tau, and MAP 4, contain three or four tandem imperfect repeated sequences close to their carboxyl termini. These sequences lie within the microtubule-binding domains of the MAPs; they have been proposed to be responsible for microtubule binding and the ability of these MAPs to lower the critical concentration for microtubule assembly. Their spacing may reflect that of the regularly arrayed tubulin subunits on the microtubule surface. We here characterize the 32- and 34-kDa chymotryptic microtubule-binding fragments of MAP 2 identified in earlier work. We identify the primary chymotryptic cleavage site in high molecular weight MAP 2 as between Phe1525 and Lys1526, within 13 amino acids of the known MAP 2 splice junction. We have raised a monoclonal antibody to the 32- and 34-kDa fragments and find that it reacts with all members of the heat-stable MAPs class. To determine where it reacts, we sequenced immunoreactive subfragments of the 32- and 34-kDa fragments, selected several cDNA clones with the antibody, and tested for antibody reactivity against a series of synthetic MAP 2 and tau peptides. We identify the epitope sequence as HHVPGGG (His-His-Val-Pro-Gly-Gly-Gly). The antibody also recognized several other MAP 2 and tau repeats. Despite reacting with this highly conserved element, we find that the antibody does not block microtubule binding, but binds to the MAPs and co-sediments with microtubules. These results suggest that there are other regions besides the repeated elements which are essential for microtubule binding."

Southern and Northern analyses confirmed that the neomycin-selected modified T-cells contained and expressed the lacZ gene. The fate of the modified T-cells (CTLL2/lacZ) was followed by flow cytometry with T-cell surface marker Thy1.2 and fluorescent beta-gal analysis. One day after transplantation (7.5 x 10(5) CTLL2/lacZ T-cells/g of body weight), 95 +/- 3% of the Thy1.2+ T-cells recovered from respiratory epithelial lining fluid (ELF) were beta-gal+.

At 7 days, 33 +/- 8% of the Thy 1.2+ cells in ELF and 75 +/- 6% of the Thy1.2+ cells in whole lung were Thy1.2+ beta-gal+. In contrast, the proportion of the Thy1.2+ beta-gal+ T-cells in the spleen, the major extrapulmonary lymphatic organ, never rose above 3 +/- 1% of the total Thy1.2+ cells. The number of Thy1.2+ beta-gal+ T-cells in the lung could be modified by the systemic administration of IL-2, with whole lung Thy1.2+ beta-gal+ T-cells increasing 4.6-fold 3 days after transplantation, compared with non-IL-2-treated animals. These studies suggest that direct transplantation of genetically modified T-cells into the lung is feasible and represents a viable strategy for lung-specific gene transfer."

Specific proteins were phosphorylated at serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues, as determined by phosphoamino acid analysis of discrete spots on two-dimensional gels. 2) Insulin stimulated the phosphorylation by [γ-32P]ATP of at least six discrete proteins in solubilized N. crassa membrane preparations at serine and tyrosine residues. 3) A phosphotyrosine-containing protein of 38 kDa, pI 7.0–7.2, reacted by both immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation with antiserum to P2, a peptide from the human insulin receptor that contains an autophosphorylated tyrosine residue. In N. crassa cells, therefore, as in mammalian cells, insulin induces a variety of protein phosphorylations, some of which may be part of an evolutionarily conserved signal transduction pathway.—Kole, H.

https://openalex.org/W1578684455,"Abstract Specific ribonucleotides within the 5' domain of Escherichia coli 16 S rRNA were altered by deletion and/or substitution by site-directed mutagenesis of cloned DNA to assess the importance of these particular residues in defining the binding site for ribosomal protein S20. Gel filtration and sucrose gradient centrifugation were employed to measure the binding of ribosomal protein S20 to synthetic transcripts spanning the 5' domain of 16 S rRNA containing various alterations. In several cases, the apparent association constants for these interactions were also determined. Three essential results were obtained. First, RNA transcripts containing residues 1-402 are sufficient for high affinity S20 binding. Second, bulges at residues 250-251 and 278-280 in a stem-loop structure extending from residues 240 to 286 are critical for S20 binding, arguing that the 260 stem directly interacts with S20 at these sites. Third, mutations in a hairpin structure spanning residues 316-337 demonstrate a strong requirement for both the specific A321*G332 bulge and for unpaired residues in the loop itself for proper S20 binding. Our results document the importance of unpaired residues in maintaining the interaction between S20 and 16 S rRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1547977548,"The chloroplast translational initiation factor 3 (IF-3chl) has been purified by a combination of gravity and high pressure liquid chromatographic steps. IF-3chl activity has been resolved into three forms designated alpha, beta, and gamma. Analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicates that the alpha form corresponds to a single polypeptide with a molecular mass of approximately 34 kDa. The beta and gamma forms have been purified to near homogeneity, and both forms appear to function as monomers with molecular masses of about 39-42 kDa. All three forms are heat stable. All the forms of IF-3chl detected enhance the poly (A,U,G)-dependent binding of the initiator tRNA to chloroplast 30 S ribosomal subunits in the presence of Escherichia coli IF-1 and IF-2. The chloroplast factor, unlike the corresponding bacterial factor, does not have a strong RNA binding activity."
