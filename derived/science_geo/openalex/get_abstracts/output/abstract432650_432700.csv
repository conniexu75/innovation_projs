https://openalex.org/W2053493267,"Calorie restriction (CR), a reduction of 10–40% in intake of a nutritious diet, is often reported as the most robust non-genetic mechanism to extend lifespan and healthspan. CR is frequently used as a tool to understand mechanisms behind ageing and age-associated diseases. In addition to and independently of increasing lifespan, CR has been reported to delay or prevent the occurrence of many chronic diseases in a variety of animals. Beneficial effects of CR on outcomes such as immune function, motor coordination and resistance to sarcopenia in rhesus monkeys have recently been reported. We report here that a CR regimen implemented in young and older age rhesus monkeys at the National Institute on Aging (NIA) has not improved survival outcomes. Our findings contrast with an ongoing study at the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center (WNPRC), which reported improved survival associated with 30% CR initiated in adult rhesus monkeys (7–14 years) and a preliminary report with a small number of CR monkeys. Over the years, both NIA and WNPRC have extensively documented beneficial health effects of CR in these two apparently parallel studies. The implications of the WNPRC findings were important as they extended CR findings beyond the laboratory rodent and to a long-lived primate. Our study suggests a separation between health effects, morbidity and mortality, and similar to what has been shown in rodents, study design, husbandry and diet composition may strongly affect the life-prolonging effect of CR in a long-lived nonhuman primate."

https://openalex.org/W2087293737,"Influenza viruses take a yearly toll on human life despite efforts to contain them with seasonal vaccines. These viruses evade human immunity through the evolution of variants that resist neutralization. The identification of antibodies that recognize invariant structures on the influenza haemagglutinin (HA) protein have invigorated efforts to develop universal influenza vaccines. Specifically, antibodies to the highly conserved stem region of HA neutralize diverse viral subtypes. These antibodies largely derive from a specific antibody gene, heavy-chain variable region IGHV1-69, after limited affinity maturation from their germline ancestors, but how HA stimulates naive B cells to mature and induce protective immunity is unknown. To address this question, we analysed the structural and genetic basis for their engagement and maturation into broadly neutralizing antibodies. Here we show that the germline-encoded precursors of these antibodies act as functional B-cell antigen receptors (BCRs) that initiate subsequent affinity maturation. Neither the germline precursor of a prototypic antibody, CR6261 (ref. 3), nor those of two other natural human IGHV1-69 antibodies, bound HA as soluble immunoglobulin-G (IgG). However, all three IGHV1-69 precursors engaged HA when the antibody was expressed as cell surface IgM. HA triggered BCR-associated tyrosine kinase signalling by germline transmembrane IgM. Recognition and virus neutralization was dependent solely on the heavy chain, and affinity maturation of CR6261 required only seven amino acids in the complementarity-determining region (CDR) H1 and framework region 3 (FR3) to restore full activity. These findings provide insight into the initial events that lead to the generation of broadly neutralizing antibodies to influenza, informing the rational design of vaccines to elicit such antibodies and providing a model relevant to other infectious diseases, including human immunodeficiency virus/AIDS. The data further suggest that selected immunoglobulin genes recognize specific protein structural 'patterns' that provide a substrate for further affinity maturation."
https://openalex.org/W2129950147,"Light-matter interactions are ubiquitous, and underpin a wide range of basic research fields and applied technologies. Although optical interactions have been intensively studied, their microscopic details are often poorly understood and have so far not been directly measurable. X-ray and optical wave mixing was proposed nearly half a century ago as an atomic-scale probe of optical interactions but has not yet been observed owing to a lack of sufficiently intense X-ray sources. Here we use an X-ray laser to demonstrate X-ray and optical sum-frequency generation. The underlying nonlinearity is a reciprocal-space probe of the optically induced charges and associated microscopic fields that arise in an illuminated material. To within the experimental errors, the measured efficiency is consistent with first-principles calculations of microscopic optical polarization in diamond. The ability to probe optical interactions on the atomic scale offers new opportunities in both basic and applied areas of science."

https://openalex.org/W2150752137,"Concerns over fishing impacts on marine populations and ecosystems have intensified the need to improve ocean management. One increasingly popular market-based instrument for ecological stewardship is the use of certification and eco-labeling programs to highlight sustainable fisheries with low environmental impacts. The Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) is the most prominent of these programs. Despite widespread discussions about the rigor of the MSC standards, no comprehensive analysis of the performance of MSC-certified fish stocks has yet been conducted. We compared status and abundance trends of 45 certified stocks with those of 179 uncertified stocks, finding that 74% of certified fisheries were above biomass levels that would produce maximum sustainable yield, compared with only 44% of uncertified fisheries. On average, the biomass of certified stocks increased by 46% over the past 10 years, whereas uncertified fisheries increased by just 9%. As part of the MSC process, fisheries initially go through a confidential pre-assessment process. When certified fisheries are compared with those that decline to pursue full certification after pre-assessment, certified stocks had much lower mean exploitation rates (67% of the rate producing maximum sustainable yield vs. 92% for those declining to pursue certification), allowing for more sustainable harvesting and in many cases biomass rebuilding. From a consumer’s point of view this means that MSC-certified seafood is 3–5 times less likely to be subject to harmful fishing than uncertified seafood. Thus, MSC-certification accurately identifies healthy fish stocks and conveys reliable information on stock status to seafood consumers."
https://openalex.org/W2012307799,"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is increasingly being used in human studies as an adjuvant tool to promote recovery of function after stroke. However, its neurobiological effects are still largely unknown. Electric fields are known to influence the migration of various cell types in vitro, but effects in vivo remain to be shown. Hypothesizing that tDCS might elicit the recruitment of cells to the cortex, we here studied the effects of tDCS in the rat brain in vivo. Adult Wistar rats (n = 16) were randomized to either anodal or cathodal stimulation for either 5 or 10 consecutive days (500 µA, 15 min). Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was given systemically to label dividing cells throughout the experiment. Immunohistochemical analyses ex vivo included stainings for activated microglia and endogenous neural stem cells (NSC). Multi-session tDCS with the chosen parameters did not cause a cortical lesion. An innate immune response with early upregulation of Iba1-positive activated microglia occurred after both cathodal and anodal tDCS. The involvement of adaptive immunity as assessed by ICAM1-immunoreactivity was less pronounced. Most interestingly, only cathodal tDCS increased the number of endogenous NSC in the stimulated cortex. After 10 days of cathodal stimulation, proliferating NSC increased by ∼60%, with a significant effect of both polarity and number of tDCS sessions on the recruitment of NSC. We demonstrate a pro-inflammatory effect of both cathodal and anodal tDCS, and a polarity-specific migratory effect on endogenous NSC in vivo. Our data suggest that tDCS in human stroke patients might also elicit NSC activation and modulate neuroinflammation."

An in vivo mechanism of action of the antagonistic probiotic bacterium is suggested using a non-antagonistic mutant. P. gallaeciensis was readily established in axenic cultures of the two microalgae Tetraselmis suecica and Nannochloropsis oculata, and of the rotifer Brachionus plicatilis. P. gallaeciensis reached densities of 10(7) cfu/ml and did not adversely affect growth of algae or rotifers. Vibrio anguillarum was significantly reduced by wild-type P. gallaeciensis, when introduced into these cultures. A P. gallaeciensis mutant that did not produce the antibacterial compound tropodithietic acid (TDA) did not reduce V. anguillarum numbers, suggesting that production of the antibacterial compound is important for the antagonistic properties of P. gallaeciensis. The ability of P. gallaeciensis to protect fish larvae from vibriosis was determined in a bath challenge experiment using a multidish system with 1 larva per well. Unchallenged larvae reached 40% accumulated mortality which increased to 100% when infected with V. anguillarum. P. gallaeciensis reduced the mortality of challenged cod larvae (Gadus morhua) to 10%, significantly below the levels of both the challenged and the unchallenged larvae. The TDA mutant reduced mortality of the cod larvae in some of the replicates, although to a much lesser extent than the wild type. It is concluded that P. gallaeciensis is a promising probiont in marine larviculture and that TDA production likely contributes to its probiotic effect."
https://openalex.org/W2053135248,"Genistein has been shown to suppress the growth of several cancers through modulation of various pathways. However, the effects of genistein on the regulation of oncogenic microRNA-151 (miR-151) have not been reported. In this study, we investigated whether genistein could alter the expression of oncogenic miR-151 and its target genes that are involved in the progression and metastasis of prostate cancer (PCa). Real-time RT-PCR showed that the expression of miR-151 was higher in PC3 and DU145 cells compared with RWPE-1 cells. Treatment of PC3 and DU145 cells with 25 µM genistein down-regulated the expression of miR-151 compared with vehicle control. Inhibition of miR-151 in PCa cells by genistein significantly inhibited cell migration and invasion. In-silico analysis showed that several genes (CASZ1, IL1RAPL1, SOX17, N4BP1 and ARHGDIA) suggested to have tumor suppressive functions were target genes of miR-151. Luciferase reporter assays indicated that miR-151 directly binds to specific sites on the 3′UTR of target genes. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that the mRNA expression levels of the five target genes in PC3 and DU145 were markedly changed with miR-151 mimics and inhibitor. Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests revealed that high expression levels of miR-151 had an adverse effect on survival rate. This study suggests that genistein mediated suppression of oncogenic miRNAs can be an important dietary therapeutic strategy for the treatment of PCa."

Although successful in Xenopus oocytes, single subunit counting, manually counting photobleaching steps of GFP-tagged subunits, has been hindered in mammalian cells by high background fluorescence, poor control of expression, and low GFP maturation efficiency. Here, we present a fully automated single-molecule fluorescence counting method that separates tagged proteins on the plasma membrane from background fluorescence and contaminant proteins in the cytosol or the endoplasmic reticulum and determines the protein stoichiometry. Lower GFP maturation rates observed in cells cultured at 37 °C were partly offset using a monomeric version of superfolder GFP. We were able to correctly identify the stoichiometry of GluK2 and α1 glycine receptors.

https://openalex.org/W2126731001,"Aberrant DNA methylation constitutes a well-established epigenetic marker for breast cancer. Changes in methylation early in cancer development may be clinically relevant for cancer detection and prognosis-based therapeutic decisions. In the present study, a combination of methyl-CpG immunoprecipitation (MCIp) and human CpG island (CGI) arrays was applied to compare genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in 10 low-grade in situ and invasive breast cancers against 10 normal breast samples. In total, 214 CGIs were found to be hypermethylated in ≥6 of 10 tumors. Functional term enrichment analyses revealed an overrepresentation of homeobox genes and genes involved in transcription and regulation of transcription. Significant hypermethylation of 11 selected genes in tumor vs. normal tissue was validated in two independent sample sets (45 tumors and 11 controls, 43 tumors and 8 controls) using quantitative EpiTyper technology. In tumors, median methylation levels of BCAN, HOXD1, KCTD8, KLF11, NXPH1, POU4F1, SIM1, and TCF7L1 were ≥30% higher than in normal samples, representing potential biomarkers for tumor diagnosis. Using the 90th percentile of methylation levels in normal tissue as cutoff value, 62–92% of in situ samples (n=13), 72–97% of invasive samples from the first validation set (n=32), and 86–100% of invasive samples from the second validation set (n=43) were classified as hypermethylated. Hypermethylation of KLF11 and SIM1 might also be associated with increased risk of developing metastases. In summary, early methylation changes are frequent in the low-grade pathway of breast cancer and may be useful in the development of differential diagnostic and possibly also prognostic markers.—Faryna, M., Konermann, C., Aulmann, S., Bermejo, J.

https://openalex.org/W2115558967,"Cyanobacterial CO2-fixation is supported by a CO2-concentrating mechanism which improves photosynthesis by saturating the primary carboxylating enzyme, ribulose 1, 5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO), with its preferred substrate CO2. The site of CO2-concentration is a protein bound micro-compartment called the carboxysome which contains most, if not all, of the cellular RuBisCO. The shell of β-type carboxysomes is thought to be composed of two functional layers, with the inner layer involved in RuBisCO scaffolding and bicarbonate dehydration, and the outer layer in selective permeability to dissolved solutes. Here, four genes (ccmK2-4, ccmO), whose products were predicted to function in the outer shell layer of β-carboxysomes from Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, were investigated by analysis of defined genetic mutants. Deletion of the ccmK2 and ccmO genes resulted in severe high-CO2-requiring mutants with aberrant carboxysomes, whilst deletion of ccmK3 or ccmK4 resulted in cells with wild-type physiology and normal ultrastructure. However, a tandem deletion of ccmK3-4 resulted in cells with wild-type carboxysome structure, but physiologically deficient at low CO2 conditions. These results revealed the minimum structural determinants of the outer shell of β-carboxysomes from this strain: CcmK2, CcmO and CcmL. An accessory set of proteins was required to refine the function of the pre-existing shell: CcmK3 and CcmK4. These data suggested a model for the facet structure of β-carboxysomes with CcmL forming the vertices, CcmK2 forming the bulk facet, and CcmO, a “zipper protein,” interfacing the edges of carboxysome facets."
https://openalex.org/W2107901534,"O-GlcNAcylation is a common posttranslational modification of nucleocytoplasmic proteins by β-N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc). The dynamic addition and removal of O-GlcNAc groups to and from proteins are catalyzed by O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase (O-GlcNAc transferase, OGT) and β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (O-GlcNAcase, OGA), respectively. O-GlcNAcylation often modulates protein phosphorylation and regulates several cellular signaling and functions, especially in the brain. However, its developmental regulation is not well known. Here, we studied protein O-GlcNAcylation, OGT, and OGA in the rat brain at various ages from embryonic day 15 to the age of 2 years. We found a gradual decline of global protein O-GlcNAcylation during developmental stages and adulthood. This decline correlated positively to the total protein phosphorylation at serine residues, but not at threonine residues. The expression of OGT and OGA isoforms was regulated differently at various ages. Immunohistochemical studies revealed ubiquitous distribution of O-GlcNAcylation at all ages. Strong immunostaining of O-GlcNAc, OGT, and OGA was observed mostly in neuronal cell bodies and processes, further suggesting the role of O-GlcNAc modification of neuronal proteins in the brain. These studies provide fundamental knowledge of age-dependent protein modification by O-GlcNAc and will help guide future studies on the role of O-GlcNAcylation in the mammalian brain."
https://openalex.org/W2059756376,"Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are the master regulators of hypoxia-responsive genes. They play a critical role in the survival, development, and differentiation of chondrocytes in the avascular hypoxic fetal growth plate, which is rich in extracellular matrix (ECM) and in its main component, collagens. Several genes involved in the synthesis, maintenance, and degradation of ECM are regulated by HIFs. Collagen prolyl 4-hydroxylases (C-P4Hs) are key enzymes in collagen synthesis because the resulting 4-hydroxyprolines are necessary for the stability of all collagen molecules. The vertebrate C-P4Hs are α(2)β(2) tetramers with three isoforms of the catalytic α subunit, yielding C-P4Hs of types I-III. C-P4H-I is the main form in most cells, but C-P4H-II is the major form in chondrocytes. We postulated here that post-translational modification of collagens, particularly 4-hydroxylation of proline residues, could be one of the modalities by which HIF regulates the adaptive responses of chondrocytes in fetal growth plates. To address this hypothesis, we used primary epiphyseal growth plate chondrocytes isolated from newborn mice with conditionally inactivated genes for HIF-1α, HIF-2α, or the von Hippel-Lindau protein. The data obtained showed that C-P4H α(I) and α(II) mRNA levels were increased in hypoxic chondrocytes in a manner dependent on HIF-1 but not on HIF-2. Furthermore, the increases in the C-P4H mRNA levels were associated with both increased amounts of the C-P4H tetramers and augmented C-P4H activity in hypoxia. The hypoxia inducibility of the C-P4H isoenzymes is thus likely to ensure sufficient C-P4H activity for collagen synthesis occurring in chondrocytes in a hypoxic environment."
https://openalex.org/W2123520920,"Thermophilic microorganisms capable of using complex substrates offer special advantages for the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to biofuels and bioproducts. Members of the Gram-positive bacterial genus Caldicellulosiruptor are anaerobic thermophiles with optimum growth temperatures between 65°C and 78°C and are the most thermophilic cellulolytic organisms known. In fact, they efficiently use biomass non-pretreated as their sole carbon source and in successive rounds of application digest 70% of total switchgrass substrate. The ability to genetically manipulate these organisms is a prerequisite to engineering them for use in conversion of these complex substrates to products of interest as well as identifying gene products critical for their ability to utilize non-pretreated biomass. Here, we report the first example of DNA transformation of a member of this genus, C. bescii. We show that restriction of DNA is a major barrier to transformation (in this case apparently absolute) and that methylation with an endogenous unique α-class N4-Cytosine methyltransferase is required for transformation of DNA isolated from E. coli. The use of modified DNA leads to the development of an efficient and reproducible method for DNA transformation and the combined frequencies of transformation and recombination allow marker replacement between non-replicating plasmids and chromosomal genes providing the basis for rapid and efficient methods of genetic manipulation."
https://openalex.org/W2051112488,"Previous studies have shown that iconic graphical signs can evolve into symbols through repeated usage within dyads and interacting communities. Here we investigate the evolution of graphical signs over chains of participants. In these chains (or “replacement microsocieties”), membership of an interacting group changed repeatedly such that the most experienced members were continually replaced by naïve participants. Signs rapidly became symbolic, such that they were mutually incomprehensible across experienced members of different chains, and new entrants needed to learn conventionalised meanings. An objective measure of graphical complexity (perimetric complexity) showed that the signs used within the microsocieties were becoming progressively simplified over successive usage. This is the first study to show that the signs that evolve in graphical communication experiments can be transmitted to, and spontaneously adopted by, naïve participants. This provides critical support for the view that human communicative symbols could have evolved culturally from iconic representations."

https://openalex.org/W2145031157,"High-throughput recording of signals embedded within inaccessible micro-environments is a technological challenge. The ideal recording device would be a nanoscale machine capable of quantitatively transducing a wide range of variables into a molecular recording medium suitable for long-term storage and facile readout in the form of digital data. We have recently proposed such a device, in which cation concentrations modulate the misincorporation rate of a DNA polymerase (DNAP) on a known template, allowing DNA sequences to encode information about the local cation concentration. In this work we quantify the cation sensitivity of DNAP misincorporation rates, making possible the indirect readout of cation concentration by DNA sequencing. Using multiplexed deep sequencing, we quantify the misincorporation properties of two DNA polymerases – Dpo4 and Klenow exo− – obtaining the probability and base selectivity of misincorporation at all positions within the template. We find that Dpo4 acts as a DNA recording device for Mn2+ with a misincorporation rate gain of ∼2%/mM. This modulation of misincorporation rate is selective to the template base: the probability of misincorporation on template T by Dpo4 increases >50-fold over the range tested, while the other template bases are affected less strongly. Furthermore, cation concentrations act as scaling factors for misincorporation: on a given template base, Mn2+ and Mg2+ change the overall misincorporation rate but do not alter the relative frequencies of incoming misincorporated nucleotides. Characterization of the ion dependence of DNAP misincorporation serves as the first step towards repurposing it as a molecular recording device."

In this study, it was shown that O-linked core 2 oligosaccharides (Galβ1-3(GlcNAcβ1-6)GalNAcα1-Thr/Ser) on lubricin isolated from rheumatoid arthritis SF contained both sulfate and fucose residues, and SF lubricin was capable of binding to recombinant L-selectin in a glycosylation-dependent manner. Using resting human polymorphonuclear granulocytes (PMN) from peripheral blood, confocal microscopy showed that lubricin coated circulating PMN and that it partly co-localized with L-selectin expressed by these cells. In agreement with this, activation-induced shedding of L-selectin also mediated decreased lubricin binding to PMN. It was also found that PMN recruited to inflamed synovial area and fluid in rheumatoid arthritis patients kept a coat of lubricin.

The functional complexity of the silkworm transcriptome has not yet been fully elucidated, although genomic sequencing and other tools have been widely used in its study. We explored the transcriptome of silkworm at different developmental stages using high-throughput paired-end RNA sequencing. A total of about 3.3 gigabases (Gb) of sequence was obtained, representing about a 7-fold coverage of the B. mori genome. From the reads that were mapped to the genome sequence; 23,461 transcripts were obtained, 5,428 of them were novel. Of the 14,623 predicted protein-coding genes in the silkworm genome database, 11,884 of them were found to be expressed in the silkworm transcriptome, giving a coverage of 81.3%. A total of 13,195 new exons were detected, of which, 5,911 were found in the annotated genes in the Silkworm Genome Database (SilkDB). An analysis of alternative splicing in the transcriptome revealed that 3,247 genes had undergone alternative splicing. To help with the data analysis, a transcriptome database that integrates our transcriptome data with the silkworm genome data was constructed and is publicly available at http://124.17.27.136/gbrowse2/.

Double strand breaks (DSBs) induced by ionizing radiation and agents such as neocarzinostatin (NCS), and interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) induced by alkylating agents such as mitomycin C (MMC), are toxic DNA lesions that need to be repaired for cell survival. Here we examined the effects of NCS and MMC treatment on oocytes collected from antral follicles in mice, because potentially such oocytes are readily collected from ovaries and do not need to be in vitro grown to achieve meiotic competency. We found that oocytes were sensitive to NCS, such that this ionizing radiation mimetic blocked meiosis I and caused fragmented DNA. In contrast, MMC had no impact on the completion of either meiosis I or II, even at extremely high doses. However, oocytes treated with MMC did show γ-H2AX foci and following their in vitro maturation and parthenogenetic activation the development of the subsequent embryos was severely compromised. Addition of MMC to 1-cell embryos caused a similarly poor level of development, demonstrating oocytes have eventual sensitivity to this ICL-inducing agent but this does not occur during their meiotic division. In oocytes, the association of Fanconi Anemia protein, FANCD2, with sites of ICL lesions was not apparent until entry into the embryonic cell cycle. In conclusion, meiotic maturation of oocytes is sensitive to DSBs but not ICLs. The ability of oocytes to tolerate severe ICL damage and yet complete meiosis, means that this type of DNA lesion goes unrepaired in oocytes but impacts on subsequent embryo quality."
https://openalex.org/W2094685045,"Mouse preimplantation development is characterized by three major transitions and two lineage segregations. Each transition or lineage segregation entails pronounced changes in the pattern of gene expression. Thus, research into the function of genes with obvious changes in expression pattern will shed light on the molecular basis of preimplantation development. We have described a simplified and effective method--electroporation--of introducing plasmid DNA and morpholinos into mouse preimplantation embryos and verified effectiveness of this approach by testing the procedure on the endogenous gene Oct4. Before electroporation, the zona pellucida was weakened by the treatment of acid Tyrode's solution. Then we optimized the parameters such as voltage, pulse duration, number of pulses and repeats, and applied these parameters to subsequent experiments. Compared with the control groups, the number of apoptotic cells and the expression and localization of OCT3/4 or CDX2 was not significantly changed in blastocysts developed from 1-cell embryos, which were electroporated with pIRES2-AcGFP1-Nuc eukaryotic expression vector or mismatched morpholino oligonucleotides. Furthermore, electroporated plasmid DNA and morpholinos targeting the endogenous gene Oct4 were able to sharply down regulate expression of OCT4 protein and actually cause expected phenotypes in mouse preimplantation embryos. In conclusion, plasmid DNA and morpholinos could be efficient delivered into mouse preimplantation embryos by electroporation and exert their functions, and normal development of preimplantation embryos was not affected."
https://openalex.org/W1993294539,"Background The juvenile hormones (JHs) are sesquiterpenoid compounds that play a central role in insect reproduction, development and behavior. The lipophilic nature of JHs and their precursors, in conjunction with their low concentration in tissues and susceptibility to degradation had made their quantification difficult. A variety of methods exist for JH quantification but few can quantify on the femtomole range. Currently applied methods are expensive and time consuming. In the present study we sought to develop a novel method for accurate detection and quantification of JHs and their precursors. Methods A sensitive and robust method was developed to quantify the precursor, farnesoic acid (FA) and juvenile hormone III (JH III) in biological samples. The assay is based on the derivatization of analytes with fluorescent tags, with subsequent analysis by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography coupled to a fluorescent detector (HPLC-FD). The carboxyl group of FA was derivatized with 4-Acetamido-7-mercapto-2,1,3-benzoxadiazole (AABD-SH). Tagging the epoxide group of JH III required a two-step reaction: the opening of the epoxide ring with sodium sulfide and derivatization with the fluorescent tag 4-(N,N-Dimethylaminosulfonyl)-7-(N-chloroformylmethyl-N-methylamino)-2,1,3-benzoxadiazole (DBD-COCl). Conclusions The method developed in the present study showed high sensitivity, accuracy and reproducibility. Linear responses were obtained over the range of 10–20 to 1000 fmols. Recovery efficiencies were over 90% for JH III and 98% for FA with excellent reproducibility. Significance The proposed method is applicable when sensitive detection and accurate quantification of limited amount of sample is needed. Examples include corpora allata, hemolymph and whole body of female adult Aedes aegypti and whole body Drosophila melanogaster. A variety of additional functional groups can be targeted to add fluorescent tags to the remaining JH III precursors."
https://openalex.org/W2017153914,"The RV144 clinical trial showed for the first time that vaccination could provide modest but significant protection from HIV-1 infection. To understand the protective response, and to improve upon the vaccine's efficacy, it is important to define the structure of the immunogens used in the prime/boost regimen. Here we examined the heterogeneity in net charge, attributable to glycoform variation, of the gp120 immunogens contained in the AIDSVAX B/E vaccine.Isoelectric focusing and glycosidase digestion were used to assess variation in net charge of the gp120s contained in the AIDSVAX B/E vaccine used in the RV144 trial. We observed 16 variants of MN-rgp120 and 24 variants of A244-rgp120. Glycoform variation in gp120 produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells was compared to glycoform variation in gp120 produced in the 293F human embryonic kidney cell line, often used for neutralization assays. We found that gp120 variants produced in CHO cells were distinctly more acidic than gp120 variants produced in 293 cells. The effect of glycoform heterogeneity on antigenicity was assessed using monoclonal antibodies. The broadly neutralizing PG9 MAb bound to A244-rgp120, but not to MN-rgp120, whether produced in CHO or in 293. However, PG9 was able to bind with high affinity to MN-rgp120 and A244-rgp120 produced in 293 cells deficient in N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I.MN- and A244-rgp120 used in the RV144 trial exhibited extensive heterogeneity in net charge due to variation in sialic acid-containing glycoforms. These differences were cell line-dependent, affected the antigenicity of recombinant envelope proteins, and may affect assays used to measure neutralization. These studies, together with recent reports documenting broadly neutralizing antibodies directed against carbohydrate epitopes of gp120, suggest that glycoform variation is a key variable to be considered in the production and evaluation of subunit vaccines designed to prevent HIV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2042550451,"Background Activin A is a protein that participates principally in reproductive functions. In the adult brain, Activin is neuroprotective, but its role in brain development is still elusive. Methodology/Principal Findings We studied if Activin A influences proliferation, differentiation or survival in rat cerebrocortical neural progenitor cells (NPC). After stimulation of NPC with Activin A, phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Smad 2/3 were induced. In proliferating NPC, Activin produced a significant decrease in cell area and also a discrete increase in the number of neurons in the presence of the mitogen Fibroblast Growth Factor 2. The percentages of cells incorporating BrdU, or positive for the undifferentiated NPC markers Nestin and Sox2, were unchanged after incubation with Activin. In differentiating conditions, continuous treatment with Activin A significantly increased the number of neurons without affecting astroglial differentiation or causing apoptotic death. In cells cultured by extended periods, Activin treatment produced further increases in the proportion of neurons, excluding premature cell cycle exit. In clonal assays, Activin significantly increased neuronal numbers per colony, supporting an instructive role. Activin-induced neurogenesis was dependent on activation of its receptors, since incubation with the type I receptor inhibitor SB431542 or the ligand-trap Follistatin prevented neuronal differentiation. Interestingly, SB431542 or Follistatin by themselves abolished neurogenesis and increased astrogliogenesis, to a similar extent to that induced by Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP)4. Co-incubation of these Activin inhibitors with the BMP antagonist Dorsomorphin restored neuronal and astrocytic differentiation to control levels. Conclusions Our results show an instructive neuronal effect of Activin A in cortical NPC in vitro, pointing out to a relevant role of this cytokine in the specification of NPC towards a neuronal phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2027985967,"Claudins are integral transmembrane components of the tight junctions forming trans-epithelial barriers in many organs, such as the nervous system, lung, and epidermis. In Drosophila three claudins have been identified that are required for forming the tight junctions analogous structure, the septate junctions (SJs). The lack of claudins results in a disruption of SJ integrity leading to a breakdown of the trans-epithelial barrier and to disturbed epithelial morphogenesis. However, little is known about claudin partners for transport mechanisms and membrane organization. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of the claudin proteome in Drosophila by combining biochemical and physiological approaches. Using specific antibodies against the claudin Megatrachea for immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, we identified 142 proteins associated with Megatrachea in embryos. The Megatrachea interacting proteins were analyzed in vivo by tissue-specific knockdown of the corresponding genes using RNA interference. We identified known and novel putative SJ components, such as the gene product of CG3921. Furthermore, our data suggest that the control of secretion processes specific to SJs and dependent on Sec61p may involve Megatrachea interaction with Sec61 subunits. Also, our findings suggest that clathrin-coated vesicles may regulate Megatrachea turnover at the plasma membrane similar to human claudins. As claudins are conserved both in structure and function, our findings offer novel candidate proteins involved in the claudin interactome of vertebrates and invertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W1993187659,"A functional 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway is required for isoprenoid biosynthesis and hence survival in Escherichia coli and most other bacteria. In the first two steps of the pathway, MEP is produced from the central metabolic intermediates pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate via 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP) by the activity of the enzymes DXP synthase (DXS) and DXP reductoisomerase (DXR). Because the MEP pathway is absent from humans, it was proposed as a promising new target to develop new antibiotics. However, the lethal phenotype caused by the deletion of DXS or DXR was found to be suppressed with a relatively high efficiency by unidentified mutations. Here we report that several mutations in the unrelated genes aceE and ribB rescue growth of DXS-defective mutants because the encoded enzymes allowed the production of sufficient DXP in vivo. Together, this work unveils the diversity of mechanisms that can evolve in bacteria to circumvent a blockage of the first step of the MEP pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2001155649,"Thyroid hormone receptor (TR) α and β mediate thyroid hormone action at target tissues. TR isoforms have specific roles in development and in adult tissues. The mechanisms underlying TR isoform-specific action, however, are not well understood. We demonstrate that posttranslational modification of TR by conjugation of small SUMO to TRα and TRβ plays an important role in triiodothyronine (T3) action and TR isoform specificity. TRα was sumoylated at lysines 283 and 389, and TRβ at lysines 50, 146, and 443. Sumoylation of TRβ was ligand-dependent, and sumoylation of TRα was ligand-independent. TRα-SUMO conjugation utilized the E3 ligase PIASxβ and TRβ-SUMO conjugation utilized predominantly PIAS1. SUMO1 and SUMO3 conjugation to TR was important for T3-dependent gene regulation, as demonstrated in transient transfection assay and studies of endogenous gene regulation. The functional role of SUMO1 and SUMO3 in T3 induction in transient expression assays was closely matched to the pattern of TR and cofactor recruitment to thyroid hormone response elements (TREs) as determined by ChIP assays. SUMO1 was required for the T3-induced recruitment of the co-activator CREB-binding protein (CBP) and release of nuclear receptor co-repressor (NCoR) on a TRE but had no significant effect on TR DNA binding. SUMO1 was required for T3-mediated recruitment of NCoR and release of CBP from the TSHβ-negative TRE. SUMO3 was required for T3-stimulated TR binding to the TSHβ-negative TRE and recruitment of NCoR. These findings demonstrate that conjugation of SUMO to TR has a TR-isoform preference and is important for T3-dependent gene induction and repression."
https://openalex.org/W2038260794,"In the honey bee (Apis mellifera), queen and workers have different behavior and reproductive capacity despite possessing the same genome. The primary substance that leads to this differentiation is royal jelly (RJ), which contains a range of proteins, amino acids, vitamins and nucleic acids. MicroRNA (miRNA) has been found to play an important role in regulating the expression of protein-coding genes and cell biology. In this study, we characterized the miRNAs in RJ from two honey bee sister species and determined their possible effect on transcriptome in one species.We sequenced the miRNAs in RJ either from A. mellifera (RJM) or A. cerana (RJC). We then determined the global transcriptomes of adult A. mellifera developed from larvae fed either with RJM (mRJM) or RJC (mRJC). Finally we analyzed the target genes of those miRNA that are species specific or differentially expressed in the two honey bee species. We show that there were differences in miRNA between RJM and RJC, and that transcriptomes of adult A. mellifera were affected by the two types of RJ. A high proportion (23.3%) of the affected genes were target genes of differential miRNAs.We show for the first time that there are differences in miRNAs in RJ between A. mellifera and A. cerana. Further, the differences in transcriptomes of bees reared from these two RJs might be related to miRNA differences of the two species. This study provides the first evidence that heterospecific royal jelly can modify gene expression in honey bees through an epigenetic mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2019734528,"Ion Channel-Coupled Receptors (ICCRs) are artificial receptor-channel fusion proteins designed to couple ligand binding to channel gating. We previously validated the ICCR concept with various G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) fused with the inward rectifying potassium channel Kir6.2. Here we characterize a novel ICCR, consisting of the light activated GPCR, opsin/rhodopsin, fused with Kir6.2. To validate our two-electrode voltage clamp (TEVC) assay for activation of the GPCR, we first co-expressed the apoprotein opsin and the G protein-activated potassium channel Kir3.1(F137S) (Kir3.1*) in Xenopus oocytes. Opsin can be converted to rhodopsin by incubation with 11-cis retinal and activated by light-induced retinal cis→trans isomerization. Alternatively opsin can be activated by incubation of oocytes with all-trans-retinal. We found that illumination of 11-cis-retinal-incubated oocytes co-expressing opsin and Kir3.1* caused an immediate and long-lasting channel opening. In the absence of 11-cis retinal, all-trans-retinal also opened the channel persistently, although with slower kinetics. We then used the oocyte/TEVC system to test fusion proteins between opsin/rhodopsin and Kir6.2. We demonstrate that a construct with a C-terminally truncated rhodopsin responds to light stimulus independent of G protein. By extending the concept of ICCRs to the light-activatable GPCR rhodopsin we broaden the potential applications of this set of tools."

However, a biphasic Zn2+ dose response was observed, suggesting that Zn2+ has dual effects on the channel (i.e. activating and inhibitory). To investigate the structural basis for this biphasic effect of Zn2+, we examined the effects of mutating the 10 extracellular His residues of mouse γENaC. Four mutations within the finger subdomain (γH193A, γH200A, γH202A, and γH239A) significantly reduced the maximal Zn2+ activation of the channel. Whereas γH193A, γH200A, and γH202A reduced the apparent affinity of the Zn2+ activating site, γH239A diminished Na+ self-inhibition and thus concealed the activating effects of Zn2+.

Previous studies have demonstrated that low concentrations of extracellular Zn2+ activate ENaC.

The response of ENaC to extracellular Zn2+ is biphasic. Low concentrations of Zn2+ activate the channel, with a maximal response at 100 μm Zn2+. Further increases in [Zn2+] reduce channel activity. This bell-shaped dose-response relationship suggests that Zn2+ enhances channel activity at low concentrations and is inhibitory at high concentrations (25Sheng S. Perry C.J. Kleyman T.R.

The crystal structure of the chicken acid-sensing ion channel 1 (cASIC1; homologous to ENaC) reveals a trimeric channel complex with a large extracellular domain (ECD) connected to the transmembrane domain via a wrist region (27Jasti J. Furukawa H. Gonzales E.B. Gouaux E. Structure of acid-sensing ion channel 1 at 1.9 Å resolution and low pH.Nature. 2007; 449: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). The extracellular region of a subunit is organized into five subdomains, referred to as palm, β-ball, knuckle, finger, and thumb. Recent studies suggest that the extracellular regions of ENaC subunits have a similar overall design to that of cASIC1 and that the ECD may sense various extracellular signals (12Collier D.M.

However, the exact locations where most extracellular factors interact with ENaC and the mechanistic details of how the initial contacts lead to altered channel activity remain elusive. The ECDs of ENaC subunits contain numerous residues, such as His, Cys, Glu, and Asp, which are capable of serving as Zn2+-binding ligands (32Dokmanić I. Sikić M. Tomić S.

Crystallogr. 2008; 64: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that some of these residues mediate Zn2+ interaction with ENaC. Several lines of evidence suggest that the γ-subunit has a particularly important role in regulating channel gating in response to external factors (11Kleyman T.R. Carattino M.D. Hughey R.P.

Mutations were introduced into His residues within the γ-subunit ECD to identify sites that have a role in the regulation of ENaC by Zn2+. Three His residues were identified within the finger subdomain that participate in a high-affinity Zn2+ activating site. Additionally, mutation of a palm subdomain His residue altered the low-affinity inhibitory response. These His residues are unique to the γ-subunit, as they are not found at the homologous sites in the α- and β-subunits. Point or multiple mutations were generated in mouse γENaC (γmENaC) cDNA in the pBluescript SK− vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Following mutagenesis, cDNAs were validated by sequencing. Wild-type ENaC α-, β-, and γ-subunit and mutant ENaC γ-subunit cRNAs were made using T3 RNA polymerase (Ambion), purified using an RNA purification kit (Qiagen), and quantified by spectrophotometry. ENaC expression in Xenopus oocytes and two-electrode voltage clamp were performed as reported previously (35Sheng S. Perry C.J. Kleyman T.R. External nickel inhibits epithelial sodium channel by binding to histidine residues within the extracellular domains of α- and γ-subunits and reducing channel open probability.J. Biol.

Stage V and VI oocytes free of follicle cell layers were injected with 1 ng of cRNA for each mENaC subunit per oocyte and incubated at 18 °C in modified Barth's saline (88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 15 mm HEPES, 0.3 mm Ca(NO3)2, 0.41 mm CaCl2, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 10 μg/ml sodium penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 100 μg/ml gentamycin sulfate, pH 7.4). All experiments were carried out at room temperature (20–24 °C). Two-electrode voltage clamp was performed using either an Axoclamp 900A amplifier (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) or a TEV-200 voltage clamp amplifier (Dagan Corp., Minneapolis, MN) and a DigiData 1440A interface (Molecular Devices). Data acquisition and analyses were done with pCLAMP 8 or 9 (Molecular Devices). Oocytes were placed in a recording chamber from Warner Instruments (Hamden, CT) and perfused with bath solutions at a constant flow rate of 12–15 ml/min. Oocytes were continuously clamped at −60 or −100 mV as specified in the figure legends. Na+ self-inhibition responses were examined as described previously (36Chraïbi A. Horisberger J.D. Sodium self inhibition of human epithelial sodium channel: temperature dependence and effect of extracellular proteases.J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 37Sheng S. Bruns J.B. Kleyman T.R. Extracellular histidine residues crucial for Na+ self-inhibition of epithelial Na+ channels.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9743-9749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Briefly, Na+ self-inhibition was determined by measuring the decrease in current from the peak (Ipeak) to a steady state (Iss) elicited by a rapid increase in extracellular Na+ concentration from 1 to 110 mm. The [Na+] jump was done by rapidly replacing a 1 mm Na+ bath solution (NaCl-1 containing 1 mm NaCl, 109 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine, 2 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) with a 110 mm Na+ bath solution (NaCl-110 containing 110 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Rapid solution exchange was performed with a 16-channel Teflon valve perfusion system (AutoMate Scientific, Inc., Berkeley, CA). The magnitude of Na+ self-inhibition was represented by the ratio of amiloride-sensitive Iss and Ipeak. A 1 m ZnCl2 stock solution (super pure, >99.999%, Sigma-Aldrich) was prepared in water and diluted to the desired concentrations in NaCl-110 bath solution. To examine Zn2+ dose responses, oocytes expressing mENaCs were continuously clamped at −60 mV while Zn2+ was applied at increasing concentrations in the range of 0.1 μm to 5 mm. Due to the limited solubility of ZnCl2 in NaCl-110 bath solution, Zn2+ concentrations >5 mm were not tested. At the end of an experiment, 10 μm amiloride was added to the bath to determine the amiloride-sensitive current. The changes in amiloride-sensitive currents in response to Zn2+ applications were used to analyze the dose-response relationship. Because the amiloride-sensitive current demonstrated a biphasic dose-response relationship with [Zn2+], we assumed that ENaCs possess a high-affinity activating site and a low-affinity inhibitory site for Zn2+. Thus, the normalized currents in the presence of increasing concentrations of Zn2+ were fitted with Equation 1,IR=(Imax-Imin)(C/(C+EC50))(IC50/(C+IC50))+Imin(Eq. 1) where IR is the relative current at certain [Zn2+] (i.e. current in the presence of Zn2+ normalized to current in the absence of Zn2+); Imax and Imin are the maximal and minimal normalized currents, respectively; C is the Zn2+ concentration; and EC50 and IC50 are the concentrations with 50% effects for the activating and inhibitory phases, respectively. Data are presented as means ± S.E. To minimize bias from batch-to-batch variation in oocytes, the significance in the differences between mutant and WT channels was always analyzed from data obtained in the same batches of oocytes. Student's t tests were used for comparison, and the significance levels are specified below and in the figure legends. Curve fittings were performed with OriginPro 8.5 (OriginLab, Northampton, MA). Because extracellular Zn2+ activates ENaC by relieving Na+ self-inhibition (25Sheng S. Perry C.J. Kleyman T.R. Extracellular Zn2+ activates epithelial Na+ channels by eliminating Na+ self-inhibition.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31687-31696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), the Na+ self-inhibition response and the effect of Zn2+ were examined sequentially in each oocyte. The Na+ self-inhibition response reflects a decrease in current from a peak (Ipeak) to a steady state (Iss), which is elicited by a rapid increase in the extracellular Na+ concentration from 1 to 110 mm (Fig. 1). As currents approached a steady-state level, increasing concentrations of Zn2+ were applied, and changes in current were measured. Increasing extracellular [Zn2+] in the range of ∼0.1–100 μm led to a dose-dependent increase in current. The current fell when extracellular [Zn2+] was increased above 100 μm. The maximal current in the presence of Zn2+ (Iznm) was essentially identical to the Ipeak observed following the increase in extracellular [Na+] (Iznm/Ipeak = 1.00 ± 0.01, n = 32), consistent with the notion that Zn2+ relieves ENaC from inhibition by external Na+. Fig. 1B illustrates the Zn2+ dose-response relationship. Mean amiloride-sensitive currents in the presence of increasing extracellular [Zn2+] were normalized to the base-line current. Similar to our previous report (25Sheng S. Perry C.J. Kleyman T.R. Extracellular Zn2+ activates epithelial Na+ channels by eliminating Na+ self-inhibition.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31687-31696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we observed a bell-shaped dose response to Zn2+. This relationship fits a model of ENaC possessing a high-affinity Zn2+ activating site and a low-affinity Zn2+ inhibitory site (R2 = 0.997, Equation 1, see “Experimental Procedures”) with an estimated EC50 and IC50 of 2.1 ± 0.1 μm (n = 6) and 2.1 ± 0.1 mm (n = 6), respectively. The maximal relative current observed at 100 μm Zn2+ was 1.68 ± 0.07 (n = 6). There are a total of 10 His residues within the ECD of the γ-subunit. Four residues are located within the finger subdomain, three in the β-ball subdomain, two in the palm subdomain, and one in the thumb subdomain (Fig. 2). We individually mutated these His residues to Ala and expressed the mutant γ-subunits together with WT α- and β-subunits in oocytes. We sequentially examined Na+ self-inhibition and the response to Zn2+ (FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4) to determine whether a mutation selectively disrupted the effect of Zn2+ on channel activity or secondarily altered the Zn2+ effect by modifying the Na+ self-inhibition response.FIGURE 4Mutation-induced changes in the magnitude of Na+ self-inhibition and the maximal Zn2+ activation of mENaC. Iss/Ipeak values are inversely proportional to the magnitude of Na+ self-inhibition. Iznm values represent the maximal relative currents in the presence of Zn2+. They were typically observed with 100 μm Zn2+ except for the γH88A mutant, which had Iznm at 1 mm. Note that Iznm is the observed value and different from the Imax (Table 1) that was derived from a best fit of the dose-response data. Black bars indicate that the values of mutants were significantly different (p < 0.01) from those of WT (n = 5–10), obtained in the same batch of oocytes. The dashed lines show the mean values pooled from all oocytes expressing WT mENaC obtained in the analyses of these mutants (Iss/Ipeak = 0.60 ± 0.01, Iznm = 1.73 ± 0.03, n = 32).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 3Mutations of five γHis residues differentially alter the effect of Zn2+. Representative traces for current changes in responses to [Na+] increases and Zn2+ applications are from oocytes expressing αβγmENaC (WT), αβγH88A, αβγH193A, αβγH200A, αβγH202A, and αβγH239A mENaCs. A simplified protocol for examining the effects of Zn2+ at only six concentrations compared with the one in Fig. 1 was used for both WT and mutant channels. The recording portions with 10 μm amiloride at the end of the experiments were omitted for clarity. These recordings represent at least six observations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Ala substitutions at 4 of the 10 extracellular γ-subunit His residues (γH193A, γH200A, γH202A, and γH239A) significantly reduced maximal ENaC activation by Zn2+ (FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4). Interestingly, all four of the extracellular His residues whose mutations reduced Zn2+ activation are within the predicted finger subdomain of the channel. In addition to suppressing Zn2+ activation, γH239A also diminished Na+ self-inhibition, similar to what was previously observed when γHis239 was substituted with other residues (37Sheng S. Bruns J.B. Kleyman T.R. Extracellular histidine residues crucial for Na+ self-inhibition of epithelial Na+ channels.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9743-9749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 38Winarski K.L. Sheng N. Chen J. Kleyman T.R. Sheng S.

Chem. 2010; 285: 26088-26096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). As the γH239A mutant was relieved of Na+ self-inhibition prior to the addition of Zn2+, it is not possible to determine whether this residue is involved in Zn2+ binding to the channel. On the other hand, γH193A, γH200A, and γH202A did not significantly alter the Na+ self-inhibition response, suggesting that these three His residues in the finger subdomain have specific roles in Zn2+ activation of ENaC. Although γH88A did not affect the maximal Zn2+ activation (p > 0.05 versus WT) or the Na+ self-inhibition response, it converted the Zn2+ dose response from bell-shaped to monophasic by selectively eliminating the inhibitory effect of high [Zn2+] (FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4). These results are consistent with a mutation-induced loss of a low-affinity Zn2+-binding site that mediates channel inhibition at high [Zn2+]. One mutation (γH283A) moderately increased the maximal Zn2+ activation (p < 0.01 versus WT) (Fig. 4). Collectively, these observations suggest that γHis88 within the palm subdomain and γHis193, γHis200, and γHis202 within the finger subdomain are involved in Zn2+-dependent regulation of ENaC. We analyzed the responses of WT and mutant channels to increasing [Zn2+] using a two-site model. Representative dose-response curves are shown in Fig. 5, and derived values for EC50 and IC50 are shown in Table 1. Our results show that γH88A did not affect the EC50 for the activating site, although it essentially eliminated the decrease in channel activity observed with higher [Zn2+]. In contrast, γH193A, γH200A, and γH202A reduced the sensitivity of mENaC to activation by extracellular Zn2+ and did not affect the inhibitory effect of high [Zn2+], leading to increased EC50 values and no change in the IC50 relative to WT. The results imply that γH193A, γH200A, and γH202A selectively reduce the apparent affinity of the potentiating site for Zn2+ while not interfering with the low-affinity Zn2+ inhibitory site.TABLE 1Fitting parameters for Zn2+ dose responsesOocytesImaxEC50IC50μmmmWT441.76 ± 0.032.10 ± 0.122.13 ± 0.14γH88A101.79 ± 0.092.58 ± 0.32>1000γH193A61.54 ± 0.03aThe values were significantly different from the WT values in the same batch of oocytes (p < 0.01).4.59 ± 0.46aThe values were significantly different from the WT values in the same batch of oocytes (p < 0.01).1.97 ± 0.28γH200A141.59 ± 0.03aThe values were significantly different from the WT values in the same batch of oocytes (p < 0.01).5.94 ± 0.27aThe values were significantly different from the WT values in the same"
https://openalex.org/W2043841668,"G-quadruplex structures, formed from guanine rich sequences, have previously been shown to be involved in various physiological processes including cancer-related gene expression. Furthermore, G-quadruplexes have been found in several oncogene promoter regions, and have been shown to play a role in the regulation of gene expression. The mutagenic properties of oxidative stress on DNA have been widely studied, as has the association with carcinogenesis. Guanine is the most susceptible nucleotide to oxidation, and as such, G-rich sequences that form G-quadruplexes can be viewed as potential “hot-spots” for DNA oxidation. We propose that oxidation may destabilise the G-quadruplex structure, leading to its unfolding into the duplex structure, affecting gene expression. This would imply a possible mechanism by which oxidation may impact on oncogene expression. This work investigates the effect of oxidation on two biologically relevant G-quadruplex structures through 500 ns molecular dynamics simulations on those found in the promoter regions of the c-Kit and c-Myc oncogenes. The results show oxidation having a detrimental effect on stability of the structure, substantially destabilising the c-Kit quadruplex, and with a more attenuated effect on the c-Myc quadruplex. Results are suggestive of a novel route for oxidation-mediated oncogenesis and may have wider implications for genome stability."
https://openalex.org/W1970998298,"Background Football (soccer) is endorsed as a health-promoting physical activity worldwide. When football programs are introduced as part of general health promotion programs, equal access and limitation of pre-participation disparities with regard to injury risk are important. The aim of this study was to explore if disparity with regard to parents’ educational level, player body mass index (BMI), and self-reported health are determinants of football injury in community-based football programs, separately or in interaction with age or gender. Methodology/Principal Findings Four community football clubs with 1230 youth players agreed to participate in the cross-sectional study during the 2006 season. The study constructs (parents’ educational level, player BMI, and self-reported health) were operationalized into questionnaire items. The 1-year prevalence of football injury was defined as the primary outcome measure. Data were collected via a postal survey and analyzed using a series of hierarchical statistical computations investigating associations with the primary outcome measure and interactions between the study variables. The survey was returned by 827 (67.2%) youth players. The 1-year injury prevalence increased with age. For youths with parents with higher formal education, boys reported more injuries and girls reported fewer injuries than expected; for youths with lower educated parents there was a tendency towards the opposite pattern. Youths reporting injuries had higher standardized BMI compared with youths not reporting injuries. Children not reporting full health were slightly overrepresented among those reporting injuries and underrepresented for those reporting no injury. Conclusion Pre-participation disparities in terms of parents’ educational level, through interaction with gender, BMI, and self-reported general health are associated with increased injury risk in community-based youth football. When introduced as a general health promotion, football associations should adjust community-based youth programs to accommodate children and adolescents with increased pre-participation injury risk."
https://openalex.org/W2148426517,"Proglucagon, which is encoded by the glucagon gene (Gcg), is the precursor of several peptide hormones, including glucagon and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1). Whereas glucagon stimulates hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, GLP-1 stimulates insulin secretion to lower blood glucose and also supports ß-cell proliferation and protection from apoptotic stimuli. Pregnancy is a strong inducer of change in islet function, however the roles of proglucagon-derived peptides in pregnancy are only partially understood. In the present study, we analyzed fertility and pregnancy-associated changes in homozygous glucagon-green fluorescent protein (gfp) knock-in mice (Gcg(gfp/gfp)), which lack all the peptides derived from proglucagon. Female Gcg(gfp/gfp) mice could deliver and raise Gcg(gfp/gfp) pups to weaning and Gcg(gfp/gfp) pups from Gcg(gfp/gfp) dams were viable and fertile. Pregnancy induced ß-cell proliferation in Gcg(gfp/gfp) mice as well as in control mice. However, serum insulin levels in pregnant Gcg(gfp/gfp) females were lower than those in control pregnant females under ad libitum feeding, and blood glucose levels in pregnant Gcg(gfp/gfp) females were higher after gestational day 12. Gcg(gfp/gfp) females showed a decreased pregnancy rate and smaller litter size. The rate of successful breeding was significantly lower in Gcg(gfp/gfp) females and was not improved by experience of breeding. Taken together, proglucagon-derived peptides are not required for pregnancy-associated ß-cell proliferation, however, are required for regulation of blood glucose levels and normal reproductive capacity. Gcg(gfp/gfp) mice may serve as a novel model to analyze the effect of mild hyperglycemia during late gestational periods."
https://openalex.org/W2087654835,"Glycosylation is an important and universal post-translational modification for many proteins, and regulates protein functions. However, simple and rapid methods to analyze glycans on individual proteins have not been available until recently.A new technique to analyze glycopeptides in a highly sensitive manner by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) using the liquid matrix 3AQ/CHCA was developed recently and we optimized this technique to analyze a small amount of transmembrane protein separated by SDS-PAGE. We used the MALDI-MS method to evaluate glycosylation status of membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP). O-glycosylation of MT1-MMP is reported to modulate its protease activity and thereby to affect cancer cell invasion. MT1-MMP expressed in human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells was immunoprecipitated and resolved by SDS-PAGE. After in-gel tryptic digestion of the protein, a single droplet of the digest was applied directly to the liquid matrix on a MALDI target plate. Concentration of hydrophilic glycopeptides within the central area occurred due to gradual evaporation of the sample solution, whereas nonglycosylated hydrophobic peptides remained at the periphery. This specific separation and concentration of the glycopeptides enabled comprehensive analysis of the MT1-MMP O-glycosylation.We demonstrate, for the first time, heterogeneous O-glycosylation profile of a protein by a whole protein analysis using MALDI-MS. Since cancer cells are reported to have altered glycosylation of proteins, this easy-to-use method for glycopeptide analysis opens up the possibility to identify specific glycosylation patterns of proteins that can be used as new biomarkers for malignant tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2030450800,"High Na(+) intake is a reality in nowadays and is frequently accompanied by renal and cardiovascular alterations. In this study, renal mechanisms underlying perinatal Na(+) overload-programmed alterations in Na(+) transporters and the renin/angiotensin system (RAS) were investigated, together with effects of short-term treatment with enalapril in terms of reprogramming molecular alterations in kidney.Male adult Wistar rats were obtained from dams maintained throughout pregnancy and lactation on a standard diet and drinking water (control) or 0.17 M NaCl (saline group). Enalapril (100 mg/l), an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, was administered for three weeks after weaning. Ninety day old offspring from dams that drank saline presented with proximal tubules exhibiting increased (Na(+)+K(+))ATPase expression and activity. Ouabain-insensitive Na(+)-ATPase activity remained unchanged but its response to angiotensin II (Ang II) was lost. PKC, PKA, renal thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), macrophage infiltration and collagen deposition markedly increased, and AT(2) receptor expression decreased while AT(1) expression was unaltered. Early treatment with enalapril reduced expression and activity of (Na(+)+K(+))ATPase, partially recovered the response of Na(+)-ATPase to Ang II, and reduced PKC and PKA activities independently of whether offspring were exposed to high perinatal Na(+) or not. In addition, treatment with enalapril per se reduced AT(2) receptor expression, and increased TBARS, macrophage infiltration and collagen deposition. The perinatally Na(+)-overloaded offspring presented high numbers of Ang II-positive cortical cells, and significantly lower circulating Ang I, indicating that programming/reprogramming impacted systemic and local RAS.Maternal Na(+) overload programmed alterations in renal Na(+) transporters and in its regulation, as well as severe structural lesions in adult offspring. Enalapril was beneficial predominantly through its influence on Na(+) pumping activities in adult offspring. However, side effects including down-regulation of PKA, PKC and AT(2) receptors and increased TBARS could impair renal function in later life."
https://openalex.org/W1966573638,"Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is the most prevalent manifestation of the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies or prion diseases affecting humans. The disease encompasses a spectrum of clinical phenotypes that have been correlated with molecular subtypes that are characterized by the molecular mass of the protease-resistant fragment of the disease-related conformation of the prion protein and a polymorphism at codon 129 of the gene encoding the prion protein. A cell-free assay of prion protein misfolding was used to investigate the ability of these sporadic CJD molecular subtypes to propagate using brain-derived sources of the cellular prion protein (PrP(C)). This study confirmed the presence of three distinct sporadic CJD molecular subtypes with PrP(C) substrate requirements that reflected their codon 129 associations in vivo. However, the ability of a sporadic CJD molecular subtype to use a specific PrP(C) substrate was not determined solely by codon 129 as the efficiency of prion propagation was also influenced by the composition of the brain tissue from which the PrP(C) substrate was sourced, thus indicating that nuances in PrP(C) or additional factors may determine sporadic CJD subtype. The results of this study will aid in the design of diagnostic assays that can detect prion disease across the diversity of sporadic CJD subtypes."
https://openalex.org/W2005743904,"As a part of the negative feedback mechanism, CpG DNA induces IRAK-M expression in monocytic cells. In the present study we investigated a biochemical signaling pathway and the transcription factors responsible for CpG DNA-mediated Irak-m gene expression. CpG DNA-induced Irak-m expression did not require new protein synthesis and was regulated at the transcriptional level through an endosomal pH-sensitive TLR9/MyD88 signaling pathway. Over-expression of the dominant negative (DN) form of or gene-specific knockdown of signaling modulators in the TLR9 pathway demonstrated that IRAK4, IRAK1, IRAK2, and PKD1 are required for Irak-m transcription induced by CpG DNA. Over-expression of DN-IRAK1 only partially, but significantly, inhibited CpG DNA-induced Irak-m promoter activity. While IRAK1 was critical for the initial phase, IRAK2 was required for the late phase of TLR9 signaling by sustaining activation of PKD1 that leads to activation of NF-κB and MAPKs. Irak-m promoter-luciferase reporters with alterations in the predicted cis-acting transcriptional regulatory elements revealed that the NF-κB consensus site in the Irak-m promoter region is absolutely required for Irak-m gene expression. AP-1 and CREB binding sites also contributed to the optimal Irak-m expression by CpG DNA. Collectively, our results demonstrate that IRAK2 plays a key role in the TLR9-mediated transcriptional regulation of Irak-m expression by sustaining activation of PKD1 and NF-κB."

We report here that miR290-5p (100049710) and miR292-5p (100049711) are induced at the pre-B stage of murine B cell development and that they influence assembly of the Igκ light chain gene (243469) by contributing to the activation of germline Igκ transcription (κGT). We found that upon forced over-expression of miR290-5p/292-5p in Abelson Murine Leukemia Virus (AMuLV) transformed pro-B cells, two known activators of κGT, E2A (21423) and NF-κB (19697), show increased chromosomal binding to the kappa intronic enhancer.

Furthermore, miR290-5p/292-5p knockdown also diminishes κGT activation, but not Rag1/2 (19373, 19374) expression, in an IL-7 dependent primary pro-B cell culture system. In addition, we identified a deficiency in κGT induction in miR290 cluster knockout mice. We hypothesize that increased expression of miR290-5p and miR292-5p contributes to the induction of κGT at the pre-B stage of B cell development through increased binding of NF-κB and E2A to kappa locus regulatory sequences."

In mesic temperate forests of North America, stand-replacing crown fire occurs infrequently, with a return interval of 2000-3000 years. Rare chance events, however, may have profound impacts on the developmental trajectories of forest ecosystems. For example, it has been postulated that stand-replacing fire may have been an important factor in the establishment of eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) stands in the northern Great Lakes region. Nevertheless, experimental evidence linking hemlock regeneration to non-anthropogenic fire is limited. To clarify this potential relationship, we monitored vegetation dynamics following a rare lightning-origin crown fire in a Wisconsin hemlock-hardwood forest. We also studied vegetation in bulldozer-created fire breaks and adjacent undisturbed forest. Our results indicate that hemlock establishment was rare in the burned area but moderately common in the scarified bulldozer lines compared to the reference area. Early-successional, non-arboreal species including Rubus spp., Vaccinium angustifolium, sedges (Carex spp.), grasses, Epilobium ciliatum, and Pteridium aquilinium were the most abundant post-fire species. Collectively, our results suggest that competing vegetation and moisture stress resulting from drought may reduce the efficacy of scarification treatments as well as the usefulness of fire for preparing a suitable seedbed for hemlock. The increasing prevalence of growing-season drought suggests that silvicultural strategies based on historic disturbance regimes may need to be reevaluated for mesic species."
