https://openalex.org/W2075508629,"Two longitudinal surveys based on random samples of high school students in New York State indicate four stages in the sequence of involvement with drugs: beer or wine, or both; cigarettes or hard liquor; marihuana; and other illicit drugs. The legal drugs are necessary intermediates between nonuse and marihuana. Whereas 27 percent of high school students who smoke and drink progress to marihuana within a 5- to 6-month follow-up period, only 2 percent of those who have not used any legal substance do so. Marihuana, in turn, is a crucial step on the way to other illicit drugs. While 26 percent of marihuana users progress to LSD, amphetamines, or heroin, only 1 percent of nondrug marihuana users and 4 percent of legal drug users do so. This sequence is found in each of the 4 years in high school and in the year after graduation. The reverse sequence holds for regression in drug use."
https://openalex.org/W2046132060,"A new radioreceptor assay was used to quantify changes in serum concentration of 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in rats with low calcium or low phosphate diets. Low availability of either ion elicits a fivefold increase in the circulating concentration of 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. The enhancement of 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 concentration in response to calcium deficiency is dependent on the presence of the parathyroid or thyroid glands (or both), suggesting that this effect is mediated by parathyroid hormone. In contrast, the response of phosphate deficiency is independent of these glands and may result from an action of low serum phosphate concentration or some factor associated with phosphate depletion on the renal synthesis of the 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 hormone."

These results may support a closed loop extension of the corollary discharge theory, with oculomotor commands based on perceived object velocity."

This regularly spaced, negatively charged aspartic acid may function as a template upon which mineralization occurs."
https://openalex.org/W1978804620,"Twenty-four subjects with abnormal binocular experience, due to a condition of convergent strabismus that existed during different periods of their lives, were tested. Interocular transfer of the tilt-aftereffect was used to assess binocularity. Individuals between 1 and 3 years of age are most susceptible to abnormal binocular experience."
https://openalex.org/W2072571560,"Preferences for the tastes of sucrose, lactose, and sodium chloride were measured in 618 subjects between 9 and 15 years of age and in 140 adults. The younger subjects preferred greater sweetness and saltiness than did the adults. In the younger groups, there were race and sex differences in preferences, none of which appeared among the adults."

The chromatic properties of cone horizontal cell responses may be explained if the cone horizontal cells act as interneurons, receiving from cones through their central processes but acting on cones through their lateral processes."

Parallel real space refinements on the two molecules show relatively few changes, but do show the carbon monoxide molecule with the iron atom moving into the heme plane."
https://openalex.org/W2082124023,"Several types of apnea are described in premature infants and in infants who have survived breathing-stoppage episodes which may be related to the sudden infant death syndrome. Upper airway apnea appears to induce the greatest changes: oxygen desaturation is more pronounced than in a central apnea of similar duration, and secondary cardiac changes are observed earlier and are more severe."
https://openalex.org/W2084456057,"Impregnation of nuclear track emulsion with liquid scintillator and exposure at -85°C allows rapid autoradiographic labeling. With tritiated thymidine of high specific activity (40 to 60 curies per millimole), exposure time can be shortened to 20 to 60 minutes, allowing complete sample processing within 4 hours. In experiments requiring isotopes with low incorporation rates or low specific activity, exposure time can be shortened from months to several days."
https://openalex.org/W2093841981,"Recent reports have stated that the orientation selectivity of cells in the cat's visual cortex can be biased by limiting the early visual environment to stripes of one orientation. Data obtained from seven kittens using systematic and quantitative sampling of preferred orientation, together with a blind procedure, do not show a bias toward the orientation presented in one type of restricted rearing environment."
https://openalex.org/W2083699273,"Infants prefer to look at horizontal and vertical gratings rather than at oblique gratings only when they are at or near threshold spatial frequencies, as would be expected if acuity for oblique edges is lower than that for horizontal and vertical edges. That such a bias exists as early as 6 weeks of age suggests that the orientational asymmetry of the visual system depends on endogenous maturation rathat than exposure to a carpentered world."

https://openalex.org/W2143473038,"The quantities of immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies to grass or ragweed allergens were measured by an immunoabsorption in the serums of patients sensitive to one of these allergens. IgE antibodies to grass or ragweed allergens accounted for means of 30 and 29 percent of the total IgE protein. After the ragweed pollination season, the levels of serum IgE antibodies to ragweed allergens rose dramatically and in postpollination serums they accounted for 39 percent of the total IgE protein with a range from 13 to 50 percent."

https://openalex.org/W2004562533,"THE killing target of penicillin in bacteria is a membrane-bound transpeptidase which catalyses peptide cross linking during wall peptidoglycan synthesis1,2. Streptomyces R61 and R39 excrete during growth DD-carboxypeptidase-transpeptidase enzymes3,4 which seem to be soluble forms of the corresponding membrane-bound transpeptidases5. The exocellular enzymes (E) convert penicillin (I) in to a chemically altered and biologically inactive compound (X)6,7. Kinetically, the simplest mechanism5 for the conversion of I into X is The first step, a rapid equilibrium process, leads to the formation of an equimolar and inactive enzyme–antibiotic complex EI. This complex isomerises into a modified complex EI* which, in turn, undergoes irreversible breakdown. If the experiment is carried out in conditions in which the enzyme is stable, the enzyme is reactivated and recovers its initial penicillin sensitivity. The breakdown of complex EI* is a slow process. At 37 °C and in 10 mM Na phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 (in which conditions the R61 enzyme is stable) the half life of the R61 enzyme–benzylpenicillin EI* complex is 80 min (ref. 7). At 37 °C and in 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.7, containing 0.1 M NaCl and 0.05 M MgCl2 (in which conditions the R39 enzyme is stable), the half life of the R39 enzyme–benzylpenicillin is 4,250 min (ref. 6). As the enzyme is reactivated during the process, no enzyme is irretrievably lost on reaction with penicillin and after several cycles of inactivation and reactivation, both the enzyme and the accumulated X compound can be reisolated. This technique was applied to 14C-benzylpenicillin (benzyl labelled) and the 14C-X compound produced was isolated."

https://openalex.org/W1991863509,"A new method of noninvasive sensing of the subsurface temperature distribution in human and animal tissue is described. Thermal radiation emitted from subsurface depths of several centimeters can be detected with microwave receivers. Temperature sensitivity of order 0.1 degree C and spatial resolution of approximately 1 by 2 centimeters have been obtained. Measurements demonstrating the technique, with feline and human tissue, are reported. A potential medical application is the detection of subsurface thermal anomalies such as malignant tumors and regions of vascular insufficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2081213991,"Neurons in the visual cortex that respond preferentially to diagonal contours are present only in cats exposed to diagonal lines early in life. In contrast, cells that prefer horizontal or vertical contours are found following exposure to horizontal, to vertical, and to diagonal lines. Such cells do not require a specific visual input for maintenance or for development; neurons responding preferentially to diagonal lines do."

https://openalex.org/W1980649200,"An in vitro system has been developed in which F1 spleen cells can generate cytotoxic activity directed specifically against parental cells. The antigenic differences detected are controlled by the H-2D-Hh-1 region of the murine major histocompatibility complex. The parent-F1 combinations demonstrating F1 antiparent activity in vitro are the same as those demonstrating F1 rejection of parental hemopoietic grafts in vivo. Hence, the F1 antiparent cytotoxicity test serves as an in vitro model for the recognition and effector phases of hybrid resistance to parental hemopoietic grafts and may be of value in clinical transplantation."
https://openalex.org/W2058520021,"Mating behavior in male hamsters depends on the sense of smell. Thus, complete transection of the lateral olfactory tract in adults eliminates mating. If the cut is made early in life, however, mating is spared. Partial section of the tract in adults does not affect mating, but similar cuts in the neonate lead to impaired mating performance later in life. Observed postsurgical rearrangements in the connections of axons in the lateral olfactory tract may explain both the sparing and the deterioration of function."
https://openalex.org/W1979987943,Alpha-Lactalbumin was isolated from mature human milk and utilized as an immunogen in rabbits. A radioimmunoassay was developed that was capable of detecting nanogram quantities of the antigen. Alpha-Lactalbumin synthesis was detected in human breast cancer cells (MCF-7) cultivated as a continuous cell line in vitro. Other human carcinoma epithelial cell lines (throat and cervix) failed to react in this assay. The ability to synthesize alpha-lactalbumin by breast carcinoma cells appeared to be independent of the addition of prolactin to the culture medium.

https://openalex.org/W2077917335,"Relative biological effectiveness (RBE) for chromosome damage in liver cells was determined after low dose rate exposures to alpha, beta, or gamma irradiation. Protracted exposures to beta and gamma irradiation were equally effective, whereas low dose rate exposures to alpha emitters were 15 to 20 times more damaging than exposures to beta or gamma irradiation. These data support the use of the quality factor of 10 recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection and the National Council on Radiation Protection for estimating the biological hazard from internally deposited alpha emitters. When the dose rates were low, all types of chromosome damage observed were produced by single-hit processes."
https://openalex.org/W1978330755,Rabbit blastocysts recovered at 144 hours post coitum contained the prostaglandins F and E-A. We suggest that one or more of these prostaglandins act as mediators in blastocyst steroidogenesis. (In another study we have demonstrated steroidogenesis in rabbit blastocysts).
https://openalex.org/W2054160853,"[6-3H]-1alpha-Hydroxyvitamin D3 was chemically synthesized and its full biological activity and radiochemical purity were demonstrated. With the use of this preparation it has been possible to demonstrate in vivo that in rats the [6-3H]-1Alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 is converted to [6-3H]-1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, the natural hormone. In fact, in the intestine and bone of rats given 32 picomoles of [6-3H]-1alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 each day for 6 days, more than 80 percent of the lipid-soluble radioactivity exists as [6-3H]-1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, a finding that suggests that much of the biological effectiveness of 1alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 is due to its conversion to 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3."

https://openalex.org/W2038809715,Deoxycorticosterone-adenine monohydrate is the first complex involving a steroid and a component of DNA to be successfully crystallized and studied by single crystal x-ray analysis. Hydrogen bonds between O(20) and N(6) as well as O(21) and N(1) connect the corticoid side chain to an adenine molecule. The molecules are also packed such that a second adenine moiety is situated over the delta4-3-one region of the steroid. These observations of the solid state suggest ways in which steroids and nucleic acids may interact in vivo.

The results indicate that (i) the brain in vivo is a significant source of PGF2alpha, (ii) the release of PGF2alpha from the brain occurs in pulses with a circhoral rhythm, and (iii) the process through which estrogen exerts its negative and positive feedback effects on luteinizing hormone secretion may involve amplitude modulation of PGF2alpha output from the brain."
