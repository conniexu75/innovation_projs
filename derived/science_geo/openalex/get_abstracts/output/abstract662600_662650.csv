https://openalex.org/W3093900830,"To better understand host-virus genetic dependencies and find potential therapeutic targets for COVID-19, we performed a genome-scale CRISPR loss-of-function screen to identify host factors required for SARS-CoV-2 viral infection of human alveolar epithelial cells. Top-ranked genes cluster into distinct pathways, including the vacuolar ATPase proton pump, Retromer, and Commander complexes. We validate these gene targets using several orthogonal methods such as CRISPR knockout, RNA interference knockdown, and small-molecule inhibitors. Using single-cell RNA-sequencing, we identify shared transcriptional changes in cholesterol biosynthesis upon loss of top-ranked genes. In addition, given the key role of the ACE2 receptor in the early stages of viral entry, we show that loss of RAB7A reduces viral entry by sequestering the ACE2 receptor inside cells. Overall, this work provides a genome-scale, quantitative resource of the impact of the loss of each host gene on fitness/response to viral infection."

Here we performed genome-wide CRISPR screens in Vero-E6 cells with SARS-CoV-2, Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), bat CoV HKU5 expressing the SARS-CoV-1 spike, and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike. We identified known SARS-CoV-2 host factors, including the receptor ACE2 and protease Cathepsin L. We additionally discovered pro-viral genes and pathways, including HMGB1 and the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, that are SARS lineage and pan-coronavirus specific, respectively. We show that HMGB1 regulates ACE2 expression and is critical for entry of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, and NL63. We also show that small-molecule antagonists of identified gene products inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in monkey and human cells, demonstrating the conserved role of these genetic hits across species. This identifies potential therapeutic targets for SARS-CoV-2 and reveals SARS lineage-specific and pan-CoV host factors that regulate susceptibility to highly pathogenic CoVs."
https://openalex.org/W3094691047,"Since their discovery in 2007, much effort has been devoted to uncovering the sources of the extragalactic, millisecond-duration fast radio bursts (FRBs). A class of neutron star known as magnetars is a leading candidate source of FRBs. Magnetars have surface magnetic fields in excess of $10^{14}$ G, the decay of which powers a range of high-energy phenomena. Here we present the discovery of a millisecond-duration radio burst from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154, with a fluence of $1.5\pm 0.3$ Mega-Jansky milliseconds. This event, termed ST 200428A(=FRB 200428), was detected on 28 April 2020 by the STARE2 radio array in the 1281--1468\,MHz band. The isotropic-equivalent energy released in ST 200428A is $4\times10^{3}$ times greater than in any Galactic radio burst previously observed on similar timescales. ST 200428A is just 40 times less energetic than the weakest extragalactic FRB observed to date, and is arguably drawn from the same population as the observed FRB sample. The coincidence of ST 200428A with an X-ray burst favours emission models developed for FRBs that describe synchrotron masers or electromagnetic pulses powered by magnetar bursts and giant flares. The discovery of ST 200428A implies that active magnetars like SGR 1935+2154 can produce FRBs at extragalactic distances. The high volumetric rate of events like ST 200428A motivates dedicated searches for similar bursts from nearby galaxies."
https://openalex.org/W3097323184,"The growing importance of applications based on machine learning is driving the need to develop dedicated, energy-efficient electronic hardware. Compared with von Neumann architectures, which have separate processing and storage units, brain-inspired in-memory computing uses the same basic device structure for logic operations and data storage1–3, thus promising to reduce the energy cost of data-centred computing substantially4. Although there is ample research focused on exploring new device architectures, the engineering of material platforms suitable for such device designs remains a challenge. Two-dimensional materials5,6 such as semiconducting molybdenum disulphide, MoS2, could be promising candidates for such platforms thanks to their exceptional electrical and mechanical properties7–9. Here we report our exploration of large-area MoS2 as an active channel material for developing logic-in-memory devices and circuits based on floating-gate field-effect transistors (FGFETs). The conductance of our FGFETs can be precisely and continuously tuned, allowing us to use them as building blocks for reconfigurable logic circuits in which logic operations can be directly performed using the memory elements. After demonstrating a programmable NOR gate, we show that this design can be simply extended to implement more complex programmable logic and a functionally complete set of operations. Our findings highlight the potential of atomically thin semiconductors for the development of next-generation low-power electronics. Logic operations and reconfigurable circuits are demonstrated that can be directly implemented using memory elements based on floating-gate field-effect transistors with monolayer MoS2 as the active channel material."
https://openalex.org/W3095091383,"The central nervous system has historically been viewed as an immune-privileged site, but recent data have shown that the meninges-the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord-contain a diverse population of immune cells1. So far, studies have focused on macrophages and T cells, but have not included a detailed analysis of meningeal humoral immunity. Here we show that, during homeostasis, the mouse and human meninges contain IgA-secreting plasma cells. These cells are positioned adjacent to dural venous sinuses: regions of slow blood flow with fenestrations that can potentially permit blood-borne pathogens to access the brain2. Peri-sinus IgA plasma cells increased with age and following a breach of the intestinal barrier. Conversely, they were scarce in germ-free mice, but their presence was restored by gut re-colonization. B cell receptor sequencing confirmed that meningeal IgA+ cells originated in the intestine. Specific depletion of meningeal plasma cells or IgA deficiency resulted in reduced fungal entrapment in the peri-sinus region and increased spread into the brain following intravenous challenge, showing that meningeal IgA is essential for defending the central nervous system at this vulnerable venous barrier surface."
https://openalex.org/W3095662667,"Deciphering how neuronal diversity is established and maintained requires a detailed knowledge of neuronal gene expression throughout development. In contrast to mammalian brains1,2, the large neuronal diversity of the Drosophila optic lobe3 and its connectome4-6 are almost completely characterized. However, a molecular characterization of this neuronal diversity, particularly during development, has been lacking. Here we present insights into brain development through a nearly complete description of the transcriptomic diversity of the optic lobes of Drosophila. We acquired the transcriptome of 275,000 single cells at adult and at five pupal stages, and built a machine-learning framework to assign them to almost 200 cell types at all time points during development. We discovered two large neuronal populations that wrap neuropils during development but die just before adulthood, as well as neuronal subtypes that partition dorsal and ventral visual circuits by differential Wnt signalling throughout development. Moreover, we show that the transcriptomes of neurons that are of the same type but are produced days apart become synchronized shortly after their production. During synaptogenesis we also resolved neuronal subtypes that, although differing greatly in morphology and connectivity, converge to indistinguishable transcriptomic profiles in adults. Our datasets almost completely account for the known neuronal diversity of the Drosophila optic lobes, and serve as a paradigm to understand brain development across species."
https://openalex.org/W3105146258,"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are mysterious millisecond-duration radio transients of unknown origin observed at extragalactic distances. It has been long speculated that magnetars are the engine powering repeating bursts from FRB sources, but no convincing evidence has been collected so far\cite{sun19}. Recently, the Galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 entered an active phase by emitting intense soft Gamma-ray bursts. One FRB-like event with two peaks (FRB 200428) and a luminosity slightly lower than the faintest extragalactic FRBs was detected from the source, in association with a soft Gamma-ray / hard X-ray flare. Here we report an eight-hour targeted radio observational campaign comprising four sessions and assisted by multi-wavelength (optical and hard X-rays) data. During the third session, 29 soft Gamma-ray repeater (SGR) bursts were detected in Gamma-ray energies. Throughout the observing period, we detected no single dispersed pulsed emission coincident with the arrivals of SGR bursts, but unfortunately we were not observing when the FRB was detected. The non-detection places a fluence upper limit that is eight orders of magnitude lower than the fluence of FRB 200428. Our results suggest that FRB -- SGR burst associations are rare. FRBs may be highly relativistic and geometrically beamed, or FRB-like events associated with SGR bursts may have narrow spectra and characteristic frequencies outside the observed band. It is also possible that the physical conditions required to achieve coherent radiation in SGR bursts are difficult to satisfy, and that only under extreme conditions could an FRB be associated with an SGR burst."
https://openalex.org/W3096284929,"G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are membrane proteins that modulate physiology across human tissues in response to extracellular signals. GPCR-mediated signalling can differ because of changes in the sequence1,2 or expression3 of the receptors, leading to signalling bias when comparing diverse physiological systems4. An underexplored source of such bias is the generation of functionally diverse GPCR isoforms with different patterns of expression across different tissues. Here we integrate data from human tissue-level transcriptomes, GPCR sequences and structures, proteomics, single-cell transcriptomics, population-wide genetic association studies and pharmacological experiments. We show how a single GPCR gene can diversify into several isoforms with distinct signalling properties, and how unique isoform combinations expressed in different tissues can generate distinct signalling states. Depending on their structural changes and expression patterns, some of the detected isoforms may influence cellular responses to drugs and represent new targets for developing drugs with improved tissue selectivity. Our findings highlight the need to move from a canonical to a context-specific view of GPCR signalling that considers how combinatorial expression of isoforms in a particular cell type, tissue or organism collectively influences receptor signalling and drug responses. Transcriptomics, proteomics, single-cell RNA sequencing, population-wide genetic association studies and structure–function analyses provide a picture of how the differential expression of G-protein-coupled receptor isoforms can diversify signalling in different tissues."

https://openalex.org/W3097722104,"Atrial fibrillation, the most common cardiac arrhythmia, is an important contributor to mortality and morbidity, and particularly to the risk of stroke in humans1. Atrial-tissue fibrosis is a central pathophysiological feature of atrial fibrillation that also hampers its treatment; the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood and warrant investigation given the inadequacy of present therapies2. Here we show that calcitonin, a hormone product of the thyroid gland involved in bone metabolism3, is also produced by atrial cardiomyocytes in substantial quantities and acts as a paracrine signal that affects neighbouring collagen-producing fibroblasts to control their proliferation and secretion of extracellular matrix proteins. Global disruption of calcitonin receptor signalling in mice causes atrial fibrosis and increases susceptibility to atrial fibrillation. In mice in which liver kinase B1 is knocked down specifically in the atria, atrial-specific knockdown of calcitonin promotes atrial fibrosis and increases and prolongs spontaneous episodes of atrial fibrillation, whereas atrial-specific overexpression of calcitonin prevents both atrial fibrosis and fibrillation. Human patients with persistent atrial fibrillation show sixfold lower levels of myocardial calcitonin compared to control individuals with normal heart rhythm, with loss of calcitonin receptors in the fibroblast membrane. Although transcriptome analysis of human atrial fibroblasts reveals little change after exposure to calcitonin, proteomic analysis shows extensive alterations in extracellular matrix proteins and pathways related to fibrogenesis, infection and immune responses, and transcriptional regulation. Strategies to restore disrupted myocardial calcitonin signalling thus may offer therapeutic avenues for patients with atrial fibrillation."
https://openalex.org/W3096906520,"Interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) has previously been identified as an endosomal protein that blocks viral infection1-3. Here we studied clinical cohorts of patients with B cell leukaemia and lymphoma, and identified IFITM3 as a strong predictor of poor outcome. In normal resting B cells, IFITM3 was minimally expressed and mainly localized in endosomes. However, engagement of the B cell receptor (BCR) induced both expression of IFITM3 and phosphorylation of this protein at Tyr20, which resulted in the accumulation of IFITM3 at the cell surface. In B cell leukaemia, oncogenic kinases phosphorylate IFITM3 at Tyr20, which causes constitutive localization of this protein at the plasma membrane. In a mouse model, Ifitm3-/- naive B cells developed in normal numbers; however, the formation of germinal centres and the production of antigen-specific antibodies were compromised. Oncogenes that induce the development of leukaemia and lymphoma did not transform Ifitm3-/- B cells. Conversely, the phosphomimetic IFITM3(Y20E) mutant induced oncogenic PI3K signalling and initiated the transformation of premalignant B cells. Mechanistic experiments revealed that IFITM3 functions as a PIP3 scaffold and central amplifier of PI3K signalling. The amplification of PI3K signals depends on IFITM3 using two lysine residues (Lys83 and Lys104) in its conserved intracellular loop as a scaffold for the accumulation of PIP3. In Ifitm3-/- B cells, lipid rafts were depleted of PIP3, which resulted in the defective expression of over 60 lipid-raft-associated surface receptors, and impaired BCR signalling and cellular adhesion. We conclude that the phosphorylation of IFITM3 that occurs after B cells encounter antigen induces a dynamic switch from antiviral effector functions in endosomes to a PI3K amplification loop at the cell surface. IFITM3-dependent amplification of PI3K signalling, which in part acts downstream of the BCR, is critical for the rapid expansion of B cells with high affinity to antigen. In addition, multiple oncogenes depend on IFITM3 to assemble PIP3-dependent signalling complexes and amplify PI3K signalling for malignant transformation."

https://openalex.org/W3097714889,"The proton-activated chloride channel (PAC) is active across a wide range of mammalian cells and is involved in acid-induced cell death and tissue injury1-3. PAC has recently been shown to represent a novel and evolutionarily conserved protein family4,5. Here we present two cryo-electron microscopy structures of human PAC in a high-pH resting closed state and a low-pH proton-bound non-conducting state. PAC is a trimer in which each subunit consists of a transmembrane domain (TMD), which is formed of two helices (TM1 and TM2), and an extracellular domain (ECD). Upon a decrease of pH from 8 to 4, we observed marked conformational changes in the ECD-TMD interface and the TMD. The rearrangement of the ECD-TMD interface is characterized by the movement of the histidine 98 residue, which is, after acidification, decoupled from the resting position and inserted into an acidic pocket that is about 5 Å away. Within the TMD, TM1 undergoes a rotational movement, switching its interaction partner from its cognate TM2 to the adjacent TM2. The anion selectivity of PAC is determined by the positively charged lysine 319 residue on TM2, and replacing lysine 319 with a glutamate residue converts PAC to a cation-selective channel. Our data provide a glimpse of the molecular assembly of PAC, and a basis for understanding the mechanism of proton-dependent activation."

https://openalex.org/W3095124650,"SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) complex, composed of synaptobrevin, syntaxin, and SNAP25, forms the essential fusion machinery for neurotransmitter release. Recent studies have reported several mutations in the gene encoding SNAP25 as a causative factor for developmental and epileptic encephalopathies of infancy and childhood with diverse clinical manifestations. However, it remains unclear how SNAP25 mutations give rise to these disorders. Here, we show that although structurally clustered mutations in SNAP25 give rise to related synaptic transmission phenotypes, specific alterations in spontaneous neurotransmitter release are a key factor to account for disease heterogeneity. Importantly, we identified a single mutation that augments spontaneous release without altering evoked release, suggesting that aberrant spontaneous release is sufficient to cause disease in humans."
https://openalex.org/W3096924207,"Social distancing resulting from the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) has disrupted the airplane boarding process. Social distancing norms reduce airplane capacity by keeping the middle seats unoccupied, while an imposed aisle social distance between boarding passengers slows the boarding. Recent literature suggests the Reverse Pyramid boarding method is a promising way to reduce health risk and keep boarding times low when 10 apron buses (essentially 10 boarding groups) are used to transport passengers from the airport terminal to a two-door airplane. We adapt the Reverse Pyramid method for social distancing when an airplane is boarded using a jet bridge that connects the terminal the airplane’s front door. We vary the number of boarding groups from two to six and use stochastic simulation and agent-based modelling to show the resulting impact on four performance evaluation metrics. Increasing the number of boarding groups from two to six reduces boarding time only up to four groups but continues to reduce infection risk up to six groups. If the passengers carry fewer luggage aboard the airplane, health risks (as well as boarding times) decrease. One adaptation of the Reverse Pyramid (RP) method (RP-Spread) provides slightly faster boarding times than the other (RP-Steep), when luggage volumes are high, while RP-Steep results in less risk to window seat passengers from later-boarding passengers walking by their row. Increasing the minimum aisle social distance from 1 m to 2 m increases boarding times but results in lower health risks to passengers walking down the aisle and to the previously seated passengers they pass."
https://openalex.org/W3096121718,"Background An increasing body of evidence is indicating that the gut microbiota modulates pulmonary inflammatory responses. This so-called gut–lung axis might be of importance in a whole spectrum of inflammatory pulmonary diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pneumonia. Here, we investigate the effect of antibiotic disruption of gut microbiota on immune responses in the lung after a intranasal challenge with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Methods/results C57Bl/6 mice were treated for two weeks with broad-spectrum antibiotics supplemented to their drinking water. Afterwards, mice and untreated control mice were inoculated intranasally with LPS. Mice were sacrificed 2 and 6 hours post-challenge, after which bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissues were taken. Gut microbiota analysis showed that antibiotic-treated mice had a pronounced reduction in numbers and diversity of bacteria. A modest, but time consistent, significant increase of interleukin (IL)-6 release was seen in BALF of antibiotic treated mice. Release of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), however, was not statistically different between groups. Conclusion Antibiotic induced microbiota disruption is associated with alterations in host responses during LPS-induced lung inflammation. Further studies are required to determine the clinical relevance of the gut-lung axis in pulmonary infection and inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W3094816479,"Paxillin (PXN), a key component of the focal adhesion complex, has been associated with cancer progression, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to elucidate mechanisms by which PXN affects cancer growth and progression, which we addressed using cancer patient data, cell lines, and orthotopic mouse models. We demonstrated a previously unrecognized mechanism whereby nuclear PXN enhances angiogenesis by transcriptionally regulating SRC expression. SRC, in turn, increases PLAT expression through NF-ĸB activation; PLAT promotes angiogenesis via LRP1 in endothelial cells. PXN silencing in ovarian cancer mouse models reduced angiogenesis, tumor growth, and metastasis. These findings provide a new understanding of the role of PXN in regulating tumor angiogenesis and growth."
https://openalex.org/W3096280661,"Zika virus (ZikV) is a flavivirus that infects neural tissues, causing congenital microcephaly. ZikV has evolved multiple mechanisms to restrict proliferation and enhance cell death, although the underlying cellular events involved remain unclear. Here we show that the ZikV-NS5 protein interacts with host proteins at the base of the primary cilia in neural progenitor cells, causing an atypical non-genetic ciliopathy and premature neuron delamination. Furthermore, in human microcephalic fetal brain tissue, ZikV-NS5 persists at the base of the motile cilia in ependymal cells, which also exhibit a severe ciliopathy. Although the enzymatic activity of ZikV-NS5 appears to be dispensable, the amino acids Y25, K28, and K29 that are involved in NS5 oligomerization are essential for localization and interaction with components of the cilium base, promoting ciliopathy and premature neurogenesis. These findings lay the foundation for therapies that target ZikV-NS5 multimerization and prevent the developmental malformations associated with congenital Zika syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W3095264630,"A cluster of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) underwent repeated positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA tests after they were discharged from the hospital. We referred to them as re-positive (RP) patients in this study. We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of these patients in a retrospective cohort study. After being treated for COVID-19, the patients underwent 14 days of quarantine following their discharge from the Huangshi Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine and the Huangshi Hospital of Youse. Two additional sequential SARS-CoV-2 RNA tests were performed at the end of quarantine. The median age of the 368 patients was 51 years, and 184 (50%) patients were female. A total of 23 RP patients were observed at follow-up. Using multivariate Cox regression analysis, risk factors associated with RP included a higher ratio of lymphocyte/white blood cell on admission (adjusted HR 7.038; 95% CI, 1.911–25.932; P = 0.0034), lower peak temperature during hospitalization (adjusted HR, 0.203; 95% CI, 0.093–0.443; P<0.0001), and the presence of comorbidities, particularly hypertension or chronic diseases in the respiratory system (adjusted HR, 3.883; 95% CI, 1.468–10.273; P = 0.0063). Antivirus treatment with arbidol was associated with a lower likelihood of re-positive outcomes (adjusted HR, 0.178; 95% CI, 0.045–0.709; P = 0.0144)."
https://openalex.org/W3094745666,"Background HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) testing was included in the 2017 South African national HIV household survey. We describe the prevalence of HIVDR by drug class, age, sex and antiretroviral drugs (ARV) status. Methods Dried blood were spots tested for HIV, with Viral load (VL), exposure to ARVs and HIVDR testing among those HIV positive. HIVDR testing was conducted on samples with VL ≥1000 copies/ml using Next Generation Sequencing. Weighted percentages of HIVDR are reported. Results 697/1,105 (63%) of HIV positive samples were sequenced. HIVDR was detected in samples from 200 respondents (27.4% (95% confidence interval (CI) 22.8–32.6)). Among these 130 (18.9% (95% CI 14.8–23.8)), had resistance to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) only, 63 (7.8% (95% CI 5.6–10.9)) resistance to NNRTIs and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and 3 (0.5% (95% CI 0.1–2.1)) resistance to protease inhibitors. Sixty-five (55.7% (95% CI 42.6–67.9) of ARV-positive samples had HIVDR compared to 112 (22.8% (95% CI 17.7–28.7)), in ARV-negative samples. HIVDR was found in 75.6% (95% CI 59.2–87.3), n = 27, samples from respondents who reported ARV use but tested ARV-negative, and in 15.3% (95% CI 6.3–32.8), n = 7, respondents who reported no ARV use and tested ARV-negative. There were no significant age and sex differences in HIVDR. Conclusion 27% of virally unsuppressed respondents had HIVDR, increasing to 75% among those who had discontinued ARV. Our findings support strengthening first-line ARV regimens by including drugs with a higher resistance barrier and treatment adherence strategies, and close monitoring of HIVDR."
https://openalex.org/W3094809009,"Context Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the leading cause of incident blindness among working-age adults in the United States. Federally designated safety-net clinics (FDSC) often serve as point-of-contact for patients least likely to receive recommended DR screenings, creating opportunity for targeted interventions to increase screening access and compliance. Study design and methods With such a goal, we implemented and assessed the longitudinal performance of an FDSC-based telemedicine DR screening (TDRS) network of 22 clinical sites providing nonmydriatic fundus photography with remote interpretation and reporting. Retrospective analysis of patient encounters between February 2014 and January 2019 was performed to assess rates of pathology and referral. A generalized estimating equation logistic regression model was used for subset analysis from audits of pre- and post-implementation screening rates. Finally, patient surveys were conducted and assessed as a measure of intervention acceptability. Results Of the 13,923 individual telescreening encounters (4327 female, 4220 male, and 5376 unspecified; mean [SD] age, 54.9 [12.5] years) studied, 10,540 were of adequate quality to identify 3532 (33.5%) patients with ocular pathology: 2319 (22.0%) patients had some level of DR with 1604 (15.2%) requiring specialist referral, and 808 (7.7%) patients required referral for other ocular pathologies. The mean screening rate for audited clinics in the year prior to program implementation was 29.9% (641/2147), which increased to 47.7% (1012/2124) in the program’s first year, doubling patients’ odds of being screened (OR 2.2; 95% CI: 1.3–3.7; P = .003). These gains were sustained over four years following implementation (OR 1.9; 95% CI: 1.1–3.1; P = .018) despite varied clinic screening performance (4-year averaged range, 22.9–55.1%). Odds of early detection likewise doubled for patients with consecutive screenings (OR 2.2, 95% CI: 2.0–2.4; P < .001). Finally, surveyed patients preferred TDRS to specialist exams (82.5%; 776/941) and would recommend the service to friends (92.7%; 868/936). Conclusion and relevance A statewide, FDSC-centered TDRS network was successfully established and sustained in a medically underserved region of the United States. Our results suggest that large TDRS networks in FDSCs can increase screening access and compliance for otherwise unscreened populations, but outcomes can vary greatly among clinics. Further work to optimize program implementation is needed to maximize this model’s impact."
https://openalex.org/W3097768901,"Podocyte injury in focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and minimal change disease (MCD) results from the imbalance between adaptive responses that maintain homeostasis and cellular dysfunction that can culminate in cell death. Therefore, an in situ analysis was performed to detect morphological changes related to cell death and autophagy in renal biopsies from adult patients with podocytopathies. Forty-nine renal biopsies from patients with FSGS (n = 22) and MCD (n = 27) were selected. In situ expression of Wilms Tumor 1 protein (WT1), light chain microtubule 1-associated protein (LC3) and caspase-3 protein were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The foot process effacement and morphological alterations related to podocyte cell death and autophagy were analyzed with transmission electronic microscopy. Reduction in the density of WT1-labeled podocytes was observed for FSGS and MCD cases as compared to controls. Foot process width (FPW) in control group was lower than in cases of podocytopathies. In FSGS group, FPW was significantly higher than in MCD group and correlated with proteinuria. A density of LC3-labeled podocytes and the number of autophagosomes in podocytes/ pedicels were higher in the MCD group than in the FSGS group. The number of autophagosomes correlated positively with the estimated glomerular filtration rate in cases of MCD. The density of caspase-3-labeled podocytes in FSGS and MCD was higher than control group, and a higher number of podocytes with an evidence of necrosis was detected in FSGS cases than in MCD and control cases. Podocytes from patients diagnosed with FSGS showed more morphological and functional alterations resulting from a larger number of lesions and reduced cell adaptation."
https://openalex.org/W3094654414,"Glycine max has 32 mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs), nine of them exhibiting defense functions (defense MAPKs) to the plant parasitic nematode Heterodera glycines. RNA seq analyses of transgenic G. max lines overexpressing (OE) each defense MAPK has led to the identification of 309 genes that are increased in their relative transcript abundance by all 9 defense MAPKs. Here, 71 of those genes are shown to also have measurable amounts of transcript in H. glycines-induced nurse cells (syncytia) produced in the root that are undergoing a defense response. The 71 genes have been grouped into 7 types, based on their expression profile. Among the 71 genes are 8 putatively-secreted proteins that include a galactose mutarotase-like protein, pollen Ole e 1 allergen and extensin protein, endomembrane protein 70 protein, O-glycosyl hydrolase 17 protein, glycosyl hydrolase 32 protein, FASCICLIN-like arabinogalactan protein 17 precursor, secreted peroxidase and a pathogenesis-related thaumatin protein. Functional transgenic analyses of all 8 of these candidate defense genes that employ their overexpression and RNA interference (RNAi) demonstrate they have a role in defense. Overexpression experiments that increase the relative transcript abundance of the candidate defense gene reduces the ability that the plant parasitic nematode Heterodera glycines has in completing its life cycle while, in contrast, RNAi of these genes leads to an increase in parasitism. The results provide a genomic analysis of the importance of MAPK signaling in relation to the secretion apparatus during the defense process defense in the G. max-H. glycines pathosystem and identify additional targets for future studies."
https://openalex.org/W3094746222,"Pleurotus ostreatus, one of the most widely cultivated edible mushrooms, produces high numbers of spores causing severe respiratory health problems for people, clogging of filters and spoilage of produce. A non-sporulating commercial variety (SPOPPO) has been successfully introduced into the market in 2006. This variety was generated by introgression breeding of a natural mutation into a commercial variety. Our cytological studies revealed that meiosis in the natural and derived sporeless strains was blocked in metaphase I, apparently resulting in a loss of spore formation. The gene(s) underlying this phenotype were mapped to an 80 kb region strongly linked to sporelessness and identified by transformation of wild type genes of this region into a sporeless strain. Sporulation was restored by re-introduction of the DNA sequence encoding the P. ostreatus meiotic recombination gene MSH4 homolog (poMSH4). Subsequent molecular analysis showed that poMSH4 in the sporeless P. ostreatus was interrupted by a DNA fragment containing a region encoding a CxC5/CxC6 cysteine cluster associated with Copia-type retrotransposons. The block of meiosis in metaphase I by a poMSH4 null mutant suggests that this protein plays an essential role in both Class I and II crossovers in mushrooms, similar to animals (mice), but unlike in plants. MSH4 was previously shown to be a target for breeding of sporeless varieties in P. pulmonarius, and the null mutant of the MSH4 homolog of S. commune (scMSH4) confers an extremely low level of spore formation. We propose that MSH4 homologs are likely to be a breeding target for sporeless strains both within Pleurotus sp. and in other Agaricales."

However, antibiotics are prescribed frequently for children with ARI, often in absence of evidence for bacterial infection. The objectives of this study were 1) to assess the appropriateness of antibiotic prescriptions for mild ARI in paediatric outpatients in relation to available guidelines and detected pathogens, 2) to assess antibiotic use on presentation using questionnaires and detection in urine 3) to assess the carriage rates and proportions of resistant intestinal Enterobacteriaceae before, during and after consultation. Materials and methods Patients were prospectively enrolled in Children’s Hospital 1, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam and diagnoses, prescribed therapy and outcome were recorded on first visit and on follow-up after 7 days. Respiratory bacterial and viral pathogens were detected using molecular assays. Antibiotic use before presentation was assessed using questionnaires and urine HPLC. The impact of antibiotic usage on intestinal Enterobacteriaceae was assessed with semi-quantitative culture on agar with and without antibiotics on presentation and after 7 and 28 days. Results A total of 563 patients were enrolled between February 2009 and February 2010. Antibiotics were prescribed for all except 2 of 563 patients. The majority were 2nd and 3rd generation oral cephalosporins and amoxicillin with or without clavulanic acid. Respiratory viruses were detected in respiratory specimens of 72.5% of patients. Antibiotic use was considered inappropriate in 90.1% and 67.5%, based on guidelines and detected pathogens, respectively. On presentation parents reported antibiotic use for 22% of patients, 41% of parents did not know and 37% denied antibiotic use. Among these three groups, six commonly used antibiotics were detected with HPLC in patients’ urine in 49%, 40% and 14%, respectively. Temporary selection of 3rd generation cephalosporin resistant intestinal Enterobacteriaceae during antibiotic use was observed, with co-selection of resistance to aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones. Conclusions We report overuse and overprescription of antibiotics for uncomplicated ARI with selection of resistant intestinal Enterobacteriaceae, posing a risk for community transmission and persistence in a setting of a highly granular healthcare system and unrestricted access to antibiotics through private pharmacies.

https://openalex.org/W3097524224,"The human ether-a-go-go-related voltage-gated cardiac ion channel (commonly known as hERG) conducts the rapid outward repolarizing potassium current in cardiomyocytes (IKr). Inadvertent blockade of this channel by drug-like molecules represents a key challenge in pharmaceutical R&D due to frequent overlap between the structure-activity relationships of hERG and many primary targets. Building on our previous work, together with recent cryo-EM structures of hERG, we set about to better understand the energetic and structural basis of promiscuous blocker-hERG binding in the context of Biodynamics theory. We propose a two-step blocker binding process consisting of: The initial capture step: diffusion of a single fully solvated blocker copy into a large cavity lined by the intra-cellular cyclic nucleotide binding homology domain (CNBHD). Occupation of this cavity is a necessary but insufficient condition for ion current disruption. The IKr disruption step: translocation of the captured blocker along the channel axis, such that: The head group, consisting of a quasi-rod-shaped moiety, projects into the open pore, accompanied by partial de-solvation of the binding interface. One tail moiety packs along a kink between the S6 helix and proximal C-linker helix adjacent to the intra-cellular entrance of the pore, likewise accompanied by mutual de-solvation of the binding interface (noting that the association barrier is comprised largely of the total head + tail group de-solvation cost). Blockers containing a highly planar moiety that projects into a putative constriction zone within the closed channel become trapped upon closing, as do blockers terminating prior to this region. A single captured blocker copy may conceivably associate and dissociate to/from the pore many times before exiting the CNBHD cavity. Lastly, we highlight possible flaws in the current hERG safety index (SI), and propose an alternate in vivo-relevant strategy factoring in: Benefit/risk. The predicted arrhythmogenic fractional hERG occupancy (based on action potential (AP) simulations of the undiseased human ventricular cardiomyocyte). Alteration of the safety threshold due to underlying disease. Risk of exposure escalation toward the predicted arrhythmic limit due to patient-to-patient pharmacokinetic (PK) variability, drug-drug interactions, overdose, and use for off-label indications in which the hERG safety parameters may differ from their on-label counterparts."
https://openalex.org/W3094674408,"With increased population and urban development, there are growing concerns regarding health impacts of environmental noise. We assessed the relationship between nighttime environmental noise and semen quality of men who visited for fertility evaluation. This is a retrospective cohort study of 1,972 male patient who had undertaken semen analysis between 2016–2018 at a single fertility center of Seoul, South Korea. We used environmental noise data of National Noise Information System (NNIS), Korea. Using semiannual nighttime noise measurement closest to the time of semen sampling, individual noise exposures at each patient’s geocoded address were estimated with empirical Bayesian kriging method. We explored the association between environmental noise and semen quality indicators (volume, concentration, % of progressive motility, vitality, normal morphology, total motile sperm count, oligozoospermia, asthenozoospermia, and severe teratozoospermia) using multivariable regression and generalized additive models. Estimated exposure to nighttime environmental noise level in the study population was 58.3±2.2 Leq. Prevalence of oligozoospermia, asthenozoospermia, and severe teratozoospermia were 3.3%, 14.0%, and 10.1%. Highest quartile nighttime noise was associated with 3.5 times higher odds of oligozoospermia (95% CI: 1.18, 10.17) compared to lowest quartile. In men whose noise exposure is in 3rd quartile, odds ratio (OR) of severe teratozoospermia was 0.57 (95% CI: 0.33, 0.98). The OR for 4th quartile noise were toward null. In generalized additive model, the risk of oligozoospermia increases when the nighttime noise is 55 Leq dB or higher. Our study adds an evidence of potential impact of environmental noise on semen quality in men living in Seoul. Additional studies with more refined noise measurement will confirm the finding."
https://openalex.org/W3094743644,"Background/Aim The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had become a big threat worldwide. Liver injury is not uncommon in patients with COVID-19, and clarifying its characteristics is needed. This study aimed to identify factors associated with liver injury and to develop a new classification of predictive severity in patients with COVID-19. Methods Confirmed patients with COVID-19 (n = 60) were recruited retrospectively from Musashino Red Cross Hospital. The factors of liver injury especially on the elevation of liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase [AST] and alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) were analyzed. Grading was assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0. Results During a median hospitalization follow-up of 15 (4–41) days, 51 (85.0%) patients had COVID-19 pneumonia. In clinical courses, oxygenation was needed for 25 (41.6%) patients and intubation was needed for 9 (15.0%) patients. A total of 27 (45.0%) patients had gastrointestinal symptoms (GS), such as appetite loss, diarrhea, and nausea. A logistic regression analysis revealed that C-reactive protein (CRP) at baseline, oxygenation, intubation, and GS were significant factors of liver injury. Based on these results, patients were classified into three groups: group 1, no oxygenation pneumonia; group 2, pneumonia with oxygenation or GS; and group 3, intubation. We classified 25 (41.7%), 26 (43.3%), and 9 (15.0%) patients into mild, moderate, and severe groups, respectively. The peak of AST and ALT levels was significantly stratified with this criteria (mild [median AST, 28 IU/L; median ALT, 33 IU/L], moderate [median AST, 48 IU/L; median ALT, 47.5 IU/L], and severe [median AST, 109 IU/L; median ALT, 106 IU/L]; P<0.001 and P = 0.0114, respectively). Conclusion COVID-19-related liver injury was significantly stratified based on GS and severity of pneumonia."
https://openalex.org/W3095066252,"Background The recent introduction of direct acting antivirals for the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) has dramatically improved treatment options for HCV infected patients. However, in the United States (US) treatment uptake has been low and time to initiation of therapy has been long. We sought to examine provider perspectives of facilitators and barriers to HCV treatment delivery. Methods From June to August 2019, we conducted in-depth, semi-structured interviews with medical staff providing HCV care as part of a university medical center in Los Angeles, CA. In order to understand the HCV treatment process, we interviewed key staff members providing care to the majority of HCV patients seeking care at the university medical center, including hepatologists and infectious disease specialists as well as key nursing and pharmacy staff. The interviews focused on workload and activities required for HCV treatment initiation for non-cirrhotic, treatment naïve patients. Results Providers noted that successful HCV treatment delivery was reliant on a care model involving close collaboration between a team of providers, in particular requiring a highly coordinated effort between dedicated nursing and pharmacy staff. The HCV care team overwhelmingly reported that the process of insurance authorization was the greatest obstacle delaying treatment initiation and noted that very few patient level factors served as a barrier to treatment uptake. Conclusions In the US, prior authorization for HCV treatment is a requirement for most public and private insurance plans. In an era with access to therapies that allow for a cure—and until revocation of prior authorization for HCV treatment is a reality—implementing strategies that can expedite authorization to accelerate treatment access are critical. Not only will this benefit patients, but it has the potential to help expand treatment to settings that are otherwise too resource strained to successfully deliver HCV care."
https://openalex.org/W3097347601,"Ecoepidemiological scenarios for Chagas disease transmission are complex, so vector control measures to decrease human-vector contact and prevent infection transmission are difficult to implement in all geographic contexts. This study assessed the geographic abundance patterns of two vector species of Chagas disease: Triatoma maculata (Erichson, 1848) and Rhodnius pallescens (Barber, 1932) in Latin America. We modeled their potential distribution using the maximum entropy algorithm implemented in Maxent and calculated distances to their niche centroid by fitting a minimum-volume ellipsoid. In addition, to determine which method would accurately explain geographic abundance patterns, we compared the correlation between population abundance and the distance to the ecological niche centroid (DNC) and between population abundance and Maxent environmental suitability. The potential distribution estimated for T. maculata showed that environmental suitability covers a large area, from Panama to Northern Brazil. R. pallescens showed a more restricted potential distribution, with environmental suitability covering mostly the coastal zone of Costa Rica and some areas in Nicaragua, Honduras, Belize and the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico, northern Colombia, Acre, and Rondonia states in Brazil, as well as a small region of the western Brazilian Amazon. We found a negative slope in the relationship between population abundance and the DNC in both species. R. pallecens has a more extensive potential latitudinal range than previously reported, and the distribution model for T. maculata corroborates previous studies. In addition, population abundance increases according to the niche centroid proximity, indicating that population abundance is limited by the set of scenopoetic variables at coarser scales (non-interactive variables) used to determine the ecological niche. These findings might be used by public health agencies in Latin America to implement actions and support programs for disease prevention and vector control, identifying areas in which to expand entomological surveillance and maintain chemical control, in order to decrease human-vector contact."
https://openalex.org/W3096636209,"This study aimed to examine clinical results in low-vault eyes after implementation of a Hole implantable collamer lens (KS-AquaPORT™, STAAR Surgical Company) in terms of visual outcomes and complications over a one-year follow-up period. This was a retrospective cohort study of subjects who underwent Hole implantable collamer lens surgery at Sanno Hospital, exhibited low vault, and were followed up for 1 year. Patients were included if they met the following criteria: 20≤ age ≤55 years; stable refraction ≥6 months; -1.0 to -20.0 diopters of myopia; endothelial cell density ≥1800 cells/mm2; and no history of ocular surgery, progressive corneal degeneration, cataract, glaucoma, or uveitis. Main outcome measurements were the safety and efficacy indices, predictability, and vault. Values were indicated as the mean ± standard deviation. Subjects included 16 patients (age: 38 ± 8 years; 6 males; 25 eyes). Toric lenses were utilized for 10 eyes. Implantable collamer lens size was 12.1, 12.6, and 13.2 mm for 18, 6, and 1 eye(s), respectively. One year postoperatively, the safety index was 1.07; for 22 eyes with a target refraction of that of emmetropic eyes, the efficacy index was 0.90; and 96% of eyes were within ± 0.50 diopters of attempted versus achieved spherical equivalent correction. Postoperative vault was 142 ± 60 μm. One year postoperatively, no additional surgery was required for rotation of toric implantable collamer lens, and no advanced cataracts, increased intraocular pressure, or decreased endothelial cells were observed. In conclusion, Hole implantable collamer lens yielded satisfactory visual outcomes and no postoperative complications for low-vault eyes, suggesting its suitability for such cases."
https://openalex.org/W3097673410,"Background Severe aortic stenosis (AS) is increasing in the aging society and is a serious condition for anesthetic management. However, approximately one-third of patients with severe AS are asymptomatic. Echocardiography is the most reliable method to detect AS, but it takes time and is costly. Methods Data were obtained retrospectively from patients who underwent surgery and preoperative transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). LVH on ECG was determined by voltage criteria (Sv1 + Rv5 or 6 ≥3.5 mV) and/or the strain pattern in V5 and V6. Severe AS was defined as a mean transaortic pressure gradient ≥40 mmHg or aortic valve area ≤1.0 cm2 by TTE. Results Data for 470 patients aged 28–94 years old were obtained. One hundred and twenty-six patients had severe AS. LVH on ECG by voltage criteria alone was detected in 182 patients, LVH by strain pattern alone was detected in 80 patients and LVH by both was detected in 55 patients. Multivariable logistic analysis revealed that LVH by the strain pattern or voltage criteria, diabetes mellitus, and age were significantly associated with severe AS. The AUC for the ROC curve for LVH by voltage criteria alone was 0.675 and the cut-off value was 3.84 mm V, and the AUC for the ROC for age was 0.675 and the cut-off value was 74 years old. Conclusion Our study suggests that patients who are 74 years old or over with LVH on ECG, especially those with DM, should undergo preoperative TTE in order to detect severe AS."
https://openalex.org/W3097655482,"Fast and accurate identification of biting midges is crucial in the study of Culicoides-borne diseases. In this work, we propose a two-stage method for automatically analyzing Culicoides (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) species. First, an image preprocessing task composed of median and Wiener filters followed by equalization and morphological operations is used to improve the quality of the wing image in order to allow an adequate segmentation of particles of interest. Then, the segmentation of the zones of interest inside the biting midge wing is made using the watershed transform. The proposed method is able to produce optimal feature vectors that help to identify Culicoides species. A database containing wing images of C. obsoletus, C. pusillus, C. foxi, and C. insignis species was used to test its performance. Feature relevance analysis indicated that the mean of hydraulic radius and eccentricity were relevant for the decision boundary between C. obsoletus and C. pusillus species. In contrast, the number of particles and the mean of the hydraulic radius was relevant for deciding between C. foxi and C. insignis species. Meanwhile, for distinguishing among the four species, the number of particles and zones, and the mean of circularity were the most relevant features. The linear discriminant analysis classifier was the best model for the three experimental classification scenarios previously described, achieving averaged areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.98, 0.90, and 0.96, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W3095576506,"We examined the relationship between cognitive-linguistic mechanisms and auditory closure ability in children. Sixty-seven school-age children recognized isolated words and keywords in sentences that were interrupted at a rate of 2.5 Hz and 5 Hz. In essence, children were given only 50% of speech information and asked to repeat the complete word or sentence. Children’s working memory capacity (WMC), attention, lexical knowledge, and retrieval from long-term memory (LTM) abilities were also measured to model their role in auditory closure ability. Overall, recognition of monosyllabic words and lexically easy multisyllabic words was significantly better at 2.5 Hz interruption rate than 5 Hz. Recognition of lexically hard multisyllabic words and keywords in sentences was better at 5 Hz relative to 2.5 Hz. Based on the best fit generalized “logistic” linear mixed effects models, there was a significant interaction between WMC and lexical difficulty of words. WMC was positively related only to recognition of lexically easy words. Lexical knowledge was found to be crucial for recognition of words and sentences, regardless of interruption rate. In addition, LTM retrieval ability was significantly associated with sentence recognition. These results suggest that lexical knowledge and the ability to retrieve information from LTM is crucial for children’s speech recognition in adverse listening situations. Study findings make a compelling case for the assessment and intervention of lexical knowledge and retrieval abilities in children with listening difficulties."
https://openalex.org/W3097808394,"When developing new products to be used in honeybee colonies, further than acute toxicity, it is imperative to perform an assessment of risks, including various sublethal effects. The long-term sublethal effects of xenobiotics on honeybees, more specifically of acaricides used in honeybee hives, have been scarcely studied, particularly so in the case of essential oils and their components. In this work, chronic effects of the ingestion of Eupatorium buniifolium (Asteraceae) essential oil were studied on nurse honeybees using laboratory assays. Survival, food consumption, and the effect on the composition of cuticular hydrocarbons (CHC) were assessed. CHC were chosen due to their key role as pheromones involved in honeybee social recognition. While food consumption and survival were not affected by the consumption of the essential oil, CHC amounts and profiles showed dose-dependent changes. All groups of CHC (linear and branched alkanes, alkenes and alkadienes) were altered when honeybees were fed with the highest essential oil dose tested (6000 ppm). The compounds that significantly varied include n-docosane, n-tricosane, n-tetracosane, n-triacontane, n-tritriacontane, 9-tricosene, 7-pentacosene, 9-pentacosene, 9-heptacosene, tritriacontene, pentacosadiene, hentriacontadiene, tritriacontadiene and all methyl alkanes. All of them but pentacosadiene were up-regulated. On the other hand, CHC profiles were similar in healthy and Nosema-infected honeybees when diets included the essential oil at 300 and 3000 ppm. Our results show that the ingestion of an essential oil can impact CHC and that the effect is dose-dependent. Changes in CHC could affect the signaling process mediated by these pheromonal compounds. To our knowledge this is the first report of changes in honeybee cuticular hydrocarbons as a result of essential oil ingestion."
https://openalex.org/W3096497604,"Fermentation of rice grains requires diverse metabolic enzymes to be synchronously synthesized by the microbial community. Although many studies have used a metaproteomic approach to investigate the roles of microorganisms in improving the flavor of fermented foods, their roles in producing compounds with biological activity have not yet been reported. In a previous study the ferment obtained from unpolished black rice (UBR) fermented with a defined microbial starter (De-E11), comprised of Rhizopus oryzae, Saccharomycopsis fibuligera, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Pediococcus pentosaceus, (fermented UBR; FUBR) showed a strong melanogenesis inhibition activity in B16F10 melanoma cells. Hence, in this study, the roles of these microorganisms in producing the melanogenesis inhibitor(s) in FUBR was investigated using a metaproteomic approach. The melanogenesis inhibition activity of the FUBR liquid (FR-Liq) was found to increase with longer fermentation times. R. oryzae and S. cerevisiae were the major hosts of proteins related to the biosynthesis of melanogenesis inhibitor(s) in the FUBR. During fermentation, the enzymes involved in the degradation of UBR and in the carbohydrate metabolic process were identified. These enzymes were associated with the process of releasing of bioactive compound(s) from UBR and the synthesis of organic acids from the microorganisms, respectively. In addition, enzymes involved in the synthesis of some known melanogenesis inhibitor(s) and in the degradation of the melanogenesis stimulator (arsenate) were detected. Varying the combination of microorganisms in the De-E11 starter to produce the FR-Liq revealed that all four microorganisms were required to produce the most potent melanogenesis inhibition activity. Taken together with the metaproteomics results, this suggested that the microorganisms in De-E11 synchronously synthesize the FR-Liq with melanogenesis inhibition activity. In conclusion, this information on the metaproteome in FUBR will increase our understanding of the microbial metabolic modes and could lead to knowledge-based improvements in the fermented rice process to produce melanogenesis inhibitor(s)."
https://openalex.org/W3096990368,"Severe anaemia is a common clinical problem among young children in sub-Saharan Africa. However, the effect of severe anaemia on neurodevelopment of these children is not well described. Therefore, we assessed the neurodevelopmental performance of preschool children diagnosed with severe anaemia in Northern Uganda.We conducted a prospective cohort study among children < 5 years of age 14 days post discharge after an episode of severe anaemia (Hb < 5.0 g/dl; n = 171; mean Hb = 3.9g/dl) at Lira Regional Referral Hospital, Uganda. Neurodevelopmental outcomes (cognitive, language and motor) were assessed using Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, 3rd edition (Bayley-III). Age-adjusted z-scores for each domain were calculated using scores from healthy community control children (n = 88) recruited from the same environment for each age category. Multiple linear regression was used to compare z-scores in the cognitive, language and motor scales between the two groups after adjusting for weight-for-age z-score, socioeconomic status, mother's education, and father's employment on all the scales.The prevalence of neurodevelopmental impairment was 2.3% (95% CI: 0.8-6.1) for cognition, 1.7% (95%: 0.6-5.3) for language and 3.5% (95% CI: 1.6-7.6) for motor scales and 4.6% (95% CI: 2.3-9.1) for deficits in ≥1 area of neurodevelopment. Significant differences were observed between the two groups with the SA group performing worse on cognition [adjusted mean score, (Standard error, SE), P-value] [-0.20, (0.01) vs. 0.00, (0.01), P = 0.02]; language [-0.25, (0.01) vs. 0.00, (0.01), P< 0.001]; and motor [-0.17, (0.01) vs. 0.00, (0.01), P = 0.05] scales.In children < 5 years of age, severe anaemia was associated with neurocognitive (cognition, language and motor) deficits in the immediate period post treatment. Further research is needed to identify risk factors and determine the long-term effects of poor neurodevelopment in young children with severe anaemia."
https://openalex.org/W3094643187,"Stocking hatchery fish can lead to disturbance and extinction of the local indigenous population. Masu salmon Oncorhynchus masou masou, which is endemic across Japan, is a commonly stocked fish for recreational fishing in Japan. To conserve the indigenous resource, their genetic information is required, however, especially on Kyushu Island, the paucity of genetic information for this species has hindered proper resource management. Here, to identify hatchery mitogenome haplotypes of this species, stocked in the Kase River system, Kyushu Island, Japan, and to provide mitogenomic information for the resource management of this species, we analyzed the whole-mitogenome of masu salmon in this river system and several hatcheries potentially used for stocking. Whole-mitogenome sequencing clearly identified hatchery haplotypes, like fingerprints: among the 21 whole-mitogenome haplotypes obtained, six were determined to be hatchery haplotypes. These hatchery haplotypes were distributed in 13 out of 17 sites, suggesting that informal stocking of O. m. masou has been performed widely across this river system. The population of no hatchery haplotypes mainly belonged to clade I, a clade not found in Hokkaido Island in previous studies. Sites without hatchery haplotypes, and the non-hatchery haplotypes in clade I might be candidates for conservation as putative indigenous resources. The whole-mitogenome haplotype analysis also clarified that the same reared strain was used in multiple hatcheries. Analysis of molecular variance suggested that stocked hatchery haplotypes reduce the genetic variation among populations in this river system. It will be necessary to pay attention to genetic fluctuations so that the resources of this river system will not deteriorate further. The single nucleotide polymorphism data obtained here could be used for resource management in this and other rivers: e.g., for monitoring of informal stocking and stocked hatchery fishes, and/or putative indigenous resources."
https://openalex.org/W3097162959,"Objectives Aging causes stiffness and decreased function of the renal artery (RA). Histological study with light microscopy can reveal microscopic structural remodeling but no functional changes. The present study aimed to clarify the association between structural and functional aging of the RA through the use of scanning acoustic microscopy. Methods Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded cross-sections of renal arteries from 64 autopsy cases were examined. Speed-of-sound (SOS) values of three layers, which correspond to the stiffness, were compared among different age groups. SOS of the tunica media was examined in terms of blood pressure (BP) and SOS of the ascending aorta. Vulnerability to proteases was assessed by SOS reduction after collagenase treatment. Results The tunica intima presented inward hypertrophy with luminal narrowing, and the tunica media showed outward hypertrophic remodeling with aging. SOS of the tunica media and internal and external elastic laminae showed a reverse correlation with age. SOS of the tunica media was negatively correlated with BP and strongly associated with that of the aorta. The tunica media of young RAs were more sensitive to collagenase compared with the old ones. Conclusions Scanning acoustic microscopy is useful for observing the aging process of the RA. This technique simultaneously shows structural and mechanical information from each portion of the RA. In the process of aging, the RA loses contractile function and elasticity as a result of protease digestion. The tunica media and the internal and external elastic laminae exhibit reduced stiffness, but the tunica intima stiffens with atherosclerosis. As a consequence, the RA’s outer shape changes from round to oval with inward and outward hypertrophy. This indicates that the inner resistant intima supports the mechanical weakness of the tunica media to compensate for an increase in BP with aging."
https://openalex.org/W3097866997,"Assessing chemical loading from streams in remote, difficult-to-access watersheds is challenging. The Grand Canyon area in northern Arizona, an international tourist destination and sacred place for many Native Americans, is characterized by broad plateaus divided by canyons as much as two-thousand meters deep and hosts some of the highest-grade uranium deposits in the U.S. From 2015-2018 major surface waters in Grand Canyon were monitored for select elements associated with breccia-pipe uranium deposits in the area, including uranium, arsenic, cadmium, and lead. Dissolved constituents in the Colorado River were monitored upstream (Lees Ferry), in the middle (Phantom Ranch), and downstream (Diamond Creek) of uranium mining areas. Concentrations of uranium, arsenic, cadmium, and lead at these main-stem sites varied little during the study period and were all well below human health and aquatic life benchmark criteria (30, 10, 5, and 15 μg/L maximum contaminant levels and 15, 150, 0.8, and 3.1 μg/L aquatic life criteria, respectively). Additionally, dissolved and sediment-bound constituents were monitored during a wide range of streamflow conditions at Little Colorado River, Kanab Creek, and Havasu Creek tributaries, whose watersheds have experienced different levels of uranium mining activities over time. Samples from the tributary sites contained ≤3.8 μg/L of dissolved cadmium and lead, and ≤17 μg/L of dissolved uranium. Dissolved arsenic also was mostly below human and aquatic life criteria at Little Colorado River and Kanab Creek; however, 63% of water samples from Havasu Creek were above the maximum contaminant level for arsenic. Arsenic in suspended sediment was greater than sediment quality guidelines in 9%, 35%, and 35% of samples from Little Colorado River, Kanab Creek, and Havasu Creek, respectively. At the concentrations observed during this study, tributaries contributed on average only about 0.12 μg/L of arsenic and 0.03 μg/L of uranium to the main-stem river. This study demonstrates how chemical loading from mined watersheds may be reliably assessed across a wide range of flow conditions in challenging locations."
https://openalex.org/W3095407866,"Construction of a reliable stock portfolio remains an open issue in quantitative investment. Multiple machine learning models have been trained for stock portfolio selection, but their practical applicability remains limited due to the challenges posed by the characteristic of a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the nature of time-series data, and non-independent identical distribution in financial data. Here, we transformed the stock selection task into a matching problem between a group of stocks and a stock selection target. We proposed a novel representation algorithm of stock selection target and a novel deep matching algorithm (TS-Deep-LtM). Then we proposed a deep stock profiling method to extract the optimal feature combination and trained a deep matching model based on TS-Deep-LtM algorithm for stock portfolio selection. Especially, TS-Deep-LtM algorithm was obtained by setting statistical indicators to filter and integrate three deep text matching algorithms. This parallel framework design made it good at capturing signals from time-series data and adapting to non-independent identically distributed data. Finally, we applied the proposed model to stock selection and tested long-only portfolio strategies from 2010 to 2017. We demonstrated that the risk-adjusted returns obtained by our portfolio strategies outperformed those obtained by the CSI300 index and learning-to-rank approaches during the same period."
https://openalex.org/W3096540206,"Waiting times for organs in the United States are long and vary widely across regions. Donor registration can increase the number of potential donors, but its effect on the actual number of organ transplants depends upon several factors. First among these factors is that deceased donor organ donation requires both that death occur in a way making recovery possible and that authorization to recover organs is obtained. We estimate the potential donor death rate and donor authorization rate conditional on potential donor death by donor registration status for each state and for key demographic groups. With this information, we then develop a simple measure of the value of a new donor registration. This combined measure using information on donor authorization rates and potential death rates varies widely across states and groups, suggesting that focusing registration efforts on high-value groups and locations can significantly increase the overall number of donors. Targeting high-value states raises 26.7 percent more donors than a uniform, nationwide registration effort. Our estimates can also be used to assess alternative, but complementary, policies such as protocols to improve authorization rates for non-registered potential donors."

The aim of the present research was to determine the economic value of the Gohar Lake resort using the zonal travel cost method. Therefore, at first, 380 questionnaires were distributed among the tourists by the simple random sampling method based on appropriate spatiotemporal distribution during the visiting seasons. The questionnaire items were categorized as economic, social, and miscellaneous parts. The calculation results revealed a value of USD 84.538 per visitor and a value of USD 1,986,657.163 per year, indicating the high value and importance of the region. The analysis showed that socio-economic variables have a significant role in the use or non-use of the resort. The obtained R2 coefficient was 0.82, indicating that around 82% of the changes in the number of visitors can be justified by the variables introduced in the model. The results also revealed the need to pay more attention to this region and formulate a tourism development plan."

Therefore, the water quality of SBSs in the nosocomial environment plays a fundamental role in controlling infections for both patients and health-care workers. A long-term study on Legionella and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) contamination was performed in SBSs (n = 20) of six Health Care Facilities (HCFs). A total of 254 water samples were analyzed following ISO procedures. The samples were positive for P. aeruginosa (46.85%) and Legionella (53.54%), respectively, both over the directive limits. Legionella isolates were identified as: Legionella pneumophila (L. pneumophila) serogroups 1, 3, and 6 and Legionella non-pneumophila species (L. anisa, L. londiniensis, L. rubrilucens, and L. nagelii). Moreover, the contamination found was studied with respect to median temperature measured (42 °C), from which two groups (A and B) could be distinguished. P. aeruginosa was found in both groups (100% of SBSs), while a higher percentage of Legionella positive samples was found in group A (75% of SBSs), compared to group B (50% of SBSs), showing how Legionella control could be carried out by using temperatures above 42 °C. An analysis of SBS water pipelines, maintenance, and disinfection treatments indicates SBSs as a new source of infection risk for both patients and health-care workers."
https://openalex.org/W3096447644,"With sustained economic growth in many parts of the developing world, an increasing number of countries are transitioning away from the most subsidized development finance as they exceed income and other qualification requirements. Cross-country evidence suggests that Development Assistance Committee (DAC) donors view the crossing over of the World Bank's International Development Association (IDA) eligibility threshold to signal that a country needs less aid, with subsequent reductions in both IDA and other donors' concessional funding. Within the health sector, it is particularly important to understand the implications of these status changes for children under five years of age since improving early childhood health is critical to fostering health and social and economic development. Therefore, we examine the implications of the IDA transition by measuring the extent t which World Bank commitments—including both IDA and IBRD—are directed to infant and child health needs in Nigeria. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) models were used in a difference-in-differences (DID) strategy to compare World Bank IBRD/IDA lending before and after the crossover to regions with varying initial levels of under-five and infant need. We find that the infant need orientation of World Bank aid has increased post-crossover. Conversely, alignment of World Bank commitments to regional child needs appears to have diminished after Nigeria crosses the IDA threshold. However, these effects are statistically insignificant and therefore provides inconclusive evidence. This research addresses an important policy question because the transition away from concessional funding mechanisms will result in difficult tradeoffs in allocating limited health resources; without providing conclusive evidence that crossover results in changes in need-based allocation, it does offer an essential path for future research. These results are directly relevant to policy debates about what we know and do not know about aid in transition and health. This research's value is especially important in the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) era in understanding how donor exits could derail progress in health improvement."
