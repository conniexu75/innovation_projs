https://openalex.org/W2038736839,"High harmonic emission occurs when an electron, liberated from a molecule by an incident intense laser field, gains energy from the field and recombines with the parent molecular ion. The emission provides a snapshot of the structure and dynamics of the recombining system, encoded in the amplitudes, phases and polarization of the harmonic light. Here we show with CO(2) molecules that high harmonic interferometry can retrieve this structural and dynamic information: by measuring the phases and amplitudes of the harmonic emission, we reveal 'fingerprints' of multiple molecular orbitals participating in the process and decode the underlying attosecond multi-electron dynamics, including the dynamics of electron rearrangement upon ionization. These findings establish high harmonic interferometry as an effective approach to resolving multi-electron dynamics with sub-Angström spatial resolution arising from the de Broglie wavelength of the recombining electron, and attosecond temporal resolution arising from the timescale of the recombination event."

https://openalex.org/W2104431608,"Light microscopy provides a simple, cost-effective, and vital method for the diagnosis and screening of hematologic and infectious diseases. In many regions of the world, however, the required equipment is either unavailable or insufficiently portable, and operators may not possess adequate training to make full use of the images obtained. Counterintuitively, these same regions are often well served by mobile phone networks, suggesting the possibility of leveraging portable, camera-enabled mobile phones for diagnostic imaging and telemedicine. Toward this end we have built a mobile phone-mounted light microscope and demonstrated its potential for clinical use by imaging P. falciparum-infected and sickle red blood cells in brightfield and M. tuberculosis-infected sputum samples in fluorescence with LED excitation. In all cases resolution exceeded that necessary to detect blood cell and microorganism morphology, and with the tuberculosis samples we took further advantage of the digitized images to demonstrate automated bacillus counting via image analysis software. We expect such a telemedicine system for global healthcare via mobile phone – offering inexpensive brightfield and fluorescence microscopy integrated with automated image analysis – to provide an important tool for disease diagnosis and screening, particularly in the developing world and rural areas where laboratory facilities are scarce but mobile phone infrastructure is extensive."
https://openalex.org/W1998198750,"FAS (also called APO-1 and CD95) and its physiological ligand, FASL, regulate apoptosis of unwanted or dangerous cells, functioning as a guardian against autoimmunity and cancer development. Distinct cell types differ in the mechanisms by which the 'death receptor' FAS triggers their apoptosis. In type I cells, such as lymphocytes, activation of 'effector caspases' by FAS-induced activation of caspase-8 suffices for cell killing, whereas in type II cells, including hepatocytes and pancreatic beta-cells, caspase cascade amplification through caspase-8-mediated activation of the pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family member BID (BH3 interacting domain death agonist) is essential. Here we show that loss of XIAP (X-chromosome linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein) function by gene targeting or treatment with a second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (SMAC, also called DIABLO; direct IAP-binding protein with low pI) mimetic drug in mice rendered hepatocytes and beta-cells independent of BID for FAS-induced apoptosis. These results show that XIAP is the critical discriminator between type I and type II apoptosis signalling and suggest that IAP inhibitors should be used with caution in cancer patients with underlying liver conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2127901973,"African primates are naturally infected with over 40 different simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs), two of which have crossed the species barrier and generated human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 (HIV-1 and HIV-2). Unlike the human viruses, however, SIVs do not generally cause acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in their natural hosts. Here we show that SIVcpz, the immediate precursor of HIV-1, is pathogenic in free-ranging chimpanzees. By following 94 members of two habituated chimpanzee communities in Gombe National Park, Tanzania, for over 9 years, we found a 10- to 16-fold higher age-corrected death hazard for SIVcpz-infected (n = 17) compared to uninfected (n = 77) chimpanzees. We also found that SIVcpz-infected females were less likely to give birth and had a higher infant mortality rate than uninfected females. Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization of post-mortem spleen and lymph node samples from three infected and two uninfected chimpanzees revealed significant CD4(+) T-cell depletion in all infected individuals, with evidence of high viral replication and extensive follicular dendritic cell virus trapping in one of them. One female, who died within 3 years of acquiring SIVcpz, had histopathological findings consistent with end-stage AIDS. These results indicate that SIVcpz, like HIV-1, is associated with progressive CD4(+) T-cell loss, lymphatic tissue destruction and premature death. These findings challenge the prevailing view that all natural SIV infections are non-pathogenic and suggest that SIVcpz has a substantial negative impact on the health, reproduction and lifespan of chimpanzees in the wild."
https://openalex.org/W2155126563,"Fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4) plays an important role in maintaining glucose and lipid homeostasis. FABP4 has been primarily regarded as an adipocyte- and macrophage-specific protein, but recent studies suggest that it may be more widely expressed. We found strong FABP4 expression in the endothelial cells (ECs) of capillaries and small veins in several mouse and human tissues, including the heart and kidney. FABP4 was also detected in the ECs of mature human placental vessels and infantile hemangiomas, the most common tumor of infancy and ECs. In most of these cases, FABP4 was detected in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. FABP4 mRNA and protein levels were significantly induced in cultured ECs by VEGF-A and bFGF treatment. The effect of VEGF-A on FABP4 expression was inhibited by chemical inhibition or short-hairpin (sh) RNA-mediated knockdown of VEGF-receptor-2 (R2), whereas the VEGFR1 agonists, placental growth factors 1 and 2, had no effect on FABP4 expression. Knockdown of FABP4 in ECs significantly reduced proliferation both under baseline conditions and in response to VEGF and bFGF. Thus, FABP4 emerged as a novel target of the VEGF/VEGFR2 pathway and a positive regulator of cell proliferation in ECs."
https://openalex.org/W2078908256,"Coral bleaching, during which corals lose their symbiotic dinoflagellates, typically corresponds with periods of intense heat stress, and appears to be increasing in frequency and geographic extent as the climate warms. A fundamental question in coral reef ecology is whether chronic local stress reduces coral resistance and resilience from episodic stress such as bleaching, or alternatively promotes acclimatization, potentially increasing resistance and resilience. Here we show that following a major bleaching event, Montastraea faveolata coral growth rates at sites with higher local anthropogenic stressors remained suppressed for at least 8 years, while coral growth rates at sites with lower stress recovered in 2–3 years. Instead of promoting acclimatization, our data indicate that background stress reduces coral fitness and resilience to episodic events. We also suggest that reducing chronic stress through local coral reef management efforts may increase coral resilience to global climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2077589894,"Background Decline in insulin action is a metabolic feature of aging and is involved in the development of age-related diseases including Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). A novel mitochondria-associated peptide, Humanin (HN), has a neuroprotective role against AD-related neurotoxicity. Considering the association between insulin resistance and AD, we investigated if HN influences insulin sensitivity. Methods and Findings Using state of the art clamp technology, we examined the role of central and peripheral HN on insulin action. Continuous infusion of HN intra-cerebro-ventricularly significantly improved overall insulin sensitivity. The central effects of HN on insulin action were associated with activation of hypothalamic STAT-3 signaling; effects that were negated by co-inhibition of hypothalamic STAT-3. Peripheral intravenous infusions of novel and potent HN derivatives reproduced the insulin-sensitizing effects of central HN. Inhibition of hypothalamic STAT-3 completely negated the effects of IV HN analog on liver, suggesting that the hepatic actions of HN are centrally mediated. This is consistent with the lack of a direct effect of HN on primary hepatocytes. Furthermore, single treatment with a highly-potent HN analog significantly lowered blood glucose in Zucker diabetic fatty rats. Based upon the link of HN with two age-related diseases, we examined if there were age associated changes in HN levels. Indeed, the amount of detectable HN in hypothalamus, skeletal muscle, and cortex was decreased with age in rodents, and circulating levels of HN were decreased with age in humans and mice. Conclusions We conclude that the decline in HN with age could play a role in the pathogenesis of age-related diseases including AD and T2DM. HN represents a novel link between T2DM and neurodegeneration and along with its analogues offers a potential therapeutic tool to improve insulin action and treat T2DM."
https://openalex.org/W2028303382,"Some of the tryptophan catabolites produced through the kynurenine pathway (KP), and more particularly the excitotoxin quinolinic acid (QA), are likely to play a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have previously shown that the KP is over activated in AD brain and that QA accumulates in amyloid plaques and within dystrophic neurons. We hypothesized that QA in pathophysiological concentrations affects tau phosphorylation. Using immunohistochemistry, we found that QA is co-localized with hyperphosphorylated tau (HPT) within cortical neurons in AD brain. We then investigated in vitro the effects of QA at various pathophysiological concentrations on tau phosphorylation in primary cultures of human neurons. Using western blot, we found that QA treatment increased the phosphorylation of tau at serine 199/202, threonine 231 and serine 396/404 in a dose dependent manner. Increased accumulation of phosphorylated tau was also confirmed by immunocytochemistry. This increase in tau phosphorylation was paralleled by a substantial decrease in the total protein phosphatase activity. A substantial decrease in PP2A expression and modest decrease in PP1 expression were observed in neuronal cultures treated with QA. These data clearly demonstrate that QA can induce tau phosphorylation at residues present in the PHF in the AD brain. To induce tau phosphorylation, QA appears to act through NMDA receptor activation similar to other agonists, glutamate and NMDA. The QA effect was abrogated by the NMDA receptor antagonist memantine. Using PCR arrays, we found that QA significantly induces 10 genes in human neurons all known to be associated with AD pathology. Of these 10 genes, 6 belong to pathways involved in tau phosphorylation and 4 of them in neuroprotection. Altogether these results indicate a likely role of QA in the AD pathology through promotion of tau phosphorylation. Understanding the mechanism of the neurotoxic effects of QA is essential in developing novel therapeutic strategies for AD."
https://openalex.org/W2162294575,"Stresses that perturb the folding of nascent endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteins activate the ER stress response. Upon ER stress, ER-associated ATF6 is cleaved; the resulting active cytosolic fragment of ATF6 translocates to the nucleus, binds to ER stress response elements (ERSEs), and induces genes, including the ER-targeted chaperone, GRP78. Recent studies showed that nutrient and oxygen starvation during tissue ischemia induce certain ER stress response genes, including GRP78; however, the role of ATF6 in mediating this induction has not been examined. In the current study, simulating ischemia (sI) in a primary cardiac myocyte model system caused a reduction in the level of ER-associated ATF6 with a coordinate increase of ATF6 in nuclear fractions. An ERSE in the GRP78 gene not previously shown to be required for induction by other ER stresses was found to bind ATF6 and to be critical for maximal ischemia-mediated GRP78 promoter induction. Activation of ATF6 and the GRP78 promoter, as well as grp78 mRNA accumulation during sI, were reversed upon simulated reperfusion (sI/R). Moreover, dominant-negative ATF6, or ATF6-targeted miRNA blocked sI-mediated grp78 induction, and the latter increased cardiac myocyte death upon simulated reperfusion, demonstrating critical roles for endogenous ATF6 in ischemia-mediated ER stress activation and cell survival. This is the first study to show that ATF6 is activated by ischemia but inactivated upon reperfusion, suggesting that it may play a role in the induction of ER stress response genes during ischemia that could have a preconditioning effect on cell survival during reperfusion."
https://openalex.org/W2054612304,"Metastasis to a variety of distant organs, such as lung, brain, bone, and liver, is a leading cause of mortality in the breast cancer patients. The tissue tropism of breast cancer metastasis has been recognized and studied extensively, but the cellular processes underlying this phenomenon, remain elusive. Modern technologies have enabled the discovery of a number of the genetic factors determining tissue tropism of malignant cells. However, the effect of these genetic differences on the cell motility and invasiveness is poorly understood. Here, we report that cellular responses to the mechanical rigidity of the extracellular matrix correlate with the rigidity of the target tissue. We tested a series of single cell populations isolated from MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line in a variety of assays where the extracellular matrix rigidity was varied to mimic the environment that these cells might encounter in vivo. There was increased proliferation and migration through the matrices of rigidities corresponding to the native rigidities of the organs where metastasis was observed. We were able to abolish the differential matrix rigidity response by knocking down Fyn kinase, which was previously identified as a critical component of the FN rigidity response pathway in healthy cells. This result suggests possible molecular mechanisms of the rigidity response in the malignant cells, indicating potential candidates for therapeutic interventions."

https://openalex.org/W1970312160,"Malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum is responsible for nearly 1 million deaths annually. Although much progress has been made in the recent past, the development of a safe, effective and affordable malaria vaccine has remained a challenge. A vaccine targeting sexual stages of the parasite will not only reduce malaria transmission by female Anopheles mosquitoes, but also reduce the spread of parasites able to evade immunity elicited by vaccines targeting pre-erythrocytic and erythrocytic asexual stages. We focused our studies on Pfs48/45, a protein expressed in the sexual stages developing within an infected person and one of the most promising transmission-blocking vaccine targets. Functional immunogenicity of Pfs48/45 protein requires proper disulfide bond formation, consequently evaluation of the immunogenicity of recombinant full-length Pfs48/45 has been hampered by difficulties in expressing properly folded protein to date. Here we present a strategy involving harmonization of codons for successful recombinant expression of full length Pfs48/45 in Escherichia coli. The purified protein, designated CH-rPfs48/45, was recognized by monoclonal antibodies directed against reduction-sensitive conformational epitopes in the native protein. Immunogenicity evaluation in mice revealed potent transmission blocking activity in membrane feeding assays of antisera elicited by CH-rPfs48/45 formulated in three different adjuvants, i.e. Alum, Montanide ISA-51 and complete Freund's adjuvant. More importantly, CH-rPfs48/45 formulated with Montanide ISA-51 when administered to nonhuman primates (Olive baboons, Papio anubis) resulted in uniformly high antibody responses (ELISA titers >2 million) in all five animals. Sera from these animals displayed greater than 93% blocking activity in membrane feeding assays after a single immunization, reaching nearly complete blocking after a booster dose of the vaccine. The relative ease of expression and induction of potent transmission blocking antibodies in mice and nonhuman primates provide a compelling rationale and basis for development of a CH-rPfs48/45 based malaria transmission blocking vaccine."
https://openalex.org/W1974961023,"A quantitative linear model accurately (R2 = 0.88) describes the thermostabilities of 54 characterized members of a family of fungal cellobiohydrolase class II (CBH II) cellulase chimeras made by SCHEMA recombination of three fungal enzymes, demonstrating that the contributions of SCHEMA sequence blocks to stability are predominantly additive. Thirty-one of 31 predicted thermostable CBH II chimeras have thermal inactivation temperatures higher than the most thermostable parent CBH II, from Humicola insolens, and the model predicts that hundreds more CBH II chimeras share this superior thermostability. Eight of eight thermostable chimeras assayed hydrolyze the solid cellulosic substrate Avicel at temperatures at least 5 °C above the most stable parent, and seven of these showed superior activity in 16-h Avicel hydrolysis assays. The sequence-stability model identified a single block of sequence that adds 8.5 °C to chimera thermostability. Mutating individual residues in this block identified the C313S substitution as responsible for the entire thermostabilizing effect. Introducing this mutation into the two recombination parent CBH IIs not featuring it (Hypocrea jecorina and H. insolens) decreased inactivation, increased maximum Avicel hydrolysis temperature, and improved long time hydrolysis performance. This mutation also stabilized and improved Avicel hydrolysis by Phanerochaete chrysosporium CBH II, which is only 55–56% identical to recombination parent CBH IIs. Furthermore, the C313S mutation increased total H. jecorina CBH II activity secreted by the Saccharomyces cerevisiae expression host more than 10-fold. Our results show that SCHEMA structure-guided recombination enables quantitative prediction of cellulase chimera thermostability and efficient identification of stabilizing mutations.

SCHEMA is a computational approach to identifying blocks of sequence that minimize structural disruption when they are recombined in chimeric proteins (1Otey C.R. Landwehr M. Endelman J.B. Hiraga K. Bloom J.D. Arnold F.H. PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e112Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar).

Our prior analysis showed that a qualitative model based on sequence-stability data from 23 functional chimeras (categorizing blocks as destabilizing, stabilizing, or neutral) could identify highly stable chimeras in the SCHEMA library (2Heinzelman P. Snow C.D. Wu I. Nguyen C. Villalobos A. Govindarajan S. Minshull J. Arnold F.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 5610-5615Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). When studying SCHEMA recombination of a bacterial cytochrome P450, we previously estimated that building a quantitative regression model would require stability measurements for at least 35 representative sequences (3Li Y. Drummond D.A. Sawayama A.M. Snow C.D. Bloom J.D. Arnold F.H. Nat Biotechnol. 2007; 25: 1051-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). We therefore synthesized an additional 18 CBH II chimeras to further explore the sequences that the qualitative model predicted would encode the most thermostable chimeras. If sequence blocks contribute additively and independently of their context, as was found for SCHEMA chimeras of cytochrome P450 (3Li Y. Drummond D.A. Sawayama A.M. Snow C.D. Bloom J.D. Arnold F.H. Nat Biotechnol. 2007; 25: 1051-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), then quantitative stability prediction would be possible based on stability data from a very limited sampling of the thousands of possible chimeras. Here we show that a quantitative CBH II chimera stability model can in fact be constructed and also that it was possible, using site-directed mutagenesis experiments, to pinpoint a single amino acid substitution that is responsible for the large stabilizing contribution of one of the SCHEMA blocks. Highly thermostable fungal CBH IIs are potentially useful for the degradation of cellulosic substrates in biofuels, textile, and other applications (4Voutilainen S.P. Puranen T. Siika-Aho M. Lappalainen A. Alapuranen M. Kallio J. Hooman S. Viikari L. Vehmaanperä J. Koivula A. Biotechnol Bioeng. 2008; 101: 515-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). High thermostability translates to longer half-lives at elevated hydrolysis temperatures, where viscosity and microbial contamination are reduced (5Turner P. Mamo G. Karlsson E.N. Microb. Cell Fact. 2007; 6: 9Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated how selected thermostable CBH II chimeras perform in the hydrolysis of crystalline cellulose (Avicel) at elevated temperatures (up to 70 °C). All of the thermostable chimeras tested have specific activities on phosphoric acid swollen cellulose (PASC) at 50 °C that are comparable with the most active parent (H. jecorina CBH II) and hydrolyze Avicel at temperatures higher than any of the three parent enzymes, including the CBH II from the thermophilic fungus H. insolens. Parent and chimeric genes encoding CBH II enzymes were cloned into yeast expression vector YEp352/PGK91-1-αss, and expression in synthetic dextrose casamino acids (SDCAA) medium was carried out as described previously (2Heinzelman P. Snow C.D. Wu I. Nguyen C. Villalobos A. Govindarajan S. Minshull J. Arnold F.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 5610-5615Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). For Avicel activity assays, yeast peptone dextrose (YPD) culture supernatants were brought to 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 0.02% NaN3 and used without concentration. CBH II enzyme activity was measured by adding dilutions of concentrated culture supernatant to 37.5 μl of PASC and 225 μl of 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.8, and incubating for 2 h at 50 °C. Reducing sugar equivalents formed were determined via Nelson-Somogyi assay, as described (2Heinzelman P. Snow C.D. Wu I. Nguyen C. Villalobos A. Govindarajan S. Minshull J. Arnold F.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 5610-5615Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). CBH II enzyme T50 values were measured by adding concentrated CBH II SDCAA expression culture supernatant to 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.8, at a concentration giving A520 of 0.5 as measured in the Nelson-Somogyi reducing sugar assay after incubation with endoglucanase-treated PASC (2Heinzelman P. Snow C.D. Wu I. Nguyen C. Villalobos A. Govindarajan S. Minshull J. Arnold F.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 5610-5615Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). 200 μl of CBH II enzyme/buffer mixtures were incubated in a water bath at the temperature of interest for 10 min. After incubation, 37.5 μl of endoglucanase-treated PASC and 62.5 μl of 50 mm sodium acetate were added, and hydrolysis was carried out for 2 h at 50 °C. The incubation temperature at which the enzyme lost one-half of its activity was determined by linear interpolation of the Nelson-Somogyi assay A520 values plotted versus temperature. For 16-h Avicel PH101 (Fluka) hydrolysis measurements, 0.3 μg of purified CBH II was incubated with 3 mg of Avicel in 270 μl of 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.8, in PCR tubes placed in a water bath for 16 h. Tubes were cooled in a room temperature water bath for 10 min and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min, and supernatants were withdrawn for reducing sugar analysis. For estimation of CBH II activity in YPD expression culture supernatants, supernatant volumes ranging from 2 to 40 ml were added to 800 μl of 33 mg/ml Avicel suspended in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.8, in conical tubes. CBH IIs were allowed to bind Avicel at 4 °C for 1 h, centrifuged at 2000 × g for 2 min, and washed twice with 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.8. After the second wash, CBH II-bound Avicel was resuspended in 2.75 ml of sodium acetate buffer, split into 270-μl aliquots, and incubated at 50 °C for 2.5 h. Centrifugation and supernatant reducing sugar analysis were carried out as above. The LinearRegression package in Mathematica was used to fit CBH II chimera T50 data to a 17-parameter, block additive model and was also used for cross-validation analysis. Block effects are reported relative to a parent 1 (H. insolens CBH II) reference state with 16 parameters representing substitution of each of the eight blocks from parents 2 and 3. Values of T50, defined here as the temperature at which an enzyme loses 50% of its activity during a 10-min incubation, were determined for the three parent cellobiohydrolases, 33 active CBH II chimeras from our prior work and 18 additional chimeras that qualitative stability modeling predicted to be among the most thermostable, i.e. containing none of the seven predicted destabilizing blocks and either three or four of the four predicted stabilizing blocks (2Heinzelman P. Snow C.D. Wu I. Nguyen C. Villalobos A. Govindarajan S. Minshull J. Arnold F.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 5610-5615Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). All 51 chimera sequences are listed in supplemental Table 1. Reculturing and reconcentrating all of the predicted thermostable chimeras previously classified as not secreted (2Heinzelman P. Snow C.D. Wu I. Nguyen C. Villalobos A. Govindarajan S. Minshull J. Arnold F.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 5610-5615Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) allowed us to obtain sufficient amounts of 12112132, 13111132, and 13322332 CBH IIs for T50 determination. Because T50 measurements require more enzyme in each assay than the half-life (t½) measurements made in our prior work, we were unable to obtain T50 values for three poorly expressed, relatively unstable chimeras (21223122, 23231222, and 33123313) from the initial t½ data set. The complete set of T50 values for the chimeras and parent CBH IIs is provided in supplemental Table 1. The amino acid sequences for all these CBH IIs appear in supplemental Table 2. All 31 predicted thermostable chimeras tested in this and previous work have T50 values more than two degrees higher than that of the most thermostable parent enzyme (64.8 °C). Applying linear regression to the sequence-stability data resulted in a 10-parameter model that fit the observed T50 values with R2 = 0.88 (Fig. 1). To better estimate the predictive capacity of the regression model outside the training set, we performed 11-fold cross-validation resulting in a R2 of 0.57, where removal of two outliers (11313121 and 22222222) increases the cross-validation R2 to 0.76. The regression model uses the most stable parent 1 (H. insolens) as the reference state T50 and includes nine additional terms having p values ≤0.1. The model parameters (supplemental Table 3) show that a single block, block 7 from parent 3 (B7P3), is by far the strongest contributor to chimera thermostability relative to H. insolens CBH II. This block from C. thermophilum CBH II contributes ∼8.5 °C to the stability of chimeras that contain it. Two of the eight remaining blocks with p values ≤0.1 were found to make smaller stability contributions, of 1.2 and 2.7 °C, whereas the other six decrease stability. Alignment of the B7P1 and B7P3 sequences (supplemental Fig. 1) shows that block 7 differs at 10 out of 56 amino acid positions in the H. insolens and C. thermophilum enzymes. In the background of the chimera with the highest T50 value, 21311131, we individually mutated each residue in B7P3 to the corresponding residue in B7P1 and determined T50 values for each. We found that only one mutation, S313C, markedly altered the thermostability of the chimera; this single mutation reduced the T50 of 21311131 by ∼10 °C (supplemental Fig. 2). To study the effect of the reverse mutation in different backgrounds, genes for the H. insolens and H. jecorina parent CBH IIs encoding the C313S substitution (C314S in H. insolens and C311S in H. jecorina) were constructed and expressed, and the T50 values of the enzymes were determined. We also quantified the stabilities of chimeras 11111131 and 22222232, in which the stabilizing B7P3 is substituted into the wild type H. insolens and H. jecorina enzymes. Both the B7P3 block substitution and the Cys-Ser single mutation markedly stabilized the parent CBH IIs; the largest effect was an ∼8 °C increase in T50 for H. jecorina CBH II containing the C311S substitution (supplemental Fig. 3). The Cys-Ser mutation was also tested in two chimeras, 31311112 and 13231111, that did not contain B7P3 as well as in a homologous CBH II (from Phanerochaete chrysosporium), which was not in the recombination parent set. The P. chrysosporium CBH II catalytic domain is only 55–56% identical to the parent CBH II catalytic domains. All of these enzymes were stabilized by the Cys-Ser substitution; the P. chrysosporium CBH II was stabilized by a remarkable 10 °C (supplemental Fig. 4). Eight of the thermostable CBH II chimeras and the parent enzymes containing the equivalent C313S mutation were His6-tagged and purified so that their specific activities could be determined. As shown in supplemental Table 4, the specific activities, as measured on amorphous cellulose (PASC) at 50 °C, for these chimeras and native enzymes containing the Cys-Ser mutation are similar to those of the wild type parents. Thus the increased thermostability does not come at the expense of specific activity. These same eight thermostable chimeras (T50 2–10 °C higher than the most stable parent) were then tested for activity on crystalline cellulose during a 16-h incubation over a range of temperatures. Fig. 2a shows that seven of eight tested thermostable chimeras were maximally active toward Avicel at 60–65 °C, with all eight chimeras retaining activity at 70 °C, the highest temperature tested. In contrast, the three parent CBH IIs show maximum activity at 50 °C and are either completely or almost completely inactive at 70 °C. Additionally, the seven chimeras with increased optimum activity temperatures hydrolyze significantly more Avicel than any of the parent CBH II enzymes. As shown in Fig. 2b, similar behaviors are observed for the H. insolens and H. jecorina parents containing the Cys-Ser mutation. The Cys-Ser mutation also increased the Avicel hydrolysis and maximum operating temperature for the P. chrysosporium CBH II. The P3B7 block substitution in the H. insolens and H. jecorina parents increased both the operating temperature and the hydrolysis of the H. insolens CBH II but did not improve overall cellulose hydrolysis by the H. jecorina enzyme. We have observed low (<1 mg/liter) secretion of wild type H. jecorina CBH II from the heterologous S. cerevisiae expression host (2Heinzelman P. Snow C.D. Wu I. Nguyen C. Villalobos A. Govindarajan S. Minshull J. Arnold F.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 5610-5615Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The C311S mutation in the wild type H. jecorina CBH II enzyme markedly increases total secreted CBH II activity (supplemental Table 5). In synthetic (SDCAA) medium, the C311S and B7P3 substitutions increase H. jecorina CBH II total secreted activity by a factor of two, whereas in rich (YPD) medium, the activity increase is 10-fold. For the H. insolens CBH II parent, which is expressed at much higher levels than the other two parent CBH IIs, the C314S mutation increased secreted activity by a factor of ∼1.5, whereas the B7P3 block substitution decreased it. Because the H. insolens and H. jecorina wild type and Cys-Ser mutants all have similar specific activities (Table 1), we conclude that the increase in total secreted cellulase activity is the result of improved secretion of the functional enzyme. A correlation between S. cerevisiae heterologous protein secretion and protein stability has been observed (6Shusta E.V. Kieke M.C. Parke E. Kranz D.M. Wittrup K.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 949-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), suggesting that the increased secretion of the Cys-Ser mutant CBH IIs might reflect their higher stabilities. To model the Cys-Ser mutation, we employed the high resolution H. insolens CBH II (Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry 1ocn) crystal structure (7Varrot A. Macdonald J. Stick R.V. Pell G. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Chem. Commun. (Camb.). 2003; : 946-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). First, we optimized the hydrogen-bond network with REDUCE (8Word J.M. Lovell S.C. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1735-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). Cys-314 was predicted to form a hydrogen bond to the carbonyl of Pro-339. To confirm this prediction, we optimized side chain packing using the modeling platform SHARPEN (9Loksha I.V. Maiolo 3rd, J.R. Hong C.W. Ng A. Snow C.D. J Comput Chem. 2009; 30: 999-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Ser-314 is predicted to make the similar interactions to Cys-314, resulting in stronger hydrogen bonding and a more favorable geometry (supplemental Fig. 5). Structure-guided SCHEMA recombination of three fungal cellobiohydrolase II (Cel6) enzymes has generated a set of functional CBH II chimeras having a high level of sequence diversity. The relatively low sequence complexity of this synthetic enzyme family (the eight sequence blocks come from one of three parent enzymes for a total of 24 sequence elements) allows important sequence-function relationships to be extracted from functional data (1Otey C.R. Landwehr M. Endelman J.B. Hiraga K. Bloom J.D. Arnold F.H. PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e112Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We previously showed that SCHEMA blocks contributed additively to the stability of cytochrome P450 chimeras; based on those results, we predicted that accurate models can be built from data on a small number (∼35) of sampled genes (3Li Y. Drummond D.A. Sawayama A.M. Snow C.D. Bloom J.D. Arnold F.H. Nat Biotechnol. 2007; 25: 1051-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). To test whether a quantitative sequence-stability model can also be generated for CBH II chimeras, we obtained a data set of 54 sequence-stability measurements and used it to generate the model. The excellent fit of the data to a simple linear model (Fig. 1) suggests that the observable portion of the chimera stability landscape may be explained with additive, context-independent stability contributions from each chimera block. This result may appear surprising as such modularity runs counter to the commonly emphasized tendency of protein mutations to exhibit coupling effects (10Fodor A.A. Aldrich R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19046-19050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The observed lack of coupling may arise from the SCHEMA chimera library design algorithm, which used dynamic programming to select recombination sites that minimize the number of disruptions (defined as residue-residue interactions not seen in parental sequences) (11Endelman J.B. Silberg J.J. Wang Z.G. Arnold F.H. Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2004; 17: 589-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It is difficult to conclusively determine the role played by the library design, however, because we lack a counterexample library with evident block-block coupling. We therefore rationalize the apparent absence of block-block coupling in the CBHII chimeras by considering two general mechanisms by which coupling might arise. First, we hypothesize that novel residue contacts not present in the parent structures are a potential cause of non-additive stability effects. Such contacts can only occur across a block-block interface, and a novel unfavorable residue pair (a more likely event than a novel favorable interaction) might lead to unfavorable block-block coupling. The CBH II library has fewer novel residue pairs, and therefore fewer potential disruptions (average number of novel contacting residue pairs 〈E〉 = 14.6), than the cytochrome P450 library (3Li Y. Drummond D.A. Sawayama A.M. Snow C.D. Bloom J.D. Arnold F.H. Nat Biotechnol. 2007; 25: 1051-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) (〈E〉 = 29.5 for folded chimeras, 34.8 for unfolded chimeras), even if normalized on a per residue basis (CBH II has 363 amino acids, cytochrome P450 has 467). The CBH II library has fewer potential disruptions for several reasons. In addition to the higher identity of the CBH II parent sequences, the barrel topology of the CBH II fold limits the number of long range contacts that can be broken by recombination. Between block contacts (heavy atoms within 4.5 Å) comprise only 27% (503/1831) of the total in a contact map derived from H. insolens structure (PDB entry 1ocn) (7Varrot A. Macdonald J. Stick R.V. Pell G. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Chem. Commun. (Camb.). 2003; : 946-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). When only counting contacts for which novel residue pairs are possible in chimeras, the interblock total is reduced to 23% (68/294). Furthermore, most of these interactions are between residues on the protein surface, and the possibility of solvent screening further decreases the chances of dramatic disruptive residue-residue interactions (supplemental Fig. 5a). One exception, a buried interaction between positions 176 and 256, is illustrated in supplemental Fig. 5b. At this site, chimeras with B6P2 and either B5P1 or B5P3 pair Met-173–Trp-253 (larger amino acid than parental pairs Met-176–Phe-256 or Leu-173–Trp-253). Nevertheless, upon inspection of the parental crystallographic models, we deem a steric clash at this position unlikely due to movement in the portion of the protein backbone, which positions Trp-253 and the intrinsic flexibility of Met side chains. Notably, one characterized chimera fits this pattern (13333232) and is more stable than the parents (67 °C), in accord with the regression model fit (68 °C). Another mechanism by which coupling could arise, block structural divergence, does not depend on the presence of novel residue pairs at block interfaces. Instead, as parental sequences diverge, intrinsic block structures may diverge, hindering modular block transplants. In the case of the CBH II library, the high parent pair sequence identifies (82, 66, and 64%) suggest that only minor structure deviations are likely (<1 Å r.m.s.d.) (12Koivula A. Reinikainen T. Ruohonen L. Valkeajärvi A. Claeyssens M. Teleman O. Kleywegt G.J. Szardenings M. Rouvinen J. Jones T.A. Teeri T.T. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 691-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We can explicitly evaluate this possibility by comparing crystallographic structures for H. insolens and H. jecorina CBH II (C. thermophilum CBH II lacks a crystal structure but is 82% identical to H. insolens). Aligning blocks from structures for each parent (PDB entries 1ocn and 1cb2 (12Koivula A. Reinikainen T. Ruohonen L. Valkeajärvi A. Claeyssens M. Teleman O. Kleywegt G.J. Szardenings M. Rouvinen J. Jones T.A. Teeri T.T. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 691-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar)) generates low α-carbon r.m.s.d. values (0.5, 0.5, 0.6, 0.5, 0.3, 0.7, 0.3, and 0.4 Å r.m.s.d.). H. jecorina blocks superimposed onto H. insolens are illustrated in supplemental Fig. 5c. To check for context-dependent effects, we performed in silico structural recombination, splicing each aligned block onto the opposing host structure. We found that it is possible to construct non-clashing structural models (α-carbons > 3 Å apart) for all single-block substitution chimeras (e.g. 11112111 or 22122222), with the exception of a minor clash (2.65 Å) when using B7P2 (11111121) due to the Asn insertion between blocks six and seven (supplemental Fig. 5d). Another important factor behind the success of the linear regression model is the fairly context-independent, dominant stabilizing contribution made by block 7 parent 3 (B7P3), whose contribution is 8.5 °C relative to B7P1 (supplemental Table 3). Reverting each of the 10 amino acids that differ in B7P3 and B7P1 to the residue in parent 1 in the background of the most thermostable CBH II chimera, 21311131, identified S313C as having an effect comparable with that of the entire B7P3 block (supplemental Fig. 3). Ser is present at this position in CBH II parent 3 (C. thermophilum) but not parents 1 (H. insolens) and 2 (H. jecorina). Mutating Cys to Ser in the wild type H. insolens and H. jecorina enzymes increased their stabilities by ∼5 and 8 °C, respectively. Making this Cys to Ser mutation in native P. chrysosporium CBH II (not included in the recombination parent set) increased the thermostability of the enzyme by 10 °C. A number of effects might explain why the Cys-Ser mutation stabilizes a broad range of CBH IIs, including native CBH IIs and chimeras. Cys and Ser are similar (although not isosteric), and these two amino acids dominate sequence alignments at this position when compared with other alternatives (see below). The hydrogen-bonding partners for this residue are backbone elements (the amide of Gly-316 and the carbonyl of Pro-339) and are therefore less likely to be dependent on third party amino acid variations. Furthermore, the immediate neighboring side chains for this pocket (Asn-283, Pro-339, Phe-345) are conserved among all four native CBH II cellulases studied. We wished also to identify the biophysical basis for the stabilizing effect of the Cys-Ser substitution. Our first hypothesis was that it removed an oxidative damage pathway. Oxidation of unpaired Cys thiol groups has been observed, for example, to lead to irreversible thermal inactivation of T4 lysozyme (13Perry L.J. Wetzel R. Protein Eng. 1987; 1: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We tested whether removing the unpaired Cys-311 side chain and replacing it with other side chains of similar size and hydrophobicity would prevent such oxidation without introducing a large structural disruption by substituting Cys-311 to Ala, Leu, and Met as well as Ser in H. jecorina CBH II. Secretion of C311L and C311M mutants was too low to allow T50 determination, whereas the T50 value for the H. jecorina C311A mutant was ∼2 °C lower than for wild type (data not shown), suggesting that oxidation of the unpaired Cys-311 side chain residue is not a dominant factor for the stabilizing effect of C311S. The high resolution (1.3 Å) H. insolens crystal structure (PDB entry 1ocn) shows that Cys-314 is part of a hydrogen-bonding network (supplemental Fig. 6). The increased hydrogen-bonding capacity of Ser relative to Cys may suggest a role for stronger hydrogen-bonding interactions in the stabilization. The crystal structure also suggests that Ser may be preferred for steric reasons. Specifically, when the Cys side chain is rebuilt with canonical bond angles, a 6° bend is removed, and Cys is pushed closer to the carbonyl of Pro-339, creating an unfavorable steric interaction. The stabilizing Cys-Ser mutation might have been found by consensus analysis (14Lockless S.W. Ranganathan R. Science. 1999; 286: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar), but such an analysis also generates many other equally likely hypotheses. We aligned the 196 protein sequences sharing the greatest identity to the H. jecorina CBH II. Fifty-four of the 250 most identical sequences were excluded from the alignment (supplemental Fig. 7) due to redundancy (i.e. point mutants for structural studies or >95% identical isoforms). There is a bias in favor of Ser-311; 158 sequences have Ser, 20 have Ala, 10 have Cys, 5 have a deletion, and 3 have Gly. However, there are 42 other positions where the most frequent choice occurs with greater than twice the frequency of the H. jecorina amino acid. The large stabilizing effect of the Cys-Ser mutation raises the possibility that Ser at this position is a global indicator of native cellulase thermostability. However, the T50 of 64.8 °C for H. insolens CBH II, which features Cys at this position, is greater than that of the C. thermophilum CBH II (64.0 °C), indicating that Ser is not the only stability determinant. Thermostability is not the only property of interest for industrial cellulases. Specific activity, changes to cellulose binding and effects on expression and product inhibition are all important as well. We found that recombination yields CBH II chimeras whose improved thermostability comes without cost to specific activity measured in short time (i.e. 2-h) cellulose hydrolysis assays. Similar observations were made for CBH IIs containing the thermostabilizing Cys-Ser mutation. In 16-h hydrolysis assays, several of the CBH II chimeras and all three tested Cys-Ser mutant CBH IIs hydrolyzed more cellulose than the native CBH IIs. This superior performance is likely the result of having specific activity comparable with that of the parent CBH IIs along with greater thermostability that allows the enzyme to continue to function for a longer time at the elevated temperatures. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that stabilizing blocks can be recombined to create novel highly stable, active cellulases. The stability regression model predicts that the CBH II SCHEMA library contains 2,026 chimeras that are more stable than the most stable parent enzyme. These chimeras are diverse and distinct from the native cellulases; they differ from the parents by between 8 and 72 mutations (an average of 50) and from each other by an average of 63 mutations. A total of 31 genes from this set were synthesized and expressed in S. cerevisiae; every one of these chimeric CBH IIs was found to be more stable than the most stable parent cellulase, from the thermophilic fungus H. insolens, as measured either by its half-life of inactivation at 63 °C (previous work (Ref. 2Heinzelman P. Snow C.D. Wu I. Nguyen C. Villalobos A. Govindarajan S. Minshull J. Arnold F.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 5610-5615Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar)) or by T50 (this work). Reducing the sequence complexity by making chimeras of only eight blocks allowed us to construct the sequence-stability model and identify a single highly stabilizing sequence block. By testing only 10 amino acid substitutions in this block, we were able to identify a single, highly stabilizing substitution. The very large stabilizing effect of the C313S substitution observed across the chimeras and in the native P. chrysosporium, H. insolens, and H. jecorina CBH II enzymes suggests that mutation of any residue at this position to Ser may stabilize any family 6 cellulase into which it is introduced. These findings demonstrate the value of using structure-guided recombination to discover important sequence-function relationships and efficiently generate whole families of highly stable enzymes.

Vitamin D analogs like calcipotriol have antipsoriatic effects and might mediate this effect by changing AMP expression. In this study, keratinocytes in lesional psoriatic plaques showed decreased expression of the AMPs β-defensin (HBD) 2 and HBD3 after topical treatment with calcipotriol. At the same time, calcipotriol normalized the proinflammatory cytokine milieu and decreased interleukin (IL)-17A, IL-17F and IL-8 transcript abundance in lesional psoriatic skin. In contrast, cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide expression was increased by calcipotriol while psoriasin expression remained unchanged. In cultured human epidermal keratinocytes the effect of different vitamin D analogs on the expression of AMPs was further analyzed. All vitamin D analogs tested blocked IL-17A induced HBD2 expression by increasing IκB-α protein and inhibition of NF-κB signaling. At the same time vitamin D analogs induced cathelicidin through activation of the vitamin D receptor and MEK/ERK signaling. These studies suggest that vitamin D analogs differentially alter AMP expression in lesional psoriatic skin and cultured keratinocytes. Balancing AMP “alarmin” expression might be a novel goal in treatment of chronic inflammatory skin diseases."

We determined the binding and cleavage properties of recombinant human Ago2. Human Ago2 was unable to cleave preformed RNA duplexes and exhibited weaker binding affinity for RNA duplexes compared with the single strand RNA. The enzyme exhibited greater RNase H activity in the presence of Mn2+ compared with Mg2+. Human Ago2 exhibited weaker binding affinities and reduced cleavage activities for antisense RNAs with either a 5'-terminal hydroxyl or abasic nucleotide. Binding kinetics suggest that the 5'-terminal heterocycle base nucleates the interaction between the enzyme and the antisense RNA, and the 5'-phosphate stabilizes the interaction. Mn2+ ameliorated the effects of the 5'-terminal hydroxyl or abasic nucleotide on Ago2 cleavage activity and binding affinity. Nucleotide substitutions at the 3' terminus of the antisense RNA had no effect on human Ago2 cleavage activity, whereas 2'-methoxyethyl substitutions at position 2 reduced binding and cleavage activity and 12-14 reduced the cleavage activity. RNase protection assays indicated that human Ago2 interacts with the first 14 nucleotides at the 5'-pole of the antisense RNA. Human Ago2 preloaded with the antisense RNA exhibited greater binding affinities for longer sense RNAs suggesting that the enzyme interacts with regions in the sense RNA outside the site for antisense hybridization. Finally, transiently expressed human Ago2 immunoprecipitated from HeLa cells contained the double strand RNA-binding protein human immunodeficiency virus, type 1, trans-activating response RNA-binding protein, and deletion mutants of Ago2 showed that trans-activating response RNA-binding protein interacts with the PIWI domain of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2032913694,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma-coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha) is a key coordinator of gene programs in metabolism and energy homeostasis in mammals. It is highly responsive to changes in the cellular environment and physiological status of mammals and regulated by post-translational modifications: acetylation, phosphorylation, and methylation. Here, we show that PGC-1alpha is covalently modified by small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) 1 protein, an important regulator of signaling and transcription. Conserved lysine residue 183 located in the activation domain of PGC-1alpha was identified as the major site of SUMO conjugation. Interestingly, the same Lys residue is also a target for acetylation. Therefore, the E185A mutation disrupting the SUMOylation consensus sequence was utilized to show that SUMOylation plays a role in the regulation of PGC-1alpha function. Our results show that SUMOylation does not have an apparent effect on the subcellular localization or the stability of PGC-1alpha, but it attenuates the transcriptional activity of the coactivator, probably by enhancing the interaction of PGC-1alpha with corepressor RIP140. Mutation that abolished the SUMOylation augments the activity of PGC-1alpha also in the context of PPARgamma-dependent transcription. Thus, our findings showing that reversible SUMOylation can adjust the activity of PGC-1alpha add a novel layer to the regulation of the coactivator."
https://openalex.org/W2066817671,"Current theories of interval timing assume that humans and other animals time as if using a single, absolute stopwatch that can be stopped or reset on command. Here we evaluate the alternative view that psychological time is represented by multiple clocks, and that these clocks create separate temporal contexts by which duration is judged in a relative manner. Two predictions of the multiple-clock hypothesis were tested. First, that the multiple clocks can be manipulated (stopped and/or reset) independently. Second, that an event of a given physical duration would be perceived as having different durations in different temporal contexts, i.e., would be judged differently by each clock.Rats were trained to time three durations (e.g., 10, 30, and 90 s). When timing was interrupted by an unexpected gap in the signal, rats reset the clock used to time the ""short"" duration, stopped the ""medium"" duration clock, and continued to run the ""long"" duration clock. When the duration of the gap was manipulated, the rats reset these clocks in a hierarchical order, first the ""short"", then the ""medium"", and finally the ""long"" clock. Quantitative modeling assuming re-allocation of cognitive resources in proportion to the relative duration of the gap to the multiple, simultaneously timed event durations was used to account for the results.These results indicate that the three event durations were effectively timed by separate clocks operated independently, and that the same gap duration was judged relative to these three temporal contexts. Results suggest that the brain processes the duration of an event in a manner similar to Einstein's special relativity theory: A given time interval is registered differently by independent clocks dependent upon the context."

https://openalex.org/W2079928791,"Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) is an important inner membrane phospholipid mostly synthesized de novo via the PE-Kennedy pathway and by the decarboxylation of phosphatidylserine. CTP:phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferase (Pcyt2) catalyzes the formation of CDP-ethanolamine, which is often the rate regulatory step in the PE-Kennedy pathway. In the current investigation, we show that the reduced CDP-ethanolamine formation in Pcyt2(+/-) mice limits the rate of PE synthesis and increases the availability of diacylglycerol. This results in the increased formation of triglycerides, which is facilitated by stimulated de novo fatty acid synthesis and increased uptake of pre-existing fatty acids. Pcyt2(+/-) mice progressively accumulate more diacylglycerol and triglycerides with age and have modified fatty acid composition, predominantly in PE and triglycerides. Pcyt2(+/-) additionally have an inherent blockage in fatty acid utilization as energy substrate and develop impaired tolerance to glucose and insulin at an older age. Accordingly, gene expression analyses demonstrated the up-regulation of the main lipogenic genes and down-regulation of mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation genes. These data demonstrate for the first time that to preserve membrane PE phospholipids, Pcyt2 deficiency generates compensatory changes in triglyceride and energy substrate metabolism, resulting in a progressive development of liver steatosis, hypertriglyceridemia, obesity, and insulin resistance, the main features of the metabolic syndrome."

Diabetes. 2007; 56: 1825-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Recent studies have linked specific subsets of metalloproteinases to inflammatory processes through their ability to cleave a wide variety of ECM-bound and cell surface cytokines (7Yu Q.

Common regulators of inflammatory cytokines and fibrogenic ligands may be the key to building an adequate tissue response, and their identification can lead to developing new strategies against tissue fibrosis.TGFβ1 is considered the major regulator of fibroblast response during normal ECM homeostasis as well as during the pathogenesis of fibrosis (9Gauldie J. Bonniaud P. Sime P. Ask K. Kolb M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2007; 35: 661-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). TGFβ1-activated fibroblasts, characterized by the expression of α-smooth muscle actin, are the main source of collagen biosynthesis in the myocardium (10Stawowy P. Kallisch H. Veinot J.P. Kilimnik A. Prichett W. Goetze S. Seidah N.G. Chrétien M. Fleck E. Graf K. Circulation. 2004; 109: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). TGFβ1 can trigger the differentiation of cardiac fibroblasts to activated myofibroblasts that synthesize collagen types I and III (11Petrov V.V. Fagard R.H. Lijnen P.J. Hypertension. 2002; 39: 258-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 12Asano Y. Ihn H. Yamane K. Kubo M. Tamaki K. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 253-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). It also regulates the proteolytic systems responsible for ECM turnover (13Overall C.M. Wrana J.L. Sodek J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14064-14071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Secreted TGFβ1 is sequestered and concentrated in the ECM by specific binding proteins, which render it biologically inactive (14Hyytiäinen M. Penttinen C. Keski-Oja J. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 2004; 41: 233-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Enhanced TGFβ1 signaling can result from defective matrix-binding due to fibrillin mutations as observed in Marfan syndrome or by increased release from the ECM through excessive proteolysis (7Yu Q. Stamenkovic I. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 163-176PubMed Google Scholar, 15Mu D. Cambier S. Fjellbirkeland L. Baron J.L. Munger J.S. Kawakatsu H. Sheppard D. Broaddus V.C. Nishimura S.L. J.

As such, MMP2, -9, and -14 have been suggested to activate latent TGFβ1 directly, via cleavage and release of latency-associated peptide (7Yu Q. Stamenkovic I. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 163-176PubMed Google Scholar, 15Mu D. Cambier S. Fjellbirkeland L. Baron J.L. Munger J.S. Kawakatsu H. Sheppard D. Broaddus V.C. Nishimura S.L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 493-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). MMPs and TGFβ1 also play a role in fibroblast migration (17Stawowy P. Margeta C. Kallisch H. Seidah N.G. Chrétien M. Fleck E. Graf K. Cardiovasc. Res. 2004; 63: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Altogether, protease activity and TGFβ1 may cooperate at several levels to generate tissue fibrosis.TGFβ1 and TNF are two multifunctional cytokines, and each inhibits the signal transduction pathways activated by the other cytokine (18Inagaki Y. Truter S. Tanaka S. Di Liberto M. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3353-3358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 19Bitzer M. von Gersdorff G. Liang D. Dominguez-Rosales A. Beg A.A. Rojkind M. Böttinger E.P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 187-197PubMed Google Scholar). During fibrosis, both compete for p300, a transcriptional cofactor that can positively or negatively modulate collagen synthesis to orient the fibrotic response (20Ghosh A.K. Varga J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2007; 213: 663-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). TNF has been shown to negatively regulate TGFβ1 signaling through its central effector molecule NF-κB, which activates the inhibitory Smad7 (21Roman-Blas J.A. Stokes D.G. Jimenez S.A. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2007; 15: 1367-1377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 22Goldberg M.T. Han Y.P. Yan C. Shaw M.C. Garner W.L. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2007; 127: 2645-2655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), providing another means of cross-talk between these two cytokines. Both TGFβ1 and TNF exist as proproteins anchored to ECM and cell surface, respectively (8Murphy G. Murthy A. Khokha R. Trends Immunol. 2008; 29: 75-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 14Hyytiäinen M. Penttinen C. Keski-Oja J. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 2004; 41: 233-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Therefore, another level of control involves the proteolytic cleavage of TNF on the cell surface and of TGFβ1 anchored to the ECM, to become soluble effector proteins. Overall, an adequate interplay of these opposing pathways is critical for a coordinated cellular stress response, which depends in part on their extracellular bioavailability.Timp3−/− mice have an abnormal inflammatory response due to excessive TNF signaling (23Mohammed F.F. Smookler D.S. Taylor S.E. Fingleton B. Kassiri Z. Sanchez O.H. English J.L. Matrisian L.M. Au B. Yeh W.C. Khokha R. Nat.

Immunol. 2006; 176: 721-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Timp3−/− hearts are more susceptible to mechanical stress induced by constriction of the aorta (aortic banding (AB)) and exhibit accelerated dilated cardiomyopathy with an early onset of heart failure, due to increased ADAM17 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17)-mediated TNF processing and enhanced MMP-mediated ECM degradation (25Kassiri Z. Oudit G.Y. Sanchez O. Dawood F. Mohammed F.F. Nuttall R.K. Edwards D.R. Liu P.P. Backx P.H. Khokha R. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 380-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Here we show that after aortic banding, Timp3−/− as well as Timp3+/− mice develop marked myocardial fibrosis offering a model to study the role of deregulated cytokine signaling in fibrosis. Using microarrays, a primary neonatal cardiomyocyte-cardiofibroblast co-culture system, and genetic and pharmacological manipulations in mice, we demonstrate the importance of TGFβ-TNF co-activation and cross-talk. Our study highlights the unique ability of TIMP3 to co-regulate these cytokines in the heart.DISCUSSIONAortic constriction is a well established experimental model to generate cardiac pressure overload (mechanical stress), representing the condition in patients with hypertension or aortic stenosis. Such tissue perturbation must invoke a coordinated response between cellular and stromal compartments through the interplay of cytokines that are regulated both in time and space. We show that TIMP3 is a common stromal regulator of critical proinflammatory (TNF) and anti-inflammatory (TGFβ1) cytokines involved in this process, and its loss initiates a distinct gene expression program after aortic banding. The concurrent increase of these two cytokines occurs at the levels of RNA expression and protein maturation involving proteolytic cleavage, leading to their concomitant bioavailability as seen through the activation of their signal transduction pathways in TIMP3 null mice. Their reciprocal induction generates an aberrant cross-talk responsible for the unconstructive tissue remodeling, which culminates in myocardial fibrosis, dysfunction, and heart failure.Microarray analyses to map changes in global gene expression suggested an early involvement of TGFβ1 in Timp3−/− mice after aortic banding. To test directly the hypothesis that TGFβ1 is responsible for fibrosis in TIMP3-deficient mice, we established a well controlled in vitro system of primary neonatal murine cardiomyocytes and cardiofibroblasts that were cultured separately or in combination. This system mimics the cellular environment and in vivo responses for expression of cytokines, MMPs, and matrix molecules. We demonstrate that the cardiomyocyte-cardiofibroblast interaction is required for a strong fibrogenic response and that Timp3−/− co-cultures have the capacity to generate a more potent fibrogenic response compared with WT co-cultures in response to agonists. Using rat neonatal co-cultures, another group has shown the importance of fibroblast-myocyte interaction for Ang II-induced collagen production (30Pathak M. Sarkar S. Vellaichamy E. Sen S. Hypertension. 2001; 37: 833-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we show that co-cultures are far more efficient at TGFβ production and release. The molecular mechanism underlying the severe phenotype associated with TIMP3 deficiency includes increased transcription as well as proteolytic processing of TGFβ1 and TNF, heightened Smad2/3 phosphorylation, and up-regulation of specific metalloproteinases capable of cleaving interstitial collagens. Additionally, the co-culture setting reveals base-line perturbations in expression of collagen I, MMPs, and cytokines, indicating altered propensity toward matrix remodeling upon loss of TIMP3.Since a neonatal culture system bears limitations, we confirmed the role of TGFβ in the severe myocardial fibrosis in Timp3−/− hearts in vivo. The removal of TNF through the use of Tnf−/− mice or blocking TGFβ1 by 1D11 antibody allowed us to dissect the importance of each cytokine. TGFβ1 was still somewhat induced in Timp3−/−/Tnf−/− mice, whereas TGFβ1-neutralizing antibody profoundly suppressed TNF induction after aortic banding, indicating that the TGFβ1 effects may supersede those of TNF. Although TNF levels rise at later points in these mice, the MMP expressions remain suppressed, with the cardiomyopathy remaining significantly improved at 3 and 6 weeks post-AB. This could suggest that the initial rise in TNF (in the presence of TGFβ) in Timp3−/− heart is the key event in triggering the disease initiation and progression and involves MMP elevation. These data collectively show that severity of the cardiac phenotype resulting from the loss of TIMP3 is due to its simultaneous impact on two opposing cytokines, one anti-inflammatory and the other proinflammatory. It disrupts their time of action, the magnitude of increase, and co-regulation, resulting in maladaptive tissue remodeling that leads to fibrosis.TGFβ1 is a key regulator of inflammation and fibrosis and is itself regulated at several levels. TGFβ1 null mice develop a multifocal inflammatory disorder and die shortly after weaning (45Shull M.M. Ormsby I. Kier A.B. Pawlowski S. Diebold R.J. Yin M. Allen R. Sidman C. Proetzel G. Calvin D.

In humans, TGFβ levels are increased in patients with fibrotic kidney disease, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and hepatic fibrosis (49Blobe G.C. Schiemann W.P. Lodish H.F. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 342: 1350-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (2167) Google Scholar). Plasma levels of TGFβ1 are twice as high in patients who have developed idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy compared with controls (50Kühl U. Noutsias M. Schultheiss H.P. Eur. Heart J. 1995; 16: 100-106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TGFβ1 polymorphisms affect its level of expression and can play a role in predisposition to fibrotic disease (49Blobe G.C. Schiemann W.P. Lodish H.F. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 342: 1350-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (2167) Google Scholar, 51Li B. Khanna A. Sharma V. Singh T. Suthanthiran M. August P. Hypertension. 1999; 33: 271-275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For instance, a polymorphism that increases TGFβ1 production has been linked to the development of fibrotic lung disease (52Awad M.R. El-Gamel A. Hasleton P. Turner D.M. Sinnott P.J. Hutchinson I.V. Transplantation. 1998; 66: 1014-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar), and one that correlates with elevated circulating levels of TGFβ1 is associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (53Holweg C.T. Baan C.C. Niesters H.G. Vantrimpont P.J. Mulder P.G. Maat A.P. Weimar W. Balk A.H. J.

Harada A. Ikeda K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 1569-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). The current study reveals yet another level of regulation for the ECM-bound TGFβ1. Its bioavailability is controlled by the proteolytic release mediated by TIMP3-sensitive metalloproteinase(s), with the loss of TIMP3 resulting in myocardial fibrosis, diastolic dysfunction, and dilated cardiomyopathy. Interruption of the TGFβ pathway by an anti-TGFβ antibody (1D11) prevented myocardial fibrosis. Echocardiographic assessment of diastolic function mirrored the changes in systolic function; the diastolic filling parameters were more affected in Timp3−/−-AB mice but exhibited a marked improvement following TGFβ blockade. The improvement in diastolic dysfunction in these mice could be partly due to improved systolic function. These results are consistent with a pivotal role of maladaptive cytokine signaling in mediating systolic and diastolic dysfunctions.Myocardial fibrosis causes reduced compliance, compromised LV filling, and diastolic heart failure (55Mandinov L. Eberli F.R. Seiler C. Hess O.M. Cardiovasc. Res. 2000; 45: 813-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 56Senni M. Redfield M.M. J. Am. Coll.

Fibrosis is a characteristic of hypertensive, hypertrophic, and dilated cardiomyopathy. A recent study reported the occurrence of interstitial fibrosis in dilated left ventricles even when no evidence of ischemic heart disease was observed (58Brooks A. Schinde V. Bateman A.C. Gallagher P.J. Heart. 2003; 89: 1255-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Further, TIMP3 levels are significantly reduced in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure (59Li Y.Y. Feldman A.M. Sun Y. McTiernan C.F. Circulation. 1998; 98: 1728-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), and as we report here, even the loss of a single TIMP3 allele in mice leads to myocardial fibrosis. Thus, TIMP3 can be a powerful therapeutic candidate in strategies aimed at blocking myocardial fibrosis at early stages of heart disease. Tissue repair requires the coordinated response between cellular and stromal compartments, involving regulated cytokine release, inflammation, cellular turnover, and structural remodeling, in order to restore organ function. The consequence of an inadequate remodeling program is reflected as necrosis, hyperplasia, and fibrosis, which are the hallmarks of multiple human diseases. Tissue fibrosis is the outcome of excessive and disorganized deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) 3The abbreviations used are: ECMextracellular matrixAng IIangiotensin IIPEphenylephrineTGFβtransforming growth factor βTNFtumor necrosis factorMMPmatrix metalloproteinaseABaortic bandingWTwild typePSRPicro-Sirius RedELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayCTcycle thresholdqPCRquantitative PCR. 3The abbreviations used are: ECMextracellular matrixAng IIangiotensin IIPEphenylephrineTGFβtransforming growth factor βTNFtumor necrosis factorMMPmatrix metalloproteinaseABaortic bandingWTwild typePSRPicro-Sirius RedELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayCTcycle thresholdqPCRquantitative PCR. proteins, resulting in disruption of normal tissue architecture and homeostasis that contributes to organ dysfunction.

The removal of TNF through the use of Tnf−/− mice or blocking TGFβ1 by 1D11 antibody allowed us to dissect the importance of each cytokine. TGFβ1 was still somewhat induced in Timp3−/−/Tnf−/− mice, whereas TGFβ1-neutralizing antibody profoundly suppressed TNF induction after aortic banding, indicating that the TGFβ1 effects may supersede those of TNF. Although TNF levels rise at later points in these mice, the MMP expressions remain suppressed, with the cardiomyopathy remaining significantly improved at 3 and 6 weeks post-AB. This could suggest that the initial rise in TNF (in the presence of TGFβ) in Timp3−/− heart is the key event in triggering the disease initiation and progression and involves MMP elevation. These data collectively show that severity of the cardiac phenotype resulting from the loss of TIMP3 is due to its simultaneous impact on two opposing cytokines, one anti-inflammatory and the other proinflammatory. It disrupts their time of action, the magnitude of increase, and co-regulation, resulting in maladaptive tissue remodeling that leads to fibrosis.TGFβ1 is a key regulator of inflammation and fibrosis and is itself regulated at several levels. TGFβ1 null mice develop a multifocal inflammatory disorder and die shortly after weaning (45Shull M.M. Ormsby I. Kier A.B. Pawlowski S. Diebold R.J. Yin M. Allen R. Sidman C. Proetzel G. Calvin D.

In humans, TGFβ levels are increased in patients with fibrotic kidney disease, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and hepatic fibrosis (49Blobe G.C. Schiemann W.P. Lodish H.F. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 342: 1350-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (2167) Google Scholar).

Heart J. 1995; 16: 100-106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TGFβ1 polymorphisms affect its level of expression and can play a role in predisposition to fibrotic disease (49Blobe G.C. Schiemann W.P.

Its bioavailability is controlled by the proteolytic release mediated by TIMP3-sensitive metalloproteinase(s), with the loss of TIMP3 resulting in myocardial fibrosis, diastolic dysfunction, and dilated cardiomyopathy. Interruption of the TGFβ pathway by an anti-TGFβ antibody (1D11) prevented myocardial fibrosis. Echocardiographic assessment of diastolic function mirrored the changes in systolic function; the diastolic filling parameters were more affected in Timp3−/−-AB mice but exhibited a marked improvement following TGFβ blockade. The improvement in diastolic dysfunction in these mice could be partly due to improved systolic function. These results are consistent with a pivotal role of maladaptive cytokine signaling in mediating systolic and diastolic dysfunctions.Myocardial fibrosis causes reduced compliance, compromised LV filling, and diastolic heart failure (55Mandinov L. Eberli F.R. Seiler C. Hess O.M. Cardiovasc. Res. 2000; 45: 813-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 56Senni M. Redfield M.M. J. Am. Coll.

Fibrosis is a characteristic of hypertensive, hypertrophic, and dilated cardiomyopathy. A recent study reported the occurrence of interstitial fibrosis in dilated left ventricles even when no evidence of ischemic heart disease was observed (58Brooks A. Schinde V. Bateman A.C. Gallagher P.J. Heart. 2003; 89: 1255-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Further, TIMP3 levels are significantly reduced in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure (59Li Y.Y. Feldman A.M. Sun Y. McTiernan C.F. Circulation. 1998; 98: 1728-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), and as we report here, even the loss of a single TIMP3 allele in mice leads to myocardial fibrosis. Thus, TIMP3 can be a powerful therapeutic candidate in strategies aimed at blocking myocardial fibrosis at early stages of heart disease. Aortic constriction is a well established experimental model to generate cardiac pressure overload (mechanical stress), representing the condition in patients with hypertension or aortic stenosis. Such tissue perturbation must invoke a coordinated response between cellular and stromal compartments through the interplay of cytokines that are regulated both in time and space. We show that TIMP3 is a common stromal regulator of critical proinflammatory (TNF) and anti-inflammatory (TGFβ1) cytokines involved in this process, and its loss initiates a distinct gene expression program after aortic banding. The concurrent increase of these two cytokines occurs at the levels of RNA expression and protein maturation involving proteolytic cleavage, leading to their concomitant bioavailability as seen through the activation of their signal transduction pathways in TIMP3 null mice. Their reciprocal induction generates an aberrant cross-talk responsible for the unconstructive tissue remodeling, which culminates in myocardial fibrosis, dysfunction, and heart failure. Microarray analyses to map changes in global gene expression suggested an early involvement of TGFβ1 in Timp3−/− mice after aortic banding. To test directly the hypothesis that TGFβ1 is responsible for fibrosis in TIMP3-deficient mice, we established a well controlled in vitro system of primary neonatal murine cardiomyocytes and cardiofibroblasts that were cultured separately or in combination. This system mimics the cellular environment and in vivo responses for expression of cytokines, MMPs, and matrix molecules. We demonstrate that the cardiomyocyte-cardiofibroblast interaction is required for a strong fibrogenic response and that Timp3−/− co-cultures have the capacity to generate a more potent fibrogenic response compared with WT co-cultures in response to agonists. Using rat neonatal co-cultures, another group has shown the importance of fibroblast-myocyte interaction for Ang II-induced collagen production (30Pathak M. Sarkar S. Vellaichamy E. Sen S. Hypertension. 2001; 37: 833-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we show that co-cultures are far more efficient at TGFβ production and release. The molecular mechanism underlying the severe phenotype associated with TIMP3 deficiency includes increased transcription as well as proteolytic processing of TGFβ1 and TNF, heightened Smad2/3 phosphorylation, and up-regulation of specific metalloproteinases capable of cleaving interstitial collagens. Additionally, the co-culture setting reveals base-line perturbations in expression of collagen I, MMPs, and cytokines, indicating altered propensity toward matrix remodeling upon loss of TIMP3.

https://openalex.org/W1973549377,"Collagen, known for its structural role in tissues and also for its participation in the regulation of homeostatic and pathological processes in mammals, is assembled from triple helices that can be either homotrimers or heterotrimers. High resolution structural information for natural collagens has been difficult to obtain because of their size and the heterogeneity of their native environment. For this reason, peptides that self-assemble into collagen-like triple helices are used to gain insight into the structure, stability, and biochemistry of this important protein family. Although many of the most common collagens in humans are heterotrimers, almost all studies of collagen helices have been on homotrimers. Here we report the first structure of a collagen heterotrimer. Our structure, obtained by solution NMR, highlights the role of electrostatic interactions as stabilizing factors within the triple helical folding motif. This addresses an issue that has been actively researched because of the predominance of charged residues in the collagen family. We also find that it is possible to selectively form a collagen heterotrimer with a well defined composition and register of the peptide chains within the helix, based on information encoded solely in the collagenous domain. Globular domains are implicated in determining the composition of several collagen types, but it is unclear what their role in controlling register may be. We show that is possible to design peptides that not only selectively choose a composition but also a specific register without the assistance of other protein constructs. This mechanism may be used in nature as well."
https://openalex.org/W2014675339,"Androgen receptor (AR) is phosphorylated at multiple sites in response to ligand binding, but the functional consequences and mechanisms regulating AR phosphorylation remain to be established. We observed initially that okadaic acid, an inhibitor of the major PPP family serine/threonine phosphatases PP2A and protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), had cell type-dependent effects on AR expression. More specific inhibitors of PP2A (fostriecin) and PP1 (tautomycin and siRNA against the PP1alpha catalytic subunit) demonstrated that PP1 and protein phosphatase 2A had opposite effects on AR protein and transcriptional activity. PP1 inhibition enhanced proteasome-mediated AR degradation, while PP1alpha overexpression increased AR expression and markedly enhanced AR transcriptional activity. Coprecipitation experiments demonstrated an AR-PP1 interaction, while immunofluorescence and nuclear-cytoplasmic fractionation showed androgen-stimulated nuclear translocation of both AR and PP1 in prostate cancer cells. Studies with phosphospecific AR antibodies showed that PP1 inhibition dramatically increased phosphorylation of Ser-650, a site in the AR hinge region shown to mediate nuclear export. Significantly, PP1 inhibition caused a marked decrease in nuclear localization of the wild-type AR, but did not alter total or nuclear levels of a S650A mutant AR. These findings reveal a critical role of PP1 in regulating AR protein stability and nuclear localization through dephosphorylation of Ser-650. Moreover, AR may function as a PP1 regulatory subunit and mediate PP1 recruitment to chromatin, where it can modulate transcription and splicing."
https://openalex.org/W2034234818,"Ten years ago the sleep disorder narcolepsy was linked to the neuropeptide hypocretin (HCRT), also known as orexin. This disorder is characterized by excessive day time sleepiness, inappropriate triggering of rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep and cataplexy, which is a sudden loss of muscle tone during waking. It is still not known how HCRT regulates REM sleep or muscle tone since HCRT neurons are localized only in the lateral hypothalamus while REM sleep and muscle atonia are generated from the brainstem. To identify a potential neuronal circuit, the neurotoxin hypocretin-2-saporin (HCRT2-SAP) was used to lesion neurons in the ventral lateral periaquaductal gray (vlPAG). The first experiment utilized hypocretin knock-out (HCRT-ko) mice with the expectation that deletion of both HCRT and its target neurons would exacerbate narcoleptic symptoms. Indeed, HCRT-ko mice (n = 8) given the neurotoxin HCRT2-SAP (16.5 ng/23nl/sec each side) in the vlPAG had levels of REM sleep and sleep fragmentation that were considerably higher compared to HCRT-ko given saline (+39%; n = 7) or wildtype mice (+177%; n = 9). However, cataplexy attacks did not increase, nor were levels of wake or non-REM sleep changed. Experiment 2 determined the effects in mice where HCRT was present but the downstream target neurons in the vlPAG were deleted by the neurotoxin. This experiment utilized an FVB-transgenic strain of mice where eGFP identifies GABA neurons. We verified this and also determined that eGFP neurons were immunopositive for the HCRT-2 receptor. vlPAG lesions in these mice increased REM sleep (+79% versus saline controls) and it was significantly correlated (r = 0.89) with loss of eGFP neurons. These results identify the vlPAG as one site that loses its inhibitory control over REM sleep, but does not cause cataplexy, as a result of hypocretin deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2053384489,"Women oxidize more fat as compared to men during endurance exercise and several groups have shown that the mRNA content of selected genes related to fat oxidation are higher in women (e.g. hormone sensitive lipase, β-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, CD36). One of the possible mechanisms is that women tend to have a higher area percentage of type I skeletal muscle fibers as compared with men. Consequently, we hypothesized that sex would influence the basal mRNA and protein content for genes involved in metabolism and the determination of muscle fiber type. Muscle biopsies from the vastus lateralis were collected from healthy men and women. We examined mRNA content globally using Affymetrix GeneChips, and selected genes were examined and/or confirmed by RT-PCR. Furthermore, we examined protein content by Western blot analysis. Stringent gene array analysis revealed 66 differentially expressed genes representing metabolism, mitochondrial function, transport, protein biosynthesis, cell proliferation, signal transduction pathways, transcription and translation. Stringent gene array analysis and RT-PCR confirmed that mRNA for; acyl-coenzyme A acyltransferase 2 (ACAA2), trifunctional protein β (HADHB), catalase, lipoprotein lipase (LPL), and uncoupling protein-2 (UCP-2) were higher in women. Targeted gene analysis revealed that myosin heavy chain I (MHCI), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)δ were higher in women compared with men. Surprisingly, there were no significant sex based differences in protein content for HADHB, ACAA2, catalase, PPARδ, and MHC1. In conclusion, the differences in the basal mRNA content in resting skeletal muscle suggest that men and women are transcriptionally “primed” for known physiological differences in metabolism however the mechanism behind sex differences in fiber type remains to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W2140577256,"Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) is a chromatin-associated nuclear protein and functions as a molecular stress sensor. At the cellular level, PARP1 has been implicated in a wide range of processes, such as maintenance of genome stability, cell death, and transcription. PARP1 functions as a transcriptional coactivator of nuclear factor KB(NF-ΚB) and hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF1). In proteomic studies, PARP1 was found to be modified by small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMOs). Here, we characterize PARP1 as a substrate for modification by SUMO1 and SUMO3, both in vitro and in vivo. PARP1 is sumoylated at the single lysine residue K486 within its automodification domain. Interestingly, modification of PARP1 with SUMO does not affect its ADP-ribosylation activity but completely abrogates p300-mediated acetylation of PARP1, revealing an intriguing crosstalk of sumoylation and acetylation on PARP1. Genetic complementation of PARP1-depleted cells with wildtype and sumoylation-deficient PARP1 revealed that SUMO modification of PARP1 restrains its transcriptional coactivator function and subsequently reduces gene expression of distinct PARP1-regulated target genes.

https://openalex.org/W1998675758,"Background Archaeobotanical samples of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) found at Qasr Ibrim display a two-row phenotype that is unique to the region of archaeological sites upriver of the first cataract of the Nile, characterised by the development of distinctive lateral bracts. The phenotype occurs throughout all strata at Qasr Ibrim, which range in age from 3000 to a few hundred years. Methodology and Findings We extracted ancient DNA from barley samples from the entire range of occupancy of the site, and studied the Vrs1 gene responsible for row number in extant barley. Surprisingly, we found a discord between the genotype and phenotype in all samples; all the barley had a genotype consistent with the six-row condition. These results indicate a six-row ancestry for the Qasr Ibrim barley, followed by a reassertion of the two-row condition. Modelling demonstrates that this sequence of evolutionary events requires a strong selection pressure. Conclusions The two-row phenotype at Qasr Ibrim is caused by a different mechanism to that in extant barley. The strength of selection required for this mechanism to prevail indicates that the barley became locally adapted in the region in response to a local selection pressure. The consistency of the genotype/phenotype discord over time supports a scenario of adoption of this barley type by successive cultures, rather than the importation of new barley varieties associated with individual cultures."

Because of their unique oxygen chemistry and their key role in drug and xenobiotic metabolism, particular attention has been devoted in elucidating their mechanism of substrate recognition. In this work, we analyzed the three-dimensional structures of a monomeric cytochrome P450 from Saccharopolyspora erythraea, commonly called EryK, and the binding kinetics to its physiological ligand, erythromycin D. Three different structures of EryK were obtained: two ligand-free forms and one in complex with its substrate. Analysis of the substrate-bound structure revealed the key structural determinants involved in substrate recognition and selectivity. Interestingly, the ligand-free structures of EryK suggested that the protein may explore an open and a closed conformation in the absence of substrate. In an effort to validate this hypothesis and to investigate the energetics between such alternative conformations, we performed stopped-flow absorbance experiments. Data demonstrated that EryK binds erythromycin D via a mechanism involving at least two steps. Contrary to previously characterized cytochrome P450s, analysis of double jump mixing experiments confirmed that this complex scenario arises from a pre-existing equilibrium between the open and closed subpopulations of EryK, rather than from an induced-fit type mechanism.

They catalyze the oxidation of non-reactive C-H bonds and are involved in numerous metabolic reactions of many physiological endogenous compounds (i.e. antibiotics, lipids, and steroids), as well as xenobiotic molecules (2Davydov D.R.

Tang Y. Chen A.Y. Schnarr N.A. Cane D.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 195-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). EryK acts as a hydroxylase on the C-12 of the macrolactone ring of the metabolic intermediate erythromycin D (ErD). 5The abbreviations used are: ErDerythromycin DErAerythromycin AErBerythromycin BSRSsubstrate recognition sitesBisTris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolPDBProtein Data Bank. This catalytic step follows the initial C-6 hydroxylation, performed by the P450 EryF, and the insertion of two deoxysugar units on the fifth and third positions of 6-deoxyerythronolide B, performed by glycosyl transferases EryBV and EryCIII, respectively. The biosynthetic pathway is then completed by a methyl transferase, EryG, which transfers a methyl moiety on the mycarosyl sugar (12Lambalot R.H. Cane D.E. Aparicio J.J. Katz L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1858-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 13Stassi D. Donadio S. Staver M.J. Katz L. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 182-189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). EryG may also competitively act on ErD yielding a shunt metabolite, erythromycin B (ErB), which is an unsuitable substrate for further conversion by EryK to erythromycin A (14Chen Y. Deng W. Wu J. Qian J. Chu J. Zhuang Y. Zhang S. Liu W. Appl. Env. Microbiol. 2008; 74: 1820-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This gives rise to significant shunt product accumulation during commercial fermentation of erythromycin A. erythromycin D erythromycin A erythromycin B substrate recognition sites 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol Protein Data Bank. Here we report a structural and biophysical characterization of recombinant EryK. We obtained three different crystal structures, two in the ligand-free form and one bound to ErD. On the basis of these structures we propose a mechanism for substrate recognition and regioselectivity and we highlight the conformational changes involved in substrate binding to EryK. Furthermore, we show that the ligand-free structure of EryK may be shifted from an open to a closed state by increasing ionic strength conditions. In an effort to support these observations, we present an extensive characterization of the binding kinetics of EryK to ErD, using both single and double mixing time-resolved stopped-flow experiments. The significance of our results, in the context of previous characterization of the structure and function of P450s, will be also discussed. Recombinant His-tagged EryK was overexpressed in the BL21 STARTM (DE3) Escherichia coli strain (Invitrogen) and purified as described previously (15Savino C. Sciara G. Miele A.E. Kendrew S.G. Vallone B. Protein Pept. Lett. 2008; 15: 1138-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Purified EryK was concentrated and stored at 193 K. To assess its oligomerization state, EryK was subjected to ultracentrifugation in a Beckman Optima XL-1 instrument equipped with absorbance optics. Protein samples, measured at a concentration of 15 μm in the presence of 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, at 298 K, were found to be monomeric (supplemental Fig. S1). Three crystal forms of EryK were obtained in different crystallization conditions: with His tag (His6-EryK) in low salt conditions, without tag (EryK) in high salt, and in complex with its substrate erythromycin D (ErD-EryK) (Table 1). All crystallization protocols were carried out at 294 K by vapor diffusion and ErD was introduced by co-crystallization. Diffraction data were collected at 100 K at the ESRF synchrotron (Grenoble, France) beamlines ID14-3 using a marCCD detector, and ID14-2 using a ADSC Q4R detector. Data were integrated and scaled using the HKL suite (16Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar), except for His6-EryK data, which were processed with MOSFLM (17Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCP4/ESF-EACBM Newsl. Prot. Crystallogr. 1992; 26: 27-33Google Scholar) and scaled with SCALA in the CCP4 suite (18Collaborative Computational Project, N.4Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

Open table in a new tab In all cases molecular replacement was carried out to determine the initial crystallographic phases using the program MolRep (19Vagin A. Teplyakov A. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 400-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) from the CCP4 suite (18Collaborative Computational Project, N.4Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 7690-7763Google Scholar). The ligand-free form of His6-EryK was determined using EryF coordinates (20Cupp-Vickery J.R. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 144-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar) (33.9% sequence identity, supplemental Fig. S2) as a search model (PDB code 1OXA). EryK was similarly determined by molecular replacement with His6-EryK coordinates as a search model. EryK coordinates were used to solve the structure of ErD-EryK. Initial atomic models were subjected to iterative rounds of building and refinement. Refinement was carried out with Refmac5 (21Pannu N.S. Murshudov G.N. Dodson E.J. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 1285-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) in CCP4, followed by model building and manual readjustment performed in QUANTA (Accelrys Inc.). Solvent molecules were added into the Fo − Fc density map, contoured at 3σ, with the X-SOLVATE tool of QUANTA. Secondary structure assignment was performed using the Kabsch and Sander algorithm and geometrical quality of final models was assessed using PROCHECK (22Laskowski R.A. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 1049-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). The first 14 to 18 N-terminal residues, depending on the crystal form, are missing in all models due to insufficient electron density in this region. Final statistics are shown in Table 1. All figures were produced with PyMOL. Root mean square deviation and sequence identity among the structures of EryK, PikC, and EryF were determined using CE (23Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 739-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1702) Google Scholar). Sequence numbering refers to EryK (SwissProt accession A4FNo_SACEN; NCBI accession YP_001102980); secondary structure elements are named following P450 convention. Because catalysis would require the presence of external reducing agents and EryK was purified in its oxidized form, addition of ErD results in monitoring only the binding reaction (12Lambalot R.H. Cane D.E. Aparicio J.J. Katz L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1858-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thus, all the experiments reported in this work refer to the binding reaction of EryK to ErD, in the absence of catalysis. Binding affinities of ErD to EryK in different ionic strength conditions were determined (at 298 K) by titrating 2 μm enzyme with the ligand, ErD, in a total volume of 800 μl of 50 mm Tris·HCl buffer, pH 7.5, with and without 2 m NaCl. Ligand concentration covered a suitable range from 0 to 300 μm. UV visible spectra (190–820 nm) were recorded after each addition and the absorbance intensities at 420 and 390 nm were plotted against the logarithm of the added ligand concentrations (data not shown). From each of the substrate-bound spectra were subtracted the appropriate blank. The dissociation constant (KD) was estimated using the Kaleidagraph software package. A nonlinear regression analysis was applied using hyperbolic equation ΔAUobs = ΔAUmax [L]/(KD + [L]), where ΔAUobs is the absorbance difference, ΔAUmax is the maximum absorbance difference extrapolated to infinite ligand concentration, and [L] is the ligand analytical concentration. Data were also globally fitted with the program Prism (Graphpad). The time evolution of the EryK-ErD interaction was followed by monitoring the change in absorbance at 390 nm on a stopped-flow apparatus. Measurements were performed on a SX18-MV stopped-flow instrument (Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, UK) using both symmetric and asymmetric (1:10) mixing. In the symmetric mixing mode, EryK, at a final constant concentration of 7.5 μm, was mixed with ErD diluted to the desired final concentration, varying in a range from 9 to 150 μm. The traces were recorded in 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, at 288 K, both in the absence and presence of 2 m NaCl. In the asymmetric mixing mode, varying the NaCl concentration in a range from 0 to 3.6 m, the kinetic traces of the interaction between EryK (final constant concentration of 5.5 μm) and ErD (final constant concentration of 100 μm) were recorded at 288 K in 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5. Kinetic traces were extracted from the acquired spectra (recorded as average of at least three experiments) and analyzed using the Kaleidagraph software package. To characterize the pre-equilibrium stage of the open and closed conformations of EryK, we performed double mixing measurements carried out in 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, by using an Applied Photophysics SX18-MV stopped-flow instrument at 288 K. EryK (13.5 μm) was incubated in 2 m NaCl for different delay times and then symmetrically mixed with ErD at a final concentration of 100 μm, in 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, with 2 m NaCl. The observed amplitudes, reflecting the fraction of molecules populating the open and closed conformations, were plotted as a function of delay times and fitted to a single exponential decay. Classically, complex kinetics for a monomeric protein, as EryK, undergoing a ligand-induced conformational change, is described by the Scheme 1. A binding event progressing through pathways 1 and 2 is representative of an induced fit model, whereby ligand binding is postulated to induce a conformational change (24Koshland Jr., D.E. Némethy G. Filmer D. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 365-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (2208) Google Scholar), which may be transmitted to neighboring residues as shown in Scheme 2. Under such conditions, observations of biphasic kinetics arise from the accumulation of the EryK-ErD reaction intermediate. When and if the fast phase is λ1 ≫ λ2, the fast phase λ1 is due to the initial encounter between the EryK and ErD molecules, with an observed rate constant shown in Equation 1. λ1=k1[ErD]+K1(Eq. 1) Furthermore, the slow phase λ2 is then expected to increase hyperbolically with increasing ErD concentration as shown in Equation 2. λ2=k-2+k2[ErD]KD'+[ErD](Eq. 2) where KD'=k-1k1(Eq. 3) In this case, λ2 is expected to equal k−2 at [ErD] = 0 and (k−2 + k2) at [ErD] → ∞.SCHEME 2View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Alternatively, a binding event progressing through pathways 3 and 4 assumes that two alternative conformations are in pre-equilibrium in the absence of the ligand, formally similar to a concerted or conformational selection model (25Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6184) Google Scholar). Accordingly, complex kinetics may arise from a heterogeneous conformational ensemble of EryK, which may populate, in the absence of ligand, experimentally detectable populations of both EryK and EryK*. Under such conditions, and if k−2 ≫ (k1 + k−1), the fast phase would arise from an initial population of monomers in the EryK* conformation and would occur with a rate constant as described in Equation 4. λ1=k2[ErD]+k-2(Eq. 4) On the other hand, the slow phase λ2 is expected to decrease hyperbolically with increasing ErD concentration as shown in Equation 5. λ2=k1+k-1KD'KD'+[ErD](Eq. 5) where KD'=k-2k2(Eq. 6) In this case, λ2 is expected to approach (k−1 + k1) at [ErD] = 0 and k1 at [ErD] → ∞. EryK displays the typical topology of previously characterized P450s (Fig. 2). This enzyme shows the highest sequence identity with EryF (33.9%), which is involved in the same biosynthetic pathway (see supplemental Fig. S2). The conserved protein core is formed by a four-helix bundle, three parallel helices (D, L, and I) and an antiparallel one (E). The prosthetic heme group is located between the distal helix I and the proximal helix L and it is bound to Cys353, the highly conserved fifth ligand of the heme iron. Despite a conserved overall structure, P450s display a wide range of substrate specificities (1Wreck-Reichhart D. Feyereisen R. Genome Biol. 2000; 1: 3003.1-3003.9Google Scholar). At a structural level, P450 substrate recognition and binding is assured by six so called “substrate recognition sites” (SRS) that line the active site (26Gotoh O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 83-90Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the definition of SRS becomes obsolete once the structure has been determined and precise protein-substrate contacts have been revealed, we will use in this section this nomenclature to define the amino acid topology because in EryK the elements that contact the substrate correspond to these SRS. These regions are: SRS1, formed either by the BC loop (as in EryK) or the B′ helix (as in EryF); SRS2 formed by the C-terminal part of helix F; SRS3 formed by the N-terminal part of helix G; SRS4 formed by the central part of the distal helix I; SRS5 formed by the loop at the C-terminal end of helix K; SRS6 formed by the β-hairpin β4 (supplemental Fig. S2). Some SRSs may rearrange upon substrate binding, formally following an induced fit scenario (4Pylypenko O. Schlichting I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 991-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The superposition of the crystal structures of the two ligand-free forms of EryK (Fig. 2C), obtained at low and high salt, reveals that there are two different conformations for this protein in the unbound state, involving, among others, a movement of the BC loop of about 11 Å. Furthermore, helix G kinks at the level of Pro192, causing its N-terminal part to shift about 10 Å toward the BC loop. Interestingly, Pro192 is not conserved in homologous P450. The movement of helix G also pulls the FG loop and helix F, causing the latter to unwind almost completely (Figs. 2C and 3A, and supplemental Movie 1). This reorganization, observed in the EryK structure at high ionic strength, closes the access channel for the active site of the molecule. Although the last two C-terminal turns of helix F keep parallel to the moving part of helix G, its N-terminal part (Asp158–Asp164) adopts a coil conformation upon active site closing. As shown in detail in Fig. 3C, the coil conformation of helix F causes the loss of a H-bond between His243 and Ser166 and contact between Trp165 and Pro192 that connect helix I to helix G through helix F in an open ligand-free EryK structure obtained at low ionic strength. Moreover, Trp165 rotates and docks in a new position pointing toward helix I and interacts with His243 (supplemental Movie 2). In summary, these rearrangements result in a marked reduction of the exposure of the heme distal site that identifies two different conformations to which we will refer to as “open” and “closed” depending on the position of helices F and G and the BC loop. Importantly, an open/closed transition has been previously observed in other P450s, as in the case of the Bacillus megaterium flavocytochrome P450 BM3 (CYP102) (27Li H. Poulos T.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1995; 51: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 28Ravichandran K.G. Boddupalli S.S. Hasermann C.A. Peterson J.A. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1993; 261: 731-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar) and PikC (CYP107L1), the Streptomyces venezuelae P450 involved in C-12 hydroxylation in the pikromycin biosynthetic pathway (29Sherman D.H. Li S. Yermalitskaya L.V. Kim Y. Smith J.A. Waterman M.R. Podust L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26289-26297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). We co-crystallized EryK in a complex with ErD. The well defined electron density of the substrate was unambiguously positioned in the active site (Fig. 3B). The cavity hosting the substrate involves essentially two regions: a fixed one, formed by the loop at the helix K C-terminal, the β-hairpins β4 and β1 (Asp46–Gly49), and a mobile one, formed by the BC loop and the F and G helices. A central feature of ErD recognition involves anchoring of the two sugar substituents, a desosamine on C-5 and a mycarosyl group on C-3 of the macrolactone ring (supplemental Table S1 and Fig. 3B). Desosamine interacts mainly with the loop at the helix K C-terminal, by two H-bonds with Gln290 and Gln292; moreover, Ile392 in the β-hairpin β4 ensures the sugar clamping by van der Waals contacts. It is worth emphasizing that this is the only amino acid close to the forbidden conformation in the Ramachandran plot for the refined ErD-EryK structure, suggesting a critical structural role (30Cheng G. Qian B. Samudrala R. Baker D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 5861-5867Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 31Heringa J. Argos P. Proteins. 1999; 37: 44-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). All these interactions would be absent for a ligand lacking the desosamine sugar as in the case of the biosynthetic intermediate MycEB (see Fig. 1). Mycarose interacts with the mobile part of the channel establishing four crossed H-bonds with His88 and Glu89 on BC loop (Fig. 3B). Its position is also restricted by van der Waals interactions with the FG loop, which closes down on top of it. Substrate binding can therefore be described as landing on the fixed region followed by closure of two “arms” consisting of the BC loop and the F and G helices. The selectivity for ErD against ErB is clearly explained by this structure. Indeed, methylation of 3′-OH would interfere with the complete closure of the arms to embrace the substrate, caused by clashes with Met86, His88, and Glu89 in the BC loop. The macrolactone ring of ErD establishes hydrophobic interactions with residues on helix I, helix K on the C-terminal, and β-hairpin β4 (Table S1). Ile244 and Thr245 on helix I lie in the active site, and the amino acids in these topological positions are believed to be involved in catalysis, playing a role in stabilization and proton delivery to the iron-bound dioxygen species (32Meunier B. de Visser S.P. Shaik S. Chem. Rev. 2004; 104: 3947-3980Crossref PubMed Scopus (1871) Google Scholar). Altogether packing the macrolactone ring against the heme and SRS4 is very tight, explaining why limited hydroxylation at C-12 was observed when bulky substituents were introduced in C-13 (33Pacey M.S. Dirlam J.P. Geldart R.W. Leadlay P.F. McArthur H.A. McCormick E.L. Monday R.A. O'Connell T.N. Staunton J. Winchester T.J. J.

Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6416-6425Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and also why there is no flexibility allowed for substrate hydroxylation sites, as observed for PikC (29Sherman D.H. Li S. Yermalitskaya L.V. Kim Y. Smith J.A. Waterman M.R. Podust L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26289-26297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), where empty pockets in the binding site are present. In ErD-EryK, the target of hydroxylation C-12 of the macrolactone ring is positioned 5.3 Å from the heme iron. Similar distances between the hydroxylation site and the iron have been reported for other P450s, such as EryF (Fe-C6 4.8 Å) and P450cam (Fe-C5 4.2 Å) (35Poulos T.L. Finzel B.C. Howard A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 687-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (1296) Google Scholar). The water molecule bound to the oxidized heme iron in the ligand-free structure of EryK disappears and a new one (Wat102) is found at 2.7 Å from the metal, which is H-bonded to the substrate 11-OH group. This water occupies a position that almost coincides with the O-2 atom of dioxygen bound to P450cam. Two more water molecules are found in the vicinity of Thr245, Wat4 and Wat38, which in P450cam appear upon dioxygen binding (36Schlichting I. Berendzen J. Chu K. Stock A.M. Maves S.A. Benson D.E. Sweet R.M. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Sligar S.G. Science. 2000; 287: 1615-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1219) Google Scholar). Moreover, Wat27 is also positioned as in P450cam, hydrogen bonded to conserved Asp362. Therefore, taking into account the carbonyl atom of Gly242, in ErD-EryK we find a water molecule chain that leads from the active site to the bulk. This network corresponds closely to that observed in the oxygen-bound form of P450cam, with Wat102 mimicking the bound dioxygen (supplemental Fig. S3). From this work we cannot determine the mechanism of EryK catalysis, but given the conservation of water molecules in the active site and Thr241, we may infer that the general catalytic mechanism proposed for bacterial P450 is conserved. Structural rearrangements due to substrate binding occur in the most dynamic regions of EryK (F and G helices and BC loop). Movements of these elements are not hindered from crystal contacts in open, closed, and closed-bound EryK. The ErD-EryK structure resembles the closed ligand-free form (Fig. 2, B and D), but new interactions are found that work as a molecular device that switches upon substrate binding. The movement of the BC loop in ErD-EryK is less pronounced than in the closed ligand-free form, because interactions with the mycarose hinder its full transition. Moreover, helices F and G move less on top of the substrate channel (9 Å displacement instead of 11 Å); helix G kinks at the level of Pro192 and, together with the FG loop, adopts a conformation similar to the closed ligand-free structure (Cα differences “ligand-free closed”/ErD-EryK ∼ 1.5 Å). Helix F in the ErD-EryK structure follows the movement of helix G, being lifted about one turn (3.7 Å) and tilted by 13°. This helix is not unwound on its N-terminal side, whereas in the ligand-free closed structure it loses the α helix geometry almost completely (Figs. 2B and 3A, and supplemental Movie 3). Therefore, in the open and substrate-bound structures, helix F is present and held by H-bonds wit"

In addition, we identify a conserved histidine as a residue crucial for heme binding.

Although mutations in various mitochondrial enzymes can result in LS, its most frequent trigger is deficiency of cytochrome c oxidase (COX) caused by mutations in the SURF1 gene, as identified in LS patients (2Tiranti V.

Human SURF1, the first gene of the SURFEIT gene locus on chromosome 9, encodes a 30-kDa protein related to COX assembly (2Tiranti V. Hoertnagel K. Carrozzo R. Galimberti C. Munaro M. Granatiero M.

Leigh syndrome cytochrome c oxidase high performance liquid chromatography isothermal titration calorimetry subunit(s). Mitochondrial COX consists of up to 13 subunits (SU). The three core SU encoded by the mitochondrial genome carry all of the redox-active cofactors, two heme a moieties, and three copper ions. These three SU are highly conserved among different organisms and represent the main components of bacterial oxidase complexes as well (4Belevich I. Verkhovsky M.I. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2008; 10: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 5Pereira M.M. Santana M. Teixeira M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1505: 185-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). The assembly process of mitochondrial COX is only marginally understood, involving the interplay of a large number of auxiliary proteins (6Fontanesi F. Soto I.C. Horn D. Barrientos A. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2006; 291: C1129-C1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 7Herrmann J.M. Funes S. Gene. 2005; 354: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 8Khalimonchuk O. Rödel G.

Despite intensive efforts over more than a decade to unravel Surf1 function, its exact role in COX assembly still remains unclear. Surf1 is not strictly essential for COX assembly because patients with LS have residuals of assembled oxidase with remaining activity of approximately 10–20% in all tissues (2Tiranti V. Hoertnagel K. Carrozzo R. Galimberti C. Munaro M. Granatiero M. Zelante L. Gasparini P. Marzella R. Rocchi M. Bayona-Bafaluy M.P. Enriquez J.A. Uziel G. Bertini E. Dionisi-Vici C. Franco B. Meitinger T. Zeviani M.

Chevrette M. Brown G.K. Brown R.M. Shoubridge E.A. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Located in the inner mitochondrial membrane, Surf1 is predicted to form two transmembrane helices connected by a long loop facing the intermembrane space (10Mashkevich G. Repetto B. Glerum D.M. Jin C. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14356-14364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 11Yao J. Shoubridge E.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2541-2549Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Sequence alignments confirm the presence of Surf1 homologs in many eukaryotes and prokaryotes (12Poyau A. Buchet K. Godinot C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 416-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). One of the best studied Surf1 proteins is the yeast homolog Shy1p, which has been discovered and characterized in the context of pet mutants (10Mashkevich G. Repetto B. Glerum D.M. Jin C. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14356-14364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Deletion of the gene leads to a strongly decreased COX level, although the residual enzyme appears fully functional. This points to a role of Shy1p in assembly or stabilization of COX (13Nijtmans L.G. Artal Sanz M. Bucko M. Farhoud M.H. Feenstra M. Hakkaart G.A. Zeviani M. Grivell L.A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 46-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), most likely during the formation of an early assembly intermediate consisting of the highly conserved core SU I and II (14Barrientos A. Korr D. Tzagoloff A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). So far, only three bacterial homologs have been inspected in closer detail (15Bundschuh F.A. Hoffmeier K. Ludwig B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1777: 1336-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 16Smith D. Gray J. Mitchell L. Antholine W.E. Hosler J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17652-17656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In Paracoccus denitrificans, two Surf1 homologs were identified and named Surf1c and Surf1q for their specific role in serving a heme aa3-type COX and a related heme ba3-type quinol oxidase, respectively (15Bundschuh F.A. Hoffmeier K. Ludwig B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1777: 1336-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). With the function of Surf1 in COX assembly still being speculative, a role in heme a insertion into COX SU I seemed conceivable (15Bundschuh F.A. Hoffmeier K. Ludwig B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1777: 1336-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 16Smith D. Gray J. Mitchell L. Antholine W.E. Hosler J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17652-17656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Here we show that P. denitrificans Surf1c and Surf1q are able to bind heme a both in vivo and in vitro. This novel finding suggests that Surf1 proteins promote heme a insertion into SU I of either cytochrome c oxidase or quinol oxidase. In addition, Surf1 may modulate heme a synthase activity and provide a heme a cofactor pool in a safe, chelated form for COX SU I biogenesis. The surf1c gene was obtained via PCR using Paracoccus genomic DNA as template with the forward primer (5′-TATAAGCTTCATATGGCCCGG(CATCAC)5ATGCGCCGTTACCTGTTCCC-3′) containing the sequence for an N-terminal His10 tag and an NdeI site and the reverse primer (5′-ATGAGCTCTCTAGACTAGAATTGCCGCTGCCTG-3′) specifying a SacI site. The product was NdeI- and SacI-digested and cloned into the Escherichia coli expression plasmid pET22b (Novagen), resulting in pFA48. The surf1q gene was obtained via PCR using Paracoccus genomic DNA as template with the forward primer (5′-TATAAGCTTCATATGGCCCGG(CATCAC)5GTGACCCTGCGCCGGCTGG-3′) containing the sequence for an N-terminal His10 tag and an NdeI site and the reverse primer (5′-ATGAGCTCTCTAGACCTTTGCGCCCGTCAGTCC-3′) adding a SacI site. The product was NdeI- and SacI-digested and cloned into the E. coli expression plasmid pET22b, generating pFA49. After sequencing, Surf1 expression plasmids pFA48 and pFA49 were transformed into E. coli C41(DE3) (17Miroux B. Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar) competent cells, generating expression strains FA48 and FA49. For cloning a heme a maturation plasmid, the pEC86 (18Arslan E. Schulz H. Zufferey R. Künzler P. Thöny-Meyer L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) derivative pGR50 was obtained via PCR using a forward primer (5′-ATGGAAGCCGGCGGCACCTC-3′) and reverse primer (5′-CTCGAGTATAGGGTACCACACGGTGCCTGACTGCGTT-3′), which introduces an Acc65I and an XhoI restriction site downstream of the tet promoter. The farnesyltransferase gene ctaB was amplified via PCR using Paracoccus genomic DNA as template with the forward primer (5′-TCAAGGTGTACAAAGGAGATACTCATGGCCGATATCAACGCATAT-3′) introducing a BsrGI restriction site and a ribosome-binding site and the reverse primer (5′-TAATAGCTCGAGATATGGGTACCTCACCATCCTCCGACCCAG-3′) adding an Acc65I and an XhoI site. The PCR product was BsrGI- and XhoI-digested and cloned into the Acc65I and XhoI sites of pGR50, resulting in the plasmid pGR51. In the next step, the heme a synthase gene ctaA was amplified via PCR using genomic Paracoccus DNA as template with the forward primer (5′-TCAAGGTGTACAAAGGAGATACTCATGTCGCGCCCGATCGAGAAG-3′) again introducing a BsrGI site and a ribosome-binding site and the reverse primer (5′-TAATAGCTCGAGATATGGGTACCTCATCGGACAGTTCCCCG-3′) adding an Acc65I and an XhoI site. This product was ligated into the Acc65I and XhoI sites of pGR51, generating the final heme a maturation plasmid pGR52. After sequencing, pGR52 was transformed into the Surf1 expression strains FA48 and FA49 (see above), resulting in FA48GR52 and FA49GR52, respectively. To introduce the H193A mutation into Surf1c, the mutant primer (5′-GTCGCGGTCGAGGGAATTCCGAACAACGCCCTGAGCTATGCC-3′) specifying the amino acid exchange and an EcoRI site for screening purposes as well as the expression vector pFA48 (see above) as template were used in a QuikChange mutagenesis reaction (Stratagene). Clones were checked for the mutation via restriction analysis and sequencing and were subsequently transformed into E. coli C41(DE3) cells already containing the plasmid pGR52. For the Surf1q H202A mutation, a forward primer (5′-GCGCTGGGCTATGCGGCGACCTGG-3′) containing the sequence for the mutation that also introduces a BseYI site and a reverse primer (5′-GCTGTTGCGAAAACGGACCACGGTCA-3′) were used to amplify the expression plasmid pFA49 (see above) via PCR. After confirming the mutation, a plasmid was transformed into E. coli C41(DE3) cells that already contained the plasmid pGR52. Ten-liter E. coli cultures were grown on rich medium containing antibiotics at 32 °C in baffled flasks. Protein expression was induced with 1 mm final concentration isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at A600 = 1.0, and cells were harvested after 3.5 h. Membranes were prepared by established methods, and protein concentration was determined using a modified Lowry protocol (19Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Markwell M.A. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5319) Google Scholar). Expression of heme a-synthesizing enzymes was checked by acidic acetone/ether extraction (21Weinstein J.D. Beale S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6799-6807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of heme from a small portion of the E. coli culture. After evaporation of the ether, the heme preparation was dissolved in 200 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide and analyzed by subsequent pyridine spectra of the extract (see below). A heme a solution was prepared from purified COX (22Hendler R.W. Pardhasaradhi K. Reynafarje B. Ludwig B. Biophys. J. 1991; 60: 415-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) as mentioned above, and the concentration was determined spectroscopically. Membranes were solubilized in the presence of 3% (w/v) Triton X-100 in buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl) at a final protein concentration of 10 mg/ml. The solubilisate was loaded on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen), and Triton X-100 was exchanged against n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside by washing with 10 column volumes of buffer (as above) containing 0.02% (w/v) n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside and 20 mm imidazole. After washing the column with 4 column volumes of buffer containing 50 mm imidazole and 80 mm imidazole each, His-tagged Surf1 was eluted from the column by washing with 5 column volumes of buffer containing 200 mm imidazole. For isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements (see below), Surf1 proteins were purified further by size-exclusion chromatography on an Äkta purifier system (GE Healthcare) using a Superose 6 column equilibrated with 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% (w/v) n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside. Redox difference spectra were recorded in the visible range on a Hitachi U-3000 spectrometer. Native and denaturing spectra were recorded by established methods (23Ludwig B. Schatz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1980; 77: 196-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), and heme a concentration was determined using the extinction coefficient ϵ587–620 nm = 21.7 cm−1m−1 for heme a (24Williams Jr., J.N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1964; 107: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). For SDS-PAGE, samples were denatured in SDS-containing buffer for 20 min at 37 °C. Electrophoresis was performed on 12% polyacrylamide gels according to Laemmli (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar). For heme staining, samples were incubated with lithium dodecyl sulfate-PAGE sample buffer on ice. Lithium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis was performed overnight at 4 °C on 12% polyacrylamide gels (26Delepelaire P. Chua N.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1979; 76: 111-115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and proteins were blotted on polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. After heme staining (27Dutta C. Henry H.L. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 184: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), membranes were destained with methanol, and proteins were stained with Ponceau S. ITC measurements were carried out on a VP-ITC ultrasensitive titration calorimeter (MicroCal LLC, Northampton, MA). Protein samples were dialyzed twice for several hours at 4 °C against measuring buffer (see Table 1) and centrifuged (20,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C) to remove insoluble material. ITC titrations and data analyses were performed as described (28Anderka O. Loenze P. Klabunde T. Dreyer M.K. Defossa E. Wendt K.U. Schmoll D.

Open table in a new tab In earlier studies of our group, we showed that the two P. denitrificans homologs Surf1c and Surf1q act exclusively on their cognate oxidase (15Bundschuh F.A. Hoffmeier K. Ludwig B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1777: 1336-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Here, we focus on the heterologous expression and characterization of the two Surf1 homologs to elucidate their exact role in oxidase biogenesis. Expression in E. coli was chosen for the fact that this bacterium neither carries a Surf1 homolog nor provides a heme a-synthesizing machinery and therefore allows a clear-cut analysis of potential interactions between these components. Heme a is synthesized from heme b in two steps. First, heme b is converted into heme o via farnesylation, which is catalyzed by the heme o synthase CtaB (29Mogi T. Saiki K. Anraku Y. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The second step is catalyzed by heme a synthase CtaA not encoded in the E. coli genome. This latter reaction is oxygen-dependent because it involves conversion of a methyl group to a formyl group (29Mogi T. Saiki K. Anraku Y. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Because the endogenous E. coli CtaB homolog CyoE may not interact with the Paracoccus CtaA, both Paracoccus enzymes CtaA and CtaB were expressed heterologously under high aeration (see “Experimental Procedures”), and heme a content of the E. coli cells was verified by pyridine redox spectra. In contrast to E. coli C41(DE3) cells or strains that expressed Surf1c or Surf1q alone, strains containing Paracoccus CtaA and CtaB in trans exhibited the characteristic heme a peak at 587 nm. Thus, the Paracoccus enzymes CtaA and CtaB were expressed in a functional state, enabling these E. coli strains to synthesize heme a. Paracoccus Surf1 proteins were inducibly expressed in E. coli either in the absence or presence of constitutively expressed Paracoccus CtaA and CtaB. Both Surf1 proteins were incorporated into the E. coli cytoplasmic membrane as verified by cell fractionation and Western blot analysis. Membranes were solubilized, and the recombinant Surf1 proteins were purified by affinity chromatography via their N-terminal His10 tag; as shown previously, the tag does not interfere with Surf1 function (15Bundschuh F.A. Hoffmeier K. Ludwig B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1777: 1336-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The resulting preparations contained no major impurities (Fig. 1A), and both proteins were produced with final yields between 1 and 2 mg of purified protein/liter of medium. After expression in the absence of the heme a biosynthesis machinery, colorless preparations of Surf1 were obtained. However, when expressed in the presence of CtaA and CtaB, Surf1 displayed a greenish-brown color. Heme and protein staining after electrophoresis in semidenaturing gels (Fig. 1B) showed that heme was associated with both Surf1c and Surf1q and was lost after the addition of SDS. Pyridine redox spectra demonstrated that purified Surf1c contained heme a, which was identified by a prominent peak at 587 nm (Fig. 2A). In addition, a minor peak at 552 nm was observed, which corresponds to heme o as verified by HPLC. In native redox spectra (Fig. 2C), the absorption maximum in the α region was at 595 nm for heme a, whereas heme o appeared as a shoulder around 560 nm. The molar heme a/protein ratio was 0.17 ± 0.05 (mean ± S.D. from four independent preparations). Pyridine redox spectra of purified Surf1c confirmed the consistent lack of heme a in protein preparations that were expressed in the absence of CtaA and CtaB (Fig. 2A). Likewise, when expressed in the presence of CtaA and CtaB, Surf1q contained heme a, as indicated by a prominent peak at 587 nm under denaturing conditions (Fig. 2B), in addition to an absorption peak at around 552 nm identified as heme o by HPLC. In native redox spectra (Fig. 2C), the absorption maximum of the detected heme a in the α region was at 600 nm, and the heme o peak appeared as a shoulder at 560 nm. The heme a/protein ratio was 0.09 ± 0.03 (mean ± S.D. from three independent preparations), only about half the value obtained for Surf1c. Spectra of Surf1q preparations expressed in the absence of CtaA and CtaB lacked a heme a signal, and only traces of heme o were detected (Fig. 2B). Sequence alignments of a number of Surf1 homologs from different species show several conserved amino acid residues, most of which are clustered around the periplasmic sides of the two predicted transmembrane helices (15Bundschuh F.A. Hoffmeier K. Ludwig B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1777: 1336-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To address the question of which residues of the protein are involved in heme a binding, we focused on a highly conserved histidine in the C-terminal helix and exchanged it for an alanine (Surf1c H193A and Surf1q H202A). The two mutant proteins were expressed in the presence of CtaA and CtaB and purified like their wild-type counterparts with similar expression rates and yields. Prior to purification, the cell cultures expressing the Surf1 mutants tested positive for functional heme a synthesis. After purification, heme staining (Fig. 1B) and spectral analysis (Fig. 2) demonstrated a lack of heme a in either variant, and only traces of heme o were detected in the Surf1c mutant protein. The complete absence of heme a indicated that the conserved histidine residue is required for heme a binding of Surf1. A heme a solution was titrated with either apo-Surf1c or apo-Surf1q, i.e. Surf1 proteins that had been expressed in the absence of CtaA and CtaB. The titration led to a distinct spectral red shift of the heme signal, most noticeable in its oxidized form, from 412 to 419 nm (Fig. 3). This shift was assigned to the specific binding of heme a to Surf1c and Surf1q because spectra of both Surf1 expressed in the presence of CtaA and CtaB also exhibited an absorption maximum at 419 nm in their oxidized state. However, this spectral shift did not occur with either of the histidine mutants of Surf1, suggesting that this side chain is indeed required to ligand the heme a metal ion (Fig. 3). The in vitro binding of heme a to apo-Surf1c and apo-Surf1q was quantified using ITC. All titrations yielded a binding stoichiometry near unity (Fig. 4 and Table 1). For heme binding to the wild-type proteins, submicromolar affinities were measured, with Surf1c (Kd = 303 nm) showing a higher affinity compared with Surf1q (Kd = 650 nm). Binding was strongly exothermic with an entropic cost. Remarkably, Surf1c exhibited a negative ΔH value approximately twice as large as observed for Surf1q (−21.1 versus −11.6 kcal/mol). This suggests that the superior heme a-binding affinity of Surf1c may be due to additional polar interactions that are reflected by the strongly increased binding enthalpy (30Holdgate G.A. BioTechniques. 2001; 31 (168–170): 164-166PubMed Google Scholar). Alanine substitution of the conserved histidine residue (see above) affected heme a binding, especially in the case of Surf1c (Fig. 4B). Here, binding affinity was reduced by a factor of ∼11; for Surf1q, affinity was decreased by a factor of ∼3. For Surf1c H193A, a strongly altered binding enthalpy was observed (−10.5 versus −21.1 kcal/mol for the wild type), which was in the same range as ΔH observed for the Surf1q protein. By contrast, the Surf1q H202A variant showed only minor changes in the thermodynamic profile relative to wild-type Surf1q. These observations suggest that the conserved histidine residue plays a more stringent role in heme a binding in the case of Surf1c. The strong change in ΔH for the H193A variant of Surf1c relative to the wild type can be tentatively explained by the loss of polar interactions of the heme ligand with the histidine residue. Defects in the biogenesis pathway of COX are frequently associated with severe respiratory deficiencies. Mitochondrial COX is a multisubunit respiratory chain complex, and correct assembly of SU and redox centers is crucial for its function. More than 30 proteins are involved in the biogenesis of COX in eukaryotes, whereas only five assembly proteins are found in bacteria, all of the latter possibly involved in cofactor delivery (31Greiner P. Hannappel A. Werner C. Ludwig B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1777: 904-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). One of them is Surf1, which has been associated with LS, a fatal neurodegenerative disorder in humans. In this study, we have focused on the characterization of the two homologous Surf1 proteins of Paracoccus, Surf1c and Surf1q, to gain insight into their role in oxidase assembly. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate purified Surf1 proteins in detail. Contrary to concepts ranging from stabilizing mature SU I to an involvement in copper homeostasis (32Barrientos A. Gouget K. Horn D. Soto I.C. Fontanesi F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1793: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 33Stiburek L. Vesela K. Hansikova H. Hulkova H. Zeman J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2009; 296: C1218-C1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), both proteins were found to bind heme a at an equimolar ratio and with submicromolar affinities. Heme-binding affinities of a bacterial heme uptake machinery were reported to be in the same range (34Izadi-Pruneyre N. Huché F. Lukat-Rodgers G.S. Lecroisey A. Gilli R. Rodgers K.R. Wandersman C. Delepelaire P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 25541-25550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 35Krieg S. Huché F. Diederichs K. Izadi-Pruneyre N. Lecroisey A. Wandersman C. Delepelaire P. Welte W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 1045-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the affinity of Surf1c for heme a is about twice as large as that of Surf1q (303 versus 650 nm). COX binds two heme a molecules, whereas the quinol oxidase accommodates one heme b and one heme a. Therefore, more heme a is needed for the assembly of COX. As Surf1c and Surf1q specifically supply heme a to their corresponding oxidases (15Bundschuh F.A. Hoffmeier K. Ludwig B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1777: 1336-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), we envisage this difference in heme a affinity as a potential regulatory mechanism to ensure proper heme a distribution between the two oxidases. The two Surf1 proteins seem to provide slightly different binding sites for heme a, which is reflected both by the different absorption maxima in the α region of redox spectra (595 nm for Surf1c versus 600 nm for Surf1q; see Fig. 2C) and by the difference in ΔH values for the heme binding (−21.1 kcal/mol for Surf1c versus −11.6 kcal/mol for Surf1q). In addition, the substitution of the conserved histidine has a much stronger effect on heme binding for Surf1c than for Surf1q. We used E. coli as a heterologous host and introduced the heme a biosynthesis machinery derived from Paracoccus CtaA (heme a synthase; COX15 in eukaryotes) and CtaB (heme o synthase; COX10 in eukaryotes). The in vivo level of heme binding of heterologously expressed Surf1 proteins in the presence of CtaA and CtaB changed with growth conditions. Aeration had an especially strong influence on heme content, which is easily explained by the oxygen dependence of CtaA (see above). Therefore, heme content varied with different preparations, although never reaching a 1:1 heme/protein ratio. In our experimental system, CtaA and CtaB were expressed constitutively in contrast to the inducible overexpression of the Surf1 proteins, and it may be assumed that heme a synthase activity could not keep up with Surf1 expression rate. In this context, the observed heme o binding to the Surf1 proteins is probably unspecific and caused primarily by the abundance of heme o in the E. coli host, where heme o is required for the bo3-type terminal oxidase. Preliminary experiments with both Surf1 proteins isolated from Paracoccus show that they exclusively bind heme a as ligand in the native host. This is possibly due to the low levels of the heme o intermediate in Paracoccus (36de Gier J.W. Lübben M. Reijnders W.N. Tipker C.A. Slotboom D.J. van Spanning R.J. Stouthamer A.H. van der Oost J. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 183-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). It is generally agreed that heme a does not occur in a protein-free form in the membrane because it is detrimental to the cell (37Mense S.M. Zhang L. Cell Res. 2006; 16: 681-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Therefore, in eukaryotes, a direct heme a transfer from COX15 to COX SU I was assumed. COX15 activity and expression were found to be highly regulated in yeast, especially by heme b, which is not only a precursor of heme a but also the cofactor of heme a synthase (38Wang Z. Wang Y. Hegg E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 839-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In the same study, it was proposed that heme a liberation from COX15 could be regulated by SU I or by COX assembly intermediates because this would prevent uncontrolled release of potentially toxic heme a. Our present data strongly suggest that Surf1 interacts with heme a synthase and may provide a heme a pool function, which directs heme a flux from heme a synthase to its final target SU I. As proposed in Fig. 5, membrane-integral Surf1 interacts with heme a synthase to take over the heme a product from its active site and then dissociates from the enzyme to allow continuation of heme a synthesis. Surf1 is suggested to interact directly with COX SU I to eventually transfer both heme groups present in the mature form of the enzyme. At the moment, we can only speculate on the mechanism of heme a insertion into SU I. Studies on heme incorporation into four-helix bundles mimicking oxidase structure resulted in heme a-binding affinities in the low nanomolar Kd range (39Gibney B.R. Isogai Y. Rabanal F. Reddy K.S. Grosset A.M. Moser C.C. Dutton P.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11041-11049Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar); this high affinity would readily allow transfer of heme a because Surf1 binds heme a only with high nanomolar Kd values. We propose that heme a is inserted into SU I in a co-translational manner (Fig. 5). The 12-transmembrane helix bundle structure of SU I appears as a fairly rigid scaffold that, once folded, may not allow access to the rather bulky heme a moiety, as much as the fully assembled oxidase complex hardly loses either of its heme groups, not even on prolonged and excessive purification procedures. The yeast homolog of Surf1, Shy1p, has been found to interact with Mss51p and Cox14p, two mitochondrial COX assembly factors involved in the regulation of SU I expression (40Barrientos A. Zambrano A. Tzagoloff A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3472-3482Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 41Perez-Martinez X. Broadley S.A. Fox T.D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5951-5961Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). For the yeast system, it was suggested that Shy1p acts downstream of Mss51p and Cox14p, taking over and stabilizing fully assembled SU I, and thus allows its association with additional SU and assembly factors (42Pierrel F. Bestwick M.L. Cobine P.A. Khalimonchuk O. Cricco J.A. Winge D.R. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 4335-4346Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and later the bc1 complex to form supercomplexes (43Mick D.U. Wagner K. van der Laan M. Frazier A.E. Perschil I. Pawlas M. Meyer H.E. Warscheid B. Rehling P. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 4347-4358Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, Mss51p and Cox14p are only found in fungi and lack counterparts both in higher eukaryotes and in bacteria; moreover, compared with other Surf1 homologs, Shy1p has a large additional loop not conserved in Surf1 proteins of other species. Because heme a incorporation into SU I is likely to occur co-translationally, an interaction of Shy1p with the translation machinery for SU I in yeast does not contradict its proposed role in heme incorporation. The observed association with SU I in later stages of the assembly process (13Nijtmans L.G. Artal Sanz M. Bucko M. Farhoud M.H. Feenstra M. Hakkaart G.A. Zeviani M. Grivell L.A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 46-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 42Pierrel F. Bestwick M.L. Cobine P.A. Khalimonchuk O. Cricco J.A. Winge D.R.

EMBO J. 2007; 26: 4347-4358Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) hints at an additional role of Shy1p. To summarize the possible functions of Surf1 in COX biogenesis, a 3-fold contribution to heme a insertion seems plausible. Surf1 (i) may modulate heme synthase activity by abstracting the product heme a from the active site of CtaA and thus allows continuing heme synthesis; (ii) avoids the presence and presumed detrimental action of free heme a in the membrane by providing a safe, yet readily available pool of this cofactor; and (iii) specifically chaperones heme a to its target sites in SU I of COX and positions the bulky cofactor for presumed co-translational insertion into both sites within the 12-transmembrane helix scaffold of COX SU I. The importance of Surf1 in COX biogenesis is exemplified by the fact that its absence leads to severe COX deficiency in humans, which causes neurodegenerative LS. The elucidation of the exact function of Surf1 may spur the development of a treatment for LS. Our findings both in vivo and in vitro that Surf1 is a heme a-binding protein strongly indicate that Surf1 is more likely involved in direct cofactor incorporation into COX SU I rather than merely being a regulatory protein.

https://openalex.org/W2085133990,"The olfactory bulb (OB) is a highly plastic region of the adult mammalian brain characterized by continuous integration of inhibitory interneurons of the granule (GC) and periglomerular cell (PGC) types. Adult-generated OB interneurons are selected to survive in an experience-dependent way but the mechanisms that mediate the effects of experience on OB neurogenesis are unknown. Here we focus on the new-generated PGC population which is composed by multiple subtypes. Using paradigms of olfactory enrichment and/or deprivation combined to BrdU injections and quantitative confocal immunohistochemical analyses, we studied the effects of olfactory experience on adult-generated PGCs at different survival time and compared PGC to GC modulation. We show that olfactory enrichment similarly influences PGCs and GCs, increasing survival of newborn cells and transiently modulating GAD67 and plasticity-related molecules expression. However, PGC maturation appears to be delayed compared to GCs, reflecting a different temporal dynamic of adult generated olfactory interneuron integration. Moreover, olfactory enrichment or deprivation do not selectively modulate the survival of specific PGC phenotypes, supporting the idea that the integration rate of distinct PGC subtypes is independent from olfactory experience."
https://openalex.org/W2016325597,"Introduction Disease-related stigma and knowledge are believed to be associated with patients' willingness to seek treatment and adherence to treatment. HIV-associated tuberculosis (TB) presents unique challenges, because TB and HIV are both medically complex and stigmatizing diseases. In Thailand, we assessed knowledge and beliefs about these diseases among HIV-infected TB patients. Methods We prospectively interviewed and examined HIV-infected TB patients from three provinces and one national referral hospital in Thailand from 2005–2006. At the beginning of TB treatment, we asked patients standardized questions about TB stigma, TB knowledge, and HIV knowledge. Responses were grouped into scores; scores equal to or greater than the median score of study population were considered high. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with scores. Results Of 769 patients enrolled, 500 (65%) reported high TB stigma, 177 (23%) low TB knowledge, and 379 (49%) low HIV knowledge. Patients reporting high TB stigma were more likely to have taken antibiotics before TB treatment, to have first visited a traditional healer or private provider, to not know that monogamy can reduce the risk of acquiring HIV infection, and to have been hospitalized at enrollment. Patients with low TB knowledge were more likely to have severe TB disease, to be hospitalized at enrollment, to be treated at the national infectious diseases referral hospital, and to have low HIV knowledge. Patients with low HIV knowledge were more likely to know a TB patient and to have low TB knowledge. Discussion We found that stigma and low disease-specific knowledge were common among HIV-infected TB patients and associated with similar factors. Further research is needed to determine whether reducing stigma and increasing TB and HIV knowledge among the general community and patients reduces diagnostic delay and improves patient outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W1990953109,"Here we addressed the role of intersectin-2L (ITSN-2L), a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the Rho GTPase Cdc42, in the mechanism of caveola endocytosis in endothelial cells (ECs). Immunoprecipitation and co-localization studies showed that ITSN-2L associates with members of the Cdc42-WASp-Arp2/3 actin polymerization pathway. Expression of Dbl homology-pleckstrin homology (DH-PH) region of ITSN-2L (DH-PHITSN-2L) induced specific activation of Cdc42, resulting in formation of extensive filopodia, enhanced cortical actin, as well as a shift from G-actin to F-actin. The “catalytically dead” DH-PH domain reversed these effects and induced significant stress fiber formation, without a detectable shift in actin pools. A biotin assay for caveola internalization indicated a significant decrease in the uptake of biotinylated proteins in DH-PHITSN-2L-transfected cells compared with control and 1 μm jasplakinolide-treated cells. ECs depleted of ITSN-2L by small interfering RNA, however, showed decreased Cdc42 activation and actin remodeling similar to the defective DH-PH, resulting in 62% increase in caveola-mediated uptake compared with controls. Thus, ITSN-2L, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Cdc42, regulates different steps of caveola endocytosis in ECs by controlling the temporal and spatial actin polymerization and remodeling sub-adjacent to the plasma membrane.

The polymerization of actin has a central role in clathrin- and caveola-mediated endocytosis (1Kaksonen M. Toret C.P. Drubin D.G. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Studies have shown a number of protein-protein interactions that suggest a functional relationship between the actin cytoskeleton and endocytic machinery; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.

Badour K. Hardy L.A. Kubiseski T.J. Zhang J. Siminovitch K.A. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 1777-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). ITSN-2L interaction with N-WASP in turn induces activation of N-WASP in a Cdc42-dependent manner (2McGavin M.K. Badour K. Hardy L.A. Kubiseski T.J. Zhang J. Siminovitch K.A. J. Exp.

In this way, ITSN-2L on the basis of its DH domain acts as a GEF for the small Rho GTPase Cdc42, similar to its neuronal counterpart ITSN-1L (2McGavin M.K. Badour K. Hardy L.A. Kubiseski T.J.

EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3494-3503Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The DH domain of ITSN-2L shows high sequence homology with the corresponding region of ITSN-1L (5Pucharcos C. Estivill X. de la Luna S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 478: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and it possesses all the amino acid residues required for its GEF enzymatic activity (6Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-F23Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Both long ITSN isoforms display immediately distal to the DH domain a PH domain, which may thereby modulate the intrinsic catalytic activity of the DH region (6Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-F23Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 7Liu X. Wang H. Eberstadt M. Schnuchel A. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Schkeryantz J.M. Janowick D.A.

Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the PH domain enhances up to 100-fold the DH catalytic activity for some Dbl proteins compared with that measured for DH alone in vitro, whereas for other Dbl proteins the presence of the PH domain negatively regulates GEF activity of the DH region (9Pruitt W.M. Karnoub A.E. Rakauskas A.C. Guipponi M. Antonarakis S.E. Kurakin A. Kay B.K. Sondek J. Siderovski D.P. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1640: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This latter function is apparently mediated by interactions with phosphoinositides (7Liu X. Wang H. Eberstadt M. Schnuchel A. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Schkeryantz J.M. Janowick D.A. Harlan J.E.

However, the PH sequence was shown to be dispensable for GEF activity of ITSN-2L in vitro, but it enhanced the ability to activate Cdc42 in vivo (9Pruitt W.M. Karnoub A.E. Rakauskas A.C. Guipponi M.

Despite high sequence conservation among Rho GTPases, long ITSN isoforms apparently induce selective activation of Cdc42 due to the overall increasing size of the specificity residues of the GTPases (Cdc42 < Rac1 < RhoA) and the inability of ITSN to accommodate in an analogous position the larger size amino acid chains found in Rac1 and RhoA (10Snyder J.T. Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Betts L. Pruitt W.M. Siderovski D.P. Der C.J. Sondek J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 468-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar).ITSN-2L, like its alternatively spliced short isoform, is widely expressed in human tissue, and it shows subcellular distribution similar to components of the endocytic machinery (5Pucharcos C. Estivill X. de la Luna S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 478: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In COS-7 cells overexpressing ITSN-2 isoforms, clathrin-mediated transferrin uptake was blocked, consistent with their involvement in the regulation of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (5Pucharcos C. Estivill X. de la Luna S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 478: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). By contrast, ITSN-2L overexpression in Jurkat cells stimulated T cell antigen receptor (TCR) internalization, whereas truncated ITSN-2L, deleted for the DH domain, caused significant inhibition of TCR internalization (2McGavin M.K. Badour K. Hardy L.A. Kubiseski T.J. Zhang J. Siminovitch K.A. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 1777-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The stimulatory effect of ITSN-2L on TCR endocytosis may be secondary to the ability of ITSN-2L to bind through its Src homology 3 domains the proline-rich domain of N-WASP followed by Cdc42-mediated actin polymerization (2McGavin M.K. Badour K. Hardy L.A. Kubiseski T.J. Zhang J. Siminovitch K.A. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 1777-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Although more work is needed to clarify these inconsistencies, both of these studies suggest that ITSN-2L may regulate endocytosis and function cooperatively with N-WASP and Cdc42 to link WASP-mediated actin polymerization to the endocytic machinery (2McGavin M.K. Badour K. Hardy L.A. Kubiseski T.J. Zhang J. Siminovitch K.A. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 1777-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar).Live cultured fibroblast imaging showed that actin polymerization as regulated by the WASP-Arp2/3 complex participates in the late stage of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (11Merrifield C.J. Qualmann B. Kessels M.M. Almers W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 83: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Therefore, we reasoned that ITSN-2L, as a specific activator of Cdc42, may be essential for actin cytoskeleton polymerization and caveola internalization in ECs. ECs are particularly rich in caveola, and caveola-mediated endocytosis is a fundamental step in mediating the transcytosis of proteins (12Tuma P.L. Hubbard A.L. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 871-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 13Palade G.E. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1953; 1: 188-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), but the mechanisms of caveola-mediated endocytosis and the essential proteins involved remain enigmatic. In this study, we addressed the role of ITSN-2L in the mechanism of caveola internalization in ECs. Our data employing morphological, biochemical, and functional approaches show that ITSN-2L on the basis of Cdc42-mediated spatial actin polymerization is required in the mechanism of caveola-mediated endocytosis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and TransfectionHuman lung microvascular ECs (Clonetics) were cultured with EGMTM-2 MV (Cambrex, Walkersville, MD). FuGENE HD transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) was used for Myc-His-tagged DH-PHITSN-2L and “catalytically dead” ITSN-2L-DH-PHΔΑΑ1339–1347(DH-PHΔ-(1339–1347)) transfection of ECs per the manufacturer's instructions. Preliminary experiments were carried out to establish optimized transfection and cell culture conditions. For specific silencing of ITSN-2L isoform, custom-generated Dharmacon SMARTpool siRNA reagents were used. The individual siGENOME duplex most efficient in knocking down ITSN-2L protein expression, GCACGGAUUCCUCUUCAAUUU (sense sequence) and 5′-PAUUGAAGAGGAAUCCGGCUU (antisense), was delivered using Dharmafect2 transfection reagent. RNase-free conditions were used throughout the silencing experiments. All controls for efficient transfection and to evaluate any off-target effects caused by ITSN-2L siRNA in ECs were performed as in Ref. 14Predescu S.A. Predescu D.N. Knezevic I. Klein I.K. Malik A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17166-17178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar. The Dharmacon siCONTROLTM functional, nontargeting siRNA sequence 1 (5′-UAGCGACUAAACACAUCAAUU-3′) and sequence 2 (5′-UAAGGCUAUGAAGAGAUACUU-3′) were used as controls for secondary effects caused by ITSN-2L siRNA transfection. These two controls interact with the RNA-induced silencing complex but lack sufficient homology with any known human gene to effectively induce mRNA knockdown. siGlo cyclophilin B siRNA, a silencer with a fluorescent modification, was used to monitor transfection efficiency.Generation of DNA ConstructsMyc-His-ITSN-2L-DH-PH ConstructFull-length human ITSN-2L cDNA was used as a template for PCR with DNA polymerase Pfu (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to generate C-terminal Myc-His-tagged DH-PH domain (residues 1212–1534). ITSN-2L cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. Suzana de la Luna (Medical and Molecular Genetics Center, IRO, Barcelona, Spain). Primer pair ITSN2L-DH-F, 5′-AGTAGAATTCGCCACCATGGCATATATTCATGAGCTGATTCAGAC-3′, and ITSN2L-DH-R, 5′-ACTTATCTAGACTCAGACGCCGCCTTGATCTTC-3′, were used to generate the DH-PH domain of ITSN-2L that lacks the stop codon. The PCR cycling conditions were as follows: initial denaturation 98 °C for 30 s, 30 cycles of denaturation, annealing, and extension; 94 °C for 3 min, 25 cycles of denaturation, annealing, and extension; 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min 15 s, followed by final extension 72 °C for 7 min. The resulting PCR fragment was digested with restriction enzymes EcoRI and XbaI (Invitrogen) and subcloned into the EcoRI-XbaI restriction sites of pcDNA6/Myc-His A (Invitrogen), resulting in the construct pcDNA6A-ITSN2L-DH-PH, which was verified for sequence integrity through DNA sequencing.Myc-His-ITSN-2L-DH-PH-ΔAA1339–1347 Construct (DH- PHΔ-(1339–1347))Full-length human ITSN-2 cDNA was used as a template for PCR with High Fidelity DNA polymerase Phusion (Finnzymes Oy, Espoo, Finland) to generate C-terminal Myc-His-tagged DH-PH domain (residues 1212–1534) with residues 1339–1347 deleted. The deleted residues corresponded to the following amino acid sequence “GMPLSSFLL.” To delete this region, a two-step PCR method was used. In the first step, two separate reactions with primer pairs ITSN2L-DH-F and ITSN2L-del AA1339–47-R or ITSN2L-del AA1339–47-F and ITSN2L-DH-R were used to generate PCR fragments that flanked the deleted region. The primers used contained overlapping sequence that flanked the deleted residues. The resulting PCR fragments were analyzed by gel, purified, and used as overlapping DNA templates for the 2nd PCR step with primers ITSN2L-DH-F and ITSN2L-DH-R. The sequence of the primer pair that flanked the deleted region were as follows: ITSN2L-del AA1339–47-F, 5′-CGGTGTAAA|AAACCCATGCAGAGGATCAC-3′, and ITSN2L-del AA1339–47-R, 5′-CATGGGTTT|TTTACACCGCGGGTCAGATGCCAG-3′ (the line between the base pairs in the primers indicates the deleted region). The PCR cycling conditions were as follows: initial denaturation 98 °C for 30 s, 30 cycles of denaturation, annealing, and extension; 98 °C for 10 s, 67 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 15 s, followed by a final extension 72 °C for 10 min. The final PCR product, which lacked the stop codon, was digested with EcoRI and XbaI (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) and ligated into the EcoRI and XbaI sites of pcDNA6/Myc-His A (Invitrogen), resulting in the construct pcDNA6A-ITSN2L-DH-PH-ΔAA1339–1347, which was verified for sequence integrity through DNA sequencing. Cytomegalovirus-driven dominant active Cdc42 (V12) was a gift from Dr. Tatyana Voyno-Yasenetskaya (University of Illinois, Chicago).RT-PCRRNA was isolated from mouse lung or cultured ECs using the RNeasy mini RNA isolation kit (Qiagen). RT-PCR was performed using ThermoScript Two-step RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen).ImmunoprecipitationCells were lysed in 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 1.5% Triton X-100, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) for 1 h and 30 min at room temperature. Protein content was determined using MicroBCA assay (Pierce). 500 μg of total protein were then incubated with 2 μg of a control nonspecific IgG, ITSN-2L or N-WASP pAb (Cytoskeleton, Denver, CO), for 1 h at 4 °C. 40 μl of protein A/G bead slurry were then added, and the mixtures were incubated end-over-end at 4 °C overnight. The bound proteins were resolved on 5–20% SDS-PAGE. For identifying the immunoprecipitated proteins by Western blotting, primary Abs were used in conjunction with the appropriate IgG TrueBlot horseradish peroxidase-conjugated reporters (EBioscience, San Diego), designed for detection of the immunoblotted target proteins without detection of light and heavy chains of the immunoprecipitating immunoglobulin.ImmunofluorescenceECs grown on glass coverslips or PM patches were immunostained as in Ref. 15Predescu S.A.

For phalloidin Alexa Fluor 488 staining, control or transfected cells were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min at room temperature, permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min on ice, and stained with 25 μg/ml phalloidin Alexa Fluor 488 for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were mounted with Prolong Antifade reagent (Molecular Probes). Images were acquired on a Zeiss Axioplan2 with Neofluor 100× objective (1.3 N.A.), using the AxioCam with AxioVision 4.6 software.Actin Polymerization AssayAnalysis of actin polymerization was performed as in Ref. 16Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B.

Briefly, ECs were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, scraped, and collected into 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes. Cell pellets were then resuspended in 100 μl of Lysis Buffer I (20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 1× protease inhibitors) for 1 h and then centrifuged for 20 min at 10,000 × g. Supernatants were saved as the G-actin fractions, and the pellets were resuspended in Lysis Buffer II (15 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 0.15 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, protease inhibitors) for 1 h. The mixtures were then centrifuged at 45,000 rpm in a Beckman OptimaTM TLX ultracentrifuge for 40 min. The ensuing supernatants represented the F-actin fractions. Equal protein amounts were loaded onto 4–12% SDS-PAGE. Actin was detected by immunoblotting with anti-actin Ab (Cytoskeleton) and quantified by densitometry using ImageJ1.37v software.Cdc42/Rac1/RhoA Activation AssayAssays were performed as instructed using Cdc42 activation assay biochem kit (Cytoskeleton, Denver, CO). Briefly, cells were scraped with ice-cold lysis buffer and centrifuged to remove cell debris. Cell lysates were then incubated with 20 ml of PAK-GST beads for Cdc42/Rac or 50 ml of Rhotekin-GST beads for Rho for 90 min at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times with wash buffer. Beads were boiled for 5 min in 20 μl of Laemmli buffer; samples were run in parallel with total cell lysate and immunoblotted with Abs to the appropriate small GTPase. Activation of Cdc42, Rac1, and RhoA in control and transfected cells was determined by densitometry, with total lysate used to normalize the total amount of small GTPase protein.DISCUSSIONTo investigate the functional importance of ITSN-2L in caveola endocytosis, we first analyzed the morphological and functional effects of DH-PHITSN-2L expression in ECs, a common approach to assess the function of multimodular proteins (22Tong X.K. Hussain N.K. de Heuvel E. Kurakin A. Abi-Jaoude E. Quinn C.C. Olson M.F. Marais R. Baranes D. Kay B.K. McPherson P.S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1263-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 23Schafer D.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 76-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The approach allowed us to investigate the effects exclusively ascribed to the DH-PH domain, thus eliminating the possible influence or regulatory effects of the neighboring sequences. Under conditions of adequate expression and subcellular localization, the DH-PH fragment promoted specific activation of Cdc42 and augmented actin polymerization. The DH-PHITSN-2L-transfected cells displayed a wider peripheral actin band, numerous filopodia-like structures, and disruption of IEJs. Moreover, the trafficking of caveolae is inhibited indicating that the wider and perhaps the denser cortical network of actin functions as a molecular barrier, preventing the inward movement of caveolae. The transport of caveolae away from the PM may require changes in F-actin, with local actin remodeling and possibly depolymerization to facilitate caveola movement. Consistent with this idea, stabilization of actin filaments by treatment of ECs with Jasp, a cyclic peptide that binds to and stabilizes filamentous actin in vitro and enhances actin polymerization in vivo (27Sun X. Whittaker G.R. Cell. Microbiol. 2007; 9: 1672-1682Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), may explain the observed inhibition of caveola internalization. Furthermore, because the PM of all cells is linked to an underlying actin cytoskeleton, augmented actin polymerization at this level may cause increased rigidity of the PM that may affect caveola formation. These observations strongly suggest that actin polymerization processes must be the subject of an especially fine temporal and spatial coordination to facilitate caveola endocytosis.We also show that siRNA-mediated ITSN-2L knockdown causes a significant decrease in Cdc42 activation that coincides with significant remodeling of actin cytoskeletal organization. Interestingly, disorganization of the dense peripheral actin band triggered the increase of caveola internalization. ITSN-2L deficiency removed the cortical actin network assumed to control caveola trafficking, and thus led to the recorded up-regulation of caveola internalization. Moreover, ITSN-2L deficiency may cause weakening of the PM-associated actin cytoskeleton and less membrane rigidity favoring caveola formation. These results suggest that in ECs ITSN-2L is required for the organization of cortical actin as peripheral dense band and actin membrane cytoskeleton. Interestingly, the catalytically dead DH-PH domain, which compromised significantly activation of Cdc42 in DH-PHΔ-(1339–1347)-transfected cells, caused a dramatic shift of F-actin pools from cortical actin band to stress fibers. The disorganization of cortical actin network correlated with abundant and thicker stress fibers, and no shift between F-actin and G-actin strongly suggests that ITSN-2L, as a GEF for Cdc42, may control the cellular distribution and architectural organization of actin filaments in different subcellular scaffolds. Whereas the effect of ITSN-2L siRNA likely reflected a selective cytoskeletal action, it would have been too naive to consider that the ITSN-2L deficiency would be limited to cytoskeletal modification. ITSN-2L, similar to its neuronal counterpart, may bind a plethora of regulatory molecules, interactions that may affect the efficacy of caveola internalization. ITSN-2L may bind dynamin that interacts with the actin machinery via cortactin and syndapin (28Merrifield C.J. Perrais D. Zenisek D. Cell. 2005; 121: 593-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 29Kessels M.M. Qualmann B. J.

Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 807-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Both dynamin and N-WASP interact via their proline-rich domains with subsets of the Src homology 3 domains of ITSN-2L (2McGavin M.K. Badour K. Hardy L.A. Kubiseski T.J. Zhang J. Siminovitch K.A. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 1777-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), an observation that raises the possibility of competitive binding and thereby, the possibility of ITSN-2L as a molecular control for both caveola endocytic function and actin polymerization. Alternatively, ITSN-2L may hetero-oligomerize via the central coiled-coil region with the other two endothelial ITSN isoforms and work synergistically by controlling the recruitment of dynamin at the neck region of caveolae. Because ITSN isoforms and their splice variants have a distinct expression pattern (5Pucharcos C. Estivill X. de la Luna S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 478: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 17Pucharcos C. Casas C. Nadal M. Estivill X. de la Luna S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1521: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), they may also play isoform-specific functions, which are still to be determined.We conclude that changes in actin polymerization, as regulated by experimental manipulation of ITSN-2L protein expression, may compromise caveola endocytosis, indicating that efficient caveola endocytosis requires a finely tuned coupling of caveola endocytic function and actin polymerization machinery. ITSN-2L is a universally expressed GEF for Cdc42 and displays some distinctiveness that makes it an ideal candidate to functionally link Cdc42 activation and subsequent actin polymerization to caveola endocytosis. The polymerization of actin has a central role in clathrin- and caveola-mediated endocytosis (1Kaksonen M. Toret C.P. Drubin D.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 404-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Studies have shown a number of protein-protein interactions that suggest a functional relationship between the actin cytoskeleton and endocytic machinery; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.

Badour K. Hardy L.A. Kubiseski T.J. Zhang J. Siminovitch K.A. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 1777-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). ITSN-2L interaction with N-WASP in turn induces activation of N-WASP in a Cdc42-dependent manner (2McGavin M.K. Badour K. Hardy L.A. Kubiseski T.J. Zhang J. Siminovitch K.A. J. Exp.

In this way, ITSN-2L on the basis of its DH domain acts as a GEF for the small Rho GTPase Cdc42, similar to its neuronal counterpart ITSN-1L (2McGavin M.K. Badour K. Hardy L.A. Kubiseski T.J.

https://openalex.org/W2058437633,"Filamins are actin filament cross-linking proteins composed of an N-terminal actin-binding domain and 24 immunoglobulin-like domains (IgFLNs). Filamins interact with numerous proteins, including the cytoplasmic domains of plasma membrane signaling and cell adhesion receptors. Thereby filamins mechanically and functionally link the cell membrane to the cytoskeleton. Most of the interactions have been mapped to the C-terminal IgFLNs 16-24. Similarly, as with the previously known compact domain pair of IgFLNa20-21, the two-domain fragments IgFLNa16-17 and IgFLNa18-19 were more compact in small angle x-ray scattering analysis than would be expected for two independent domains. Solution state NMR structures revealed that the domain packing in IgFLNa18-19 resembles the structure of IgFLNa20-21. In both domain pairs the integrin-binding site is masked, although the details of the domain-domain interaction are partly distinct. The structure of IgFLNa16-17 revealed a new domain packing mode where the adhesion receptor binding site of domain 17 is not masked. Sequence comparison suggests that similar packing of three tandem filamin domain pairs is present throughout the animal kingdom, and we propose that this packing is involved in the regulation of filamin interactions through a mechanosensor mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W2118510029,"Amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) has a central role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cellular cholesterol homeostasis regulates endoproteo- lytic generation of Aβ from the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Previous studies have identified acyl- coenzyme A: cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT)’ an enzyme that regulates subcellular cholesterol distribu-tion, as a potential therapeutic target for AD. Inhibition of ACAT activity decreases Aβ generation in cell- and animal-based models of AD through an unknown mechanism. Here we show that ACAT inhibition retains a fraction of APP molecules in the early secretory pathway, limiting the availability of APP for secretase- mediated proteolytic processing. ACAT inhibitors delayed the trafficking of immature APP molecules from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as shown by metabolic labeling and live-cell imaging. This resulted in partial ER retention of APP and enhanced ER-associated deg-radation of APP by the proteasome, without activation of the unfolded protein response pathway. The ratio of mature APP to immature APP was reduced in brains of mice treated with ACAT inhibitors’ and strongly correlated with reduced brain APP-C99 and cerebrospinal fluid Aβ levels in individual animals. Our results identify a novel ACAT-dependent mechanism that regulates secretory trafficking of APP, likely contributing to decreased Aβ generation in vivo.—Huttunen, H.

Although the mechanisms controlling extracellularly induced protein synthesis are becoming clear, less is understood about the molecular networks that regulate the basal translation rate. Here we describe the effects of chronic treatment with various neurotrophic factors and cytokines on the basal rate of protein synthesis in primary cortical neurons. Among the examined factors, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) showed the strongest effect. The rate of protein synthesis increased in the cortical tissues of BDNF transgenic mice, whereas it decreased in BDNF knock-out mice. BDNF specifically increased the level of the active, unphosphorylated form of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2). The levels of active eEF2 increased and decreased in BDNF transgenic and BDNF knock-out mice, respectively. BDNF decreased kinase activity and increased phosphatase activity against eEF2 in vitro. Additionally, BDNF shortened the ribosomal transit time, an index of translation elongation. In agreement with these results, overexpression of eEF2 enhanced protein synthesis. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the increased level of active eEF2 induced by chronic BDNF stimulation enhances translational elongation processes and increases the total rate of protein synthesis in neurons.

These observations indicate that endogenous molecules can acutely modulate neuronal translation in response to neural activity. Translation of an mRNA molecule comprises three steps: initiation, elongation, and release (or termination) (13Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression.in: Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 719-740Google Scholar). In the first step, mRNA and methionyl-tRNAiMet are recruited to a ribosome. During elongation, aminoacyl-tRNAs are sequentially recruited and the nascent peptide chain lengthens incrementally as amino acids are covalently attached via peptide bonds. Finally, the polypeptide chain is released from the ribosome. Each step is regulated by a variety of factors. The activities of these regulatory proteins are predominantly controlled by phosphorylation and GTP binding. BDNF activates both initiation and elongation by modulating these processes (8Takei N.

In addition to these acute, stimulation-induced changes in the translation rate, the long term regulation of translation plays important roles in developing and mature brains. In fact, recent studies have shown that genetic disruption or overexpression of translation factors or modulator genes alters synaptic plasticity and behavior as well as the basal rate of protein synthesis. Mice lacking the gene encoding GCN2, a kinase that phosphorylates eIF2α, exhibited enhanced translation as well as aberrant long term potentiation and spatial learning (16Costa-Mattioli M. Gobert D.

Thus, modifying the rate of protein synthesis can produce deleterious effects on synaptic plasticity and brain function. Although genetic modifications can affect translation, the mechanisms by which the basal translation rate is controlled in normal neurons are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that chronic treatment of primary cortical neurons with BDNF increases the level of active, unphosphorylated eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) and enhances the rates of elongation and protein synthesis. Analysis of BDNF mutant mice supports a role for this neurotrophin in regulating the basal rate of protein synthesis. BDNF was a generous gift from Sumitomo Pharmaceutical Co.

Cortical neurons were incubated with 10 μCi of [35S]methionine and growth factors for 30 min. Protein synthesis was measured by [35S]methionine incorporation as previously reported (8Takei N. Kawamura M. Hara K. Yonezawa K. Nawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42818-42825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Tissue samples were homogenized in 10 volumes of DMEM and centrifuged to remove the nuclei. The resulting supernatants were incubated with [35S]methionine and incorporation into protein was measured as described previously (14Takei N. Inamura N. Kawamura M. Namba H. Hara K. Yonezawa K. Nawa H. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 9760-9769Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The levels of free methionine and methionine that had been incorporated into proteins were estimated by counting the radioactivity in the supernatant and the pellet, respectively. We then calculated the ratio of [35S]methionine that precipitated to the total [35S]methionine taken up into the neurons. Neurons were incubated with [35S]methionine for 1 h in methionine-free DMEM at 4 days in culture. To analyze the degradation rate, cultures were washed three times with normal DMEM and incubated a further 5 h in 10% fetal bovine serum-containing DMEM. Samples from 1 and 6 h after labeling were immunoprecipitated with anti-eEF2 antibody. Resultant immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiograms were taken. Ribosomal transit times were measured as described previously (15Inamura N. Nawa H. Takei N. J. Neurochem. 2005; 95: 1438-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Neurons were cultured without or with BDNF (50 ng/ml) and incubated with 3 μCi of [35S]methionine. At 1, 5, 15, and 20 min after the addition of the radiolabeled methionine, neurons were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 1 ml of extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 100 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml cycloheximide, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% Triton X-100, and complete protease inhibitor mixture (CompleteTM, Roche)). After pelleting the nuclei by centrifugation, the supernatant was aliquoted to measure the “completed” peptide chains and the “total” amount of newly synthesized (completed + ribosome-bound peptide chains) proteins. Lysate (0.5 ml) was layered onto 1 ml of extraction buffer lacking detergent and containing 0.8 m sucrose. Polysomes were pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 2.5 h. Samples of postribosomal supernatant (1.2 ml) were collected to measure the incorporation of [35S]methionine into completed proteins. Newly synthesized proteins representing the completed and ribosome-bound elongating peptide chains were measured by determining the incorporation of [35S]methionine into the postnuclear supernatant. The transit time was determined as the difference in the positions of the intercepts on the time axis of the lines for the total and completed polypeptide chains. This difference between the intercepts is equivalent to half of the ribosomal transit time (24Nielsen P.J. McConkey E.H. J. Cell Physiol. 1980; 104: 269-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The kinase activity of eEF2K was measured as previously described (15Inamura N. Nawa H. Takei N. J. Neurochem. 2005; 95: 1438-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) with immunopurified unphosphorylated eEF2 as a substrate. The rat brain homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min and the resulting supernatant was absorbed with protein G and anti-phospho-eEF2 antibody. Then, the supernatant was applied to a column containing anti-eEF2 antibody bound to an Affi-Gel HzTM (Bio-Rad). eEF2 was eluted with Immunopure Ag/Ab gentle elution buffer (Pierce), dialyzed, and examined by SDS-PAGE. The phosphatase activity of PP2A was measured using a PP2A assay kit (Upstate). Lysates from control and BDNF-treated neurons were incubated with anti-PP2A subunit C antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. Protein G-Sepharose was added and the samples were incubated for another 1 h. PP2A phosphatase activity in these immunoprecipitates was then assayed according to the manufacturer's protocol. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were performed as described previously (14Takei N. Inamura N. Kawamura M. Namba H. Hara K. Yonezawa K. Nawa H. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 9760-9769Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Cells or tissues were lysed and sonicated in sample buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 2% SDS, 20 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, and complete mini protease inhibitors, pH 7.5). After centrifugation, the supernatant was collected and protein concentrations were determined. Equal amounts of protein (25–40 μg/lane) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were incubated with primary antibodies and then with horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies (Cappel; dilution, 1:2000). Peroxidase activity was visualized on x-ray film after being treated with chemiluminescence reagents (Western Lightning, PerkinElmer Life Science). Immunocytochemistry using anti-eEF2 and anti-phospho-eEF2 antibodies was performed essentially as described previously (25Inamura N. Hoshino S. Uchiumi T. Nawa H. Takei N. Mol. Brain Res. 2003; 111: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). RNA extraction and RT-PCR were performed as previously described (26Seki M. Nawa H. Fukuchi T. Abe H. Takei N. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 3211-3218Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Total RNA (100 ng) was amplified using the RT-PCR High Plus Kit (TOYOBO, Japan) with specific primers for rat eEF2 (forward, 5′-cgcttctatgccttcggtag-3′, reverse, 5′-gcagcatcaccagacttcaa-3′). RT-PCR amplification was performed on the Gene Amp PCR system 9700 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using initial incubations for 30 min at 60 °C and then for 2 min at 94 °C followed by 30 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C and 1.5 min at 60 °C. A final 7-min incubation at 62 °C facilitated terminal extension. PCR products were separated by 3% agarose gel electrophoresis and stained with ethidium bromide. Further quantitative assessment of mRNA levels was carried out with a real time PCR machine (Light Cycler, Roche Diagnostics) (27Namba H. Nagano T. Iwakura Y. Xiong H. Jourdi H. Takei N. Nawa H. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2006; 31: 628-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Total RNA (100 ng) was subjected to RT-PCR amplification (60°C for 10 min, 94°C for 2 s, 30 cycles of 94 °C; 60 °C for 15 s for eEF2, and 60°C for 10 min, 94°C for 2 s; 30 cycles of 94 °C, 55°C for 5 s, and 72°C for 10 s for β-actin) in a final volume of 25 μl using RT-PCR high plus (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan), containing of 1/20,000 SYBR Green I (Molecular Probes) and 5 pmol of primers. Relative amounts of mRNA of eEF2 were calculated by the differences of cycles during linear amplification, and normalized to the relative expression of β-actin mRNA (forward, 5′-gagcgtggctacagcttca-3′, and reverse, 5′-gaaccgctcattgccgatagtgatg-3′). The rate of protein synthesis in primary cortical neurons was examined after chronic treatment with various neurotrophic factors and cytokines. Neurons were treated daily for 5 days and [35S]methionine incorporation into newly synthesized proteins was measured. Among the factors tested, the neurotrophins and insulin enhanced the rate of protein synthesis (Fig. 1). Because the largest effect was observed with BDNF treatment, further analysis was performed to investigate the underlying mechanisms. Immunocytochemistry with anti-microtubule-associated protein 2 antibody revealed that BDNF did not affect cell viability under these culture conditions (see supplemental Fig. S2), thus, protein synthesis rates were calculated from the same cell number. Because BDNF increased the basal rate of protein synthesis in culture, we investigated the in vivo effects of BDNF using BDNF transgenic and knock-out mice. The rates of protein synthesis in cortical tissues from wild-type littermates, BDNF knock-out mice (+/−, −/−), and BDNF transgenic mice were examined by [35S]methionine incorporation. Cortical tissue from homozygous (−/−) BDNF knock-out mice exhibited a reduced rate of protein synthesis (Fig. 2A). Lower protein synthesis rates were also observed in tissue from heterozygous (+/−) mice, which express BDNF protein at approximately half of the levels observed in wild-type littermates. BDNF protein in the cortices of both wild-type and transgenic mice was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In P1–2 mice, the BDNF levels were 5.3 ± 0.8 pg/mg of protein (n = 6, mean ± S.D.) in wild-type cortices, whereas they were 12.8 ± 2.2 pg/mg of protein (n = 6, mean ± S.D.) in transgenic cortices, which represented a significant increase (p < 0.001, t test). In the cortical tissue from transgenic mice overexpressing BDNF, the rate of protein synthesis was higher than in wild-type cortex (Fig. 2B). Translational processes are controlled by various translation factors. We examined whether chronic BDNF treatment altered the levels of various translation initiation factors, elongation factors, and release factors. Control cultures and neurons treated with BDNF (50 ng/ml) for 5 days in culture were harvested and their lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The levels of various translation factors were analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 3) and were quantified using densitometry (see supplemental Fig. S1). As shown in Figs. 3 and 4, BDNF specifically and significantly up-regulated the level of eEF2.FIGURE 4Effect of chronic BDNF treatment on the levels and phosphorylation status of eEF2. Conventional and quantitative RT-PCR was performed to examine eEF2 mRNA levels in neurons following BDNF treatment for 5 days (A). A single band of predicted size (236 bp) was observed (n = 4 in each group). Quantitative RT-PCR indicates there is no difference between control and BDNF-treated neurons (n = 4, p = 0.931 (t test)). Neurons were pulse labeled with [35S]methionine for 1 h, and then washed. eEF2 was immunoprecipitated after 1 and 6 h and analyzed in neurons at 4 days in culture and quantified by Image analyzer (BAS 5000, Fuji Film). Bars represent mean ± S.D. (n = 3). *, p < 0.01 (t test) (B). Western blotting (WB) (D and E) and densitometric analysis (D and E) were performed to examine the total and phosphorylated (inactive) protein levels of eEF2 in neurons following BDNF treatment (50 ng/ml) for 5 days. Bars represent the mean ± S.D. (n = 8). *, p < 0.001 (t test). The phosphorylation ratio of eEF2 is presented in panel F.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine whether the increase of the eEF2 protein level is dependent on transcription or translation, RT-PCR and pulse-chase experiments were performed. BDNF treatment did not alter the eEF2 mRNA level at culture days 3 (data not shown) or 5 as revealed by quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 4A). In contrast, newly synthesized eEF2 protein (1 h after labeling) was significantly higher in BDNF-treated neurons, as revealed by pulse-chase and immunoprecipitation (Fig. 4B). In addition, degradation rates of eEF2 after 6 h were the same in both control and BDNF-treated neurons (in both cases, eEF2 levels at 6 h were about the half of that of 1 h). These results indicate that BDNF enhances eEF2 translation but neither its transcription nor degradation. The elongation activity of eEF2 is regulated by phosphorylation at one position, serine 56. To determine whether the phosphorylation of this position was influenced by BDNF, we quantified the levels of phosphorylated eEF2 (P-eEF2) and total eEF2 on Western blots using phospho-eEF2 specific antibody and pan-eEF2 antibody. Whereas BDNF increased the total amount of eEF2 protein, it markedly reduced the level of phospho-eEF2, which does not contribute to translation elongation (Fig. 4, D–F). Immunocytochemical analysis shows the same result. Untreated neurons exhibited faint immunoreactivity for eEF2 but rather strong signals for phospho-eEF2. Neurons treated with BDNF displayed stronger eEF2 immunoreactivity, whereas the signal for phospho-eEF2 was weak. Both total and phospho-eEF2 immunoreactivity was evident along neurites as well as in the cell body (see supplemental Fig. S2). We concluded that the net increase of the active form of eEF2 (unphosphorylated eEF2) was induced by BDNF treatment, consistent with an increased basal rate of protein synthesis. Levels of total and phosphorylated eEF2 in the cerebral cortices of BDNF knock-out and BDNF transgenic mice were examined by Western blotting. Similar to the results from neuronal cultures, an increased level of total eEF2 and a decreased level of phosphorylated eEF2 were observed in cortices from BDNF transgenic mice (Fig. 5). On the other hand, the level of eEF2 was lower and the level of phosphorylated eEF2 was higher in cortices from BDNF knock-out (−/−) mice (Fig. 5). The ratio of phosphorylated eEF2 to total eEF2 is shown in Fig. 5C. We next investigated whether the decrease in eEF2 phosphorylation induced by BDNF treatment was a consequence of decreased kinase activity or increased phosphatase activity. Protein levels and activities of the eEF2 kinase eEF2K (also called calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase III), and the eEF2 phosphatase PP2A were examined. Western blot analysis revealed that chronic BDNF treatment decreased the level of eEF2K to about half that observed in control samples (Fig. 6). eEF2K kinase activity present in cell lysates from control and BDNF-treated cultures was measured using immunopurified eEF2 as a substrate. BDNF treatment decreased the level of eEF2K activity, as well as its protein level (Fig. 6C). The level and activity of PP2A were also measured. PP2A was immunoprecipitated from control and BDNF-treated neurons with anti-PP2A C subunit antibody and the phosphatase activity of PP2A in the precipitates was measured. BDNF treatment increased the levels of PP2A protein and activity (Fig. 6). Thus, the increased level of unphosphorylated eEF2 was likely due to a combination of a decrease in kinase activity and an increase in phosphatase activity. Unphosphorylated (active) eEF2 induces aminoacyl-tRNA translocation from the A site to the P site of a ribosome to promote elongation. Because BDNF increased the level of unphosphorylated eEF2, we examined the rate of translation elongation in cortical neurons with or without BDNF treatment. To accomplish this, we measured the ribosomal transit time, a parameter inversely correlated with the rate of translation elongation. The transit times for control neurons and BDNF-treated neurons were ∼9 and 6 min, respectively (Fig. 7A). Thus, BDNF treatment significantly shortened the transit time (Fig. 8B), demonstrating that BDNF enhances the elongation rate in cortical neurons.FIGURE 8Overexpression of eEF2 in cortical neurons. cDNA encoding rat eEF2 or EGFP (as a control) was transfected into primary cortical neurons. A, expression and phosphorylation of eEF2 were analyzed by Western blotting and quantified using densitometry. Actin was used as a standard. Bars represent the mean ± S.D. (n = 4; *, p < 0.05, t test). B, the incorporation of [35S]methionine into newly synthesized protein was determined using sister transfectants to the cells used to determine the level of eEF2 expression. Bars represent the mean ± S.D. (n = 12; *, p < 0.01, t test).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To directly examine the causal relationship between the increased level of eEF2 and the enhanced protein synthesis rate, we transfected primary cultured neurons with cDNA encoding rat eEF2 cDNA. Electroporation of eEF2 cDNA into neurons resulted in an ∼1.4-fold increase in the level of eEF2 protein compared with that in EGFP-transfected, control neurons (Fig. 8A). The transfection efficacy estimated by counting EGFP fluorescent cells was 20–25% in five individual experiments. In these experiments, the levels of phosphorylated eEF2 were similar following eEF2 or control transfection. eEF2-overexpressing neurons showed an increased protein synthesis rate (Fig. 8B). These results strongly suggest that the increased level of unphosphorylated eEF2 in neurons enhanced the level of protein synthesis. Here we have demonstrated that BDNF increases the level of eEF2 and decreases its phosphorylation to promote translation elongation an"

We determined the crystal structures of a NEIL1 ortholog from the giant Mimivirus (MvNei1) unliganded and bound to DNA containing tetrahydrofuran (THF), which is the first structure of any Nei with an abasic site analog. The MvNei1 structures exhibit the same overall architecture as other enzymes of the Fpg/Nei family, which consists of two globular domains joined by a linker region.

In contrast to Escherichia coli Nei, where a dramatic conformational change was observed upon binding DNA, the structure of MvNei1 bound to DNA does not reveal any substantial movement compared with the unliganded enzyme. A protein segment encompassing residues 217–245 in MvNei1 corresponds to the “missing loop” in E. coli Nei and the “αF–β10 loop” in E. coli Fpg, which has been reported to be involved in lesion recognition. Interestingly, the corresponding loop in MvNei1 is ordered in both the unliganded and furan-bound structures, unlike other Fpg/Nei enzymes where the loop is generally ordered in the unliganded enzyme or in complexes with a lesion, and disordered otherwise.

All organisms must cope with the generation of potentially lethal or mutagenic oxidative DNA base damage produced by endogenous free radicals. The enzymes that recognize and initiate the repair of these lesions are the DNA glycosylases, which are found ubiquitously in all three kingdoms of life (for reviews see Refs. 1Krokan H.E. Standal R.

Some of these enzymes are bifunctional, i.e. they catalyze the hydrolysis of the N-glycosyl bond linking a base to a deoxyribose (glycosylase activity) and subsequently cleave the DNA 3′ to the apurinic/apyrimidinic site (lyase activity), whereas others are monofunctional and only carry out the glycosylase reaction, generating abasic sites as products. Structural studies indicate that the DNA glycosylases that recognize oxidative DNA damages fall into two family groups: the helix-hairpin-helix superfamily and the Fpg/Nei family (for reviews see Refs. 1Krokan H.E.

The helix-hairpin-helix superfamily includes a diverse group of enzymes with varying substrate specificities which nonetheless share a helix-hairpin-helix motif that consists of two α-helices connected by a hairpin loop, followed by a Gly/Pro-rich loop and a conserved catalytic aspartate residue (7Thayer M.M.

Glycosylase members of the second family, the Fpg/Nei family, share a two-domain architecture: The N-terminal domain consists of a two-layered β-sandwich with two α-helices, whereas the C-terminal domain contains four α-helices, of which two are involved in a conserved helix-two-turn-helix (H2TH) 3The abbreviations used are: H2THhelix-two-turn-helixFpgformamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase8-oxoG8-oxoguanineNeiendonuclease VIIIGhguanidinohydantoinDHU5,6-dihydrouracilBstFpgB. stearothermophilus FpgLlaFpgL. lactis FpgcFapyFpgcarbocyclic FapydGTHFtetrahydrofuranMvNei1NEIL1 ortholog from the giant MimivirusBis-Tris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolTthFpgT. thermophilus FpgEcoFpgE. coli Fpg. 3The abbreviations used are: H2THhelix-two-turn-helixFpgformamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase8-oxoG8-oxoguanineNeiendonuclease VIIIGhguanidinohydantoinDHU5,6-dihydrouracilBstFpgB. stearothermophilus FpgLlaFpgL. lactis FpgcFapyFpgcarbocyclic FapydGTHFtetrahydrofuranMvNei1NEIL1 ortholog from the giant MimivirusBis-Tris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolTthFpgT. thermophilus FpgEcoFpgE. coli Fpg. motif, and two β-strands that make up the zinc finger motif (2Wallace S.S.

Lozon M. Makaroff C. Savage L. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 5201-5207Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar); however, the principal biological substrate for Fpg is 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) (9Chung M.H.

Human NEIL1 and MvNei1 bind DNA containing THF but do not cleave the DNA backbone. The MvNei1·THF complex is the first structure of an Nei with an abasic site analog. MvNei1 shares significant structural similarity with human NEIL1 (29Doublié S. Bandaru V. Bond J.P. Wallace S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 10284-10289Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In contrast to E. coli Nei where a dramatic conformational change was observed upon binding DNA (30Golan G. Zharkov D.O. Feinberg H. Fernandes A.S. Zaika E.I. Kycia J.H. Grollman A.P. Shoham G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 5006-5016Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), the structure of MvNei1 bound to furan containing DNA does not reveal any substantial conformational change compared with the unliganded protein. The MvNei1 loop corresponding to the αF-β9/10 lesion recognition loop of Fpg is ordered in both the unliganded and furan-bound structures, unlike what was reported for other Fpg/Nei enzymes where the loop is generally ordered when the enzyme is unliganded or bound to a lesion, and disordered otherwise. In the MvNei1·THF complex a tyrosine located at the tip of the putative lesion recognition loop stacks against the furan ring; the tyrosine and/or the tip of the loop are predicted to adopt a different conformation in the presence of a modified base. All organisms must cope with the generation of potentially lethal or mutagenic oxidative DNA base damage produced by endogenous free radicals. The enzymes that recognize and initiate the repair of these lesions are the DNA glycosylases, which are found ubiquitously in all three kingdoms of life (for reviews see Refs. 1Krokan H.E. Standal R. Slupphaug G. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar, 2Wallace S.S. Bandaru V. Kathe S.D. Bond J.P.

Swenson S.L. Lynch M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2003; 20: 1603-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Some of these enzymes are bifunctional, i.e. they catalyze the hydrolysis of the N-glycosyl bond linking a base to a deoxyribose (glycosylase activity) and subsequently cleave the DNA 3′ to the apurinic/apyrimidinic site (lyase activity), whereas others are monofunctional and only carry out the glycosylase reaction, generating abasic sites as products. Structural studies indicate that the DNA glycosylases that recognize oxidative DNA damages fall into two family groups: the helix-hairpin-helix superfamily and the Fpg/Nei family (for reviews see Refs. 1Krokan H.E. Standal R. Slupphaug G. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar, 5Fromme J.C. Banerjee A. Verdine G.L. Curr. Opin Struct.

The helix-hairpin-helix superfamily includes a diverse group of enzymes with varying substrate specificities which nonetheless share a helix-hairpin-helix motif that consists of two α-helices connected by a hairpin loop, followed by a Gly/Pro-rich loop and a conserved catalytic aspartate residue (7Thayer M.M. Ahern H. Xing D. Cunningham R.P. Tainer J.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4108-4120Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Glycosylase members of the second family, the Fpg/Nei family, share a two-domain architecture: The N-terminal domain consists of a two-layered β-sandwich with two α-helices, whereas the C-terminal domain contains four α-helices, of which two are involved in a conserved helix-two-turn-helix (H2TH) 3The abbreviations used are: H2THhelix-two-turn-helixFpgformamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase8-oxoG8-oxoguanineNeiendonuclease VIIIGhguanidinohydantoinDHU5,6-dihydrouracilBstFpgB. stearothermophilus FpgLlaFpgL. lactis FpgcFapyFpgcarbocyclic FapydGTHFtetrahydrofuranMvNei1NEIL1 ortholog from the giant MimivirusBis-Tris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolTthFpgT. thermophilus FpgEcoFpgE. coli Fpg. 3The abbreviations used are: H2THhelix-two-turn-helixFpgformamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase8-oxoG8-oxoguanineNeiendonuclease VIIIGhguanidinohydantoinDHU5,6-dihydrouracilBstFpgB. stearothermophilus FpgLlaFpgL. lactis FpgcFapyFpgcarbocyclic FapydGTHFtetrahydrofuranMvNei1NEIL1 ortholog from the giant MimivirusBis-Tris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolTthFpgT. thermophilus FpgEcoFpgE. coli Fpg. motif, and two β-strands that make up the zinc finger motif (2Wallace S.S.

https://openalex.org/W1974682700,"Migratory marine vertebrates move annually across remote oceanic water masses crossing international borders. Many anthropogenic threats such as overfishing, bycatch, pollution or global warming put millions of marine migrants at risk especially during their long-distance movements. Therefore, precise knowledge about these migratory movements to understand where and when these animals are more exposed to human impacts is vital for addressing marine conservation issues. Because electronic tracking devices suffer from several constraints, mainly logistical and financial, there is emerging interest in finding appropriate intrinsic markers, such as the chemical composition of inert tissues, to study long-distance migrations and identify wintering sites. Here, using tracked pelagic seabirds and some of their own feathers which were known to be grown at different places and times within the annual cycle, we proved the value of biogeochemical analyses of inert tissue as tracers of marine movements and habitat use. Analyses of feathers grown in summer showed that both stable isotope signatures and element concentrations can signal the origin of breeding birds feeding in distinct water masses. However, only stable isotopes signalled water masses used during winter because elements mainly accumulated during the long breeding period are incorporated into feathers grown in both summer and winter. Our findings shed new light on the simple and effective assignment of marine organisms to distinct oceanic areas, providing new opportunities to study unknown migration patterns of secretive species, including in relation to human-induced mortality on specific populations in the marine environment."
https://openalex.org/W2126323509,"The glucocorticoid-regulated protein annexin A1 is a potent inhibitor of hormone exocytosis in the neuroendocrine system, acting in a paracrine/juxtacrine manner. The signaling mechanism employed by annexin A1 in this process is uncertain, although we have recently presented evidence for a role of the formyl peptide receptor in vivo. We sought to characterize the mechanism of action of annexin A1 on exocytosis using the release of adrenocorticotrophin from the corticotroph-like cell line AtT20 as an in vitro model system. Through the comparison of adrenocorticotrophin release from cells expressing either wild-type annexin A1 or mutant forms, we show a critical involvement of phosphorylation on serine 27 and 45 in the translocation of the protein to the membrane and its inhibitory action on exocytosis. Moreover, we show, for the first time, that annexin A1-dependent inhibition of adrenocorticotrophin release involves the enhancement of actin polymerization to prevent exocytosis via formyl peptide receptor and Rho kinase signaling pathways. This finding has significant implications for the inhibitory actions of annexin A1 on exocytosis in other endocrine and immune contexts."
https://openalex.org/W2093374908,"Spring viraemia of carp (SVC) is a fatal viral disease for cyprinid fish, which is caused by spring viraemia of carp virus (SVCV). To date, no SVC outbreak has been reported in China. Between 1998 and 2002, outbreaks of SVC were reported in ornamental and wild fish in Europe and America, imported from multiple sources including China. Based on phylogenetic analysis, the viral strain isolated from America was shown to be originated from Asia. These outbreaks not only resulted in huge economic losses, but also raise an interesting question as to whether SVCV really exists in China and if so, is it responsible for SVC outbreaks? From 2002 to 2006, we screened 6700 samples from ornamental fish farms using the cell culture method of the Office International des Epizooties (OIE), and further verified the presence of SVCV by ELISA and real-time quantitative RT-PCR. Two infected samples were found and the complete genome of SVCV was sequenced from one of the isolates, termed SVCV-C1. Several unique hallmarks of SVCV-C1 were identified, including six amino acid (KSLANA) insertion in the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) protein and ten nucleotide insertion in the region between glycoprotein (G) and L genes in European SVCV strains. Phylogenetic tree analysis of the full-length G protein of selected SVCV isolates from the United Kingdom and United States revealed that G proteins could be classified into Ia and Id sub genogroups. The Ia sub genogroup can be further divided into newly defined sub genogroups Ia-A and Ia-B. The isolates derived from the United States and China including the SVCV-C1 belongs to in the Ia-A sub genogroup. The SVCV-C1 G protein shares more than 99% homology with the G proteins of the SVCV strains from England and the United States, making it difficult to compare their pathogenicity. Comparison of the predicted three-dimensional structure based on the published G protein sequences from five SVCV strains revealed that the main differences were in the loops of the pleckstrin homology domains. Since SVCV is highly pathogenic, we speculate that SVC may therefore pose a serious threat to farmed cyprinid fish in China."

For plectin, the prototype of these proteins, an unusual diversity of isoforms has been reported, which show distinct expression patterns, subcellular localizations, and functions. Plectin has been shown to have important functions in skin and muscle, but little is known about its role in neural cells. To address this issue, we generated two knock-out mouse lines, one which was selectively lacking plectin 1c (P1c), the major isoform expressed in neural cells, and another in which plectin was conditionally deleted in neuronal precursor cells. Using isoform-specific antibodies, we found P1c to be expressed late in development and to associate with postsynaptic dendrites of central nervous system neurons, motorneurons of spinal cord, sciatic nerve axons, and Schwann cells. Motor nerve conduction velocity was found significantly reduced in sciatic nerve from P1c-deficient as well as from conditional knock-out mice. This defect was traceable to an increased number of motor nerve fibers with small cross-sectional areas; the thicknesses of axons and of myelin sheaths were unaffected.

Besides contributing to tissue integrity, there is increasing evidence that cytolinker proteins play important roles as cytoplasmic scaffolding platforms for signaling cascades, controlling basic metabolic and dynamic activities of cells.

For EBS-MD, the most common form of the disease, severe skin blistering, late onset muscular dystrophy, and in some cases cerebral and cerebellar atrophies were observed (14Smith F.J. Eady R.A.

Recently, plectin has also been implicated in Alexander disease, a rare neurological disorder caused by mutations in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (15Tian R. Gregor M. Wiche G. Goldman J.E. Am. J. Pathol. 2006; 168: 888-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).For plectin, an unusual diversity of isoforms has been reported (16Elliott C.E. Becker B.

Alternative splicing of a dozen different first exons into one common exon 2 gives rise to multiple variants differing only in relatively short N-terminal sequences. A number of recent reports show that these sequences confer specific functions to the distinct isoforms (18Andrä K. Kornacker I. Jörgl A. Zörer M. Spazierer D. Fuchs P. Fischer I. Wiche G. J. Invest.

The plectin isoform most prominently expressed in brain tissue is plectin 1c (P1c) (17Fuchs P. Zörer M. Rezniczek G.A. Spazierer D. Oehler S. Castañón M.J. Hauptmann R. Wiche G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2461-2472Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The diversity of P1c transcripts is further increased by three non-coding exons (−1, 0, and 0a) that are alternatively spliced into the first coding exon (1c). Additional plectin variants lacking the α-helical ∼190-nm-long central rod domain of the protein (16Elliott C.E. Becker B. Oehler S. Castañón M.J. Hauptmann R. Wiche G. Genomics. 1997; 42: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) are expressed in the central nervous system, however only at a level that is ∼20-fold lower than that of the full-length protein (23Fuchs P. Spazierer D. Wiche G. Cell Mol. Neurobiol. 2005; 25: 1141-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar).In the present study, we used P1c isoform-specific antibodies and generated P1c-deficient mice to address the following questions. (i) Is the expression of P1c in brain developmentally regulated? (ii) Is P1c compartmentalized within neural cells? (iii) Does P1c deficiency affect gross morphology and/or cytoarchitecture of neural cells? (iv) Can any neuropathological consequences of P1c deficiency be identified? In what follows, we provide answers to these questions and report as a key finding that P1c deficiency causes reduced motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV) combined with a reduction in motor neuron calibers.DISCUSSIONUsing isoform-specific antibodies, we found a polarized distribution of P1c to the postsynaptic dendritic cell compartment of non-myelinated central nervous system neurons. Since the P1c-specific staining pattern was indistinguishable from that observed with antibodies not discriminating between isoforms, and, moreover, since such antibodies were unreactive with dendrites of P1c−/− mice, we conclude that P1c is the only major plectin variant expressed in neurons of the central nervous system. This distinguishes central nervous system neurons from other cell types, such as keratinocytes and muscle fibers, where usually more than one variant of plectin is expressed (18Andrä K. Kornacker I. Jörgl A. Zörer M. Spazierer D. Fuchs P. Fischer I. Wiche G. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2003; 120: 189-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 21Konieczny P. Fuchs P.

Reipert S. Schneller D. Abrahamsberg C. Davies K.E. Winder S.J. Wiche G. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 965-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Similarly, in other types of central nervous system cells, such as ependymal cells and a subset of astrocytes, other (not yet identified) plectin isoforms were found to be expressed in addition to P1c.Apart from plectin, two other plakin protein family members, BPAG1 and ACF7/MACF1, have been reported to be widely expressed in neuronal tissues (8Bernier G. Pool M. Kilcup M. Alfoldi J. De Repentigny Y. Kothary R. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 219: 216-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 38Yang Y. Dowling J. Yu Q.C. Kouklis P. Cleveland D.W. Fuchs E.

Biol. 1997; 187: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 40Dalpe G. Leclerc N. Vallee A. Messer A. Mathieu M. De Repentigny Y. Kothary R. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1998; 10: 243-257Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). BPAG1 has been localized in the cell body, dendrites, and axons of mature neurons and thus apparently does not exhibit a polarized distribution like P1c. In the case of ACF7/MACF1, transcripts were detected in cerebellum, hippocampus, and cerebral cortex, but very little is known about its subcellular localization. Hence, P1c is the only plakin protein family member known to date that specifically localizes to postsynaptic dendrites in the central nervous system. However, since alternative first exon-encoded N-terminal amino acid sequences of remarkable similarity to that of P1c exist for both BPAG1 and ACF7/MACF1 isoforms (17Fuchs P. Zörer M. Rezniczek G.A. Spazierer D. Oehler S. Castañón M.J. Hauptmann R. Wiche G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2461-2472Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), it would not come as a surprise to us if eventually these proteins were found at similar locations.Since P1c was detected in mouse brain only at late developmental stages, its expression profile would fit with the growing number of synapses developing in the brain of young animals. One may therefore speculate that P1c could play a role in the formation of synapses and/or maintenance of their functional integrity. The novel mouse models described here could be useful tools for future studies addressing these questions in more detail.Since we found P1c to be abundantly expressed in peripheral nerve cell axons and in their associated myelinating Schwann cells, a role in peripheral neural cell function, such as in nerve conduction, was not unexpected. Two independent knock-out strategies, the isoform-specific knock-out and the neuronal cell-restricted (nestin-Cre-mediated) conditional knock-out, both led to animals with reduced MNCV. It was important to confirm the phenotype observed in the plectin isoform-deficient mouse line in an alternative system, because a recent analysis of the genomic locus upstream of the plectin gene revealed that two of its non-coding exons (−1 and 0a), which directly precede exon 1c, were also part of transcripts encoding PARP10, a newly identified member of the PARP protein family (41Lesniewicz K. Lüscher-Firzlaff J. Poreba E. Fuchs P. Walsemann G. Wiche G. Lüscher B. Genomics. 2005; 86: 38-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S3A). As a consequence of this exon sharing, the P1c−/− mouse line that we have generated represents in fact a double knock-out (P1c−/−/PARP10−/−). Whereas PARP10 transcripts were not detectable in the central nervous system, they were found to be expressed in sciatic nerve to some extent (supplemental Fig. S3, B and C). Hence, theoretically the lack of PARP10, and not that of P1c, could have been responsible for the observed phenotype of reduced MNCV in P1c−/− mice. However, this possibility can be ruled out, because the conditional nes-Cre/plecf/Δ mouse model (where plectin was knocked down, leaving PARP10 unaffected) showed a similar MNCV reduction.The only other plectin-related cytolinker for which gene mutations leading to defects in peripheral nerve function have been reported is BPAG1. In one of several mouse lines carrying the mutation dystonia musculorum (42Duchen L.W. Adv. Neurol. 1976; 14: 353-365PubMed Google Scholar), the missing exons in the Bpag1 locus encode an N-terminal BPAG1 sequence, which is quite similar to a corresponding one in plectin. However, contrary to dystonia musculorum mice, which show progressive degeneration of sensory neurons, loss of motor activity, myelination abnormalities (caused by defects in the function of Schwann cell), and axonal swellings (5Bernier G. De Repentigny Y. Mathieu M. David S. Kothary R. Development. 1998; 125: 2135-2148PubMed Google Scholar, 39Dowling J. Yang Y. Wollmann R. Reichardt L.F. Fuchs E. Dev. Biol. 1997; 187: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 43Bernier G. Brown A. Dalpé G. De Repentigny Y. Mathieu M. Kothary R. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1995; 6: 509-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), the phenotypic alterations of P1c−/− mice were restricted to reduced MNCV and a shift of axon diameters toward smaller calibers.Interestingly, the phenotypes more closely resembling those of P1c−/− mice turned out to be the ones of mice with deficiencies in proteins falling into the category of plectin binding partners. For instance, axonal atrophy along with reduced MNCV have been reported for MAP1B-null mice (30Meixner A. Haverkamp S. Wässle H. Führer S. Thalhammer J. Kropf N. Bittner R.E. Lassmann H. Wiche G. Propst F. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1169-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), suggesting a role of MAPs in peripheral nerve axon caliber determination, reminiscent of P1c. Whereas MAP1B knock-out mice displayed abnormal brain architecture, including delayed myelination and tract malformation (30Meixner A. Haverkamp S. Wässle H. Führer S. Thalhammer J. Kropf N.

Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1615-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), mice deficient for another plectin interaction partner, MAP2 (45Herrmann H. Wiche G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1320-1325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), showed a less severe phenotype, manifesting as subtle alterations in axonal cytoarchitecture (46Teng J. Takei Y. Harada A. Nakata T. Chen J. Hirokawa N. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Reduced MNCVs have also been observed in knock-out mouse models lacking one of the three NF subunit proteins, L, M, or H (47Kriz J. Zhu Q. Julien J.P. Padjen A.L. Brain Res. 2000; 885: 32-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 48Rao M.V. Garcia M.L. Miyazaki Y. Gotow T. Yuan A. Mattina S. Ward C.M. Calcutt N.A. Uchiyama Y. Nixon R.A. Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 681-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), all of which have been shown to bind to plectin (36Foisner R. Leichtfried F.E. Herrmann H. Small J.V. Lawson D. Wiche G. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 723-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Although no myelination defects were detectable in any of these mice, in all of them axon diameters were found shifted toward smaller calibers, and in NF-L- and NF-M-deficient mice, additionally, axonal loss was observed (47Kriz J. Zhu Q. Julien J.P. Padjen A.L. Brain Res. 2000; 885: 32-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 48Rao M.V. Garcia M.L. Miyazaki Y. Gotow T. Yuan A. Mattina S. Ward C.M. Calcutt N.A. Uchiyama Y. Nixon R.A. Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 681-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Thus, among all of these knock-out lines, the phenotype of NF-H-null mice was the one most closely resembling that of the P1c−/− mice.Two explanations were offered for the NF-H-null phenotype: (i) that axonal caliber reduction is the sole reason for diminished MNCV (48Rao M.V. Garcia M.L. Miyazaki Y. Gotow T. Yuan A. Mattina S. Ward C.M. Calcutt N.A. Uchiyama Y. Nixon R.A. Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 681-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and (ii) that a putative NF-H-dependent effect influences the clustering and/or function of potassium channels (47Kriz J. Zhu Q. Julien J.P. Padjen A.L. Brain Res. 2000; 885: 32-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In motor neurons lacking P1c, we did not detect any dislocation of key proteins present at nodes of Ranvier, such as juxtaparanodal potassium channels and Caspr2, paranodal proteins Caspr/paranodin and NF155, or nodal sodium channels; nor did nodes of Ranvier show any structural abnormalities, nor were nodal distances altered. Consequently, for P1c−/− mice, a relatively small shift of axon calibers toward smaller diameters may be the main reason for reduced MNCV. Nevertheless, despite being properly located, cation channels could still be functionally affected by P1c deficiency. In a recent study, spectrins (αII and βII) and ankyrin B were found to be part of a specialized paranodal cytoskeleton (49Ogawa Y. Schafer D.P. Horresh I. Bar V. Hales K. Yang Y. Susuki K. Peles E. Stankewich M.C. Rasband M.N. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 5230-5239Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Since plectin was shown to interact with spectrins (45Herrmann H. Wiche G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1320-1325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), its absence from peripheral nerve axons could destabilize this cytoskeletal system and therefore affect axonal membranes and/or ion channel properties.In summary, by using isoform-deficient as well as nerve tissue-specific conditional plectin knock-out mice, we uncovered a specific function of a plectin isoform (P1c) in motor neuron performance. A reduction of conduction velocity in sciatic nerve could be traced to reduced axon calibers. On the other hand, P1c seems not to be essential for brain and peripheral nervous system development. The molecular mechanisms leading to axon caliber changes remain to be elucidated, including open questions of whether P1c influences cytoskeleton dynamics and/or ion channel functions. The new mutant mouse lines described here may become useful also for behavior and cognition studies addressing the role of P1c in the central nervous system. Cytolinker proteins, like plectin, BPAG1, and ACF7/MACF1, are particularly abundant in tissues exposed to great mechanical stress, such as muscle and epithelia, and some of them show high level expression also in neural tissues. Besides contributing to tissue integrity, there is increasing evidence that cytolinker proteins play important roles as cytoplasmic scaffolding platforms for signaling cascades, controlling basic metabolic and dynamic activities of cells. The best studied example is plectin, which has been shown to regulate non-receptor tyrosine kinases, mitogen- and AMP-activated kinases, and protein kinase C (1Osmanagic-Myers S. Wiche G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18701-18710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 2Osmanagic-Myers S. Gregor M. Walko G. Burgstaller G. Reipert S. Wiche G. J.

Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 1864-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). With a few exceptions, our knowledge about cytolinker functions in neural cells of vertebrates is limited. Spontaneous deletions and targeted inactivation of Bpag1 in mice cause dystonia musculorum, a neuropathy that manifests as a loss of motor activity caused by progressive degeneration of sensory neurons (4Guo L.

Y' elements are transcriptionally active and highly enriched in nucleosomes, whereas X elements are repressed and devoid of nucleosomes. In contrast to X elements, the Y' elements also lack the classical hallmarks of heterochromatin, such as high Sir3 and Rap1 occupancy as well as low levels of histone H4 lysine 16 acetylation.

https://openalex.org/W2014296748,"The genus Orthopoxvirus contains several species of related viruses, including the causative agent of smallpox (Variola virus). In addition to smallpox, several other members of the genus are capable of causing human infection, including monkeypox, cowpox, and other zoonotic rodent-borne poxviruses. Therefore, a single assay that can accurately identify all orthopoxviruses could provide a valuable tool for rapid broad orthopovirus identification. We have developed a pan-Orthopoxvirus assay for identification of all members of the genus based on four PCR reactions targeting Orthopoxvirus DNA and RNA helicase and polymerase genes. The amplicons are detected using electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS) on the Ibis T5000 system. We demonstrate that the assay can detect and identify a diverse collection of orthopoxviruses, provide sub-species information and characterize viruses from the blood of rabbitpox infected rabbits. The assay is sensitive at the stochastic limit of PCR and detected virus in blood containing approximately six plaque-forming units per milliliter from a rabbitpox virus-infected rabbit."
https://openalex.org/W2011455371,"Marine populations have been declining at a worrying rate, due in large part to fishing pressures. The challenge is to secure a future for marine life while minimizing impacts on fishers and fishing communities.Rather than selecting areas where fishing is banned -- as is usually the case with spatial management -- we assess the concept of designating areas where fishing is permitted. We use spatial catch statistics for thirteen commercial fisheries on Canada's west coast to determine the minimum area that would be needed to maintain a pre-ascribed target percentage of current catches. We found that small reductions in fisheries yields, if strategically allocated, could result in large unfished areas that are representative of biophysical regions and habitat types, and have the potential to achieve remarkable conservation gains.Our approach of selecting fishing areas instead of reserves could help redirect debate about the relative values that society places on conservation and extraction, in a framework that could gain much by losing little. Our ideas are intended to promote discussions about the current status quo in fisheries management, rather than providing a definitive solution."

In 2005, cases were again reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We carried out a survey to estimate the village-level prevalence of yaws in the region of Equator in the north of the country in order to define appropriate strategies to effectively treat the affected population. Methodology/Principal Findings We designed a community-based survey using the Lot Quality Assurance Sampling method to classify the prevalence of active yaws in 14 groups of villages (lots). The classification into high, moderate, or low yaws prevalence corresponded to World Health Organization prevalence thresholds for identifying appropriate operational treatment strategies. Active yaws cases were defined by suggestive clinical signs and positive rapid plasma reagin and Treponema pallidum hemagglutination serological tests. The overall prevalence in the study area was 4.7% (95% confidence interval: 3.4–6.0). Two of 14 lots had high prevalence (>10%), three moderate prevalence (5–10%) and nine low prevalence (<5%.). Conclusions/Significance Although yaws is no longer a World Health Organization priority disease, the presence of yaws in a region where it was supposed to be eradicated demonstrates the importance of continued surveillance and control efforts. Yaws should remain a public health priority in countries where previously it was known to be endemic. The integration of sensitive surveillance systems together with free access to effective treatment is recommended. As a consequence of our study results, more than 16,000 people received free treatment against yaws."
https://openalex.org/W2046560280,"Voltage-gated potassium channels that activate near the neuronal resting membrane potential are important regulators of excitation in the nervous system, but their functional diversity is still not well understood. For instance, Kv12.2 (ELK2, KCNH3) channels are highly expressed in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, and although they are most likely to contribute to resting potassium conductance, surprisingly little is known about their function or regulation. Here we demonstrate that the auxiliary MinK (KCNE1) and MiRP2 (KCNE3) proteins are important regulators of Kv12.2 channel function. Reduction of endogenous KCNE1 or KCNE3 expression by siRNA silencing, significantly increased macroscopic Kv12.2 currents in Xenopus oocytes by around 4-fold. Interestingly, an almost 9-fold increase in Kv12.2 currents was observed with the dual injection of KCNE1 and KCNE3 siRNA, suggesting an additive effect. Consistent with these findings, over-expression of KCNE1 and/or KCNE3 suppressed Kv12.2 currents. Membrane surface biotinylation assays showed that surface expression of Kv12.2 was significantly increased by KCNE1 and KCNE3 siRNA, whereas total protein expression of Kv12.2 was not affected. KCNE1 and KCNE3 siRNA shifted the voltages for half-maximal activation to more hyperpolarized voltages, indicating that KCNE1 and KCNE3 may also inhibit activation gating of Kv12.2. Native co-immunoprecipitation assays from mouse brain membranes imply that KCNE1 and KCNE3 interact with Kv12.2 simultaneously in vivo, suggesting the existence of novel KCNE1-KCNE3-Kv12.2 channel tripartite complexes. Together these data indicate that KCNE1 and KCNE3 interact directly with Kv12.2 channels to regulate channel membrane trafficking."
https://openalex.org/W2151751314,"Background Oleosin is a plant protein localized to lipid droplets and endoplasmic reticulum of plant cells. Our idea was to use it to target functional secretory proteins of interest to the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum of mammalian cells, through expressing oleosin-containing chimeras. We have designed this approach to create cellular models deficient in vitamin B12 (cobalamin) because of the known problematics associated to the obtainment of effective vitamin B12 deficient cell models. This was achieved by the overexpression of transcobalamin inside cells through anchoring to oleosin. Methodology chimera gene constructs including transcobalamin-oleosin (TC-O), green fluorescent protein-transcobalamin-oleosin (GFP-TC-O) and oleosin-transcobalamin (O-TC) were inserted into pAcSG2 and pCDNA3 vectors for expression in sf9 insect cells, Caco2 (colon carcinoma), NIE-115 (mouse neuroblastoma), HEK (human embryonic kidney), COS-7 (Green Monkey SV40-transfected kidney fibroblasts) and CHO (Chinese hamster ovary cells). The subcellular localization, the changes in vitamin B12 binding activity and the metabolic consequences were investigated in both Caco2 and NIE-115 cells. Principal findings vitamin B12 binding was dramatically higher in TC-O than that in O-TC and wild type (WT). The expression of GFP-TC-O was observed in all cell lines and found to be co-localized with an ER-targeted red fluorescent protein and calreticulin of the endoplasmic reticulum in Caco2 and COS-7 cells. The overexpression of TC-O led to B12 deficiency, evidenced by impaired conversion of cyano-cobalamin to ado-cobalamin and methyl-cobalamin, decreased methionine synthase activity and reduced S-adenosyl methionine to S-adenosyl homocysteine ratio, as well as increases in homocysteine and methylmalonic acid concentration. Conclusions/Significance the heterologous expression of TC-O in mammalian cells can be used as an effective strategy for investigating the cellular consequences of vitamin B12 deficiency. More generally, expression of oleosin-anchored proteins could be an interesting tool in cell engineering for studying proteins of pharmacological interest."
