This organ's cellular complexity has hindered progress in understanding the mechanisms underlying chronic kidney disease, which affects 10% of the world's population. Using single-cell transcriptional profiling, Park et al. produced a comprehensive cell atlas of the healthy mouse kidney (see the Perspective by Humphreys). An unexpected cell type in the collecting duct appears to be a transitional state between two known cell types. The transition from one cell type to the other is regulated by the Notch signaling pathway and is associated with metabolic acidosis. The authors also find that genetically distinct kidney diseases with common clinical features share common cellular origins. Science , this issue p. 758 ; see also p. 709"

Tsai et al. found that a cesium-doped lead triiodide perovskite with mixed organic cations underwent a uniform lattice expansion after 180 min of exposure at 1 sun of illumination. This structural change reduced the energy barriers for charge carriers at the contacts of solar cells. The resulting increase in power conversion efficiency from 18.5 to 20.5% was maintained for more than 1500 hours of illumination. Science , this issue p. 67"

The reactions link carbon radicals to the carbon centers adjacent to nitrogen in pyridine rings. Proctor et al. devised a method to steer these reactions to just one of two possible mirror-image products. To make the radicals, they prepared derivatives of widely available amino acids and then activated them with an iridium photocatalyst. At the same time, a chiral phosphoric acid catalyst was used to activate the pyridine and bias the reaction geometry. Science , this issue p. 419"

Muhar et al. applied a modified version of a transcript-mapping method called SLAM-seq to identify the target genes of two transcriptional regulators of major interest in cancer research (see the Perspective by Sabò and Amati). The MYC oncoprotein selectively activates transcription of just a few genes, primarily those involved in basic cell metabolism. In contrast, BRD4, a bromodomain-containing protein that is being targeted for cancer therapy, activates transcription of many genes. Science , this issue p. 800 ; see also p. 713"

Constructing these molecules is a challenging task for organic chemists, especially if a single stereoisomer is desired. Chen et al. engineered a heme-containing enzyme to catalyze sequential carbene insertion reactions using an alkyne substrate. Starting with an enzyme that could only catalyze a single carbene insertion, a series of mutations led to variants that catalyzed efficient, stereoselective production of bicyclobutanes. By using a less reactive alkyne substrate and screening more variants with active site mutations, the authors found enzymes that stop at either enantiomer of the intermediate cyclopropene.

It has been widely assumed that the atmosphere is the main source of terrestrial nitrogen input. Surprisingly, Houlton et al. now show that bedrock is just as large a nitrogen source across major sectors of the global terrestrial environment. They used three diverse and largely independent assessments of the nitrogen mobility and reactivity of rocks in the surface environment. These approaches yielded convergent estimates pointing to the equal importance of the atmosphere and bedrock as nitrogen sources. Science , this issue p. 58"

Quiescent stem cells have been thought to reside in the G 0 stage before activating to reenter the cell cycle. However, Otsuki and Brand now show that most quiescent stem cells in the Drosophila brain are arrested in G 2 . Cells in the two phases display differences; for example, G 2 stem cells awaken more quickly than G 0 stem cells, with the conserved pseudokinase Tribbles playing a regulatory role. Elucidating the different pathways and mechanisms underlying quiescence could help to inform regenerative drug design. Science , this issue p. 99"
https://openalex.org/W2796439542,"How to build a better morphogen gradient To translate insights in developmental biology into medical applications, techniques are needed to ensure correct cell localization. Morphogen gradients allow precise and highly reproducible pattern formation during development. Through in vitro experiments and modeling, Li et al. tested the effects of unusual properties of Hedgehog (HH) signaling. The HH morphogen's receptor, Patched (PTCH), sends an inhibitory signal when no ligand is bound, which is relieved by ligand binding. PTCH also regulates spatial distribution of the signal by sequestering the HH ligand. Furthermore, signaling through the receptor promotes synthesis of more inhibitory receptor. These characteristics help speed gradient formation and explain the robustness of the system to changes in the rate of morphogen production. Science , this issue p. 543"

The bone marrow microenvironment, or niche, is key to activating stem cell activity. Decker et al. now show that thrombopoietin generated in the liver, but not from the local bone marrow niche, maintains HSCs in vivo in mice. Thus, systemic endocrine factors are needed to maintain somatic stem cells from a distance. These findings may be important when considering how to stimulate HSCs for therapeutic use.

https://openalex.org/W2795978415,"This study assessed the prognostic value of pre-treatment neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in patients with metastatic solid tumors. Clinical and biological data for patients with metastatic solid tumors treated in an oncology outpatient department and prospectively followed by a call center (PROCHE program) between January 2008 and December 2011 were analyzed. All patients with an NLR value within 28 days before the first cycle of first-line of chemotherapy were included (cohort 1). To assess influence of chemotherapy line on NLR prognostic value, data from patients treated with later chemotherapy lines were also analyzed (cohort 2). Adjusted multivariate Cox regressions with or without non-linear and time-dependent effects were performed. Optimal NLR cut-off was investigated by time-dependent sensitivity analysis using several indices. There were 317 and 134 patients in cohorts 1 and 2, respectively. Elevated NLR was associated with worse survival (hazard ratio [HR] for death, 1.35 [95% confidence interval 1.19-1.54]; p<0.0001). The optimal NLR cut-off in cohort 1 was dependent on index used and time of assessment: HR values were non-significant at a cut-off of 3.0 (1.34 [0.99-1.32], but significant when the cut-off was 4.0 (1.53 [1.11-2.10]). NLR was linearly related to mortality risk; in subgroup analysis, no significant interaction was found with co-variables or tumor localization overall (cohorts 1+2). Pre-treatment NLR is a useful prognostic tool in patients with metastatic solid tumors, irrespective of primary tumor site, chemotherapy line, age, gender and performance status. However, using an NLR cut-off value for clinical decision-making requires extreme caution."
https://openalex.org/W2796197659,"The use of environmental DNA (eDNA) as a species detection tool is attracting attention from both scientific and applied fields, especially for detecting invasive or rare species. In order to use eDNA as an efficient and reliable tool, however, we need to understand its origin and state as well as factors affecting its degradation. Various biotic and abiotic environmental factors have been proposed to affect degradation of eDNA in aquatic environments and thus to influence detection rates of species. Here, we were interested in two of them, namely UV light, which can break down DNA, and the presence of filter feeders, which can remove DNA and DNA-bound particles. A few, mostly laboratory-based studies have found minor effects of UVB on the degradation of eDNA. Ultraviolet A radiation (UVA), however, has been neglected although it also causes DNA lesions and is 10- to 100-fold more prevalent than UVB when reaching the earth’s surface. Filter feeders are common in aquatic ecosystem, but their effects on eDNA has hitherto been ignored. We conducted a full-factorial aquatic mesocosm experiment under near-natural outdoor conditions manipulating UV radiation as well as the presence of Dreissena polymorpha, a strong filter feeder capable of filtering cells or organelles containing DNA. Surprisingly, we found that neither UV radiation nor the presence of the filter feeder affected eDNA-based detection rates of macroinvertebrates, even though the experiment took place in summer when UV radiation intensity and filtration activity is high for the chosen experimental site and conditions. These results, in combination with studies from marine or laboratory settings finding no effect of sunlight and its UV components on the detectability of eDNA, suggest that eDNA based species assessments could be relatively robust with respect to our two factors studied."
https://openalex.org/W2796131392,"Phytochromes are photoreceptors in plants, fungi, and various microorganisms and cycle between metastable red light–absorbing (Pr) and far-red light–absorbing (Pfr) states. Their light responses are thought to follow a conserved structural mechanism that is triggered by isomerization of the chromophore. Downstream structural changes involve refolding of the so-called tongue extension of the phytochrome-specific GAF-related (PHY) domain of the photoreceptor. The tongue is connected to the chromophore by conserved DIP and PRXSF motifs and a conserved tyrosine, but the role of these residues in signal transduction is not clear. Here, we examine the tongue interactions and their interplay with the chromophore by substituting the conserved tyrosine (Tyr263) in the phytochrome from the extremophile bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans with phenylalanine. Using optical and FTIR spectroscopy, X-ray solution scattering, and crystallography of chromophore-binding domain (CBD) and CBD–PHY fragments, we show that the absence of the Tyr263 hydroxyl destabilizes the β-sheet conformation of the tongue. This allowed the phytochrome to adopt an α-helical tongue conformation regardless of the chromophore state, hence distorting the activity state of the protein. Our crystal structures further revealed that water interactions are missing in the Y263F mutant, correlating with a decrease of the photoconversion yield and underpinning the functional role of Tyr263 in phytochrome conformational changes. We propose a model in which isomerization of the chromophore, refolding of the tongue, and globular conformational changes are represented as weakly coupled equilibria. The results also suggest that the phytochromes have several redundant signaling routes."

https://openalex.org/W2795417993,"Stress-related hyperglycaemia (SHG) is commonly seen in acutely ill patients and has been associated with poor outcomes in many studies performed in different acute care settings. We aimed to review the available evidence describing the associations between SHG and different outcomes in acutely ill patients admitted to an ICU. Study designs, populations, and outcome measures used in observational studies were analysed.We conducted a systematic scoping review of observational studies following the Joanna Briggs methodology. Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched for publications between January 2000 and December 2015 that reported on SHG and mortality, infection rate, length of stay, time on ventilation, blood transfusions, renal replacement therapy, or acquired weakness.The search yielded 3,063 articles, of which 43 articles were included (totalling 536,476 patients). Overall, the identified studies were heterogeneous in study conduct, SHG definition, blood glucose measurements and monitoring, treatment protocol, and outcome reporting. The most frequently reported outcomes were mortality (38 studies), ICU and hospital length of stay (23 and 18 studies, respectively), and duration of mechanical ventilation (13 studies). The majority of these studies (40 studies) compared the reported outcomes in patients who experienced SHG with those who did not. Fourteen studies (35.9%) identified an association between hyperglycaemia and increased mortality (odds ratios ranging from 1.13 to 2.76). Five studies identified hyperglycaemia as an independent risk factor for increased infection rates, and one identified it as an independent predictor of increased ICU length of stay.SHG was consistently associated with poor outcomes. However, the wide divergences in the literature mandate standardisation of measuring and monitoring SHG and the creation of a consensus on SHG definition. A better comparability between practices will improve our knowledge on SHG consequences and management."
https://openalex.org/W2795959203,"Childhood traumas, in the form of physical, sexual, and emotional abuse and neglect, are globally widespread and highly prevalent, and associated with a range of subsequent poor health outcomes. This study sought to understand the relationship between physical, sexual and emotional childhood abuse and subsequent HIV-risk behaviours amongst young people (18-30) living in urban informal settlements in Durban, South Africa. Data came from self-completed questionnaires amongst 680 women and 677 men comprising the baseline of the Stepping Stones and Creating Futures intervention trial. Men and women were analysed separately. Logistic regression models assessed the relationship between six HIV-risk behaviours and four measures of trauma: the form of trauma, the severity of each trauma, the range of traumas, and overall severity of childhood trauma. Childhood traumas were incredibly prevalent in this population. All childhood traumas were associated with a range of HIV-risk behaviours. This was for the ever/never trauma, as well as the severity of each type of trauma, the range of trauma, and overall severity of childhood trauma. Despite the wider harsh contexts of urban informal settlements, childhood traumas still play a significant role in shaping subsequent HIV-risk behaviours amongst young people. Interventions to reduce childhood traumas for populations in informal settlements need to be developed. In addition, trauma focused therapies need to be considered as part of wider HIV-prevention interventions for young adults.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03022370."
https://openalex.org/W2796106000,"Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) remains the major problem which precludes long-term survival after lung transplantation. Previously, an open label pilot study from our group demonstrated a possible beneficial effect of montelukast in progressive BOS patients with low airway neutrophilia (<15%), and already on azithromycin treatment, in whom the further decline in pulmonary function was attenuated. This was, however, a non-randomized and non-placebo controlled trial. The study design is a single center, prospective, interventional, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial, with a two arm parallel group design and an allocation ratio of 1:1. Randomization to additional montelukast (10 mg/day, n = 15) or placebo (n = 15) was performed from 2010 to 2014 at the University Hospitals Leuven (Leuven, Belgium) in all consecutive patients with late-onset (>2years posttransplant) BOS ≥1. Primary end-point was freedom from graft loss 1 year after randomization; secondary end-points were acute rejection, lymphocytic bronchiolitis, respiratory infection rate; and change in FEV1, airway and systemic inflammation during the study period. Graft loss at 1 y and 2y was similar in both groups (respectively p = 0. 981 and p = 0.230). Montelukast had no effect on lung function decline in the overall cohort. However, in a post-hoc subanalysis of BOS stage 1 patients, montelukast attenuated further decline of FEV1 during the study period, both in absolute (L) (p = 0.008) and % predicted value (p = 0.0180). A linear mixed model confirmed this association. Acute rejection, lymphocytic bronchiolitis, respiratory infections, systemic and airway inflammation were comparable between groups over the study period. This randomized controlled trial showed no additional survival benefit with montelukast compared to placebo, although the study was underpowered. The administration of montelukast was associated with an attenuation of the rate of FEV1 decline, however, only in recipients with late-onset BOS stage 1."

https://openalex.org/W2795574600,"Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a highly prevalent, chronic musculoskeletal condition characterized by widespread pain and evoked pain at tender points. This study evaluated various aspects of body awareness in a sample of 14 women with FMS and 13 healthy controls, such as plasticity of the body schema, body esteem, and interoceptive awareness. To this end, the Rubber Hand Illusion (RHI), the Body Esteem Scale (BES), and the Body Perception Questionnaire (BPQ) were used, respectively. Consistent with increased plasticity of the body schema, FMS patients scored higher, with large or very large effect sizes, across all three domains evaluated in the RHI paradigm, namely proprioceptive drift and perceived ownership and motor control over the rubber hand. Scores on all items addressed by the BES were consistently lower among FMS subjects (2.52, SEM .19 vs 3.89, SEM .16, respectively, p < .01, Cohen's d = .38-.66). In the FMS sample, BES scores assigned to most painful regions also were lower than those assigned to the remaining body sites (1.58, SEM .19 vs 2.87, SEM .18, respectively, p < .01). Significantly higher scores (p < .01, Cohen's d = .51-.87) were found in the FMS sample across awareness (3.57 SEM .15 vs 1.87 SEM .11), stress response (3.76 SEM .11 vs 1.78 SEM .11), autonomic nervous system reactivity (2.59 SEM .17 vs 1.35 SEM .07), and stress style 2 (2.73 SEM .27 vs 1.13 SEM .04) subscales of the BPQ. Intensity of ongoing clinical pain was found to be strongly correlated with interoceptive awareness (r = .75, p = .002). The results suggest a disturbed embodiment in FMS, characterized by instability of the body schema, negatively biased cognitions regarding one's own body, and increased vigilance to internal bodily cues. These manifestations may be interpreted as related with the inability of incoming sensory inputs to adequately update negatively biased off-line somatorepresentations stored as long-term memory."

https://openalex.org/W2795838254,"Although tau pathology, behavioral deficits, and neuronal loss are observed in patients with tauopathies, the relationship between these endpoints has not been clearly established. Here we found that rTg4510 mice, which overexpress human mutant tau in the forebrain, develop progressive age-dependent increases in locomotor activity (LMA), which correlates with neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) pathology, hyperphosphorylated tau levels, and brain atrophy. To further clarify the relationship between these endpoints, we treated the rTg4510 mice with either doxycycline to reduce mutant tau expression or an O-GlcNAcase inhibitor Thiamet G, which has been shown to ameliorate tau pathology in animal models. We found that both doxycycline and Thiamet G treatments starting at 2 months of age prevented the progression of hyperactivity, slowed brain atrophy, and reduced brain hyperphosphorylated tau. In contrast, initiating doxycycline treatment at 4 months reduced neither brain hyperphosphorylated tau nor hyperactivity, further confirming the relationship between these measures. Collectively, our results demonstrate a unique behavioral phenotype in the rTg4510 mouse model of tauopathy that strongly correlates with disease progression, and that early interventions which reduce tau pathology ameliorate the progression of the locomotor dysfunction. These findings suggest that better understanding the relationship between locomotor deficits and tau pathology in the rTg4510 model may improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying behavioral disturbances in patients with tauopathies."
https://openalex.org/W2796028914,"Dasypus is the most speciose genus of the order Cingulata, including approximately 40% of known living armadillos. Nine species are currently recognized, although comprehensive analyses of the entire genus have never been done. Our aim is to revise the taxonomy of the long-nosed armadillos and properly define the taxa. We examined 2126 specimens of Dasypus preserved in 39 different museum collections, including 17 type specimens. Three complementary methods were applied to explore morphological datasets both qualitatively and quantitatively. Qualitative morphological variation in discrete characters was assessed by direct observations of specimens. Linear morphometric variation was based on external data and cranial measurements of 887 adult skulls. The shape and size of the skull was abstracted through two-dimensional geometric morphometric analyses of dorsal, lateral and ventral views of respectively 421, 211, and 220 adult specimens. Our results converge on the recognition of eight living species (D. beniensis, D. kappleri, D. mazzai, D. novemcinctus, D. pastasae, D. pilosus, D. sabanicola, and D. septemcinctus), and three subspecies of D. septemcinctus (D. s. septemcinctus, D. s. hybridus, and a new subspecies from Cordoba described here).

WoRMS is a unique database: there is no comparable global database for marine species, which is driven by a large, global expert community, is supported by a Data Management Team and can rely on a permanent host institute, dedicated to keeping WoRMS online. Over the past ten years, the content of WoRMS has grown steadily, and the system currently contains more than 242,000 accepted marine species. WoRMS has not yet reached completeness: approximately 2,000 newly described species per year are added, and editors also enter the remaining missing older names–both accepted and unaccepted–an effort amounting to approximately 20,000 taxon name additions per year. WoRMS is used extensively, through different channels, indicating that it is recognized as a high-quality database on marine species information. It is updated on a daily basis by its Editorial Board, which currently consists of 490 taxonomic and thematic experts located around the world. Owing to its unique qualities, WoRMS has become a partner in many large-scale initiatives including OBIS, LifeWatch and the Catalogue of Life, where it is recognized as a high-quality and reliable source of information for marine taxonomy."

https://openalex.org/W2795614648,"Chlamydia trachomatis urogenital serovars primarily replicate in epithelial cells lining the reproductive tract. Epithelial cells recognize Chlamydia through cell surface and cytosolic receptors, and/or endosomal innate receptors such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Activation of these receptors triggers both innate and adaptive immune mechanisms that are required for chlamydial clearance, but are also responsible for the immunopathology in the reproductive tract. We previously demonstrated that Chlamydia muridarum (Cm) induces IFN-β in oviduct epithelial cells (OE) in a TLR3-dependent manner, and that the synthesis of several cytokines and chemokines are diminished in Cm-challenged OE derived from TLR3-/- 129S1 mice. Furthermore, our in vitro studies showed that Cm replication in TLR3-/- OE is more efficient than in wild-type OE. Because TLR3 modulates the release inflammatory mediators involved in host defense during Cm infection, we hypothesized that TLR3 plays a protective role against Cm-induced genital tract pathology in congenic C57BL/6N mice. Using the Cm mouse model for human Chlamydia genital tract infections, we demonstrated that TLR3-/- mice had increased Cm shedding during early and mid-stage genital infection. In early stage infection, TLR3-/- mice showed a diminished synthesis of IFN-β, IL-1β, and IL-6, but enhanced production of IL-10, TNF-α, and IFN-γ. In mid-stage infection, TLR3-/- mice exhibited significantly enhanced lymphocytic endometritis and salpingitis than wild-type mice. These lymphocytes were predominantly scattered along the endometrial stroma and the associated smooth muscle, and the lamina propria supporting the oviducts. Surprisingly, our data show that CD4+ T-cells are significantly enhanced in the genital tract TLR3-/- mice during mid-stage Chlamydial infection. In late-stage infections, both mouse strains developed hydrosalpinx; however, the extent of hydrosalpinx was more severe in TLR3-/- mice. Together, these data suggest that TLR3 promotes the clearance of Cm during early and mid-stages of genital tract infection, and that loss of TLR3 is detrimental in the development hydrosalpinx."
https://openalex.org/W2796021780,"Platelets are recruited to sites of vascular injury, where they are activated and aggregate to form a hemostatic plug. This process requires the activation of the small GTPase Rap1B by its cognate guanine nucleotide exchange factor CalDAG-GEFI. Studies on platelet function suggest that CalDAG-GEFI activity is regulated by changes in cytosolic calcium, but the exact molecular mechanism is poorly understood. Here we show that purified CalDAG-GEFI is autoinhibited and directly regulated by calcium. Substitutions of putative calcium-binding residues within the canonical EF hands of CalDAG-GEFI diminish its capacity to activate Rap1B. Structural differences between active (WT) and inactive (EF hand variant) CalDAG-GEFI protein were determined by hydrogen–deuterium exchange MS. The highest differential rates of deuterium uptake in WT over EF hand variant CalDAG-GEFI were observed in regions within the catalytic Cdc25 domain and a putative autoinhibitory linker connecting the Cdc25 and EF hand domains. Exchange activity in the EF hand variant was fully restored by an additional substitution, valine 406 to glutamate, which is thought to disrupt the interface between the autoinhibitory linker and the Cdc25 domain.

The data from this study are the first evidence linking CalDAG-GEFI activity directly to calcium. Human survival depends on our ability to prevent blood loss at sites of vascular injury. Upon damage to the endothelial lining, blood platelets detect exposed extracellular matrix and locally produced thrombin, become activated, and form a hemostatic plug. Critical to plug formation is the engagement of αIIbβ3 integrins on the cell surface, a process that depends on the inside-out signaling to these receptors (1Shattil S.J. Kim C. Ginsberg M.H. The final steps of integrin activation: the end game.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 10.1038/nrm2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). Given the unique high-shear environment found in blood vessels, signal transduction in platelets leading to integrin inside-out activation has been optimized for sensitivity and speed. Upon receptor stimulation, the second messenger calcium is rapidly released from the dense tubule system. Calcium also enters through channels in the plasma membrane, effectively increasing intracellular calcium concentrations 50-fold. Calcium plays an important role in the activation of αIIbβ3. Integrin activation also depends strongly on the focal adhesion proteins talin-1 and kindlin-3 as well as the small GTPase Ras-related protein (Rap) 1 (1Shattil S.J. Kim C. Ginsberg M.H.

EF hands are composed of pairs of helices that typically bind calcium using acid residues within the intervening loop. These residues are defined by their relative positions (1, 3, 5, and 12), and position 12 in particular is a highly conserved glutamate that coordinates calcium through bidentate interactions. Mutating this glutamate cripples calcium binding (9Declercq J.-P. Evrard C. Lamzin V. Parello J.

Calcium binding generally leads to major conformational changes in the EF hands and other regions of the protein (11Lewit-Bentley A. Réty S. EF-hand calcium-binding proteins.Curr. Opin. Struct.

Our functional studies in platelets suggested that calcium is involved the regulation of CalDAG-GEFI activity (12Stefanini L. Roden R.C. Bergmeier W. CalDAG-GEFI is at the nexus of calcium-dependent platelet activation.Blood. 2009; 114 (19628710): 2506-251410.1182/blood-2009-04-218768Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In this work, we present biochemical evidence that both EF hands contribute to CalDAG-GEFI activation and that this requires calcium. Hydrogen–deuterium exchange MS studies further suggest that calcium binding induces global conformational changes within CalDAG-GEFI, most prominently in the EF hands and a putative autoinhibitory linker sequence connecting the EF hands and Cdc25 domain. Analysis of different mutant forms of CalDAG-GEFI confirms that the linker is important for autoinhibiting CalDAG-GEFI in the absence of calcium. Thus, our work provides the first evidence that CalDAG-GEFI activity is directly regulated by calcium and that release of autoinhibition is the molecular mechanism underlying CalDAG-GEFI activation. Previous studies using isothermal titration calorimetry determined that the isolated EF hands of CalDAG-GEFI (amino acid residues 417–495) bind calcium with very high affinity (Kd ∼80 nm) (13Iwig J.S. Vercoulen Y. Das R. Barros T. Limnander A. Che Y. Pelton J.G. Wemmer D.E. Roose J.P. Kuriyan J. Structural analysis of autoinhibition in the Ras-specific exchange factor RasGRP1.eLife. 2013; 2 (23908768): e00813Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To determine whether calcium affects catalytic activity in full-length CalDAG-GEFI, we established a cell-free nucleotide exchange assay using purified human CalDAG-GEFI and Rap1B proteins. Purified CalDAG-GEFI (amino acid residues 1–551, WT) was slightly truncated at the C terminus to increase protein stability. Rap1B (amino acid residues 1–181) was purified with a substitution, cysteine 181 to serine, to increase solubility (Fig. 1A). Purification was performed using affinity and size exclusion chromatography. Proteins were >95% pure as confirmed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B, inset). Proteins were stable at 4 °C for up to 15 h. Compared with Rap1B alone, exchange activity increased by ∼16-fold in samples containing Rap1B and CalDAG-GEFI. Of note, exchange activity was not altered by addition of free calcium (data not shown). However, treatment of CalDAG-GEFI with 20 mm EGTA, a calcium-selective chelator, dramatically reduced catalytic activity. Importantly, exchange activity was restored upon addition of 10 mm free calcium, demonstrating that the loss of activity in EGTA-treated samples was not due to protein instability (Fig. 1B). These studies suggested that CalDAG-GEFI was purified in a calcium-bound state and that chelation of calcium crippled its capacity for nucleotide exchange. To determine whether and how the individual EF hands regulate CalDAG-GEFI activity, we mutated a key residue in the calcium binding loops (Fig. 2A). Substitutions of glutamic acid at position 12 in the calcium binding loop of EF hands has been shown to reduce the binding affinity for calcium by over 100-fold (14Cates M.S. Berry M.B. Ho E.L. Li Q. Potter J.D. Phillips G.N.

Glutamic acid substitution for alanine at position 450 in the N-terminal EF hand (EF1) or position 479 in the C-terminal EF hand (EF2) markedly decreased nucleotide exchange toward Rap1B. Catalytic activity was restored by adding increasing concentrations of calcium in EF2, whereas only partial recovery was observed in EF1. Catalytic activity in the double EF hand mutant (EF1+2) could not be restored (Fig. 2A). These data provide strong evidence that calcium binding to EF1 is essential for exchange activity in CalDAG-GEFI, whereas EF2 is important but not essential in this process. To validate our in vitro findings in a cellular context, we studied agonist-induced Rap1 activation in human embryonic kidney 293T cells expressing WT or EF1+2 CalDAG-GEFI (Fig. 2B). Cellular stimulation with epidermal growth factor (EGF) led to a significant increase in Rap1-GTP levels in cells expressing WT CalDAG-GEFI. In contrast, Rap1 activation was not observed in EGF-stimulated cells expressing EF1+2 CalDAG-GEFI. We next performed hydrogen–deuterium exchange MS experiments (HDX-MS) to determine the differences in deuterium uptake between WT and EF1+2 proteins. Measuring the rate of deuterium uptake defines the stability of hydrogen bond networks between residues stabilizing secondary structures in proteins as well as residues that are more solvent-accessible (16Konermann L. Pan J. Liu Y.-H. Hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry for studying protein structure and dynamics.Chem. Soc.

Investigating Solution-Phase Protein Structure and Dynamics by Hydrogen Exchange Mass Spectrometry.Curr. Protoc. Protein Sci. 2010; 10.1002/0471140864.ps1706s58Google Scholar). The most stable hydrogen bonds have the slowest exchange, whereas more dynamic regions exchange faster. WT and EF1+2 proteins were exposed to deuterated water for a designated amount of time and then quenched and digested for mass spectrometric analysis. We recovered 326 peptides from the WT sample and 329 from the EF1+2 sample, with complete coverage of both samples. The relative difference in deuterium uptake was represented in a heat map to highlight the regions with slowest (Fig. 3A, dark blue) and fastest (Fig. 3A, red) deuterium exchange. WT and EF1+2 showed unique deuterium exchange signatures, suggesting conformational differences between the active and the apo form of the protein. A more than 5% difference in uptake between two samples is considered significant (17Morgan C.R. Engen J.R. Investigating Solution-Phase Protein Structure and Dynamics by Hydrogen Exchange Mass Spectrometry.Curr. Protoc. Protein Sci. 2010; 10.1002/0471140864.ps1706s58Google Scholar). Deuterium uptake in a putative autoinhibitory region linking the Cdc25 domain and EF1 was markedly higher in the WT sample (23 and 25%, respectively) (Fig. 3A). Different regions had more than 12% higher rates of exchange in WT compared with EF1+2 (Fig. 3B), including a small portion of the REM domain (19%), the Cdc25-Rap1B interface (20%), and the EF hands (17%). Displacement of the linker in response to calcium binding would provide a likely explanation for the very fast deuterium exchange rates measured for the residues comprising the Cdc25 domain-Rap1B interface in the WT protein. We next determined critical residues within the putative autoinhibitory linker region using a homology model of inactive CalDAG-GEFI, based on predictions by the Iterative Threading Assembly Refinement (I-TASSER) server (for more details, see “Experimental Procedures”). We identified amino acids 406–410 (VLEEW) as the residues that insert directly into the Rap1B binding groove (Fig. 4, A and B). This region of the linker is fully conserved in all mammals. To test whether displacement of this linker is sufficient to activate CalDAG-GEFI, we purified both WT and EF1+2 protein with an additional substitution, a valine 406 for glutamic acid, and tested the capacity of these proteins for nucleotide exchange toward Rap1B. We selected to substitute valine 406, as our homology model suggested a key role for this residue in anchoring the autoinhibitory linker in the Rap1 binding groove. Consistent with this conclusion, the V406E mutation completely restored catalytic activity in EF1+2 CalDAG-GEFI, suggesting that the autoinhibitory linker was displaced in this mutant in absence of bound calcium (Fig. 4C). The V406E mutation had a weaker effect in the WT protein, where nucleotide exchange activity was still markedly impaired in the presence of EGTA (Fig. 4D). These studies suggest that the interaction of V406 with the Cdc25 domain contributes to the autoinhibited state of CalDAG-GEFI. The four members of the CalDAG-GEF (RasGRP) family are critical for the proper function of different blood cell types (18Stone J.C. Regulation and function of the RasGRP family of Ras activators in blood cells.Genes Cancer. 2011; 2 (21779502): 320-33410.1177/1947601911408082Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). They all possess a characteristic domain structure with an N-terminal REM/Cdc25 catalytic domain and a C-terminal regulatory domain consisting of a pair of EF hands and a C1 domain. In this work, we investigated the mechanistic details by which calcium affects nucleotide exchange activity in CalDAG-GEFI, a key regulator of Rap1 signaling in platelets. Compared with CalDAG-GEFII (RasGRP1), the best studied family member, CalDAG-GEFI shows significant differences in the Cdc25 catalytic domain and the EF hand and C1 regulatory domains. CalDAG-GEFII is a RasGEF that exists as a dimer in solution. Binding of diacylglycerol (DAG) to its C1 domain is critical for dimer release and, thus, CalDAG-GEFII function. In contrast, CalDAG-GEFI is primarily a Rap-GEF, does not dimerize, and does not contain a typical DAG-binding C1 domain. There are also significant differences with regard to the EF hand regulatory domain; while CalDAG-GEFII contains only one active, low-affinity (Kd > 1 μM) EF hand, CalDAG-GEFI contains two fully functional EF hands with high affinity for calcium (Kd < 100 nm) (13Iwig J.S. Vercoulen Y. Das R. Barros T. Limnander A. Che Y. Pelton J.G. Wemmer D.E. Roose J.P. Kuriyan J. Structural analysis of autoinhibition in the Ras-specific exchange factor RasGRP1.eLife. 2013; 2 (23908768): e00813Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The high affinity for calcium is consistent with the documented role of CalDAG-GEFI in the rapid, calcium-dependent activation of Rap1 and integrin αIIbβ3 that is required for platelet adhesion under shear stress conditions (12Stefanini L. Roden R.C. Bergmeier W. CalDAG-GEFI is at the nexus of calcium-dependent platelet activation.Blood. 2009; 114 (19628710): 2506-251410.1182/blood-2009-04-218768Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Using biochemical and biophysical approaches, we demonstrate that both EF hands are critical for CalDAG-GEFI function, and we provide evidence that calcium binding induces global conformational changes in CalDAG-GEFI, most prominently in an autoinhibitory linker region that prevents Rap1 binding to the Cdc25 domain in the absence of calcium. Our data suggest a straightforward model for the regulation of CalDAG-GEFI exchange activity (Fig. 5). In circulating platelets with low intracellular levels of calcium, CalDAG-GEFI is in an autoinhibited state, stabilized by the linker region between the Cdc25 domain and the EF hands. This linker blocks the catalytic surface of the Cdc25 domain so that it cannot engage Rap1B. Upon an external stimulus that raises intracellular levels of calcium, the EF hands bind calcium and change conformation. These conformational changes are coupled to movement of the autoinhibitory linker that reveals the catalytic surface needed to engage Rap1B. After Rap1B binding and GTP-for-GDP exchange, the complex dissociates freeing GTP-bound Rap1B to engage downstream effectors. Based on isothermal titration calorimetry experiments, the individual EF hands of CalDAG-GEFI bind one calcium ion with high affinity (Kd ∼80 nm) (13Iwig J.S. Vercoulen Y. Das R. Barros T. Limnander A. Che Y. Pelton J.G. Wemmer D.E. Roose J.P. Kuriyan J. Structural analysis of autoinhibition in the Ras-specific exchange factor RasGRP1.eLife. 2013; 2 (23908768): e00813Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This result strongly suggests that the two EF hand domains may act in concert to activate CalDAG-GEFI. Indeed, disabling either EF hand markedly impaired the exchange activity. Addition of free calcium in a dose-dependent manner restored exchange activity in the EF2 mutant. In contrast, only a partial recovery of function was observed for the EF1 mutant. Disabling both EF hands in CalDAG-GEFI rendered CalDAG-GEFI unresponsive to calcium. These studies suggest that EF2 is critical for high-affinity calcium binding, whereas EF1 is important for inducing conformational changes required for CalDAG-GEFI catalytic activity. Regulating activity via high-affinity binding to calcium explains perfectly why CalDAG-GEFI plays such a crucial role in platelet function. Platelets circulate at high velocity in the blood stream, patrolling the vasculature for breaches in the endothelial lining. To fulfill their hemostatic function, platelets need to be able to sense minute changes in their environment and to rapidly change from an anti-adhesive to a pro-adhesive state. Even weak platelet agonists such as ADP cause rapid and significant changes in cytoplasmic calcium. CalDAG-GEFI can quickly integrate this calcium signal and mediate a near-immediate activation of Rap1 and αIIbβ3 integrin. However, such high sensitivity to calcium also poses a challenge, as unwanted CalDAG-GEFI activation could lead to premature platelet activation and thrombosis. In fact, one would expect that, if CalDAG-GEFI binds calcium at such high affinity, then a large pool of CalDAG-GEFI would be activated in resting, circulating platelets. Thus, additional regulatory mechanisms must be in play to prevent unwanted platelet activation. One important mechanism that would offset CalDAG-GEFI signals is negative regulation by RASA3, a Rap-GAP highly expressed in the platelet membrane. In mice, loss of RASA3 function leads to platelet preactivation, rapid platelet clearance, and severe thrombocytopenia because of unbalanced CalDAG-GEFI signaling (4Stefanini L. Paul D.S. Robledo R.F. Chan E.R. Getz T.M. Campbell R.A. Kechele D.O. Casari C. Piatt R. Caron K.M. Mackman N. Weyrich A.S. Parrott M.C. Boulaftali Y. Adams M.D. et al.RASA3 is a critical inhibitor of RAP1-dependent platelet activation.J. Clin. Invest. 2015; 125 (25705885): 1419-143210.1172/JCI77993Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). It is also possible that CalDAG-GEFI function depends on more than just calcium binding to its EF hands. For example, the C1-like domain may provide additional regulatory activity. Within the CalDAG-GEF family, CalDAG-GEFI is the only member that contains an atypical C1 domain with very low affinity for diacylglycerol (Kd ∼ 2 μm versus Kd ∼ 5 nm for the other family members) (19Czikora A.

Barros T. Limnander A. Che Y. Pelton J.G. Wemmer D.E. Roose J.P. Kuriyan J. Structural analysis of autoinhibition in the Ras-specific exchange factor RasGRP1.eLife. 2013; 2 (23908768): e00813Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) demonstrated that DAG binding to the C1 domain in CalDAG-GEFII is important to release C1 domain dimerization, causing protein translocation to the membrane. In contrast, CalDAG-GEFI is a monomer, and platelets lacking CalDAG-GEFI aggregate normally in response to stimulation with phorbol ester (5Crittenden J.R. Bergmeier W. Zhang Y. Piffath C.L. Liang Y. Wagner D.D. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M. CalDAG-GEFI integrates signaling for platelet aggregation and thrombus formation.Nat. Med. 2004; 10 (15334074): 982-98610.1038/nm1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), a DAG mimetic that engages typical C1 domains. However, platelets expressing a truncated CalDAG-GEFI lacking the C1 domain are defective in their integrin activation and aggregation responses (20Stolla M. Stefanini L. Roden R.C. Chavez M. Hirsch J. Greene T. Ouellette T.D. Maloney S.F. Diamond S.L. Poncz M. Woulfe D.S. Bergmeier W. The kinetics of αIIbβ3 activation determines the size and stability of thrombi in mice: implications for antiplatelet therapy.Blood. 2011; 117 (20971951): 1005-101310.1182/blood-2010-07-297713Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Thus, the C1 domain clearly plays a role in CalDAG-GEFI function, but further studies will be required to unravel the underlying molecular mechanism(s). The comparison of hydrogen–deuterium exchange profiles for active (WT) and inactive (EF1+2) CalDAG-GEFI provides important structural insights into how GEF activity is regulated by binding of calcium. Central to this regulation are the autoinhibitory linker and the EF hands. The autoinhibitory linker is bracketed by residues with some of the largest deuterium uptake differentials between the active and crippled forms of CalDAG-GEFI. Furthermore, the regions of the Cdc25 domain critical for GEF activity, based on the homology model, also showed markedly increased deuterium uptake in the active protein compared with the EF1+2 mutant. These differences support the contention that the autoinhibitory linker moves away from the catalytic surface of the Cdc25 domain upon engagement of the EF hands by calcium. The fact that substitution of valine 406, centered within the autoinhibitory linker, is sufficient to fully rescue the exchange capacity of the EF1+2 mutant strongly supports our interpretation of the HDX data. Our studies with the WT V406E mutant further suggest that residues in the vicinity of valine 406 contribute to stabilizing the autoinhibitory linker in the Rap1 binding groove. At this point, we can only speculate why the EF1+2 mutant is more sensitive to introduction of the V406E mutant. We observed that, in the presence of EGTA, the EF1+2 mutant has a higher exchange activity relative to the WT protein (data not shown). This finding may suggest that the point mutations in the EF hands have a minimal effect on the structure of the protein, slightly increasing exchange activity. Introduction of the V406E mutation then shifts the protein into a conformation that allows full activity in our cell-free assay. In the WT protein, introduction of the V406E mutation has a milder effect. It is interesting that additional regions of CalDAG-GEFI also exhibit differential hydrogen–deuterium exchange. These regions include portions of the REM domain, the region between REM and Cdc25 domains, and portions of the C1 domain. Presumably, the calcium-dependent activation of CalDAG-GEFI is initiated by structural alterations within the EF hands, but these alterations consequently propagate throughout the protein. The functional effect of these additional alterations should be determined in future work, as there is precedent in Sos1 that the REM and Cdc25 domains cooperate to activate Ras (21Margarit S.M. Sondermann H. Hall B.E. Nagar B. Hoelz A. Pirruccello M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Structural evidence for feedback activation by Ras·GTP of the Ras-specific nucleotide exchange factor SOS.Cell. 2003; 112 (12628188): 685-69510.1016/S0092-8674(03)00149-1Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, the autoinhibitory linker might be expected to contain the highest differences in hydrogen–deuterium exchange based on the proposed model. However, this is not the case, suggesting that it is not completely disordered upon calcium-dependent activation. Instead, it seems likely that this region adopts an alternative, stable conformation upon calcium binding, perhaps interacting with the EF hands themselves. Taken together, our data provide mechanistic insight into the functional consequences of calcium binding to the EF hands of CalDAG-GEFI and the structural rearrangements required for GEF activity to occur. These findings will be important in our understanding of how mutations in patients impair CalDAG-GEFI function and in efforts to design inhibitors of CalDAG-GEFI signaling.

The gene was PCR-amplified using primers introducing a stop at position 1653 in the nucleotide sequence. The complementary DNA was subcloned into a p15LIC2 bacterial expression vector. The expressed protein, CalDAG-GEFI (1–551), contained all functional domains plus an N-terminal His6 tag required for purification. Cloning was performed according to a ligation-independent cloning protocol. CalDAG-GEFI (1–551) EF hand mutant EF1 was made by substituting glutamic acid to alanine at position 450. EF hand mutant EF2 was made by substituting glutamic acid to alanine at position 479. The EF hand double mutant EF1+2 was made by substituting glutamic acid to alanine at positions 450 and 479. The EF hand linker mutant EF1+2+V406 was made by substituting valine to glutamic acid at position 406 using EF1+2 complementary DNA for the PCR template. All mutations were carried out using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer’s protocol. CalDAG-GEFI proteins were expressed in a Rosetta strain of Escherichia coli (Novagen). Cell cultures were grown at 37 °C in lysogeny broth, 0.5 μm ZnSO4, 50 μg/ml ampicillin, and chloramphenicol. Protein expression was induced by addition of 500 μm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and cells were incubated for 15 h at 20 °C.

Cell pellets were lysed using an Emulsiflex C5 cell homogenizer (Avestin) and clarified by ultracentrifugation at 45,000 rpm for 45 min at 4 °C. Filtered supernatant was applied to a HisTrap HP affinity column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer A (20 mm PIPES (pH 6.8), 300 mm NaCl, 8 mm imidazole, and 5% glycerol). Protein was eluted from the column with 400 mm imidazole using buffer B (20 mm PIPES (pH 6.8), 300 mm NaCl, 1 m imidazole, and 5% glycerol). Peak fractions were collected, treated with tobacco etch virus protease overnight at 4 °C and dialyzed in buffer A without imidazole. A second pass over the HisTrap HP affinity column removed the cleaved His tag and tobacco etch virus protease from the sample. Flow-through fractions were concentrated using a Vivaspin column (Sartoris) with a 10,000 molecular weight cutoff filter and then loaded onto a Superdex 200 10/300 size exclusion column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with S200 size exclusion buffer containing 20 mm PIPES (pH 6.8), 300 mm NaCl, and 4 mm DTT. The final protein product was 95% pure, monomeric, and concentrated to 20 mg/ml. Aliquots were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Human Rap1B (1–181) C181S was cloned into the pProEXHtb vector and purified from E. coli. 500 μm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was used to induce protein expression, and cultures were incubated for 8 h at 20 °C. Protein purification was done using the same chromatography steps as for CalDAG-GEFI proteins listed above with buffer modifications, substituting the PIPES buffer with Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 1 μm ZnSO4 with 5 mm MgCl2, and adding 50 μm GDP to protein lysis buffer. Nucleotide exchange on Rap1B was measured using a fluorescence-based assay as described previously (22Ren J. Cook A.A. Bergmeier W. Sondek J.

The reaction buffer contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 5% glycerol, and 0.004% NP-40. Reactions were performed in a black-bottom 96-well plate (Corning). The fluorescent signal was measured using a Pherastar microplate reader (BMG Labtech) (wavelength excitation/emission = 480/520 nm and 1-nm slits). For calcium chelation experiments, 100 μm CalDAG-GEFI was treated with 10 mm EGTA for 2 h at 4 °C. The sample was spun at 4,000 rpm for 30 s and then transferred to a new tube containing reaction buffer, diluting calcium-free CalDAG-GEFI to 400 nm. Samples were treated with 10 mm calcium where indicated. Rap1B pulldown experiments were performed as described recently (12Stefanini L. Roden R.C. Bergmeier W. CalDAG-GEFI is at the nexus of calcium-dependent platelet activation.Blood. 2009; 114 (19628710): 2506-251410.1182/blood-2009-04-218768Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). HDX-MS experiments on WT CalDAG-GEFI and EF1+2 were performed using an Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC) HDX system coupled with a Q-Tof Premier mass spectrometer (Waters Corp., Milford, MA) as described previously (23Deng W. Wang Y. Druzak S.A. Healey J.F. Syed A.K. Lollar P. Li R. A discontinuous autoinhibitory module masks the A1 domain of von Willebrand factor.J. Thromb.

Briefly, each protein sample was buffer-exchanged into PBS and then diluted to 1.5 mg/ml. 1 μl of sample was diluted 1:7 (v/v) in 10 mm phosphate, 99.9% D2O, pD 7.0 at 20 °C using a robotic autosampler to initiate hydrogen–deuterium exchange. Exchange reactions were quenched after 0.01, 0.15, 1.6, 16, and 166 min by placing them at 1 °C and adding an equal volume of precooled quenching buffer (100 mm phosphate, 0.5 m tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, 0.8% formic acid, and 2% acetonitrile (pH 2.5)). Each sample and each time point were done in replicates of six. Samples from each time point were fragmented through a Waters Enzymate BEH pepsin column, and the peptic fragments were separated on an in-line C18 HPLC column and then analyzed by MS. Mass assignment for each peptide without HDX was inspected manually; any assignment with a mass deviation >0.2 Da was removed. The extent of deuterium incorporation in each peptide was calculated and tabulated using the Waters software. The relative fractional deuterium uptake is represented as a heat map and was measured for each peptide by calculating the number of residues that exchange an amide proton for deuterium over the total number of protons that are able to exchange (peptide length −1) and averaged for each time point. The homology model of CalDAG-GEFI was built using the I-TASSER server available to academic researchers through the Zhang laboratory at the University of Michigan. I-TASSER generated our model by comparing the protein sequence of CalDAG-GEFI with protein sequences of all proteins that have crystal or cryo-EM structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank. These structures were used as templates to predict secondary structures in CalDAG-GEFI based on sequence homology to the template sequence. In addition, the sequence in CalDAG-GEFI lacking a template, typically disordered loop regions, was modeled ab initio as secondary structures having the lowest free energy. I-TASSER predicted five homology models of CalDAG-GEFI, ranked in order from highest to lowest probability; we chose the highest probable model. A. A. C., J. S., and W. B. conceptualization; A. A.

https://openalex.org/W2796422457,"Living animal cells are strongly influenced by the mechanical properties of their environment. To model physiological conditions ultrasoft cell culture substrates, in some instances with elasticity (Young's modulus) of only 1 kPa, are mandatory. Due to their long shelf life PDMS-based elastomers are a popular choice. However, uncertainty about additives in commercial formulations and difficulties to reach very soft materials limit their use. Here, we produced silicone elastomers from few, chemically defined and commercially available substances. Elastomers exhibited elasticities in the range from 1 kPa to 55 kPa. In detail, a high molecular weight (155 kg/mol), vinyl-terminated linear silicone was crosslinked with a multifunctional (f = 51) crosslinker (a copolymer of dimethyl siloxane and hydrosilane) by a platinum catalyst. The following different strategies towards ultrasoft materials were explored: sparse crosslinking, swelling with inert silicone polymers, and, finally, deliberate introduction of dangling ends into the network (inhibition). Rheological experiments with very low frequencies led to precise viscoelastic characterizations. All strategies enabled tuning of stiffness with the lowest stiffness of ~1 kPa reached by inhibition. This system was also most practical to use. Biocompatibility of materials was tested using primary cortical neurons from rats. Even after several days of cultivation no adverse effects were found."

It plays a role in processes such as bone formation and retinal neovascularization, and importantly, its expression in human cancers correlates with disease stage and poor prognosis. Functionally, ADAM9 can cleave several transmembrane proteins, thereby shedding their ectodomains from the cell surface. Moreover, ADAM9 regulates cell behavior by binding cell-surface receptors such as integrin and membrane-type matrix metalloproteases. Because these functions are mainly restricted to the cell surface, understanding the mechanisms regulating ADAM9 localization and activity at this site is highly important. To this end, we here investigated how intracellular trafficking regulates ADAM9 availability at the cell surface. We found that ADAM9 undergoes constitutive clathrin-dependent internalization and subsequent degradation or recycling to the plasma membrane. We confirmed previous findings of an interaction between ADAM9 and the intracellular sorting protein, sorting nexin 9 (SNX9), as well as its close homolog SNX18. Knockdown of either SNX9 or SNX18 had no apparent effects on ADAM9 internalization or recycling. However, double knockdown of SNX9 and SNX18 decreased ADAM9 internalization significantly, demonstrating a redundant role in this process. Moreover, SNX9 knockdown revealed a nonredundant effect on overall ADAM9 protein levels, resulting in increased ADAM9 levels at the cell surface, and a corresponding increase in the shedding of Ephrin receptor B4, a well-known ADAM9 substrate. Together, our findings demonstrate that intracellular SNX9-mediated trafficking constitutes an important ADAM9 regulatory pathway.

Cardiac implantable electronic devices used for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) may detect sleep apnea by use of a transthoracic impedance sensor. Validation of the AP scan® algorithm (Boston Scientific®) was performed by using the diagnostic gold standard polysomnography (PSG). Methods Forty-one patients with impaired left ventricular ejection fraction, frequent right ventricular pacing due to atrioventricular block and heart failure symptoms despite optimal medical therapy underwent upgrading to biventricular pacing. Within one month after left ventricular lead implantation, sleep apnea was assessed by single-night PSG and AP scan® measurements. Results AP scan® measurements were valid in only 21 of 41 (51.2%) patients in the index night of the PSG. The PSG determined apnea-hypopnea index did not correlate statistically significant with the AP scan® measurements (r = 0.41, 95% confidence interval -0.05–0.72, p = 0.07). The degree of overestimation is displayed by using the Bland-Altman method: mean difference -12.4, standard deviation ± 15.8, 95% confidence interval -43.3–18.6. Conclusions In heart failure patients receiving CRT upgrading, the AP scan® algorithm may need further improvement before it can be recommended for sleep apnea detection."

Previously, we found that osteochondroma formation in mouse models is preceded by ectopic bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling in the perichondrium, but the mechanistic relationships between BMP signaling and HS deficiency remain unclear. Therefore, we used an HS antagonist (surfen) to investigate the effects of this HS interference on BMP signaling, ligand availability, cell-surface BMP receptor (BMPR) dynamics, and BMPR interactions in Ad-293 and C3H/10T1/2 cells. As observed previously, the HS interference rapidly increased phosphorylated SMAD family member 1/5/8 levels. FACS analysis and immunoblots revealed that the cells possessed appreciable levels of endogenous cell-surface BMP2/4 that were unaffected by the HS antagonist, suggesting that BMP2/4 proteins remained surface-bound but became engaged in BMPR interactions and SMAD signaling. Indeed, surface mobility of SNAP-tagged BMPRII, measured by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), was modulated during the drug treatment. This suggested that the receptors had transitioned to lipid rafts acting as signaling centers, confirmed for BMPRII via ultracentrifugation to separate membrane subdomains. In situ proximity ligation assays disclosed that the HS interference rapidly stimulates BMPRI–BMPRII interactions, measured by oligonucleotide-driven amplification signals. Our in vitro studies reveal that cell-associated HS controls BMP ligand availability and BMPR dynamics, interactions, and signaling, and largely restrains these processes. We propose that HS deficiency in HME may lead to extensive local BMP signaling and altered BMPR dynamics, triggering excessive cellular responses and osteochondroma formation.

https://openalex.org/W2795778257,"The spatial heterogeneity of soil respiration and its temperature sensitivity pose a great challenge to accurately estimate the carbon flux in global carbon cycling, which has primarily been researched in flatlands versus hillslope ecosystems. On an eroded slope (35°) of the semiarid Loess Plateau, soil respiration, soil moisture and soil temperature were measured in situ at upper and lower slope positions in triplicate from 2014 until 2016, and the soil biochemical and microbial properties were determined. The results showed that soil respiration was significantly greater (by 44.2%) at the lower slope position (2.6 μmol m–2 s–1) than at the upper slope position, as were soil moisture, carbon, nitrogen fractions and root biomass. However, the temperature sensitivity was 13.2% greater at the upper slope position than at the lower slope position (P < 0.05). The soil fungal community changed from being Basidiomycota-dominant at the upper slope position to being Zygomycota-dominant at the lower slope position, corresponding with increased β-D-glucosidase activity at the upper slope position than at the lower slope position. We concluded that soil respiration was enhanced by the greater soil moisture, root biomass, carbon and nitrogen contents at the lower slope position than at the upper slope position. Moreover, the increased soil respiration and decreased temperature sensitivity at the lower slope position were partially due to copiotrophs replacing oligotrophs. Such spatial variations along slopes must be properly accounted for when estimating the carbon budget and feedback of future climate change on hillslope ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2796016544,"Agricultural crops play an important role in the global carbon and water cycle. Global climate change scenarios predict enhanced water scarcity and altered precipitation pattern in many parts of the world. Hence, a mechanistic understanding of water fluxes, productivity and water use efficiency of cultivated crops is of major importance, i.e. to adapt management practices. We compared water and carbon fluxes of paddy and rainfed rice by canopy scale gas exchange measurements, crop growth, daily evapotranspiration, transpiration and carbon flux modeling. Throughout a monsoon rice growing season, soil evaporation in paddy rice contributed strongly to evapotranspiration (96.6% to 43.3% from initial growth to fully developed canopy and amounted to 57.9% of total water losses over the growing seasons. Evaporation of rainfed rice was significantly lower (by 65% on average) particularly before canopy closure. Water use efficiency (WUE) was significantly higher in rainfed rice both from an agronomic (WUEagro, i.e. grain yield per evapotranspiration) and ecosystem (WUEeco, i.e. gross primary production per evapotranspiration) perspective. However, our results also show that higher WUE in rainfed rice comes at the expense of higher respiration losses compared to paddy rice (26% higher on average). Hence, suggestions on water management depend on the regional water availability (i.e. Mediterranean vs. Monsoon climate) and the balance between higher respiratory losses versus a potential reduction in CH4 and other greenhouse gas emissions. Our results suggest that a shift from rainfed/unsaturated soil to waterlogged paddy conditions after closure of the rice canopy might be a good compromise towards a sustainable use of water while preserving grain yield, particularly for water-limited production areas."

In present study, a new strategy combining DNA barcoding techniques with thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was proposed to facilitate the identification and quality control of M. tenacissima. In present work, the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) barcode was successfully used to identify 58 M. tenacissima samples and its adulterants. TLC successfully identified the other three M. tenacissima samples that failed to produce ITS2 regions. An adulterant was found in all the 62 samples. Moreover, the content of active medicinal ingredients is important for herbal plants quality. The content of tenacissoside H (TS-H) of M. tenacissima samples was determined by HPLC to range from 0.39% to 1.09%, which meets the criterion of the Chinese Pharmacopoeia. Thus, DNA barcoding coupled with TLC and HPLC is very promising to identify and evaluate the quality of M. tenacissima in the medicine market."

GABA or benzodiazepine binding induces distinct conformational changes in the GABAAR. The molecular rearrangements in the GABAAR following benzodiazepine binding remain to be fully elucidated. Using two molecular models of the GABAAR, we identified electrostatic interactions between specific amino acids at the α–γ subunit interface that were broken by, or formed after, benzodiazepine binding. Using two-electrode voltage clamp electrophysiology in Xenopus laevis oocytes, we investigated these interactions by substituting one or both amino acids of each potential pair. We found that Lys104 in the α1 subunit forms an electrostatic bond with Asp75 of the γ2 subunit after benzodiazepine binding and that this bond stabilizes the positively modified state of the receptor. Substitution of these two residues to cysteine and subsequent covalent linkage between them increased the receptor's sensitivity to low GABA concentrations and decreased its response to benzodiazepines, producing a GABAAR that resembles a benzodiazepine-bound WT GABAAR. Breaking this bond restored sensitivity to GABA to WT levels and increased the receptor's response to benzodiazepines. The α1 Lys104 and γ2 Asp75 interaction did not play a role in ethanol or neurosteroid modulation of GABAAR, suggesting that different modulators induce different conformational changes in the receptor.

Here we report a long-term experiment mimicking a primordial competitive environment, in which yeast and bacteria co-exist and compete against each other. Eighteen yeasts covering a wide phylogenetic background spanning approximately 250 million years of evolutionary history were used to establish independent evolution lines for at most 130 passages. Our collection of hundreds of modified strains generated through such a rare two-species cross-kingdom competition experiment re-created the appearance of large-scale genomic rearrangements and altered phenotypes important in the diversification history of yeasts. At the same time, the methodology employed in this evolutionary study would also be a non-gene-technological method of reprogramming yeast genomes and then selecting yeast strains with desired traits. Cross-kingdom competition may therefore be a method of significant value to generate industrially useful yeast strains with new metabolic traits."
https://openalex.org/W2795685302,"The mechanical environment is a primary factor in the success of distraction osteogenesis. It is known that the interfragmentary movement during the distraction and maturation phase effects the callus formation. In addition to cyclic compression, other movements like shear and bending influence the bone formation process as shown in previous callus distraction studies. Reports of cartilage presence and endochondral ossification in the regenerative zone have been associated with a lack of fixation stability and delayed healing. So far the effects of the direction of interfragmentary movements could not be studied separately. By means of a unique lateral callus distraction model, we investigated the effects of small (0.1 mm) and moderate (0.6 mm), purely axial compression on ossification during callus maturation in sheep. A distraction device incorporating a mobile titanium plate was mounted on the tibia. Following lateral callus distraction, electromechanically controlled movements allowed purely axial cyclic compression of the tissue regenerate. Seven weeks post-operatively, the tissue regenerates were investigated using μCT, histology and immunohistochemistry. The larger amplitude significantly increased bone formation (Fractional bone volume: 19.4% vs. 5.2%, p = 0.03; trabecular thickness: 0.1 mm vs. 0.06 mm, p = 0.006; mean spicule height: 2.6 mm vs. 1.1 mm, p = 0.02) however, no endochondral ossification occurred. The elimination of shear movement, unimpaired neovascularization as well as the tensile strain stimuli during the distraction phase suppressing chondrogenic differentiation may all contribute to the absence of cartilage. In clinical application of distraction osteogenesis, moderate axial interfragmentary movement augments intramembranous ossification provided shear strain is minimized."
https://openalex.org/W2795911475,"Background Previous studies in Taiwan utilizing the Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Database (NHIRD) have estimated the direct healthcare costs of RA patients, but they have not focused on patients on bDMARDs, or considered patients’ response to therapy. Objectives The objective of this study was to estimate the rate of inadequate response for patients newly treated with biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) as well as their costs and resource use. Methods Data were from the catastrophic illness file within the NHIRD from 1/1/2009 to 12/31/2013. Patients with RA, which was categorized by the presence of a catastrophic illness card, that were previously bDMARD-naïve, were included in this study if they initiated their first bDMARD during the index period. The index period included all of 2010, a pre-index period consisting of the index date– 365 days, and a follow-up period including the index date to 365 days post-index, were also included. Previously biologically-naïve patients were indexed into the study on the date of their first claim for a bDMARD. A validated algorithm was used to examine the rate of inadequate response (IR) in the biologically-naïve cohort of patients. Inadequate responders met one or more of the following criteria during their year of follow-up: low adherence (proportion of days covered <0.80); switched to or added a second bDMARD; added a new conventional synthetic DMARD (csDMARD); received ≥1 glucocorticoid injection; or increased oral glucocorticoid dosing. All-cause mean annual direct costs and resource use were measured in the year of follow-up. Costs were converted from NT$ to USD using 1 NT$ = 0.033 USD. Results A total of 818 patients with RA initiated their first bDMARD (54% etanercept and 46% adalimumab) in 2010. After one year of follow-up, 32% (n = 258) were classified as stable, 66% (n = 540) had an IR, and 2% (n = 20) were lost to follow-up. During the follow-up period mean annual total direct costs were $16,136 for stable patients compared to $14,154 for patients with IR. Mean annual non-medication direct costs were $937 for stable patients and $1,574 for patients with IR. Mean annual hospitalizations were higher for patients with IR (0.46) compared to stable patients (0.10) during the one year follow-up period. Conclusions The majority of patients that were previously naïve to bDMARDs had an IR to their first bDMARD during the year of follow-up. Patients with an IR had numerically increased all-cause resource utilization and non-medication costs during the follow-up period compared to patients with stable disease. This level of IR suggests an unmet need in the RA treatment paradigm."

Although there are several studies of C. formosanus in definitive vertebrate hosts (birds and mammals, including humans), and in intermediate vertebrate hosts (fish and amphibians), there is little published information regarding interaction with its transmitting mollusc. In this study we studied the miracidial development of C. formosanus using a mouse as a source of eggs. Adult parasites were maintained in water in order to develop miracidia in intrauterine eggs. Miracidia appeared at 12 days of incubation, with no hatching observed for up to 40 days. Subsequently, we placed dead C. formosanus containing eggs with miracidia individually in contact with 48 specimens of Melanoides tuberculata, and observed the absence of the parasites after 1h of exposure, suggesting that they were ingested by the snails. Of the 33 experimentally-infected snails that were alive after 84-89 days post-infection (DPI), seven (21%) shed cercariae. We detected young C. formosanus rediae in 21/33 (64%) M. tuberculata at 90 DPI. To our knowledge, this report is the first to show that, in the life cycle of C. formosanus, infection of molluscs occurs passively by ingestion of eggs, followed by a long intramolluscan phase. We compare these data with those described for other Heterophyidae, and discuss on the phylogenetic background of the pattern of miracidial development verified in these parasites."
https://openalex.org/W2796083472,"Introduction HIV-1 dual infection is a condition that results from infection with at least two HIV-1 variants from different sources. The scarceness of information on this condition is partly due to the fact that its detection is technically challenging. Using next-generation sequencing we defined the extent of HIV-1 dual infection in a cohort of men who have sex with men (MSM). Material & methods Eighty-six MSM, diagnosed with HIV-1 subtype B infection between 2008 and 2013 were selected for next-generation sequencing of the HIV-1 envelope V3. Sequencing was performed on 2 plasma samples collected with an interval of > 6 months before the initiation of antiretroviral therapy. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were inspected for dual infection, defined as the presence of two or more monophyletic clusters with ≥ 90% bootstrap support and a mean between-cluster genetic distance of ≥ 10%. To confirm dual infection, deep V3 sequencing of intermediate samples was performed as well as clonal sequencing of the HIV-1 protease-reverse transcriptase gene. Results Five of the 74 patients (6.8%) for whom deep sequencing was successful, showed clear evidence of dual infection. In 4 of them, the second strain was absent in the first sample but occurred in subsequent samples. This was highly suggestive for superinfection. In 3 patients both virus variants were of subtype B, in 2 patients at least one of the variants was a subtype B/non-B recombinant virus. Conclusions Dual infection was confirmed in 6.8% of MSM diagnosed with HIV-1 in Belgium. This prevalence is probably an underestimation, because stringent criteria were used to classify viral variants as originating from a new infection event."
https://openalex.org/W2796144146,"Soil respiration induced by biological soil crusts (BSCs) is an important process in the carbon (C) cycle in arid and semi-arid ecosystems, where vascular plants are restricted by the harsh environment, particularly the limited soil moisture. However, the interaction between temperature and soil respiration remains uncertain because of the number of factors that control soil respiration, including temperature and soil moisture, especially in BSC-dominated areas. In this study, the soil respiration in moss-dominated crusts and lichen-dominated crusts was continuously measured using an automated soil respiration system over a one-year period from November 2015 to October 2016 in the Shapotou region of the Tengger Desert, northern China. The results indicated that over daily cycles, the half-hourly soil respiration rates in both types of BSC-covered areas were commonly related to the soil temperature. The observed diel hysteresis between the half-hourly soil respiration rates and soil temperature in the BSC-covered areas was limited by nonlinearity loops with semielliptical shapes, and soil temperature often peaked later than the half-hourly soil respiration rates in the BSC-covered areas. The average lag times between the half-hourly soil respiration rates and soil temperature for both types of BSC-covered areas were two hours over the diel cycles, and they were negatively and linearly related to the volumetric soil water content. Our results highlight the diel hysteresis phenomenon that occurs between soil respiration rates and soil temperatures in BSC-covered areas and the negative response of this phenomenon to soil moisture, which may influence total C budget evaluations. Therefore, the interactive effects of soil temperature and moisture on soil respiration in BSC-covered areas should be considered in global carbon cycle models of desert ecosystems."

Despite the growing research regarding the relationship between these factors and mental health, there are few studies that analyze them together.To investigate if the association between sleep-wake patterns and psychological well-being is mediated or moderated by perceived self-efficacy, work flexibility and work routines.This cohort study was performed in southern Brazil. A sample of 987 individuals was analyzed (66.9% women; mean age = 43.9 years). Work routines parameters and work schedule flexibility were evaluated, most participants were farmers (46%) and most worked 7 days a week (69.1%). Munich Chronotype Questionnaire (MCTQ) was administered for evaluation of sleep-wake patterns, General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSE) for assessment the participants' beliefs about how they coped with daily hassles, and World Health Organization Five-item Well-being Index (WHO-5) for evaluation of psychological well-being levels. Moderation and mediation models were tested.The moderation model showed influences of work end time on the relationship between sleep onset time and psychological well-being (R2 = 0.147; F = 24.16; p<0.001). The final regression model showed an association of psychological well-being with sex (Beta = -0.086; p = 0.004), sleep onset time (Beta = -0.086; p = 0.006), and self-efficacy (Beta = 0.316; p<0.001); the work end time showed association in the interaction with sleep onset time (Beta = -0.075; p = 0.016).The findings support the direct association of psychological well-being with sleep-wake patterns and self-efficacy, and show an interaction between work routines and sleep-wake patterns. Our results draw attention to the importance of the interplay between individual and social rhythms in relation to psychological well-being."
https://openalex.org/W2795805669,"We demonstrate the use of germanium (Ge) films as water-soluble features that allow the patterning of proteins onto surfaces with commonly used organic solvents. This technique is scalable for manufacturing and is compatible with nano- and microfabrication processes, including standard lithography. We use Ge as a sacrificial layer to mask and protect areas of the substrate during surface functionalization. Since Ge dissolves in 0.35% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in water but not in organic solvents, Ge can be removed after patterning without significantly affecting protein activities. In this paper, we present examples of protein patterning with two different techniques. We show that 50 nm thick Ge layers can be completely removed in 10 min without residues and, importantly, nanoscale resolution and misalignment can be achieved with conventional photolithography equipment. Both biotin and streptavidin maintain ~80% and >50% activity after 10 min and 360 min incubation in 0.35% H2O2, respectively. Lastly, the process can be used to functionalize sidewalls with proteins, a capability of recent interest for cell-cell adhesion studies."
https://openalex.org/W2795926890,"Increasingly, ecoimmunology studies aim to use relevant pathogen exposure to examine the impacts of infection on physiological processes in wild animals. Alphaviruses are arthropod-borne, single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses (“arboviruses”) responsible for millions of cases of human illnesses each year. Buggy Creek virus (BCRV) is a unique alphavirus that is transmitted by a cimicid insect, the swallow bug, and is amplified in two avian species: the house sparrow (Passer domesticus) and the cliff swallow (Petrochelidon pyrrhonota). BCRV, like many alphaviruses, exhibits age-dependent susceptibility where the young are most susceptible to developing disease and exhibit a high mortality rate. However, alphavirus disease etiology in nestling birds is unknown. In this study, we infected nestling house sparrows with Buggy Creek virus and measured virological, pathological, growth, and digestive parameters following infection. Buggy Creek virus caused severe encephalitis in all infected nestlings, and the peak viral concentration in brain tissue was over 34 times greater than any other tissue. Growth, tissue development, and digestive function were all significantly impaired during BCRV infection. However, based on histopathological analysis performed, this impairment does not appear to be the result of direct tissue damage by the virus, but likely caused by encephalitis and neuronal invasion and impairment of the central nervous system. This is the first study to examine the course of alphavirus diseases in nestling birds and these results will improve our understanding of age-dependent infections of alphaviruses in vertebrate hosts."

I had just started my Ph.D. studying invasive species on a remote oceanic island, where I would be spending most of the next 3 years bashing through rainforest to count invertebrates. My supervisor had done his own Ph.D. here on Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean 2 decades earlier. He had found me a place to stay and introduced me to the handful of other ecologists who were managing the national park or conducting their own research, but I wasn't working directly with them. Everyone else attached to my project was more than 5000 kilometers away—and so were my friends, family, and entire support network. I told myself I could manage on my own.

Despite my enthusiasm about my research, it wasn't long before I began to feel lonely. At times, I struggled to find the motivation to get out into the field. I was suffering from a sense of isolation that is not uncommon for Ph.D. students, which in my case was amplified by literal isolation.

I hesitated to reach out to the locals—a small community that developed after the island was first settled at the end of the 19th century. I was worried that socializing would distract from my work, and I was nervous that the locals might not welcome an “outsider.” But I eventually realized that the only way I would get through my remote Ph.D. was to reach out and create a new support network.

My first move was to visit the epicenter of any small remote community: the local pub. One afternoon, after a long day in the field, I finally dropped in for a beer. Almost immediately, someone asked how long I had been working at the power station. I was confused, but then I realized I was wearing a work shirt bearing the company logo, which I had gotten at the secondhand shop. We both had a laugh after I explained who I was and what I was doing. This shirt confusion turned out to be a great conversation starter: I ended up having that same introductory chat with a bunch of people over the next few weeks. Soon, each visit to the pub involved catching up with friends and talking about different aspects of my research, which helped keep me motivated about my work.

Connecting with the community helped with more than just my emotional well-being. When I asked a new friend to help me assemble some fences I needed for my experiments, for example, he said he was more than happy to—but not if he needed to do it the way I had planned. My friend, who was a builder, suggested a bunch of practical improvements to the design, and together we were able to get the fences up with much less trouble. I don't think I would have been able to get the experiment done without him.

My final step in becoming a full member of the Christmas Island community was to give something back. Quite a few people on the island played music, and afternoon acoustic guitar shows were not uncommon, but rock 'n' roll gigs at the pub were unacceptably rare. So along with some friends, I sniffed out equipment scattered around the island; helped organize musicians into bands; and headlined the show with a raucous set of White Stripes songs, complete with my own blues guitar stylings (although attendees were far more impressed by the drummer's skills). It felt like everyone on the island attended the show, and some were still talking about it years later.

Since finishing my Ph.D., I have moved twice for research positions, and each time I have found myself in new communities. The surroundings haven't been as extreme, but again, in the beginning, I was tempted to ignore any feelings of isolation and focus solely on work. But I knew better. I remembered how reaching out to the welcoming and supportive local community during my Ph.D. not only helped me get through the isolation, but also improved the quality of my work. And whenever I felt like a stranger, I made a point of visiting the pub.
